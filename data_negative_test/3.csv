"12573692","1","","","2012-09-24 22:14:42","","0","88","<p>I have an array. </p>

<p>In my array is the final piece of my script. My script scans all the links and puts in the array $link. Then it scans all the titles in the $link and then gets all the meta titles of the $link. But then some people don't have meta descriptions, so I decided to create a function which returns 20 characters of a p tag scanned.</p>

<p>Though in my array, my if statement doesn't seem to work. It is supposed to detect if there is any input in the 'description' key in the variable and then use the instructions in the if statement. </p>

<p>However, it doesn't seem to be doing that and I keep thinking I am missing something.</p>

<pre><code>function getMetas($link) {
    $str1 = file_get_contents($link);    

    if (strlen($str1)&gt;0) {
        preg_match_all( '/&lt;meta.*?name=(""|\')description(""|\').*?content=(""|\')(.*?)(""|\')/i', $str1, $description);
        if (count($description) &gt; 1) {
            return $description[4];   
        }

    }


}

function get_custom_excerpt($return, $option = 30, $sentance = false) {
    $marks = Array(""."",""!"",""?"");

    $return = strip_tags($return);

    if($sentance == true) {
        $start = implode("" "", array_slice(preg_split(""/\s+/"", $return), 0, $option ));
        $start .= ' ';
        $end = implode("" "", array_slice(preg_split(""/\s+/"", $return), $option));

        $cut = Array();
        foreach($marks AS $m =&gt; $mark){
            $mark = strpos($end, $mark);
            if($mark != false) $cut[$m] = $mark;
        }

        if($cut[0] != """")
            $chop = min($cut);
        else
            $chop = $option;
        $rest = substr($end, 0, $chop);

        $key = array_search($chop, $cut);

        $return = $start.$rest;

    }else{
        $return = implode("" "", array_slice(preg_split(""/\s+/"", $return), 0, $option));
    }
    $return .= $marks[$key];

    return $return; 
}     


$html = file_get_contents($link);    
preg_match('%(&lt;p[^&gt;]*&gt;.*?&lt;/p&gt;)%i', $html, $re);
$res = get_custom_excerpt($re[1]);


$out = Array();

foreach ($links as $thisLink) {
    $out = array(""link"" =&gt; $thisLink, ""title"" =&gt; Titles($thisLink), ""description"" =&gt; getMetas($thisLink));

    if (empty($out['description'])) {
        $out['description'] = $res;
    }

    $output[] = $out;

}
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, the code works perfectly except the if statement. The function has been executed on a smaller array, not the array I am using, and it has returned results to my standard. But it seems to create another key ('description') instead of adding the p tag to it. Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('User', []); // include a bunch of user stuff
angular.module('App1', ['User']);
angular.module('App2', ['User']);
</code></pre>

<p>Which isn't new to anyone. But with ui-router I also would like to define states in a module.</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('User').config(function($stateProvider) {
  $stateProvider.state('user', {})
  .state('user.profile', {});
});
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that I want <code>user</code> and <code>user.profile</code> as a child state of one of the apps states. Something like- <code>root.users.user.profile</code>. But I don't want the <code>User</code> module to have to be aware of that. The <code>User</code> module should only define states in it's small view of the world.</p>

<p>Is it possible to append already defined states? How do you write states in modules like this so that it stays modular?</p>

<p>1) Not use any JS frameworks or libraries (jQuery, Prototype, etc).</p>

<p>2) The script should halt execution until the external js file is completely loaded and parsed by the browser.</p>

<p>The rational behind #2 is the external js file will include function definitions that need to be used immediately after the script is included. Most of the time the browser hasn't had time to parse the js file before I start calling those functions.</p>

<p>I don't mind using a callback to know when the script is finished loading, but:</p>

<p>1) I don't know ahead of time how many scripts are going to be dynamically included, so I don't want and can't write a bunch of nested callbacks. I just need to know when they're all finished loading.</p>

<p>2) I'm wording that trying to use some kind of ""load"" event to fire the callback might not work if the browser has cached the JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> I should have mentioned from the start that this is for a plugin system, but I wanted to keep my question/answer generic enough to be helpful to other people.</p>

<p>Users would define which plugins they want to load in an array.</p>

<pre><code>plugins = [ 'FooPlugin', 'BarPlugin' ];
</code></pre>

<p>I would then loop through the array, and load the js script for each plugin:</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; plugins.length; i++) {
    loadScript('plugins/' + plugins[i] + '.js');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each plugin pushes itself onto the loaded_plugins array (This is an example of FooPlugin.js)</p>

<pre><code>load_plugins.push({
    name: 'FooPlugin',
    // Other plugin methods and properties here
});

"32365714","1","","","2015-09-03 01:41:47","","1","24","<p>This question is regarding a pattern that  observed while doing some maintenance work on Node.js project with Backbone.js in front end and Express framework in the backend. Usually, when I use backbone.js in the frontend, I will create routes using Backbone.js router component and then render views based on the route being accessed by the user. For example, if the user is accessing <code>/user/settings</code>, it will load the <code>UserSettingsView</code> and the associated model(User).
However, in this project, the way the guy who wrote the code is using Backbone.js is quite different. First of all, the router component and Backbone.js routes are not at all used. All the routing is handled by Express itself. When a page loads, it is initially checked wheather a <code>div</code> with a specific id is present in the page and if it exists, then a specific Backbone.js view is initiated and that div's id passed to that view as the <code>el</code> and the associated model/collection is fetched and rendered. For example, see the code below:</p>

<pre><code>$profileEdit = $(""#profile-edit"");
if ($profileEdit.length) {
  profileEdit = new App.ProfileView({
    el: $profileEdit,
    model: user
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, is this a recommended pattern to use? Are there any disadvantages/advantages of using this pattern over the conventional pattern? </p>

<p>I have a multilingual DrupaL 7 site set up with English being the main language and French being the secondary language. I have url aliasing set up and for the most part it works correctly.</p>

<p>The problem arises when I have pages that I don't want included in a menu, so I leave the ""provide a menu link"" box unchecked. Even if the ""Generate automatic URL aliases"" box is checked for those pages without a menu link, the page completely ignore any url alias patterns I have set up and the url always shows up as 'node/31' instead of 'my-content-page'. If I hardcode in a URL alias via the URL path settings on the page, it WILL take those, but this is not what I want. I want it to take the url alias pattern I've set up for it. I even installed the ""Pathauto persistent state"" module and forced the ""Generate automatic URL aliases"" to remain checked just in case, but my alias patters are still ignored.</p>

<p>Both English and French pages do this if the page is not provided a menu link.</p>

Those are styled correctly, (using Arial font, bold and normal) - PDF contains Swedish characters, and everything works when I print it.
However, I've been working on an solution to not show the pdf file itself to the user, just start the print dialogue. I have used iTextSharp to include JS code what will automatically print the PDF once started.</p>

<p>Method that adds the JS to the provided file and sends it to the user:</p>

<pre><code>protected void StreamPdf(string pdfSource)
    {
        var outputStream = new MemoryStream();
        var pdfReader = new PdfReader(pdfSource);
        var pdfStamper = new PdfStamper(pdfReader, outputStream);
        //Add the auto-print javascript
        var writer = pdfStamper.Writer;
        writer.AddJavaScript(GetAutoPrintJs());
        pdfStamper.Close();
        var content = outputStream.ToArray();
        outputStream.Close();

        Response.End();
        outputStream.Close();
        outputStream.Dispose();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>CODE 1: </p>

stage.stageHeight = Capabilities.screenResolutionY;


var arrayStars:Array = [];
for(var i:int = 0; i&lt;260; i++)

<pre><code>stop();
stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE;
var sX:Number =stage.stageWidth;
var sY:Number = stage.stageHeight;


var arrayStars:Array = [];

}
</code></pre>

<p>CODE 3: Similar to code 2, but instead of using the variables sX and sY I've used directly stage.stageWidth and stage.stageHeight.
The main problem is not getting the app to run in fullscreen, it does, but the movie clips, stay all in a area, not covering all the screen. I think that the problem may not have to do with the fullscreen methods, maybe with the random generator?</p>

<p>1_ I would like to add a button to mute/unmute audio. I'm not that great at jquery so what I'm looking for is what I need to add to the existing code to make it happen and what I need to put in the place where I want the actual button to go. I'm guessing I need to add some mute option to...</p>

<pre><code>    $('.bg').videoBG({
    position:""fixed"",
    zIndex:0,
    mp4:'_video/ClimbBG.mp4',
    ogv:'_video/ClimbBG.ogv',
    webm:'_video/ClimbBG.webm',
    poster:'_images/ClimbBG.jpg',
    opacity:1,
    fullscreen:true,

});
</code></pre>

<p>Then some function/code in the spot I want the button to be?    </p>

<p>2_ I would like to have a different random video load each time the site is loaded. Maybe even have a new video play after the first one is finished? 
Example...This site loads a different video when the page is refreshed (  cabin-time.com  )</p>

<p>3_ Not super important but I've noticed a lot of people who use video backgrounds have little dots in the video (cabin-time.con is one example). I'm guessing this is to reduce file size? Most likely done in Final Cut? How do I add this into my video and does it really reduce file size?</p>

<p>Apart from the testability issue and the fact that this ""feels dirty"" doing WPF like this, I have <strong>only experienced positive effects</strong> from this decision, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>we can inherit our non-XAML UserControls from each other</li>
<li>we use as much code-behind as we want which expedites development</li>
<li>attaching the infragistic controls directly to our model class coming from the web service cleared up dozens of little binding problems we were having with binding Infragistics to ObservableCollections</li>
<li>even in straight WPF, the lack of ObservableCollections make problems like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1067903/how-can-i-bind-an-observablecollection-of-viewmodels-to-a-menuitem"">not being able to create a simple Menu</a> go away</li>
<li>we are replacing the EventAggregator one-by-one with direct events using UserControls and code behind, which cleared up all kinds of problems with events</li>
</ul>

Google searches only gives back answers like build up the data manually. like: <code>name: X Y</code>, <code>age: 32</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to do that?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""test.php"" method=""post""&gt;
Name: &lt;input type=""text"" name=""name""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Age: &lt;input type=""text"" name=""email""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
FavColor: &lt;input type=""text"" name=""favc""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=""submit""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

<p>And my rather general question is: are there any advantages/disadvantages of using selenium 2 for Java vs .NET applications?</p>

So I modified an existing driver and made the process to sleep using wait_event_interruptible after triggering DMA transfer and made it woken up by ISR using wake_up_interruptible. My problem is that the original driver was using spinlock to protect the FIFO access. But as all know, while holding spinlock, I should not sleep. So I tried replacing spinlock with mutex. (Because, I might sleep while acquiring the mutex, and after getting the mutex, I'll sleep again after DMA trigger. I get woken up by the ISR, and I'll release the mutex. No problem! I thought. ) But I still get this 'scheduling while atomic BUG'. The question is : I need to go to sleep until DMA completion while holding a lock (for FIFO read and write). Isn't it ok to sleep while holding a mutex?<br>
ADD : In my case, the receive function reading the receive FIFO was NAPI poll function which is a one of softirq (interrupt mask is reset, but still it's interrupt context. tasklet is also interrupt context). To read FIFO I use DMA and goto sleep, so this was the problem : sleeping during softirq.</p>

<p>When these 2 objects contain say obj1 100 possible paths and obj2 1000 possible paths, myclass produces 100,000 statements to eval. thats it, it runs for ever well known eval is slow but since these statements are string I am unable to put it in ""if"" </p>

<p>I tried a test code where i used statements in if statements, it was very - very fast. i want to use if over eval. </p>

<p>My test code is given below: </p>

<pre><code>var before = Date.now();
    var str, result, results = [], m, n;
    for(var i = 0, j=0; i &lt;100000, j&lt;100000; ++i,++j ){
        str = i + ""==="" + j;

        //eval(str)

        if(i === j) {
            result = true;
        } else {
            result = false;

    }

    var after = Date.now();
    console.log(""Time: "", (after - before));
</code></pre>

<p>Since these expressions can be any valid JS expression I can not assume operators. users are free to used any kind of operators(Assignment, Comparison, Arithmetic, Bitwise, Logical, String or Special operators) in expression.</p>

<p>for example : </p>

<pre><code>""{source.cn}==={target.cid} &amp;&amp; {target.name} != 'XX'""
or
""({source.cn}==={target.cid} || {source.cn}/100 === 1 )&amp;&amp; {target.name} != 'XX'""
or anything else.
</code></pre>

<p>I dont want to write my own expression parser.</p>

<p>Please help by providing (without using eval)
1. alternative approach (but not (new Function(expr)())
2. some way to use ""if"" over ""eval"" will make my code very fast. like the above test proves. 
3. Any other approach to make it fast without compromising on requirement. (and yes there could be multiple matches in target object) </p>

"31950080","1","","","2015-08-11 19:12:57","","0","42","<p>Many times, I've used the <code>const</code> and <code>mutable</code> concept in C++ to create ""const"" or ""mutable"" types of objects, (similar to <code>iterator</code> vs <code>const_iterator</code>).  The point is to provide different types of ""views"" (const or mutable views) over other objects.  The general idea is that a mutable_object is convertible to a const_object, but a const_object is NOT convertible to a mutable_object, just like <code>iterator</code> vs. <code>const_iterator</code>.</p>

<p>This is very easy to achieve, by simply creating two types, and for the ""const"" type, you create a (non-explicit) constructor that takes a mutable type:</p>

<pre><code>class mutable_object
{
    public:
    mutable_object() = default;
};

class const_object
{
    public:

    const_object() = default;
    const_object(const const_object&amp;) = default;

    const_object(mutable_object m)
    { }
};

void function_that_takes_a_const_object(const_object)
{ }

void function_that_takes_a_mutable_object(mutable_object)
{ }

int main()
{
    const_object c;
    mutable_object m;
    function_that_takes_a_const_object(c);
    function_that_takes_a_const_object(m); // works

    function_that_takes_a_mutable_object(m);
    function_that_takes_a_mutable_object(c); // will fail
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, this is simple enough, and it nicely reproduces the C++ semantics of const vs. mutable types, like <code>const_iterator</code> vs <code>iterator</code>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>But, I tried to replicate this using class template types that take variadic template arguments, but can't get it to work:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class... T&gt;
struct mutable_object
{ };

template &lt;class... T&gt;
struct const_object
{
    const_object(const const_object&amp;) { }
    const_object(mutable_object&lt;T...&gt;) { }

    template &lt;class... U&gt;
    const_object(mutable_object&lt;U...&gt;) { }
};

template &lt;class... T&gt;
void FOO(const_object&lt;T...&gt; obj)
{ }

int main()
{
    mutable_object&lt;bool,bool,int&gt; m;
    FOO(m); // fails to compile
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, calling <code>FOO</code> with a <code>mutable_object&lt;T...&gt;</code> fails, with the compiler error:</p>

<pre><code>test2.cpp:38:7: error: no matching function for call to ‘FOO(mutable_object&lt;bool, bool, int&gt;&amp;)’
test2.cpp:38:7: note: candidate is:
test2.cpp:29:6: note: template&lt;class ... T&gt; void FOO(const_object&lt;T ...&gt;)
test2.cpp:29:6: note:   template argument deduction/substitution failed:
test2.cpp:38:7: note:   ‘mutable_object&lt;bool, bool, int&gt;’ is not derived from ‘const_object&lt;T ...&gt;’
</code></pre>

<p>So, template argument substitution fails here.  I'm not exactly sure why, but I guess it has to do with the fact that more than one deduction would need to take place, first deducing the types for <code>T...</code>, and then finding a suitable conversion construction.</p>

<p>So, is there any way to write a conversion constructor for <code>mutable_object&lt;T...&gt; --&gt; const_object&lt;T...&gt;</code> that will enable the compiler to properly bind a function call to <code>FOO</code>, where we pass <code>FOO</code> an instance of <code>mutable_object&lt;T...&gt;</code>?</p>

"19943169","1","19943514","","2013-11-13 00:53:29","","2","77","<p>I created a library that extends off of another library written in C++, and now I'm porting this library over to Java (the original library that the C++ was written on top of already exists in Java). In the C++ code there is a purely virtual class called <code>Stallable</code> that is supposed to be used in order to add stall detection to a motor controller given a delta in voltage input. The class contains a purely virtual method <code>getVoltage()</code> which is used to supply a voltage source as they're several different motor controller classes, and some virtual functions to determine if there is a stall.</p>

<p>Classes would subclass this class, as well as a class from the original library (one that I do not have access to the code and for all intents and purposes otherwise can't modify), and would implement <code>getVoltage()</code>, and override any other methods that they might like. Then these objects can just be asked if there is a stall.</p>

<p>When I approach this problem from the Java side of things, my situation becomes a bit more tricky. I still can not touch the original class so refactoring the code is not an option, and users of my library should still be allowed to subclass or implement <code>Stallable</code> however they see fit. </p>

<p>Currently, the prospectives I see are as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make <code>Stallable</code> an interface and reimplement the stall detection logic it uses. In order to create the original functionality that the C++ codebase has I'd have to have classes subclass the original library and implement <code>Stallable</code>. This would work but would require the logic in the original purely virtual C++ <code>Stallable</code> to be reimplemented among any subclasses that I'd include, and any subclasses that end users would write.</li>
<li>Make <code>Stallable</code> an abstract class that holds an object reference to a motor controller class from the original library. This preserves some of the functionality from the C++ code such that some methods would have to be overridden, and some are optionally overridden, however transparency is lost between this code and the C++ code. In C++, Since every subclass was a <code>Stallable</code> and a derivation off of the original motor controller, it became easy to toss pointers around to the object when the motor controller was needed, and when a <code>Stallable</code> object was needed. In this case, some type of accessor function would have to be implemented that returns a Java reference to the original motor controller that each <code>Stallable</code> subclass would hold on to. Transparency would be lost, but stall detection would easily be added.</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously if I could modify the original classes for the various motor controllers this problem could easily be a matter of refactoring C++ code. </p>

<p>After researching the disparities between both languages' approach to OOP, I'm inclined to go with option 2 despite the friction it adds for my end users and the <code>Stallable</code> implementations I plan on including. I was asking if there was any other better ideas or insight before I start writing Stallable.java.</p>

I want the behavior to work like CKFinder's popup functionality. I want the user to click a ""choose file"" button, Ajaxplorer appears in a new window, the user selects the file, and then the path to that file is sent back to the form and the popup is closed. I'm pretty sure that this is possible because the CKEditor plugin for Ajaxplorer seems to do just that.</p>

<p>I'm new to Ajaxsplorer, so I am just digging in. I was hoping that I could somehow pass a callback method to Ajaxplorer that would populate my field on select. However, it doesn't appear that I can do that based on the docs.</p>

<p>The other option looks like creating a plugin. I'm happy to do this, but the documentation is weak and it seems like others would have done this by now. So, before digging in to that for hours trying to learn the plugin system, I wanted to pose this question to the community.  Is there documentation or a plugin for Ajaxplorer that will allow me to send selected file info from a popup window back to my form?</p>

<p>The ""includes-clean"" task is a good place to start. The task copies htm* and font files to my dist output. For my current test project, it matches on 7 files which total 32kb. Shouldn't take long, but I'm seeing an average of 15 seconds to complete the task.</p>

<p>I suspect the way I handle the commonIgnore list might be the issue. If gulp is traversing all of the node_modules and vendor folder (even though they should be ignored), it might cause the slowdown.</p>

What appears to be happening, however, is that I see the log <code>Parse triggered!</code>, but the response object that I'm accessing in myFunction is not parsed at all. In other words, its as if the JSON had just been passed straight through.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

"15097012","1","15111101","","2013-02-26 18:51:59","","8","361","<p>I've written an Emacs Lisp function which calls a shell command to
process a given string and return the resulting string.  Here is a
simplified example which just calls <code>tr</code> to convert text to uppercase:</p>

<pre><code>(defun test-shell-command (str)
  ""Apply tr to STR to convert lowercase letters to uppercase.""
  (let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer ""*temp*"")))
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      (insert str)
      (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max) ""tr"" t t nil ""'a-z'"" ""'A-Z'"")
      (buffer-string))))
</code></pre>

<p>This function creates a temporary buffer, inserts the text, calls
<code>tr</code>, replaces the text with the result, and returns the result.</p>

<p>The above function works as expected, however, when I write a wrapper
around this function to apply the command to the region, two steps are
being added to the undo history.  Here's another example:</p>

<pre><code>(defun test-shell-command-region (begin end)
  ""Apply tr to region from BEGIN to END.""
  (interactive ""*r"")
  (insert (test-shell-command (delete-and-extract-region begin end))))
</code></pre>

<p>When I call <code>M-x test-shell-command-on-region</code>, the region is replaced
with the uppercase text, but when I press <code>C-_</code> (<code>undo</code>), the first
step in the undo history is the state with the text deleted.  Going
two steps back, the original text is restored.</p>

<p>My question is, how does one prevent the intermediate step from being
added to the undo history?  I've read the <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html"">Emacs documentation on undo</a>,
but it doesn't seem to address this as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Here's a function which accomplishes the same thing by calling the
built-in Emacs function <code>upcase</code>, just as before: on the result of
<code>delete-and-extract-region</code> with the result being handed off to
<code>insert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(defun test-upcase-region (begin end)
  ""Apply upcase to region from BEGIN to END.""
  (interactive ""*r"")
  (insert (upcase (delete-and-extract-region begin end))))
</code></pre>

<p>When calling <code>M-x test-upcase-region</code>, there is only one step in the
undo history, as expected.  So, it seems to be the case that calling
<code>test-shell-command</code> creates an undo boundary.  Can that be avoided
somehow?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""check_list[]"" value=""ki67"" /&gt;  ki67&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""check_list[]"" value=""myc"" /&gt;  myc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""check_list[]"" value=""mta1"" /&gt;  mta1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""check_list[]"" value=""mvd/cd34"" /&gt;  mvd/cd34&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then run them through PHP to tell the user what has been checked:</p>

<pre><code>if(!empty($_POST['check_list'])) {
    foreach($_POST['check_list'] as $check) {
        echo $check . ""&lt;br&gt;"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to run them through a MySQL process to display how many rows have been selected.  Here's my code for that part:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
//perform database query
$query = ""SELECT COUNT(*) "";
$query .= ""FROM testdata "";

if(!empty($_POST['check_list'])) {
    foreach($_POST['check_list'] as $check) {
        $query .= ""WHERE rd_$check = 1"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then later:</p>

<pre><code>$result = mysqli_query($link, $query);
if (!$result) {
    die(""Database query failed."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem comes when I try to check multiple boxes.  I don't know how to concatenate more onto <code>$query</code>.  The command would have to look something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM testdata WHERE rd_ki67 = 1 AND rd_myc = 1 AND ...;

A connection is made to the device when the service initially starts up.
This is the code we use to initiate the connection to the device:</p>

<pre><code>scaleData.Client = New TcpClient(ipAddress, (portNumber))
scaleData.Stream = scaleData.Client.GetStream()
</code></pre>

<p>The service is hosted as a Windows service (as opposed to through IIS).</p>

<p>We have two applications that pull data from the WCF service,
an asp.net application and a winforms application.</p>

<p>The request returns data from the stream to the caller/client.</p>

<pre><code>Try
                    Dim bytes As Int32 = scaleData.Stream.Read(data, 0, data.Length)
                    responseData = Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(data, 0, bytes)c
 Catch ex As IOException
                    exceptionMsg = String.Format(""IOEXCEPTION!!! :: {0}"", ex.Message)
End Try
</code></pre>

<p>Both the (winforms) test application, web application and windows service all reside on the same Windows 7 machine.</p>

<p>For the most part, this configuration works fine. But occasionally it fails.(we can't quite determine the pattern to it or specifics to it's occurrence) <strong>with the following message</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
</code></pre>

<p>Upon failure, we now added retry logic to try to reestablish the TCP connection and read from the stream, but that doesn't seem to fix the issue. I've also got logging enabled which captures the exceptions to a log file. All the log shows is the above mentioned message.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to what is going on here?
Is this a Firewall/Port/virus scanner issue?</p>

<p>How do we best proceed?</p>

<p>As I previously mentioned, the service for the most part works and retrieves the desired results from the TCP connection. It only seems to fail occasionally, but it will eventually fail.</p>

<pre><code>./my-bucket
  ├── first_user@email.com
  └── second_user@email.com
</code></pre>

<p>So, the <code>my-bucket</code> bucket will have folders based on the user's e-mail address.</p>

<p>My first stab to setup the policy was as such:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [""s3:ListBucket""],

        ""s3:PutObject"",
        ""s3:DeleteObject""

        ""arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/${www.amazon.com:user_id}"",
        ""arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/${www.amazon.com:user_id}/*""
      ]
    }
  ]
}

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>final Map logins = new HashMap();
logins.put(""www.amazon.com"", token);
credentialsProvider.withLogins(logins);

final TransferManager transferManager = new TransferManager(credentialsProvider);
MultipleFileDownload download = transferManager.downloadDirectory(""my-bucket"", ""first_user@email.com"", new File(""/sdcard/Download""));
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I run this I get a ""Forbidden"" exception. If I modify the policy to explicitly reference <code>first_user@email.com</code> rather than <code>${www.amazon.com:user_id}</code> it works fine.</p>

<li>Is this even possible to be able to use the LWA user's e-mail address to configure it like this?</li>

<p>I have created the softlink to /usr/local/opt/postgresql/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents.</p>

<p>If I try to manually load postgres I get the message that the ""Operation is in progress""</p>

<pre><code>&gt; launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

<p>However postgres does not appear to be running.</p>

    Is the server running locally and accepting
    connections on Unix domain socket ""/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432""?
</code></pre>

<p>To my knowledge I have tried all the fixes suggested on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13410686/postgres-could-not-connect-to-server"">other</a> <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12472988/postgres-could-not-connect-to-server-no-such-file-or-directory"">Stackoverflow</a> threads discussing this problem. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have uninstalled and reinstalled postgres and the accompanying Ruby gem. There is no postgres 8.0 version on my machine.</li>
<li>I have verified that the psql client program is the 9.4.0 version installed by Homebrew and not a Mac system binary.</li>
<li>I have verified that the /usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid does not exist.</li>
<li>I have rebooted the machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did have Homebrew postgres working on this machine earlier. I think what broke it is upgrading from version 8 to version 9 but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>I don't have any databases I need to preserve. I'm willing to start clean with postgres; I just need to get it to work now. Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>The issue appears to have been permissions on the /usr/local/var/postgres directory. Here is what my var directory looked like when things weren't working.</p>

<pre><code>ll /usr/local/var/
drwxr-xr-x  3 billmcn  admin  102 Dec 20 12:44 cache
drwxr--r--  2 root     admin   68 Dec 29 21:37 postgres
</code></pre>

<p>(whoami = ""billmcn"")</p>

<p>I deleted /usr/local/var/postgres, uninstalled and reinstalled postgres, and now it looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>ll /usr/local/var/
drwxr-xr-x   3 billmcn  admin  102 Dec 20 12:44 cache
drwx------  23 billmcn  admin  782 Dec 30 10:51 postgres
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure how it got into this state because I don't remember futzing with the permissions on this directory, but no matter. It works now.</p>

<p>Currently all my components are in one file even though I may never load them in some sections of the app. </p>

<p><a href=""http://pulsar.webshaker.net/ccc/sample-d3a7fe78"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pulsar.webshaker.net/ccc/sample-d3a7fe78</a></p>

<p>As one can see, the code is taking around 13 cycles. But when I load the code on the board, the load instructions seems to take more than one cycle per load, I verified and found out that the VPADAL is taking 1 cycle as stated, but VLD1 is taking more than one cycle. Why is that?</p>

<p>I have taken care of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The address is 16 byte aligned.</li>
<li>Have provided the alignment hint in the instruction <code>vld1.64 {d0, d1} [r0,:128]!</code></li>
<li>Tried preload instruction <code>pld [r0, #192]</code>, at places but that seems to add to the cycles instead of actually reducing the latency.</li>

"25046000","1","","","2014-07-30 20:09:45","","1","92","<p>I'm trying to dispatch the items from a conduit into many output files, the problem is very similar to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23169458/conduit-multiple-output-file-within-the-pipeline"">Conduit - Multiple output file within the pipeline</a>, with a few differences:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the previous solution, every sink has a filter that decides if the element belongs to that sink or not. In my case every element coming from the upstream goes exactly to one file, and in the case where there is a big number of files it would be better to make only one operation to decide to which file is it going.</p></li>
<li><p>The files are created on demand. A ""selector"" function decides which sink the next element is going to, and if it doesn't exist yet it creates it using a ""create new sink"" function.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example if the Source yields: 8 4 7 1 5<br>
And the sink selector is a module 3, then the sequence of actions would be:</p>

<pre><code>Create file 2
Add 8 to file 2
Create file 1
Add 4 to file 1
Add 7 to file 1
Add 1 to file 1
Add 5 to file 2
</code></pre>

<p>I'm thinking of a type for this dispatcher like this:</p>

<pre><code>        dispatcherSink_ :: (Monad m) =&gt; 
                           (a -&gt; k) -&gt;               -- sink selector
                           (k -&gt; Sink a m ()) -&gt;     -- new sink
                           Sink a m ()
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried to write the function using evalStateC with an internal StateT holding a Map of Sinks, but I'm not able to tie up the types. I'm not sure if you can even use the same sink twice.</p>

<p>Is what I'm trying to do even possible? </p>

<p>I'm still a newbie in Haskell, so any help will be appreciated.</p>

<h2>Edited</h2>

<p>I though I could create a map of ResumableSinks, there is a library in  Hackage for that, but it depends on an old and very specific version of Conduit, so cabal couldn't install it.
In the end I didn't find a way to write the function with the previous type, able to work with any sink, so I came up with a function that works with files directly:</p>

<pre><code>import System.IO (hClose,openFile,IOMode(WriteMode))
import Conduit
import Data.IOData
import qualified Data.Foldable as F
import qualified Data.Map.Strict as M
import Control.Monad.State.Strict

fileDispatcherSink ::
  (MonadIO m, IOData c,Ord k) =&gt;
  (a -&gt; k) -&gt;
  (a -&gt; c) -&gt;
  (k -&gt; FilePath) -&gt;
  Sink a m ()
fileDispatcherSink selector toChunked path =
  evalStateC M.empty $ dispatcher 
  where 
    dispatcher = do
      next  &lt;- await
      m &lt;- get
      case next of
        Nothing -&gt; liftIO $ F.traverse_ hClose m
        Just a -&gt; do
          let k = selector a
          h &lt;- case M.lookup k m of
                Nothing -&gt; do
                  nh &lt;- liftIO $ openFile (path k) WriteMode
                  put $ M.insert k nh m
                  return nh
                Just h -&gt; return h
          yield (toChunked a) $$ sinkHandle h
          dispatcher

testSource :: (Monad m) =&gt; Source m Int
testSource = yieldMany [8, 4, 7, 1, 5]

main :: IO ()
main = testSource
       $$ fileDispatcherSink (`mod` 3) (pack . show) ((++ "".txt"") . show)

<p>I'll be adding a lot of references throughout a few pages and am not sure how to accomplish this behavior in markdown. All the resources I've found require a lot of work to keep track of them, you have to order them yourself, both at the bottom and top of the page, as opposed to Wiki markup which can automatically build the list at the bottom of a page with a simple {reflist}. Something similar to the TOC. Is there nothing like this in Markdown? </p>

<p>The client sends to the server (using WCF) the names of one or more resources (for example, it sends a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code>). On the server there may be only a subset of the resources requested by the client, so when a server receives this list, it sends back a list containing only the names of found resources.</p>

<p>I would like to generalize the search criteria that the client sends to the server, so that in future it is easy to extend the application (both client-side and server-side) with a more complex search criteria.
To achieve this goal, I thought to create the <code>ISearchCriteria</code> interface, so the client should send an object of a class which implements this interface.</p>

<pre><code>public interface ISearchCriteria
{
    // the names of the resources which match with the search criteria
    ICollection&lt;string&gt; GetCompliantResources();
}
</code></pre>

<p>However it seems to me that this solution is not very correct, because the <code>GetComplianceResources</code> method should interact with the dictionary on the server, but the client should not know anything about this dictionary...  I might use the <em>strategy pattern</em>, associating each concrete strategy to the specific search criteria. In this way could separate the control logic from the data (ie. the search criteria).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (strategy pattern and DTO)</strong></p>

<pre><code>// Both on the server and on the client
public interface ISearchCriteria
{
    // empty
}

// Both on the server and on the client
public class DefaultSearchCriteriaDTO : ISearchCriteria
{
    List&lt;string&gt; ResourceNames { get; set; }
    List&lt;int&gt; OtherCriteria { get; set; }
}

// Both on the server and on the client
public class MySearchCriteriaDTO : ISearchCriteria
{
    string SearchString { get; set; }
}

// On the server.
public interface IStrategy&lt;T&gt; : where T : ISearchCriteria
{
    public List&lt;string&gt; Match(T criteria);
}

// On the server
public class DefaultStrategy : IStrategy&lt;T&gt; where T : DefaultSearchCriteriaDTO
{
    public List&lt;string&gt; Match(T criteria)
    {
        // search for resources and returns those found

<p>Javascript with a sad attempt at waypoints, plus script for an effect that highlights each number on the scale as the user scrolls to the corresponding page:</p>

<p>Here's what I want it to do: I want #title and h2 to fade in when the document loads, and to fade away once the user scrolls past the first section. Then I want .bortlescale (shows up as a vertical row of white numbers in white circles with no fill) to scroll in to the new page from the bottom and stick right in the middle of the left margin of the page (so where it is now margin-wise, then just centered vertically). I want it to stay there for the rest of the time (there are 8 other sections like #Class1 that I didn't include for space purposes, which each show up as the user scrolls down). As the user scrolls to each section, the corresponding number on the scale will highlight. You can also click a number and be whooshed to the corresponding section explanation.</p>

<p>With the js as it is right now, none of that is happening, not even the fade-ins at the beginning which I thought would be pretty simple. I'm thinking it has something to do with how everything is positioned in relation to each other, but I'm pretty lost right now. Can someone help explain how to do this or at least tell me any problems in my code that could explain some of these issues? Thank you!</p>

<p>Well, the problem is the ""Contact Listener"". I can't seem to understand what it really does, and how I can use it to make the difference between my coins and other bodies (that are all static bodies) around the map.
I set all the coins <code>.isSensor = true</code> to disable collisions. I'm using <em>MyContactListener</em> from raywenderlich.com tutorial.</p>

<p>So, the main question is: How to know what type of body is in collision with the hero's body through the contact listener?</p>

<p>Si, I finally got it to work with sprite.tag, but I can't destroy the bodies and the textures. Sometimes when using <code>[textureB removeFromParentAndCleanup:YES];</code> I get <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code>.

</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can see, this is the line that I need to change:</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON('http://www.highcharts.com/samples/data/jsonp.php?filename=aapl-c.json&amp;callback=?', function(data) {
</code></pre>

<p>On my local server, I can use the following link to extract data from reporting tool (which reads from SQL database).</p>

<pre><code>//localserver/query=ZZZ
</code></pre>

<p>and this outputs as:</p>

<pre><code>[{f1:""[[1338732000000,29119.439],""},
{f1:""[1338818400000,30367.229],""},
{f1:""[1338904800000,29221.893],""},
{f1:""[1339336800000,29640.756]]""}]
</code></pre>

<p><em>Or I can pass it out as such:</em></p>

<pre><code>[[1338732000000,29119.439],
[1338818400000,30367.229],
[1338904800000,29221.893],
[1338991200000,31075.204],
[1339077600000,29449.717],
[1339336800000,29640.756]]
</code></pre>

<p><em>I appreciate the data format(s) above are slighly different to what is expected by HighCharts.</em></p>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<p>a) Is it possible to populate the highchart via data on demand from local server without using a PHP file? </p>

<p>Everything is on the same/local server. Reporting software has a web element, that queries a SQL database, and returns the data set.</p>

<p>Basically I want to replace this:</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON('http://www.highcharts.com/samples/data/jsonp.php?filename=aapl-c.json&amp;callback=?', function(data) {
</code></pre>

<p>With this:</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON('http://localserver/query=ZZZ', function(data) {
</code></pre>

<p>Reason being that reporting software allows users to change dates, variables (e.g. Country) etc, and then I'd want that to update the chart.</p>

<p>b) Can I parse/translate the data in JavaScript inside the html? </p>

<p>I think half the problem I am having is getting the reporting software and Highcharts Javascript to handshake. I've tried the local csv example from their site, but I can't get that to work at all, and can't find a full html/javascript example anywhere.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>So, I added line to RouteServiceProvider.php:</p>

<pre><code>public function boot(Router $router)
{
    parent::boot($router);

    $router-&gt;model('user', 'App\User');
}
</code></pre>

<p>I added route:</p>

<pre><code>Route::get('/profile/{user}', function(App\User $user)
{
    die(var_dump($user));
});
</code></pre>

<p>Default Laravel user model is used. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php namespace App;

 use Illuminate\Auth\Authenticatable;
 use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
 use Illuminate\Auth\Passwords\CanResetPassword;
 use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable as AuthenticatableContract;
 use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\CanResetPassword as CanResetPasswordContract;

 class User extends Model implements AuthenticatableContract,    CanResetPasswordContract {

     use Authenticatable, CanResetPassword;

/**

     protected $table = 'users';

/**

/**
 * The attributes excluded from the model's JSON form.

     protected $hidden = ['password', 'remember_token'];

 }

<p>And I have MySQL table 'users'. When I go to URL <a href=""http://blog.app/profile/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.app/profile/1</a>, I expect to see data for user with ID 1, but I don't understand how to get actual model values. Instead I see:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pjTWD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is there any special methods for getting model values? Or did I miss something?</p>

<p>In above [1,1] shows that word number 1 occurs with word 1 in sentence 4 and 3, [1,2] shows word 1 and word 2 occurs in sentence 1 2 and 3 and so on.</p>

<p>What I want to do is to implement an element absorption technique, which will remove all cells which contain supersets of other cells. As we can see above 4 and 3 in [1,1] are subset of [1,2] so <code>OccursTogether[1,2]</code> entry should be deleted and output should be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>occurs[1,1]= 4 3
occurs[1,3]= 4 3

<p>I'm using this example:

<p>Problem:
When the signup form does not validate (say you forgot one of the fields) and we redirect to the failureRedirect (which is the same signup page), all the entered values are gone. Not a very good user experience that you have to fill out the entire form because you messed up a single field.</p>

<p>How do I pass the already entered data on the the form?</p>

<p>I got these two routes handing the GET and POST of the form:</p>

    res.render('signup', {
        message: req.flash('message'),
    });

app.post('/signup', passport.authenticate('signup', {
    successRedirect: '/signup-complete',
    failureRedirect: '/signup', // need to pass the entered values (if any) back to the signup page
    failureFlash : true
}));

"24990637","1","24990821","","2014-07-28 07:46:15","","5","211","<p>I'm having a really weird issue with depth testing here.
I'm rendering a simple mesh in an OpenGL 3.3 core profile context on Windows, with depth testing enabled and glDepthFunc set to GL_LESS. On my machine (a laptop with a nVidia Geforce GTX 660M), everything is working as expected, the depth test is working, this is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1boXS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, if I run the program on a different PC, a tower with a Radeon R9 280, it looks more like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JAJX1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Strange enough, the really weird thing is that when I call glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST) every frame before drawing, the result is correct on both machines.
As it's working when I do that, I figure the depth buffer is correctly created on both machines, it just seems that the depth test is somehow being disabled before rendering when I enable it only once at initialization.
Here's the minimum code that could somehow be part of the problem:</p>

<p>Code called at initialization, after a context is created and made current:</p>

<pre><code>glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
glDepthFunc(GL_LESS);
</code></pre>

<p>Code called every frame before the buffer swap:</p>

<pre><code>glClearColor(0.4f, 0.6f, 0.8f, 1.0f);
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

// mShaderProgram-&gt;getID() simply returns the handle of a simple shader program
glUseProgram(mShaderProgram-&gt;getID());  

glm::vec3 myColor = glm::vec3(0.7f, 0.5f, 0.4f);
GLuint colorLocation = glGetUniformLocation(mShaderProgram-&gt;getID(), ""uColor"");
glUniform3fv(colorLocation, 1, glm::value_ptr(myColor));

glm::mat4 modelMatrix = glm::mat4(1.0f);
glm::mat4 viewMatrix = glm::lookAt(glm::vec3(0.0f, 3.0f, 5.0f), glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));
glm::mat4 projectionMatrix = glm::perspectiveFov(60.0f, (float)mWindow-&gt;getProperties().width, (float)mWindow-&gt;getProperties().height, 1.0f, 100.0f);
glm::mat4 inverseTransposeMVMatrix = glm::inverseTranspose(viewMatrix*modelMatrix);

GLuint mMatrixLocation = glGetUniformLocation(mShaderProgram-&gt;getID(), ""uModelMatrix"");
GLuint vMatrixLocation = glGetUniformLocation(mShaderProgram-&gt;getID(), ""uViewMatrix"");
GLuint pMatrixLocation = glGetUniformLocation(mShaderProgram-&gt;getID(), ""uProjectionMatrix"");
GLuint itmvMatrixLocation = glGetUniformLocation(mShaderProgram-&gt;getID(), ""uInverseTransposeMVMatrix"");

glUniformMatrix4fv(mMatrixLocation, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(modelMatrix));
glUniformMatrix4fv(vMatrixLocation, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(viewMatrix));
glUniformMatrix4fv(pMatrixLocation, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(projectionMatrix));
glUniformMatrix4fv(itmvMatrixLocation, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(inverseTransposeMVMatrix));

// Similiar to the shader program, mMesh.gl_vaoID is simply the handle of a vertex array object
glBindVertexArray(mMesh.gl_vaoID);

glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, mMesh.faces.size()*3);
</code></pre>

<p>With the above code, I'll get the wrong output on the Radeon.
Note: I'm using GLFW3 for context creation and GLEW for the function pointers (and obviously GLM for the math).
The vertex array object contains three attribute array buffers, for positions, uv coordinates and normals. Each of these should be correctly configured and send to the shaders, as everything is working fine when enabling the depth test every frame. </p>

<p>I should also mention that the Radeon machine runs Windows 8 while the nVidia machine runs Windows 7.</p>

<p>Edit: By request, here's the code used to load the mesh and create the attribute data. I do not create any element buffer objects as I am not using element draw calls.</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; positionData;
std::vector&lt;glm::vec2&gt; uvData;

<p>Update 1:</p>

<pre><code>""adfadf"".kind_of?(String) #=&gt; true
123.kind_of?(String)      #=&gt; false

# The ""Fixnum"" class is actually used for integers

<p>The above will not work for me as the kind_of? function will find the type of the object where as for me the answer requires to be like this:</p>

<pre><code>check_if_correct_type(""integer"", ""1221"") #=&gt; true
check_if_correct_type(""float"", ""1.24"") #=&gt; true
check_if_correct_type(""string"", ""asds12"") #=&gt; true

<p>where as</p>

<p>""1.24"".kind_of?(Float) #=> false</p>

<p>That is why conversion works for me. Hope the question is more clear now.</p>

<p><strong>Update on No-Compile Pages:</strong> </p>

<p>No-compile pages
In ASP.NET 2.0, the compilation model has been significantly refactored and extended. Site precompilation is perhaps the most popular and loudly requested of the new features. Another quite interesting feature is no-compile pages. They are special pages that just never get compiled. So what’s the ultimate purpose of no-compile pages, and what’s the difference between them and static HTML pages? 
To start off, you create a no-compile page by setting the CompilationMode attribute on the @Page directive to Never. When a no-compile page is requested, no page assembly is created and persisted to disk. Instead, an instance of the page builder component is cached in memory and used to create the page output for each and every request. The page builder is a special component that supports the page parser in building the page control tree. When compilation is turned on, the control tree is used to obtain a class to compile. When compilation is off, the control tree is used to obtain markup. Needless to say, classes are necessary if you want to give programmers the power of attaching their own code to the page. No-compile pages are made of server controls and literals but contain no code at all. </p>

<p>No-compile pages are not for every application. They are exclusively designed for improving the scalability on very large web sites with thousands of pages. No-compile pages can’t be bound to a code file and can’t contain a server-side  block. The only executable piece of code allowed in a no-compile page are $-expressions. There are two main benefits out of no-compile pages. In a secure environment like SharePoint, no-compile pages prevent developers from writing potentially buggy code that can cause problems to the hosting environment and even tear it down. In a large content-based web site, no-compile pages avoid the need to compile thousands of pages. </p>

It all works fine when I am in my main activity, however, when the device is locked it only vibrates once and then stops. Here is a sample of my code Service code</p>

<pre><code>public class VService extends Service { 

@Override
public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
    getV();
    return START_STICKY;
}

public class getV() {
    if (value &gt; 10) {
        Intent alarmIntent = new Intent(getBaseContext(), Alarm.class);
        alarmIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);                                     
        alarmIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT):    
        alarmIntent.putExtra(""v"", value);
        getApplication().startActivity(alarmIntent);
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The logic to my Alarm class is as follows...
OnCreate starts the vibration using</p>

<pre><code>vib = (Vibrator) getSystemService(Context.VIBRATOR_SERVICE); long[]
pattern = {0, 100, 1000}; vib.vibrate(pattern, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>OnDestory stops the vib using vib.cancel(); 
The only other places vib.cancel() is called is in the handler checking if v is less than 10, but this can't be the reason because I haven't made the v less than 10. vib.cancel();  is also called with a button press.</p>

<p>Areas I've looked at- This only happens when the screen is off, so maybe it has something to do with my onCreate where I do the wakelock release? </p>

<pre><code>Runnable releaseWakelock = new Runnable() {

        @Override
        public void run() {
            getWindow().clearFlags(
                    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON);
            getWindow().clearFlags(
                    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON);
            getWindow().clearFlags(
                    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED);
            getWindow().clearFlags(
                    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD);

            if (mWakeLock != null &amp;&amp; mWakeLock.isHeld()) {
                mWakeLock.release();
            }
        }
    };
</code></pre>

<p>Or my on resume which basically calls the same thing but uses a power service to turn on the screen. </p>

<p>So my question is, why does my vibrator only vibrate once when the AlarmClass is launched while the screen is off, but works perfectly fine when the screen is on? I've been trying to figure this out, thanks for any input or help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The runnable gets executed in onCreate of the Alarm class. The following is executed in the onResume class.</p>

<pre><code>getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON);
    getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON);
    getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED);

    // Acquire wakelock

<p>Everything currently works as intended however I have found myself having to use several MySQL queries in order to retrieve the data required.  And even worse the query for the 'replies' is within a foreach loop.  Meaning that although it performs admirably for now, it is far from optimal and will cause problems as the dataset grows.</p>

<p>Therefore I wish to solve this before I go any deeper into development.</p>

<p>Since the tables for the app share the same as the wordpress blog for the site I am using the wordpress shorthand for the queries.</p>

<p>The current way the page is generated is as follows:</p>

<p>A comments table is queried and all results relating to a projectid are retrieved:-</p>

<pre><code>    $commentquery = ""select projects_comments.*, users.user_url, users.display_name
                 from "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""projects_comments projects_comments
                 left join "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""users users on users.ID=projects_comments.userid
                where projectid = '$projectid'
                order by projects_comments.commentid desc
                "";  

$comments = $wpdb-&gt;get_results($commentquery);
</code></pre>

<p>I then perform a foreach loop as below:-</p>

<pre><code>   if($comments) {
            foreach ( $comments as $c ) 
                { 


                $replyquery = ""select project_replies.*, users.user_url, users.display_name

                 from "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""project_replies project_replies
                 left join "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""users users on users.ID=project_replies.uid
                where project_replies.cid = '$c-&gt;commentid' 
                order by project_replies.id desc        
                limit 2         
                "";      

                $replies = $wpdb-&gt;get_results($replyquery);

                asort($replies);

                $countquery = ""select count(*)

                    from "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""project_replies project_replies
                    where project_replies.cid='"".$c-&gt;commentid.""'
                    "";

                $replycount = $wpdb-&gt;get_var($countquery);  

    //generate html here
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside this loop is two further queries.  The first gets the replies for each comment but limits the results to 2 (I wish to do this in order to have a ""see all replies"" button which then queries the DB for the rest if the user requires them), the second query counts the total number of replies.</p>

<p>The html is then also generated for each reply within the loop using a second nested foreach within the above loop (where it says generate html code here) as below:-</p>

<pre><code>if ($replies){

    foreach ( $replies as $r ){

     // generate each reply
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All data is pulled from these arrays in the following manner:</p>

<pre><code>$c-&gt;userid, $c-&gt;body etc... For the comments
$r-&gt;userid, $r-&gt;body etc... For the replies.
</code></pre>

<p>I wish to keep this format if at all possible.</p>

<p>So as stated at the beginning of the question, this all works perfectly however I am aware that by nesting the reply and count queries I am performing many more queries than necessary.  100 comments will generate 100 replies queries and 100 count replies queries etc.</p>

<p>Thanks to some helpful people on this site I have considered using a join to get all the original data in one go for the comments and replies. Like so...</p>

<pre><code>$commentquery2 = ""SELECT c.commentid, c.userid, c.body as cbody, c.projectid, c.posttime, cu.user_url AS cu_url, cu.display_name AS cu_name,
                    r.*, ru.user_url AS ru_url, ru.display_name AS ru_name
                FROM "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""projects_comments AS c
                LEFT JOIN "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""users        AS cu ON cu.ID = c.userid
                LEFT JOIN "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""project_replies   AS r  ON r.cid = c.commentid 
                LEFT JOIN "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""users        AS ru ON ru.ID = r.uid
                WHERE c.projectid = $projectid
                ORDER BY c.commentid DESC, r.id DESC"";   
</code></pre>

<p>Although this does indeed work (and was enough for me to mark that question as answered), when putting it into practice I have had several difficulties.</p>

<p>Firstly this retrieves all data as separate rows meaning that if I have 5 comments each with 3 replies, I actually get 15 rows returned and not a nested data object with the replies being nested within each comment row.</p>

<p>To tackle this I have tried some array manipulation as shown:</p>

<pre><code>$old_id=NULL;
$comments=array();

foreach($getcomments as $c){

    if($c-&gt;commentid !== $old_id){

        $comments[$old_id] = $c;
        $old_id = $c-&gt;commentid;

    }


    $comments[$old_id]['replies'][] = $c;


} 
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this gives me a nested data object as required.  However it does not include the reply counting query and it does not limit each set of replies to 2 as intended, it retrieves all of them.</p>

<p>And finally with my current html generation code within the foreach loops:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($comments){

    //generate comment html

    foreach($replies) {

         //generate replies html

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot seem to get it to work correctly with the nested data object.  Accessing the correct deep replies seems to have me baffled.</p>

<p>So to summarise, I wish to be able to remove the looped queries, combine them into one large and more efficient query or at worst in to a data query and a separate counting query, then create a neatly nested data object, with the comments as rows and any replies nested within under the heading 'replies'</p>

<p>Then I need to be able to iterate through these correctly within my php code in order to generate the required html.</p>

<p>I apologise for the length of this question and realise it may well put many of you off answering,  But I have been battling with this for 19 hours straight now and really need the help.</p>

<p>Many thanks to anyone who offers any suggestions.</p>

<p>I solved the problem, thanks all for your time.</p>

<p>First of all, these are the requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>The comparison <strong>MUST</strong> be within variables. (Compare 2 variables contain unicode)</li>
<li>The version of Python <strong>MUST</strong> be 2.x , I know version 3 has solved this problem, but unfortunately it won't work with me.</li>
</ol>

<p>So hello, I have a bot coded with python, and I would like to make it compare 2 non-English letters (unicode).</p>

<p>The problem I have is, the letters MUST be within variables, so I can't use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>u'letter'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both letters I would like to compare <strong>MUST</strong> be within variables.</p>

<p>I have tried:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>letter1 == letter2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it's showing this error:
    E:\bots\KiDo\KiDo.py:23: UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed to convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them as being unequal
  import sys</p>

<p>and always returns False even the 2 letters are the same.
<strong>So I guess it means I'm comparing 2 unicode letters.</strong></p>

<p>And tried:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>letter = unicode(letter)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but it shows this error:</p>

<pre><code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd9 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<p>I have searched all over Google, but all I could find is using u' ', but this won't work with the variables.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Comparison Code:</p>

<pre><code>word1 = parameters.split()[0]
word2 = parameters.split()[1]
word3 = parameters.split()[2]
word4 = parameters.split()[3]
word5 = parameters.split()[4]
if word1[0] == letter:
    if word2[0] == letter:
        if word3[0] == letter:
            if word4[0] == letter:
                if word5[0] == letter:

<pre><code>   ...

          Use long-term credentials mechanism (this one you need for WebRTC usage).  This option can be used with
          either flat file user database or PostgreSQL DB or MySQL DB or MongoDB or Redis for user keys storage.

   ...
</code></pre>

<p>This client code example also suggests that credentials are required for TURN:</p>

<pre><code>// use google's ice servers
var iceServers = [
  { url: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }
  // { url: 'turn:192.158.29.39:3478?transport=udp',
  //   credential: 'JZEOEt2V3Qb0y27GRntt2u2PAYA=',

  //   username: '28224511:1379330808'
  // }
];
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Are they always required?  (Coturn can be run without any auth mechanism, but it isn't clear from the man page whether it's strictly <strong>required</strong> for WebRTC to work)</li>
<li>If required, can I just create one set of credentials and use that for all clients? (The client code example is obviously just for demonstration, but it seems to suggest that you might hard-code the credentials into the clientside code.  If this is not possible/recommendable, what would be the recommended way of passing out appropriate credentials to the clientside code?)</li>

<p>So I'd love to use jQuery or some other js library to dynamically add the form elements to be held in an array and have the list of things being added by the user display as they add them.

<p>Why isn't sort working as I expect? Note that the complexity of the transform is due the more complex XML and XSL which has been simplified for this example.</p>

<p>If it matters, the transformation is done in C#</p>

<pre><code>System.Xml.XmlDocument doc = new System.Xml.XmlDocument();
doc.Load(Server.MapPath(""Xml/simple.xml""));
System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform trans = new System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform();
trans.Load(Server.MapPath(""Xml/simple.xsl""));
Xml1.Document = doc;
Xml1.Transform = trans;

I've been using Wireshark to look at the structure, but I'm stuck. I've been using <a href=""http://www.ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-users/200311/msg00001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This</a> as a reference.</p>

<p>Most of the H.225 packets I see are user information type with an empty message body and the actual information apparently shows up as a list of NonStandardControls in Wireshark. I thought I'd just extract  out these controls and parse them later, but I don't really know where they start.</p>

<p>In almost all cases, the items start at the 10th byte of the H.225 data. Each item appears to begin with the length which is recorded as 2 bytes. However, I am getting a packet that has items starting at the 11th byte.</p>

<p>The only difference I see in this packet is something in the message body supposedly called open type length which has a value of 1, whereas the rest all appear to be 0. Would the items start at 10 + open type length? Is there some document that explains what this open type length is for?</p>

<p>Long story short the reason i need to post this to <a href=""http://images.google.com/searchbyimage/upload"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/searchbyimage/upload</a> is because i need to retrieve the tbs:sbi=xxx
returned by the post; this ""image fingerprint/encoded image"" (which is not a base64 encoded image) is a parameter for a later post
that will need to be done to retrieve the image results (again programatically)</p>

n is the number of numbers we have in the array.</p>

<p>The array is like stairs, and the user just needs to enter N numbers. We don't need to check if it's a valid number.</p>

<p>The numbers will be shown in array like this:</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>2   3</p>

<p>4   5    6</p>

<p>7   8    9    10</p>

<p>In every row there is one more number.</p>

<p>You need to get the biggest sum path possible, starting from first or last row.
At each iteration you can move only one step down, or one step diagonally down and left / down and right.</p>

<p>That means that if you start from the first row, you can go to 2 or 3. Let's say you go for 2; now you can go only for 4 or 5. If you choose 5, you can go just to 7 or 8 or 9. Or if you want you can go to 1 > 3 > 6 > 8. But you cannot go to 1 > 2 > 6 > 10 because 2 isn't connected with 6.</p>

<p>You also can select only one number in a row. You can't go 1 > 2 > 3 > 6 > 8 > 9 > 10 or something like that.</p>

<p>We can also change the value of a cell, but the path must be the same. That means that I can change, for example, 9 to be 50, but it won't be good because it was not a good path in the original array. (The max sum path in this array 1 > 3 > 6 > 10, so i cant go to different cells)</p>

<p>My problem is that I need this code to run with efficiency of O(n).</p>

<p>I tried to go from the last line and check every valid path that it can go, I tried to go all ways for the biggest number in each possibility. The first one isn't O(n) efficiency and the second one can get the wrong answer.</p>

<p>I also tried to do it from the first row and to scan and compare all the steps, but again it's not O(n) efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Just to make sure, I'm not requesting anyone to write the code for me, just to help me figure out what is the best way to calculate it.</strong></p>

<p>BTW, saw few comments and wanted to add that at the end, I need to print the maximum path sum, but not the path itself.</p>

<p><strong>Long</strong>:</p>

<p>I'm considering exposing a method for enabling batch, atomic updates to my collection of resources. Example:</p>

<pre><code>PATCH /url/myresources
[
    {
        ""op"": ""add"",
        ""path"": ""/1"",  // ID if the individual resource
        ""value"": 
        {
            ... full resource representation ...
        }
    },
    {
        ""op"": ""remove"",
        ""path"": ""/2""
    },
    {
        ""op"": ""replace"",
        ""path"": ""/3/name"",
        ""value"": ""New name""
    }
]
</code></pre>

<p>The context is a public API of a commercial solution. The benefits of allowing such PATCHes is the atomicity as well as batch-friendliness without spamming requests, handling failures individually etc.</p>

<p>I've consulted <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902</a> and <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789</a> but couldn't find a definitive answer if this is compliant. The RFCs mostly refer to ""a resource"", but a collection of resources could also be treated as such.</p>

<p>This prints only 2 not other values.</p>

<p>Some suggestions?</p>

It works well, with one exception.  If the program errors out anywhere within the Qt main event loop, including within my own code, no error information is output to the PyDev console.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this I created the following simple PyQt app:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
from PyQt5 import uic
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication

# test.ui contains a single Push Button named pushButton
base, form = uic.loadUiType(""../ui/test.ui"") 

class MainWindow(base, form):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super(base, self).__init__(parent)
        self.setupUi(self)
        self.pushButton.clicked.connect(self.button_pressed)

    def button_pressed(self):
        print('button pressed')
        print(invalid_variable) # intentional error
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    app.setStyle(""fusion"")
    main_window = MainWindow()
    main_window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
</code></pre>

<p>If I place an intentional error such as <code>print(invalid_variable)</code> anywhere after <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> and before the <code>app.exec_()</code> command, the program properly terminates with a traceback and the expected <code>NameError: name 'invalid_variable' is not defined</code>.  However, if I press the button in my dialog using the above code, <code>button pressed</code> appears on the console but then the application terminates silently and with no error information in the console.  Other debugging operations, such as breakpoints and expressions, work fine.</p>

<p>Is this expected behavior?  If so, what do you recommend for facilitating debugging of PyQt apps in this environment.  If not, I'd appreciate insight into what I need to do to rectify the problem.</p>

<ul>
<li>Python version: python-3.4.3.amd64 </li>
<li>PyDev version: PyDev for Eclipse 4.3.0.201508182223 </li>
<li>PyQt version: PyQt5-5.5-gpl-Py3.4-Qt5.5.0-x64</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Update <strong>2015-09-30</strong>:</p>

<p>When I run the test app directly with python.exe, it outputs the error correctly to <strong>stderr</strong> in both error scenarios.  So this issue does seem specific to the PyDev environment.  I additionally created an entirely fresh Eclipse workspace with only the Python interpreter configured and ran my test again on a freshly created PyDev project using the same source code.  The results were the same.</p>

"19802000","1","","","2013-11-06 00:48:10","","1","143","<p>I have a question/concern regarding implementation styles used by some Java frameworks. </p>

<p>First, as a general background, I know from hands-on that creating arrays of Objects are way much more expensive than creating raw/primitive array types. For example, if you ask some layer below for a large chunk of character data, the most efficient choice is using types like char[], byte[], ByteArray, rather than inventing wrapper data-types and returning array of objects.</p>

<p>However, I have seen frameworks out there which seem to implement their own data types, and expect arrays of those types to be passed back and forth. This incurs all of the mentioned performance and cost issues, and is really inconvenient due to the conversion code overhead. </p>

<p>For example, consider the types defined in sblim client's javax.cim package:</p>

<p><a href=""http://sblim.sourceforge.net/cim-client2-v22-doc/javax/cim/package-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sblim.sourceforge.net/cim-client2-v22-doc/javax/cim/package-summary.html</a></p>

<p>There's one type named UnsignedInteger8 which is basically a byte. There are other types which would also have equivalent efficient primitive types. There's a comment about DMTF data types which seem to indicate they are encapsulating the different data-types in Java classes in order to comply with the protocol, but at which cost?</p>

<p>So, to get to the point, I want to know if someone more experienced with Java performance and framework design in general can provide some feedback on whether sblim client is an efficient implementation or not. Is there a rationale or justification for using this wrapper types like UnsignedInteger8 when they could simply have used a byte or char? Do creating standardized and uniform code for handling all DMTF data types justify the lack in performance that implies using array of objects instead of primitive types? Am I getting the point right or wrong here?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>To further show my point, consider this excerpt:</p>

<pre><code>static StringBuilder convertToText (UnsignedInteger8[] u8arr) {
    if (u8arr== null) return null;
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(u8arr.length);
    for (UnsignedInteger8 u8 : u8arr) {
               sb.append((char)u8.shortValue());
    }
    return sb;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would have to use code like that to map a chunk of character data to a StringBuilder. This is really inefficient, as the data is already loaded in-memory by CIM. Why should I need to create a new StringBuilder and iterate/copy over all data again? Why can't CIM client just provide a String, byte[], char[], or ByteBuffer? I believe this is very inefficient and I would like to understand why in this world would they implemented it this way.</p>

<p>I understand the advantages of abstracting data types and using facilities provided by Java, such as Comparable, Equals, the Collections API, and so forth. This makes sense and I believe is worth using for complex structured data, such as Person, Account, Transaction, etc. but not for raw/primitive data types. It is just too much.</p>

<p>What happens is that <em>most</em> of the time the getpeername and getsockopt report correctly (see the IPTABLE config below).</p>

<p>Unfortunately <em>occasionally</em> get getsockopt report is the same as getpeername, i.e., the destination is the same as the peer.</p>

I understand that array's access time is faster than a linked list.  <code>O(1)- array</code> vs <code>O(N) -linked list</code><br>
But a linked list beats an array in removing an element since there is no shifting needing <code>O(N)- array</code> vs <code>O(1) -linked list</code><br>
So my understanding is that if the majority of operations on the data is delete then using a linked list is preferable.<br>
But if the use case is:  </p>

<ul>
<li>delete elements but not too frequently</li>
<li>access <strong>ALL</strong> elements   </li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a clear winner? In a general case I understand that the downside of using the list is that I access each node which could be on a separate page while an array has better locality.<br>
But is this a theoretical or an actual concern that I should have?<br>

My objective is to update a world map given changing values over time. I am doing a choropleth map.
Right now i have a python script which generates random values. For example if i want to plot the density of USA, i generate some random values for the traffic density for different states and generate a geojson every minute.
Then my front end script calls the geojson every >1 min and updates the map. Here is the function i call in ajax: </p>

<pre><code>function executeQuery() {
        $.ajax({
            type: ""POST"",
            url: ""js/geo-js/all.js"",
            dataType: 'script',
            success: function (response) {
                    geojson = L.geoJson(statesData, {style: style, onEachFeature: onEachFeature});
                    map.removeLayer(geojson)
                    geojson.addTo(map);
            }
        });
        setTimeout(executeQuery, 10000);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>However as my data set grows the browser is becoming more sluggish. I know my solution is terribly inefficient.
So is there a better way of updating the geojson data for the geojson layer in my map?</p>

<p>Thank you so much</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The full path must be less than 260 characters long; other restrictions apply. If the report server is in native mode, the path must start with slash. (rsInvalidItemPath)</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel there could be a couple of places where i'm doing something wrong.  The first is that i might not be using the correct url to connect to SSRS.  In the example project provided on github the url was /TestReports/TestReport.  However, in a browser for my report the url looks like this:
<a href=""http://localhost/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?%2fTPSReports%2fTPSReport1&amp;rs:Command=Render"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?%2fTPSReports%2fTPSReport1&amp;rs:Command=Render</a>  Or i could also use:
<a href=""http://localhost/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fTPSReports%2fTPSReport1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fTPSReports%2fTPSReport1</a></p>

<p>I have installed the nuget package and it created a MvcReportViewer.aspx page in my project along with an error page, .js file, and MvcReportViewer reference.  I have tried the following from the report View to open a SSRS report:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.MvcReportViewer( ""localhost%2fReports%2fPages%2fReport.aspx?ItemPath=%2fTPSReports%2fTPSReport1"",
        new { Height = 900, Width = 900, style = ""border: none"" })
</code></pre>

<p>In the example the url was simply /TestReports/TestReport so i also tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>/Reports/TPSReport1</li>
<li>/Reports/Pages/TPSReports/TPSReport1</li>
<li>/Pages/TPSReports/TPSReport1</li>
</ul>

<p>The SSRS is configured as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web Service URL Virtual Directory = ReportServer</li>
<li>Report Manager URL Virtual Directory = Reports</li>
<li>Service Account = ReportServer</li>
<li>Database Credentials use the ReportServer </li>
</ul>

<p>I have also tried to download the report in a controller like this:</p>

<pre><code>using MvcReportViewer;
private ActionResult DownloadTPSReport(ReportFormat format, string reportName)
    {
        return this.Report(
            format,
            reportName);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The reportName variable is the url.  I tried all of the same ones as mentioned above.</p>

<p>I'm hoping someone can help point me in the right direction.  I think the error message is misleading because the url is definitely less than 260 characters.</p>

<ul>

<li>Do i need to do anything in IIS?</li>
<li>How can i determine what the real error is?</li>

This is a modified version of ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24027245/mvc-any-version-pass-nested-complex-json-object-to-controllers"">MVC (Any Version) - Pass Nested Complex JSON object to Controllers</a>"", which also has not been answered.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is it possible to post a JSON data through jQuery ajax call to a MVC Controller where the data you are passing is a complex type with more complex types in it? Example an array of arrays.</p>

<pre><code>var arrayOfarrays = [];
var simpleArray = [];

simpleArray[simpleArray.length] = simpleArray.length + 1;
simpleArray[simpleArray.length] = simpleArray.length + 1;
simpleArray[simpleArray.length] = simpleArray.length + 1;
simpleArray[simpleArray.length] = simpleArray.length + 1;
simpleArray[simpleArray.length] = simpleArray.length + 1;

arrayOfarrays[arrayOfarrays.length] = simpleArray;
arrayOfarrays[arrayOfarrays.length] = simpleArray;
arrayOfarrays[arrayOfarrays.length] = simpleArray;
arrayOfarrays[arrayOfarrays.length] = simpleArray;
arrayOfarrays[arrayOfarrays.length] = simpleArray;
</code></pre>

<p>The above is my data. As you see, a <code>simpleArray</code> is a mere array and the <code>arrayOfarrays</code> is an array of arrays which is in a way a nested complex type</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: '/Home/Save',
    data: {arrayData:simpleArray, arrayOfarrayData:arrayOfarrays},
    type: 'POST',
    dataType: 'json',
    traditional:true,
    cache: false,
    success: function (result) {
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above snippet is my jQuery ajax call to the controller <code>/Home/Save</code> and here below is the controller itself. Note that I have tried with and without the <code>traditional:true</code> option.</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
public JsonResult Save(int[] arrayData, int[][] arrayOfarrayData)
{
    return Json(""received"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I've observed:</p>

<ul>
<li>With <code>traditional:true</code> I receive the <code>arrayData</code> which is a simple array in the <code>/Home/Save</code> controller but the <code>arrayOfarrayData</code> is empty</li>
<li>Without <code>traditional:true</code> I receive <code>arrayData</code> as <code>null</code> but <code>arrayOfarrayData</code> is received as an array of 5 elements but the elements are not the sub-array information you would expect but its empty</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> An array of array is only an example, no NESTED complex type seem to work. Or is there any way around this?</p>

<p>The code in question reads:</p>

<pre><code>Dim serviceArray = New SecurityLayer.Model.Service()
serviceArray = new SecurityLayer.SecurityBusinessController.GetServices(userId)

<p>Which compiles in VS2005/.NET2.0 but fails in VS2008/.NET3.5 with the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Value of type '1-dimensional array of SecurityLayer.Model.Service' cannot be converted to 'SecurityLayer.Model.Service'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This indicates that serviceArray is not declared as an array and Reading the MSDN documentation it does not look like the syntax has changed between the versions but it states that curly braces are required whether any values are being passed in or not. Sure enough, adding curly braces to it's declaration resolves the problem (and the compiler moves onto the next instance!). </p>

<pre><code>Dim serviceArray = New SecurityLayer.Model.Service(){}
serviceArray = new SecurityLayer.SecurityBusinessController.GetServices(userId)

<p>After updating all of the instances of this declaration the code now builds and runs as expected.</p>

<p>Option Explicit and Option Strict are the same in both IDEs so it can't be that (or at least that's what I'm assuming).</p>

<p>The index.php expects to be given a GET variable <code>SITE</code> to tell it which site to display. It also uses the REQUEST_URI to determine which content to display. In order for this to work, the <em>alpha</em> or <em>beta</em> need to be removed from the original request. This is where I am stuck.</p>

<p>So the REQUEST_URI starts at /alpha/content/file and needs to become /content/file.</p>

<p>Now let's pretend that a customer has placed an order. In a session bean (e.g. inside <code>OrderSB.placeOrder</code>) I have opened a transaction, saved an Order in the DB, and now I am making a call to the payment provider's WS API. It returns successfully (and I assume that by now my customer's account has been debited) but before I can save the Order's associated Payment (there's one-to-one relationship between Order and Payment) an exception occurs and my transaction is rolled back.</p>

<p>How is it possible to ensure that when such an exception happens, my customer's account is not debited? Or in other words either both of the WS call and <code>OrderSB.placeOrder</code> should complete successfully and commit or both of them should be rolled back together.</p>

<p>It's easy to roll back <code>placeOrder</code> if the WS call fails, but I don't know how I can roll back the WS call after it returns.</p>

<p>But I've tried to use this method (albeit on some other function), but it seems to take a longer time to run than an explicit for loop.</p>

<pre><code>def with_loop(a, b):
    for x in xrange(1, b):
        if x * a % b == 1: return True
    return False

def with_generator(a, b):
    return any(x * a % b == 1 for x in xrange(1, b))
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the code loops through all the numbers from 1 to <em>b</em> to find whether the number <em>a</em> has a modular inverse.</p>

<p>The times I got from running the functions are:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from timeit import Timer as T
&gt;&gt;&gt; T(lambda : with_generator(100, 300)).repeat(number = 100000)

</code></pre>

<p>with_generator(100,300) returns False and with_generator(101,300) returns True.</p>

<p>It seems that with_generator always takes a longer time to run than with_loop. Is there any reason for this?</p>

Is there any other shorter or more elegant way of rewriting with_loop so that we achieve similar or better performance? Thanks!</p>

    acceptNewTaskButton = new   JButton(actionManager.getNewTaskAction(dialog,dateChooser,textField));

<pre><code>okbutton = new AcceptNewTaskButton(dialog,datechooser,newTaskName);

<p>the button is created but it doesn´t perform any action.</p>

<p>And i type this</p>

<pre><code>okButton = new AcceptNewTaskButton().AcceptNewTaskButton(dialog,dateChooser,newTaskName);

<p>The action is perfectly performed.</p>

<p>I would like to know why this is happening, i think it is something simple but i can´t see it. I would like to do it this way because i want to have a class of every button in a package called buttons, and in this way make my code more ""object oriented""</p>

Does anybody have a clue on what I might be doing wrong?</p>

<p>Currently, I'm doing the following on my NSTextView's textDidChange delegate method:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)textDidChange:(NSNotification *)notification {

    // saving the cursor position
    NSInteger insertionPoint = [[[self.mainTextView selectedRanges] objectAtIndex:0] rangeValue].location;

    // this grabs the text view's contact as plain text
    [self updateContentFromTextView];

    // this creates an attributed strings and displays it
    [self updateTextViewFromContent];

    // resetting the cursor position
    self.mainTextView.selectedRange = NSMakeRange(insertionPoint, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>While this mostly works, it's not ideal. The text seems to blink for a split second (you especially notice it on the red dots under spelling errors), and when the cursor was previously near one of the edges of the visible rect, it the scroll position gets reset. In my case, this is a very much undesirable side-effect.</p>

<p>So my question is: Is there a better way of doing what I'm trying to do?</p>

If it returns a 404 error then that definitely shouldn't validate. If there is a redirect...I'm open to suggestions, sometimes redirects go to an error page or homepage, sometimes they go to the page you were looking for, so I don't know. Perhaps for a redirect there could be a special notice that suggests the destination address to the user.</p>

<p>The best thing I found so far was like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({url: webpage ,type:'HEAD',error:function(){
    alert('No go.');
}});

<p>That has no problem with 404's and 200's but if you do something like <code>'http://xyz'</code> for the url it just hangs. Also 302 and the like trigger the error handler too.</p>

<p>I'm trying to refresh a div with content for a certain period. It will fire an Ajax GET call to a php script which render the content. For the first time ajax GET called, the ScrollPane is there, but for the second time Ajax GET(refresh) JScrollPane disappeared. Any how to reinitialize the jscrollpane?</p>

{
  $.ajax({
  url: '../../views/main/activity.php',

  complete: function(){
         $('#activityLineHolder').jScrollPane({

  getActivity(getActivitysTimeoutFunction);
})();

});
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, my scrollpane is there after every Ajax call, but it shows buggy, the jscrollpane will keep moving left after every Ajax Call and slowly, it will hide the content. How is this happened?</p>

<pre><code>    foreach ($list as $notification) {
    echo ""&lt;div class='feeds' id='$notification-&gt;notification_id'&gt;"";
    $userObj = $user-&gt;show($notification-&gt;added_by);

<p>I have tested the code on a desktop app on PC files and it Works perfect, but does not work as an Android app. It worked on my device once but did not work again</p>

<p>1)Add writing on External source Permission in the Mainafest file
2)Select the file right and retrieve it path
3)Read the file content true</p>

<pre><code>        File file = f;

5)Write back (Overwrite) in the original file</p>

<pre><code>        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(f.getAbsolutePath());

It's all working fine the only question is how to add content (a Node in JavaFX) to it?</p>

<p>The <code>PopupWindow.getContent()</code> method is deprecated in JavaFX 2.2.6 and not working with CSS, I am able to see the content but the CSS-selector will not work then.</p>

<p>So what is the best solution to add content myself, should I implement my own Skin class for that purpose or is there a simple way to just make it work?</p>

<p>I have prepared a simple use case:</p>

<pre><code>import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.PopupControl;
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;
import javafx.scene.shape.Rectangle;

public class PopupTest extends PopupControl {
    public PopupTest() {
        getStyleClass().add(""popup""); // not working!?

        StackPane pane = new StackPane();
        pane.getStyleClass().add(""pane"");
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(250, 250);
        rectangle.getStyleClass().add(""rect"");
        Label text = new Label(""popup test"");
        text.getStyleClass().add(""text"");
        pane.getChildren().addAll(rectangle, text);

        // how to display to pane when the popup is shown?
        getContent().addAll(pane);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For completeness here are my MainApplication and CSS file:</p>

<pre><code>import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.event.ActionEvent;
import javafx.event.EventHandler;
import javafx.scene.Group;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class MainApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        Group root = new Group();
        final Scene scene = new Scene(root);
        scene.getStylesheets().add(MainApplication.class.getResource(""style.css"").toExternalForm());

        final Button button = new Button(""show popup"");
        button.setOnAction(new EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;() {
            @Override
            public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
                PopupTest popup = new PopupTest();
                popup.show(scene.getWindow());

            }
        });
        root.getChildren().add(button);

        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}

<p>style.css:</p>

<pre><code>.popup {
    -fx-font-size: 24px;
}

.popup .rect {
    -fx-fill: green;
}

.popup .text {
    -fx-text-fill: white;
    -fx-font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The "".popup"" selector is not working here, if I set it to the ""pane"" it will style the popup window so the css is correct: <code>pane.getStyleClass().add(""popup""); // working with this ""fix""</code>.</p>

But sadly the process would not start. The new processes call an exe with some arguments, which should send an email.
Why does this not work?</p>

<pre><code>~ErrorH()

        Process.Start(mailsend);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I execute the <code>SendErrorMail</code> function for example in the constructor, everything works fine. If I look at the debugger it seems like I reach the <code>Process.Start(mailsend);</code> command.
What went wrong? How could I fix this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Ok now I have used the <code>IDisposable</code> method. It works fine, but does is use it correctly?</p>

<pre><code>class ErrorH : IDisposable
{
private bool disposed = false;
...
public void Dispose()
{
    Dispose(true);
    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
}

protected virtual void Dispose(bool desposing)
{
    if(!this.disposed)
        if ((int)e &gt; 0)
            SendErrorMail();
    disposed = true;
}

<pre><code>using (Parameter p = new Parameter(args[0]))
{

Either they help to find and remove duplicates for a specific column or they remove only from the datatable, not the underlying database itself. I want to delete duplicate rows from table ""table1"" of my mdb file. </p>

<p>To make my requirements clearer:</p>

<ol>
<li>there's no primary key set for any column in the table (and I cant afford to)</li>
<li>I want to delete all duplicate rows but one! (order has no significance)</li>
<li>I prefer deleting the duplicates from database more than first checking if such a row exist or not before updating database itself (if that's the last resort, which cant be, then that's  welcome)</li>
<li><p>by duplicate rows I mean rows that are not distinct. for eg, in the following example,only 3rd and 5th row are duplicates. And I want to delete any of them.</p>

<pre><code>      Name1  Name2    Name3
      tom    dick   harry
      tom    dick   mike
      ann    sara   mike
      sara   ann    mike
      ann    sara   mike
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>The duplicate rows should be deleted from database with a button click as follows</p>

<pre><code>     private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
     {
         deletedupes();
     }

    private void deletedupes()

        DataSet ds = new DataSet();
        OleDbDataAdapter da = new OleDbDataAdapter(""select * from table1"", con);
        con.Open();
        da.Fill(ds, ""table1"");

<p>All calls to the REST service are handled using the Spring RestTemplate class.</p>

<p>I'm looking to implement a progress bar and cancel functionality as the files being uploaded can be quite big.</p>

<p>I've been looking for a way to implement this on the web but have had no luck. </p>

<p>I tried implementing my own ResourceHttpMessageConverter and substituting the writeInternal() method but this method seems to be called during some sort of buffered operation prior to actually posting the request (so the stream is read all in one go before sending takes place).</p>

<p>I've even tried overriding the CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory.createRequest() method and implementing my own RequestEntity class with a special writeRequest() method but the same issue occurs (stream is all read before actually sending the post).</p>

<p>Am I looking in the wrong place? Has anyone done something similar.</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff I've read on the web about implementing progress bars talks about staring the upload off and then using separate AJAX requests to poll the web server for progress which seems like an odd way to go about it.</p>

<p>Any help or tips greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>I then edited the function genWork in the genData file and it now takes 7 arguments. I keep the same import lines in the other script, and use the function as genWork(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). I get the error: </p>

<pre><code>TypeError: genWork() takes exactly 5 arguments (7 given)

<p>So, I am guessing somehow the genData script did not actually update? I tried deleting the .pyc file that got created, but I still get the same error. </p>

After some net research I decided that WMI is my tool. I started with a simple MFC application and for start I wanted to print out the MotherBoard SerialNumber. And just at this point the whole thing crashed. I checked on XP and Win7 and this property is not returned. And this got me thinking - what if there are some classes/properties that won't work on certain windows versions? Or some hardware configurations? I sincerely don't like that. My instant idea for the fingerprint was the MAC address (my application is strictly network driven so if the machine does not have a net connection it is no use at all). However, some machines can have several MAC devices. And some of MACs may be a virtual one's that can vanish from the system after uninstalling (i.e. VPN client). I think that MAC address can be easily changed but if I hashcode the number the user may not figure out that use it. So I ask for your advice - is WMI a good tool for Hardware fingerprint? If it is - which classes/properties would you suggest to use? They should work on all machines and systems and also be safe/unchangeable at the same time (ok we cannot do much if the user changes the whole hardware..) If WMI is not a good solution, than what other C++ framework would you suggest? And following - which HD properties to use then. </p>

Now when I check their local transitivity, I get different outputs.</p>

<p>and my code does only a single query </p>

<pre><code>select * 
from Blah 
where latitude &lt; l1 and latitude &gt; l2   
and longitude &lt; ll1 and longitude &gt; ll2   
and create_time &lt; t1 and create_time &gt; t2 
and owner_id &lt; o1 and owner_id &gt; o2 ;
</code></pre>

<p>(of course the values l1, l2,.... o1,o2 are dynamic params coming from program)</p>

<p>my question is what kind of index I should create; composite index? 
in case of composite index, which column should I put first?
how effective is the index?</p>

<p>I thought about this for a long time, and couldn't find detailed docs on how the oracle index works.</p>

<p>I can find docs that it's implemented using B-tree, in our case:  each key in the B-tree is a 4-tuple: ( column1, column2, column3, column4) where the ordering relation of such tuples are defined to be lexical order.</p>

<p>then for the above query, assuming our order is (owner_id, create_time, latitude, longitude), I guess
oracle would first need to binary search to the point ( o1, t1, l1,ll1),  for this operation, the index is indeed useful.
but next,  we need to find the ending point of this first interium:  we need to find (o1,t1, l1, ll2 ), this can be done by binary search too.</p>

<p>next, we need to find the next section that satisfies the condition, so we need to 
find (o1, t1, lx, ll1 ) where lx is the next value larger than l1, we could find this by binary search too.
but in our case, it's very likely  that for the same latitude, there can be no more than 1 longitude, 
so here binary search is not more effective than linear scan.  </p>

<p>following this spirit, it seems that we should put the column with a small value range cardinality first,
in this case, create_time, if our points are created on only a few days.
also if we never do range conditions, but only equals (=) conditions, then it does not matter which column is first, right?</p>

<p>to make it clearer, here is a simpler example:</p>

<p>let's say I have 2 columns, X, and Y</p>

<p>in the db, values for both are [1,2,....100], so we have 100x100 rows</p>

<p>my query is</p>

<pre><code>select * from mytable where X &gt; 34 and X &lt; 78 and Y &gt; 12 and Y &lt; 15;
</code></pre>

<p>say our index is on (X, Y), so the comparison rule between 2 values are</p>

<pre><code>v1 &lt; v2 &lt;=====&gt;  v1.x &lt; v2.x || v1.x == v2.x &amp;&amp; v1.y &lt; v2.y
</code></pre>

<p>given the above ordering rule, we can see that the values in the index are 
arranged in serial like  (values for x,y):</p>

<pre><code>1,1, 1,2 1,3 .... 1,100     
2,1  2,2 2,3 ......2,100
.....
100,1 100,2 ....... 100,100
</code></pre>

<p>now , to search for the values in the query, the B-Tree traversal needs to 
locate (78-34-1) intervals, hence (78-34-1)*2 lookup (1 for the beginning 
one for the end locations), not just 2 lookups.</p>

<p>so if we have higher dimensions, the interval counts increases exponentially
with the number of dimensions, so indexing may not be useful anymore ------
this is my concern</p>

<p>thanks a lot

<p>I want to attach 1 single row at the top of the table which is not part of my collection.  It's a previously defined <code>LayoutView</code>.</p>

<p>Usually I would just add another region, but because I'm working with a table, I cannot add extra <code>div</code>'s to the <code>tbody</code> as the table will spit it out of the table as its not a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> within a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Below is my attempt at building this in my <code>onShow</code> function of the CompositView:</p>

<pre><code>var SetAllTargets = Backbone.Marionette.LayoutView.extend({
    template: JST[""common/cubes/table/set-all-rows""],
    tagName: ""tr"",
    className: ""set-all-targets""
});


App.Table = Marionette.CompositeView.extend({

    template: JST[""common/targets/layout""],
    className: ""targets"",
    childView: RowTarget,
    childViewContainer: ""tbody"",

    regions: {
        targetsRegion: "".targets-region""
    },

    onShow: function() {
        var setAllTargetsRow = new SetAllTargets();
        var setAllTargetsRegion = ""&lt;tr class='target set-all-targets'&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"";
        this.$el.find(""tbody"").prepend(setAllTargetsRegion);
        this.$el.find("".set-all-targets"").show(setAllTargetsRow);
    }
)};
</code></pre>

<p>Another attempt was to put the </p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr class='target set-all-targets'&gt; ...child elements here &lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>into the template and attach the <code>view.el</code> in my <code>onShow</code> function like this:</p>

<pre><code>    onShow: function() {    
        var setAllTargetsRow = new SetAllTargets();
        this.$el.find(""tbody"").prepend(setAllTargetsRow.el);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But that results in just the html <code>&lt;tr class='target set-all-targets'&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</code> being placed into the top of the table, but none of the child elements.</p>

<p>Now, I've added a class, named Customer. When starting the app, Entity Framework generates the proper tables and mapping and all is well, but then when i attempt to add something to the table (Customer.Add(anEntity)), Entity Framework prompty deletes every single table in the database, leaving me with only the table containing the model hash, and thus can't insert anything.</p>

I've been doing queries to the default Sqlite DB via ActiveRecord, and for most queries, according to the debug output, it seems to generate parameterized queries, like so:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p247 :070 &gt; file.save
   (0.2ms)  begin transaction
   SQL (0.6ms)  UPDATE ""rep_files"" SET ""report_id"" = ?, ""file_name"" = ?, ""updated_at"" = ?
   WHERE ""rep_files"".""id"" = 275  [[""report_id"", 3], [""file_name"", ""hello.jpg""],
   [""updated_at"", Mon, 09 Sep 2013 04:30:19 UTC +00:00]]
   (28.8ms)  commit transaction
</code></pre>

<p>However, whenever I do a query using find_by, it seems to just stick the provided parameters into the generated SQL:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p247 :063 &gt; file = RepFile.find_by(report_id: ""29"", file_name: ""1.png"")
  RepFile Load (6.2ms)  SELECT ""rep_files"".* FROM ""rep_files"" WHERE
  ""rep_files"".""report_id"" = 29 AND ""rep_files"".""file_name"" = '1.png' LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>It does seem to be escaping the parameters properly to prevent SQL injection:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p247 :066 &gt; file = RepFile.find_by(report_id: ""29"", file_name: ""';"")
  RepFile Load (0.3ms)  SELECT ""rep_files"".* FROM ""rep_files"" WHERE
  ""rep_files"".""report_id"" = 29 AND ""rep_files"".""file_name"" = ''';' LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>However, it was my understanding that sending parameterized queries to the database was considered a better option than trying to escape query strings, since the parameterized option will cause the query data to bypass the database's parsing engine entirely.</p>

<p>So what's going on here? Is this some oddity in the Sqlite adapter or the way that the debug output is generated? If ActiveRecord is actually working like this, is there some reason for it? I can't find anything about this anywhere I've looked. I've started looking through the ActiveRecord code, but haven't figured anything out yet.</p>

<p>To solve the route I use a breadth first search algorithm which works ok without any chopper operations, it finds the quickest route approximately and returns the list of travelled nodes.  My biggest issue is how does one represent actions that the chopper does in order to achieve a certain state, and what data structure is best to use for this?  sorry if the code is a mess!

<p>When I use my computer browser, it shows up as it should, as
    <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?q=11.111,22.222"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps?q=11.111,22.222</a></p>

<p>So, i suppose my question is: is there any way to tell the iphone <em>not</em> to prepend ""tel:"" or, I guess I can work around this by telling javascript to start at a number (something i can look up myself). but at the same time, i do not like having the latitude and longitude as links in my phone.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I want to open several tabs with <code>window.open</code>

But Chrome opens them as new windows instead of tabs!</p>

<p>And for some unclear reason I found only information regarding the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/726761/javascript-open-in-a-new-window-not-tab"">opposite.</a>
How can I achive this? </p>

<p>And if at it, how can I invoke programmatic tab openings without Chrome blocking them?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I have seen some posts saying it's not possible and that's it's a browser preference.
First of all, I have no idea how to set that preference!
Secondly, I saw people claiming they did it, so who to believe to?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>
I found out that Chrome opens new windows and not open tabs because it's a JavaScript window opening and not user clicks.
Anyone knows how I can fake a real click?
Because calling the click event still counts as not user clicks</p>

<p>In my FireMonkey Mobile Form I have 4 TEdits named: edt1, edt2, edt3, edt4</p>

<p>First I create List: TStringList</p>

<pre><code>procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
var i: Integer;    
begin
  List := TStringList.Create;
  for i := 1 to 4 do List.Add(IntToStr(i));
end;
</code></pre>

<p>with an obvious structure [1 2 3 4]. Then I delete 2nd Item:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TForm1.btnDeleteItem;
begin
  List.BeginUpdate;
  List.Delete(1);
  List.EndUpdate;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>After this procedure List has structure [1 3 4]. Problems come with the next procedure - here I try to copy data from List to my edits, so edt1 contains List[0], edt2 contains List[1],... Here is code for doing so:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TForm1.HandleEditButtons(Sender: TObject);
var i: Integer;
  aEdt: TEdit;
begin
  for i := 1 to 4 do 
  begin
    aEdt := FindComponent('edt'+IntToStr(i)) as TEdit;
    if (aEdt &lt;&gt; nil) then
      if (i &lt;= List.Count) then aEdt.Text := List[i-1]
        else aEdt.Text := '';
  end; 
end;
</code></pre>

<p>After this procedure, List has structure [1 2 3] so it seems to me, when with procedure btnDeleteItem the last item was from List Deleted. Structures of List, which I present here, was got by using Memo1.Lines.Add(List.Text) between procedures.</p>

<p>Does anyone has any idea, what is happening here?</p>

Think of it like a chessboard.</p>

<p>Since my ItemTemplate consists of a border it doesn't have native support for drag &amp; drop like the GridView or the ListView. I tried using both GridView and ListView for my squares Before but the GUI became too sluggish so I switched to a simple border which made it alot faster.</p>

<p>By hooking up Manipulation events I've still managed to get a drag behavior for my border and its content (at least when it comes to the GUI).
However when I try to drag a square (border) to another square I can't seem to get the drop event to fire. I need to know which the target square is.</p>

<p>I understand that since I'm doing my drag&amp;drop functionality myself I need to do something to hook into the border's drop event, but what?</p>

<p>I've also tried to subscribe to the border events PointerEntered, PointerMoved etc. to find out which square the pointer is over and when the button is released i would know which the target square is. This only seem to work in two directions though (right and down), the Pointer events doesn't seem to fire when moved left or up, strange. I've read somwhere that the items (squares) have different ZIndex and this could affect the firing of events.</p>

<p>I've struggled with this for hours now and would really appreciate some help.</p>

<p>Our WPF client gets the data pushed in from the server. The backend is in C++ and the data gets pushed into our C# model and wired down through the ViewModels up to the DataGrid.  </p>

<p>After a while of inactivity though, I can see that the heap memory and the Large Heap Size keep increasing for no reason. Well the data is pushed in, so maybe this is the reason but after 2 hours and 15 min the unnecessarily increased memory is freed up again, just to go slowly up again.</p>

<p>On the right side of the graph (after over 24 hours), I have loaded even more tabs and more data, hence the massive increase but from then on there is no freeing up of memory anymore. </p>

<p>The Graph is showing that <code>System.Windows.EffectiveValueEntry[]</code> is taking the most memory.  From my understanding this class is related to the WPF dependency objects. But I have no idea what could be causing this.  I am not expecting the memory to go down, as I am not closing anything. But why is it going up like this? </p>

<p>What could be the cause?</p>

I have a simple PHP script running that will verify incoming JSON data against the signature in the header (all in all it is very similar to two-legged OAuth).</p>

<p>The following Obj-C code generates the signature:</p>

<pre><code>const char *cKey = [kConsumerSecret cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
const char *cData = [payload cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

NSLog(@""Payload: %s"", cData);

unsigned char cHMAC[CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];

CCHmac(kCCHmacAlgSHA256, cKey, strlen(cKey), cData, strlen(cData), cHMAC);
NSData *hmac = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:cHMAC length:sizeof(cHMAC)];
NSString *signature = [hmac base64EncodedString];
</code></pre>

<p>And the verifying PHP code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$originalPayload = '{""name"":""Ben’s iPhone""}'; // The message received from iOS
$hash = hash_hmac(""sha256"", $originalPayload, ""Secret Key"", TRUE);
$signature = strtr(base64_encode($hash), array('=' =&gt; '', '+' =&gt; '-', '/' =&gt; '_'));
</code></pre>

<p>The functions work perfectly fine when using ASCII characters. But when they contain UTF-8 characteres iOS calculates the signature based on:</p>

<pre><code>Ben‚Äôs iPhone
</code></pre>

<p>While PHP calculates it based on:</p>

<pre><code>Ben\u2019s iPhone
</code></pre>

<p>Making the signatures invalid. I have tried multiple approaches and none of them have yielded any results. Does anyone have an idea for how to solve this issue?</p>

<p>Remark: Yes, I could simply use OAuth, but I'm just curious on how to implement it myself.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have tracked down the problem to a part in the code, that modifies the parsed JSON array in the PHP code. In order to hash, but not include it in the body, I added the temporary index 'time' that contained a UTC timestamp. That modification of the original array made PHP change the character representation (escaping UTF-8 characters). Just appending the timestamp work fine.</p>

<p>Nonetheless the functions should yield the same result, shouldn't they?</p>

However, I am still not able to find the right authentication and authorization solution for Padrino. Let me explain my expectation and what I have already tried out.</p>

<p>With Sinatra, I successfully use the <a href=""http://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra-authentication"">sinatra-authentication</a> gem along with the <a href=""http://rubygems.org/gems/role_model"">role_model</a> gem. I generally use the Mongoid ORM for talking to MongoDB. These two gems together let me take care of authetication, protecting routes, checking for roles of the logged in user for applying access control.</p>

<p>sinatra-authentication doesn't work with Padrino - it is very specific to Sinatra. I tried it out multiple times. I have already tried out both omniauth and warden with the corresponding Padrino modules but for one reason or another I am not able to get them to work as simply as the wonderful sinatra-autentication gem.</p>

<p>So - before I can attempt implementing a solution of my own (or porting sinatra-authentication to Padrino) - can anyone suggest any other authentication and authorization solutions? At the moment I don't need anythign fancy - simple database-based authentication will just work perfectly.</p>

<p>Now, one of the clients have provided us with read-only access to their svn server, where their developers continually commit their changes.</p>

<p>Internally, our team uses git as our source control system.</p>

<p>So, for now we have successfully setup a Git-Svn mirror (Fetching &amp; Core Repos ) to capture our development process. ( using instructions provided by Thomas Ferris Nicolaisen  at :- <a href=""http://www.tfnico.com/presentations/git-and-subversion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tfnico.com/presentations/git-and-subversion</a> )</p>

<p>Basically, I just need an answer to a simple problem, given that we have only readonly access to the orginal svn repository and cannot use <code>git svn dcommit</code> is there a way I can cleanly &amp; elegantly generate svn patch files for them to integrate with the system?</p>

<p>At the moment it specifies a particular one, thus:</p>

My controller is using WebSocket.acceptWithActor</p>

<pre><code>def clientWS = WebSocket.acceptWithActor[JsValue, JsValue] { _ =&gt;
   upstream =&gt; ClientSesssionActor.props(upstream)
}
</code></pre>

<p>and all is well except some other ""supervisor"" actor needs to be able to use context.actorSelection(...) to communicate with all/some of those ClientSessionActors.</p>

<p>But all my ClientSessionActors are created with a path like this one : </p>

<p><em>[akka://application/system/websockets/ REQ_ID /handler]</em></p>

<p>Here is the line where WebsocketActorSupervisor creates them :</p>

<pre><code>val webSocketActor = context.watch(context.actorOf(createHandler(self), ""handler""))
</code></pre>

<p>That is where the ""<strong>handler</strong>"" part of the path comes from.</p>

<p>I would like to pass in a specific name for my ClientSessionActor instead of getting ""handler"".</p>

<p>Overloading the whole call stack with one more parameter seems inelegant: there is WebSocketActor.scala with Connect, WebSocketActorSupervisor(props and constructor), WebSocketsActor receive and then everything inside the WebSocket.scala.</p>

<p>I know I can pass the supervisor reference to the props, but what about the case when the ""supervisor"" has been restarted and needs to reconnect with his minions. </p>

<p>One more thing, I realize that I might be able to get all the ""handler"" actors, but there are more than 2 kinds of handlers. Yes I could have them ignore msgs directed at the other groups of handlers but this just feels so redundant sending out 3 times more msgs than I should have to.</p>

<p>Any suggestions ?</p>

<p>James ?  :)</p>

<p>I have a custom class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Indicator
{
   public double Value { get; set;}

   virtual public void Calc(val1, val2) {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I have many classes derived from it, such as:</p>

<pre><code>class calc_sum : Indicator
{    
   override public void Calc(val1, val2)
   {
     Value=val1+val2;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I have a class to hold all ""Indicators"":</p>

<pre><code>class IndicatorCollection
{
  List&lt;Indicator&gt; _collection = new List&lt;Indicator&gt;();

  ...Some other methods here...
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I need, is to provide a method in the ""IndicatorCollection"" class which accepts a string based name of a class derived from ""Indicator"" and add it to the _collection.
i.e:</p>

<pre><code>IndicatorCollection.AddIndicator(""calc_sum"");
</code></pre>

<p>That way the user can add indicators at runtime (The IndicatorsCollection is binded to a list which displays the Value property of each member).</p>

<p>I hope I was clear enough and that I am taking the right approach. 
Thank you all</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
The Activator method is exactly what I was looking for, So I'll try to make it more difficult:</p>

<p>After adding the Indicator instance, can IndicatorCollection expose a new Property which is a shortcut to the class's Value property.</p>

<p>i.e:</p>

<pre><code>// After adding calc_sum to the collection, The IndicatorCollection class will have the following //property:
public double calc_sum
{
  get { return _collection.Find(i=&gt;i.name==""calc_sym"").First().Value;
  // The indicator class also has a public member of ""name""
}

<p>I've been looking into Java FX and i find it interesting, although I'm having troubles being content with how I manage to separate the logic from the presentation of my program. </p>

<p><strong>Notice: This <em>might</em> be a possible duplicate</strong><br/>
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10134856/javafx-2-0-how-to-application-getparameters-in-a-controller-java-file?rq=1"">Javafx 2.0 How-to Application.getParameters() in a Controller.java file</a><br/>
However the suggestion in the accepted answer there is to make the variable static, and I do not wish to do that either. </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>All the tutorials I've found has a controller which is supposed to be the connection between the presentation and the logic in good'ol MVC manner. However it's about here that I find myself stumbling, because I wan't to initialize a some stuff, what isn't important in this case, and pass it in to my <strong>Controller</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>Am I supposed to want to pass stuff to my controller or should it be responsible for initializing (either by itself or by instantiating another object which has that responsibility)?</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>I want to pass stuff to my controller in <strong>Java FX</strong>, should I do that or is it a bad practice? If I should pass stuff, how do I do that?</p>

<h2>Some code to clarify:</h2>

<h3>Heres is how I don't want to do:</h3>

<p><strong>The main class</strong></p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(""ChatGUI.fxml""));

    Scene scene = new Scene(root);

    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And the <em>example</em> controller (with comments)</strong></p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb) {
    //Intialize a bunch of stuff here.
    connectionManager = new MyConnectionManager();    
}
</code></pre>

And something like how I would like to do:

<p><strong>The main class</strong></p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(""ChatGUI.fxml""));
    MyConnectionManager connectionManager = new MyConnectionManager();
    root.addConnectionManager(connectionManager);

    Scene scene = new Scene(root);

    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And the <em>example</em> controller (with comments)</strong></p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb) {
    //Intialize a bunch of stuff here.
    connectionManager = new MyConnectionManager();    
}

public void addConnectionManager(ConnectionManager manager) {
    this-&gt;myManager = manager; 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>I want to achieve something similar to the second example above, is this possible or do I have some fundamental missunderstanding of the MVC pattern?</p>

<p>I noticed that, for square matrices it took less time than for rectangular ones.
For example: if I use 4 nodes (one as master) and A is 500x500 and B is 500x500, the number of iterations per node equals 41.5 million, while if A is 2400000x6 and B is 6x6, it iterates 28.8 million times per node. Although the second case takes less iterations, it took about 1.00 second, while the first took only about 0.46s. </p>

<p>Logically, the second should be faster, considering it has less iterations per node.
Doing some math, I realized that the MPI sends and receives 83,000 elements per message on the first case, and 4,800,000 elements on the second. </p>

<p>Does the size of the message justify the delay?</p>

<p>Below is a screen shot. In the second field I am grabbing something with javascript. In the first field I am binding the field to the data source, but it is always blank. I cannot figure out why.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3QpPd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">  </p>

<p>I have put in all my code below. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>

Obviously this is incredibly easy with just a simple HTML5 attribute, but I want to be able to toggle the amount of elements with the attribute and also toggle the attribute itself. For example, my starting element is this <code>&lt;article class=""column contentEditable""&gt;</code> and then the class of <code>contentEditable</code> is used to toggle the <code>contenteditable</code> attribute. But because I am duplicating this element an amount of times based on what the user selects - I need to run the <code>.focus()</code> action as a function which is then called when some more <code>articles</code> are added. With me so far? Hope so.</p>

<p>Here is the jQuery I have so far (bearing in mind another function sets the class <code>contentEditable</code> to have the attribute <code>contenteditable</code>)</p>

<pre><code>// content edittable
function makeEditable(action){  
$('.contentEditable').focus(function(){
    $(this).addClass('active');
    $(this).prepend('&lt;div class=""toolbar"" contenteditable=""false""&gt;TEST&lt;/div&gt;');
});
$('.contentEditable').blur(function(){
    $(this).removeClass('active');
    $(this).remove('.toolbar');
    alert('test');
});
}
</code></pre>

<p>To a certain extent this works perfectly, however because an <code>article</code> may have already been there when this DOM call was issued before, it means that it's running twice or more (depending on how many times I've changed the option in the select. How on earth can I get the function to only run once per item, i.e. not stack.</p>

<p>Hope this all makes sense, pretty difficult to explain.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since I'm writing an app that should provide user registration and login via facebook
I've got the facebook-sdk up and running on my client side (ember-project).</p>

<p>Now it's possible to get user-related data (name, email, fb-user-id) from FB as well as an token.
So now I want to ""register""/create a new record on my (own)server-backend to store additional user-data. A common use-case I guess.</p>

<p>Well the abstract design idea I dont understand so far is to handle that authentification.
I mean: When the client calls some API on my own REST-Server like ""POST /users/234"" (for creating a new entry),
is it enough to assume, that the data which arrives the Server-Backend (Facebook user-id/token pair) is valid?</p>

<p>Can I just put a new entry in my database including the FB-User-ID or do I have to validate that credentials also
on my server-side to be sure that the data (e.g. ""name John Doe with token 123456asdfg"") is valid?
Okay, Im pretty sure I have to double-check that but im wondering what the next steps would be now?
After my server managed validate the token and user-id agains facebooks-server does it (the server) have to open a session to the
client on its own or is it enough to always recieves the FB-token from the client-side (transportet via Headers in the REST-Calls or something)
and validate it ALWAYS for every action/business logic on the server-side agains facebook?</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html"">kernel.org</a> for <code>git push</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-u</p>
  
  <p>--set-upstream</p>
  
  <p>For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less git-pull(1) and other commands. For more information, see <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code> in git-config(1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code> from <code>git config</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code></p>
  
  <p>Defines, together with <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</code>, the upstream branch for the given branch. It tells git fetch/git pull which branch to merge and can also affect git push (see push.default). When in branch <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>, it tells git fetch the default refspec to be marked for merging in FETCH_HEAD. The value is handled like the remote part of a refspec, and must match a ref which is fetched from the remote given by <code>""branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote""</code>. The merge information is used by git pull (which at first calls git fetch) to lookup the default branch for merging. Without this option, git pull defaults to merge the first refspec fetched. Specify multiple values to get an octopus merge. If you wish to setup git pull so that it merges into <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> from another branch in the local repository, you can point <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code> to the desired branch, and use the special setting . (a period) for <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</code>.</p>

<p>I successfully set up a remote repository with github, and I successfully pushed my first commit to it with:</p>

<p>Then, I unwittingly successfully pushed my second commit to my remote repository using:</p>

<pre><code>git commit -m '[...]'

<p>The problem is it takes over 6 seconds for my HTC Titan to deserialize the file.  And I'm pretty much locked in to loading the entire file every time I want to use just a little of it.  So I'm looking for alternatives.  The ones I thought of are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Accept the 6 second deserialization delay and whenever the user goes out of a dormant state on the phone, the user will have to deal with it.  That pretty much shuts out any hope of using the scheduled background processes on the phone that limit the amount of memory and CPU used.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't use object deserialization with the JSON and use the JObject framework to access the data as I need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Break up the JSON to use one object for every Aggregate type, then have file indexes to make searching for relationships easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrate the whole thing to SQL Server using the built-in Linq to SQL functionality.  I don't like this alternative because sticking with JSON for this project would make interfacing with external APIs easier with less conversion.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a third party nosql database (I didn't find anything that supported JSON documents directly)</p></li>

<p><sub>NOTE:
There are other similar integrands for which SymPy hangs if someone is interested.
I've noticed a trend of SymPy to hang when the simplifications along the integrations lead to <code>0</code> terms, so maybe the problem is in a simplification algorithms applied along the integration.</sub></p>

<p>The Listviews can contain any number of items (from empty to requiring to scroll), however the button must be always visible. A lot of answers here suggest to use <code>layout_weight</code> along with <code>layout_height=""0dp""</code> and <code>layout_width=""fill_parent""</code>, however this results in the Listviews taking up all available space and pushing the button out of the screen. I assume the parameters for the button are wrong, but I can't figure out which of them. At least the TextViews are working, since they are positioned correctly in every case.</p>

I have spent most of my PHP ""career"" working with various MVC frameworks (even Zend with Magento is supposed to be based on) but the complexity of Magento seems to be on another level with no seemingly good resources to look to for help.</p>

<p>Looking around the site I have seen suggestions for certain books to use as reference, but they all refer to Magento 1.2 or 1.3.</p>

<p>My goal is to develop for Magento in a way that I do not alter any of the base code so that the client can easily upgrade the version of Magento and just ""drop in"" my code and have it work. The current issue is how to properly use the layout/template breakdown correctly and how to add custom model/controller functionality to the application without hacking away at Magento's core code base.</p>

I've created an app and managed to integrate both google plus login(sdk 1.7.1) and fb login(sdk 4.2.0). Everything worked fine till here. Later, to let people manually sign up, I've added parse(sdk version 1.7.4).</p>

<p>Now when the -ObjC linker flag is not present in the build settings, it builds fine and I'm able to sign up and do things with parse. But both FB and G+ throw errors like: ""Unknown class FBSDKLoginButton in Interface Builder file, Unknown class GPPSignInButton in Interface Builder file, Unknown class FBSDKProfilePictureView in Interface Builder file"", etc. However, I can login in to facebook using a custom button. Google simply doesn't respond. Both buttons are views which have custom classes.  </p>

<p>What I've tried: 
1. searched extensively on the subject
2. deleted bolts.framework from both parse and facebook, cleaned, added and built again. 
3. added searchpaths for FBSDK, Google sdk and Parse to Framework searchpaths.
4. rechecked all app Ids
5. added all the necessary frameworks as mentioned in their respective documentation. </p>

<p>I know I have to integrate google maps soon and I've been reading that maps will not work without the -ObjC linker flag. (I might be wrong).

<p>I need to call the element name <code>""Caption""</code> and pass the value <code>Users_Test</code> (where Users_Test its a value inside that table) to get the <code>SourceID e.g. ""Data1""</code></p>

<p>Here is my code so far:</p>

<pre><code>var ds = proxy.GetDataTable();
var DataSourceId = ds.Tables[""Table""].Select(""Caption = 'Users_test'"");

UserData[] userDataId = client.GetUser(ref apiKey, ref message, DataSourceId.ToString()); //GetUserData need the sourceID e.g. Data1 to be able to be used
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever I run the program in the DataSourceId variable inside <code>GetUser()</code> method is not being passed correctly. I get an array 0 and 1. In 0 I get Data1 and in 1 I get Users_tests.</p>

<p>I am suppose to get e.g. ""Data1""</p>

<p>How I can only get the value of the Caption but give the <code>SourceID</code> to the <code>GetUser()</code> method?</p>

<p>As well I would like to be able to have multiple captions such us (<code>Select(""Caption = 'Users_test'"");</code> and <code>Select(""Caption = 'Users_test1'"");</code> and <code>Select(""Caption = 'Users_test3'"");</code></p>

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p>The intent is the following: our organisation has a general public Google calendar (with Google account) that both visitors and active volunteers can subscribe to or show in their own calendar. We are in the process of developing a simple management web application (written in PHP) in which task forces can be created and managed. The core functionality is planning meetings (and managing the notes of these meetings, but this is not relevant to the question.). Users are notified via e-mail when a meeting is planned. It would also be very nice if the planned meetings could be programmatically added to the Google calendar. I now have to do this manually for every planned meeting.</p>

<p>I've been reading the documentation over at <a href=""http://developers.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">developers.google.com</a> and the Google Code page for the php library for two days now and I find myself lost in different authentication schemes, account types, keys and many more, to the point where I'm starting to think that this is not an intended use case.</p>

<p>To come to the core of my question: I need to access the organisations Google calendar, and be able to post events, without any human interaction. Is this even possible? If so, Which account do i need to create (web app, service account or installed app?) in the Google APIs console? How would I authenticate the application? Do I need to grant rights to the application somehow? Is there an example somewhere I can refer to (possibly with a different API?)?</p>

<p>From what I've seen, the critical difference with all examples in Google's documentation, is that I do not want to modify a current or end-user's calendar, but the same calendar, regardless of the logged in user. (user authentication does not happen with the Google api, we rolled our own.) The redirect/user consent mechanism isn't exactly useful for me.</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11289050/integrate-my-website-with-google-calendar/11303576#11303576"">this</a> question, the asker is trying to achieve something similar.

When the alert screen show up, the user has an option to push a notification or snooze, and the app will push a notification and then close.</p>

<p>However, when I click the snooze or the notification button, the app did not close. Instead, the app stop the alarm sound and minimized (just as when the user touch the home button). If I touch the recent app, I then can open the alert screen again.</p>

<p>Edit: I know that there're some codes such as System.exit() or killProcess, since those code are not recommended, I prefer avoid using them.
The reason I ask is because I tested the real clock app that come with my phone (4.3), and the it's alert screen will close after the I press the snooze or dismiss button. So there must be a way for me to do the same, right ?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong> 
Okay, so as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/25672594/3623497"">Sagar Pilkhwal</a> explained below, and after reading others related problems, I found out that there's no ""good"" method to close you app by codes, you have to leave that option to the users or OS. Unless you want to use System.exit or killProcess, but they're bad ways to force your app to close.</p>

<p>Sagar Pilkhwal also have a alternatively method to this problem, if you don't want your alert screen show up in recent app, you bring up another activity.</p>

<p>However, as for this case and Alarm Manager in general, open MainActivity will lead to nasty stuffs, since MainActivity is when we handle Alarm events. Then I found out another solution, if you don't want your alert screen show up in recent app, simply add </p>

<pre><code>android:excludeFromRecents=""true""
</code></pre>

<p>to your Alert.class Activity in the Manifest, or add <code>Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS</code>to the intent used to start Alert.class.</p>

<p>This will lead to other problem, as when the user press the Home button, the alarm won't turn off, and the user can't open recent app to access the alert screen (he'll has to open the app to do so). I  fix this problem by try to detect the home button pressed event. Detail answer are below.</p>

<p>COUNTRY, PROVIDER, PHONE, PLAN, CUSTOMER.</p>

<p>They all have one primary key, and except for COUNTRY all have foreign keys referencing to the previous table.</p>

<p>My issue arises when inserting values into the PHONE table. These are the PROVIDER and PHONE tables:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE Provider_T(
    Name                VARCHAR(25),
    Provider_ID         CHAR(10)    NOT NULL,
    Country_Abbrev      CHAR(3)     DEFAULT NULL,
    Website             VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL,
    CService_Number     VARCHAR(15) DEFAULT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT Provider_T_PK PRIMARY KEY(Provider_ID),
    CONSTRAINT Country_Abbrev_FK FOREIGN KEY(Country_Abbrev) REFERENCES Country_T(Abbreviation));

CREATE TABLE Phone_T(
    Phone_Model         VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
    Provider_ID         CHAR(3)     NOT NULL,
    Smartphone          BOOLEAN,
    CONSTRAINT Phone_Model_PK PRIMARY KEY(Phone_Model),
    CONSTRAINT Provider_ID_FK FOREIGN KEY(Provider_ID) REFERENCES Provider_T(Provider_ID));
</code></pre>

<p>This is my insert for the PHONE table:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO Phone_T(Phone_Model, Provider_ID, Smartphone) VALUES (""Nexus 5"", ""ROG"", TRUE);
INSERT INTO Phone_T(Phone_Model, Provider_ID, Smartphone) VALUES (""Nexus 5"", ""KOD"", TRUE);
</code></pre>

<p>I know I have duplicate Primary Keys, I'm stumped on how I could make one Phone Model for multiple PROVIDERS. I would love some advice and any help is appreciated.</p>

<a href=""http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?712"" rel=""nofollow"">http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?712</a></p>

<p>For reference, the big problem is that pieces of makefile commands like:</p>

<pre><code>""foo bar baz"": $(OBJ)
    $(CPP) $(LINKOBJ) -o $(BIN) $(LIBS)
</code></pre>

<p>... seem to get treated as three separate commands: one to build ""foo (note the included ""), one to build bar, and lastly, one to build baz"" (again, including ""). This is because make.exe seems to be using space as a delimiter.</p>

<p>However, it's reasonable to assume that one might want to build ""Hello World.exe"" for example. This doesn't seem to be possible. Double quotes don't work, and neither does escaping the separate words (I've read that somewhere, don't remember the link):</p>

<pre><code>""foo\\ bar\\ baz"": $(OBJ)
    $(CPP) $(LINKOBJ) -o $(BIN) $(LIBS)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any other way to fix this? The official manual only confirms the tokenize-by-spaces stuff, but doesn't provide a way to use space for any other purpose:
<a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Syntax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Syntax</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> as suggested, I've tried single slashes too, but these have the exact same effect as double slashes. Make complains it can't find rules for the first word:</p>

<pre><code>mingw32-make.exe: *** No rule to make target `foo', needed by `all'.  Stop.
</code></pre>

<p>The executable ""foo bar baz.exe"" is correctly produced though, but linking is done each time per word.</p>

My controller takes that type as a parameter and when I send fully populated lists like so, it works. </p>

<p><strong>Valid, properly parsed / bound data</strong></p>

<p><code>[ [ 22, 12, 9 ], [1, 2, 3], [5] ]</code></p>

<p>As soon as I send the same data structure to the controller, but this time with an empty array, it stops parsing the external collection.  Heres some data the binder chokes on:</p>

<p><strong>Valid, improperly parsed / bound data</strong></p>

<p><code>[ [ 4, 5], [], [6, 7] ]</code></p>

<p>That value is bound to a <code>List&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>, but it has a length of 1 and the first item is a <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> of <code>4, 5</code></p>

<p>So, how can I get the modelbinder to accept a <code>List&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code> when some of the <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code>'s are empty lists?  I need the ""valid, improperly parsed / bound"" data shown above to work.</p>

<p>Whats worse is that there are no binding errors in the <code>ModelState</code>!  </p>

<p>Also this is being sent as JSON to the controller (via <code>application/json</code>), if that matters.  I'd imagine if this is a bug, its likely specific to that json model binder.</p>

So I tried compressing it to a jar the same weird behavior happens and the dialog box disappears. However, the jar works fine on a different computer. Any ideas?

    public StandingsTable StandingsTable { get; set; }
}

public class RootObject
{
    public MRData MRData { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then have a simple class like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class DriverResults
{
    public string Season { get; set; }
    public string Points { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Driver&gt; Driver { get; set; }
}

public class Driver
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I request the JSON the first set of classes are populated entirely. I want to take some properties from some class eg/RootObject.MRData.StandingsTable.Season = DriverResults.Season.  Below is my property mapping</p>

<p><strong>Driver Maps</strong></p>

<p>givenName = FirstName</p>

<p>familyName = LastName</p>

<p><strong>Points Maps</strong></p>

<p>points = Points</p>

<p><strong>Season Maps</strong></p>

<p>season = Season</p>

<p>This is what I have tried so far but its null every time:</p>

<pre><code>        Mapper.CreateMap&lt;MVCF1.API.Driver, MVCF1.Models.Driver&gt;()
            .ForMember(dest =&gt; dest.FirstName, opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(src =&gt; src.givenName))
            .ForMember(dest =&gt; dest.LastName, opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(src =&gt; src.familyName));

        Mapper.CreateMap&lt;MVCF1.API.DriverStanding, MVCF1.Models.DriverResults&gt;()
            .ForMember(dest =&gt; dest.Points, opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(src =&gt; src.points));

        Mapper.CreateMap&lt;MVCF1.API.StandingsList, MVCF1.Models.DriverResults&gt;()
            .ForMember(dest =&gt; dest.Season, opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(src =&gt; src.season));

        Mapper.CreateMap&lt;MVCF1.API.RootObject, MVCF1.Models.DriverResults&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>I looked at custom type converters but was unsure how to use them from reading the documentation.</p>

<p>Please help, thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Here is the JSON returned</strong></p>

<p>In my Google App Engine servlet I have static HashMap that holding all the users profiles objects, currenty 1500 and this number will increase as more users register. </p>

<p><strong>Why I'm doing it</strong></p>

<p>Every user that requesting for the users around him compares his gps with other users and check if they are in his 10km radius, this happens every 5 min on average.
That is why I can't get the users from db every time because GAE read/write operation quota will tare me apart.</p>

<p><strong>The problem with this desgin is</strong>  </p>

<p>As the number of users increased the Hashmap turns to null every 4-6 hours, I thing that this time is getting shorten but I'm not sure.
I'm fixing this by reloading the users from the db every time I detect that it became null, But this causes DOS to my users for 30 sec, So I'm looking for better solution.<br>
I'm guessing that it happens because the size of the hashmap, Am I right?</p>

<p>The structure of protocol frames is dynamic. The dissector must somehow interpret the content. </p>

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>The values are passed into the Controller action ( I can see the value, and I know it is giving the format that is not DateTime, i.e. it is going to be in dd-MM-yyyy). Then in the Controller I will reformat it.</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
public ActionResult RequestAppointment(General_Enquiry model, FormCollection fc)

{       
    model.Appointment.Client_PreferredDate = Utilities.formatDate(fc[""Appointment.Client_PreferredDate""]);
    ModelState.Remove(""Appointment.Client_PreferredDate"");

try
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        model.Branch_Id = Convert.ToInt32(fc[""selectedBranch""]);
        model.Appointment.Branch_Id = Convert.ToInt32(fc[""selectedBranch""]);
        db.General_Enquiry.AddObject(model);
        db.SaveChanges();
        return RedirectToAction(""AppointmentSuccess"", ""Client"");

}
catch (Exception e)

    Debug.WriteLine(""{0} First exception caught."", e);
    Debug.WriteLine(e.InnerException);
    ModelState.AddModelError("""", e);
}

return View(model);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>The best I can do is to use ModelState.Remove(), which I feel really uncomfortable with. I suspect that when my Model is passed from the View to Controller, the ModelState is already set to Invalid before I can do anything in the Controller. Any ideas?</p>

<p>If I call the ModelState.Remove() everything went smoothly, the DateTime is accepted by SQL server database.</p>

<p>If at least I can update or 'refresh' ModelState at any point it'll fix my problem.</p>

<p>I have a DAO that gets some data from the DB by getting a <code>Connection</code> object and then it closes all the resources(<code>ResultSet</code>, <code>Statement</code> and <code>Connection</code>).</p>

<p>I am testing this DAO using DBUnit framework where I am doing two DB operations in this DBUnit Test here:
1) Creating a table and then loading data from XML dataset file
2) Testing the actual <code>getDataById(int id)</code> method present in the DAO</p>

<p>The problem is that my second <code>getDataById(id)</code> method is not able to get a DB connnection object because my DAO already closed it while performing step 1 above. </p>

<p>The code snippet that actually releases all the resources is shown below.</p>

<p><strong>DAO.java (Code snippet)</strong></p>

<pre><code>public void releaseResources(ResultSet rs, Statement stmt, Connection cn) {
        System.out.println(""rs = "" + rs);
        System.out.println(""stmt = "" + stmt);
        System.out.println(""cn = "" + cn);
        try {
            if (rs != null) {
                rs.close();
            }
            if (stmt != null) {
                stmt.close();
            }
            if (cn != null) {
                cn.close();
            }
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            System.out.println(""Exception while closing DB resources rs, stmt or cn......."" + ex);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Hence in order to get my DBUnit tests to work I had to overload the above releaseResources() method so that it does not close the connection object which  could be used in my <code>getDataById(int id)</code> unit test. Shown below.</p>

<p>**DAO.java (Code snippet with overloaded method) **</p>

<pre><code>//OVERLOADED JUST TO GET DBUNIT TESTS WORKING !!! :(
public void releaseResources(Statement stmt) {
    System.out.println(""\nReleasing db resources now.... 1111"");
    System.out.println(""stmt = "" + stmt);
    try {
        if (stmt != null) {
            stmt.close();
        }
    } catch (SQLException ex) {
        System.out.println(""Exception while closing DB resources stmt......."" + ex);
    }
}

"6201791","1","6202570","","2011-06-01 13:19:06","","2","2375","<p>my issue is a bit similar to this one:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2299569/having-an-issue-with-my-textbox-control-template"">Having an issue with my TextBox control template</a></p>

<p>but I'd like to go a little further:</p>

<p>my issue is simple:
I have templated controls (labels, textboxes, checkboxes and so on...). Each control has default value that can all be overriden at runtime by setting the control instance's property value. And no matter what value was set to a property, the values that I decided to use when IsEnabled = false should prevail.</p>

<p>now, I know that Value precedence in WPF prevents an easy implementation for this behaviour (as I learned in an other question: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms743230.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms743230.aspx</a>)</p>

<p>but I managed to find a workaround that does the job pretty well, except for the Foreground property in a TextBox. (and only this specific case)</p>

<p>so, just taking care of the foreground value, here is what I do on a Label: (I got rid of all the other properties for more clarity)</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;Style TargetType=""Label""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Foreground"" Value=""Blue""/&gt;

        &lt;Setter Property=""Template""&gt;
            &lt;Setter.Value&gt;
                &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=""Label""&gt;
                    &lt;Border&gt;
                        &lt;ContentPresenter Name=""ContentSite""/&gt;
                    &lt;/Border&gt;
                    &lt;ControlTemplate.Triggers&gt;
                        &lt;Trigger Property=""IsEnabled"" Value=""false""&gt;
                            &lt;Setter TargetName=""ContentSite"" Property=""TextBlock.Foreground"" Value=""Red""/&gt;
                        &lt;/Trigger&gt;
                    &lt;/ControlTemplate.Triggers&gt;
                &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
        &lt;/Setter&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, by default, a Label will have a Blue text, that I can override with, say, green by doing: <code>myLabel.Foreground = Brushes.Green</code> in code behind, and then, no matter what I set, If I write: <code>MyLabel.IsEnabled = False</code>, the text will become Red.</p>

<p>and this technique works great. (i.e.: this line in xaml will output a red text: <code>&lt;Label Foreground=""Green"" IsEnabled=""False"" /&gt;</code>). It works the same way with all other controls.</p>

<p>but when trying to reproduce this with a textBox, it does not work at all.</p>

<p>here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;Style TargetType=""TextBox""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Foreground"" Value=""Blue""/&gt;

        &lt;Setter Property=""Template""&gt;
            &lt;Setter.Value&gt;
                &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=""TextBox""&gt;
                    &lt;Grid&gt;
                        &lt;Border Name=""Border""&gt;
                            &lt;ScrollViewer x:Name=""PART_ContentHost"" /&gt;
                        &lt;/Border&gt;
                    &lt;/Grid&gt;
                    &lt;ControlTemplate.Triggers&gt;
                        &lt;Trigger Property=""IsEnabled"" Value=""False""&gt;
                            &lt;Setter TargetName=""PART_ContentHost"" Property=""Foreground"" Value=""Red""/&gt;
                        &lt;/Trigger&gt;
                    &lt;/ControlTemplate.Triggers&gt;
                &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
        &lt;/Setter&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to add <code>Foreground=""{TemplateBinding Foreground}""</code> on the PART_ContentHost with no success.</p>

<p>I suspect this has something to do with the fact that PART_ContentHost is a scrollviewer and there is some kind of hidden (at least from me) inheritance going on.</p>

<p>the only other explanation I can find is that the TextBox class has some kind of special treatment that hardcodes a link between the control itself and its PART_ContentHost part (binding or propertychanged event or something else?)</p>

<p>if somebody could explain this to me, this would be great!
if somebody could even provide a nice solution (one that does not involve a nasty hack like the one I'm using at the moment but will not show here so as not to cause major eye injury to the reader), this would be even greater!</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>CPU-time for integration      : 6.57e+005 seconds</p>
  
  <p>CPU-time for one GRID interval: 951 milli-seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already tried to increase the grid interval to reduce the relativ error, but still the simulation is advancing too fast. I only read about aproaches to reduce model complexity to allow simulation within the defined time steps.</p>

<p>Note, that the Simulation does keep up with real-time and is even faster. How can I ín this case match simulated time and real time?</p>

<p>Edit 1:</p>

<p>I used Lsodar solver with checked ""Synchronize with realtime option"" in Realtime tab. I have the realtime simulation licence option. I use Dymola 2013 on Windows 7. Here the result for a stepsize of 15s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Integration terminated successfully at T = 691200</p>
  
  <p>CPU-time for integration       :   6.6e+005 seconds</p>
  
  <p>CPU-time for one GRID interval :   1.43e+004 milli-seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The deviation still is roughly about 4.5%.</p>

<p>I did however not use inline integration.</p>

<p>Do I need hard realtime or inline integration to improve those results? It should be possible to get a deviation lower than 4.5% using soft realtime or not?</p>

<p>Edit 2:<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ruNY.jpg"" alt=""relative difference between real time and Simulation advance in %""></p>

<p>I took the Python27 block from the Berkeley Buildings library to read the System time and compare it with the Simulation advance. The result shows that 36 hours after Simulation start, the Simulation slows down slightly (compared to real time). About 72 hours after the start of the simulation it starts getting about 10% faster than real time. In addition, the jitter in the result increases after those 72 hours.</p>

<p>Any explanations?</p>

<p>Next steps will be:
-changing to fixed step solver (Might well be this is a big part of the solution)
-Changing from DDE Server to OPC Server, which at the Moment doesn't not seem to be possible in Dymola 2013 however.</p>

<p>Edit 3:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rB9bg.jpg"" alt=""Relative Simulation time deviation with fixed step solver""></p>

<p>Nope... using a fixed step solver does seem to solve the problem. In the first 48 hours of simulation time the deviation seems to be equal to the deviation using a solver with variable step size. In this example I used the Rkfix 3 solver with an integrator step of 0.1.</p>

<p>Nobody knows how to get rid of those huge deviations?</p>

<p>I'm currently building a small website where I write down problems that arise and answers to them for others to see. Currently I'm using a DAL much like the one described <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/01/15/435498.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Now I have been looking at other models, and in particular linq based models using Linq2SQL and the ADO.net Entries framework. I realize I'm moving the data access to the code layer in a way since I'm then filtering out for example a toplist with linq queries. The reason I started doing this was because the DAL was not really syncing up with the DB at all times and nullable types became not nullable when I changed something in the DB. Then if I would reimport the tables into the data table my queries would be lost.</p>

<p>My simple question is really, if you want a good DAL for ASP.net today, what would that be? Suggestions, experiences are more than welcome.</p>

<p>I want to see in my app only the video, rather than a youtube page. 
How can I go about this?
So far I have tried:</p>

<pre><code>urlValue = [urlValue stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@""watch?v=""
                                             withString:@""v/""];
urlValue = [urlValue stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@""&amp;feature""
                                                       withString:@""?version=3&amp;f=playlists&amp;app""];
</code></pre>

<p>This is the final url :
 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/v/81_2Xb0XB_E?version=3&amp;f=playlists&amp;app=youtube_gdata_player"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/v/81_2Xb0XB_E?version=3&amp;f=playlists&amp;app=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>

<p>And this is how I load it:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *videoHTML = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""&lt;iframe type=\""text/html\"" width=\""305\"" height=\""180\"" src=\""%@\"" frameborder=\""0\""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;"", urlValue];
</code></pre>

<p>For some of them it's ok, I can watch it, but for others, like this url I cant watch. (""Watch this video on youtube . Playback on other website has been disabled by the video owner"").</p>

<p>Any idea how can I improve my code? or if it's because of url?</p>

<p>Here is an example of url which is working:

<pre><code>module Validations
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    extend ActiveModel::Callbacks
    extend ActiveModel::Translation

    extend  HelperMethods
    include HelperMethods
...
</code></pre>

<p>Theoretically, this allows you to not only call helper methods like <code>validates_presence_of</code> as class macros (as shown in all the standard examples), but to also call these helper methods directly on the model instance:</p>

<pre><code>myobject.validates_presence_of :name
</code></pre>

<p>Where I can see this being useful is in the context of a custom validator that wants to leverage some of the existing helper methods:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomValidator &lt; ActiveModel::Validator
  def validate(record)
    record.validates_presence_of :name
    record.validates_acceptance_of :terms
    ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And whether or not this is encouraged behavior, it did seem to work until some changes with specific validators in Rails 4.1. So my question is if rails does not support calling these helper methods in this fashion (as instance methods on the model), why are they included in the model instead of just extended?</p>

<p>To achieve this behaviour, I derived the <code>Button</code> class, and added a <code>DependencyProperty</code>:  </p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>public class ScalableButton : Button
{
    public Storyboard MouseOutAnimation
    {
        get { return (Storyboard)GetValue(MouseOutAnimationProperty); }
        set { SetValue(MouseOutAnimationProperty, value); }
    }

    // Using a DependencyProperty as the backing store for MouseOutAnimation.  This enables animation, styling, binding, etc...
    public static readonly DependencyProperty MouseOutAnimationProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register(""MouseOutAnimation"", typeof(Storyboard), typeof(ScalableButton), new UIPropertyMetadata(null));

    public ScalableButton(double originalScale, Style style)
        : base()
    {
        CreateMouseOutAnimation(originalScale);
        RenderTransform = new ScaleTransform(originalScale, 1, 0.5, 0.5);
        RenderTransformOrigin = new Point(0.5, 0.5);
        Style = style;
        ApplyTemplate();
    }

    private void CreateMouseOutAnimation(double originalScale)
    {
        DoubleAnimation animX = new DoubleAnimation();
        animX.To = originalScale;
        animX.Duration = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(200);
        DoubleAnimation animY = new DoubleAnimation();
        animY.To = 1;
        animY.Duration = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(200);
        Storyboard sb = new Storyboard();
        sb.Children.Add(animX);
        sb.Children.Add(animY);
        Storyboard.SetTarget(sb, this.RenderTransform);
        Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(animX, new PropertyPath(ScaleTransform.ScaleXProperty));
        Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(animY, new PropertyPath(ScaleTransform.ScaleYProperty));
        MouseOutAnimation = sb;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I created a <code>Style</code> with a <code>ControlTemplate</code> to make a custom appearance for my buttons, and added a <code>Storyboard</code> resource to scale up them, and another to scale down and here is the problem:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type rgw:ScalableButton}"" x:Key=""EllipseWithText"" &gt;

                    &lt;Storyboard x:Key=""MouseOverAnimation""&gt;

                        &lt;!-- This would be the one which scales down --&gt;
                    &lt;/Storyboard&gt;

We want to run these <strong>groups in parallel</strong> so that it completes quicker. The <code>maxParallelForks</code> property of <code>Test</code> task doesn't seem serve our purpose in this case so instead, we thought we can just use ant's <code>Parallel</code> target.</p>

<p>I've done something like below:</p>

<pre><code>task runAllTestsByGroups &lt;&lt; {
    ant.parallel(threadsPerProcessor: 1) {
        // Test tasks defined within the same build script
        runTestGroup1
        runTestGroup2
        runTestGroup3
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when executing 'runAllTestsByGroups', it simply complete directly without actually running any tests. </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>what am I doing wrong here? And basically is it possible to reuse Ant's <code>Parallel</code> target in Gradle?</p></li>
<li><p>It's surprising that Gradle does not provide a similar solution for running tasks in parallel like the <code>Parallel</code> target provided by Ant. Is there no <strong>native</strong> way to execute tasks in parallel in Gradle?</p></li>

As one might expect, there are certain parameters in our api for whose values are a restricted set. For example, there might be an ""on"" parameter for a post which describes a tv, and the same parameter might be available for filtering on a GET.</p>

<p>My problem has been that I can't find a built-in way to describe valid parameter values. For bools I'm ok with just putting it in parens, but some parameters have 20 valid input values, and some have multiple possible sets of input params depending on the value of multiple variable points in the route. For example:</p>

<pre><code>myapi.com/&lt;string:gameConsoleId&gt;/games/&lt;string:gameId&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Internally, we don't allow any possible value for <code>gameConsoleId</code> or <code>gameId</code>. We want a <code>gameConsoleId</code> to be a <code>PLAYSTATION</code>, or an <code>XBOX</code>, or a <code>NINTENDO</code>. The same is true of the <code>gameId</code>. If you pass a mario game to a playstation console, it should return an error, and we want to document that.</p>

<p>Is this a sign that the api needs to be designed differently, or am I just missing how to do the documentation norms? </p>

<hr>

<p>To be more clear, I am trying to figure out how to do something in Sphinx. Specifically, I am looking for correct syntax, commands, or norms for documenting the valid input parameters to an api endpoint. It is clear to me how to document that there is a valid input parameter. </p>

<pre><code>:query gameConsoleId: The type of game console

<p>What isn't clear to me is how to document the valid values for those inputs. We have valid inputs defined, it just isn't clear to me how to communicate that through Sphinx.</p>

<p>My thread has an attribute, mSurfaceHolder, which holds the surface that I'll be drawing to. The run() method for my thread looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void run() {
    // We're running now
    setState(STATE_RUNNING);

    // Keep looping while the game is running or paused
    while (mState == STATE_RUNNING || mState == STATE_PAUSED) {
        synchronized (mSurfaceHolder) {
            // If the game is running, update physics etc.
            if (mState == STATE_RUNNING) {
                updateGame();
            }
            // Draw the game even if it's paused
            drawGame();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>STATE_RUNNING</code> represents the state when the activity is in the foreground and the game should be running.
<code>STATE_PAUSED</code> represents the state when another activity has come into the foreground. I'm not completely sure why I need to still draw while it's paused, but that's what I seem to have gathered from the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/LunarLander/src/com/example/android/lunarlander/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">LunarLander example</a>.</p>

<p>What I'm hoping is that while I'm looking at the activity, the game will update and draw (which I test by using LogCat). And then when I go back to the home screen or another activity appears over the top, it will just draw.</p>

<p>Well it <em>does</em> draw and update while I'm watching the activity, so the game loop itself works. But when I leave the activity, it has no effect. Here is the thread's pause() method that is called from the activity's onPause():</p>

<pre><code>public void pause() {
    Log.d(""Game"",""Here"");
    synchronized (mSurfaceHolder) {
        Log.d(""Game"",""There"");
        // If the thread is running, pause it
        if (mState == STATE_RUNNING) {
            setState(STATE_PAUSED);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, to test this method I have logged some messages. Now what I find when I leave the activity is that ""Here"" is logged, but ""There"" is not. Now with my limited knowledge of threads (I hardly know what <code>synchronized</code> actually does), I believe this will happen because my thread can't get synchronized with the surface holder. But I don't know WHY it doesn't synchronize. A few seconds after I've left the activity, I see the following warning in LogCat:</p>

<p><code>Activity pause timeout for HistoryRecord</code></p>

<p>Any idea why this would happen? There are no problems if I try to start the activity again, the thread just keeps running as it was.</p>

<p>Thanks very mucho.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just discovered something else. The thread pauses just fine if I leave the activity within about a second of having started it. And then it will resume and pause again with no problems at all while the same task is still running. I have no idea why for a short period of time it will work, but if I leave it too long, it won't.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: Okay... I fixed it. But I don't think I'm <em>supposed</em> to do what I've done. I've basically removed any synchronization with <code>mSurfaceHolder</code> from both the pause() and the setState() methods (which is used by pause()). No it works as it's supposed to, but I'm thinking the synchronization is there for a reason.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best question for me to ask is this:
WHEN should you synchronize a thread with an object by use of a synchronized block? And in this case, what is the purpose of synchronizing with the SurfaceHolder?</p>

All these user controls have ""Save"" &amp; ""Cancel"" buttons. On click of these buttons they raise a Routed Event declared and defined in their respective classes. On clicking the Save button ""ConfigurationSaved"" event is raised &amp; on Cancel button ""ConfigurationCancelled"" event is raised.</p>

<p>These events when raised, the container which hosts the user control will take care of saving the configuration.</p>

<p>Code Snippet for all the class's routed event definition is as follows:</p>

<p>this works as it should.</p>

<p>The problem is, that our users seems to use bookmark for <code>PAGE B</code>, so the entity will never be injected because they never visited <code>PAGE A</code></p>

<p>so they always throw this exception</p>

<p>Is there a global function to catch all <code>@In attribute requires non-null value</code> exceptions  and forward the user to <code>PAGE C</code> (startpage)?<br>
(of course i can catch this execption on <code>PAGE B</code> but this happens not only on one page, we want to handle this exception on every page)</p>

<p>we are using: jboss5 + jsf 1.2 + seam 2</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE after the answer of EmirCalabuch</strong>:<br>
I also tried the hint from EmirCalabuch with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;page conversation-required=""true"" no-conversation-view-id=""PageC.xhtml"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but the problem is, that the conversation is alive at this moment, to this forwarding to <code>pageC</code> never happens...</p>

<p>i also made in the <code>page.xml</code> of this page something like:</p>

<p>but this <code>checkIfEntityIsSet()</code> is never called, because the <code>@In attribute requires non-null value</code> is thrown before... so this was not a help at all...</p>

Turnover in this project is high, because students join for their 10 weeks Bachelors thesis or six month Masters thesis, then graduate and are gone forever.</p>

<p>Each thesis usually involves the development of a new feature and while we stress the responsibilities for fixing bugs in the work of other students, we have slowly reached the point where shared code-ownership does not exist anymore. People rarely fix issues in other peoples code, but leave their new features in a state, which would need cleaning desperately.</p>

<p>2) Is there anything in the AltBeacon library (e.g. the way Bluetooth scanning has been implemented) that would make parallelizing of the bluetooth scanning function not feasible or ineffective?</p>

<p>Here's the main method. </p>

<pre><code>class tempMain extends JFrame

    temp.setVisible(true);
    while(true)
    {

</code></pre>

<p>When I ran this on my Windows 7 machine, nothing happened for at least about a minute (I didn't wait after that) after I clicked the button. </p>

<p>Now, just make one small change - </p>

<pre><code>  Thread.sleep(200); // uncomment this from the main.
</code></pre>

<p>And surprisingly, it works and a JOptionPane message is displayed. Why is the message not displayed the first time?</p>

<p>In the algorithm, when you add a node to a table, you resize by 1 and then append it.</p>

<p>I don't understand the benefit of having this linked list of free tables. What's the difference between pre-allocating them and allocating them on the fly? If you pre-allocate then you're wasting memory so the main benefit of a HAMT is defeated, and also you'll rapidly run out of pre-allocated tables to use so it was a waste from the start.</p>

<p>I just don't really understand that section of the paper at all. Either way you're allocating these arrays so how is this more complex version any better than simply re-allocating on demand? I'm coding this in C# by the way if it makes any difference regarding memory optimizations.</p>

<p>I'm working on a form in .NET, I'm using the standard field validators. What i want is to make the input field change background color if the user clicks the submit button without filling in the mandatory field (=the requiredfieldvalidator tag becomes visible).</p>

<p>I've done this by having a requiredfieldvalidator just before the input field. When the user clicks the submit button the validator changes from display:none to display: inline. But what I'm interested in is setting a different background color on the input field. So i did something like this:</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<pre><code>.error[style*=""inline""] + input { background-color: #e8bab2; }
</code></pre>

<h2>HTML</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;span  class=""error"" style=""display:none;""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;input type=""text""&gt;
&lt;input type=""button"" id=""sendme"" value=""Send"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>JS (the validator handles this part)</h2>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $(""#sendme"").click(function() {
        $("".error"").css(""display"",""inline"");
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>So, the problem: The field will light up as red in Firefox when I click the button but in Webkit (Chrome 19/Safari 5.1) the input field won't change background color until i click the input field</p>

<p>I've created a fiddle, compare the behavior between Firefox and Webkit browsers:</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/fhbUH/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/fhbUH/</a></p>

<p>My code does almost everything but I do not know how to implement last part about printing a message ""Password verified"" if the user id and password matched or either ""Invalid password"" or ""No such user"" depending on the return value of the validate program…. It always prints me PASSWORD VERIFIED even if it is not….. Any help will appreciated. Sorry if it is too simple question….I am beginner in C. Any help will be appreciated….thanks….</p>

"10796987","1","10797193","","2012-05-29 10:05:29","","5","686","<p>This question is around how to architect WCF services to make it easy to evolve over time.
Its difficult to get the depth of response to this without describing the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I am developing a large system of WCF services and clients.
The server side is ""easy"" to update as there are only 10 servers in question running this code.</p>

<p>The clients are very difficult to update, despite the high degree of automation, at 300,000+ WCF clients, updates are something that will always take time, and only achieves a high update success rate over a period of two to three weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Data Contracts</strong></p>

<pre><code>[DataContract]
public class MyContract
{
    [DataMember]
    public int Identity {get; set;}

    [DataMember]
    public string Name {get; set;}

    // More members
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>DataContract</code> is difficult to initialise and has a standard <code>MyContractFactory</code> class to initialise obtain the appropriate instance for your machine.</p>

<pre><code>public class static MyContractFactory
{
    public static MyContract GetMyContract()
    {
        // Complex implementation
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>ServiceContracts</strong></p>

<p>The <code>DataContract</code> is very common across a range of web services.</p>

<pre><code>namespace MyPrefix.WebServicve1
{
    [ServiceContract]
    public class IMyInterface1
    {
        [OperationContract]
        public void DoSomethingWithMyContract(MyContract data);
    }

    [ServiceContract]
    public class IMyInterface2
    {
        [OperationContract]
        public void DoSomethingDifferentWithMyContract(MyContract data);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Client</strong></p>

<p>My client is plugin based with plugins running in either separate processes or app domains depending on the level of trust we have in that plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation 1</strong></p>

<p>My initial implementation of this (default WCF) ended up with the <code>DataContract</code> in one assembly, <code>ServiceContract</code>, and implementation in its own assembly.</p>

<p>The clients ended up with a very ugly,</p>

<pre><code>MyWebService1.MyContract
MyWebService2.MyContract
</code></pre>

<p>With a copy and paste of the <code>MyContractFactory</code> in nearly every plugin.  Whilst the <code>DataContract</code> was the same, the fact that the clients did not include the <code>DataContract</code> assembly meant that it appeared under different namespaces as different objects.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation 2</strong></p>

<p>The clients now include the <code>DataContract</code> assembly, <code>ServiceContracts</code> are in a separate assembly to the service implementation, clients may include some of the <code>ServiceContract</code> assemblies if it will aid with code reuse (no more copy and paste).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>With the second implementation I am now facing the difficulty of, how do I update my <code>DataContract</code> and <code>ServiceContracts</code>?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do I update the same assembly and increment the version number? How do I preserve backwards compatibility whilst all the clients upgrade?  Breaking the clients until they update is not acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>Do I create a new assembly with a class that extends <code>MyDataContract</code>, new methods that accept the new type under a new <code>ServiceContract</code>? Does that mean for every minor change to my contracts I need a new assembly? How would I stop it from getting to literally hundreds in a couple of years time?</p></li>
<li><p>Some other solution?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of the solutions I think through, they all seem to have a major downside.  </p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be (at least to me) of,</p>

<ul>
<li>Preserving backwards compatibility until clients update</li>
<li>Keeping the clients trim with no bloat as the software evolves over time</li>
<li>Not significantly polluting my <code>ServiceContract</code> (overloads of the <code>OperationContract</code> need a new ""name"").  I already have things like the below, and it strikes me a nightmare to maintain over time.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Operation Contract complexity</em></p>

<pre><code>[OperationContract]
public void DoSomethingWithMyContract(MyContract data);

[OperationContract(Name = ""DoSomethingWithMyDataByAdditionalData""]
public void DoSomethingWithMyContract(MyContract data, MyContract2 additionalData);
</code></pre>

<p>I am looking for a solution that has worked over a period of time in a large scale environment.  Blog entries and the like are very welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>

<p>Looking through the limitations of using ""schemaless"" changes, different namespaces seems like the only sure method.  However, its not quite working as expected, e.g. below</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract(
    Name = ""IServiceContract"",
    Namespace = ""http://myurl/2012/05"")]
public interface IServiceContract1
{
    // Some operations
}

[ServiceContract(
    Name = ""IServiceContract"",
    Namespace = ""http://myurl/2012/06"")]
public interface IServiceContract2
{
    // Some different operations using new DataContracts
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the following service</p>

<pre><code>public class MyService : IServiceContract1, IServiceContract2
{
    // Implement both operations
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the following config</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;service behaviorConfiguration=""WcfServiceTests.ServiceBehavior""
    name=""Test.MyService""&gt;
    &lt;endpoint
      address=""2012/05""
      binding=""wsHttpBinding""
      contract=""Test.IServiceContract1""&gt;
      &lt;identity&gt;
        &lt;dns value=""localhost"" /&gt;
      &lt;/identity&gt;
    &lt;/endpoint&gt;
    &lt;endpoint
      address=""2012/06""
      binding=""wsHttpBinding""
      contract=""Test.IServiceContract2""&gt;
      &lt;identity&gt;
        &lt;dns value=""localhost"" /&gt;
      &lt;/identity&gt;
    &lt;/endpoint&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address=""mex"" binding=""mexHttpBinding"" contract=""IMetadataExchange"" /&gt;
  &lt;/service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Results in two contracts with two different names, I expected that I can point my clients to,</p>

<p><a href=""http://myurl.com/MyService.svc/2012/05"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myurl.com/MyService.svc/2012/05</a>  for the old version, and <a href=""http://myurl.com/MyService.svc/2012/06"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myurl.com/MyService.svc/2012/06</a></p>

<p>, but it seems like if I want to preserve the ServiceContract name they have to be two separate services rather than separate endpoint addresses for the same service?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>I ended up using the method I have described under <strong>update 1</strong>.  Whilst the WSDL looks wrong, the service is indeed backwards compatible under older clients when I've tested this.</p>

I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>A base localization as storyboard file (which is basically English)</li>
<li>Four string files: English, German, French and Japanese</li>
</ul>

<p>Until Xcode 5 those worked without any problems.</p>

<p>But since Xcode 6 I have the following situation:</p>

<ol>
<li>The application only uses the labels used in the base file when running on a device/simulator</li>
<li>BUT my Localizable.strings file, which I have in different languages for all non-storyboard related localizations, works perfect. (So in the end I have a mixture of languages while running on a device)</li>
<li>Since Xcode 6 there is the possibility to see the localizations as a preview screen in the assistant editor. Everything works there.</li>
</ol>

<p>So: the only thing that doesn't work is the localization of the storyboard while running</p>

<p>Does anyone else have the same problem and is there a solution?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> With Xcode 6.1 GM the localization on the actual device is correct now but the simulator is English only, even if I choose another language in the simulator.</p>

Once I use fft on those time domain values, I have 128 points in my fft spectrum giving me 172Hz for each frequency bin size. </p>

<p>I would like to tighten the frequency bin to 86Hz and still keep to only 128 fft points, instead of increasing my fft count to 256 through an adjustment on how I'm creating my samples.</p>

<p>The question I have is whether or not this is theoretically possible. My thought would be to run fft on any Hz values between 0Hz to 11025Hz only. I don't care about anything above that anyway. This would cut my working spectrum in half and put my frequency bins at 86Hz and while keeping to my 128 spectrum bins. Perhaps this can be accomplished via a window function in the time domain?</p>

<p>Currently the code I'm using to create my samples and then convert to fft is:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

sample_rate = 44100
chunk = 128
record_seconds = 2

stream = self.audio.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1,
                        rate=sample_rate, input=True, frames_per_buffer=6300)

sample_list = []

for i in range(0, int(sample_rate / chunk * record_seconds)):
    data = stream.read(chunk)
    sample_list.append(np.fromstring(data, dtype=np.int16))

### then later ###:

for samp in sample_list:
        samp_fft = np.fft.fft(samp) ...

<p>Also, does the Version field drive when an .ipa file is dragged into iTunes - whether or not this version of the file replaces another version.  I ask because I recently made an adhoc distribution and when users dragged it in to iTunes even though iTunes would prompt the user about replacing the existing version, it would not replace it.

<p>I exported this query to a text file and ran it on Oracle, it is running fine! Also, I created a temp table on Oracle with the above SQL query and replaced sql_stmt in VBA with ""select * from new_oracle_table"". Strangely, this seems to be working fine as well. Do you think it's something to do with the length of the SQL query in sql_stmt itself? Any ideas on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I was given a database that I had to ""fix"" and am quite perplexed about a particular problem. To keep it simple, we have two tables (of consequence) that already existed. It took me awhile to figure out the relationship between the two and ultimately decided on a traditional junction table as follows:</p>

<pre><code>                     Publications (id, SvcReqID, LogID)
                             /              \
                            /                \
               SvcRequest (id)              SvcProgressLog (id)
</code></pre>

<p>SvcRequest &amp; SvcProgressLog are more or less sibling tables both containing a reference to the parent. There is this weird hierarchical kind of relationship that took me awhile to figure out, now I just need a way to join them which makes it easy to perform CRUD operations.</p>

<p>The process here is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>A service request for a publication comes in.</li>
<li><strong>If the Publication exists --> update the corresponding Publication record. If not, create a new Publication. After that, create the SvcRequest record from information captured from a webform.</strong> (help needed here)</li>
<li>Finally a Log entry can be created for Requests that exists, but not yet Logged.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following relations exist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Publications --> SvcRequest :: 1 --> Many</li>
<li>Publications --> SvcProgressLog :: 1 --> Many</li>
<li>SvcRequest --> SvcProgressLog :: Many --> Many (-ish)</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I greatly appreciate the help and words of wisdom ;)

<p><a href=""https://www.jobsbank.gov.sg/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jobsbank.gov.sg/</a></p>

<p>What I wan to do is to parse the content of all available job listing in the web.</p>

<p>my approach:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>click search on an empty search bar which will return me all records listed. The resulting web page is: <a href=""https://www.jobsbank.gov.sg/ICMSPortal/portlets/JobBankHandler/SearchResult.do"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jobsbank.gov.sg/ICMSPortal/portlets/JobBankHandler/SearchResult.do</a></p></li>
<li><p>provide the search result web address to R and identify all the job listing links</p></li>
<li><p>supply the job listing links to R and ask R to go to each listing and extract the content.</p></li>
<li><p>look for next page and repeat step 2 and 3.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, the problem is that the resulting webpage I got from step 1 does not direct me to the search result page. Instead, it will direct me back to the home page. </p>

<p>Is there anyway to overcome this problem?</p>

<p>Suppose I managed to get the web address for the search result, I intent to use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>base_url &lt;- ""https://www.jobsbank.gov.sg/ICMSPortal/portlets/JobBankHandler/SearchResult.do""
base_html &lt;- getURLContent(base_url,cainfo=""cacert.pem"")[[1]]

<p>The problem that I'm having is that the url keeps interpretting it like a seperator, and the page breaks.

<pre><code>{""id"": ""555816da-4547-4a82-9e7e-1e92515bd82b"", ""type"": ""type2""} 
</code></pre>

<p>The solutions to this I have seen on the internet (primarily here), that have not worked are here:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT questions-&gt;'data'-&gt;'list' 
FROM assignments 
WHERE id='81asd6230-126d-4bc8-9745-c4333338115c' 
AND questions-&gt;'data'-&gt;'list' @&gt; '[{""id"":""854f4d2a-f37c-42cb-9a1f-17a15454a314""}]';
</code></pre>

<p>I have seen this solution on multiple different responses but it doesn't narrow down the array at all, it returns the full thing every time. The first id in the where clause is the id of the specific assignment object that I want, its mostly irrelevant here.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT questions-&gt;'data'-&gt;'list' 
FROM assignments 
WHERE id='81asd6230-126d-4bc8-9745-c4333338115c' 
AND questions-&gt;'data'-&gt;'list' @&gt; '[{""id"":""854f4d2a-f37c-42cb-9a1f-17a15454a314""}]';
</code></pre>

<p>This returns nothing. </p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea on how to do this easily?</p>

<p>The only complain I have is that Im always in fear that I will overwrite changes other people made.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on a project without Git, just pure FTP. If I start PHPstorm, the first thing I have to do is synchronize my local files manually using the ""Compare with local version..."" dialog, which takes a lot of time at bigger projects.</p>

<p>Is it possible that PhpStorm behaves like Eclipse Remote Explorer?
It would be awesome if PhpStorm would check the file I just opened for a newer version on my default remote and replaces it automatically.</p>

I had a look online to find how to get plugins to work on multiple elements and I found this tutorial:</p>

<p><a href=""http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/</a></p>

<p>I am using the lightweight start, but I have come across a problem.
I am not sure where I should be putting my private functions nor can I get a click event to work.</p>

<p>I need to be able to bind a click event to the page buttons and for it to access the plugin defaults but nothing I try seems to work.</p>

<p>Here is my code so far (it is a mess I know):</p>

; (function ($, window, document, undefined) {

    // undefined is used here as the undefined global 
    // variable in ECMAScript 3 and is mutable (i.e. it can 
    // be changed by someone else). undefined isn't really 
    // being passed in so we can ensure that its value is 
    // truly undefined. In ES5, undefined can no longer be 
    // modified.

    // window and document are passed through as local 
    // variables rather than as globals, because this (slightly) 
    // quickens the resolution process and can be more 
    // efficiently minified (especially when both are 
    // regularly referenced in your plugin).

    // Create the defaults once
    var pluginName = 'paginate',
        defaults = {

        };

    // The actual plugin constructor
    function Plugin(element, options) {

    }

})(jQuery, window, document);
</code></pre>

<p>So you can see from the Plugin.prototype.click event that I am trying to access my options from a click on the actual toolbar. 
This is proving difficult. I know the answer is simple, but I just can't see it!</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

I have a map that has <em>N</em> items - the map is constructed once and then read many, many times. The map doesn't change during the lifetime of the program (no new items are added, no items are deleted and items are not reordered). Because the map doesn't change, it doesn't need to be thread-safe, even though the application using it is heavily multi-threaded. I expect that ~50% of lookups will happen for items not in the map.</p>

<p><code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TItem&gt;</code> is quite fast and I may end up using it but I wonder if there's another data structure that's faster for this scenario. While the rest of the program is obviously more expensive than this map, it is used in performance-critical parts and I'd like to speed it up as much as possible.</p>

I keep getting ""Value does not fall within the expected range"" when I call one of my web service functions. I'm using a POST method to which I'm passing a json object and expecting some json data to be returned.</p>

<p>It doesn't make sense as I've got other web service functions working perfectly well and most annoyingly, it works a perfectly when called from Fiddler 2.</p>

<p>I'm calling the following code in a try/catch</p>

<pre><code>string jsonResponse = await wc.UploadStringTaskAsync(new Uri(App.WebServiceUri + ""/json/getdocumentbydocid""), jsonRequest);
</code></pre>

<p>I've put break points in my code and when called from fiddler, it goes into the specific function but when called through code, it generates the exception ""Value does not fall within the expected range"" but it isn't caught in the try/catch</p>

<p>It bombs out straight to </p>

<pre><code>private void Application_UnhandledException(object sender, ApplicationUnhandledExceptionEventArgs 
</code></pre>

<p>e)</p>

<p>Maybe it's not being caught by the try/catch because I'm calling this from an async function:</p>

<pre><code>public static Task&lt;string&gt; UploadStringTaskAsync(this WebClient wc, Uri url, string data)
{
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource&lt;string&gt;();

    wc.UploadStringCompleted += (s, e) =&gt;
    {
        if (e.Error != null)
            tcs.TrySetException(e.Error);
        else if (e.Cancelled)
            tcs.TrySetCanceled();
        else
            tcs.TrySetResult(e.Result);
    };

    wc.UploadStringAsync(url, ""POST"", data);

    return tcs.Task;
}
</code></pre>

<p>but it still doesn't explain my error. I'm not dealing with any list or similar, so again I have to assume that it's something related to the uri, but that's not it either!</p>

<p>After I the error is caught in Application_UnhandledException, and continue running the app, it actually calls my code and returns the appropriate data but my app has bombed out. </p>

<p>It just doesn't make sense! The json object pass is a simple poco object which contains a string (table name), a long (docid) and a int (page no) and it returns a poco object, again none containing list or similar, so I don't understand what this error mean and why does it work perfectly for every other functions defined in my web service.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>This is the second time I'm changing this answer!! I deleted my original one and I thought I had it fixed and provided the details but it wasn't the correct reason.</p>

<p>I'm so fed up getting this wrong but at least I'm learning something in the process but the error still doesn't make sense, well at least not to me!</p>

<p>I thought it was related to dodgy xaml, or not having a lazy load when calling my async function from the constructor, but that's not the case.</p>

<p>While I had dodgy code, I'm pretty sure now that I've cleared it up and all is set up as expected but I'm still getting the error.</p>

<p>I have a third-party control that needs to be on a UserControl. My UserControl has a single property i.e. SourceFile of type string</p>

<pre><code>public string SourceFile
{
    get
    {
        return _sourceFile;
    }
    set
    {
        _sourceFile = value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This property is binded to a property from my viewModel i.e. DocumentUri</p>

<pre><code>public string DocumentUri
{
    get { return this._documentUri; }
    set
    {
        if (this._documentUri != value)
        {
            this.SetProperty(ref this._documentUri, value);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The SetProperty takes care of the INotifyPropertyChanged and my event handler is definitely being set.</p>

<p>Now here is my xaml code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid Grid.Row=""1""&gt;
    &lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Vertical""&gt;
        &lt;cc:Viewer SourceFile=""{Binding DocumentUri}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;                        
 &lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Where cc:Viewer is my UserControl.</p>

<p>When set as the above, I get the following error: ""Value does not fall within the expected range.""</p>

<p>If I remove the SourceFile=""{Binding DocumentUri}"", the error disappears but that's pointless as I need this property to display my document when it is downloaded. It just confirms that it is in fact linked to this property.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Does this mean I have to do something like <code>urllib.parse.urlencode</code> to actually replace the variables?   </p>

<p>I imported the libraries mentioned in the article and changed code to:  </p>

<p>First of all, are MCRROOT's and PATH's values correct?

Also, why is the <code>isInstalledMCR</code> method returning <code>false</code>? I've double-checked the MCR installation (and even uninstalled and installed it to be sure), so why isn't the library finding it?</p>

<p>Thanks on advance for any help!</p>

At the moment, the build process for this is haphazard and everything is built off the trunk.</p>

<p>We would like to explore whether there is a build system which will allow us to manage releases and automatically pull in dependencies. Such a tool exists for java, Maven. I like it's package, repository and dependency mechanism, and I know that with either the maven-native or maven-nar plugin we could get this. However the problem is that we cannot fix the source trees to the ""maven way"" - and unfortunately (at least the maven-nar) plugins don't seem to like code that is not structured this way...</p>

<p>So my question is, is there a tool which satisfies the following for C++</p>

<ol>
<li>build</li>
<li>package (for example libraries with all headers, something like the .nar)</li>
<li>upload package to a ""repository""</li>
<li>automatically pull in the required dependencies from said repository, extract headers and include in build, extract libraries and link. The depedencies would be described in the ""release"" for that binary - so if we were to use  CI server to build that ""release"", the build script has the necessary dependencies listed (like the pom.xml files).</li>
</ol>

<p>I could roll my own by modifying either make+shell scripts or waf/scons with extra python modules for the packaging and dependency management - however I would have thought that this is a common problem and someone somewhere has a tool for this? Or does everyone roll their own? Or have I missed a significant feature of waf/scons or CMake?</p>

I understand why the error is being thrown, i'm trying to work out how to solve it.</p>

<p>To clarify when searching for user_id 1 in location_groups.user_ids the location_id 1 should be returned. When searching for user_id 2 the location_ids 1,2,3 should be returned. </p>

<p>I know this is a complicated query so if anything isn't clear just let me know. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you.</p>

I can successfully obtain a Bearer token, and I can use the token to obtain an individual User Resource and User Resource listing of the entire domain. This all works fine. I have ensured that I'm using the proper scope in the token request (<a href=""https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user</a>).</p>

<p>Problem:
Calls to update a user are returning 200 OK (expected) but the changes are not being picked up.</p>

<p>Using LWP to PUT the update request. Here's a dump of the LWP object after the request comes back. You can see that I'm getting a 200 OK response and a User Resource object as part of the response. You can also see that the returned User Resource does not reflect the changes I've sent in the request. I have confirmed in the admin console for the domain that the changes were not picked up.</p>

<ul>
<li>create a parent form with ""isMdiContainer"" set to ""true""</li>
<li>create a menu strip in in the mdi container</li>
<li>create a child form implementing singleton in order for the form to be shown only once</li>
<li>Add something like the following code to the mdi container:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Myapp
{

public partial class MdiContainer : Form
{
    private module1 Module1Window;
    private module2 Module2Window;
    private module3 Module3Window;

    public FormContainer()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.Module1Window = modul1.getInstance();
        this.Module1Window.MdiParent = this;
        this.Module2Window = modul2.getInstance();
        this.Module2Window.MdiParent = this;
        this.Module3Window = modul3.getInstance();

        this.Module1Window.Show();
    }

    {

<p>}</p>

<p>Now, this obviously works fine. But it is a a pain to maintain. Everytime I want to add another child form I have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>implement Singleton</li>
<li>create the corresponding property in the mdi container</li>
<li>get the instance and set the mdi parent</li>
<li>Hide the new form when other buttons are clicked</li>
<li>Show the form and hide all other Forms when the corresponding button is clicked</li>
</ul>

<p>Whats a more elegant or lets say efficient approach to archive this?</p>

I have a case where I need to dynamically generate test methods and this seems to be what I need. I goal is to have test methods generated based on some files I am testing.</p>

<p>Jeff Wilcox mentions this as a new feature in SL3 ( <a href=""http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/09/rc0-new-test-features/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/09/rc0-new-test-features/</a> , see the dynamic test methods section), but I was unable to find any examples of this.</p>

<p>I don't know how to register my custom test class (it inherits from ITestClass). I looked at the SL4 unit testing source to see how the test class are discovered and I found the following in <strong>UnitTestFrameworkAssembly.cs</strong> <a href=""http://silverlight.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/69329#975967"" rel=""nofollow"">source link</a></p>

I've found a lot of information through google to implement this, which I've followed.  Unfortunately, I get a 403 forbidden error when I try to access the service from my client and IE.</p>

<p>Below are the steps I took to get where I'm at.</p>

<p>I first ran this at the command prompt to create a certification authority:</p>

<pre><code>makecert -sv SignRoot.pvk -cy authority -r signroot.cer -a sha1 -n ""CN=Certification Authority"" -ss my -sr localmachine
</code></pre>

<p>I then copied this new certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store on the local machine.</p>

<p>Next, I created a new certificate using the certification authority:</p>

<pre><code>makecert -iv SignRoot.pvk -ic signroot.cer -cy end -pe -n CN=""X.X.X.X"" -ss my -sr    localmachine -sky exchange -sp ""Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider"" -sy 12
</code></pre>

<p>I copied this certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities and Personal stores for the current user.
Next, I grabbed the thumbprint of this certificate and the app id of my service and configured the port with this SSL certificate:</p>

<pre><code>netsh http add sslcert hostnameport=0.0.0.0:50016 certhash=certificate_hash appid={app_guid}
</code></pre>

<p>I setup the WCF service like this:</p>

<pre><code>Type hostType = Type.GetType(configurationElement.HostTypeDeclaration);
Type contractType = Type.GetType(configurationElement.ContractTypeDeclaration);

Uri baseAddress = new Uri(string.Format(""https://{0}/"", configurationElement.ServiceAddressPort));

ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(hostType, baseAddress);

WSHttpBinding wsHttpBinding = new WSHttpBinding(SecurityMode.Transport, false);
wsHttpBinding.Security.Transport.ClientCredentialType = HttpClientCredentialType.Certificate;

host.AddServiceEndpoint(contractType, wsHttpBinding,
            string.Format(""{0}{1}"", baseAddress, configurationElement.EndpointName));

host.Credentials.ServiceCertificate.SetCertificate(StoreLocation.LocalMachine, StoreName.My, X509FindType.FindBySubjectName, ""X.X.X.X"");

host.Credentials.ClientCertificate.SetCertificate(StoreLocation.LocalMachine, StoreName.My, X509FindType.FindBySubjectName, ""X.X.X.X"");

host.Credentials.ClientCertificate.Authentication.CertificateValidationMode = System.ServiceModel.Security.X509CertificateValidationMode.None;

host.Open();
</code></pre>

<p>From the client side, I'm calling the service like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (WcfServiceClient&lt;IWcfService&gt; serviceClient = WcfServiceClient&lt;IWcfService&gt;.Create())
{
    serviceClient.ClientCredentials.ClientCertificate.SetCertificate(
                            StoreLocation.LocalMachine,
                            StoreName.My,
                            X509FindType.FindBySubjectName,
                            ""X.X.X.X"");                        

    bool = serviceClient.Instance.SomeMethod(string.Empty);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The server and client are both running on the same machine for now, but this service will be called from other machines in the end.  The server is running Windows Server 2012.  If I change the HttpClientCredentialType to None, everything works fine.  With it set to None, I also tried connecting from another machine and it failed, which is correct, because of the missing certificate.  I installed the certificate on that machine, and it worked.  I don't understand why I get error 403 forbidden using credential type = Certificate though.</p>

I am trying to write a test file for a class in another file (All in Python btw) and I get a NameError: global variable <em>name here</em> undefined. I'll show you some example code of what Im doing.</p>

<pre><code>import unittest

class TestFile(unittest.TestCase):

    def object_test_setup(self, elements): 
        s = CustomClass() #from imported File, have to import items this way.
        for item in elements:
            a.insert(item)
        return (a)

    def test_contains_tuple_element(self):
        '''Return True iff CustomClass contains tuple element'''
        custom_object = object_test_setup([1, ""string!"", (""TUP"", ""LE"")])
        element = (""TUP"", ""LE"")
        self.assertTrue(custom_object.__contains__(element)) # __contains__ is defined in File
</code></pre>

<p>yeah so the object gets initialized just fine, all the methods in the imported file work on the object, but for some reason my NameError says <code>NameError: global name 'object_test_setup' is not defined</code></p>

<p>which I dont understand because everything is imported works in that file, I believe I imported correctly and the global NameError is from a function within the class itself. why wont this work? All help is much appreciated!</p>

<p>I opened an instance of ofstream, and I need to output a header like so:</p>

<p>Now I need to get all of this in the first 519 bytes of a file, the rest of the content varies, how would I go around copying this header into my file?</p>

<p>I preferably want to do this using the ofstream class, but I'm also fine with the original C library. I've been at this for 2 hours now, and I've not gotten anywhere yet and trying to search on Google doesn't help much either.</p>

The application loads XML from the internet and tries to store the objects generated from the parsed results in the data model. This used to work fine, until a few days ago. I changed the data model (added one property on an object), so I made a new version and ran mogenerator to generate new stub classes for the objects in the model. Most of it still works fine, but there are some odd errors in code that used to work perfectly.</p>

<p>During the parsing of the XML an object is created and values on it are filled in. One of the values is an URL for an image. In the data model this value may not be NIL, but in the XML it occasionaly is. I use validateForInsert on the item to check if I can commit it. This is the part that used to work fine, but now fails, complaining about the NIL value.</p>

<p>A bit of code from the parser:</p>

<pre><code>...
    currentItem = [[[MyItem alloc] initWithEntity:[self.dataModel entityByName:@""MyItem""] insertIntoManagedObjectContext:self.dataModel.managedObjectContext] autorelease];
    currentItem.label = [attributeDict objectForKey:LABEL];
    currentItem.paramString = [attributeDict objectForKey:QUERY_STRING];
    [currentItem setSortOrderValue:[[currentRootItem items] count]];

    [currentRootItem addItemsObject:currentItem];
} else if ([elementName isEqualToString:IMAGE]) {
    currentItem.imageLocation = [attributeDict objectForKey:IMAGE_URL];
...
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when the document is parsed, I do the check:</p>

<pre><code>...
    {
        NSArray *Items = [[myRootItem items] allObjects];
        for (MyItem *item in Items) {
            NSLog(@""%@"", item);
            NSLog(@""before"");
            NSLog(@""%d"", [item validateForInsert:&amp;validationError]);
            NSLog(@""after"");
            if (![item validateForInsert:&amp;validationError]) {
                [[self.dataModel managedObjectContext] deleteObject:item];
            }
        }
    }
...
</code></pre>

<p>This used to work just fine, but now it crashes in validateForInsert:</p>

<p>I can't figure out what went wrong. As far as I know making a new version of the data model went right (using XCode), setting it to the current version etc, all went right. I didn't have these problems the last time I did all this...</p>

<p>The only thing different is that now I upgraded to XCode 3.2.6, from 3.2.5 or 3.2.4, I don't remember.</p>

<p>My target is iPhone, and I'm using the 4.3 iOS SDK that came with this version of XCode.</p>

We developed an app using MFP v6.3. Using MFP CLI v6.3, we can restart, build and deploy all assets (WAR, adapters, and apps) without any problems.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> 
Using MFP CLI v7.0 to deploy the MFP v6.3 adapters and apps is not working. Below, I am including most of the from executing 'mfp restart'; note that the exit code is 1. I also included the output of 'mfp bd'. It seems the only MFP asset that gets deployed is the WAR file; MFP adapters and apps are not deployed. Bringing the MFP console also confirms this.</p>

<p>3 - If there isn't a proper solution, how do I catch this particular Exception?  (Bad practice I know, but the crashing needs to be stopped, and since the activity reconstructs itself properly after being destroyed, it wouldn't matter anyway.</p>

<p>... And please for the love of all that is holy, do not suggest that I add <code>android:configChanges=""orientation""</code> to my activity declaration.  It amazes me how often that is accepted as the official fix-all for orientation issues.</p>

<p><strong>Edit with temporary workaround</strong></p>

<p>For anybody interested I managed to at least stop the crashing by subclassing spinner and overriding <code>onDetachedFromWindow()</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>public static class CatchingSpinner extends Spinner
{
    public CatchingSpinner(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) 
    {
        super(context, attrs);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDetachedFromWindow()
    {
        try
        {
            super.onDetachedFromWindow();
        }
        catch (IllegalArgumentException e)
        {
            // do whatever
        }
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, a workaround.  Still working on a solution.  :/</p>

However, before the product is on display, it needs an active permission, so I want to add a third model, <code>Permission</code>, to said construct.</p>

<p>I formulated following sentence to make the thinking process easier:
One <code>User</code> has_many <code>Product</code>s, each of which has_one <code>Permission</code>.</p>

<p>The ActiveRecord associations look like this right now:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
  has_many :permissions
end

class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  has_one :permission
end

class Permission &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :product
  belongs_to :user
end
</code></pre>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>is this the correct approach (does it actually work?)</li>
<li>is it necessary to declare that <code>User</code> has_many permissions and <code>Permission</code> belongs_to user if I never need to list all permissions of a user in my app?</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to ask you guys for confirmation if my thoughts are correct or if it's wrong or if there is a better way to master my problem and I hope the question is also useful to others, thanks!</p>

<p>A dump of my session looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Array ( [username] =&gt; test@test.com [key] =&gt; 1 )

<p>The shopping cart has three buttons:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name='cartForm' action='cart.php' method='post'&gt;
&lt;input type='image' value='submit' name='continueshopping' src='x.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;input type='image' value='submit' name='update' src='y.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;input type='image' value='submit' name='checkout' src='z.jpg' /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>whenever I press one of the buttons, the page re-loads and does what it needs to (ie remove or add an item)... but the session array gets changed to the following (depending on the button pushed)</p>

<pre><code>Array ( [username] =&gt; test@test.com [key] =&gt; continueshopping_y )
Array ( [username] =&gt; test@test.com [key] =&gt; update_y )
Array ( [username] =&gt; test@test.com [key] =&gt; checkout_y )
</code></pre>

<p>Is [key] a reserved word? Why would the value of $_SESSION['key'] be overwritten from a form that just POSTs everything? This is a problem for our project as we were storing user account IDs in [key], but the value is overwritten each time a button is pushed in the cart.</p>

<p>The actual code is pretty long, and posting it here wouldn't be practical. Wouldn't know what to post, as the cart never interacts with the session other than to grab the session_id(). Really I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar. I can't re-create the problem on my local server (PHP5), only exists on the live server (PHP4).</p>

The trouble is that this code programmed it long ago and following tutorials.
I tried to pass the JQuery format but does not work in any way, do not know if some kind soul can guide me how to do it.</p>

<p>The code is as follows:</p>

<p>These functions define three parameters and sends them to another function called ""get_ajax"":</p>

<pre><code>function resultado(contenido){
    var url='ajax/buscar.php?'+ contenido +'';// Get content
    var capa='resultado';
    var metodo='get';
    get_ajax(url,capa,metodo);
}
function paginas(contenido){
    var url='ajax/paginar.php?'+ contenido +'';// Get pages
    var capa='paginas';
    var metodo='get';
    get_ajax(url,capa,metodo);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then created the Ajax object:</p>

<pre><code>function creaAjax(){
    var objetoAjax=false;
    try{objetoAjax = new ActiveXObject(""Msxml2.XMLHTTP"");}
    catch(e){try {objetoAjax = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");} 
    catch (E){objetoAjax = false;}}
    if(!objetoAjax &amp;&amp; typeof XMLHttpRequest!='undefined') {
        objetoAjax = new XMLHttpRequest();}
    return objetoAjax;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally defined ""get_ajax"" function with the variables defined in the ""result"" functions and ""pages"":</p>

<pre><code>function get_ajax(url,capa,metodo){ 
    var ajax=creaAjax();
    var capaContenedora = document.getElementById(capa);
    if (metodo.toUpperCase()=='GET'){
        ajax.open ('GET', url, true);
        ajax.onreadystatechange = function() {
            if (ajax.readyState==1){
                capaContenedora.innerHTML= ""&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\""imagenes/down.gif\"" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color='000000'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loading...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;"";
            } else if (ajax.readyState==4){ 
                if(ajax.status==200){               
                    document.getElementById(capa).innerHTML=ajax.responseText; 
                }else if(ajax.status==404){
                    capaContenedora.innerHTML = ""&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;H2&gt;&lt;B&gt;ERROR 404&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;0 RESULTS&lt;/CENTER&gt;"";
                } else {
                    capaContenedora.innerHTML = ""Error: "".ajax.status;
                }
            } // ****
        }
        ajax.setRequestHeader('Content-Type','application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
        ajax.send(null);
        return
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The results of carrying on a ""div"" calling a javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""table-responsive""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"" name=""resultado"" id=""resultado""&gt;
        &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
            resultado('q=&lt;?=$q?&gt;&amp;p=&lt;?=$p?&gt;');
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I think this last one is the least.
I've been trying to change the ""get_ajax"" function to make it to corde a JQuery syntax pero it does not work.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edit:
I tried changing the ""get ajax"" function, I know that the code you are totally wrong, but I have almost no experience with JQuery, I read the manual and know that for each state there is a different role, but this time I wanted to test directly with ""success "".</p>

<pre><code>function get_ajax(url,capa,metodo){
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $('#resultado').hide();
        $('#form').submit(function(evento){
            $('#resultado').hide();        
            evento.preventDefault();
            var datos_formulario = $(this).serialize();        
            $.ajax({
                url: url,
                data: datos_formulario, //I don't know

                success: function(response){
                    $(capa).html(response);
                }
            });

        });

Initially, followed the theory in <a href=""http://dranger.com/ffmpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> page to get an idea about the entire program and the usage of libraries. After coding from scratch, thanks to that tutorial and many other resources,  finally I made my code work, using the latest libraries of ffmpeg and SDL (2.0). But my code lacks a proper synchronization mechanism (actually it lacks a sync mechanism !).  </p>

<p>I still don't have a clear idea on how to synchronize the audio and video together as the theory provided in the link is only <em>very partially</em> correct (atleast when it comes to using the latest dev libraries).<br>
For example, a sentence in <a href=""http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/tutorial05.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> page is as follows : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, ffmpeg reorders the packets so that the DTS of the packet being processed by avcodec_decode_video() will always be the same as the PTS of the frame it returns.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am using <em>avcodec_decode_video2()</em> and the DTS of the packet is definitely not the same as pts of the frame it decodes (in general).</p>

<p>I read <a href=""http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1996-02.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> very informative BBC report and it makes complete sense. I have a clear idea about PTS and DTS. But the PTS and DTS values that ffmpeg is using for packets and decoded frames is confusing. I wish there were some documentation on that aspect.  </p>

<p>Can someone explain the steps to synchronize audio and video ? I only need the steps. I am quite comfortable implementing them. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks !  </p>

<p>I have a form where I want to validate. I found a site <a href=""http://www.asp.net/web-pages/tutorials/working-with-pages/validating-user-input-in-aspnet-web-pages-sites"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that explains how to do this with a Razor view, but the Validation class does not have the methods shown in the example. I then came across the <code>required</code> attribute in HTML5, and I added that to each <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> in my form. This is validating the form when I submit it, but it is using generic error messages like shown in the image:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bu3Sw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<p><strong>Is there some way to customize these messages?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is there some way to validate other requirements besides <code>required</code> - like making sure its a number, or a certain length, etc?</strong></p>

<p><em>Note</em>* I am not using MVC, so no models, etc. I also was trying to use something built in to ASP.NET if possible, and not use jQuery Validation directly. </p>

This way each business object does not need to have a method to populate it with data or construct its data set.

<p>Now to the question. I always assumed that because C# getters/setters are really methods in disguise then reading public field must be faster than calling a getter.</p>

<p>So to make sure I did a test (the code below). However this test only produces expected results (ie <strong>fields are faster than getters at 34%</strong>) <strong>if</strong> you run it from inside Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Once you run it from command line it shows pretty much the same timing...</p>

<p>As you can see, adding the run_date column to the end of the ""rowname"" composite column renders the entire composite blank...which is crazy. 
If I populate run_date with dummy data, it will show up....but if it is blank or null, this causes the ""rowname"" to go blank. </p>

<p>I cannot tell if this is a bug in postgres, but it is a bizarre result that I would like to resolve, if possible.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

std::atomic&lt;std::string*&gt; ptr;
int data;

void producer()
{
    std::string* p = new std::string(""Hello"");
    ptr.store(p, std::memory_order_release);
}

void consumer()
{
    std::string* p2;
    while (!(p2 = ptr.load(std::memory_order_consume)))
        ;
    assert(*p2 == ""Hello""); // never fires: *p2 carries dependency from ptr

    // yea well, it actually uses p2 for quite a while probably....
}

int main()
{
    std::thread t1(producer);
    std::thread t2(consumer);
    t1.join(); t2.join();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I would like to change the behavior of the producer code just a bit. Instead of simply setting a string, I'd like it to <em>overwrite</em> a string. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>void producer()
{
    std::string* p = new std::string(""Hello"");
    ptr.store(p, std::memory_order_release);

    // do some stuff

    std::string* p2 = new std::string(""Sorry, should have been Hello World"");
    ptr.store(p2, std::memory_order_release);

    // **
}
</code></pre>

<p>The producer here is responsible for the generation of the strings, which means that in my simple world it should also be responsible for the destruction of these strings. </p>

<p>In the line marked with '**' we should therefore destroy string 'p', which is what this question is about.</p>

<p>The solution you might consider would be to add (at the marked line):</p>

<pre><code>delete p;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this will break the program, since the consumer might be using the string after we've deleted it -- after all, the consumer uses a pointer. Also, this implies that the producer waits for the consumer, which isn't necessary - we just want our old memory to be cleaned up. Using a ref counting smart pointer seems to be out of the question, since atomic only supports that many types.</p>

<p>What's the best (most efficient) way to fix this?</p>

I've used it successfully in several places in my app, but I run into problems when I try to edit elements that are inside other directives. </p>

<p>As the directives are calling the elements one by one, as in the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;my-continent text='{{questions.n2A.answer.1.name}}' continent-id=""1""&gt;&lt;/my-continent&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see how can I implement the reusable directive in them, as it generates a general block of html code, not a specific one for each element called with the directive my continent. </p>

<p>I've created a <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/aYbtFYvKo3Y4SXAud5mA?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"">Plunker</a> where the problem is visible.</p>

<p>If I add the click-to-edit directive into my-continent, it breakes. You can see what I mean on line 47 of the html, when I add click-to-edit=""questions.n2A.answer.1.name"" onto the line as shown under.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;my-continent text='{{questions.n2A.answer.1.name}}' continent-id=""1"" click-to-edit=""questions.n2A.answer.1.name""&gt;&lt;/my-continent&gt;

<pre><code>stud_record = Student.objects.filter()
</code></pre>

<p>Thus stud_record is a queryset.</p>

<p>Now what I want to do is, i want to calculate the total num of stud_record, and then divide it by 5. </p>

<p>For ex: I have 20 records in <code>stud_record</code>. After dividing by 5 I got 4 each. So now i want to rank the first four students as ran 1, then from 5-8 students as rank 2....16-20 students as rank 5. This rank will be inserted to the same <code>stud_record</code> and will be send to the template page.</p>

<p>How can we do it.</p>

<p>Currently I am getting the structure like this</p>

<pre><code>[{'name': u'mark', 'roll': 71}, 
 {'name': u'robin', 'roll': 42}, 
 {'name': u'julien', 'roll': 39}]
</code></pre>

<p>After division and inserting the rank it should look like </p>

<pre><code>[[{'name': u'mark', 'roll': 71, 'rank': 1}, 
  {'name': u'robin', 'roll': 42, 'rank': 1},] 
 [{'name': u'julien', 'roll': 39, 'rank': 2}]]
</code></pre>

<p>Right now I am getting 185 results in my stud_record. After dividing 185/5 i am getting 37 as result. Now i want to give rank 1 to 1-37 students, then rank 2 to 38-75 students... like this</p>

<p>because ABS has the same jar.<br>
I managed once to just delete <code>android-support-v4.jar</code> from the <code>/libs</code> folder and everything went fine, but with every new project I create it doesnt work, Eclipse won't let me delete that jar: </p>

<p>I havent been doing anything differently when creating the one project where the deletion of the jar from <code>/libs</code> worked fine. Is there some workaround or am I doing something completely wrong?</p>

BTW, that second post incorporates the fix I came with to the problem described in this post, namely setting <code>STDOUT</code>'s encoding explicitly within the script, using <code>binmode</code>.]</p>

<hr>

<p>I'll use the short demo script below to illustrate the problem.</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
use strict;
use feature 'unicode_strings';
use POSIX 'locale_h';
use locale;
use utf8;

setlocale( LC_CTYPE, 'de_DE.UTF-8' );

my $non_ascii = 'ßäöüÄÖÜ';
print ""$non_ascii\n"";

my @non_ascii = split //, $non_ascii;
print ""$_\n"" for @non_ascii;

$DB::single = 1; 1;  # return control to DB
</code></pre>

<p>(The last line is effectively a breakpoint.)</p>

<p>OK, now I run this under the Perl debugger:</p>

<pre><code>% perl -C -d dbtest.pl

Enter h or 'h h' for help, or 'man perldebug' for more help.

</code></pre>

<p>So far so good: the script produced the expected output, and now the debugger has entered into single-step mode, and is waiting for input.</p>

<p>If I now just restart the debugger with <code>R</code>, and run the script again (with <code>c</code>, <em>exactly as before</em>), this is what happens:</p>

<p>My server is debian 7.7 with apache2.2. I have a lot of vhost and one SSL cert. All Domains are pointing to the same directory (/var/www/www). For example i have the following domains:</p>

<ul>
<li>www.domain.gv.at</li>
<li>www.domain.at</li>
<li>www.example.at</li>
<li>www.anotherexample.at</li>
</ul>

<p>I would moving all .htaccess stuff to their vhost. </p>

<p>First of all i would redirect www.domain.gv.at www.domain.at domain.gv.at domain.at to https. My .htaccess file looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.domain\.gv\.at [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain\.gv\.at [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain\.at [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.domain.at/$1 [R=301,L]
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R=301,L]
</code></pre>

<p>also I would like pretty URL (i.e. <a href=""https://www.domain.at/cool/page"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.domain.at/cool/page</a>) so i have the following in my .htaccess</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^/typo3$ - [L]
RewriteRule ^/typo3/.*$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l

<p>Now I'm trying to copy all in my vHost config without success. My vHost (port 80) looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;

<p>But it doesn't work. Some ideas?</p>

<p>Goals
- delete .htaccess (I don't want to use it)
- redirect domain.at and domain.gv.at to https://
- use pretty urls for typo3</p>

"12979696","1","14279659","","2012-10-19 17:48:14","","5","2503","<p>I am trying to find a solution that will allow me to rotate point sprites about the z-axis with a varying attribute (i.e. uniform will not do).</p>

<p>In my app I have many hundreds/thousands of point sprites being drawn per frame, which are then stored in VBOs (can quite feasibly end up being >1,000,000). As such, I am looking for the best compromise between memory usage and performance.</p>

<p>Vertex &amp; fragment shaders current look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// VERTEX SHADER
attribute vec4 a_position;
attribute vec4 a_color;
attribute float a_size;
uniform mat4 u_mvpMatrix;
varying vec4 v_color;

void main()
{
    v_color = a_color;
    gl_Position = u_mvpMatrix * a_position;
    gl_PointSize = a_size;
}


// FRAGMENT SHADER
precision mediump float;
uniform sampler2D s_texture;
varying vec4 v_color;

void main()
{
    vec4 textureColor = texture2D(s_texture, gl_PointCoord);
    gl_FragColor = v_color * textureColor;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can currently imagine the following possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a <code>mat4 rotMatrix</code> attribute to my point sprite data. Pass this to the fragment shader and rotate each fragment:</p>

<pre><code>vec2 texCoord = (rotMatrix * vec4(gl_PointCoord, 0, 1)).xy
gl_FragColor = v_color * texture2D(s_texture, texCoord);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Advantages:
<ul>
<li>Keeps shaders simple.</li>
<li>Simple code to compute matrices outside the shaders (using <code>GLKit</code> for example).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Massively increases the size of my point sprite data (from 16 to 80 bytes/point for a 4x4 matrix; to 52 bytes/point for a 3x3 matrix... I believe it's possible to use a 3x3 rotation matrix?). This could potentially cause my app to crash 3-5 times sooner!</li>
<li>Pushes a lot more computation onto the CPU (hundreds/thousands of matrix calculations per frame).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a <code>float angle</code> attribute to my point sprite data, then calculate the rotation matrix in the vertex shader. Pass the rotation matrix to the fragment shader as above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Advantages:<br>
<ul>
<li>Keeps point sprite data size small (from 16 to 20 bytes/point).<br></li>
<li>Pushes the heavy lifting matrix maths to the GPU.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Need to write custom GLSL function to create rotation matrix. Not a massive problem, but my matrix maths is rusty, so this could be error prone, especially if I'm trying to figure out the 3x3 matrix solution...</li>
<li>Given that this must happen on hundreds/thousands of vertices, is this going to be a serious drag on performance (despite being handled by the GPU)?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<ul>
<li>I could realistically cope with 1 byte for the angle attribute (255 different angles would be sufficient). Is there any way I could use some kind of lookup so that I don't need to needlessly recalculate the same rotation matrices? Storing constants in the vertex shader was my first thought, but I don't want to start putting branch statements in my shaders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any thoughts as to a good approach?</p>

<p>Now I want if current day is monday and time is between 10:00 and 14:00, out should be ""this is first link monday"" (first option). Similarly if current time is even greate than 20:00 and less than 10:00, it should show <code>last option</code>. (dinner menu till tomorrow morning 10:00).</p>

<p>Here is my PHP code.</p>

<pre><code>echo $t=date('d-m-Y H:i:s'); echo '&lt;br&gt;';
echo $day = date(""D"",strtotime($t)); echo '&lt;br&gt;';
echo $time = date(""H:i"",strtotime($t)); echo '&lt;br&gt;';

   {
    foreach($Day-&gt;options as $options)
    {

        {
            echo $options; echo '&lt;br&gt;';
        }

     }
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>For now it just find option time less than current time, but not in between etc.</p>

<p>Right now the condition <code>$options-&gt;attributes() &lt; $time</code> give me that option whose time is less than current time. But if current time is 15:00, it will give me two options in output 10:00 and 14:00, but I need one that is 14:00. 
If my question is not clear, kindly ask me.

When pausing (or seeking) and then resuming playback, the <code>MediaPlayer</code>'s position is unpredictable and will often jump ahead of the <code>MediaCodec</code> decoder by 100-500 ms.</p>

<p>In my application, the decoder is handling H.264 video frames and the <code>MediaPlayer</code> is playing AAC audio. Both have been initialized with the same on-device MP4 file.</p>

<p>Some observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Playback from the beginning of the file (without pausing or seeking) works fine</li>
<li>The audio nearly always jumps ahead of the video after seeking or pausing</li>
<li>Profiling showed that the ""jump"" appears to happen just after resuming playback; prior to resuming, both components report the same playback position. Just after resuming, there is a large and sudden change in the <code>MediaPlayer</code>'s position.</li>
<li>The audio remains ahead of the video by a constant amount after the jump</li>
</ul>

<p>Letting each component use its own identical copy of the MP4 works fine, and that's how I solved the problem for now. I am aware that <code>MediaCodec</code> can be used to process audio, but I would prefer to avoid that approach.</p>

<p>After combing through the relevant AOSP code (<a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/media/java/android/media/MediaCodec.java"" rel=""nofollow"">MediaCodec</a>, <a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/media/java/android/media/MediaPlayer.java"" rel=""nofollow"">MediaPlayer</a>, and some JNI classes), it isn't clear to me how these components would be interfering with one another. Do they share a low-level Binder object? Is the <code>MediaPlayer</code> somehow (re)using the cursor that the <code>MediaCodec</code> decoder is using to fill its input buffers?</p>

What's the right way to handle a Ctrl-C event sent over Telnet  on the server side?</p>

<p><strong>Long Question</strong><br>
After calling recv() on a socket, I'd like to handle some situations appropriately. One of them is to return a certain error code when Ctrl-C was received. What's the correct way to detect this? The following works, but it just doesn't seem right:</p>

<pre><code>size_t recv_count;
static char ctrl_c[5] = {0xff, 0xf4, 0xff, 0xfd, 0x06};

recv_count = recv(socket, buffer, buffer_size, 0);

if (recv_count == sizeof(ctrl_c) &amp;&amp;
    memcmp(buffer, ctrl_c, sizeof(ctrl_c) == 0)
{
    return CTRL_C_RECEIVED;
}

<p>I found a comment on Ctrl-C in a side-note in <a href=""http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/unix-socket-faq/unix-socket-faq-2.html#ss2.11"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> UNIX Socket FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] (by the way, out-of-band is often used for that ctrl-C, too).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I understand, receiving out-of-band data is done using recv() with a certain flag as the last parameter. But when I'm waiting for data using recv() as I do in the code above, I can't read out-of-band data at the same time. Apart from that, I'm getting <em>something</em> using recv() without that oob-flag.</p>

<p>In Backbone, this is how I might cache my jQuery objects:</p>

<p>...where, in my events, I could bind a click event to a cached element. However, the above syntax does not work. I suspect there <em>may</em> be some way to ""officially"" define sub-elements, so that I <em>could</em> use some syntax akin to what is above.</p>

<p>The layout LOOKS correct, but the image tag is centering itself inside of the anchor div by adding margin to either side. This expands the anchor tag's horizontal size, and clickable area, to the width of the whole page.</p>

<p>I saw another approach that uses display:table-cell; on the containing div (the anchor in this case) and but then I can't use the margin: 0 auto; trick to center the containing div.</p>

<p>My goal is to make the anchor div be centered in the page, and it's clickable area to be set to the size of the image. I think my primary problem is that the img nested inside of the anchor doesn't give the anchor tag any width. If I do this.</p>

<p>It works! But <strong>I don't want to have to specify the width of the image inside of the anchor tag</strong>. The page already has this information!</p>

<p>EDIT - This last link ""works"" but I'm DO NOT want the width:1000px; in the anchor div. If I change the image later, which might have a different width, I'd then have to change the width of the anchor tag. I'd like the anchor tag to encompass the img without any human intervention.</p>

<p>I'm using Qt 4.7.0 (32 bit) from Qt SDK v2010.05 on Windows 7 (64 bit), g++ (GCC) 4.5.1 from MinGW, NetBeans 6.9.1.
But I also cheked this with g++ 3.4.5 (also from MinGW) and Qt Creator 2.0.1 - same strange behavior.</p>

<p>For example (simplest case):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;Qt/QApplication.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

using namespace std;


int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    QApplication app(argc, argv);

    try {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Before exception"" &lt;&lt; endl;
        throw runtime_error(""Exception occured"");
        cout &lt;&lt; ""After exception"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    } catch (runtime_error&amp; exc) {
        cout &lt;&lt; exc.what() &lt;&lt; endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I execute above program I've got this output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before exception</p>
  
  <p>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.<br>
  Please contact the application's support team for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've tried to add flag ""-fexceptions"" to g++ but it hasn't changed anything.</p>

<p>When I don't use Qt, everything is OK:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;Qt/QApplication.h&gt; // It is not caused only by including Qt header
                             // so it doesn't matter if I comment this out or not
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

using namespace std;


int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // QApplication app(argc, argv);

    try {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Before exception"" &lt;&lt; endl;
        throw runtime_error(""Exception occured"");
        cout &lt;&lt; ""After exception"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    } catch (runtime_error&amp; exc) {
        cout &lt;&lt; exc.what() &lt;&lt; endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before exception<br>
  Exception occured</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does anybody know why is this happen that way and how to fix this? Has it something to do with type of exception handling method (SJLJ or Dwarf-2) used when Qt was build?</p>

    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

<p>and restarted nginx</p>

<p>all the above is working as when I go to <a href=""http://example.com/socket-app"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/socket-app</a> I get ""Hello World"" printed on the screen.</p>

<p>So far so good!</p>

<p>Now for the socket.io setup</p>

<p>I used the <a href=""http://socket.io/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">code snippets from Socket.IO</a> in the ""Using with Node http server"" section replacing the port number with <code>8080</code>:</p>

<p>app.js:</p>

<pre><code>var app = require('http').createServer(handler)
var io = require('socket.io')(app);
var fs = require('fs');

app.listen(8080);

function handler (req, res) {

        if (err) {
            res.writeHead(500);

        }

        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end(data);
    });
}

io.on('connection', function (socket) {
    socket.emit('news', { hello: 'world' });
    socket.on('my other event', function (data) {
        console.log(data);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>index.html:</p>

I think that most of web developers use their workstation for running their servers, Apache, Tomcat, Mongrel etc. I have been working in a company that have a Unix development server in another city, with the document root folder share with samba. I am still developing on my Windows PC because to use IDE like Eclipse PDT and RubyMine requires a fast access to the file system and because I want to try things on my own without bothering with helpdesk tickets and stuff like that. I prefer to run my tools, install/uninstall software easily.</p>

<p>The main problem is that I am forced to use Windows and I cannot develop on a simialr environment to Unix. For instance on production we have Passenger, in Windows Passenger cannot be used and since I have a shared environment, PHP/Rails, in development I have Rails URLs with <a href=""http://localhost:3000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:3000/</a> and for PHP just <a href=""http://localhost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost</a>, on the production I just have <a href=""http://domain.com/apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domain.com/apps</a> for Rails and <a href=""http://domain.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domain.com/</a></p>

<p>So do you run your developemnt server in your workstation or on a remote server?</p>

<p>I would like to have a confirmation that my practice is the most adopted. Thanks. </p>

However, <code>libgcc_so.1</code> is not available in my toolchain, and when I try to use <em>_Unwind_backtrace</em> directly, I get a stack trace of only 1 frame (the topmost one, from the function calling <em>_Unwind_Backtrace</em>.</p>

<p>This just blindly walks up the frame chain, without any bounds checking or sanity checking. I'd like to use something safer than that.</p>

<p>I have a WPF app with a main window in full screen. It launches new windows in full screen and makes them a child of the main window upon some user interactions. If the user's machine only has a single monitor this child window is supposed to be the focus until closed. However, I have found that using Windows Aero if the user hovers over my application's taskbar icon a preview of both windows appear. This in itself is not an issue except if you try to select the main window of the app nothing happens because the child window is always on top but the peek functionality gives the illusion that the user can switch to the main window and it looks like a bug.</p>

<p>I would like to detect which window the user is selecting and, if it is the main window, simply close the child window. Alternatively I would like Aero to stop showing multiple windows if only one will work.</p>

<p>Actually i need to set this <code>SSLSocketFactory</code> on the <code>HttpsURLConnection</code> before connecting. But when i try to set it on <code>HttpsURLConnection</code> by calling</p>

<pre><code>(HttpsURLConnection )connection.setSSLSocketFactory(trusted);

However, I get the subject error every time I try to start the service.
I am able to successfully run the service in the debugger and everything works fine.
I have also adjusted the timeout as described here <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824344"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824344</a> to no avail.
Below is my Program.cs file:</p>

<pre><code>    namespace PlantMonitor
{
    static class Program
    {
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// The main entry point for the application.
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;

            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(System.Threading.Timeout.Infinite);
#endif
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and here is my Service1.cs file:</p>

<pre><code>namespace PlantMonitor
{
    public partial class Service1 : ServiceBase
    {
        //declare the SetServiceStatus function by using platform invoke
        [DllImport(""advapi32.dll"", SetLastError = true)]
.
.
.
 public void StartUp()
        {
            OnStart(null);
        }


        protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
        {
            //startup stuff

            // Update the service state to Start Pending.
            ServiceStatus serviceStatus = new ServiceStatus();
            serviceStatus.dwCurrentState = ServiceState.SERVICE_START_PENDING;
            serviceStatus.dwWaitHint = 180000;
            SetServiceStatus(this.ServiceHandle, ref serviceStatus);
            //ConnectionState
            eventLog1.WriteEntry(""In OnStart"");



            // Set up a timer to trigger every minute.

            timer.Interval = 10000; // 10 seconds
            timer.Elapsed += new System.Timers.ElapsedEventHandler(this.OnTimer);
            timer.Start();

            //Confrim Timer success
            eventLog1.WriteEntry(""Timer Success"");

            // Update the service state to Running.
            serviceStatus.dwCurrentState = ServiceState.SERVICE_RUNNING;
            SetServiceStatus(this.ServiceHandle, ref serviceStatus);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I set the timer to 10 seconds initially to begin the first iteration of the main code contained in OnTimer and adjust the timer.Interval to 3 min once I step inside OnTimer.
When I try to start the service I can see that it reports events to the log file that exist within the OnTimer method.</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at writing a service, but I would have expected the service to be considered ""running"" once it hits this line of code:</p>

<pre><code>// Update the service state to Running.
            serviceStatus.dwCurrentState = ServiceState.SERVICE_RUNNING;
            SetServiceStatus(this.ServiceHandle, ref serviceStatus);
</code></pre>

<p>When I run it in the debugger, it always reaches this line of code prior to firing OnTimer. Am I not updating the service state correctly?</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> Upon review of the event log, it appears that the service continues to run through the OnTimer event, even after the Service Manager throws the subject error. However, once it completes the OnTimer method once, the service is stopped.</p>

<p>The problem i am facing is i cant get a foreign key from Attraction to Imagemetadata. If I try to make a two way foreign key import error occurs. ( Cyclic imports not allowed in Python).
And because of the structure of admin , there cant be a foreign key just from Attraction to ImageMetadata, as Django doesnt allow that. </p>

<p>Is there a way to make the foreign key point from Attraction to ImageMetadata, without changing the structure of admin ?</p>

<p>I think a better approach would be to have a deploy branch created from master which only has the two folders.  When deploy would be needed the only a sync from master would need to be done.

Finally everything works fine, except for std::thread. I just use this for a simple render Thread and the code works in Visual Studio on Windows. But when I try to run the Code:
<br>
<br>
<code>std::thread renderThread(render);</code>
<br>
<br>
on Linux in Eclipse, there is a Error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[xcb] Unknown request in queue while dequeuing<br>
  [xcb] Most likely this is a multi-threaded client and XInitThreads has not been called<br>
  [xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And even if I add a ""XInitThreads()"" call before creating the Thread, the same error message shows up a few seconds after starting.
<br>
I already linked the pthread library and added ""-pthread"" to the compiler options.
<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for all advices and every kind of help.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Edit:</strong>
<br>
<br>
Code Snippet:</p>

<pre><code>XInitThreads();

sf::ContextSettings settings;
settings.depthBits = 32;
settings.stencilBits = 32;
window.create(sf::VideoMode(1120, 630), ""TITLE"", sf::Style::Default, settings);
window.setVerticalSyncEnabled(true);
window.clear(COLOR);
window.display();
initStartup();  //loading Resources (.png, font...)
startscreen-&gt;phaseStarted = myClock.getElapsedTime().asMilliseconds();

window.setActive(false);

sf::Thread renderThread(render);
renderThread.launch();`
</code></pre>

<p><br>
<br>
<strong>Edit 2:</strong>
<br>
<br>
I commented out my event handling loop <code>while (window.pollEvent(event)) {</code>
<br>
and one <code>sf::Mouse::getPosition(window)</code> call
<br>
<br>
And the error is gone.</p>

<p>How can I send the data from the current table row (the one next to which the button has been clicked) in an ajax request and how can I retrieve it on the server side afterwards?
I tried calling request.data but I get only an empty string. I tried request.form in the DELETE request and this gives me ImmutableMultiDict([]). Any tips? I'm currently using Flask as the web framework. Thanks!</p>

<p>My filter function is this </p>

<pre><code>private void newFilter(String age){
    RowFilter&lt;DefaultTableModel,Object&gt; rf = null;
    try{
        rf = RowFilter.regexFilter(""20"");
        }catch(java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException e){
        return;
    }
    sorter.setRowFilter(rf);
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT :  In the Table there are only the results , that should appear ! The ckeckboxes are outside the Jtable and are used only for filters , for example if I check the checkbox 20 in the table will appear only people with age 20 , but if I check age 20 and age 40 in the table will appear only the people with age of 40 and also with age 20 !</p>

but because I am dealing with sorting the array based on the numeric value in the struct, memcpy works for me so far.</p>

<p>The computer I'm using to execute this code has a Pentium 1.6Ghz Processor and when I change sz in the main function to at least 20000, I notice I have to wait two seconds to see the results on the screen. </p>

<p>The reason why I'm testing large numbers is because I want to process server logs in C and will be sorting information by timestamps and sometimes the logs can become very large, and I don't want to put too much strain on the CPU as it is running other processes already such as apache.</p>

<p>Is there anyway I can improve this code so I don't have to wait two seconds to see 20000 structs sorted?</p>

So my question is : is there any method by which when box moves down it automatically helps user to scroll down just by that animation only ? 
Meaning when box moves down it also scrolls down which help user to show where the box is moving. 
And if it comes to background then it will be there it is just a sample.</p>

<ol>
<li>and 2. formula is the writing down all possibilities with no constraints - simple permutation 3! (even we know that Dan has giraffe and we could write down 2 possibilities). It should not modify the problem adding additional or statements should not cut off our existing proof, however it makes in my current solution. 3. statement (pattern(Dan, Girrafe) de facto cuts off unnecessary possibilities (without which program finds the correct solution).</li>

<p>I have no idea, whether I use badly prover9 or just simply overlooked something in my problem (or in its representation in classical boolean statements). What could I do wrong?</p>

I have a field for a user to enter an external URL, and when they click submit it pops up a modal window, with some information generated through a separate PHP page (images.php currently).  I have the script working when the form is actually submitted, the page reloads, and images.php is able to see index.php?url=whatever, but I'm trying to update the page without having to refresh.  Do I need to re-render the DIV after defining the variable?  I think this may be where I'm having problems.  </p>

<p>JS</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(function() {
$(""#newNote"").submit(function() {

var url = ""images.php""; // the script where you handle the form input.
var noteUrl = $('#noteUrl).val();
$.ajax({
       type: ""POST"",
       url: url,
       data: {noteUrl: noteUrl},
       success: function(data)
       {
           alert(data); // show response from the php script.
       }
     });

return false; // avoid to execute the actual submit of the form.
});
});

<pre><code>$postUrl = $_REQUEST['noteUrl'];
echo $postUrl;

<p>I could definitely be missing something glaring here, but honestly I've tried every combination of AJAX example I could find on here.  Am I missing a huge step about having PHP get the variable?  Do I need to refresh a DIV somewhere?</p>

<ol>
<li>a c# windows service</li>
<li>a desktop c# app</li>
</ol>

<p>When the mutex is created, process that didn't create the mutex doesn't seem to detect the existing mutex. Below in more detail:</p>

<p>Windows service is responsible for creating the mutex(No prefixes-Global/Local etc. Just a normal named system mutex) as follows:</p>

<pre><code>        Mutex myMutex= null;
        try
        {
            myMutex= Mutex.OpenExisting(myMutexName);

        }
        catch (WaitHandleCannotBeOpenedException x)
        {
            //doesn't exist. 
            try
            {
                this.GetLogger().Info(""Create Mutex"");
                bool createdNew = false;
                new Mutex(false, myMutexName, out createdNew);
                if (!createdNew) throw new Exception(""Unable to create Mutex"");

            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                this.Stop();
            }

        }
        catch (Exception x)
        {
            this.Stop();
        }
        finally
        {

            if (myMutex!= null)
            {
                try
                {
                    myMutex.ReleaseMutex();
                }
                catch(Exception x)
                {
                    this.GetLogger().Warn(""Unable to release mutex"");
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I have this in onStart(). Also, elsewhere in the service I synchronize on this mutex.</p>

<p>Now, in the application I use it thus:</p>

<pre><code>            Mutex myMutex= null;

        try
        {
            myMutex= Mutex.OpenExisting(this.myMutexName);
            myMutex.WaitOne();
//do required stuff


        }
        catch (WaitHandleCannotBeOpenedException wcbox)
        {
            //doesn't exist yet. service not running??
            this.GetLogger().Error(""Background Service is not Running"");
            shutdownApp();
        }
        finally
        {
            if (myMutex!= null)
            {
                try
                {
                    myMutex.ReleaseMutex();
                }
                catch (Exception x)
                {
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>My issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>With service is running, the app throws WaitHandleCannotBeOpenedException which means it doesn't see the mutex which exists (I verified this using the tool ""WinObj"", mutex exists under ""BaseNamedObjects"" as type ""Mutant""). Why? I run the service under same account as I am logged in. Even without, that shouldn't be the issue because named mutex is operating system wide object right?</p></li>
<li><p>I am not exactly clear on when the mutex will get destroyed. Currently, I see that the mutex gets created when I start the service and when I stop the service, I see the mutex no longer exists(WinObj). Does that mean mutex is garbage collected when there is no one waiting on it and when the creator process ends? </p></li>
<li><p>In general, what is the life cycle of a named system mutex. Specifically, when does it die?</p></li>

It basically works by pulling the current pages content using jQuery and feeding it into FB.api function. Everything works fine in Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc. The only problem is IE in which nothing happens, no error message, no javascript errors, nothing.</p>

<p>Here is the function I am using:</p>

<pre><code>function Publish(){
    //variables pulled from page content like so:
    var fb_message = $('#content').text();

    FB.api('/me/feed', 'post',
    {
        access_token    : fb_token,
        name            : fb_name,
        message         : fb_message,
        link            : fb_link,
        picture         : fb_photo,
        caption         : fb_caption

    },function(response) {
        if (!response || response.error) {
            alert(""Couldnt post""); 
        } else {
            alert('Posted');  
        }
    })
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I remove the <code>message</code> from the <code>FB.api</code> json, or limit the length of the string being sent to 850 chars it works fine even in IE, but I have no idea why? The string is just Loreum Ipsum, no odd characters or line breaks.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> 
Actually seems that if I remove <code>caption, name, link, etc</code> and only post a 'message' in the json I can push a slightly longer <code>message</code> string through to facebook, which seems to point to the length of the json being some kind of problem...</p>

<p>Any pointers would be really appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> 
I tried rewriting my functionality from scratch in a separate html file, still getting a problem in IE, so I have submitted a bug to Facebook. See what they have to say about it.</p>

<p>But I haven't found a good crossbrowser way to determine which anchor tag has been clicked which caused a textarea to fire <code>onblur</code>, <code>setTimeout</code> or no.  <code>document.activeElement</code> looked promising, but, answers seemingly to the contrary, without a <code>setTimeout</code>, <code>activeElement</code> is unreliable.  I keep getting the <code>body</code> returned as the <code>activeElement</code> in some browsers.</p>

<p>For example:
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Y5kcp/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsFiddle-ige #1</a>:</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;input onblur=""blurHandler();"" type=""text"" id=""spam1"" 
        value=""immediate blur check""&gt;
    &lt;input onblur=""blurHandlerTimeout();"" type=""text"" id=""spam2"" 
        value=""delayed blur check""&gt; 
    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""spam3""&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id=""logs""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>

<pre><code>var logs = document.getElementById('logs');

function blurHandler() {
    logit(document.activeElement.outerHTML.substr(0, 80));
}

function blurHandlerTimeout() {
    setTimeout(function () {
        logit(document.activeElement.outerHTML.substr(0, 80));
    }, 10);
}

function logit(msg) {
    try {
        var e = document.createTextNode(msg), // probably a better way, but this does allow html as text
            f = document.createElement('div');

        logs.insertBefore(e, logs.firstChild);
        logs.insertBefore(f, logs.firstChild);
    } catch (err) {
        alert(err);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Body element for blur from the immediate blur check textbox occurs every time for the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Safari 5.1.7 (which doesn't let me focus on the anchor at all,
tabbing or clicking) </li>
<li>Firefox 18.0.1</li>
<li>Chrome 24.0.1312.56 m, </li>
</ul>

<p>Setting focus to the <strong>delayed</strong> blur check box and clicking/tabbing into the anchor gives me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome: the <strong>body</strong> if click the anchor</li>
<li>Chrome: the <strong>anchor</strong> if I tab into it</li>
<li>Safari: the <strong>body</strong> either way</li>
<li>Firefox: the <strong>anchor</strong> no matter what</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IE8 gives me the anchor every time</strong> for each textbox, delayed handler or no.</p>

<p>So admittedly there are ways to have the anchor set a boolean at a shared scope level (eg, a global) and have a setTimeout from the blur event query that boolean to see if the anchor [recently] got focus, but man oh man that's kludgey.</p>

<p>That said, I did it, give or take, here: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Y5kcp/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsFiddle-ige #2</a>  Seems to work okay there in all four, though I'm afraid it's going to be edge-case crazy.</p>

<p>Is there better way to do this?  jQuery's fine, I guess, though I'd prefer a clean JavaScript solution -- which is to say that a clean jQuery solution is better than convoluted JavaScript fix.</p>

<p>For some reason, the images are being painted on the wrong width. I see them stretch on the whole stripe instead of staying 30x30... </p>

<p>I want the thumbnail stripe to be in the height of 40, and the width of 40xNum_of_thumbnails.</p>

<p>After each image is downloaded, I resize it to 30x30, and then I call this:</p>

<pre><code>+ (UIImage *) addThumbImage:(UIImage *)thumb toStripe:(UIImage *)stripe atIndex:(NSInteger)index
{

    CGSize size = CGSizeMake((index)*40, 40);
    if(UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions != NULL) {

    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(size, NO,  ([ UIScreen mainScreen ].scale));
}
else {
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(size);
}

    // first, drawing the stripe we got till now
    CGPoint stripePoint = CGPointMake(0, 0);
    [stripe drawAtPoint:stripePoint];

    //now adding the new thumbnail
    //CGPoint thumbPoint = CGPointMake((index-1)*40+5, 5);
    NSUInteger locX = (index-1)*40+5;
    CGRect newRect = CGRectMake(locX, 5, 30, 30);
    [thumb drawInRect:newRect];

    UIImage* result = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();

    return result;

}

<ul>
<li>I know that my images are correctly resized to 30x30 before I send them to that function</li>
<li>I guess the problem is with the drawInRect somewhere... it draws it on the whole Image context.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: some more clarifications
the stripe is used to show thumbnails of photos in my app. It suppose to look a bit similar to what you can see in ipad's photos app. The reason I need to build it ""on the fly"" is because I have an unknown number of photos - it depends on something that is going on in the server side. Photos can be added or removed, so I need the stripe to be dynamic. Upon add/remove photo in the server, I will update the stripe in the app accordingly. 
I edited the code to include UIGraphic..withOptions and withoutOptions, and to add the right scale. </p>

<p>My spreadsheet includes two calculations with criteria:
Formula 1 (Management) - Phase - Work Code
Formula 2 (Design) - Phase - Work Code</p>

<ol>
<li>Column for Management Criteria includes a ""DX2"" workcode (this is the £13 that appears to be double counted), firstly in the correct formula for management  and again in the next row over for Design</li>
<li>If i remove/0 all bar the DX value in Design work code, this still includes the DX2 cost</li>
<li>the formatting of DX/DX1/DX2 is identical</li>
</ol>

<p>Formula is:
=DSUM(BIC_Data,""Expense Cost (1)"",G283:H314)</p>

<p>Where:
BIC_Data is a seperate TAB with expense Cost (1) being the data i need to review, the criteria is G283:H314, with the top row including the column headers for Phase and work code</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This code works perfectly, save and restore the user setting without problem, <strong>but</strong> ""reset to default"" functionality differs from what I see in many popular software. In my implementation ""Reset"" cannot be canceled (because Settings.Default.Reset() cannot be reverted back), however if you see an option dialog of some popular program (for example, ""Folder options"" in the Windows Explorer), reset can be canceled by pressing Cancel button.</p>

<p>So, what is the best and simple way to implement the ""traditional"" way of the ""Reset"" functionality?</p>

<p><strong>Update (and probably the best answer)</strong></p>

<p>Currently I have resolved the problem the following way. Instead of</p>

<pre><code>MySettings.Default.Reset();
</code></pre>

<p>that cannot be reverted back, I read of the default values directly like this:</p>

<pre><code>MySettings.Default.MyBoolValue = bool.Parse((string)MySettings.Default.Properties[""MyBoolValue ""].DefaultValue);
</code></pre>

<p>Now all works just the way I wanted, but actually I feel this code to be a little bit dirty, because I need to do this for each variable individually, perform type converting, and so on. If somebody knows the better simple solution, please post here.</p>

<p>I have gone through similar questions. But no where I find a good fit that could help me.</p>

<p>I tried to resolve it using some options of <a href=""http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/smarter_csv/1.0.19"" rel=""nofollow"">SmarterCSV</a> such as -</p>

<p><em>:remove_empty_values, :remove_empty_hashes</em> etc. But in vain.</p>

<p>I welcome the suggestions or refactoring to make this work? Thanks all</p>

<p>I tend use GCC's <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.6/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html#index-g_t_0040code_007bpacked_007d-attribute-1670"" rel=""nofollow""><code>__packed__</code> attribute</a> to pack bitfields into a union, and later retrieve them as an <code>unsigned char</code> (ie. type-punning) for sending over SPI or I2C. This behaviour is all defined by my implementation, and works perfectly. I prefer this to a hundred or so lines of masking and shifting :)</p>

<p>My question is: are there <code>__packed__</code> attributes in the code below that are redundant? At first glance, I would think that those on the top-level union members can be dispensed with, but I'm not so sure. Or can I leave out those in the nested struct?</p>

<pre><code>// Remember that bitfields cannot straddle word boundaries!
typedef struct

    unsigned FlagOne            : 1 __attribute__((packed));

    unsigned FlagTwo            : 1 __attribute__((packed));
    /// A chunk of data
    unsigned SomeData           : 5 __attribute__((packed));

    // and so on, maybe up to 32 bits long depending on the destination

<p>Each of these forms is in a for loop meant to display the form 3 times (once for each month).  So at the end of the day there are 9 forms I'd like to submit.  So right now this is what I have.</p>

<p>The while loop generates Ids that the user can select, upon selecting the are presented with the form UI, where they can select between quarters and fill in date for each of the 3 months in the respective quarter.</p>

<p>So right now I have these 3 divs generating 3 forms each (all the same form).  You can switch between them and all the layout/formatting works.</p>

<p>My issue is how to submit.  I want one submit button to send all values from each of the 9 forms to another php file that will then write those values to a table in my database.</p>

<p>However I would like to let python loop through A - Z for me and return all the company names AT ONCE.
So I add another coding block below the previous script:</p>

<pre><code>letter = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z']

    data = print_all_com(page)
    target.append(data)
</code></pre>

<p>I think there's something wrong with the script above since len(target) is 1 instead of the total number of the company from A - Z.</p>

<p>As I save the result into a CSV file, it gives me a pretty odd result, which is the company names on the Z page. See the exact result below.</p>

<pre><code>['ZAPS Technologies, Inc']  ['Zoeller Engineered Products'] 
['ZAPS Technologies, Inc']  ['Zoeller Engineered Products']

<p>I've been able to achieve this by changing the baseUrl in settings.php to use https, but then it throws off our site.  We are using Drupal as our CMS, and another framework as our LMS.  So when the site loads the Drupal baseUrl from our LMS the address doesn't work.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>If I set baseUrl = '<a href=""https://www.site.com/cms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.site.com/cms</a>' then the css loads properly as '<a href=""https://www.site.com/cms/sites/all/css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.site.com/cms/sites/all/css</a>'  but then the Drupal admin site fails to load the css because the proper link from there is actually '<a href=""https://www.site.com/drupal/sites/all/css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.site.com/drupal/sites/all/css</a>'</p>

<p>Same problem happens if I swap the baseUrl to = '<a href=""https://www.site.com/drupal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.site.com/drupal</a>'.  This way the css doesn't load in our front end, but works properly in the Drupal admin side.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there is a way to do a generic wildcard baseUrl that just says to use https like baseUrl = 'https:// %' or pulls the current url in the address bar every time to see what the generated url should look like.</p>

<p>I know this is very vague, but I don't know where/how else to ask.</p>

<p>What I want to do then is for the user to be able to edit this data and 'save' the item, but instead of it being added to the collection / viewstate it edits whatever item the user had chosen and updates the collection / viewstate to reflect that.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a form with two fields:</p>

<p>Name:
Age:</p>

<p>I enter Bob and 46 and hit save. </p>

<p>Repeater now shows an entry for Bob 46 with an 'edit' button beside it. User clicks on the edit button and the form fields are populated with Bob and 46 again.</p>

<p>User then changes it to Bob Age 47 and hits save. Now instead of there then being two entries (Bob 46 and Bob 47) - the bob 46 one would be updated to Bob 47.</p>

<p>Hope this is clear, It's a little obscure but I think I've explained the gist of it. Important thing to remember is that this is all happening in the update panel so I'm using Viewstate to contain the collection that populates the repeater.</p>

<p>Visitors need to stay anonymous but they can leave their email behind (seperate table Emails that isn't linked to anything atm).

"20715651","1","","","2013-12-21 05:06:02","","0","346","<p>Final Solution?  It looks like I had my routing and controllers a little confused.  I had my routing in a file with my controller module.  I moved my routeProvider into the main module, like in the tutorial example.  My controller and my routeProvider where under the same module.  Maybe that was confusing everything.  So now I have the controller in it's own module, and the routeProvider is under the main module.  That seems to have fixed the problem without needing to initialize the search field to force the bindings to update the data.</p>

<p>Update:
The solution to showing my data at the time the page loads was to use an <strong><em>older version</em></strong> of angularJs, or use <code>ng-Init</code> and initialize the search field to a blank space.</p>

<p>I'm getting JSON data from the firebase website to update a table.  I have a search field that works.  The data will not display in the table until I type something into the search field.  I don't know why the data won't just display in the table as soon as the controller is done getting the data.</p>

<p>Note:  The link to the backend data is now removed, I don't want to keep that database file there indefinitely.</p>

<p>Here is the link to the jsFiddle code:
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Blueprinter/qKH2z/37/"" rel=""nofollow"">Last Version jsFiddle</a></p>

<p>Here is code for the controller.</p>

<pre><code>'use strict';
/* App Module */
// Create the module named 'testApp'
var testApp = angular.module('theTestApp', [
  'ngRoute',
  'testServices'
]);

'use strict';
/* Services */

var testServices = angular.module('testServices', []);

testServices.controller('CommonController',
    // function($scope, $http, $route) {
    function($scope, $http) {
    //access the customInput property using $route.current
    //var dbKey = $route.current.customInput;
    var dbKey = 'test-a-db-12345';
    var urlToDb = 'https://' + dbKey + '.firebaseio.com/rows/.json';
    $http.get(urlToDb).success(function(data) {
    $scope.UsedItems = data;
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>How do I get the data to display as soon as it's loaded? </p>

<p>Update 1: I'm assuming that the data is already there, but the event of typing something into the search field triggers the filter, and then the data shows up.  It shows up filtered.</p>

<p>Update 2: I'm reading about <code>$Watch</code> There is constantly and event loop listening for events.  When a key is pressed in the search box, the bindings <code>{{name}}</code> get updated if something has changed.  In this case, the content of the search input field was changed.  So the issue seems to have something to do with when the bindings get updated, not whether the data is getting retrieved.</p>

<p>Update 3:
This version of the code runs.  It loads the data when the page is rendered.  Here is a working example in jsBins.</p>

<p>Update 4:
As of angularJs version 1.2.0 the behavior changes.  Versions 1.0.8, 1.0.7 will instantly display my data when the page loads, 1.2.0 will NOT!  I just happened to be using jsBins which uses 1.0.7, and it started working.  Didn't know why until I started comparing the differences.  Hopefully, there is a way to make it work in newer versions.</p>

<p>Sure enough the first attempt on both threads fail:</p>

<pre><code>javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded

</code></pre>

<p>There are successes for approximately 20 attempts on each thread (presumably where the unsafe calls don't intersect) and then exceptions are thrown. This pattern seems to continue.</p>

<p>I'm running this on OS X 10.7.2 if that helps.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly this could simply be a vendor issue as it's using the Sun JDK which I could easily swap out, but I thought it would be best to get some more experienced opinions on this and put it up in case someone having the same issue stumbles across it.</p>

<p>If someone could point me in the direction of a thread safe encryption+decryption scheme which achieves the same results I'd be really grateful.</p>

<p>How does one properly setup relative requires within a framework and have it work with gulp and coffeescript? Changing the require to be for a dependency from the <code>package.json</code> (i.e. <code>Lodash = require ""lodash""</code>) allows gulp to build. Furthermore changing from coffeescript to regular javascript also fixes the problem.</p>

<p>In order to also do 2., I added an extra build parameter <code>GitRef</code> and then added an extra branch specifier with <code>$GitRef</code>. Manually starting a build would then just keep building from the same commit/branch every time, whatever the parameter was set to. If I removed all the other branch specifiers, the manual builds would work as expected. But then the hook-triggered builds would only build from <em>origin/master</em> (the default value of <code>$GitRef</code>).</p>

<p>In this example, the height to myTextEditor isn't right. It stays the same, because the text editor still isn't initialized. So, I'm using setTimeout and execute setHeightToMyTextEditor() after 3 seconds. But, if someone has much slower internet I guess it will be a problem.</p>

<p>Example from the original question:</p>

<pre><code>enum class Colors { Black, Blue, White, END_OF_LIST };

// Special behavior for ++Colors
Colors&amp; operator++( Colors &amp;c ) {
  c = static_cast&lt;Colors&gt;( static_cast&lt;int&gt;(c) + 1 );
  if ( c == Colors::END_OF_LIST )
    c = Colors::Black;
  return c;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to implement arithmetic operators without casting to a type with already defined operators? I can't think of any, but casting bothers me. Casts are usually indication of something wrong and there has to be a very good reason for their usage. I would expect the language to allow implementation of an operator to be achievable without forcing to a specific type.</p>

One of the functions my app will perform will be to play local videos from your device. To do this I'm using an external source found on github called <a href=""https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer"" rel=""nofollow"">CocoaHttpServer.</a> This Http server allows me to upload files to a localhost service. To do this i use the following code to start my server:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.
        // Configure our logging framework.
    // To keep things simple and fast, we're just going to log to the Xcode console.
    [DDLog addLogger:[DDTTYLogger sharedInstance]];

    // Create server using our custom MyHTTPServer class
    httpServer = [[HTTPServer alloc] init];


    // Tell the server to broadcast its presence via Bonjour.
    // This allows browsers such as Safari to automatically discover our service.
    [httpServer setType:@""_http._tcp.""];

    // Normally there's no need to run our server on any specific port.
    // Technologies like Bonjour allow clients to dynamically discover the server's port at runtime.
    // However, for easy testing you may want force a certain port so you can just hit the refresh button.
    // [httpServer setPort:12345];

    // Serve files from our embedded Web folder
    NSString *webPath = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath] stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""Web""];
    DDLogInfo(@""Setting document root: %@"", webPath);

    [httpServer setDocumentRoot:webPath];
    [self startServer];

    gblvb = [GlobalVariables singleobj];

    self.mediaControlChannel = [[GCKMediaControlChannel alloc] init];
    self.mediaControlChannel.delegate = self;
    [gblvb.deviceManager addChannel:self.mediaControlChannel];
    [self.mediaControlChannel requestStatus];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code then sets up my http server and points it to look in the web folder which is imported into my main bundle and contains a test video i download from google for testing purposes(this video google use in their sample of streaming to the chrome cast through the web). I got this video from <a href=""http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4</a>. As well as this the code also sets up a new media channel ready for the chrome cast to cast to...</p>

<p>Next I have my void function <code>startServer</code> which really establishes the connection and publishes the server...</p>

<pre><code>- (void)startServer
{
    // Start the server (and check for problems)

    NSError *error;
    if([httpServer start:&amp;error])
    {
        DDLogInfo(@""Started HTTP Server on port %hu"", [httpServer listeningPort]);

    }
    else
    {
        DDLogError(@""Error starting HTTP Server: %@"", error);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly the code bellow sets the path to equal the localhost url and acctuallly  cast the video to the chrome cast:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
path = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""localhost:%hu%@%@"", [httpServer listeningPort], @""/"", @""BigBuckBunny.mp4""];


    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.

    gblvb = [ GlobalVariables singleobj];


    deviceScanner = [[GCKDeviceScanner alloc] init];


    [deviceScanner addListener:self];
    [deviceScanner startScan];
    NSString *image;
    NSString *type;
    GCKMediaMetadata *metadata = [[GCKMediaMetadata alloc] init];


        image = @""Folder-Video-icon.png"";

        [metadata setString:@""The MP4 file format defined some extensions over the ISO Base Media File Format to support MPEG-4 visual/audio codecs and various MPEG-4 Systems features such as object descriptors and scene descriptions.""
                     forKey:kGCKMetadataKeySubtitle];
        type = @""video/mp4"";
[metadata setString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@%@"", @""Casting "" , gblvb.FileType]forKey:kGCKMetadataKeyTitle];



    [metadata addImage:[[GCKImage alloc]
                        initWithURL:[[NSURL alloc] initWithString:image]
                        width:480
                        height:360]];

    //define Media information
    sleep(2);
    GCKMediaInformation *mediaInformation =
    [[GCKMediaInformation alloc] initWithContentID:path
                                        streamType:GCKMediaStreamTypeNone
                                       contentType:type
                                          metadata:metadata

    //cast video
    [_mediaControlChannel loadMedia:mediaInformation autoplay:TRUE playPosition:0];
    NSLog(@""Full Path : %@"", path);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now my problem is that when this http server is published and ready to cast the chrome cast does not play it even though when i actually navigate to the path on safari the video displays perfectly. As well as this i know that the chrome cast streams fine due to the fact it streams googles online example video just fine.</p>

Here is my debugging log form the chrome cast:</p>

<p>Two of the sensors is temperature sensors using the libraries ""OneWire"" (<a href=""http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/OneWire"" rel=""nofollow"">Library Page</a>) and ""DallasTemperature"" (<a href=""https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Library on GitHub"">Library on GitHub</a>). With the DallasTemperature-library it is easy to access the sensor values with the command ""getTempCByIndex(int)"".</p>

<p>My third sensor is a combined temperature- and humiditysensor. The provided code for this sensor was a separate library ""DHT11"". That library is not that good and I have a hard time trying to read sensor values with both DHT11- and DallasTemperature-library.</p>

<p>I think that the OneWire-library should be universal for all OneWire-devices and that the DallasTemperature-library is a wrapper for that library providing a good interface for some sensors.</p>

<p>Is there someone who can help me understand how to include the DHT11-library in the DallasTemperature-library? A good function would be ""getDHT11HumidityByIndex(int)"".</p>

<p>Or is it easier to write a new wrapper using OneWire? In that case, how would that work?</p>

<p>Now I just try to use the provided libraries with the code below. The program often fails to read the humidity sensor, gets the status (-2) : ""Read sensor: Time out error"" and the index of the sensors change during runtime.
Is there some small change I can do to fix this?</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;OneWire.h&gt;
#include &lt;DallasTemperature.h&gt;
#include &lt;dht11.h&gt;  //Library for the humidity sensor.

// Data wire is plugged into port 2 on the Arduino.
#define ONE_WIRE_BUS 2

// Setup a oneWire instance to communicate with any OneWire devices (not just Maxim/Dallas temperature ICs).
OneWire oneWire(ONE_WIRE_BUS);

// Pass our oneWire reference to Dallas Temperature. 
DallasTemperature sensors(&amp;oneWire);

// Declare object for Humidity sensor.
dht11 DHT11;



void setup(void)
{
  // Start serial port.
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Start up the library.
  sensors.begin();
}

void loop(void)
{ 
  // Call sensors.requestTemperatures() to issue a global temperature 
  // request to all devices on the bus.
  sensors.requestTemperatures(); // Send the command to get temperatures.

  Serial.print(""BEGIN-0#"");
  Serial.print(sensors.getTempCByIndex(0));
  // You can have more than one IC on the same bus.
  // 0 refers to the first IC on the wire.
  Serial.println(""#COMMIT"");

  Serial.print(""BEGIN-1#"");
  Serial.print(sensors.getTempCByIndex(1));
  // You can have more than one IC on the same bus.
  // 0 refers to the first IC on the wire.
  Serial.println(""#COMMIT"");



  int chk = DHT11.read(ONE_WIRE_BUS);

  Serial.print(""Read sensor: "");
  switch (chk)
  {
    case 0: Serial.println(""OK""); break;
    case -1: Serial.println(""Checksum error""); break;
    case -2: Serial.println(""Time out error""); break;
    default: Serial.println(""Unknown error""); break;
  }

  Serial.print(""Humidity (%): "");
  Serial.println((float)DHT11.humidity, 2);

  Serial.print(""Temperature (oC): "");
  Serial.println((float)DHT11.temperature, 2);

<p><strong>What is happening:</strong> 
I currently have a website in which I allow users to upload files. They ""pick"" the location of where on the server the files get saved through choices they make.  The directory they end up picking is stored as a session variable. Once they click the upload button then the file is put to that directory. So far, no problem.  Initially I had problems with large files because of the settings in Apache. I changed the following:</p>

<p>Upload_max_filesize = 2M <strong>=></strong> Upload_max_filesize = 0</p>

<p>memory_limit = 512M <strong>=></strong> memory_limit = -1</p>

<p>This is meant to allow the user to upload any file size. This works fine for files of 400MB or so no problem.  When I tested a 16GB file however is where the problem is.  I believe from my understanding that Apache is no longer limiting the upload by size and that changing the above settings must have helped otherwise my 400 MB file wouldn't work. </p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>After the upload progress bar finishes, the page displays an error message that I have put in place if the directory location, saved in the session variable, is missing. Therefore I believe that the session may be timing out and ""forgetting"" the session variable. After the upload progress, which takes roughly an hour, is when the message is displayed.  </p>

<p><strong>What I have tried</strong></p>

<p>After doing some research I have tried changing the following, just to see if it made a difference even:</p>

<p>session.gc_maxlifetime = 36000</p>

<p>36000 should = 10 hours. I would not keep it here eventually but just did it for testing. Even changing this still results in what I believe is timing out. I was hoping someone had suggestions, and maybe other settings, that should be changed too?</p>

<h3>Posts</h3>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Posts(
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   authorId INTEGER,
   title VARCHAR(255),
   content TEXT,
   imageURL VARCHAR(255),
   date DATETIME,
   FOREIGN KEY (authorId) REFERENCES Authors(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Labels</h3>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Labels(
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
   -- This is not working:
   FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES LabelPosts(labelId) ON DELETE CASCADE 
)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>LabelPosts</strong> (relation between <code>Post</code> [1..*] -- * <code>Label</code>)</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS LabelPosts(
    postId INTEGER,
    labelId INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (postId, labelId),
    FOREIGN KEY (postId) REFERENCES Posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
</code></pre>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Using SQLite3, <code>Labels</code> are not deleted from the database when I remove all references to it from the <code>LabelPosts</code> table.  I think for the reason given by Postgres, despite SQLite accepting the table without warning.</p></li>
<li><p>PostgreSQL complains that <code>labelId</code> is not unique within <code>LabelPosts</code>, which is true and also required, since it's many-to-many:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>pq: S:""ERROR"" R:""transformFkeyCheckAttrs"" L:""6511"" C:""42830"" F:""tablecmds.c""<br>
  M:""there is no unique constraint matching given keys for referenced table \""labelposts\""""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I understand that I'm doing my constraint wrong.  However I don't know how to do it properly.</p>

<p>The body of the modal is generated by a partial view, which is rendered as part of the ""list"" page initially.</p>

<p>When the user clicks add, the form is submitted to the server via an AJAX call. If there are model errors, then the server will respond by re-sending just the body of the modal (with validation errors), which on the client side is injected back into the modal.</p>

<p>I'm using <code>@Html.ValidationSummary()</code> and <code>@Html.ValidationMessageFor()</code> in the usual way to add the model errors.</p>

<p>If the user now clicks ""cancel"", and then later clicks the ""add"" button again, the modal re-appears. In this case, I want to treat it as a fresh start and clear all the validation errors from the body of the modal. I know how to clear the client-side (""unobtrusive"") validation errors, but how can I clear the errors added by <code>@Html.ValidationSummary()</code> and <code>@Html.ValidationMessageFor()</code>.</p>

<p>I could go back to the server and ask it to re-render with a fresh model, but I guess I'm looking for a shortcut that doesn't involve another AJAX call.</p>

(To be exact I use the mouse &amp; pick one from the dialog box.) Once I set it, I'd like it to stay set for that buffer, even if I change modes, so I tried a customization. The idea was to add a <code>change-major-mode-hook</code> (which runs just before buffer-locals get killed) that would save the buffer face, if it is set, in a function to be called later- that much seems to work. But then that function seems to be called too soon, and when the mode change is over, <code>buffer-face-mode</code> is not active.</p>

<p>Here's the customization I cam up with so far</p>

<pre><code>(defun my-preserve-bufface-cmmh ()
  ""Keep the state of buffer-face-mode between major-mode changes""
  (if (and (local-variable-p 'buffer-face-mode) buffer-face-mode)
      (delay-mode-hooks
    (message ""face is %s"" buffer-face-mode-face) ; Just to show me it has the right face
    (let ((my-inner-face buffer-face-mode-face))
      (run-mode-hooks
       (message ""inner %s"" my-inner-face) ; it still has the right face here
       (setq buffer-face-mode-face my-inner-face)
       (buffer-face-mode))))))

(add-hook 'change-major-mode-hook
      'my-preserve-bufface-cmmh)
</code></pre>

<p>The messages both run and show a custom face, as they should, when I'm changing major-mode in a buffer with the minor-mode <code>buffer-face-mode</code> set. I had thought the combination of <code>delay-mode-hooks</code> ... <code>run-mode-hooks</code> would make <code>setq buffer-face-mode-face</code> ... <code>(buffer-face-mode)</code> run after the new mode was set up, but apparently not.</p>

<p>Is this customization ""close""/salvageable for my wants? Is there a cleaner way?</p>

<p>In case anyone's interested, this wasn't for homework. I had a script that was processing data from a network capture and returning it as a string of hex bytes.

There is a problem with the page you are looking for, and it cannot be displayed. When the         

Web server (while acting as a gateway or proxy) contacted the upstream content server, it   

 received an invalid response from the content server.

<p>When I m trying to run the website localy with VS2012 everything works fine with all browsers.</p>

<p>Also if I change the value in the url from greek characters to english there is no error in IE11 (but also no proper results).</p>

<p>I conclude that it has to be something with the combination of azure+ie11+greek characters in query string.
Is it a known bug?Any ideas?</p>

I am trying to open a video on YouTube, and then open up some inline HTML, I've copied the code from the examples just as I always do, and replaced what needs to be replaced. There are parts of the script that are missing when I look at the source code from the browser. The website is <a href=""http://www.powerhousebowling.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerhousebowling.com</a>. Maybe I'm missing something.</p>

<p>In my backend it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
    $("".youtube"").colorbox({iframe:true, innerWidth:425, innerHeight:344});
    $("".open_colorbox"").colorbox({width:""50%"", inline:true, href:""#inline_text""});
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But when I look at the source code in FF or IE it shows...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("".youtube"").colorbox();
        $("".open_colorbox"").colorbox();

However, I ran another test and, after a few recursive call, received a First-chance Exception showing about stack overflow, I chose to ignore it and then an unhandled exception shown up about memory reading violation.</p>

<p>Assume that I have the following code (not the real code, which has exit condition):</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
    void Bar () {
        Bar();
    };
};
</code></pre>

<p>When I use debugger, I find that at the time <code>Bar</code> is called, the <code>this</code> pointer receives the wrong address number, causing the reading of the <code>Foo</code> object wrong and I don't know why.</p>

(for example, A CFArrayRef contains a CFDictionaryRef, which then has a key whose value is another CFArrayRef. Maybe a graph below demonstrate a little better).</p>

<pre><code>CFArrayRef a

    |----CFDictionaryRef b (assume it's at index 2 of a)

                  |----CFArrayRef c (assume, they key value is ""array"")
</code></pre>

<p>So let's say we got an CFArrayRef a
And I want to access the element at CFIndex 0 in CFArrayRef c</p>

<p>I have to type something like this:</p>

<pre><code>CFArrayGetValueAtIndex((CFArrayRef)CFDictionaryGetValue((CFDictionaryRef)CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(a, 2), CFSTR(""array"")), 0)
</code></pre>

<p>That looks to me is a lot of typing. My guess is that CoreFoundation is based on C rather than C++, so it doesn't provide operator overloading like ""[]"" to access its element.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make this access easier on typing (maybe for reading as well?)</p>

<p>I am using C++, i am considering overload the operator ""[]"" for certain CFTypeRef (such as CFArrayRef, CFDictionaryRef, CFStringRef), not sure if it's a good idea.</p>

<p>Is the error that I am getting while pulling data from XML variables.</p>

<p>The XML structure is (simplified) like the following:</p>

    &lt;/view_config&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Where in my data-set the only XML that gives an issue has 168  nodes. The error occurs 27 times and only while parsing that particular XML data with this code:</p>

<pre><code>declare @graphics table(
    rowNum INT IDENTITY(0,1)PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,
    graphicName VARCHAR(MAX),
    vcXML XML,

end
set @m = 0

select @xml = vcXML FROM @graphics where rowNum = @m

declare @graphicName varchar(30)
declare @glType varchar(30) --Increased these values while trying to debug.

        set @i = @i + 1
    end
    set @m = @m + 1
end
</code></pre>

<p>So I have gone through every variable that I use for that node and made sure they are all set as <code>VARCHAR(MAX)</code>, even the ones used in the xquery syntax. I have also tested a query to see if there are any values for <code>is_position_relative</code> other than <code>false</code> and there are not, in addition to manually inspecting the XML for the particular graphic that causes the error to occur.</p>

<p>Finally when I view the results in SQL Server, there are no <code>NULL</code> values in my table, let alone any non-<code>false</code> values.</p>

<p>What could still be causing this error, and what is the result of the error occurring (because it doesn't seem to mess up my results)?</p>

I have been using a View-based application template for coding the application and I followed <a href=""http://www.icodeblog.com/2010/09/16/dealing-with-the-twitter-oauth-apocalypse/"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a> in order to use the MGTwitterEngine.</p>

<p>As you can probably see, the tutorial uses a single View Controller to send the tweet through the engine and onto Twitter. The problem with this is that my application needs to have a welcome-view, then a ""write-your-tweet"" view, and then finally the ""tweet-confirmation"" view so the tweet can be sent. Unfortunately when I code it like that, the MGTwitterEngine doesn't send the tweet if it <strong>is not</strong> on the first View Controller.</p>

<p>I have tried also to add a method in the first View Controller @interface and @implementation files. which then can be called by the other View Contollers. like this:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)tweetfix {
[_engine sendUpdate:@""prueba tweetfix""];
[self updateStream:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't work either. What can I do so I can tweet from those other ""Views"" that are not the first View Controller. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<p>But when I run this it shows the comment popup but when I click <code>comment</code> button it's giving error <code>404 file not found</code> that mean it's recognizing the correct path.

<p>My current implementation uses multiple fields to receive injected resources and then moves them into a Collection for subsequent use.</p>

<p>However, this code is ugly and the number of queues should be dynamic. When I have to increase the number of queues, I don't want to change the code on multiple places but instead simply add a single configuration line/annotation.</p>

<p>Is there a way configure stateless beans so that Resources are directly injected into the List? I'm using EJB 3.0.</p>

Currently I am storing it as a TextFile.
I was going through <a href=""http://kickstarthadoop.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-to-efficiently-store-data-in-hive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Bejoy article</a> and I found that LZO compression will be good for storing the files and also it is splittable.</p>

<p>I have one HiveQL Select query that is generating some output and I am storing that output somewhere so that one of my Hive table (quality) can use that data so that I can query that <code>quality</code> table.</p>

<p>Below is the <code>quality</code> table in which I am loading the data from the below SELECT query by making the partition I am using to overwrite table <code>quality</code>.</p>

<pre><code>create table quality
(id bigint,
  total bigint,
  error bigint
 )
partitioned by (ds string)
row format delimited fields terminated by '\t'
stored as textfile
location '/user/uname/quality'
;

insert overwrite table quality partition (ds='20120709')
SELECT id  , count2 , coalesce(error, cast(0 AS BIGINT)) AS count1  FROM Table1;
</code></pre>

<p>So here currently I am storing it as a <code>TextFile</code>, should I make this as a <code>Sequence file</code> and start storing the data in <code>LZO compression format</code>? Or text file will be fine here also? As from the select query I will be getting some GB of data, that need to be uploaded on table quality on a daily basis.</p>

<p>So which way is best? Should I store the output as a TextFile or SequenceFile format (LZO compression) so that when I am querying the Hive quality table, I am getting result fasters. Means querying is faster.</p>

<p><strong>Update:-</strong></p>

<p>What If I am storing as a SequenceFile with Block Compression? Like below-</p>

<pre><code>set mapred.output.compress=true;
set mapred.output.compression.type=BLOCK;
set mapred.output.compression.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.LzoCodec;
</code></pre>

<p>I need to set some other things to enable BLOCK Compression apart from above? And also I am creating Table as a SequenceFile format</p>

<p><strong>Update Again</strong></p>

<p>I should create the table like this below? Or some other changes need to be made to enable BLOCK compression with Sequence File?</p>

<pre><code>create table lipy
( buyer_id bigint,
  total_chkout bigint,
  total_errpds bigint
 )
 partitioned by (dt string)
row format delimited fields terminated by '\t'
stored as sequencefile
location '/apps/hdmi-technology/lipy'
;

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>using std::vector;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

<p>but I find the second one is OK, what confuses me is that different ordering of them causes different results.See following simple example: here are two header files and one c++ file.</p>

<p>Although test2.h doesn't include vector, but it compiles OK all above. 
What's strange is when I swap the order of using std::vector; and #include , there happens a compile error like this:</p>

<p>error C2501: 'vector' : missing storage-class or type specifiers</p>

<p>I have an activity that has 3 tabs accessible through the action bar. I achieved this by adding 3 fragments that inflate a custom view I made extending the view class.</p>

<p>At the moment the database changes, I try to refresh the view in my tab by calling invalidate()/postinvalidate(), but this does not work. The same is true for calling onCreateView of the fragment just as many other options I considered.</p>

<p>When I go to another tab and go back, however, the change has been made and my view is updated as it should be. </p>

<p>How can I simulate the same thing that happens when changing to another tab? What does happen. I tried to look at the Fragment lifecycle (tried to call onCreateView()) to figure it out but it just doesn't want to refresh/redraw as it should.</p>

<p>The data is loaded properly, as the data is changed when I change to another tab.</p>

<p>I deleted some of the code as it is no longer relevant. I implemented Cursorloaders instead of my own Observer pattern to notify a change. This is my main activity right now.</p>

<p>The question is what should I do now if I want to redraw the view inside these fragments. If I apply fragmentObject.getView().invalidate() it does not work. I'm having the same problem as before, but now my Observer to notify a change in the database is properly implemented with loaders.</p>

<p>For example, lets say I have a set where I want to replace item <code>A</code> with <code>B</code>. I'd expect it to be something like:</p>

<pre><code>HashSet&lt;String&gt; s = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;();
s.add(""A"");
s.update(""A"", ""B"");
</code></pre>

<p>but instead, <code>Update</code> takes a single parameter, and the <a href=""http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/latest/ITU-TR-2006-76.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> has the following to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>bool Update(T x) returns true if the collection contains an item equal
  to x, in which case that item is replaced by x; otherwise returns
  false without modifying the collection. If any item was updated, and
  the collection has set semantics or DuplicatesByCounting is false,
  then only one copy of x is updated; but if the collection has bag
  semantics and DuplicatesByCounting is true, then all copies of the old
  item are updated. If any item was updated, then events ItemsRemoved,
  ItemsAdded and CollectionChanged are raised. Throws Read-
  OnlyCollectionException if the collection is read-only.</p>

    define('PASS', 'user_pass');

<pre><code>// 1. using dynamic pointer. 
class Group {
    Person *persons;
    int size;
public:
    Group(Person *ps, int sz);

// 2. using STL container.

public:
    Group(vector&lt;Person&gt; *ps, int sz);
};

<p>I wonder that which one is the best way? is there any difference between the latter two ways?
If using pointer, it's possible to have a memory leak.If using reference, we didn't need to consider leak problem, did it?</p>

<p>Clicking inside the note / rend text fields and then double clicking any of the 4 TDs below inserts into the note / rend textfields appropriate HTML entities, even removing highlighted text and inserting at the current cursor position.</p>

<p>What should happen is: Click in note, then double click an entity, then double click an entity again. The result should be 1 entity inserted into the note text field where the cursor was and further double click events stop.</p>

<p>The problem is, if someone clicks outside the note / rend text fields without dblclicking an entity TD, then that dblclick event handler is never removed. Only until they double click an entity and have that entity inserted is the dblclick event handler removed.</p>

<p>Another bug is, every time note / rend is given focus, a new event handler is created and attached, so that if I click note / rend several times and then double click an entity, that entity is inserted for each time I originally clicked on note / rend.</p>

<p>What would be the best way to get this to only fire once and only create a single event handler?</p>

<p>Moving the .off outside the .on removes the .on as soon as it is set, never letting the function in .on to run.</p>

<p>The query is dynamically generated, the dynamic values are as follows:</p>

<p>The second line of the where clause (DATESEEN) is 90 days ago.<br />
The third line of the where clause is the time the query last ran. (Usually 12 hours ago)<br />
The last line of the where clause is the time now.</p>

<p>There is not an index on DATERECORDED, but there is on DATESEEN. I'm not able to put an index on DATERECORDED, for reasons beyond my control.</p>

<p>Is my ""DATESEEN"" line <b>in my WHERE clause</b> totally redundant? As the DATESEEN is always going to be a date much before the DATERECORDED, will it be disregarded? The execution plan reveals very little:

<p>I am building a site for a client that requires login to a bespoke backend system that I am constructing, and login at the same time to a third party system hosted on a seperate domain. Client system is built in PHP and Vendor system in .NET.</p>

<p>The login process requires both sites to perform authentication and set client-side cookies on their respective domains, so the third-party vendor has proposed that:</p>

<ol>
<li>We create the login form on the clients domain containing username and password fields</li>
<li>The login form POSTs to a server-side script on clients domain to perform authentication, sets up a server-side session and sets a client-side session cookie.</li>
<li>This login form then redirects to a script on the third-party vendors domain, POSTing the username and password and setting up a server-side session and client-side session cookie on the third-party vendors domain</li>
<li>This login script then redirects back to a ""logged in"" page on the clients domain with an embedded IFRAME containing a script on the vendor domain, both of which need to pick up their respective client-side cookies that have already been set to reinitiate the user session.</li>
</ol>

<p>The vendor has proposed that the redirection from client domain login page to vendor login page happens by having a hidden HTML form that performs an immediate JavaScript form submit.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there issues with security/bad practise/anything I can use to push back against this and get a decent API in place?</li>
<li>Is there a better way to do the above, while still being able to log into both systems and set client-side cookies on both domains?</li>
</ul>

<p>The app is working fine on pre iOS9, however, after ONLY upgrading to iOS9 on device the following problem is happening.</p>

<p>The variable below called 'anObsDate' is now returning null. I have no idea why. It seems the standalone upgrade of iOS9 on the host device has triggered this problem to happen. </p>

<pre><code>NSDate *anObsDate = [[self bomDateFormatter] dateFromString:[anObs timeStamp]];

<p>When I run the app with the following debug, we have this output:</p>

<pre><code>     NSLog(@""Timestamp %@"", [anObs timeStamp]);
     NSLog(@""Formatter %@"", [self bomDateFormatter]);
     NSDate *anObsDate = [[self bomDateFormatter] dateFromString:[anObs timeStamp]];

Timestamp 2015-09-17 00:01:10

<p>I set my date formatter up as follows:</p>

<pre><code>NSLocale *locale = [[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifier:@""en_AU""];
NSDateFormatter *countDownFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[countDownFormatter setLocale:locale];
[countDownFormatter setTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithName:@""Australia/Melbourne""]];
[countDownFormatter setDateFormat:@""yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss""];
return countDownFormatter;

<p>Again to make this clear, if I run my app on a pre iOS9 device, everything works fine, and dateFromString returns a NSDate. After upgrading to iOS9 dateFromString returns null.</p>

<p>I want to apply a drop-shadow filter to the SVG in those browsers that will recognise it. I'm doing this so far: </p>

<p>The <code>-webkit-filter</code>: declaration works in Chrome, the <code>filter: url</code> declaration works in Firefox. This is a little flaky (I can animate the filter property in Chrome, but not Firefox) but mostly good.</p>

<p>The problem is that in Chrome the edges of the blur get cut off, because the blur is bigger than the original SVG image. This doesn't happen in Firefox because in the <code>filter: url</code> I can define the width &amp; height of my filter, to give enough space for the blur to show without getting cut off. It looks like this, setting the width &amp; height of the filter to 140% of the size of the original image: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;filter id=""drop-shadow"" x=""-20%"" y=""-20%"" width=""140%"" height=""140%""&gt;

&lt;/filter&gt;

<p>But I can't find any information about how to set this from the CSS <code>-webkit-filter: declaration-</code> so in Chrome, the filter is the same size as the image, and the blur gets cut off.</p>

Too many programs will perform unexpected processing on the URL or even ship it over the network, and generally speaking, the URL is not treated with a high regard for its privacy.</p>

<p>In the past we've seen Bitcoin wallets, for example, which have relied on keeping a URL secret, but they found out the hard way there are too many ways in which a URL (sent via Skype, or emailed, or even just typing it into the Google Chrome omnibar) will get stored by a remote server, and possibly displayed publicly.</p>

<p>And so I thought URL would be forsaken forever as a means for carrying any private data... despite being extremely convenient, except now I've seen a few sites which are using URL fragments -- the portion of the URL after the '#' -- as a kind of 'secure' storage. I think the expectation is that Google won't parse the fragment and allow it to show up in search results, so that data shouldn't be published. </p>

<p>But that seems like a pretty weak basis for the security of your product. There would be a huge benefit to having a way to securely move data in URL fragments, but can we really rely on that?</p>

<p>So, I would really like to understand... Can anyone explain, what is the security model for fragment identifiers?</p>

<p>This is great except if I for some reason have a random file on my computer that ends in a v or in c,v that isn't in RCS, it is going to return that, too. Things like  <code>find . -name \*RCS\*c,v</code> do not work and return nothing. <code>find . -name RCS\*</code> will return the RCS directory, but none of the files inside the RCS directory. </p>

<p>Is there someway I can get a find command to return all files that are in RCS directories, starting from my home directory. I know I can filter out unwanted files afterwards, but it needs to only be showing me files from the RCS directory to begin with.</p>

<p>After reading all the answers I decided that assuming ,v are RCS files is the best way to go about this because we have not covered scripting for my teacher to ask us a question like that. We are not supposed to pipe into xargs or grep for the question either,and -path does not work on my version of unix. It was helpful to know from perreal that using -name does not allow me to match '/' which clears up some other questions I had but did not ask. I have come to the understanding that there is no way to do this without -path or some type of following command or script. Thank you all for your help.</p>

<p>The application looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JgwTH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So the header (except for the title) and the footer are always constant.
And the <strong>red</strong> parts change to the relevant page when a footer button is clicked.</p>

<p>I know that I should not ask ""<em>what is the best approach for this</em>"" kind of question. So, how should I do this?</p>

<p><strong>Right now what I'm doing is this:</strong></p>

<p>two static layouts (without activity classes) : header.xml and footer.xml. I <code>&lt;include&gt;</code> them in the activity layouts (like *about_us.xml*). footer.xml has buttons, which are hooked to <code>onClick</code> events. Buttons are like <em>home , about us , references , contact</em>. And the onClick events are like <strong>""load_Page_AboutUs""</strong></p>

<p>So there are 4 functions for each page (activity) to load. This is also a problem I guess. If there is a way to do it like : <code>load_page(String activity_name)</code> I would like it.</p>

<p>But the real problem is :</p>

<p>I have to define all the <code>load_page_x</code> functions in all the activities.</p>

<p>So if I have 4 activities, I define the below functions in 4 different activities : </p>

<pre><code>public void load_page_about(View view)
{
 Intent i = bla();
 startActivity(i);
}
public void load_page_references(View view)
{
 Intent i = bla();
 startActivity(i);
}
// etc..
</code></pre>

<p>These set of function definitions exist in all 4 activities. So I think that I'm doing something wrong here. I would appreciate any help to guide me into the right direction. In the end:</p>

<p><strong>What I want is:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A single layout (xml) for the footer</li>
<li>A single activity class that can handle the footer buttons' <code>onClick</code>'s</li>
<li>Similarly for the header. And change its title programmatically (or from xml, if possible)</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I should design page content parts as .xml files and programmattically include them in the <code>main_layout.xml</code> is it correct? And how can I do it?</p>

I have <code>glutIgnoreKeyRepeat(1)</code> and I register the key events (down/up for normal and special) in an object that keeps track of the keys pressed (called the list of pressed keys from now on) so that I just check in my display function if a key is pressed by looking in that list.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong> is with <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>: <strong>Different keys</strong> register as DOWN and UP (depending on whether SHIFT was pressed or not) <strong>for the same physical keyboard</strong> key (eg.
<kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>1</kbd> and <kbd>!</kbd>, <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>{</kbd> etc.)</p>

<p>Consider this (with {<kbd>key1</kbd> <kbd>key2</kbd>} representing my list of pressed keys after the event):</p>

<ul>
<li>initial state : {} no keys listed as pressed</li>
<li><kbd>SHIFT</kbd> DOWN : {<KBD>SHIFT</kbd>}</li>
<li><kbd>a</kbd> DOWN : {<KBD>SHIFT</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd>} (because <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> is still down, capital 'A' registers as the key down.</li>
<li><kbd>SHIFT</kbd> UP: {<kbd>A</kbd>}</li>
<li><kbd>a</kbd> UP: {<kbd>A</kbd>} (because <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> is not pressed, lower 'a' registers as the key up, so <kbd>a</kbd> is removed from the pressed key list (which actually doesn't exist), and <kbd>A</kbd> still remains)</li>
<li>final state: {<kbd>A</kbd>} even though no keys are still pressed on the keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>For alpha keys I can solve this by adding/removing the lower case of the keys (<kbd>a</kbd> instead of <kbd>A</kbd>).</p>

<p>But what about <kbd>1</kbd> and <kbd>!</kbd> or <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>{</kbd>. <code>glutGetModifiers</code> doesn't help here. Or what if a key is pressed, the window looses focus, the key is released and the window gains focus again (there is no event to tell that the key was released when the windows lost focus)?</p>

<p>Is there a general solution to check if a key is pressed? (platform dependent solutions are ok, another library is not for me, but maybe for others who need to solve this)</p>

However they all eventually end up using a Rule Set Editor for defining rules. I want to declaratively define rules in an XML file</p>

<p>It seems like xcode 4 contains older versions of clang and gcc. Can i uppgrade gcc or clang and use them with xcode 4? I would like to use gcc >= 4.6 or the latest clang.</p>

<p>My main goal is to be able to have as much of the new features from C++11 available when programming C++ on mac osx lion so ditching xcode is also an option if that is needed.</p>

<p>What are my options to achieve this?</p>

<p>My problem is, after many commits to our branch, I realized that the initial import of the engine was done with CRLF line endings.</p>

<p>I converted every file to LF, but this made a huge commit, with 100k lines removed and 100k lines added, which obviously breaks what we intended to do: easily merge in patches from the factory releases of that 3rd party engine.</p>

<p>What whould I do know? How can I fix this? I already have hundreds of commits on our fork.</p>

<p>What would be good is to somehow do a line endings fix commit after the initial import and before branching our own fork, and removing that huge line ending commit later in history.</p>

So, to create a method a new ComponentClassTransformWorker2 called, say, <strong>LukesComponentClassTransformWorker2</strong> I use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>PlasticMethod plasticMethod = plasticClass.introduceMethod(""defaultValidate"");
MethodAdvice advice = new MethodAdvice(){
    @Override
    public void advise(MethodInvocation invocation) {
        invocation.proceed();
        environment.push(MenuContext.class, context);   
    }
};
plasticMethod.addAdvice(advice);
</code></pre>

<p>Then when a later worker (in my case, Tapestry's built in ParameterWorker) looks for this using PlasticClass.getMethods() and doesn't find it as plasticClass.getMethods() doesn't return any 'introduced' methods.</p>

<p>This change will even break implementations of the deprecated ComponentClassTransformationWorker because <strong>BridgeClassTransformation</strong> simply uses PlasticClass.getMethods() under the hood:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;TransformMethod&gt; matchMethods(Predicate&lt;TransformMethod&gt; predicate)
{
    return F.flow(plasticClass.getMethods()).map(toTransformMethod).filter(predicate).toList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like a bug to me as it is a breaking change and it seems to apply to fields too. Shouldn't searching for a method/field on a class include any introduced methods/fields too?</p>

<p>I dont claim to know anything about javascript but I found the following code in a page which I know is dynamic, but often does not reveal it:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>document.write('&lt;script language=""JavaScript"" src=""http://ad.doubleclick.net...
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Could <code>document.write</code> be a good keyword for identifying dynamic pages</p>

BUT the problem is, IF the concerned input is in an already toggled part... (i mean hidden when the user tries to submit), the error is NOT shown (sure! cuz' the container is hidden!!), but it's a problem... to me... because i'd like to show where is the incomplete field, even if it is ""hidden"" on submit... how can i do?</p>

<p>i thought about creating a ""tips"" div, next to the submit button, which would show a text error message explaining which input isnt completed... but even this, i really don't know how to do... the submit click automatically points to the error... how can i get, with a variable, the missed field name or id?</p>

<p>my english is not perfect, i'm sorry if my question is not clear... but, anyway, thanks for help!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>But it don't work , just show the empty table with header . </p>

<p>Anyone know my wrong ? </p>

<p>Updated 2015/04/06 :</p>

<p>I also test other cases .</p>

<p>Case one : invoke <code>setContextProperty</code> before <code>load</code> QML.</p>

<p>Case two : invoke <code>setContextProperty</code> after <code>load</code> QML. </p>

<p>Case three : Don't use <code>QMlApplicationEngine</code> , directly use <code>MyWindow</code> to show data . </p>

<p>In case one , that may cause two result . </p>

<p>Result 1 : Report segmentation fault: 11 , system exit .</p>

<p>Result 2 : Display empty table with header . <code>QtAbstractTableModel</code> not invoked . <code>Component.onCompleted: console.log(tableModel)</code> print null</p>

<p>In case two , everything in fine , all function in <code>QtAbstractTableModel</code> has been called . <code>Component.onCompleted: console.log(tableModel)</code> don't invoked . 
But table still empty . </p>

<p>My console output in case two listed below , seen data method has been invoked and work correctly.</p>

<p>The question is: why malloc() is giving me SIGSEGV? The debug bellow show the program has no time to test the returned pointer to NULL and exit. The program quits INSIDE MALLOC!</p>

<p>I'm assuming my malloc in glibc is just fine. I have a debian/linux wheezy system, updated, in an old pentium (i386/i486 arch).</p>

<p>To be able to track, I generated a core dump. Lets follow it:</p>

<pre><code>iguana$gdb xadreco core-20131207-150611.dump

Core was generated by `./xadreco'.

</code></pre>

<p>Of course I need to look at frame 2, the last on stack related to my code. But the line 4519 gives SIGSEGV! It does not have time to test, on line 4520, if paux==NULL or not.</p>

<p>Here it is ""movimento"" (abbreviated):</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct smovimento
{
    int lance[4];  //move in integer notation
    int roque; // etc. ...

    struct smovimento *prox;// pointer to next
} movimento;
</code></pre>

<p>This program can load a LOT of memory. And I know the memory is in its limits. But I thought malloc would handle better when memory is not available.</p>

<p>Doing a <code>$free -h</code> during execution, I can see memory down to as low as 1MB! Thats ok. The old computer only has 96MB. And 50MB is used by the OS.</p>

<p>I don't know to where start looking. Maybe check available memory BEFORE a malloc call? But that sounds a wast of computer power, as malloc would supposedly do that. <code>sizeof (movimento)</code> is about <code>48 bytes</code>. If I test before, at least I'll have some confirmation of the bug.</p>

<p>Any ideas, please share. Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm in the middle of migrating a JavaEE project from Sun Application Server 9.1 to Glassfish 3.1.2. The project has the following structure:</p>

<p>ear<br>
| - /lib/someProject.jar (used by confictEJB and EJB)<br>
| - confictEJB.jar<br>
| - EJB.jar<br>
| - webProj.war<br></p>

<p>The jars and the ear is build with maven. The thing is, this deploys without errors in SAS 9.1 and in Glassfish 2.1. But in Glassfish 3.2.1 I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>#|2012-04-23T13:44:29.562+0200|SEVERE|glassfish3.1.2|javax.enterprise.system.container.web.com.sun.enterprise.web|_ThreadID=34;_ThreadName=Thread-2;|WebModule[/ArchiveTool]PWC1396: Servlet /ArchiveTool threw load() exception

at org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet.init(ActionServlet.java:329)
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the ActionServlet cannot parse/find the struts-config.xml in GF3.2.1. What I did so far:<br></p>

<ul>
<li>referenced to the local DTD in the DOCTYPE of the struts-config.xml </li>
<li>general syntax validation of struts-config.xml -> no errors</li>
<li>validate the struts-config.xml against DTD -> no errors</li>
<li>deployed the webProj.war standalone to Glassfish -> deploys without errors</li>
</ul>

<p>The structure of the war project:<br></p>

<p>webProj.war<br>
| - some stuff (images, css, js, etc)<br>
| - META-INF<br>
| - WEB-INF<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| - lib<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| - struts.jar (an others)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| - struts-config.xml<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| - struts-config_1_2.dtd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| - glassfish-web.xml<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| - web.xml<br></p>

<p>Does anyone have a clue what is missing or where I can check any further configuration?
Any help is greatly appreciated!

<p>As you can see, there are 7 repeating header lines in the head, and 1 trailing line at the end of the dataset. Those header and trailing lines are all beginning from #. As a result, the data will have 7 header lines, 8768 data lines, and 1 trailing line, total 8776 lines per a data block. That one trailing line only contains sinlge '#'.  </p>

<p>I want to swap some numbers in 2nd columns only. First, I want to replace </p>

<pre><code>1, 9, 10, 11 =&gt; 666
2, 6, 7, 8 =&gt; 333
3, 4, 5 =&gt; 222

<p>of the 2nd column, and then, </p>

<pre><code>666 =&gt; 6
333 =&gt; 3
222 =&gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>of the 2nd column. I hope to conduct this replacing for all repeating dataset. </p>

<p>I tried this with python, but the data is too big, so it makes memory error. How can I perform this swapping with linux commands like sed or awk or cat commands? </p>

"30800173","1","","","2015-06-12 09:51:51","","1","87","<p>I'm maintaining a project that uses DevExpress ASP.NET v13.2 controls and within it I have an ASPxGridView that displays all sorts of information. Recently when doing some work on the layout of this grid, I noticed that the column widths are not being saved at all. It seems only column ordering and column visibility are being stored.</p>

<p>Here's what I've got client-side:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dxwgv:ASPxGridView ID=""ASPxGridView"" runat=""server""
                    AutoGenerateColumns=""False""
                    ClientInstanceName=""grid""
                    KeyFieldName=""ClientId""
                    Width=""100%""
                    OnHtmlRowPrepared=""ASPxGridView_HtmlRowPrepared""
                    OnCustomCallback=""ASPxGridView_CustomCallback""
                    OnClientLayout=""gridView_ClientLayout""&gt;
  &lt;SettingsBehavior ColumnResizeMode=""NextColumn"" AllowFocusedRow=""True"" /&gt;
  &lt;SettingsCookies Enabled=""True""&gt;&lt;/SettingsCookies&gt;
  &lt;SettingsText EmptyDataRow=""No queries found for the current criteria."" /&gt;
  &lt;Settings ShowFilterRow=""True"" ShowGroupPanel=""True"" ShowFilterRowMenu=""True"" GridLines=""None"" /&gt;
  &lt;ClientSideEvents BeginCallback=""OnGridBeginCallback""
                    EndCallback=""OnGridEndCallback""
                    ColumnResized=""function(s, e) {
                                   e.processOnServer = true;}""&gt;
  &lt;/ClientSideEvents&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, according to the snippet above, whenever a column is resized, the event is processed server side and sent through to the girdView_ClientLayout method (this works).</p>

<p>Here's what girdView_ClientLayout looks like:</p>

<pre><code>protected void gridView_ClientLayout(object sender, ASPxClientLayoutArgs e)
{
  //if in saving mode continue.
  //compare GridView's current layout (e.LayoutData) info to that stored on Db for this user.
  //if different, save new layout to Db.
  //refresh layout, i.e. read new user layout from Db.
  //otherwise ignore as to reduce unnecessary extra Db interaction.
}
</code></pre>

<p>So according to my understanding, e should contain a property called LayoutData which is a human unreadable logical string that should have layout information such as columns visible, column order, grouping, column widths, etc that only the gridview can understand. However, stepping through the flow, I notice the string passed to gridView_ClientLayout has no column width information. My above method ignores the new layout information as technically it sees no change to the layout data and therefore does not save the layout! It then refreshes the grid (reads the user's layout from the Db) which means column widths are reset to that of whatever is saved in the Db.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the LayoutData string before width is resized:</p>

<pre><code>""page1|sort1|a20|conditions14|1|3|4|3|6|3|8|3|10|3|12|3|13|3|14|3|15|3|19|3|20|3|21|3|22|3|23|3|visible24|f0|f3|t0|f16|f2|f16|t1|f16|t6|f16|t7|f16|t4|t5|f10|f9|t11|t12|f14|f13|t8|f16|f13|f16|width24|e|e|60px|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|300px|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e""
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what the LayoutData looks like being passed to girdView_ClientLayout when rezising occurs:</p>

<pre><code>""page1|sort1|a20|conditions14|1|3|4|3|6|3|8|3|10|3|12|3|13|3|14|3|15|3|19|3|20|3|21|3|22|3|23|3|visible24|f0|f3|t0|f16|f2|f16|t1|f16|t6|f16|t7|f16|t4|t5|f10|f9|t11|t12|f14|f13|t8|f16|f13|f16|width24|e|e|60px|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|300px|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e|e""
</code></pre>

<p>Exactly the same!
I'm expecting something like the above string but with more sections ending in px. Sort of like:</p>

<pre><code>'page1|visible23|f0|f-1|t0|f1|f-1|f2|t1|f3|f4|f4|t3|f5|t2|f6|f6|f6|t4|f7|f11|f7|t5|t6|f8|width23|e|200px|100px|e|e|e|56px|e|e|e|150px|e|200px|e|e|e|200px|e|e|e|120px|128px|e'
</code></pre>

<p>(Notice the various random sections ending in px)
If I were to manually edit these px sections in the Db and run the app, the columns are sized accordingly so it's definitely a problem saving from the grid, not loading to it.</p>

<p>I'm planning on ditching save/load of this human unreadable gridview layout string soon as it has been giving me plenty of headaches whenever clients desire new columns. I'll be implementing an XML alternative soon but even then, it too requires column width information which is not stored in ASPxClientLayoutArgs.LayoutData meaning I'd have to implement a dirty hack to inject this column width information into the XML structure. But that's a problem for another day.</p>

<p>Anyone have any suggestions? This is not a huge problem, I mean it's just column widths, but my scrum master would really like it included in our next deploy (which is being delayed by this problem). He's a really cool guy and I'd really hate to disappoint him with something so small and insignificant.</p>

<p>Thanks guys,
Jean-Pierre</p>

In this program, I'd like to add an ""Online Users"" list, which relies on sessions: A session is started when a user logs in, and the user is marked as Online in the database. As soon as the logs out <strong>or</strong> closes the browser, the user is marked as Offline in the database. </p>

<p>I know that running some functions when the browser is closed will require Javascript, and it's not safe either: If the browser were to crash, the functions wouldn't run. That's why I've settled for the database updating if the user logs out or if the user's <em>session</em> times out.</p>

<p>I've been looking up session timeouts, and ran into this, along with many others like it marked as duplicates: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/520237/how-do-i-expire-a-php-session-after-30-minutes"">How do I expire a PHP session after 30 minutes?</a></p>

<p>The problem with the answer's method is; It's a conditional sentence that checks if the user's last activity was X seconds ago, and if there was no activity, it times out. Useful in some websites, but useless for the Online Users list, since it updateds when a new request is sent, and since there won't be any requests after the user closes the browser.</p>

<p>Also mentioned in other answers is the use of <code>session.gc_maxlifetime</code> and <code>session.cookie_lifetime</code>, but the Best answer states that using them is a bad idea; One doesn't destroy the session, just the cookies, and the other is ""cost-intensive"".</p>

<p>What I want is the user to time out and the database to update and mark the user as Offline <strong>without</strong> using the If-Conditional sentence, or maybe with using a different If-conditional sentence that only has to be used once when the user logs in, like a timer or something, and whenever a request is sent, the timer restarts...those are just my ideas so far on how to solve this problem.</p>

<p>But, how do I do this? I'm sorry if the answer is something very simple and obvious, I'm very new to PHP.</p>

<p>Edit: <strong>Long Story Short:</strong></p>

<p>I want to run a function after the user <em>closes his browser</em>, or is inactive for 20 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification...</strong></p>

<p>I want to update the database after 20 minutes of inactivity <strong>even if</strong> the browser has been closed.</p>

<p>Is it a bug or I am doing something wrong?
It does say it is weighted, but the valeus are all NA (at least the randomized ones).</p>

<pre><code>&gt; packageDescription(""igraph"")$Version
[1] ""0.7.1""
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts or suggestions?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Going further on this, how should the weights behave in this situation? For ex, if the edge weight A--B move to A--C, should its weight remain the same value? Or should it change (and, therefore, all others) so the graph.strength distribution remains the same?</p>

<p>That code uses a CSS transition as a hacky way to accomplish a slide.</p>

<p>Instead, I would like to use JavaScript, maybe with JQuery, to get the <code>div</code> itself to resize to fit my content. For example, if the old content was longer than the new content, the <code>div</code> would slide to become smaller. If the old content was smaller, then the <code>div</code> would grow to fit the new content.</p>

<p>Currently, the <code>div</code> just jumps to be smaller, since the elements inside no longer need as much space. Is there any way to animate this content change? I have tried using CSS transitions but it was too complicated to coordinate the sizes of the <code>div</code> and content.</p>

Restoring a wrong synchronization context on a UI thread may seriously affect component developers like me. The goal of the bounty is to draw more attention to this problem and to reward @MattSmith whose answer helped tracking it down.</em></p>

<p>I'm responsible for a .NET WinForms <code>UserControl</code>-based component exposed as ActiveX to <strong>a legacy unmanaged app</strong>, via COM interop. The runtime requirement is .NET 4.0 + Microsoft.Bcl.Async.</p>

<p>The component gets instantiated and used on the app's main STA UI thread. Its implementation utilizes <code>async/await</code>, so it expects that an instance of a serializing synchronization context has been installed on the current thread (i. e.,<code>WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext</code>). </p>

<p>Usually, <code>WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext</code> gets set up by <code>Application.Run</code>, which is where the message loop of a managed app runs. Naturally, <strong>this is not the case for the unmanaged host app</strong>, and I have no control over this. Of course, the host app still has its own classic Windows message loop, so it should not be a problem to serialize <code>await</code> continuation callbacks.</p>

<p>However, none of the solutions I've come up with so far is perfect, or even works properly. Here's an artificial example, where <code>Test</code> method is invoked by the host app:</p>

<pre><code>Task testTask;

public void Test()
{
    this.testTask = TestAsync();
}

async Task TestAsync()
{
    Debug.Print(""thread before await: {0}"", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);

    var ctx1 = SynchronizationContext.Current;
    Debug.Print(""ctx1: {0}"", ctx1 != null? ctx1.GetType().Name: null);

    if (!(ctx1 is WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext))
        SynchronizationContext.SetSynchronizationContext(new WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext());

    var ctx2 = SynchronizationContext.Current;
    Debug.Print(""ctx2: {0}"", ctx2.GetType().Name);

    await TaskEx.Delay(1000);

    Debug.WriteLine(""thread after await: {0}"", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);

    var ctx3 = SynchronizationContext.Current;
    Debug.Print(""ctx3: {0}"", ctx3 != null? ctx3.GetType().Name: null);

    Debug.Print(""ctx3 == ctx1: {0}, ctx3 == ctx2: {1}"", ctx3 == ctx1, ctx3 == ctx2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Debug output:</p>

<pre>
thread before await: 1
ctx1: SynchronizationContext
ctx2: WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext
thread after await: 1
ctx3: SynchronizationContext
ctx3 == ctx1: True, ctx3 == ctx2: False
</pre>

<p>Although it continues on the same thread, the <code>WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext</code> context I'm installing on the current thread before <code>await</code> <strong>gets reset to the default <code>SynchronizationContext</code></strong> after it, for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>Why does it get reset?</strong> I've verified my component is the only .NET component being used by that app. The app itself does call <code>CoInitialize/OleInitialize</code> properly.</p>

<p>I've also tried <strong>setting up <code>WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext</code> in the constructor of a static singleton object</strong>, so it gets installed on the thread when my managed assembly gets loaded. That didn't help: when <code>Test</code> is later invoked on the same thread, the context has been already reset to the default one.</p>

<p>I'm considering using a <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2011/01/13/10115642.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">custom awaiter</a> to schedule <code>await</code> callbacks via <code>control.BeginInvoke</code> of my control, so the above would look like <code>await TaskEx.Delay().WithContext(control)</code>. That should work for my own <code>awaits</code>, as long as the host app keeps pumping messages, but not for <code>awaits</code> inside any of the 3rd party assemblies my assembly may be referencing. </p>

<p>I'm still researching this. <strong>Any ideas on how to keep the correct thread affinity for <code>await</code> in this scenario would be appreciated.</strong> </p>

<p>I've been reading about timers for the last 3 days and I'm unable to find anything useful, I'm trying to understand it in real example, can somebody help me figure out how to setup an alarm for the below program. </p>

<p>How can I set a a timer so that it will send 2 args, one is the array name, and the second one is the number to be deleted, I know the below is not safe in anyway, I'm just trying to understand how use alarms with args to call a function.</p>

<p>please note that the environment is Linux, and also I appreciate any link with a working C example. </p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
int delete_from_array(int arg) ;


    int main()
    {

    int a[10000], i, y ;
    //how to set timer here for to delete any number in array after half a second
    for (y=0; y &lt; 100; y++) {


        for (i=0; i&lt;sizeof(a) / sizeof(int); i++)
            a[i] = i;
    sleep(1);
    printf(""wake\n"");
    }

    }

    int delete_from_array(int arg) 
    {
    int i, a[1000], number_to_delete=0;

    //number_to_delete = arg-&gt;number;

    for (i=0; i&lt;sizeof(a); i++)
        if (a[i] == number_to_delete)
            a[i] = 0;
    printf(""deleted\n"");

    }
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm trying to do is that I have a hash which has has values to be expired after 1 seconds, so after I insert the value into the hash, I need to create a timer so that it will delete that value after let's say 1 second, and IF I got a response from the server before the that interval (1 second) then I delete the value from the hash and delete the timer, almost like retransmission in tcp </p>

<p>The real code is complicated, sloppy, and working as expected, but this should give the general idea, since this is mostly a math question anyway, the code isn't of much consequence, it's just provided for clarity.</p>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p>I was in the process of adding ""pivot points""/""joint locations"" to each bone (negative translate, rotate by ""final quaternion"", translate back) when I realized that the ""final quaternion"" will not have taken the different pivot points into account when combining the quaternions themselves. In this case each bone rotation will have been treated as if it was around point (0,0,0).</p>

<p>Given that quaternions represent only a rotation, it seems I'll either need to ""add"" a position to the quaternions (if possible), or simply convert all of the quaternions into matrices, then do matrix multiplication to combine the series of translations and rotations. I am really hoping the latter is not necessary, since it seems like it would be really inefficient, comparatively.</p>

<p>I've searched through mathoverflow, math.stackexchange, and whatever else Google provided and read the following resources so far in hopes of figuring out an answer myself:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://shankel.best.vwh.net/QuatRot.html"">http://shankel.best.vwh.net/QuatRot.html</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quaternion.html"">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quaternion.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>plus various other small discussions found through Googling (I can only post 2 links)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The consensus is that Quaternions do not encode ""translation"" or ""position"" in any sense, and don't seem to provide an intuitive way to simulate it, so pure quaternion math seems unlikely to be a viable solution.</p>

<p>However it might be nice to have a definitive answer to this here. Does anyone know any way to ""fake"" a position component of a quaternion, that in some way that would keep the quaternion math efficiency, or some other method to ""accumulate"" rotations around different origin points that is more efficient than just computing the matrix of the quaternions, and doing matrix translation and rotation multiplications for each and every quaternion? Or perhaps some mathematical assurance that differing pivot points don't actually make any difference, and can, in fact be applied later (but I doubt it).</p>

<p>Or is using quaternions in this situation just a bad idea on the face of it?</p>

The way this is done is by removing the textview from it's superview, making a NSSplitView and adding the textview as well as a new NSTextView instance to this splitview. Lastly I make these two textviews share the same textstorage in order to make them share the same content.</p>

<p>It works great. But the problem is when I want to make one of the two textviews change textstorage. The replaceTextStorage method in NSLayoutManager causes both NSTextView to change textStorage. The API documentation states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>replaceTextStorage</strong>: All
  NSLayoutManager objects sharing the
  original NSTextStorage object then
  share the new one. This method makes
  all the adjustments necessary to keep
  these relationships intact, unlike
  setTextStorage:.</p>

<p>So here is another method where I try to draw a circle graphic on the map:</p>

<pre><code>function addCircle(e) {
sym = new esri.symbol.SimpleFillSymbol().setColor(new dojo.Color([180, 0, 180, 1.0]));

console.log(""clicked the map: "", e);
var pt, radius, circle, ring, pts, angle;

pt = e.mapPoint;
circle = new esri.geometry.Polygon(map.spatialReference);
ring = []; // point that make up the circle
pts = 40; // number of points on the circle
angle = 360 / pts; // used to compute points on the circle
for (var i = 1; i &lt;= pts; i++) {
    // convert angle to raidans
    var radians = i * angle * Math.PI / 180;;
    // add point to the circle
    ring.push([pt.x + radius * Math.cos(radians), pt.y + radius * Math.sin(radians)]);
    console.log(ring[i]);
}
ring.push(ring[0]); // start point needs to == end point
circle.addRing(ring);
map.graphics.add(new esri.Graphic(circle, sym));
console.log(""added a graphic"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>It did execute the function but there is not circle plotted on the map and as well as error message. I wonder which part of my logic went wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I need to check the amplitude at the beginning and end of a WAV file. I'm hoping for silence at the start and end of clips but need to report on a scale if not. The files are always accessible locally.  I've read about converting the file to a byte array and that converting each byte to a signed integer representation of the hex gives the amplitude but (if this is the case) I'm confused about how to apply this to audio that would need to be split across 2 bytes per sample.  I've also read about bit-shifting but I'm unsure if it's relevant if I use a byte array.  </p>

<p>To clarify, I'd rather not use unnecessary imports if possible but could and I don't have to use bytes to divide up the WAV, I only need a reliable way to present the amplitude at particular points in the array (start and end).</p>

<p>then I incremented the list with <em>icons</em> to create a list of numbers</p>

<p>I can understand why this function above works. (I googled how to free memory and this one seems to be the popular answer). But out of curiosity, I tried another one:</p>

<pre><code>   ilist tmp = lon;

This was traced back to a caching mechanism in Ninject (I think it was Activation Cache or something - not totally sure). After investigating the issue we came to the conclusion that we had a circular reference in our scope callback.</p>

<pre><code>class View
{
    Presenter presenter;

    View()
    {
        //service locators are smelly, but webforms forces this uglyness
        this.presenter = ServiceLocator.Get&lt;Func&lt;View, Presenter&gt;&gt;()(this);

        this.presenter.InitUI();
    }
}

class Presenter
{
    CookieContainer cookieContainer;
    View view;

    Presenter(View view, CookieContainer cookieContainer)
    {
        this.view = view;
        this.cookieContainer = cookieContainer;
    }
}

class CookieContainer
{
    HttpRequest request;
    HttpResponse response; 

    CookieContainer()
    {
        this.request = HttpRequest.Current.Request;
        this.response = HttpRequest.Current.Response;
    }
}

Bind&lt;Func&lt;View, Presenter&gt;&gt;().ToMethod(ctx =&gt; view =&gt; 
        ctx.Kernel.Get&lt;Presenter&gt;(new ConstructorArgument(""view"", view)));

Bind&lt;Presenter&gt;().ToSelf().InTransientScope();
Bind&lt;CookieContainer&gt;().ToSelf().InRequestScope();
</code></pre>

<p>This is a representation of our code that was causing the issue. Seemingly what happened was the scope callback for the CookieContainer was HttpContext.Current, and HttpContext.Current was also being referenced by CookieContainer. So Ninject could never prune CookieContainer instances from its cache, as the CookieContainer instances where keeping their scope callback objects alive. When we change CookieContainer's scope to transient, all works fine, as we expected. But I'm still not totally sure why this happened as it seems like this is a fairly conventional thing to do right? Maybe not perhaps...</p>

<p>I am also confused as I thought that if the callback object stayed alive as it did, then shouldn't Ninject just hand back the same instance from the cache, seeing as though the callback was still alive, so the instance should appear to be in scope? Why would ninject keep getting new instances of CookieContainer and caching them? I guess there would be other issues related to the incorrect object coming back, but that would at least just be a bug, not a memory leak. </p>

<p>My question is a) have we diagnosed this error correctly? b) is there a recommended approach to take for this not to happen again? c) Can I put a fix in to the code to check for this type of circular dependancy (assuming we have diagnosed this correctly)?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, Spring will only provide a ""Location"" in response to a redirect (""redirect:xyz"" or RedirectView), however there are scenarios where a Location should be sent along with the entity body (ex, as a result of a ""201 Created"").</p>

<p>I'm afraid my only option is manually specifying it:</p>

<li>will strip white space from around field value. But be careful, empty field should not be stripped!</li>

<p>here's two examples to illustrate what I want:</p>

Everything worked perfect. My application can access and display images, js &amp; css files from s3, but there is one problem.</p>

<p>I am using Adobe Edge (new HTML5 tool for animations) for an image gallery in my application. Adobe Edge automatically creates some javascript &amp; css files. Part of one javascript file (public/javascripts/x.js) is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>content: {
  dom: [
    {
        id:'Image1',

        type:'image',
        rect:[0,0,600,400],
        fill:['rgba(0,0,0,0)','../images/schimg1.png'],
    },
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see it is taking schimg1.png (public/images/) as a parameter. Before moving my files to S3, the javascript could access the image and display it by going one folder up and accessing the images. But after moving to S3, this is not working anymore. When I hosted the public folder on Heroku it worked fine.</p>

<p>Any idea how I can fix this? I would appreciate a solution that doesn't involve major modifications to the javascript, since it is automatically generated.</p>

<p>The language is Groovy</p>

<p>When I run this method which uses with, id is never set and remains null. All of the other attributes are set properly.</p>

<pre><code>def newSubFnObj( row, id ) {
    def sf = new SubFunction()
    sf.with {
        function    = row.PGM_PROC_FUNC
        subfunction = row.PGM_PROC_SUBF
        name        = getFunctionName( row )
        level       = row.PGM_PROC_LEVEL
        id          = id
    }
    return sf
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I use this method id is set properly and I have no problems.</p>

<pre><code>def newSubFnObj( row, id ) {
    def sf = new SubFunction(function   :row.PGM_PROC_FUNC,
                             subfunction:row.PGM_PROC_SUBF,
                             name       :getFunctionName( row ),
                             level      :row.PGM_PROC_LEVEL,
                             id         :id)
    return sf
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of thoroughness, this method has the correct behavior as well.</p>

<pre><code>def newSubFnObj( row, id ) {
    def sf = new SubFunction()
    sf.function    = row.PGM_PROC_FUNC
    sf.subfunction = row.PGM_PROC_SUBF
    sf.name        = getFunctionName(row)
    sf.level       = row.PGM_PROC_LEVEL
    sf.id          = id
    return sf
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a third also related method for context purposes.</p>

<pre><code>def setParentChildInformation( subfunctions ) {
    subfunctions.eachWithIndex { s, i -&gt;
        if ( i &gt; 0 ) {
            def parentNotFound = true
            def x = i
            while ( parentNotFound &amp;&amp; x &gt;= 0 ) {
                x--
                def possibleParent = subfunctions[x]
                if ( s.levelNumber &gt; possibleParent.levelNumber ) {
                    parentNotFound = false
                    possibleParent.childSubfunctions &lt;&lt; s.id
                    s.parentId = possibleParent.id
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One more method for context purposes.</p>

<pre><code>def getFunctionName( row ) {
    return ""${row.PGM_PROC_FUNC}${row.PGM_PROC_SUBF}"".toString()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code for the SubFunction class</p>

<pre><code>class SubFunction {
    def id
    def parentId
    def name 
    def function
    def subfunction
    def level
    def levelNumber
    def rows = []
    def lines = []
    def statements = []
    def childSubfunctions = []
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am not so much concerned with which way of doing things is better. Using with is a groovier way of performing attribute assignment within an object. I just seek to shed some light on why exactly this behavior is occurring.</p>

<p>Background on Deal or No Deal: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_or_No_Deal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_or_No_Deal</a></p>

<p>In working up to the final product, I have written various classes.  However, I am trying to test one of my classes, and continue to get the <code>NullPointerException.</code>  </p>

<p>I wrote a class called Box, that creates ""box"" objects.  The box object is the actual box that a player picks.  It consists of a true/false value and a double boxValue.  The <code>boolean variable</code> denotes whether it's open/closed (true for open, false for closed).  The double boxValue is the actual value assigned to the box.</p>

<pre><code>public class Box {

//instance fields
private double boxValue; // the amount of $ in each box
private boolean openClose; // whether or not the box is closed


//Constructor
public Box(double boxValue) {
    this.openClose = false;      
    this.boxValue = boxValue;

    if (boxValue &lt; 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Box value must be greater than 0"");
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have written another class called BoxList as well.  This creates a Box object array that will serve as the playing board, when combined with further classes that I am planning to write.  The main idea is that the constructor in BoxList creates the array by using a passed in <code>double array</code> as a paramater, and then creates a Box Object array of the same length of the passed in double array, and assigns the double value of each element of the <code>parameter array</code>, to the value of the Box object <code>array</code> as the corresponding element.</p>

<p>I wrote a sample main method to test, but when I try to get the value of a particular <code>element</code> of a Box in the BoxList array, I get the NullPointerException.  Can anyone offer advice to help trouble shoot this.  </p>

<p>(These are snips of a larger program...I already wrote so much that I didn't want to clog further)</p>

<pre><code>public class BoxList {

private Box[] boxArray;

public BoxList(double[] monetaryAmounts) {
    Box[] boxArray = new Box[monetaryAmounts.length];

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; boxArray.length; i++) {
        boxArray[i] = new Box(monetaryAmounts[i]);
    }

}

public double getValue(int index) {
    return boxArray[index].getValue();
}


// A sample main method to test out various object methods
public static void main(String[] args) {
    double[] monetaryAmounts = {.5, 1, 3, 7.5, 8, 10}; // test array

    BoxList test = new BoxList(monetaryAmounts); 

    System.out.println(test.getValue(0));

I have a button which when clicked creates a circle at specified position on the panel and the circle is draggable. For dragging i have used gwt-dnd. I have also added a click handler to the circle which when click should print ""ERD Circle"".</p>

<p>Here is the code layout:</p>

<pre><code>	Button b = new Button(""Circle"");
	b.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler(){
		@Override
		public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		    Circle c = new Circle(20, 15, 10);
		    d.add(c);
		    c.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler(){
				@Override

					// TODO Auto-generated method stub
					System.out.println(""ERD Circle"");
				}			    	
		    });
		    dragController.makeDraggable(d);
		    boundaryPanel.add(d, 200, 200 );
		}			
	});
</code></pre>

<p>This button is then added to an absolutepanel which in turn is added to the rootpanel.</p>

<p>Problem that i am facing is click handler does not work when it is made draggable. If i remove </p>

<pre><code>dragController.makeDraggable(d);
</code></pre>

<p>click handler works perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am i doing anything wrong here?</li>
<li>If the code is correct, then is there anything else that i need to add to get both click handler and draggable working?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any suggestions will be of great help.</p>

"14485127","1","","","2013-01-23 16:57:21","","2","419","<p>I have an HTML5 canvas app with a couple normal buttons underneath.  I have tooltips on the buttons, and they seem to work fine under static circumstances.  (I still don't understand why tooltips for disabled buttons appear differently from tooltips for enabled buttons.)</p>

<p>When I hover over an enabled button, its tooltip appears above the button on the canvas surface.  (These are normal jQuery tooltips.)  When the pointer leaves the button, the tooltip goes away.</p>

<p>However, if I push the button (of course the tooltip is showing at that point), my button starts an animated sequence on the canvas, and <strong>the tooltip stays there on the canvas forever</strong>.  Moving the mouse elsewhere doesn't cancel the tooltip after animation starts.  Other tooltips continue to work fine.</p>

<p>In the process of animation I am clearing and redrawing the canvas dozens of times, but the tooltip remains visible, so it is its own rectangle separate from the canvas.</p>

<p>I tried setting the button title to null and empty before redrawing in the animation.  Neither helped.  I'd like to create a synthetic mouseleave for the button, but I don't know how to do that.</p>

<p>This happens on Chrome and Firefox.</p>

<p>Any other thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
As I cut down my substantial program trying to create a small fiddle, as Wolf suggested, I found the source of the problem.</p>

<p>Once you disable a button, it's tooltip won't go away.  If you un-disable the button, the tooltip still doesn't go away.  But if you then hover over the button in the un-disabled state and then un-hover, the tooltip will go away.</p>

<p>Apparently, the code that handles the tooltip (browser?) doesn't process the button tooltip on mouseleave if the button is disabled.  But it will properly process any mouseleave after the button is re-enabled.</p>

<p>I consider this a bug, and I don't see a good workaround.  I can't know whether the tooltip is showing when I want to disable the button.  I will submit it to the jQuery team.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

<p><strong>Workaround</strong>: call $(""#buttonid"").mouseleave() before disabling button.  The bug appears to be in several browsers, and it may even be called a feature, so it's not likely to be fixed soon.  The workaround has the disadvantage that it makes the user move the pointer to get the tooltip back, so a proper solution in the browsers would be better.  But at least there is a reasonable workaround.</p>

I enabled debugging and saw messages like this in the server:</p>

<pre><code>The communication object, System.ServiceModel.Channels.ServerReliableDuplexSessionChannel, cannot be used for communication because it has been Aborted.
</code></pre>

<p>The pattern is like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>client is sending query</li>
<li>service is processing the query</li>
<li>service is sending something back</li>
<li>Activity boundary is of level ""Stop"" - everything seems fine</li>
<li>Add inactivityTimeout of reliable session to the datetime of last contact and you have the timestamp of the exception thrown by the service</li>
</ul>

<p>The application goes like this: The service instance provides an API methods to interact with a database and is of type ""netTcpBinding"".

<p>Is there anything wrong here? What is the best configuration for these kind of applications?</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>I encountered one thing: </p>

<p>In one service contract, I change something and notify all connected clients. It usually works fine, at least in my tests. But last ""crash"" or ""freeze"" I stepped through the log and saw that the latest function was where I use callback contracts to notify the clients.</p>

<p>What I want to do there: I save something to the database and at the end I notify all connected clients of the change. I think that the list of connected clients is not current anymore and it runs into a timeout at this step.</p>

<p>Now the question is how to avoid these timeouts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I use threading in the service? I think the threads will be killed as soon as the service call ends, am I right here?</li>
<li>I could implement a static queue function which does all the callback-notification (this is something Marc_S suggested)</li>
<li>Is there a way to reliably detect connection drops inside the server?</li>
</ul>

From what I can tell, my server is connecting just fine to gmail, but PHPMailer still fails to connect.  Here is my PHP:</p>

<pre><code>require_once($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].""/phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php"");        
$host = ""smtp.gmail.com"";
$port = ""587"";
$checkconn = fsockopen($host, $port, $errno, $errstr, 5);
if(!$checkconn){
    echo ""($errno) $errstr"";
} else {
    echo 'Connected through fsocketopen.&lt;br /&gt;';
}

$mail = new PHPMailer();

$mail-&gt;IsSMTP();
$mail-&gt;Host = ""smtp.gmail.com"";
$mail-&gt;SMTPAuth = true;
$mail-&gt;SMTPSecure = ""ssl"";
$mail-&gt;Username = ""myemail@gmail.com"";
$mail-&gt;Password = ""********"";
$mail-&gt;Port = ""587""; 
</code></pre>

<p>The credentials are not shown, but are 100% correct.  Here are the results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Connected through fsocketopen.<br />Mailer Error: SMTP Connect()
  failed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the server is allowing a connection to gmail through fsocketopen, but PHPMailer will not connect.  I've even accessed my server through SSH, and received the following response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-bash-4.1$ telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
      Trying 2607:f8b0:400d:c02::6d...
      Connected to smtp.gmail.com.
      Escape character is '^]'.
      220 mx.google.com ESMTP g1sm52568728qec.9 - gsmtp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So two tests verify connection between my server and Gmail is available.  So now I'm left to assume that there is a problem with my PHPMailer.  I've scanned through the class.phpmailer.php file, but I just don't know enough about it to see where there would be a problem.  Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>The way I was thinking about storing the data is as a javascript object as follows:</p>

<p>It seems easy to store it as a string and use it using effects=eval(effectsString)

Before I put it online, there's two things I'd like to rectify, my account registration page and my Support Ticket system.</p>

<p><strong>With the account registration system</strong></p>

<p>After a users details have been validated, a query is executed to insert their details into the database. Simple stuff. For the system however, I use a userID for basically everything, and currently I have to execute another query to select the auto_incremented userID that was just generated, to get this, before logging in.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>$SQL = ""INSERT INTO ebs_users (`email`, `name`, `password`,`postcode`, `telnum`, ) VALUES ('$email', $name', '$password','$postcode','$telnum');"";
  $SQL = Query($SQL);

$SQL = ""SELECT userID FROM ebs_users WHERE email = '$email';"";
  $_SESSION['userID'] = mysqli_fetch_assoc($SQL);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>With my support tickets</strong></p>

<p>I have a table of Tickets and a table of Messages, Tickets represent the whole enquiry as a whole, and a message is, well, one specific message in that enquiry. Currently I create a somewhat unique ID by exploding the message, hashing the first word, inserting it with the ticket and then using this little snippet to fetch the recently created ID, there most be an easier way to simply fetching an ID?</p>

<p>I've read that there's the function mysqli_insert_id, which will return the last insert ID. Would this function return the exact ID of the row I've just created?</p>

I am able to include the wordpress so that the custom page has access to posts, etc. but even using this
echo do_shortcode('[frontier-post]');
would not help me. (even if header is included)</p>

"19847038","1","19847953","","2013-11-07 21:27:39","","0","88","<p>I am working on an image gallery and need to some assistance with looping over the categories. The next depth is a known setting in the gallery config's file, so this isn't a question about looping over an infinite depth, but much rather the most effecient way to loop over a known depth, and output all of the results.</p>

<p>Essentially, I want to create a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> box which contains all of the categories defined in the system, including children, grand-children, etc.</p>

<p>The categories are stored in the database as follows (there are other fields, but they're not relevant):</p>

<pre><code>+----+--------+--------------+
| id | parent |     name     |
+----+--------+--------------+
|  1 |    0   | Parent 1     |
|  2 |    1   | Child Lvl  1 |
|  3 |    2   | Child Lvl 2  | 
|  4 |    0   | Parent 2     |
+----+--------+--------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Any category that has a <code>parent</code> == 0 is considered itself a top-level parent. As I mentioned already, the maximum depth is known and predetermined, so I would like to output something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Parent 1
  - Child Lvl 1
    - Child Lvl 2
Parent 2
</code></pre>

<p>I had thought that this would be possible a <code>while</code> loop, but for some reason this causes PHP to enter an infinite loop. </p>

<p>Here's the code that I have tried so far:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = $_database-&gt;prepare(""SELECT `id`, `name` FROM `"".TBL_PREFIX.""categories` WHERE `parent` = '0' ORDER BY `name` ASC"");
$sql-&gt;execute();
while($cat = $sql-&gt;fetchObject())
{
    $html.= ""\n\t"".'&lt;option value=""'.$cat-&gt;id.'""';
    $html.= (array_key_exists('selected_val', $options) &amp;&amp; $options['selected_val'] == $cat-&gt;id) ? ' selected=""selected""' : '';
    $html.= (array_key_exists('disabled_vals', $options) &amp;&amp; in_array('', $options['disabled_vals'])) ? ' disabled=""disabled""' : '';
    $html.= '&gt;'.$cat-&gt;name.'&lt;/option&gt;';

    $childSql = $_database-&gt;prepare(""SELECT COUNT(*) AS `total` FROM `"".TBL_PREFIX.""categories` WHERE `parent` = :parent"");
    $childSql-&gt;execute(array(':parent' =&gt; $cat-&gt;id));

    $numChildren = $childSql-&gt;fetchObject();
    $numChildren = $numChildren-&gt;total;
    $parentId = $cat-&gt;id;

    while($numChildren &gt; 0)
    {
        for($i = 0; $i &lt; (MAX_CAT_DEPTH - 1); $i++)
        {
            $children = $_database-&gt;prepare(""SELECT `id`, `name` FROM `catgeories` WHERE `parent` = :parent ORDER BY `name` ASC"");
            $children-&gt;execute(array(':parent' =&gt; $parentId));

            while($child = $children-&gt;fetchObject())
            {
                $html.= ""\n\t"".'&lt;option value=""'.$child-&gt;id.'""';
                $html.= (array_key_exists('selected_val', $options) &amp;&amp; $options['selected_val'] == $child-&gt;id) ? ' selected=""selected""' : '';
                $html.= (array_key_exists('disabled_vals', $options) &amp;&amp; in_array('', $options['disabled_vals'])) ? ' disabled=""disabled""' : '';
                $html.= '&gt;'.$child-&gt;name.'&lt;/option&gt;';

                $parentId = $child-&gt;id;

                $childSql = $_database-&gt;prepare(""SELECT COUNT(*) AS `total` FROM `"".TBL_PREFIX.""categories` WHERE `parent` = :parent"");
                $childSql-&gt;execute(array(':parent' =&gt; $parentId));
                $numChildren = $childSql-&gt;fetchObject();
                $numChildren = $numChildren-&gt;total;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Could anyone suggest the correct manner to go about this. I'd rather not play around too much with the DB structure, since I believe that the one I have already is more than adequate for the requirement here - this is not a question about infinite depth as other questions.</p>

<p>3) Why <code>$2y$10$</code> is used? Could that change in the future? So in my DB I have passwords with <code>$2y$10$</code> and some with <code>$2y$25$</code>? and everything would run smoothly using <code>password_verify</code>?</p>

Please bear with me as I really need this to be done.</p>

<p>I expected to see the number 3 as I clicked the text 'SET SO'. However, it seems that syncHandler is never fired. What should I do to make it work? Have I missed out something? Was the server correctly linked?</p>

miniFilter as example.
An InstaceSetup routin by default is attaching to all volumes. But I don't want 
to attach to all of them, only to some choosen...</p>

<p>I tried to set ""NULL"" instead of ""InstanceSetup"" in ""FLT_REGISTRATION 
FilterRegistration"" and then to call ""FltAttachVolume"" in the ""DriverEntry"" 
routin. I've done the following:</p>

<p>PFLT_VOLUME vol;
UNICODE_STRING vname;
....
RtlInitUnicodeString(&amp;vname, L""E:\"");
FltGetVolumeFromName(gFilterHandle, &amp;vname, &amp;vol);
...
FltAttachVolume(gFilterHandle, vol, NULL, NULL);
...</p>

<p>When i tried to call FltAttachVolume with the ""NULL"" 3-d parameter 
(PCUNICODE_STRING InstanceName) i received a 
<strong>""STATUS_FLT_INSTANCE_NAME_COLLISION""</strong> error.</p>

<p>If i call FltAttachVolume with a ""NOT NULL"" 3-d parameter, such as a 
""UniqueInstaceName"" it returns me <strong>""-2145452013""</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm receiving the same errors, when i,m trying to attach a volume, using a 
FilterAttach routine from my User application, like this:</p>

<p>...
driver.driverName = L""swapBuffers"";
...
LPCWSTR vname = L""F:\"";
...
FilterAttach(driver.driverName, vname, NULL, NULL, NULL);</p>

<p>With ""NULL"" 3-d  parameter (LPCWSTR lpInstanceName): 
<strong>""ERROR_FLT_INSTANCE_NAME_COLLISION""</strong></p>

<p>With ""NOT-NULL"": <strong>""-2145452013""</strong>.</p>

<p>In MiniSpy miniFilter there is a User application, and the routine FilterAttach 
is used. I tried to call this routine in my application the same way - no 
results. </p>

<p>Finally, i changed the swapBuffers inf-file:</p>

<ul>
<li>there was no DefaultInstance parameter, i set it: ""SwapBuffers - Top 
Instance"".</li>
<li><p>also i copied this from the MiniSpy inf-file:</p>

<p>[MiniFilter.AddRegistry]
HKR,""Instances"",""DefaultInstance"",0x00000000,%DefaultInstance%
HKR,""Instances\""%Instance1.Name%,""Altitude"",0x00000000,%Instance1.Altitude%
HKR,""Instances\""%Instance1.Name%,""Flags"",0x00010001,%Instance1.Flags%
HKR,""Instances\""%Instance2.Name%,""Altitude"",0x00000000,%Instance2.Altitude%
HKR,""Instances\""%Instance2.Name%,""Flags"",0x00010001,%Instance2.Flags%
HKR,""Instances\""%Instance3.Name%,""Altitude"",0x00000000,%Instance3.Altitude%
HKR,""Instances\""%Instance3.Name%,""Flags"",0x00010001,%Instance3.Flags%</p>

<p>.............
Instance1.Name          = ""SwapBuffers - Middle Instance""
Instance1.Altitude      = ""370000""
Instance1.Flags         = 0x1          ; Suppress automatic attachments
Instance2.Name          = ""SwapBuffers - Bottom Instance""
Instance2.Altitude      = ""361000""
Instance2.Flags         = 0x1          ; Suppress automatic attachments
Instance3.Name          = ""SwapBuffers - Top Instance""
Instance3.Altitude      = ""385100""
Instance3.Flags         = 0x1          ; Suppress automatic attachments</p></li>
</ul>

<p>changing the flags to 0x1 to suppress automatic attachments.
And only installing my SwapBuffers miniFilter through this Inf file, i received 
<strong>""STATUS_SUCCESS""</strong> from FltAttachVolume routine in my driver. But it isn't really 
attaching to the disk...</p>

<p>What am i doing wrong? 
Thanks.</p>

<p>My intention is to wrap the execution of a method annotated with a custom annotation with an AOP advice that will track how long the method takes to run.  When i run my test, i see the output of the method but the advice is not being run (i'm expecting it to log some output).</p>

<p>Here's the Aspect class:</p>

<pre><code>@Aspect
class LatencyProfiler {

    private LatencyTrackerFactory factory = LatencyTrackerFactory.NOOP;

    @Pointcut(value=""execution(@ProfileLatency * *(..)) &amp;&amp; @annotation(annotation)"", argNames=""annotation"")
    public void profiled(ProfileLatency annotation) {}

        ILatencyTracker tracker;

        try {
            tracker = factory.create(annotation.trackerName(), annotation.trackerNameSuffix());
        } catch (ConfigException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }

        tracker.begin();
        Object ret = pjp.proceed();
        tracker.end(null);

        return ret;
    }

   @Optional
    public void setFactory(LatencyTrackerFactory factory) {
        this.factory = factory;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Followed by the Annotation:</p>

<pre><code>@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface ProfileLatency {
    String trackerName();
    String trackerNameSuffix() default""[unassigned]"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Followed by a test class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test {
    private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(Test.class);

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor().schedule(new Runnable() {
                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 60; i++) {

                        }
                    }

    }

    @ProfileLatency(trackerName = ""latency"", trackerNameSuffix = ""s"")
    public void foo() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Spring configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;
&lt;aop:aspectj-autoproxy&gt;
    &lt;aop:include name=""latencyProfileAspect""/&gt;
&lt;/aop:aspectj-autoproxy&gt;

&lt;bean
    id    = ""latencyLogger""
    class = ""util.logging.LatencyLogger""

    p:factory-ref = ""trackerFactory""

&lt;bean id = ""test"" class=""util.Test""/&gt;

<p>Here's a short summary of what it does:</p>

<p>It can record human speach, save it to a wav file and send it to a webservice. The webservice can analize it send some metadata back to the client. So the application is accessing the microphone and the hdd of my computer and can communicate with other services.</p>

<p>I need to migrate this to android and iOS. I was looking for a solution, where I can develop once and compile the result to android and iOS. I found e.g. <a href=""http://www.haxe.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">haxe</a> or <a href=""http://jquerymobile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery Mobile</a> as cross-phone-development solutions.</p>

<p>The requirements for the cross-framework are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to be able to access the microphone</li>
<li>I need to be able to record and store wav files on the phone</li>
<li>I need to be able to tell the user when wlan is available for cheap data transfer</li>
<li>I need to be able to send the files to webservices and wait for results *</li>
</ul>

<p>My problem is that I cannot access the phone's microphone and storage with javaScript, or can I? Do you see a way/framework that allows me to develop once and compile everywhere? Or must I learn Objective-C and Android to accomplish what I want to do?</p>

<p>I'm new to this phone-development thing and would be very pleased if you could point me to the right direction.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Examples: Prototype Chaining - <code>someObject.prototype = new someOtherObject();</code></p>

<p>Instantiating an object <code>var myArray = new Array()</code> </p>

<p>Similar right? </p>

<p>Additionally the book(JavaScript for web developers, By:Nicholas Zakas) stated, a link exists between an instance and a constructor's prototype.(The link is usually known as <code>__proto__</code>)</p>

<p>So can one argue that instantiating a object is like inheritance?</p>

<p>Problem: While I get a line between the 2 divs, the line extends all the way to the bottom, hitting the container. This is due to not knowing the max height of the 2 inner divs and thus having to use the <code>padding-bottom: 500px</code> and <code>margin-bottom: -500px</code> trick.</p>

<p>I would like to have the line dividing the 2 inner divs, but there should be some space between the bottom of the line and the containing div:</p>

For image2, image3 etc. I copy the function printImage1 and change imgage1 from above to image2, image3 etc. This is redundant programming thats why I want to specify the image in the argumant using only one function printImage.</p>

        this.id = id;

<p>I want to serialize an Item to this JSON:</p>

<pre><code>{""id"":7, ""itemNr"":""TEST"", ""createdBy"":3}
</code></pre>

<p>with User serialized to only include the <code>id</code>. I will also be able to serilize all user objects to JSON like:</p>

<pre><code>{""id"":3, ""name"": ""Jonas"", ""email"": ""jonas@example.com""}
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess that I need to write a custom serializer for <code>Item</code> and tried with this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ItemSerializer extends JsonSerializer&lt;Item&gt; {

@Override
public void serialize(Item value, JsonGenerator jgen,
        SerializerProvider provider) throws IOException,
        JsonProcessingException {

    jgen.writeNumberField(""itemNr"", value.itemNr);
    jgen.writeNumberField(""createdBy"", value.user.id);
    jgen.writeEndObject();
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>I serialize the JSON with this code from <a href=""http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHowToCustomSerializers"">Jackson How-to: Custom Serializers</a>:</p>

<pre><code>ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
SimpleModule simpleModule = new SimpleModule(""SimpleModule"", 
                                              new Version(1,0,0,null));
simpleModule.addSerializer(new ItemSerializer());
mapper.registerModule(simpleModule);
StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
try {
    mapper.writeValue(writer, myItem);
} catch (JsonGenerationException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (JsonMappingException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: JsonSerializer of type com.example.ItemSerializer does not define valid handledType() (use alternative registration method?)

<p><strong>How can I use a custom Serializer with Jackson?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>This is how I would do it with Gson:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserAdapter implements JsonSerializer&lt;User&gt; {

    @Override 
    public JsonElement serialize(User src, java.lang.reflect.Type typeOfSrc,
            JsonSerializationContext context) {

    }
}

    GsonBuilder builder = new GsonBuilder();
    builder.registerTypeAdapter(User.class, new UserAdapter());
    Gson gson = builder.create();
    String json = gson.toJson(myItem);
    System.out.println(""JSON: ""+json);

<p>So we intend on leveraging Duplicate Detection, but there are some nuances that I cannot glean from the documentation or from previous questions. The parameters are:</p>

<p>What I can't find out is a way to disable ""historical"" duplicate detection but enable ""waiting"" duplicate detection - detect messages waiting in the queue but not those that have already been processed. Does the Duplicate detection history mechanism work only on completed messages or is the timeframe also relevant to waiting messages relative to each other?</p>

<p>For #3, I am considering solving that by adding a 5 minute delay to processing any message, so that if one is created while one is processing, there is enough time for the processing one to complete. </p>

<p>A basic select statement would be ""SELECT v.view_id FROM <code>profile_views</code> v WHERE v.profile_id='125'""</p>

<p>I need the speed for the SELECT statements even if the table gets into 100s of thousands of rows.</p>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong>
-> Is it wise to add an index to <code>profile_id</code> as well? Does that help speed up the 'where' clause?
-> If I would like to have details of a number of profiles on one page, should I index <code>profile_id</code> and create a foreign key constraint to the table <code>profiles</code>.<code>profile_id</code></p>

<p>(using mySQL 5.* INNODB)</p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestions! Not sure what is best for scalability (or perhaps I am approaching it all wrong).</p>

<p>Hi, My name is Jonas and i am attending a university course in Android programming.
I always have to take the hard way and going AndEngine. </p>

<p>In the above picture you can see that i am using a Parallax background with three layers.
I am making a sidescroller so the bottom layer with the blue line that is an ice track is scrolling. I want to animate this picture and put it on the track.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JGisC.png"" alt=""Picture i want to animate""></p>

<p>When i load it as i animate the two people in the backgroud that is animated in the same way the emulator is going apeshit and showing me a small triangle of the picture in the corner of the screen. A animated picture that works is this one:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Czfn.png"" alt=""(Picture that works.)""></p>

<p>Is my animated picture of the horse to big or is it something else i am doing wrong. There is not much i find on the internet about this matter! I would really appreciate all the help i can get! </p>

<p>Benefits: </p>

<ul>
<li>Keys are close to values (more visual and clearer code when looping and pulling the values)</li>

<ul>
<li>More overhead for multiple records (repetition of keys)</li>
</ul>

<p>1) The square card reader works by sending its information through the headphone jack, so it can handle information input. <a href=""https://squareup.com/reader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://squareup.com/reader</a><br>
2) In order to get the audio from the player to the phone, I will be using a normal aux-aux cable, similar to those used connecting a music player to speakers. The fact that the audio can be passed to the speakers through a simple two ring cable. I know usually the two rings are used only for output with a third ring for input, but it seems to me this would suggest they are capable of inputting without the third ring.  </p>

<p>My problem is there doesn't seem to be any api to deal with input through the headphone jack, and no one seems to know how the square reader works, or deals with the input. It looks like AudioRecord, <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord.html</a>, could have some potential to work, but it seems to need the size to be specified ahead of time, which is not ideal.  </p>

<p>So if anyone could help me with any information on AudioRecord and how it works, or an alternative way of dealing with the input, I'd appreciate it. Also if someone  knows for sure if I am correct in thinking the two ring cable can deal with input, that would also help a lot. Thanks.</p>

I'm not sure if I have set things up correctly or not, but everything seems to work except that <code>server.log</code> is not ending up where I think I am telling it to be saved in 3 of 4 deployments.</p>

<p>There are 4 HTTP ports being used for the deployments. They are <code>:8080</code>, <code>:8180</code>, <code>:9876</code>, and <code>:9976</code>. I don't know if that is relevant information or not, but I bring it up because in each <code>standalone.xml</code> file I am using the <code>jboss.socket.binding.port-offset</code> option to assign the ports. The only deployment that seems to work flawlessly is <code>:8080</code>, which has <code>jboss.socket.binding.port-offset:0</code>. <code>:8180</code> has <code>jboss.socket.binding.port-offset:100</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Each deployment lives in its own directory, for example</p>

<pre><code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone8080/
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone9876/
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>standalone.xml</code> file for each deployment (<code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone9876/configuration/standalone.xml</code>, for example), the server log is specified in the same way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;file relative-to=""jboss.server.log.dir"" path=""server.log""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This should result in the server.log being saved in, for example,
<code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone9876/log</code>,
and when redeploying the software on each port, I have echoed out the <code>$JBOSS_LOG_DIR</code> variable and it seems on the surface to be set correctly in each case.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, as mentioned above, <em>only</em> port <code>:8080</code> creates the <code>server.log</code> file in the expected location (<code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone8080/log</code>).</p>

<p><strong>The incorrect locations:</strong></p>

<p>--Port <code>:8180</code> puts its <code>server.log</code> file in the <code>:8080</code> location. I.e., <code>:8180</code> overwrites the <code>server.log</code> file at <code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone8080/log</code>.</p>

<p>--Port <code>:9876</code> puts its server.log file in <code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone/log</code>. I.e., it creates a new folder simply called <code>standalone</code> and puts the file there. I will add that in a former time, the entire port <code>:9876</code> deployment lived in a folder at that path (<code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone</code>). This apparent clue makes me think there is some other place where there is a setting for the <code>server.log</code> file path. I could be quite wrong.</p>

<p>--Finally, port <code>:9976</code> is putting its server.log file one level above the desired <code>log</code> directory, in other words, at <code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone9976</code>.</p>

<p>I don't know if the way these 4 deployments are being handled is fundamentally incorrect or if there is a setting hiding somewhere that is overriding my desired paths.</p>

<p>I saw <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19039755/jboss-7-1-1-does-not-create-server-log"">one poster</a> with a similar problem say they made a change to <code>domain.xml</code> to fix the issue. I don't think I can do that, since I only have one <code>domain.xml</code> file (located in <code>/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/domain/configuration</code>)  that is associated with all 4 deployments.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9910571/how-to-configure-jboss-7-to-write-logs-to-different-folder/9913943#9913943"">Another post</a> recommended removing the ""relative-to"" bit in the <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> tag in the <code>standalone.xml</code> file. I tried that with port <code>:9876</code> as follows: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;file path=""/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone9876/log/server.log""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This did not work for me. The server.log file still ended up in</p>

<pre><code>&lt;file path=""/opt/jboss-eap-6.1/target/standalone/log/server.log""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas what I am doing wrong? Is there simply another place I need to declare my log path, or is the way these 4 servers are set up just plain incorrect?</p>

"31839568","1","","","2015-08-05 17:56:18","","0","23","<p>SOLVED: $.extend() twice in a row simply overwrites the previous object because objects are passed by reference. My fix was to do this: </p>

<pre><code>var updateUserObj = $.extend({}, validationPluginDefaults);
    var newUserObj = $.extend({}, validationPluginDefaults);
</code></pre>

<p>Then the validators are executed like this: </p>

<pre><code>var whateverValidator = $.extend(updateUserObj,{new rules})
</code></pre>

<p>Update: Further research shows that what I'm trying to do appears to be correct but the problem may be in the object I am extending - ""validationPluginDefaults""). Here it is below: </p>

<pre><code>var validationPluginDefaults = {
ignore: [],
errorElement: 'p', //default input error message container &lt;p&gt;
errorClass: 'text-error', // default input error message class
focusInvalid: true, //focus on the first invalid field
messages: {},
invalidHandler: function (event, validator) { //display error alert on form submit 

},
highlight: function (el) { // hightlight error inputs
    //jQuery(el).closest('.control-group').addClass('error'); // set error class to the control group
},
success: function (err, el) {
    jQuery(el).next("".text-error"").hide();
    jQuery(el).next("".text-error"").remove();


},
errorPlacement: function (error, element) {
    error.insertAfter(element);
},
onfocusin: function () {},
onfocusout: function () {}
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>From my testing it appears that even though I have two separate forms on a JSP page and each has different validation that I can still only use one jQuery Validate Plugin instance per page; is this correct? </p>

<p>Here's my code: </p>

<pre><code>// Define validation rules for form one
    var formOneValidator = $.extend(validationPluginDefaults,{
        rules: {
            firstName: {
                minlength: 2,
                onlyAlphaAndHyphen: true,
                required: true,
            },
            lastName: {
                minlength: 2,
                required: true,
            },
            email: {
                required: true,
                email: true
            }
        }
    });

    var formTwoValidator = $.extend(validationPluginDefaults,{
        rules: {
            newFirstName: {
                minlength: 2,
                onlyAlphaAndHyphen: true,
                required: true,
            },
            newLastName: {
                minlength: 2,
                required: true,
            },
            newEmail: {
                required: true,
                email: true,
            }
        }
    });

    $(""#formOne"").validate(formOneValidator); 
    $(""#formTwo"").validate(formTwoValidator);
</code></pre>

<p>What happens here is that formOne validator takes on all the rules of formTwoValidator after this code executes. </p>

<p>Is the solution to have only one validator and swap out rules depending on which form I'm in? It just seems strange that I wouldn't be able to define separate validators for each form on the page. Am I fundamentally misunderstanding something here? </p>

<p><strong>Using += Syntax</strong></p>

<pre><code>program returns [someInterface result]
  : m+=method* EOF {result = new SomeClass(m);};

method returns [SomeMethod result] : &lt;definition here&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This fails with...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>rule '+=' list labels are not allowed

</blockquote>

<p>If I set the output to either ""AST"" or ""template"" (the only options) the method signatures of the generated class change. That is, <code>m</code> will not by a List of SomeMethod(s) but rather a List of Nodes or Templates respectively. I am open to suggestions if there is a way to make this method work.</p>

<p><strong>Using Rule Scopes</strong></p>

<pre><code>program returns [CompilesToJavaByteCode result]
    scope {
      List&lt;SomeMethod&gt; methods;

    @init {

<p><strong>The End Goal</strong></p>

<p>I want to build a set of classes that represent my language (Class, Method, Variable, Statement, ect) so that I can do some static analysis and optimization before I generate compiled code. To that end, I need to be able to consume lists. I expected += syntax to ""just work"" but I might be missing something. The second method works but seem overly verbose and inelegant. </p>

The process takes several days to complete and I'm looking at ways to speed it up a bit. Approximately 1/3 of the time is parsing the text, and 2/3 of the time in the database I/O.</p>

<p>I thought a simple solution would be to split these out into separate threads. So while one thread is writing to the database the other can be parsing the text. I changed the code to build up a list of SqlCommand objects that need to be executed, these are then passed to a new thread for execution once parsing is complete.</p>

<p>On a small sample executing the batch of SqlCommand objects in a single thread takes 37 seconds, I was then surprised when I switched to execute these in a separate thread that the process slowed down massively, taking a total of 63.34 seconds. I did some poking around and eventually decided to run some performance analysis in Visual Studio. I ran Instrumentation to measure timing on the multi threaded version and was amazed when it ran in 31.04 seconds. I reran all tests several times with more or less the same results. So it appears than when running performance analysis the splitting on the workload improves performance, but when not running performance analysis it slows down.</p>

<p>If anyone can help indicate what might be causing this and where I should be looking to fix it that would be fantastic!</p>

<p>The tests are being run in a quad core VMware virtual machine running on a 6 core host.</p>

<p>edit: Having looked into this further the offending lines appears to be the ones related to the parsing and nothing to do with the DB, mainly fileText.Trim(). Why these should run much slower with the debugger attached I have no idea.</p>

<p>This describes the positioning of the two elements ( nav and holder ).  In theory, nav is positioned almost entirely off canvas and slides in on hover.  However, this is not happening at all.  What is happening is that nav is being displayed directly about holder, with holder being dropped down below nav.  Nothing is off canvas, and nothing transforms. Below I will post the CSS for the transforms and the html that is generated.</p>

<pre><code>#holder, #holder:after, #hav, #nav:after
  -webkit-transition: all 600ms ease
  -moz-transition: all 600ms ease
  -ms-transition: all 600ms ease
  -o-transition: all 600ms ease
  transition: all 600ms ease

#nav:hover
  left: 0

#nav:hover ~ #holder
  -webkit-transform: translateX(16em) perspective(600px) rotateY(10deg)
  -moz-transform: translateX(16em) perspective(600px) rotateY(10deg)
  -ms-transform: translateX(16em) perspective(600px) rotateY(10deg)
  -o-transform: translateX(16em) perspective(600px) rotateY(10deg)
  transform: translateX(16em) perspective(600px) rotateY(10deg)

#nav:hover ~ #holder:after
  left: 60%
</code></pre>

<p>And..</p>

<pre><code>     &lt;body id=""body""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""nav""&gt;

<p>I've looked at the Shift() mixin for Neat, but there is precious little documentation on it.  I honestly can't tell if this would even work for me, or how to implement it if that were the case.  There are literally like 3 lines total in the Neat Documentation for it.  Any help, tips, or, really, anything not terribly insulting will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I remove it, everything works, I put it back, everything stops working. Yes, I was linking it AFTER my jQuery reference.</p>

<p>I asked it in a simplistic way because I'm assuming there is an easy answer I'm overlooking.</p>

<p>It is able to see if the username and password is incorrect or not, but unable to transition me to the defaultURL following the login page.</p>

<p>Both lists contain <code>ReportData</code> objects, which have fields:</p>

<pre><code>DataDate (DateTime)
quantity (int)
rejected (int)
cumulativeQuantity (int)
cumulativeRejected (int)

<p>In the pass list, I record the date, the quantity, and the cumulativeQuantity passed up to that date. The rejected and cumulativeRejected values are set to zero. I do the opposite for the failed list.</p>

<p>At the end, I would like to combine them to get one <code>List&lt;ReportData&gt;</code> object that has all of the dates.</p>

<p>I do not want to intersect the lists, because technically there are no intersections. While the date may exist in both, the objects are not the same. I considered looping through the pass list, and looking for dates that exist in the failures, and then recording their rejected and cumulativeRejected values. The issue this leads to is that if there are dates that do not exist, I may not know what to set <code>cumulativeRejected</code> to for that date.</p>

<p>Another problem is if an item exists in failures but not passes. In practice, this <em>shouldn't</em> happen, but for intents and purposes of this example it could.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this? It's almost a combination of both an intersect and a union of lists, and I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>If that is a little unclear, consider two lists:</p>

<p>I am finding it funny how when I send a mail from SquirrelMail it goes to the INBOX of Hotmail users, but when I send the same exact from mail(), after setting most of the headers similar, it goes to JUNK. I tried imitating the same headers found in SquirrelMail messages, but still the same.</p>

<p>Thus, I am trying to check: is there a way for my PHP application to use SquirrelMail (as is) to send the mail instead of mail()? I am having hard time solving this issue and the only way to do so is using SquirrelMail.</p>

<p>I have an interesting problem. When I open my access program and use the date picker (its a date field textbox, bound, short date format) I can update an existing record using the date picker (date selected, fills the textbox that is bound to the date field in the DB)... but ONLY add ONCE. This only happens in one form, which is a data-entry form with no edits, deletions etc.  </p>

<p>I'm totally flabbergasted, after saving the record (and I've played around with changing the way it saves the record, from dirty = false and runcommand acccmdsaverecord), I've checked every format option - and I'm really pulling my hair out! This is an enabled and unlocked textbox</p>

<p>The date picker does show, and lets me select a date from the calendar, but then it does not get carried over into the textbox and likewise to the table. </p>

<p>It goes across all forms as well. I've tried removing code, saving, and re-pasting - this did not solve the problem. </p>

Suppose I create several classes, like Car, Truck, Bus, etc. And I create another class SpeedCalculator, which instances of my vehicles will instantiate and contain. (As a newbie, let me note that this strikes me as a good time to declare a class as static and not instantiate it--which vba can't do I don't think... .) Now this speed calculator will be no simple speedometer. Rather it will calculate speed from temperature, windspeed, RPMs, etc, etc--go along with this please, just for the sake of the example. </p>

<p>Now the question is how for the contained object to collect its inputs, which are only available in the container objects (the vehicle objects might implement an interface (if VBA can even do that...)). ""Parent."" is wrong, I figured out eventually, b/c parent-child is an inheritance relation (which VBA doesn't have, again), not a containment relation, and the parent of the contained object is an Excel Application (not my object). So it seems it would be nice if there were another keyword to refer to container properties. I hope I haven't just missed something simple. Or is it more the case that that sort of reference would break object-oriented encapsultaion principles? </p>

<p>I guess a second approach would be to pass the container to the contained, via ""Me"" as an argument. But then you have to multiply all of the contained's methods, either to overload them (if VBA can even do that...), or with variously named versions--due to the different types of the containers (can we be more idealist and avoid declaring as variant or ""Object""?).</p>

<p>And then door #3 would be the last door standing, I guess? Which would be to pass an (annoying) litany of arguments. The definition of all of which would tend to defeat the purpose of having my tidy little calculator class? </p>

<p>I have a <code>Dictionary&lt;int, List&lt;string&gt;&gt;</code> I want to apply various predicates to. I want one method that can take care of multiple LINQ queries such as these:</p>

<pre><code>from x in Dictionary
where x.Value.Contains(""Test"")
select x.Key

from x in Dictionary
where x.Value.Contains(""Test2"")
select x.Key
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm looking for a method like so:</p>

<pre><code>public int GetResult(**WhatGoesHere** filter)
{
    return from x in Dictionary.Where(filter)
           select x.Key;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To be used like so:</p>

<pre><code>int result;

result = GetResult(x =&gt; x.Value.Contains(""Test""));
result = GetResult(x =&gt; x.Value.Contains(""Test2""));

<p>What is the proper syntax for <strong>WhatGoesHere</strong>?</p>

<p>My situation is this: 
I have an API that, when the server errors, returns a content of System.Web.Http.HttpError. </p>

<pre><code>var errorResponse = new ErrorResponseFactory(ex, _showDebug);
System.Web.Http.HttpError error = errorResponse.Error;
return Request.CreateErrorResponse(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError, error);

<p>When doing unit testing - calling the API method directly, I can extract the HttpError just fine. However, when calling the API from another server, All I get in return is an Net.Http.StreamContent. I can't seem to pull out the HTTPError for consumption. </p>

<pre><code> var response =  client.GetAsync(apiSignature).Result;


 // RETURN INSTANCE OF THE REQUESTED RESOURCE
 if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
 {
    return response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NoContent 
    ? default(T)
    : response.Content.ReadAsAsync&lt;T&gt;().Result;
 }

  // DEAL WITH ERROR CASE
  var httpError = GetHttpError(response);

<p>This will always return a null;</p>

<pre><code> protected HttpError GetHttpError(HttpResponseMessage message)
 {
    HttpError err;
    message.TryGetContentValue(out err);
    return err;
 }

<p>I have full control over both code basis, so I am not married to the HTTP error, but I do like what it provides and would like to use it if possible. </p>

  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4783865/how-do-i-abort-cancel-tpl-tasks"">How do I abort/cancel TPL Tasks?</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have a method that takes some time to execute therefore I return the result as a callback. My method looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public static void DoWork( Action&lt;object&gt; onCompleteCallBack)
{
  Task.Factory.StartNew( () =&gt; {
    // Do work
    onCompleteCallBack(someResult);
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I will like to be able to stop executing that method in case the user does not want to wait. As a result this is what I have worked out:</p>

<pre><code>static void Main ( string[] args )
{            
  var cancelMethod = DoWork( x =&gt;
  {                
    // method completed
    Console.Write( x.ToString() );
  });
  Thread.Sleep( 5000 ); // some time passes 

  // then user decides to abort method
  cancelMethod();
  Console.Read();
}

static Action DoWork ( Action&lt;object&gt; onCompleteCallBack )
{
  bool stopExecuting = false;
  Task.Factory.StartNew( () =&gt;
  {
    for ( var i = 0 ; i &lt; 100000 ; i++ ) 
    {
      Thread.Sleep( 1 );
      if ( stopExecuting )
      {
        onCompleteCallBack( ""Method aborted!"" );
        return;
      }
    }         
    onCompleteCallBack( ""Method completed successfully"" );
  } );
  return () =&gt; { stopExecuting = true; };
}
</code></pre>

<p>What will be a more appropriate way of aborting the execution of a method? </p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Thanks for your answers. I remember now about the cancellation token thing. The token thing is hard to remember. I think I will use this approach:</p>

<pre><code>    static void Main ( string[ ] args )
    {
        Action abortTask;

        DoWork( methodCompleted, out abortTask );

        Thread.Sleep( 5000 ); // some time passes then user decides to abort method

        // cancel execution of method
        abortTask( );

        Console.Read( );
    }

    static void methodCompleted ( object msg )
    {            
        Console.Write( msg.ToString( ) );  
    }

    static void DoWork ( Action&lt;object&gt; onCompleteCallBack, out Action abortThisTask )
    {
        bool stopExecuting = false;

        abortThisTask = ( ) =&gt; { stopExecuting = true; };

        Task.Factory.StartNew( ( ) =&gt;
        {
            for ( var i = 0 ; i &lt; 100000 ; i++ ) 
            {
                Thread.Sleep( 1 );

                if ( stopExecuting )
                {
                    onCompleteCallBack( ""Method aborted!"" );
                    return;
                }
            }

            onCompleteCallBack( ""Method completed successfully"" );
        } );            
    }

    // Overloaded method
    static void DoWork ( Action&lt;object&gt; onCompleteCallBack )
    {
        Action abortTask;
        DoWork( onCompleteCallBack ,out abortTask );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Will it be better to use the approaches you guys suggested on the answers to this question vs. This approach. I like this approach better. I think it is easier to read than the cancellation token one.</p>

<p>PS.
My Visual Studio places a lot of spaces. Feel free to format the code :)</p>

<p>I am able to import this data through my code </p>

<pre><code>fid = fopen(uigetfile('.csv'),'rt');
FileName = fopen(fid);
headers = fgets(fid);    %get first line
headers = textscan(headers,'%s','delimiter',';'); %read first line
format = repmat('%f',1,size(headers{1,1},1)); %count columns n makeformat  string
data = textscan(fid,format,'delimiter',';'); %read rest of the file
data = [data{:}];
</code></pre>

<p>I am getting data in matrix form in variable data [1000x10] and name of all the components like HCL, H2SO4 in a cell array named headers{1x1}. </p>

<p>Now I have two questions like the built in import feature in matlab you have flexibility to import data as separate column vectors, numeric matrix,cell array and table format. Is it possible to do as such through code, like i get column vectors with their name HCL with [1000x1] and H2sO4 with [1000x1] in my workspace after import and so on all the column vectors with their names with [1000x1]dimensions.
if yes then help me please...?</p>

<p>If above mentioned is not possible then i can do alternatively that now I have names of column vectors in headers cell array, how I can extract those name and use those names as column vector names through code and I can assign data from data matrix [1000x10] to each column vector with their corresponding names.</p>

<p>like if i say </p>

<pre><code>x = headers {1*1}{1*1}; i will get x = ""HCL"" 
x = genvarname(x); I will get x= x0x22HCL0x2 BUT 
I want that x get replaced with HCL.and then I assign 
HCL = data(:,1) and same like this other variables H2SO4,SULPHUR, CHLORINE.
You can say i try to implement the import feature of column vector through     my code.

<p>This is for a <strong>student</strong> resource.  A <strong>student</strong> has many <strong>course_offerings</strong> through <strong>registrations</strong>.  However, I didn't want users to select the <strong>course_offering</strong> directly from a menu (Since there will be many repeats of the same course each year).  Instead there is an input for <strong>course</strong> and <strong>semester</strong>.  <strong>course</strong> and <strong>semester</strong> are instance variables on the <strong>registration</strong> model.  They are set in the form, then the correct <strong>course_offering</strong> is found in an after save hook and associated with the <strong>registration</strong>.  The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def semester=(s)
  @semester = s.to_i
end

def semester
  self.course_offering.semester
end

def course=(co)
  @course = co.to_i
end

def course
  self.course_offering.course
end

before_save :set_course_offering

def set_course_offering
  self.course_offering = CourseOffering.where(semester_id: @semester, course_id: @course).first
  #TODO: Handle case where no course offering is found
end
</code></pre>

<p>I am having two problems.  The first is that I get a nil pointer error when registrations table is empty.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>undefined method `course' for nil:NilClass</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have accepts_nested_attributes call in my <strong>student</strong> model.</p>

<pre><code>accepts_nested_attributes_for :registrations, :allow_destroy =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>which is the only suggestion I get when looking up the error but still get it despite having that piece of code.  It seems to work fine when I remove the <strong>course</strong> and <strong>semester</strong> and replace it with a <strong>course_offering</strong> instead.</p>

<p>The next problem I have is that the student record does not save after hitting update.  I assume this is because I don't make any changes that write to the database when I only update the two <strong>course</strong> and <strong>semester</strong> instance variables only.  I either need to update another input or add the call to the semester= method.</p>

<pre><code>connectionString=""server=.\;database=VITABASE;trusted_connection=True""
</code></pre>

<p>replacing dot with name of server and installing application.... app cannot connect to server... and there is no password and nothing on server...</p>

<p>2nd problem is configuring sql server to be avaliable over network so I can Install my app on three other machines running network sql remote server...
Never done that earlier so if anyone could help It would be appriciated...
I found many tutorials how to configure sql connection remotely but in a sea of tuts cannot determine what is the best solution... may of them are telling you to hardcode the IP ADRESS of server but what if that IP ADRESS is dynamical???</p>

<p>I have patients with one of 2 strats (conditions).</p>

<p>I will have to calculate the Allocated TG based on strats as well as Allocated TG for all the previous patients.In the above example, Allocated TG is present for 3 patients for example.</p>

<p>For the 4th patient,the allocated TG will be calculated like this,</p>

<p>What is the value for Strata1.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If 1,count of how many previous patients are assigned to Allocated TG T1 when 1 count of how many previous patients are assigned to Allocated TG T2 when 1</p></li>
<li><p>If 2,count of how many previous patients are assigned to Allocated TG T1 when 1 count of how many previous patients are assigned to Allocated TG T2 when 1</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, for the Strata2.The count of all the previous patients Allocated TG based on each strata.</p>

<p>After all that, i will get some value for each.Based on the output value, with which strata the allocation number is less, that TG(T1/T2) will be allocated.</p>

<p>After this, it has to calculate for PatID5.Again which has to calculate for the previous 4 patients.</p>

<p>In my Database i have news posts lets say with 3 columns (Id, title, date). Wher Id and title are self Explanitory the date is stored in mktime() values, in other words the number of seconds passed since 1 January 1970.</p>

<p>Now what i want to do is build an archive link that will display as such</p>

<ul>
<li>July 2009</li>
<li>June 2009</li>
<li>March 2009</li>
<li>Feburary 2009</li>
<li>December 2008</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note the months on which there were no posts are not displayed.</em></p>

<p>Now as an initial thought i was thinking</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with the last day of the current Month</li>
<li>And get the Value of the First day of the current Month</li>
<li>Do a MySQL COUNT Query/mysql_num_rows for posts that were date >= First_Day_Seconds AND date &lt;= Last_Day_Seconds</li>
<li>Display or put the values in an Array</li>
<li>Do another Query to Check if Any more values are found WHERE date &lt; First_Day_Seconds (break if no rows were found)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the above is just something on the top of my head. But if you got any ideas to speed this process up please share. </p>

<p>Will say in advance, date needs to be in mktime format</p>

<p>ERROR 1:</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is to create two token rules that allow me to parse all of A1,A2,B1,B2 instead of having to list out all literal permutations.  As the code is, it compiles and recognizes the target tokens.  But if I try to build my parser out of the tok1 and tok2 rules, it does not compile generating an error about type mismatches:</p>

<pre><code>error: invalid static_cast from type âboost::spirit::qi::char_class&lt;boost::spirit::tag::char_code&lt;boost::spirit::tag::space, boost::spirit::char_encoding::ascii&gt; &gt;â to type âcharâ
</code></pre>

<p>I assume this has to do with trying to create strings out of chars.  I've played with any number of permutations of type guessing but have failed.</p>

<p>ERROR 2:</p>

<p>Additionally, I'd like to allow an arbitrary number of tokens to be parsed, unfortunately, prepending with the + operator does not work as expected either.</p>

<p>Any tips?</p>

<p>I tried all kinds of different stuff but can't get it to work propperly. What would like to be able to is drag items from the available area to the timeline und drop them between allready appended ones. So far the helper allways get appended (vertically) above the existing elements and when I drop it the final element get append at the very last position. I hope It's clear what I'm trying to archive...</p>

<p>I have a fiddle right here:</p>

<p>I have a Deck class designed that basically builds and shuffles a deck of cards. The deck generated is composed of an array of 52 Card class objects. That's what I have so far.</p>

<p>My plan is to have a Dealer object, which has a Deck of 52 Cards deal a Card to a second Player object and then deal to the Dealer's own hand.</p>

<p>My first question is: <strong>Is it bad practice to make the array of Card objects public in the Deck class?</strong></p>

<p>I ask this because I consider the array an attribute and was taught that most attributes should be made private. I don't want to start using bad or lazy practices in my projects and want to do it the right way. </p>

<p>Another question: <strong>How are objects, such as the Card object used in my blackjack program, generally moved from within an object -like the dealer- to a second object like a player?</strong> </p>

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>According to the zxJDBC documentation, cursor.tables() is the same as Java's DatabaseMetaData.getTables(). When I call this Java method from Jython, it works as expected, but using the zxJDBC package doesn't work for me. Here's what I have tried:</p>

            ResultSet rs = meta.getTables(null, null, ""%"",
                                          new String[] {""TABLE""});

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

<p>When I call this from Jython, it is all fine.</p>

<pre><code>from com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC
import TableTest

url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost/jythontest'

print 'Java:'
TableTest.tables(url);

print 'Python:'
conn = zxJDBC.connect(url, 'root', None, 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver')
cursor = conn.cursor()
print cursor.tables(None, None, '%', ('TABLE',))
</code></pre>

<p>There are two tables in my test database called 'table_a' and 'table_b'. The output is:</p>

<pre><code>Java:
table_a
table_b
Python:
None
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried this on Linux and on MacOS with the same result. Before I try to figure out what's wrong with zxJDBC, I wanted to know whether there is anything wrong in the way I am using this package.</p>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>I want to enable csrf protection and so have added the security:csrf tag in my spring config. I have a controller class with a method annotated with RequestMapping used for uploading files. I also followed the <a href=""http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.0.CI-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/csrf.html#csrf-multipartfilter"" rel=""nofollow"">caveat instructions</a> around multipart whereby I added the multipart filter above the security filter. When I tried to upload a file after adding the csrf tag I got an exception around a missing getParts() method. A quick google highlighted this was due to using a version of jetty which was based on the servlet 2.5 spec. I upgraded jetty-maven-plugin to 8.1.14.v20131031 and tried uploading again. Resulting in:</p>

<pre><code>org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartException: Could not parse multipart servlet request; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: No multipart config for servlet

        at org.springframework.web.multipart.support.MultipartFilter.doFilterInternal(MultipartFilter.java:110)
</code></pre>

<p>Where do I put the multipart configuration for xml setup? All documentation says to add the multipart-config in the servlet tag for the specific servlet in web.xml. There is only a single servlet for my application though. So I added it to that and still I get the same issue.</p>

<p>When I call the getter function given in <code>Character</code>, What is actually happening? I am failing to see what the problem is here, and previous Q&amp;As that I have found do not solve the problem, they only cause it to break another random function later on.</p>

<p>The best I can call this situation is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug"" rel=""nofollow"">Heisenbug</a>, since this only occurs when I am in DEBUG mode for an unrelated SEGFAULT somewhere else in the program.</p>

<p>The only possible help I have found is using const-correctness with my getters, only to bring the same exact SEGFAULT to the board again (wasting time into compiling).</p>

<p>P.S. My program has static linkage to <a href=""http://www.ogre3d.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ogre3D</a>, which causes me to have an average compiling time of 5 minutes (more than 7 if I change specific headers). So it will take a long time for me to post edits/results.</p>

<p>P.S. <code>Carp::WinBag</code> is the same as <code>Carp::Interface</code> given in the sample code (gave the wrong class name)</p>

<p>Extra Note: I have had this problem occur for 5 days straight on and off. My sanity can only take so much more of this...</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong>: My situation has been caused from my own laziness somewhere else in the code: </p>

<pre><code>ItemPtr temp(new Item(*listItem[1].get()));
temp-&gt;spawnDrop(Coord3(fRAND(-1,1),2,fRAND(-1,1)));
dropList.push_back(temp);
temp.reset(new Item(*listItem[2].get()));
temp-&gt;spawnDrop(Coord3(fRAND(-1,1),2,fRAND(-1,1)));
dropList.push_back(temp);
temp.reset(new Item(*listItem[3].get()));
temp-&gt;spawnDrop(Coord3(fRAND(-1,1),2,fRAND(-1,1)));
dropList.push_back(temp);
</code></pre>

<p>With this, I created a pointer to a new object, BUT at the same time caused the old one to be lost (Memory leak anyone?). This caused all the problems I had later in the code, and writing this the RIGHT way will fix it. </p>

<p>I cannot believe that I did this again after such a long time, and worse NOT realize it... For anyone else that is unfortunate enough to assume this works please <strong>DON'T</strong>. It will cause endless and confusing stress for you :*</p>

I'm using spring mvc and SimpleJdbcInsert to insert the object into a MySQL database.  I'd like to set the blank input to NULL in the database rather than ''.

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p>edit - So I'm an idiot.  Several errors combined on my part led me to believe the correct answers below were not correct.  I'd written a propertyEditorSupport like this:</p>

<pre><code>class StringEditor extends PropertyEditorSupport {  
    public void setAsText(String text) {  
        String value = text.trim();  
        if ("""" == value) {  
            setValue(null);  
        }  
        else {  
            setValue(value);  
        }  
    }  
}  
</code></pre>

<p>Two problems - first, no getAsText, so my form was getting populated with ""null"" strings!  2nd, my equality check is C++, not java.  When I tried the recommended setter, I just reloaded the post, which already contained the ""null"" strings.  Once I cleaned all that up, everything started working.  Thanks for the help, and sorry for my ""operator error""!</p>

<p>For example, lets say that I have a Player entity and a Team entity.  A Team can have any number of players.</p>

<p>Let's say that my business logic (currently) prevents a Team from being deleted until all of the Players have been explicitly removed from the Team first.</p>

<p>If you execute a </p>

<p><code>DELETE http://api.foo.com/teams/15</code> </p>

<p>and it still has Players associated with it, would you return an HTTP 409 (Conflict) or an HTTP 412 (Precondition Failed)?  412 seems more logical because I prefer to use 409 for indicating optimistic locking conditions.</p>

<p>Or perhaps - should that business logic condition even be enforced at all in a REST API?  That is, if someone executes </p>

<p><code>DELETE http://api.foo.com/teams/15</code></p>

<p>shouldn't that just remove all Players and then delete the Team automatically?  Is it more conventional to allow the DELETE to execute as the REST API can be perceived as a little 'lower level' or more 'raw' than UI interfaces?</p>

<p>Finally, what about a query param to in the Resource URI:</p>

<p><code>DELETE http://api.foo.com/teams/15?force=true</code> </p>

<p>which indicates, ""Yes, I know that this wouldn't be allowed with players still on the team, but do it anyway"".</p>

<p>The idea here is that deleting a Team can be a heavyweight operation with significant repercussions and you only want to do it if the end-user is really sure they want to.</p>

<p>In other words, how much hand-holding do you do (employing 'are you sure?' error codes) or do you just execute it without any check?  I'm not quite sure if this should be enforced only in the UI or in the REST API or both.  How do most people solve this today?</p>

<pre><code>grid.on('beforeedit', function(editor, e) {
  if (e.colIdx === 0 &amp;&amp; e.record.get('status') == 4)
  return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>It worked !!! But when I referred back to ExtJS 4.2.0 API ( that's what we are using ), I didn't find the 'beforeedit' event on Ext.grid.Panel or it's parent Ext.panel.Table. The RowEditing plugin had the beforeedit event, but not the Grid. However, the older version 4.1.0 had the event for Ext.panel.Grid ( <a href=""http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.1.0/#!/api/Ext.grid.Panel-event-beforeedit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.1.0/#!/api/Ext.grid.Panel-event-beforeedit</a> ), in fact beforeedit on Ext.panel.Grid was introduced since 4.1.0.</p>

<p>So, it's just the question which is bothering me that - Was the event deprecated so soon and still working? Or the API for 4.2.0 missed it? Or what was the reason that an event not defined in the API of the version am using, is still working !!! This will help me understand how the API is all documented and if I should rely on older versions for better documentation or whatever.</p>

<p>How can I add a new <code>UITabBarItem</code> to the <code>TabBarController</code>, from any of the child controllers, and set an specific action.</p>

<p>Note: Now I revised several questions asked in <code>StackOverflows</code> with almost identical phrasing than this one, however their implementation is not quite as I'm describing here.</p>

<p>Is this allowed in <code>iOS</code>? If not, will you share your thoughts of how you would do it?</p>

<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: after a few days of bumping I tried the following approach, It
  worked, but I don't feel entirely comfortable with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The approach consist of having one of your controller class,</p>

<p>1) Have one of your controller class to inherit the UITabBarControllerDelegate. In my case I implemented this delegate in the class that will be most likely to be instantiated for the first time after the AppDelegate, in other words the Class that belongs to the first view of the app, for example</p>

<pre><code>interface MainTableViewController: UITableViewController &lt;UITabBarControllerDelegate&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>2) Set the delegate of the TabBarController in viewDidLoad</p>

<pre><code>self.tabBarController.delegate = self;
</code></pre>

<p>3) Implement the protocol tabBarController:shouldSelectViewController:, using this method you can control which view will be shown.</p>

<p>In my case, I previously added a few dummy viewcontrollers and I gave to each BarItem a different tag number</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)tabBarController:(UITabBarController *)tabBarController shouldSelectViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController
{
    switch (viewController.tabBarItem.tag) {
        case 3:
        {
            [self someActionA];
            return NO;
        }
        case 4:
        {
            [self someActionB];
            return NO;
        }
        default:
            return YES;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far this code will do the trick of what I really intended in the first place, however I wish I could've done this in the AppDelegate.</p>

<p>In the case someone might come across with the same issue, or if you have a different approach please do share.</p>

After taking the photo and choose use photo, it'll go back to scene A and display the captured image in the UIImageView. However, the image displayed got so big it partially overlaps two buttons beneath it, as if the constraints i set doesn't work at all. Why does this happen?</p></li>
<li><p>In scene B, i have a smaller UIImageView used to display the photo i took earlier. However, only part of the original image is shown in scene B's imageView. I tried to set the contentMode as  UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill and set the autoresizingMask, but still doesn't work. Where does it go wrong?</p></li>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The Problem is solved! After i dragged the UIImageview to the storyboard, i just resize it to fit the screen, but forgot to add height and width constraints to it. Now i add the constraints, the image is displayed as expected. Thank you guys.</p>

<p>I have built search form with 2 states: 
First state triggers the second one (onclick), and sets some state parameters with $state.go() function. 
Second state has resolve function which gets state parameter, and resolves search results.</p>

<p><em>This approach seems much cleaner way to do it</em>, oposing to classic approach: inject the search service in state one, get results, save them in search service, change state and load results from injected service. </p>

<p>Question</p>

<p><strong>How to make unit test for this ?</strong></p>

<p>Initial idea is that I should make a test which ""should trigger a locate with searchTerm and switch to results page"". 
It fails because the states do not resolve properly with jasmine. 
Sometimes it's 'locked' in first state, in other scenarios state is always ''.</p>

<p>When I removed resolve block from configuration it works as expected, and tests pass, so the problem is obviously in resolve block. It's weird that I do not get 'unknown provider' errors though.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or ideas how to fix this? </p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20433485/angular-ui-router-unit-testing-states-to-urls"">Angular ui router unit testing (states to urls)</a>
But there user invokes state change manually, while in my scenario it's invoked by another function.</em></p>

        $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;
        $rootScope = _$rootScope_;

        // mocking the views 
        // (instead of including stateMock script from the post, just to simplify)

<pre><code>ActionResult Start() (HttpGet) which return my view with the searchbox
JsonResult Starts(InpurtParams) which perform the search
</code></pre>

<p>2) In sitecore, i created my Controller Rendering and add the action start to it. </p>

<p>3) i register a new route in RouteConfig.cs (i put it before the sitecore route and after, didn't change anythings) </p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>  routes.MapRoute(
          name: ""search"",
          url: ""api/NewsOverview/{action}/{id}"",
          defaults: new { controller = ""NewsOverview"", action = ""Starts"", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
        );
</code></pre>

<p>4) I put the following code in my view : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
function getSearchResult() {
    var inputparams = {};
    inputparams.SearchTerm = document.getElementById(""searchTerm"").value;

    try {
        $.getJSON(""/api/NewsOverview/starts"", inputparams, displaySearchResult);
    }
    catch (ex) {
        alert(""Error : "" + ex.message);
    }
}

function displaySearchResult(data) {
    $.each(data, function (i, result) {
        $(""#searchresult"").append(result.Name + "" - "" + result.Url + ""&lt;br/&gt;"");
    });

};
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""searchTerm"" id=""searchTerm"" value=""test""/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""button"" onclick=""getSearchResult();""/&gt;
    &lt;div id=""searchresult""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<p>There is no custom getter or setter. So <code>_context</code> ivar should be created.</p>

<p>It seems the ivar exists, but yet when I assign something the ivar remains nil.</p>

<pre><code>self.context = [[EAGLContext alloc] initWithAPI:kEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES1];

// breakpoint:
// ""po [self context]"" returns proper object.
// ""po _context"" returns nil
</code></pre>

<p>How can this be possible?</p>

<p>To exclude collisions I refactored the property to ""context123"" but the same result. LLDB debugger will say that _context123 is nil.</p>

<p>My answer to this question will follow immediately. It is an interesting problem which others may find useful to know.</p>

<p><strong>GCD Game</strong></p>

<p>Life and death, win or lose - both have two sides to each other. And that's what Arjit and Chandu Don are fighting about. They are tired of gang-wars between each other, and thus decide to settle like men in a field, of Mathematics.<br>
But even while going to play the game of Mathematics, they have not given up on their tactics of hurting each other. So, Arjit carries a number of rubber bullets with himself, and Chandu Don carries b number of rubber bullets. Since, Little Chandu is a more dangerous gangster of the two, he decides to give the first chance to Arjit.<br>
The way they’re going to decide who wins the entire land of HEpur is by playing the age-old game of GCD-DCG. The first one to end up with only 1 bullet is going to lose.
This is how the game progresses:</p>

<pre><code>1. If GCD (a, b) is greater than 1, then, the player can: 
    a.) Subtract 1 from opposite player’s bullets. **OR** 
    b.) Divide the number of bullets of opposite player by GCD (a, b). 
2. If GCD (a, b) is equal to 1, then, the player can: 
    a.) Subtract 1 from the opposite player’s bullets.

Note : Player can choose only one move out of two if GCD(A,B) &gt; 1 .

The one who ends up with only one bullet loses the battle, 
and his life, and the land of HEpur.
</code></pre>

<p>Determine who is going to rule, once and for all!</p>

<p>Input:<br>
First line contains number of test cases T, next T lines contains two numbers A and B taken by Arjit and Chandu Don respectively.</p>

<p>Output:<br>
Print the name of winner of the game in case of draw print Draw.

<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000

<p>I have two questions here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is recursion the best data structure that can be employed here?. Or is this calling for another data structure or algorithm class.</li>
<li>There is a concept called pruning right..where few paths are cut off after deciding that they are not going to yield good results. Can someone please help me how to prune the above code [ better, than short-circuiting ].</li>
<li>What could be wrong with this code?. 1 of 3 tests is passing. The other two are failing.</li>
</ul>

<p>thanks,
Pavan.</p>

I know that index is used to speed up searching, but is the difference between this situations ? => let's bring some example. first => mysql query <code>""SELECT name FROM BIO WHERE LIMIT 0,100""</code> and second => (let's consider that dx is index of name column) mysql query <code>SELECT dx FROM BIO LIMIT 0,100</code>
I think that in that situations there is no difference and want to hear from you guys your opinions :)
Correctly I should written in second example like so yes <code>""SELECT name FROM BIO LIMIT 0,100""</code> ? 
I've made some changing in examples to express data searching speed
I don't know indexes well and because of it I'm asking ...

<p>I have a large number of blobs (already stored in Azure) that are html files.  I have written some code that can take an html string and convert it to a TableEntity.  I would then like to save the TableEntity to the table ""mydatatable"".  It appears I can use a <code>[Table]</code> attribute to simplify the process of saving my entity to a table, or save it manually to the table in the method call.  My problem is just getting the method signature right, and then how to get blobs feeding into that method. I'm somewhat confused by all the attributes like <code>[Blob]</code>, <code>[BlobTrigger]</code>, and types like <code>ICollector&lt;T&gt;</code> and the proper way (and when) to use them.  If anyone knows of a tutorial that explains a similar situation to this one I would love to know about it.</p>

For this I get a spot or on-demand instance and mark it with a tag as <code>non_idle</code>. When the job is done (which may take hours), I give it the tag <code>idle</code>. Due to the hourly billing model of AWS, I want to keep that instance alive until another billable hour is incurred in case another job comes in. If a job comes in, the instance should be reused and marked it as <code>non_idle</code>. If no job comes in during that time, the instance should terminate.</p>

<p>Does AWS offer a ready solution for this? As far as I know, CloudWatch can't set alarms that should run at a specific time, never mind using the CPUUtilization or the instance's tags. Otherwise, perhaps I could simply set up for every created instance a java timer or scala actor that runs every hour after the instance is created and check for the tag <code>idle</code>.</p>

<p>This seems to work, but when I put it into my integrated code, I experienced multiple problems with error messages like ""[that function] has no method 'addEventListener'"".</p>

<p>The gist of my question is this: Is there something fundamentally wrong with the way I've extended <code>Math</code> here? Should that function have such a method, and if not, why is jwplayer asking for it?</p>

<p>I've attached much more detail below, but if you're already bored and want to start postulating answers, you can skip the rest.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I went to test the integrated code I saw this error:</p>

<p>Here's a snippet from script.js that the above refers to:</p>

<pre><code>// Setup the video player:
$(""video"").each(function (i, e) {
    // Switching out ids like this is a horrible hack,
    // but apparently it's the only way jwplayer will load.
    var oldId = $(e).attr('id');
    $(e).attr(""id"", ""tmpVideoSetup"");
    jwplayer(""tmpVideoSetup"").setup({
        flashplayer: window.CDN + ""/js/libs/mediaplayer-5.7-licensed/player.swf"",

<p>The <a href=""http://pandas.pydata.org"">pandas</a> python package has a DataFrame data type for holding table data in python. It also has a convenient interface to the <a href=""http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/"">hdf5</a> file format, so pandas DataFrames (and other data) can be saved using a simple dict-like interface (assuming you have <a href=""http://pytables.org"">pytables</a> installed)</p>

<p>Which brings me to my question: ideally I would be able to save back and forth from R to pandas. I can obviously write a wrapper from pandas to R (I think... though I think if I use a pandas <a href=""http://pandas.sourceforge.net/indexing.html"">MultiIndex</a> that might become trickier), but I don't think I can easily then use that data back in pandas. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Bonus: what I <em>really</em> want to do is use the <a href=""http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/"">data.table</a> package in R with a pandas dataframe (the keying approach is suspiciously similar in both packages). Any help on that one greatly appreciated.</p>

Thinking this was just a random occurence, I tried other webscripts. enable-site.get.js (from Martin Bergljung's blog) used to work, and now doesn't. create-site.post.js gives me an error with not being able to assign fields in the model to the view; all fairly consistent with view issues. In fact all the get share tier scripts also give the ""Cannot locate template processor for template...""</p>

<p>I'm not aware that I've changed anything; however I don't understand why certain webscripts that came with alfresco (create-site.post for example) don't work out of the box. My guess is that I've done something incorrect with setting up my alfresco server; however I've no idea what that would be. If anyone has had similar symptoms then it would be great to hear a resolution.</p>

<p>I am loading a 50X231 matrix that has in the first row the time samples (so in reality is 49X231), with 231 sample times. I am trying to read one column of the matrix at a time after an external trigger and use it for a matrix multiplication.

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>I only need to use the matrix for a period of time given by the external event. This is a fixed matrix for all the simulink session.</p>

<p>The expected behaviour for iOS devices would be the same for desktop web browser but actually pressing on ""cerca (search)"" button only triggers an highlighting for the inserted string itself, which is ok for the first click on the button, but keep on clicking should highlight further search results.</p>

<p>The service call is coming back with a valid Json string, but in deserialising, the value at the end is always 0 or string.Empty despite the value being passed in being non-0 or non string.Empty.</p>

        value = code ? deserialized.Response : deserialized.ResponseCode.ToString();

<p>What I need is to force it to behave like a menu for example from this site: <a href=""http://wachtel.de/backoefen/etagenoefen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wachtel.de/backoefen/etagenoefen.html</a> - I mean display every nested level in a separate box under it's parent.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble achieving it in pure CSS, so before I loose my mind, I'd like to ask you: Can it even be done, or do I need to use JS?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>So far I've tried to make the prime UL relative and sub-ULs absolute with ""left: 0"" and ""width: 100%"", but it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong></p>

<p>Problem was caused by bootstrap.css property .nav > li {position: relative}, which was ruining the layout.</p>

<p>but this code does not really clicking on the ""New"" link, so the next form won't show up, and the rest of the code cannot run. Does anyone know any solution to this problem?</p>

<p>I know a little bit of Java and SQL, but having only made a few small applications and a few queries, starting a project of this magnitude from scratch is daunting.</p>

<p>I'd prefer a RAD tool that can develop a front-end for the users. Our current CRM application, Sage ACT! 2009, has a layout editor that feels just like Visual Basic's designer. It also handles all the back-end SQL stuff. This is basically what I want, but needs the ability to connect to a remote database.</p>

<p>Google Apps integration would rock, but I know nothing about web applications or GAE. We have Google Apps for Business.</p>

<p>In short, I want either customizable front-end database client software (focused on users, not on database administration), or a RAD tool that is somewhat CRM-oriented and works with SQL out of the box.</p>

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p class=""toggler""&gt;Toggle here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=""toggled""&gt;Imagine I would like to have the &lt;span id=""link"" style=""color:red""&gt;link-destination &lt;i&gt;(id=""link"")&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; inside this Toggled content (the difficulty is successfully arriving here when the Toggler is closed).&lt;/div&gt;

</div>
</p>

<p>So, the problem arises only when the Toggler is closed/hidden, then the link can not arrive anywhere.</p>

<p>What would be needed for this is an automatic opener for the Toggler I guess, so some way of checking whether the link occurs inside the Toggler first. Or is there perhaps a much easier way around this?</p>

<p>Would someone give me any help on how to go about this?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> In my specific case, and as a general utility; it might be handy to be able to work with multiple such hyperlinks and/or multiple such Togglers.</p>

<p>What would be the best (to save manual work when having tons of links and toggles, especially in a <em>working</em> document), is to automatically look up the link-destination and his parent Toggler, and then automatically open that <code>toggled</code>, as with <code>.fadeIn(""fast"");</code>.</p>

<p>So I found the comment in the pom:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- for bootstrapping the parent and target-platform poms via Mead, we need to be able to fetch from this folder and run
    this profile (excluding all others); currently parent pom includes target-platform build too, so only need to build the parent

    -P \!maven,\!ws,\!gwt,\!deltacloud,\!runtime,\!usage,\!central,\!aggregate-coverage
--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and tried that mvn-command, but then it complaints:</p>

<pre><code>  Child module .\parent\..\target-platform of .\parent\pom.xml does not exist
</code></pre>

<p>I never used Mead, and dont understand that stuff about boot-strapping and target-platform...</p>

<p>Anyways, what is the proper way to make this build work?</p>

My app's listview (which is inside a tab widget) contains various types of rows. I have had many problems setting this up and here is another 1. Please see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9467421/edittext-settext-changes-my-softkeyboard-input-type-in-a-custom-adapter"">here</a> for the code, which basically remains the same.
I use another activity (a custom implemented ES file explorer) which is a filebrowser dialog to open a file. The data from the file is sent to the listview.
When it shows the list and I click on the spinner the screen darkens and freezes. If I press the back button the darkening disappears, the listview becomes clickable but the spinner still is not. The only way out is if I flip to another tab widget and back again (there are 2 separate ones) the spinner will work again.</p>

<p>I should say that the spinner works just fine if I do not load files from the other activity. 
So I guess in other words there is a problem of focus or something when switching and killing activities.</p>

<p>I hope you can help. </p>

<p>EDIT
after some more trying, sometimes after loading the file from the browser it will return to a black screen where the listview is there but not visible.
eg you can click on it and the editor opens.</p>

<p>My MVC3 app will be running in one place (houston) and its mission will be to allow our employees, all over the world (30 domain controllers) to download various software packages via our Intranet. Today, each of these 30 sites has a replicated ""Programs"" folder mapped to a shared drive. So, someone in China isn't dowloading an app to install from here in Houston. They'll get if off their logonserver in China. I am able to interrogate the ""logonserver"" environment variable to determine the server they are on...but short of dynamically building a hyperlink with the UNC embedded (this works by the way)...I can't really use any of the streaming methods specific to MVC because it will end up getting pulled into the box where my web app is running (houston) to be streamed back across some pond. Is my thinking right on this? I prefer to stream because this way I can lock down that Programs folder and only grant the ASP Process the authority to access the replicated folder.</p>

<p>I am using <code>AVCaptureSession</code> with audio and video <code>AVCaptureOutputs</code>, and then using <code>AVAssetWriter</code>/<code>AVAssetWriterInput</code> to capture video and audio in the <code>captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection</code> method and write the resulting video to a file.</p>

<p>To make this a stream, I am using an <code>NSTimer</code> to break the video files into 1 second chunks (by hot-swapping in a different <code>AVAssetWriter</code> that has a different <code>outputURL</code>) and upload these to a server over HTTP.</p>

<p>This is working, but the issue I'm running into is this: the beginning of the <code>.mp4</code> files appear to always be missing audio in the first frame, so when the video files are concatenated on the server (running <code>ffmpeg</code>) there is a noticeable audio skip at the intersections of these files. The video is just fine - no skipping.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/97rM4.png"" alt=""Blank audio""></p>

<p>I tried many ways of making sure there were no <code>CMSampleBuffers</code> dropped and checked their timestamps to make sure they were going to the right <code>AVAssetWriter</code>, but to no avail.</p>

<p>Checking the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/AVCam/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010112"" rel=""nofollow"">AVCam example</a> with <code>AVCaptureMovieFileOutput</code> and AVCaptureLocation example with <code>AVAssetWriter</code> and it appears the files they generate do the same thing.</p>

<p>Maybe there is something fundamental I am misunderstanding here about the nature of audio/video files, as I'm new to video/audio capture - but thought I'd check before I tried to workaround this by learning to use <code>ffmpeg</code> as some seem to do to fragment the stream (if you have any tips on this, too, let me know!). Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>When usually writing to the disk, it starts in the fast portion of the platter and then writes towards the slower parts.

<p>Here is my problem: I have a particle simulation in 3D, so each particle has 3 coordinates (x, y, z). The whole domain is split into subcells. At one point I calculate the ID of the subcell in which  the particle is at a timestep. This is a simple formula:</p>

<p>Now the issue is, the client can of course fake step number 3 by submitting a wrong userID to my server - for example if my server responds to the request <a href=""http://server.com/getConfidentialData.php?fbID=%FBID%"" rel=""nofollow"">http://server.com/getConfidentialData.php?fbID=%FBID%</a> , and the user manages to get the fb-userID of someone else, he could just put that into the request and he'd get the data that belongs to someone else.</p>

<p>If I use the PHP-SDK, how can it know whether my user is logged in in the Android-App or not?</p>

<p>Is that the way it's supposed to work, or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Thanks, 
David.</p>

<p>All is fine except for the fact that the <code>spec_queue::pop()</code> method is non blocking. It returns True or False even if there is nothing in the queue. However my queue always seems to return True (problem #1). I think this is because i preallocate the queue.</p>

<pre><code>typedef boost::lockfree::spsc_queue&lt;q_pl, boost::lockfree::capacity&lt;100000&gt; &gt; spsc_queue;
</code></pre>

<p>This means that to use the queue efficiently i have to busy wait constantly popping the queue using 100% cpu. Id rather not sleep for arbitrary amounts of time. I've used other queues in java which block until an object is made available. Can this be done with std:: or boost:: data structures?</p>

<p>First of all I had to define manually web project facelet and add libraries to its deployment definition.</p>

<p>The other problem was persistence.xml file. In the Seam generated project it does not exists, since Ant is using one of the persistence-dev.xml, persistence-prod.xml, persistence-test.xml files, changing its name, depending on deployment type (which is ok). Obviously I can create persistence.xml by hand, but it goes againts Seam way of development. </p>

<p>Finally I decided to use directly ant, which is not partucularly comfortable.</p>

<p>In this game, planet gravity plays a huge role, and so the player's ship is affected by various planets. In this game, there are multiple planets which move (orbit).</p>

<p>My main issue at the moment is handing collision response. When the player hits a planet, i want the player to have a small ""bounce"".
I used this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymgbDdO8hKI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymgbDdO8hKI</a> as a source to program this, and it works great for planets which don't move.</p>

<p>However, when the planet does move, the algorithm works great when the planet is moving away from the player, but if the player is in the planet's path (i.e., the planet is moving towards the player), the planet sort'v ""eats"" the player.</p>

<p>I know I need to compensate somehow for the planet's velocity. I've tried different variations, such as add the planet's vector to the overall resulting vector of the bounce, but nothing seems to give a good result... the planet always seems to eat up the player when the planet moves towards the player.</p>

<p>If you guys would like me to post code samples, let me know, although I'm looking for more of a ""concept"" solution, like the video linked above provides.</p>

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=""tab-2""&gt;

        $('#desc div:first').show();
        $('#desc td:first').addClass('active');

"16567539","1","16737628","","2013-05-15 14:17:19","","1","1635","<p>So I have this nice PhoneGap application (cordova 2.7.0, along with jquery mobile 1.2.0) that works great on my Android phone. The www folder also works flawlessly using Firefox, Chrome (through wamp), IE 10, and it's ugly-but-useable on IE7.</p>

<p>Now, I've been stuck on some sad behavior when trying to get this app to work on my Windows Phone. (7.5) Here's the thing:</p>

<p>My index.html prompts the user for his credentials to log in to an external web server. This html file contains all the references to the javascript and css files used by my application. The different pages are then loaded through a content div using ajax, which is pre-filled with the log in form.</p>

<p><strong>My index.html body:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!-- Begin Page Connect --&gt;
    &lt;div data-role=""page"" id=""index""&gt;
        &lt;div data-role=""header"" data-position=""fixed""&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Connect to Server&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div data-role=""content"" &gt;
        &lt;div data-role=""collapsible"" data-collapsed=""false"" data-iconpos=""none"" data-theme=""b"" data-content-theme=""b"" id=""col1""&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;form id=""formConnect"" &gt;
                    &lt;label for=""server_url"" class=""ui-hidden-accessible""&gt;Url Server:&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""server_url"" id=""server_url"" class=""required defaultInvalid url"" value="""" placeholder=""http://"" data-theme=""a"" /&gt;

                    &lt;label for=""username"" class=""ui-hidden-accessible""&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""username"" id=""username"" class=""required"" value="""" placeholder=""username"" data-theme=""a"" /&gt;

                    &lt;label for=""password"" class=""ui-hidden-accessible""&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input type=""password"" name=""pass"" id=""password"" class=""required"" value="""" placeholder=""password"" data-theme=""a"" /&gt;

                    &lt;button id=""cb"" disabled type=""submit"" data-theme=""b""&gt;Connect&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div data-role=""footer"" data-position=""fixed""&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;!-- End Page Connect --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I click on connect, the client-server authentication process takes place:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url:server_url,
    type: 'GET',
    data: {page: ""login"", username: user, password: passhash},
    success: function(data) {
        console.log(""LOGIN: SUCCESS"");
        $.mobile.changePage(""home.html"", {transition: ""slide""});
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The authentication ends succesfully (the console log outputs ""LOGIN: SUCCESS""), and then this piece of javascript takes place:</p>

<pre><code>$.mobile.changePage(""home.html"", {transition: ""slide""});
</code></pre>

<p>And that's where I get the undebuggable ""Error Loading Page"" error, and the home page does not load.</p>

<p>I have read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/8237595/1439597"">this question</a> and its answer but all of my files in www (including images) are already set as ""Content"" in their build action.</p>

<p>Also, after reading <a href=""http://forum.jquery.com/topic/phonegap-wp7-breaks-jqm-ajax-page-loading"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> I thought of trying using an anchor right on my index.html page (just after the form):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""home.html""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When clicked, the same ""Error Loading Page"" poped up. But when I added the data-ajax=""false"":</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""home.html"" data-ajax=""false""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the home.html file <strong>would load</strong> indeed, but would not work at all obviously, since it didn't contain any js or css reference, etc.</p>

<p>Also, I tried all of that <strong>both on emulator AND actual Windows Phone (HTC HD7)</strong></p>

<p>Would anyone have any info on how to at least DEBUG this mean error message? ""Error Loading Page"" does not speak to me at all.</p>

<p>Right now I'm trying to add the Zoom feature to my custom browser. I have the keyboard combos working for it (CTRL + and CTRL - make the correct OLE calls to the underlying ActiveX WebBrowser object), but among the other frustrating things about <code>WebBrowser</code> I've had to deal with, I can't seem to figure out how to capture CTRL-Mouse wheel to simulate the Zoom function like IE does. I've looked everywhere to find a solution to this but to no avail.</p>

<p>To try to figure it out, I created an empty form with just the WebBrowser control in it, and found the following:</p>

<p><oL>
<li> CTRL-MouseWheel always fires the <code>MouseWheel</code> event when the parent form has focus and the mouse cursor is hovering over the top of the window (e.g. over the title of the application), or when the mouse cursor is hovering over the <code>WebBrowser</code> control when it does not appear to have focus even though the parent form has focus.</li>
<li> CTRL-MouseWheel never fires the <code>MouseWheel</code> event when the mouse cursor is hovering over the <code>WebBrowser</code> control and <code>WebBrowser</code> has focus, and there seems to be no effect.</li>
<li> Using the mouse wheel without CTRL scrolls the window contents of <code>WebBrowser</code> but does not fire the <code>MouseWheel</code> event until the vertical scroll bar has fully reached either the top or the bottom.
<li> Intercepting the <code>Message</code> for <code>WM_MOUSEWHEEL</code> by overriding <code>WndProc</code> and <code>DefWndProc</code> both for a sample class inherited from <code>WebBrowser</code> and for the parent form applies only for the above conditions (with <code>wParam</code> properly denoting <code>MK_CONTROL</code>).</li>
<li> The <code>PreviewKeyDown</code> event fires when CTRL is pressed, as expected, but still does nothing in unison with the mouse wheel.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>So I guess the <code>Message</code> is being processed below the parent form and the managed control level and does not bubble up to where I can intercept or even handle it. Is there a way to do this, or some other way to simulate zooming in and out using CTRL-MouseWheel?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p><a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/joewrobel/archive/2008/02/03/web-profile-builder-for-web-application-projects.aspx"">http://weblogs.asp.net/joewrobel/archive/2008/02/03/web-profile-builder-for-web-application-projects.aspx</a></p>

<p>It seems a bit long winded and I was hoping someone might know of a better solution.</p>

<p>I am trying to use the ProfileCommon with the CreateUser Wizard as I add a little extra information into it.</p>

<pre><code>protected void CreateUserWizard1_CreatedUser(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Create an empty Profile for the newly created user
    ProfileCommon p = (ProfileCommon)ProfileCommon.Create(CreateUserWizard1.UserName, true);

    // Populate some Profile properties off of the create user wizard
    p.CurrentLevel = Int32.Parse(((DropDownList)CreateUserWizard1.CreateUserStep.ContentTemplateContainer.FindControl(""clevel"")).SelectedValue);

    // Save profile - must be done since we explicitly created it
    p.Save();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Web.config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;profile enabled=""true""&gt;
&lt;properties&gt;
	&lt;add name=""CurrentLevel"" type=""Int32""/&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
&lt;/profile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If there is another way to add this extra information into the creation wizard, or just a better way of setting extra info to a new user then I am all ears and would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help and advice.</p>

<p>I can do this with a nested for loop, but it feels REALLY inefficient:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- c(1:nrows(DF1))
y &lt;- c(1:4)
for (i in x) {
    for (j in y) {

    }
}

<p>Is there a way to do this more efficiently??!?! I know there is. I'm a noob.</p>

<p>This doesn't work as expected. For debugging I replaced the line above with:</p>

<pre><code>x = new subcounter(2,'x',y.show);

<p>And found that 'x triggered' is shown instead of 'y triggered', which I would expect. What's going on here? (Tried in Firefox).</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for your answers or pointing me to documentation on <code>this</code>. However, my brain still fails to understand how a function scoped to one object instance: 'y.show' can ever resolve to that function on a different object instance.</p>

<p>The answer seems to be:</p>

<pre><code>x = new subcounter(2,'x',function() {y.tick();});

<p>But I'd still like to really understand why the original doesn't work as expected.</p>

<p>After checking the exception it seems the claim() function of Serverinfo class  has the problem.
Or the URL has any issue ?
Can some help me to overcome this issue or any useful link?</p>

<p>In Java, I can create a class with static variables of the same class type, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Status {

    public static final Status SUCCESS = new Status(0, ""Success"");
    public static final Status FAILURE = new Status(-1, ""It's Broke"");

    private int number;
    private String message;

    private Status(int number, String message) {
        this.number = number;
        this.message = message;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then I can use the static variables in Status like this:</p>

<pre><code>public Status foo() {
    ...
    return Status.FAILURE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Could someone tell me how I would do something similar in Objective-C?</p>

<p>At first the basic example from mahout website returned an error due to spaces in affinity.txt example file. After deleting spaces I got rid of the latter but got stuck on exception described above. As the basic example already returned an error due to example data format I am wondering whether it is possible that the exception is caused by release bug (I am using version 0.9).</p>

<p>I am going to try to run older versions to check whether they throw the same exception but nevertheles it would be very helpful if anyone of you could tell whether you managed to run spectral k-means successfully using release 0.9 or older.</p>

<p>I tried to run the example on EMR using Custom JAR with following settings:</p>

<p>JAR location: </p>

<pre><code>s3://my_bucket/mahout-core-0.9-job.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Arguments: </p>

<pre><code>org.apache.mahout.clustering.spectral.kmeans.SpectralKMeansDriver --input s3://my_bucket/testdata/affinity.txt --output s3://my_bucket/testdata/results -d 3 -k 2 -x 10
</code></pre>

<p>I would really appreciate your help in solving this issue.</p>

<h1>EDIT 1:</h1>

<p>I tried to run the example with version 0.8 and got the same exception so the problem I guess is not in the mahout distribution but in EMR configuration.</p>

<p>I looked into the kernel code and it looks like the Linux kernel sets the hardware page tables for the kernel address space (everything over 0xC0000000)on TTB1 (translation table base) and the user process on ttb0 (everything under 0xC0000000) which changes for every process context switch. Is this correct? I'm still confused how the MMU knows which ttb to look at for translations? </p>

<p>I read that the TTBCR (translation table base control register) determines which of the ttb register to walk when an MVA is not found, however the register always reads 0 which means always use TTBR0 in the ARM architecture reference manual. How is that possible? Can anyone explain to me how the Linux kernel uses these two ttbs?</p>

<p>I read how the ttb works from this site <a href=""http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/416/notes/09a-paging.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/416/notes/09a-paging.html</a> but I still dont understand how the kernel use the two ttbs</p>

<p>(Double checked the kernel code, for some reason both ttb0 and ttb1 is set, but it seems like ttb1 is never used, i set the TTB1 register to 0 and the Linux kernel continue to run as usual)</p>

So that you understand the context of this question, I will cover what goes on before loading content on both views:</p>

<ol>
<li>I get back an image from -imageWithData and store it in a dictionary </li>
<li><p>This dictionary is then accessed by the TableViewController class as well as the CollectionViewController class and implemented as such:</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView     cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
 // Configure the cell...
UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@""User ID"" forIndexPath:indexPath];

//setting UI
NSString *milesFrom = self.streamItems[indexPath.row][@""MilesAway""];
cell.textLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@, Distance Away: %@"", self.streamItems[indexPath.row][@""UserName""], milesFrom];
UIImage *photo = [[UIImage alloc]init];
photo = self.streamItems[indexPath.row][@""ThumbnailPhoto""];
cell.imageView.image = photo;

return cell;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This part works just as I need it to, but the collection view does not:</p>

<pre><code>- (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

    static NSString *identifier = @""MyCell"";
    CellViewController *cell = [collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:identifier forIndexPath:indexPath];

       UIImage *imageReturned = [[UIImage alloc]initWithCIImage: self.streamItems[indexPath.row][@""ThumbnailPhoto""]];
    cell.imageOfCell.image = imageReturned;
    [cell.imageOfCell sizeToFit];

return cell;

}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>This CellViewController Class has the IBOutlet 'imageOfCell' property. This property references an Image View object that I dragged on top of the cell (""MyCell"") that is  inside of my collection view. The collection view, as I said, gives me a blank view with no content. In debugging, I saw that both the 'photo' instance and 'ImageReturned' instance had the same exact values. For this reason, I have no idea why the collection view does not load the images but the table view does. In case it has anything to do with the way I load the collection view, I have included my -viewDidLoad method definition:</p>

<pre><code>    @implementation StreamCollectionViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        self.collectionView.delegate = self;
        self.collectionView.dataSource = self;
        [self.collectionView registerClass: [CellViewController class]forCellWithReuseIdentifier:@""MyCell""];
        UICollectionViewFlowLayout *flow = [[UICollectionViewFlowLayout alloc]init];
        [flow setScrollDirection:UICollectionViewScrollDirectionVertical];
        [self.collectionView setCollectionViewLayout:flow];

        //create object to deal with network requests
      StreamController *networkRequester = [[StreamController alloc]init];
        [networkRequester getFeedWithCompletion:^(NSMutableArray *items, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        self.streamItems = items;
        [self.collectionView reloadData];
    }

    else{
        NSLog(@""Error getting streamItems: %@"", error);
    }
    }];

// Uncomment the following line to preserve selection between presentations
// self.clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear = NO;

// Register cell classes
       // [self.collectionView registerClass:[UICollectionViewCell class] forCellWithReuseIdentifier:reuseIdentifier];

        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
}

<p>I am fairly new to using the collection view so I wouldn't be surprised if it's something relatively small that I am missing. Thanks in advance!</p>

<pre><code>{
 _id : ""foo"",
 _rev : ""bar"",
 type : ""User"",
 settings : {""foo"" : ""bar"", ""far"" : ""boo""},
 email : ""foo@bar.com""
 some : ""foo"",
 other : ""bar"",
 stuff : ""fooBar""
 data : {""LOTS OF DATA!!!""}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm assuming a view over a doc that includes that data field and the ""lots of data"" it actually holds (imagine it full of 500+ lines of text) is going to cause indexes to become massive if you have lots of users and multiple views of that data?</p>

<p>So one solution (assuming my above assumption is correct) is to create a view over everything, except the ""data"", field that you can that use lists against, etc. And when you actually want the data field go and get the actual document based on the _id in the view. The problem with this is it means users will need to make 2 GETs.</p>

<p>the other solution I came up with was to have the view refer to the document _id it was a view of, then create a list over that view. If the <strong>include_docs=true</strong> flag is set on the query string then the list copy/pastes the data field out of the included copy of the original document into the view data and returns the augmented view.</p>

<p>That may be the way things are supposed to be done but it did feel like a ""hack"" and I wanted to run it past some more knowledgeable folks before actually doing it.</p>

<p>My goal here was to return a view of a document (removing and ""Couchy"" stuff like ""_rev"", REST-ifying links to other, related, documents, etc) from a single request by any field (except ""data"") that I have as a key in some view. Allowing users to select a user document (or any other document) based on any field value; this would then use virtual hosts and url re-writing to ""hide away"" the fact it has got a long, ugly url that references design docs, views, lists and has a very ""couchy"" flag tagged on the end. e.g:</p>

<pre><code>whatever.com/users/email?value=""foo@bar.com""
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>whatever.com/users/other?value=""bar""
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously if what I was told about including large data fields in a view is just not true then this is all redundant. </p>

<p>example of the view: </p>

<pre><code>function(doc) { 
        if(doc.type == 'User')
            emit(doc.email, {
                _id : doc._id,  
                'settings': doc.settings,
                'some' : doc.some,
                'other' : doc.other,
                'stuff' : doc.stuff
            });
}
</code></pre>

<p>example of the list:</p>

<pre><code>function(head, req){ 
            var row = getRow();

            start({'headers': {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}});

            send('{ rows :[');
            while (row) { 
                if(req.query.include_docs)
                    row.value.data = row.doc.data;                      

                send(JSON.stringify(row.value));

                row = getRow()

                if(row)
                    send(',');
            }
            send(']}');

<p>DesignView gives the error:

<p>If I put backgroundBrush directly into app.xaml like so:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;Application.Resources&gt;
      &lt;ResourceDictionary&gt;

      &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;
    &lt;/Application.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>DesignView has no problems.</p>

<p>So is there a way to tell DesignView where to find backgroundBrush, if this brush is placed into a seperate resource dictionary?</p>

<p>I have managed (with some outside help) to embed a shockwave flash object into my page - specifically <a href=""http://www.element-it.com/MultiPowUpload.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MultiPowUpload 2.1</a>.  It's appearing nicely on the page and seems to be functioning correctly; we can take that part as read.</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to do some more advanced stuff in JavaScript - I have a button, and in the <code>onClick()</code> code I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>var swf = document.getElementById(""FlashFilesUpload1"");
var itemsCount = swf.filesCount;
alert(""items: ""+itemsCount);
</code></pre>

<p>But the alert statement tells me ""items: undefined"".  It does the same if I set <code>itemsCount</code> to <code>swf.nonExistentProperty</code> - everything is ""undefined"".  But from what I read in the <a href=""http://www.element-it.com/OnlineHelpMulti/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>, there definitely is a <code>filesCount</code> property.  I tried accessing all the other properties and methods of this swf object, and none of them work, except for <code>toString()</code>, which returns ""HTMLObjectElement"".</p>

<p>I am obviously addressing this object incorrectly - but what am I doing wrong?</p>

<h2>Clarification</h2>

<p>In response to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/838621/addressing-properties-of-a-shockwave-flash-object-multipowupload-in-javascript/838754#838754"">@brianpeiris</a>: I am doing this quite differently from the page at the <a href=""http://www.element-it.com/Examples/MultiPowUpload/AdvancedHTMLinterface.html"" rel=""nofollow"">link you suggested</a>.  I didn't do this with any great knowledge, I'm just really acting like a monkey, trying to copy other people's code that works, then tweak it so it does what I want... so don't assume I know anything, however obvious - remember, I've only been doing JavaScript for about a day now!</p>

<p>So here's the code for the control itself:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As you see it's embedded in the HTML as an <code>object</code>, unlike the reference you gave, where they do some other trick using script to get it onto the page.</p>

<p>BTW, when I tried it their way (not very hard, I grant you), I didn't manage to get the control even to appear on my page!</p>

<p>Thanks for your help... much appreciated</p>

Normally, I would just use a custom style and apply it to the controls I want, but I wrote in some dependency properties as well so I decided to write my own user control. </p>

<p>Something that I can't get my head around is how to set the Content property without overwriting the styling of the button control. I thought it might have been my code, but I started brand new with another button and I have the same thing happen - when the Content property is set, the button simply turns white and has black text in the upper left corner.</p>

<p>Here is the XAML code that Blend generated for me:</p>

"25169236","1","","","2014-08-06 20:06:48","","3","808","<p>First, a bit of background:</p>

<p>I am using spherical harmonics as an example of a function on the surface of a sphere like the front spheres in this image:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gJLxn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I produced one of these spheres, coloured according to the value of the harmonic function at  points on its surface. I do this first for a very large number of points, so my function is very accurate. I've called this my <code>fine</code> sphere. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fUWbU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now that I have my <code>fine</code> sphere, I take a relatively small number of points on the sphere. These are the points I wish to interpolate from, the training data, and I call them <code>interp</code> points. Here are my <code>interp</code> points, coloured to their values, plotted on my <code>fine</code> sphere.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pMHh5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, the goal of the project is to use these <code>interp</code> points to train a <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.13.0/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.Rbf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SciPy Radial Basis Function</a> to interpolate my function on the sphere. I was able to do this using:</p>

<pre><code># Train the interpolation using interp coordinates
rbf = Rbf(interp.phi, interp.theta, harmonic13_coarse)
# The result of the interpolation on fine coordinates
interp_values = rbf(fine.phi, fine.theta)
</code></pre>

<p>Which produced this interpolation, plotted on the sphere:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y92SV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Hopefully, through this last image, you can see my problem. Notice the line running through the interpolation? This is because the interpolation data has a boundary. The boundary is because I trained the radial basis function using spherical coordinates (boundaries at [0,pi] and [0,2pi]).</p>

<pre><code>rbf = Rbf(interp.phi, interp.theta, harmonic13_coarse)
</code></pre>

<p>My goal, and why I'm posting this problem, is to interpolate my function on the surface of the sphere using the x,y,z Cartesian coordinates of the data on the sphere. This way, since spheres don't have boundaries, I won't have this boundary error like I do in spherical coordinates. However, I just can't figure out how to do this.</p>

<p>I've tried simply giving the Rbf function the x,y,z coordinates and the value of the function. </p>

<pre><code>rbf=Rbf(interp.x, interp.y, interp.z, harmonic13_coarse)
interp_values=rbf(fine.x,fine.y,fine.z)
</code></pre>

<p>But NumPy throws me a Singular Matrix Error</p>

<pre><code>numpy.linalg.linalg.LinAlgError: singular matrix
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way for me to give Rbf my data sites in Cartesian coordinates, with the function values at each site and have it behave like it does with spherical coordinates but without that boundaries? From the Rbf documentation, there is the attribute <code>norm</code> for defining a different distance norm, could I have to use a spherical distance to get this to work?</p>

<p>I'm pretty much stumped on this. Let me know if you have any ideas for interpolating my function on a sphere without the boundaries of spherical coordinates.</p>

<p>Here is my code in full:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def coordinates(r, n):
    phi, theta = np.mgrid[0:pi:n, 0:2 * pi:n]
    Coor = namedtuple('Coor', 'r phi theta x y z')
    r = r
    x = r * sin(phi) * cos(theta)
    y = r * sin(phi) * sin(theta)
    z = r * cos(phi)
    return Coor(r, phi, theta, x, y, z)

# Creating a sphere
# fine is coordinates on a fine grid
# interp is coordinates on coarse grid for training interpolation
fine = coordinates(1, 100j)
interp = coordinates(1, 5j)


# Defining finection to colour sphere
# Here we are using a spherical harmonic
def harmonic(m, n, theta, phi):
    return special.sph_harm(m, n, theta, phi).real
norm = colors.Normalize()

# One example of the harmonic function, for testing
harmonic13_fine = harmonic(1, 3, fine.theta, fine.phi)
harmonic13_coarse = harmonic(1, 3, interp.theta, interp.phi)


# Train the interpolation using interp coordinates
rbf = Rbf(interp.phi, interp.theta, harmonic13_coarse)
# The result of the interpolation on fine coordinates
interp_values = rbf(fine.phi, fine.theta)


rbf=Rbf(interp.x, interp.y, interp.z, harmonic13_coarse)
interp_values=rbf(fine.x,fine.y,fine.z)

#Figure of harmoinc function on sphere in fine cordinates
#Points3d showing interpolation training points coloured to their value

<p>I am developing a small console application: (linux GNU C on ubuntu Server 12.04 ) to sniffer the wi-fi packets and then get the useful information and store it into database.</p>

<p>I really need to get only the packets coming from stations near by my Access Point (built-in wi-fi card). </p>

<p>First of all I use airmon-ng to turn on my card in monitor mode (mon0) then I read packet by packet with pcap lib.</p>

<p>The second step is to identify the station packets coming from everywhere ...</p>

<p>Problem now: Is there any rules or flags in frame section of the packet to identify the station packets only? How to filter other packets in the network? It doesn't matter if station connected to Access Point or not. I just need to identify station, so I can get the station's MAC address. </p>

<p>My regex expression basically searches for a sequence where word1 is followed by word2 followed by word 3 etc..
So the expression looks like:</p>

<pre><code>strings = re.findall('word1.*?word2.*?word3', f.read(), re.DOTALL)
</code></pre>

<p>For files below 20kb, the expression executes pretty well. However, the execution time exponentially increases for files > 20 kb and the process completely hangs for files close to 100kb.
It appears (after having read previous threads) that the problem is to do with using .* in conjunction with re.DOTALL - leading to ""catastrophic backtracking"". The recommended solution was to provide the input file line by line instead of reading the whole file into a single memory buffer.</p>

<p>However, my input file is filled with random whitespace and ""\n"" newline characters. My word sequence is also long and occurs over multiple lines. Therefore, I need to input the whole file together into the regex expression in conjunction with re.DOTALL - otherwise a line by line search will never find my sequence.</p>

<p>Is there any way around it?</p>

<p>In the  tag I have a script that loads a listview into the above mentioned div when the document is ready...</p>

<p>A professional will be thinking now that the result will be a pile unformatted turd and they'd be right. So my question is, once I've loaded this to the div how do I make it look JQuery Mobiliy again?</p>

<p>I admit I haven't done a thorough search on Google, but in my defense I've been coding all day in Python and PHP so the move to Javascript has fried my brain.</p>

<p>I have a class <code>ModelStateDictionaryWrapper</code> that implements an interface <code>IValidationDictionary</code></p>

<p><strong>ModelStateDictionaryWrapper</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class ModelStateDictionaryWrapper : IValidationDictionary
{
    private readonly ModelStateDictionary modelStateDictionary;

    public bool IsValid
    {
        get
        {

        this.modelStateDictionary = modelStateDictionary;
    }

    public void AddError(string key, string message)
    {
        this.modelStateDictionary.AddModelError(key, message);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>IValidationDictionary</strong></p>

<pre><code>public interface IValidationDictionary
{
    bool IsValid { get; }
    void AddError(string key, string message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my api controller, I am doing this:</p>

<pre><code>public class CategoryController : ControllerBase&lt;ICategoryService&gt;
{
    private ICategoryService categoryService;


    public CategoryController(ICategoryService categoryService)
    {
        this.categoryService = categoryService;
        this.categoryService.ValidationDictionary =
            new ModelStateDictionaryWrapper(this.ModelState);
    }

    public IEnumerable&lt;CategoryViewModel&gt; Get()
    {
        return Mapper.Map&lt;CategoryViewModel[]&gt;(this.Service.GetCategories());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I have with this is I am making a new <code>ModelStateDictionaryWrapper</code> in the constructor of the service and I dont like that.</p>

<p>So I was thinking of changing this to take a factory like so:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IModelStateWrapperFactory
{
   IValidationDictionary GetModelStateWrapper(ModelStateDictionary modelStateDictionary);
}

public class ModelStateWrapperFactory : IModelStateWrapperFactory
{
    public IValidationDictionary GetModelStateWrapper(
        ModelStateDictionary modelStateDictionary)
    {
        return new ModelStateDictionaryWrapper(modelStateDictionary);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then the api controller would look like this (constructor):</p>

<pre><code>public CategoryController(ICategoryService categoryService, 
    IModelStateWrapperFactory modelStateWrapperFactory)
    {
        this.categoryService = categoryService;
        this.categoryService.ValidationDictionary =
            modelStateWrapperFactory.GetModelStateWrapper(this.ModelState);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I think I have removed the tight coupling. Does this look like a good solution?</p>

<p>The login button has an eventlistener which is an <strong>inner-class</strong> of the class that creates the login window.  When user presses the login button, the listener takes the values form the fields and passes it to a validator which validates it using a mysql database and returns true and false based on the input by user. Now based on the return value the listener updates the ui using the <code>if-else</code> statement. This whole thing is working is fine.</p>

<p>The problem is that when the validation is being carried out the gui cannot be used, because every thing is being done with a single thread. So for that time the <code>gui</code> is kind of freezed.

<p>Is this so developers can automatically generate a login form that posts directory to the remote server when the OpenID is known?</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<ol>
<li>User is not logged in and visits your login page.</li>
<li>You detect the user's openID from a cookie.</li>
<li>Form is generated that directly posts to remote OpenID server.</li>
<li>Remote server redirects user back to website.</li>
<li>Website logs in the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this is the case I can see the benefit. However this assumes that you keep the user's openID in a cookie when they log out.</p>

<p>So I have many of these and I want check them all on click. Which of these click handlers is the best from the performance point of view:</p>

if ""test.html"" did not actually exist in my webspace, 
and you try to visit it as <a href=""http://www.example.com/test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/test</a> (which is how my 
link structure will be), it returns my 404 page while maintaining the url 
in the browsers toolbar, BUT, when you try to visit as /test.html it returns 
my 404 page but it also adds a string of text in the url, rather than 
maintaining itself like /test did. This also happens to only .html or .php suffixes 
(if ever mistakenly used).</p>

<p>The string of text is ""var/www/vhosts/example.com/httpdocs/"" and this occurs 
with only my .html and .php 404 returns and it changes my url in the browser toolbar to 
<a href=""http://www.example.com/var/www/vhosts/example.com/httpdocs/test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/var/www/vhosts/example.com/httpdocs/test</a> RATHER than maintaining 
its url like the ""/test"" 404 return does. </p>

<p>Here's the code I currently use, is this a .htaccess type of fix? If so, what code should I arrange or use? Please help, new here. Thanks!</p>

<p>When I replace the ""value"" in WriteValue with a the syntax for the MarkupExtension the XamlXmlWriter escapes the MarkupExtension for me automatically.</p>

<p>So say I set the value to ""{MyExtension}"" the rendered xaml looks like this ""{}{MyExtension}"" - I want the unescaped former version.</p>

<p>Currently I'm doing a nasty Replace(""=\""{}{MyExtension"",""{MyExtension}"") on the xaml after it's been created, which works but isn't pretty.</p>

<p>Is there a way to intercept the writing of the Xaml at the point this escaping goes on and tell it not to escape the MarkUpExtension? Or perhaps there's a better way to render the MarkUpExtension?</p>

<p>I've almost achieve my goal, but met a big scala misfunction: type erasure of underlying jvm. The constructions I've used is illegal for scala since I want parametrized trait be extendiable with ""with"" clause.</p>

<p>Compiler complaining about </p>

<pre><code>mixed.scala:53: error: illegal inheritance;
class ArithmAccum inherits different type instances of trait Handler:
Handler[ProdMsg] and Handler[SumMsg]
class ArithmAccum (var store: Int) extends SumHandler with MulHandler
</code></pre>

<p>What options do I have? I can't use the pattern I've designed and need to find an equal replacement by usability. May anoyone suggest alternative source code solution? Is there a scala plugin (they seemed to exist for compiler) or another method to change backends for scala parametrized types from java generics to c++ like code generation?</p>

<p>Example Data
Columns are in the first line(Tab delimited) DataRows are in the following rows(Tab delimited)<br>
RouteCode   City    EmailAddress    FirstName<br>
NULL    MyCity  My-Email    MyFirstName</p>

<p>What I am seeing is all the Columns are added fine but each row added the first tab value is not detected so it shifts the columns(hope I am making sense)  so in this case the city data is sitting in the RouteCode column and the last column somehow is getting the first row value (tab).</p>

<p>I've decided that I want to startprogramming and especially for mobiledevices, since this would provide a goodoppotunity to practice.</p>

<p>My question is which to start out with. I have little to no experience in programming I tried pickng up C++ when I was about 14, since I was told that C++ was the best and only language you should know (bad advice). </p>

<p>I've started out programming a bit in Java, following thenewboston tutorials. and the Standford lectures. But haven't gotten so far that starting over with another language would be a bad idea. </p>

<p><strong>I've read here that learning C, before starting iPhone development and Objective-C programming, is a good idea.</strong> But at the same time <strong>I've read that starting out with C will later make it tough(er) to program/learn C++ (making you code c++ as C).</strong> </p>

<p><strong>I've also contemplated starting out with C++ from the get go, but I'm not sure that will enable me to program for iPhone to the same extend that learning C will?</strong> - I know that the Android NDK is in C++, so that's a plus. But <strong>I don't really know what kind of stuff you can develop with the NDK?</strong> Perhaps starting out with C++ would make me a better C++ programmer, than going through C first? which could be a plus if I ever want to do stuff outside of Objective-C (for non mobile projects). </p>

<p>I could just continue with my Java learning and code for Android, but it seems there's just more support for the iPhone plus their interface builder is much better than the android version. (just from reading on the net) Wouldn't it be easier to go from C/C++/Objective-C to Java than the other way around? </p>

<p>Anyway, I'm rambling. 
The books I have on my shelf are: Accelerated C++ The C programming Language (the white book) An introduction to programming and object oriented design using Java Version 5.0 
Any thoughts are appreciated. </p>

<p>[edit: added some specific questions]
1. Is it a problem learning C before C++? (for a new programmer)
2. Is it equally good to learn C++ before objective-C as it is to learn C before.
3. Is the documentation for Objective-C big enough to learn it as a first language? (without any prior C knowledge)
4. If I want to code for both iPhone and android will learning one before the other be better?</p>

<p>*I tried the assignmentent <code>(UPDATE clasificacion SET puntos=puntos+1)</code> in a concrete row outside the trigger an it works perfectly.</p>

<p>Here I have a super simple program that displays a gif image.  It works perfectly.</p>

<pre><code>from Tkinter import *

canvas = Canvas(width=300, height=300, bg='white')   
canvas.pack()

photo=PhotoImage(file=sys.argv[1])
canvas.create_image(0, 0, image=photo, anchor=NW)  # embed a photo
print canvas
print photo

mainloop( )
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I change the program slightly to edit the canvas object from within a function.  This time, I just get a blank canvas.</p>

<pre><code># demo all basic canvas interfaces
from Tkinter import *

canvas = Canvas(width=300, height=300, bg='white')

canvas.pack()

def set_canvas(cv):
    photo=PhotoImage(file=sys.argv[1])
    cv.create_image(0, 0, image=photo, anchor=NW)  # embed a photo
    print cv
    print photo

set_canvas(canvas)
mainloop( )
</code></pre>

<p>The only difference between the two is that in one the canvas object is passed to a function instead of being used directly.  Both print statements return identical results.  I am wondering if there is perhaps some breakdown in the object model at the tcl/python layer.</p>

For the iOS to know to auto install an app, it requires a direct link to a plist file, which contains an URL with a direct link to IPA file. The browser knows when it sees the plist file to follow the URL to the IPA file and start installing the app.</p>

<p>Problem: my plist and IPA files are stored outside of the www directory for security/other reasons.</p>

<pre><code>$platform = $_GET[""platform""];

        &lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;"";

<p>downloadApp.php</p>

<pre><code>$platform = $_GET[""platform""];

$version = $_GET[""version""];

$appName = $platform.""_"".$version."".ipa"";
$appPath = FILES_DIR.""/systemAccount/"".$systemAccountID.""/ipa/"";
$appFile = $appPath.$appName;

header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');

$handle = fopen($appFile, 'r');
$ipaContent = fread($handle, filesize($appFile));
fclose($handle);

echo $ipaContent;
</code></pre>

<p>To summarize: My attempted solution is to send them to a PHP page that has a XML header, which then the iOS browser should see the IPA url and the downloadApp page contains the IPA file content.</p>

<p>I've also tried htaccess 301 redirects and changed the php file extensions in the URL to .plist and .ipa and had .htaccess then autoredirect to the php extensions, but no luck there as well.</p>

<p>Ultimately, when I click on the link nothing happens at this point. I've tested my XML/plist document in my browser and it prints out just fine.</p>

<p>Anyone with experience in getting getting an iOS enterprise app to download (not via the app store) when the files are off the www directory, I would greatly appreciate your input.</p>

<p>Is it acceptable to provide the implementation by casting the implementation back to <code>NetworkInterface</code> and then to <code>ManagedNetworkInterface</code>?</p>

<p>So basically the labels lead to a detail page for each item.  I can't seem to find a way to change the font type within the description..

I tried <code>html</code> tags (<code>&lt;b&gt; label &lt;/b&gt;</code>) but that didn't work either.</p>

<p>I have a table, contains two columns: name, and category. The category is factor variable, contains 10 levels, say '0' to '9'. So the data frame looks like:</p>

<pre><code>name   category
a        0
a        1
a        1
a        4
a        9
b        2
b        2
b        2
b        3
b        7
b        8
c        0
c        0
c        0
</code></pre>

<p>The result I want to aggregate looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>name category.0  category.1  category.2 category.3 category.4 ..... category.9
a        1           2            0         0           1               1
b        0           0            3         1           0               0            
c        3           0            0         0           0               0
</code></pre>

<p>it counts how many '0','1',...,'9' for each unique name.</p>

<p>What I did to generate the result, is to use a simple aggregate function</p>

<pre><code>new_df &lt;- aggregate(category ~ name,df, FUN=summary)
</code></pre>

<p>and then unlist the second columns of new_df to get the result.</p>

<p>However, it is too slow. I would like to know if there is more efficient way to do this. </p>

<p>The problem is, that when I do that...I the first nine divs...one after another...up to about 6 and I can click and scroll to see the rest. Up to 9...the problem is that Div 10 
is for some reason wrapping around and is underneath Div 1. </p>

<p>The reason for this I believe is because the scollableArea wrapper div that is put around 
my 10 divs by calling the scrollable function is a few pixels too short. It is set to auto so it's supposed to (i assume) automatically set itself to be big enough...</p>

<p>I suppose I can hack it and dynamically extend it a few pixels and it'll be fine...Because I tried increasing its pixels in the chrome developer...</p>

<p>I've got the project names, but getting the actual work items is what's giving me a hard time.  Here's what I've got so far:</p>

<pre><code>public const string tfsLocation = ""http://whatever"";

// get the top list of project names from the team foundation server
public List&lt;string&gt; LoadProjectList()
{
    var tpc = TfsTeamProjectCollectionFactory.GetTeamProjectCollection(new Uri(tfsLocation));

    var projects = (from Project project in workItemStore.Projects select project.Name).ToList();

    return projects;
}

public string GetProjectInfo(string targetProject)
{
    string info = String.Empty;

    var tpc = TfsTeamProjectCollectionFactory.GetTeamProjectCollection(new Uri(tfsLocation));
    var workItemStore = new WorkItemStore(tpc);

                info += ""\n"";
            }
        }
    }

    return info;
}
</code></pre>

<p>GetProjectInfo sends back some helpful info about what's in each project, but so far it looks like I'm only seeing the <em>definitions</em> of what the WorkItems consist of, and not the <em>actual</em> WorkItems themselves.  I think the programming I've written is looking in the wrong place.</p>

<p>From Microsoft's definition of WorkItem,
(<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.workitemtracking.client.workitem.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.workitemtracking.client.workitem.aspx</a>)
it looks like it's inside WorkItemTracking.Client, but not inside the WorkItemStore, and I'm not sure where to go to access it.</p>

<p><strong>FINAL VERSION:</strong></p>

<p>Here's the updated version of my function, after referencing the below answer.  This just returns a long string of the work item names with new lines between, for printing out, which is all I'm trying to get working (for now).</p>

<pre><code>public string GetProjectInfo(string targetProject)
{
    string info = String.Empty;

    var tpc = TfsTeamProjectCollectionFactory.GetTeamProjectCollection(new Uri(tfsLocation));
    WorkItemStore workItemStore = new WorkItemStore(tpc);

    Query query = new Query(workItemStore, ""SELECT * FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @project"", new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;() { { ""project"", targetProject } });

    WorkItemCollection wic = query.RunQuery();

    foreach (WorkItem item in wic)
    {
        info += String.Format(""{0}\n"", item.Title);
    }

    return info;
}

<pre><code>TopDocs results = mySearcher.search(
    new FuzzyQuery(new Term(""text"", term), 2, 0),
    10);
</code></pre>

<p>I can do searches with emails just fine.  Searching for <code>a@b.com</code>, <code>ab@c.com</code> all work.  I can search for single-word names like <code>Madonna</code> just fine as well.  But as soon as I try to find multi-word names, it all falls apart.  Searches for <code>John</code>, <code>Jane</code>, <code>John Doe</code>, or <code>Doe</code> all return no results.</p>

<p>I'm curious for a better approach (there's some obvious limits with how far a 2-edit-distance match can take me), and also how I can make multi-word matches work.</p>

<pre><code>// List all files from specific directory
    public void listFiles(){

        // Path to directory to scane
        String path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString()+""/Download/"";

        // New file-instance
        File f = new File(path);

        // Get the textview to display message
        TextView textview = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView);

        textview.setText(f.toString());

        // List the files
        File file[] = f.listFiles();

        for(int i = 0; i &lt; file.length; i++){
            Log.d(""Files"", ""Filename: "" + file[i].getName());
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I know that this is caused by file.length in my for loop, but I don't understand why I get this error since it grabs the files in the right directory and I have files within that directory...</p>

<p>The result is like this: I can add new categories/points, stacks and columns properly. I can remove the latest categories properly, it shifts to left and they are rendered fine. But when I remove category A from the categories [A,B,C,D] the result is rendered as [C,D,3]. However, it should be [B,C,D]. And whenever I add any new category after this it increases the last number instead of the string I give.</p>

<p>I am wondering what would be wrong the code above and what the proper way to add/remove categories,points,data to/from stacked column chart is.</p>

    //start data here
    0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 //example data
    //end data block

    };
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to use QTcpSocket to write this data.  QTcpSocket will allow me to write char data, or QByteArray, but when I attempt to save this data in either of these formats, it fails.  The only way I am successfully able to save the data is in an unsigned char array.</p>

<p>Example of what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>char message[12] = {
    0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55,
    0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
    0xAA, 0xAA, 0xAA, 0xAA};
</code></pre>

<p>However, this message block gives me an error </p>

<pre><code>C4309: 'initializing' : truncation of constant value.
</code></pre>

<p>And when printing this data, it comes out as:</p>

<pre><code>U U U U
r
</code></pre>

<p>with the r being more like the edge of a square than the actual letter</p>

<p>This particular issue is fixed by changing the array from char to unsigned char</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char message[12] = {
    0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55,
    0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
    0xAA, 0xAA, 0xAA, 0xAA};
</code></pre>

<p>which when printed then comes out with the data:</p>

<pre><code>85 85 85 85
1 0 0 0
170 170 170 170
</code></pre>

<p>This matches the format that the device I am talking to is expecting.  However, if I put the data in this format, QTcpSocket doesn't like that, and responds back with:</p>

<pre><code>C2664: 'qint64 QIODevice::write(const QByteArray &amp;)': cannot convert argument 1
from 'unsigned char[20]' to 'const char *'
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to send the data that I am wanting to with QTcpSocket, or do I need to figure out how to write this message using windows sockets?</p>

I need to have a <code>show</code> and <code>index</code> action for a <code>Question</code> model. In this example, a <code>Question has_many Answers.</code></p>

<p>How do you deal with a nil object in RABL? The API throws an error because I'm calling <code>.answers</code> on a <code>question</code> object that is <code>nil</code> (the <code>question_id</code> passed in doesn't exist).  </p>

<p>I could wrap the association part of the RABL with an <code>if</code> like below so a <code>question</code> that doesn't exist won't cause an error,</p>

<pre><code># questions/show.rabl
object @question
attributes :id, :text

node(:answer_id) do |question|
    if question != nil     # &lt;-- This if keeps the .answers from blowing up
        answer = question.answers.first
        answer != nil ? answer.id : nil
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But, then when I call <code>/api/questions/id_that_doesn't_exist</code> I get this returned: <code>{answer_id:null}</code> instead of just <code>{}</code>.</p>

<p>I tried wrapping the entire node element in an <code>if</code> like this,</p>

<pre><code>if @question != nil    # &lt;-- the index action doesn't have a @question variable
    node(:answer_id) do |question|
        answer = question.answers.first
        answer != nil ? answer.id : nil
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But then my <code>index</code> action won't return the <code>node(:answer_id)</code> because <code>@question</code> doesn't exist when calling from a collection.  </p>

I'm trying to apply this conditionally using ng-class which is fine, but how to do it by $index selection I don't know. I've looked at examples using the ternary and logic ( &amp;&amp; ) operators but can't seem to get the syntax right. To clarify I'd like one button when clicked to change it's icon and it's colour.

<p>I fixed this using the selected ng-repeat item as suggested. Since the regular 'class' on an html element sort of acts like the 'else' clause in an if/else I used that to evaluate the default state of the button, btn-primary with glyphicon-minus and ng-class to change the state on click by id.</p>

<p>According to the above code when I initiate a curve in miracle the points are in Affine coordinate . I should first change them in Jacobian coordinate and then do the next steps. I don't know how to change affine point to Jacobian point . 
a basic problem is that I couldn't understand how miracle initial the curve with this code and give me Doubling.</p>

<p>how can I change these numbers if I want do the steps in paper and compare my result. I mean what numbers can I put instead of this numbers in common.ecs ? I hope I can explain my problems more than before . I am very confused :(</p>

Each data point has a set of fixed attributes which may be 1-d numeric, factors, or characters, and also a set of variable length data.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>id  phrase                    num_tokens  token_lengths

<p>The actual values are not all computable from one another, but that's the flavor of the data.

I'd also like to index and average values in the variable length portion by index. This doesn't work, but something like: <code>mean(data$token_lengths[1], na.rm=TRUE))</code></p>

<p>I've found I can shoehorn ""token_lengths"" into a data.frame by making it an array:</p>

One of the improvements in version 3 i have read about is with dependency injection and the in-built service locator. So far my understanding is that i can remove my implentation of the controller factory and instead implement the IDependencyResolver interface. Now all i have to do is change the following in my Application_Start method:</p>

<pre><code>var container = new UnityContainer();
...
ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider(() =&gt; new UnityServiceLocator(container));
ControllerBuilder.Current.SetControllerFactory(new UnityControllerFactory(container));
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>var container = new UnityContainer();
...
DependencyResolver.SetResolver(new UnityDependencyResolver(container));
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good, but i've seen reports that i also need to implement IControllerActivator. The examples i have seen simply shows how this uses the dependency resolver so i can't see why the default implementation doesn't do this automatically. If someone could explain this that would be great. I'm guessing i need to implement this interface to get constructor injection within my controllers. But how would i inject a dependency within say an action filter. Before i would have said:</p>

<pre><code>var authorizationService = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance&lt;IAuthorizationService&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>I know i could probably switch this out to use the new DependencyResolver but i thought that with ASP.NET MVC 3 it would allow me to tidy this up otherwise i don't see how the DependencyResolver is any different from the ServiceLocator.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate if you could help clarify a few of my issues as i like to understand something fully before i go ahead and implement it.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm struggling with that about few days and any advice found in the net wasn't good enough.</p>

<p>I was trying with </p>

<pre><code>@page:last {} 
</code></pre>

<p>or with :</p>

<pre><code>@bottom-left {
                content: element(footer_one, last-except);
            }

            @bottom-right{
                content: element(footer_two, last-except);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>but it seems that :last pseudo selector doesn't work.</p>

<p>The best approach would be to have totally different one footer on last page,  which would include content of those three footers. 
I can add footer only on last page but I can't disable then those simple footers form previous pages. </p>

<p>Maybe there is some other approach ? 
I would be appreciate for any help. </p>

<p>But I have been trying to solve the actual time complexity function. This is how far I got and could not proceed any further:</p>

<p>summation from i = 1 to n-2, summation from j = (i+1) to n-1, summation from k = (j+1) to n.</p>

<p>I understand that the inner most loop performs n - (j+1) steps, the middle loop performs (n-1)-(i+1) steps, and the outer loop performs (n-2)-i steps. I just need some pointers on how to simplify the summations to come to a time complexity function.</p>

<p>However, there are no column names in my data frame. When I search for ""names"" in my JSON object R returns ""NULL"" so that doesn't give me anything useful.</p>

<p>I am wondering if there is any simple way (that might be repeatable on more general cases) to get the names for the column headers from the JSON schema.</p>

<p>I'm aware there are similar questions elsewhere on the site, but this one did not appear to be covered. </p>

The rewrite rule in the request for replacing the /foo/bar to the localhost adress does  already work, but I've some problems to define a rule for setting up the correct cookie path in the response.</p>

<p>I've already found an article about manipulating responses <a href=""http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/658/using-outbound-rules-to-add-web-analytics-tracking-code/"">here</a>.
For me, it looks like with II7 I can only manipulate the HTTP body of the response.  </p>

<p>How can I manipulate the response header in a way to edit the cookie path? </p>

<p>The cookie path in the response header looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=1lu7hn253csbh11jax27k2i072;Path=/foo

<p>The Path should be edited to ""Path=/"".</p>

Some of libraries used in my injected dll are mostly statically linked under BSD or MIT license (as i suppose im allowed to do that?) but other are under LGPL so I have to use them when as dlls, because static linking is not allowed (correct me if wrong). So how can I make injected dll to work with other dll? When i try to just compile libs as dlls, injected dll is crashing, statically linking them works.</p>

<p>EDIT:
My dll is injected by this function:</p>

<pre><code>bool InjectLibrary(HANDLE hProcess, char *fnDll) {

        BOOL success = FALSE;
        HANDLE hThread = NULL;
        char *fnRemote = NULL;
        FARPROC procLoadLibraryA = NULL;

        size_t lenFilename = strlen(fnDll) + 1;

        /* Allocate space in the remote process */
        fnRemote = (char *)VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, lenFilename, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);

        if (fnRemote) {

            /* Write the filename to the remote process. */
            if (WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, fnRemote, fnDll, lenFilename, NULL)) {

                /* Get the address of the LoadLibraryA function */
                procLoadLibraryA = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(""Kernel32""), ""LoadLibraryA"");
                hThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)procLoadLibraryA, fnRemote, 0, NULL);

                if (hThread) {
                    WaitForSingleObject(hThread, INFINITE);
                    success = TRUE;
                }

            VirtualFreeEx(hProcess, fnRemote, 0, MEM_RELEASE);
        }

        return success;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So how does injected dll know where are dlls that it was compiled with to use and how it loads them if does or maybe it checks existance of dll in process where it actually is injected. Should I inject used dll to that process by same method before? Trying but crash.</p>

<p>EDIT2:
Well maybe crash wasnt precise as i see now. After executing InjectLibrary to inject my dll I get message box, which I was thinking was just crash report but it is: ""Windows - System Error"" - ""Exception Processing Message.. (many random memory adreses)..."" with OK button, and nothing happens later. Looks like such dll which is using another dll doesnt want to be loaded.</p>

<p>The Package Name is correct, Api Key is correct, Certificate Fingerprint is wrong i have never use this Certificate Fingerprint.
So i create a new Certificate use the SHA1 Fingerprint to create a new Api key past in manifest.xml</p>

<pre><code>Warning: preg_replace() [function.preg-replace]: Compilation failed: unknown option bit(s) set at offset -1 in /path/to/public_html/wp-includes/shortcodes.php on line 257

<p>That line in wp-includes/shortcodes.php is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$text = preg_replace(""/[\x{00a0}\x{200b}]+/u"", "" "", $text);
</code></pre>

<p>I found this article that seemed to match up fairly well with my problem: <a href=""http://labs.sasslantis.ee/2011/05/errors-in-wordpress-after-php-upgrade/"">http://labs.sasslantis.ee/2011/05/errors-in-wordpress-after-php-upgrade/</a></p>

<p>The article describes a situation in which there is different output of <code>phpinfo();</code> in apache and on commandline with regard to <code>libpcre</code></p>

<p>I verified that this is my issue by creating a test file with <code>phpinfo();</code> in it and also ran the following from the shell:</p>

<pre><code>php -r ""phpinfo();""
</code></pre>

<p>The script (apache?) version returns <code>PCRE Library Version 6.6 06-Feb-2006</code>
The commandline version returns <code>PCRE Library Version =&gt; 8.21 2011-12-12</code></p>

<p>I'm left wondering what to do.  I'm not super well versed in command line usage, so I'm turning to you all hoping for some help.</p>

<p>The article mentions ""fixing apache start-flags"".  I'm not sure what that means.</p>

<p>I've also found a comment somewhere else saying: ""OK, it turned out that the problem was an older version of libpcre hanging around on the system and getting loaded by mistake. Once I updated to the latest version of libpcre, problem fixed.""  I'm not entirely sure how to vet this information on the server.</p>

<p>==== Edit 1 ====</p>

<p>I've have more information:</p>

<pre><code>/opt/pcre/bin/pcretest -C
</code></pre>

<p>Returns</p>

<pre><code>PCRE version 8.21 2011-12-12
Compiled with
UTF-8 support
Unicode properties support
No just-in-time compiler support
Newline sequence is LF
\R matches all Unicode newlines
Internal link size = 2
POSIX malloc threshold = 10
Default match limit = 10000000
Default recursion depth limit = 10000000
Match recursion uses stack
</code></pre>

<p>This is not entirely surprising because we already know that the command line returns the correct version.  But for some crazy unknown reason PHP, when run via the web, doesn't return the proper pcre values.</p>

<p>==== Edit 2 ====</p>

<p>I was tipped this article: <a href=""http://www.bigboylemonade.com/pcre-version-problem-on-cpanel"">http://www.bigboylemonade.com/pcre-version-problem-on-cpanel</a></p>

<p>Running <code>pcretest -C</code> without the full path returns:</p>

So what was impossible to mock in Moq or Rhino Mocks, now no longer is the case.</p>

<p>I've always had some aversion with the idea of using an interface merely to be able to allow for mocking, when otherwise just the concrete class would exist. I'm not alone in this view (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/90851/is-it-just-me-or-are-interfaces-overused"">here</a>, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/956011/useless-interfaces"">here</a>, and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2659366/java-interfaces-methodology-should-every-class-implement-an-interface"">here</a>). In the later it's implied that 'modern' mocking frameworks no longer need interfaces for testing or dependency injection.</p>

<p>However, while I can't speak for TypeMock Isolator, I can say that using Mocks in Microsoft Moles is extremely slow. Having code like the following in unit tests makes the speed of the test too slow to be used often:</p>

<pre><code>MFile.ReadAllLinesString = (s) =&gt; csvDataCorrectlyFormatted;
MDirectoryInfo.AllInstances.GetFilesString = (di,fi) =&gt; fileInfoArray;
MFileInfo.AllInstances.NameGet = (fi) =&gt; ""Doesn't Matter"";
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sure that if the method being tested was programmed to an interface or abstract base class (so that the file system code could be abstracted away in a wrapper of sorts) that using frameworks like Moq for stubbing or mocking would end up being faster. But then we are back to the situation of having added production code complexity for basically the ability to unit test.</p>

<p>I'm leaning to the opinion that Isolator and Moles should only be used when one can't mock with traditional mocking frameworks. Yet, I still struggle with notion of having added production code complexity for the sake of testing. </p>

<p>I'm curious what the rest of the community thinks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 10/06/10:</strong> By saying I struggle with the notion of having added production code complexity for the the sake of testing, I'm referring to the adding an interface (or abstract class even) when otherwise one isn't needed, such as when making the concrete class non-sealed and methods virtual would do. The latter still allows seams for testing. Even if later one finds the need to use an interface for multiple implementations, couldn't they extract it from the class? But unless that need arises, why not follow <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it"">YAGNI</a>. </p>

<p>I'm all for the SOLID principles where they make the architecture of a program easier to maintain. I don't think these principles need to be followed religiously in every case. I think the mantra, ""It always depends"", comes into play many times. Otherwise, one is left with every concrete type having an interface or abstract base class, even when there will be only one implementation.</p>

<p>Lastly, I'm not saying that because Isolator and Moles allows one to get around isolation limitations in dynamic-proxy-based frameworks that one shouldn't still design architecture to be maintainable. In many cases, the SOLID principles are what is best, and thus Isolator or Moles wouldn't be needed. It's the cases where the interface is used solely for testing that I am questioning. I'm bringing up another side point about speed too. If one chooses to use Isolator and Moles it appears to bring a speed penalty. So I certainly don't think that they make dynamic-proxy-based frameworks obsolete.</p>

Everything is fine, my model was trained and I have corrects results when I use my model. But it's slow !</p>

<p>The testing part for training look like this:</p>

<pre><code>model:evaluate()

-- test over test data
print('==&gt; testing on test set:')
for t = 1,testData:size() do
   -- disp progress
   xlua.progress(t, testData:size())

   local input = testData.data[t]
   if opt.type == 'double' then input = input:double()
   elseif opt.type == 'cuda' then input = input:cuda() end
   local target = testData.labels[t]

   -- test sample
   local pred = model:forward(input)
   confusion:add(pred, target)
end

-- timing
time = sys.clock() - time
time = time / testData:size()
print(""\n==&gt; time to test 1 sample = "" .. (time*1000) .. 'ms')

<p>I have the following speed recorded during testing:</p>

<p><code>==&gt; time to test 1 sample = 12.419194088996ms</code></p>

<p>(Of course it vary, but it's ~12ms).</p>

<p>I want to use the learned model on others images, so I did this in a simple and new script:</p>

<pre><code>(... requires)

torch.setnumthreads(8)
torch.setdefaulttensortype('torch.FloatTensor')

model = torch.load('results/model.net')
model:evaluate()

(... Image loading, resizing and normalization)

local time = sys.clock()

local result_info = model:forward(cropped_image:double())

print(""==&gt; time to test 1 frame = "" .. (sys.clock() - time) * 1000 .. ""ms"")
</code></pre>

<p>The time spent is much bigger, I have the following output: <code>==&gt; time to test 1 frame = 212.7647127424ms</code></p>

<p>I tested with more than one image, always with the resizing and normalization outside clock's measurements, and I always have > 200ms / image.</p>

<p>I don't understand what I'm doing wrong and why my code is much slower than during the training/testing. </p>

I have a server application which accepts incomming queries and executes them. If there are too many queries they should be queued and if some of the other queries got executed the queued queries should be executed as well. Since I want to pass queries with different priorities I think using a priority_queue would be the best choice. </p>

<p>e.g. The amout of the axcepting queries (a) hit the limt and new queries will be stored in the queue. All queries have a priority of 1 (lowest) if some of the queries from (a) get executed the programm will pick the query with the highest priority out of the queue and execute it. Still no problem. Now someone is sending a query with a priority of 5 which gets added to the queue. Since this is the query with the highest priority the application will execute this query as soon as the running queries no longer hit the  limit. There might be the worst case that 500 queries with a priority of 1 are queued but wont be executed since someone is always sending queries with a priority of 5 hence these 500 queries will be queued for a looooong time. In order to prevent that I want to increase the prioritiy of all queries which have a lower priority than the query with the higher priority, in this example which have a priority lower than 5. So if the query with a priority of 5 gets pulled out of the queue all other queries with a priority &lt; 5 should be increased by 0.2. This way queries with a low priority wont be queued for ever even if there might be 100 queries with a higher priority.</p>

<p>I really hope someone can help me to solve the problem with the priorities:</p>

<p>Since my queries consist of an object I thought something like this might work:</p>

<pre><code>class Query {
public:
    Query( std::string p_stQuery ) : stQuery( p_stQuery ) {};
    std::string getQuery() const {return stQuery;};
    void increasePriority( const float fIncrease ) {fPriority += fIncrease;};

    friend bool operator &lt; ( const Query&amp; PriorityFirst, const Query&amp; PriorityNext ) {
        if( PriorityFirst.fPriority &lt; PriorityNext.fPriority ) {
            if( PriorityFirst.fStartPriority &lt; PriorityNext.fStartPriority ) {
                Query qTemp = PriorityFirst;
                qTemp.increasePriority( INCREASE_RATE );
            }

            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    };

private:
    static const float INCREASE_RATE = 0.2;
    float fPriority; // current priority
    float fStartPriority; // initialised priority
    std::string stQuery;
};

<p>Since I am very new in Cloud Computing matters, I would like to ask you a question: Google Cloud Messaging for Android works from server to client, but also viceversa(from client to server)? </p>

<p>I am asking you this, because I am currently developing an Android application. The structure, in general lines, it's something like: I would like to use my laptop as a server - and perform all the computations here. Then, from my server (laptop), to send everything in the cloud, and from the cloud, directly to my Android running device. I want to perform the computing and database storage on my local server (because, since I am a student, I won't have enough money to actually pay for a server from google (let's say), so I am focusing on what's free and suitable to my needs) and just communicate with my Android device using Google Cloud Messaging for Android. (I want my application to be independent from the hardware of my mobile device, and also, I want to write the program that will perform the computations on my server in Java).</p>

<p>I know that I can send messages from the server to my device(through cloud), but the question is: can I also send messages from my device to the server ? I am asking this, because the computations will be made after I submit something from my device (basically, my Android application will be an interface, from where I can send the data to my server (through cloud) and then receive (also through cloud) the results of the computation on my device)</p>

<p>According to what I've been currently reading (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html</a>) it seems that I can only send messages from the server to my device, but I decided to ask, since, so far, was the only free messaging framework(using cloud) I have found.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Another dept. at work asked me to look over the following HTML code.  They are asking me to figure out why when someone enters data in the search box form and clicks submit the page refreshes.  They do NOT want the page to refresh when either clicking the submit button or when selecting any of the 'filters'.</p>

<p>I have been looking over the code now for a few hours and I am not well versed enough with JQuery to know where to look for the 'Page Refresh' functionality.</p>

            alert('You must enter at least one keyword.');

        }

    });   

$( '#app-prefilter input[type=radio]').each(function() {

});               

// If user clicks on an option, set prefilter field, and submit form
$(""#app-prefilter"").click(function() {
    var allVals = [];
    $( '#app-prefilter :checked').each(function() {
       allVals.push($(this).val());
    });
    $( '#prefilter').val(allVals);   
    $( ""#"" + 'searchform').submit();        
});     


function checkFilterBoxes() {
$(""#searchform input"").each(function() {

In that XML i have for example „ (DEC: 132) and “ (DEC:147).
In the XML those characters are not visible, but still there. Flash isn't able to show them. My approach was to get each charCode and convert it to string, but that does only work for printable characters.</p>

byteArray.writeMultiByte(textToConvert,""iso-8859-1"");

<p>I know that arrays are the lightest containers and are the best at random access, so they're obviously the ideal choice if you only consider performance. However, their rigidness is a pain when you don't know how big your list will be.</p>

<p>So here's my question: is it worth it to systematically use the following type of mechanism in classes who have one or more list of unpredictable size:</p>

<pre><code>public class unpredictable
public Object[]realArray;
private LinkedList&lt;Object&gt; temp;

//what using classes will call to add items
public void add(Object item) 
{
    temp.add( item );
}

//what the outer class calls when it knows there's nothing left to add 
public void doneAdding() 
{
    realArray = new Object[tmp.size()];
    transferAndRecycle();
}

private void transferAndRecycle()
{
    // copy items from linkedlist to array
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess I'm asking if it's worth it to take the extra steps to get rid of the extra space Java's LinkedList object takes?</p>

On every click, we will log information like date, age and gender (these come from Facebook), location, etc.</p>

<p>We are discussing about the best place to store these information and use them for real-time stats. We will display aggregate statistics: for example, number of clicks, number of clicks made by male/female, number of clicks divided by age groups (e.g. 18-24, 24-30...).</p>

<p>Since on the site we are using MongoDB everywhere, my colleague thought we should store statistics inside it as well.
I, however, would prefer a SQL-based database for this task, like MySQL (or maybe Drizzle), because I believe SQL is better when doing operations like data aggregation. Although there's the overhead of parsing the SQL, I think MySQL/Drizzle may actually be faster than No-SQL databases here. And inserts are not slow too, when using INSERT DELAYED queries.</p>

<p>Please note that we do not need to perform JOINS or collect data from multiple tables/collections. Thus, we don't care if the database is different.
However, we do care about scalability and reliability. We are building something that will (hopefully) become very big, and we've designed every single line of code with scalability in mind.</p>

<p>What do you think about this?
Is there any reason to prefer MongoDB over MySQL/Drizzle for this? Or is it indifferent?
Which one would you use, if you were us?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 5/1/2011</strong></p>

<p>I found the following official statement...
I wonder when Micorsoft will release an update to Microsoft.Web.Helper to remove the deprecated functionality. </p>

<p>Note: Bing team at Microsoft announced that they will be shutting down siteowner service on April 4th. This will prevent you to use the AdvancedSearchBox feature of Bing on your website/blog or web applications. Here is the quote from Bing's official blog:</p>

<p>As of April 4th, 2011 we will discontinue support for the bing.com/siteowner functionality. If you continue to leverage the feature after this date (April 4th, 2011), users who attempt to query in the search box will be redirected to a 404 page. This means that you will need to move to the Bing API in order to continue to receive web or site search results from us. We have decided to take this step for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, the tool has not been getting a lot of use and while we have some very loyal customers on it, we believe we can provide you better alternatives in the future as we free up resources.</p>

<p>Second, the functionality available through bing.com/siteowner can be replicated with the Bing search API and so it feels a bit redundant.</p>

<p>As has become customary, we will give you a window to migrate off and ask us any questions you may have about this change. We will also provide reminders as we get closer to April 4th. Thank you so much for your support.</p>

For R11+, to save screen space, I do not display the Action Bar on ""normal"" screens, but do on ""large"" and ""xlarge"". With the Action Bar present, the menu icon is on the Action Bar in the upper right corner; on normal-size screens, without hardkeys, it is at the lower right in the bar with the Home and Back buttons. This is functioning as expected on the latest phones and tablets.</p>

<p>Now I've had two customers with some sort of direct-from-China-on-eBay 7"" tablet running Android 4.0.4 who are not seeing either the Action Bar or the menu icon in the Home/Back bar. I see two malfunctions here: first, that it must be reporting its screen as ""normal"" since it's using the ""NoActionBar"" theme; and secondly that it's not then showing the menu icon in the bottom bar. The users state that this device has access to Google Play, so I assume it's an approved device.</p>

<p>Has anyone run into anything like this? The only solution I can see -- since I don't want to activate the Action Bar on everyone's smartphone -- is to add a settings option to display the Action Bar. Any other ideas?</p>

The problem is, that it calls the function in the base class instead of the one from the derived class. </p>

<p>Here is the base class:</p>

<pre><code> #pragma once

   virtual void update(double dt){}
   virtual void render(){}

        ~State_Splash();

        void update(double dt);
        void render();
    };

<p>Header file:</p>

<pre><code>    #include ""State.h""

    #include &lt;map&gt;
    #include &lt;string&gt;

    void StateManager::AddState(std::string stateId, State state){

        m_StateMap.insert(std::pair&lt;std::string, State&gt;(stateId, state));

<p>So tracking should be now based on current device position itself and its relation with the room walls, floor and ceiling. As I understand kinect should be able to reflect light from the walls and give the deph - of what is my current distance from the wall etc. I need to get some information if this is even possible to achieve.</p>

<p>In the replies i was clear that my assumptions where wrong and the Algorithm cannot find factors in linear time. </p>

<p>However I would like to know if the algorithm is an unique way to do division and find factors; that is do any similar/same way to do division is known? I am posting the algorithm here again: </p>

<pre><code>Input: A Number (whose factors is to be found)
Output: The two factor of the Number. If the one of the factor found is 1 then it can be concluded that the
Number is prime.

Integer N, mL, mR, r;
Integer temp1; // used for temporary data storage
mR = mL = square root of (N);
/*Check if perfect square*/
temp1 = mL * mR;
if temp1 equals N then
{
  r = 0; //answer is found
  End;
}
mR = N/mL; (have the value of mL less than mR)
r = N%mL;
while r not equals 0 do
{
  mL = mL-1;
  r = r+ mR;

  temp1 = r/mL;
  mR = mR + temp1;
  r = r%mL;
}
End; //mR and mL has answer
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know your inputs/ The question is purely out of personal interest to know if a similar algorithm exists to do division and find factors, which I am not able to find. </p>

<p>I understand and appreciate thay you may require to understand my <em>funny</em> algorithm to give answers! :)</p>

<p>*Further explanation:
Yes, it does work on numbers above 10 (which i tested) and all positive integers. 
The algorithm depends on remainder r to proceed further.I basically formed the idea that for a number, its factors gives us the sides of the
rectangles whose area is the number itself. For all other numbers which are not factors there would be a
remainder left, or consequently the rectangle cannot be formed in complete.
Thus idea is for each decrease of mL, we can increase r = mR+r (basically shifting one mR from mR*mL to r) and then this large r is divided by mL to see how much we can increase mR (how many times we can increase mR for one decrease of mL). Thus remaining r is r mod mL.
I have calculated the number of while loop it takes to find the factors and it comes below or equal 5*N for all numbers. Trial division will take more.*</p>

My customer wants to be able to extend the functionality of the upcoming solution to include web clients but we need to have minute control of the communication so a simple web server is the solution.</p>

<p>Anyway, there are two symptoms and I can reproduce them both to 100% by running a bunch of unit tests. The problem comes when I upload a simple string to the server, using a ""POST"" command. It's not really something I will do in reality but I can't move ahead not understanding what's going on. I have a unit test that simply serializes the string ""Hello World!"", using a BinaryFomatter. I prefix the resulting byte array data with an integer indicating the length of the streamed data. A very simple protocol for sure but it works just fine in all other situations (larg object graphs mainly). I have two scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>Upload a very short string (""Hello World!"")</li>
<li>Upload a large string (a few thousand characters).</li>
</ol>

<p>When I run that unit test without first running any other unit tests this works as expected but whenever I run all my unit tests this one always fails in two different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>The short string doesn't seem to trigger the receiving socket to receiver it. More specifically, when I call Socket.BeginReceive() my callback is never called.</li>
<li>The long string does trigger reception as expected but the stream gets corrupted. The length prefix (4 byte, serialized Int32) contains a very large value. Certainly not the correct one.</li>
</ol>

<p>I might be drawinf the wrong conclusions here but I haven't seen any problems with streaming object graphs whereas doing the same with serialized strings is problematic. I can't understand why. I would appreciate any hints that could point me in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>It appears that the problem is caused by a previous test case and it has nothing to do with sending a string, which was my first suspicion. Is there a way data can ""linger"" between two successive uploads? The client socket is recreated for every upload though.</p>

<p>This is the client side of the upload:</p>

<pre><code>    private void upload(string documentName, object data, int timeout = -1)
    {
        // todo Handle errors
        WebClientEx client;
        using (client = new WebClientEx())
        {
            client.Timeout = timeout &lt; 0 ? UploadTimeout : timeout;
            try
            {
                var response = client.UploadData(
                    new Uri(ServerUri + ""/"" + documentName),
                    StreamedData.Wrap(data));
                // todo Handle response
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                throw new Exception(""Failed while uploading "" + data + ""."", ex);
            }
        }
        GC.Collect(); // &lt;-- this was just experimenting with getting rid of the client socket, for good measure. It has no effect on this problem though
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to create a game for my little sister. It is a Virtual Pet sort of thing and the Pet has toys to play with.</p>

<p>I created a class <code>Toy</code> and want to create a function, <code>getNewToy(name, data1, data2, data3, data4, data5)</code>.</p>

<p>I want this function to create a new instance of the class <code>Toy</code>, and I want the function to be able to be called multiple times each time creating a new instance.</p>

<p>In my experience you create an instance with:</p>

<pre><code>class Toy:
    def __init__(self, name, data1, data2, data3, data4, data5):
        pass

myToy = Toy(myToy, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>then to use methods from the class with:</p>

<pre><code>myToy.method1()
</code></pre>

<p>Seeing as I want to have the ability to have multiple toys, each with a <code>playWith()</code> method I want the instance to reflect the name of the <code>Toy</code> each time one is called.</p>

<p>I want the instance to be different each time I call the method <code>getNewToy(,...)</code> and the instance to reflect the name.</p>

<p>Remember I'm new to programming, so can you keep explanations simple.</p>

For this, I precalculate the ""fan-in"" of nodes and put them into the heap so that I can always retrieve the node with the smallest fan-in (0) from it.</p>

<p>After visiting a node, I reduce the fan-in of its successor by 1. Then obviously, the heap needs to be recalculated because the successor is now in the wrong place there. I have tried <code>recoverFromCorruption()</code>, but it doesn't do anything and keeps the heap in the wrong order (node with larger <code>fanIn</code> stays in front of smaller <code>fanIn</code>).</p>

<p>As a workaround, I'm now creating a new heap after each visit, amounting to a full O(N*log(N)) sort each time.</p>

<p>It should be possible, however, to make up-heap operations on the changed heap entry until it's in the right position in O(log(N)).</p>

<p>The API for <code>SplHeap</code> doesn't mention an up-heap (or deletion of an arbitrary element - it could then be re-added). Can I somehow derive a class from <code>SplHeap</code> to do this or do I have to create a pure PHP heap from scratch?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Code example:</p>

<pre><code>class VoteGraph {

        foreach($this-&gt;nodes as $n) {
            // omitted: filter loops
            $fnodes-&gt;insert($n);
        }

        // traversal from leaves to root
        while($fnodes-&gt;valid()) {
            $node = $fnodes-&gt;extract(); // fetch a leaf from the heap
            $successor = $this-&gt;nodes[$node-&gt;successor];
            // omitted: actual job of traversal
            $successor-&gt;fanIn--; // will need to fix heap (sift up successor) because of this

            //$fnodes-&gt;recoverFromCorruption(); // doesn't work for what I want
            // workaround: rebuild $fnodes from scratch
            $fixedHeap = new GraphNodeHeap();
            foreach($fnodes as $e)
                $fixedHeap-&gt;insert($e);
            $fnodes = $fixedHeap;
        }
    }
}

class GraphNodeHeap extends SplHeap {
    public function compare($a, $b) {
        if($a-&gt;fanIn === $b-&gt;fanIn)

I want to get the index values of all the objects in the list according to a search by name. This is the easy part. Along with the search by name, i want to further narrow the index results to only those objects whose ID property is not in an exclusion list of ID's to ignore. For ex:</p>

<pre><code>Exclusion List:
123
456
981

Main List of Objects
Object 1 with Name Property = Hi, ID = 123, Attendance = Present
Object 2 with Name Property = Ho, ID = 323, Attendance = Present
Object 3 with Name Property = He, ID = 456, Attendance = Present
</code></pre>

<p>The above are just representations of the data structures. Exclusion list is integer list and so is ID property etc. The result of my search on the Main List should return me the INDEX integer of the found object's location within the list. In this case Return should be an integer with value 1.</p>

$second_img_url = $(this).attr('data-second-img-url');
$third_img_url = $(this).attr('data-third-img-url');

$('.main_image').css(""background-image"", ""url('"" + $main_img_url + ""')"");
$('.second_image').css(""background-image"", ""url('"" + $second_img_url + ""')"");
$('.third_image').css(""background-image"", ""url('"" + $third_img_url + ""')"");

<li>I want to implement some BI processing on this data.</li>
<li>One way is deploy Spark on this Hadoop cluster and utilize the existing CPU/RAM resources for data processing. This works fine.</li>
<li>However I want to have different set to Spark Cluster(4 worker nodes) which fetches data from Hadoop lake (data size not more than 500GB), do the processing and display output from Spark cluster. Ocassionally, the processed data will be stored back in Hadoop lake. The reason for this is it gives me more control over my BI logic and doesn't interferes with existing Hadoop lake.

<p><strong>1. Using Outlook.Application ActiveX Object -</strong> It didn't work because its seems to work only with Outlook 2007, So meanwhile I left it out of the question.</p>

<p><strong>2. Using simple HTML with 'mailto:' -</strong> It is working fine to send simple Emails, but I have a problem that I'm not able to solve.</p>

<p>In Outlook I can send emails from a 'fake' address called '<em>Service Mail</em>' ( I just write it in the 'From' field ) so customers won't be able to reply to my emails. I want to do it also in my HTA page, but I think this option doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Is there any way doing it? Maybe by using an ActiveX Object for outlook 2003 and do it with that object?</p>

<p>Let's take the following Join query for example:</p>

<pre><code>var albums = db.Albums.FindAllByGenreId(1)
  .Select(
db.Albums.Title,
db.Albums.Genre.Name);
</code></pre>

<p>This query will be translated to:</p>

<pre><code>select 
 [dbo].[Albums].[Title],
 [dbo].[Genres].[Name] 
from [dbo].[Albums] 
   LEFT JOIN [dbo].[Genres] ON ([dbo].[Genres].[GenreId] = [dbo].[Albums].[GenreId]) 
WHERE [dbo].[Albums].[GenreId] = @p1
@p1 (Int32) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Let's assume that the 'Genres' table is a a table with thousands or even millions of rows. I think that it might be very inefficient to filter the data after the JOIN has taken place, which is what this query translated for in Simple.Date.</p>

<p>Would it be better to filter the data firs in the Generes table, which means create make a SELECT statement first and make the JOIN with that filtered table?</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be better to filter the data ahead of time?</p>

<p>Furthermore, is there an option to make that type of complex (JOIN on a filtered table) query using Simple.Data.</p>

<p>Need your answer to know if to proceed with Simple.Data, or damp it in favor of another micro-ORM.</p>

<p>They deliver spectral data from 400nm...700nm by 10nm using a D65 light source and 10° Observer.</p>

<p>I have the observer functions for ASTM D65 which work great and I can reproduce any value from the instrument 1:1, as long as i measure in D65, 10° (converting to XYZ and then CIELab using tristimulus references for perfect reflecting diffuser).</p>

<p>That was done mostly using algorithms from brucelindbloom.com and easyrgb.com, both have some great information!</p>

<p>Now I want to add the ability to convert the spectral data to another observer or another illuminant (or both). But I cant wrap my head around how to do that.</p>

<p>I guess some directions would be enough but I dont know if I would need even more references for that (references for illuminants by wavelength?) or if its done by some other means.</p>

<pre><code>$('.box').hover(function() {
        $(this).stop().addClass('active').animate({ 'margin-top': '-49px' }, 500);
    }, function() {
        $element = $(this);
        $(this).stop().animate({ 'margin-top': '0' }, 500, function() {
            $element.removeClass('active');
        });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that sometimes when the animation completes the class is not removed. This happens when I move too fast between divs.</p>

<p>You can view an example <a href=""http://strata-solar.onwired.com.php5-1.ord1-1.websitetestlink.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> in the slider section there are three boxes inside the slider that says 'City', 'House', and 'Business'.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>PS the same thing happens on the main navigation, sometimes the sub-nav just hangs there. Here is the code for the navigation:</p>

<pre><code>$('#navigation ul li').hover(function(){
        $(""a:eq(0)"", this).addClass(""hover"");
        $(this).find('ul:eq(0)').stop(true, true).slideToggle();
        }, function(){
            $(""a:eq(0)"", this).removeClass(""hover"");
            $(this).find('ul:eq(0)').stop(true, true).slideToggle();

My question is, how do I handle cases when a user logs in from multiple devices at once? The device who logged in first will not realize that their access token has expired, but will continue to try to send requests which will be denied (because the access token no longer matches the one stored in the database). I have thought about checking that the access token matches the database token in viewDidLoad in my AppDelegate, but this would only work when the app is first loaded. Is there best practice already established for this sort of thing? If so what is it?</p>

<p>The text file (input) looks like this:</p>

<p>Every column represents a specific value as so:</p>

<pre><code>[ID] [Length] [Frame] [X] [Y] [W] [H]

<p>So for an example, this line:</p>

<pre><code>2 108 1 561 1 20 28 1

<p>is actualy: <code>ID:2, Length:108, Frame:1, X:561, Y:1, W:20, Y:28</code></p>

<p>The last value <code>1</code> is not needed at all.</p>

<p>Now here is how i'm doing it so far:</p>

<pre><code>with open('1.txt') as fin:
    frame_rects = {}
    for row in (map(int, line.split()) for line in fin):
        id, frame, rect = row[0], row[2], row[3:7]

        first_data = ('{} {} {}\n'.format(frame, id, rect))
        print first_data

<p>this is the first step, but my expected output is as follows:</p>

<p>So for every frame, i append all of the ID's and their values that appear in that specific frame.</p>

<p>So in frame 1, id 2, 5 and 6 appeared each with its own values (x,y,w,h).</p>

<p>Every frame key is unique but can hold as many ID's + values as needed as long as they actually appeared in that frame.</p>

<p>I need to run this on text files that can potentially contain thousands of files. Every frame can hold ~20 different ID's. How will i be able to achieve that expected output?</p>

I keep reading my code but I don't get why it's not working. 
The program is using an <code>Entry</code> widget.
Basically the <code>search()</code> function handles a few exceptions (this part is working) and if you enter a valid file name, it jumps over to the <code>while</code> loop. 
The while loop reads every line and assigns the longest to <code>longest</code>. 
As soon as it reaches an empty line, the <code>elif</code> statement is executed (or should be).
It's supposed to display the longest sentence in the <code>Entry</code> widget.
The problem is nothings shows up in the entry widget in the end.</p>

<p>I'm using Python 3 on Windows.</p>

<p>Here is my code :</p>

<pre><code>from tkinter import *

def search(event):
    try:
        txtFile = open(str(entr.get()), 'r')
    except:
        entr.delete(0, END)
        entr.insert(0, ""File can't be found"")
    else:
        x = 0
        while 1:
            rd = txtFile.readline()
            if len(rd)&gt; x:
                longest = rd
                x = len(rd)
            elif rd == '':
                break
                txtFile.close()
                entr.delete(0, END)
                entr.insert(0, longest)

<p>I've read a <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/miah/archive/2008/02/17/sql-if-exists-update-else-insert.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">blog article</a> which uses the following:</p>

<p>the <code>SELECT CASE</code> seems to be the only way to use a <code>CASE-clause</code> in SQLite because everything else throws an syntax error.

<p>for which I am using Importance Sampling MC :
The theory says that an approximate PDF has to be used to compute the expected value (which will almost surely converge to the mean - value of the integral)</p>

<p>After plotting the given integral, and exponential PDF, based only on the plots, I chose the
 <code>rexp</code> and <code>dexp</code> to generate the PDF - and my code looks like this - </p>

<pre><code>#Without Importance Sampling
set.seed(1909)
X &lt;- runif(1000,0.01,1)
Y &lt;- X^(-0.5)

<p>Could someone please confirm if my line of thought is correct?
If wrong, how differently am I supposed to approach this? 
Please elucidate - I have understood the theory but implementation is proving to be problematic for me.</p>

<p>For integrals that are not so simple,</p>

<p>1.) <strong>f(x)</strong> = [1+sinh(2x)ln(x)]^-1 
I chose the <strong>normal PDF = g(x)</strong> (with mean = 0.5 and SD = 5) as approximate only after observing the plot. I wrote a code similar to the one for it , but it says NaN's produced in case of importance sampling. (this ideally means undefined function but I don't know how to solve this).</p>

<p>2.) <strong>f(x,y)</strong> = exp(-x^4 - y^4)</p>

<p>How do I choose the <strong>g(x,y)</strong> for the above function ? </p>

<p>Previously used for authentication by the head but I am proving the library ws-security.</p>

<p>What happens is that if I create the web client with netbeans and I run it just jumps me the following <strong>error</strong>: </p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException: An Error was discovered processing the &lt;wsse: Security&gt; header.
</code></pre>

<p>The client is written so:</p>

<pre><code>HelloWorldImplService serv = new HelloWorldImplService();
        HelloWorld port = serv.getHelloWorldImplPort();
        System.out.println("" *** "" + port.getHelloWorldAsString());
</code></pre>

<p>I built the program according to the resources found online, before adding ws-security running properly and that I may be missing.</p>

<p>The java code:</p>

<pre><code>public class App {

    static{
        System.loadLibrary(""demo"");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        System.out.println(System.getProperty(""java.library.path""));
        printHello(""Lars"");
    }

    native static void printHello(String name);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My C++ code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include ""demo.hpp""

void printHello(std::string name){
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello: ""&lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>My header:</p>

<pre><code>void printHello(std::string);
</code></pre>

<p>The .i file for SWIG:</p>

<pre><code>%module demo
%include ""std_string.i""
%{
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;
  #include &lt;string&gt;
  #include ""demo.hpp""
%}
  extern void printHello(std::string);
</code></pre>

<p>I ran swig -c++ -java demo.i no problems there. 
compiled with:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -c -fPIC demo_wrap.cxx -I/usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0/include/ -I/usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0/include/linux
</code></pre>

<p>And made a shared library and moved it to /usr/lib</p>

<pre><code>g++ -shared demo_wrap.o -o libdemo.so
</code></pre>

<p>But then I tried to run my java program using, eclipse and I got this error:</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: App.printHello(Ljava/lang/String;)V
    at App.printHello(Native Method)
    at App.main(App.java:11)
</code></pre>

<p>So from what I can tell, eclipse / java knows my library exist, but it can't find my function/method in the library. 
Is there something I have done wrong? or I am missing something?</p>

<p>Thanks it advance </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If the content of demoJNI.java might help</p>

<pre><code>public class demoJNI {
  public final static native void printHello(String jarg1);
}

I have an icecast 2 server with a few mountpoints.</p>

<p>Now I have one mountpoint for guests.
But every guest has the same user:pass login, whitch I set in the icecast config.</p>

<p>Is it possible to create a new user:pass login for a guest at runtime?
I think with a mysql database it is possible, but I found nothing for icecast.</p>

<p>Here a little example.
A guest ask me, if he could stream a session on my icecast stream.
I create a new user:pass for the guest mountpoint, send the credentials to this guest and he can stream.
But I don't need to restart the hole icecast server to make the new user:pass combi work.</p>

<p>My problem / concern is that SQL Server seems to kick off ALL of nested SELECTs simultaneously.  I'm wondering if there is any pattern that would be able to have the nested SELECTs run one after the other, to reduce the resource contention on the server.</p>

<p>What I <em>DON'T</em> want (and suspect is happening) is that all of the sub-SELECTs are running in parallel and most of them are having their output buffered (not sure how to prove this though).</p>

<p>The best I can come up with so far is an explicit temp table (or table valued variable) that would have the output from each one written to it independent, and then aggregate that, but that would result in many more rows being materialised than really need to be: I WANT the output to stream into the aggregation process that will effectively mean that not much intermediate storage will be required.</p>

<p>(The nested selects are actually quite complex self-joins, but which have been crafted to result in a merge join so that the minimum of intermediate results needs to be in memory or paged.)</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a better pattern for achieving this?</p>

What I understood after reading their docs , is that using HTTP will only allow uni directional message flow ( from the Server to the device ) , whereas using XMPP will allow bi directional flow of data. </p>

<p>There are several tutorials available , but they tell you how to use a  'send-to-sync' message (which is basically tells the device to check for new messages from my server). I believe this is not an efficient way to transfer small amounts of data (will consume more battery on the device, and more resources for my server as well)</p>

<p>I have read <a href=""https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/ccs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, but I dont know how to actually get xmpp working. Could anybody tell me how to set up xmpp for GCM , and how the data flow occurs  ?</p>

<p>Other tutorials have used jsp for getting xmpp running. I am not fluent with jsp. So can xmpp work alongside GCM on php ?  </p>

I'm saying if someone decides to just use static classes for a majority of their code, what performance gains does that give them? And what maintainability challenges does that represent?</p>

<p>I was reading an article today on how StackOverflow is able to be so fast using limited hardware: <a href=""http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/7/21/stackoverflow-update-560m-pageviews-a-month-25-servers-and-i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/7/21/stackoverflow-update-560m-pageviews-a-month-25-servers-and-i.html</a></p>

<p>One thing that caught my eye is that they employ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heavy usage of static classes and methods, for simplicity and better
  performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've read opinions <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1321352/why-choose-a-static-class-over-a-singleton-implementation"">here</a> and other places suggesting that Singletons and Static classes are ""evil"" -- that anything global is ""evil"". I've also learned that people who call things ""evil"" can be right in a situation -- but that they usually don't know what they're talking about.</p>

<p>So I'm turning to the community to understand this -- what advantages does StackExchange benefit from by using mostly static classes and methods? And what are the software maintainability or performance costs of their choices?</p>

<p>Some of these post types contain shortcodes, that I need to display. I have a primary Javascript file that makes Ajax requests to my PHP code in my plugin, which returns a JSON object containing the shortcode like this:</p>

<p><code>Object {shortcode: ""[embedyt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;height=300[/embedyt]""}</code></p>

<p>I'm then trying to display this shortcode on the front-end, since I'm dynamically building HTML blocks based on the JSON response. </p>

<p>However, when I try to output the shortcode to the page via the Javascript, it just displays as text, like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZxPW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here's my PHP code and Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>$packet = array();
$formatted_url = ""[embedyt]"" . $youtube_root . $video_id . ""&amp;height=300"" . ""[/embedyt]"";
$packet[""shortcode""] = do_shortcode($formatted_url);
echo json_encode($packet); // This sends a response back to the Ajax request
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: tlas_lazy_load.ajax_url,
        data: {
            action: 'tlas_lazy_load',
            post_type: post_type,
            posts_per_page: 6,
            paged: page
        },
        success: function(packet) {
            response = JSON.parse(packet);
            for(var i = 0; i &lt; response.length; i++) {
                build_lazy_load(""#lazy-load-row"", packet[i], i);
            }
        }
    });

function build_lazy_load(element, packet, index) {
    var block = """";
    block += ""&lt;div class=\""col-md-4\""&gt;"";
    block += ""  &lt;div class=\""video-individual\""&gt;"";
    block += ""      &lt;div class=\""panel panel-default\""&gt;"";
    block += ""          &lt;div class=\""panel-body\"" id="" + index + ""&gt;"";
    block +=                packet.shortcode;
    block += ""          &lt;\/div&gt;"";
    block += ""      &lt;\/div&gt;"";
    block += ""  &lt;\/div&gt;"";
    block += ""&lt;\/div&gt;"";
    $(element).append(block);
};
</code></pre>

<p>What gives me hope that this can be done is the answer to this question: </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16304706/wordpress-outputting-shortcode-with-javascript"">Wordpress: Outputting shortcode with Javascript?</a></p>

<p>And I'm following along with what that person suggested. However can this be done?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>So I can display the shortcode if I do this in enqueue scripts method:</p>

<pre><code>add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'tlas_lazy_load_enqueue_scripts' );
function tlas_lazy_load_enqueue_scripts() {
    wp_enqueue_script( 'tlas-lazy-load', plugins_url( 'js/tlas_lazy_load.js', __FILE__ ), array('jquery'), '1.0', true );
    wp_localize_script( 'tlas-lazy-load', 'tlas_lazy_load', array(
        'ajax_url' =&gt; admin_url( 'admin-ajax.php' )
        // BELOW
        'videos_shortcode' =&gt; do_shortcode(""[embedyt]"" . $youtube_root . $video_id . ""&amp;height=300"" . ""[/embedyt]"")
        ));
}
</code></pre>

<p>By setting it as a localized variable which my Javascript can access. The problem is that I have to add the shortcode after this function has already been declared. I tried localizing it later within the file in my above function by doing:</p>

<pre><code>...
$packet = array();
$formatted_url = ""[embedyt]"" . $youtube_root . $video_id . ""&amp;height=300"" . ""[/embedyt]"";
wp_localize_script( 'tlas-lazy-load', 'tlas_lazy_load', array(
    'videos_shortcode' =&gt; do_shortcode($formatted_url)
));
...
</code></pre>

<p>But this didn't work, it simply returned nothing. I'm on the right track (I think?) but I'm not sure how you can dynamically localize a script/Javascript variable.</p>

<p>The first purports to be the number of 100ns intervals or 'tics' between UTC 0001-01-01 00:00:00 (z yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss) and UTC 1970-01-02 00:00:00, and the second is the difference between the .NET epoch and the Java epoch in milliseconds.</p>

<p>A post <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15949938/convert-date-between-java-and-net-2-days-off"">here</a> reports a similar issue in the .NET world.</p>

<p>In the code below, I calculate the offset between the epochs and then compare to the published numbers:</p>

<pre><code>SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(""z yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"");
sdf.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(""UTC""));
Date date;
try {
  date = sdf.parse(""UTC 1970-01-01 00:00:00"");
} catch (ParseException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
  throw new RuntimeException(""Stupid java dates !"");
}
System.out.println(""Unix Epoch Date: "" + sdf.format(date));
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(TimeZone.getTimeZone(""UTC""));
cal.setTime(date);
System.out.println(""Unix Epoch Milliseconds: "" + cal.getTimeInMillis());
try {
  date = sdf.parse(""UTC 0001-01-01 00:00:00"");
} catch (ParseException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
  throw new RuntimeException(""Stupid java dates !"");
}
System.out.println(""Calculated DotNet Epoch Date: "" + sdf.format(date));
cal.setTime(date);
System.out.println(""Calculated DotNet Epoch Milliseconds: "" + cal.getTimeInMillis());
date = new Date(-62135596800000l);
System.out.println(""Published DotNet Epoch Date: "" + sdf.format(date));
cal.setTime(date);
System.out.println(""Published DotNet Epoch Milliseconds: "" + cal.getTimeInMillis());
</code></pre>

<p>which generates the output:</p>

<pre><code>Unix Epoch Date: UTC 1970-01-01 00:00:00

<p>3) Make them into separate commits, but do a double job.</p>

"26265560","1","","","2014-10-08 20:11:03","","2","970","<p>I'm trying to set up a live audio streaming system where a client will broadcast the audio from his microphone (accessed with getUserMedia) to one or more peers. 
To do so, chunks of the audio stream are sent through a WebSocket to a server, which will then relay this information to all the peers connected to the WebSocket. </p>

<p>My main problem comes from how to play chunks of data recieved by the peers on a website.</p>

<p>First, that's how I send the chunks of audio data on my client broadcasting JS script :</p>

<pre><code>var context = new AudioContext();
var audioStream = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
// Create a processor node of buffer size, with one input channel, and one output channel
var node = context.createScriptProcessor(2048, 1, 1);
// listen to the audio data, and record into the buffer
node.onaudioprocess = function(e){
        var inputData = e.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0);
        ws.send(JSON.stringify({sound: _arrayBufferToBase64(convertoFloat32ToInt16(inputData))}));
}
audioStream.connect(node);
node.connect(context.destination);
</code></pre>

<p>arrayBufferToBase64 and convertoFloat32ToInt16 are methods that I use to send respectively the stream in base64 format, and to convert the inputData to Int16, instead of that fancy Float32 representation (I used methods found on SO, supposed to work).</p>

<p>Then, after the data has gone through the WebSocket, I collect the data in another script, which will be executed on the website of each peer :</p>

<pre><code>var audioCtx = new AudioContext();
var arrayBuffer = _base64ToArrayBuffer(mediaJSON.sound);
audioCtx.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer, function(buffer) {
     playSound(buffer);
});
</code></pre>

<p>I also need to convert the base64 data recieved to an ArrayBuffer, which will then be decoded by decodedAudioData to produce an audioBuffer of type AudioBuffer. The playSound function is as simple as this :</p>

<pre><code>function playSound(arrBuff) {
    var src = audioCtx.createBufferSource();
    src.buffer = arrBuff;
    src.looping = false;
    src.connect(audioCtx.destination);
    src.start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But for some reasons, I can't get any sound to play on this script. I'm pretty sure the broadcasting script is correct, but not the ""listener"" script. Can anyone help me on this ? </p>

<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>My method of deploying to production is to generate scripts from local DB, including data and run that in production.  This creates all of the tables, including the EdmMetadata table and populates it with the hash.</p>

<p>Works:
Run script in a different 2008 R2 instance, change connection string for the Entity model to point to this production instance, run application.</p>

<p>Does not work:
Run script in a different 2005 instance, change connection string for the Entity model to point to this production instance, run application.  I get an error indicating the model has changed.</p>

<p>I think this doesn't work because the DB compatibility version is a part of the hash.  thus in production it generates a hash and compares it to the hash stored in the EdmMetadata table.  The new hash is different because it is generated against a 2005 DB.</p>

<p>I am guessing I would not have this problem if I was generating a 2005 DB locally and deploying that to a 2005 production instance.  However I don't have 2005 installed and would rather not require all the developers to have to install it, when 2008 supports a 2005 compatibility mode already.</p>

It must return all records from the database when called first, and it must also include all changes (add and remove) when called later. <code>SaveChanges</code> is only called when the user has finished editing things. The collection is needed before that! <code>SaveChanges</code> might also be called somewhere in between when the user is finished editing, but the code might return and the view be displayed again at a later time.</p>

When I simply drag any table involved in these FK connections into the DBML editor, so as to machine-generate the DBML file, these will all be represented as associations.</p>

<p>From here I'm able to make any changes to these associations: I might want the parent end of the association to be <code>internal</code> rather than <code>public</code> so that a JSON serializer (say) will not get caught in cyclic references; or in a connection between the tables <code>Form</code> and <code>FormAnswer</code>, I might want the child property to be called <code>Answers</code> rather than the machine generated <code>FormAnswers</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if the database design is changed, and I want to update the DBML to reflect this change, it seems these customizations would require me to track down every single change and update it manually (Add property, set it's source, source data type, C# data type...)</p>

<p>This can be a rather tedious process; what I'm asking is whether there is any way to automate this.</p>

<h2>1. Can I have these changes reflected on the SQL server?</h2>

<p>The ideal solution, it seems, would be if there was any way to make these specifications directly in the SQL Server database diagrams, so that a full re-generation of the DBML file (deleting everything and dragging it onto the DBML editor anew) would come up with the exact same result.</p>

<p>Suspecting that I would already know about the above, if it was achievable, I'd be happy to settle with:</p>

<h2>2. Can I extract these changes to a class of its own?</h2>

<p>Since all Linq to SQL entities are being generated as partial classes, I thought for a while that I might be able to create a new file, that I maintain manually, to which I could copy all changes as the ones mentioned.</p>

<p>So whenever I've changed an association, I would dig into the designer.cs code, cut the modified association, and paste it into my own file. Upon re-generation, I would expect compiler errors for any duplicates, and easily step through and remove these associations from the DBML. The problem here is that the associations seem to be only properties with attributes. If <code>Form</code> has a property called <code>Answers</code>, and the DBML generator will try to create a property called <code>FormAnswers</code>, the resulting <code>Form</code> object would simply have both properties, which is not at all what I want.</p>

<p>Has anybody had any luck with either of these solutions? Or if you know of any other way to deal with the problem, I'm open for suggestions.</p>

     *
     * @var string

<p>The table have these fields:</p>

<pre><code>user_id (int)
contact_id (int)

<p>these two fields represent the primary key.</p>

<p>In the <code>ContactsController</code> I have the function <code>store</code> in wich I create or update the database:</p>

<pre><code>public function store()
{

    switch (Input::get('type')){
        case 'make_contact_request':

            $user = User::where('email', '=', Input::get('login'));

            $request_self = new Contact;
            $request_contact = new Contact;

            $request_self-&gt;user_id = Auth::user()-&gt;id;

            $request_contact-&gt;contact_id = Auth::user()-&gt;id;
            $request_contact-&gt;status = 1;
            $request_contact-&gt;message = Input::get('message');

            $request_self-&gt;save();
            $request_contact-&gt;save();
            break;
        case 'answer_contact_request':

            $request_self = Contact::where('user_id', '=',Input::get('contact_id'))-&gt;where('contact_id', '=', Auth::user()-&gt;id)-&gt;first();
            //$request_self = Contact::whereRaw('user_id = '.Input::get('contact_id').' AND contact_id = '.Auth::user()-&gt;id.' ');
            $request_contact = Contact::whereRaw('user_id = '.Auth::user()-&gt;id.' AND contact_id = '.Input::get('contact_id').' ');

            $request_self-&gt;status = 3;
            $request_contact-&gt;status = 3;

            $request_self-&gt;save();
            $request_contact-&gt;save();
            break;
    }

<p>}</p>

<p>I tried two different ways to get the <code>Contact</code> Object for the <code>request_self</code> Object and I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>message: ""SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'id' in 'where clause' (SQL: update `contacts` set `status` = 3, `updated_at` = 2014-08-02 16:16:56 where `id` is null)""
</code></pre>

<p>for the <code>request_contact</code> Object it throws a fatal error (don't get the description) and close the session.</p>

<p>At the end I am at the beginning of laravel so I hope the solution is pretty easy to find :) but I dont even really know for what to search. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>At the end I fixed the Problem with the <code>update</code> function.</p>

<pre><code> case 'answer_contact_request':

            $request_self = Contact::where('user_id', '=',Input::get('contact_id'))-&gt;where('contact_id', '=', Auth::user()-&gt;id)-&gt;update(array('status' =&gt; 3));

<p></p>

<p>My question is if I know the value of the 'Card No' element, how can I get the XPath of the Update link? For example, If I know the Card No is ""5123 4567 8901 2346"", how can I get the XPath of the link element <code>""&lt;a href=""/admin?cpm_id=905""&gt;""</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update from comments</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm using an automation test tool
  called QTP. I need to get the XPath of
  the update link element to identify it
  on the webpage based on the value of
  the Credit Card number. What I'm after
  is to get the XPath such
  as""/html/body/table/tbody/tr[3]/td[1]/a"".
  However, this is the static path of
  the update link element. I would like
  to be able to get the XPath based on a
  Credit Card number.</p>

I would like to know why, in some cases, we need to include the parameter list of the function we're passing to another function while some other times, we just need to include the function name. I don't see the logic behind this.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>// In this case, I just need to include the 'function' name in the parameter list.
template &lt;class In, class Out, class T&gt;
Out transform(In begin, In end, Out dest, T function) {
    while (begin != end) {
        *dest++ = function(*begin++);        
    }

    return dest;
}

// In this case, 'predicate' requires a parameter list.
template &lt;class In, class Out&gt;
Out remove_copy_if(In begin, In end, Out dest, bool predicate(double x)) {
    while (begin != end) {
        if (!predicate(*begin)) {
            *dest++ = *begin;
        }

        ++begin;
    }

    return dest;
}

<p>Does it have something to do with the function's return type being template?

<p>I have an IList of objects that each have a ""start"" and a ""stop"" date. These date ranges can overlap. What I need to do is select which object is current for today's date. If there's an overlapping date then I need to select the one that has a start date closest to today's date which which the stop date hasn't passed.</p>

<p>I haven't used Linq much but I get the impression it might be ideal for this kind of task. </p>

<p>Can someone point me in the right direction as to how to get the result required?</p>

I just would like to have an <code>enum</code> which returns for all comparisons, regardless of other enums.</p>

<p>And this code works;</p>

public enum SomeRightEnum : uint

    CanDoNothing = 0,
    CanDoSomething = 1 &lt;&lt; 0,

<p>But at the  code above since it is uint we set the number of ""F""s, it wouldn't work if it was <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>This is my situation:</p>

<p>I am writing a timetabling display and printing program in HTML.  The user clicks various options such as room, dates etc.  An AJAX call is then made, to fetch the data and the timetable blocks are absolute positioned using Javascript.  The width of the timetable is more than the height of the timetable. So, I need to print in landscape, in order to maximise the size on the page.</p>

<p>Firstly, <code>@media print{@page {size: landscape}}</code> just plain doesn't work under any circumstance, I've tried.</p>

<p>This does sort of work:
<code>filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=1);</code>.</p>

<p>I've tried applying the CSS ImageTransform to either of the HTML or BODY elements, with differing results.</p>

<p>When applied to the HTML element, it seems as though the page is rendered as portrait (which is the default setting for users in my organisation), and then rotated by 90 degrees.  Clearly this doesn't help me.</p>

<p>When applied to the BODY element, everything works, <strong><em>except</em></strong> for elements that are either relative or absolute positioned (which still appear portrait). I can't abandon absolute positioning, without re-writing from scratch, which I don't have the luxury of.</p>

<p>What should I do?</p>

<p>Situation. I have a repeater with two elements showing on initial page load. Each element has a delete button, that removes that particular element from the database. When an element is deleted is should, obviously, be removed from the repeater list.</p>

<p>Problem. When an element is deleted I fetch the list from the database and sets the result as the data source of the repeater. Then I try to bind the data agian. If the result contains more than zero elements, then a null reference exception is thrown, and I can't figure out why (or what).
I've tried different approaches regarding when or if to DataBind and I've tried changing the Repeater to a DataList, without any luck. I've also tried setting EnableViewState to false on the Repeater/DataList.</p>

<p>Question. How do I update the repeater/data list when I have removed an element and why do I keep getting a null reference exception when I call DataBind the second time? The first time is when the page is loading.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Cython can't compile this, with the error <code>Buffer types only allowed as function local variables</code>.</p>

<p>The workaround I'm using is to declare the buffer attributes on a new local variable, assigned to the object member:</p>

<pre><code>cdef class Model:
  cdef np.ndarray A

  def sum(self):
    cdef int i, s=0, N=len(self.A)
    cdef np.ndarray[np.int_t, ndim=1] A = self.A
    for 0 &lt;= i &lt; N:
      s += A[i]
    return s
</code></pre>

<p>This becomes really annoying if you want to have multiple methods accessing the same data structures -- which seems like a pretty common use case, no?</p>

<p>Is there a better solution that doesn't require re-declaring the types inside every method?</p>
