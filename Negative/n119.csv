<p>When I try to use the class in a Linq to Entities query such as the one below:</p>

<pre><code>var q = from w in entities.Widgets
        select new Widget
        {
            Id = w.Id,
            WidgetName = w.WidgetName,
            WidgetDescription = w.WidgetDescription
        };


return q.ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following exception:</p>

<p>""The entity or complex type MyNamespace.Widget' cannot be constructed in a LINQ to Entities query"".</p>

<p>The only way around this is to use an anonymous type and then another LINQ query:</p>

<pre><code>var q = from w in entities.Widgets
        select new
        {
            Id = w.Id,
            WidgetName = w.WidgetName,
            WidgetDescription = w.WidgetDescription
        };

var r = from e in q.AsEnumerable()
        select new Widget
        {
            Id = e.Id,
            WidgetName = e.WidgetName,
            WidgetDescription = e.WidgetDescription
        };

return r.ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>This works but is pretty redundant.  I understand why I'm getting the exception, but is there a more elegant way around this?  </p>

<p>The fact that the POCO classes are generated by the ADO.NET C# POCO Entity Generator doesn't seem related to the issue; I tried using my own POCO classes and saw the same exception.</p>

<p>Then Itemsource set in codebehind.</p>

<p>Based on some logic however, I would like to set either a line or a item in one of the columns, e.g. a fruit to red, or the line to bold. I have code to work out which Fruit or Color I would like to differentiate (by color/bold) in the code behind, but I can't figure out, especially given the custom listbox display, how I could go about setting a particular item to a different color/bold.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>Let me know if any further code is required. Cheers.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> all I really want to be able to do is make the problem as easy as possible... loop through each item in the listbox and check with a string, if there is a match SOMEHOW visually distinguish this item in the listbox/listview. There is no need to make this any more complicated than it needs to be. Why you are not able to individually set an items foreground color is beyond me!</p>

<p><strong>edit 2:</strong></p>

<p>It looks like I almost get there with the following (but it throws exception and doesn't work)</p>

<pre><code>            foreach (var li in ListView.Items)

                if (someCriteria == true)

                      ((ListViewItem) li).Foreground = Brushes.Red; 
//exception throw as this is the actual object stored in this location (the Fruit object for example) not the row or listviewitem I want to change the color of so it can't be cast :(
                }

"12329896","1","12365571","","2012-09-08 10:23:43","","0","321","<p>In my PowerPoint 2010 Addin I subscribed to the <code>CommandBars.OnUpdate</code> event to register movement of shapes and similar events:</p>

<pre><code> ppt = Globals.ThisAddIn.Application;
 ppt.CommandBars.OnUpdate += CommandBars_OnUpdate;
</code></pre>

<p>This works great for some time. However, eventually the event stops being fired. Well, at least the registered event handler is not being called. I couldn't figure out, what causes this behaviour. It seems a bit indeterministic. No exception is thrown that would appear in the Debug output. It seems, this happens after some time and is not caused by a user action.</p>

<p>I assumed, this would be due to a change of the <code>CommandBars</code> object. So I added a timer, which checked for those changes. But both <code>==</code> and <code>.Equals()</code> comparisons to the last object result in a recognized change every tick, which is very unlikely.</p>

<p>I also tried to refresh the event handler periodically (every 1 minute), but this doesn't work either:</p>

<pre><code>ppt.CommandBars.OnUpdate -= CommandBars_OnUpdate;
ppt.CommandBars.OnUpdate += CommandBars_OnUpdate;
</code></pre>

<p>Does the event really stop after some time? Is there any other method to detect object movement, resize, deletion etc.?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>In the meanwhile I restructured the addin. I am now able to reproduce the problem. Here is how:</p>

<p>In the addin's ribbon I have a button, which calls the method <code>CreateRightEyeCopy()</code> on the ViewModel. In this method another method <code>GetNextPairId()</code> of the ViewModel is called. And this call seems problematic. I changed the <code>GetNextPairId()</code> to immediately return 0 to ensure that the method is the problem.</p>

<p>Here is the resulting stack trace in the <code>return 0</code> line:</p>

<pre><code>ViewModel.GetNextPairId()
[External Code]
ViewModel.CreateRightEyeCopy()
Button's event handler
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder, why there is external code in between my two functions. Can this code cause the <code>OnUpdate</code> event to stop?</p>

<p>If someone's interested, here is the code of the two functions:</p>

<p><code>CreateRightEyeCopy()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    var sel = ppt.ActiveWindow.Selection;
    if (sel.Type == PpSelectionType.ppSelectionShapes)
    {
        foreach (Shape s in sel.ShapeRange)
        {
            var pair = FindStereoPair(s);
            //Only add a new pair, if shape is not in a pair already
            if (pair == null)
            {
                // ** return; **
                int id = GetNextPairId(s.Parent);
                return; //for debugging purposes
            }
        }
    }
}
catch (Exception x)
{
    Debug.WriteLine(""Exception occured during creation of stereo pair: "" + x.Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>GetNextPairId()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>If I insert a return statement before the call to <code>GetNextPairId()</code>, then <code>OnUpdate</code> continues.</p>

<p>I also tried to invoke <code>CreateRightEyeCopy()</code> asynchronously, but that doesn't change anything.</p>

<p>Are there any further thoughts on this issue?</p>

"17666814","1","","","2013-07-16 01:58:16","","1","196","<p>I want to have two layers of authentication - I'll call them ""hard"" and ""soft"" authentication. The hard layer is the standard email-and-password layer. I've currently implemented this using <a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_secure_password"" rel=""nofollow"">has_secure_password</a> and the <a href=""https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">bcrypt-ruby gem</a> as described in this Railscast: <a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised"" rel=""nofollow"">#250 Authentication from Scratch (revised)</a>.</p>

<p>For the ""soft"" layer, I want each user to have a 4-digit PIN that they can use to verify their identity and switch them in as the active user. I would like this PIN to be encrypted just like the password.</p>

<p><strong>My question</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do I have these two layers of authentication using has_secure_password given that it has a ""password_digest"" column dependency (that doesn't seem customizable or expandable)?</strong> I would like to create a ""pin_digest"" column on the Users table, and just treat it like another password, but it seems has_secure_password doesn't support this.</p>

<p>I'm also curious if anyone has any suggestions for how I might actually implement this, or if it seems like a bad idea for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I trying to do this?</strong></p>

<p>I'm writing an app that's for a shared kiosk, and I want to make it as easy as possible for users to switch out without having to enter their full login credentials every time. This will be used in a retail store environment where people are moving quickly, and entering a full email address and password every time they switch could be cumbersome and slow.</p>

<p>I'm open to suggestions and approaches if anyone has any good ideas. :)</p>

<p><strong>What it looks like in practice</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A user logs in using ""hard"" authentication. </li>
<li>Once a user is logged in using ""hard"" authentication, other users can swap by simply selecting themselves from a list of users and entering their PIN. </li>
<li>Users can swap using their PIN as often as they like. </li>
<li>Once someone clicks the ""hard"" logout button, then all users are logged out and ""hard""
authentication must be used to log back in.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>An example</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Frank gets to work and logs in (using ""hard"" authentication - entering an email address and password) to a shared kiosk.  </li>
<li>Frank does some work on the kiosk. </li>
<li>Joe gets to work and also needs to use the kiosk. </li>
<li>Joe clicks his name on a list of users, then is prompted for his 4-digit PIN (""soft"" authentication), which he enters. </li>
<li>Frank is no longer the active user. </li>
<li>Joe is now the active user. </li>
<li>Joe does some work for a while before Frank needs to use the kiosk again.</li>
<li>Frank clicks his name from a list of users, then is prompted for his 4-digit PIN, which he enters. </li>
<li>When Frank is done, he clicks the ""Log out"" button. The next person who wants to use the kiosk must log in using ""hard"" authentication.</li>

<li>Buffer size: I know that we need to consider a limited size of bytes to get the bytes from peer. I read many articles but my problem not solved, I have a very simple but worthless approach to cope with this, putting a character at the end of each message; then the receiver can understand when message is fully received. but I have another problem which prevents me from performing this approach further to another problems it has for me. </li>
</ol>

<p>Let me explain my problem by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public void Send(byte[] message, Socket connection)
{
    connection.BeginSend(message, 
                         0, 
                         message.Length, 
                         SocketFlags.None, 
                         new AsyncCallback(OnSend), 
                         connection);
}

<p>and on OnSend method, I just use <strong>connection.EndSend(result)</strong> where result is IAsyncResult. but when I then call Send method twice like the following code, OnReceive call back will receive both of them as a one single message.</p>

<pre><code>Send(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(""Hello""));
Send(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(""Bye""));
</code></pre>

<p>my OnReceiveMethod will use <strong>Console.WriteLine(message);</strong> where message is the string received from peer. and the output using sync way must be </p>

<p><em>Hello</em></p>

<p><em>Bye</em></p>

<p>but in async way I receive it as a one message not two, so it is printed</p>

<p><em>HelloBye</em></p>

<p>Yesterday I made a post <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25701340/vba-key-already-associated-with-collection"">here</a> because I was having trouble with a 'Key already associated with collection' error where I was fortunate to receive a reply. Using the solution provided the code ran without any error but eventually failed to respond, but because the amount of data(some 31,000 rows) I wrongly assumed this was the cause.</p>

<p>Having looked at this again and created a test file <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/9pldsyxoxcvibah/Extract%20Test%20Home%20070914%20V4.xls?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, I've realised the problem is with the line of code I was kindly provided with in my initial post.</p>

<p>So in my code, the initial line which I received the error on is this:<br>
<code>ColDates.Add m, ws.Cells(StartRow - 1, i).Text</code> and the re- worked line is this:
<code>ColDates.Add m, ws.Cells(StartRow - 1, i).Text &amp; CStr(m)</code></p>

<p>I just wondered whether someone may be able to look at this please and offer some guidance on how I can overcome the initial error whilst looping correctly through all the values and sheets.</p>

<p>Many thanks and kind regards</p>

           result = classify(mail['body'].encode('ascii','ignore'), vectorizer, logreg)
           out.write(u'%s\t%s\n' % (f, result))

<p>In an html page, display a top bar followed by another html page included dynamically on to the lower part of the page (for which I've used an Iframe). So, scroll bars for the window as such should not come up. Instead, a scroll bar for the included page should come up. I could do this using an <code>overflow: hidden</code> property on the body of the page.</p>

<p>But now, inorder to achieve this, i had to set the height of the iframe to 100% so that the page looks seamless. The problem with this is that the lower div which conatins the iframe flows out of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of parent and since I've given an <code>overflow:hidden</code> to the body, it cuts off the last bit of every included page. How do I overcome this?</p>

It is mistaken being thought of upcasting the subtype Tobj to the supertype T, otherwise performing upcast at run-time directly contradicts the principle of polymorphism.</p>

<p>Thanks for your pointing out <code>dynamic_cast</code> doesn't do the job. Corrected.</p>

<p>To sovle the 2nd-half problem, it seems to have no choice but implement the overrider on the final subclass of the diamond hierarchy below,</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>All of the above at this point works, there is no issue other than I need to take some time reading the documentation a little more to try and get a bit of a better understanding and be able to digest it all.</p>

<p>My question (which has been bugging me for a few days now) is how to correctly get and set the sub properties. For example, take a look at this screenshot (modified for purpose) of the Delphi Object Inspector:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/If7mB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Just like the procedures shown before, I need the same thing to happen for those sub properties I highlighted in blue.</p>

<p>Ideally what I would like is a function where I can pass a component and a property name, and return True if it has sub properties, so something like:</p>

<pre><code>function HasSubProperty(Component: TComponent; APropName: string): Boolean;
begin
  Result := ??
end;
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure how well this would work though as evident from the screenshot, some sub properties also have sub properties (such as Component>Font>Style).</p>

<p>Ultimately what I would like is a way of retrieving the names, values and types of sub properties. So something like:</p>

<pre><code>procedure GetComponentSubPropertyNames(Component: TComponent; APropName: string;
  OutList: TStrings);
begin
  //
end;
</code></pre>

<p>When called:</p>

<pre><code>GetComponentSubPropertyNames(Label1, Anchors);
</code></pre>

<p>Should retrieve:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>akLeft</li>
  <li>akTop</li>
  <li>akRight</li>
  <li>akBottom</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>With similar procedures to get the values and types would look like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>akLeft | True | Boolean</li>
  <li>akTop | True | Boolean</li>
  <li>akRight | True | Boolean</li>
  <li>akBottom | True | Boolean</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For the Font sub properties, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Charset | DEFAULT_CHARSET | TFontCharset </li>
  <li>Color | clWindowText | TColor</li>
  <li>Height | -11 | Integer</li>
  <li>Orientation | 0 | Integer</li>
  <li>Pitch | fpDefault | TFontPitch</li>
  <li>Quality | fqDefault | TFontQuality</li>
  <li>Size | 8 | Integer</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Accessing another sub property (Font.Style) then poses yet another problem, unless a procedure like so is used:</p>

<pre><code>procedure GetComponentSubPropertySubPropertyNames(Component: TComponent; APropName, ASubPropName: string; OutList: TStrings);
begin
  //
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This then becomes rather silly.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Basically I need a way of digging into deeper level properties to get the names, values and types of them, put them in a list, and also be able to change the values.</p>

<p>I would appreciate it if someone could write some code samples of how I can achieve this (bonus with some comments in the code). I am sure for some this will be a relatively easy task but I am finding it very trivial indeed.</p>

<p>Having read various documentation and examples so far still leaves me rather clueless to be honest, the main concern is not knowing what types to use or how to correctly create and manage them.</p>

"22978890","1","","","2014-04-10 04:50:32","","1","40","<p>I am a beginner.  This question is regarding what is construed from the following link regarding local value resolution of dependency property </p>

<p><a href=""http://wpftutorial.net/DependencyProperties.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wpftutorial.net/DependencyProperties.html</a></p>

<p>It is explained in the ""The magic behind it"" section within the webpage pointed to by this link that local value, if exists, is resolved by using a key against a dictionary which lives as a static dictionary within the control.  A key in the dictionary is unique per type (e.g., button).  Please correct me if I am wrong, but to my understanding, there are two dictionaries, one with the key and the ""metadata that contain callbacks and a default value"" and another with the key and the value of the property.</p>

<p>For the sake of better explaining my question, let's assume then that we have WPF application with two buttons and the Dependency Property in question is ""Background"". In that case, if both of those buttons have two different backgrounds which are set as local value, we should end up with one Key/value in the first dictionary (key and metadata), and two key/value in the second dictionary (where the background values are stored).  And here comes my question, if the key ""must be unique per type"", then how could we get in the second dictionary two different keys, each of which with distinct background value, corresponding to the two buttons ?  That is, don't both buttons have the same key as the key is unique per type (i.e., both buttons have the same type)?</p>

<p>Can someone tell me where is the confusion ?</p>

<p>However, the datagridview does not shrink / stretch as per the rows of data grow. I have tried to hardcode dataGridQuestion.MinRowHeight = 100 however that is not what I looking for as the Textblock in the datagrid column may varied. </p>

<p>Question :
How to avoid the grey area which was shown in the pic as below after the last row of the datagrid row? I tested using dataGridQuestion.MinRowHeight = dataGridQuestion.Height / DataEntityList.Count but it still there..</p>

<p>How to make Datagrid to shrink and expand as rows of data bound decrease / increase? </p>

What I would like to have is a single, global variable that tracks whether or not there is a person logged into the application. In the past with C++, what I've done is declared a variable in my ""main"" function file and then re-declared it in my other files as <strong><em>extern</em></strong>. I've tried this with Objective-C, but I'm running into memory management issues when debugging with Leaks. Here is the code I'm trying to use.</p>

<p><em><strong>main</em> file</strong></p>

<pre><code>#import ""clsPerson.h""

clsPerson *LoggedInPerson = nil;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
//...main code...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[App]_Prefix.pch*</strong> - Prefix file</p>

<pre><code>...
#import ""clsPerson.h""
extern clsPerson *LoggedInPerson;
...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Login code</strong> - Login View Controller (Modal popup on top of Root)</p>

<p>I should mention here also, that it currently checks to see if the variable is <strong><em>nil</em></strong>. If it is, then it forces you to login. In order to use nil, I believe I have to alloc and dealloc rather than reusing the same memory address?</p>

<pre><code>...
LoggedInPerson = [[clsPerson alloc] initWithJSON:(NSDictionary*)Network.JsonValues];
[LoggedInPerson retain]; //I don't really know if this is needed?

//Save this person into the default settings for next time
[LoggedInPerson saveUserInfo];
[[self parentViewController] dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Logout code</strong> - Root View Controller</p>

<pre><code>...
- (void)btnLogoutTapped {
    [LoggedInPerson dealloc]; //There is only one object, so I tried to force it to dealloc fully
    LoggedInPerson = nil;
    [clsPerson ClearUserInfo];
    ...
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work fine and doesn't produce any errors, but watching the app with Leaks shows that my allocation statement is leaking memory somewhere. It typically happens if I logout, force a ""low memory warning"", and then login again. Are there any glaring problems here? I'm still getting my grips around memory management, but I think I'm pretty close. Thanks for any help in advance!</p>

<p>I want to test that all the components work together but with a fake HTTP response, so I am creating a stub for the request/http interactions.</p>

<p>I am using Chai, Sinon and Sinon-Chai and Mocha as the test runner.</p>

<p>Here's the test code:</p>

<pre><code>var chai = require(""chai""),
    should = chai.should(),
    sinon = require(""sinon""),
    sinonChai = require(""sinon-chai""),

chai.use(sinonChai);

describe(""product service"", function () {

        .stub(request, ""get"")
        // change the text of product name to cause test failure.
        .yields(null, null, JSON.stringify({ products: [{ name : ""product name"" }] }));
        done();
    });

    after(function(done){

    it(""should call product route and return expected resonse"", function (done) {

        writeSpy = sinon.spy(response, ""write"");

        route.getProducts(null, response);

<p>If the argument written to the response (response.write) matches the test passes ok. The issue is that when the test fails the failure message is:</p>

<p>""Error: timeout of 2000ms exceeded""</p>

<p>I've referenced <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16607039/in-mocha-testing-while-calling-asynchronous-function-how-to-avoid-the-timeout-er"">this answer</a>, however it doesn't resolve the problem.</p>

I have this first class (Object3D) which is the Parent class</p>

            Object3D(){};
            virtual ~Object3D(){};

    virtual void PrintObj(double) = 0;
//etc..
    private:
//..
    };
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see , I have the PrintObj() method that is overridden. Some objects take no arguments , like in this child class </p>

<pre><code>class Cube : public Object3D
{
    public:
    Cube(unsigned char c):Object3D(c){};
       ~Cube(){};
    void PrintObj();
    private:
     //..
     };
</code></pre>

<p>And Other classes require an argument for their call to the PrintObj method</p>

<pre><code>class Teapot : public Object3D
    {
    public:
        Teapot(unsigned char c):Object3D(c){};
        ~Teapot(){};
        void PrintObj(double s){//Code};
    private:
    //..
    };
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that these two classes are automatically Abstract they inherit pure virtual methods from the parent class.</p>

<p>I've thought about redefining the PrintObj(double) in the cube class and the PrintObj() class in the Teapot class , but this will allow the user to call the 'wrong' PrintObj() method.</p>

<p>EDIT : I will explain a little bit more what i mean by ""calling the wrong"" PrintObj();</p>

<p>In the main function I have declared this cube dynamically :</p>

<pre><code>Object3D *C = new Cube(250);
</code></pre>

<p>and this teapot too , dynamically :</p>

<pre><code>Object3D *T= new Teapot(250);
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I change my classes this way :</p>

<pre><code>class Cube : public Object3D
{
    public:
        Cube(unsigned char c):Object3D(c){};
       ~Cube(){};
        void PrintObj();
    private:
        void PrintObj(double){};// i add this method here in private
};
</code></pre>

<p>and For the Teapot :</p>

<pre><code>class Teapot : public Object3D
{
        public:
        Teapot(unsigned char c):Object3D(c){};
        ~Teapot(){};
        void PrintObj(double s){};

        private:
        void PrintObj(){};//i add this method here in private
};
</code></pre>

<p>following these changes , in the main function i still can do these calls :</p>

<pre><code>C-&gt;PrintObj(0);//A cube should be called with no arguments
T-&gt;PrintObj();//a teapot should be called only with arguments

<p>The problem is that when the window size is 960px or smaller, there is a horizontal scroll that allows to scroll till the end of yellow div(but should be just till the end of the text). In this implementation horizontal scroll appears when a viewpoint reaches a yellow div, but it should only show up when it reaches the text. It seems to me that the negative right-margin is ignored. </p>

<p>Any ideas how to fix horizontal scroll behaviour?</p>

<p>The user runs the client, enters the IP and port for the server, presses 'connect', and then once connected they can enter text into a textbox and send it to the server.</p>

<p>The server simply displays either ""No connection"" or ""Connection from [ip]:[port]"", and the most recent received message underneath.</p>

<p>The server successfully receives messages, and even handles the client disconnect fine.
Now I'm trying to make it listen again after the client has disconnected but for some reason nothing I try will allow it to start listening again.</p>

<p>Here is part of my code:</p>

<pre><code>    Socket socket;
    private void listen()
    {
        socket = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork,
            SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
        socket.Bind(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 12345));
        socket.Listen(10);
        socket.BeginAccept(new AsyncCallback(acceptAsync), socket);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>    private void receiveAsync(IAsyncResult res)
    {
        Socket socket = (Socket)res.AsyncState;

        try
        {

            if (nBytes &gt; 0)
            {
                Invoke(new MethodInvoker(delegate()
                {
                    lMessage.Text = encoder.GetString(buffer);
                }));
                setupReceiveAsync(socket);
            }
            else

                    lMessage.Text = ""No Messages."";

<p>The last line: listen(); is what throws the error.
I have tried simply calling socket.BeginAccept() again, but that also throws an exception.</p>

<p>The message I'm getting is:</p>

  <p>Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I don't call my listen() function and instead just call socket.BeginAccept(), then I get ""You must first call socket.listen()""</p>

<p>If I call the socket.listen() function, then it tells me it's already connected and cart start listening.</p>

<p><strong>Question #1)</strong>
What can I do to ensure that the thread is exited when the object that references it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>Note: Helper only needs to call foo, so once it no longer needs to call foo, the object can be garbage collected. So, incorporating a using statement with Helper is certainly a possibility.</p>

<p><strong>Question #2)</strong>
Does _messageQueue need to be disposed? If so, how do I dispose of it without it affecting the LogMessage thread? (I tried disposing of it while the thread was running and <em>no surprise</em> got an error)</p>

<p>I tried extending IDisposable (in MessageFileLogger):</p>

<pre><code>public void Dispose()
{
   _enabled = false;
   _messageQueue.Dispose();
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I haven't had any issues with this but I'm not confident that I just haven't had an issue yet. Also, would this mean that Helper also needs to IDisposable and a using statement needs to be used with Helper?</p>

<p>I am migrating an installer for an ActiveX control from Per-Machine to Per-User. I did this by programming the installer write to <code>HKCU\Software\Classes</code> instead of <code>HKLM\Software\Classes</code>.  </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>On my machine (Windows 7 with UAC Enabled), the ActiveX control successfully loads.  On the other windows 7 test machines (one with UAC enabled, one with UAC disabled), the control 'partially' loads.</p>

<p><strong>What is Partially?</strong></p>

<p>When a user visits a page with the ActiveX control, Internet Explorer displays a warning message in a yellow bar on the top of the window. If you click the 'Run add-on' button in the bar, the control becomes visible and begins to run, but Javascript code that tries to access properties of the control return the error:
<code>Library not registered</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Differences between machines</strong></p>

<p>On the dev machine reads from <code>HKCR\CLSID\&lt;GUID&gt;</code> succeed while on the test machines these reads fail.  Reads from HKCU succeed on both dev and test machines.  Reads from HKLM fail on both test and dev machines. (I collected reads using Sysinternals Process Monitor) Strangely, the keys that Internet Explorer fails to read are clearly visible if I use regedit to view <code>HKCR\CLSID\&lt;GUID&gt;</code> on the test machines.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What can I do to get the per-user control to load on the test machines? What could cause this difference between the dev machine and the test machines?  Why can I see the key in HKCR with RegEdit but Internet Explorer cannot see the key? </p>

After testing on multiple platforms and browsers, I've found very few issues bar one glaring one.</p>

<p>On standard browsers, mobiles and other platforms, zooming in on the page scales the text appropriately away from the Vertical Div, allowing for my text to be viewed without any problems. Users can scroll to see the rest of the content, and no overlapping occurs.</p>

<p>However, on iPhones, it seems that the content shifts when zooming in, as if not registering that there is a padding from the left of the screen to keep the text where it should be. So, when zoomed out, everything is fine.</p>

The more I try to investigate, the less I understand what the problem could be. </p>

<p>I'm requesting your help to find a solution so that my programs are no longer blocked, or, as a default, at least some strong clues that would explain why it might be the case.
There are already many topics about that on the web. However, most of them give only superficial answers: they just explain how anti-virus works with signatures and detection euristics, or state that you juste have to add the offending aplication in the white list without asking any other question. While it is certainly correct, it's not acceptable answers in my sens, because I'm still left with my own programs that refuse to work without any concrete idea to start investigating.</p>

<p>First of all, the only anti-virus that blocks my programs is avaste 7.x. No other anti-virus see any inconvenient to run my software. Secondly, I haven't avaste lyself; it is installed on a friend's machine.
I have windows 7, he has windows XP. I'm completely sure that the problem is avaste only: when it is temporarily disabled, or if the program is added to its white list, everything works nicely as expected.</p>

<p>Three different programs are in trouble :</p>

<ul>
<li>A text editor, with the goal to replace windows notepad while keeping simple, efficient and customizable</li>
<li>A small amateur audio player very simple to use</li>
<li>The client program of an online game platform, currently having more than 1000 users</li>
</ul>

<p>The first one is open source, I can give a link to the executable and the source code if needed. The two others are closed source but free to use, I can give a link to the executable of the current version only.
the only obvious common things between these three programs are me as a developper, my windows 7 machine that compiled them, the compiler familiy which is MinGW/GCC, and they are all win32 GUI applications without any framework (no MFC, no WPF, no QT, WXWidgets or whatever; just pure win32/C GUI applications)</p>

<p>Here are my observations and though so far :</p>

<ul>
<li>Versions 1.1, 1.2.1 and 1.3 of my text editor are blocked. They are in C not C++, have been compiled with GCC 3.4.5 in unicode mode, and are distributed in portable zip files (by portable, I simply mean no installer and no installation needed)</li>
<li>Version 1.4.1 of the same text editor isn't blocked. It has been compiled with GCC 4.7.2, still in C and not C++, still in unicode mode, and still as a portable zip file</li>
<li>All versions of my audio player are blocked; they are in C++ with 0x features enabled, have been compiled by GCC 4.7.2 in ANSI mode, distributed in portable zip file</li>
<li>The current version of my game, 1.7.2, isn't blocked. it is in C, has been compiled with GCC 3.4.5 in ANSI mode, and is distributed as an inno-setup 5 installer.</li>
<li>The new version of my game, 2.0.0, which is currently a private beta, is blocked. It is in C++ with 0x features enabled, has been compiled with GCC 4.7.2 in unicode mode. I share it with my private beta-testing team as zip files within a private dropbox folder</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is caused by avaste 7.x auto-sandbox. The following happens when one try to start a program disliked by avaste :</p>

<ol>
<li>The user double-click or hit enter on the executable</li>
<li>The program starts but is allmost instantaneously and forcibliy crashed by avaste</li>
<li>A pop-up appears and says something like: avaste has put this program into his sandbox because his reputation is low</li>
<li>IF one click on the continue button of the pop-up, the execution of the program is restarted and works normally</li>
<li>If one don't click on the continue button, windows explorer freezes, the executable remain in the task manager and invariably use 76 KB of RAM while being impossible to kill; finally after about 5 minutes, windows explorer unfreezes, the program is restarted and works normally</li>
</ol>

<p>This is unacceptable. newby users of my program, especially the game, don't know how anti-virus works; don't know how to put it into the white list and why it will unblock it; don't know how to change settings of their anti-virus; if they see the pop-up, wont understand it and will end up being afraid or disappointed because they can't play without knowing why; and if they don't see the pop-up, I can't expect them to wait 5 minutes with a half-freezing computer. each time they want to play.</p>

<p>From there, I made the following deductions :</p>

<ul>
<li>My machine isn't itself infected and no virus is injected into the executables I distribute; otherwise, all recent programs would be blocked; I have two which are (my player and the new version of my game), while one is not (the latest version of my text editor). The 1.7.2 of the game has been compiled in march 2012, while the 1.4.1 of the text editor is from october 2012.</li>
<li>The newest version of GCC 4.7.2 is not in cause, by the same reasonning; same for ANSI vs unicode compiling.</li>
<li>The minGW C++ runtime, distributed as a auto-linked DLL, mandatory in all C++ applications compiled with GCC 4.7.2, is probably not the cause, because many well known programs use it; and my text editor is blocked and is in C, and thus don't use it.</li>
<li>My audio player and my game have the audio library in common; this later is not the cause, because the version 1.7.2 of my game works and the newest private beta not. And of course, that audio library is also used in many other known or less known applications that aren't blocked.</li>
<li>Both the player and the game access the network using winsock; so by the same reasonning, it's not the cause either</li>
<li>IF it really were the reputation thing of avaste, why the version 1.4.1 of my text editor, which is not blocked, has only been downloaded around 70 times, while the version 1.3 which is blocked has been downloaded more than 300 times ? IT looks completely illogical. Is 70 users sufficient to claim something about reputation ? Is it more with 300 users ? I really don't think so... probably a critical mass of a dozend thousends users is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionnaly to that, I also though that the fact I'm distributing my programs as portable zip files may be a reason for avaste to block, and conversely, the fact that a program is well installed in program files may be a reason to trust it more. 
So I made a simple experience: I compiled a new inno-setup 5 installer for the beta 2.0.0 of my game, as well as one for the version 1.3 of my text editor, and discover that the installers themselves were blocked !</p>

<p>I made another experience with my friend, where I tried to find exactly the place where the programs crash, based on using MessageBeep (MessageBox is also blocked !). I didn't noticed anything probant. The game is blocked when SetDlgItemText is called for the first time in the login dialog box, but if I remove all SetDlgItemText it is blocked further down. IN the text editor, it is blocked while populating the menu bar...</p>

<p>My conclusion is, there is something that avaste don't like in the new version of my game, in the old versions of my text editor, and in my audio player. Something that is absent in the newest version of my text editor. What could it be ? Do you have any clue ? Do you have only an idea on how I could proceed to find what it is so that I can hope to fix it ? Is there only a way to analyse such a problem, or is the hole world screwed by avaste ?</p>

<p>Note that I'm a single person and not a company, all those programs are free to use, I have not pay any IDE to develop them, and I'm not paid by the users when they use them, so I assume that a certificate is probably not affordable at all. Moreover, I don't know if it's a true solution, how to sign an application compiled with GCC, and I really don't want to switch to an ""usine à gaz"" like MSVC. I would prefer strongly forget that option if there is any other solution, even a very dirty one.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>This Works for me with the statement below, but I don't think a CROSS JOIN is the best approach for large record sets. When using the statement in web controls, it becomes pretty slow, even with only 1000 records. Is there a better way to accomplish this?  </p>

<pre><code> SELECT     Shop_Products.*, Shop_Products_Egenskaber_Overruling.*
 FROM       Shop_Products CROSS JOIN
            Shop_Products_Egenskaber_Overruling
 WHERE      Shop_Products.ProductNum = Shop_Products_Egenskaber_Overruling.ProductNum
</code></pre>

<p>Any optimizing suggestions?</p>

"18029431","1","18051068","","2013-08-03 05:00:31","","3","2003","<p>I have an IntentService that uploads a file. Everything works fine, but I'm a little confused about how to handle the notifications. When I start the notification I use <code>startForeground()</code> because the files can be rather large and I don't want the upload to get killed unless absolutely necessary. When I use <code>startForeground()</code> it displays two notifications in the notification area (one under Ongoing and one under Notifications):</p>

<p><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7339/9427369672_c00f449fdc.jpg"" alt=""Example:""></p>

<p>I've read through a number of different Stack Overflow posts and web articles, but none of them answer the question I have...hopefully I haven't missed one that talks about ths.</p>

<p>It's my understanding that the ongoing notification in the image above (the one without the progress bar) is put there since this is running in the foreground (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html#Foreground"" rel=""nofollow"">Services documentation</a>). That's all well and good if you ask me, and I understand why. However, I don't need two notifications displayed and I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't want two notifications cluttering up the notification area either. I would like to know how to properly handle the notification so that only one displays and doesn't clutter up the notification area.</p>

<p>The only way I've been able to get around this is if I set the integer ID for <code>startForeground (int id, Notification notification)</code> (<code>ONGOING_NOTIFICATION_ID</code> in my code below) to zero. However, the documentation I quote above says:</p>

<p><code>Caution: The integer ID you give to startForeground() must not be 0</code></p>

<p>Setting it to 0 disables the Ongoing notification and then just shows the regular notification with the progress bar. I figure I could kind of ""fix"" this by setting  <code>.setOngoing(true)</code> until it's done uploading the file and then setting <code>.setOngoing(false)</code> once it's finished, so it can be dismissed. I'm not sure exactly how ""Cautious"" one has to be with setting the integer ID to 0. To me it kind of seems like a lazy way to be able to get around the issue I'm having, but I don't know if there are other consequences for setting it to 0. Also, this only works if I only have one notification that I'm dealing with. If I have multiple, different notifications, then I'll need different IDs for each one and this won't work. <strong>Update</strong>: It looks like <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/105051985738280261832/posts/MTinJWdNL8t"" rel=""nofollow"">setting the ID to 0 won't work in Android 4.3</a>, so now I'm back to square one.</p>

<p>What is a valid way to get around displaying both notifications?</p>

<p><strong>Update/Solution:</strong> Duh, taking some time off and then coming back to this and double-checking what I had done based on @dsandler 's recommendation helped me figure out what I was doing wrong. I wasn't setting the correct ID when I was doing the progress update, so that's why it was creating two notifications and one wasn't getting updated. Using the same ID (ONGOING_NOTIFICATION_ID) for all the notifications solved the issue for me. See the code below for the additional pieces I hadn't included before and where I had made the mistake.</p>

<p>Relevant code from UploadFile.java:
</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public class UploadFile extends IntentService {

    private static final int ONGOING_NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;

    @Override
    protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
        mNotifyManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
        mBuilder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this);
        mBuilder.setContentTitle(getText(R.string.upload))
            .setContentText(""0% "" + getText(R.string.upload_in_progress))
            .setSmallIcon(android.R.drawable.stat_sys_upload);

        startForeground(ONGOING_NOTIFICATION_ID, mBuilder.build());


....

    if (progress &gt; 0){
        percent = (Long.valueOf(progress) * 100) / totalSize;
        mBuilder.setProgress(100, percent.intValue(), false);
        mBuilder.setContentText(percent.intValue() + ""% "" + getText(R.string.upload_in_progress));
        mNotifyManager.notify(ONGOING_NOTIFICATION_ID, mBuilder.build()); // &lt;-- My problem was that I had set the ID here to 0 and did not make it the same as the ID I set above
    }                       

....

}

<p>When I scroll down to reveal the new (or reused rather) cells, the everything works as expected (cells that met the condition and are suppose to be hidden are hidden, vice versa). It also works as expected when I scroll back up to reveal the first batch of cells again.</p>

<p>I have a table, styled with jQuery mobile (Responsive table). This table is dynamically filled with a <code>.append</code>. The columns don't have a fixed width, they vary.
 Is there a way, to fix the header of the table, so that I am able to scroll through the table body with the header always showing at the top, but without the use of multiple tables.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>I would like to have a single table with a fixed header. </p>

<p>I'm amazed that there is no standard for this, as I assume that this is something most webdevs can use. Please, correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>If the below code is run 
(i know the cData sections are not visible in the preview, something causes it to be ignored).</p>

<p>The result does not represent the data correctly.
1. Flex ignores missing date 24 aug for DECKER.

<p>Scenario 1: dataProvider updated, but selectedIndex is the same.

<p>Scenario 2: dataProvider updated, selectedIndex is also updated.

Select Air from list: [ listSelectedItem=Air, listSelectedIndex=2 ].

<p>Seems to me that selectedItem is driven by selectedIndex.  selectedItem updates only when selectedIndex updates.  Shouldn't selectedItem be updated when dataProvider is updated?  Is binding to selectedItem flawed?</p>

<p>I've tried to generate a parser for that with JavaCC, but it looks as if compiler-compilers like JavaCC were only suitable for highly structured code (typical for general-purpose programming languages), not for messy Latex-like markup.

<p>So my question is, what's the easiest way to parse input that is mostly unstructured, with only a few Latex-like commands in between?</p>

<p>The interface is designed to add/remove Cities/Stores/Employees, so the TreeView has to update to reflect any changes.</p>

<p>I am wondering on the correct way to get the TreeView to display the tree structure, and receive updates when it changes.</p>

<p>I am thinking that the Company object should have events, such as company.CityAdded and company.CityRemoved, then whatever wrapper I put round the TreeView responds to those events? When the TreeView has been built up, there will be a node per city/store/employee. Each node could then respond to events of the node it represents in the tree.</p>

Reading through most of that on Stackoverflow makes me think I've set this up correctly:</p>

<pre><code>class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :categorizations
  has_many :categories, :through =&gt; :categorizations
end

class Category &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :categorizations
  has_many :products, :through =&gt; :categorizations
end

class Categorization &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :product
  belongs_to :category
end
</code></pre>

<p>And my migration. I've seen several ways to go about this, and this way seems valid:</p>

<pre><code>class CreateCategorizations &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :categorizations, :id =&gt; false do |t|
      t.references :product
      t.references :category
    end
    add_index :categorizations, [:category_id, :product_id], :unique =&gt; true
  end
end

<pre><code>class CategoriesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def show
    @category = Category.find(params[:id])
    @products = Product.where(:category =&gt; @category)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If I simply do <code>@category.products</code>, everything is fine, and I get an array/collection of a number of products included in that category. But I don't want an array. If I try to use <code>where</code> I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid - PG::UndefinedColumn: ERROR:  column products.category does not exist
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a more complex joins statement I should make to get an AR relation of products in a certain category? I'm sure it should work the way I'm attempting but obviously I've gone wrong somewhere.</p>

<p>I have a base class that has event handling in it. My console application is running my workflow. Part of that workflow is to raise events at specific intervals in a separate thread to broadcast the workers' current state (a heartbeat I have heard many call it).</p>

<p>I also have another program in the same solution that is a windows form that I want it to be able to listen to what is going on in the console application so that it can display the worker states. I have tried running both at the same time and verified the events are triggering, but the monitor is not finding any of the raised events.</p>

<p>I am fearing that there is no way to do this, and I will need to go to a database logging method or something else... but in the off chance someone knew how to communicate between applications with event (or event-style) logic, I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Currently the applications are running from the same location. The goal is that the monitor application will eventually be attached with a broadcaster for our network so that our workstations can monitor for certain worker states without being logged into the machine and the main monitor will show us the full status of all the workers.</p>

Once it has timed out, it has always been locked into the time-out, until the procedure is recompiled using drop/create or sp_recompile from a Management Studio session.</p>

<p>While it is timing out, there is no time-out using the same parameters for the same procedure using Management Studio.</p>

<p>Doing an ""ALTER PROCEDURE"" through Management Studio and (fairly drastically) changing the internal execution of the procedure did NOT clear the time out - it wouldn't clear until a full sp_recompile was run.</p>

<p>The stored procedure ends with <code>OPTION (RECOMPILE)</code></p>

<p>The procedure calls two functions, which are used ubiquitously throughout the rest of the product.  The other procedures which use these functions (in similar ways) all work, even during a period where the procedure in question is timing out.</p>

<p>Now the solutions i have seen, they have an element in their Xaml called ClipToBounds Which makes the canvas adjust to the border but it is not present for SilverLight. so is there a way i can have this feature or an alternative so that the Canvas clips correctly to the Border?

<p>P.S i know i can set the canvas to transparent and the border background to the background i want the canvas to take, but am still learning windows phone so am trying to know as much solutions as possible in case that always doesn't work. Thank you</p>

<li>Before the HTML is rendered to the screen, PHP makes a stored procedure call based on the <code>id</code> they selected.</li>
<li>The values that the stored procedures returns will prefill the ""profession_type[]"" form field.</li>
<li>I would like the <code>&lt;option value='accountants' selected&gt;Accountants&lt;/option&gt;</code> if the stored procedure returns ""Accountants"" for the value of ""profession_type"" based on the id.</li>

<p>Most of the queries are of the form:</p>

String query = ""select dbms_xmlgen.xmlget('select c1, c2 from t1 where c1 = ''""
    + somevalue + ""'' ') xml from dual;"";

<p>I can't parameterize that as is, since the actual select is in a quoted string inside xmlget and parameters are not expanded inside a string. JDBC will see that query as having no parameters.</p>

<p>I've been fairly successful in emulating the behavior of <code>dbms_xmlgen.xmlget</code> with:</p>

<p>The only issue I have not been able to resolve is the case where the query returns no rows.</p>

<p>With <code>dbms_xmlgen.xmlget</code>, no rows returns an empty CLOB. But, with <code>sys_xmlagg</code>, no rows results in a CLOB consisting of:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;&lt;ROWSET&gt;&lt;/ROWSET&gt;

<p>I have a Silverlight Page that loads Usercontrol by setting the Content to a Frame Element.</p>

<pre><code>UserControl1 uc1 = new UserControl1();
this.Frame.Content = uc1;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly I have a Frame in each UserControl  where the content is set to a Frame.</p>

<p>This works well and good.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
I have the current situation</p>

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|UserControl1 | UserControl2 | UserControl3  <br/>

</p>

<p>So now what I'm trying to achieve is that when the user opens UserControl2 from UserControl1, i need to be able to move back from UserControl2 to the parent(UserControl1) <strong>in the same state it was before</strong>.</p>

<p>Is this actually possible? If yes then what should be done?
Any Hints, code, Article references are appreciated...</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong></p>

<p>I'm trying to avoid passing variables in page query and use usercontrols.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>

<p>For instance if the user wrote ""Hello World"" in a Textbox inside UserControl1 and presses a button,load  UserControl2. After he presses OK in UserControl2 go back to UserControl1 with the Textbox still showing ""Hello World""</p>

<p>Hope I'm clear. Let me know if any clarification is needed.</p>

<p>The hierarchical roles in the system would be along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>superuser/admin -&gt; group owner -&gt; group user
</code></pre>

<p>A real world example of this system would be: ""I'm a school administrator, I have teachers I manage, and they all have classes that contain students"".</p>

<p>I'm thinking along the lines of a UNIX model, except one admin's data silo cannot overlap with another admin's. In the example above, one school should never have access to the data of another one.</p>

<ul>
<li>An admin role would have full superuser powers over every group and user under him.</li>
<li>A group owner would only have access to the group itself and the users under it.</li>
<li>There can be multiple admins for one silo of data, multiple group owners per group etc.</li>
<li>Admins / group owners / users will generally not change <em>what they can do</em>, as in they abilities will pretty much fixed. The thing that will change is <em>what pieces of data they can act upon</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm absolutely certain there have to be a few general patterns out there that I can start with and develop a custom authorization system around it that's fine-tuned to my system's needs. There's ACL, there are libraries along the lines of Rails' CanCan and I'm sure many more.</p>

<p>I'd love to know what my options are and what some of the trade-offs would be. Resources, readings, articles, books would be all great. It's likely I'll have to implement a Parse.com-like API for this web application (i.e. API clients can write custom queries as JSON maps and those will be translated to SQL on the backend) and it'll be extremely important to prevent unauthorized access in all sorts of different query variations.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>P.S. Just to clarify, I'm not actually on Rails, the stack I'm using has no existing libraries for authorization, hence I need to roll my own.</p>

<p>Why the child 'required attribute' from one child is required for other child? 
Why entity framework merge all data anotations to base classe 'Person' if the base class is non requided attributes?</p>

<p>I´ve used the same classes on MVC to create required fields on cshtml , and it works. The mvc understands only requered field from one child and not make any 'wrong merge' with those two childs.</p>

<p>like this sample:</p>

<pre><code>//EF Codefirst Class

    [Key]

    public virtual string phone{ get; set; }
    [StringLength(500)]
    public virtual string address{ get; set; }
    [StringLength(500)]
    public virtual string manager{ get; set; }
    [StringLength(500)]
    public virtual string Discriminator{ get; set; }
}
//My Inherited classes
public class Employee : Person

    public override string phone{ get; set; }

    public override string manager{ get; set; }
} 
public class Manager: Person
{
    [Required]
    public override string name{ get; set; }
    [Required]
    public override string email{ get; set; }
}
//And my sample function 'Add PersonManager' 
 private void  InsertPerson()
 {
    using (var ctx = new MyDataContext())
    {
        try
        {
            var m = new Manager() ;
            m.name = ""my name"" ;
            m.email = ""my@email.com"";
            m.address ="" something"";

            ctx.Person.Add(m);        

            ctx.SaveChanges();  
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
         // Why,  if I try to Add my Person 'Manager', the attribute : phone and manager is REQUIRED?

The first one might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM item WHERE arg1=false

<p>The string (""sqlWhere"") for the arg(s) looks like this:
""arg1=?""</p>

<p>The string for the arg(s)-Array (args) at index 0 looks like this:
""false""</p>

<p>This works fine. I've got 715 results.</p>

<p>It'll not fail. BUT. I'm using selectionargs. I've read, that they should AVOID this situation. But they don't. Even, If I put into the selectionargs for arg3 = ""\""+""false""+""\"""" or arg3 = ""\'+""false""+""\'"" or even arg3=""'""+""false""+""'"" it won't work. Maybe an android specific problem? 
The value ""false"" comes from a list of values. It is initialized with an emty string. </p>

I've been using <code>com.mongodb.util.JSON.parse(querystring)</code> to read the query, which worked fine until I started reading queries that contained operators like $max and $min.  At that point, rather than using mongodb's $max operator, the parser instead creates a ""$max"" field.  For instance,</p>

<p>the input string:</p>

<pre><code>{ $query : { state : ""AL"" } , $max : { pop : 9058 } }
</code></pre>

<p>is parsed to the DBObject:</p>

<pre><code>{ ""$query"" : { ""state"" : ""AL""} , ""$max"" : { ""pop"" : 9058}}
</code></pre>

<p>When I then look for a DBCursor with that query document, I get a cursor of size 0 (no matching document found in the databse), presumably because there are no documents with ""$query"" or ""$max"" fields.</p>

<p>Is there something I can use besides <code>JSON.parse()</code>?  I'm not averse to writing my own function for it, but how can I get a DBObject that recognizes the $ operators as operators and not fields?</p>

<p><strong>I mean :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User clicks buttonA (which ultimately performs actionA)</li>
<li>I want to launch the modal, wait for the input (either of the 2 buttons - yes/no) and/or pass it to some checking routine before performing(or not) actionA</li>
</ul>

<p>This my HTML code for the modal (should the buttons be - somehow - acting via their <code>onclick</code> javascript routines?) - also note that <code>#confirmMessage</code> is going to be variable.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""modal fade hide"" id=""confirmAlert""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""modal-header""&gt;
        &lt;button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""modal""&gt;x&lt;/button&gt;

<p><strong>Just an idea:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Write a function like <code>checkBeforeExec(message,functionToExec)</code></li>
<li>Set <code>#confirmMessage</code> to message and Yes' href to <code>javascript:functionToExec</code></li>
<li>Makes sense?</li>
</ul>

"26553371","1","","","2014-10-24 17:44:01","","0","162","<p>My app (minimum iOS 7) uses a UIPrintInteractionController to set up an Airprint operation. The printer selection screen presents and dismisses just fine, but I have a separate screen that enables the user to select which paper size. I want the print controller to <em>only</em> go through with the task if the paper size the user wants is in the list the printer controller supports (something we get in the delegate method <code>-printInteractionController:choosePaper:</code>--which is called after the user hits the Print button).</p>

<p>The problem is, if I dismiss the print controller, that doesn't stop the airprint operation from happening, and the print controller doesn't seem to have any ""cancel"" methods.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can cancel an Airprint operation programmatically?</p>

<p>Here's my delegate method:</p>

<pre><code>- (UIPrintPaper *)printInteractionController:(UIPrintInteractionController *)printInteractionController choosePaper:(NSArray *)paperList
{
    CGSize targetSize = [self sizeForPrintAspectSize:self.printImageSize];
    DLog(@""target size is %f,%f"", targetSize.width, targetSize.height);
    // Out of the entire list of papers, we want to pick one that equals the target size.

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; paperList.count; i++) {
        UIPrintPaper* paper = [paperList objectAtIndex:i];
        DLog(@""list paper size: %f,%f"",paper.paperSize.width, paper.paperSize.height);
        if (paper.paperSize.width == targetSize.width &amp;&amp;
            paper.paperSize.height == targetSize.height) {
            DLog(@""chosen: %f,%f"", paper.paperSize.width, paper.paperSize.height);
            return paper;
        }
    }

    // didn't find it, so cancel the operation and alert the user
    [printInteractionController dismissAnimated:YES];
    UserAlert(@""Invalid Paper Size"", @""It appears your printer does not support that paper size. Please choose another one"");

    return nil;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I tried setting the controller's <code>showsPaperSelectionForLoadedPapers</code> to YES, but nothing changed with the UI (I didn't get a paper selection screen). Not sure what the expected behavior is here but it certainly didn't happen.<br>
<strong>Update 2:</strong> Oh, right. This from the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Uikit/reference/UIPrintInteractionController_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIPrintInteractionController/showsPaperSelectionForLoadedPapers"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On printers where only one paper type is available, no paper selection menu is displayed, regardless of the value of this property.</p>

<p>And now i would like to store those values in the according localizable.strings files.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Localizable.strings (English) should then contain:</p>

<p>In testing code, I'd like to ensure it isn't too many (I'm not talking about memory leaks, I know how to check that). To this end, I thought I could count every object used and check the maximum used during the run on the test data. Then, I would compare the obtained number to some guess about how many objects the library should use.</p>

<p>However, I've got problems implementing this. I thought about two possible ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>intercept <code>Package::new</code> and <code>Package::DESTROY</code>. However, this has a little catch that in that package, <code>new</code> doesn't always return a new object. Sometimes, it uses a preexisting one (the objects are used as immutables, so it shouldn't matter much). So I'd have to track each individual object to see if it existed before.</p></li>
<li><p>intercept <code>Package::bless</code> and <code>Package::DESTROY</code>. This should work, but seems a little unorthodox.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The question is, which of those ways is more likely to succeed (maybe what is commonly used in similar situations), and secondly, how would I even implement the second way (would I have to override <code>Package::bless</code> for all packages in question or only base classes etc.).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please be aware that
  boost::lexical_cast is much slower as
  atoi. I also use it very often in a
  performance non-critical code. The
  problem with lexical_cast is that it
  uses stringstream for conversion. If
  you are working in a multi-threaded
  environement any stream class from the
  standard lib will use locks on a mutex
  for every character being inserted,
  even if the stream object is used from
  a single thread.Your number consisting
  of 17 chars will involve 17 mutex
  locks when put into stream. – ovanes
  Jun 22 at 11:59</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which begs the question, when do <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> objects lock a mutex? Is this true for objects from <code>&lt;sstream&gt;</code> as well? If so can this be prevented?</p>

So basically (if I am understanding it correctly), the <code>promise</code> says ""I'll have a value ready for you to pickup"" and the <code>future</code> picks it up when it is ready.</p>

<p>I've run into a situation where I feel it would be better for the caller to provide some kind of output buffer with a flag, and have the responding thread fill the buffer, then set the flag. So this is no longer future/promise, but something inverted, where the <code>future</code> says ""deliver this value to me"" and the <code>promise</code> leaves a notification when it has done so.</p>

Now I wanted to add a popup-menu to that notification icon. Unfortunately I do not receive any events from it. That's what I'm doing currently to create the icon and its event handler:</p>

<p>First create an invisible window to use it's event handler</p>

<pre><code>ZeroMemory(&amp;wc,sizeof(WNDCLASSEX));
wc.cbSize=sizeof(WNDCLASSEX);
wc.lpfnWndProc=WndProc;
wc.hInstance=hInstance;
wc.lpszClassName=L""myCL"";
RegisterClassEx(&amp;wc);

hWnd=CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE,L""myCL"",L""myWN"",WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,CW_USEDEFAULT,
                    CW_USEDEFAULT,1,1,NULL,NULL,hInstance,NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>Next create and show the icon itself:</p>

<pre><code>ZeroMemory(&amp;niData,sizeof(NOTIFYICONDATA));
niData.cbSize=sizeof(NOTIFYICONDATA);
niData.uID=IDI_AAAA; // the icon's identifier
niData.uFlags=NIF_ICON|NIF_MESSAGE|NIF_TIP;
niData.hIcon=(HICON)LoadImage(hInstance,MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDI_AAAA),IMAGE_ICON,
                              GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSMICON),GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYSMICON),
                              LR_DEFAULTCOLOR);
niData.hWnd=hWnd;
niData.uCallbackMessage=MY_TRAY_ICON_MESSAGE;
Shell_NotifyIcon(NIM_ADD,&amp;niData);
</code></pre>

<p>And the event handler that is assigned to the invisible window and where I would have assumed the events from the icon should arrive too:</p>

<pre><code>LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hwnd,UINT msg,WPARAM wParam,LPARAM lParam)
{
   switch(msg)
   {
      case WM_CLOSE:
         DestroyWindow(hwnd);
         break;
      case WM_DESTROY:
         PostQuitMessage(0);
         break;
      case MY_TRAY_ICON_MESSAGE: // this should be related to notification icon but is never called
         switch (lParam)
         {
            case WM_LBUTTONDOWN:
            case WM_RBUTTONDOWN:
            case WM_CONTEXTMENU:
               break;
         }
         break;
      default:
         return DefWindowProc(hwnd,msg,wParam,lParam);
   }
   return 0;
}

Beyond the fact that the code is pretty well ""spaghettified"" I did run into an issue where I'm not sure how to optimize properly.  </p>

<p>The below snippet is not an exact replication, but should detail the question fairly well.</p>

<p>He is taking one <code>DataTable</code> from an Excel spreasheet and placing rows into a consistantly formatted DataTable which later updates the database.  This seems logical to me, however, the way he is copying data seems convoluted, and is a royal pain to modify, maintain or add new formats.</p>

<p>Here is what I'm seeing:</p>

<pre><code>private void VendorFormatOne() 
{
    //dtSumbit is declared with it's column schema elsewhere
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; dtFromExcelFile.Rows.Count; i++)
    {
        dtSubmit.Rows.Add(i);
        dtSubmit.Rows[i][""reference_no""] = dtFromExcelFile.Rows[i][""VENDOR REF""];
        dtSubmit.Rows[i][""customer_name""] = dtFromExcelFile.Rows[i][""END USER ID""];
        //etc etc etc
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To me this is completely overkill for mapping columns to a different schema, but I can't think of a way to do this more gracefully.  In the actual solution, there are about 20 of these methods, all using different formats from <code>dtFromExcelFile</code> and the column list is much longer.  The column schema of <code>dtSubmit</code> remains the same across the board.  </p>

<p>I am looking for a way to avoid having to manually map these columns every time the company needs to load a new file from a vendor.  Is there a way to do this more efficiently?  I'm sure I'm overlooking something here, but did not find any relevant answers on SO or elsewhere.  </p>

<p>P.S - I Wasn't sure if this should go on codereview or here, please let me know if it would better suited there and I will remove/repost.</p>

<p>Why not using format provider? because I'm working in a code generation environment and specifying second parameter for <code>ToString</code> wouldn't be possible.</p>

<p>At the same time we wan't to keep the method <code>.ToString()</code> so creating another method using extension method is not acceptable.</p>

<p>The root view controller is a UISplitViewController with:</p>

<li>1 ->UINavigationController -> ...other ViewControllers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DETAIL: a UINavigationController -> a DetailViewControler</li>
</ul>

<p>With this hierarchy the segue showDetail from last viewcontroller in master to the Navigation Controller in Detail doesn't work because the Detail is presented Modally in a Collapsed environment instead of presenting it with a push.
I think this behavior comes from the Tab Bar Controller because it isn't a Container like a UINavigationController. In fact if i remove the tab bar and set a navigation as Master of Split View Controller it works like usual.</p>

<p>What can i do for using a tab bar like Master of Split View Controller and get the right behavior of showDetail segue in a collapsed environment?</p>

<p>P.S.: for right behavior i mean pushing the Detail in the Master Navigation Controller in a horizontal compact environment (iPhone 6 plus Portrait).       </p>

<p>I wanted to change the call, so that instead of:</p>

<pre><code>QMessageBox.information(self, ""Empty Field"", ""Please enter a name and address."")
</code></pre>

<p>I write keyword arguments, so that I know which of the parameters stand for which content, so that, when I read it in a year, I immediately know what it is about. So I tried:</p>

<pre><code>QMessageBox.information(parent=self, title=""Empty Field"", message=""Please enter a name and address."")
</code></pre>

<p>Which at execution time gives me the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""SimpleExample.py"", line 39, in submitContact
QMessageBox.information(parent=self, title=""Empty Field"", message=""Please enter a name and address."")
TypeError: QMessageBox.information(QWidget, str, str, QMessageBox.StandardButtons buttons=QMessageBox.Ok, QMessageBox.StandardButton defaultButton=QMessageBox.NoButton): 'message' is not a valid keyword argument
</code></pre>

<p>So my guesses were wrong, but how do I figure out the real method signature?
I searched for a while and found this function:</p>

<pre><code>from inspect import getcallargs
getcallargs()
</code></pre>

<p>I tried using it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from inspect import getcallargs
&gt;&gt;&gt; from PyQt5.QtWidgets import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; from PyQt5.QtCore import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; getcallargs(QMessageBox.information(), a=1, b=2)
</code></pre>

<p>but that also doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: QMessageBox.information(QWidget, str, str, QMessageBox.StandardButtons buttons=QMessageBox.Ok, QMessageBox.StandardButton defaultButton=QMessageBox.NoButton): not enough arguments
</code></pre>

<p>And no matter how many arguments I add (function 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, ...) it's never enough arguments. If it's talking about the arguments of information(), then how am I supposed to find the right amount of arguments of the very function I want to get the arguments for?!</p>

<p>So I thought ""Ok lets try and see if I can find the method in the Qt5 docs."" but of course, there I am only redirected to the c++ documentation for Qt5 and that one doesn't list a function ""information()"" for QMessageBox, so I still don't know the names of the keywords.</p>

<p>How can I figure out these names?</p>

<p>Demo (lets say this was generated):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" id=""meta_title"" name=""seo_meta_title""&gt; 
&lt;input type=""text"" id=""meta_description"" name=""seo_meta_description""&gt; 
&lt;input type=""text"" id=""header"" name=""header""&gt; 

&lt;!-- Submit form--&gt;
  &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Create""&gt;

&lt;!-- buttons--&gt;
  &lt;button onclick=""save()""&gt;save&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button onclick=""load()""&gt;load&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>because i don't know the input ids, i can't just write:</p>

<pre><code>function save() {
  if (typeof(Storage) != ""undefined"") {

    //some_code_to_insert_value = x, y, z 

    localStorage.setItem(""meta_title"", x);
    localStorage.setItem(""meta_description"", y);
    localStorage.setItem(""header"", z);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And same goes for the load function</p>

<pre><code>// LOAD
function load() {
if (typeof(Storage) != ""undefined"") {
   // Adds data back into form fields 

   document.getElementById(""meta_title"").value = localStorage.getItem(""meta_title"");
   document.getElementById(""meta_description"").value = localStorage.getItem(""meta_description"");
   document.getElementById(""header"").value = localStorage.getItem(""header"");

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm very new to JavaScript as i'm sure you can tell any help, code or links would be much appreciated and a working js fiddle would be beyond amazing (as long as it doesn't rely on pre knowing the input id etc..) i have spent a few hours trying to do this and wasted even more time trying generate the JS needed with PHP in till i was told this was a terrible way to do it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time. Really hope this makes sense, thanks</p>

Following ""The Busy Coder's guide to Android Development"" I have created a DatabaseHelper class that extends <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code>.</p>

<p>One of my use cases is to run a query against the database and display the results on a <code>ListView</code> within a <code>Fragment</code> (I use fragments from the support library).</p>

<p>From what I understand, using <code>managedQuery()</code> is not really appropriate and even if it were it isn't recommended due to the fact that some of the logic encapsulated inside this method is actually executed on the main thread, specifically <code>reQuery()</code> which to my understanding is performed when the <code>Activity</code> is restarted.</p>

<p>So I've been trying to get acquainted with the <code>Loader</code> class for the first time, only to see this: </p>

<p><code>""The only supplied concrete implementation of a Loader is CursorLoader, and that is only for use with a ContentProvider""</code></p>

<p>My initial thought was to implement my own content provider and perhaps prevent other apps from getting access to it, then I read the following in the <code>ContentProvider</code> documentation via developer.android.com:</p>

<p><code>""You don't need a provider to use an SQLite database if the use is entirely within your own application.""</code></p>

<p>I've also been playing with this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-loaderex"">https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-loaderex</a></p>

<p>Yet I am not familiar with this project, and not sure if it can be used on a production environment.</p>

<p>So, right now all I can think of is creating a bunch of <code>AsyncTask</code> instances within my <code>Fragment</code> and manage their lifecycle appropriately, make sure they're cancelled whenever needed and whatnot.</p>

<p>Are there any other options?</p>

I am able to successfully load a different view controller each time the corresponding button is pressed.  </p>

<p>If I set Height- then fine, I get what I want and a scroll bar... but this won't dynamically size if the user maximises the entire window. So how can I tell it to fill the size of the groupbox it is in without overflowing and give me a scroll bar (vertical).</p>

What i have done is a save function that saves the canvas that surrounds everything.</p>

<p>Then i am trying to create a load function that opens that txt file and updates the canvas with the data from that file.</p>

<p>But my problem is that it do not update the existing canvas but instedd ad a new one so i have 2.</p>

<p>my question is how do i fix my load function so it do not add a new canvas but only adds the saved canvas children.</p>

<p>Right now my load function locks like this:</p>

<pre><code>        if (userClickedOK == true)
        {
            StreamReader sR = new StreamReader(dlg.FileName);
            string text = sR.ReadToEnd();
            sR.Close();

            StringReader stringReader = new StringReader(text);
            XmlReader xmlReader = XmlReader.Create(stringReader);

            Canvas canvas1 = (Canvas)System.Windows.Markup.XamlReader.Load(xmlReader);

            parentWindow.canvas.Children.Clear(); // clear the existing children
            parentWindow.grid.Children.Add(canvas1);
</code></pre>

<p>Eddit: new code:</p>

<pre><code>        if (userClickedOK == true)
        {
            StreamReader sR = new StreamReader(dlg.FileName);
            string text = sR.ReadToEnd();
            sR.Close();

            XmlReader xmlReader = XmlReader.Create(stringReader);

            parentWindow.canvas = (Canvas)System.Windows.Markup.XamlReader.Load(xmlReader);

<p>Now i start the app again,everything works fine,except the widget stops receiving the broadcasts even though that same broadcasts is being received by another activity when it is supposed to.</p>

<p>Also strangely the widget is able to send broadcasts (it is only unable to receive  it)
so it seems like the broadcastreceivers  are  not being  registered again(only for the widget).How can i register it again??I really have to use system.exit(),not using it is screwing up other things  :(</p>

<p>This is the what i am calling in ondestroy() </p>

<pre><code>if(ma.boolMusicPlaying1==false)
        {
            getActivity().getApplicationContext().stopService(new Intent(this.getActivity(), Music_service.class));

<p>So my guess is if i can register the widget through java file my problem would be solved.So  can i register the widget through a java file??</p>

<p>in other words what is the java code for </p>

</ul>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Thanks for the quick answers, the problem was that the Date object was initially today, which happened to be July 31.  When the month was set to June, before I changed the day, it was temporarily <strong>June 31</strong>, which got rolled forward to July 1.</p>

<p>I've since found the following to be a cleaner implementation, as it sets all the date attributes at once:</p>

<pre><code>function parseISO8601(timestamp)
{
  var regex = new RegExp(""^([\\d]{4})-([\\d]{2})-([\\d]{2})T([\\d]{2}):([\\d]{2}):([\\d]{2})([\\+\\-])([\\d]{2}):([\\d]{2})$"");
  var matches = regex.exec(timestamp);
  if(matches != null)
  {
    var offset = parseInt(matches[8], 10) * 60 + parseInt(matches[9], 10);
    if(matches[7] == ""-"")
      offset = -offset;

    return new Date(
      Date.UTC(
        parseInt(matches[1], 10),
        parseInt(matches[2], 10) - 1,
        parseInt(matches[3], 10),
        parseInt(matches[4], 10),
        parseInt(matches[5], 10),
        parseInt(matches[6], 10)
      ) - offset*60*1000
    );
  }
  return null;
}

"5821074","1","","","2011-04-28 15:28:14","","2","305","<p>I'm working on a project that can be described as follows: The user will pass in a table name and some criteria. The program will then retrieve a table from Oracle and display the results to the user. The user will then have the opportunity to alter cells in a row, save the changes and send it back to Oracle. Now I'm writing a ""generalDAO"" that does all these things and works for any table passed. (One of the reasons we're trying to do this in a general setting is that we have 50+ tables to work through.) Anyways, I'm able to do everything except correctly bind the variables to the updated values. I think I'm screwing up the logic of this. If somebody has the time and patience to work through this, I'd appreciate any help or suggestions. To make this concrete, let's assume that the table I'm working with is called ""BOOKS"" and has the following columns: book_id (also the PK), title, author_last_name, author_first_name, and rating.</p>

<p>(getPrimaryKey is a simple method that queries metadata table for the PK of a table. row is a linkedhashmap that contains the column names as keys--there's other info in the value, but it's not related)</p>

<p>Here's an example of the update statement that is constructed:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE BOOKS SET BOOK_ID=?, TITLE=?, AUTHOR_LAST_NAME=?, AUTHOR_FIRST_NAME=?, RATING=? WHERE BOOK_ID=?
</code></pre>

<p>So that is all good. My problem is that I cannot actually get the values to pair up correctly with the correct columns. To put it one way, changes are stored in a list in the following manner:</p>

<p>(primarykey1value, primarykey2value,..., column1value, column2value, ...,columnnvalue)</p>

<p>but the query is set up as:</p>

<p>(column 1, column 2, column 3,..., primarykey1, primarykey 2...)</p>

<p>So if I just write a for loop to run through the query then I'll end up binding the values as follows:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE BOOKS SET BOOK_ID=primarykey1value, TITLE=primarykey2value, AUTHOR_LAST_NAME=?, AUTHOR_FIRST_NAME=?, RATING=? WHERE BOOK_ID=?
</code></pre>

<p>And so on. The problem, in short, is that the pairing is not correct. </p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>public void update(String tableName, List dataList){    

    LinkedHashMap primaryKeyMap=getPrimaryKey(tableName);
    Iterator itr=dataList.iterator();

    Connection conn=null;
    PreparedStatement ps=null;

    try {
        conn=ConnectionHelper.getConnection();
        conn.setAutoCommit(false);

        LinkedHashMap row=null;

        while(itr.hasNext()){
            row=(LinkedHashMap)itr.next();                      
            SQLVO vo=makeUpdate(tableName, primaryKeyMap, row); 
            String sql=vo.getSql();                                 
            int totalCount=vo.getColCount()+vo.getPkCount();                        
            int upperBd=totalCount-vo.getPkCount()+1;           
            int colBd=vo.getColCount();
            ps=conn.prepareStatement(sql);                              
            Iterator iter=row.entrySet().iterator();  



            //if(""Y"".equals(checker)){
                for(int i=upperBd; i &lt;=totalCount; i++){    
                    Map.Entry pairs=(Map.Entry)iter.next();
                    ps.setString(i, (String)pairs.getValue());
                    System.out.println("" This is the associated value: ""+pairs.getValue()); //      
                }

                for(int i=1; i&lt;=colBd; i++){
                    Map.Entry pairs=(Map.Entry)iter.next();
                    ps.setString(i, (String)pairs.getValue());
                }

                ps.addBatch();
            //} 
        }
            int updateCounts[]=ps.executeBatch();
            conn.commit();

    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();    
        DAOException daoe = new DAOException(e.getMessage());
        throw daoe;
    } finally {
        ConnectionHelper.close(conn);
    }   
}

<p>Does anybody have any experience with this type of problem? The two for loops are clearly not correct, and I get ""NoSuchElementException"" errors. But I'm at a loss on how to proceed. </p>

<p>I know I can check <code>$$</code> for the current shell's PID (10785) or <code>$PPID</code> for the parent PID (10778).</p>

<p>But I just want the top-level parent PID, which would be 800 (SSH daemon) in this example. Is there any way to do that easily?</p>

<p>I learned from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1525605/linux-programmatically-get-parent-pid-of-another-process/1525673#1525673"">this SO answer</a> that I can recursively check the 4th entry in the <code>/proc/PID/stat</code> file to find each process's parent PID:</p>

<pre><code># cut -f4 -d' ' /proc/10785/stat
10778
# cut -f4 -d' ' /proc/10778/stat
10252
# cut -f4 -d' ' /proc/10252/stat
10251
# cut -f4 -d' ' /proc/10251/stat
10186
# cut -f4 -d' ' /proc/10186/stat
800
# cut -f4 -d' ' /proc/800/stat
1
</code></pre>

<p>(The top-level parent PID will be the one just before I reach <code>init</code>'s PID, i.e., 1.)</p>

<p>Before I write a little loop (I'm not even sure if you can use recursion in bash) to do this, is there a much more straightforward method that I'm missing? Maybe just another parameter of a file under <code>/proc</code>? A <code>grep</code> through those files didn't reveal anything obvious.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Of course, the top-level process for all Linux processes is /sbin/init with a PID of 1. What I want is the PID of the parent just before that: the penultimate parent.</p>

I am still very new to VBA and can't seem to get past my current wall...good and bad days with respect to learning.  Unfortunately this week has me at a loss for how to move on.</p>

<p>The macro shown below will is essentially run on a spreadsheet with 2 sheets (MPL &amp; CAD).  </p>

<ul>
<li>MPL sheet = simple table of information</li>
<li>CAD sheet contains 3 tables of varying width (i.e. the first table spans from column C to AE, the 2nd and 3rd tables span from column C to M).  All 3 tables contain the project name in column C.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the macro is run, it starts in the MPL sheet, prompts the user for a new project name then adds it on a new row in alphabetical order.  This works well.</p>

<p>The next step is for the CAD sheet.  As I stated, there are 3 tables.  I am able to insert the new project, however it only inserts into 1 of the tables where the new name shows in column C.  This is where I am at a loss.  I believe I must find a way to put all values of column C into some sort of array, do a count then add a row on each instance.</p>

<p>Does this sound like a logical plan?  I have searched endlessly for a way to do this and can't seem to gain any ground.  The ""iRow = WorksheetFunction.Match(strNewProject, Range(""C:C"")) + 1"" method seems to suffice on a single table.</p>

<p>Any pointers in the right direction are appreciated.  Thanks!!</p>

<p>I have this certain situation where I have span tags :</p>

<pre><code>@:&lt;span class=""QuestionType3""&gt;

@:&lt;span class=""QuestionType4""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my CSS I define the style for those classes like this :</p>

<pre><code>.QuestionType3 {
    background: grey;
    display: inline-block;
    }
.QuestionType4 {
    background: lightgrey;
    display: block;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is to be the most specific as possible so even if the same name is used for a class of a div tag or something else there won't be problems until more than one people use this name to define class of span tag.</p>

<p>I tried :</p>

<pre><code>span .QuestionType4 {...
</code></pre>

<p>but this way I lost all the styling what so ever, so it seems this is not the correct way to specify this. So how can I do it and am I right in this that if I specifically declare that this is class of a span tag then using the same name for a class of different HTML element won't cause problem for duplicated names or something like this?</p>

<p>It is an application that track costs within a group of people and today I have the following entities:</p>

<pre><code>class Event(db.Model):
    # Values
    name = db.StringProperty(required=True)
    password = db.StringProperty(required=True)

class Person(db.Model):
    # References
    event = db.ReferenceProperty(Event, required=True)
    # Values
    name = db.StringProperty(required=True)

class Transaction(db.Model):
    # References
    event = db.ReferenceProperty(Event, required=True)
    paidby = db.ReferenceProperty(Person, required=True)
    # Values
    description = db.StringProperty(required=True)
    amount = db.FloatProperty(required=True)
    datetime = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)

# This is used because a transaction might not distribute costs
# evenly across all persons belonging to the event
class TransactionPerson(db.Model):
    # References
    event = db.ReferenceProperty(Event, required=False)
    transaction = db.ReferenceProperty(Transaction, required=True)
    person = db.ReferenceProperty(Person, required=True)
    # Values
    amount = db.FloatProperty(required=True)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is when I for example want to calculate the balance for each person, then I have to get all the data associated with an event and loop through all TransactionPerson for each Transaction/Person combination (in the below example that is ~65.000 operations)</p>

<p>I have an event example with:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 Persons</li>
<li>76 Transaction</li>
<li>213 TransactionPerson</li>
</ul>

<p>And a request to the start page that shows this balance summary per person and all transactions takes:</p>

<pre>
real: 1863ms
cpu: 6900ms (1769ms real)
api: 2723ms (94ms real)
</pre>

<p>At the moment I only do 3 RPC requests to get all persons, transactions and transactionpersons for an event and then do all the ""relational"" work in the application, thats why the cpu ms is pretty high.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It takes 2723ms api cpu to only get the 293 objects from 3 datastore requests, isn't that pretty high? The real time is OK (94ms), but it takes a lot from my api cpu quotas?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I design this to get a lot better performance? Real ms today is 1863 for this example above, but if there are for example 12 persons the time would triple. These are not acceptable response times.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you're not familiar with WP DB architecture: wp_users holds basic user information and their IDs, wp_usermeta holds the ID, meta_key, and meta_value.  </p>

<p>Let's say I want to get all users that have certain meta_keys and meta_values.  This is the query I currently have (generated via PHP based on available meta_keys):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID, 
user_email, 
user_login, 
first_name.meta_value as first_name,
last_name.meta_value as last_name,
phone_number.meta_value as phone_number,
wp_capabilities.meta_value as wp_capabilities 
FROM wp_users, 
(select * from wp_usermeta where meta_key = 'first_name') as first_name,
(select * from wp_usermeta where meta_key = 'last_name') as last_name,
(select * from wp_usermeta where meta_key = 'phone_number') as phone_number,
(select * from wp_usermeta where meta_key = 'wp_capabilities') as wp_capabilities 
WHERE  
ID = first_name.user_id AND 
ID = last_name.user_id AND 
ID = phone_number.user_id AND 
ID = wp_capabilities.user_id  AND 
wp_wpi_capabilities.meta_value LIKE '%administrator%'   
ORDER BY first_name
</code></pre>

<p>This does a good job, however if a certain user is missing a meta_key, 'last_name' for instance, that user row does not get returned at all. So really all I need is a way of returning a Null value for missing meta keys.</p>

<p>Right now I have a very hackish function that goes through and creates blank meta_keys and meta_values for all the users that don't have a given meta_key, that way they are returned.  This is a terrible way of doing it though when you have over a thousand users, and you need to add a new type of meta_key. </p>

<p>Let me know if anybody has done this, or if I need to explain better.</p>

<p>I'm creating my first node.js server/client reporting app. It gathers data via rest APIs to keep a pulse on web services I use such as CloudFlare.com, UptimeRobot.com, etc. In addition (where I need help), I'd like to connect my local reporting node.js server to my production node.js server, which will report CPU load and available memory in intervals.</p>

<p>Starting on the production server, here's what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    var status = {load: 0.9, usedMem: 0.5}; //contians this machine's memory usage and average CPU loads, just some basic values here to get things started, no assistance needed with getting those values


    ///////////////////////////////////
    //socket server
    ///////////////////////////////////
    var app = require('express')()
        , server = require('http').createServer(app)
        , io = require('socket.io').listen(server);

    server.listen(3000);

    io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
        socket.emit('status', status); //NOT SO FAST! I need to authenticate before giving away this stuff!!!
    });
})();
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the 'client' side (although the client will be server, which collects and delivers this and other data to an actual browser client):</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:3000'); //too easy, right?
    socket.on('status', function (data) {
        console.log(data);
    });
})();
</code></pre>

<p>It would terrify me to actually use this in a production environment. Any thoughts on how to ""simply"" tighten this up? For the most part, only one other machine will/should have access to the production server's node.js server. However, I'll likely need to set up access for a few people to access the reporting server eventually.</p>

<p>I have a UIImageView, (showing an image of a coin) which when the screen is tapped, animates to simulate spinning. I do this with the following code (simplified to just show relevant stuff): </p>

<pre><code>- (void)spinCoin:(int)times

    // Create a block scoped variable to store the amount of spins.
    __block int blockTimes = times;

}
</code></pre>

<p>This method is called in touchesEnded.</p>

<p>Essentially it just scales the coin image on the x axis to 0, then once that is done, scales it back to 1 (and repeats this 4 times).</p>

<p>This works fine despite being a bit messy (oh god blockception), but if I click the home button, then re-open the app, if I tap the screen the coin flips 1-3 times then the imageView completely disappears. There are no errors etc. in the console. </p>

<p>Does anyone know what could be causing this? Are there problems with Core Graphics/Animation and apps moving into out of the background?</p>

So far so good, however after finally managing to save the binary search tree into a file, I have one bug. </p>

<p>Lets say I add 3 customers the first time. I then close the program, and when I reopen it I will find the same 3 customers in the tree. however, the next time I open the file, it gives me an error from one of my predefined errors,  which occurs when a node is not able to identity whether to go left or right, maybe because its empty or uncomparable. here are some code snippets. I aslo tried using other fileopen techniques other than a+b, and I had no such error, but by the way I designed my program, I need the append method or else only one record will save.</p>

<pre><code>$sql = new Sql($this-&gt;adapter);
    $sqlObject = $sql-&gt;select()
        -&gt;from([
            'ART' =&gt; 'acl_roles'

            ],
            'ART.type_id = ARTT.id',
            [
                'ARTT.id'         =&gt; 'id',
                'ARTT.identifier' =&gt; 'identifier',
                'ARTT.name'       =&gt; 'name',
                'ARTT.status'     =&gt; 'status',
                'ARTT.dateAdded'  =&gt; 'date_added',
            ],
            Select::JOIN_INNER
        )
        -&gt;where([
            'ART.identifier' =&gt; $identifier,
        ])
        -&gt;columns([
            'ART.id'          =&gt; 'id',
            'ART.type_id'     =&gt; 'type_id',
            'ART.identifier'  =&gt; 'identifier',
            'ART.name'        =&gt; 'name',

            'ART.description' =&gt; 'description',
            'ART.dateAdded'   =&gt; 'date_added',
        ]);
</code></pre>

<p>Now if the query was on a single entity, I could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = $sql-&gt;prepareStatementForSqlObject($sqlObject);
$resultset = $stmt-&gt;execute();
if ($resultset instanceof ResultInterface &amp;&amp; $resultset-&gt;isQueryResult()) {
    $hydratingResultSet = new HydratingResultSet(new ArraySerializable, new EntityClass);
    $hydratingResultSet-&gt;initialize($resultset);
    return $hydratingResultSet-&gt;current();
}
</code></pre>

<p>However in my case I need the hydrating result set to be able to build and return multiple entities (namely AclRoleEntity and AclRoleTypeEntity). Is this something that is possible? If yes how (considering the result set being a flat array of combination of both entities). If no are there better alternatives to achieve this without using Doctrine/Propel?</p>

<p>DataMapper looks very cool, but I noticed that the models are all tightly coupled with the <code>has_one</code> and <code>has_many</code> E.g. from the datamapper docs:</p>

<pre><code>class User extends DataMapper {

    var $has_many = array('book');
    var $has_one = array('country');

........

class Country extends DataMapper {

    var $table = 'countries';

    var $has_many = array('user');

........

class Book extends DataMapper {

var $has_many = array('user');
</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned at the start, we are using HMVC to deal with modulized code. This means that we may have the countries module, and/or we may have the books module. but they are modulized, so the users module (which includes the User object) doesn't know that the other two modules exist so we can't specify in the <code>User</code> model the information about the other two models.</p>

<p>The IIS6, ""IISVDir"" commands reference paths in that are from the metabase, eg, <code>/W3SVC/1/ROOT/MyApp</code> - where 1 is ID of ""Default Web Site"". The command doesn't actually require the display name of the site to make changes to it.</p>

<p>This works well, since on a different language OS, the ""Default Web Site"" site name could be named, for example, ""既定の Web サイト"" or anything else for that matter. But this flexibility is lost if AppCmd can only reference ""Default Web Site"" via its name, and not a language-neutral identifier.</p>

<p>So, how can I script AppCmd to refer to sites, vdirs and apps using language neutral identifiers to reference the ""Default App Site""?</p>

<p>Perhaps I need to start creating my own site instead, from the start, and name it something else specific, and stop using ""Default Web Site"" as the root?</p>

<p>Now I'm having this problem: I have the ContextMenu</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TreeView.ContextMenu&gt;
    &lt;ContextMenu x:Name=""MyContext"" ItemsSource=""{Binding OCContext}"" DisplayMemberPath=""Text""/&gt;
&lt;/TreeView.ContextMenu&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YRcJI.png"" alt=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4gA1l.png""></p>

<p>(The image shows how my ContextMenu looks like, don't mind about the tabItem...).</p>

<p>As you can see, it's just the ContetMenu, no MenuItem! If the user clicks on Close, I want to do something in my ViewModel (raise a Command?). I'd also like to know which button/Menu he clicked. The amount of Menus is dynamically, since it's ItemsSource is being binded.</p>

<p>This is my ViewModel:</p>

<pre><code>private ObservableCollection&lt;T_Antwort&gt; _occontext;
public ObservableCollection&lt;T_Antwort&gt; OCContext
{
    get
    {
        if (_occontext == null)
            _occontext = new ObservableCollection&lt;T_Antwort&gt;();
        return _occontext;
    }
    set
    {
        _occontext = value;
        RaisePropertyChanged(() =&gt; OCContext);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So all I want to do is to bind the ContextMenu (The ""items"" Close and CloseOtherThankThis) to my ViewModel, so when the user clicks on one of them, I want to access them in my ViewModel. This means I don't want to bind them one by one, I want somehow to get an event (ContextMenuItemClicked (?)) being called and use this in my ViewModel.</p>

<p>Btw. using MenuItem under ContextMenu will create another ""Menu folder"", so it would be</p>

<p>"" "" -> Close</p>

<p>"" "" -> CloseOtherThankThis</p>

<p>And I don't want it to look like this.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm currently getting the item like this:</p>

<pre><code>    private void MyContext_PreviewMouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
    {
        System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.MenuBase s = sender as System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.MenuBase;
        ItemCollection ic = s.Items;
        T_Antwort SelectedItem = (T_Antwort)ic.CurrentItem;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any possibility to get the selected item with binding?</p>

<p>Given that I'm using Django 1.3 and nginx, what's the correct way to make a site HTTPS-only? </p>

<p>The one response mentioned <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2799450/django-https-for-just-login-page"">a middleware solution</a>, but had the caveat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Django can't perform a SSL redirect while maintaining POST data.
  Please structure your views so that redirects only occur during GETs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A question on Server Fault about <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/330729/front-end-of-our-app-is-not-working-after-migration-from-apache-to-nginx"">nginx rewriting to https</a>, also mentioned problems with POSTs losing data, and I'm not familiar enough with nginx to determine how well the solution works.</p>

<p>And <a href=""https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/deploying-https"">EFF's recommendation to go HTTPS-only</a>, notes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The application must set the Secure attribute on the cookie when
  setting it. This attribute instructs the browser to send the cookie
  only over secure (HTTPS) transport, never insecure (HTTP).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do apps like Django-auth have the ability to set cookies as Secure? Or do I have to write more middleware?</p>

<p>So, what is the best way to configure the combination of Django/nginx to implement HTTPS-only, in terms of:</p>

<ul>
<li>security</li>
<li>preservation of POST data</li>
<li>cookies handled properly</li>
<li>interaction with other Django apps (such as Django-auth), works properly</li>
<li>any other issues I'm not aware of :)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - another issue I just discovered, while testing multiple browsers. Say I have the URL <code>https://mysite.com/search/</code>, which has a search form/button. I click the button, process the form in Django as usual, and do a Django <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse"">HttpResponseRedirect</a> to <code>http://mysite.com/search?results=""foo""</code>. Nginx redirects that to <code>https://mysite.com/search?results=""foo""</code>, as desired. </p>

<p>However - Opera has a visible <em>flash</em> when the redirection happens. And it happens every search, even for the same search term (I guess https really doesn't cache :) Worse, when I test it in IE, I first get the message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are about to be redirected to a connection that is not secure - continue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After clicking ""yes"", this is immediately followed by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are about to view pages over a secure connection - continue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the second IE warning has an option to turn it off - the <em>first</em> warning does not, so every time someone does a search and gets redirected to a results page, they get at least one warning message.</p>

<p>We have a table that has scheduled weekly activities. Each row of the table has an unique id, a day number, and an hour number.</p>

<pre><code>id (auto int) | dayNumber (int from 0 to 6) | hourNumber (int from 0 to 23) 
</code></pre>

<p>Based off of this table, we can determine when an event is supposed to occur on the schedule. For example, an entry of dayNumber=2 and hourNumber=3 would mean that an event is scheduled for Tuesday at 3 AM.</p>

<p>The part that I am finding difficult is that I need to run a query to get a range of scheduled events. So I will pass in a minimum dayNumber and hourNumber and a maximum dayNumber and hourNumber. My expected results will be every matching entry in that range. </p>

<p>The easier case is when the minimum is less than the maximum. For example (in PHP), </p>

<pre><code>$minimumDayNumber = 1; $minimumHourNumber = 3;
$maximumDayNumber = 5; $maximumHourNumber = 6;
</code></pre>

<p>Where it gets more complicated is when I want to search the range from Saturday to Tuesday. For that, the variables would look something like this:
    $minimumDayNumber = 6; $minimumHourNumber = 3;
    $maximumDayNumber = 2; $maximumHourNumber = 6;</p>

<p>Using these inputs, I would need to query the database and find all entries within that range. There must be a good algorithm to either construct the query or a good query to do this fairly directly. </p>

<p>This seems easy on paper and I have done it with date ranges (actual date fields), but I just cannot get this to work correctly. Thank you in advance for your help and let me know if you need additional clarification. </p>

Just a logic which I seem to misunderstand.</p>

<p>I have a parking system with different parking spots (for cars, moto, large cars, etc).</p>

<p>To initialize parking system, I have to loop through the initial settings array and create empty spots with specifying each ID and type.</p>

<p>I did it like this:</p>

<p>Here's my config, the numbers and capacity types can be added before any initialization of the system</p>

<pre><code>var config = {
    capacityPerType: {
        compact: 150,
        large: 100
    }
}

manager = new Manager(config);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's how I loop through all types and assign them a spot ID:</p>

<pre><code>    var counterAdd = 0;
    for(slotType in config.capacityPerType) {

        var capacityPerType = parseInt( config.capacityPerType[slotType] );
        for(var i = 1; i &lt;= capacityPerType; i++) {
            var newId = i + counterAdd;

            if (!this.defaults.slots[slotType]) {
                this.defaults.slots[slotType] = [];
            }
            this.defaults.slots[slotType][newId] = new Slot({id:newId,type:slotType});
        }

        counterAdd = capacityPerType;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly, that's a code smell. It will work ONLY with 2 types, and unless the second type is lower than the first type.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to keep looping and preserving  the counter number? :/</p>

I've got the code working and some unit tests for my custom <code>PayPal::Merchant::ExpressCheckout</code> module, but I'm having trouble understanding how to mock or stub the controller methods properly so I can write integration tests. </p>

<p>One problem I'm facing is that all of the PayPal API calls are to the same endpoint URI with only an action parameter in the POSTed data to distinguish which action we're calling. While I've successfully setup FakeWeb to simulate proper XML responses from the PayPal API in my unit tests, there are some integration scenarios in which I need to be able to handle back-to-back API requests. Is there a way to tell FakeWeb to respond differently based on the POSTed data? Alternately, is there a way to have FakeWeb trigger a callback method after it intercepts the first request so I can setup the next request?</p>

<p>Another problem is how to mock the redirect to PayPal. Right now a user clicks the Checkout With PayPal button on our site which redirects them to a <code>setup</code> method on my <code>ExpressCheckoutsController</code>, which gets a token and sets up the checkout URL and then redirects the user there. I need to simulate two scenarios in my integration tests:
 1. The user submits the form properly and is sent to my return URL
 2. The user cancels and is sent to my cancel URL
Is there a way to do this without rewriting the entire ExpressCheckoutsController class in the test file?</p>

<p>In case it matters, we're using the paypal-sdk-merchant gem. Our test environment uses the following gems:</p>

<pre><code>group :test do
  gem 'autotest-rails', '4.1.0'
  gem 'ZenTest', '&lt; 4.6'
  gem 'fakeweb', '1.2.6'
  gem 'mocha', '0.9.4'
  gem 'quietbacktrace', '0.1.1'
  gem 'factory_girl', '1.2.0'
  gem 'thoughtbot-shoulda', '2.10.2', :require =&gt; 'shoulda'
  gem 'nokogiri', '1.5.6'
  gem 'webrat', '0.4.4'
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I was able to figure out the redirection issue by using Mocha to stub my custom <code>ExpressCheckout</code> module's <code>express_checkout_url</code> method so that it simply redirects to the <code>return</code> or <code>cancel</code> actions.</p>

<pre><code>PayPal::Merchant::ExpressCheckout.any_instance.stubs(:express_checkout_url).returns(return_order_express_checkout_path)

<pre><i>What I'm doing</i>:                      <i>Example usage</i>:</pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/I48oU.png"" width=""300""> <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/dqhP1.png"" alt=""prototype""></p>

<p><em>The problem</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I want to retrieve a certain Date I have to go over <em>all</em> items in the vector to see if RecPaymentsStack.stackDate matches the date the user requested.</li>
<li>The RecPaymentStack is actually completely useless at the moment because what I <em>should</em> be doing, is, when adding a new item, checking if a ""RecPaymentStack.stackDate"" has already been made for the new item's Date property, and if so add the new pointer to ""RecPayments"" to an <strong>array</strong> of pointers inside the ""RecPaymentStack"" object. But how?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm probably unnecessarily complicating things (something I do a lot) so an explenation on how something like this <em>should</em> be done would be very nice.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed info:</strong> (in case I was being too vague)</p>

<p>The below example is supposed to resemble a calendar that can hold certain items (RecPayments) and those items are grouped by their date (RecPaymentsStack).</p>

<pre><code>struct RecPayments
{
    std::string name;
    Date* date;
    float cost;
};

struct RecPaymentsStack
{
    Date* stackDate; //This stack's date
    RecPayments * thePaymentItem; //Hold pointer to the actual item
};
</code></pre>

<p>And here's how I'm currently storing them</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;RecPaymentsStack*&gt; RecPaymentsVector; //This vector will hold pointers to all the Recurring Payments

void addRecurring(std::string theDate,std::string theName,float theCost)
{
    //New recurring payment
    RecPayments * newPaymentItem = new RecPayments;
    //Set recurring payment properties
    newPaymentItem-&gt;name = theName;
    newPaymentItem-&gt;date = new Date(stringToChar(theDate));
    newPaymentItem-&gt;cost = theCost;

    //Add recurring payment to stack
    RecPaymentsStack * addToStack = new RecPaymentsStack;
    addToStack-&gt;stackDate = new Date(stringToChar(theDate));
    addToStack-&gt;thePaymentItem = newPaymentItem;

    //Add pointer to RecPaymentsStack to vector
    RecPaymentsVector.push_back(addToStack);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So to retrieve the items for a given date, I am currently going over <strong>all</strong> pointers in the vector to see if the ""stackDate"" property matches the requested date, and if so I use the ""thePaymentItem"" property to show the actual item.</p>

<pre><code>void getItemsNow(Date requestedDate)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Showing Dates for "" &lt;&lt; requestedDate &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    unsigned int i;
    for(i=0;i&lt;RecPaymentsVector.size();i++) //Go over all items in vector
    {
        Date dateInVector(*RecPaymentsVector[i]-&gt;stackDate); //Get the date from the vector
        if(dateInVector == requestedDate) //See if Date matches what the user requested
        {
            //Date matched, show user the item properties.
            std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Date: "" &lt;&lt; dateInVector &lt;&lt;
                "" has name: "" &lt;&lt; RecPaymentsVector[i]-&gt;thePaymentItem-&gt;name &lt;&lt;
                "" and price "" &lt;&lt; RecPaymentsVector[i]-&gt;thePaymentItem-&gt;cost &lt;&lt;
                std::endl;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>3 problems with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Going over all items in the vector is highly inefficient if I only
need a couple of pointers</li>
<li>The RecPaymentStack is actually completely useless at the moment because what I <em>should</em> be doing, is, when adding a new item, checking if a ""RecPaymentStack.stackDate"" has already been made for the new item's Date property, and if so add the new pointer to ""RecPayments"" to an <strong>array</strong> of pointers inside the ""RecPaymentStack"" object. But how?</li>
<li>All of this feels extremely silly to begin with.. there's probably a much easier/professional way to do this but I can't find out what, probably because I'm still thinking like a PHPer.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the general idea here is that I end up doing something like (silly example)</p>

<pre><code>for each RecPaymentsStack-&gt;stackDate //For each unique Date, show it's children items.
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""The Date is "" CurrentRecPaymentsStack-&gt;stackDate and it holds the following items:
    for each CurrentRecPaymentsStack-&gt;thePaymentItem //This would now be an array of pointers
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""item name "" CurrentRecPaymentsStack-&gt;thePaymentItem-&gt;name &lt;&lt; "" with cost "" &lt;&lt; CurrentRecPaymentsStack-&gt;thePaymentItem-&gt;cost &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which would basically go over all the unique ""RecPaymentsStack"" objects (unique determined by it's ""Date"" property) and for each Date it would then show it's ""children"" from the RecPayments struct.</p>

<p>And there has to be some way to search for a particular date without having to go over <strong>all</strong> the available ones.</p>

where AdvancedDistribution.aspx is of course the aspx file and SaveClicked is the static WebMethod(C#).</p>

<p>para is just a 2d array with the parameter values.</p>

<p>Is there any additional overhead for each new database you create? We we eventually hit a wall where we have just to many databases on one server? The SQL Server specs say you can have something like 32000 databases but is that possible, does anyone have a large number of database on one server and what are the problems you encounter.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Frank</p>

To do this we are using wpa_supplicant to associate to a specific network (usually a hotspot), using a specific auth protocol then we analyse the answer with Scapy.
Until know, we are using the Wpa_supplicant in a bash file to associate to a network, using different conf file (First we are trying to connect using PEAP, then LEAP, TLS,... ). Here are the things we don't really understand :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why do we have to set the network with ""iwconfig wlan0 'SSID' "" before using the wpa_supplicant command ? (The SSID is already written in the wpa_supplicant.conf, I guess there is a legit explanation about this).</p>

<p><code>!#/bin/bash
ifconfig wlan0 down
iwconfig wlan0 essid ""FreeWifi_secure""
ifconfig wlan0 up
wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c wpa_supplicant.conf -Dwext -dd</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>wpa supplicant.conf : </p>

<pre><code>network={
  ssid=""FreeWifi_secure""
  key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
  eap=TLS
  identity=""nom_utilisateur""
}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Actually we would like to implement everything with Python/scapy, but an EAP request is sent first from the router to our device after associating to the network. We were thinking that we would have to send the first packet to the router and that we could just forge this packet using Scapy, that way we should'nt use the wpa_supplicant command line. That being said, we would like to know how to associate to a network using Python, so we don't have to use WpaSupplicant. Is there a specific packet to send ?
Actually when we start the association with wpa_supplicant, we tried to sniff the network with scapy to see wich kind of packet is sent to associate. But actually the first packet we get is the ""Identify"" EAP packet sent from the router, so how does this associtation works ? How can we start this exchange just using a python script (is it even possible ?)</p></li>
<li><p>We saw that using the wpa_supplicant command, we get first the Identify packet, then there is an exchange of IP packet between our device and an other one (wich is not the router, it has not the same MAC adress as the destination of the first EAP packet). Are those packet really necessary for us ? If we send our own EAP packet with scapy, is that going to be a problem if we don't forge those packet ? I guess this is some kind of DHCP packet but since we don't even want to really connect to the network can we just focalize on the EAP exchange ?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So until now, we can detect any type of authentification type allowed by the router but we have to start a bash file (wich start the association with the wpa_supplicant cmd line) and start sniffing with the python script at the same time. We would like to find a solution to be able to just start the python script by sending our own forged packet but to start doing this we need to associate to the network and we can't find any solution on how to do it trough scapy.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help !</p>

<p>I'm focusing on one aspect first: notifications for comments.</p>

<p>My database table <code>comments</code> looks like this: !(<a href=""http://oi43.tinypic.com/2zgtaoz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oi43.tinypic.com/2zgtaoz.jpg</a>)</p>

<p>When a user submits a comment the recepient's ID is added to the field <code>to_id</code>.</p>

<p><code>unviewed</code> is the default status of every comment.</p>

<p>Then I made this code to check for all unviewed comments:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE to_id='$myid' AND status='unviewed'
</code></pre>

<p>I made some dummy comments and the count works 100%.</p>

<p>I also made a dropdown box to view the notifications in but the code is really long and not crucial to what I need to do next so I'll omit it unless needed to clarify later.</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to find out how I can change the value in the <code>status</code> field to 'viewed' when a user clicks through to it from their notifications menu.</p>

<p>Does anybody know how I can achieve this using php and cookies? Just looking for a point in the right direction, my mind is a bit frazzled after writing code all day.</p>

One of the features is basic-auth auto-login. The credentials are fetched from our servers and then with a single click the user can login into a basic-auth-protected URL without the need to fill in the credentials manually.</p>

<p>I have it working for Firefox and Chrome. For Firefox, I take advantage of the fact that it caches the basic-auth credentials even if the request is done via XMLHttpRequest. So, I basically do this:</p>

<pre><code>  //Make the basic-auth request to URL using XMLHttpRequest
  var xml = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xml.open('GET', URL ,false, USERNAME , PASSWORD);
  xml.send('');
  //Now redirect the current tab to the URL
  window.content.document.location = URL;
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine for Firefox, and used to work fine for Chrome as well. Google changed a couple of stuff in the latest releases of Chrome, and I had to start using the onAuthRequest callback, which works fine (if not better, check this post for a reference: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10725654/chrome-plugin-development-userpassurl-not-supported-by-google-chrome-anymore"">Chrome plugin development: user:pass@url not supported by Google Chrome anymore?</a>). </p>

I edited the <code>/etc/couchdb/local.ini</code> file with my port (default <code>5984</code>) and server ip address. Whenever I run the <code>service couchdb start</code>, it returns the ok message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting couchdb:                                          [  OK  ]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if I run a <code>service couchdb status</code> right after, I get this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>couchdb dead but pid file exists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and, of course, the server does not work.</p>

<p>The weird part is that <code>service couchdb start</code> always returns the success message, although the server never actually runs. Also, there is no log files created at all by couchdb (my <code>/var/log/couchdb/</code> folder is empty - doubled checked couchdb configuration files for the path).</p>

<p>When I delete the <code>/var/run/subsys/couchdb.pid</code> file, service shows couchdb as not started, and when I try to restart couchdb (<code>service couchdb start</code>), I get the success message again and so on.</p>

<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated. :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I forgot to mention that when I run <code>couchdb</code> it works fine (giving me only this warning <code>warning: ""TODO: max is currently unsupported""</code>), so it is just the service that doesn't work.</p>

<p>half floating data types supported as texture format, automatic conversion of half precision to float by texture hardware, <em>floattohalf</em> and <em>halftofloat</em> conversion functions supported on device only,and storing of half precsion values in <em>unsigned short</em> format. </p>

<p>So for all this to make sense, I have made these inferences. </p>

<p>CUDA supports two ways of handling half precicision. </p>

<li><p>Store float numbers in global memory. Convert them to half via <em>halftofloat</em>, store in unsigned short in global memory and reconvert to float via <em>halftofloat</em> before executing any operation.</p></li>
<li><p>(as texture memory is read-only from device) have numbers in half precision stored in unsigned short in host, store them in texture memory from host code, read via intrinsic TEX function and perform operations on it (without needing to convert to float).</p></li>

<p>My basic example worked but when I try and implement this in a site we have taken over to help a client, the French character Œ just does not want to come through at all.</p>

<p>Things I have done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Made sure XML is saved as UTF-8</li>
<li>XML uses CDATA</li>
<li>Have embedded fonts</li>
<li>Have embedded Œ specifically</li>
<li>Have used another font altogether</li>
<li>Have placed the character Œ in another text field outside of the MC it's meant to be in and set that as static text which works.</li>
<li>Have recreated the text field thinking it may have corrupted somehow.</li>
<li>Have put another text field next to it outside of the mask, changed the name and added the characters to the text field.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything else I could try that I might be missing?</p>

<ul>
<li>I have now also plugged Kostas Zotos' example in directly into the site I am working on and his sample works which leads me to believe there might be something wrong with the XML.</li>
<li>Could a malformed XML be the cause of something like this? All other special characters are coming through expect for this sucker.</li>
<li>I have also created an entirely new XML file, saved it as UTF-8 and now the French side of the site wont load.</li>
<li>I have now also checked and ensured that the XML is not malformed using Firefox and it all looks good.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the attached example, the blue circle between the --- ---- is where my characters should be appearing which is happening in the text field to the left.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/dnQS0.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>EDIT: This is not working in FF as I originally believed. I am being directed to my LogOn action immediately after logging in and attempting to access an action with my SessionExpireFilter attribute.</p>

So we have Players, Teams, Leagues as the dimension tables and Match as the factual table relates these tables. For instance, if I need to query stats of a player in a particular match or a range of matches, it is very painstaking SQL query with lots of joins to convert machine readable ID based tables to human readable name based version. In addition, analysis of that data is also very painful. For being a solution, I suggest to transform that DB to Analysis friendly version. Again for example, Player table ll include players at each row with related stats and same for Teams as well. </p>

<p>The question is, is there any framework, method or schema that might guide me to design the analysis friendly DB layout. Also still the use of SQL is favorable or any non-sql DB is better for this problem?</p>

<p>I know it sounds very general question but I just want to hear some expertise about the topic. Therefore, any help, suggestion is very welcome. </p>

<p>I'm using node.js and some Unicode libraries such as <a href=""http://xregexp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">XRegExp</a> and <a href=""http://coderepos.org/share/browser/lang/javascript/UnicodeNormalizer"" rel=""nofollow"">unorm</a> already so I don't mind adding other libraries that might already handle or ease such a feature.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of a JavaScript library that can look up character properties such as script codes, so this is probably the second part of the problem.</p>

<p>The third part of the problem is just to avoid inefficiencies.</p>

<p>But the <code>std</code> hasn't, and the answer is <code>hi&lt;&gt; trans&lt;cParen&gt; lo&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>My variable <code>angle</code> has been spotted as a <code>hi&lt;CTagsMember&gt; trans&lt;CTagsMember&gt; lo&lt;Member&gt;</code> (why not?), but its little bro' <code>speed</code> hasn't: it is <code>hi&lt;&gt; trans&lt;cBlock&gt; lo&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Each <code>Assessment</code> (A) has a mark and a weighting to count to the overall average. This object has <code>getMark</code> and <code>getWeighting</code> methods which allows be to extract the mark and the weighting.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The <code>Assessment</code> class is extended to create a <code>WeightedAverage</code> (W) object which can store many assessments. It includes an array of assessments in addition to the mark (which is unused) and the weighting. The <code>getMark</code> method is overridden to calculate a mark using the array of <code>Assessment</code> objects (which, by nature of the OO employed, could include other weighted averages).</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Finally, the <code>Assessment</code> class is extended to create a <code>TopX</code> (T) object which can store many assessments and return the average of the top 'X' assessments stored in it.</p>

<p>I now need to store the ""algorithm"" that the teacher wants to use in a database. I envisage storing it as a string that might look like this:</p>

<p><code>W(A(1,10),A(2,10),A(3,10),T(3,30,A(4,1),A(5,1),A(6,1),A(7,1),W(A(8,1),A(9,1))))</code></p>

<p><br/><br/>
This would calculate a final result based on the weighted average of assessment 1 adjusted to 10, assessment 2 adjusted to 10, assessment 3 adjusted to 10 and then the top 3 assessments adjusted to 30 of assessments 4, 5, 6, 7 and the combined average of assessments 8 and 9, each weighted equally.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to end up with an array that looks something like this which can then easily be translated into the objects required for the calculation.</p>

<pre><code>$array [0] ['type'] = 'W'
$array [0] [0] = 'A(1,10)'
$array [0] [1] = 'A(2,10)'
$array [0] [2] = 'A(3,10)'
$array [0] [3] ['type'] = 'T'
$array [0] [3] ['params'] = '3,30'
$array [0] [3] [0] = 'A(4,1)'
$array [0] [3] [1] = 'A(5,1)'
$array [0] [3] [2] = 'A(6,1)'
$array [0] [3] [3] = 'A(7,1)'
$array [0] [3] [4] ['type'] = 'W'
$array [0] [3] [4] [0] = 'A(8,1)'
$array [0] [3] [4] [1] = 'A(9,1)'

<p>If I set it to a local page, though, the content is loaded.</p>

<p>Is this because of the same origin policy? I'm not so informed about it. I did some googling and I'm confused because some sites say that it's okay to include an iframe with src that doesn't belong to your own domain, and some say it's not possible.</p>

<p>By the way, since I'm still testing on localhost, would this work if I uploaded this to a server somewhere? (but src of iframe will still be in a different domain)</p>

<p>One issue with this setup is checking out this project and using
    it in Flash Builder from scratch:</p>

<p><strong>Flash Builder doesn't like it when
you have a project folder without
the .project files.</strong> Only way to
import the source into Flash Builder is to: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new Flex Application</p></li>
<li><p>Smother the template files it
created (specifially APP_NAME.mxml)
with a git clone.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Where do I put libraries?</strong> From a git perspective, I'd like to have them in the lib folder of the repo so when someone clones the repo, everything just works, but from a local file system perspective I'd like to store all my libraries in a single location and use Flash Builder to reference them, as I may update the library or download a later version. Maybe I should put the libraries in their own repo and load them as a git module? This way I don't need to manually remember to update my Y library files in all X projects that are using them, edit: they will simply update when I update each projects' submodules. </p>

<p><strong>And what about external swfs/flex modules?</strong> I've was sticking external swf files in the bin-debug folder for now so the SWFLoader class can find them, but because I'm .gitignoring the bin-debug folder, they don't come with the repo when it's cloned.</p>

<p><strong>One final issue is where to keep the files for the server</strong>. Do I have them in a separate repo? I'm using php VOs' with AMFPHP so it's good to be able to edit the php files alongside my actionscript files in Flash Builder... but they don't belong in the project src folder.</p>

<p>The current solution I'm using is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Creating a 'server' folder in the project root</p></li>
<li><p>Pointing an apache virtualhost at it</p></li>
<li><p>Setting the run/debug settings to <a href=""http://APP%5FNAME.localhost"">http://APP%5FNAME.localhost</a></p></li>
<li><p>Then using the server folder as a replacement for bin-debug when the files get exported</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The problem with this is I've got a <strong>big mess of compiler generated files, and non-AS source files in my server folder</strong>. It just doesn't seem like an elegant solution.</p>

<p>How do you set up git to work with flash builder smoothly? Could all this be resolved with multiple git repos/Flash Builder projects, or an ANT script or something?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Currently there are several endpoints which require no authentication, meaning there is no login from the app.</p>

<p>We're attempting to prevent non-app users calling the public web service using token authentication between the client and server.</p>

<p>The issue is that as there is no login required from the app, the token will be generated statically from within the app as there's no client submitted data we can use in the token generation. </p>

<p>This leads to the issue that anyone can decompile the app, find our public key and work out how to generate a token then call the web service at their free will.</p>

<p>Has anyone tackled a similar issue in the past? Are tokens the best way to prevent unwanted clients calling the service?</p>

<p>Or is there a way we can store the public key from within the app which protects it from people finding it?</p>

| -&gt; Use accept() on master_socket to receive connections...
</code></pre>

<p>Based on a few related threads, it seems as though this is possible using a Unix domain socket which will track that the socket handle was sent from Process1 to Process2 in the kernel, giving it permission (e.g., <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2358684/can-i-share-a-file-descriptor-to-another-process-on-linux-or-are-they-local-to-t"">here</a>, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/670891/is-there-a-way-for-multiple-processes-to-share-a-listening-socket"">here</a>, <a href=""http://infohost.nmt.edu/~eweiss/222_book/222_book/0201433079/ch17lev1sec4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">and here</a>).  </p>

<p><strong>What I am trying to determine is whether or not the descriptor is possible to share over a POSIX message queue.</strong>  Oddly enough, if I create the socket BEFORE opening the queue, it seems to work OK.  However, if I create the socket AFTER opening the queue, the descriptor read on Process2 comes up as ""invalid.""  </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How to run</strong>: Just go ahead and run <code>./read</code> and it will wait on the message queue and then run <code>./send</code>.  If you compiled send.c with init_socket() before open_queue(), you will see:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./read 
Re-opened the IPC queue: /share_socket
Got master socket value: 3
... socket is valid
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./read 
Re-opened the IPC queue: /share_socket
Got master socket value: 4
... SOCKET IS INVALID
</code></pre>

<p>What would cause this behavior where the ordering is important?</p>

<p>Every set has all the elements of the original set, permuted to appear in unique subsets. What is the algorithm that produces these sets? I've tried Python generator functions using choose, permutation, combination, power set, and so on, but can't get the right combination.</p>

<p>20 Jan 2009</p>

<p>This is not a homework question. This is an improved answer I was working on for www.projecteuler.net problem # 118. I already had a slow solution but came up with a better way -- except I could not figure out how to do the spanning set.</p>

<p>I'll post my code when I get back from an Inauguration Party.</p>

<p>21 Jan 2009</p>

<p>This is the eventual algorithm I used:</p>

<pre><code>def spanningsets(items):
    if len(items) == 1:
    	yield [items]
    else:
    	left_set, last = items[:-1], [items[-1]]
    	for cc in spanningsets(left_set):
    		yield cc + [last]
    		for i,elem in enumerate(cc):
    			yield cc[:i] + [elem + last] + cc[i+1:]
</code></pre>

<p>@Yuval F: I know how to do a powerset. Here's a straightforward implementation:</p>

<pre><code>def powerset(s) :
    length = len(s)
    for i in xrange(0, 2**length) :
    	yield [c for j, c in enumerate(s) if (1 &lt;&lt; j) &amp; i]

        'order' =&gt; ''
    )
);
</code></pre>

<p>I created several records for Rejectreasons and EmployeesProjects, so I have some valid entries here in the database. Now I want to link them together by creating a new record in the given employees_projects_rejectreasons table. I try to do this from another controller (the EmployeesProjectsController). Here is my latest attempt to save the data:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;EmployeesProject-&gt;EmployeesProjectsRejectreason-&gt;create();

$eprData = array(
    'EmployeesProjectsRejectreason' =&gt; array(
        'employees_project_id' =&gt; (int)$id,
        'rejectreason_id' =&gt; (int)$rrId
    )
);
if($this-&gt;EmployeesProject-&gt;EmployeesProjectsRejectreason-&gt;save($eprData)) {
    debug('successfully saved EPR with ID '.$this-&gt;EmployeesProject-&gt;EmployeesProjectsRejectreason-&gt;__insertID);
} else {
    debug('could not save EPR with employees_project_id='.$id.' and rejectreason_id='.$rrId);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Now what happens</strong></p>

<p>After I make an attempt to save a record, my debug gives me the following success report:</p>

<pre><code>successfully saved EPR with ID 4
</code></pre>

<p>So the save() call returned true, a new ID was created by the auto_increment function of mySQL. So far so good. But when I check my database, there was no record created. But the auto_increment_counter was increased by 1, as if a record was stored, but it wasn't.</p>

<p>Running the app with debug-level 2, I can see the generated SQL-statement from cake, which looks perfectly fine to me:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO `employees_projects_rejectreasons` (`employees_project_id`, `rejectreason_id`) VALUES (3, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>If I run this statement directly on the sql server, the record ist inserted correctly.</p>

<p><strong>What I already tried</strong></p>

<p>I already tried different approaches with the save procedure. I tried working with setters instead of a data-array:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;EmployeesProject-&gt;EmployeesProjectsRejectreason-&gt;set('employees_project_id', $id);
</code></pre>

<p>as well, but it made no difference. After I wrote a custom save-method in the <em>EmployeesProjectsRejectreason-Model</em>, calling it from the controller, but it always produced the same result.</p>

<p>I tried </p>

<ul>
<li>deleting the model-cache</li>
<li>restarting the server-instances and the server itself</li>
<li>Deleting the table and creating it again</li>
<li>disabling validation in the model</li>
<li>removing the unique foreign-key index</li>
<li>Saving with hard-coded and existing ids as foreign key</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some more strange behaviour</strong></p>

<p>The last tests with hard-coded IDs in my controller code confronted me with more riddles: If I try storing existent foreign_key-IDs, the data is not saved as before. But if both IDs are hardcoded and NOT EXISTING (I used invented IDs 345 AND 567, which are definetely not existing in the database) a record was finally inserted!</p>

<p>Moreover I scaffolded Models, Views and Controllers for the new tables. When I run the scaffolded view ""myApp/employees_projects_rejectreasons/add"" and add a new record, everything works just fine.</p>

<p>I'm just not able to save the record from other controllers. Since I already have a huge headache, solving this problem, I highly appreciate any hint for a solution!!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance guys!</p>

<p>We have set the authentication to Integrated Windows Authentication; anonymous access is turned off and I am not using impersonation. The asp.net app sits in an intranet, but I have no control (and very little knowledge) of how many domains there are, how they interact with each other etc.etc. According to the article above I should get the same user information for all three of:</p>

<pre><code>Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity
HttpContext.Current.User.Identity
Request.LogonUserIdentity
</code></pre>

<p>I <strong>do</strong> get the correct user, but the casing is different from the AD name. So my question is: if </p>

<pre><code>Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity
</code></pre>

<p>(which is what I am using) gives the right AD name, but displays a different casing to AD, is that most likely an issue with Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity, with the intranet/domain settings, or differences between IIS 6 &amp; IIS 7?</p>

<p>(apologies for the vague nature of this question: I'm just trying to look for suggestions as where best to look and/or input as to whether there is something inherently unwise about using Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity).</p>

<p>I should be getting DOMAIN\username for IIS 6 as well, so no difference there. Could the issue be related to how Kerberos/NTLM interact with IIS?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #2:</strong> The problem can be summarised thus:</p>

<p>I am displayed as e.g. DOMAIN\joebloggs in AD. I logged in as joebloggs. But the credentials I get back from a (successful) authentication using Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity show DOMAIN\JoeBloggs. Where could that be coming from?</p>

Maybe it's just the lack of sufficient English skills (as English is not my native language) or this is one of the things you confront in a programmer's life which are so simple, that it takes a genius to understand them (at first).</p>

<p>I've read the translation of 'migrate' in my native language, read the definition of <code>migration</code> on Wikipedia and read <a href=""http://south.aeracode.org/wiki/About#TheIdea"" rel=""nofollow"">""the idea</a>"" of django-south, citing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With South, you install it and then
  give one or more of your apps some
  migrations (either writing them by
  hand, or autogenerating them from your
  model definitions). When you syncdb,
  you'll only sync apps that don't have
  migrations (things like
  django.contrib.auth, for example,
  which have a fixed schema), and then
  when you run ./manage.py migrate,
  South kicks in and does the
  migrations. Intelligently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is confusing and I still don't understand the whole thing behind ""migration of django applications"" or ""migration in general"". I'd understand if I'd know how to interpret the word <code>migration</code></p>

<p><strong>You get the point, I hope.</strong></p>

<p>Have patience with me, but I'd really like to know. So maybe one of you could explain me, please.</p>

Currently I'm using <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/io/api-release/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html#iterateFiles"" rel=""nofollow""><code>FileUtils.iterateFiles</code></a> from Apache Commons-IO. This seems to work by loading the whole list into memory, which is slow (delaying the application startup time) and a <strong>huge</strong> memory hog (around 8GB). I was previously using my own recursive file iterator which had the same problem. </p>

<p>I only need to process one file at a time (or, down the track, a handful from the front of the list in parallel), so it seems a little unnecessary to waste all this time and memory loading a complete list into memory. </p>

<p>Java's <code>Iterator</code> class allows for minimal-memory footprint iterators of the kind that I need, but since the native features of the <code>java.io.File</code> class only provide eagerly-initialized arrays, it seems to be bizarrely difficult to take advantage of these.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can traverse the file hierarchy without loading it all into memory in advance? </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/10691278/1711188"">this answer</a> I'm  now aware of the new Java 7 file API, which I think would solve my problem, but Java 7 is not really an option for me at this stage.</p>

<pre><code>byte[] input = { 0xFF, 0xFc, 0x00, 0x00 }

<p>You can use <code>Buffer.BlockCopy</code> to copy bytes from one array to another, regardless of type.  So, I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>uint[] output = new uint[1];

<p>This will copy the bytes from input to output, converting them from an array of bytes to an array of uints along the way.</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>BlockCopy</code> interprets the bytes with little endianness.  I need a copy that uses big endianness.  So rather than getting a uint value of 4294705152 (0xFFFC0000), like I need, I get the value 64767 (0x0000FCFF).  Note that this is a bare-bones example, I cannot easily reverse the order of the bytes in my actual application.</p>

"10117288","1","","","2012-04-12 04:15:36","","0","444","<p>I'm trying to do something a little clever with my app. I have a table, Adverts - which contains info on cars: model, mileage etc. The table is related to a few other tables via foreign keys e.g. model name is retrieved through a foreign key linking to a ""VehicleModels"" table etc.</p>

<p>Within the app's ""Entities"" dir (classes which map to tables in the database) I have one for the Adverts table, Advert.cs. This has a couple of properties which EF has been told to ignore (in fluent api) as they don't map to actual fields in the Adverts table.</p>

<p>The idea behind these fields is to store the calculated distance from a postcode (zip code) the user enters in a search form which filters through the Adverts table if they only want to see cars available within a certain radius. e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Advert&gt; FilteredAdverts = repository.Adverts
.Where(am =&gt; mfr == """" || am.Manufacturer == mfr) &amp;&amp;
    (am =&gt; model == etc etc...)
</code></pre>

<p>Later on, to calculate the distance the code resembles:</p>

<pre><code>if (userPostcode != null) {
    foreach (var ap in FilteredAdverts.ToList()) {
        distmiles = //calculate distance in miles
        distkm = //calculate distance in km

        ap.DistanceMiles = Convert.ToInt32(distmiles);
        ap.DistanceKm = Convert.ToInt32(distkm);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm having is that in order to assign values to these two fields, I'm having to use .ToList() which is pulling all rows from the table. Works ok if there are only a few rows, but when there are ~1,000 it takes approx. 2.2 seconds, when I increased it to about 12,000 rows it took 32 seconds for the page to load when no filters were applied i.e. all active adverts returned.</p>

<p>The reason I'm pulling all adverts before calling .Skip and .Take to display them is that the filters available in the search form are based on possible options of all current adverts that are active i.e. have time remaining, rather than just selecting a list of manufacturers from the manufacturers table (where a user could choose a manufacturer for which there are no search results). e.g.</p>

<pre><code>VehicleManufacturers = (from vm in FilteredAdverts.Select(x =&gt; x.VehicleManufacturer).Distinct().OrderBy(x =&gt; x)
    select new SearchOptionsModel
    {
            Value = vm,
            Text = vm,
            Count = FilteredAdvertsVM.Where(x =&gt; x.VehicleManufacturer == vm).Count(),
    })

    .... filters for model, mileage etc
</code></pre>

<p>To get an idea of what I'm trying to achieve - take a look at the search form on the Autotrader website.</p>

<p>Once all the filters are applied, just before the model is passed to the view, .Skip and .Take are applied, but of course by this time all rows have been pulled.</p>

<p>My question is, how do I go about redoing this? Is there a better method to make use of these non-mapped properties in my Advert entity class? I'm working on my home PC - C2D @ 3.4GHz, 2GB ram - would the slow queries run ok on a propert web host ?</p>

<pre><code>_windsor.Register(Component.For&lt;IProductServices&gt;().ImplementedBy&lt;ProductServices&gt;().Interceptors(typeof(SomeInterceptorType));
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, when I ask for a IProductServices  windsor will proxy the interface to intercept  the interface method calls.
If instead I do this :</p>

<pre><code>_windsor.Register(Component.For&lt;ProductServices&gt;().Interceptors(typeof(SomeInterceptorType));
</code></pre>

<p>then I cant ask for windsor to resolve IProductServices, instead I ask for ProductServices and it will return a dynamic subclass that will intercept virtual method calls.
Of course the dynamic subclass still implements 'IProductServices'</p>

<p>My question is : Can I register the Interface component like the first case, and get the subclass proxy like in the second case?. </p>

<p>There are two reasons  for me wanting this:<br>
1 - Because the code that is going to resolve cannot know about the ProductServices class, only about the IProductServices interface.
2 - Because some event invocations that pass the sender as a parameter, will pass the ProductServices object, and in the first case this object is a field on the dynamic proxy, not the real object returned by windsor. Let me give an example of how this can complicate things : Lets say I have a custom collection that does something when their items notify a property change:</p>

<pre><code>private void ItemChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        int senderIndex = IndexOf(sender);
        SomeActionOnItemIndex(senderIndex);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This code will fail if I added an interface proxy, because the sender will be the field in the interface proxy and the IndexOf(sender) will return -1.</p>

<ul>
<li>sex (true/false)</li>
<li>demographic classification (A, B, C etc)</li>
<li>place of birth</li>
<li>date of birth</li>
<li>weight (recorded daily):  The fact that is being recorded</li>
</ul>

<p>My requirements are to be able to run 'OLAP' queries that allow me to:</p>

<ul>
<li>'slice and dice'</li>
<li>'drill up/down' the data and </li>
<li>generally, be able to view the data from different perspectives</li>
</ul>

<p>After reading up on this topic area, the general consensus seems to be that this is best implemented using dimension tables rather than normalized tables.</p>

<p>Assuming that this assertion is true (i.e. the solution is best implemented using fact and dimension tables), I would like to seek some help in the design of these tables.</p>

<p>'Natural' (or obvious) dimensions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Date dimension</li>
<li>Geographical location</li>
</ul>

<p>Which have hierarchical attributes. However, I am struggling with how to model the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>sex (true/false)</li>
<li>demographic classification (A, B, C etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason I am struggling with these fields is that:</p>

<ol>
<li>They have no obvious hierarchical attributes which will aid aggregation (AFAIA) - which suggest they should be in a fact table</li>
<li>They are mostly static or very rarely change - which suggests they should be in a dimension table.</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe the heuristic I am using above is too crude?</p>

<p>I will give some examples on the type of analysis I would like to carryout on the data warehouse - hopefully that will clarify things further. </p>

<p>I would like to aggregate and analyze the data by sex and demographic classification - e.g. answer questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does male and female weights compare across different demographic classifications?</li>
<li>Which demographic classification (male AND female), show the most increase in weight this quarter.</li>
</ul>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Can anyone clarify whether sex and demographic classification are part of the fact table, or whether they are (as I suspect) dimension tables.?</p>

<p>Also assuming they are dimension tables, could someone elaborate on the table structures (i.e. the fields)?</p>

<p>The 'obvious' schema:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE sex_type (is_male int);
CREATE TABLE demographic_category (id int, name varchar(4));
</code></pre>

<p>may not be the correct one.</p>

<p>New updates:
 I use chrome and in the Network tab, it says there is an internal server error and the initiator is jquery.min.js:16. I do not undersand this information. Does this contain some information in it?</p>

<p>If I change from POST to GET, the query parameters can be recieved by the server. But if I use POST, the query parameters cannot be posted. How can explain it?</p>

<pre><code>public class Printer {

    protected void cooldown(long ms) {
        // ???
    }

    public synchronized void print(String str) {
        System.out.println(str);
        cooldown(1000);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like three calls to <code>print()</code> to print the three values each one second apart. While this could be done fairly easily with <code>Thread.currentThread().sleep(ms)</code>, the catch is that I would like the calling thread to continue its execution. To clarify, given the following example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    final Printer p = new Printer();

    new Thread(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            p.print(""foo"");
            System.out.println(""running foo"");
        }
    }).start();

    new Thread(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            p.print(""bar"");
            System.out.println(""running bar"");
        }
    }).start();    
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like <strong>foo</strong>, <strong>running foo</strong>, and <strong>running bar</strong> to print immediately (in any order), followed by <strong>bar</strong> a second later. Does anybody know of a good approach to get this kind of functionality? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The <code>Printer</code> class is the simplest example of this issue that I could think of, but in reality, this class will have a variety of methods that all require a shared cooldown. Calling one of these methods will delay execution of the others during that time. The class might even have subclasses with methods that share this same cooldown. </p>

<p>In Chrome, this works fine.  In Opera, the page action doesn’t appear.  Debugging shows that <code>show(tabId)</code> is called, and doesn’t throw an error.  But the page action doesn’t appear.  Since Opera extensions are (for these purposes) the same as Chrome extensions, I don’t understand why there’s a difference, and how I can overcome it.  Is there a way that I can have a page action on my options page?</p>

I have a little script in PHP which reads a table from a MySQL database and provides the values of a single column as a drop-down list. The PHP code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method=""post"" action=""&lt;?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?&gt;""&gt;
&lt;?php
    $dbc = mysql_connect(""localhost"", ""someDBuser"", ""somecorrectpass"");
    $db = mysql_select_db(""someDB"");
    $results= mysql_query(""SELECT name FROM sometable"");
?&gt;
&lt;select name=""eventid""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""0""&gt;Choose&lt;/OPTION&gt;
    &lt;?php
        while($row = mysql_fetch_array($results)) {
            echo '&lt;option value=""'.$row['name'].'""&gt;'. $row['name'].'&lt;/option&gt;';
        }
    ?&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I call the file from the browser, I get a Blank Screen. I enabled PHP Error reporting and get the following error <code>Fatal error: Call to undefined function mysql_connect() in /var/www/html/testdel.php on line 12</code>.</p>

<p>Next I tried running the file in the backend using the PHP command. It ran fine and gave me the required html output like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ php /var/www/html/testdel.php
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method=""post"" action=""/var/www/html/testdel.php""&gt;
&lt;select name=""eventid""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""0""&gt;Choose&lt;/OPTION&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Ex1005""&gt;Ex1005&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""Ex1009""&gt;Ex1009&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""user1""&gt;user1&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt; 
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And when I put this output in a file (say ""testdel.html"", for example), I get the correct output.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong in the original PHP file? Is it something related to permissions? The current file permissions are 644. Or do I need to include(use) some module?</p>

Is it possible to use the same ? and use $(this) so it updates the field they are currently in ?</p>

<pre><code>IV. Miss Taylor's Working Bee

""So you must. Well, then, here goes!"" Mr. Dyce swung her up to his shoulder and went, two steps at a time, in through the crowd of girls, so that he arrived there first when the door was opened. There in the hall stood Miss Mary Taylor, as pretty as a pink.

""I heard there was to be a bee here this afternoon, and I've brought Phronsie; that's my welcome,"" he announced.

""See, I've got a bag,"" announced Phronsie from her perch, and holding it forth.

So the bag was admired, and the girls trooped in, going up into Miss Mary's pretty room to take off their things. And presently the big library, with the music-room adjoining, was filled with the gay young people, and the bustle and chatter began at once.

""I should think you'd be driven wild by them all wanting you at the same minute."" Mr. Dyce, having that desire at this identical time, naturally felt a bit impatient, as Miss Mary went about inspecting the work, helping to pick out a stitch here and to set a new one there, admiring everyone's special bit of prettiness, and tossing a smile and a gay word in every chance moment between.

""Oh, no,"" said Miss Mary, with a little laugh, ""they're most of them my Sunday- school scholars, you know.""

what traffic is sent/ received and from whom.</p>

<p>as for my current understanding  when a client tries to address a server, a request to a 3rd party is being done(<strong>a new stream to a new address</strong>), this is the ocsp responder which gets his information from the certificate authority who issued the certificate.
then a feedback returns which is an ocsp response what matches the RFC.</p>

<p>2 questions</p>

<ul>
<li>is the stream for the 3rd party always done over http ore is it done
over ssl to ? if it is done over ssl how can I recognize it?</li>

<p>In those examples have another configuration that enable spring-social, but this configuration is already set up by spring-social-config, such configuration is something like:</p>

<pre><code>@Configuration
@EnableSocial
public class SocialConfig extends SocialConfigurerAdapter {

<p>Should I enable such configuration and implement UserConnectionRepository as my rest service client??</p>

<p>In case of emergency, we can quickly boot a new server and transfer files there. But the question is: will it work then? Let's assume we have the same Cassandra versions on both old and the new server, and the same OS version. <strong>Is it enough to simply transfer the whole /var/lib/cassandra folder</strong>? As you understand, backups is a critical thing so I want to be sure everything will be ok.</p>

<p>(we currently are using dsc2.0 package from the Ubuntu's repos)</p>

<p>Yes, running a 'normal' cluster with 2-3 nodes would be a better choice, I know. Both performance and reliability would increase. But for now we have what we have - it's a single node. And for some reasons  right now we will not switch to a multinode cluster.</p>

<p>I have researched this before and came to the conclusion that for good memory practice you should use this method:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""controllerBackground"" ofType:@""png"" inDirectory:@""""];

[self.view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor colorWithPatternImage:[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:path]]];
</code></pre>

<p>When using the other method:</p>

<pre><code>[self.view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor colorWithPatternImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""controllerBackground.png""]]];
</code></pre>

<p>This is not as efficient as using the imageWithContentsOfFile:path method.</p>

<p>However when testing both these methods using the performance tools ""leak"" monitor, I observed a very unusual thing happening.</p>

<p>While using the <code>imageWithContentsOfFile:path</code> method, the problem was that when going back and forth within a navigation controller loading the view controller, the memory would keep increasing within the vicinity of approximately 1mb every time the view controller loads.</p>

<p>This problem is also only observed in the new iOS 4.1 and 4. It does not seem to happen in the iOS 3.0 or 3.2.</p>

<p>And everything works great when I submit the form to the server using FF.  But a problem occurs with IE8.  IE is showing the security bar saying that I'm trying to download a file to the computer, which is exactly reverse of what I'm doing ( I'm uploading a file)! </p>

<p>How can I prevent triggering this security bar?</p>

<p>--EDIT December 18th, 2010 16:48 EST--
Is it possible that it can be caused by this: (comming from the EXTJS basicForm documentation)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>File uploads are not performed using normal 'Ajax' techniques, that is they are not performed using XMLHttpRequests. Instead the form is submitted in the standard manner with the DOM  element temporarily modified to have its target  set to refer to a dynamically generated, hidden  which is inserted into the document but removed after the return data has been gathered. The server response is parsed by the browser to create the document for the IFRAME. If the server is using JSON to send the return object, then the Content-Type header must be set to ""text/html"" in order to tell the browser to insert the text unchanged into the document body. Characters which are significant to an HTML parser must be sent as HTML entities, so encode ""&lt;"" as ""&lt;"", ""&amp;"" as ""&amp;"" etc. The response text is retrieved from the document, and a fake XMLHttpRequest object is created containing a responseText property in order to conform to the requirements of event handlers and callbacks. Be aware that file upload packets are sent with the content type multipart/form and some server technologies (notably JEE) may require some custom processing in order to retrieve parameter names and parameter values from the packet content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think I understand everything about there explanation...</p>

<p>My idea was to rewrite all URLs that are requested and contain the two-letter country code by simple creating a query string parameter using that country code, for example </p>

<pre><code>https://domain.com/newpage/en -&gt; https://domain.com/newpage?l=en
https://domain.com/newpage/en/about -&gt; https://domain.com/newpage/about?l=en
</code></pre>

<p>This would then be parsed further by rewrite_mod and the final page would be served.</p>

<p>In general, this approach is working, although I noticed strange behavior which depends on whether I use a trailing slash or not.</p>

<p>When I type the following URL into the browser:</p>

<pre><code>https://domain.com/newpage/en/
</code></pre>

<p>everything is fine and I get served the English version of the page.</p>

<p>However, when I leave the trailing slash out:</p>

<pre><code>https://domain.com/newpage/en
</code></pre>

<p>The address changes to</p>

<pre><code>https://domain.com/newpage/en/?l=en
</code></pre>

<p>The rule I use is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule /newpage/(en|pl|fi)(/?)(.*) /newpage/$3?l=$1 [QSA,S=1]
</code></pre>

<p>These are the logs from rewrite_mod that show the difference between the two cases:</p>

<pre><code>https://domain.com/en
(2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /newpage/en/
(3) applying pattern '/newpage/(en|pl|fi)(/?)(.*)' to uri '/newpage/en/'
(2) rewrite '/newpage/en/' -&gt; '/newpage/?l=en'
(3) split uri=/newpage/?l=en -&gt; uri=/newpage/, args=l=en&amp;l=en
(2) prefixed with document_root to /var/www/newpage/index.php
(1) go-ahead with /var/www/newpage/index.php [OK]

https://domain.com/en/
(2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /newpage/en/
(3) applying pattern '/newpage/(en|pl|fi)(/?)(.*)' to uri '/newpage/en/'
(2) rewrite '/newpage/en/' -&gt; '/newpage/?l=en'
(3) split uri=/newpage/?l=en -&gt; uri=/newpage/, args=l=en
(2) prefixed with document_root to /var/www/newpage/index.php
(1) go-ahead with /var/www/newpage/index.php [OK]
</code></pre>

<p>The two are almost exactly the same except for the 'split' message, which in the first case shows the extra l=en parameter.</p>

<p>What is even more odd, is that if I disable mod_rewrite, the behavior doesn't stop, i.e. typing in</p>

<pre><code>https://domain.com/newpage/en
</code></pre>

<p>changes the address to</p>

<pre><code>https://domain.com/newpage/en/?l=en
</code></pre>

<p>and produces error 404. I get the same error when I go to </p>

<pre><code>https://domain.com/newpage/en/
</code></pre>

<p>but the address in the browser doesn't change. The Apache logs don't say anything about that.</p>

<p>Where does the extra parameter come from, if it's not mod_rewrite? How to get rid of it?</p>

I have a table with keys from a reference table and I want to avoid using a loop to select the records without having duplicates.

<p>Mode(1-5) are ModeIDs</p>

<pre><code>struct Rz3DContourNode {

  float y;   //pos y
  float z;  //pos z
  float nx;  //normal x
  float ny;  //normal y

<p>I store list of vertices in STL vector as follows :</p>

<pre><code>std::vector &lt; Rz3DContourNode &gt;  nodes;

<pre><code>glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, 12, &amp;nodes[0]);

  //Skip normal positions

  ptr++;
  ptr++;

<p>The values does not equal if I directly access values from the struct.</p>

<p>Does this means struct does not save the values contiguously ?</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT] I Just noticed that using sizeof() instead of 12 fix the problem as follows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Rz3DContourNode), &amp;nodes[0]);

<p>I've traced this up to:
wxPyCoreAPIPtr = (wxPyCoreAPI*)PyCObject_Import(""wx.<em>core</em>"", ""_wxPyCoreAPI"");</p>

<p>So I'm guessing that this is failing because its trying to dlopen a .so that has already been loaded (the core wxwidgets library that is needed both by C and Python code). I can get the handle to the opened .so via dlopen's RTLD_NOLOAD flag.</p>

<p>Is there any way to give that handle to Python and tell it to ""load"" that handle into the interpreter's context?</p>

<p>Edit: just noticed, this problem is reproducible in the ""embedded"" sample in wxPython, using wxWidgets origin/WX_3_0_BRANCH, Python 2.7, wxPython origin/master.</p>

<p>I want my data picker to default to the [0]th item of the data source array for that textField.  Currently, I can see no consistency as to how the selected array item is chosen when the pickerView is loaded.

<p>Here is the code for the pickerViews:</p>

<pre><code>func numberOfComponentsInPickerView(pickerView: UIPickerView) -&gt; Int {
    return 1
}

func pickerView(pickerView: UIPickerView, numberOfRowsInComponent component: Int) -&gt; Int {

<p>What's weird - they're creating a <code>Greeting</code> representation class in the client app (second link ref) for storing the GET response (the <code>greeting</code>method on server side returns a <code>Greeting</code> object). But the <code>Greeting</code> classes on the server and client side are different classes - well, they are two distinct classes with identical names, identical field names and types (client's doesn't have a constructor).</p>

<p>Does it mean I have to similarly rewrite the class from stratch when building the client app? In order to do that, I'd need specs on what are the fields' types of JSON-packed objects passed by server's app. A server serializes the object of class ABCClass to JSON and sends it to client. Even if some field called 'abc' has value 10, it doesn't make it an integer. Next time it might contain a string.</p>

<p>My question is - how much information from server app's devs do I need in order to create a client application? How is it usually done?</p>

So, I have created my shape to handle the two columns as TEXT's. I had no problem. But, When I tried to use Radio Buttons. I have started to have issued.
Bellow are my layout's and my classes.</p>

<p>Shape Layout : </p>

<pre><code> &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
 &lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
  android:layout_width=""match_parent""
android:orientation=""horizontal""
android:layout_height=""match_parent""&gt;
&lt;RadioGroup
    android:layout_width=""0dp""
    android:layout_weight=""4""
    android:layout_height=""50dp""
    android:orientation=""horizontal""
    android:gravity=""center""
    android:id=""@+id/CHOOSING_ABSENCE""&gt;
    &lt;RadioButton
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:id=""@+id/present""/&gt;
    &lt;RadioButton
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:id=""@+id/absence""/&gt;

          &lt;/RadioGroup&gt;

&lt;TextView
    android:paddingRight=""10dp""
    android:layout_width=""0dp""
    android:layout_weight=""5""
    android:gravity=""center_vertical""
    android:text=""TEST""
    android:textColor=""@android:color/black""
    android:id=""@+id/Student_name""
    android:layout_height=""50dp"" /&gt;
     &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think I have a problem in here. </p>

<p>The second class is my Custom class:</p>

<pre><code> public class ListViewStudentEditAbsence {
private  String StudentName ;
private String StudentID ;
private int Absence  ;

public ListViewStudentEditAbsence(String StudentName, String  StudentID, String Absence )
{
    this.StudentName = StudentName ;
    this.StudentID = StudentID;
    if(Absence == ""0"")
        this.Absence = 0  ;
    else
        this.Absence = 1  ;

}


public int getAbsence() {
    return Absence;
}

public void setAbsence(int absence) {
    Absence = absence;
}

public String getStudentID() {
    return StudentID;
}

public void setStudentID(String studentID) {
    StudentID = studentID;
}

public String getStudentName() {
    return StudentName;
}


public void setStudentName(String studentName)
{
    StudentName = studentName;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>My Adapter is as the followings : </p>

<pre><code> public class ListViewStudentEditAbsenceAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;ListViewStudentEditAbsence&gt;
  {

private Context mContext;
private ArrayList&lt;ListViewStudentEditAbsence&gt; mData;


public ListViewStudentEditAbsenceAdapter (Context mContext, ArrayList&lt;ListViewStudentEditAbsence&gt; mData) {
    super(mContext, R.layout.student_name_editing, mData);
    this.mContext = mContext;
    this.mData = new ArrayList&lt;ListViewStudentEditAbsence&gt;();
    this.mData.addAll(mData);
}

@Override
public int getCount() {
    return mData.size();
}

@Override
public long getItemId(int position) {
    return position;
}

@Override
public View getView(final int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)
{
    if (convertView == null) {
        LayoutInflater mInflater = (LayoutInflater)
                mContext.getSystemService(Activity.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        convertView = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.student_name_editing, null);
    }
    TextView Name  = (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.Student_name);
    Name.setText(mData.get(position).getStudentName());
/*
    RadioGroup Absence  = (RadioGroup) convertView.findViewById(R.id.CHOOSING_ABSENCE);
    Absence.setText(mData.get(position).getAbsence());
  */
    return convertView;
}
 }

<p>As you can see I committed handling the radio button because I couldn't solve this issue. </p>

Once the user clicks an article a new view controller comes up and displays that article in full through a scroll view. This works fine in whatever orientation.</p>

I believe it's explained my course textbook, <em>""Computer Organization &amp; Architecture: Themes and Variations""</em>, but I currently cannot afford the textbook.</p>

<p>Here's the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each of the following numbers, state the base in use; that is,
  what are the values of <code>r</code>, <code>s</code>, and <code>t</code>?</p>

  <li><p><code>1011_t = 4931_10</code></p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I recognize it's similar to solving an equation. I'm guessing I have to find <code>r</code>, <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> and they will be a specific base that matches the base ten number.
I tried searching online for similar questions but I'm not sure what to search for so I have no clue where to start for solving these equations.</p>

<p>I'm looking for best way to work dev environment and live server. My setup now is to use composer and GitHub for Mac locally to work on projects on my Mac. I then use <a href=""https://github.com/heyday/beam"" rel=""nofollow"">Beam</a> to deploy to live server.</p>

<p>The issue I'm having is I can't commit SS modules to my repo for the project. Using GitHub for Mac, and it says 'failed to add <em>module-name</em> to index'. I'm still not clear on why this is happening. Because they're submodules with git?</p>

<p>So what I do is use Beam to deploy things like theme, custom code to live server, then from live server I login and run composer to install and update modules. It would be ideal if I could just push everything from my dev server live, and not have to login and run composer commands on live server. This would also help for client sites that don't have composer installed on crappy shared hosting.</p>

<p>So is there a workaround or better method for deploying to live servers I am unaware of?</p>

These two libpalo dlls are not necessarily COM components/assemblies. So they can't be added directly as a reference.</p>

<p>Instead I have to place them in the same folder as the Jedox..dll
In normal appls, forms etc the folder is Debug/bin. But in webapps, where should I place these dll files, since it has to be in the same folder as the Jedox...dll</p>

<p>Also, creating a new folder bin, and putting all three dlls there and adding references doesn't work for some reason!

Given a getter Symbol I would like to find the corresponding setter Symbol.</p>

<p>Long version:</p>

<p>Below is a little utility class for Scala Reflection. </p>

<p>I plan to use this class to deep copy Hibernate Entities (subclasses of the abstract class <code>UUIDEntity</code>).</p>

<p>I divide the deep copy into two parts, 1) value copy each object in the object graph 2) connect the isolated copies to form a cloned object graph. This question only deals with the first part.</p>

<p>Let <code>root</code> be an Entity. </p>

<p>First, I want to create a value copy of <code>root</code>, let's call this <code>copy</code>. Value copy means that I only fill up the value fields in the copy (see definition of value fields below).</p>

<p>This should happen in the <code>getValueCopy</code> method. </p>

<p>There is val <code>copy</code> but its fields are still empty after creating it with <code>val copy= constructorMirror.apply()</code>  </p>

<p>So I need to copy the fields from <code>root</code> into <code>copy</code>. For this I need to get the setters and getters of the fields (more precisely, value fields which are fields that refer to value classes like Int, String, Long etc.). </p>

<p>So far I managed to find the getters for value fields (<code>valueGetters</code>), however, my problem is that I want to find the corresponding setters. But I don't really know what is the best way to pair up the setters with the getters? </p>

<p>Is using the method names the only way to go? That is what I would naively do but my feeling tells me that there must be a better way.</p>

<p>Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks for reading.</p>

What I mean is say there is process a.exe that I have started that has a thread with id 123. If another process is started, for example b.exe, will the process id be 123? In other words do process and thread identifiers ever collide? Thanks
<br>
<br></p>

<p>EDIT: It appears that process and thread ids come from the same pool called the PspCidTable. A hacker named Polynomial who reviewed the windows nt source says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The kernel needs to be able to generate a sequence of process and
  thread IDs that are unique across the whole system. To efficiently and
  safely do this, the kernel creates a pool of IDs that can be used for
  both processes and threads. This pool is exported in the kernel as a
  HANDLE_TABLE object called PspCidTable. During Phase0 startup of the
  system, the PspInitPhase0 function is called. This function creates a
  HANDLE_TABLE object using ExCreateHandleTable, which automatically
  populates the table with 65536 entires. Each entry is a 16-bit
  unsigned integer (at least it is on a 32-bit OS) stored inside a list
  item object that is part of a doubly linked list. Both process and
  thread IDs come from the PspCidTable pool.</p>
</blockquote>

I'll try to explain my problem that I want to resolve this since many days.</p>

<p>I'll try to explain this with some code.</p>

<p>I have this method search in cpp:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; 
#include &lt;HDTManager.hpp&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace hdt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
// Load HDT file
    HDT *hdt = HDTManager::mapHDT(""/storage/emulated/0/Download/linkedmdb.hdt"");

// Enumerate all triples matching a pattern ("""" means any)

IteratorTripleString *it = hdt-&gt;search("""","""",""Batman"");
    while(it-&gt;hasNext()){
            TripleString *triple = it-&gt;next();
            cout &lt;&lt; ""Result: "" &lt;&lt; triple-&gt;getSubject() &lt;&lt; "", "" &lt;&lt; triple&gt;getPredicate() &lt;&lt; "", "" &lt;&lt; triple-&gt;getObject() &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    delete it;
    delete hdt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I have a static library with extension "".a"" that contains all the headers and code on which search.cpp depends.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my questions is if you can help me to create a Java class that uses this method from a native call, so i can read a lot of pages and i can`t do that. I think that i have to create this method in a cpp file in a jni folder into the Android project and create a Android.mk which uses the static library ""libhdt.a"", this create a shared library "".so"" that can be used by the Android code using the loadLibrary method.</p>

<p>Another problem is how to load the library that contains the data what i have to search, is located in the storage of the movile phone, i´m talking about this code line:</p>

It consists of an array which holds X's and O's, will not allow the same spot selection twice, and the computer turn is based off a random number generated which is still open in the array.</p>

<p>My only issues left are what to do when a winner is declared (computer or human).</p>

<p>At that point, I will need to end the JavaScript running the game until the user chooses to reset the board and start again.</p>

<p>This entails two details that I am struggling with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I need the sectors of the tic tac toe board to become ""unclickable"" or to not register anymore clicks once the winner is declared. Currently even after a game is decided to be won or lost, if there are empty spaces left over then the user can continue to mark those spaces on the board.</p></li>
<li><p>Solving the above should help in part to solve this problem, but it might also be nice to completely stop the game overall once the game's winner is declared. Currently, again because the user can continue clicking open spaces if they exist, the counter (which counts wins for the user) will continue to increment as long as there exists a win on the board. Again though, by solving problem 1, transitively solve this problem as well since the clicks don't work and thereby the counter will not be incremented.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Drag and dropping collection view cell into collection view manually from the object library. (fails: doesn't let me drop the cell anywhere in my view)</li>
<li>Creating my collection view with cells in storyboard and copy-pasting the whole view into nib. (fails: collection view is copied but the cell is gone)</li>
<li>Creating my collection view with cells in storyboard, opening the storyboard as source code, finding my collection view cells, copying the relevant XML, opening my nib as source code, pasting it inside my collection view in XML. (fails: unable to open the nib in Interface Builder, it gives errors. When I remove the cell from source code, it opens again. Do <em>not</em> try this if you don't know what you are doing.)</li>

<p>They all point out to doing them programatically and/or using another nib for the cell. I know how to do them, but is there any way to design the collection view cell, inside a collection view <em>inside the same view</em> in a nib, just as in storyboard?

<p>It's very useful and highly customizable because you can use the HTML elements that you defined as tooltips and very quick to init; you only have to define the id of the element that you want to use as a tooltip in the trigger element's rel property.</p>

<p>I am using a lot of different divs so this really helps me a lot.</p>

<p>There was just a little problem. I want it to follow the mouse not have static position.</p>

<p>I've added something at the end:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).mousemove(function (e) {
    amouseX = e.pageX - 30;
    amouseY = e.pageY + 20;
    $("".tooltip"").css({ left: amouseX + ""px"", top: amouseY + ""px"" });
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>and this to the displayballoontip(obj, e)</p>

<pre><code>dropmenuobj.x = amouseX
dropmenuobj.y = amouseY
</code></pre>

<p>and changed every visibility:hidden to display:none in the code. because after i've added these, tooltip caused some scrolling issues in browser display:none fixed them.</p>

<p>but now I have some problems with internet explorer. It does not work well in many different ways like: i can see tooltip moving from somewhere to mouse on the screen, tooltips don't disappear immediately onmouseout.</p>

<p>here is the code with everything i've done:</p>

<pre><code>var disappeardelay=0  //tooltip disappear delay (in miliseconds)
var verticaloffset=0 //vertical offset of tooltip from anchor link, if any
var enablearrowhead=0 //0 or 1, to disable or enable the arrow image

<p>BranchA has SubmoduleY at revision 'abc', BranchB has SubmoduleY at revision 'def'.</p>

<p>Say I want to merge BranchA into BranchB, but I want to leave BranchB's SubmoduleY pointing to its original revision of 'def'. I see a couple ways of doing this:</p>

<p>Method 1:</p>

<ol>
<li>Checkout BranchB.</li>
<li>Move SubmoduleY to revision 'abc' to make the actual merge painless (we don't want to do any merging at the submodule level right now). </li>
<li>Commit the new revision for SubmoduleY (we can't have it floating for the merge).</li>
<li>Merge BranchA into BranchB. Resolve any conflicts.</li>
<li>Move SubmoduleY back to revision 'def'.</li>
<li>Commit the new revision for SubmoduleY.</li>
<li>Push changes up to the main repo.</li>
</ol>

<p>Method 2: </p>

<p>Same as method 1, but instead of doing step 6, rebase and get rid of the extra submodule commit from step 3.</p>

<p>Both seem to have annoying drawbacks:</p>

<p>Method 1 puts two extra commits into history.</p>

<p>Method 2 forgets any changes to do with submodule revisions because those commits get removed. Therefore, any merges later on will have to deal with some problems again.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

I have looked at many different solutions for resizing UITextViews to the height of their text, however none of them are solving my problem. My problem is only existing with large posts. When I have a large post, my function that returns the height of the textView should return the maxHeight of the posts before being expanded. This part works. However, when I click my ""Read More"" button, I have a massive amount of white space at the bottom of the full textView. Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>override func tableView(tableView: UITableView, heightForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; CGFloat {
     return heightForTextOfRow(indexPath.row) + PostCell.additionalVertSpaceNeeded
}

func heightForTextOfRow(row: Int) -&gt; CGFloat {
     var textView = UITextView(frame: CGRectMake(0, 0, prototypeTextViewWidth, CGFloat.max))
     let post = data[row]

     textView.text = (post.postText as NSString).stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet(NSCharacterSet.whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet())
     textView.textContainer.lineFragmentPadding = 0
     textView.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsetsZero
     textView.font = PostCell.textViewFont
     textView.frame.size = textView.sizeThatFits(CGSizeMake(prototypeTextViewWidth, CGFloat.max))
     if textView.frame.size.height &gt; maxHeight &amp;&amp; !post.seeMore {
         return maxHeight
     } else {
         return textView.frame.size.height
     }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Some explanations of the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>data is an array of Posts (the only thing that is relevant about the class Post in this case is that it has a property postText and seeMore.)</li>
<li>PostCell.textViewFont is a constant in one of my classes that returns the font I am using (System font size 13)</li>
<li>PostCell.additionalVertSpaceNeeded is a constant that returns the height of all other elements in my prototype cell except for the UITextView</li>
<li>prototypeTextViewWidth is defined as tableView.frame.width - 16 (16 is the value of the margins added together)</li>
<li>maxHeight is the max height of a post that does not want to show the full post (currently defined as tableView.frame.height * 0.625 - PostCell.additionalVertSpaceNeeded)</li>
<li>seeMore is a Bool property of Post that tells whether or not to show the full post or whether to show just a portion of the post (true shows full post, false shows a post of height maxHeight)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any help would be appreciated... I have tried many solutions to resizing the UITextView and all have this same problem. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>A typical example looks like:</p>

<pre><code>var schema = {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
        id: { type: 'integer', required: true },
        name: { type: 'string', required: true },
        description: { type: 'string', required: false }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This works well for describing what valid data in a data store should look like, and therefore for validating it (the latter isn't terribly useful—if it's in a store it should be valid already):</p>

<pre><code>var storedData = {
    id: 123,
    name: 'orange',
    description: 'delicious'
};
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work that well for validating input. <code>id</code> is most likely left for the application to generate and not for the user to provide as part of the input. The following input fails validation because it lacks the <code>id</code> which the schema declares to be <code>required</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var inputData = {
    name: 'orange',
    description: 'delicious'
};
</code></pre>

<p><em>Fine,</em> one might say, <em>the schema isn't meant to validate direct input, validation should only occur after the application added an <code>id</code> and the data is what is meant to be stored.</em></p>

<p>If the schema isn't meant to validate direct input, however, what is 1) the point of JavaScript validators running in the browser, presumably being fed direct input and 2) the point of the obviously input-oriented <code>readonly</code> schema feature in the spec?</p>

<p>Ground gets shakier when thinking of properties that can be set once but not updated (like a username), as well as different access levels (e.g. the admin and the owner of the orange should be able to change the <code>description</code>, while for other users it should stay <code>readonly</code>).</p>

<p>What is the best (or at least working) practice to deal with this? A different schema for each use case, like below?</p>

<pre><code>var baseSchema = {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
        id: { type: 'integer', required: true },
        name: { type: 'string', required: true },

<p>I know that the time complexity of my algorithm of is <em>O(2<sup>n</sup>)</em> because a solution in discrete math is that a set n has 2<sup>n</sup> subsets. Is this an acceptable way of evaluating the time complexity of this algorithm(couldn't find a recurrence relation to do this)?</p>

<p> Moving on though, I am still having difficulties of evaluating the space complexity. I am trying to apply what I learned from my last question. In my last question which was on permutations of a String, @ajb said that because of the fact that I store a local string that grows by one on each recursive call, my space complexity is actually <em>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</em>.  </p>

<p><p> I am trying to apply that same here. Lets say my test set is {1,2,3}. To generate the subset {1,2,3}, from my algorithm,  when {1,2,3} is finally printed, these ""subsets"" also exist in memory, - {1}, {}, {1,2},{1],{1,2,3}, {1,2}, meaning its not just a subset that has one less element like in the permutations problem. I also made copies of the leftovers at each round so that one operation in one side won't affect the copy on the other side. This is why I wasn't sure if @ajb's strategy would work here. Would the runtime still be <em>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</em> or would it be something greater?</p>

<p>The <code>'unit'</code> in the code below is of type <code>Unit</code> in my program. It has a property <code>ChildUnits</code> which returns a <code>List&lt;Unit&gt;</code> of the children of the unit.</p>

<p>I can successfully perform operations on the children. Then I check if those children have children, and if they do I can perform operations on them as well.</p>

<p>However, I need to check <strong>all descendants</strong> in case there is more depth than just grandchildren. I had a go with while loops in addition to the code below but it got really messy so I left it out. </p>

<p>This is the code I have reverted back to:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var child in unit.ChildUnits)
{
    //do something here with the child (I know it sounds dodgy).

    bool hasMoreChildren = child.ChildUnits.Count != 0;

    if(hasMoreChildren)
    {
        foreach (var descendant in child.ChildUnits)
        {
            //do something here with the descendant.
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I could just go another level deep as it's relatively rare for a unit to have more depth than that. But that's not a clean solution. </p>

<p>I think I might need to use a graph traversal algorithm and/or recursion perhaps, but I would like some advice on how to solve this problem most efficiently.</p>

We are already using Spring Security 4.0 for authentication and intend to use it for authorization as well.</p>

<p>What makes this complex is the way that authorities are granted to a given user.  In our problem space, a User can found several Companies and hire other Users, making them Employees.  Each User can be an Employee of several Companies.  Some authorities can be granted to a User directly (e.g. canResetOtherUserPassword); other authorities can also be granted by a Company to an Employee based on their Role in the Company (e.g. canOpenProject, canRenameProject).  When performing Company-independent commands, User-specific authorities must be checked by the service layer.  When performing Company-specific commands (e.g. open a project for a company, rename an existing project), Employee-specific authorities must be checked.</p>

<p>Now let's consider these last two commands, which would have the following service signatures:</p>

<pre><code>long openProject(long companyId, String title)
void renameProject(long projectId, String title)
</code></pre>

<p>To control access for the 1st method, the authorization component could retrieve the acting User through the thread-local SecurityContext.authentication, retrieve the Company using the companyId parameter, retrieve the Employee corresponding to the current User, then match Employee-specific authorities against the required canOpenProject authority.</p>

<p>To control access for the 2nd method, the authorization component could again retrieve the acting User through the Thread-local SecurityContext.authentication, retrieve the Project using the projectId, retrieve the owner Company through project.ownerCompanyId, retrieve the Employee corresponding to the current User, then match Employee-specific authorities against the required canRenameProject.</p>

<p>Clearly, this can be done using procedural code, as I just described.  We would prefer to use a declarative approach similar to the @PreAuthorize interceptor that Spring Security already offers, and obviously to write as little code as possible.  We just don't know where to start.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

For example, if a user is not logged in on my add on, he won't have access to my custom functions. </p>

<p>Does any one have any idea what I can do to achieve this? How can I disable custom functions programmatic?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

It's a little app that searches twitter for posts on silverlight and then displays them in a list box. I'm trying to bind a URI from an object to load an image for the item in the list box. That didn't work so I tried a static URI. That didn't work so I tried just making a basic image and setting the source in the XAML to a static URI. That showed the image in the preview window in VS2010 but still no image when I tried to debug. So I thought maybe there's something strange going on that's preventing silverlight from accessing external URIs but I quickly realized that that didn't make any sense because it was successfully getting information from twitter. Anyone have any idea what could be causing this problem? Thanks!</p>

I have a form backing object which mirrors the backend schema (I think JAXB was used to generate the classes). Anyway, one of the fields I need to capture is DOB, which in the form backing object is a single property of type XMLGregorianCalendar</p>

<p>For the most part, html input fields on the form are a 1 to 1 mapping to the property in the form backing object - eg: the html input ""surname"" maps to the String property called ""surname"" in the form backing object (via the getters and setters). Nice :)</p>

<p>But date fields are a bit different. In the form backing object, it is only one property with one getter/setter pair; but on screen we might want to present it as 3 seperate fields - perhaps a drop down for Day, a dropdown for Month and a text box for Year</p>

<p>This type of problem must come up in every web app, regardless of backend technology, and I'm wondering how other people deal with it.</p>

<p>I've got two thoughts:</p>

<p>1) extend my form backing object so that I have properties for dobDay, dobMonth and dobYear, then as part of my validator take the 3 values and set the real DOB property from them. I've done this in the past, it kind of works, but if feels a bit rubbish, especially if the web app has lots of dates.</p>

<p>2) Find or write a jsp taglib that does this magic for me. I can see how this work work when rendering the form - the taglib can be called with the property name in the FBO, it can get the current date value, then can write to the output 3 html fields. But I cant see how the submission would work - something would need to read the 3 html fields and 'glue' them into the real property in the FBO</p>

<p>So, really, its just a call for help - what have other people done with this kind of thing in the past?</p>

<p>Appreciate your thoughts</p>

    dialog.setTitle(title);

    return dialog;

<p>and here is my xml file which I am trying to load:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
android:id=""@+id/loading_dialog_view""
android:layout_width=""match_parent""
android:layout_height=""match_parent""

&lt;ProgressBar

    android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" 
    android:layout_gravity=""center""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>How ever I am getting an error when I try to get my view my application crashes.</p>

<p>I call this dialog fragment like so:</p>

<pre><code>    public void showLoadingDialog(String title, String message) {
    loadingDialogFragment = new LoadingDialogFragment();
    Bundle args = new Bundle();
    args.putString(""title"", title);
    args.putString(""message"", message);
    loadingDialogFragment.setArguments(args);
    loadingDialogFragment.show(fragManager, ""loadingDialog"");
}

public void dismissLoadingDialog() {
    if (loadingDialogFragment != null) {
        loadingDialogFragment.dismiss();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I set the content view of my Dialog in the DialogFragment?</p>

<p>ERROR:</p>

<p>I am working on a project which uses RAD and Websphere . We also use JBOSS Rules for validation. 
I have a flow in the application which loads the JBOSS Rules from the database. The rules  are compiled and .drl is generated and stored in the database. We use workmanager (multithreading)for loading the rules.</p>

<p>When I try to load the rules to memory from application it works fine with start mode in RAD. But gives me hung threads while in debug mode.</p>

<p>Question</p>

<p>If it was something releated to memory or dynamic class generation it should have been there in start mode of RAD also?</p>

<p>Things that I tried
Increase the heap size and -XX:MaxPermsize as I see it is stuck in some class loading. All of the these are not really logical as this does not happen in start mode. But I was just trying.
It is working for some other developers .I compared the my server.xml with them  ,but no luck.
Is there anything that is different with debug mode of rad?
Any suggestion would be appreciated? </p>

It is to check if there are new messages. If there are, another ajax request is done to get ALL of them (which its a crappy implementation but it's just the start).</p>

<p>When using the periodic ajax request every second which shouldn't really be that hard since only an integer is processed the UI in Firefox is quite slow. You have a input field and some letters are missing when typing! In Chrome the performance is quite better and usable.</p>

<p>So, the question is how can I make a periodic small ajax request without freezing the UI? I thought that the ajax requests were made in a separate thread but maybe its in the same as the UI and thats why its so slow. If thats the case, is there a way to make them in a separate thread? If they're already in a separate thread, why it's so slow? What would you suggest to improve it?</p>

<p>The periodic function is just:</p>

<pre><code>function getSize(){
 var result = null;
 var scriptUrl = ""getSize.php"";
 $.ajax({
    url: scriptUrl,
    type: 'get',
    dataType: 'html',
    async: false,
    success: function(data) {
        result = data;
    } 
 });
 return parseInt(result);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>EDIT: OK, I must be blind, theres an async variable in the request! putting it to true seems to make it work in parallel as I wanted making the UI responsive!</p>

<p>So I thought I can simply add a plug-in in wordpress which has all requirements I need to create my map. Unfortunately this wasn't the case as all creators I messaged told me that their plug-in is not able to fulfil my tasks. </p>

<p>I hope somebody in the community can help me out here. I would also pay for the implementation of such functionalities on my website and, if wanted, I place your name or the name of your company on my website. But if nobody has time to do this I would be happy to get at least info how to do this in detail.</p>

<p>Now I want to explain what the map should be able to do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It should be able to let me import self-made shapefiles. It can be happen that this is a big data set of many MB as I will probably have more than 250 polygons. Perhaps I will also put an image inside too, which also can be very huge. I can change my shape files to KML files if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Users should be able to click on each single polygon. When doing so, a popup window should be appearing, which is able to includes normal texts, one image and a link to another website or another page on my website.</p></li>
<li><p>Users shouldn't be allow to zoom in or out too far. So there should be the possibility for me as an admin to change the values of minZoom and maxZoom (in Google maps for instance).</p></li>
<li><p>The user should also be restricted to an particular area, for instance just one country. As my polygons will represent counties of one country, my map would be only in one area. If the user tries to move beyond this country the map should stop this so that the user only can stay at my map area. To better understand what I mean in point 3 and 4 here is a link of a code which is able to do this in google maps:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3818016/google-maps-v3-limit-viewable-area-and-zoom-level"">Google Maps v3 - limit viewable area and zoom level</a></p></li>
<li><p>Other features beside my polygon shouldn't be shown on the map. (Perhaps I just add a very huge picture for that, with low accuracy, which covers my whole area and lays behind my polygons but in front of the OSM content)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope somebody can help me creating this kind of map. And it should be finished at least until end of february / beginning of march, as I need the present until then.</p>

<p>Thanks and best regards</p>

<p>I'm trying to run all my pages through <code>index_new.php</code> (it all made sense when I decided to do that, I swear). I have two types of pages, static and dynamic. The dynamic pages are all the same kind of page, but with different data based on the database (MySQL). I'm trying to make these rewrites</p>

<ul>
<li>/about => index_new.php?page=about</li>
<li>/installations => index_new.php?page=about</li>
<li>/installations/{site_id} => index_new.php?page=site&amp;siteID={site_id}</li>
</ul>

<p>(I'd love if <code>about</code> could be generic, but I don't want to push my luck) My .htaccess file is:</p>

<pre><code># enable rewrite
Options +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# rewrite all physical existing file or folder

# rewrite rules
RewriteRule ^about index_new.php?page=about
RewriteRule ^/installations index_new.php?page=list
RewriteRule ^/installations/(.*) index_new.php?page=site&amp;id=$1
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to go to <code>/about</code> or any other page, I get HTTP 404. As a note, my root is <code>http://localhost/~user/public_html/new</code> and the <code>.htaccess</code> file is there.</p>

<p>Compile using MinGW with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>mingw32-gcc select_ws.c -Wl,-lws2_32 -g -o select_ws.exe
</code></pre>

<p>Running the program directly from the console using the following command works:</p>

<pre><code>select_ws.exe
</code></pre>

<p>But doing the same with a pipe will constantly signal WaitForMultipleObjectsEx:</p>

<pre><code>ping -t 8.8.8.8 | select_ws.exe
</code></pre>

<p>The pipe is ready to read until the parent process is finished, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>ping 8.8.8.8 | select_ws.exe
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Is there a compatible way to simulate a blocking wait on the PIPE-based console input handle together with the other handles? The use of threads should be avoided.</p>

<p>You are welcome to contribute changes to the example program in <a href=""https://gist.github.com/4478231"" rel=""nofollow"">this gist</a>.</p>

<p>I create a project and create a class library for my DAL (Data Access Layer).</p>

<p>Add a Linq to Sql class and drop a table onto it.</p>

<p>Create a second class library project BLL (Business Logic Layer) and create a <code>DataAccessClass</code> with the below code:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class DataAccess
    {
        private myDataContext _Dc = null;

        public myDataContext DataContext
        {
            get { return _Dc; }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next i create an <code>Interface</code> for a <code>Customer</code> class along with another class to write the CRUD operations which inherits the <code>DataAccess</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>Public class CustomerBll : DataAccess, ICustomerBll
{
 Public IQueryable&lt;Customer&gt; getCustomers()
{
return myDataContext.Customers;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>So previously the architecture guys would create a 'proxy class' so theres always <strong>one instance</strong> of (in this case) the <strong><code>Interface ICustomerBll</code></strong> - i never understood why and what implications this has or what benefits this brings but continued to use it (i can provide the code but i think those of you that have done this will know what and why this is being done).</p>

<p>Now im entering this department and im hoping to understand this and provide a more modern solution. So far i have found using Ninject which is very close to what we currently do except i dont need to create a proxy class (or at least i think i dont). I add the service in the class that Ninject provides once its installed and then use <code>[Inject]</code> to call the Interface in question on the webpage that needs to get data from the customer class.</p>

<p>So does this mean this is the same as creating a single proxy? How and why would you create multi proxies and what problem does this cause?</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>I have a sql table ( with PRIMARY KEY = [ ip &amp; id ] ) , like this:</p>

<pre><code>ip | id | visits
</code></pre>

<p>and I want to generate a php array from that table, like this:</p>

<pre><code>product_rating_for_ip = array(
  ip=&gt;array(
    id=&gt;rating, id=&gt;rating, ...
  ),
  ip=&gt;array(
    id=&gt;rating, id=&gt;rating, ...
  ),
  .
  .
  .
);
</code></pre>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>product_rating_for_ip = array(
  ""78.125.15.92""=&gt;array(
    1=&gt;0.8,2=&gt;0.2,3=&gt;1.0
  ),
  ""163.56.75.112""=&gt;array(
    1=&gt;0.1,2=&gt;0.3,3=&gt;0.5,8=&gt;0.1,12=&gt;1.0
  ),
  .
  .
  .
);
</code></pre>

<p><code>Gordon Linoff</code> suggested this SQL query which works fine:</p>

<h2>SQL Query</h2>

<pre><code>select v.ip, group_concat(concat(v.id, ':', v.visits / iv.maxvisits)) as ratings
from visit v join
  (SELECT ip, id, visits, max(visits) as maxvisits
  FROM visit
  GROUP BY ip
  ) iv
 on v.ip = iv.ip
group by v.ip;
</code></pre>

<p>which produces this:  </p>

<pre><code>+-------------+--------------------------+
|ip           |ratings                   |
+-------------+--------------------------+
|154.18.72.15 |2:0.1667,1:1.0000,3:0.1667|

|78.15.92.131 |1:0.1429,3:1.0000,2:0.2857|  
+-------------+--------------------------+    
</code></pre>

<h2>Question in summary</h2>

<p>how can I put this result set into this php array?</p>

<pre><code>    product_rating_for_ip = array(
      ip=&gt;array(
        id=&gt;rating, id=&gt;rating, ...

      ),
      .
      .
      .
    );
</code></pre>

<h2>My problematic answer</h2>

<p>I think I should do as this (may be incorrect or inefficient):</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = mysqli_prepare($con, ""select ..."");
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
mysqli_stmt_bind_result($stmt,$ip,$ratings);
while (mysqli_stmt_fetch($stmt)){
  $value_array = explode("","",$ratings);
  product_rating_for_ip = array_fill_keys($ip, $value_array);
}
</code></pre>

Two scenarios for you guys:</p>

<p>
<strong>1: </strong><br>
I use Netbeans with the built in sftp. I will get a copy of the remote source to my computer, and edit that. Netbeans will keep my local copy and the remote source in sync.
</p>

<p>
<strong>2: </strong><br>
I use svn. Checkout the remote source. Open a local project in netbeans. When I want to see my changes, I have to first commit, then with ssh from the server do update, and then open my browser and see the changes. Tedious.
</p>

<p>I want to go for the first scenario. It's not the production-environment. And currently I'm the only one working on this project. But one day I get a colleague helping me out, just doing a QA or fixing one simple bug for me and sftp directly to the development-environment is not cool if I want to work as he is helping me out or whatever...</p>

Anyone been in the same situation? I'm sure there's some other way that I haven't discovered yet ;)

<p>I'm getting weird results in consuming messages from a RabbitMQ mq (getting the messages from a direct exchange and publishing to a fanout exchange after processing the message). I don't understand why messages end up in <strong>separate threads</strong> during consumption (every few messages a thread switch happens).</p>

<p>The consumer starts in a separate thread (to prevent it from crashing the main thread if any IO exceptions happen), but that doesn't explain the switching.</p>

<pre><code>; Message handler
(defn message-handler
  [pub-name ch metadata ^bytes payload]
  (let [msg (json/parse-string (String. payload ""UTF-8""))
        content (string/join "" "" (map msg '(""title"" ""link"" ""body"")))
        tags (pluck-tags content)]
    (println (format ""HANDLER %s: Message: %s | found tags: %s""
                     (Thread/currentThread)
                     (msg ""title"")
                     (tags-to-csv tags)))
  (nil)))
  ; (lb/publish ch pub-name """" (json/generate-string (assoc msg ""tags"" (tags-to-csv tags))))))


(defn -main
  [&amp; args]
  (let [conn          (rmq/connect {:uri (System/getenv ""MSGQ"")})
        ch            (lch/open conn)

    (.start (Thread. (fn []
       (lcm/subscribe ch q-name (partial message-handler e-pub-name) :auto-ack true))))))
</code></pre>

<p>The message-handler just prints out the current thread and the payload received. This is what I get:</p>

<pre><code>HANDLER in Thread[pool-1-thread-2,5,main]: Message: ...
HANDLER in Thread[pool-1-thread-2,5,main]: Message: ...

HANDLER in Thread[pool-1-thread-4,5,main]: Message: ...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

<p>I noticed this during playing with agents. I wanted to process each message in its own CPU bound thread-pool, and publish it in a unbounded (IO) thread-pool. But, after printing out the current thread I noticed that even without using agents (or futures), messages get processed by different threads.</p>

<p>Currently I am building a program to automate the process of filling a template. This template exceeds 60,000 rows of data quite often and I've built the large majority of it to work month to month by plugging in new data sheets and running it. Currently all of the work is based off of one data sheet which I import into excel manually. This data sheet does not contain all the data I need to populate the template so now I am beginning to bring in additional data to supplement this. The problem herein lies with data association. When I was originally pulling from one data sheet I didn't have to worry if the data I pulled for each row coincided with the other rows because it all came from the same sheet. Now I have to cross check data across two sheets to confirm it is pulling the correct information.</p>

<p>Now for what you need to know. I am trying to fill a column that will be referred to as Haircut, but before I do that I need to confirm that I am pulling the correct haircut number in correlation to a Trade ID which was already populated into the template in a previous line of code.</p>

<p>Using similar logic that I have been using throughout my entire project this is a snippet of code I have to perform this task.</p>

    Dim ALLCs as worksheet
    Dim DS as worksheet

                For Z = 1 To 80
                    If Anvil.Cells(1, Z) = ""Trade ID"" Then
                        For t = 2 To 70000
                            For u = 16 To 70000
                                If Anvil.Cells(t, Z) = ALLCs.Cells(u, 34) Then
                                ALLCs.Cells(u, 27) = Anvil.Cells(t, y)
                                End If

<p>This code coupled with my other code I assume will in theory work, but I can only imagine that it will take an unbelievable amount of time(this program already takes 7 and a half minutes to run). Any suggestions on how to rewrite this code with better functionality, following this general logic?</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated, whether you completely revamp the code, or if you offer suggestions on how to cut down loops. I am also looking for suggestions to speed up the code in general aside from screen updating and calculation suggestions.</p>

<p>E.g. The following example just demonstrates a simple trigger:</p>

&lt;/Page&gt;

<p>However, if I used a element property syntax for property <code>Property</code> of trigger, it throws an exception saying that setter! (not trigger) requires both property and value.</p>

"13591584","1","13591830","","2012-11-27 19:27:41","","12","13709","<p>I am trying to create a div that slants only at the top and does not skew the text within it, using CSS.
The reason I would like for it to be CSS-only is because it is a responsive design and needs to respond to percentages, as the rest of this div flexes as the device width changes.</p>

<p>A photo of what I am trying to accomplish is here: </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xVpNv.png"" alt=""Slanted design""></p>

<p>What I have gotten so far is to create a skewed div and position it within the other div, then use a negative margin to pull it upwards. There are two issues with this way that I've done this. The first issue is that on the smallest screen shrinkage (make your browser width really small), the skewed div becomes smaller than the containing div, making it look odd. Also, this div is covering up any text I am adding after it.</p>

<p>The markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;aside&gt;
                &lt;div id=""skew""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #skew --&gt;
                &lt;h3 id=""refer""&gt;Refer Your Friends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The CSS:</p>

<pre><code>   #skew {
background:#00328b;
width:103%;
height:66px;
border-radius:8px;
margin-top:-47px;
margin-left:-1.2%;
  -webkit-transform: skewY(-5.5deg); 
 -moz-transform: skewY(-5.5deg); 
  -ms-transform: skewY(-5.5deg); 
   -o-transform: skewY(-5.5deg); 
      transform: skewY(-5.5deg); 
}

.main aside {
color: white;
padding: 20px 10px;
margin-top:120px;
border-radius:8px;
background: rgb(0,51,141); /* Old browsers */
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried using the skew on the parent aside, but this skews all child elements within it. If this were a fixed layout, I would use absolute positioning to help me, but since it is responsive and flexes, I don't know what other approach to take.</p>

<p>I also would like for it to be in CSS because I have other effects to add to the div, such as an outer glow using box-shadow, and a background gradient.</p>

<p>I also cannot change the design.</p>

<p>Any input on how to accomplish this would be great!</p>

<p>My characters and equippable items have 22 different total attributes (HP, MP, ATP, DFP).  A character has their base-statistics and can equip up to four items at one time.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>BASE   ATP:  55</li>
<li>WEAPON ATP:  45</li>
<li>ARMOR1 ATP: -10 </li>
<li>ARMOR2 ATP: -5 </li>
<li>ARMOR3 ATP:  3</li>
</ul>

<p>Final character ATP in this case would be 88.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to implement this in my code.  Well, I already have this implemented but it isn't elegant.  Right now, I have ClassA that stores these attributes in an array.  Then, I have ClassB that takes five ClassA and will add up the values and return the final attribute.</p>

<p>However, I need to emphasize that this isn't an elegant solution. </p>

<p>There has to be some better way to access and manipulate these attributes, including data structures that I haven't thought of using.  Any suggestions?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: I should note that there are some restrictions on these attributes that I need to be put in place.  E.g., these are the baselines.</p>

<p>For instance, the character's own HP and MP cannot be more than the baseline and cannot be less than 0, whereas the ATP and MST can be.  I also currently cannot enforce these constraints without hacking what I currently have :(</p>

<p>After the deployment, user settings are stored in user.config file (this is at least true with click-once deployment, I'm not sure how it's handled by msi deployed or with standard setup apps) and whenever user changes a setting this is where new value is stored and retreived from at run-time.</p>

<p>Now, all that makes sense but I just tried deleting the <code>app.exe.config</code> file of a deployed app and after that the app would crash on start and it would not work until the <code>app.exe.config</code> file was restored.</p>

<p>If that is the case and the app cannot use the embedded settings when the config file is missing or tempered with, what is the point of embedding the settings in the first place and are there any scenarios where these embedded settings would get to be used?</p>

I have to search data in two tables then insert that record in a new table (3rd table), if the record already exists in 3rd table then I have to update one column record in 3rd table. </p>

<p>This sounds easy, but it is taking so long to process. </p>

<p>Below are sample queries and pseudo code: </p>

<pre><code>select * from table1 INNER JOIN table2 USING(id)

search in table 3 -&gt; 
 if record exist{
  update record in table 3 (update counter in a column)
 }else{
  Insert new record in table 3
 }
</code></pre>

<p>First and second table has more than two hundred thousands records. As I start inserting record in 3rd table it kills the whole speed because then it also have to search in 3rd table to update or insert a record. </p>

<pre><code>Database Name = MySql
Language = Php
</code></pre>

<p>What is the problem? How can I improve this? I can not wait hours to process it :(</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>EDIT:</h2>

<p>In table 3, id has primary key and all other columns are normal. Database schema is too big plus complex. Do you guys want , I paste hundred of lines here?</p>

<p>Can you please guys point out mistake in my pseudo code and query? What index or structure I can use to improve performance??</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<pre><code>Table 1 - usr_id, first name, last name (usr_id is primary key)
Table 2 - id, usr_id, amount (id is primary key and usr_id is foreign key)

Table 3 - new_id , first name, last name, usr_id, total_amount (new_id is primary key and usr_id is foreign key

<p>I check if table 3 has same first name and last name then update total amount, if they are different then insert a new record</p>

To avoid requiring observers to unsubscribe explicitly, I would like to keep track of WeakReference objects that point to delegates instead of tracking delegates themselves. I ended up coding something similar to what Paul Stovell described in his blog <a href=""http://www.paulstovell.com/weakevents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulstovell.com/weakevents</a>.</p>

<p>My problem is this: as opposed to Paul's code, my observers subscribe to messages on one thread, but messages may be published on another. In this case, I observe that by the time I need to notify observers, my WeakReference.Target values are null indicating that targets have been collected, even though I know for certain they weren't. The problem persists for both short and long weak references.</p>

<p>Conversely, when subscribing and publishing is done from the same thread, the code works fine. The latter is true even if I actually end up enumerating over targets on a new thread from ThreadPool, for as long as the request initially comes from the same thread I subscribe to messages on.</p>

<p>I understand that this is a very specific case, so any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> should I not be able to reliably access WeakReference objects from multiple threads provided proper thread synchronization is in place? It appears that I cannot, which does not make much sense to me. So, what am I not doing right?</p>

<p>I appeal to user experience for two reasons: (i) find out about code writing practices for ios-style int arrays; (ii) find about reasoning why despite the heavy coding these arrays justify themselves vs <code>int array[7]</code> in daily practice;</p>

<p>Below is a set of exemplified templates of how one can initialize, allocate, read and write a NSMutableArray implementing integer one-dimensional array in a very generic manner.</p>

<pre><code>int arrayIndex;
int arrayValue;

//DECLARE arrayOfInt
@property (atomic, strong)  NSMutableArray *arrayOfInt;

//ALLOCATE AND INITIALIZE arrayOfInt
self.arrayOfInt = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

//...fill arrayOfInt (write)  
[self.arrayOfInt addObject: [NSNumber  numberWithInt: arrayValue]];

//... read arrayOfInt
arrayValue = [(NSNumber*)[self.arrayOfInt objectAtIndex: arrayIndex ] intValue];

//...replace arrayOfInt (write)
[self.arrayOfInt replaceObjectAtIndex: arrayIndex withObject: [NSNumber numberWithInt: arrayValue ]];

After I finished adding it to my app, and tested all working, I noticed the comment in this <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/marketbilling/source/browse/src/com/example/dungeons/Security.java?r=7638aa836213dd68d5c6fabfcb34fa81c5778e82"" rel=""nofollow"">Security class</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Security-related methods. For a secure implementation, all of
  this code should be implemented on a server that communicates with
  the application on the device. For the sake of simplicity and
  clarity of this example, this code is included here and is executed
  on the device. If you must verify the purchases on the phone, you
  should obfuscate this code to make it harder for an attacker to
  replace the code with stubs that treat all purchases as verified. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Google suggests, I do the purchase verification on the server side so I really don't need the Security class in my project.
The problem is, I can't figure out how to remove the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/marketbilling/source/browse/src/com/example/dungeons/BillingService.java"" rel=""nofollow"">BillingService</a> class dependency in the Security class.</p>

<p>I started by deleting the Security class and following the errors in the BillingService and most places it's being used I can remove easily, except in one place:</p>

<pre><code>private void purchaseStateChanged(int startId, String signedData, String signature) {
        ArrayList&lt;Security.VerifiedPurchase&gt; purchases;
        purchases = Security.verifyPurchase(signedData, signature);
        if (purchases == null) {
            return;
        }

        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; notifyList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
        for (VerifiedPurchase vp : purchases) {
            if (vp.notificationId != null) {
                notifyList.add(vp.notificationId);
            }
            ResponseHandler.purchaseResponse(this, vp.purchaseState, vp.productId,
                    vp.orderId, vp.purchaseTime, vp.developerPayload);
        }
        if (!notifyList.isEmpty()) {
            String[] notifyIds = notifyList.toArray(new String[notifyList.size()]);
            confirmNotifications(startId, notifyIds);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Would love if someone can share his/hers purchaseStateChanged method (based on the in app billing sample app) without the use of the Security class.</p>

<p>But during it, I have noticed, that some colors from PNG are a little corrupted (similar but not the same as the colors from the source texture). The same with transparency (it works for 0 and 100% transparency parts, but not for e.g. 34%).</p>

<p>Are there some big color-approximations or I do something wrong? If so, how can I solve it?</p>

<p>Here are these two images (left is source: a little different colors and some gradient transparency on the bottom; right is image after loading first image and render it on the new texture, that was than saved to file):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JHKI0.png"" alt=""source image""> <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/OXusR.png"" alt=""new image""></p>

<p>I don't know what cause that behaviour, maybe the new texture's description:</p>

<pre><code>textureDesc.Format = DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM;
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried to change it to <code>DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT</code>, but the effect was even stranger:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xvnlY.png"" alt=""with DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT""></p>

<p>Here is the code for rendering source texture on the new texture:</p>

<pre><code>context-&gt;OMSetRenderTargets(1, &amp;renderTargetView, depthStencilView); //to render on new texture instead of the screen
float clearColor[4] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}; //red, green, blue, alpha
context-&gt;ClearRenderTargetView(renderTargetView, clearColor);
//clear the depth buffer to 1.0 (max depth)
context-&gt;ClearDepthStencilView(depthStencilView, D3D11_CLEAR_DEPTH, 1.0f, 0);
//rendering
turnZBufferOff();
shader-&gt;set(context);
object-&gt;render(shader, camera, textureManager, context, 0);
swapChain-&gt;Present(0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>And in <code>object-&gt;render()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>UINT stride;
stride = sizeof(Vertex);
UINT offset = 0;
context-&gt;IASetVertexBuffers( 0, 1, &amp;buffers-&gt;vertexBuffer, &amp;stride, &amp;offset ); //set vertex buffer
context-&gt;IASetIndexBuffer( buffers-&gt;indexBuffer, DXGI_FORMAT_R16_UINT, 0 ); //set index buffer
context-&gt;IASetPrimitiveTopology( D3D11_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLELIST ); //set primitive topology

if(textureID){
    context-&gt;PSSetShaderResources( 0, 1, &amp;textureManager-&gt;get(textureID)-&gt;texture);
}

ConstantBuffer2DStructure cbPerObj;
cbPerObj.positionAndScale = XMFLOAT4(center.getX(), center.getY(), halfSize.getX(), halfSize.getY());
cbPerObj.textureCoordinates =  XMFLOAT4(textureRectToUse[0].getX(), textureRectToUse[0].getY(), textureRectToUse[1].getX(), textureRectToUse[1].getY());
context-&gt;UpdateSubresource(constantBuffer, 0, NULL, &amp;cbPerObj, 0, 0);
context-&gt;VSSetConstantBuffers(0, 1, &amp;constantBuffer);
context-&gt;PSSetConstantBuffers(0, 1, &amp;constantBuffer);

context-&gt;DrawIndexed(6, 0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>The shader is very simple:</p>

<pre><code>VS_OUTPUT VS(float4 inPos : POSITION, float2 inTexCoord : TEXCOORD)
{

    VS_OUTPUT output;
    output.Pos.zw = float2(0.0f, 1.0f);

    //inPos(x,y) = {-1,1}
    output.Pos.xy = (inPos.xy * positionAndScale.zw) + positionAndScale.xy;
    output.TexCoord.xy = inTexCoord.xy * (textureCoordinates.zw - textureCoordinates.xy) + textureCoordinates.xy;

    return output;
}


float4 PS(VS_OUTPUT input) : SV_TARGET
{
return ObjTexture.Sample(ObjSamplerState, input.TexCoord);
}
</code></pre>

<p>For some optimalisation I parse the sprite's size as the shader's param (it works fine, the size of texture, borders etc. are right).</p>

On Linux, I include this library:</p>

<p><code>#import rsvg</code> </p>

<p>and I'm good to go. On windows, it's a bit more complex. I found this page: <a href=""http://cairographics.org/cairo_rsvg_and_python_in_windows/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cairographics.org/cairo_rsvg_and_python_in_windows/</a> 
which suggests using the given code to hook in to GTK dlls on windows. That seems to work but glib is reporting errors that I can't handle, specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GLib-WARNING **: GError set over the top of a previous GError or uninitialized memory.
  This indicates a bug in someone's code. You must ensure an error is NULL before it's set.
  The overwriting error message was: Error opening file: No such file or directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when running this code:</p>

<pre><code>svg_file_name = ""c:/test.svg"" #also tried ""c:\\test.svg"" and ""file:///c:/test.svg""
handler = rsvg.Handle(svg_file_name)
dim     = handler.get_dimension_data()
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what file exactly it's talking about as I can't seem to get any error specifics out of glib. I've tried all permutations of the SVG file name in question. I'm assuming it's complaining about that file but it could be something internal to GTK that I'm not privy to.</p>

<p>I've tried hooking in to glib's DLL and running g_clear_error(0) in order to clear that error stacking that the error message talks about but according to the documentation for glib error reporting (<a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.37/glib-Error-Reporting.html#g-clear-error"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.37/glib-Error-Reporting.html#g-clear-error</a>) I need a handle to the error object from the code that caused the problem if I'm to do anything about it - from within python, I'm not sure how I'd get that.</p>

<p>Any tips on GTK error reporting and clearing from python would be welcome. Failing that, if anybody can suggest an alternative SVG rendering library that works in python for windows, I'd appreciate it. 
  I have already tried CairoSVG, which works to a point but fails to render gradients and doesn't seem to allow programmatic manipulation of the SVG data. </p>

<p>So this is what the code looks like in the text view inside the first content box:</p>

<p>Die Zukunft aktiv und erfolgreich gestalten</p>

<p>Instead of having the client to edit the content boxes, I would like to display simply a text only field with a small description like ""content box 1"" in which the client can type in plain text.
Then this plain text would have to be transported with some kind of shortcode into the correct place.
So it would have to be something like. </p>

<p>[[plain text here]]</p>

<p>I don't know if something like this exists or what options I have to create a functionality like this. I did some research and, of course, stumbled upon custom fields, but it seems like I have to get into editing php.files and stuff which I don't want to do.</p>

<p>I don't understand why it is so damn hard ? the CSS divs and layers are sooo complicated to place, you have to do all these calculations, sometimes increasing margins,decreasing margins, type of divs , maybe it is just me, but after many months of headaches I have switched to using a website builder such as one provided by webeden.co.uk ( this isn't an advert, i m not affiliated with them, ). I mean ALL i want to do is drag and drop a few divs, click a few buttons and for them to just work, and webeden can do it online and the dreamweaver which is the software solely designed for web development cant. I am desperate to switch back to dreamweaver as it is a lot more powerful, but doing the layouts is a nightmare.</p>

<p>Is it just me, do I just need hundreds of hours to get all my divs and spans just right? or maybe I am not suited as an occasional web-developer? or did adobe put a curse on me for leaving dreamweaver ?</p>

<p>I'm going to insert some records in a new table to analyze them and I'm thinking in creating a new primary key with the values from all the available columns. </p>

<p>If this were a programming language like Java I would:</p>

<pre><code> int hash = column1 * 31 + column2 * 31 + column3*31
</code></pre>

<p>Or something like that. But this is SQL.</p>

<p>How can I create a primary key from the values of the available columns? It won't work for me to simply mark all the columns as PK, for what I need to do is to compare them with data from other DB table. </p>

<p>My table has 3 numbers and a date.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT <em>What my problem is</em></strong></p>

<p>I think a bit more of background is needed.  I'm sorry for not providing it before. </p>

<p>I have a database ( dm ) that is being updated everyday from another db ( original source ) . It has records form the past two years. </p>

<p>Last month ( july )  the update process got broken and for a month there was no data being updated into the dm. </p>

<p>I manually create a table with the same structure in my Oracle XE, and I copy the records from the original source into my db ( myxe ) I copied only records from July to create a report needed by the end of the month. </p>

<p>Finally on aug 8 the update process got fixed and the records which have been waiting to be migrated by this automatic process got copied into the database ( from originalsource to dm ). </p>

<p>This process does clean up from the original source the data once it is copied ( into dm ). </p>

<p>Everything look fine, but we have just realize that an amount of the records got lost ( about 25% of july )  </p>

<p>So, what I want to do is to use my backup ( myxe )  and insert into the database ( dm ) all those records missing. </p>

<p>The problem here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>They don't have a well defined PK.</li>
<li>They are in separate databases. </li>
</ul>

<p>So I thought that If I could create a unique pk from both tables which gave the same number I could tell which were missing and insert them. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>So I did the following in my local environment:</p>

<pre><code>select a.* from the_table@PRODUCTION a , the_table b where
a.idle = b.idle and 
a.activity = b.activity and 
a.finishdate = b.finishdate
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns all the rows that are present in both databases ( the .. union? )  I've got 2,000 records.</p>

<p>What I'm going to do next, is delete them all from the target db and then just insert them  all s from my db into the target table</p>

<p>I hope I don't get in something worst : - S : -S </p>

<p>As you see my strings are TEXAS , EDINBURG , etc.
I set these strings to textviews.
On the other hand , using textviews for such task may not be good and there may be some other alternatives for this, I am open to new ideas. Since i am not well experienced I could not figure out any other solutions.
I tried with vertical orientation but couldn't manage to display letter by letter.
Does anyone have an idea or experience about this concept ?
By the way I am using ECLIPSE- ADT.</p>

<p>What i want is when some user wants to edit the file, he should do getlock. After that, that file should not become editable for the other users. This is the way VSS used to work.</p>

<p>I know that doing this may defeat the purpose of having different users work on the same file and later merging them,but i still need to do this.</p>

<p>I believe SVN also provides hooks for get lock command so we can insert a script there that  would send an email, but instead of email, i want to have the other users notify via svn getlock window itself when they do the getlock on the file which is locked out by some user.</p>

<p>If same can be achieved in visual studio, that would be best for me. Any free plugin supporting visualsvn should work.</p>

<p>Any idea about how to achieve this ?

So whatever sentence I type in the server, it was visible to the client and vice versa. <strong>Note: The server and client were both in the same computer.</strong></p>

<p>Case 2) On the Mac, I started the server program. On another computer(Windows 7)
I connected to the server via Command Prompt. The connection was successful. In this case, the Strings could be sent from the server to the client and the Strings were visible to the client. <strong>But when I tried to send Strings to the server from the client, the server could only receive the information character by character, not as an entire sentence/String.</strong> I tried changing the port number, the client device, the frameRate, but I still had no success.</p>

<p>This is my problem. Please comment if my question could be clearer or if I need to give more details. Thank you for answering.</p>

<p>Below is my Server code:</p>

<pre><code>import processing.net.*;

Server myServer;
//Strings from server and client
String typing = """";
String c = """";

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  //creating server on port 5204
  myServer = new Server(this, 5204); 
}

void draw() {
  background(255);
  //displaying server's text and client's text
  fill(0);
  text(typing, 100, 100);
  text(""Client: "" + c, 100, 150);
  Client client = myServer.available();

  if(client != null) {
      //reading input from client
      c = client.readString();
      c.trim();
  }
}

void keyPressed() {
  //Server can type sentences to client
  if(key == '\n') {
    myServer.write(typing + '\n');
    typing = """";
  }else{
    typing = typing + key;
  }
}

This also amounts to the the muted property. The concept of muted videos which autoplay when scrolled into view and with the option of unmuting on tap is growing increasingly popular (pioneered by Vine, Facebook, etc.). I'm trying to find a way around this limitation in design. From what I've been able to read on the subject, there's not any hack or solution that solves this design requirement of mine.</p>

<p>Here's my thoughts so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I could split the audio from the video into a separate stream and sync current time with the video and call play() when the user is tapping. However, iOS Safari/UiWebView does not support simultaneous audio/video streams. Thus, this is simply not an option.</p></li>
<li><p>I could encode two videos, one with sound and one without. I could then swap the src on tap. However, this requires reloading the entire stream and also nearly doubles the amount of data required. The latency is noticeable. Thus, this won't be a viable solution.</p></li>
<li><p>I could embed a native AVPlayer class element in the webview. However, this would be an overlay and not be manageable from within the webview. Custom controls and UI interaction from within the dom would not be possible. Thus, this is not an option.</p></li>
<li><p>I could simply disable the output of the app and dynamically switch it on whenever the user taps a video element. However, to my knowledge this is not possible. I could show the native software volume slider, but that would defeat the purpose of this whole thing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Do you have any suggestions or ways around this limitation?</p>

<p>It seems like I am close to a solution here. I am following this blog post.
<a href=""http://nelenkov.blogspot.jp/2012/06/unpacking-android-backups.html"" rel=""nofollow"">unpacking-android-backups</a> </p>

<p>This is how to extract the application data on Android</p>

<pre><code>adb backup -noapk PACKAGE_NAME
dd if=backup.ab bs=1 skip=24 | python -c ""import zlib,sys;sys.stdout.write(zlib.decompress(sys.stdin.read()))"" | tar -xvf -
</code></pre>

<p>Once the application data is extracted you can update the application data web files here</p>

<pre><code>apps/PACKAGE_NAME/ef/_extracted_8d996c1a-301f-4ee9-ae67-7ece09aeb6fc/
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to create a new restore file. This can be done with the ""Android Backup Extractor"" github project
<a href=""https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor"" rel=""nofollow"">android-backup-extractor</a> </p>

<p>I was able to build the <code>jar</code> using <code>gradle</code> method</p>

<p>Once the jar file was created I then tar the apps directory</p>

<pre><code>tar czf backup.tar apps/
</code></pre>

<p>The ran this command to package the restore file</p>

<pre><code>java -jar build/libs/abe-all.jar pack backup.tar backup.ab
</code></pre>

<p>Once the backup.ab is prepared you can run the following command to restore this file to device</p>

<pre><code>adb restore backup.ab
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is after the restore is completed, the app does not have updated content for the application data web files and the size of the app data in the app settings does not change. This requires further research.</p>

<p>I'm planning on an ASP.NET and/or Silverlight UI, and maybe some WPF client stuff too on our LAN too, so I want to craft a data access layer that can support all these front ends.</p>

<p>My data will be in SQL server. I have already made a test run of pushing the data from Foxpro to SQL Server 2005. It went well. That gave me a SQL server data store to play with.</p>

<p>Now, here are the data tools I played with so far, trying to get familiar with .NET data access:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I've played with Linq-To-Sql, and made a test form using the typed objects and collections from L2S, and then populating some WPF listviews and other UI controls. That was cool. Linq is cool! WPF is cool. See screenshot of form here: <a href=""http://twitpic.com/26w26/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitpic.com/26w26/full</a></p></li>
<li><p>I've played with what I guess you'd call classic ADO.Net DataSets. Man, DataSets seem like a lot of work...
A SQLConncetion
A SQLCommand
A DataSet
A TableAdapter</p></li>
</ol>

<p>...and worst of all, I had to type SQL code within quotes, with absolutely no help from the IDE to to keep me from making typing errors, or writing just plain wrong SQL code, and I had to know the columns names from my data table every time. Lots of room for errors! And query parameters, yuck.</p>

<p>So, let me ask.... does the .NET developer community really work with SQLCmds, DataSets, and DataTables to read and write data? Is that how it works?</p>

<p>I know all about the O/RM battles out there, and EF too. </p>

<p>It sure looks like you can hook up any of the UI controls from ASP.NET/Silverlight/WPF/and WinForms to either Object collections (via OR/M) or DataSets/DataTables, right? Is it always a choice between one of those two?</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomClient

}

    public CustomClass(int count)
    {
        _count = count;
    }

    public int Count
    {
        get { return _count; }
        set { _count = value; }
    }
}

[TestFixture]
public class CustomClientUnitTests
{
    [Test]
    public async Task TestListedInTestExplorer()
    {
        int a = 2;
        int b = 3;
        int expectedResult = 6;

        CustomClient sut = new CustomClient();
        int result = await sut.GetDataAsync(a, b);

        Assert.That(result, Is.EqualTo(expectedResult));
    }
    [Test]
    public async Task Test_NOT_ListedInTestExplorer()
    {
        int inCount = 5;
        int expectedOutCount = 6;

        CustomClient sut = new CustomClient();
        CustomClass customResult = await sut.GetCustomDataAsync(inCount);

        Assert.That(customResult.Count, Is.EqualTo(expectedOutCount));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The CustomClient and CustomClass are in a ClassLibrary. The UnitTests are in separate ClassLibrary as well. I add a reference to the productive code in the UnitTest Project.</p>

<p>In the UnitTest Project I installed the following NuGet Packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>NUnitTestAdapter for VS2012 and VS2013, v1.2</p></li>
<li><p>NUnit, v2.6.4</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I already tried so far, without success:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Started VS2013 with/without admin rights.</p></li>
<li><p>Various ""Clean Solution"" and ""Build/Rebuild Solution"".</p></li>
<li><p>Changed the TEST -> Test Settings -> Default Processor Architecture: x86/x64.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved the second unit test to another unit test class.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I’m missing here, or doing wrong? Why is the second async Unit Test not listed in the VS2013 Test Explorer?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I've done further testing, trying to isolate the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using MSTest instead of NUnit, the async/await approach works with both Unit Tests, both Tests are listed in Test Explorer as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Using ReSharper 9 (used current demo version/trial) as Test Explorer/Runner and NUnit, both Tests are listed in the ReSharper Unit Test Explorer as expected.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So far, it looks like a problem with NUnit and the VS2013 Test Explorer, in detail, I think, a problem with the ""integration"" (NUnit Test Adapter for VS2013?).</p>

<p>Has someone already seen this problem? Or has any additional information?</p>

<pre><code>flash.put(""error"", exception.getType());
</code></pre>

<p>On the page, this string gets translated this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:outputText value=""#{bundle[flash.error]}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Works fine.</p>

<p>NOW i want to be also able to put (an arbitrary number of) parameters into the message text, that get inserted into the placeholders in the i18n-property in my message.properties. Therefore, i'm putting the parameters as a String array into the Flash Scope, like this:</p>

<pre><code>//exception.getParameters returns String[]
flash.put(""errorParams"", exception.getParameters())
</code></pre>

<p>Now i also want to be able to use this String array as parameters for an outputFormat element, to insert them into a property like <code>Welcome, {0} {1}</code>. 
So i tried to achieve this by using <em>ui:repeat</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:outputFormat value=""#{bundle[flash.error]}"" rendered=""#{! empty flash.error}"" class=""invalid""&gt;
  &lt;ui:repeat value=""#{flash.errorParams}"" var=""_param""&gt;
    &lt;f:param value=""#{bundle[_param]}""/&gt;
    &lt;!-- also doesn't work: &lt;f:param value=""#{_param}""/&gt;--&gt;
  &lt;/ui:repeat&gt;
&lt;/h:outputFormat&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the param value is ignored and the placeholders of the i18n-property aren't replaced, so the rendered output is <code>Welcome, {0} {1}</code>. When using a ""regular"" repeater, displaying the array elements just as an outputtext, it works. So the outputFormat tag doesn't seem to support the use of a repeat as a child.
Damn, so close ;) Anyone knows a good way to do what i want, or is there any component library supporting something like that?</p>

<p>But this code refuses to run and returns a fatal error – <strong><em>Call to undefined method PDO::bindParam()</em></strong>. What am I doing wrong here?

<p>The JSON data that I am getting. Their are these two different ones.</p>

<pre><code>""{\""Event\"": \""sConnection\"",\""data[device]\"": \""fb16f550-2ef1-11e5-afe9-ff37129acbf4\"",\""data[mode]\"": \""customer\"",\""data[starttime]\"": \""2015-07-22T16:07:42.030Z\"",\""data[endtime]\"": \""\""}""
""{\""Event\"": \""Log\"",\""data[id]\"": \""2015-07-22T16:07:23.063Z\"",\""data[messages][0][source]\"": \""server\"",\""data[messages][0][message]\"": \""Server is listening on port 1553\""}""
</code></pre>

<p>The code I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>// Read in our Stream into a string...
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(JSONdataStream);
string JSONdata = reader.ReadToEnd();

JavaScriptSerializer jss = new JavaScriptSerializer();
wsKisokData[] xKisokData = jss.Deserialize&lt;wsKisokData[]&gt;(JSONdata);
</code></pre>

<p>My Class:</p>

<pre><code>namespace JSONWebService
{

    [DataContract]
    [Serializable]
    public class KisokEvent
    {
        public string eventTrigger { get; set; }
    }

    [DataContract]
    [Serializable]
    public class KisokData
    {
        public string data { get; set; }

    }

    [DataContract]
    [Serializable]
    public class wsKisokData
    {
        public KisokEvent KDEvent { get; set; }
        public List&lt;KisokData&gt; KDData { get; set; }

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I am sure that I don't understand the Deserialize process. Thanks for the help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I put the JSON in the top part right from the debugger, here is the strings.</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""Event"": ""sConnection"",
    ""data[device]"": ""fb16f550-2ef1-11e5-afe9-ff37129acbf4"",

<p>Now I know that I could set the IsEnabled attributes to disable them, but im hoping for a more elegant/flexible approach.</p>

- Each menu item needs to be a MEF module extension (so it wouldnt even be download for users with no access to it). </p>

<p>is at the top of my grammar file.  A few of the tokens in my lexer need to pass the entire string that they match to my grammar, and the others just need to pass their token, so this works well for me.  I do this sort of thing in my lexer:</p>

I (probably) understand why, since a dereferenced <code>char*</code> is a <code>char</code>, but the steps I took to fix it caused problems.  For instance, removing the <code>&amp;</code> from the <code>sprintf()</code> line causes a segfault.  Removing the <code>*</code> from the assignment causes a ""makes integer from pointer without a cast"".  What do I do?  I think the problem lies in the assignment to <code>yylval</code>.</p>

<p>I am curious if there is a more efficient way of structuring this type of data using Dictionaries. </p>

<p>For instance, if I have a spreadsheet that would normally look like this as nested lists:</p>

<p>How could I set this up using (nested?)Dictionaries so that I can access values by an ""Account"" key and a ""Header"" key? (basically easily access Account1, Value2)</p>

<p>I'd prefer the implementation to be efficient from a performance standpoint when iterating over accounts and extracting account/value pairs to compare/mutate. (I do lots of analysis on arrays from one day to the next, where the array structure remains the same, but the numeric data changes).</p>

For each request it basically only goes to the elastic search DB, retrieves the object and returns it rendered with by the handlebars template engine. The communication with elastic search is over HTTP</p>

<p>This works great as long as I have only one node-js instance running. After I updated my code to use the cluster (as described in the <a href=""http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cluster.html#cluster_cluster"" rel=""nofollow"">nodejs-documentation</a> I started to encounter the following error: <strong>connect EADDRNOTAVAIL</strong></p>

<p>This error shows up when I have 3 and more python scripts running which constantly retrieve some URL from my server. With 3 scripts I can retrieve ~45,000 pages with 4 and more scripts running it is between 30,000 and 37,000 pages Running only 2 or 1 scripts, I stopped them after half an hour when they retrieved 310,000 pages and 160,000 pages respectively. </p>

<p>I've found this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20991551/eaddrnotavail-after-many-http-get-requests-to-localhost/20993398#20993398"">similar question</a> and tried changing <code>http.globalAgent.maxSockets</code> but that didn't have any effect.</p>

<p>This is the part of the code which listens for the URLs and retrieves the data from elastic search.</p>

<pre><code>app.get('/wiki/:contentId', (req, res) -&gt;
    http.get(elasticSearchUrl(req.params.contentId), (innerRes) -&gt;
        if (innerRes.statusCode != 200)
            res.send(innerRes.statusCode)
            innerRes.resume()
        else
            body = ''
            innerRes.on('data', (bodyChunk) -&gt;
                body += bodyChunk
            )
            innerRes.on('end', () -&gt;
                res.render('page', {'title': req.params.contentId, 'content': JSON.parse(body)._source.html})

    ).on('error', (e) -&gt;
        console.log('Got error: ' + e.message)  # the error is reported here
    )
)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>After looking more into it, I understand now the root of the problem. I ran the command <code>netstat -an | grep -e tcp -e udp | wc -l</code> several times during my test runs, to see how many ports are used, as described in the post <a href=""http://www.toptip.ca/2010/02/linux-eaddrnotavail-address-not.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Linux: EADDRNOTAVAIL (Address not available) error</a>. I could observe that at the time I received the EADDRNOTAVAIL-error, 56677 ports were used (instead of ~180 normally)</p>

<p>Also when using only 2 simultaneous scripts, the number of used ports is saturated at around 40,000 (+/- 2,000), that means ~20,000 ports are used per script (that is the time when node-js cleans up old ports before new ones are created) and for 3 scripts running it breaches over the 56677 ports (~60,000). This explains why it fails with 3 scripts requesting data, but not with 2.</p>

<p>So now my question changes to - how can I force node-js to free up the ports quicker or to reuse the same port all the time (would be the preferable solution)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

    var $parent_box = myfunctions_boxes_getBox(this.closest('.box').parents('.box').first());
    console.log('getParentBox',$parent_box);
    return $parent_box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now this is what my code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>// I first need to call a global function:
$box = MyFunctions.Boxes.getBox($('#box-1-1'));
// Then I can start chaining my methods
$box.getParentBox().getNestedBoxes().each(function(){
    // however as soon as I use a native jQuery method, I end up with
    // a jQuery object which doesn't have my custom methods ans I need
    // to use a global function again.
    console.log($(this), MyFunctions.Boxes.getBox($(this)).showLabel());
});
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/e778c/8/"" rel=""nofollow"">A <code>jsFiddle</code> showing this code in action (should it help you understand what I do) is available.</a></p>

<p><strong>Q1: How can I write my functions without having to repeat the namespace as a prefix in their name (e.g. <code>myfunctions_boxes_</code>) while avoiding conflicts with third party code?</strong></p>

<p>Every time I create a new function that I want to use as a custom method on a <code>jQuery</code> object (e.g. <code>getParentBox</code>, <code>getNestedBoxes</code>...) I have to manually map it inside one of my functions (i.e. <code>myfunctions_boxes_getBox</code>):</p>

<p><strong>Q2: Is there a way to automatically map my custom methods?</strong></p>

<p><em>The below question may be related to the above one but I prefer asking it separately as I feel they're not exactly the same</em></p>

<p>As soon as I use a native jQuery method (e.g. <code>each</code> in above example), I end up with jQuery objects which don't have my custom methods and I need to call one of my global functions again to retrieve the same object but with my custom methods attached to it.</p>

<p><strong>Q3: Would it make sense to create a <code>jQuery</code> plugin for my global functions to keep the OO nature of me code (see below example)?</strong></p>

<pre><code>// plugin declaration (the getBox function should be modified to make use of this)
jQuery.fn.getBox = MyFunctions.Boxes.getBox
// then my code becomes cleaner:
$('#box-1-1').getBox().getParentBox().getNestedBoxes().each(function(){
   console.log($(this).getBox().showLabel());
});

I've tested the serial commands (provided here: <a href=""http://www.oceanoptics.com/technical/engineering/OEM%20Data%20Sheet%20--%20HR4000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oceanoptics.com/technical/engineering/OEM%20Data%20Sheet%20--%20HR4000.pdf</a>) with Termite, a serial console, and they work just as expected. Therefore, I'm sure my physical connections are all correct. However, when writing these commands to the serial device using PySerial, the return is not what I expect but instead some gibberish.</p>

<p>Here is what I get with Termite, and what I want to get with Python:</p>

<p>The commands I'm sending are 'aA' to change the data mode to ASCII, 'I200' to set the integration time to 200 ms, and 'S' to acquire a spectra. Each of these commands is followed by a carriage return. Now, here is my sample code in Python, attempting to do the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>import serial
import time

port = 'COM9'
baud = 152000

spectro = serial.Serial(port, baud)

spectro.write('aA\r')
print spectro.read(10)
spectro.write('I200\r')
print spectro.read(10)
spectro.write('S\r')
time.sleep(0.5)
print spectro.read(100)

spectro.close()
</code></pre>

<p>However, when running the Python code, the return is this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
'[$;üü
 ÿÛ$;ü„Û$;
üüÃÿ[$;ü„[$;üü
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>I've double-checked that the port, baudrate, parity, bite size, and stopbits are all correct. I've also tried it with and without the sleep function between sending the command to acquire the spectra and actually reading for it. I can't think of anything else to change as far as serial connection settings. Any help would be appreciated in determining why the return is perfect in Termite but gibberish in Python. Thank you very much.</p>

<li>Not disposing dynamic child controls in Windows Forms:</li>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>// Causes Leaks  
Label label = new Label();  
this.Controls.Add(label);  
this.Controls.Remove(label);  

// Correct Code  
Label label = new Label();  
this.Controls.Add(label);  
this.Controls.Remove(label);  
label.Dispose();

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The idea is to list common pitfalls which are not too obvious (such as the above). Usually the notion is that memory leaks are not a big problem because of the garbage collector. Not like it used to be in C++.</p>

<hr>

<p>Great discussion guys, but let me clarify... by definition, if there is no reference left to an object in .NET, it will be Garbage Collected at some time. So that is not a way to induce memory leaks.</p>

For example, i have an <code>Article</code> entity with one field called <code>author</code>. This field is a ManyToOne to the <code>User</code> entity. However, this field can also relate to the <code>Group</code> entity. So, how the hell can i create such schema? </p>

<p>I have considered creating a new entity, called <code>ArticleAuthor</code> which has two fields: <code>user</code> and <code>group</code>, and depending on form input, i populate one of the fields. This way, this table <code>ArticleAuthor</code> holds it's own <code>id</code> and the proper relationship to the correct table. Is this a correct approach?</p>

<p>Take this function for example.</p>

<pre><code>function test(){
    return typeof this;
}
test.call('Abc'); // 'object'
test.call(123); // 'object'
</code></pre>

<p>They are both <code>'object'</code>, not <code>'string'</code> or <code>'number'</code>, like I'd expect.</p>

<p>After a bit of confusion (and messing with <code>instanceof</code>), I figured out what's going on.  <code>'Abc'</code> is being coverted to a <code>String</code> object, and <code>123</code> is being converted to a <code>Number</code> object.</p>

<p>Anyway, my question is why does this happen, and how do I convert an object back to its primitive?</p>

<p>I know I could use <code>(String)this</code> or <code>(Number)this</code>, but how can I do that if I don't know the type?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I was trying to do this:</p>

<pre><code>function element(){
    var $e = $(this),
    $d = $e.closest('div');
}
element.call('#myID');
</code></pre>

<p>and it wasn't working.  <code>this</code> is a <code>String</code> object, and jQuery just made a collection of objects instead of using the selector to search the DOM.</p>

<p>Module1 package.json will have its name attribute set to ""Module1"" so any modules depending on it can simply do require(""Module1"");. So far so good. However it also requires a ""main"" attribute pointing to the main JS file that will have its module.export returned from require. This is what I don't understand. Module1 doesn't have a main JS file, it is a collection of reusable JS files that each have its own module.exports returning the internal object in that file. There is no one singular JS file binding them all together that could be seen as a valid entry for main. Surely I can't just concatenate all these files together into a main bundle file? If so how would require know what to return if there are multiple module.exports?</p>

<p>This program writes 42 using g++ 4.9.2, but writes 0 using Visual Studio 2015 RC. Also, if I uncomment the explicit instantiation, VS2015RC also gives 42, which is quite interesting, as the template parameter here is different from the one used in the <code>main</code> function.</p>

<p>Is this a bug? I assume that g++ is correct, as there is a reference to <code>b</code> inside <code>foo</code>, so <code>B</code>'s constructor should be called.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: There is a simple workaround - if there is a non-static variable in <code>B</code>, that is referenced in <code>A</code>, VS2015RC will compile correctly:</p>

<pre><code>// ...

struct B {
  B() { x = 42; }
  static int x;
  int y;                         // &lt;- non-static variable

This seems like it should be a simple operation, but I can't seem to get the datasource module to load properly. I have added the maria-java-client-1.1.8.jar archive and a module.xml file to the wildfly-8.2.0.Final/modules/com/mariadb/main directory. The module.xml file is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module xmlns:""urn:jboss:module:1.1"" name=""com.mariadb""&gt;
    &lt;resources&gt;
        &lt;resource-root path=""mariadb-java-client-1.1.8.jar""/&gt;

        &lt;module name=""javax.transaction.api""/&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have also added a driver entry to the standalone.xml file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;subsystem xmlns=""urn:jboss:domain:datasources:2.0""&gt;
    &lt;datasources&gt;
        &lt;datasource jndi-name=""java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS"" pool-name=""ExampleDS"" enabled=""true"" use-java-context=""true""&gt;

            &lt;driver name=""mariadb"" module=""com.mariadb""/&gt;
        &lt;/drivers&gt;
    &lt;/datasources&gt;
&lt;/subsystem&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I have only included the driver entry for now. I will add the datasource entry after I get the module to load properly.</p>

<p>Now when I startup the server I get the following error:</p>

]) - failure description: ""JBAS010441: Failed to load module for driver [com.mariadb]""
</code></pre>

<p>According to everything that I have read, this is the proper way to configure the driver, but it is not working for me. Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?</p>

<br/>
I wrote a code for that as follows:<br/></p>

<pre><code>$._find = $.find;
$.find = function(query, context, extra, seed ){
    var start,end,expr,_ref,top,left;
    if(typeof query === 'string'){
        start = query.indexOf(""("");
        end = query.indexOf("")"",start);
        if(start !== -1 &amp;&amp; end !== -1){
            expr = ""[""+query.slice(start+1,end)+""]"";
            _ref = $.parseJSON(expr);top=_ref[0];left=_ref[1];
            console.log(document.elementFromPoint(top,left));
            return $([document.elementFromPoint(top,left)]);
        }
    }
    return $._find.apply(null,[query, context, extra, seed]);
};
</code></pre>

<p>It works for the normal queries. but when a code <code>$('(10,20)')</code> is executed, an empty jquery result is returned.<br/>The problem is happening at the line <code>return $([document.elementFromPoint(top,left)]);</code> as the previous line happens to give a valid DOM Element.<br/><br/>
Any comment is welcome.<br/></p>

<p>The <code>no such file or directory</code> errors appear to be looking in the wrong place. For example it is checking for:</p>

<p><code>HD/Users/ev_blurbs/.node-gyp/0.12.4/src</code></p>

<p>That file is instead located at:</p>

<p><code>/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/ev_blurbs/.node-gyp/0.12.4/src</code></p>

<p>I used homebrew to install node, and recently updated node, npm, and homebrew. Let me know if you notice any potential problems. Thanks for your help in advance!</p>

I have read a number of sources (e.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6345876/mule-cxf-marshall-response"">Mule CXF Marshall Response</a>) indicating if I want to receive the unmarshalled Java object returned by my operation, the cxf:jaxws-client element should be placed inside the outbound-endpoint, e.g. something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;http:outbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""9001"" path=""crmService?wsdl""&gt;

They haven't commented on the bamboo vs cedar topic so I'm reaching out here in case anybody learns things I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>In both cases <code>DB &lt; 20 ms</code>, so this is all CPU stuff, rendering templates.</p>

<p>Here’s the content of my CSV file:</p>

<pre><code>sku,qty
sku_red,444
sku_green,222
sku_blue,333
</code></pre>

<p>However, each time I uploaded it using <strong>System > Import/Export > Import > Products : Replace Existing</strong>, then it would replace all my products quantity to have : “444” (first record). It’s only taking the first row of the CSV and apply to all my products.</p>

<p>My products setup are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Red (Simple) - sku_red</li>
<li>Green (Simple) - sku_green</li>
<li>Blue (Simple)  - sku_blue</li>
<li>Main (Configurable Product associated with the 3 products above). - sku_main</li>
</ol>

<p>I tried to emulate the same thing to the base magento website (non-template) and it worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Could you please let me know how to fix this??</p>

<p>Or probably if you can locate on which file (php) that I can look for that is relevant to the magento Product Import process??</p>

<p>I've heard arguments for both ways. I find the first cleaner to ensure I have it set, and a little less code too. The pro being that you may only need to set it once without conditional. But the con being that if the argument is true, it gets set twice.</p>

works great, but when you lose a life it doesn't play the ""fail"" sound. Here is a part of my code:</p>

<p>The sounds:</p>

var fail = new Audio('sounds/fail.wav');

    if(currentPosition &lt;= '0px') { 
        $(this).remove();
        roundsMissed += 1;

            switch(roundsMissed) {

<p>But what does really happen in memory? Is a signed char represented in two's complement and a unsigned char represented without any specific representation (that is, a sequence of 11111111)?</p>

<p>How does the executable keep track of the variable type it's reading, to figure out whether the value in the CPU register is to be interpreted as two's complement or not? Is there some metadata that associates a variable name with its type?</p>

JSONArray child = new JSONArray();
child.put(""first data"");
child.put(""second data"");
parent.put(""Data"", child);

<p>Next problem on my php side is pulling the data so I can put it into my database and I am unsure exactly how this is done:</p>

$data = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);

// FOR LOOP TO INSERT DATA INTO DATABASE
for($i=0; $i&lt;count($obj['Data']); $i+=2)

     // need to get 1 &amp; 2 values to insert into database

<h2><strong>UPDATES:</strong></h2>

<p>It seems that the main table (where direct insert happens) is referred by other tables and materialized views . if i delete the data in this table to remove stale records using processed column indicator , the data spooled using MV will show old data. i think staging table is needed for my requirement. </p>

<p>To implement staging data table for this requirement </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create another parallel step to poll database and write the data whose processed column value is Y.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer data at the end of each successful file completion using step listener (afterStep method). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>or any other suggestions.</p>

It gives a flag when new values are available and we can update the variables holding these values. Following is a dummy function to mimic what this function is doing.</p>

<pre><code>function example( )
% Example function to describe functionality of NatNetOptiTrack

% Hardware initialization,    
% Retriving real time information continuously

for i = 1:100   %in real time this loop runs for ever
   data = rand(3,6);
   % Send the updated data to gui in each iteration
end

end
</code></pre>

<p>i have made a gui using guide as shown in the figure:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jwJjx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So the data to be displayed is a 3x6 matrix with columns corresponding to X Y Z Roll Pitch and Yaw values while rows correspond to Objects. </p>

<p>I want to show the continuously updated values from this function on the gui. Is there a way i can initialize gui inside my example function and update the output value by using the handles inside my loop. I tried copying the gui code inside the example function as a script, it was able to initialize but was not recognizing the handles.
Also i want to show the current values on command window when i press the button.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>When the video ends (or the user taps ""done""), the video player dismisses, but for some reason I see the Main View instead of the modal view controller (and I can't invoke the modal view again with the button, although the IBAction is being called)...</p>

<p>The present modal view code (in the Main View controller):</p>

<pre><code>SomeViewController *controller = [[[SomeViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""SomeViewController_iPhone"" bundle:nil] autorelease];
                controller.delegate = self;
                controller.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;

<p>Then, in ""SomeViewController"", I have a UIWebView that loads the YouTube video:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)embedYouTube:(NSString *)urlString frame:(CGRect)frame {
    NSString *embedHTML = @""\
    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;\
    &lt;style type=\""text/css\""&gt;\

    &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"";
    NSString *html = [NSString stringWithFormat:embedHTML, urlString, frame.size.width, frame.size.height];
    [self.webView loadHTMLString:html baseURL:nil];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The video plays just fine, but when it's done, it's get dismissed and the Main View is being showed instead of the Modal View (SomeViewController).
No error is being given though.</p>

<p>From what I understand, the video player is also a modal view, so the hierarchy is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>-- Main View
---- Modal View (SomeViewController with WebView)
-------- Video Modal View (invoked by the WebView)
</code></pre>

<p>So I don't get why is the Main View controller being shown after the Video is done playing, and why it doesn't let me invoke the modal view controller again...</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>I am experiencing issues with the postback as the form sections get hidden/shown for a split second before the postback kicks in. I have done a fair share of reading and tried multiple things but I can't get the jQuery function to work correctly.</p>

<p>I tried to register the script on page load but not success. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script language=""javascript"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e){

ScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptBlock(this, this.GetType(), ....);                    
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any tips and suggestions how to get this working would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>But problem that when test is runnig, in the log file I see all my loggin, but I don't see the hibernate sql logging. Any ideas how to fix it? If it is possible, of the fact that I passing:
 <code>-Djava.util.logging.manager=org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</code>when starting the test?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: when I have a real wildfly running, and run the Arquillian unit test. On the stage where Arquillian tries to start embedded server there are many errors in logs, but test not fails and it deploys the artifact on the running real wildfly. And what a pleasant surprise: I see all hibenate logging.
So looks like the problem in that Arquillian starts Wildfly not properly, and a big question how to teach it start server nicely.</p>

The reason for this was that controls have to be added on <strong>OnInit</strong> stage, and not after. Since I was handling an control event (for example, selectedIndexChanged on dropdownlist) I was loading them in the event handler stage. I know about the child control page cycle catch-up, but I have noticed that sometimes it just does not work. <br /></p>

<p>I once again have been tasked with developing such an application. This time I decided to take a different approach. For those selection controls which load a dynamic control based on their value, I will check their postback response values (from Request.Form) during the OnInit stage and load the control immediately. I will not load any dynamic controls from the event handler stage since this is right before OnPreRender and it too late.</p>

<p>In summary: <br/>
What are the pitfalls of checking a control's values from the Request.Form collection early in the page cycle (for example OnInit) and then performing an action, instead of check that value from the actual control later in the page cycle?</p>

<p>I'm working through the first chapter of Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development by Keith Pope in an effort to learn PHP and the MVC framework. </p>

<p>I thought I included all the paths correctly and installed PHPUnit 3.3 correctly as well as Zend 1.8 and 1.7.4 Xampp. with Ant version 1.8.2. However, I can't seem to get the first simplest build to build.</p>

<p>From looking at other q's and a's on this site I can tell some of the calls in the build.xml file for PHPunit aren't correct and I've tried to correct them, but now I'm getting the error that C:\xampp\htdocs\zendStoreFront/library/Zend does not exist and when I add the Zend directory in I get lots and lots of errors which is telling me that's probably not the right answer.</p>

<p>I understand there's a lot going on in the whole project and I'm willing to take the time to learn, but one question- On the line that says ""   --log-xml ${basedir}/build/logs/phpunit.xml "", is this file expected to be in this directory already, or does the build process create the file? On some attempts an error that's echo'd back say that file doesn't exist and currently there is no file in that directory.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I'm looking for a Java class which will help me do the same kinds of things, but without any Python.</p>

<p>The neat thing about my home-made python library is that it allows me to work at a very high-level. Consumers of my library are entirely shielded from the complexities of what goes on within Hudson. Most of the things I need to do can be expressed in one-line functions:</p>

<p>For example I can search for and download artifacts. I can find jobs whose results match certain criteria. I can even remotely trigger jobs or query the status of jobs. The only problems with my library are that for boring legal reasons it must remain closed-source, and being Python I've no hope of being able to integrate it into Ant. </p>

<p>I'd like to make a lot of my Hudson magic work from Ant scripts - and for this I need to re-implement some of my Hudson stuff as an ant-task in Java. For that I'd need a java library which exposes a lot of what Hudson does at a high level. Does such a project exist? If so can you let me know where I can find it?</p>

<p>Now, to handle the basic authentication I followed <a href=""http://www.iis.net/learn/develop/runtime-extensibility/developing-a-module-using-net"" rel=""nofollow"">Mike Volodarsky's tutorial on ""Developing a Module Using .NET""</a>.</p>

<p>This essentially gives me a class which validates the request.</p>

<p>When I run the debugger the browser requests the username/password from me. When I enter them it then validates through my custom validator and returns true, however, the service call then fails with the error at the top of this question.</p>

<p>As I said, if i enable anonymous authentication all works. I can visit <code>http://mySite/Product/GetProducts</code> and my test string is returned.</p>

<p>I have tried numerous entries in the web.config setting various Services/Bindings/Behaviours etc to enable Basic Auth, though they typically result in the above error. </p>

<p>I have a feeling it is because I am mixing technologies; I.E using routing to call my service rather than using endpoints etc.. </p>

<p>That said, my understanding of WCF services is pretty limited at the moment.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I need to be able to use routing (to negate .svc in URL) and enable basic authentication, but have my own custom validator as usernames/passwords will be in SQL and not help on the server/IIS itself.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Oh... I also tried this in my config.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bindings&gt;
        &lt;basicHttpBinding&gt;
            &lt;binding name=""httpBinding""&gt;
                &lt;security mode=""Transport""&gt;
                    &lt;transport clientCredentialType=""Basic"" /&gt;
                &lt;/security&gt;
            &lt;/binding&gt;
        &lt;/basicHttpBinding&gt;
    &lt;/bindings&gt;

<p>Still resulted in the same error</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> In MVP pattern, how to create a Property of type List&lt;T&gt; in the View, where T is a Data Type generated by Entity Framework? </p>

<p>In the code below, ""TeamMember"" in List&lt;TeamMember&gt; is a class created by Entity Framework based on the SQL Table TeamMembersTable.
The issue here is I'm creating a List&lt;T&gt; property in my View, where T is a Data Type from my Entity Framework model. This seems to be violating separation of concerns, since the view is now dependent on Data Types from my Model layer. How to accomplish clean separation of View and Model in this scenario?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In case of a simple TextBox, its easy since the data type is a .NET type like String or DataTime. However, if the DataType of property to be created in View is from the model, it seems to make View more tightly coupled with Model as far as data types are concerned.</p>

<pre><code>//***************Simplified Code Sample*******************//
using Model;

namespace View
{
    public interface IEmployeeView

        List&lt;TeamMember&gt; TeamMembers { set; }

<li><p>Uploaded all <code>.js</code> files to server and called in head section AFTER the <code>jQuery</code> lib</p></li>

<li><p>inserted the <code>html</code> and <code>ul</code> containing the images into the appropriate body section</p></li>

<pre><code>&lt;script type = 'text/javascript'&gt;

     $('#carousel').elastislide();

      &lt;/script&gt;

<p>However I keep getting the following error from google JS Console:</p>

<p>This is what I've done:</p>

<pre><code>importer.register(function(app, auth, database) {

  importer.aggregateAsset('js', 'xml2json.min.js');

  //We enable routing. By default the Package Object is passed to the routes
  importer.routes(app, auth, database);

  //We are adding a link to the main menu for all admin users
  VavelImporter.menus.add({
    title: 'importer example page',
    link: 'importer example page',
    roles: ['admin'],
    menu: 'main'
  });

  return importer;
});
</code></pre>

<p>The important line is: importer.aggregateAsset('js', 'xml2json.min.js'); My asset (xml2json.min.js) is located under <strong>importer/public/assets/js/xml2json.min.js</strong>.</p>

<p>I need someone to explain me where to put that asset so Mean.io locates that file.</p>

For those who do not know what ISSUU is, it is a website where registered users can upload their PDF files and they get automatically converted into a nice page flip. Notice that I don't want to do it myself in Dreamweaver every time I upload a new PDF but I want to have some kind of upload form that will do the work for all registered users.</p>

<p>Now I have been searching for some hours now and all I can find is software or other websites to do that. What I want is a way to make it in the website, not by having to log in in another website or by having to install some software in my pc.</p>

<p>I am not asking for the code here. What I would like to get from you is tips of where to start, maybe some tut, some technique, etc...</p>

<p>My preference is that the system uses CSS3 and HTML5, but other suggestions are also welcome. I would like to avoid Flash due to problems on mobile devices.</p>

<p>So, how would I do this? Many thanks in advance!</p>

<li>It returns ""item found"" if the item exists.</li>
<li>It returns ""item not found"" if the item does not exist.</li>

<p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>jQuery-mobile autocomplete hides the list items until user input happens using CSS ""display: none;"".  Would this prevent the click function from being assigned?  If so, how do I work around this?</p>

<p>FURTHER UPDATE:</p>

<p>Found that the ""live"" function is depreciated.  Changed it to ""on"" instead.  Unfortunately this didn't fix the problem :-(</p>

<p>Could it be because the ""li"" items are hidden by CSS when the page is loaded?</p>

<p>I've deployed it here: </p>

<p>Currently working building a password management web application for managing Oracle user accounts (C#).</p>

<p>The scope calls for verification of the users Oracle username and password before they're allowed to set a new password. Without creating a table of users passwords (hashed or otherwise, this is a security risk), how can I verify the old users password?</p>

<p>My current solution is to make an attempt to connect to the database using the username/password specified by the user. Too many attempts at this would lock the user out on the Oracle end, so brute forcing isn't too plausible. Are there other security risks here I am missing or is there a better way of handling this?</p>

<p>We use AD as primary authentication but the AD accounts aren't tied to the Oracle accounts so it's just a preliminary check.</p>

<p>I'm building a site which will gather news stories from about 35 different RSS feeds, storing in an array.  I'm using a foreach() loop to search the title and description to see if it contains one of about 40 keywords, using substr() for each article. If the search is successful, that article is stored in a DB, and ultimately will appear on the site.</p>

<p>The script runs every 30 mins. Trouble is, it takes 1-3 mins depending on how many stories are returned. Not 'terrible' but on a shard hosting env, I can see this causing plenty of issues, especially as the site grows and more feeds/keywords are added.</p>

<p>Are there any ways that I can optimize the 'searching' of keywords, so that I can speed up the 'indexing'?</p>

"18558198","1","","","2013-09-01 11:58:02","","1","207","<p>I try to model a view on cassandra.
So the view looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>link name | unique visits | non unique visits | ...
---------------------------------------------------
page 1    | 4             | 8                 | ...
page 2    | 2             | 4                 | ...
page 3    | 3             | 8                 | ...
page 4    | 1             | 1                 | ...
page 5    | 9             | 11                | ...
...

&lt;page1&gt;&lt;page2&gt;&lt;page3&gt;...&lt;page n&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the main requirement here is that I need to show that data for a specified date range. For example the user
can change ""from"" and ""to"" date pickers and ""unique visits"" | ""non unique visits"" should display the sum of clicks
in that date range.
The other requirement that is killing all my trials is that the data should be sortable on ""unique visits"" and ""non unique visits"" base.</p>

<p>I've done such model in the past MySql using the following scheme:<br />
    link_id             bigint<br />
    date                datetime<br />
    unique_visits           int<br />
    non_unique_visits       int<br /></p>

<p>where (link_id, date) -> primary key</p>

<p>So something like the query bellow was giving a satisfying result.</p>

<p>SELECT link_id, date, SUM(unique_visits) AS unique_visits_sum, SUM(non_unique_visits) AS non_unique_visits_sum 
FROM agg_clicks
GROUP BY link_id, date
ORDER BY unique_visits DESC
LIMIT 0, 50</p>

<p>But as you understand this is not too scalable and the performance of the query depends on page count and the days count.
Another issue is that a full table scan is needed to perform the sorting on a calculated field.</p>

<p>So, data modeling experts, PLEASE!!! a little advise. 
And thank you very much in advance.</p>

I am wondering if i need to worry about calling a <code>lock()</code> statement when reading the elapsed property of a <code>Stopwatch</code> while it is still running. </p>

<p>Also is a <code>Stopwatch</code> what I should be using to measure run-times of a thread. I have read in other similar questions a <code>DispatchTimer</code> could be used. I have also looked into using events, however that seemed like a lot of overhead for something so simple, please inform me if that is just plain wrong and I should be using events. Some simple code to illustrate what I am talking about.</p>

<pre><code> class foo
 {
      private bool _isRunning { get; set; }
      private Stopwatch sw { get; set; }
      public void StartThread()
      {
          this._isRunning = true;
          new Thread(new ThreadStart(this.DoWork)).Start();
          this.sw.Restart();
      }     
      public void StopThread()
      {
          this._isRunning = false;
          this.sw.Stop();
      }
      private void DoWork()
      {
          while(this._isRunning)
          {
               //Do Stuff
          }
      }
      public TimeSpan GetRuntime()
      {
          return this.sw.Elapsed;
      }
      public foo()
      {
          _isRunning = false;
          sw = new Stopwatch();
      }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Say in an application using the above class I were to call <code>GetRuntime()</code> from a different thread before I stop the <code>Stopwatch</code> would I need to add a <code>lock()</code> statement to ensure that I get the correct data, and that I wont be blocking the <code>Stopwatch</code> from continuing to run. Or am i correct in thinking that it does not need a <code>lock()</code> and will be fine as is.</p>

<p>I do understand that you can theoretically run as many reads as you would like, I am just curious seeing as the Elapsed properties backing store is constantly being written to if that changed things or not. I have read a lot of information about thread safety, but I am just looking for a clarification and confirmation I am indeed thinking about this correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> To ease my workflow while writing Bukkit plugins (the basically de-facto API for the Minecraft Server until Sponge gets it's implementation going), I've decided to put together a ""mini-framework"" for myself to not have to repeat the same tasks over and over again. (Also, I'm trying to design it to not depend too much on Bukkit, so I can continue using it on Sponge by just changing my implementation)</p>

<p><strong>Intention:</strong> Command handling in Bukkit is, frankly, a mess. You have to define your root command (for example, you want to run /test ingame, ""test"" is the root) in a YML file (instead of calling some sort of factory?), child command handling is nonexistant and implementation details is hidden so producing 100% reliable results is hard. It's the only part of Bukkit that has annoyed me, and it was the main initiator of me deciding to write a framework.</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Abstract away the nasty Bukkit command handling, and replace it with something that's clean.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Working towards it:</strong></h2>

<p>This is going to be the long paragraph where I'm going to explain how Bukkit command handling is originally implemented, as that will give a deeper understanding of important command parameters and such.</p>

<p>Any user connected to a Minecraft server can start a chat message with '/', which will result in it being parsed as a command.</p>

<p>To offer an example situation, any player in Minecraft has a life bar, which defaults to capping at 10 hearts, and depletes when taking damage. The maximum and current ""hearts"" (read: health) may be set by the server at any time.</p>

<p>Lets say we want to define a command like this:</p>

<pre><code>/sethealth &lt;current/maximum&gt; &lt;player or * for all&gt; &lt;value&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To start implementing this...oh boy. If you like clean code, I'd say skip this...I'll comment to explain, and whenever I feel like Bukkit did a mistake.</p>

<p><em>The mandatory plugin.yml</em>:</p>

<pre><code># Full name of the file extending JavaPlugin
# My best guess? Makes lazy-loading the plugin possible
# (aka: just load classes that are actually used by replacing classloader methods)
main: com.gmail.zkfreddit.sampleplugin.SampleJavaPlugin

# Name of the plugin.
# Why not have this as an annotation on the plugin class?
name: SamplePlugin

# Version of the plugin. Why is this even required? Default could be 1.0.
# And again, could be an annotation on the plugin class...
version: 1.0

# Command section. Instead of calling some sort of factory method...
commands:
    # Our '/sethealth' command, which we want to have registered.
    sethealth:
        # The command description to appear in Help Topics
        # (available via '/help' on almost any Bukkit implementation)
        description: Set the maximum or current health of the player

        # Usage of the command (will explain later)
        usage: /sethealth &lt;current/maximum&gt; &lt;player/* for all&gt; &lt;newValue&gt;

        # Bukkit has a simple string-based permission system, 
        # this will be the command permission
        # (and as no default is specified,
        # will default to ""everybody has it"")
        permission: sampleplugin.sethealth
</code></pre>

<p>The main plugin class:</p>

<pre><code>package com.gmail.zkfreddit.sampleplugin;

import org.bukkit.command.PluginCommand;
import org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin;

public class SampleJavaPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    //Called when the server enables our plugin
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        //Get the command object for our ""sethealth"" command.
        //This basically ties code to configuration, and I'm pretty sure is considered bad practice...
        PluginCommand command = getCommand(""sethealth"");

        //Set the executor of that command to our executor.
        command.setExecutor(new SampleCommandExecutor());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The command executor:</p>

        double newHealth;

        try {

</code></pre>

<p>Now you may understand why I'm choosing to abstract the command handling away in my framework. I don't think I'm alone in thinking that this way is <strong>not self-documenting</strong> and <strong>handling child commands this way does not feel right</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>My Intention:</strong></h2>

<p>Similiar to how the <a href=""http://wiki.bukkit.org/Introduction_to_the_New_Event_System"">Bukkit Event System</a> works, I want to develop a framework/API to abstract this away.</p>

<p>My idea is <strong>annotating command methods</strong> with a respective annotation that includes all neccassary information, and use some sort of registerer (in the event case: <code>Bukkit.getPluginManager().registerEvents(Listener, Plugin)</code>) to register the command.</p>

<p>Again similiar to the Event API, command methods would have a definied signature. As dealing with multiple parameters is annoying, I decided to pack it all in a context interface (also, this way I do not break all previous code in case I need to add something to the context!). However, I also needed a return type in case I want to display the usage quickly (but I'm not going to pick a boolean, that's for sure!), or do some other stuff. So, my idea signature boils down to <code>CommandResult &lt;anyMethodName&gt;(CommandContext)</code>.</p>

<p>The command registration would then create the command instances for annotated methods and register them.</p>

<p>My basic outline took form. Note that I haven't came around to writing JavaDoc yet, I added some quick comments on not self-documenting code.</p>

<p>Command registration:</p>

<pre><code>package com.gmail.zkfreddit.pluginframework.api.command;

public interface CommandRegistration {

    public static enum ResultType {
        REGISTERED,
        RENAMED_AND_REGISTERED,
        FAILURE
    }

    public static interface Result {
        ResultType getType();

        //For RENAMED_AND_REGISTERED
        Command getConflictCommand();

        //For FAILURE
        Throwable getException();

        //If the command got registered in some way
        boolean registered();
    }

    Result register(Object commandObject);

}
</code></pre>

<p>The command result enumeration:</p>

<pre><code>package com.gmail.zkfreddit.pluginframework.api.command;

public enum CommandResult {

    //Command executed and handlded
    HANDLED,

    //Show the usage for this command as some parameter is wrong
    SHOW_USAGE,

    //Possibly more?
}
</code></pre>

<p>The command context:</p>

<pre><code>package com.gmail.zkfreddit.pluginframework.api.command;

import org.bukkit.command.CommandSender;

import java.util.List;

public interface CommandContext {

    CommandSender getSender();

    List&lt;Object&gt; getArguments();

    @Deprecated
    String getLabel();

    @Deprecated
    //Get the command annotation of the executed command
    Command getCommand();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The main command annotation to be put on command methods:</p>

<pre><code>package com.gmail.zkfreddit.pluginframework.api.command;

import org.bukkit.permissions.PermissionDefault;

public @interface Command {

    public static final String DEFAULT_STRING = """";

    String name();

    String description() default DEFAULT_STRING;

    String usageMessage() default DEFAULT_STRING;

    String permission() default DEFAULT_STRING;

    PermissionDefault permissionDefault() default PermissionDefault.TRUE;

    Class[] autoParse() default {};
}
</code></pre>

<p>The autoParse intention is that I can define something quick, and if parsing fails, it just displays the usage message of the command.</p>

<p>Now, once I have my implementation written up, I can rewrite the mentioned ""sethealth"" command executor to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>package com.gmail.zkfreddit.sampleplugin;

import de.web.paulschwandes.pluginframework.api.command.Command;
import de.web.paulschwandes.pluginframework.api.command.CommandContext;
import org.bukkit.entity.Player;
import org.bukkit.permissions.PermissionDefault;

public class BetterCommandExecutor {

    public static enum HealthOperationType {
        CURRENT,
        MAXIMUM;

        public void executeOn(Player player, double newHealth) {
            switch (this) {
                case CURRENT:
                    player.setHealth(newHealth);
                    break;
                case MAXIMUM:
                    player.setMaxHealth(newHealth);
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

    @Command(
            name = ""sethealth"",
            description = ""Set health values for any or all players"",
            usageMessage = ""/sethealth &lt;current/maximum&gt; &lt;player/* for all&gt; &lt;newHealth&gt;"",
            permission = ""sampleplugin.sethealth"",
            autoParse = {HealthOperationType.class, Player[].class, Double.class} //Player[] as there may be multiple players matched
    )
    public CommandResult setHealth(CommandContext context) {
        HealthOperationType operationType = (HealthOperationType) context.getArguments().get(0);
        Player[] matchedPlayers = (Player[]) context.getArguments().get(1);
        double newHealth = (Double) context.getArguments().get(2);

        for (Player player : matchedPlayers) {
            operationType.executeOn(player, newHealth);
        }

        return CommandResult.HANDLED;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I believe I speak for most here that this way feels cleaner.</p>

<p>So where am I asking a question here?</p>

<h2><strong>Where I'm stuck.</strong></h2>

<p><em>Child command handling.</em></p>

<p>In the example, I was able to get away with a simple enum based on the two cases for the first argument.</p>

<p>There may be cases where I have to create a lot of child commands similiar to ""current/maximum"". A good example may be something that handles joining players together as a team - I would need:</p>

<pre><code>/team create ...
/team delete ...
/team addmember/join ...
/team removemember/leave ...
</code></pre>

<p>etc. - I want to be able to create seperate classes for these child commands.</p>

<p>How exactly am I going to introduce a clean way to say ""Hey, when the first argument of this matches something, do this and that!"" - heck, the ""matched"" part doesn't even have to be a hardcoded String, I may want something like</p>

<pre><code>/team [player] info
</code></pre>

<p>at the same time, while still matching all the previous child commands.</p>

<p>Not only do I have to link to child command methods, I also have to somehow link the required object - after all, my (future) command registration will take an instantiated object (in the example case, of BetterCommandExecutor) and register it. How will I tell ""Use this child command instance!"" to the registration when passing in the object?</p>

<p>I have been thinking about saying ""**** everything, link to a child command class and just instantiate the no-args constructor of it"", but while this would probaly procude the least code, it would not give much insight into how exactly child command instances get created. If I do decide to go that way, I'll probaly just define a <code>childs</code> parameter in my <code>Command</code> annotation, and make it take some sort of @ChildCommand annotation list (annotations in annotations? Yo dawk, why not?).</p>

<hr>

<p>So after all this, the question is: With this setup, is there a way I will be able to cleanly define child commands, or will I have to change my footing completely? I thought about extending from some sort of abstract BaseCommand (with an abstract getChildCommands() method), but the annotation method has the advantage of being able to handle multiple commands from one class. Also, as far as I have picked up open-source code until now, I get the impression that <code>extends</code> is 2011 and <code>implements</code> is the flavour of the year, so I should probaly not force myself to extend something every time I'm creating some sort of command handler.</p>

<p><strong>I am sorry for the long post. This went longer than I expected :/</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit #1:</strong></p>

<p>I've just realized what I am basically creating is some sort of...tree? of commands. However, just simply using some sort of CommandTreeBuilder falls away as it goes against one of the things I wanted from this idea: Being able to define multiple command handlers in one class. Back to brainstorming.</p>

E.g: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" name=""people[0].FirstName"" value=""George"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, I have the following situation:</p>

<pre><code>public class ProjectEditModel
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }

        public List&lt;ProjectIdea&gt; Ideas { get; set; }

    public class ProjectIdea
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }

        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I am using a form the display the ProjectEditModel, and a PartialView to display the ProjectIdeas, which is quite complex, so I do not want to keep everything in one razur view.
this looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    @using (Html.BeginForm())
    {
        @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
        @Html.HiddenFor(mbox =&gt; Model.ID)

        @Html.Partial(""AddAnotherProjectIdea"", Model.Ideas)

        &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""col-md-offset-0 col-md-10""&gt;
                &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""@IndexRes.ButtonCreateNew"" class=""btn btn-primary"" /&gt;
                @Html.ActionLink(CommonRes.ButtonToIndex, ""Index"", null, new { @class = ""btn btn-primary"" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and the AddAnotherProjectIdea-Partialview:</p>

<pre><code>@model List&lt;Domain.Entities.ProjectIdea&gt;

&lt;div id=""IdeaList""&gt;
    @for (int i = 0; i &lt; Model.Count(); i++)
    {
        @Html.HiddenFor(mbox =&gt; Model[i].ID)

        &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;
            @Html.LabelFor(m =&gt; Model[i].Name, htmlAttributes: new { @class = ""control-label col-md-2"" })
            &lt;div class=""col-md-10""&gt;
                @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; Model[i].Name, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = ""form-control"" } })

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    }
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Unfortunately, this construct results in an editor like
    
Which does not bind to the ProjectEditModel, because the ""Ideas"" name is missing from the name. Changing it manually works:
    </p>

<p>Is there an easy way to add this Property-Name to the name or can I trick the binding into accepting the name without the Propertyname?</p>

<p>The movements are: </p>

<ul>
<li>North -> 0</li>
<li>South -> 1</li>
<li>East -> 2</li>
<li>West -> 3</li>
</ul>

<p>The main objective is that the hole movement solution wouln't be out of bounds of the matrix.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<p>Iterate until a valid solution is found.</p>

<pre><code>while ! valid                                                                         
  start_solution = generate_random_solution
  valid = validate_solution(start_solution)
end   
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have any problem generating random vectors with the movment numbers. That is the function of the generate_random_solution.</p>

<pre><code>def validate_solution(solution)
  position = @start.dup
  move_count = 0
  solution.each do |movement|
    next_position = move(movement, position)
    unless next_position.nil?
      position = next_position
      move_count += 1
    end
  end
  move_count == @num_moves ? true : false
end      
</code></pre>

<p>@start in this case is (0,0) the first position of a 3x3 matrix. 
@num_moves is N * N - 1. The number of movements that I can do in the matrix.</p>

<p>Here is the function that returns the new position, if the movement is invalid the default value is nil.</p>

<pre><code>def move(mov, pos)
  case mov
    when 0 # NORTH
      return Position.new(pos.x, pos.y - 1) if pos.y &gt; 0
    when 1 # SOUTH
      return Position.new(pos.x, pos.y + 1) if pos.y &lt; @m
    when 2 # EAST
      return Position.new(pos.x + 1, pos.y) if pos.x &lt; @n
    when 3 # WEST
      return Position.new(pos.x - 1, pos.y) if pos.x &gt; 0
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my problem. It seems that in some point the movement function don't return nil and allow that a vector be out of bounds. </p>

<p>My understanding of sorting routines is not great. I asked for help with converting an already available code for mergesort from <code>integer type</code> to <code>string type</code> here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12673633/delphi-mergesort-for-string-arrays"">delphi mergesort for string arrays</a>. After I received my answer I set out to understand the sorting routine.</p>

<p>Couple of resources came handy to help understanding:</p>

<li><a href=""http://www.iti.fh-flensburg.de/lang/algorithmen/sortieren/merge/mergen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iti.fh-flensburg.de/lang/algorithmen/sortieren/merge/mergen.htm</a></li>

</ol>

<p>I attempted to dissect the code to follow it along. This question is not my attempt to validate my own understanding of mergesort, but rather show the sorting routine in a clear manner. The value of this question is for people attempting to understand mergesort better. This is essential as other sorts can be understood easier if you understand one prototype well.</p>

<p><strong>My question is why did we add ""1"" to set length and to ""Result""</strong></p>

<pre><code>SetLength(AVals, Length(Vals) div 2 + 1);
Result := 1 + PerformMergeSort(0, High(Vals));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>and why did we subtract ""1"" here?</strong> <em>EDIT: I think K will be out of bounds if not subtract 1?</em></p>

<pre><code>Result := k - 1;
</code></pre>

<p>here is the code in this question; BTW this is an optimized mergesort as it copies only half the array:</p>

<pre><code>function MergeSortRemoveDuplicates(var Vals: array of Integer):Integer;
var
  AVals: array of Integer;

   //returns index of the last valid element
  function Merge(I0, I1, J0, J1: Integer):Integer;
  var
    i, j, k, LC:Integer;
  begin
    LC := I1 - I0;
    for i := 0 to LC do
      AVals[i]:=Vals[i + I0];
      //copy lower half or Vals into temporary array AVals

    k := I0;
    i := 0;
    j := J0;
    while ((i &lt;= LC) and (j &lt;= J1)) do
    if (AVals[i] &lt; Vals[j]) then begin
      Vals[k] := AVals[i];
      inc(i);
      inc(k);
    end else  if (AVals[i] &gt; Vals[j]) then begin
      Vals[k]:=Vals[j];
      inc(k);
      inc(j);
    end else begin //duplicate
      Vals[k] := AVals[i];
      inc(i);
      inc(j);
      inc(k);
    end;

    //copy the rest
    while i &lt;= LC do begin
      Vals[k] := AVals[i];
      inc(i);
      inc(k);
    end;

    if k &lt;&gt; j then
      while j &lt;= J1 do begin
        Vals[k]:=Vals[j];
        inc(k);
        inc(j);
      end;

    Result := k - 1;
  end;

 //returns index of the last valid element

  function PerformMergeSort(ALo, AHi:Integer): Integer; //returns
  var
    AMid, I1, J1:Integer;
  begin

  //It would be wise to use Insertion Sort when (AHi - ALo) is small (about 32-100)
    if (ALo &lt; AHi) then
    begin
      AMid:=(ALo + AHi) shr 1;
      I1 := PerformMergeSort(ALo, AMid);
      J1 := PerformMergeSort(AMid + 1, AHi);
      Result := Merge(ALo, I1, AMid + 1, J1);
    end else
      Result := ALo;
  end;

begin

<p>What I want to do (for starters), is to allow the following: someone calls Alice.  Instead of picking up the physical SIP phone, she instead clicks on some button (let's say one marked <code>Answer</code>) on her computer screen.

<p>One more example. I have object A, which keeps reference (B &amp;b) to another object B. Object B have native array which I will reallocate/ std::vector (which I think is similar in this particular case ). Pseudo-code:</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cv</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mutable - defines that a member of a class does not affect the

</blockquote>

<p>What is this <code>externally visible state of the class</code> ? Do I change it when I increase array size, reallocate something? If no, when it changes at all?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I want to extract the data entered into the text box and add it in a line in the bottom div ""persisted-items"" on click of the Add button. Also, I want to add a small icon or a link ""Delete"" beside that in a row so that I can delete it when clicked.</p>

<p>I tried experimenting with the same kind of scenario using the table rows, but couldn't go further.</p>

<p>I did something like the following to extract the information and add to the div.:</p>

<pre><code>$('#add-btn').click(function(){
  $(""#persisted-items"").append($(""#items"").val());
  $(""#persisted-items"").append($(""#quantity"").val());
  $(""#persisted-items"").append($(""#in-order"").val());
});
</code></pre>

<p>Please help,</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I'm also using ""manual"" dependency injection within my generic interface. I would like to know if, in my situation, which is more appropriate: generic interface or generic method?</p>

<p>Here's a simplified code sample to show you:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDirectorySource&lt;T&gt; where T : IDirectoryEntry {
    IDirectorySearcher&lt;T&gt; Searcher { get; }

    CustomSet&lt;T&gt; ToList(); // Related to my question, as I will here only return Searcher.ToList();
}

public interface IDirectorySearcher&lt;T&gt; where T : IDirectoryEntry {
    DirectorySearcher NativeSearcher { get; }

    CustomSet&lt;T&gt; ToList(); // Related to my question...
}

public sealed class GroupSearcher : IDirectorySearcher&lt;Group&gt; {
    public GroupSearcher(DirectoryEntry root, SearchScope scope) {
        // Instantiating...
    }

    public DirectorySearcher NativeSearcher { get; private set; }

    public CustomSet&lt;T&gt; ToList() { // That is the point of my question.
        // Listing all T objects found in AD...
    }
}

public sealed class DirectorySource&lt;T&gt; : IDirectorySource&lt;T&gt; where T : IDirectoryEntry {

    public DirectorySource(IDirectorySearcher&lt;T&gt; searcher) {
        Searcher = searcher;
    }

    public IDirectorySearcher&lt;T&gt; Searcher { get; private set; }

    public CustomSet&lt;T&gt; ToList() { // Here's the point to my question.
        return Searcher.ToList();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, here's my point. I would like to make my <code>IDirectorySource</code> interface non-generic, as I will promote my <code>DirectorySource&lt;T&gt;</code> class to <em>public</em>. So I would only need to declare a source like so:</p>

<pre><code>GroupSearcher groupSearcher = new GroupSearcher(root, scope);
IDirectorySource groups = new DirectorySource&lt;Group&gt;(groupSearcher);
</code></pre>

<p>So I would able to retrive a list of the groups:</p>

<pre><code>groups.ToList(); // Getting all the existing groups in AD here...
</code></pre>

<p>But I wonder whether I should let my <code>IDirectorySource&lt;T&gt;</code> interface generic, or make it non-generic and make my <code>IDirectorySource.ToList()</code> method generic instead, so I would not need to type my interface, but only the class which would provide me with an instance of my interface.</p>

<p>Would it be better to write my interface like so:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDirectorySource {
    CustomSet&lt;T&gt; ToList&lt;T&gt;();
} // With all the appropriate changes, indeed.
</code></pre>

<p>I am aware that this perhaps is not clear enough. Feel free to ask me your questions so that I may help you to help me.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance! =)</p>

The table I have created takes the ID's of the Combo Animal, the Gene it is combined with, and that of the New animal from the Animals table to display the information. The table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Creature Combos Table:
ComboID (PK) | NewAnimalID (FK) | ComboAnimalID (FK) | GeneID (FK) |
</code></pre>

<p>The procedure I created to select records from the Combos table populates my datalist with information about the combo animal, gene, and new animal by joining the Animal and Genes tables based on the ID's of the combo, new animal, and genes.:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[SelectCreatureCombos]
AS
    SELECT * FROM [CreatureCombos]
    INNER JOIN [Animals] ON [CreatureCombos].[NewCreatureID] = [Animals].[AnimalId]
    INNER JOIN [Animals] ON [CreatureCombos].[ComboAnimalID] = [Animals].[AnimalId]
    INNER JOIN [Genes] ON [CreatureCombos].[ComboGeneID] = [Genes].[GeneId] ;

<p>Desired Results of Procedure:</p>

<pre><code>(New) Animal (Name) | AnimalImg | AnimalAltText | AnimalToolTip | (Combo) Animal (name) | AnimalImg | AnimalAltText | AnimalToolTip | Gene | GeneImg | GeneAltText | GeneToolTip | 
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the page, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>The objects ""Animals"" and ""Animals"" in the FROM clause have the same exposed names. Use correlation names to distinguish them.
</code></pre>

<p>I must admit I am still a little new to SQL; I can insert, select, and update like a pro, but joins and aliases and correlation names are a little beyond me. Any other advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

In addition to needing a rule engine to to provide information back to a user, I also will need to initiate workflow tasks that are assigned to my employees, vendors, or back to the user based on the rule engine logic. </p>

<p>I understand the business logic behind my idea, and how to use content management systems such as drupal. However, I'm not sure how to integrate my business logic, rules based on external market trends, and workflow technology into a content management system I can update as things change.  I am looking for a solution that has a user interface to allow me to update the questions required (such as editing content types in Drupal), update my consultative knowledge database, and update the rules on how to apply them without having to hire a programmer when the business landscape changes.</p>

<p>In my research, I understand drupal rules module is not a true rete rules engine - so I don't believe I can use.</p>

<p>The concept of combining Drupal's content types (for collecting user information and editing fields), Jboss Drools' rule engine (for creating rules), and salesforce.com's  workflow editor (for creating and assigning workflow tasks) is what I'm looking for.  <strong>Is there anything out there that brings all of this together, in one web based user/admin solution that can be set up and used similar to Drupal's UI experience?</strong>  In addition, am I even on the right track as far as the best way accomplish?</p>

When RIA services creates the model in Silverlight, it generates a (let's call it) ""RIA Services"" model. That is, it's not just a copy of my POCOs. These classes in the model, to begin with, are sealed, and for instance expose Lists as EntityCollections.</p>

<p>Since they are sealed, I cannot extend them to (say) provide extra functionality (that doesn't belong in the server), or implement an interface.</p>

<p>I can, however, extend the functionality of these classes by implementing the defined partial methods, and adding extra properties to the <em>other</em> partial class.</p>

<p>Is doing so generally discouraged. Is it some kind of code smell? Is there a good reason why I <em>shouldn't</em> do this?</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>The backlog parameter defines the maximum length for the queue of pending
 connections.  If a connection request arrives with the queue full, the
 client may receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED.  Alterna-
 tively, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request
 may be ignored so that retries may succeed.

<p>which means my client connect would <em>fail</em> or <em>retry</em> later.</p>

<p>But when my client running, it simply get a SIGPIPE signal and failed.</p>

<p>From <strong>unix network programming</strong>, <code>connect()</code> will start <strong>3-times hand shake routine</strong>, and  return when server send <strong>syn &amp;&amp; ack</strong>.</p>

<p>From <code>tcpdump</code> output, top 10 lines told that server reply syn &amp; sck although <strong>backlog</strong> is 2. Later,  client send <strong>last-time ack</strong> and server <strong>return rst</strong>.</p>

<p>In my opinion, connect return with value != -1 means connection is established &amp; client is able to send data. But log shows above shows it doesn't work that way. </p>

<p>So can anyone tell me which is <em>correct</em>?</p>

I'm impressed by how rapidly you can develop an application with these tools, and you get a lot ""for free"", such as the Silverlight UI automatically knowing about certain validations that are included as DataAnnotations on the EF model.  However, it seems like in a large application it would be undesirable to have a dependency on EF pushed all the way through the entire application including the business logic and UI.</p>

<p>I know that you can use POCO / IPOCO with Entity Framework, and that is certainly an option for me.  However, if you go that route, you lose some of the ""automagic"" stuff such as Silverlight being able to show model validations without any extra work.</p>

<p>How are people dealing with this?  Do you give up some of the power and put interfaces in between the different layers in order to decouple the other layers from EF?

I wish to run my python scripts using <code>python.exe</code> with possibly a command line argument or such to make the python script pause after the execution.
Ideal solution would be something like <code>python myscript.py -pause</code> and now it'd say <em>""Press any key to continue ...""</em> after the execution.
As far as I know this is not possible, but I'm looking for a similar solution.</p>

<p>The solutions I've found so far are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Running my script with cmd line: <code>cmd /K python myscript.py</code> but it leaves the cmd window open stupidly, I now need to write <em>exit</em> to get back to my text editor.</li>
<li>Manually adding <code>input(""Press any key to continue ..."")</code> to my python scripts, but I often need to open like 25 different scripts within an hour, and it feels stupid to write it for each one of them, and then remove it once I'm done.</li>

<p>I am doing an app which has a feature to rotate and re size a view. i have  implemented this feature but i do face an issue.</p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong></p>

<p>The View wil be resized when dragging its four corners, after resizing it i can  rotate the view in both directions. </p>

<p>Once the rotation is done, if i try again to resize the view by dragging its corner, the view's size gone to unpredictable value and its moving all around the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Similar Problem</strong></p>

<p>I googled lot but i did not get any perfect answer. some people has asked same question but none of them get any good result. I spend lots of time on it but i could not solve it. please help me out

<p>My question now is, how do I actually prevent duplicates?  Due to the parallel rollout of the new system with the old, the import will unfortunately need to be run more than once.  I can't make the ""import_id"" field PK/UNIQUE because it will have null values for fields that do not come from the old table, thereby throwing an error when adding new fields.

For a quick solution, I redirected my other domain designbids.in to designbids.co/wordpress which opens my website fine but I didnt want the redirection to show. 
For this, I used this masking technique on godaddy but redirection with masking makes mobile optimization goes bad. It basically shows the desktop version on mobiles.
Currently, I have configured redirection without masking. So when I enter designbids.in, I can see it redirect to Designbids.in/wordpress.</p>

<p>Question: Is there any way that I can move my files out of the wordpress folder to solve this /wordpress problem? What is the safest way to get rid of this sort of redirection without messing with mobile optimization?</p>

<p>If i'm launching encoding from php but with ""<strong>&amp;</strong>"" on the end of command, then all comes fine, encoding still eats cpu but site fully responsible for user.</p>

I used to use mod_python but this is not longer suggested and I am a bit lost. I used trac-admin /path/to/project deploy /path/to/project to generate my trac.wsgi. I then configured a new site in /etc/apache2/sites-available like this:</p>

<pre><code>WSGIScriptAliasMatch ^/trac/([^/]+) /data/trac/$1/cgi-bin/trac.wsgi
&lt;Directory /data/trac&gt;
    WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
    Options +Indexes +ExecCGI +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;LocationMatch /trac/[^/]+/login&gt;
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName ""Trac Authentication""
   AuthUserFile /data/access/htpassword
   Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and created a link in sites-enabled and restarted apache. I had removed all permissions for the trac modules (I originally had the project running on an old 0.11 version, I did the upgrade steps described on the Trac site) so I get a msg saying I need to login, but once I have entered my creds I get the error in the subject. </p>

<p>Does anyone know why?</p>

I do not understand how to roll back I read the documentation of Spring, but I still do not understand. Basically I'm going to persist an object in the db (with primary key manually) all the way here all right, the object is inserted into the db. But when you persist the object again with the same primary key I have caused an exception, and rightly so, a violation of restriction of uniqueness. In this case I would get a Transaction rollback and warn you that there was the problem and continue running the program</p>

<p>This is my class:</p>

<pre><code>public class ServiceDaoImpl{

    @PersistenceContext (unitName=""fb-persistence"")
    protected EntityManager em;

    public void setEntityManager(EntityManager entityManager) {
        this.em = entityManager;
    }

    @Transactional(readOnly=false)
    public void write(Service entity){
        try {
            em.persist(entity);
            em.flush();
        } catch(Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

<p>I have table showing of several Products with several attributes in form columns. In my index view I'm showing a shortened table, with just some of the columns. In my products#show I'm telling the full story, but obviously only for the selected Product. What I want to do, is letting users select a number of Products in products#index, and then store the selected IDs in a hash, sending them to another view, which I want the IDs to be presented in a full scale table, telling the whole story, of several products at once. Basically this is for comparing Products.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to tackle this. As I'm already using DataTables, using javascript would make sense, but I'm unsure on how. And ideas? I've tried several ideas, but none of them got me anywhere. Is this really that hard or am I having a huge brain fart?</p>

<p>Our app is listed under REST API apps (rather than Classic API apps). Is this ok if all we intend to do is take payment via Paypal account and direct/credit card? </p>

<p>The process of registering a REST API app is quite different to registering a CLASSIC API app. If we want to register as a CLASSIC API app then Paypal require legally recognised documents and an apk/ipa for testing. I imagine that will add significant time to our project as it will need to be reviewed manually (which we can't afford the time cost).</p>

<p>So are we safe to continue with the REST API app? We've implemented the latest Paypal mobile sdk's into the apps and have a fairly straightforward scenario (accept non-recurring Paypal and credit card payments).</p>

<p>For example, the global settings have mandated that ""*.obj"" files (intending files output by a build process) be excluded. Without changing those global settings, I cannot seem to include .obj files (these being 3d model files) in my project. Putting <code>file_exclude_patterns</code> in the ""settings"" section doesn't override, and adding a <code>file_include_patterns</code> key to the paths section simply filters every other file type out, and yet the .obj files <em>still</em> aren't included! (Apparently exclusion filters are applied after inclusion filters.)</p>

You can click on your contacts and initiate a chat with them.  I currently do not store the chat messages in a database because I simply just relay one message from one browser to another using signalR, doing some tag stripping etc.  If the user navigates to another page on the website, what is a good strategy of saving the user's open chats, and their chat history for those open chat windows?  Should I use a database for this anyway? or is there another way to just store it in session maybe, but i could see how that could take up a lot of memory on the server.</p>

<p>If you do suggest a database for this, would something like mongoDB or sql server be a better choice for something like this. </p>

<p>*Keep in mind the chat data is not that important to me, i would just like a little bit of a conversation to be saved for each chat the user opens up , so if he or she starts browsing the website, the chat bar can still pick up where it left off on ANY page and pick up the data from the chat.</p>

<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

<p>I was initially trying to make EF models along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person
{
    [Key]
    public Guid ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Guid PhoneID { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection&lt;Phone&gt; Phones { get; set; }
}

public class Org
{
    [Key]
    public Guid ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Guid PhoneID { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection&lt;Phone&gt; Phones { get; set; }
}

public class Phone
{
    [Key]
    public Guid ID { get; set; }
    public string Number { get; set; }
    public Guid EntityID { get; set; }


    [ForeignKey(""EntityID"")]
    public virtual User User { get; set; }
    [ForeignKey(""EntityID"")]
    public virtual Org Org { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I now (mostly) realize that this causes an issue with Foreign Key relationship integrity in SQL Server.  So to correct this, I altered the Phone class to:</p>

<pre><code>public class Phone
{
    [Key]
    public Guid ID { get; set; }
    public string Number { get; set; }
    public Guid? PersonID { get; set; }
    public Guid? OrgID { get; set; }


    [ForeignKey(""PersonID"")]
    public virtual User User { get; set; }
    [ForeignKey(""OrgID"")]
    public virtual Org Org { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question.</strong></p>

<p>How can I enforce / map a rule using modelbuilder / Fluent API to ensure a Phone object has either a PersonID or an OrgID?  </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  </p>

<p>I do realise that this is creating a data integrity rule that I would be unable to do if I was designing the database in SQL Server, but to me it seems that EF has the potential flexibility to take database design to the next level.</p>

<p>I see EF (Code-First especially) as Microsoft's next big leap in their software development strategy.  IMHO this is as big a leap as the introduction of .Net  (Now there is a statement that should generate some debate!), that being moving the database design away from the database itself &amp; integrating it in with the managed code.</p>

<p>Here is what I need:</p>

<p>Both language parameter in the url and a slug of the pages. So:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>for the frontend</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>the directory '/' should lead to the default language, <code>controller</code> => <code>pages</code> , <code>slug</code> => <code>home</code></p>
  
  <p>/:lang - the same as above but with selected language</p>
  
  <p>/:slug - <code>controller</code> => <code>pages</code> , <code>action</code> => <code>index</code> and to pass the <code>:slug</code> parameter, with default language</p>
  
  <p>/:lang/:slug - the same as above with set lang parameter</p>
  
  <p>/:controller/:slug - </p>
  
  <p>/:lang/:controller/:slug - the same as above with set lang parameter</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>I dont need any <code>action</code>-s in those links</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong><em>for the admin panel</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>/admin - 'controller' => 'settings', 'action' => 'index'</p>
  
  <p>/admin/:controller/:action/ .... this one is the default</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>no need for language parameter in the admin url, but actions exists, <strong>except the index action</strong></li>
  </ul>

<p>I have two stages:
A users administration stage (Controller: UsersAdminController.java)
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mlarl.png"" alt=""Users Administration Stage"">
with the following element hierarchy:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aIoSt.png"" alt=""Hierarchy of elements in the user administration stage"">
and a User addition stage: (Controller: AddUserController.java)
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2mcyY.png"" alt=""User Addition Stage""></p>

<p>As a child to the scroll pane of the upper anchor pane of the users admin stage (see elements hierarchy) I add during initialization of the UsersAdminController a GridPane intended to list the users of the system as described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26400650/javafx-best-way-to-update-gridpane-after-row-deletion"">here</a>
When I add a user through the user addition screen, I try to update the GridPane of the Users Administration stage by getting a reference to the UsersAdminController and then calling a method that updates its contents.
However, the GridPane CANNOT BE UPDATED. (I seem unable to perform any gui-related action to the scroll pane neither the gridpane although I manage to get a reference to the relevant controller.</p>

<p>Code:
Here is how the gridpane is (correctly) initialized through the initialize method of the UsersAdminController:</p>

<pre><code>public void initialize(URL location, ResourceBundle resources) {
    gridPaneNonSudoUsers = new GridPane();
    gridPaneNonSudoUsers.setId(""gridPaneNonSudoUsers"");
    // setting column widths for the grid pane
    gridPaneNonSudoUsers.getColumnConstraints().add(new ColumnConstraints(145));
    gridPaneNonSudoUsers.getColumnConstraints().add(new ColumnConstraints(85));
    gridPaneNonSudoUsers.getColumnConstraints().add(new ColumnConstraints(210));
    gridPaneNonSudoUsers.getColumnConstraints().add(new ColumnConstraints(150));

    srcPaneUsers.setContent(gridPaneNonSudoUsers);
    gridPaneNonSudoUsers.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);

    displayNonSudoUsers(getSystemNonSudoUsers());
}

<p>where uac is a reference to the UserAdministrationController.java and the adduser the method that tries to update the GridPane by CALLING AGAIN the displayNonSudoUsers().
I have also experimented by trying to do various stuff on the scroll pane / gridpane of the Users Admin Stage (e.g. deleting a label etc) but NADA!</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT: And this is the way I get the reference to the user admin controller (which is probably right because e.g. I manage to sysout some of its elements's ids etc.) in the initialize method of the AddUserController.java</p>

<pre><code>public void initialize(URL location, ResourceBundle resources) {
    // need to access UsersAdminController to update users list 
    // when adding user
    URL loc = getClass().getResource(""/resources/fxml/UsersAdminPane.fxml""); // the UsersAdmin fxml 
    FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader();
    fxmlLoader.setLocation(loc);
    fxmlLoader.setBuilderFactory(new JavaFXBuilderFactory());
    try {
        Parent root = (Parent) fxmlLoader.load(loc.openStream());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    uac = (UsersAdminController)fxmlLoader.getController();

<p>What the function does is read from the microphone then send that data over the network. But since any time the key is pressed and there is any data it sends it (this could be white noise etc). Is there a way I can just have it less glitchy I am not sure this is the right approach to this situation using a keypress I mean. </p>

"8745178","1","8765824","","2012-01-05 15:37:42","","3","1340","<p>I have a CUDA program that calls the kernel repeatedly within a for loop. The
code computes all rows of a matrix by using the values computed in the previous one
until the entire matrix is done. This is basically a dynamic programming algorithm.
The code below fills the (i,j) entry of many separate matrices in parallel with
the kernel.</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 1; i &lt;=xdim; i++){

  for(j = 1; j &lt;= ydim; j++){ 

    start3time = clock();
    assign5&lt;&lt;&lt;BLOCKS, THREADS&gt;&gt;&gt;(Z, i, j, x, y, z)
    end3time = clock(); 
    diff = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(end3time-start3time)/(CLOCKS_PER_SEC / 1000); 
    printf(""Time for i=%d j=%d is %f\n"", i, j, diff); 
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The kernel assign5 is straightforward </p>

<pre><code>__global__ void assign5(float* Z, int i, int j, int x, int y, int z) {

  int id = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;

  char ch = database[j + id];

  Z[i+id] = (Z[x+id] + Z[y+id] + Z[z+id])*dev_matrix[i][index[ch - 'A']];

  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that when I run this program the time for each i and j is 0 most of the
time but sometimes it is 10 milliseconds. So the output looks like</p>

<pre><code>Time for i=0 j=0 is 0
Time for i=0 j=1 is 0
.
.
Time for i=15 j=21 is 10
Time for i=15 j=22 is 0
.
</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand why this is happening. I don't see a thread race condition. If I add </p>

<pre><code>if(i % 20 == 0) cudaThreadSynchronize();
</code></pre>

<p>right after the first loop then the Time for i and j is mostly 0. But then the time 
for sync is sometimes 10 or even 20. It seems like CUDA is performing many operations
at low cost and then charges a lot for later ones. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>and in my web project all called are implements with RemoteClass thus</p>

<pre><code>   reservaEJB = ( ReservaEJBRemote ) ServiceLocator.getInstance().getEjb( ReservaEJBRemote.class );
</code></pre>

<p>in the init method in his bean, my boss say me than I should configure a .properties target to other machine in my services locator class, but I don't know how. any know how to.</p>

<p>thanks in advance.</p>
