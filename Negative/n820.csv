"13523869","1","","","2012-11-23 06:04:31","","1","541","<p>I am building a web project in Visual Studio that uses dojo, but I am unsure of how to link in the 3rd party dojo files so they get copied to the output directory.</p>

<p>In the past for things like jQuery, I placed the jquery.js file in a separate folder, went to ""Add Existing Item,"" added jquery.js as a link, and set Visual Studio to copy it to the output directory (if newer).  This worked great.</p>

<p>For dojo, there are hundreds (if not thousands) of related external files.  This is not practical to add to Visual Studio (<a href=""http://greenicicleblog.com/2010/12/01/link-whole-directories-into-visual-studio-projects/"" rel=""nofollow"">though I did find a way to do it in bulk</a>).</p>

<p>This makes me think that I am approaching this incorrectly.  How can or should I include something like dojo in a C# project without having to reference each file?  Should I use a post-build step to robocopy the files into the output directory?</p>

<p>My goal is to be able to build multiple projects which all use dojo, but I don't want to have multiple copies of dojo checked in, or have to reference each file in the project.</p>

We are handling all the incoming request from the client asynchronously.I did a preliminary test and sent around 2000 requests in a matter of 5 min (300 seconds) and the average response time (from making a request to getting the response back) I got is around 18 seconds. But this is not a true figure. Even though I'm handling all the incoming requests asynchronously but given the fact that 2000 requests in 300 seconds is a very high latency throughput. So I would assume that requests are queuing up before getting picked up by a CLR thread-pool threads for execution. </p>

<p>I read this article <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tmarq/archive/2007/07/21/asp-net-thread-usage-on-iis-7-0-and-6-0.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tmarq/archive/2007/07/21/asp-net-thread-usage-on-iis-7-0-and-6-0.aspx</a>  and got highly confused about among these terms MaxNumberofRequestsPerCUP vs MaxNumberofThreadsPerCPU vs Threads per Processor Limit. When I look into a w3wp.exe process in IIS and click on ASP and go to Limit Properties I come across <strong>Threads per Processor Limit</strong>. But this article is only talks about <strong>MaxNumberofRequestsPerCUP and MaxNumberofThreadsPerCPU</strong>. And its' been said in this article that MaxNumberofRequestPerCPU in version 4.0 is already 5000 but I'm only generating 2000 requests in 300 seconds which shouldn't be that much (as 5000 is not a restrictive figure at all) and number requests from my client are still 3000 less than default value (5000).Then why my requests are queuing up and what is the difference between  <strong>MaxNumberofThreadsPerCPU and Threads per Processor Limit</strong> (as IIS is giving later property value as 25). Shall I think that I'm running out of threads in thread-pool and until a worker thread is not released for the execution of next request that request sits in the queue? Since that is what I have been told when I discussed my results with senior team members. When the MaxRequestsPerCPU is 5000 by default how come I'm running out of threads in threadpool, I don't seem to understand.</p>

<p>Also i'm totally confused between these three terms MaxNumberofRequestsPerCUP vs MaxNumberofThreadsPerCPU vs Threads per Processor Limit, any answers which make me understand what is wrong with my test and these terms will be highly apprecaited.</p>

<p>the odd issue we're having is that in the default android emulator, you can enter your username and password into the login overlay then you get to the confirm authorization page. fine, but you can't click <code>OK</code> or <code>Cancel</code> in the dialog, so the login never completes. the only click-able element on the page is the little <code>(X)</code> in the upper corner, which cancels the login. the console displays no errors at any time through this.</p>

<p>why this is strange: if i compile the app directly to my droid, it works perfectly. i can get logged in, look at my profile, whatever. i do not have the facebook app on my droid, but i installed it on the emulator thinking it might change the functioning. it didn't, it still won't let me click either button.</p>

<p>i realize that this is not a show-stopper type of bug, but it makes debugging via the emulator extremely problematic - so i was wondering if anyone else had run across/resolved this.</p>

<p>I've created more projects using ReportViewer 2005 and 2008 in local processing mode than I can count on my hands. All Visual Studio 2005 or 2008 ASP.NET web forms projects. I always used some flavor of Object data source for the reports.</p>

<p>Tonight, I attempted to add the same functionality to a Visual Studio 2010 MVC 2 project and am failing miserably. First, the Add New Item > Reporting > Report is now a 2008 RDLC and not a 2005 RDLC report. Secondly, when trying to add a DataSet, my usual method of create a data proxy class with static methods that return <code>IEnumerables(Of Stuff)</code> will not show up as sources in the DataSources drop down</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0fLnN.png"" alt=""Empty Data Source""></p>

<p>Thirdly, my <em>only</em> option is to add a Database connection. There is no ""Object Data Source"" to pick from:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/7cptm.png"" alt=""Database connections only""></p>

<p>I'm stumped. Like I kind of alluded to, I have no problems whatsoever actually rendering a report using the ReportViewer control. What I can't do is figure out how set up a Data Source in these new-fangled 2008 reports with Visual Studio 2010 so that I can pump a list of domain objects into the ReportViewer and display the report.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>With some more research, I've found that MVC projects do not allow object data sources to be used within them. One solution for my issue is to create a separate project in the solution -- a web application, a service, or even just a class library, to add the report to and design it accordingly.</p>

<p>I'm still looking for alternatives here, so don't run away too fast!</p>

<p>And EntityManager configuration. I don't think thats the main problem here, but i will show it code:</p>

One of the functionalities is to generate the 2D-Power Spectrum from the 2D-FFT and place that in a second plot within one figure. What I would like to add is a button that takes the FFT image and pops it out into another window so it can be analyzed in greater detail. </p>

<p>My code currently is doing everything I need it to but it is also raising a QT exception or warning of some sort to the terminal (this is being run under OS X):</p>

<pre><code>def popout(event):
    nfig, nfftax = pylab.subplots(1, 1)

    fftimg = np.abs(fftpack.fftshift(fftpack.fft2(imgtoconv)))**2

<p>I have a button defined and linked to the popout() function via Button.on_clicked(popout)
In the main loop of the program a figure is initiated and shown with two plots. So pylab.show() has been called once already</p>

<p>The problem I am having seems to be that I am calling pylab.show() again which is generating an exception or warning that the event loop is already initiated. </p>

<p>I tried using pylab.draw() instead of pylab.show() but when I do that the button click doesn't show the new figure</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to suppress this warning? Or is there another way to spawn the new figure and make it visible without recalling pylab.show()?</p>

<p>EDIT: I also tried adding nfig.canvas.draw() after I create the new figure and new axes then calling pylab.draw() at the end of the popout() function. This still is not showing the new figure onclick</p>

<p>EDIT2: Switching to use the TKAgg Backend and recalling pylab.show() makes the problem go away. Any ideas as to why this is only an issue in the QT4Agg Backend?</p>

<p>I have been tasked with looking into software products that can be used to create an application that can be ported to work on different phones. </p>

<p>The application needs to connect to a database. It will need to allow users to choose from book lists and then download book information that can be read either online or offline. There's no fancy graphics requirements and we are currently just looking to find out what products there are on the market that could help us.</p>

<p>Note we have no experience so we'll not be doing development. We just want to do some research ourselves before calling in other companies to give us quotes for the work we need. </p>

<p>I'd very much appreciate if someone out there could point me to some products that I could look into. </p>

<p>Please don't close this topic and say the answers are subjective. Yes I know that but at the same time I really need to get some ideas as to where to look. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Unity has been suggested as a tool I should look into. Does anyone have any experience with that tool?</p>

<p>The issue occurs when the application is running in the background. The modal window properly appears above whatever application is running in the foreground, but when the user clicks the ""Save"" button, the rest of the application's windows also are made active.

<p>Simple examples are <code>%s</code> or <code>%1$d</code>.</p>

<p>Now I would like to write a RegEx that works in JavaScript and lets you extract Java's format strings from a given text.</p>

<p>My solution would be the following RegEx:</p>

<pre><code>%(([0-9]+\$)?)([,+ (\-#0]*)([0-9]*)(.[0-9]*)((hh|h|l|ll|L|z|j|t)*)(d|i|u|f|F|e|E|g|G|x|X|o|s|S|c|C|a|A|b|B|h|H|p|n|%)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this does not even work for the easiest case (<code>%s</code>). But it <em>seems</em> to work for all other (more complex) cases.</p>

<p>What I'm asking here is: Would you say this is a good (correct) RegEx or is anything missing?</p>

<p>My sources for the syntax have been: <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Formatter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Android's Formatter class</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#Format_placeholders"" rel=""nofollow"">printf format strings</a></p>

For each week I will need to create empty templates for all the restaurants displaying the week number and dates. </p>

<p>I was also hoping for third-party developers to access this data through RESTful methods in the URL where the structure could be something like: <a href=""http://domain.no/restaurant-name/menu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domain.no/restaurant-name/menu</a> for a text-menu <a href=""http://domain.no/restaurant-name/json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domain.no/restaurant-name/json</a> for json etc.</p>

<p>i have a android project using phone gap library and it looks like if i go a get it works:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {

            $.ajax({ 
                type: 'GET', 
                url: 'http://example.com/functions.php', 
                data: { get_param: 'login' },
                dataType:'json',
                success: function (data) { 
                    alert('success');
                     });
                }, 
                error: function () { 
                    console.log(XMLHttpRequest.errorThrown); 
                }

            });
        });
</code></pre>

<p>so, this works properly. But when i try to post tome data it doesn't:</p>

<pre><code>var vals = $(""#form"").serialize();

                    $.ajax({ 
                        type: 'POST', 
                        url: 'http://example.com/functions.php', 
                        data: vals,
                        dataType:'json',
                        success: function (data) {
                            alert('success');
                            $.mobile.changePage( ""test.html"", { transition: ""slideup""} );
                        }, 
                        error: function () { 
                            alert('fail');
                        }

                    });
</code></pre>

<p>with this previous example i get the <code>fail alert</code></p>

<p>i've also tried:</p>

<pre><code>   $.post(""http://example.com/functions.php"",  vals ,
        function(data){ //Your onsuccess call backfunction
            alert(data);  
        }, ""json"" //retun data type //can be html/json/xml/text
        );
        e.preventDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>but this fails also.</p>

<p>Any ideas on why the get works but not the post? Right now i have nothing returning from the php function but i should at least get the <code>success</code> alert.</p>

<p>lots of thanks</p>

<p>edit: the php code i have checks for the <code>vals</code> sent by the ajax. One of them is <code>name</code> </p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_POST['name'])) {
    return ""name"";
}

I'm trying to write an application which renders the result of an intensive computation. In the end it will run an optimization problem, and then, based on the result, render something to the screen. As a test case, I'm starting with the particle simulation example code from this course: <a href=""http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/sig13/"">http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/sig13/</a></p>

<p>The example code creates and OpenGL context, then creates a OpenCL context that shares the state, using the cl_khr_gl_sharing extension. Everything works fine when I use a single GPU. Creating a context looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>3. create an opencl context based on the opengl context:
  cl_context_properties props[ ] =
  {
      CL_GL_CONTEXT_KHR, (cl_context_properties) glXGetCurrentContext( ),
      CL_GLX_DISPLAY_KHR, (cl_context_properties) glXGetCurrentDisplay( ),
      CL_CONTEXT_PLATFORM, (cl_context_properties) Platform,
      0
  };

  cl_context Context = clCreateContext( props, 1, Device, NULL, NULL, &amp;status );
  if( status != CL_SUCCESS) 
  {
      PrintCLError( status, ""clCreateContext: "" );
      exit(1);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Later on, the example creates shared CL/GL buffers with clCreateFromGLBuffer.</p>

<p>Now, I would like to create a context from two GPU devices:</p>

<pre><code>cl_context Context = clCreateContext( props, 2, Device, NULL, NULL, &amp;status );
</code></pre>

<p>I've successfully opened the devices, and can query that they both support cl_khr_gl_sharing, and both work individually. However, when attempting to create the context as above, I get </p>

<pre><code>CL_INVALID_OPERATION 
</code></pre>

<p>Which is an error code added by the cl_khr_gl_sharing extension. In the extension description (linked above) it says</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>CL_INVALID_OPERATION if a context or share group object was
   specified for one of CGL, EGL, GLX, or WGL and any of the
   following conditions hold:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The OpenGL implementation does not support the window-system
  binding API for which a context or share group objects was
  specified.</li>
  <li>More than one of the attributes CL_CGL_SHAREGROUP_KHR,
  CL_EGL_DISPLAY_KHR, CL_GLX_DISPLAY_KHR, and CL_WGL_HDC_KHR is
  set to a non-default value.</li>
  <li>Both of the attributes CL_CGL_SHAREGROUP_KHR and
  CL_GL_CONTEXT_KHR are set to non-default values.</li>
  <li>Any of the devices specified in the  argument cannot
  support OpenCL objects which share the data store of an OpenGL
  object, as described in section 9.12.""</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>That description doesn't seem to fit any of my cases exactly. Is it not possible to do OpenCL/OpenGL interop with multiple GPUs? Or is it that I have heterogeneous hardware? I printed out a few parameters from my enumerated devices. I've just taken two random GPUs that I could get my hands on.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Note that if I create the context without the interop portion (such that the props array looks like below) then it successfully creates the context, but obviously cannot share buffers with the OpenGL side of the application.</p>

{
   CL_CONTEXT_PLATFORM, (cl_context_properties) Platform,

On receiving of media data I run a thread that does decoding and other manipulations, the abstract code looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>private void startConsuming(final InputStream input) {
    consumingThread = new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            runConsumingThread(input);
        }
    };
    consumingThread.start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>My idea is to calculate the buffer size needed to prevent interruption, and to start media playback once the buffer is filled (or, of cause, if the stream ends).</p>

<pre><code>private void startConsuming(final InputStream input) {
    consumingThread = new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            runConsumingThread(input);
        }
    };
    Thread fillBufferThread = new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            try {
                while(input.available() &lt; RECEIVING_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES) {
                    log.debug(""available bytes: "" + input.available());
                    sleep(20);

            consumingThread.start();
        }
    };
    fillBufferThread.start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In debug I get continuously ""available bytes: 0"" while stream arrives and does not break the while loop. I recognized already, that EOFException will of cause not occur, since I do not read from InputStream.<br>
How can I handle this? I thought that input.available() would increase on data arrival.<br>
Why can runConsumingThread(input) work correctly in nearly the same manner, but my while loop in fillBufferThread does not?<br>
<br>
<strong>EDIT:</strong> Following code nearly works (except that it wrongly consumes the input stream, which is then not played in consumingThread, but that will be easy to solve), but there must be a smarter solution.</p>

<pre><code>[...]
    Thread fillBufferThread = new Thread() {
        public void run() {

                int bufferSize = 0;
                byte[] localBuffer = new byte[RECEIVING_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES];
                while(bufferSize &lt; RECEIVING_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES) {
                    int len = dataInput.readInt();

<p>It can't be efficient to read from stream until I know, that I have it filled with a number of bytes, or is it?</p>

The only way I could get this to work was with the commented out code where I manually push the data into an array row by row.  Is this the only way?</p>

<p>The actually error received by binding to <code>.rows</code> is:  <code>Error: Duplicates in a repeater are not allowed. Repeater: item in items key: undefined:undefined</code></p>

<p>The service:</p>

<pre><code>// only portion of code shown
query: function (q) {
        var d = $q.defer();
        var db = this.getDb();

        db.transaction(function (t) {
            t.executeSql(q, [], function (tx, results) {
                d.resolve(results);
            }, function (err) {
                d.reject(err);
            });

        }, function (err) {
            d.reject(err);
        }
        );

        return d.promise;
     }
</code></pre>

<p>The controller is like this:</p>

<pre><code>  Sql.query('select * from DEMO').then(function (data) {
                console.log(data);
                //$scope.items = [];

                //for (i = 0, l = data.rows.length; i &lt; l; i++) {
                    //$scope.items.push(data.rows.item(i));
                //}

                $scope.items = data.rows;  // this errors out
                $scope.$safeApply();
            });
</code></pre>

<p>The repeater is just a simple:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>and all I want is when the link is clicked to show some kind of confirmation window like:</p>

<p><strong>Are you sure you want to delete this : Yes/No</strong></p>

<p>And if <code>No</code> is clicked I want to prevent the link from executing. I use <code>jquery-1.10.2.min.js</code> and
<code>jquery-ui-1.10.3.min.js</code> my HTML is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""dialog-confirm"" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=""/Delete"" class=""prompt-for-delete""&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried several options I found on the internet. The last one is:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {

        $('.prompt-for-delete').click(function (e) {
            $(""#dialog-confirm"").dialog({
                resizable: false,
                height: 140,
                modal: true,
                buttons: {
                    ""Delete all items"": function () {
                        $(this).dialog(""close"");
                    },
                    Cancel: function () {
                        $(this).dialog(""close"");
                    }
                }
            });
        });

    });
</code></pre>

<p>which is just to get something working but with this I get the dialog opened and automatically closed after a second. It seems like something very standard so could you provide an example of how to achieve this?</p>

<p>My C# app runs in the background and should return data that other pieces of my application (which includes a web app, a PLC, and a database) can store and use.</p>

<p>My responses look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[
 [
     string
     int
     []
 ]
 string
 []
 int
]
</code></pre>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>The point is that the return values are not simple.  My question is what is the best way to reformat and consume this data from other parts of my application?</p>

<p>My choices are:</p>

<ol>
<li>XML</li>
<li>JSON</li>
</ol>

<p>I've checked out both routes and have not found a great way to serialize this data.  Can anyone provide any recommendations?</p>

<p>Worst case scenario I may need to just create a common routine to build XML with StringBuilder, but I'm hoping there's something I don't know about yet (I'm new to C#) that will make my life easy.</p>

To allow these business method to be used from an Iqueryable :</p>

<ul>
<li>I defined UDF functions in SQL Server (with the needed parameters)</li>
<li>Add this UDF to the EDMX model of the application</li>
<li><p>And make a gateway between UDF and LinQ with a method like this in a
partial class who inherits from the dbcontext :</p>

   {

<p>This works perfectly for IQueryable.
But the problem is that, to use this method from a simple object (not linked to a database record), i need to make something creepy like this :</p>

<pre><code>var query = from foo in context.JustATable select context.GetTaxesOfProduct(15.55, 3);

<p>So say there is this table:</p>

<pre><code>===============================

price_id (PK)
product_id (FK)
label
operation (ENUM: add, subtract)
type (ENUM: amount, percentage)

<pre><code>====================================================================
price_id | product_id | label      |  operation | type       | value

 1       | 10         | Price      | add        | amount     | 20

Sales Tax:   $1.50 (10%)

<p>A few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there anything obviously wrong with the initial design?</li>
<li>What if I wanted to create ""templates"" (e.g. ""general merchandise"" template that has ""price"", ""discount"" and ""sales tax"" fields; a ""luxury merchandise"" that has ""price"", ""discount"", ""luxury tax"" fields) - how would I model that?</li>
<li>The above model works if each record applies to the total of the preceeding record. So, in the example, ""sales tax"" applies to the difference of ""price"" and ""discount"". What if total was not computed that simply? For example: A + B + (A + 10%) - (B - 5%). How would I model that?</li>
<li>Also, what if the ""percentage"" type doesn't apply to the immediately preceeding row (as implied by question #3) and applied to more than 1 row? Do I need another table to itemize which price->price_id the percentage applies to?</li>

<p>Here is my implementation.</p>

<p>1) I have created standard MVC 3 project with razor view engine. Menu in Layout page looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""menucontainer""&gt;
    &lt;ul id=""menu""&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(""Home"", ""Index"", ""Home"", null, new { title=""Index""})&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(""About"", ""About"", ""Home"", null, new { title=""About""})&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2) Here is my HomeController actions.</p>

<pre><code>public PartialViewResult Index()
{
    ViewBag.Message = ""Welcome to ASP.NET MVC!"";
    return PartialView();
}

public PartialViewResult About()
{
    return PartialView();
}

public ViewResult Default()
{
    return View();
}
</code></pre>

<p>3) Also I have changed Global.asax.cs to show Default page.</p>

<pre><code>public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
    routes.IgnoreRoute(""{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}"");

    routes.MapRoute(
        ""Default"", // Route name
        ""{controller}/{action}/{id}"", // URL with parameters
        new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Default"", id = UrlParameter.Optional } // Parameter defaults
    );

}
</code></pre>

<p>4) And finally here is my script to apply tabs behavior.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
$('#menucontainer').tabs();
$(""menucontainer"").bind('tabsselect',
    function(event, ui) {
        document.title = ui.tab.title;
    }
);});
</code></pre>

<p>So jQuery ui just adds additional divs for each tab to the page (2 in this case) and after that div#main appends. I want just replace content of div#main dynamically after user goes to other tab in menu bar. Now it looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""menucontainer""&gt;
    ...
    &lt;div id=""Index""&gt;
        Content of Index tab.
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=""About""&gt;
        Content of About tab.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""main""&gt;
    Content of the page.

"18631014","1","18631615","","2013-09-05 08:10:37","","2","1421","<p>I am trying to load information into a user defined function for further processing. Since the input files must be generated by non-programmers I have chosen the following format:</p>

<pre><code>#contents of vessel_data.txt
hull_length = 100000.
hull_width  = 50000.
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>My function then loads the input file via <code>execfile()</code>. I then want to group data into an array and pass that as the output of the function. Roughly like so:</p>

<pre><code>file_path = ..\vessel_name.txt

def my_input_func(file_path):
    execfile(file_path)

    data = np.array([[hull_length],
                     [hull_width ],
                     [etc.       ]])

    return(data)
</code></pre>

<p>I know that loading data via <code>exec()</code> and <code>execfile()</code> are frowned upon, but bear in mind that the input are generated by non-programmers. Anyways, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>NameError: global name 'hull_length' is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>After adding these lines, I can confirm that my variables are loaded into the <code>local</code> name space as expected:</p>

<pre><code>print 'Locals:  ' + str([x for x in locals()  if x[0] == 'h'])
print 'Globals: ' + str([x for x in globals() if x[0] == 'h'])
</code></pre>

<p>What puzzles me is why my function looks to the <code>global</code> name space when I try to define my variables. I were under the impression that unless specifically stated, everything inside a function dealt with the name space local to the function. I can make it work by modifying my <code>execfile()</code> command to:</p>

<pre><code>execfile(file_path, globals())
</code></pre>

<p>but I am not interested in loading everything into the global name space.</p>

<p>So, how do I make this work without loading everything into the <code>global</code> name space?</p>

<p>Kind regards,
Rasmus</p>

<p>======== Edit =======</p>

<p>This is how I made it work based on Quentin's answer:</p>

<pre><code>file_path = ..\vessel_name.txt

def my_input_func(file_path):
    vessel_vars = {}
    execfile(file_path, vessel_vars)

    data = np.array([[vessel_vars['hull_length']],
                     [vessel_vars['hull_width'] ],
                     [vessel_vars['etc.']       ]])

    return(data)
</code></pre>

There are 2 tables (tableA and tableB) which can be joined on 1 column (col1). I want to display the data of tableA for all the rows which col1 does not exist in tableB. </p>

<p>(So, in other words, tableB contains a subset of col1 of tableA. And I want to display tableA without the data that exists in tableB)</p>

<p>Let's say tableB has 100 rows while tableA is gigantic (more than 1M rows). I know 'Not in (not exists)' can be used but perhaps there are more efficient ways (less comp. time) to do it.? I don't maybe with outer joins?</p>

I am making a chat client based on TCP that will eventually use Swing as a GUI, but right now I'm just trying to get the thing working on a CLI. </p>

<p>I have marked in the code (ClientHandler) where the server seems to hang. I'm sure it's a problem of IO streams, but as to what exactly, I'm a bit stumped. </p>

<p>The program <em>should</em> add a client when the client enters his/her username (on the same port, or else the program blows up (I haven't gotten that far yet)), but the server thread hangs and doesn't actually add the client. </p>

<p>The input stream at the marked bit of code doesn't seem to work. At all. I'm still kinda new to the whole ObjectInputStream/OutputStream bit (okay, streams in general aren't my specialty).</p>

<p>I have a Swing window made in WindowBuilderPro3 that I will implement later, but again, I'm just trying to get the model working.</p>

<p>I have searched the many similar questions here --and they have helped-- but I am still stumped. If someone can point me in the right direction (even to an answered question that does a good job answering my question), I would be most grateful. Thank you all very much.</p>

<p>1) I have a data file which contains a bunch (~36,000) of objects' identification numbers, which looks like this: </p>

<pre><code># ID
85000213
85000234
85000246
85000247
85000249
85000250
...
</code></pre>

<p>2) I also have a directory of datafiles which contain data about each object with names like:</p>

<pre><code>datafileID85000213.csv
datafileID85000234.csv
datafileID85000246.csv
datafileID85000247.csv
datafileID85000249.csv
datafileID85000250.csv
...
</code></pre>

<p>I would actually like to check that all objects in my original ID datafile have an associated csv file containing its actual data. My first idea for doing this is to use the diff command in order to compare these lists, but in order to do that I need to make a single column data file from the ~36,000 csv filenames I have in order to compare to. One complication is that for most commands I have tried to use so far (mv, cp, ls), I get this:</p>

<pre><code>Argument list too long
</code></pre>

<p>Would anybody have a workaround (or a better idea) to this task?</p>

<p>For searching for the number in each filename string, there is one of two things I have found so far:
1) python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; idlist
['abcdefg0.dat', 'abcdefg1.dat', 'abcdefg2.dat', 'abcdefg3.dat', 'abcdefg4.dat', 'abcdefg5.dat', 'abcdefg6.dat', 'abcdefg7.dat', 'abcdefg8.dat', 'abcdefg9.dat']
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(len(idlist)):
...     numbers.append(re.search(r'\d+',idlist[i]).group())
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers
['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
</code></pre>

<p>2) bash: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3569754/unix-bash-extracting-number-from-string"">UNIX BASH: extracting number from string</a></p>

<p>Consider I have Master branch and branch-A</p>

<p>The branch-A is not just a local branch, but it is a remote branch as well.</p>

<p>Workflow:</p>

<pre><code>git co branch-A
git pull
Make some changes to branch-A
git add
git commit
git push
</code></pre>

<p>Now more changes happened to master</p>

<pre><code>git co master
git pull
git co branch-A
git rebase master
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have bunch of conflicts, git asks me to resolve the conflicts, add and apply git rebase --continue
I resolve the conflicts</p>

<pre><code>git add
git rebase --continue
</code></pre>

<p>Now I get message that your branch and origin/branch-A diverged and have 3 and 1 different commits respectively. Use git pull to merge remote branch into yours. Now I issue git pull from branch-A</p>

<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre>

<p>Now I get bunch of messages for Auto-merging and finally most of the files have conflict and I end up resolving all those conflicts which I resolved before issuing git rebase --continue again. After resolving all the conflicts, I issue,</p>

<pre><code>git add
git ci -m ""Fixing the conflicts""
git push
</code></pre>

<p>Now everything works good and all the conflicts are resolved. But for this, I ended up doing the conflict resolution two times, one before the git rebase --continue and other after doing git pull due to branch diversion.</p>

<p>So my question is, since branch-A is remote, is it even right in the first place to issue rebase or should I have just followed,</p>

<pre><code>git co master
git pull
git co branch-A
git merge master
&lt;resolve conflicts&gt;
git add
git commit
git push
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry for long post, but I felt, it would be much more clear to put what I exactly saw. Thanks a lot for going through my post and your responses are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I know that operators have to associate one way or the other, and I can see why in some cases one way would be preferable to the other, but I'm struggling to see the bigger picture. Are there some criteria that language designers use to decide what should be left-to-right and what should be right-to-left?

<p>Side Note:</p>

<p>I tried to figure out something from <code>phpinfo()</code>. I can see one discrepancy. The phpinfo is showing one of my old php directory path <code>F:\Softwares\Development\PHP\php-5.5.13-x64</code>. This path used to exist in my system PATH variable earlier. But I myself remove this location from System PATH variable. But it is still visible in phpinfo(). But if I print the PATH variable from command prompt or cygwin console, it shows the correct PATH variable.</p>

<p>Also ran <code>php app/check.php</code>. It shows everything OK except the APC, which is completely fine for me. But it also shows that <code>""PHP CLI can use a different php.ini file than the one used with your web server""</code>.</p>

But look at it with ANY Internet Explorer version... the rounded corners go away, everything looks bad. Specially the Google Webfonts.
I´ve installed the Drupal module ""Google Fonts"" so I can use Google fonts easier.
But I think that the problem has nothing to do with Drupal.</p>

<p>This is the code that should show the page title with the webfonts format:</p>

<pre><code>.logo-1 {font-family:delius; font-size:18pt; margin-top:-35px;}
.logo-2 {font-family:chewy; font-size:44pt; margin-top:-25px; color:#133793;}
.logo-3 {font-family:delius; font-size:19pt; margin-top:-26px; text-align:right;}
</code></pre>

<p>So those three linkes should define the way that the title shows up. IE won´t show the google font.</p>

<p>And here are some rounded borders, shadows and ribbons that won´t show up at all!</p>

<pre><code>border: 1px solid #6487DC;
*border-top: 1px solid #6487DC;
*border-bottom: 1px solid #6487DC;

-o-box-shadow:2px 2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
box-shadow:2px 2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
</code></pre>

<p>I´ve <a href=""http://jigsaw.w3.org"" rel=""nofollow"">checked out</a> that all that code should work in IE, maybe I´m forgetting something?
I would really appreciate some help or guidance about this.
THANKS!

  <p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer!
I´ve tried to understand the errors, specially the ones related to the webfonts.
The site that you´ve kindly told me <a href=""http://jigsaw.w3.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jigsaw.w3.org</a>, tells me that the code should say:</p>

<pre><code>@font-face {
font-family : ""'Abel'"";
font-style : normal;
font-weight : normal;
src : local('Abel'), local('Abel-Regular'), url('http://themes.googleusercontent.com/static/fonts/abel/v1/N59kklKPso9WzbZH9jwJSg.ttf') format('truetype');
}
</code></pre>

<p>But after changing that in my .css file it won´t work.
Many of the errors are belonging to Drupal modules that work just fine, and the ones related to webfonts, should get fixed with those lines added to the file.</p>

<p>But it won´t work...</p>

<p>I found the following (very helpful) stack overflow question and followed the instructions provided in the answer (substituting my own main class and target version): <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1814526/problem-building-executable-jar-with-maven"">Problem building executable jar with maven</a></p>

<p>This worked wonderfully, but I end up with two jar files (ldap-daemon-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar and ldap-daemon-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar). I'd be ok with this, but as far as I can tell I can't actually get a copy of the jar with dependencies later using the maven-dependency-plugin's copy functionality.</p>

<p>So, what I want to know is how to accomplish one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have my main build artifact, ldap-daemon-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar, contain its dependencies</li>
<li>Use the maven-dependency-plugin to copy the second build artifact (ldap-daemon-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is my plugin configuration for the ldap-daemon (packaging configuration is ""jar""):</p>

<p>I am trying to redirect anything other than <code>www.domain.com</code> (e.g. <code>www.domain.net</code>, <code>www.domain.info</code>) to <code>www.domain.com</code>. With the exception of <code>www.domain.de</code> to redirecto to <code>www.domain.com/de</code>.</p>

<p>I have the following rules:</p>

<pre><code>server {
   server_name domain.de www.domain.de;
   rewrite ^(.*) http://www.domain.com/de$1 permanent;
}

server {

}

server {

<p>However, it seems like with this ruleset, it will always redirect <em>all</em> non <code>.com</code> domains to <code>www.domain.com/de</code>. Whereas if I flip the first two <code>server</code> segments it works fine.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong? Why is the order of the rules important if the server names are explicitly specified?</p>

<p>This will be my first windows service and I am not really familiar with threading, which is what I am assuming will be the recommendations here (but am eager to learn!).</p>

<p>The service will have the following functionality on a high level:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor a folder for new files (planning to use FileSystemWatcher).</li>
<li>Upon detection of a file, it is queued for upload to an external host.</li>
<li>If there are files in the queue, serially HTTP POST those files to the external host.
<ul>
<li>The files have to be POST'ed one at a time (serially) and must be transferred using HTTP POST.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Upon successful HTTP POST, it will delete the local file and, if necessary, move to the next file in the upload queue and repeat the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue I can foresee even at this high level, is that the HTTP POST of the file to the external host could take a really long time.  </p>

<p>What design options are available to best handle this long running aspect of the windows service?  Should I be even looking at using a windows service at all as an implementation for this solution?  Should I be looking into a standalone app instead?</p>

Everything works perfect locally, even in production mode. </p>

<p>On my Linode, however, the conversions are raising exceptions, even though the alchemist gem works perfectly in the production rails console. </p>

<p>Is there an extra require step or configuration necessary to use these ruby gems within my rails app? Do I need to call <code>require 'alchemist'</code> in an initializer? How do pure ruby gems fit into Rails, and how are they configured?</p>

<p>Here is the line in my Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'alchemist'

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I created <code>config/initializers/alchemist.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>require 'alchemist'

<p>This didn't cause any problems locally in development. Everything still worked. But then I get the folling error in production:</p>

When the user leaves the textbox, I want to check if the user actually entered anything, and put the username display back up otherwise.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>I viewed a way of avoiding some using class don't support serializable. But I don't know the reason of using this method. So I posed the question here.</p>

<p>So the previous code likes following</p>

<pre><code>    [Serializable]
    Class OutterClass
    {
        public UsingClass UsingClassMember
        {
            get;
            set;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So here, if I want to serialize the OutterClass, it will occur a exception because the UsingClass don't support serializing. Obviously, all the members in the OutterClass should support serializing if I want to serialize the OutterClass.</p>

<p>But if I modify the code as following. The serialize operation can be done successfully.</p>

<pre><code>    [Serializable]
    Class OutterClass
    {
        [NonSerialized]
        private UsingClass m_UsingClassMember;
        public UsingClass UsingClassMember
        {
            get { return m_UsingClassMember; };
            set { m_UsingClassMember = value };
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know the reason of this modification. It seems that property UsingClassMember's serialization don't need to serialize the class UsingClass itself. Can anyone give me a explanation?</p>

<p>For Example - Currently, I have the following in my routes:</p>

<pre><code>resources :school_types do
        resources :schools
      end

<p>So, if a user accesses <code>/api/v1/school_types/1/schools.json</code> an entire listing of schools will come back based on the <code>school_type_id</code></p>

<p>Well, I am now wanting to take it a little further and do the following:
<code>/api/v1/school_types/1/schools.json?param_1=foo&amp;param_2=bar</code></p>

<p>So when I construct the <code>ActiveRecord</code> call it would dynamically generate the SQL query based on the parameters passed in.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>conditions = """"
      params.except(:controller, :format, :action).each_with_index do |value, index|
        conditions &lt;&lt; ""#{params[index]} = #{value} AND ""

<p>This is the conditions variable output: <code>"" = [\""state_id\"", \""1\""] AND  = [\""district_id\"", \""1\""] AND  = [\""school_type_id\"", \""1\""] AND ""</code></p>

<p>I had thought to add an onclick event handler which increases the z-index of the InfoWindow, but the event handler does not appear to be firing. 
ZIndex is a global variable that keeps increasing as InfoWindows are clicked - or thats the theory anyway.</p>

Here is my code:-</p>

<pre><code>var ZIndex=1;

<p>Just to overview - any table I pull into the application I am developing using the first DSN are read/write-able, records can be created, removed, and updated without any problem.  With the second DSN, any table I pull into the application can be written to ONCE.  Any further changes are lost, and a Write Conflict dialog box appears whenever data is updated in the table in datasheet view.</p>

<p>Software I am using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Access 2003 </li>
<li>SQL Server Express 2008</li>
<li>Windows XP Professional SP3</li>
</ul>

<p>-- Edited 06/03/2009 @ 1307 hours --</p>

<p>I found out that a strange problem that crops up when using Yes/No checkboxes and SQL Server with Access.  Apparently, Access will interpret NULL as No - changing the value, but SQL Server will not interpret NULL as a No in a Bit field (what Yes/No gets turned into in conversion) so it throws a Write Conflict error when a value is not required, and is NULL.  The solution was to redesign the table so that a value was required, and that there was a default value assigned for EVERY former Yes/No checkbox.  This solved the mysterious Write Conflict messages, and allowed changes to records once they were created.</p>

<p>Completed these features now:</p>

<p>I have the following tables in my database:<br />
<strong>User(s)</strong> (has one profile, has many PhotoAlbums) <br />
<strong>Profile(s)</strong> (belongs to user) contains photo_id <br />
<strong>PhotoAlbum(s)</strong> (belongs to user, has many photos) contains photo_id <br />
<strong>Photo(s)</strong> (belongs to PhotoAlbum)<br /></p>

<p>Displaying the users default photo is straight forward.
I'm having trouble displaying the users default album photo now.</p>

<p>This is how I display users default profile photo:</p>

<p>UsersController:</p>

<pre><code>default_profile_photo_id = current_user.profile.photo_id
 @default_photo = Photo.find(default_profile_photo_id) 
</code></pre>

<p>Users view show template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= link_to image_tag(@default_photo.image, :width =&gt;""200""), @user.username %&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Currently for photoalbums default photos I show the first photo inside that photo album:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;% for photo_album in @photoalbums %&gt;
   &lt;%= link_to photo_album.album_title, photo_album %&gt;    
   &lt;%= link_to image_tag(photo_album.photos.first.image, :width =&gt;""100""), photo_album %&gt;
   &lt;%= link_to ""Edit Album"", edit_photo_album_path(photo_album) %&gt; 
   &lt;%= photo_album.photos.size %&gt;
   &lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Associated controller action:</p>

<pre><code>  def index
    @photoalbums = PhotoAlbum.find_all_by_user_id(current_user.id)
  end
</code></pre>

<p>What I need to do is during the for loop, pull the row from the photos table that has an id that matches the photo_id of the photoalbum that the loop is currently looping so that on my index template I can pull the image from the matching photo row and display it.</p>

<p>I've tried endless solutions but none work..</p>

<p>I feel I need a helping hand from an experienced programmer.</p>

Basically what I am trying to do is to call up a stored procedure that inserts some data, and gives back the id of the auto_increment that was just inserted. Then that statement is closed and I keep the id. </p>

<p>Then the fun part happens. I go into a loop and for each instance of the loop I need to call another stored procedure that inserts some data, and returns the id of the last auto_increment. Using that id I will then go and do some more things. However, right now it is failing in the loop. It executes the first time without a problem, and then on the prepare for the next go around it gives me the error <code>Commands out of sync; you can't run this command now</code>. </p>

<p>I really have tried to somehow free up the results from the first time around using stmt->free(), but that didn't work, or to free up the mysqli2 connection, but nothing I've done has worked at this point. Any tips or hints would be really appreciated!</p>

<p>The worker role acts as a TCP server listening on port a port which is configured in the service definition file.</p>

<p>So after the role instance is running, my tcp client program is able to connect to the work role.</p>

<p>But, every time when I reboot the role instance, or publish a new version within the visual studio,  i wait the reboot or publish finish, the azure portal says it's status is running,  the tcp client program is still not able to connect the server,  BUT, without doing nothing, about 10 mins later, it fixed itself, the tcp client is able to connect again.</p>

<p>Where does this 10 min delay come from?</p>

<p>I thought as soon as the role instance's status becomes Running, it should work again.</p>

<p>First, I thought it is because of the Load balancer. But, I remote in the that role instance, and use command line netstat -A ,  the port is not even listening.  So, seems my code for the worker role is not running?  </p>

<p>When 10 min later, it is good for connect, I went to remote desktop, and use netstat -A again, now that port is listening.</p>

<p>So, after the reboot/publish,  I have to wait for 10 mins to have my worker role code running?</p>

<p>Or I am missing something here?</p>

Now, what I want is first to generate the per hour wage for the worker.
By dividing salary by 31 and then dividing the result by 9, as 9 hour is the normal working day of the office. 
By doing this, I have in hand the per hour rate of the worker. 
Now, what I want is to multiply each row (OT is the name of the column) of *tbl_attendence* with the per hour rate of the worker and store it in another column named *overtime_rate*. what I have done so far is :</p>

<p>Last year I took intro to Visual Basic and had infinite loops, this year I'm taking Java and can't get the loop to repeat. 
The getHours method is structured almost identical to the getHome method just with different variables and wording in the prompt. 
The program is supposed to display the error message when a number that is not 1, 2 or 3 is entered and then loop to ask you for the number again. It displays the error message but then goes on to ask for the hours. 
Again I very much appreciate any help that can be offered. This assignment isn't due until Saturday but I only have 2 days off to work on this. 
Thank you in advance for your help :)</p>

<p><code>@Resources.Title</code></p>

<p>It successfully looks up the string with the key title in the resource file respective to the active culture on your browser.</p>

<p>Now what I am trying to do is change the page size by choosing a value from drop down</p>

<pre><code> Page Sige :
           @{
             IList&lt;SelectListItem&gt; pageSizeList = new List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;();
             pageSizeList.Add(new SelectListItem { Text = ""5"", Value = ""5"", Selected = true });
             pageSizeList.Add(new SelectListItem { Text = ""10"", Value = ""10"" });
             pageSizeList.Add(new SelectListItem { Text = ""15"", Value = ""15"" });
             pageSizeList.Add(new SelectListItem { Text = ""20"", Value = ""20"" });
             pageSizeList.Add(new SelectListItem { Text = ""25"", Value = ""25"" });
             }

             })

<p>After choosing the value from dropdown I made few changes to my sorting and paging action links. I added a bool parameter isPageSort, as follows</p>

<pre><code>@Html.ActionLink(""  Previous Page  "", ""AdminSearchResult"", new { page = Model.PageNumber - 1, sortOrder = ViewBag.CurrentSort, currentFilter = ViewBag.CurrentFilter, isSortPage = ""true""  }) -------For paging

@Html.ActionLink(""Last Name"", ""AdminSearchResult"", new { sortOrder = ViewBag.LastNameSortParm, currentFilter = ViewBag.CurrentFilter, isSortPage = ""true"" }) ------For sorting
</code></pre>

<p>based on this bool parameter I save the current page size in session and retrieve to maintain the page size in my controller.</p>

<pre><code>[HttpGet]
    public ActionResult AdminSearchResult(string sortOrder, int? page, int pageSizeInput = 0,  bool isSortPage = false)
    {
        int pageSize = 5;         
        int pageNumber = 1;
        if (page != null)
            pageNumber = Convert.ToInt32(page);


        if (!isSortPage)
        {
            if (pageSizeInput != 0)
                pageSize = pageSizeInput;
            Session[""pageSize""] = pageSize;
        }
        else
            pageSize = (int)Session[""pageSize""];

        Session[""sortOrder""] = sortOrder;
        Session[""pageNumber""] = pageNumber;

        var userList = SortResult(sortOrder);

        return View(userList.ToPagedList(pageNumber, pageSize));

<p>The popup dialog is temporarily shown (for approx one second), before it disappears, it appears to be scrolling from bottom to up (I had to do this a few times, since it happens so quickly). The dialog appears to scroll from bottom to up, the last thing I see is the dialog box header with the title, and then it disappears, and the page remains darkened - until I click on the screen.</p>

<p><strong>[[Edit]]</strong></p>

<p>After further investigation using Firebug, I have narrowed down the problem to be something to do with javascript. I notice that the #display# style attribute applied to the element is (very briefly), set to <code>block</code>, and then very quickly (for some unknown reason), the #display# attribute is set to <strong>none</strong> - this then causes the dialog to disappear.</p>

<p>I manually set the <strong>display</strong> attribute to <code>block</code> in the firebug console, and the popup dialog appeared, and behaved as normal. So the question is this: <strong>what is causing the display attribute to be reset to 'none' after about 1 second</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>[[Edit 2]]</strong></p>

<p>When i replace the <code>file_get_content()</code> function call with simple text like 'hello world' and 'hello 2' for the two popups, they work as expected (i.e. correctly). So it is definitely something to do with the HTML text being returned in the <code>get_file_content()</code> function.</p>

<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

<p>In my Linux driver code i have thought of using threads for each of the ports i.e altogether 4x3=12 ports.Do you think giving a dedicated thread to each of the ports is a good idea,I may use one particular channel to implement a null modem,other channel RS422 some other channel RS485 and so on</p>

<p>The reason I thought for thread programming is that all the threads are to operate independently, and each thread - inturn each port may be active or not in use.So I aim to make them independent of each other as much as possible.</p>

For example, if I specified 'C:\MyTextFile.txt' in Windows 7, I would get all of the 256x256, 48x48, 32x32, and 16x16 representations for the .txt file in an .ICO file, which is located in imageres.dll at offset 102:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yQokM.png"" alt=""Text file icon in imageres.dll""></p>

<p>^ The Icon tab installed by Stardock IconPackager, which locates the icon for the file system object</p>

<p>From my research so far, it doesn't appear to be that easy.  There's the <code>ExtractIconEx</code> function, but it only gives the 16 and 32px representations.  There's also <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1703186/can-48x48-or-64x64-icons-be-obtained-from-the-vista-shell"">this post</a> that shows how to get the <code>SHIL_SMALL</code>, <code>SHIL_LARGE</code>, <code>SHIL_EXTRALARGE</code>, and <code>SHIL_JUMBO</code> sizes, which are generally 16, 32, 48, and 256 pixels respectively.  However, that doesn't necessarily cover other sizes that would be stored in the .ICO file as well.  For example, some icons store 10 or more different sizes rather than just four.</p>

<p>So, I'm trying to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the location of the file system object's icon, and</li>
<li>Retrieve it from the DLL, EXE, or whatever resource that encapsulates it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess one question would be: Is this a task for the Windows registry?  As you can see below, the registry's txtfile->DefaultIcon value contains the location of the icon for the .txt file type.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/48uFh.png"" alt=""txtfile in Windows registry""></p>

<p>But, there are also standalone .exe files, for example, that self-contain an icon that wouldn't be stored in the registry.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'd like to display all of the different sizes within a TImage and potentially output them together in an .ICO file.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

"27217529","1","","","2014-11-30 19:55:16","","3","51","<p>I've always understood MVC to mean the Model shouldn't know anything about the View and vice versa. However in my university course an example of a View using the MVC pattern is given like:</p>

<pre><code>class View implements Updatable {

    private final JButton button = new JButton(""Press Me!"");
    private final JTextField textField = new JTextField(10);

    //some setup of the button and textfield

    public void update(Model model) {
        if (model.morePressesAllowed()) {
            textField.setText(String.valueOf(model.count()));
        } else {
            textField.setText(""Too Many!"");
            button.setEnabled(false);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems odd to me that the view must know what methods the model has. It seems like it would be better in terms of the MVC pattern to expose the button and textfield to the controller, and have the update method on the controller?</p>

<p>The model just increments a number and if it gets to 5 then the morePressesAllowed returns false.</p>

<p>Also the model has a list of Updatable, and when the counter changes it loops through the updatables  and calls update, while this is better than having a list Views, it still seems like the Controller should be responsible for telling the view when the model changes?</p>

<p>EDIT: The model is:</p>

<pre><code>class Model {
    private final List&lt;Updatable&gt; views = new ArrayList&lt;Updatable&gt;();
    private int count;
    private boolean morePressesAllowed = true;
    public void addObserver(Updatable observer) {
        views.add(observer);
    }
    public void increment() {
        count++;
        if (count &gt;= 5) {
            morePressesAllowed = false;
        }
        notifyObservers();
    }
    private void notifyObservers() {
        for (Updatable view : views) {
            view.update(this);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Controller/Main class: (also shouldn't the controller create the model and view and be normal public class?)</p>

<pre><code>public class GuiApp {
    private View view = new View(new Controller());
    private Model pressCounter = new Model();

    class Controller implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent actionEvent) {
            pressCounter.increment();
        }
    }
    GuiApp() {
        pressCounter.addObserver(view);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also I actually prefer this to something like this: <a href=""http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/mvc_pattern.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/mvc_pattern.htm</a> Because in that the controller is just wrapping a bunch of methods of the view and model, which while it seems more MVC like in that the Model and View don't know anything about each other, it just seems less efficient and more complex?</p>

<p>This line I showed above has many details I want to parse/count/recognize:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the line has Gigabit increase counter by 1, it it is a TenGig, increase another counter</p></li>
<li><p>If the line has a dot(.) then also increase counter number 2.</p></li>
<li><p>If the line has a a dot(.) and a <code>l2transport</code> in the end, then also increase counter number 3.</p></li>
<li><p>If the line has a dot(.) and no <code>l2transport</code> in the end, then increase counter number 4.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What would be a good way to do the above without using CPU expensive Regex?</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult(string typeOfPage)

<pre><code>enum State { Alive, Dead, Unused };
template&lt;class T&gt; struct Atom
{
    T impl;
    int index, counter;
    State state;
};
</code></pre>

<p>I want <code>impl</code> not to be on the heap, as I will store <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;</code> instances contiguously in the manager.</p>

<p><code>AtomManager&lt;T&gt;</code> stores atoms in an <code>std::vector&lt;Atom&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>| A | A | A | A | A | A | U | U | U | U |
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>A</code> means alive, and <code>U</code> means unused. When the user calls <code>AtomManager&lt;T&gt;::refresh()</code>, all atoms with <code>state</code> equal to <code>State::Dead</code> will be moved at the end of the storage, and then they will be set to <code>State::Unused</code>. Example:</p>

<pre><code>| A | A | A | A | A | A | U | U | U | U |

// some atoms die

| A | D | A | D | A | A | U | U | U | U |

// user calls refresh()

| A | A | A | A | U | U | U | U | D | D |

// after refresh()

| A | A | A | A | U | U | U | U | U | U |
</code></pre>

<p>To create atoms, I have a function that matches the <code>T</code> constructor signature thanks to variadic templates and constructs a <code>T</code> in the first unused atom starting from the beginning of the storage.</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>T</code> has to be <strong>default-constructible</strong> (because I call <code>resize()</code> on the <code>std::vector</code>). But that's something I don't require, as I only care about <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;::impl</code> when the state is either <code>State::Alive</code> or <code>State::Dead</code>. And if the atom is alive or dead, it means that the user previously constructed it using the previously mentioned variadic function.</p>

<p>I do, however, care about <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;::index</code> and <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;::counter</code> when the atom is unused (and <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;::impl</code> is garbage).</p>

<p><strong>I do not care about the state of <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;::impl</code> when the atom is unused.</strong> </p>

<p>The compiler, however, does. I cannot use <code>AtomManager&lt;T&gt;</code> when <code>T</code> is not default-constructible.</p>

<p>I tried using an union inside <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>union { T impl; char dummy; };
</code></pre>

<p>...but I couldn't get it to work properly.</p>

<p><strong>How can I store a <code>T</code> non-constructed uninitialized instance inside <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;</code>?</strong></p>

<p>I do not care about its state. I'm sure I will construct it properly before accessing it. But when the atom is unused, I want it to be in an undefined state.</p>

<p><strong>What's the best way of achieving this?</strong> I don't want <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;::impl</code> to be stored on the heap.</p>

<p>I don't want to introduce additional dependencies. I don't need to query the state of <code>Atom&lt;T&gt;::impl</code> as I <strong>know</strong> when it's safe to access it.</p>

RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/apps/%1/webroot%{REQUEST_URI}  -d [OR]

<p>basically, if someone visits <code>foo.com</code> on any sub-domain, I want them to be served files directly from that folder but also have any requests that aren't for specific files sent to my <code>index.php</code> file for processing (which will do the routing)</p>

<p>The reason I am asking is because what I have written above does not actually work, so is there a way to do it? (also if this SHOULD work then it'll obviously be a problem with the rest of my <code>.htaccess</code> file, but it all works when dealing with just one application folder)</p>

<p>The other (messy IMO) way would be to route everything to the folders and have a second <code>.htaccess</code> file for each domain, but I'd rather not do this if it can be done in one file!</p>

<p>A League will host many Matches. Usually each League will use its own local database, so the LeagueID field will be the same in all records for this local database.

<p>At server side, the original piece of code was inside a static block. However <strong>parser.nextText</strong> was giving compile error. I downloded latest XMLPullParser jar and replace the call with <strong>parser.getText</strong>. Could this be the possible cause?</p>

<p>Original server code - </p>

<pre><code>static {

    ProviderManager.addExtensionProvider(GCM_ELEMENT_NAME, GCM_NAMESPACE,
        new PacketExtensionProvider() {
            @Override
            public PacketExtension parseExtension(XmlPullParser parser) throws
                    Exception {
                String json = parser.nextText();
                return new GcmPacketExtension(json);
            }
        });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please help me. I am not able to proceed as I am stuck at very basic level.</p>

Can someone explain when to use each of these parts?  </p>

<ul>
<li>Cache Templates
<ul>
<li><code>cache_freelist</code> - The <code>cache_freelist</code> template class maintains a free list of memory blocks of size <code>Sz</code>. When the free list is full it uses <code>operator delete</code> to deallocate memory blocks. When the free list is empty it uses <code>operator new</code> to allocate new memory blocks. The maximum size of the free list is determined by the class <code>max class</code> passed in the <code>Max</code> parameter.  Each memory block holds <code>Sz</code> bytes of usable memory and the data that <code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code> require.</li>
<li><code>cache_suballoc</code> - The <code>cache_suballoc</code> template class stores deallocated memory blocks in a free list with unbounded length, using <code>freelist&lt;sizeof(Type), max_unbounded&gt;</code>, and suballocates memory blocks from a larger chunk allocated with <code>operator new</code> when the free list is empty.  Each chunk holds <code>Sz * Nelts</code> bytes of usable memory and the data that <code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code> require. Allocated chunks are never freed.</li>
<li><code>cache_chunklist</code> - This template class uses <code>operator new</code> to allocate chunks of raw memory, suballocating blocks to allocate storage for a memory block when needed; it stores deallocated memory blocks in a separate free list for each chunk, and uses <code>operator delete</code> to deallocate a chunk when none of its memory blocks is in use. Each memory block holds <code>Sz</code> bytes of usable memory and a pointer to the chunk that it belongs to. Each chunk holds <code>Nelts</code> memory blocks, three pointers, an int and the data that <code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code> require.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I've written several allocators myself, but this documentation is just... confusing.</p>

The users will then fill up the blanks and click to check their answer. When they do that an <strong>alert box</strong> will show. Problem is, it's not showing..</p>

<p>In my database tables I have: </p>

<p>&lt;&lt; id|part1|answer1|part2|answer2|part3|answer3|part4|difflevel >></p>

<p>First off, I selected the database table that I will be using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
                $res = mysql_query(""select * from questions where difflevel='Advanced' ORDER BY RAND()"" ) or die(mysql_error());

            while($result=mysql_fetch_array($res)){

            ?&gt;

<p>Then I will display the question:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php if($i==1){?&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>My main problem is that the alert box doesn't show.
Everything seems to be okay, I just want the alert box to show that if the answer is wrong, it will say it's wrong and if it's right it will say it's right but also showing the correct answer. Can anyone help me? </p>

For the first time in my life I'm using functional programming for that goal, as a language I chose Haskell. However, I'm tainted with OOP and imperative thinking and scared of unconsciously applying this mindset to my Haskell program.</p>

<p>Somewhere in my game, I need to have information about elapsed time (Timer) and pressed/down keys (Keyboard). The approach used in SDL lessons translated to Haskell looks like that:</p>

<p>Main.hs</p>

<pre><code>data AppData = AppData {
    fps :: Timer 
    --some other fields    
}

getFPS :: MonadState AppData m =&gt; m Timer
getFPS = liftM fps get

putFPS :: MonadState AppData m =&gt; Timer -&gt; m ()
putFPS t = modify $ \s -&gt; s { fps = t }

modifyFPSM :: MonadState AppData m =&gt; (Timer -&gt; m Timer) -&gt; m ()
modifyFPSM act = getFPS &gt;&gt;= act &gt;&gt;= putFPS
</code></pre>

<p>Timer.hs</p>

<pre><code>data Timer = Timer { 
    startTicks :: Word32,
    pausedTicks :: Word32,
    paused :: Bool,
    started :: Bool
}

start :: Timer -&gt; IO Timer
start timer = SdlTime.getTicks &gt;&gt;= \ticks -&gt; return $ timer { startTicks=ticks, started=True,paused=False }

isStarted :: Timer -&gt; Bool
isStarted Timer { started=s } = s
</code></pre>

<p>And then used like that: <code>modifyFPSM $ liftIO . start</code>. That makes Timer somewhat pure (it is not explicitly a monad, and its functions return IO only because it's required to measure time). However, that litters the code outside Timer module with getters and setters.</p>

<p>My approach used in Keyboard.hs is:</p>

<pre><code>data KeyboardState = KeyboardState {
    keysDown :: Set SDLKey, -- keys currently down
    keysPressed :: Set SDLKey -- keys pressed since last reset 
};

reset :: MonadState KeyboardState m =&gt; m ()
reset = get &gt;&gt;= \ks -&gt; put ks{keysPressed = Data.Set.empty} 

keyPressed :: MonadState KeyboardState m =&gt; SDLKey -&gt; m ()
keyPressed key = do
     ks &lt;- get 
     let newKeysPressed = Data.Set.insert key $ keysPressed ks
     let newKeysDown = Data.Set.insert key $ keysDown ks
     put ks{keysPressed = newKeysPressed, keysDown = newKeysDown}

keyReleased :: MonadState KeyboardState m =&gt; SDLKey -&gt; m ()
keyReleased key = do
     ks &lt;- get 
     let newKeysDown = Data.Set.delete key $ keysDown ks
     put ks{keysDown = newKeysDown}
</code></pre>

<p>That makes the module self-contained, but I'm afraid that this is my way to express object from OOP in Haskell and ruins the whole point of FP. So my question is:</p>

<p>What is the proper way to do that? Or what are the other possibilities to approach such situation? And if you notice any other flaws (be it design or style problems) feel free to point that out. </p>

<p>I have a doubt in understanding the minimax algorithm.</p>

<p>I am trying to create just ONE AI opponent but the explanations found on web says that I need to write code for both players(Minimum player and Maximum player) as I understand from the pseudo code below.</p>

<pre><code>MinMax (GamePosition game) {
  return MaxMove (game);
}

MaxMove (GamePosition game) {
  if (GameEnded(game)) {
    return EvalGameState(game);
  }
  else {
    best_move &lt; - {};
    moves &lt;- GenerateMoves(game);
    ForEach moves {
       move &lt;- MinMove(ApplyMove(game));
       if (Value(move) &gt; Value(best_move)) {
          best_move &lt; - move;
       }
    }
    return best_move;
  }
}

MinMove (GamePosition game) {
  best_move &lt;- {};
  moves &lt;- GenerateMoves(game);
  ForEach moves {
     move &lt;- MaxMove(ApplyMove(game));
     if (Value(move) &gt; Value(best_move)) {
        best_move &lt; - move;
     }
  }

  return best_move;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can further understand that Maximum player will be the AI I am going to develop and the minimum player is the opponent.</p>

<p>My question is why I have to write code for both Minimum and Maximum player to return the best move ?</p>

<p>The pseudo code given below is based on C#.</p>

<pre><code>allc

<p>As <code>prod1</code> and <code>prod2</code> have <code>0</code> values</p>

<p>So <code>sum(a+b+c) = 1</code></p>

But now I need a (static) Coupon table with a dozen or so records of config data to be available to my app when running my integration tests (rspec + capybara, not cuke).</p>

<p>My rspec tests have a FactoryGirl factory that creates a Store.</p>

<p>In my app, when a Store is initialized by init_store(coupon_code), a coupon code is passed in that turns on/off various features (by looking up the settings for that coupon in Coupon table).</p>

<p>So, when I create a Store factory, I also need to specify (via trait?) a coupon code. Then, down in my model, the method that initializes a store will use the coupon code to lookup a bunch of settings in the Coupon table. (Each coupon has about 20 attributes that turn on/off various Store features.)</p>

<p>My coupons.yml file contains the actual coupon table data used by my app. Now I need to make them available to the app when tests are being run. (Don't care about 'brittle', this table doesn't change.)</p>

<p>Having not used fixtures OR seed data with rspec, I'm not sure how/where to put my coupons.yml file and how to make the coupons 'load' into the test Coupon table so they are available to my app while tests are running.</p>

<p>Do I pre-populate seed data with coupons.yml? If so, how can I have that get loaded into my test database each time my tests run?</p>

<p>Or, should I use fixtures?</p>

<p>Either way, where should coupons.yml go and how do I load it (in the Store factories? in one of the specs? In specs_helper?)</p>

<p>When I search for stuff like ""using fixtures and factories"" or ""using seed data with rspec"" all I find is the advice ""use factories"" and yeah, I get that. But for this particular situation I need both, so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>function sendalert(alert)
{
    var img;
    img = document.createElement('img');
    img.scr = 'ico/sign_warning.gif';
    img.height = 16;
    img.width = 16;

    $('#alert').text(alert).slideDown('500', function() {
    $(this).delay(5000).slideUp('500')});
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I have a div at the top of my page that .slideDown and displays the message input into the function ($alert). However, since I have to have the slide down div in my header, and this function is farther down- I have to use .text to set the divs output.</p>

<p>Plain text output works fine and dandy at the moment (after several hours of trial and error). What I want to do now is add a small error icon in front of the error text.</p>

<p>I've had a hard time finding the .whatever elements? But from the list I found only .add and .load stuck out to me- I've tried both, but they didn't work. Below is my attempt with .add (basically used the same concept for .load)</p>

<pre><code>function sendalert(alert)
{
    var img;
    img = document.createElement('img');
    img.scr = 'ico/sign_warning.gif';
    img.height = 16;
    img.width = 16;

    $('#alert').add(img).text(alert).slideDown('500', function() {
    $(this).delay(5000).slideUp('500')});

Caught myself in a derp and fixed</p>

<p>to what it should be</p>

<pre><code>img.scr = 'ico/sign_warning.gif';

<p>In the example below, I am constructing this div within a separate parent controller termed 'employeeTableCtrl'.

<p>I was reading a text regarding improving your reading performance, and it suggested an approach of reading headlines and summaries first before focusing on details. The principle is to keep yourself interested and motivated avoiding unnecessary information. The text suggested flexible reading on what you consider important skipping walls of text you are already familiar with or with little use.</p>

<p>The above got me thinking.</p>

<p>I found an introductory tutorial about Betfair API on their forums: <a href=""http://forum.bdp.betfair.com/showthread.php?t=112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.bdp.betfair.com/showthread.php?t=112</a></p>

<p>I had a glance through it and I am not familiar with the syntax (yet)</p>

<p>The question to experienced programmers is:</p>

<p>a) should i skip the tutorial until I have finished reading a text book in VB.NET?<br>
b) should I focus on a textbook in VB.NET concurrently with the tutorial? To keep me interested and motivated?<br>
c) should I focus on the tutorial, perhaps using trial and error, asking questions in forums or searching online for things I don't understand?</p>

<p>What I am trying to achieve, is having a footer (size of one line- 20px) STICK to the bottom of the page. In other words, if there is not much content, it will be at the bottom of the page, rather than half way up the page (this much I have already achieved). However, if there is a lot of content it won't awkwardly sit on top of the content, it will be at the bottom of the page underneath the content. </p>

<p>Here is the relevant code I have done: </p>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>    #footer {
font: 12px Georgia, ""Times New Roman"", Times, serif;
color:#FFF;
background-color:#999;
opacity:1;
text-align:bottom;
position:absolute;
bottom:0;
width:100%;
height:20px;
line-height:20px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""footer"" align=""center"" &gt; Terms of Service &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp© 2014 (Blank) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbspPrivacy Policy
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you preview this code, you will see that it does work as intended, it sticks to the bottom. It's just if you have too much content, then the code is not pushed down, it stays at the bottom of where the page is when you open the website.</p>

<p>This works fine but doesnt give me the same context as my Account Controller as I am using Unity constructor injection in this to use my ApplicationUserManager from the domain.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

<p>So the ApplicationOAuthProvider seems to be used when getting an access token.</p>

<p>The problem line is shown above. This method gets called when requesting a token, and the userManager is always null.</p>

Will the shader compiler generally optimize those expressions on the uniforms so they happen once instead of on every pixel?  Or should I do the computations outside the shader and pass the results in?</p>

<p>Specifically, I've got three uniform coordinates I'm passing into the shader:</p>

<pre><code>uniform vec2 u_a;
uniform vec2 u_b;
uniform vec2 u_c;

<p>And then I compute some vectors among those points:</p>

<pre><code>vec2 v0 = u_c - u_a;
vec2 v1 = u_b - u_a;

<p>I'm curious if the shader compiler can optimize these such that they happen once per render, or if I should compute these outside the shader and pass them in as additional uniforms. Of course, for optimizations, I should really measure things to find the difference in my specific situation (since the GPU might be faster doing this on every pixel than my CPU), but I'm interested in how much scope the shader compilers have for optimizations like this in general.</p>

<p>Bonus points if you know that shader compilers on Android/iPhone devices might behave differently, or if different GLSL versions make a difference.</p>

<p>I have 2 controllers currently, one to handle the app's basic use case, and one for handling user accounts.  The basic use case requires user authentication to do anything other than simply browse the site, and I'd like to provide that authentication via Facebook.  What I'm 
looking to do is ""register"" the user with my app when they log in with Facebook the first time.  The only thing my User model defines is a facebook_id field.  As far as I can tell, this might require some kind of callback from Facebook to my app to initiate the registration.  I think I also need to be able to determine when a user has logged in so 
that the extended functionality can be provided to them; my understanding is that this can be implemented as a before_filter, so what I have so far is: </p>

def authenticate 
  @facebook_cookies ||= Koala::Facebook::OAuth.new.get_user_info_from_cookie(cookies)

I've also configured my facebook.yml file as per <a href=""https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/Koala-on-Rails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/Koala-on-Rails</a>, and tried adding callback_url parameter too (I don't even know if this is a valid configuration directive for Koala...). </p>

<p>I've read the GitHub wiki and Googled extensively, and I feel I'm stuck.  Is what I'm trying to do even possible?  Sorry if anything's unclear.</p>

  <p>You can use both a web.xml and WebServlet in the same application.

<p><strong>This is not true</strong>! In my case the error was due this phrase: I had a <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation in my <code>ApplicationLifecycleUI$Servlet</code> together with the servlet mapping inside the web.xml file.</p>

<p>The two configurations can't coexist together, so you must choose whether to use web.xml or <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation for the URL mapping, or you will get this error when you are trying to start Tomcat.</p>

What I am wondering is - <strong>is it possible to integrate Angular JS Application inside Joomla?</strong> From what I was reading about Joomla, I understand that this cms makes it easy to create Articles and manage contents and menus from Admin panel. However, since Angular JS app is an application by itself, an article page wont work ofcourse. So how do people go about integrating this?</p>

<p><strong>About Angular App:</strong></p>

<p>My Angular App is a bit similar to the <a href=""https://github.com/DanWahlin/CustomerManager"" rel=""nofollow"">Dan Wahlin's Customer Manager App</a> which has a separate MySQL DB for this app and using php for server side processing on Apache.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for trying to integrate Angular JS with Joomla:</strong></p>

<p>The main being, Joomla provides the user registration features, permission management for users, etc.. out of the box and I am planning to install the Membership extension to it. I only want the paid members to have access to the Angular App. That is what I am trying to achieve.</p>

<p><strong>What I have researched so far:</strong></p>

<p>1) I looked into <code>directPHP</code> extension to see if the Angular JS app can be inserted using this ext. But I dont think that will work nor is it the right way to do it.</p>

<p>2) On searching more, I came across this Joomla Tutorial and I am not sure if that is the way to go with it. ""Developing a MVC Component"": <a href=""http://docs.joomla.org/Developing_a_Model-View-Controller_%28MVC%29_Component_for_Joomla!2.5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.joomla.org/Developing_a_Model-View-Controller_%28MVC%29_Component_for_Joomla!2.5</a></p>

<p><strong>If anyone can guide me on these will help me tremendously:</strong></p>

<p>1) An overview on how the Angular App can be integrated with Joomla, what needs to be done, the requirements, etc... I understand that explaining this will be beyond the scope of SO, but some pointers here will help.</p>

<p>2) Show / guide me the way on where I need to start reading in order to achieve this. I tried googling on this topic and I cant find any tutorial that shows how to integrate Angular and Joomla.</p>

<p>i have addListener method in p:ajax in p:selectOneMenu.This method is working in this way;
you are selecting one object from selectOneMenu and this object is put in the last index of the list filling selectOneMenu ,the object in the last index of the list is put in the index of selected object.I mean you are selecting an object and the index of this object in the list is 2.In total there are five objects in the list ,let we say.selected object whose index is 2 is put in index 4 of the list.The object in index 4 of the list is put in index 2 of the list.I am sorry for my english.The aim of this addListener method,selectOneMenu displays the last item of the list as selected always.Whichever object you select,IT DISPLAYS THE LAST ITEM OF THE LIST.Therefore due to this method , the object i selected is put in the last of the list and it displays as selected to user.The method works fine.
But when page is loaded first , the last item of the list is shown as selected in p:selectOneMenu ,i want ""please select"" to be shown as default.""

<p>This is the load code, the first example works, Textie is a textbox that auto completes when a match is found. The problem is that i want the matches to get added to a listbox instead. The second example doesn't work and i cant figure out why, the items doesnt get added to the listbox. </p>

<pre><code>        if (!Page.IsPostBack)
    {     

        Textie.Attributes.Add(""onblur"", ""javascript:CallMe('"" + Textie.ClientID + ""',        '"" + Textie.ClientID + ""')"");

        //ListBox1.Attributes.Add(""onblur"", ""javascript:CallMe('"" + Textie.ClientID + ""', '"" + ListBox1.ClientID + ""')"");

    }

In other words, the master view controller always shows in landscape and overlays the detail view controller in portrait when the back button is pressed.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was make the master view controller mimic the same functionality in landscape as it does in portrait.  In other words, when the device is in landscape, I want the master view controller to be hidden until I hit the back button and then I want it to overlay the detail view controller.</p>

<p>I figured the best way to do this was to use the following code:</p>

<pre><code> - (BOOL)splitViewController:(UISplitViewController *)svc shouldHideViewController:     (UIViewController *)vc inOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)orientation
 {
     return self.bHideMaster;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>This worked in that it hid the master view controller in landscape mode.  I then used the following code to make it reappear:</p>

<pre><code> - (void)hideUnhidePagesController:(id)sender
 {
     [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL];
     [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.30f];

     UISplitViewController* spv = self.splitViewController;

     // Change hide to unhide or vica versa
     self.bHideMaster= !self.bHideMaster;

     // Hide the button if master is visible
     if(self.bHideMaster)
     {
         self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = self.pagesBarButton;
     }
     else
     {
          self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = nil;
     }

     [spv.view setNeedsLayout];
     [spv willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:self.interfaceOrientation duration:0];
     [[self.splitViewController.viewControllers lastObject] view].frame = self.splitViewController.view.frame;
     [UIView commitAnimations];
 }
</code></pre>

<p>This ALMOST worked.  I have 2 problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The transition from hide-to-unhide and unhide-to-hide the master view controller isn't animated and is much to stark.  I added animation code (see above) but it only animates the detail view controller and not the master view controller.  The master appears and dis-appears instantly (leaving a black box on disappear) until the detail view controller slides over.</p></li>
<li><p>This also shows my second problem.  I want the master view controller to overlap the detail view controller when it appears in landscape mode, leaving the detail view controller as is.  Instead, it resizes the detail view controller (the same way it does in landscape mode before I started).  I want the master view controller to interact the same way it does in portrait mode: Master slides in over the top of the detail controller and slides back out when it an item is selected.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If I could solve problem 2, then I don't have to worry about problem 1.  It seems like there should be a method in the split view controller that would slide in the master from the left (overlapping the detail view controller).  It does it in portrait mode so the code must be there.  How can I call that same code in landscape mode?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>---------EDIT 1---------</strong></p>

<p>I have refactored hideUnhidePagesController and am getting closer.  The window now overlays in both portrait and landscape.  There is still a problem if the master is visible on rotation.  It gets confused and inverts the expected behavior.  I'm working on it.  Here the amended code: </p>

<pre><code> - (void)hideUnhidePagesController:(id)sender
{
    // Change hide to unhide or vica versa
    self.bMasterIsHidden= !self.bMasterIsHidden;

    NSArray *controllers = self.splitViewController.viewControllers;
    UIViewController *rootViewController = [controllers objectAtIndex:0];
    UIView *rootView = rootViewController.view;
    CGRect rootFrame = rootView.frame;
    if(self.bMasterIsHidden)
    {
        rootFrame.origin.x -= rootFrame.size.width;
    }
    else
    {
        rootFrame.origin.x += rootFrame.size.width;
    }
    [UIView beginAnimations:@""hideUnhideView"" context:NULL];
    rootView.frame = rootFrame;

The Builder class will call Rest API and get as a result field name and type. it is unlimited list of fields than can be 0 or even 20 fields, all is according to the Rest API results. for the simplicity of the question lets say the field types are limited to textbox and select only.</p>

<p>The rest API is already implemented, but as for the config.jelly I have no clue what to do.</p>

<p>For example:
the rest API returns:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;arguments&gt;
  &lt;argument&gt;

     &lt;type&gt;textbox&lt;type&gt;

<pre><code>&lt;f:entry title=""handsetId"" field=""handsetId""&gt;
  &lt;f:textbox /&gt;
&lt;/f:entry&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and if the rest API returns:</p>

I know it is recommended to always wrap the datacontext in a using but in a web scenario only, the kind of scenario I'm designing for, this is really not necessary because each page will spawn and die in very short time.</p>

<p>Given that background, I've looked at extended some of my linq-to-sql classes as such</p>

<pre><code>public partial class aspnet_User

<p>So, this is the design construct I've employed and it appears to work well for my case. Part of my problem is I'm using this built-in membership structure and trying to add to it which is easier then recreating my own but has certain limitations. Granted, the exact composition of interface to the object isn't ideal because some the functionality is stratified across the database tables, for better or worse.</p>

<p>My question is, for some of the child objects, such as aspnet_Membership, I've also extended that with its own DC. But, there is no mechanism yet for me to update all the childrens DC without setting each manually.</p>

<p>I'd like to see various design solutions that require a minimum of coding that could address this in a somewhat elegant way.</p>

<p>Also, any detailed and specific suggestions about the stratification of the objects might be appreciated. This could be a kill 2 bird with one stone.</p>

For moment i just make some test on a cube from a simple exemple found on the web.</p>

<p>The detection is good and accurate but the container has to be scaled when mouse wheel in order to make zoom.</p>

<p>(i also have to make a zoom on some images, the purpose is to superimpose images with some 3D forms in order to create an accurate detection on my images, these images are scaled with css transform so i guess the simple way is to do the same with the canvas container)</p>

<p>The problem come after scalling this canvas container (using css transform), the raycasting doesnt remain exact and i dont really know how to fix it, i tried to change some value but in a random way.
I guess there is something to do with the scale factor applied on the container but i dont understand which variable i have to modify.</p>

<p>I will try to scale the canvas using three.js directly and following the scale that i apply on my images but i dont know if that would be easier.</p>

<p>As it is now, every time I have a new project I need to work on (all of these projects use a pretty generalized base of functionality, but each have their custom functionality, quirks, etc.), I have to just copy the base project, and then modify the copied base project, to add the custom functionality.</p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<p>(I'm using ASP.NET MVC4, with Visual Studio 2012)<br/>
Basically, I'd like to have a ""Base Project"":</p>

<p><strong>Base Project</strong><br/>
-Controllers<br/>
-Models<br/>
-Views</p>

<p><strong>Custom Project</strong><br/>
-Controllers<br/>
-Models<br/>
-Views</p>

<p>that serves as the base for my MVC projects. Then, when I go to create a new project (spun off of the base project), I'd include the base project as a subproject to the solution, and in my new project, only have to write controllers/models/views that are different from the base (I'd like to just override those, or something similar).</p>

<p>This way, when I change the base project, the base projects of all of my different custom projects would be updated as well, this way I could update/bugfix/etc the base project, and not have to manually update each custom project to include this new base functionality.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>I understand that what I want is a little weird for MVC to handle, but I think I could get the whole routing engine to work the way I want, but I was just wondering if there were any solutions for this, that are a bit easier to implement. I feel like this is a fairly normal thing to want to do. Or am I thinking about the whole problem wrong?</p>

<h2>What I've Tried</h2>

<p>So far, I've created a base project, and a custom project, and I can get base functionality to appear in the custom project, if no Action is present in the custom controller, but the base project uses the custom project's View for that Action, whereas I need the base project to use it's own Action and View if they don't exist in the custom project.</p>

<p>Basically, if I go to:
<a href=""http://mytest.com/Home/Index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mytest.com/Home/Index</a></p>

<p>And the base project has a HomeController, with an Index Action, but the custom project has neither of those, the routing engine will be unable to find a matching View for the base controller, because the views from the base project are not being copied to the output directory.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Basically I'm just looking for some general guidance. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is it worth doing?</p>

<p>Also, if you find any misconceptions, please do correct me!</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

Other things I <strong>can not</strong> do are switch the order of functions being called in the controller, or in the model, because the controller uses the data returned by the model and logs it. Also I can't move the logging of <code>bar2</code> in the controller because there are multiple controllers ( and possibly more future controllers ) that are going to be calling this model. What I can do is manipulate the logger class code, but I can't come up with a clean way to switch the position of these two messages.</p>

<p>It seems that tkagg.blit couldn't get the right renderer, so it raise an exception. And I coundn't find where self.renderer._renderer refered to.

I guessed it's the problem of the Python 3.4 between Spyder, so I installed the Anaconda(32bit) Python 2.7 for Win 7, and tried to run the sample script above in another Win 7 system. Then the tkinter GUI showed normally with a matplotlib figure, and no exception came out. So I was wondering maybe it's the problem of the spyder version indeed. Our project is based on Python 3.4, and we don't want to move back to Python 2.7 becaouse it's complicated to migrate. I don't know how to solve this problem, please help or fix it. Thank you.</p>

So far the program is tracking the mouse and drawing the lines but the lines are all going back to a coordinate that almost acts as a origin. My professor mentioned that the freeform line is achieved through the variable previous x and previous y and how each time the mouse moves the old one is stored in previous x and previous y and then it will connect to the new x and y coordinate. </p>

I have a ListBox with a Style and Template to make it a two column style view.</p>

<p><strong>This is the Template for the ListBoxItem</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataTemplate x:Key=""ItemDataTemplate""&gt;
        &lt;Grid Height=""29""&gt;
            &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
                &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="".3*"" /&gt;
                &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="".7*"" /&gt;
            &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
            &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column=""0"" Name=""txtBind1"" Text=""{Binding Codigo}""/&gt;

        &lt;/Grid&gt;            
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;

&lt;Style TargetType=""ListBoxItem"" x:Key=""ListboxStretchStyle""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Template""&gt;
            &lt;Setter.Value&gt;

                &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
        &lt;/Setter&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;

    &lt;Style x:Key=""ListBoxStyle"" TargetType=""ListBox""&gt;

                &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
        &lt;/Setter&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And this is the ListBox:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox Height=""320"" Margin=""0,84,0,0"" Name=""ListaArticulos"" VerticalAlignment=""Top""
                Style=""{StaticResource ListBoxStyle}""
                ItemTemplate=""{StaticResource ItemDataTemplate}""
                ItemContainerStyle=""{StaticResource ListboxStretchStyle}""
                ItemsSource=""{Binding Articulos}""&gt;
            &lt;/ListBox&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This is the Result:</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/po3rd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>At this point, everything is fine, so I implemented a TemplateSelector to change the template of the ListBoxItem depending of SelectedItem of a ListBox. So I put the same template into a TemplateSelector but the Grid's Width is not Stretching.</p>

<p><strong>Template Selector:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataTemplate x:Key=""MultiTemplate""&gt;
        &lt;Views:ArticulosTemplateSelector Content=""{Binding}"" Filtro=""{Binding ElementName=ComboCriterios, Path=SelectedItem, Mode=OneWay}""&gt;
            &lt;Views:ArticulosTemplateSelector.FiltroCodigo&gt;
                &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
                    &lt;Grid Height=""29"" Background=""Gray"" HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch""&gt;
                        &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
                            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="".3*"" /&gt;
                            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="".7*"" /&gt;
                        &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
                        &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column=""0"" Name=""txtBind1"" HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch"" Text=""{Binding Codigo}""/&gt;
                        &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column=""1"" Name=""txtBind2"" HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch"" Text=""{Binding Descripcion}""/&gt;
                    &lt;/Grid&gt;
                &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/Views:ArticulosTemplateSelector.FiltroCodigo&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This is the Updated ListBox:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox Height=""320"" Margin=""0,84,0,0"" Name=""ListaArticulos"" VerticalAlignment=""Top""
                Style=""{StaticResource ListBoxStyle}""
                ItemTemplate=""{StaticResource MultiTemplate}""

                ItemsSource=""{Binding Articulos}""&gt;
            &lt;/ListBox&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Final Result:</strong></p>

Example from article:</p>

<pre><code>// SLOWER: as shown in http://ideone.com/1wnF1
private static void linearInsertion(Integer[] intArray, List&lt;Integer&gt; list) {
[...]
int list_size = list.size();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; list_size; i++) {
if (integer.compareTo(list.get(i)) &gt;= 0) { // ... more code

// FASTER: as shown in http://ideone.com/JOJ05
private static void linearInsertion(Integer[] intArray, ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) {
[...]
int list_size = list.size();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; list_size; i++) {
if (integer.compareTo(list.get(i)) &gt;= 0) { // ... more code
</code></pre>

<p>From reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generic list algorithms are encouraged to check whether the given list
  is an instanceof this interface before applying an algorithm that
  would provide poor performance if it were applied to a sequential
  access list, and to alter their behavior if necessary to guarantee
  acceptable performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if we really pass ArrayList in the above methods and check <code>list instanceof RandomAccess</code>, it will be true in both cases.
So, my first question is <strong>why the Java VM should interpret this as a sequential list in the first method?</strong></p>

<p>I have modified tests from article to check this behavior on my machine. When test is ran on the <a href=""http://ideone.com/U58ZA8"">ideone</a>, it shows results similar to kjellkod's. But when I ran it locally, I got unexpected results, which are contrary to article explanation as well as to my understanding. It seems that in my case ArrayList as List iteration is 5-25% faster than referencing it as an ArrayList:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/j8S6u.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>How can this difference be explained?</strong> Does it depend on architecture or number of processor cores? My working machine configuration is Windows 7 Professional x64, Intel Core i5-3470 (4 cores, 4 threads), 16 GB RAM.</p>

<p>Sometimes the keyboard shows up completely off the screen too, which is completely undesired behaviour.</p>

<p>After clicking this latter button, you can check that the observable <em>selectedCountries</em> contains the expected values by clicking the first button. Unfortunately, the UI control is not refreshed, do you have an idea how to do that? The html  databiding for my view looks like</p>

<pre><code>Table GAME: id(int), added_at(bigint)
Table META: id_game(int), meta(VARCHAR(64))
</code></pre>

<p>Now, each game can have 0 or more Meta tags related to it. I am trying to retrieve 9 games:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 random game with ""featured"" META</li>
<li>1 random game with ""premium"" META</li>
<li>1 random game with ""doublepoints"" META</li>
<li>3 latest games (ORDER BY added_at DESC)</li>
<li>3 random games which are not any of the 6 games above</li>
</ul>

<p>As of now I have a pretty cranky system of doing it, it looks more or less like this:</p>

<pre><code>$feat = getGameMetaRandom(1, 'featured');
$prem = getGameMetaRandom(1, 'premium');
$dubl = getGameMetaRandom(1, 'doublepoints');
$last = getGameLatest(3);
$rand = getGameRandom(3);
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment each <em>random</em> function takes two queries (from <code>getGameMetaRandom($count, $meta);</code>):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT FLOOR(RAND() * (COUNT(*) - "" . ($count - 1) ."")) AS `offset` 
FROM table_meta WHERE meta = '{$meta}'

SELECT t1.* FROM table_meta t2
LEFT JOIN table_game t1 ON t1.id = t2.id_game
WHERE t2.meta = '{$meta}' LIMIT {$offset}, {$count}
</code></pre>

<p>(gameRandom is very similar) As you can see this ignores my restriction of <em>which are not any of the 6 games above</em>, plus all of this takes 9 queries and the randomization is not truly random.</p>

<p>So my three objectives and my possible solutions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to make 3 random games not repeat any of the aforeselected games. After selecting the first six games I could probably list their IDs and use them in the last query with NOT IN () but that wouldn't be overly optimized.</li>
<li>How to make the random take games randomly, not selecting random offeset and taking <em>n</em> games from it? Using ORDER BY RAND() obviously, but I heard really bad things about how slow it is, though I suppose unless my table has hundreds of rows it doesn't make a difference?</li>
<li>How to reduce the number of queries? Group the first three queries into one, I am left with 5 queries, or by using the ORDER BY RAND() I can ignore the first ""offset retrieving"" query and go with something like <code>SELECT t1.* FROM table_meta t2 LEFT JOIN table_game t1 ON t1.id = t2.id_game WHERE t2.meta = '{$meta}' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT {$count}</code></li>
</ol>

<p>But still, thiese generally require using ORDER BY RAND() and some test I saw made it look to be awfully slow. Any hints to improve it even more?</p>

<p>I know that ID is unique to one element, but I can't figure out another way to get around this. Image 1 looks fine, but it's applying the same padding from Image1(landscape) to Image2(should be portrait) and Image3(should be square). Any advice as to how I can get around this? Thanks!</p>

<p>I need to process some input data. This data is given in an int with gives the number of data and a number of strings (i.e. char *) which hold the actual data. These strings are named data_0 ... data_n:</p>

<pre><code> int n = 42; // the number of strings
 char *data_0 = ""some input1"";
 char *data_1 = ""some input2"";
 ....
 char *data_41 = ""the last input data"";
</code></pre>

<p>So this is how I get the data. The question now is: How can I process it? My goal is to store them in a big array. Initializing this array is of course simple, I just need an array of n char-Pointer which I get with malloc.
But then I want to assign these strings into the array. And this is the point where I'm stuck. I need to assign them dynamically, as I do not know the size before.
Something like:</p>

<pre><code> for(i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
      datastorage[i] = data_i;
</code></pre>

<p>So I mean accessing the variablename dynamically. I hope you understand what I mean :) Thank you.</p>

"11397817","1","","","2012-07-09 15:05:30","","2","525","<p>I am experimenting with <code>Java</code> and GUI manipulation and I have a custom dialog created from a <code>jPanel</code> imaginatively called <em>DLog</em>, which appears on request to collect user input. This works fine, but of course my dialog is not modal, which leaves the rest of the controls visible and accessible to the user while the dialog is open. Not good at all!</p>

<p>To overcome this I have a separate <code>jPanel</code> called <em>DLogCover</em> which sizes with the window but which is invisible until required. When the custom dialog is shown a screenshot of my window is taken and shown as an image in a label on the <em>DLogCover</em>, which appears beneath my custom dialog, but above everything else (On the <code>MODAL_LAYER</code> of a <code>jLayeredPanel</code> - the custom dialog appears on the <code>POPUP_LAYER</code>). This works exactly as planned although there are two niggling points which I hope you may be able to help with.</p>

<p>Firstly the screenshot of course includes the title bar and left border of the window. I have taken this into account using arbitrary numbers which work for me right now, but of course this will be different on every OS because I use the system Look and feel and these sizes might be incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there any way to make sure that my screenshot is only of the inner content of my window (or any way to always get the correct sizes for the title bar and borders of the window, regardless of OS)?</p>

<p>Secondly, while my screenshot works fine it is simply an image of the window, and I would like to have it slightly faded or blurred in order to make it appear that there is in fact something covering the controls.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there any way to manipulate an image to give this appearance?</p>

<p>Here is the code I am using to capture the image and display it (before showing the custom dialog):</p>

<pre><code>DLOGCover.setVisible(true);
Point pos = this.getLocationOnScreen();
Dimension dim = this.getSize();
//Arbitrary sizes! These need to be discovered and set correctly!
int xLoc = pos.x +1 ;
int yLoc = pos.y + 11;

try
{
    Robot robot = new Robot();
    Rectangle captureSize = new Rectangle(xLoc, yLoc, dim.width, dim.height);
    BufferedImage bImage = robot.createScreenCapture(captureSize);
    Image imgwork = (Image)bImage;
    ImageIcon labelimg = new ImageIcon(imgwork);
    imageLabel.setIcon(labelimg);
}
catch(AWTException e)
{
    System.err.println(""Ouch!"");
}
//... show the custom dialog
</code></pre>

<p>Many thanks for any help you can give, and as before, the reason I am doing things this way is because I am trying to learn <code>Java</code> so I am experimenting, and currently it is with this!</p>

<p>Many thanks for any help you can give, and of course I am open to suggestions about alternative methods for achieving the same thing.</p>

<h2>Some Answers</h2>

<p>Id like to add this information so that any others who come looking can find the it.</p>

<p>Thanks to Andrew Thompson's code (many thanks to nIcE cOw for the link) I can now get a screenshot of just my window contents, negating the need to try and work out titlebar and border sizes:</p>

<pre><code>public static BufferedImage getScreenShot(Component component)
{

    BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(
      component.getWidth(),
      component.getHeight(),
      BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB
      );
    // call the Component's paint method, using
    // the Graphics object of the image.
    component.paint( image.getGraphics() );
    return image;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is called when I open my custom dialog and I am then able to modify the image to darken and blur it a little then display it in a <code>jLabel</code> which exists on my custom <em>DLogCover</em> (which is just a <code>jPanel</code> and a <code>jLabel</code> for the image):</p>

<pre><code>//get the screenshot
BufferedImage bufferedImage = getScreenShot( this.getContentPane() );

//blur and darken the image slightly
Kernel myKernel = new Kernel(3, 3,new float[] {1f/9f, 1f/9f, 1f/9f,1f/9f, 1f/9f, 1f/9f,1f/9f, 1f/9f, 1f/9f});
BufferedImageOp myOp1 = new ConvolveOp(myKernel);
bufferedImage = myOp1.filter(bufferedImage, null);
RescaleOp myOp2 = new RescaleOp(.6f, 0, null);
bufferedImage = myOp2.filter(bufferedImage, null);

//prepare the image to be shown in a `jLabel`
Image Conv1 = (Image)bufferedImage;
ImageIcon Conv2 = new ImageIcon(Conv1);
myLabel.setIcon(Conv2);
</code></pre>

<p>I then need to prevent mouse and key events from interacting with the controls on the main window, which are still accessible at the moment, even though they are hidden by the image. I am trying to do this with the following code, but this seems to block only the mouse events:</p>

<pre><code>myLabel.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {});
myLabel.addMouseMotionListener(new MouseMotionAdapter() {});
myLabel.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {});
</code></pre>

<p>Iv tried various controls in place of the <code>jLabel</code> but with the same effect: The mouse is blocked but the keys are not. This is something of a problem because one of the main elements in the app is a <code>jTextPane</code> which absolutely must not be allowed to accept extraneous key inputs. </p>

<p>For simplicity at the moment I am turning the editable property on and off as required to prevent accidental typing into the text pane, but this is very much a workaround hack because at some point I might have keyboard accelerators assigned and I don't want them being activated by accident when the custom dialog is open.</p>

<p>If anyone has any further suggestions to prevent any keyboard events reaching the underlying controls while the custom dialog is open Id very much like to hear them.</p>

<p>regards</p>

<p><code>log4r</code> isn't in my gemfile so I can only assume it's a (perhaps production only?) dependency of another gem. I don't know why bundler isn't downloading the gem and installing it if it can't find it? I put the gem in my gemfile, ran bundle install locally, and then committed and deployed again and got the same error but with a different gem this time (spreadsheet), so that appeared to solve the error in that case only, but doesn't identify the problem.</p>

<p>In the first step, we would check how many jobs (count) needs to be processed and places that in to ExecutionContext. In the decider, we check if the total no of jobs processed matches the count and returns REPEAT status if there are more job_ids to process.</p>

<p>We ran into exception as mentioned above when the first job's step remained in UNKNOWN state and second job (since decider decided there is one more job_id to process) got the exception message as shown above. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/T8rhl.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The top screenshot looks correct. It was captured on the latest generation iPhone (new screen) running OS4. However, the second screenshot is completely wrong. The high-res icons are displaying at 100% size and are getting cropped. That second screenshot was taken from my second-gen iPod touch (old screen) running OS4.</p>

<p>So, I'm really confused here. I've read over Apple's documentation, and as far as I know I'm doing everything they require. Within my app bundle I have images named as:</p>

<ul>
<li>tab-featured.png</li>
<li>tab-featured@2x.png</li>
<li>tab-topics.png</li>
<li>tab-topics@2x.png</li>
<li>(...etc...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Within interface builder, I have specified the low-res version of each image (the filename WITHOUT ""@2x"") to be used in the tab bar. If I understand iPhone documentation correctly, the device should automatically detect screen resolution and display the high-res version if available. So if anything, it almost seems like my iPod touch is incorrectly detecting its display resolution. Am I missing something here perhaps?</p>

<p>Any help or insight that can be offered would be appreciated! Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>

<p>No luck so far. I took the manual approach and added the following into the <code>viewDidLoad</code> command of my <code>UITabBarController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    UITabBarItem *tab;
    UIViewController *item;

    tab = [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@""Featured"" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@""tab-featured.png""] tag:0];
    item = [self.viewControllers objectAtIndex:0];
    item.tabBarItem = tab;
    [tab release];

    tab = [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@""Topics"" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@""tab-topics.png""] tag:1];
    item = [self.viewControllers objectAtIndex:1];
    item.tabBarItem = tab;
    [tab release];

    tab = [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@""Video"" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@""tab-video.png""] tag:2];
    item = [self.viewControllers objectAtIndex:2];
    item.tabBarItem = tab;
    [tab release];

    tab = [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@""Experts"" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@""tab-experts.png""] tag:3];
    item = [self.viewControllers objectAtIndex:3];
    item.tabBarItem = tab;
    [tab release];

    tab = [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@""Events"" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@""tab-events.png""] tag:4];
    item = [self.viewControllers objectAtIndex:4];
    item.tabBarItem = tab;
    [tab release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This still produces the same result as above (large cut-off icons within the tab bar). Has anyone heard of issues with the UITabBar populating high-res icon pairs?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>Regarding James' comment:</p>

<p>Yes, I was able to resolve this. It seemed to be an error with file references in XCode. I was running out of ideas, so I rolled back and started stripping out all @2x images from my app, just to get everything displaying correctly again with the low-res artwork. Once the app displayed proper size images again (albeit at low-resolution), then one by one I started adding the @2x images back in, waiting for something to break. It seemed to work fine the second time going in. Don't know why or what happened. The SDK just seemed to get some wires crossed as to what had happened.</p>

We are asked to create a chat-robot, where the robot is to answer randomly from a set of given strings until the user writes ""Bye!"", where the robot will simply reply with ""Bye!"" and end the program. I've written the following code:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Random;

public class Robot {

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    Random random = new Random();

    String[] answer = new String[6];
    answer[0] = ""blabla1"";
    answer[1] = ""blabla2"";
    answer[2] = ""blabla3"";
    answer[3] = ""blabla4"";
    answer[4] = ""blabla5"";
    answer[5] = ""blabla6"";
    boolean keepGoing = true;


    System.out.println(""Hello, how can I help you?"");
    while (keepGoing) {
        String input = in.next();
        int output = random.nextInt(6);
        System.out.println(answer[output]);

        if (input.equals(""Bye!"")){
            keepGoing = false;
            System.out.println(""Bye!"");
        }

    } 

}
</code></pre>

<p>I have two issues with the program:</p>

<ol>
<li>At times, seemingly at random, the program will answer with multiple strings.</li>
<li>When writing ""Bye!"", the program throws in another string before writing ""Bye!"". I do know that this may be resolved by adding ""break;"", but I'd consider this bad practice seeing as I am already using a boolean. (I'd like to keep using it.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I have no idea as to why these errors occur. </p>

<h2>TLDR</h2>

<p>I need help mapping <strong>Array</strong> response types from an XML-RPC API implementation to strongly typed C# objects. </p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>There are 2 different implementations of the xml-rpc spec that are being used, one for each. One is using a fairly easy to work with implementation, using StructParams with a nice logical structure. </p>

<p>The other one... not so much.</p>

<p>I have managed to get the requests across reliably, the problem comes with the responses. There are 3 different response types:</p>

<h2>Status Message</h2>

<p>This response is not too difficult to work with, it contains a struct with a nested struct and an int, which can be mapped to something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Response
{
    public Result[] Result;
    public int Status;
}

public struct Result
{
    public string Status;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The XML in the response which can map as above is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;methodResponse&gt;
    &lt;params&gt;
        &lt;param&gt;

                        &lt;value&gt;
                            &lt;array&gt;

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>This one gives me a slight problem, but I have been able to overcome it with some nasty extension methods, which I'm not happy with. It's similar to above, but the Result is now an array of an array of values, which I can only visualize as object[][][], so I am mapping it to:</p>

<pre><code>public struct Response
{
    public object[][][] Result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>From this, I can then use my extension method which uses reflection to map the individual objects in the final array to a specific struct with the correct types.<br>
I'm hoping someone can think of a nicer way of doing this. Here's the response XML that I am trying to map:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;methodResponse&gt;
    &lt;params&gt;
        &lt;param&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;
                &lt;struct&gt;
                    &lt;member&gt;
                        &lt;name&gt;Result&lt;/name&gt;
                        &lt;value&gt;
                            &lt;array&gt;
                                &lt;data&gt;
                                    &lt;value&gt;
                                        &lt;array&gt;
                                            &lt;data&gt;
                                                &lt;value&gt;&lt;i4&gt;1&lt;/i4&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
                                                &lt;value&gt;second slot (string)&lt;/value&gt;
                                                &lt;value&gt;&lt;double&gt;1.23&lt;/double&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
                                                &lt;value&gt;&lt;i4&gt;1&lt;/i4&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
                                                &lt;value&gt;Another string slot&lt;/value&gt;
                                            &lt;/data&gt;
                                        &lt;/array&gt;
                                    &lt;/value&gt;
                                &lt;/data&gt;
                            &lt;/array&gt;
                        &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;/member&gt;
                &lt;/struct&gt;
            &lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/methodResponse&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Array</h2>

<p>Array responses are where it becomes really tricky. I've not been able to get anything to work reliably with these kinds of responses. </p>

<p>I have tried adding an extra dimension to the object array as with the struct response, but then I'm left with <code>object[][][][]</code> which I would then have to grab the final 2 dimensions, loop through them and map them to an array of a specific struct. I'm REALLY hoping there's an alternative method that I'm missing here. </p>

<p>Here's the sample XML for this kind of response:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;methodResponse&gt;
  &lt;params&gt;
    &lt;param&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;
        &lt;struct&gt;
          &lt;member&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Result&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;
              &lt;array&gt;
                &lt;data&gt;
                  &lt;value&gt;
                    &lt;array&gt;
                      &lt;data&gt;

                              &lt;value&gt;
                                &lt;i4&gt;1&lt;/i4&gt;
                              &lt;/value&gt;
                              &lt;value&gt;Disk Space&lt;/value&gt;
                              &lt;value&gt;MB&lt;/value&gt;
                              &lt;value&gt;

At my work we have 50+ projects which live across a few different solutions.  When projects are in the same solution you can set a Project Reference and it picks up the assembly in the \debug or \release folder accordingly.  But when setting an external reference (via Browse) and you point explicitly to \debug\assebmly.dll or \release\assembly.dll the referencing project will not pick up a ""release"" assembly if the referenced project is compiled in release mode.  </p>

<p>I understand that normally a build process can handle this, but in the case where I need to compile a project in release mode outside of a build process this means I have to check all external references to make sure they are pointing to the \release folders.  This is something easy to miss - and I do not want to have to think about everytime.  So my thoughts are to always compile the assembly for a project to the \bin folder whether debug or release configuration is selected.  Any cons to this approach?</p>

In a single query, I'd like get a managers direct reports including any direct reports from subordinate mangers all the way down to the lowest staff when given a managersid in a <code>WHERE</code> clause.</p>

<p>I can create a query that will show who reports to who:</p>

<pre><code>    SELECT MANAGER.[EMPLID] AS MANAGEREMPLID, MANAGER.[NAME], MANAGER.[SUPERVISOR_ID], STAFF.[EMPLID] AS STAFFEMPLID, STAFF.[NAME], STAFF.[SUPERVISOR_ID]  
  FROM MYHRTABLE AS MANAGER INNER JOIN MYHRTABLE AS STAFF
  ON MANAGER.[EMPLID] = STAFF.[SUPERVISOR_ID]
  ORDER BY MANAGER.[NAME], STAFF.[NAME]

<p>or recursive CTE that seemingly does the same thing</p>

<pre><code> WITH MYCTE
AS ( 
SELECT [EMPLID], [NAME],[SUPERVISOR_ID] FROM 
    (SELECT [EMPLID], [NAME], 
        CASE WHEN [EMPLID] = [SUPERVISOR_ID] THEN NULL ELSE [SUPERVISOR_ID] END AS [SUPERVISOR_ID]              
    FROM MYHRTABLE) AS MYDATA
        WHERE [SUPERVISOR_ID] IS NULL

UNION ALL

    SELECT MYDATA.[EMPLID], MYDATA.[NAME],MYDATA.[SUPERVISOR_ID] FROM 
    (SELECT [EMPLID], [NAME], 
        CASE WHEN [EMPLID] = [SUPERVISOR_ID] THEN NULL ELSE [SUPERVISOR_ID] END AS [SUPERVISOR_ID]

    WHERE MYDATA.[SUPERVISOR_ID] IS NOT NULL)
SELECT * FROM MyCTE
</code></pre>

<p>(the case statement is because the highest manager has the supervisor field reporting to herself)</p>

<p>What I was looking for was the ability to give this query a emplid and see all the way down to staff who reports to that manager.  In my two examples, I feel like I can see direct reports, but somehow I should do another join to see the rest of the information.  </p>

<p>And a second question kind of related, while researching this, it seems most people solve finding a managers direct reports using a recursive cte when I think it could have been solved using the first query joined to itself.  Given the two queries I posted, why would I use a recursive CTE to solve it when I could use the same table joined to itself?  It seems like I get the same information back?        </p>

But if I load them into my core application the controllers and views and ... will merged to the my core app.</p>

<p>The loading module mechanism is based on loading assembly to my current app domain in core, and registering the controllers and other services in my <code>IoC</code>'s container. Also I load the referenced dependencies by the module one-by-one into current app domain, so it runs perfect.</p>

<p><strong>BUT, my problem</strong> is that if two different versions of the same third-party assembly be referenced by two different module it causes error which it says cannot one or more dependencies of the assembly exception and the app stops!</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> what is/are the general solution or approach to dealing with above problem?</p>

<p>From the python file:</p>

<pre><code>self.w = Gtk.Window()
self.w.set_name(""App"")
</code></pre>

<p>I can use a css:</p>

<pre><code>#App GtkTreeView row:selected {
    border-color: #000000;
    border-top-width: 1px;
    border-bottom-width: 1px;
    color: #000;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And easily permanently change the style of the selection. To me this means that I should be able to dynamically get access to the <code>row</code>-object and its style where I could set the <code>bg</code> for the <code>Gtk.StateFlags.SELECTED</code>. </p>

<p>I've tried a bunch of weird ways, e.g (where <code>bg_color</code> is a <code>Gdk.Color</code> that works fine for e.g. changing the style of a <code>Label</code> outside the <code>TreeView</code>).</p>

<pre><code>        style=self.treeview.get_style_context()
        col = style.get_background_color(Gtk.StateFlags.SELECTED)
        col.alpha =  1.0
        col.blue = bg_color.blue
        col.red = bg_color.red
        col.green = bg_color.green
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>        style = self.treeview.get_style().copy()
        style.bg[Gtk.StateFlags.SELECTED] = bg_color
        self.treeview.set_style(style)
</code></pre>

<p>(produces error: <code>style.bg[Gtk.StateFlags.SELECTED] = bg_color
IndexError: list assignment index out of range</code>)</p>

<p>etcetera...</p>

<p>So please, how do I find the way to dynamically change the selection effect depending on the normal-color of the row? Or in other words, how do I find my way to the object that actually holds the style-setting for the selection?</p>

<p>I have read the following article which is very good but I personally think that is a an overhead and I can achieve the same much easy:</p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905797.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Extending the ASP.NET 2.0 Resource-Provider Model</a></p>

<p>I have already setup some ground but I'm not sure if my approach is fine. Basically I have created a service that is registers with DI.</p>

<pre><code>public interface ILocalizedStringProvider
{
    string GetLocalizedString(string key);

    string GetLocalizedString(string key, string deafultValue);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also i have created a Html helper like this </p>

<pre><code>public static MvcHtmlString LocalizedString(this HtmlHelper helper, string key, string defaultValue)
    {            
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(defaultValue)) return new MvcHtmlString("""");
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(key)) return new MvcHtmlString(defaultValue);

        ILocalizedStringProvider localizedStringProvider = DependencyResolver.Current.GetService&lt;ILocalizedStringProvider&gt;();

        if (localizedStringProvider == null)
        {
            return MvcHtmlString.Create(defaultValue);
        }

        string val = localizedStringProvider.GetLocalizedString(key, defaultValue);

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(val))
        {
            return MvcHtmlString.Create(defaultValue);
        }

        return MvcHtmlString.Create(val);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then the helper is simply invoked from the view.</p>

<p>First I want to know if this approach is good and if is not an anti-pattern. </p>

<p>Second my concern is this line:</p>

<pre><code>ILocalizedStringProvider localizedStringProvider = DependencyResolver.Current.GetService&lt;ILocalizedStringProvider&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Is it maybe better to resolve the service ILocalizedStringProvider in the controller with constructor injection and let the controller populate the ViewBag with the localization's? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This is what I came up with (with help from <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/ggplot2/54q_qdTE1L0"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>):</p>

<pre><code>require(ggplot2)
require(grid)
png(file=""multicolortitle.png"",width=800,height=500)
qplot(x = hp,y = mpg,data = mtcars,color=factor(mtcars$cyl),size=2) +

          label=paste(""4 cylinder,"",paste(rep("" "",spacing*2), collapse='')),
          gp=gpar(col=""red3"", fontsize=16,fontface=""bold""))
grid.text(0.5, unit(1,""npc"") - unit(1,""line""), 
          label=paste(paste(rep("" "",spacing), collapse=''),""6 cylinder,"",
            paste(rep("" "",spacing), collapse='')),

</code></pre>

<p>Here's the resulting graph:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/iuCKt.png"" alt=""Horsepower versus Miles per Gallon by # Cylinders (mtcars data-set)""></p>

<p>So, my question: is there a more elegant method to use for this? I'd like to be able to use <code>ggsave</code> for example, and creating the spacing for this is a highly manual process - not suited for scenarios where I need to automatically make hundreds of plots of this nature. I could see writing some functions on top of this, but maybe there's a better way to implement the methods utilized with the base plotting function?</p>

<ul>
<li>read a bunch of lines out of a DB</li>
<li>do some transformations</li>
<li>POST them to a REST web service in JSON</li>
</ul>

<p>I've got the first two figured out using an input step and the Json Output step.</p>

<p>However I have two problems doing the final step:</p>

<p>1) I can't get the JSON formatted how I want.  It insists on doing <code>{""""=[{...}]}</code> when I just want <code>{...}</code>.  This isn't a big deal - I can work around this since I have control over the web service and I could relax the input requirements a bit.  (Note: this page <a href=""http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/EAI/JSON+output"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/EAI/JSON+output</a> gives an example for the output I want by setting <code>no. rows in a block=1</code> and an empty JSON block name, but it doesn't work as advertised.)</p>

<p>2) This is the critical one.  I can't get the data to POST as JSON.  It posts as <code>key=value</code>, where the key is the name I specify in the HTTP Post field name (on the 'Fields' tab) and the value is the encoded JSON.  I just want to post the JSON as the request body.  I've tried googling on this but can't find anyone else doing it, leading me to believe that I'm just approaching this wrong.  Any pointers in the right direction?</p>

<p>Edit: I'm comfortable scripting (in Javascript or another language) but when I tried to use XmlHttpRequest in a custom javascript snippet I got an error that XmlHttpRequest is not defined.</p>

<pre><code>while($feedarray = mysql_fetch_array($search)) {
 *I pull the users post data here by using that fetch_array function and echo them out*

<p>At the moment, this displays all of the posts regardless if you're friends or not friends with that user. Which is not what I want.</p>

<p>So, how do I display my own posts and my friends posts? And if your not friends with lets say, ""a"", then how do you not display the post's made by ""a"" to that user who isn't friends with ""a""? </p>

<p>In other words, if chaotic(userId1) is friends with max(userId2) and their status is equal to 2(if status is equal to 2, then they are friends. If it's 1, the friend request is pending.)
How do I display my own posts(chaotic's posts) and Max's posts? Whereas If this record does not exist or status is equal to 1, I wouldn't be able to see Max's posts.</p>

<p>Hope you understand what i'm saying and thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"27481112","1","","","2014-12-15 09:41:35","","0","72","<p>I've been having some problems with my website lately. Everything was working fine until a few days ago. Suddenly some of my PHP-scripts would stopped working, together with a ssmtp server I had set up on another host. I will start with my PHP scripts:</p>

<p>The scripts are used to monitor some servers that are running on my Dedicated Server. One script is one I wrote myself using fsocket open, the other is <a href=""https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query</a>.</p>

<p>This is what I found out on Google and by contacting my customer support of my hosting company:
fsocketopen could be disabled:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8047583/fsockopen-not-working-on-a-specific-web-host"">fsockopen() not working on a specific web host?</a> --> the script provided says fsocketopen is available.</li>
<li><p>Firewall on my dedicated server is blocking incoming requests --> I flushed my IP tables by using this script </p>

<p><code>iptables -F
iptables -X
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t nat -X
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -t mangle -X
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></p></li>
<li><p>Fail2ban (service I have installed) could be blocking it --> I used <code>service Fail2ban stop</code> and tried again... Still same result.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both scripts worked fine before for a couple of months, so I'm sure it has nothing to do with the actual code.
I also installed sudo <code>apt-get install sudo</code> and I think this is when it started happening. I don't know if it's coincidence or not but I don't see how sudo would interfere with opening sockets. I did try uninstalling sudo <code>apt-get remove sudo</code>  but same result.</p>

<p>My hosting company also said they have whitelisted my dedicated server's IP.</p>

<p>Everything on my site works when I put in on my Raspberry pi at home. So scripts work, just not the actual connections. I honestly have no idea.</p>

<p>Next error is trying to connect to a mysql database:
<code>Warning: mysqli::mysqli() [mysqli.mysqli]: [2002] Connection timed out (trying to connect via tcp://&lt;SERVERIP&gt;:3306) in &lt;PATH NAME&gt;</code> and so on. The sql worked before, and googeling for time out errors didn't work out too well. Couldn't really find anything.
A localhost connection to my website host still works, so SQL is active, just not working to this remote host.</p>

<p>Maybe something that might help ""debugging"": I also can't connect to my website host trough mail..be. This also worked before but now it keeps throwing the error: <code>ssmtp: Cannot open mail.&lt;domain&gt;.be:587</code> I switched around ports to 25 and others, but help desk said it's supposed to be 587 so I'll believe them. Mail through PHP does work tho.</p>

<p>I've been talking with the helpdesk on resolving both problems but I'm not sure if it's really on their end. They say they whitelisted my dedictated Servers' ip so...</p>

<p>Thanks for helping!</p>

"32612404","1","","","2015-09-16 15:07:36","","0","57","<p>I have Tools for Apache Cordova installed with Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10 and with this I have created a project targeting Android and iOS.</p>

<p>When I debug on an iOS device (iPhone 5c, iOS 8.4), connected via ""remotebuild"" on a local Mac, all is well - the HTML is visible in the DOM explorer and the JavaScript console is shown where I can do what I want.</p>

<p>If I try to debug on a locally connected device (Samsung Galaxy Young 2, Android 4.4.2) the application starts correctly but I am unable to debug. ADB.exe is opening (it remains a blank window over VS) but there is no DOM explorer and/or JavaScript console - even when I return focus to VS.</p>

<p>According to the page <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn757061.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Debug Your App Built with Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova</a>, this should be a supported scenario as my device is Android 4.4 or later and this is listed as being able to be supported in the Visual Studio debugger.</p>

<p>Has anybody else had this problem and, if so, were you able to resolve it? I am sure that I was once able to debug like this (though to be honest I may have imagined this).</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #1:</strong></p>

<p>I just tried creating a couple of new Tools for Cordova applications and running them on the device; debugging worked as would be expected. I then tried loading and running the original project again - no debugging!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #2</strong></p>

<p>I have found the root cause, but not yet the solution...</p>

<p>The project I am working has different id's for the Android and iOS platforms, specified in the Cordova config.xml using the ""android-packageName"" and ""ios-CFBundleIdentifier"" attributes. When the ""id"" attribute of the same file matches the ""android-packageName"" attribute, I can debug the Android application on the device but can no longer debug the iOS application when that is deployed. If the ""id"" attribute matches the ""ios-CFBundleIdentifier"" attribute I can debug the iOS version but not the Android version.</p>

<p>I need the ""android-packageName"" and ""ios-CFBundleIdentifier"" attributes to be set as the work I am carrying out is an update to an existing application. Previously, one was built with XCode directly and the other with Phonegap and somewhere along the line they both ended up with different ""id"" attributes but I cannot change them now otherwise they will not be recognised as updates to the existing applications.</p>

<p>Are there other attributes that I can set in order to be able to debug both without having to edit the config.xml in order to select which platform I will debug?</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

Very convenient!</p>

<p>BUT ...
3 of the tables are ""enum tables"" that need to have their records set with specific Id value.
I tried to make manual mappings of these tables and let the rest be automapped.
But when the manual table is created it fails because it references a table that is automapped (and not available for manual mapper?)</p>

Note that InnoDB's FOREIGN KEY system tables store
constraint names as case-insensitive, with the

This class comes with a final variable <code>_ID = ""_id"";</code> to (I think) standardize the name of a column of row id's <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7899720/what-is-the-use-of-basecolumns-in-android"">SO answer about this</a>. However sqlite usually does not need this, since it internally maintains a row id, accessible as any other column through the names <code>ROWID</code>, <code>_ROWID_</code>, or <code>OID</code>.</p>

<p>For me, it seems logic to map <code>BaseColumns._ID</code> to one of this virtual columns, however since its a final variable, I don't see a straightforward approach.</p>

<p>How can (or should) I map <code>BaseColumns._ID</code> to <code>ROWID</code>, <code>_ROWID_</code>, or <code>OID</code>?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> According to sqlite documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""If a table contains a column of type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, then that column becomes an alias for the ROWID. You can then access the ROWID using any of four different names, the original three names described above or the name given to the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column. All these names are aliases for one another and work equally well in any context.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so, explicitly declaring an INTEGER PRIMARY column would be a duplication.</p>

<p>I get sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file on one of the self.connection.execute lines. sometimes the third or fourth (it happens also in other places in my program). </p>

<p>I work on windows. I am not sure why this is happening and what i am doing wrong. 
Would appreciate any suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>More Information (due to questions asked):</strong> 
- I am not using concurrent access. no threads or anything of that sort.</p>

<p><strong>edit- More info</strong>: i have added a timed retry on all of the connection.execute lines and it usually fails once or twice, and then works. I am guessing that maybe the data wasnt <em>actually</em> written to disk when the execute command returns.</p>

<p>My question is 2 fold:
As a quick fix I need to get the number of the chart (currently i+1) into the center of each chart. All my attempts result in the text being positioned relative to the document, not the group that contains each chart.</p>

<p>In the bigger picture I'm pretty sure I should be able to make this work using the data (possibly requires reformatting) without the horrible loop I've put in, and also without the explicit positioning I have added - by using some kind of bubble layout.</p>

<p>Any assistance would be gratefully received!</p>

<p>I want to get all page in one call regardless of if it have ajax calls to load different sections of the page.</p>

<p>One solution i am guessing may be if there is any thing like running server and requesting with url to get page which also maintain the session to submit form or some thing like that.</p>

<p>I am worried that if I have to change tab2 page structure in the future then it will be very difficult to modify.
A friend gave me a suggestion that instead of appending html in javascript, load the tab2 using ajax. He meant to write the design in tab2.jsp and when next button is triggered tab2.jsp page will be loaded.
With his solution the problem is if user goes back to tab1 and edit the fields and click on next then tab2.jsp will be loaded again which means sending request to server again.</p>

"28016665","1","28068136","","2015-01-19 01:12:07","","4","131","<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p>Recently I asked the following question on here, asking how to create a generic map function, and a generic instance of <code>Functor</code> for any arbitrary polymorphic ADT (Algebraic Data Type), like Lists, Trees, etc:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27856974/functor-instance-for-generic-polymorphic-adts-in-haskell"">Functor instance for generic polymorphic ADTs in Haskell?</a></p>

<p>Now, I'm trying to reformulate the above to be compatible with <code>recursion-schemes</code>. I.e, instead of defining the base functor, and then define the type as its fixed point, I want to define the type on one hand, the base functor on the other, and correlate them using the <code>Base</code> family type.</p>

<p>So instead of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>data ListF a b = NilF | ConsF a b
newtype Fix f = Fix { unFix :: f (Fix f) }
type List a = Fix (ListF a)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to do this:</p>

<pre><code>data ListF a b = NilF | ConsF a b
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
type instance Base (List a) = ListF a
</code></pre>

<p>This way I could leverage the power of the <code>recursion-schemes</code> library, while still being able to define a generic <code>fmap</code> for any of these polymorphic types. Not only that, but it's a more pleasant experience being able to use the ""normal"" type without it being a type synonym for the fix point.</p>

<h2>Attempt:</h2>

<p>Initially I thought about having a <code>Bifunctor</code> instance on one hand, and somehow coercing or making it equal to the corresponding <code>Base</code> family instance. At the moment I can only think about using <code>a :~: b</code> from <code>Data.Type.Equality</code>. This is what I've got so far:</p>

<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators, Rank2Types #-}
import Data.Bifunctor
import Data.Functor.Foldable
import Data.Type.Equality

gmap :: (Bifunctor p, Foldable (f a), Unfoldable (f b)) =&gt; 
        (forall x. p x :~: Base (f x)) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
gmap refl f = cata alg
    where
        alg = embed . 
              castWith (apply refl Refl) . 
              bimap f id . 
              castWith (apply (sym refl) Refl)
</code></pre>

<p>My problem comes in trying to define an instance of <code>Functor</code> though. I don't know how to specify those specific type constraints when defining the instance.
I was thinking about somehow creating a typeclass <code>Equals</code>, and doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>instance (Bifunctor p, Foldable (f a), Unfoldable (f b), Equals (p a) (Base (f a))) 
    =&gt; Functor f where
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't know if that's possible, nor if I'm approaching it in the right way (for instance I'm not sure if my definition of <code>gmap</code> is the correct one).</p>

<hr>

<p><em>For reference, this is the definition of the generic <code>gmap</code> from the original SO question:</em></p>

<pre><code>gmap :: (Bifunctor f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Fix (f a) -&gt; Fix (f b)
gmap f = unwrapFixBifunctor . cata alg . wrapFixBifunctor
  where
    alg = Fix . bimap f id

    unwrapFixBifunctor :: (Bifunctor f) =&gt; Fix (WrappedBifunctor f a) -&gt; Fix (f a)
    unwrapFixBifunctor = Fix . unwrapBifunctor . fmap unwrapFixBifunctor . unFix

    wrapFixBifunctor :: (Bifunctor f) =&gt; Fix (f a) -&gt; Fix (WrappedBifunctor f a)
    wrapFixBifunctor = Fix . fmap wrapFixBifunctor . WrapBifunctor . unFix
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>It was noted that the following definition of <code>gmap</code> would be more general, and would not need any weird application of type-level equality:</p>

<pre><code>gmap :: (Foldable t, Unfoldable d, Bifunctor p, Base d ~ p b, Base t ~ p a)
        =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; t -&gt; d
gmap f = cata ( embed . bimap f id )
</code></pre>

<p>However, I still can't find a way to create an instance of <code>Functor</code> that has similar type constraints</p>

I've got the playback part working and I'm trying to add visuals that respond to MIDI note events as they occur. I'm new at ObjC so I may not explain the issue in very clear terms... please bear with me... ;-)</p>

<p>So.. the BASS lib is C. I initialize and set that up in a viewController and set up a callback to get the MIDI events as they occur. </p>

<p>--set up the callback, passing a C function (cNoteSyncProc) and a ref to my viewController</p>

<pre><code> BASS_ChannelSetSync(chan, BASS_SYNC_MIDI_EVENT|BASS_SYNC_MIXTIME, MIDI_EVENT_NOTE, cNoteSyncProc, self);
</code></pre>

<p>--handle the callback:</p>

<pre><code>void CALLBACK cNoteSyncProc(HSYNC handle, DWORD channel, DWORD data, void* user)
{
   int note=LOBYTE(data); // note
   int vel=HIBYTE(data); // velocity

   [(id)user updateDrawingWithNote: note velocity: vel ]; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>--I found that I needed to call a method within my instance of the viewController in order to access the UIView I want to draw in so the callback above calls this method:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) updateDrawingWithNote:(int) note velocity: (int) vel
{
    [drawing updateDrawingWithNote: note velocity: vel ];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The UIView 'drawing' is a declared property of my viewController and is created in the 'viewDidLoad' method like this:</p>

<pre><code>CGRect rect = CGRectMake(0, 400, 1024, 100);
drawing = [Draw alloc];
[drawing initWithFrame:rect];
[self.view addSubview:drawing];
</code></pre>

<p>The 'drawing' instance and draws to the screen when first called - and it is getting the MIDI events, setting some vars to be used in the next 'drawRect' call, and then calling</p>

<pre><code>[self setNeedsDisplay];

<p>Alas, there is no visual change. I've looked through all my code, searched and read possibly related entries here and elsewhere but I'm still stumped. As a reality check, I put a button in my main view and call the 'drawing' method from there with some dummy MIDI values - and the view updates as expected - leading me to think that I have it wired correctly and there is something else going on.</p>

<p>Could my callback be occurring in a thread (or some context) that somehow invalidates updating the view? Is there a clean/good way of handling this? It occurred to me that I could use an NSTimer to basically poll some changed vars but that seems like a hack.</p>

<p>Finally.... ;-) Is there a better place/way to do frequent drawing than in a UIView (layers?)?.</p>

<p>Sorry to be so long winded but I figure that unless I explain it no one can help me out of this hole.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>@implementation SomeSingleTonClass

static SomeSingleTonClass* singleInstance;

+ (SomeSingleTonClass*)getInstance
{
    static dispatch_once_t dispatchOnceToken;

    dispatch_once(&amp;dispatchOnceToken, ^{
        singleInstance = [[SomeSingleTonClass alloc] init];
    });

    return singleInstance;
}

- (void)someMethodOnTheInstance
{
    NSLog(@""DO SOMET WORK"")
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>This I am fairly happy with but it leads to a lot of this:</p>

<pre><code>[[SomeSingleTonClass getInstance] someMethodOnTheInstance];
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, why is this better than a purely static class.</p>

<pre><code>@implementation SomeStaticClass

static NSString* someStaticStateVariable;

- (id)init
{
    //Don't allow init to initialize any memory state
    //Perhaps throw an exception to let some other programmer know
    //not to do this
    return nil;
}

+ (void)someStaticMethod
{
    NSLog(@""Do Some Work"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>All you really gain, is mildly cleaner looking method calls.  Basically you swap out this:</p>

<pre><code>[[SomeSingleTonClass getInstance] someMethodOnTheInstance];
</code></pre>

<p>For this</p>

<pre><code>[SomeStaticClass someStaticMethod];
</code></pre>

<p>This is a minor simplification for sure, and you can always store the instance within your class.  This is more intellectual curiosity, what Objective-C god am I pissing off by using static classes instead of singletons?  I'm sure I can't be the first person to think this, but I promise, I did a duplicate search first.  The few answers I found, I felt like were based on older versions of cocoa, because even the discussed singleton patterns seemed to suffer from threading issues.</p>

<p>For clarification:</p>

<p>A user enters a number on the previous page.</p>

<p>This number then determines the number of textboxes created and the number of strings created.</p>

<p>The textboxes and strings need to have uniquely generated IDs in a for loop.</p>

<p>I also need another textbox for the weight of each ingredient although I could figure that out myself.</p>

<p>So basically I want each text box and string to be named something like</p>

<p><code>""input"" + i</code> (where i is incrementer)
so that would make the name be ""input1"", ""input2"", ""input3"" and so on.</p>

<p>Assuming the bounded context is the entire application and not the individual bundles, I should be free to declare some aggregate root entity in an API bundle, and in the DDD style, a repository for working with said entity. Now, the crux of the matter: an explicit repository appears to be antithetical to the OSGi style because a repository is itself a registry (of domain objects), and this design sidesteps the OSGi service registry. But to do away with the repository would require consumers to program OSGi in order to perform lookups of an entity.</p>

<p>It is said that repositories are just a façade--does this imply that I should create a repository implementation which delegates to the service registry? This does not appear to be a coherent approach since consumers would have two entry points into the domain model: the repository, and the service registry itself. To forgo the repository would no longer be DDD because we're back to mixing domain logic with framework code in a spaghetti-like fashion.</p>

<p>So what's the take-away here? Is domain-driven design incompatible with the ""OSGi way,"" or am I missing some critical concept?</p>

<p>The id on <code>order by</code> is primary key which is indexed too.  So I don't know what is the problem. </p>

<p>I also have album and album permission table, just to check if media is public or private, if private then check if user has permission or not. I was thinking maybe that is causing the issue.  What if I did this in sub query, would that work better?   Also can someone help me write that sub query, if that is the solution?   If you can't help write it, just at least tell me. I'm really going crazy with this issue..</p>

<p>Yes, I think sub-query would be best solution for this, because the following query runs at 0.0022 seconds.   But I'm not sure if validation of an album would be accurate or not, please check.</p>

<p>I have been fiddling with jQuery recently (in short, I'm a newbie) and I was interested in the ""parents()"" method. In the article on jquery.com, they show an example that allows to display every parent of a &lt; b > tag.</p>

<p>Here is the link: <a href=""https://api.jquery.com/parents/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://api.jquery.com/parents/</a></p>

<p>And the script in the example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
var parentEls = $( ""b"" ).parents()
  .map(function() {
    return this.tagName;
  })
  .get()
  .join( "", "" );
$( ""b"" ).append( ""&lt;strong&gt;"" + parentEls + ""&lt;/strong&gt;"" );
&lt;/script&gt;

This setup takes a long time: for reasons hopefully not relevant to the question at hand, I need to populate the DB programatically instead of from an SQL dump.</p>

<p>The issue I have is with the tear-down.  How can I easily rollback all the changes made in the db setup phase?</p>

<p>I'm currently using Hibernate + Spring Transactional Testing support, such that my individual test methods are wrapped in transactions.</p>

<p>One solution would be to do the db setup within each test method, such that the db setup would be rolled back automatically.  However, the test methods would take forever to run since each method would need to re-prep the database.</p>

<p>Any other ideas?  Basically, I'm looking for a way to run my db setup, run my individual tests (each wrapped in a transaction which gets rolled-back after execution), and then roll-back the initial db setup.  Any ideas on making this working in a Hibernate / Spring / Junit fashion?  Is there a Hibernate ""drop all tables"" equivalent command?</p>

<p>Great, this seems to be working ok for testing simple addons. But it includes so much extra junk - stuff I am not using and don't need there.</p>

<p>Now when I download the .xpi file, rename it to .zip, and extract it to work on the files, when I repackage it to a zip -> xpi, Firefox tells me the package is corrupt when I try to install.</p>

<p>I have deduced that this is because the package is ""signed"" or something, and when I repackage it myself this is not happening.</p>

<p>Whatever. This is getting ridiculous...</p>

<p>So I want to use the SDK to work locally, and then just include the SDK in the directory somehow. But it looks like I need to install python and run something in order to generate some files first blah blah blah.... are you joking me? I can't just code my app, then include the SDK files?</p>

<p>QUESTION:</p>

<p>How can I create my basic addon/extension with the online Addon Builder, then edit the files locally, repackage it, and use it?</p>

<p>I would like to refactor it, which will change behavior of two classes.
When I change one class and its tests, all unit tests pass, though the algorithm becomes incorrect until refactoring is done.</p>

<p>This example illustrates that complete coverage by unit tests is sometimes not enough and I need ""integration"" tests for the whole algorithm in terms of input-output. Ideally, such tests should cover the behavior of my algorithm completely.</p>

<p>My question: looks like by adding such integration tests I make unit tests unnecessary and superfluous. I don't want to support duplicated test logic.
Should I remove my unit tests or leave them as is, e.g. for easier bug location?</p>

<p>Everything looks great until a task description is entered which is long enough to wrap onto a second line and then the 'time' item (on the far right of the screen) is pushed slightly to the right - off the screen - hiding some of the content.</p>

<p>You can see the short description displays perfectly below, but the long one pushes what should be '00:08' off the screen AND the task description moves to the left as well!!</p>

If you <em>resize the pane containing the result</em> the '00:08' doesn't fall off the page but it does clearly move too far to the right. </p>

<h2>Compare table sizes for nested vs. tidy format:</h2>

<h3>1. Generate nested/tidy versions of a 2-col and 5-col data.frame:</h3>

<p>I am experiencing this in all versions of Android, tested from 2.2 - 4.1.2.</p>

<p>The streams are in a suitable bit-rate for mobile and 3G connection. The same stream takes less than a second to start buffering in the equivalent iOS app.</p>

<p>Is there a way to specify the amount of time that should be buffered? I know that the Tune In radio application offers this feature ( <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player</a> ).</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit: I've tested again and found that it only happens on devices running Gingerbread and above (>=2.3). I know that Android changed the underlying framework from OpenCore to StageFright. So how can I optimise the media framework? It just seems wrong that the old HTC Wildfire can prepare, stream and play, literally 10x faster than the brand new HTC One X and Nexus 7.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyPreview extends SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.Callback, Camera.Preview Callback{

<p>Basically, it is the CameraDemo example. <a href=""http://marakana.com/forums/android/examples/39.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Android CameraDemo Example</a></p>

<p>The problem is, surfaceCreated is called just once (the way it should), but surfaceChanged is being constantly called (instead of just once, or when the surface changes), and I believe this is the reason why onPreviewFrame is never called. The camera feed is shown on the screen and it seems to be working fine, but it really is not.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that it works fine on Android 2.x, and the issues only arise on Android 4.1. (I have not tested it on other devices)</p>

<p>I have been looking around and I believe it may be the real reason behind this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7042377/camera-onpreviewframe-not-called"">stackoverflow unsolved question</a> and this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13772242/android-camera-previewcallback-not-called-in-4-1"">another stackoverflow unsolved question</a> and this <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=20999"" rel=""nofollow"">code.google case</a>. This last case has a ""solution"", but it did not work for me.</p>

<p>Andreas Öhlund answered a question on it <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7007562/nservicebus-property-injection"">here</a>, but I've been unable to get it to work using the advice he gave.</p>

<p>Here's my setup:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class CommandHandler&lt;T&gt; : IHandleMessages&lt;T&gt;, IDomainReadRepository where T : Command
{
    public IDomainRepository DomainRepository { get; set; }

    protected abstract void OnProcess(T command);

    public TAggregate GetById&lt;TAggregate&gt;(Guid id) where TAggregate : IEventProvider, new()
    {
        return DomainRepository.GetById&lt;TAggregate&gt;(id);
    }

    public void Handle(T message)
    {
        OnProcess(message);
        // Domain repository will save.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is specific command handlers override the OnProcess method and do their thing, then the DomainRepository will save everything.</p>

<p>Here is how I've registered the components:</p>

<pre><code>public class EndpointConfig : IConfigureThisEndpoint, AsA_Server, IWantCustomInitialization
{
    public void Init()
    {
        Configure.With().DefiningCommandsAs(c =&gt; c.Namespace != null &amp;&amp; c.Namespace.EndsWith(""Commands""));
        Configure.Instance.DefaultBuilder().Configurer.ConfigureComponent&lt;DomainRepository&gt;(DependencyLifecycle.InstancePerCall);
        Configure.Instance.DefaultBuilder().Configurer.ConfigureComponent&lt;EventStore.Sql.EventStore&gt;(DependencyLifecycle.InstancePerCall);
        Configure.Instance.DefaultBuilder().Configurer.ConfigureComponent&lt;MongoDbObjectSecurityDescriptorRepository&gt;(DependencyLifecycle.InstancePerCall);
        Configure.Instance.DefaultBuilder().Configurer.ConfigureComponent&lt;LocalTenantConfig&gt;(DependencyLifecycle.InstancePerCall);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Those are all the objects down the chain that are used by the DomainRepository; however, when I receive a command, the DomainRepository is null. If I comment out the lines to register the objects that DomainRepository needs, I'll actually get an error saying it failed to create it (Autofac DependencyResolutionException).</p>

<p>It should be noted that all the other objects use constructor injection (they're taken from a previously existing project). I tried changing them to use public property injection, but it didn't make any difference.</p>

<p>It would be much appreciated if somebody could point out what I'm doing wrong here!</p>

This page has a scrollable table where rows can be selected via a radio button. My problem is that when a radio button is selected a PostBack is made to the server to keep track of the selected value. This makes the page jump back to the value that is selected.</p>

<p>Is there a way to only check the Selected Value once I go from the page with the GridView to the next?</p>

<p>I tried to use the IsValid method which is called after the page is submitted, but since the selected index value is bound in PreRender event it is called everytime a new radio button is selected and the page jumps.</p>

<p>On the GridView I set <code>UpdateMode=""Conditional""</code> and I removed the OnSelectedIndex changed event. Unfortunately, a PostBack keeps happening. And even worse, since the GridView is made scrollable serverside only on first load in OnLoad method (<code>if (!PostBack) GridViewHelper.Scrollable(MyGridView)</code>) the scrollability is lost.</p>

<p>Is there a workaround?</p>

On the <a href=""https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/wiki/Vertex-Centric-Indices"" rel=""nofollow"">vertex centric indeces</a> docs page, there is an example involving twitter data. The Gremlin code is:</p>

<pre><code>g = TitanFactory.open(conf)
// graph schema construction
g.makeKey('name').dataType(String.class).indexed(Vertex.class).make()
time = g.makeKey('time').dataType(Long.class).make()

g.addVertex([name:'v1000']);
g.addVertex([name:'v10000']);
g.addVertex([name:'v100000']);
g.addVertex([name:'v1000000']);

for(i=1000; i&lt;1000001; i=i*10) {
  v = g.V('name','v' + i).next();
  (1..i).each {
    v.addEdge('tweets',g.addVertex(),[time:it])
    if(it % 10000 == 0) g.commit()
  }; g.commit()
}

<p>The explanation is that each edge represents someone tweeting a tweet vertex. This doesn't make sense to me as a schema. Why should any two nodes be connected? If the answer is that the edge connects different tweets that a user has tweeted, then one edge connects more than one node. This would mean that Titan is a hypergraph, which I thought it wasn't.</p>

<p>I will generalize by saying somewhat incorrectly that IOC containers support two component life cycles, singleton and transient.  But what we need is a middle ground for certain sets of components.  </p>

<p>Consider a view which displays a list of records in a grid. When the user clicks on a record, a new view opens to display record details and allow editing.  The user can have many such views open, each displaying a different record.  Each view gets its own model and  controller as well.   </p>

<p>Within the context of a given model-view-controller set, there are some components such as dialogs that are both transient and lazily injected.  That is to say we want a new instance each time we need to display one and since most of these transients are only needed if the user takes certain action, we initially only inject a factory delegate.  The delegate is then invoked as needed to perform the actual dependency resolution.  </p>

<p>Beyond the model, view and controller, there are a host of other components for which we want one instance per m-v-c set.  For example, we are implementing the NHibernate conversation pattern that calls for a session to be opened when the view opens and remain open until it closes.  Likewise, each set needs its own shared event broker and potentially a few ""other things.""  If all these dependencies were resolved at the moment the view was created, this would not be a problem.  We could declare all of them as transient and be done with it.</p>

<p>However, some of those lazily resolved dependencies themselves have dependencies on the model, the controller or the ""other things.""  So the problem is, when resolving a lazy dependency, the container behind the delegate needs to inject the right instance of each dependency.  This of course implies that the delegate itself is somehow tied to the m-v-c set, but that should not be an issue if the larger problem can be resolved.</p>

<p>Now above I said that I was oversimplifying the list of supported life cycles.  Most containers support some intermediate life cycles such a per-thread or pre-request, which allow scoping that is conceptually similar to what we are looking for.  These do not apply in a interactive UI scenario though.  It is not the case that each view is on its own thread or in some other convenient context that provides the basis for scoping.  </p>

<p>Thus my question is, what is the best way to implement a per-view (or per any arbitrary context) component life cycle using an IOC container.  Our present container is Unity but we have abstracted ourselves well enough that we could switch without too much difficulty.  So if this is more readily implemented in, or is implemented out of the box by another container, we could consider switching.</p>

No matter what I do though (such as repaint(), revalidate(), etc) I cannot get the UI to update the text until the Action Listener is done.  </p>

<p>I have never had this problem before, possible because I have never had to have several things happen in a single firing of Action Listener.  What am I missing?</p>

<p>TL;DR Why does the following not update the text on the screen until it has finished firing the Action Listener, even if I put in repaint() after each listPanel.add()?</p>

<pre><code>final JFrame guiFrame = new JFrame();
final JPanel listPanel = new JPanel();
listPanel.setVisible(true);
final JLabel listLbl = new JLabel(""Welcome"");
listPanel.add(listLbl);

startStopButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){@Override public void         actionPerformed(ActionEvent event){
     if(startStopButton.getText()==""Start""){
                startStopButton.setVisible(false);
                listPanel.remove(0);

     JLabel listLbl2 = new JLabel(""Could not contact”);
                listPanel.add(listLbl2);

     JLabel listLbl2 = new JLabel(""Success”);
                listPanel.add(listLbl2);
     }
}
guiFrame.setResizable(false);
guiFrame.add(listPanel, BorderLayout.LINE_START);
guiFrame.add(startStopButton, BorderLayout.PAGE_END);

//make sure the JFrame is visible
guiFrame.setVisible(true);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I attempted to implement SwingWorker, but still the interface is not updating until the action interface finishes firing.  Here is my SwingWorker code:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected Integer doInBackground() throws Exception{
    //Downloads and unzips the first video.  
    if(cameraBoolean==true)
        panel.add(this.downloadRecording(camera, recording));
    else
        panel.add(new JLabel(""Could not contact camera ""+camera.getName()));

    panel.repaint();
    jframe.repaint();
    return 1;
}

private JLabel downloadRecording(Camera camera, Recording recording){
    //does a bunch of calculations and returns a jLabel, and works correctly
}

protected void done(){
    try{
        Date currentTime = new Timestamp(Calendar.getInstance().getTime().getTime());
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(jframe, ""Camera ""+camera.getName()+"" finished downloading at ""+currentTime.getTime());
    }catch (Exception e){
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, SwingWorker (as I implemented it) is not properly updating the JPanel and JFrame.  If I try to do the repaint in the ""done()"", they are not updated either.  What am I missing?</p>

<p>Additionally, as soon as the JOptionPane displays itself, no more panels can be added to my jframe.  I am unsure what is causing that either.</p>

I am unable to use a ChannelFactory, as dynamic code generation is not possible in MonoTouch, and because I'm accessing RESTful services, I'm also unable to use svcutil to build the client classes.</p>

<p>This leaves me with building the client classes manually. I've gotten quite far but have hit a problem, here is my code for the proxy class:</p>

<pre><code>public class AuthenticationClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase&lt;IAuthenticationService&gt;, IAuthenticationService
{
    public AuthenticationClient(Binding binding, EndpointAddress baseAddress) : base(binding, baseAddress)
    { } 

    public AuthenticationResult AuthenticateUser (AccountCredentials credentials)
    {
        return base.Channel.AuthenticateUser(credentials);
    }

    protected override IAuthenticationService CreateChannel ()
    {
        // This method must be overriden in MonoTouch to prevent using a ChannelFactory
        return new AuthenticationChannel(this);
    }

    private class AuthenticationChannel : ChannelBase&lt;IAuthenticationService&gt;, IAuthenticationService
    {
         public AuthenticationChannel(System.ServiceModel.ClientBase&lt;IAuthenticationService&gt; client) : 
            base(client)
        { }

        public AuthenticationResult AuthenticateUser (AccountCredentials credentials)
        {
            object[] _args = new object[1];
            _args[0] = credentials;

            return (AuthenticationResult)base.Invoke(""AuthenticateUser"", _args); // Exception thrown here       
        }
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>The interface IAuthenticationService uses attributes to specify the endpoint Uri's:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
public interface IAuthenticationService
{
    [OperationContract]
    [WebInvoke(Method = ""POST"", UriTemplate = ""/Authenticate/User"")]
    AuthenticationResult AuthenticateUser(AccountCredentials credentials);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how I'm using the proxy class:</p>

<pre><code>var serviceHost = ""http://mydomain.com/"";
var servicePath = ""Services/Authentication"";

Uri hostUri = new Uri(serviceHost);
Uri serviceUri = new Uri(hostUri, servicePath);

var binding = new WebHttpBinding();

var client = new AuthenticationClient(binding, new EndpointAddress(serviceUri));

client.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new MyWebHttpBehaviour());

var credentials = new AccountCredentials
{
    Username = ""myusername"",
    Password = ""mypassword""
};

var result = client.AuthenticateUser(credentials);      
</code></pre>

<p>(For some reason WebHttpBehavior does not implement IEndpointBehavior, so I created my own class that inherits from WebHttpBehavior and also implements IEndpointBehavior).</p>

<p>The exception I receive is:</p>

<p><strong>System.InvalidOperationException: When manual addressing is enabled on the transport, every request messages must be set its destination address.</strong></p>

<p>Can anyone help?</p>

The intention is to share a cookie between the www.example.com and the portal.example.com subdomains, however, for this to work the SSL protocol needs to satisfy the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue to block Man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
<li>Encrypt/Decrypt in the same manner for both Server 1 and Server 2. So that they can get the same information from the cookie.</li>

<p>One field is a binary type, for example varbinary(50).</p>

<p>A second approach was to query threads using gmail advanced search for a particular label and date (e.g. after:2014/08/29 label:MY_LABEL). The problem was that gmail does not return threads that were created before 2014/08/29 but had a reply on that date.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on overriding fillInStackTrace on checked exceptions to return null?</p>

<p>The advantages are:</p>

<ol>
<li>you can use said exception for control flow without the performance penalty of filling in a stack trace.</li>
<li>You can pass an arbitrary object back to the caller as a property of the exception, regardless of the signature of the method that throws said exception. (e.g. an error message, a partly-initialed value, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The biggest disadvantage is simply that this is not standard practice.</p>

<p>But the only way of doing something similar is:</p>

<ol>
<li>returning null, or a ""special value"" back (e.g. -1) to signify something went wrong.</li>
<li>changing the callee to return a composite object of the value &amp; error code, and having the caller inspect this object to see what happened.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm looking for an arguments that are extremely convincing for or against the practice of overriding fillInStackTrace, or an argument that shows it's no big deal either way.</p>

<p>Apparently RIFE uses this technique:</p>

Based on the two ways I'm trying, creating the boxplot either removes all the subplots that I've already created, or plots the boxplot after the subplot grid.  But I can't seem to draw it within the subplot grid.</p>

df = pandas.DataFrame(data)

<pre><code>plt.figure()

plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
plt.plot([1, 2, 3])

plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
df.boxplot('val', 'day')

plt.plot([1, 2, 3])

plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
ax = plt.gca()
df.boxplot('val', 'day', ax=ax)

If I take off the using statement it works find but I haven't disposed of DataStream Dest properly.  My initial though was adding a parameter List to method one that I can add Dest to each time GetMessage is called and in method 1 at the end of the method loop through the list to dispose of the streams.  SendMessage can be called in a loop from a batch process so many streams could potentially be created and I want to leave it to the caller (SendMessage) to dispose of them rather than in GetMessage since SendMessage is where the send takes place and I need to make sure the message has sent before disposal.

<p>To move send into GetMessage I would have to change all the other object implementations on all the other objects.  I would rather let send message take care of the disposal for newtype5 because from a batch process it could be called 500 times.  Does this make the example a little more clear.  Send Message was already written an implemented against is several other objects with a GetMessage implementation.  Mine just happens to use a stream and I can't dispose of the stream before the send takes place.</p>

I am using BLuetooth to receive data from my Arduino. I modified the BLuetoothChat sample code to suit mine. The only thing I need to know is how I can extract values from my String array and plot it on the graph dynamically. I took some ideas off a tutorial on using AChartEngine till I'm left with theses codes:</p>

    //add single dataset to multiple dataset
    mDataset.addSeries(dataset);

    //Customization for line 1
    renderer.setColor(Color.WHITE);
    renderer.setPointStyle(PointStyle.CIRCLE);
    renderer.setFillPoints(false);

    //enable customization
    mRenderer.setApplyBackgroundColor(true);
    mRenderer.setBackgroundColor(Color.TRANSPARENT);
    mRenderer.setChartTitle(""Force Sensor Readings From Device"");
    float textSize = 30, textSmaller = 20, angle = 270;
    mRenderer.setChartTitleTextSize(textSize);
    mRenderer.setZoomEnabled(true, false); 
    //mRenderer.setZoomButtonsVisible(true);
    mRenderer.setXTitle(""Time (s)"");
    mRenderer.setYTitle(""Grip force (kgf)"");

    //adjusting margin width of y-axis (so y axis labels can be seen)

    view = ChartFactory.getLineChartView(context, mDataset, mRenderer);
    return view;
}

public void addNewPoints(com.example.fypapp.Point p)
{
    dataset.add(p.getX(), p.getY());
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Point.java (class for the addNewPoints function in LineGraph.java)</p>

<pre><code>package com.example.fypapp;

public class Point {

private int x;
private int y;

public Point( int x, int y)
{
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}

public int getX()
{
    return x;
}

public int getY()
{
    return y;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly I'm not very sure why the point class is needed or how to use it.</p>

<p>In my main class, there is a case named MESSAGE_READ in a handler that is called when the Bluetooth connection is established. The codes in MESSAGE_READ case will keep on looping since it is continuously called from a run() in another class:</p>

<pre><code>case MESSAGE_READ:

            readMessage = (String) msg.obj;

            if(readMessage != null)
            {

                Log.i(TAG, ""Data sent is "" + readMessage);

                    lineGraphPlot(readMessage); //a function I want to implement that plots the graph
            }
            count++;
            break;
</code></pre>

<p>readMessage is a public static String, with updated numerical data from the Arduino when MESSAGE_READ is called. </p>

<p>May I know how I can write a function called lineGraphPlot that will dynamically display the readMessage value on the graph from LineGraph? Thanks in advance.</p>

I searched high and low an could not find the format rules for certain elements in the form.
When I inspect the element of the forms I get the following list (I removed the ones that don't need addressing):</p>

<pre><code>_wpcf7:1562
_wpcf7_version:4.1.2
_wpcf7_locale:en_US
_wpcf7_unit_tag:wpcf7-f1562-o2
_wpnonce:2257b0dde3
_wpcf7_is_ajax_call:1
</code></pre>

<p>What I need is to know exactly what the value of every one of these elements can accept. For example - <code>_wpcf7_version</code> is it always only numbers and punctuation marks?
Or <code>_wpcf7_unit_tag</code> is it always only lowercase letters, numbers and dashes?
I'll wright the list and my assumptions regarding the possible values and I simply need to know if this is ALWAYS the case or can be something else:</p>

<p><code>_wpcf7</code> digits only;
<code>_wpcf7_version</code>: digits and periods only;</p>

<p><code>_wpcf7_locale</code>: uppercase, lowercase and underscore;</p>

<p><code>_wpcf7_unit_tag</code>: lowercase letters, numbers and dashes;
<code>_wpnonce</code>:
   digits and lowercase leters only; <code>_wpcf7_is_ajax_call</code>: digits only.</p>

The table gets large enough that cells can sometimes appear at the far right of the window. Mousing over a row shows the menu just below the row, and it dynamically shifts to be under the cell you are hovering (all via JQuery). A menu button or header div is revealed that you can mouseover to show the dropdown, which is a container div which contains two ul's that float: left so they stay side-by-side.</p>

<p>It works fine unless I mouseover a cell at the far right of the page. It works in Safari, in that if the dropdown is outside the window, the ul's stay in their float and bleed off the page/window. But in Firefox, there's a line break/the ul's lose their float the second one breaks to the next line to stay within the window. </p>

<p>I'm thinking of doing this using $ionicHistory. However, the method <em>$ionicHistory.goBack()</em> is not working.</p>

<p>I am currently using the usual <em>window.history.back()</em> instead, which works, but I don't understand why the ionic method is not working like it should.</p>

<p>Here is the view of the code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button class=""button button-block button-assertive"" ng-click=""goBackHandler()""&gt;
   Go Back
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the Controller:</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('starter.controllers', ['ionic'])

.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope, $ionicHistory) 
{
    $scope.goBackHandler = function()
    {
        $ionicHistory.goBack();                      //This doesn't work
        //window.history.back();                          //This works
        //alert('code to go back called. Did it work?');  //For testing
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This should be pretty straight-forward. What could I be missing?</p>

<p>So I have the following table named Student on my MySql DB:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; describe Student;
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| ID    | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| NAME  | varchar(20) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| AGE   | int(11)     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the tutorial link I have an interface named <strong>StudentDAO</strong> that describe the CRUD operation on this Student table of my DAO object</p>

<p>Ok, looking at the <strong>StudentJDBCTemplate</strong> class: this is an implementation of the <strong>StudentDAO</strong> interface, so in this class I have all the implementation for the CRUD method declared inside the interface.</p>

<p>Ok...I have some doubt about the JDBC method mean in this class.</p>

<p>For example when I have something like:</p>

<pre><code>public void create(String name, Integer age) {
    String SQL = ""insert into Student (name, age) values (?, ?)"";

    jdbcTemplateObject.update(SQL, name, age);
    System.out.println(""Created Record Name = "" + name + "" Age = "" + age);
    return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok...I think that this method <strong>create a new record</strong> in my Student table.</p>

<p>The SQL variable contains a String that rappresents my <strong>query</strong> and here I have the first doubt</p>

<p>When I have:</p>

<p><strong>String SQL = ""insert into Student (name, age) values (?, ?)"";</strong></p>

<p>what exactly mean? It means that the two input parameter of my create() take the place of the ""name"" and ""age"" int this String?</p>

<p>mmm...this sound strange for me, because this look like a String (infact is whithin """")</p>

<p>The scond doubt is related to the following line:</p>

<pre><code>jdbcTemplateObject.update(SQL, name, age);
</code></pre>

<p>If I have the SQL query inside the SQL String, why have I to pass also the variable name and age?</p>

<p>Can you help me to understand well how JDBC work?</p>

<p>Tnx</p>

<p>The above function constructs and destroys a temporary std::string with value ""name"". This inefficiency seems unnecessary, because std::string has facilities for comparing against const char* directly. I would like to eliminate this temporary.</p>

<p>I tried using a custom comparator with overloads:</p>

<pre><code>struct str_comp_t {
    bool operator()(const string &amp;s1, const char *s2) const {
        return s1.compare(s2) &lt; 0;

typedef std::set&lt;string, str_comp_t&gt; string_set_t;
bool has_name_2(const string_set_t &amp;s) {
    return s.find(""name"") != s.end();
}
</code></pre>

<p>However only the variant taking std::string is called; the const char * is ignored.</p>

<p>How can I make this set compare against the constant string directly, instead of constructing an intermediate string?</p>

<p>I'm guessing I'm doing something wrong with g++ because I keep hitting this problem in different projects, or maybe I'm using templates wrong.(?)
How can I resolve this error?</p>

<p>Edit:
I should mention that this compiles perfectly if I instead paste the member definitions into the header file and exclude the .CPP from the g++ command.</p>

It not a new project, however, it is extremely useful library for form handling like submission, so and so forth. Anyway, I have faced a problem. The form I want to submit has sever input fields but one of them is the iframe. When I use Twill Browser I fetch all of the fields except the iframe itself. It seems that this library fails at fetching iframe form fields. The weird thing about that iframe is, it is just a blank html page with html tag, head and body. To wrap it up, I want to know how to add iframe support to the Twill Web Browser without getting errors. I tried to add a new function to add new fields to the browser.py file but I got several errors from different project files. I know that it uses mechanize library as one of the python libraries to make itself work. There is not enough documentation on how to extend it or add more plugins to this browser. If anybody has any idea about adding iframe to support to it I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>The mechanize code that I wanted to add was</p>

<pre><code>br.form.new_control('text','new_form_name',{'value':''})
br.form.fixup()
br['new_form_name'] = 'Hello World'
</code></pre>

<p>Which could at least give me the control to add new fields manually and send them with post request. That's an alternative of adding iframe support to this headless browser.</p>

<p>Basically, I've got a base class, and a few derived classes, and I'm wondering how to handle their mapping.  Here's a ridiculously simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>[Table(""Person"")]
public class Person
{
  public int PersonId { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}

[Table(""EmployeePerson"")]
public class EmployeePerson : Person
{
  public int HoursWorked { get; set; }
}

[Table(""CustomerPerson"")]
public class CustomerPerson : Person
{
  public int DollarsSpent { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far, this is a typical Table-per-Type scenario, except for the hitch that the base class is <em>not</em> abstract -- it's possible to have a <code>Person</code> who is not an <code>EmployeePerson</code> or a <code>CustomerPerson</code>.  I'm having some trouble getting the EF to accept that, and when I try to load such an entity by ID, the ugly query generated by the EF returns no rows.</p>

<p>Has anyone implemented anything like this before?  Does TPT-style mapping always require the base class to be abstract?  I haven't been able to find any examples to the contrary, but no real confirmation either.  I can think of a few ugly workarounds I might be able to use if I have to, but I'd prefer a more elegant solution if there is one.</p>

<p>(One further hitch: I'm working against a third-party database, and so I can't make any changes to the schema.)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Regarding reloading the map - at the moment the above script is triggered by 2 tab buttons - if a map is loaded and the second button is clicked the script re-runs and replaces the existing map - I'm just thinking of memory issues - should the initial map instance be stopped before loading a second?</p>

<p>So I have tried to get my code to work by using CABasicAnimation. I want to achieve, that an image's frame is resized from its thumbnail size, somewhere within my view, to a full width position e.g. (0, 120, 320, 240) - on my iPhone.</p>

<p>What I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>[CATransaction begin];
[CATransaction setValue:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:1.0] forKey:kCATransactionAnimationDuration]; 

CABasicAnimation *scalingAnimation;
scalingAnimation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@""transform""];
scalingAnimation.duration=1.0/2;
scalingAnimation.autoreverses=YES;
scalingAnimation.timingFunction = [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut];
scalingAnimation.fromValue=[NSValue valueWithCATransform3D:CATransform3DMakeScale(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)];
scalingAnimation.toValue=[NSValue valueWithCATransform3D:CATransform3DMakeScale(4, 4, 1)];

[b.layer addAnimation:scalingAnimation forKey:@""scaling""];

[CATransaction commit];

<p>My nextstep would be to first try to move the image to a centered position then scale it to the correct size. However, I doubt I'm doin it the right way. Can anyone comment on my code/approach.... is there a better way? </p>

<p>I have appended an expample of the situation that gives the same errors. Giving the thread a function that is not templated (ie here one with <code>int</code> and one with <code>float</code>) does not result in an error. 
However since I plan to use this function with many different types I don't want to specify the template types. Also I have tried several specifyings of the template type (eg <code>std::thread&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>std::thread(function&lt;T&gt;</code>) without any success.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I call a template function with a <code>std:thread</code> out of a template function?</p>

<p>The following is a minimum compiling example of the situation, in reality the templates are own classes:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

template&lt;class T&gt;
void print(T* value, std::string text)
{
   std::cout &lt;&lt; ""value: "" &lt;&lt; *value &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   std::cout &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

template&lt;class T&gt;
void threadPool(T* value)
{
   std::string text = ""this is a text with "" + std::to_string(*value);
   std::thread(&amp;print, value, text);
}

int main(void)
{
   unsigned int a = 1;
   float b = 2.5;
   threadPool&lt;unsigned int&gt;(&amp;a);
   threadPool&lt;float&gt;(&amp;b);
}
</code></pre>

If you want to transfer something faster, you either need larger transfers, more transfers ""in flight"", or lower latency. For the case of reading from RAM, the concurrency is limited by the number of Line Fill Buffers.   </p>

<p>A Line Fill Buffer is allocated when a load misses the L1 cache.   Modern Intel chips (Nehalem, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell) have 10 LFB's per core, and thus are limited to 10 outstanding cache misses per core.   If RAM latency is 70 ns (plausible), and each transfer is 128 Bytes (64B cache line plus its hardware prefetched twin), this limits bandwidth per core to: 10 * 128B / 75 ns = ~16 GB/s.  Benchmarks such as single-threaded <a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/"" rel=""nofollow"">Stream</a> confirm that this is reasonably accurate. </p>

<p>The obvious way to reduce the latency would be prefetching the desired data with x64 instructions such as PREFETCHT0, PREFETCHT1, PREFETCHT2, or PREFETCHNTA so that it doesn't have to be read from RAM.  But I haven't been able to speed anything up by using them.  The problem seems to be that the __mm_prefetch() instructions themselves consume LFB's, so they too are subject to the same limits.  Hardware prefetches don't touch the LFB's, but also will not cross page boundaries.  </p>

<p>But I can't find any of this documented anywhere.  The closest I've found is 15 year old <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3390/video_applications_for_the_pentium_.php?page=3"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> that says mentions that prefetch on the Pentium III uses the Line Fill Buffers.  I worry things may have changed since then. And since I think the LFB's are associated with the L1 cache, I'm not sure why a prefetch to L2 or L3 would consume them.  And yet, the speeds I measure are consistent with this being the case. </p>

<p>So:  Is there any way to initiate a fetch from a new location in memory without using up one of those 10 Line Fill Buffers, thus achieving higher bandwidth by skirting around Little's Law?</p>

<p>Could somebody please point me in the right direction for usage of the Enterprise Library Exception Handling Application Block with ASP.NET?

<p>The main behavior change, is that it appears that my old app was running an OpenSessionInView type pattern - as several of my domain objects were lazy loading elements, but those elements could then still be accessed outside of the transactional/service layer classes (e.g. in my controllers) - having switched to annotations, this now fails as you would expect with lazy loading errors as the session is not open in my controller layer.</p>

<p>Below is the config I have been using - can any one explain which part of this is responsible for the OpenSessionInView type behavior my app was displaying previously?</p>

<p>So far, I understood that AB pruning consists in a recursive algorithm that takes into argument an alpha and a beta, which are ""limits"" beyond which you won't look for in your game tree. Also, we define a maximizing and a minimizing player, the former being the first player to have started playing the game. Finally, there is a ""depth"" which I understood as the ""difficulty level"" of the game, as the deeper an AI goes, the better it anticipates the moves; therefore the better chances there are for the computer to win the game. </p>

<p>However, my problem is the following. Suppose at some point that the computer notices its opponent (the human player) has a 3-streaks and is one move away from winning. Therefore my heuristic function should return -infinity to make the AI understand the ""imminent danger"" and to make it play to prevent the human player from winning: hence the recursion stops. </p>

<p>But here is the issue : when the recursion stops, the algorithm goes back to the previous layers of the game (the ""shallower depths levels"") where alternately, the 1st player will read <code>max(alpha, alphabeta(depth - 1))</code> and the 2nd player <code>min (beta, alphabeta(depth - 1))</code>. This means that the -infinity score will necessarily be lost at some point, so that the AI may never understand that the game is lost. </p>

<p>Could someone please explain to me where I got wrong in the understanding of this algorithm ? A version of the pseudo-code can be found on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>. </p>

So the constructor creates a thread (with <code>pthread_create</code>) and the destructor performs actions to cause the thread to return in a reasonable amount of time and then joins the thread. This is working fine as long as I don't instantiate one of these objects with static storage duration. If I instantiate one of these objects at global or namespace or static class scope the program compiles fine (gcc 4.8.1) but immediately segfaults upon running. With print statements I have determined that the main thread doesn't even enter main() before the segfault. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Update: Also added a print statement to the first line of the constructor (so before <code>pthread_create</code> is called), and not even that gets printed before the segfault BUT the constructor does use an initialization list so it is possible something there is causing it?</p>

<p>Here is the constructor:</p>

<pre><code>worker::worker(size_t buffer_size):
m_head(nullptr),m_tail(nullptr),
m_buffer_A(operator new(buffer_size)),
m_buffer_B(operator new(buffer_size)),
m_next(m_buffer_A),
m_buffer_size(buffer_size),
m_pause_gate(true),
m_worker_thread([this]()-&gt;void{ thread_func(); }),
m_running(true)
{
    print(""this wont get printed b4 segfault"");
    scoped_lock lock(worker_lock);
    m_worker_thread.start();
    all_workers.push_back(this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And destructor:</p>

<pre><code>worker::~worker()
{
    {
        scoped_lock lock(worker_lock);
        auto w=all_workers.begin();
        while(w!=all_workers.end())
        {
            if(*w==this)
            {
                break;
            }
            ++w;
        }
        all_workers.erase(w);
    }

    {
        scoped_lock lock(m_lock);
        m_running=false;
    }

    m_sem.release();
    m_pause_gate.open();

    m_worker_thread.join();

    operator delete(m_buffer_A);
    operator delete(m_buffer_B);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Update 2:</p>

<p>Okay I figured it out. My print function is atomic and likewise protects <code>cout</code> with an extern namespace scope mutex defined elsewhere. I changed to just plain <code>cout</code> and it printed at the beginning of the ctor. Apparently none of these static storage duration mutexes are getting initialized before things are trying to access them. So yeah it is probably Casey's answer.</p>

<p>I'm just not going to bother with complex objects and static storage duration. It's no big deal anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Linked lists</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Linked lists are mutable sequences that consist of nodes
  that are linked with next pointers. In most languages null would be
  picked as the empty linked list. That does not work for Scala
  collections, because even empty sequences must support all sequence
  methods. LinkedList.empty.isEmpty, in par- ticular, should return true
  and not throw a NullPointerException. Empty linked lists are encoded
  instead in a special way: Their next field points back to the node
  itself. Like their immutable cousins, linked lists are best operated
  on sequen- tially. In addition, linked lists make it easy to insert an
  element or linked list into another linked list.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Mutable lists</strong></p>
  
  <p>A MutableList consists of <strong>a single linked list</strong> together with a pointer
  that refers to the terminal empty node of that list. This makes list
  append a con- stant time operation because it avoids having to
  traverse the list in search for its terminal node. MutableList is
  currently the standard implementation of mutable.LinearSeq in Scala.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Main difference is the addition of the last element's pointer in <code>MutableList</code> type.</p>

<p>Question is: What might be the usage preferring <code>LinkedList</code> rather than <code>MutableList</code>? Isn't <code>MutableList</code> strictly (despite the new pointer) equivalent and even more practical with a tiny addition of used memory (the last element's pointer)?</p>

<p>I know (from <a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/0.13/modules/naive_bayes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>) that ""...the probability outputs from predict_proba are not to be taken too seriously"", but to that extent?!
The classifier can mistake <em>finance-investing</em> or <em>chords-strings</em>, but the <strong>predict_proba()</strong> output shows no sign of hesitation...</p>

<p>A little about the context:<br>
- I've been using <strong>sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer</strong> for feature extraction, without, for start, restricting the vocabulary with <strong>stop_words</strong>, or <strong>min/max_df</strong> --> I have been getting very large vectors.<br>
- I've been training the classifier on an hierarchical category tree (shallow: not more than 3 layers deep) with 7 texts (manually categorized) per category. It is, for now, <code>flat</code> training: I am not taking the hierarchy into account.  </p>

<p>The resulting <strong>GaussianNB</strong> object is very big (~300MB), and prediction is rather slow: around 1 second for one text.<br>
Can this be related? Are the huge vectors at the root of all this?<br>
How do I get meaningful predictions? Do I need to use a different classifier? </p>

<p>Here's the code I'm using:  </p>

<pre><code>from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
import numpy as np
from sklearn.externals import joblib

Vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(input = 'content')
vecs = Vectorizer.fit_transform(TextsList) # ~2000 strings
joblib.dump(Vectorizer, 'Vectorizer.pkl') 
gnb = GaussianNB()
Y = np.array(TargetList) # ~2000 categories 
gnb.fit(vecs.toarray(), Y)
joblib.dump(gnb, 'Classifier.pkl') 
...

#In a different function:
Vectorizer = joblib.load('Vectorizer.pkl')
Classifier = joblib.load('Classifier.pkl')
InputList = [Text] # One string
Vec = Vectorizer.transform(InputList)
Probs = Classifier.predict_proba([Vec.toarray()[0]])[0]
MaxProb = max(Probs)
MaxProbIndex = np.where(Probs==MaxProb)[0][0]
Category = Classifier.classes_[MaxProbIndex]

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
Following the advice below, I tried <strong>MultinomialNB</strong> &amp; <strong>LogisticRegression</strong>. They both return varying probabilities, and are better in any way for my task: much more accurate classification, smaller objects in memory &amp; much better speed (<strong>MultinomialNB</strong> is lightning fast!).  </p>

<p>I now have a new problem: the returned probabilities are very small - typically in the range 0.004-0.012. This is for the predicted/winning category (and the classification is is accurate).  </p>

Is this behaviour of AsyncTask intended?</p>

<pre><code>protected class AsyncStartService extends AsyncTask&lt;Intent,Void, Void&gt;{
    @Override
    protected Void doInBackground(Intent... params) {
        for (int i = 0, paramsLength = params.length; i &lt; paramsLength; i++) {
            Intent param = params[i];
            startService(param);
        }
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is more code to it, but this minimal fragment doesn't work.
It seems as if the foreach is done before the first param is enqued and then all items have the same value for <code>keyID</code>.</p>

"2249892","1","2422381","","2010-02-12 05:41:03","","9","567","<p>To begin with, let me say that I understand how and why the problem I'm describing can happen. I was a Computer Science major, and I understand overflow/underflow and signed/unsigned arithmetic. (For those unfamiliar with the topic, Apple's Secure Coding Guide <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/Articles/BufferOverflows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002577-SW7"" rel=""nofollow"">discusses integer overflow</a> briefly.)</p>

<p>My question is about reporting and recovering from such an error once it has been detected, and more specifically in the case of an Objective-C framework. (I write and maintain <a href=""http://cocoaheads.byu.edu/code/CHDataStructures"" rel=""nofollow"">CHDataStructures</a>.) I have a few collections classes that allocate memory for storing objects and dynamically expand as necessary. I haven't yet seen any overflow-related crashes, probably because my test cases mostly use sane data. However, given unvalidated values, things could explode rather quickly, and I want to prevent that.</p>

<p>I have identified <em>at least</em> two common cases where this can occur:</p>

<ol>
<li>The caller passes a very large unsigned value (or negative signed value) to <code>-initWithCapacity:</code>.</li>
<li>Enough objects have been added to cause the capacity to dynamically expand, and the capacity has grown large enough to cause overflow.</li>
</ol>

<p>The easy part is detecting whether overflow will occur. (For example, before attempting to allocate <code>length * sizeof(void*)</code> bytes, I can check whether <code>length &lt;= UINT_MAX / sizeof(void*)</code>, since failing this test will mean that the product will overflow and potentially allocate a much smaller region of memory than desired. On platforms that support it, the <a href=""http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/removefile/removefile-17/checkint.h"" rel=""nofollow"">checkint.h API</a> is another alternative.) The harder part is determining how to deal with it gracefully. In the first scenario, the caller is perhaps better equipped (or at least in the mindset) to deal with a failure. The second scenario can happen anywhere in the code that an object is added to the collection, which may be quite non-deterministic.</p>

<p>My question, then, is this: <strong>How is ""good citizen"" Objective-C code expected to act when integer overflow occurs in this type of situation?</strong> (Ideally, since my project is a framework in the same spirit as Foundation in Cocoa, I'd like to model off of the way it behaves for maximum ""impedance matching"". The Apple documentation I've found doesn't mention much at all about this.) I figure that in any case, reporting the error is a given. Since the APIs to add an object (which could cause scenario 2) don't accept an error parameter, what can I really do to help resolve the problem, if anything? What is really considered okay in such situations? I'm loath to knowingly write crash-prone code if I can do better...</p>

The answer provided there works so long as I am directly injecting a <code>ConnectionContext</code> into the controller, or otherwise know that a class is only used by a specific controller. Unfortunately that is not the case in my situation:</p>

<pre><code>ControllerA -&gt; EngineA -&gt; RepositoryA -&gt; GenericEntityAccessor

ControllerB -&gt; EngineB -&gt; RepositoryB -&gt; GenericEntityAccessor
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is when we come in through <code>ControllerA</code>, <code>GenericEntityAccessor</code> needs ""string A"" and from <code>ControllerB</code> it needs ""string B"".</p>

<p>Of course, the real situation is a little more complicated and there are some bad practices such as code that directly ""news""-up a <code>ConnectionContext</code> (it's legacy code). I'm currently exploring providing another component that provides the connection string that is injected via Autofac and configured in the controller using Lazy, but the bad practices are causing problems there also (i.e. once I start to change things in the interface, all the dominoes start to fall over and I end up 15 classes later wondering how I got there).</p>

<p>Are there any patterns, techniques, etc. that address this type of thing? I can't imagine it's all that uncommon.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>To provide a few more specifics, since I'm having some trouble getting this to work, in general we have the following hierarchy, showing which scopes I've applied</p>

<pre><code>Controller -&gt; InstancePerApiRequest()
I*Repository -&gt; ?
I*Manager -&gt; ?
I*Builder -&gt; ?
I*Adapter -&gt; ?
ISqlServerConnectionContext -&gt; ?
IConnectionContextCache -&gt; InstancePerApiRequest()
</code></pre>

<p>I've got a number of components that directly take ISqlServerConntectionContext and I'm trying to provide it like so:</p>

<pre><code>container.Register(c =&gt;
{
    var connectionContextCache = c.Resolve&lt;IConnectionContextCache&gt;();
    var connection = (ISqlServerConnectionContext)connectionContextCache.CurrentConnectionContext;

    return connection;
}).As&lt;ISqlServerConnectionContext&gt;().InstancePerDependency();
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately at that point I'm getting a null for CurrectConnectionContext. My guess at this point is I've got some component that isn't rooted from the controller and I'm currently going through the dependencies manually attempting to find it (AFAIK the isn't a way for my to find out which object triggered Autofac to attempt to provide the ISqlServerConnectionContext when I'm debugging).</p>

<p>UPDATE 2:</p>

<p>It turns out I did have some issues where I was registering things improperly, and creating a dependency on <code>ISqlServerConnectionContext</code> for <code>DocumentController</code>, even though it did not have one (this was created through the delegate for something it did depend on).</p>

<p>Now I've got a circular reference that I'm pretty sure I've created myself in the registrations:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>container.Register(x =&gt;
{
    if (x.IsRegistered&lt;HttpRequestMessage&gt;())
    {
        var httpRequestMethod = x.Resolve&lt;HttpRequestMessage&gt;();

        var tokenHelper = x.Resolve&lt;ITokenHelper&gt;();
        var token = tokenHelper.GetToken(httpRequestMethod);

        return token ?? new NullMinimalSecurityToken();
    }

    return new NullMinimalSecurityToken();
}).As&lt;IMinimalSecurityToken&gt;().InstancePerApiRequest();

container.Register(c =&gt;
{
    var connectionContextCache = c.Resolve&lt;IConnectionContextCache&gt;();
    var token = c.Resolve&lt;IMinimalSecurityToken&gt;();
    var connection = (ISqlServerConnectionContext)connectionContextCache.CurrentConnectionContext;

    connection.Token = token;

    return connection;
}).As&lt;ISqlServerConnectionContext&gt;().InstancePerApiRequest();
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is <code>ISqlServerConnectionContext</code> has a property of type <code>IMinimalSecurityToken</code> which is optional, and definitely not used when the <code>ISqlServerConnectionContext</code> is being used to look up <code>IMinimalSecurityToken</code>, which depends on <code>ISqlServerConnectionContext</code> through <code>ITokenHelper</code>.</p>

<p>UPDATE 3:</p>

<p>For completeness, in order to solve my circular reference problem I needed to use named services, and use a <code>SqlServerConnectionContext</code> that did not have the <code>IMinimalSecurityToken</code> property set for the <code>IOAuthTokenManager</code> registration. Now I'm getting the dreaded </p>

<p>What I get as output is as follows:</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Lets say I have a page which loads in taxonomy nodes into a carousel. If I view the page It looks pretty much as intended. If I view each of the nodes individualy /taxonomy/node it appears as:</p>

<p>Image:
[the images]
Content:
[the content]
Tags:
[list of tags]</p>

<p>Same goes if instead of the previous page loading the nodes as they currently do and I do it like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ids = taxonomy_select_nodes(array(1));
$professional_nodes = node_load_multiple($ids);
foreach( $professional_nodes as $view ) {
    echo '&lt;li&gt;' . drupal_render(node_view($view) ) . '&lt;/li&gt;';
}

The largest consumption of time on our build seems to be the large number of unit tests that, for one reason or another, take quite a bit of time to execute.</p>

<p>Recently, I've experimented with distributing the execution of the unit tests on a small number of blades. This increased the overall execution time of the junit tests into a very tolerable range but required a lot of manual scripting and administration on the CI box to keep the tests working. Ideally, I'd like to compile the source on a master node, use a distributed surefire like plugin to jointly run the unit tests and then use the master node to package the results. I don't see any significant gains to using a distributed compiler at this time.</p>

<p>Are other people distributing the unit test execution across a number of boxes? Are there any plugins (commercial or open source) that would make this process easier to manage? Any insight to how others are tackling (or not tackling) this problem would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>In the <code>onPostExecute()</code> method I need to perform some UI update so here's my problem: if I start the dialog and the AsyncTask (like above) and I don't rotate my phone, all works as expected. Same thing if I rotate phone AFTER the <code>onPostExecute()</code> method. But if I rotate my phone WHILE the AsyncTask is still running, when it completes and reach the <code>onPostExecute()</code> method it gives me the <code>IllegalStateException</code> saying that the fragment hosting the AsyncTask and the Dialogfragment is no longer attached to the activity. So I tried to override both the <code>onAttach()</code> and the <code>onDetach()</code> methods (with a simple <code>System.out.println</code>) of my fragment, to see when the <code>onPostExecute()</code> gets called. The result is that when I rotate my phone, I always got this output:</p>

<pre><code>onDetach
onAttach
... (if I rotate more my phone)
onPostExecute
</code></pre>

<p>So shouldn't the fragment be attached when the AsyncTask completes? Thank you all for your time and attention.</p>

<p>I have a Play app that serves search results by calling another service using multiple requests. The responses to the different requests are sent as chunks. Basically the requests are all fired and as soon as a request is finished, the result is sent back using Comet: I use the iframe method described by <a href=""http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaStream"" rel=""nofollow"">Play's doc</a>.</p>

<p>However, I noticed that in some cases, the iframe call finishes before all data has been sent back to the end user. I debugged a little and found that the requests eventually all finish and my browser shows a net::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING. I also noticed that the amount of data transferred to UI varies from one browser to the another.</p>

<p>Here is how my result looks:</p>

<pre><code>Ok.chunked(
      (stringEnumerator1 &amp;&gt; Comet(callback = ""script1"")) &gt;- 
      (stringEnumerator2 &amp;&gt; Comet(callback = ""script2"")) &gt;- 
      (stringEnumerator3 &amp;&gt; Comet(callback = ""script3"")) 
).as(HTML)
</code></pre>

<p>As far as what I've read in <a href=""http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaStream"" rel=""nofollow"">Play's doc</a>, this should do the trick but it doesn't and I have no idea how to solve this. Does anyone have a slight idea or tip on this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Here is how the enumerators are created. Once the call to the distant server has been emitted, I get a <code>Future</code> of an <code>Option</code> of the <code>case class</code> I'm expecting from one particular call. This future is passed to a method that calls a method (<code>toHTML</code>) on the given <code>case class</code>, this method creates an <code>HTML Elem</code> that is basically appended to a given <code>div</code> once a callback is called on the client's side. <code>Part</code> is an abstract class that my case classes inherit from then implement the <code>toHTML</code> method.</p>

<p>Here is the method that transforms a given part into an <code>HTML</code> string:</p>

<pre><code>def getEnumerator[X &lt;: Part](part: Future[Option[X]]): Enumerator[String] = 
    Enumerator.flatten(part.map(Enumerator(_))).map(xopt =&gt; xopt.map(x =&gt; x.toHTML.toString).getOrElse(PartNotFound().toHTML.toString))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>I found where the issue was, the thing is that in my <code>HTML</code> generation, there was a sum of two integers, one of these integers was at some point <code>null</code>, which made the <code>HTML</code> generation fail, Play then dropped the connection, what bugs me is that Play didn't throw an exception when that sum occurred.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it seems intuitive to pass only input values to a function and have only return output variables. However, passing hashes in Perl can only be done by reference, so it is a bit messy and would seem more of an opportunity to make a mistake.  </p>

<p>The other way is to pass a reference in the input variables, but then it has to be dealt with in the function, and it may not be clear what is an input and what is a return variable.  </p>

<p>Return references to an array and a hash, and then dereference it.</p>

Every time an non-player object is blitted to the screen, its X and Y are recorded in an array so they can be used later. As such, I have set up a system where if the player X and player Y are relative to an environmental object's X and Y in a certain way, the environmental object is not immediately blitted (Normally, it would be immediately blitted before the player character so that the player character is above the object). Instead of being blitted, I have a true value be handed to a boolean array. I have an int variable that gets 1 larger every time an object is blitted so that the different X, Y and boolean values are associated with a certain position in the array. Essentially, the system looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>HDcounter += 1;

forbiddenX[HDcounter] = modelX[modelNumber] + modelXChange;
forbiddenY[HDcounter] = modelY[modelNumber] + modelYChange;
forbiddenSpriteWidth[HDcounter] = 100;
forbiddenSpriteHeight[HDcounter] = 200;
forbiddenSpriteDepth[HDcounter] = 25;

if((forbiddenX[HDcounter] &lt;= playerXE + forbiddenSpriteWidth[HDcounter]) &amp;&amp; (forbiddenX[HDcounter] + forbiddenSpriteWidth[HDcounter] &gt;= playerXE) &amp;&amp; (forbiddenY[HDcounter] &lt;= playerYE + forbiddenSpriteWidth[HDcounter]) &amp;&amp; (forbiddenY[HDcounter] + forbiddenSpriteHeight[HDcounter] &gt;= playerYE + 77))
{
     pineTreeBlitAP = true;
     blitModelAP[HDcounter] = true;
}
else
{
     modelIMAGE = IBFobjectENVIRO.loadIMG(""pineTree.png"");
     IBFobjectENVIRO.blitIMG(modelX[modelNumber] + modelXChange, modelY[modelNumber] +   modelYChange, windowMODELS, modelIMAGE, 0, 0, 200, 200);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I try to use the boolean array to blit the model after the player, it does not seem to work. I can get something to happen when the player X and Y hits the threshold, but I cannot seem to get the true value recorded inside the boolean array and then used by my function. 
This is the function where it is used: </p>

<pre><code>void enviroment::blitEnviroModelsAP(SDL_Surface* BAPwindow, int modelAmount)
{
    SDL_Surface* modelAPimage;

    for(int model = 0; model &lt; modelAmount; model++)
    {
        if((pineTreeBlitAP == true) &amp;&amp; (blitModelAP[model] == true))
        {
            modelAPimage = IBFobjectENVIRO.loadIMG(""pineTree.png"");
            IBFobjectENVIRO.blitIMG(forbiddenX[model], forbiddenY[model], BAPwindow, modelAPimage, 0, 0, 200, 200);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get that this is probably a totally noob question, I just want some kind of help with this as I have been stuck for nearly a week. </p>

<p>Edit: Here are how my arrays are declared. </p>

<pre><code>int forbiddenX[2000] = {0}; 
int forbiddenY[2000] = {0}; 
int forbiddenSpriteHeight[2000] = {0}; 
int forbiddenSpriteWidth[2000] = {0}; 
int forbiddenSpriteDepth[2000] = {0};
int blitModelAP[2000] = {false};

<p>Up until this point, I've always persisted the String based object ID.  This adds an additional column to each table, but that doesn't bother me.</p>

<p>I was wondering - Is there any reason to persist the object id (the generated UUID)?  Or should the random UUID stay in the Java space?</p>

<p>I always base my domain class hashCode() and equals() methods on the UUID, not the primary key.  This is fine because the UUID stays the same for a given entity for its entire life, both in the JVM and in the database.</p>

<p>If I stopped persisting the UUID, what would the hashCode() and equals() methods look like?  Would it be like a two tier comparison, first using the primary key if it's not null, then using the object id, if the primary key is null?</p>

<li>Has anyone had a similar issue with Tweepy in GAE?</li>
<li>How do I get more debug information from GAE? I tried placing try/catches around the line and logging the exception, but I still just get a ""500 error"". This is the same error I get if there is even a syntax mistake. Anything at all wrong gives ma 500 error so it is pretty challenging to debug real issues. I am on Windows 8 running the server locally through GAE Launcher if that makes a difference. I haven't found any real help in their documentation on the proper way to debug.</li>

This is a large code with different components and I'm not going to put all the details here since it wont help. In a nutshell what I have is the following</p>

<pre><code>class MyObject(){
    inline SetterProxy&amp; operator[](int i) {
        SetterProxy a(i);
        return a;
    }
    inline double operator[](int i) const{            
        return some_value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first overloaded [] works fine for assigning values (if you are wondering what the SetterProxy is, I have to use Proxy classes to be able to do some checking and internal function calls before assigning values). However, the second one which should supposedly be called when reading does not work and the code crashes. I'm not sure what is happening here but when I comment out the first one it just works fine! Could it be that compiler somehow confuses the two since they are both inline?</p>

<p>Any thought would be appreciated.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Ok here is the SetterProxy itself:</p>

<pre><code>class SetterProxy{
private:
    Vec v;
    int i;
    double *ptr_val;
public:
    inline SetterProxy(Vec v_, int i_) {
        v = v_;
        i = i_;
        VecGetArray(v,&amp;ptr_val);
    }
    inline ~SetterProxy(){
        VecRestoreArray(v,&amp;ptr_val);
    }

    inline void operator=(double rhs ){
        ptr_val[i] = rhs;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Although I dont think its coming directly from that. Also initially I had it to return by value and I though changing it to reference would be more efficient. I think this should be safe since the assignment is done in the Proxy operator=() class and after that the proxy class goes out of scope. Either way, that does not save my problem! </p>

It is obvious, the one version working on both system is correct C++, but why does the other works in Windows? Are there more differences in the implementation of valarray?</p>

<p>Example of Code working on MSVC/Windows but not on gcc/Linux:</p>

<pre><code>    valarray&lt;signed short&gt; myValues;
    for(size_t s = 0; s &lt; 10; s++)
    {
        slice dataSlice(1, 1, 1);
        // on Linux, this slice operation gives me a segmentation fault
        myValues= RawData[dataSlice];
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I tracked it down to fix the code like this for the gcc/Linux version:</p>

<pre><code>    for(size_t s = 0; s &lt; 10; s++)
    {
        slice dataSlice(1, 1, 1);
        valarray&lt;signed short&gt; myValues = RawData[dataSlice];
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The gcc/Linux versions expectes the l-value (myValues) is initialized already. This does not seem to be necessary on MSVC/Windows. I could call <code>myValues.resize(1)</code> on Linux and it works as well.</p>

<p>Now, does anyone knows about the differences exactly or a resource on the internet? Are there best practices how to work with the valarray?</p>

<p>Software versions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 7, MS Visual Studio 2010 SP1, Visual C++ Compiler 16.00.40219.01 for 80x86</li>
<li>Lubuntu 14.04 64 Bit on Virtual Machine, GNU Make 3.81, GCC 4.8.2</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Detailed code example.</strong> Does compile. The first example gives segmentation fault in Linux, but works well in Windows.</p>

<pre><code>// This example compiles both on Windows with MSVC and on Linux with GCC.
// It gives a segmentation fault in Linux.
// It gives the expected output on Windows.

#include ""stdafx.h""

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

  //init base data

  std::valarray&lt;signed short&gt; myData(10);
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
  {
    myData[i] = i;
  }

  std::valarray&lt;signed short&gt; myValues;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
  {
    myValues = myData[std::slice(0, i, 1)];
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""myValues: "";

    }

    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The following example works well on Linux and Windows. Note the declaration and therfore initialization of myValues inside the for loop, right where the slicing is done.</p>

<p>So for example that approach returns me a result like this: <code>0.232382</code>
So is it miliseconds? seconds? what is 0.2 ? it is 0.2 milliseconds? </p>

That is the only place in the program that I use endTag, so I can't figure out why it's not getting anything from pop. The only thing I can think of is that it's somehow a pointer issue (my stack elements are void*, if it matters).</p>

The tool-tip content is loaded with the AJAX function in Cluetip. In the loaded content I want to use Javascript to increase usability.</p>

<p><em>index.html:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""edit.png"" title=""Test"" class=""popup"" rel=""ajax-content.html""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>onLoad.js:</em></p>

<pre><code>$('.popup').cluetip({activation: 'click'});
</code></pre>

<p><em>ajax-content.html:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;script language=""javascript"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    alert('Hello world!');
&lt;/script&gt;
Test content.
</code></pre>

<p>The result is a tool-tip appearing on click with the title:'<em>Test</em>', content:'<em>Test content</em>' and <strong>no</strong> alert saying '<em>Hello world!</em>'. FireBug doesn't show the script nor console errors.</p>

<p>Any help on this?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Edit:</em></p>

<p>I figured it out.</p>

<p>Cluetip has a default action on processing ajax:</p>

<pre><code>ajaxProcess: function(data) {
    data = data.replace(/&lt;(script|style|title)[^&lt;]+&lt;\/(script|style|title)&gt;/gm, '').replace(/&lt;(link|meta)[^&gt;]+&gt;/g,'');
    return data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the fix is:</p>

<pre><code>$('.popup').cluetip({
    activation: 'click'.
    ajaxProcess: function(data) {
        return data;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why Cluetip removes all script/style/title, probably to prevent bugs.</p>

<p>I'm writing an part of my app that has no UI. It sits in the background watching what you do and timing your work. </p>

<p>There should be no overlapping times, and there should be no breaks in the time data. If there are either of these things, the app has a bug somewhere and I need to be notified. </p>

<p><strong>What I Want</strong></p>

<p>A class called JGDataIntegrityController that does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Check the data store for duplicate times. Scan since the last Duplicate Report Date stored in NSUserDefaults.</p></li>
<li><p>If duplicate times are found, build a report.</p></li>
<li><p>Send the report. </p>

<p>If the sending isn't successful, then exit. Otherwise continue.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the duplicates</p></li>
<li><p>Update the last Duplicate Report Date in NSUserDefaults</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the above for data breaks.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What I've Got</strong></p>

<p>I've made a base class that does all the hard work of sending the report.</p>

<p><img src=""http://synapticmishap.co.uk/ReportClasses.jpg"" alt=""Class Diagram""></p>

<p>JGReportSender has the following code:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)postReport:(NSString *)report {
    NSMutableDictionary *form = // Dictionary Holding Report;
    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:@""http://postURL"" postForm:form];
    [NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest:request delegate:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Where I'm Getting Stuck</strong></p>

<p>What should I do when the report has been sent?</p>

<p>The delegate methods:</p>

<p><code>-(void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection</code></p>

<p><code>-(void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didFailWithError:(NSError*)error</code></p>

<p>are called when the report has been sent. But how should I communicate with JGDataIntegrityController?</p>

<p><strong>My Crap Idea</strong></p>

<p>My idea is to have a <code>reportStatus</code> NSNumber property in JGReportSender. Then when the delegate methods get called, this is updated. </p>

<p>reportStatus = 1 means ""report sent OK"".</p>

<p>reportStatus = 2 means ""problem sending report"".</p>

<p>Then I could add an observer for reportStatus for JGDataDuplicateReportSender and JGDataBreakReportSender. This would then handle the report sending error or continue on.</p>

<p><strong>Any Good Ideas?</strong></p>

<p>I get the feeling this is a really messy way of doing this. I also feel like I'm overlooking something really obvious. </p>

<p>Any ideas how to do this in a neat way? </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I totally forgot to mention - this will be a 100% opt in feature. It'll be disabled by default. It'll also have 3 levels of privacy - from ""a data break occurred"" through to ""a data break occurred after this application was active with this document path"". And the reports will also be anonymous.</p>

<p>I'm conscious of all the privacy concerns - this is so I can make the software better, not so I can spy on people!</p>

<p>Can anyone provide a starting point? So far I've found out, that I can use a JSON-file as a source for the .autocomplete function, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>    $('#tags').autocomplete({
        source: 'standorte.geojson',
        minLength: 1,
        dataType: 'json'
    });
</code></pre>

<p>I would appreciate any help. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Problem is: I need the plugin to be activated upon every reload of the inner DIV.</p>

<p>Here's my HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""page""&gt;
 &lt;div id=""ajax_container""&gt;

 }); // selectbox
}); // on
</code></pre>

<p>The content now needs mouse movement to convert the selectboxes. I haven't found any other working event. 
Moreover, it takes quite long for the SELECTs to be converted. </p>

<p>How can every loaded AJAX content just show up with the plugins applied?</p>

<p>After some lookup I came across the following method:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a startEvent() and getProgress() in C# code.</li>
<li>Use javascript setTimeout() to call the getProgress() method asynchronously.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Example: <a href=""https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Example/Details/E4244"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Example/Details/E4244</a>)</p>

<p>My remark with this method is that that causes the code to be dependent on the timeout you choose. So it would take some fiddling to find the best and most performant timeout.</p>

<p><br />
Now the method that I would most likely have used before I researched the matter is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>In code behind, create a method handleItem(int index) which takes an index and does everything you want to do with the item at that index.</li>
<li>Determine the number of items you want to handle and pass that to your javascript.</li>
<li>In javascript, initiate a for loop that loops from 0 to the amount - 1, and for each index, it initiates an ajax-call to handleItem(i).</li>
<li>On that ajax-call's complete-statement, you can update the progress bar with the new amount.</li>
</ol>

<p>My questions here are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does this expose too much of the program logic?</li>
<li>Does this create too much overhead seeing as every call goes to the server and back?</li>
<li>Are there any other reasons why I should refrain from using this method?</li>
</ol>

<p>My project contains a Ribbon with some controls, a custom task pane that allows users to search a database via a RESTful interface and a RTD server that lets them put this data in their worksheets. So far, so ... well, painful, I guess: After a lot of struggle with Interop, ComVisibility and AppDomains (what a great idea!), my current status is as follows.</p>

<p>In the worksheets, I call a wrapper function for RTD like this (snipped):</p>

<pre><code>Public Function call(value as String)
    Dim addin as Office.ComAddIn
    Set addin = Application.ComAddIns(""MyAddin"")
    addin.Object.RTD(value)
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>This is (part of) the addin class:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Some
{
   [Guid(""..."")]
   [ComVisibleAttribute(true)]
   [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)]
   public class MyAddin {
      [snip]

      public String RTD(String value)
      {
         String returner = null;
         try
         {

         }
         catch(COMException ce) 
         {
            returner = ce.StackTrace;
         }
         return returner;
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the relevant part of the RTD Server class:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Some 
{
   [Guid(""..."")]
   [ComVisibleAttribute(true)]
   [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)]
   [ProgId(""MyRTDServer"")]

   public class Server : Excel.IRtdServer
   {
      [snip]
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Debug mode I:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a, empty new workbook</li>
<li>Add an ""=RTD(...)"" formula to a cell</li>
<li>Add a wrapper function call ""=call(...)"" to a cell</li>
<li>Save the workbook</li>
<li>Open the workbook</li>
<li>Stop Debugging and start it again</li>
<li>Open the workbook</li>
</ol>

<p>I observe:</p>

<ul>
<li>At 3, everything works fine</li>
<li>At 5, everything works fine</li>
<li>At 7, when recalculating my cells, I get a <code>Unable to get the RTD property of the WorksheetFunction class</code> exception in the cell of 3) and <code>#N/A</code> in the cell of 2). However, I can see that the topics are registered in the RTD server and as soon as the data is available, the exception is replaced with the correct data. Also, if I do <strong>NOT</strong> recalculate the cells, they display the saved value and then correctly update to the retrieved value once the data is available.</li>
</ul>

<p>If in <strong>deployed</strong> mode, I observe:</p>

<ul>
<li>At 2, I get <code>#N/A</code></li>
<li>At 3, I get a <code>Unable to get the RTD property of the WorksheetFunction class</code> exception</li>
</ul>

<p>Any help, please? :(</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Testing the same procedure with a very basic RTD server in a blank Addin project shows exactly the same results: a loaded excel file displays <code>#N/A</code> if an RTD-formula is recalculated before the server has the data available. 
I would like to inquire: WTF?</p>

Each instance of it has a list of database entities as Datasource (such as ""Orders"", ""Items"", ""Customers"" etc). I need a generic approach, that simply returns the primary key of the selected Item, regardless of its type.</p>

<p>I feel like this should be easy, but I have not been able to solve this. I thought it might be possible to just add a function like the following to my custom combobox-class:</p>

<pre><code>public int GetSelectedItemsPrimaryKey()
{
    return (SelectedItem as &lt;&lt;DBEntitiy&gt;&gt;).primaryKey;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it does not. I don't know if there is a basetype of all database entities and if so, whether it exposes it's primary key ...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>More detail: I have a custom control (called CheckedComboBox), that inherits from comboBox (since it will be very similar to a comboBox, just with CheckBoxes as Items). This custom control will therefore have a datasource-field. This field I want to set to a list of database-entries, for example from the table ""Orders"" in the database.</p>

<pre><code>using(var db = new DBEntities())
{
    CheckedComboBox.DataSource = db.Orders.ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>So now I have a bunch of these custom controls, each with a different list of entries from different tables as DataSources.</p>

<p>Now I want to give my control the function <code>GetSelectedItemsPrimaryKey</code> which returns the primary key of the selected item. This is not a problem, if I know, which kinds of items are stored in the DataSource, I could do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>public int GetSelectedItemsPrimaryKey()
{
    return (SelectedItem as Order).OrderPrimaryKey;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I would have to write a function that checks if the selected item is of any type of entry from the database, which is a pain. So I want a generic method, that does the following:</p>

{
    return (SelectedItem as &lt;&lt;DBEntitiy&gt;&gt;).primaryKey;

<p>Now, I have a class smartphone, which has the individual ""x"" which has a data property ""hasCores"" ""4 integer"". </p>

<p>Now I try to automaticly classify it as being a ""fast smartphone"". I tried doing this by making the new class ""fast smartphone"" as being a subclass of ""smartphone"". e.g. (Equivalent to(Smartphone and (hasCores min 2 integer)).</p>

<p>But this doesn't look at the data attribute value, which for this instance is 4, but it looks at the amount of ""hasCores"" properties an individual has. So if i add 2 hasCore property to the indivual it works. But I want just 1 hasCore property, and have the reasoner look at the value of the hasCore property. Is that even possible?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Here's the thing.
I want to have textfields to be read and then the value's I read out of it need to be assigned to a css rule.</p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>    document.getElementById(""BD"").value;
</code></pre>

<p>I want that value that is being read to be assigned to border-radius.</p>

<pre><code>   .style.border-radius:&lt;VALUE&gt;px;
</code></pre>

<p>but how to make that link.</p>

<p>Then If i have 3 divs all of them have seperate names how can I fix that they only assign to the div I selected?</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>[] [] []

Border = thick
Border color = #0F0
Border style = Solid
Which div = 2
Press go
</code></pre>

<p>The values are now being read and then being proccessed into my CSS
So that the 2nd div (div 2) is now adjusted.</p>

<pre><code>[] **[]** []

     ^
     Red and solid

Border       = [textfield empty]
Border color = [textfield empty]
Border style = [textfield empty]
Which div?   = [textfield empty]

<p>All the floating point assembly instructions are in the form ""Fxxx"". Why aren't they in the form ""Vxxx""?  I was expecting to see load instructions that looked like VLD1.32 and add instructions that looked like VADD.F32. When I searched for the instruction ""flds"" in the official ARM documentation it says that ""flds"" was used on the ARM9 architecture, not Cortex-A9.</p>

<p>I have tried every combination of -mcpu, -mfpu, -march compiler flags, but I can't seem to generate floating point assembly instructions in the form ""Vxxx"" using either the GCC compiler for Linux or the Code Sorcery Lite compiler for Linux. What am I doing wrong?</p>

I thought about instead of having a GD intensive operation to create the thumbnail in PHP, can this process actually be off-loaded to the client/browser? Modern browers these days have support for scaling down images rapidly, but I'm sure there are many cons and pros of doing such a task, so my questions are...</p>

<ol>
<li>This would be a more efficient way of doing it, but <strong>how much more efficient</strong> rather than GD operation on server side?</li>
<li>Is there any <strong>Javascript libraries</strong> out there that can <strong>save an image in JPG</strong> format quickly so it can be sent to the server via Ajax?</li>
<li>As a general note, the conversion will be done <strong>using Web Workers</strong>, so not to affect users browser.</li>
<li>Obviously the user can potetionally exploit and send a thumbnail that's completely unrelated to the full size image. Is there any good way around this, i.e. calculating quickly how alike the thumbnail and full size image is and if they are i.e. 98% alike, then allow the image?</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand there are probably better ways of doing it, such as offloading to another server entirely, or doing a batch job at 3am for example, but for academic/informatic purposes, with the advent of modern browser and their improved Javascript engines, can work like this be put on clients browser?</p>

<p>The dialogContent.cfm that is loaded into the dialog window uses plugin.js to add content to DOM.

I've made a model Event that has start and end times and there's a few imporant conditions on these such as a start time cannot be in the past and the end time must be after the start time. </p>

<p>To ensure these validations I'm using ValidatesTimeliness <a href=""https://github.com/adzap/validates_timeliness"">https://github.com/adzap/validates_timeliness</a></p>

<p>My model is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  ...

  validates_datetime :start_date,
    :after =&gt; :now,
    :after_message =&gt; ""Event cannot start in the past""

  validates_datetime :end_date,
    :after =&gt; :start_date,
    :after_message =&gt; ""End time cannot be before start time""
end
</code></pre>

<p>In my RSpec test I have:</p>

<pre><code>describe Event do
  let(:event) { FactoryGirl.build :event }
  subject { event }

  context ""when start_date is before the current time"" do
    it {should_not allow_value(1.day.ago).
        for(:start_date)}
  end

  context ""when end_date is before or on start date"" do
    it {should_not allow_value(event.start_date - 1.day).
        for(:end_date)}

    it {should_not allow_value(event.start_date).
        for(:end_date)}
  end

  context ""when the end_date is after the start_date"" do
    it {should allow_value(event.start_date + 1.day).
        for(:end_date)}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>However this doesn't really test that my start date had to be before the exact date time. 
For example if I'd accidentally used <code>:today</code> instead of <code>:now</code> in my model, these tests would also pass.</p>

<p>I read online that there used to be an RSpec matcher called <code>validate_date</code> (<a href=""http://www.railslodge.com/plugins/1160-validates-timeliness"">http://www.railslodge.com/plugins/1160-validates-timeliness</a>) which would be exactly what I'm looking for but as far as I can tell it's been removed.</p>

<p>My question is how can I improve my tests, do I need to add tests that try the smallest amount of time (i.e. a ms) to ensure the pass/fail accordingly or is there a better way to do it?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

Unfortunately there's not much diagnostic information available here for me to go on - don't even know if a response code was received. Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

More specifically I want to make a MKMapView to update the location, but NOT AFTER USER INTERACTION and tell him to wait a bit. Since every answers I've found was kinda like if it updates it centers the view on user actual position, it works flawless, but as soon as I want to move away from the location it brings me back there. So I want to do something like okay, center the mapview to the current location, but if there was an interaction wait a few seconds and then you should move the view back. Is it possible? </p>

<p>Within an update method on a controller, I'm calling the following:</p>

<pre><code>//note: we're within a constructor's prototype method, hence the 'self'. also body is simply the request body.

    async.waterfall([
        function(callback) {
            self.collection.findById(body._id).exec(function(err, item) {
                if(item) {
                    callback(null, item);
                } else {
                    callback(err);
                }
            });
        },
        function(item, callback) {
            //callback(null, item); //makes this task work, but not what I need

            //merge two together models together, then save
            item.save( _.extend(item, body), function(err, item) {
                console.log('code here never seems to get called within the waterfall');
                callback(null, item);
            });
        }
    ], function(err, results) {
        console.log('hello', err, results);
        self.res.json(results);
    });
</code></pre>

<p>So basically what I'm trying to do is find a document by id, then merge the new object in with the one I just found, save it, and return the result as JSON. But the callback function nested within the .save never seems to get called. So the entire request seems to hang and the final function in the waterfall never gets called. </p>

<p>I might be wrong, but it seems that the save method's callback gets called asynchronously. How would I go about getting this to work?</p>

<p>Side note: If the save method's callback is async, then why does this seem to work? </p>

<pre><code>    var _this = this;
    var item = new this.collection(this.req.body);
    item.save(function(err, data) {
        _this.res.json(data);
    });
</code></pre>

<p>That method returns the saved object as JSON just fine. </p>

In the code shown, the first GetDescription method (the one that takes ClazzA as a parameter) is called.  I think i understand why.<br>
My question is..is there an elegant way of having the method that takes clazzB called first if the underlying object is of type classB (without having to inspect each object and casting it to clazzB)?</p>

<pre><code>public class ClazzA
{
    public virtual string Descr { get { return ""A""; } }

public class ClazzB : ClazzA
{
    public override string Descr { get { return ""B""; } }

        ClazzA test = new ClazzB();
        GetDecription(test);
    }

<p>I really want the 2nd method to be called since 'test' is of type ClassB.  Curerently the only two solutions i have is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>if (test is ClazzB) 
      return GetDescription( (ClazzB) test ); </p></li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<ol>
<li>In ClassA do pretty much the same thing...check the type and delegate to the 2nd method</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these require inspection of the object to determine its type</p>

<p>It has icons set for windows and QMenus.</p>

<p>All client systems have installed python. And PyQt4 is loaded from network location <code>(\\system_xyz\PyQt4)</code>.</p>

<p>The app works fine in developer systems with icons loaded properly.
But when the same script is run on clients, app works but icons are not loaded.</p>

<p>In my app i used Qsql drivers also. It too had the same issue. works at developer system but not at client system.</p>

<p>I could able to overcome this sql driver issue by adding sql plugin path to the app like below</p>

<pre><code>SQLDriverPath = (r'\\system_xyz\PyQt4\plugins\sqldrivers')
QtGui.QApplication.addLibraryPath(SQLDriverPath)
</code></pre>

<p>I came to understand that pyqt4 needs <code>qico4.dll</code> to read .ico files.
so i added the <code>imageformats</code> path to the app. but it did not work.</p>

<pre><code>ImageDriverPath = (r'\\system_xyz\PyQt4\plugins\imageformats')
QtGui.QApplication.addLibraryPath(ImageDriverPath)
</code></pre>

<p>Can any one suggest me a correct approach to solve my issue loading .ico in PyQt app from network</p>

<p><strong>MY UPDATES</strong></p>

<p>i did following to list the supported image formats.</p>

<pre><code>import sys

sys.path.append(r'r'\\system_xyz')

from PyQt4 import QtGui

for imageType in QtGui.QImageReader.supportedImageFormats():
    print imageType
</code></pre>

<p>OUTPUT</p>

<pre><code>bmp
pbm
pgm
png
ppm
xbm
xpm
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to list as above after adding <code>imageformats</code>, The OP is the same
even tried after creating <code>QtGui,QApplication()</code>. Same result no change.</p>

<p>Initially I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>State clonedState = state;
</code></pre>

<p>But then I noticed that the changes I make in ""clonedState"" affects ""state"" as well.</p>

<p>So then I went to search, and found out about deep cloning.
Some people suggested using libraries, others to serialize, then deserialize.</p>

<p>Is there no way of doing this without any of these?</p>

<p>I also tried this, with the same results:</p>

<pre><code>    public static State cloneState(State state){
        int[][] currentBoard = state.getCurrentBoard();
        int[] currentPieces = state.getCurrentPieces();
        int totalPoints = state.getTotalPoints();
        Piece pieceDetail = state.getPieceDetail();
        int acquiredPoints = state.getAcquiredPoints();
        int[] initialList = state.getInitialList();
        int[][] initialBoard = state.getInitialBoard();
        int parentStateID = state.getParentStateID();
        int stateID = state.getStateID();
        State clone = new State(parentStateID, 
            stateID, 
            currentBoard, 
            currentPieces, 
            totalPoints, 
            acquiredPoints, 
            initialList, 
            initialBoard, 
            pieceDetail);
    return clone;
}
</code></pre>

<p>After further reading, I tried using serialization and de-serialization.
So I added this method in my constructor class:</p>

<pre><code>    public State deepCopy() throws Exception{
    //Serialization of object
    ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);
    out.writeObject(this);

    //De-serialization of object
    ByteArrayInputStream bis = new   ByteArrayInputStream(bos.toByteArray());
    ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(bis);
    State clone = (State) in.readObject();
    return clone;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in the main class, I added this:</p>

<pre><code>State clonedState = state.deepCopy();
</code></pre>

<p>Somehow, the results are the same... I modify ""clonedState"", and ""state"" is being modified as well.</p>

<p>I greatly appreciate any help!</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>For reference, here is the method where it happens:</p>

<pre><code>    public static void operateGreen(State state) throws Exception{
    if(getNextPiece(state) == 1){ //Se a proxima peca a colorcar for um +
        int pos = 0;
        System.out.println(""pieces in state: "" + countPiecesList(state));
        while (pos &lt;= 24){//percorrer o tabuleiro
            System.out.println(""Position: "" + pos);
            State clonedState = state.deepCopy();
            System.out.println(""pieces in state: "" + countPiecesList(state));
            System.out.println(""pieces in clonedState: "" + countPiecesList(clonedState));
            if (checkPosPiece(state, pos, -1) == true){ //se o campo estiver vazio
                removePieceFromList(clonedState);
                int points = 0;
                nodes++;
                modifyBoard(clonedState, pos, 1); //atualiza o tabuleiro
                Piece pieceDetail = new Piece(1, pos); //cria nova jogada
                //Verifica se fez figura
                int tempPos = 6;
                boolean figureFound = false;
                while (tempPos &lt;= 18 &amp;&amp; figureFound == false){ //pesquisar se tem algum centro de figura + entre os campos 6 e 18
                    if (checkGreen(clonedState,tempPos)) figureFound = true;
                    tempPos++;
                }
                if (figureFound){
                    points = acquiredPoints(armLength(clonedState, tempPos, 0, 1, 1)*4+1); //calcula o tamanho da figura, para devolver os pontos obtidos
                    clearGreen(clonedState, tempPos);
                }

                setPieceToState(clonedState, pieceDetail);
                setTotalPointsOfState(clonedState, points);
                setStateID(clonedState);
                setParentStateID(state, clonedState);
                addState(clonedState);
            }
            pos++;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Have client_ID, Client_secret, and username, password. </p>

<pre><code>POST: api.XX.com/1/authorize?
      Authorization:Basic [client_id:client_secret] must be base 64 encoded
      Content-Type: application/json
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I get access token without timeout.</p></li>
<li><p>Have app_key</p>

<pre><code>GET https://api.XX.com/authorize?
    response_type=Pin&amp;
    client_id=APP_KEY&amp;
    scope=SCOPE
</code></pre>

<p>After get Pin, register in web application. Then use code to request access token.</p>

<pre><code>POST https://api.XX.com/token?
    grant_type=Pin&amp;
    code=AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN&amp;
    client_id=APP_KEY
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, I have access token and reflesh token. access token will be timeout after 1hr.
So I need to use refresh token application access again.</p>

<p>I just want to say, Even the RESTful doesn't have Standard, access token application methods are big different. I think the first one is better. The first one makes things simple.</p>

<p>Because I just start to call RESTful Web Services, I would ask:
     Are these two authorization methods common way? Is there a third method to get access token? Any comments please. Thanks.</p>

<p>It's hard to tell because it doesn't really tell me at which line everything goes wrong, but I think it happens at </p>

<pre><code>to = new char[garums];

<p>I've tried debugging this line within CodeBlocks, but for some reason when using breakpoints and tracking the variables the applications works fine and executes correctly. It only crashes when running it normally, without debugging...</p>

<p>Also note, that I can't use strings or pretty much any library except fstream and iostream.</p>

<p>EDIT: I tried changing the <code>new char[garums]</code> part to <code>new char[100]</code> and it magically started working. The problem is that I then changed it to <code>new char[10]</code> in which case everything still worked. I even outputted the saved text to the console and it saved everything properly. How could it have saved big words in a char array that is 10 character long (the words I'm testing are longer than 10 characters)? When I changed it to <code>new char[1]</code> however it started crashing again, but again only after the 3rd loop iteration. So it somehow saved the first 2 words in a 1 character long array?</p>

<p>EDIT2: And now it magically started working even with <code>new char[garums]</code>. Something is really wrong here, anyone have any ideas?</p>

I want the coordinates of my PDRectangle objects have the same origin as the coordinates of my TextPosition objects.</p>

<p>I have tried to adjust the Y-coordinates of my PDRectangle by ""page height minus Y-coordinate"".  This gives me the desired result, but it's not elegant.  I want an elegant solution.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>:
Someone has asked a similar question.  The answer is what I tried, which is not the most elegant.

I am using ASP.NET MVC 3, Entity Framework 4.1, MvcScaffolding.</p>

<p>Let's consider the entities:</p>

<p>The user entity:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public int Id
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    public string FirstName
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    public string LastName
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    public virtual ICollection&lt;UserGroup&gt; Groups
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The user group entity:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserGroup
{
    public int Id
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    public string Name
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    public virtual ICollection&lt;User&gt; Users
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, there is the many-to-many relationship between the user and the user group entities.</p>

<p>So, I would like to have the following UI for editing an user group:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LnRjm.png"" alt=""User group editor""></p>

<p>There are two grids:
1. <strong>Users grid</strong> contains current state of the user group which is being edited.
2. <strong>Browse users grid</strong> contains all users (except the users which already belong to the user group). When the user row of this grid is clicked, the user will be moved to the <strong>users grid</strong>. Also, this grid should support paging, filtering and sorting to provide nice user browsing.</p>

<p>So, the user picks users for the user group and then clicks the ""Save"" button. User group controller class should save the changes.</p>

<p>Now the question: how can the functionality be implemented? Is there any good example for the such many-to-many relationship problem?
If there is no simple solution, what UI for the user group management could you advise me to use?</p>

<p>P.S. I am quite novice with ASP.NET, so I don't realize how to implement such dynamic grids.</p>

<p><em>Update 1:</em>
I have looked through the jqGrid examples. <a href=""http://trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>
See Advanced -> Multi Select
There is the problem, the checkboxes' selection is reset when you change the filter. How to store all selected IDs despite the filter change?</p>

I am trying to have multiple forms (individual line items) editable on the fly via AJAX, with a text submission link or some kind of submit button. Problem is, I can get it to submit the form via the AJAX, but without any of the data from the form... i.e. hit submit, it sends the request, but no querystring.  Can someone please help me identify what's missing?</p>

<p>Here is my jquery:</p>

<pre><code>        $('.submitLineChanges').click(function() {
            var formID = $(this).closest('form').attr('ID')
            datastring = $(formID).serialize();
            $.ajax({
                    type:'POST', 
                    url: 'update_ajax.asp', 
                    data: datastring,
                    success: function(response) {
                        alert(""Success "" + id)
                    //$('#ContactForm').find('.form_result').html(response);
                }//end ajax options
            });//end ajax
            return false;
        });//end of click function

<p>As you should be able to tell, I'm running this in ASP. The form is for each line item in a cart basically.  Because of the nature of the page, I don't want to have a separate page to edit all the info.  It seems this should work, but its likely I'm missing something through the tunnel vision I'm in now.</p>

<p>I should note, the form is for each line, I don't need it to submit all the forms, just the one.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have a WCF service somewhere in the cloud, working fine. I am using a PerCall and Single, nothing especially different than a regular wcf. </p>

<p>my problem is the following : </p>

<p>When using a web client (ajax for instance) to send http GET requests, the treatment of the requests doesn't react in the manner I wanted to. Let me explain my point with a short code : </p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
[AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)]
[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerCall, ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Single)]
public class Api
{
    [OperationContract]
    [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = ""api/Function1"", BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.WrappedRequest, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]
    public String Function1()
    {
        logMessage(""Function1 -&gt; Begin on thread "" + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(3000);
        logMessage(""Function1 -&gt; End on thread "" + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        return ""Function1 done"";
    }

    [OperationContract]
    [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = ""api/Function2"", BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.WrappedRequest, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]
    public String Function2()
    {
        logMessage(""Function2 -&gt; Begin on thread "" + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(3000);
        logMessage(""Function2 -&gt; End on thread "" + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        return ""Function2 done"";
    }

    [OperationContract]
    [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = ""api/Function3"", BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.WrappedRequest, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]
    public String Function3()
    {
        logMessage(""Function3 -&gt; Begin on thread "" + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(3000);
        logMessage(""Function3 -&gt; End on thread "" + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        return ""Function3 done"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the client code:</p>

<pre><code>var json1 = new XMLHttpRequest();
json1.open(""GET"", ""127.0.0.1:81/api/Function1"", true);
json1.setRequestHeader(""Accept"", ""*/*"");
json1.onload = function (e) {
  alert(""function1 done"");
}
var json2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
json2.open(""GET"", ""127.0.0.1:81/api/Function2"", true);
json2.setRequestHeader(""Accept"", ""*/*"");
json2.onload = function (e) {
  alert(""function2 done"");
}
var json3 = new XMLHttpRequest();
json3.open(""GET"", ""127.0.0.1:81/api/Function3"", true);
json3.setRequestHeader(""Accept"", ""*/*"");
json3.onload = function (e) {
  alert(""function3 done"");
}
json1.send(NULL);
json2.send(NULL);
json3.send(NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>I have multiples functions in this WCF that I wanted to be treated asynchronously when I call them. Each of those have a 3 seconds thread sleep for the tests. </p>

<p>Because I'm sending my 3 requests asynchronously from my web client, I am supposed to be waiting 3 seconds and receive all the responses at the same time (If it was really asynchronously, as it is supposed to be treated on different threads).</p>

<p>From what I already read on the net, when sending a request to a WCF service, it stored in the session an ID, that will be the same for each http request sended from that same session. If the session is the same, the treatment will be done on the same thread, one request after another one, like a FIFO. To be sure that the problem is because of the session, I tried to send those request from 2 differents browsers (chrome and firefox) at the same time, and it works fine (by fine, I mean that the request are handled on 2 differents threads). Here are the logs of the test for one session: </p>

<pre><code>10:50:00 - Log service - Function1 on thread 9 -&gt; Begin
10:50:03 - Log service - Function1 on thread 9 -&gt; End
10:50:03 - Log service - Function2 on thread 9 -&gt; Begin
10:50:06 - Log service - Function2 on thread 9 -&gt; End
10:50:06 - Log service - Function3 on thread 9 -&gt; Begin
10:50:09 - Log service - Function3 on thread 9 -&gt; End
</code></pre>

<p>And here are the logs for 2 sessions at the same time :</p>

<pre><code>10:50:00 - Log service - Function 1 on thread 9 -&gt; Begin
10:50:00 - Log service - Function 1 on thread 10 -&gt; Begin
10:50:03 - Log service - Function 1 on thread 9 -&gt; End
10:50:03 - Log service - Function 1 on thread 10 -&gt; End

10:50:03 - Log service - Function 2 on thread 9 -&gt; Begin
10:50:03 - Log service - Function 2 on thread 10 -&gt; Begin
10:50:06 - Log service - Function 2 on thread 9 -&gt; End
10:50:06 - Log service - Function 2 on thread 10 -&gt; End

10:50:06 - Log service - Function 3 on thread 9 -&gt; Begin
10:50:06 - Log service - Function 3 on thread 10 -&gt; Begin
10:50:09 - Log service - Function 3 on thread 9 -&gt; End
10:50:09 - Log service - Function 3 on thread 10 -&gt; End
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what I'm waiting for one session : </p>

<pre><code>    10:50:00 - Log service - Function 1 on thread 9 -&gt; Begin
    10:50:00 - Log service - Function 2 on thread 10 -&gt; Begin
    10:50:00 - Log service - Function 3 on thread 11 -&gt; Begin

    10:50:03 - Log service - Function 1 on thread 9 -&gt; End
    10:50:03 - Log service - Function 2 on thread 10 -&gt; End
    10:50:03 - Log service - Function 3 on thread 11 -&gt; End
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas to solve that issue without disable session? I hope I'm clear enought to everyone, thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>I used a backtracking algorithm but I only backtrack when I see last letter of word, and backtrack again when see the letter which is right-most of it in word. </p>

<p>I use a matrix of counter for count frequency of letter.</p>

<p>Can that problem be solved by dynamic programming algorithm?</p>

<p>Or any better idea?</p>

This would be easy if I could bump the .NET version, but for now it <strong>must</strong> remain a .NET 2.0 application.  Again, this would be relatively easy, except the VS2005 project is referencing some .NET 3.0 DLLs, such as System.ServiceModel.</p>

<p>This referencing of a .NET 3.0 dll works just fine in VS2005, since (as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/4155344/298754"">this answer says</a>: <code>.net 3.0 = .net 2.0 + WCF+WPF+WF</code>).  However, I can't figure out how to teach VS2010 that this is a working combination.</p>

<p><em>Specifically</em>, the .NET 3.0 assemblies don't show up in the dialog for adding references, and manually adding them (via ""Browse""), while it lets <em>that</em> project build correctly, keeps that project from being referenced by any other.  When I try to build a dependent project, it generates an error: <code>warning MSB3268: The primary reference ""{{MyProject}}.dll"" could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the framework assembly ""System.ServiceModel, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"" which could not be resolved in the currently targeted framework.

<p>Now, <code>wand</code> and <code>hat</code> are MATLAB packages which may be loaded by <code>import wand.*</code> and <code>import hat.*</code>.</p>

<p>Consider that I may want to create an abstract class for hat inside the <code>+hat</code> folder:</p>

<p>I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Error using hat.TopHat
The specified superclass 'Hat' contains a parse error or cannot be found

<p>Nevertheless, I can do <code>ha = Hat()</code> with no error.</p>

<p>What is possibly happening and what is the best solution to this issue?</p>

As you can it doesn't return anything which is ok but it expects a directoryInfo object everytime it is recalled.</p>

<pre><code>    private void getSizeForTargetDirectory(DirectoryInfo dtar)
    { 
        // generate a collection of objects. files comes first and then directories.

        foreach (Object item in collection )
        {
            if (item == file)
            {
               track the size of the files as you encounter.
            }
            else if (item == directory)
            {
                // found a new directory, recall the method. !!!
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is my first time using a background worker so I'm a little stuck, I tried implementing something thanks to the help found here but got stuck when I realised my method was recursive. </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1194620/c-newbie-show-progress-during-a-loop-wpf"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1194620/c-newbie-show-progress-during-a-loop-wpf</a></p>

<p>I implemented a doWork event handler method but noticed that i needed to somehow recall the method if I had more files and folders to process on lower sub levels. </p>

<p>I have a simple button click event handler that calls my 'getSizeForTargetDirectory()' method when the current selected node is a directory.</p>

<pre><code> private void retrieveInfoButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // check to see if the path is valid
        // reset the labels and textfields.
        string fullPath = treeDrives.SelectedNode.FullPath;
        string sNodesName = treeDrives.SelectedNode.Text;

        if (directory) // Enter here if its a directory.
        {
            string parentPath = treeDrives.SelectedNode.Parent.FullPath;
            DirectoryInfo[] dirArray = populateFoldersArray(parentPath);

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; dirArray.Length; i++)
            {
                if (dirArray[i].Name == sNodesName)
                {
                    getSizeForTargetDirectory(dirArray[i]);

                    // do work !
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully that explains what I am trying to do and how I am doing it. Question is how can i use the report progress feature of the background worker class when the bulk of the work I am trying to ship is coming from a recursive method.</p>

<p>Through early testing I noticed that my getSize method was incredibly efficient after a few tweaks and reported size information for the current supplied folder very quickley but then again I use quite a powerful dev machine so this may not be true for all users.</p>

<p>Thanks For Reading, Hope someone can help !!!</p>

<p>I've tested it with a few outputs and I haven't found anything wrong with it.</p>

<p>The standard library partition function is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class BidirectionalIterator, class UnaryPredicate&gt;
  BidirectionalIterator partition (BidirectionalIterator first,
                                   BidirectionalIterator last, UnaryPredicate pred)

    } while (!pred(*last));
    swap (*first,*last);
    ++first;
  }
  return first;
}

<p>The latter seems much more complicated and has nested loops. Is there something wrong with my version? If not why the more complicated version?</p>

I mean, the single variable output is documented, but not two-variable output. I see no documentation in MATLAB or on undocumented matlab, or <em>even here</em>. Maybe I missed it?</p>

<p>If I call it with a matlab class, <code>char</code> for example</p>

<pre><code>[a b] = methods(char); 
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>a</code> is the list of methods for char, and <code>b</code> is <code>[]</code></p>

<p>BUT... </p>

<p>For a java class, <code>b</code> takes on some useful values.  Assume that <code>javaClass</code> is a java class or java class name.</p>

<p>Typically, I would either call <code>a = method(javaClass)</code> or <code>a = method(javaClass,'-full')</code>.  However, I noticed that I can ALSO call</p>

<p><code>[a b] = method(javaClass)</code></p>

<p>When I do:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>a</code> is a cell containing a unique list of all the classes method names.  (as expected)</li>
<li><code>b</code> is a N x 6 cell of strings with each column representing:
<ol>
<li><code>'static'</code> if static, <code>[]</code> otherwise</li>
<li>fully qualified return class</li>
<li>method name</li>
<li>fully qualified method name</li>
<li>Input parameters (in parenthesis), or just <code>()</code></li>
<li>'throws <em>fully.qualified.exception.name</em>', or <code>[]</code></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>[a b] = method(java.lang.Integer);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, <code>a</code> is a &lt;32x1 cell> containing simple names, such as <code>'Integer'</code>, <code>'bitCount'</code>, etc.</p>

<p>But, <code>b</code> is a &lt;43x6 cell> containing each variation of each function.  For example, one of the valueOf functions would show</p>

<pre><code>COL  VALUE
1.   static
2.   java.lang.Integer
3.   valueOf
4.   java.lang.Integer.valueOf
5.   (java.lang.String)
6.   throws java.lang.NumberFormatException`
</code></pre>

<h3>So, here are my question(s):</h3>

<p>Main question: Is this entirely unsafe to use?  Because it's undocumented, I'll assume so; however it provides me with some built-in functionality that would be nice to not have to duplicate.  The work-around for parsing isn't odious, but this functionality is already here.</p>

<p>Where does this come from?  That is, Is this actually from the MATLAB function, or is there some Java function that it is using?</p>

<p>Does anyone use it? Or (as in Main question) should it just be avoided?</p>

<p>IS there documentation on this? Beyond this post I mean.  I mean, sure, it appears to be a straight forward function....  And  is this even interesting enough to anyone that it would matter?</p>

<p>I'm on MATLAB 2011b, does this functionality still exist in later versions of MATLAB ( 2013a )?</p>

<p>The following code should compare a synchronized version of summing numbers with an async version. The thing is that I'm seeing a performance increase (it's not caching, it happens even when I split the code into two separate programs), while still observing the program as single-threaded (only one core is used).</p>

<p><code>strace</code> does show some thread activity, but monitoring tools like <code>top</code> clones still show only one used core.</p>

"21273595","1","21275267","","2014-01-22 03:25:32","","4","999","<p>After 20 years of professional development, I still find myself feeling completely clueless when it comes to certain aspects of database performance. This is one of those times. There are thousands of questions here and elsewhere regarding table and index fragmentation and its effect on performance. I know the basic do's and don'ts, but there are times when it seems there is no ""good"" answer. Here's my problem, and I run across it fairly often:</p>

<p>A table is used only to store id pairs that define one-to-many relationships, let's use an example of friends. A Friends table contains only <strong>personId (int), friendId (int)</strong>. Each pair is of course unique. (And consequently, but probably irrelevant to the question, the inverse pair to each relationship is also present.) So a very small sample of the data would be:</p>

<pre><code>1001, 1011
1001, 1012
1001, 1013
1011, 1001
1012, 1001
1013, 1001
etc...
</code></pre>

<p>Person 1001 has 3 friends, and of course each of those friends has person 1001 as a friend, etc. This table would potentially have millions, even as much as hundreds of millions, of relationships (rows), any given person would be likely to have in the neighborhood of hundreds of friends. And they would be inserted and updated (actually in this case some existing ones deleted, new ones added, no actual row updates) frequently, and in no specific order. For any given batch of inserts, they could be ordered by <strong>personId, friendId</strong>, but beyond that, inserts would largely be unordered over time.</p>

<p>The usage then of this table would be to query all friends of a given person, or inner join to a query of people to group and aggregate additional data relating to each person's friends, etc., the typical uses you would expect for a table of one-to-many relationships. Query performance would probably be more critical than insert performance, but both would be important, as both would be occurring frequently. Example query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.Name FROM Friends f
INNER JOIN People p ON f.friendId = p.id
WHERE f.personId = @personId
</code></pre>

<p>In the past, without even thinking twice, I would give the table a composite primary key of <strong>personId, friendId</strong>, which in SQL Server would by default be created as a clustered index, and be done with it. But I've never dealt with such large and performance-critical data as this before, so I'm questioning this decision. I don't see any way in which a table like this could be structured in a way that didn't result in significant and frequent fragmentation. My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a better way to structure this data?</p></li>
<li><p>Considering that the two int columns of the clustered index represent the only data in the table, is fragmentation likely to be as bad as I am assuming, and if so, will the fragmentation under these conditions result in as significant a performance hit as I'm assuming?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(Unless there is some radically different concept in RDBMS I'm not familiar with, I'm assuming the answer to the first question is no. So it's mainly the second question I'm hoping someone has a good base of experience to answer from. BTW, the database is SQL Azure if that makes a difference.)</p>

<p>Thanks, to those DBA gurus among you who have some insight to offer!</p>

Since this is going to be a real-time chat (long polled) system for file sharing on the fly, I realized after a bit of digging around that Erlang would be the most appropriate choice, because of high concurrency, plus people also suggested to use Yaws since it can handle upto 50k parallel connections.</p>

<p>Although, it sounds awesome, but since I am a newbie (both to erlang and comet applications), I am unable to understand the right technology stack / architecture of how this would work. Also, because of relatively less documentation, I am unable to figure out how the individual pieces would fit together (web server, application layer, DB, message queue) for such an application. The application is going to run off a desktop client only (no web presence required), and so we need to build a REST api for the functionalities.</p>

<p>It would be great, if someone could point me in the right direction to proceed.</p>

<p>I want to select an element from L according to its score in S, simply by generating a sort of cumulative probability distribution, where each element <code>L[i]</code> corresponds to an interval in <code>(0,1]</code> proportional to <code>S[i]</code>. Then, a random number drawn in (0,1] maps to the selected element.</p>

<p>For the example given before, we can have the scores of <code>S</code> represented as probabilities by normalizing on <code>5+1+4</code> so we get <code>SS = [0.5, 0.1, 0.4]</code>, and we map the elements of <code>L</code> to intervals, such that:</p>

<pre><code>B is mapped to (0, 0.1]
C is mapped to (0.1, 0.1+0.4]
A is mapped to (0.1+0.4, 0.5+0.5]
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I generate a random number <code>r</code> in (0,1] (e.g. <code>r = random.random()</code>), it will map to the corresponding element. For example if <code>r = 0.03</code> we know that the element is B. And for instance, if <code>r = 0.73</code> we know that the element is A ...</p>

<p>Is there a simple way in python to do this mapping between an element and an interval ?</p>

<p>I know that I can use <code>numpy.cumsum</code> to generate the cumulative sum of SS, but how to map elements to intervals obtained from this cumulative sum ?</p>

<p>I know it needs to be displayed in decimal format until the number is sufficiently large, and at that point it needs to be shown in scientific notation. Therefore I thought <code>%g</code> was the right specifier. But it doesn't match the built-in calculator for the same calculation.</p>

<p><code>[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%g"", calcResult] //where calcResult is a double</code></p>

<p>Some examples:<br>
123456.7 * 1 should display as 123456.7 but it is displayed as 123457 (puzzling!)<br>
123456789 * 1 should display as 123456789 but it's displayed as 1.23457e+08<br>
123456789 * 123456789 should display as 1.524158e+16 but it's displayed as 1.52416e+16</p>

<p>Also, how does one get the comma (or period depending on locale) to appear in the result? Are there additional specifiers one can use to get the exact format the iOS Calculator shows?</p>

<pre><code>CREATE table main(
 id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
 main_id INT NOT NULL,
 feature1 INT NOT NULL,
 feature2 INT NOT NULL,
 feature3 INT NOT NULL,
 time_repetition TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
 rating SMALLINT NOT NULL,
 PRIMARY KEY (id),
 INDEX search(range_col1,range_col2,range_col3)
 ) engine=innodb;
</code></pre>

<p>POINT 1: 
<code>feature*</code> fields are some characteristics. So, during the search user can check that he wants rows from table, which satisfy several values, thus I need to use <code>IN</code> in <code>WHERE</code>: <br><code>feature1 IN (val1,val2,..) and feature2 IN (val1,val2,..) and feature3 IN (val1,val2,...)</code>.</p>

<p>POINT2: the table is denormalized according to repetition of time. Thus, I need to have <code>GROUP_CONCAT(time_repetition)</code> in select and <code>GROUP BY main_id</code>. </p>

<p>POINT3: The best value rating are desirable first. So, I need to have <code>ORDER BY rating DESC</code>.I also considered the recalculation of rating once a day and insert data into a table according to sequentially decreasing rating. In this case I need to have <code>ORDER BY id</code>. Unfortunately, it does not solve the problem.</p>

<p>SO, the whole query is:
<code>SELECT
main_id, feature1, feature2, feature3, GROUP_CONCAT(time_repetition), rating 
FROM main WHERE feature1 IN (val1,val2,..) and feature2 IN (val1,val2,..) and feature3 IN (val1,val2,...) GROUP BY main_id ORDER BY rating LIMIT 50</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that query uses temporary and filesort in average to 5K rows. For example, below is the result of explain:</p>

<pre><code>explain(select SQL_NO_CACHE * from main where feature1 in (4,5,6,7)
and feature2 IN (2,3,4,5) and feature3 IN (1,2,3,4,5) group by main_id
order by id limit 10);

for example the string ABCDEFGH gors into array as</p>

<p>The first thing I had was a hide and show with javascript. On each input the form checks if the input is empty using the <code>oninput</code> event. I want this also with jQuery. The code below contains my current javascript code which I wrote for now.</p>

<pre><code>var inputFields = [firstname, lastname, age, job, avatar, message];
function CheckEmptyValues() {
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; inputFields.length; i++) {
        if (inputFields[i].value !== '') {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
;
//shows preview by input a value
prevPost.style.display = 'none';
function showPreview() {
    switch (CheckEmptyValues()) {
        case false:
            this.prevPost.style.display = ""block"";
            break;
        case true:
            this.prevPost.style.display = ""none"";
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The next thing I would do is adding some fancy slide effects and for that I am using jQuery.</p>

<p>The problem is that I am not familiar with the language and don't know how to write the same functions.</p>

<p>What I already have is this:</p>

<pre><code>$('form').on('keyup change', 'input, textarea', function () {
                    if ($(this).val().length &gt; 0) {
                        $(""#prevPost"").slideDown();
                    }
                    else {
                        $(""#prevPost"").slideUp();
                    }
                });
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this function is that it just checks one inputfield, not if at least one is filled. If the second inputfield is empty it goes to the else block</p>

<p>Just for a better view of the code I added the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""inputForm"" autocomplete=""off""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""firstname"" maxlength=""20"" placeholder=""Firstname"" REQUIRED/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""lastname"" maxlength=""20"" placeholder=""Lastname"" REQUIRED/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""number"" id=""age"" min=""1"" max=""110"" placeholder=""Age"" REQUIRED/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""job"" maxlength=""20"" placeholder=""Job"" REQUIRED/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""avatar"" placeholder=""Avatar url"" /&gt;
    &lt;div id=""richTextEditor""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""button"" id=""bold"" class=""editBtn"" value=""B""/&gt;                                    
        &lt;input type=""button"" id=""italic"" class=""editBtn"" value=""I""/&gt;  
        &lt;input type=""button"" id=""underline"" class=""editBtn"" value=""U""/&gt;    
        &lt;input type=""button"" id=""strike"" class=""editBtn"" value=""S""/&gt;    
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;textarea id=""message"" placeholder=""Typ your text here"" REQUIRED&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" id=""button"" class=""button"" value=""Add new post""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;article id=""prevPost""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""prevContainer""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""prevPostHeader""&gt;
            &lt;span id=""prevHeadertag""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=""left""&gt;
            &lt;img id=""prevAvatar"" src=""images/placeholder.jpg"" alt=""Avatar""/&gt;
            &lt;p id=""prevProfile""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=""right""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""text""&gt;
                &lt;p id=""prevOutput""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;

I have an emulator, that assembles a message in various protocols (some fix/ some non fix).
opens a tcp connection to a server and sends these messages over.
I am considering assembling the fix message using quickfix.
I don't want to use the client portion of quickfix, just the part which assembles a fix message. 
Can this be done? ie: does the api support getting the raw fix(which can then be sent over tcp connection) from Message format.</p>

We have implemented a php function which uses shell_exec to execute a small c++ program and read the output.  While testing on my local, I have had no problems.  However, on our actual server, there is a big problem.</p>

<p>Every time I invoke the ajax request which invokes the php function that calls shell_exec, I get a good response, but afterwards I can no longer make successful ajax calls to that php file.  I have tested this on different browsers and different computers and the behavior persists every time.  </p>

<p>If I delete my cookies, I can reconnect to the php file.  </p>

<p>I have inspected the network connections with chrome developer tools and there is nothing telling given.  I receive a good response from the ajax request that invokes shell_exec.  But afterwards, its blocked.  I get a failed to connect error - but only on the device/session that invoked that function.  If I open a different browser, it will still connect.</p>

<p>I have googled php session blocking, but I do not understand how this could be the problem.  This is a simple ajax request, and only one at a time is being made.  Moreover, I have invoked other ajax request several times to reproduce the behavior and I cannot.  The only time this happens is when I invoke the php function that invokes shell_exec.</p>

<p>If something went wrong with shell_exec, I wouldn't expect a good response back, but I am getting a good response.</p>

<p>I know this is vague, but its a big problem and I have no ideas how to debug such a problem.  Any ideas on what is going on or how I can debug this?</p>

<p>Example code:</p>

<pre><code>function applyForCreditCards() {
  if (!creditCardAppForm.isValid()) return;
    $.ajax({
      type: 'POST',
      url: '../troystest/MobileServices/MobileValidationService.php',
      data: { 
          'action': 'applyForCreditCard',
          'ssn' : ssn, 
          ... more variables...
          'creditCardIds' : selectedCreditCards
      },
      success: function(msg){
        results = JSON.parse(msg);
        // Do something with response
        });
      }
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example server side code</p>

<pre><code>if (!$_SESSION)
    session_start();
switch($_POST['action'] {
    case 'applyForCreditCard': $this-&gt;applyForCreditCards($vars...);
              break;
}

applyForCreditCards($vars...) {
    $output = explode(""\n"", shell_exec($pathToExec."" "".$commandLineArgs));
    echo json_encode($output);
    exit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The real code is really long, I tried to include relevant parts.  The c++ program is small and spits out 10 or so lines of output to std out.</p>

<p>Related to my earlier questions about <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/9943/sp3-installed-vs-sp3-slipstreamed-difference-in-default-security-settings"">Slipstreamed SP3 vs. patched SP3</a>, we've come to the conclusion that there is an Internet Explorer process being started, instructed to load a simple .html file from the local disk, which contains javascript, which opens up the rest of a larger chat/meeting system. Internet Explorer is started from a Lotus Notes client.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all we can see is the IExplore.exe process popping up in Task Manager, and some seconds later, disappear again.</p>

<p>If we try to open the local .html file, which we've found on disk, it gives us that information bar at the top, telling us that it has disabled active content. This, however, is not the real problem. We have another machine that has the same settings but where everything works, and loading the .html file manually gives us the same error there as well.</p>

<p>However, perhaps there is another error message being shown when IExplore is started from notes, but since this process is supposed to just kickstart the rest of the system, and this window is hidden, we can't see it, that is, the error message / problem.</p>

<p>So, I thought, perhaps I should try creating a small program that waits for IExplore.exe to start, then immediately shows the window, so that we can see the error message, or whatever the problem is. At least, hopefully we'll be able to see that.</p>

<p>So far so good, except that if I start a process from my own program, with a hidden window, the main window handle is 0, and thus I cannot show the window after all. I expect this IExplore.exe process started from Lotus Notes to have the same issue.</p>

<p>My monitoring program is written in C#, and basically runs this loop:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var process in Process.GetProcesses())
{
    if (process.ProcessName.ToLower() == ""iexplore"")
        result.Add(process);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This picks up all the IExplore.exe processes, windows or not, and with IE8, I get 2 processes for the first window, as expected. I run this over and over again, and handles the differences from the previous runs.</p>

<p>However, the process briefly has a window handle 0 at the start, so I changed it to this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var process in Process.GetProcesses())
{
    if (process.ProcessName.ToLower() == ""iexplore"" &amp;&amp;
        process.MainWindowHandle != IntPtr.Zero)
    {
        result.Add(process);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but now it doesn't pick up anything at all, even after the window has gotten a handle (and yes, process.MainWindowHandle does have a non-zero handle value after the window has been shown, but in the case where the window is never shown, it stays at 0.)</p>

<p>So, the question is: Is there any way for me to take this hidden IExplore.exe process, and instruct it to show itself, when it doesn't have a window handle already? I doubt it, but perhaps someone can prove me wrong.</p>

<p>If not, my backup plan is to create a shim IExplore.exe program, that forwards all command line arguments to the original one, except that it specifies that the window is to be shown. Would this be a solution?</p>

<p>Lets say I have a window with a width around 500px.
Inside my document, I have an outer div with no specified width, but the following css:</p>

<pre><code>.outer{
  white-space:nowrap;
  background:blue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside this div are 3 other div that have the following properties:</p>

<pre><code>.t1{
  display:inline-block;
  width:400px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(notice the width of <code>400px</code>. That's where the problem is, the line is wider than the window, and the outer div does not extend.
The HTML looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""outer""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""t1""&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""t1""&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""t1""&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve is to have the 3 inner div with a blue background, without setting it for the <code>t1</code> class. What this example will produce is a blue background limited to the width of the window.</p>

<p>See full example here : <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/sjCTR/"">http://jsfiddle.net/sjCTR/</a> (you'll have to adapt the bottom left corner if your screen is to large)</p>

<p>I'm wondering if somehow that could be achieved thru css/html only, without setting the outer div width/the inner div background?</p>

<p><strong>How can <a href=""http://asa.aip.org/classroom/curves.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> graph be made in visual studio that allows for it to be re-sized in a non web based application?</strong> I have tried with WPF applications previously. At the current time the graph that is made is static and all points are plotted based on where it is in the window.</p>

<p>Issues that I can not seem to address:</p>

<ul>
<li>X axis is not constant and I can not set variables appropriately</li>
<li>There are many labels for NC and no program I found allows for multiple label classes ie NC labels are labeled separately from measurements(squares and lines in link pic)</li>
<li>Graph does not grow when making window bigger because it is drawn for each individual line not in graph formatting language</li>
</ul>

Library
Tests
GUI</p>

<p>The tests only hit the library.  This is a BB project with the type set to ""library""
All my tests seem to be working and hitting the code.  If I debug the tests using JUnit, I can step in to a function in my library,  view my variables and all the normal debugging goodness.</p>

<p>I created the GUI and included the library in the Required Projects build path.  </p>

<p>The problem I have is trying to debug the library via the GUI on the simulator.  When I debug the application I can find my App easily enough.  Right now it's a single button that makes a simple call into the library.</p>

<p>For example, something like:</p>

<pre><code>FieldChangeListener checkListener = new FieldChangeListener() { public void fieldChanged(Field field, int context) {
LibraryClass lc = new LibraryClass();
Dialog.Alert(""Class loaded"");
}};
</code></pre>

<p>If I put a break point on the LibraryClass lc = new LibraryClass() Eclipse will break in on the button press.</p>

<p>If I step over this method nothing happens.  The code never advances to the Dialog.Alert() line.</p>

<p>If I try to step into the constructor and see what's hanging it up in there, nothing happens.  Eclipse never steps in.</p>

<p>At first I thought maybe this was some kind of timing issue where the GUI thread needed to do something and so my library call got lost.  </p>

<p>I've tried creating a class that implements Runnable so that I can call a ThreadClass.Run() and have THAT class fire up the library calls.  But it behaves the same.</p>

<p>There are no exceptions thrown, it just seems as if it walked off the end of the Earth.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea or seen anything like this?  Is it a configuration issue on the simulator where it's not including the library? Did I miss something obvious?</p>

I have a web page that has a log in and is loading after the log in, in about 10 secs (maybe a bit more). This web page is loading really slow because in a section of the page, it has a tree which is loaded from multiple queries to the server. Discarding the optimization of the queries, what I want to do is, load the page but without loading the tree. Rather than loading the tree, load a spinning wheel to symbolize that its loading. When the document ready event is triggered, start loading the tree. I want to know a procedure ( if there is one ) or if it is as simple as sticking the tree in the document ready function. Thank you </p>

<p>when trying to run the <a href=""https://github.com/esheri3/OWASP-CSRFGuard/tree/master/Owasp.CsrfGuard.Test"" rel=""nofollow"">0wasp.CsrfGuard.Test</a> example app on Tomcat 5.5?</p>

<p>I'm using the example app exactly as it came in the download but with the following changes to get around <code>listener</code> errors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I downloaded the CsrfGuard 3.0.0 package and copied the <code>Owasp.CsrfGuard.jar</code> to <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> to get around the listeners not being found.  </p></li>
<li><p>I changed the web.xml file to use the listener that comes with the <code>Owasp.CsrfGuard.jar</code> rather than the two listeners in the original <code>web.xml</code>, which don't exist.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>When I start the app there are no errors but when I point my browser to the <code>/Owasp.CsrfGuard.Test/index.html</code> page, I get the above error.  </p>

<p>Any ideas to try?  </p>

<p>Update...</p>

<p>Several hours later and I got it working without error.  I don't understand why but the filter errors seem to stick around even after stopping and restarting a webapp (in Tomcat at least).  I had to rename that webapp's directory, wait 10 seconds for Tomcat to auto-undeploy it, rename it back to its original directory name, and wait 10 seconds for Tomcat to recognize it as a new webapp.  I also removed the ""x-requested-with"" init-param from the web.xml file since I don't use AJAX.  Don't know if that really needed to come out but it works so I'm leaving it out.</p>

<p>Now, the ""protect.html"" file is indeed protected but it is protected too well.  I can't get to it at all.  If I try to go directly to the protect.html page, it should not allow that, which it doesn't.  However, it should allow me to get there through the proper webpage flow with all the pages getting the proper token(s).</p>

<p>The question now is how can I get to the protect.html page?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

Consider this code:</p>

<pre><code>class Base
{
public:
virtual void Method() = 0;
};

class Derived :  public Base
{
public:
~Derived()
{
    Method();
}

virtual void Method()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""D"";
}
};

class DoubleD : public Derived
{
public:

~DoubleD()
{
    Method();
}

virtual void Method()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""DD"";
}
};

int main(array&lt;System::String ^&gt; ^args)
{
    DoubleD D;
    DoubleD E;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, as the object gets destructed, it calls the correct method (eg first the most derived and then the the second most derived).</p>

<p>Ouput: DD D</p>

<p>My question is, why does this work? Since you are not meant to call virtual functions in a c'tor/d'tor, why does the virtual table ""unwind"" correctly. </p>

<p>Eg, I can see why the most derived one works, that was the state the virtual function pointer table was in when this started. But why, when <code>Derived</code>'s destructor is called, does the table get correctly set to point at that classes implementation of <code>Method</code>.</p>

<p>Why not just leave it, or if it is being nice, set the value to NULL. </p>

When i run the Browser on my WP8 (Nokia Lumia 920) and type in the IP of my Computer the App runs at solid 60 FPS. Everything is smooth and fine. 
I tryied to install the App on my Phone using the ""Windows Phone-HTML5-App"" template given from Visual Studio 2013. Now the application runs on my phone but at 40-50 FPS and is very choppy.
To my mind the App runs in the same Browser. Why there is such a big difference in performance?</p>

<p>Thank You!</p>

<p>Edit:
I changed the MainPage.xaml file. The app was soposed to run in landscape  mode. Now I tried the portraid mode. And everything runs fine at solid 59 FPS. I think the only one who can explain this is the one who wrode the browser! I changed the X and Y axis inside of my camera class.</p>

<p>Now i need to search this into <code>10*10 matrix containing 0s and 1s</code>.Closest and only solution i can get it brute force algorithm of O(n^4).In languages like MATLAB and R there are very subtle ways to do this but not in C,C++. I tried a lot to search this solution on Google and on SO.But closest i can get is this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1975386/fast-counting-of-2d-sub-matrices-withing-a-large-dense-2d-matrix"">SO POST</a> which discuss about implementing <strong>Rabin-Karp string-search algorithm</strong> .But there is no pseudocode or any post explaining this.Could anyone help or provide any link,pdf or some logic to simplify this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>as Eugene Sh. commented that If N is the size of the large matrix(NxN) and k - the small one (kxk), the buteforce algorithm should take O((Nk)^2). Since k is fixed, it is reducing to O(N^2).Yes absolutely right.
But is there is any generalised way if N and K is big?</p>

<ol>
<li>PSQL</li>
<li>Mongo Config server</li>
<li>Mongo shards</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>Celery Workers</li>
<li>Python processing node</li>
<li>So on..</li>
</ol>

<p>The UI nodes are under auto scaling of AWS, and cannot be run on any other nodes. We can configure one or more components on a node by some CLI commands that we have built. Just to you an idea, we have commands like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off/on Redis</li>
<li>Turn off/on PSQL</li>
<li>Add another shard (can be done only if shard is running on this node)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>So each CLI command's execution depends on the components installed on that node. Moreover, each CLI command's interaction is different, some take just one parameter, some may need a lot more. Now as the cluster grows in size, there is a requirement to centrally execute these commands somehow. I think this can probably be done as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build a tab specifically for super user admin, where he can see all nodes, and after selecting one of the nodes, he can select on all the possible CLI commands</li>
<li>Depending on CLI command, an Expect script should be made to run on that node</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I know this is all quite messy, I was hoping to know if there's a simple utility/framework which kind of helps simplify all this, if possible?</p>

<p>I know it could be a device cache problem, but I would like to not delete App Data from the device, cause I have informations there and I would lose time if I restore them. Is there any other solution? And why it does this?</p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restarting Android Studio</li>
<li>Restarting PC</li>
<li>Restarting Device</li>
<li>Sync Project</li>
<li>Rebuild Project</li>
</ul>

<p>[Sorry I cannot post code, but I don't see how it could be helpful: I deleted it from the project, so I don't think the problem could be there]</p>

Currently I can't get IRB working to parse these pieces of code (I'm not sure how to <code>require 'csv'</code> in IRB) so I don't have any particular error message. My expectations for this will be to create an array (CSV_Total) that has a header with no symbols in it. The next step is to put that array back into a new file.

<li>Another solution with:

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I want to build the first solution and then use the resulting dlls in the C# Unit tests. Later on the C++/CLI will be used in several projects, so I am creating Tests to verify the functionality.</p>

<p>When I created the C++/CLI projected, It created Class1 by default. I didn't delete this class yet, but I created a wrapper for one of the C++ Classes.</p>

<p>When I add this dll to the C# project, the Class1 is visible (I even added a test method and it works), but I can access the Wrapper Class I created.</p>

<p>My C++/CLI project name is:</p>

<ul>
<li>MyNamespace.SubNamespace.Managed.MyProject</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Class1 Code (C++/CLI)</strong></p>

<pre><code> #pragma once

using namespace System;

namespace MyNamespaceSubNamespaceManagedMyProject
{
public ref class Class1
    {
    public:
                //I used this method to see if the values were going back and forth, and they do
        int TestMethod(int value){return value;}
    };

}

<p><strong>Class1</strong> works just fine, but I try to do <strong>new MyManagedWrapper()</strong> and It doesn't work. I tried using the fullnamespace too but it is like the class and the namespace doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Então, no site eu preciso que as pessoas possam fazer certas perguntas (nas áreas de matemática e física, mas ela precisa entrar de maneira simples (e mais visual ou via atalhos) com as integrais, derivadas, somatórios e símbolos matemáticos de modo geral.</p>

"20826298","1","","","2013-12-29 14:43:22","","0","286","<p>So, I ran into this weird situation I can't seem to find solution by any way...
I get Access Violation error, which only occurs on normal run, but not in the debugger, and only when reading more than specific amount of data from database.</p>

<p>I set a timer on main form, so that it starts the procedure a second after the form is displayed (just in case if too early query would make trouble; the prime code was with OnCreate event...);</p>

<p>This is the code:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TStartup1.Timer1Timer(Sender: TObject);
var ch, val: integer;
begin
  AdoQueryOutput2.SQL.Text:='SELECT * FROM LastOutput_Uni1 WHERE ID &gt; 430';
    with AdoQueryOutput2 do
      begin
      open;
        while not eof do
          begin
            ch:=FieldByName('ID').AsInteger;
            val:=FieldByName('LastValue').AsInteger;
            SendDriver.SetDataValue(ch, val);
            next;
          end;
        close;
      end;
      Timer1.Enabled:=False;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, with this query, OR if I completely remove the ""WHERE ID > 430"" criteria, I get the AV error:</p>

<pre><code>Access violation at address 005361FB in module Bitstack.exe. Read of address 00000074;
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I raise the criteria id to 440, the AV does NOT appear; also, if I add the criteria to be ""WHERE ID > 430 AND ID &lt; 480"" for example, it does not raise AV error.
The database table has 512 entries, so all ID records are 512, each has representative data in a field ""LastOutput"", which is then sent to SendDriver unit's SetDataValue procedure, as you can see in the code;
Both data types are integer;</p>

<p>The weird thing is, that if I set breakpoints and run in the debug mode, and then go through the breakpoints continuing with F9 by hand, it runs from 1 to 150 without any problem (when no ""WHERE"" criteria is set), but if I run it in normal mode, the AV error raises the same second the app opens.</p>

<p>Any ideas what is causing this? If there's any additional info required, which I forgot to mention, please notify me.
Thank you!</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE #3:</p>

<p>Here is procedure  executed:</p>

<pre><code>procedure SendDriver.SetDataValue (Channel: LongInt; Data: LongInt);
begin
 Output.Led[Channel-1].Caption:=AddLeadingZeroes(Data, 3);
end
</code></pre>

<p>This does the trick in the Output form, which has array of labels,,  so that channel corresponding label changes caption to value.;</p>

<p>So far I've come to the point, where it all works ok if the query has criteria ""WHERE ID &lt;> 74"".
Now, why is this 74 so important, I have no idea.
Tried to put a SendDriver.SetDataValue(74, 0) on button event, and it raises AV error as well.</p>

<p>Anyone knows why would this 74 be so important?</p>

For example: I call a function from a DLL. This function expects an pointer to an function (to callback). There is the problem: I don't have a real address to a function, because the function which I want to give to the DLL-function only exists as node in my AST. Is there a way to solve the problem? I thought about using a proxy-like function built-in into my interpreter, which delegates to the function in my AST. The problem is, that the proxy-function must have the same signature to be callable from the DLL-function ... and i can't create dynamic functions at runtime.</p>

<p>Everything works great so far. Except for one thing.
The Meteor app will restart the server if the package-File changes. And my approach above will yield to an infinite-loop (because the remove and add-Functionality will trigger Meteor to restart the server again).</p>

I should also note that this is an entirely new package just in case I may have done something to the last one with all my changes, the error still occurs. As far as I can tell it should work.

<p>However, for no apparent reason, the client library is no longer being copied to the client project.  In fact, it has been removed (so now I have a lot of errors in my project because it can't find the libraries).</p>

<p>I've tried re-generating the client library which completes without any errors but the problem persists.  Interestingly, it seems to complete the process slightly faster than it used to.</p>

<p>I've tried cleaning all projects.</p>

<p>I've tried manually adding the generated source folders from <code>endpoint-libs</code>, but I can't because the generated folders no longer exist.  There is also no longer any reference to them in the Java build path for the client project.</p>

<p>I've tried checking out an older version of the code where I know the plugin worked, and the problem occurred there too which leads me to believe it is not a problem in my code.</p>

<p>I also tried deleting the project in eclipse and re-importing everything.</p>

<p>What happened?  I've used the generate function many times before and it worked every time until now.  I <em>think</em> it started after doing a project clean.</p>

<p>I followed the suggestion <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/13571770/758458"">here</a> and was able to generate the client library for one of my endpoints, but the actual .jar file which is needed was not generated (the generated readme file even specifically states the filename and location of the jar but it does not exist).</p>

<p>I begin with a simple data frame that has 6 columns and several hundred rows.  The data columns are Year, Month, Day, and three numeric variables.  There may be several rows that have the same values of Year, Month, and Day.  Here is an example:</p>

<p>Because I want to operate on each day's data independently, I calculate the Julian(unix) day for each row and add the variable jdays to the data frame and then find the unique days.</p>

<pre><code>days &lt;- as.Date(ISOdate(thisFrame$Year,thisFrame$Month,thisFrame$Day))
thisFrame$jdays  &lt;- as.integer(days)
uniq_days &lt;- unique(thisFrame$jdays)           
nudays    &lt;- length(uniq_days)          # number of unique days
</code></pre>

<p>I then loop through the number of unique days and create new data frames by subsetting the original frame based on the unique day.  Then I want to print the results of the operation along with the day, month, and year of the input set.  Should be simple, right?  Well, the results are exactly what I want sometimes and sometimes, I get NA values for the day, month, and year even though they are present in the subset.  I've tried this with several different input data frames and haven't found any pattern that would help me understand why this is happening.</p>

<pre><code>for (i in 1:nudays) {
 thisSet &lt;- thisFrame[thisFrame$jdays == uniq_days[i],]
 print(thisSet)
 print(c(i, thisSet$Day[i], thisSet$Month[i], thisSet$Year[i])
}

<p>Always freeze <code>svn:externals</code> for tags</p>

<p>the scenario is our trunk will always use the 'HEAD' revision for externals, however when we create 'tags' we would like for them to have a revision set for externals to properly 'freeze' them at a specific point in time.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for your feedback/info.</p>

<p>Since I could not find anything that would completely meet our needs (tried <code>smartsvn</code> and <code>svncopy.pl</code>) I made a console app that so far has passed all our test cases.</p>

<p>A high level overview: The app takes a repository URL then looks for all externals and adds the last commit revision for them - I do a <code>svn info</code> and get the ""commit revision"".</p>

<p>The app works with both folder and single file externals.</p>

<p>Here is the source code and complete setup files:

<p>It works, meaning that it creates a text/plain file and returns me an array with its metadata. However, what I want is to create a Google Document, not a text/plain. I tried of course changing the mime type (both appearances) to ""application/vnd.google-apps.document"", but got the following:</p>

<p>Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Google_ServiceException' with message 'Error calling POST <a href=""https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v2/files?uploadType=multipart"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v2/files?uploadType=multipart</a>: (400) Bad Request' in /local/path/to/google-api-php-client/src/io/Google_REST.php:66</p>

<p>Also, I need the document to be publicly accessible. When I upload a text/plain file through the above method, and then try to browse to it (from an account different of the uploader's), I'm told that I need permission. I took a closer look at the array in <code>$createdFile</code> and noticed a 'shared' key with no value, so quite naively I tried setting it to 1 with:</p>

<pre><code>$file-&gt;setShared( 1 );
</code></pre>

<p>It didn't work, and also, when I looked again at the array, I noticed that the 'shared' key had still no value assigned to it. I looked online for any documentation that may help me, but no luck. Anyone can help me out? Thanks!!</p>

So far, so good.</p>

<p>However, there are apparently some types defined in mscorlib.dll (v4) which are ""duplicated"" in FSharp.Core (v2), like <code>System.Tuple</code> and <code>System.IObservable</code>. I can't understand why this is in .Net 4. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd942829.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Matt Ellis specifically said they would be removed in his MSDN article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One language suffering that [duplication] problem was F#, which previously had defined its own tuple type in FSharp.Core.dll but will now use the tuple added in Microsoft .NET Framework 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm ready to look past this particular unseemly duplication if I could just specify which one I want to use in my C# program, however. When I try to use the <code>System.Tuple</code> type, for example, I get the following C# compiler error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error  2   The type 'System.Tuple' exists in both 'c:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework.NETFramework\v4.0\Profile\Client\mscorlib.dll' and 'c:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\FSharp\2.0\Runtime\v2.0\FSharp.Core.dll'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way around this, apparently, is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/64wh5743%28VS.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">a switch on the C# compiler command line which aliases the type</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>csc.exe MyType.cs /reference:System.Tuple`2=mscorlib.dll /reference:FSharp.Core.dll </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I can't find a way to get Visual Studio to send this parameter to the C# compiler. </p>

<p>Anyone have a solution to this?</p>

<p>I have two models: Brand (i.e the brand of the deal) and Deal. A deal belongs to a Brand but a Brand can have many Deals.</p>

<p>models/deal.rb is like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Deal &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :brand
</code></pre>

<p>and we have models/brand.rb:</p>

<pre><code>class Brand &lt; ActiveRecord::Base    
  has_many :deals

  attr_accessible :name
</code></pre>

<p>And i did the t.belongs_to in my migrations so this is ok.</p>

<p>In Active Admin's Deals' create form , i type, as admin, which brand the deal is associated with:</p>

<p>admin/game.rb</p>

<pre><code>ActiveAdmin.register Deal do
# -- Form -----------------------------------------------------------
  form do |f|
    f.inputs ""Brand (i.e. client)"" do
      f.input :brand_id, :label =&gt; ""Select a brand:"", :as =&gt; :select, :collection =&gt; Brand.all
    end
</code></pre>

<p>it works great, and i can create Deals with a certain brand.
but <strong>I CAN'T manage to display the NAME of the Brand in my list of Deals</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveAdmin.register Deal do
index do   
selectable_column   
# id_column 
column :title
column :deal_amount
column :brand do |deal|
  link_to deal.brand.name
end
</code></pre>

<p>...doesn't work.</p>

<p>How can I do that ?</p>

<p>I tried everything but <strong>i basically don't know how to fetch the name of a Brand given it matches the brand_id in the Deal's table</strong>.</p>

<p>What I want to achieve is to have a loader in each cell when the update call is active. EG the user drops an item in the cell and a spinning loader is displayed. Once the call is returned the loader is removed from the cell and the cell updated.</p>

<p>All cells run the same call where the data passed to the call is different. My issue is how to track the cell which the return is mapped to. Using this feature users can have multiple cells loading at one time. Of course if everything works fine the results from the call can return the cell location and that can be used to remove the loader. EG an item is dropped, the call is made, the call returns the data which includes the cell location, JS then uses the cell location data to remove the loader and update the cell.</p>

<p>My issue is what happens if it completely fails (for what ever reason). How does the app know which cell to remove the loader from. EG An item is dropped on a cell and a call is made. A is loader displayed in the cell and the app awaits the return. Lets say the return never comes or the return complete errors out. How does it know which cell the failed call belongs to?</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a way to specify data in the $resource call that can be access in the promise response. EG</p>

<pre><code>rest = $resource('www.api-source.com/layout/34/cells','post',{cell_locaiton:'2x4'},{'post': {method:'GET', isArray: false}});
rest.setTracker('2x5');
rest.post( );     

rest.$promise.then(function(data) {
    $scope.removeLoader(data.cell_data.location);
},function(data, status, headers, config) {
   cell = rest.getTracker( );
   $scope.removeLoader(cell);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where a value is set in the $resource and then extracted from the $promise. I'm not saying this is the best way to do this.
I just want to be able to remove the loader if the cell location data is not returned.</p>

For example I have a movie loaded into MPMoviePlayerController, the user taps and the first section of the movie is played then the movie is paused, on the second tap another section is played and so on. Setting the initialPlayBackTime and endPlayBackTime of MPMoviePlayerController doesn't help as endPlayBackTime gets updated only when stop is called (could it be a bug?), but stopping causes an annoying flicker.</p>

<p>My exception is either ArrayOutofBounds: 0 or ArrayOutofBounds: 3. It has something to do with my exam, quiz, and hw arrays. I've moved them around in my program and changed my numExams, numQuizzes, and numHW values, but it still gives me some trouble. I'd love some insight. Thanks in advance guys.</p>

<p>Recently I added 64bit support to my iOS project (arm64), ever since doing that I started receiving uncaught exceptions for segments of my code inside <code>@try...@catch</code> (I'm using Crashlytics for crash reporting). I managed to reproduce the problem with the following lines of code anywhere in my app (I wrote them inside <code>init</code> of one of my view controllers):</p>

<pre><code>@try {
    NSMutableDictionary *m = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
    NSString *s;
    m[s] = @""poop"";
} @catch (NSException *e) {
    NSLog(@""POOP"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The exception gets caught by the <code>UncaughtExceptionHandler</code> instead of the <code>@catch</code> clause. I'm confused as to what can cause this. The output in the console:</p>

<pre><code>2015-02-22 19:19:53.525 [391:30650] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** setObjectForKey: key cannot be nil'

</code></pre>

<p>I tried removing the custom exception handler that I have and disabling Crashlytics, still no success.</p>

<p>As soon as I remove <code>arm64</code> from <code>ARCHS</code> and <code>VALID_ARCHS</code> the code works and the exception is caught as expected.</p>

<p>Any information will be appreciated!</p>

<hr>

<p>Small update - our XCTests also started not to catch exceptions, up until now the behaviour only happened on physical 64bit phones.</p>

<p>I have managed to extract stock data from the ""bricks &amp; mortar"" database and send this up to the website, but putting the online sales back into the database is proving almost impossible. No docs + uncooperative vendor.</p>

<p>What happens at the moment is the website sells something, the order is processed manually into the store database and then the stock levels are updated back to the website. The issue being that the stock levels are not updated instantly so there is a possibility 2 people can purchase the same item, especially with sale items where there is only a single item left.</p>

<p>I am wondering if there are any good solutions to this?</p>

<p>One thought I had was to store the number of purchases on the website, and subtract that from the number of items in-stock leaving the correct stock level. But then once the order is processed in the ""bricks &amp; mortar"" store, the stock level being exported to the website would be inclusive of that difference, and my online stock levels would be incorrect.</p>

<p>Any help pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated</p>

<p>Now, this works nicely, and the JSlider looks like it should. I'm then controlling the value of the slider programatically, using <code>slider.setValue();</code> I can also fire the mouse listeners on the slider programatically, since it has some code that is executed right when the slider is clicked and when it's released. Again, this all works well. However, I can't seem to figure out how to tell the slider to look pressed when the value is changing. Is there a way to tell swing to make the slider look pressed even though it's not physically pressed (trigger the <code>PRESSED</code> state in the L&amp;F)?</p>

<p>EDIT: I can make this work by using a <code>DISABLED</code> state, which has the same look as the pressed state. I can then disable the slider, move it around, and enable it again later. Obviously, that's a pretty hacky way to achieve the pressed look. Any other ideas would be appreciated.</p>

public class Snake : Animal { ... } // without legs

// other class with legs
public class Table : IHasLegs { ... }

public class CageWithAnimalsWithLegs {
    public List&lt;??&gt; animalsWithLegs { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What should I put in the ?? to force objects that inherit from both <code>Animal</code> and <code>IHasLegs</code>? I don't want to see a <code>Snake</code> in that cage neither a <code>Table</code>.</p>

<p>-------------- EDIT --------------</p>

<p>Thank you all for your answers, but here is the thing:
What I actually want to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IClonable { ... }
public class MyTextBox : TextBox, IClonable { ... }
public class MyComboBox : ComboBox, IClonable { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>TextBox/ComboBox is of course a Control.
Now if I make an abstract class that inherits both Control and IClonable, I will loose the TextBox/ComboBox inheritance that I need. Multiple class inheritance is not allowed, so I have to work with interfaces. Now that I think of it again, I could create another interface that inherits from IClonable:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IClonableControl : IClonable { ... }
public class MyTextBox : TextBox, IClonableControl { ... }
public class MyComboBox : ComboBox, IClonableControl { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;IClonableControl&gt; clonableControls;
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you!!</p>

<pre><code>ID    Total    Start        End          Used
----------------------------------------------
1     350      01-01-2012   31-12-2012   80.6%
2     250      01-01-2012   31-12-2012   51.5%
3     3500     01-01-2012   31-07-2013   12.5%
4     350      01-01-2012   31-10-2012   91.0%
</code></pre>

<p>Columns are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Total</code> -- Total number of the resource (Being currency, time, paper etc).</li>
<li><code>Start</code> -- Start date of resource</li>
<li><code>End</code> -- End date of resource</li>
<li><code>Used</code> -- Percentage of the resource used to date</li>
</ul>

<p>I have to try to work out (or estimate) when the resource will run out at the rate used so far.</p>

<p>I've tried several different ways using the percentage used and the percentage but nothing makes sense, I'm pretty sure there's a simple way to do this that's staring me in the face but I can't find it.</p>

<p>My ideal output would be in text below but I will probably format in the application:</p>

<pre><code>You have used X% of your [resource name] in Y% of the time allotted, 
at this rate the resource will run down around [Run Down Date].
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone work out how this can be calculated?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sqlfiddle.com/#!3/2b212/1"" rel=""nofollow"">SQL Fiddle to play with</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>To try and make the problem clearer, I'll explain how I would calculate a single date:</p>

<p>For the first line (ID = 1).</p>

<pre><code>Average % per day = Percentage (80.6) / Days between Start and Today (205)
Average % per day = 0.003931707%

% remaining = Percentage (80.6%)
% remaining = 19.4%

Days remaining = Average % per day (0.003931707%) / % remaining (19.4%)
Days remaining = 49.34243176

Project Run Down = Today + Days Remaining (49.34243176)
Project Run Down = 11/09/2012 (11th Sep)
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried converting this process into SQL but I can't get it to work.</p>

<p>Add to class Point below an instance method called midpoint which returns an object of type Point representing the midpoint of two points, where one of the points is supplied as a parameter and the other is the current point (i.e. the point provided by the local instance variables). Note that midpoint returns a new Point object. Making good use of class Point, write a program which reads two points and prints their midpoint. The input consists of two lines where each line contains the x- and y-coordinates of a point. An example of input/output follows, with input indicated by bolding:</p>

<pre><code>Enter two points
2.1 3.2
3.0 2.8
The midpoint is (2.55,3.0)
</code></pre>

<p>My code for the point class is as follows and seems to be ok (feel free to point out any errors or improvements):</p>

<pre><code> class Point {


private double x, y; // coordinates


Point(double x0, double y0){ // all-args constructor

    x = x0; y = y0;

}



Point(){}; // no-args constructor (defaults apply)



void get() { 

    x = Console.readDouble(); 

    y = Console.readDouble();

}

public Point midPoint(Point p) {
     double mx = (p.x + x)/2;
     double my = (p.y + y)/2;
     return new Point(mx,my);
}


public String toString() 
{ 

    return ""("" + x + "","" + y + "")"";
}

}

class Midpoint extends Point
{

<p>In a bash script I'm looking for specific data in specific lines in multiple files so I'm using a combination of grep and sed and a for loop for the array of files:</p>

<p><strong>Sample input:</strong><br>
File1:<br>
find a line with data1 and data2<br>
find a line with data1 and data2<br>
some other line<br>
find a line with data1 and data2<br>
File2:<br>
find a line with data1 and data2<br>
some other line<br>
find a line with data1 and data2<br>
find a line with data1 and data2<br>
File3:<br>
some other line<br>
some other line<br>
File4:<br>
some other line<br>
find a line with data1 and data2<br></p>

<pre><code>for FILE in ${FILENAMES[@]}; do
   STRING=$STRING$( grep ""find a line with data1 and data2"" ""$FILE"" | sed -rn ""s/(data1).*(data2).*/\1/p"" )
done

echo ""$STRING""
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this method is when the for loop goes onto the next file and grep finds a line matching the pattern the match is put on the same line as the previous match, e.g.</p>

<p><strong>Sample output:</strong><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>data1       &lt;---- File1 <br>
  data1<br>
  data1data1  &lt;---- File1 and File2<br>
  data1<br>
  data1<br>
  data1       &lt;---- File4<br></p>
  
  <p>*File3 had no matches</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To fix this I put a ""\n"" at the end of grep/sed line, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>for FILE in ${FILENAMES[@]}; do
   STRING=$STRING$( grep ""find a line with data1 and data2"" ""$FILE"" | sed -rn ""s/(data1).*(data2).*/\1/p"" )""\n""
done

echo -e ""$STRING""
</code></pre>

<p>This solves the issue of 2 matches on the same line, but it now adds an empty line when no match is found in a file or after the last match, e.g. </p>

<p><strong>Sample output:</strong><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>data1       &lt;---- File1<br>
  data1<br>
  data1<br>
  data1       &lt;---- File1<br>
  data1       &lt;---- File2<br>
  data1<br>
  data1<br>
               &lt;---- File3<br>
  data1       &lt;---- File4<br>
             &lt;---- No more matches script finished.<br></p>
  
  <p>*File3 had no matches</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is there a way of not using ""\n"" but still ensuring each match in all files are in their own line or have I just taken the wrong approach with the for loop.</p>

<p>Hope this is clear.</p>

<p>Thanks
Brian</p>

<p>If I remove the line has 'spoutConfig.forceStartOffsetTime(-2);', it compiles successfully. However, if use: spoutConfig.startOffsetTime =  kafka.api.OffsetRequest.EarliestTime(); it does not set the offset to the earliest offset in the topic. the topic 'test' has only 4 messages in it, if I set spoutConfig.startOffsetTime =  kafka.api.OffsetRequest.EarliestTime(), the offset is set to 4 instead of 0. I really need a way to set the offset to it's earliest. </p>

<p><strong>Issue #1</strong>
When building with MSBuild it doesn't generate Fake assemblies which are required for our Unit Tests, this leads to build failures. A simple build in visual studio fixes this temporarily, until a new fake assembly needs to be generated.</p>

<p><strong>Issue #2</strong>
When running code analysis this complains with the following:</p>

Unable to cast object of type 'Microsoft.Build.Tasks.CodeAnalysis' to type 'Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask'.

<p>I only have Visual Studio 2013 installed on my machine, apparently installing an older version could fix the issue, but it's not something which I can do. (VS 2013 Ships with its own MSBuild 12.0 which is located in a different directory to the previous MSBuild).</p>

<p>The C++ and javaScript communicate by writing to/reading from a XML file.</p>

<p>After running the program for over 24 hours at a time, I've noticed the occasional javaScript error appearing 'someArray[...].name' is null or not an object. </p>

<p>Now: These are all arrays that are filled with information taken from the XML file, written by the C++. The contents of these arrays are refreshed every few seconds (To update information in the GUI 'live'). </p>

<p>Question is: Could these errors be caused by an access/timer problem as in --> The javaScript starts reading a line from the XML just as the C++ swoops in and rewrites that line. Therefore information is parsed into the javaScript arrays with some illegal characters (etc) which when accessed throws the errors?</p>

<p>This shows the capability discovery and configuration setting going as exepcted, but note that there are no ""Marker"" bits once we get to the actual data (the lines marked ""AVDTP(m)"").</p>

<p>Looking at RFC 3016, and its successor RFC 6416, I see:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marker (M) bit: The marker bit indicates audioMuxElement boundaries.
  It is set to 1 to indicate that the RTP packet contains a complete
  audioMuxElement or the last fragment of an audioMuxElement.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>It is RECOMMENDED to put one audioMuxElement in each RTP packet.  If
  the size of an audioMuxElement can be kept small enough that the size
  of the RTP packet containing it does not exceed the size of the Path
  MTU, this will be no problem.  If it cannot, the audioMuxElement
  SHALL be fragmented and spread across multiple packets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there are no marker bits, ever! What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I've cloned a bare repository from GitHub, the idea being that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developers use GitHub, and push to Github.</li>
<li>On the server, the above-mentioned bare repo fetches from GitHub (say, <code>/var/repo/my_repo</code>)</li>
<li>The bare repo is cloned to one or more ""document root"" locations for web serving to facilitate various checkouts of the codebase. So, <code>/var/www/my_repo_live</code> and <code>/var/www/my_repo_dev</code> are both non-bare clones of <code>/var/repo/my_repo</code> but have different branches or tags checked out for serving.</li>
</ul>

<p>I seem to have run into some complexities—from the <code>git clone</code> <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">manpage</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>When <code>--bare</code> is used, ""the branch heads at the remote are copied directly to corresponding local branch heads, without mapping them to <code>refs/remotes/origin/</code>.""</li>
<li>""Neither remote-tracking branches nor the related configuration variables are created.""  </li>
</ul>

<p>This makes sense: since you're not going to do editing in a bare repository, you don't need to separate remote tracking from local tracking branches. But, then: </p>

<ul>
<li>How <em>are</em> you supposed to fetch?</li>
<li>Given that remote branch heads are copied directly to the corresponding local branch heads, how do you set up your <code>remote.$remote_name.fetch</code> refspec? Should it just be <code>fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I am separating <code>/var/repo/my_repo</code> from the document root repos for permission reasons. I don't want publicly-facing, <code>www-data</code> processes to have access to the repository that's linked to GitHub. Is this overkill? Regardless of whether it's overkill, I would still like to know to properly manage fetching with a bare repo.</p>

The code I used can be found here: <a href=""http://vasanthexperiments.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/aparapi-java-matrix-multiplication-example/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vasanthexperiments.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/aparapi-java-matrix-multiplication-example/</a>. (1024*1024 x 1024*1024 matrix-matrix product)</p>

<p>Basically, I was quite disappointed by the results as the speedup was only marginal compared to serial computation on the CPU (less than x2) and if I made Aparapi use the CPU (which it does parallelized) the CPU was even faster.  <br/>
During execution, the graphic card is under full load so I think there should be no communication issues.</p>

<p>My hardware config.:  <br/>
i7 2670QM <br/>
AMD 7610M <br/>
16GB RAM <br/></p>

<p>Since I'm completely new to GPGPUs I don't know what to expect. <br/>
1. Is it likely that my setup is somehow screwed? If so, where should I look? <br/>
2. Or am I simply expecting too much from an entry level graphic card? If so, how do different models of graphic cards scale with this kind of problem? What are the specs that I have to look for if I wanted to get hardware that is faster?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ok, so I just reran the program with a 10x10 matrix. <br/>
Unsurprisingly, the CPU needed less than 1ms. <br/>
However, the GPU needs more than 1600, so there is definitely something wrong with either Aparapi or openCL or my hardware (drivers should be up to date). Anyone an idea where I should look?</p>

<p>The next problem is that user is unable to seek beyond the downloaded portion of file. I monitored the http terrific and it seems that browser is not sending any byte seek request which it does in case of WMV (In case of wmv it doesn't even work with browsers using web kit engine).</p>

<pre><code>class SystemSetting {
    Group settingGroup
    String key
    String value
    String label
    String type

    Date lastUpdated
    Date dateCreated
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a simple controller which allows me to update these settings (@Transactional annotation) and 'flush: true' on the save.</p>

<p>Now, lets say I set an option from true to false (or any change) once this change is made, it is not reflected on other processes/sessions.</p>

<p>The code to read a setting is the following:</p>

<pre><code>SystemSetting setting = SystemSetting.find(""FROM SystemSetting ss WHERE ss.settingGroup = :group AND ss.key = :key"",
            [group: group, key: key]
        );
</code></pre>

<p>So for example, in browser A) I update a setting. In browser B (or curl) when I view/access this setting it still has the old value.</p>

<p>I have disabled all the caching I know of:</p>

<pre><code>hibernate {
    cache.use_second_level_cache = false
    cache.use_query_cache = false
    cache.region.factory_class = 'org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory' // Hibernate 4
    singleSession = true // configure OSIV singleSession mode
    flush.mode = 'manual' // OSIV session flush mode outside of transactional context
}

grails.hibernate.cache.queries = false
</code></pre>

<p>But these results are still easily duplicated. What/why/where is this option being cached and how to I invalidate it?</p>

<p>This is really not leaving me with a warm feeling inside as it creates tons of issues if I can't be confident of what data will be coming out of the database :(</p>

<p>Using Grails 2.5.1 (and tested on 2.4.4, same result).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I have been able to duplicate this in a fresh application.</p>

<p>Application is available here: <a href=""https://github.com/donald-jackson/grails-async-error-demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/donald-jackson/grails-async-error-demo</a></p>

<p>To duplicate:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clone the repository and configure the datasource to use your local MySQL.</li>
<li>'run-app' in Grails and visit /AsyncErrorTest/systemSetting</li>
<li>Create a setting with optionName = 'testOption' set value to true (or false)</li>
<li>Using curl (or other browser) visit /AsyncErrorTest/systemSetting/showVariable a few times, change the variable value and you will see the output correctly reflects the changes.</li>
<li>Change the value of 'testOption' again. </li>
<li>Call /AsyncErrorTest/systemSetting/showVariableAsync a few times using curl and you will notice the variable will start changing its value between the current and previous.</li>
<li>Once you notice this behaviour you can check in your browser or even on the original showVariable method and it will also give unreliable output.</li>

<p>The language and domains are set for each one from the ""Culture and Hostnames"" popup, and everything works fine (followed these <a href=""http://blog.globalizationpartners.com/umbraco-multi-language.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">instructions</a>).</p>

<p>Now comes the problem. I needed to set up the umbraco site as sub application under my main site, like this:</p>

<pre><code>mainsite.com/umbracosite
it.mainsite.com/umbracosite

<p>So I updated the domains for each of the sites, from ""Culture and Hostnames"" popup.</p>

<p>Now, when I visit any of the new links (for ex: it.mainsite.com/umbracosite), all show the english site, as if they are not taking into account the hostnames set.</p>

<p>Any idea why this does not work? What have I missed? 
I've been trying to find a solution for a week now, but no luck, so i could really use the help.

&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;Module Description&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;AeroViroment Cycler Generic Module2.3.1, &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Communication Type: CAN (MS) via CANNeo driver&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Supported Equipment: AV cyclers:AV900, ABC1000, ABC170, ABC150, and MT30&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It is currently configured to handle Channel A or Channel B on the two channel Cyclers, this is controlled via numPps1Channel which can be set prior to boot up in the Pps1.ini file. This module was made to work as a Cycler Driver in a BcTS/BpTS application. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Revision History:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;2009Jan5, csierra@aanddtech.com, Initial Release for POC testing2.3.2  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;2010Feb5, jdajos@aanddtech.com, fixed init error if test is stopped early and restarted from the beginning.  Pps1Stop.tsc, line 46 added2.3.2  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;2010Feb17, jhaigh@aanddtech.com, added a while loop to all limit action procedures to accommodate local fault log.  If you receive a buld error due to a missing channel flgsyscallout add it to the sys.fil2.3.2&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;2010Mar23, daniel.h.vancleve@gm.com, Updated limit action procedures and default/running limits2.3.3&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;2010Jun04, abilliau, added chamber safety procedure to all limit action.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;13Sept2010, JHaigh, Added flgPps1SPControl.  When set to 0 and the setpoint goes above or below the cycler high or low imits the iTest runs a sysstop.  When set to 1 and the setpoint goes above or below the high or low limits the setpoint is trimmed to match the limits.  When set to 2 and the setpoint exceeds the limits the setpoint is ignored&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;20Sep2010 MBarker, Upped wait for CAN comm timer in Pps1Init to 50 seconds from 30 seconds (which wasnt enough for some cyclers, see Redmine issue #212)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;13March2014, WLowe, Add Pps1BpTS procedure to provide seamless integration into a BpTS Application.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id='ProcDesc'&gt; Procedure Descriptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id='Pps1BpTS.TSC'&gt;Pps1BpTS.TSC&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Procedure Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; This procedure is used as a shell to allow the AV module to support BcTS commands
 Pps1BpTS is called from Pps1Init procedure and will run in the background with a loop delay
 of valSysScanPeriod. The AV Modes are defined with the module channel numPps1ModeOut.
 0 = Voltage
 1 = Current
 2 = Power
 3 = Standby
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Argument Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; None&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Return Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; None

&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id='Pps1ContCheck.TSC'&gt;Pps1ContCheck.TSC&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Procedure Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; This procedure is used to make sure the AV Cycler has not entered into a fault
 mode. If it enters into a fault condition then flgPps1PackErr is set. I believe 
 flgPps1PackErr has active limits that will cause a fault condition that will shut down the cycler
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Argument Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; None&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Return Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; None

&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id='Pps1ErrorText.TSC'&gt;Pps1ErrorText.TSC&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Procedure Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; This procedure is called by Pps1ContCheck and is used to determine what the 
 current problem ID value means and set it to the Packet Error virtual string channel
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Argument Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; None&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Return Description&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; None

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Me and Yavar Husain from the Solr Mailing list both came up with the solution of replacing the MS JDBC Driver with an open source one - this seems to work, and means this must be a compatibility problem between the latest versions of Java, the DIH and the MS JDBC driver.</p>

The code was originally designed so that data would dynamically create controls (and sub-controls of those controls...) on the OnInit event on numerous web control panels. And then later validation methods would check those dynamically created controls for valid data. This continues to work just fine for my web site. However, I need to be able to validate that data without my website (as in this will just be server side).

"14510586","1","14765060","","2013-01-24 20:55:53","","1","807","<p>I've been evaluating Neo4j 1.9.M03 for a while now, and have come to a head that I did not expect. </p>

<p>I have a graph of ~140,000 vertices. I also have three classes of edges, let's call them father, mother, and husband. There are about 80,000 edges per class. There are no properties, and no indexes. The vertex store size is about 1.3 MB, and the edge store is about 8 MB. </p>

<p>The data originates in SQL Server and the quality of migration from SQL to Neo4j is known to be correct. A SQL shortest path stored procedure has been run for dozens of vertex pairs, such that the shortest path distance and path is known.</p>

<p>The shortest path query is Cypher: <code>START one=node(0), two=node(1234) MATCH p = shortestPath(one-[*..1000]-two) RETURN p;</code></p>

<p><strong>PARTIAL TEST CASE ONE:</strong> I use only husband and father relations, the occurrence of cycles (e.g. <code>v[0] -&gt; v[1] -&gt; v[2] -&gt; v[0])</code> is low. If I perform a shortest path calculation on a specific known long path (e.g. known to be ~450 hops), it returns within 50ms (non-cached) with a path of ~550 hops. The increased length is expected, since we are excluding a portion of the edges.</p>

<p><strong>PARTIAL TEST CASE TWO</strong>: Likewise, if I use only husband and mother relations, the occurrence of cycles (e.g. <code>v[0] -&gt; v[1] -&gt; v[2] -&gt; v[0])</code> is low. If I perform the same shortest path, I get a result on the same order as before: about 50ms (non-cached), with a similar increase in path length.</p>

<p><strong>FULL TEST CASE</strong>: I use all (father, mother, and husband) relations. The occurrence of cycles is now predictably high because of the common case <code>v[0] mother-&gt; v[1] husband-&gt; v[2] &lt;-father v[0]</code>. When I execute the shortest path query, the JVM allocates 4 gigabytes of memory and the calculation does not complete. <strong>This is the problem.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>My thesis is that the regular occurrence of cycles is causing this behavior, otherwise I would not expect such a huge difference in performance when I only add another class of parent edge--unless the shortest path algorithm was not accounting for cycles.</p>

<p>I applied the Dijkstra Algorithm using the Java API directly, with a cost of 1 across all edges, and achieved similar results to the standard ShortestPath algorithm used. As a result, I received this exception after 6 minutes of IntelliJ debug time.</p>

<p>Do you think I'm right? Is this a known limitation of graph databases or their shortest path algorithms? It seems quite silly to me that previously-visited vertexes would not be stored in a hash table, such that the shortest path algorithm would not attempt to path out of a previously visited vertex more than once.</p>

<p>I have a program that batch processes images and am running out of memory making repeated use (in a loop) of the following:</p>

<pre><code>Using str As Stream = File.OpenRead(file_stem + CStr(file_number) + ""."" + file_extension)
    temp_img = Image.FromStream(str)
    str.Close()
End Using
PictureBox1.Image = temp_img
bm = PictureBox1.Image.Clone

<p>temp_img is globally declared <code>Dim temp_img As Image</code>. bm is declared in the same Sub routine as the loop <code>Dim bm As Bitmap</code>.</p>

<p>As the program runs I can see in Task Manager the memory usage rising and then it crashes with an out of memory error. It's as if each time I am using the Stream it is keeping the memory used. What am I doing wrong here?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
This thread appears to have gone cold now, but I thought I would share my ""work around"" for this. It would seem that this is a VB.net bug as the way I have fixed it is to add a MsgBox which is shown only one, immediately prior to the first call to the subroutine that processes sets of 60 images. I ran a single job that processed 96 sets of 60 images and the memory usage didn't rise above about 45MB. The important thing that makes me think it is a bug is that I only show the MsgBox before the first set of 60 and all are run in series. Showing an MsgBox shouldn't fix anything in itself anyway!</p>
