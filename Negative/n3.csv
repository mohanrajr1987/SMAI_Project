"29977359","1","","","2015-04-30 20:38:22","","1","99","<p>I'm trying to extend the Calendar control into my own that has some dependency properties for setting things like the hover colors, highlight of the current day, and so on. I've got all of my properties and hook them up using bindings, but for some reason, the text displayed for the day of the week heading will not change its font color or style. At first I thought it was my bindings because I'm using a RelativeSource and finding the ancestor type, but I then tried setting them explicitly in the DataTemplate but nothing works.</p>

<p>Is this an inheritance issue from the Calendar base? Or is there something going on internally that's overriding my template? Here's my DataTemplate for the CalendarItem:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataTemplate x:Key=""{x:Static CalendarItem.DayTitleTemplateResourceKey}""&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock Foreground=""Red""
                 FontWeight=""Bold""
                 FontSize=""{Binding FontSize, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=local:CalendarControl}}""
                 FontFamily=""Arial""
                 HorizontalAlignment=""Center""
                 Margin=""0,6,0,6""
                 Text=""{Binding}""
                 VerticalAlignment=""Center"" /&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The way I understand it from here, this DataTemplate is used to dynamically generate items for these which are then inserted into the ""PART_MonthView"" grid below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name=""PART_MonthView""
      Grid.ColumnSpan=""3""
      TextElement.FontFamily=""Arial""
      HorizontalAlignment=""Center""
      Margin=""6,-1,6,6""
      Grid.Row=""1""
      Visibility=""Visible""&gt;
      &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
          &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto"" /&gt;
      &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
      &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
          &lt;RowDefinition Height=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;RowDefinition Height=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;RowDefinition Height=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;RowDefinition Height=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;RowDefinition Height=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;RowDefinition Height=""Auto"" /&gt;
          &lt;RowDefinition Height=""Auto"" /&gt;
      &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is this DataTemplate even the right template? When you view the control in runtime and use snoop to browse the visual tree, you can see the text blocks being inserted into the grid but the values are coming from a local source:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xgFvU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I'm stumped and can't find any concrete answers on how to style this stuff. Am I better off building my own UI and then just watching property values to see if they change? Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

Most search results, both here on SO and outside, come up MongoDB <strong><em>versus</em></strong> MySQL rather than MongoDB <strong><em>with</em></strong> MySQL. Database design isn't really my strongest forte -- I've never deployed any sort of database to production -- and I prefer MongoDB simply because it's so much easier to learn and work with and I got the most familiarity with it. My question is thus, how would I go about setting up this sort of environment where Node.js is the language and I want to use MongoDB as the main database and MySQL just for transactions or specifically, to enforce consistency and data integrity in the MongoDB database?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Database activity will be 1% transactions for cascade delete operations with the deletes happening infrequently. The other 99% of the time is where I believe MongoDB will be a good fit.</p>

<p>I understand that in Rails 3.2 attributes are locked down by default and in order for them to be assigned I need to ""unlock"" them using attr_accessible.  This works fine for normal model attributes.</p>

<p>However, I have a homegrown custom property mixin that allows me to add arbitrarily named properties to any model.  These properties are stored in the custom_properties table.  This mixin leverages method missing to look for a property from that table if I ask a model for a property like: foo.property_foobar.</p>

<p>Each model that uses this mixin can have X custom properties with arbitrary names.  I don't have the ability to dictate the names of these properties which obviously makes it difficult to add to attr_accessible.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a recommendation on how I can allow mass assignment of these dynamic properties?  I would rather not whitelist all model attributes.</p>

Also, I need the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.PowerShell cmdlets to be installed, whereas for some reason they're not installed by default when running tfpt.msi. As such, the cmdlets are missing on a lot of machines. Finally, as this will be part of a larger script, it would be nice if it could quickly short-circuit when no action is required.</p>

<p>Furthermore, tfpt.msi doesn't seem to like to be installed again without prior uninstallation, and this is presenting a pain point I would like to get around, if possible.</p>

<p>So far, my research has led me to several discoveries.</p>

<ul>
<li>I've used Orca from the Server 2003 Platform SDK to inspect tfpt.msi and discover that the powershell cmdlets are the TFPS feature.</li>
<li>Individual features can be installed from the command line with msiexec /i tfpt.msi ADDLOCAL=TFPS</li>
<li>Furthermore, a silent install can be done with the /qn flag, and perhaps using AGREETOLICENSE=yes</li>
<li>The win32_product WMI class can tell me which if any version of TFPT is installed, although it's painfully slow.</li>
<li>A forced msi upgrade can be accomplished with msiexec /fvecmus tfpt.msi</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, I need to do these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>If tfpt isn't installed, install the latest one, including TFPS</li>
<li>If tfpt is an old version, install the latest version and ensure TFPS is included.</li>
<li>If tfpt is the latest version, but the TFPS feature is missing, install TFPS.</li>
<li>If tfpt is the latest and the TFPS feature is installed, do nothing (an hopefully be quick in determining it).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a breakdown of the dots I have left to connect:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a way I can test whether the TFPS feature of tfpt.msi has been installed, so that I can skip the installer when current?</li>
<li>The forced upgrade of tfpt.msi seems to require a reboot. Is this required?</li>
<li>Using msiexec /fvecmus seems kind of like throwing the book at the problem--is this a normal way to do things? Would it be better to uninstall and then reinstall?</li>
</ul>

<p>Any advice would be appreciated!</p>

To create the graph, my teacher said we can use the edge and graph classes from our textbook. However, the book uses Integers for vertices rather than strings. I tried replacing all Integers with Strings, but I received a compiler error for every line that used .get() from the generic TreeMap because it could not find the symbol method get(java.lang.String). After a little work, I discovered that initializing the TreeMap and  using .add() works with Strings, but not the .get() or .put() methods. Here is the code exactly the way it is in the book except Integer is replaced with String. How can I make the .get() and .put() methods to work with Strings? </p>

<pre><code>import java.util.*;

        adjList.add(new TreeMap&lt;String, String&gt;());
    }//for
 }//constructor

 public int getNumVertices() {
    return numVertices;
 }//getNumVertices

 //Determines the number of edges in the graph
 public int getNumEdges() {
    return numEdges;
 }//getNumEdges

//Determines the weight of the edge between vertices v and w
 public String getEdgeWeight(String v, String w) {
    return adjList.get(v).get(w);
}//getEdgeWeight

//Add the edge to both v's and w's adjacency list
public void addEdge(String v, String w, int wgt) {
    adjList.get(v).put(w,wgt);
    adjList.get(w).put(v,wgt);
    numEdges++;
}//addEdge

//Adds an edge to the graph
public void addEdge(Edge e) {
    //Extract the vertices and weight from the edge e

It works as expected on each runs of the batch file, but if I put the call to cscript in a loop, the return value seems to get cached while the batch file is running. Here is the problem stripped down to it's essence:</p>

<p>demo.bat:</p>

    cscript /nologo /e:jscript ""demo.js"" %%i

<p>Now, I have some window including a ListBox whose items are instances of this UserControl, like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox HorizontalContentAlignment=""Stretch"".../&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The ListBox is in a 1-column star-sized grid and thus stretches to fit all the available width in its container. When I resize the container of this ListBox the ListBox too resizes as expected as it is stretched in a star-sized Grid column; and the same holds true for the ListBox items', which too are stretched and in this case happen to be instances of a UserControl with the above layout (3 columns in a grid, the 3rd star-sized).</p>

<p>The problem is that the TextBox in the 3rd column of the UserControl used as a listbox item should not automatically increase its width when I type into it some long text: it should just wrap, increasing its height (up to a maximum height; then the vertical scrollbar will appear). In other words, its MaxWidth should be determined by the available space, like its Width. </p>

When a person intents to pay for an auction item, I pass his email_id and that of the seller to Paypal and then invoke IPN through notify_url. Once he pays the data is sent to my <strong>IPN listener</strong> so that I process and update the database. My question is; since I am a third party, if the seller has disabled IPN will I receive the variables on my IPN  listener? If not how else can I ensure that I get confirmation of payment and process the database. I cant use <strong>return_url</strong> because it is dependent on whether the buyer returns to my site.</p>

For example, <code>NSUserDefaults</code> is accessible by the method <code>[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]</code> and <code>NSNotificationCenter</code> by <code>[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]</code>. I was wondering how I could make one of my custom objects in an application shared, so the current instance of that object could be accessed via a method like <code>[MyObject sharedObject]</code>?</p>

<p>I downloaded an application with this functionality, but the object that was shared only declared the method used to access the current instance of the object in the header file (.h), and there was no implementation of the method in the implementation file (.m). </p>

<p>It declared it by saying:</p>

<pre><code>+ (GameObject *)sharedGameObject;
</code></pre>

<p>I know the plus means it is a class method, meaning that it does not require an instance of that class to be created, but can be accessed anyway, like <code>CALayer</code>'s <code>[CALayer layer]</code> method.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any help!

<p>The function needs to simply convert the list of words to integers.. While carrying the height and width without change. My attempt:</p>

<pre><code>convertToIntegers :: ([GHC.Word.Word8], Integer, Integer) -&gt; ([Integer], Integer, Integer)
convertToIntegers ([], x, y) =  ([], x, y)
convertToIntegers ((a:as), x, y) = ( toInteger a : convertToIntegers (as, x, y), x, y)

<p>Obviously, this doesn't work and returns a type error:</p>

<pre><code>Couldn't match expected type `[Integer]' with actual type `([Integer], Integer, Integer)'

In the return type of a call of `convertToIntegers' 
In the second argument of `(:)', namely `convertToIntegers (as, x, y)'
In the expression: toInteger a : convertToIntegers (as, x, y)

<p>It seems like it should be simple, and I can accomplish it by splitting it up and using a helper function. In trying to figure this out, I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>convertToIntegers :: ([GHC.Word.Word8], Int, Int) -&gt; [Integer]
convertToIntegers ([], x, y) =  []
convertToIntegers ((a:as), x, y) = toInteger a : convertToIntegers (as, x, y)

<p>Here's how it looks when calculating the inner shadow based on edge 1 only:</p>

<p>Here's how it looks when calculating the inner shadow based on edge 2 only:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JaXpp.png"" alt=""Inner shadow from edge 2""></p>

<p>Notice how the inner shadow is correct for both edges individually.</p>

<p>Now, here's how it looks when calculating the inner shadow based on both edges:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/650aA.png"" alt=""Inner shadow from edges 1 and 2""></p>

<p>Notice the inner lightness between the edges? And, for reference, here is a similar outcome when calculating the inner shadow based on all of the edges:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aXQC2.png"" alt=""Inner shadow from all edges""></p>

<p>When looking at the inner shadows generated by edge 1 and edge 2 independently, it doesn't look like that inner lightness would form by factoring in both edges at the same time. What could be causing it? The points along the lightness should not have a larger distance than their neighboring points because I'm calculating the minimum distance from all of the edges.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Based on some early answers, it looks like my issue is that I've implemented a ""darken"" algorithm, and combining two gradients this way causes the side effect in my screenshots. For example, if you take my first two screenshots, overlay them in an image editor, and set the second layer to the ""darken"" blend mode, you'll get my third screenshot.</p>

<p>What I'm really looking for is some kind of multiplication. If I use the ""multiply"" blend mode in my image editor, I get the desired look:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6AevN.png"" alt=""Inner shadow from edges 1 and 2 multiplied""></p>

<p>How would I achieve this? It looks like I have to calculate the inner shadow independently for each edge, then multiply all of the coefficients together, instead of calculating one coefficient based on the closest edge.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>Implementing a multiplicative blend mode results in darker areas around the vertices of the shape. Turned out worse than my original version. I've decided to stick with the original version as it's fast, correct, and the undesired side effects are minimized by scaling the coefficient around 0.8-1.0 instead of 0.0-1.0. I've also accepted the answer that led me down this path.</p>

(The primary key is actually a <code>bigint</code>, so I guess potentially we would like to support billions of rows, although this is probably never going to occur). </p>

<p>A single node can have a very large amount of direct children, more likely the higher up in the hierarchy they are. We have no specified limit to the actual maximum depth of a leaf, i.e. how many nodes one would have to traverse to get to the root, but in practice this would probably normally not grow beyond a few hundred at the very most. Normally it would probably be below 20.</p>

<p>Insertions in this table is very frequent and needs to be high performing. Insertions nodes inserted are always leaf nodes, and always after the last sibling. Nodes are never moved. Deletions are always made as entire subtrees.  Finding subtrees is the other operation made on this table. It does not have the same performance requirements, but of course we would like it as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Today this is modeled with the parent/child model, which is efficient for insertions, but is painfully slow for finding subtrees. When the table grows large, this becomes extremely slow and finding a subtree may take several minutes.</p>

<p>So I was thinking about converting this to perhaps using the new hierarchyid type in SQL Server.  But I am having troubles figuring out whether this would be suitable. As I undestand it, for the operations we perform in this scenario, such a tree would be a good idea. (Please correct me if I'm wrong here).  </p>

<p>But it also states that the maximum size for a hierarchyid is 892 bytes. However, I can not find any information about what this means in practice. How is the hierarchyid encoded? Will I run out of hierarchyids, and if so, when?</p>

<p>If it's not clear, here's a silly example. Let's say these are the files who compose a SimpleGame:</p>

<ul>
<li>launcher.exe (no need to explain what this does)</li>
<li>resource1.txt (file I want to replace in the mod)</li>
<li>resource2.txt (normal game file)</li>
<li>logo.png (normal game file)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, suppose that resource1.txt contains ""Hi, welcome to SimpleGame"" and I want to load a mod of the game. Let's suppose also that resource2.txt contains ""Lorem ipsum"" (I lack fantasy just now). The mod has the file resource1.txt only who contains ""Hi, welcome to [this mod]"".</p>

<p>I'd like to ""push"" this file in launcher.exe at runtime <strong>without actually copying it</strong>, so it would load his normal resource files, except the ones (in this case one) passed in runtime who are loaded from custom directory. So the resoult would be (if game loads them sequentially) ""Hi, welcome to [this mod] Lorem ipsum"".</p>

<p>I know this is possible because I've actually seen a DLL lib (written in C++) which actually does this on a game and makes it run custom files without copying it in game's directory, and I even worked with it using that in a program of mine. Unfortunately that lib is closed source so I don't know how to replicate it, because it works for just a game.</p>

<p>So I searched a lot on Google finding nothing (probably wrong keywords) and even things about Reverse Engineering but no success.</p>

<p>The utility of a loader like this is that a real game can be heavy lot of GBs. I'd like to push mods at runtime without modifying game files, because that would require a re-installation or repair of the game.</p>

<p>I even tried to do a program that modifies them and backs them up later (and works) but it can take long time for large files and can have issues. The lib I used did everything instantly.</p>

<p>Edit: the game is third party so I cannot modify its code. I'd like to make a library or a program than could replace the other third party library I found.</p>

<p>I realize that because a WCF DS is HTTP-based there is overhead inherent in the protocol but my tests are still way slower than I would expect:</p>

<p>Environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>All on one box: Quad core 64-bit laptop with 4GB RAM running W7. Decent machine.</li>
<li>Small SQL database (SQLExpress 2008 R2) with 16 tables... the table under test has 243 rows.</li>
<li>Hosted my test service in IIS with all defaults.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've created a Entity Framework model (DataContext) for this database (stock codegen by VS2010).</li>
<li>I've created a data-service based on this model.</li>
<li>I've created a client which has a direct service reference (ObjectContext) for this service (stock codegen by VS2010)</li>
<li>In the client I am also able to call the EF model directly and also use Native SQL (ADO.NET SqlConnection)</li>
</ul>

<p>Test Plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each iteration connects to the database (there is an option to reuse connections), queries for all rows in the target table (""EVENTS"") and then counts them (thus forcing any deferred fetches to be performaed).</li>
<li>Run for 25 iterations each for Native SQL (SqlConnection/SqlCommand), Entity Framework (DataContext) and WCF Data Services (ObjectContext).</li>
</ul>

<p>Results:</p>

<ul>
<li>25 iterations of Native SQL: 436ms</li>
<li>25 iterations of Entity Framework: 656ms</li>
<li>25 iterations of WCF Data Services: 12110ms</li>
</ul>

<p>Ouch. That's about 20x slower than EF.</p>

<p>Since WCF Data Services is HTTP, there's no opportunity for HTTP connection reuse, so the client is forced to reconnect to the web server for each iteration. But surely there's more going on here than that.</p>

<p>EF itself is fairly fast and it's the same EF code/model is reused for both the service and the direct-to-EF client tests. There's going to be some overhead for Xml serialization and deserialization in the data-service, but that much!?! I've had good performance with Xml serialization in the past.</p>

<p>I'm going to run some tests with JSON and Protocol-Buffer encodings to see if I can get better performance, but I'm curious if the community has any advice for speeding this up.</p>

<p>I'm not strong with IIS, so perhaps there are some IIS tweaks (caches, connection pools, etc) that can be set to improves this?</p>

So if we write an interface, we can stuff all kinds of utility methods there that we would normally have to place in a separate class.

We've been using PayflowPro for years, and this is what I have to use.  From my reading it seems that I should use the Transparent Redirect so I'm not posting anything private to my webserver, though I don't know if I need that with how I'm hoping to handle this.  I also have a few questions...</p>

<p><strong>How I think this all works:</strong>
My understanding is that you need a securetoken (communication to Paypal, trip 1).  Then you post the secure data (CC, exp, security code) including the securetoken (communication to Paypal, trip 2) and receive the authorization and transactionID of the sale.  </p>

<p><strong>How I'm hoping to do it:</strong>
I'm intending on having a form that will have all the info (user details, shipping details, and CC info), and when the user presses the purchase button, I'll use AJAX to process trip 1 to my server (no secure user info sent).  Here I'll create the URL + params and send paypal my un/pw info to retrieve the token (all from my server).  The response will be returned to the client and, if successful, I'll then directly communicate via AJAX to Paypal's Gateway server, this time sending the secure CC info + token (trip #2).  Based on the response to trip #2,  I'll let the user know what's up with their purchase.  Trip 2 shouldn't need my Paypal UN/PW info as it could easily be see on the client, and I'm including the SecureToken which SHOULD identify the original transaction. From what I've explained I don't see a need for Transparent Redirect.  Or am I missing something here?</p>

<p>Also, what Transaction Type do I want to use?  Create an 'Authorization' for trip #1, then a 'Sale' for trip #2?</p>

<p><strong>So here's the nitty gritty coding type stuff:</strong>
For my R&amp;D testing I'm building my own name/value pair parameter string (see below) and communicating to the gateway server via WebRequest through their sandbox/test url (pilot-payflowpro.paypal.com).  I do get a successful response and SECURETOKEN back.  Initial request (shown below) for secure token is TRXTYPE = A (Authorization), no card info is sent.  Do I want to authorize first?</p>

<p>Here are my parameters (might include shipto info as well, but it's not listed below):</p>

<pre><code>USER=myAuthUserName
&amp;VENDOR=myAuthUserName
&amp;PARTNER=myPartner
&amp;PWD=myPassword
&amp;AMT=21.43
&amp;BILLTOFIRSTNAME=FName
&amp;BILLTOLASTNAME=LName
&amp;BILLTOSTREET=123 Main Street

&amp;BILLTOCITY=MyCity

&amp;EMAIL=myemail@somedomain.com

&amp;SILENTTRAN=TRUE
&amp;CREATESECURETOKEN=Y
&amp;SECURETOKENID=a99998afe2474b1b82c8214c0824df99
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, I get a successful response and move to the next step of sending the secure data (CC#, EXPDATE, security code).  When I remove my UN/PW/VENDOR/Partner info from the params I get an error due to invalid user authentication. But, seeing I'm dynamically building this 2nd call I can't have my paypal un/pw there.  What am I missing?  Anyone offer assistance with this or the other questions from above?</p>

<p>Please let me know if I need any clarification to be added.  Thanks in advance for your time!</p>

I've found _fivestar_cast_vote, but am having trouble getting it to take for the field I'm trying to use, which is ""rated when editing"".

<p>I have a similar situation that can be reached by extending the union-subclass mapping of the above post a bit, by adding an abstract Name-property to the Party. The model would be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Party
{
    public abstract string Name { get; }
}

public class Person : Party
{
    public override string Name { get { return this.FirstName + "" "" + this.LastName; } }

}

public class Company : Party
{
    public override string Name { get { return this.CompanyName; } }
    public virtual string CompanyName { get; set; }
}

<p>I'm looking for a mapping that would allow me to query over the parties in the following manner:</p>

<pre><code>session.QueryOver&lt;Party&gt;().Where(p =&gt; p.Name.IsLike(""firstname lastname"")).List();
</code></pre>

<p>The mapping I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;class name=""Party"" table=""`party`"" abstract=""true""&gt;
&lt;id access=""backfield"" name=""Id""&gt;
  &lt;column name=""Id"" /&gt;
  &lt;generator class=""sequence""&gt;

  &lt;/generator&gt;
&lt;/id&gt;
&lt;union-subclass name=""Person"" table=""`person`""&gt;
  &lt;property name=""Name"" formula=""first_name || ' ' || last_name"" update=""false"" insert=""false"" access=""readonly""&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;property name=""FirstName""&gt;
    &lt;column name=""first_name"" /&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;property name=""LastName""&gt;

  &lt;property name=""CompanyName""&gt;
    &lt;column name=""company_name"" /&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/union-subclass&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For both </p>

<pre><code>session.QueryOver&lt;Person&gt;().Where(p =&gt; p.Name.IsLike(""firstname lastname"")).List();

<pre><code>session.QueryOver&lt;Company&gt;().Where(p =&gt; p.Name.IsLike(""companyName"")).List();

<pre><code>session.QueryOver&lt;Party&gt;().Where(p =&gt; p.Name.IsLike(""firstname lastname"")).List();
</code></pre>

<p>The query doesn't match the Persons at all, but uses the mapping from the union-subclass of the company. So when parametrized with Party, the query seems to be essentially the same as when parametrized with Company (the WHERE-clause of the query is: WHERE this_.company_name = ((E'firstname lastname')::text))</p>

<p>Any pointers about where I might be going wrong and how to achieve what I'm after?</p>

We have a POJO, let's call it <code>Widget</code>, that has about 10 properties on it. My software must process groups of <code>Widget</code> lists: essentially there are other processes (completely different systems) that put together their own <code>List&lt;Widget&gt;</code>, and then send them to my software. My software actually receives a wrapper POJO that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Payload {
    private List&lt;Widget&gt; widgets; // &lt;-- what I want
    private String guid; // GUID; my software doesn't need this
    private boolean fizz; // again, my software doesn't need this
    ... many other properties that I don't care about
}
</code></pre>

<p>My software aggregates all these <code>List&lt;Widget&gt;</code>, each created by different systems, and then process them together in one big batch.</p>

<p>I have tentatively chose <code>ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;Widget&gt;&gt;</code> as the data structure for holding this batch of <code>Widget</code> lists. There will be about 500,000 groups of <code>List&lt;Widget&gt;</code> (the outer <code>ArrayList</code>), and each <code>List&lt;Widget&gt;</code> will have about 5 <code>Widget</code>s each; for a grand total of ~2.5 million <code>Widget</code>s in the inner <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>

<p>At a recent code review, some tech leads told me I had chosen the wrong data structure for this batch o' widgets. They told me I should have used <code>HashMap&lt;String,List&lt;Widget&gt;&gt;</code>, because its more efficient and easier to work with. The hashmap key is a GUID contained in the <code>Payload</code> that my software is given. Not that I need the GUID for any reason, it just serves as a key to keep the ~500,000 <code>List&lt;Widget&gt;</code> separate - which I do need to do.</p>

<p>This got me thinking: who's right?!? The only operations we're doing on this data structure are ""adds"" (in the case of <code>ArrayList</code>, just adding a <code>Widget</code> or a <code>List&lt;Widget&gt;</code> via <code>add(...)</code>) and then ""reads"" (inside my software I have to iterate through every <code>Widget</code> and inspect it for stuff. With my nested <code>ArrayList</code> the gist of it is:</p>

<pre><code>for(List&lt;Widget&gt; widgetList : myDoublyNestedArrayOfWidgets) {
    for(Widget widget : widgetList) {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>These are the only operations we need: add the disparate <code>List&lt;Widget&gt;</code>s to some big ""batch"" data structure, and then at a later time, inspect all of them and do stuff with each <code>Widget</code>. This software runs on some beefed up servers with lots of memory and processing power.</p>

<p>So I ask: <strong>Is <code>ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;Widget&gt;&gt;</code> the right choice, <code>HashMap&lt;String,List&lt;Widget&gt;&gt;</code>, or something else...and why?</strong> Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>6-</strong> Then I closed the Visual Studio and from the main folder of <strong>FLTK</strong> I opened the <strong>lib</strong> folder and copied seven lib files except <strong>README.lib</strong> file into this path of my machine (<em>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\lib</em>).</p>

<p><strong>7-</strong> Then I went to main folder of <strong>FLTK</strong> and copied the <strong>FL</strong> folder into this path (<em>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\include</em>). Now that <em>include</em> directory contains a folder named FL.</p>

<p><strong>8-</strong> And also I found <strong>fltk.sln</strong> file in this path (<em>C:\Users\CS\Downloads\Compressed\fltk-1.3.2-source\fltk-1.3.2\ide\VisualC2010</em>). I installed it too (then <strong>Build Solution</strong>). Shouldn’t would I install it also?</p>

<p><strong>9-</strong> I then created a “Win32 Project” from Visual Studio named it to “Win32Project1”. And did the works as follows:</p>

<p>Win32Project1 --> OK --> Next --> Clicking on “empty project” --> Finish.
In “Solution Explorer” right click on “Win32Project1” --> choosing “Add” --> new item --> choosing “C++ file (.cpp)” --> naming the project to “Win32Project1” --> Add.</p>

<p><strong>10-</strong> Now this new project is empty and in bottom there is only this message:  <em>VMware Virtual Debugger loaded successfully</em>. That’s why because I installed VMware Workstation program on my machine I think.</p>

<p><strong>11-</strong> Then I clicked on <strong>Project</strong> menu and chose <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>12-</strong> Then <strong>Linker</strong> --> <strong>Input</strong> and in the <strong>Additional Dependencies</strong> text field, I wrote this text:  <em>fltkd.lib wsock32.lib comctl32.lib fltkjpegd.lib fltkimagesd.lib</em></p>

<p><strong>13-</strong> In the <strong>Ignore Specific default Libraries</strong>  text field, I wrote <strong>libcd.lib</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>14-</strong> Then <strong>C/C++</strong> --> <strong>Code Generation</strong>, and in the <strong>Runtime Library</strong> the <strong>Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd)</strong> is chosen in advance. So I simply clicked on OK only.</p>

<p><strong>15-</strong> Then I wrote the simple code of page 1160 (<em>D.5</em>) as follows on that project and pressed <strong>F5</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;FL/Fl.h&gt;
#include &lt;FL/Fl_box.h&gt;
#include &lt;FL/Fl_Window.h&gt;

//***************************

int main() 
{
  Fl_Window window(200, 200, ""Window title"");
  Fl_Box box(0,0,200,200, ""Hey, I mean, He llo, World! "");
  window.show();
  return Fl::run();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>16-</strong> An error occurred saying:</p>

<p>E*rror 1 error LNK1104: cannot open file 'fltkd.lib wsock32.lib comctl32.lib fltkjpegd.lib fltkimagesd.lib'            c:\Users\CS\documents\visual studio 2012\Projects\Win32Project1\Win32Project1\LINK*</p>

<p>So I returned to the <strong>Linker</strong> --> <strong>Input</strong> and in the <strong>Additional Dependencies</strong> text field, I clicked on &lt;<em>Edit…</em>>, and separated each <em>.lib</em> file by a new line. And again ran.
Next error was this:
                       <em>Error 1 error LNK1104: cannot open file 'fltkjpegd.lib'    c:\Users\CS\documents\visual studio 2012\Projects\Win32Project1\Win32Project1\LINK</em></p>

<p><strong>17-</strong> So I again went to the (<em>fltk-1.3.2-source\fltk-1.3.2\lib</em>) and copied all the <em>.lib</em> files except for readme, (there were 13 <em>.lib</em> files) and pasted them into that path (<em>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\lib</em>) and reran the code. This time code succeeded. WOW.</p>

<p><strong>18-</strong> So after this success I downloaded the Programming-code zip file from Stroustrup's website and copied all the <strong>.h</strong> and <strong>.cpp</strong> files (10 files) from the <strong>GUI</strong> folder into my include folder of this path (<em>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\include</em>). There was also a <em>Makefile</em> file which I didn’t copy it into the include directory. And then I cleared the previous code and wrote the code written in page 441 (A first example) as follows into that project and ran it.</p>

<pre><code>//
// This is example code from Chapter 12.3 ""A first example"" of
// ""Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++"" by Bjarne Stroustrup
//

#include ""Simple_window.h""    // get access to our window library
#include ""Graph.h""            // get access to our graphics library facilities

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

int main()
{
    using namespace Graph_lib;   // our graphics facilities are in Graph_lib

    Point tl(100,100);           // to become top left  corner of window

    Simple_window win(tl,600,400,""Canvas"");    // make a simple window

    Polygon poly;                // make a shape (a polygon)

    poly.add(Point(300,200));    // add a point
    poly.add(Point(350,100));    // add another point
    poly.add(Point(400,200));    // add a third point 

    poly.set_color(Color::red);  // adjust properties of poly

    win.attach (poly);           // connect poly to the window

    win.wait_for_button();       // give control to the display engine
}

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>19-</strong> There were 13 errors which first error was saying:</p>

<p><em>Error    8 error C2872: 'Polygon' : ambiguous symbol              C:\users\cs\documents\visual studio 2012\projects\win32project1\win32project1\win32project1.cpp      20</em></p>

<p><strong>20-</strong> So I used this snip code <strong>Graph_lib::Polygon poly;</strong> instead of this <strong>Polygon poly;</strong> and ran the code again. Again there were 11 errors, first is this:</p>

<p>*Error    9          error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ""protected: virtual void __thiscall Graph_lib::Window::draw(void)"" (?draw@Window@Graph_lib@@MAEXXZ)            C:\Users\CS\documents\visual studio 2012\Projects\Win32Project1\Win32Project1\Win32Project1.obj*</p>

<p>I have all the graphics (multiple photos, photoshopped and cut out for the different car body colors. I'm doing the same with the car rim choices, etc) All the graphics are sized so they will lay on top of one another seamlessly but I don't know how to Action Script 3 the buttons so you can click on (ex: rim1, or rim2 , etc and see how it looks on car by pulling up the photo on top of the existing background car photo) .</p>

<p>How would I Action Scrip my ""color button"" to come up with 10 color swatches I’ve designed and then when you click on the color swatch (ex: red). It will then put the graphic red of the car body that I have already made on top of the existing background photo of the car and so on for each color button? Thanks for the help in advance!</p>

<p>The query I'm trying to do has to match up Buyers of same itemId with Sellers of same itemId.<br>
Has to make sure both Buyer and Seller didn't have aborted boolean set on their item.
Also process Buyers who paying more then what the Seller wants first.<br>
Also check to make sure the amount Seller is selling hasn't been sold yet.<br>
Also check to make sure the amount Buyer is buying hasn't been bought yet.<br>
As well as process 100 sales per batch.<br></p>

<p>Query below works great for the most part.<br></p>

<p>Problem I'm trying to fix in the query is to make it more intelligent with mathematics.<br>
Lets say Selling table had playerHash 1 and playerHash 2<br>
itemId 8 with amount 100 and sold 1 listed by playerHash lets say 1.<br>
itemId 8 with amount 100 and sold 1 listed by playerHash lets say 2.<br>
Now there is 1 Buyer called playerHash 3 who is buying same itemId 8 and amount 100.<br></p>

<p>Problem now is <br>
playerHash1 can't sell all his 100 amount of itemId 8 because he only has 99 left (sold 1)<br>
playerHash2 can't sell all his 100 amount of itemId 8 because he only has 99 left (sold 1) same story<br></p>

<p>Now the query should return<br>
playerHash 1 selling to playerHash3 buyer with a new column to the end of row called something like willBuyAmount set it to 99<br>
Next row should know that playerHash 1 has sold = 100 (without updating the database and without changing sold column in previous row)<br>
Dsplay that playerHash 2 selling to playerHash3 buyer with a new coulmn to the end of row called something like willBuyAmount set it to 1.<br>
playerHash2 should still be able to know by now that it has 98 left (sold 1) + 1 temporary somewhere idk clone the tables maybe?<br>
and for future buyers of same itemId and >= price should be able to buy just 98 of this item amount left from playerHash2.<br></p>

<p>Here is the math I want to put into the query<br></p>

<pre><code>VAR amountBuyerNeeds = (B.amount - B.bought)
VAR amountSellerStock = (S.amount - S.sold)
//update these values in the simulated cloned table data.
B.bought = IF(amountBuyerNeeds &gt; amountSellerStock, (B.bought + amountSellerStock), B.amount)
S.sold = IF(amountSellerStock &gt; amountBuyerNeeds, (S.sold + amountBuyerNeeds), S.amount)
//to real row print out
willBuyAmount = IF(amountBuyerNeeds &gt; amountSellerStock, amountSellerStock, amountBuyerNeeds)
</code></pre>

<p>Query ATM looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT S.itemId AS sell_itemId,
       S.amount AS sell_amount,
       S.price AS sell_price,
       S.sold AS sell_sold,

       Selling AS S

<pre><code>context.Employees.Where(e =&gt; GetValidEmployeeIds().Contains(e.EmployeeId));

<p>The function GetValidEmployeeIds is the function that is returning the IEnumerable. The result of this function isn't something that I can get from the database - I pretty much have to get it externally from the EDM.</p>

<p>My question is: Is there anything I can do to instruct Linq to Entities to not parse the function as part of the expression? To instead parse the result of the function. I was hoping there was an attribute I could decorate the method with but haven't been able to find one.</p>

<p>Normally, I would be fine with just breaking out the call and not using it directly in the expression. However, I'm going to be using this call a lot and was hoping to clean up the code a bit. </p>

<p>What I'd like to do is to change the color of my texture where it is gray to a color I receive as a parameter. The shader worked perfectly before, but now, it seems that I need to add a Vertex Shader - what does not make any sense to me. So I wrote this:</p>

<pre><code>void main() {
    gl_Position = ftransform();
}
</code></pre>

<p>That, according to the internet, is the simplest possible VS: it does nothing, and it really shouldn't. But it doesn't work: nothing is displayed, and no compilation errors or warnings are thrown. I tried to replace my Fragment Shader with a simpler one, but the results were even stranger:</p>

<pre><code>void main() {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This should only paint everything in red. But when I run, the program crashes, no error is thrown, no Exception, very odd behavior. I know that libGDX adds tilting, but I don't think it would work either, because I need to replace only the gray-scale colors, and depending on the intensity, I need to correctly modulate the correct color (that is varying). Another shader I am using (Fragment only, again) is to set the entire scene to gray-scale (when on the pause menu). It won't work either.</p>

<p>I can find all sorts of crazy info on sending cURL requests to a site and have them send back a response and processing that response.</p>

<p>My question is I want to BE the site that receives this cURL requests. How do you set up a page to process those types of requests? How does it work?</p>

<p>I ask because in the near future I will need to integrate this into a project I'm working on. Other sites will send me info that I'll need to process and store in a database. Ideally, I'll probably need something to handle HTTP POST requests and obviously I'll need to know what security measures I'll need to take as well. It also would be nice to know how to fire back a response to the person who's making the request. I also will need to know how to configure user authentication....such as with:</p>

<pre><code>curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_USERPWD, ""Username:Password"");
</code></pre>

<p>I feel silly asking, but I can't figure out the right search keywords to use to look up this kind of info. Even just a link to a relevant site would be appreciated.</p>

I have written an HTML form that I will use PHP to process later, but I have some options in the form that a user can choose. Here is the HTML code</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for=""FIELD6""&gt;Model Type: &lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=""radio"" id=""basemodel"" name=""FIELD6"" value=""Normal Model""  checked  onclick=""doMath()"" /&gt;Normal Model&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=""radio"" id=""workshopmodel"" name=""FIELD6"" value=""Workshop Model"" onclick=""doMath()"" data-clicked=""no"" /&gt;Workshop Model
&lt;p id=""total""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the user can choose between a Normal and Workshop Model. I am trying to set it so that when the user checks the workshopmodel radio button, it adds to the total price (specified in paragraph tags). Here is my attempt at my barely-known language, jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>function doMath() {
    var basePrice = 15;
    var baseModel = 0;
    var customModel = 5;
    var modelTotal = ;
    function workshopModel() {
        if(getElementById(""workshopmodel"").click(function() {
            modelTotal = basePrice + customModel;
        }
    }
    function defaultModel() {
        if(getElementById(""basemodel"").click(function() {
            modelTotal = total basePrice + baseModel;
        }
    }
}
$(""#total"").html('&lt;font color=""black""&gt;Total Price:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=""#09ff00""&gt;' +  workshopModel() + '');
</code></pre>

<p>So I am trying to make it add to the basePrice in real time, and then print it in place of the ID marked ""total"" every time the user makes a change in selection (in real-time). So if the user chooses workshopmodel, the script will add 15 and 5, resulting in 20, and if they choose basemodel, the script will add 15 and 0, resulting in 15. I left the variable modelTotal undefined as it should be defined later on in the script. Can anyone help me out with this?</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning is that when it's a single auto-width post (such as if you click on 'Blog'), it all stays on one line as it loads, meaning it correctly calculates with one auto-width class, just not when there are multiple on the page. The code for initialization is:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#content"").smoothDivScroll({

I want this date to not be changed once set, I want it to be a UTC date. I want to NOT use a constructor as I a have many entities in my model that I want to inherit from an abstract class containing the CreatedDate property and I can't enforce a constructor with an interface.</p>

<p>I have tried different data annotations and I have attempted to write a database initializer that would pick up a specific entity type and write an alter constraint with a getdate() default value for the correct table_name and column_name, but I have not been able to write that code correctly. Please do not refer me to the <a href=""http://auditdbcontext.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/18413#215563"">
AuditDbContext - Entity Framework Auditing Context</a> or the <a href=""https://github.com/loresoft/EntityFramework.Extended"">EntityFramework.Extended</a> tools they do not do what I need here.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>My CreatedDate is null on SaveChanges() because I am passing a ViewModel to my view and that ViewModel correctly has no Audit property called CreatedDate in it. And even if I passed the model to my view I am not editing or storing the CreatedDate in the view. I read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6564772/ef-code-first-readonly-column"">here</a> that I could add the [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)] and this would tell EF to store the CreatedDate correctly after Insert and Update but not allow it to be changed by my application but I just get a ""Cannot insert explicit value for identity column in table when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to OFF"" error by adding this attribute.</p>

<p>Gavick News Show Pro is a module for listing latest news on the homepage. The links it creates to interior pages includes aliases with the comma which we need to get stripped.</p>

<p>In the Gavick code it gets links this way:</p>

<p><code>$link = ($news_id !== 0) ? JRoute::_(ContentHelperRoute::getArticleRoute($news_id, $news_cid)) : JRoute::_('index.php?option=com_user&amp;view=login');</code></p>

<p>Which produces a link such as:</p>

<p><a href=""http://example.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=655:test,ting-here&amp;catid=22:112th-news&amp;Itemid=130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=655:test,ting-here&amp;catid=22:112th-news&amp;Itemid=130</a></p>

<p>To note, SEF is not enabled on this site, and cannot be for security reasons. Hopefully rather than a discussion about our particular security requriments someone will be able to help resolve our issue.</p>

<p>Is there another method to get $link other than JRoute that will not include those aliases in the title? Example code would be great. Thank you!</p>

<p>Note to simplify, this code always does the same thing:</p>

Eventually i would like to be able to use the same logic to increment the score by 'x' amount after all different time periods. At the moment, the score is being incremented by 10 but 60 times a second (due to the update method being called 60 times a second). This means the score ends up being 560 instead of just 10.</p>

<p>I was thinking of trying to use variables such as <code>isPreviousScoreChanged</code> and <code>isCurrentScoreChanged</code>, like when detecting if a button has been pressed and released, however this isn't working too well either.</p>

<p>I am using the <code>Stopwatch</code> class to keep track of the amount of seconds gone by since the start of the game.</p>

<p>the code is pretty much:</p>

<pre><code>if (Stopwatch.ElapsedTicks == 5)
{
    playerScore += 10;

<p>I have a table to add devices of GCM (Google Cloud Messaging). After save the Model I do a SELECT in this table to get all <code>devide_id</code> of GCM saved and send the push notifications. The field <code>device_id</code> is unique in table. After to select I do a <code>foreach</code> to get devices and send the notifications, but this always repeating and send a lot of push to the same <code>device_id</code>.</p>

<p>My application uses Forms authentication and that is working perfectly for controllers/actions. For example if I decorate either a controller or an action with the attribute below only members of the administrators group can view them:</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize(Roles=""Administrators"")]
</code></pre>

<p>However I have a folder under the default Scripts folder called Admin. I only want members of the Administrators group to be able to access scripts within this directory so I created a new web.config in the directory with the following inside:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;system.web&gt;
    &lt;authorization&gt;
      &lt;allow roles=""Administrators""/&gt;
      &lt;deny users=""*""/&gt;
    &lt;/authorization&gt;
  &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However no matter whether a user is a member of the Administrators group or not they receive a 302 Found message and are then redirected to the login page.</p>

<p>If I change the web.config to <code>allow user=""*""</code> then it works. It also works if I add an <code>allow users=""Username""</code> for a specific user I am testing with.</p>

<p>Any ideas on where I'm going wrong or where I could start investigating?</p>

<p>My problem is that I can not get the expression to write out so that 2 is a superscript of R.

<p>If I have my Facebook 'Tab' Url as follows:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.facebook.com/pages/PAGE_TITLE/PAGE_ID?sk=app_APP_ID
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do is add an extra parameter on the end as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;WT.mc_id=email-uk-8014
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this is for tracking purposes and links will be sent out of the form</p>

<pre><code>http://www.facebook.com/pages/PAGE_TITLE/PAGE_ID?sk=app_APP_ID&amp;WT.mc_id=email-uk-8014
</code></pre>

<p>and the extra parameter will allow us to track the campaign id.</p>

<p>As you can see I have no way of knowing the value of the parameter beforehand as it depends on the link clicked by the user so is it possible to somehow get the value of the <code>WT.mc_id</code> parameter inside my iframe app?</p>

<p>So far, I've got saving, using Properties:</p>

<pre><code>Properties prop = new Properties();                   
prop.setProperty(""a"", Boolean.valueOf(boxRandomMouse.isSelected()).toString());  
prop.setProperty(""b"", listModelPath.toString());
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I've got here, is that I am saving <code>listModelPath</code> of my <code>JList</code> into <code>String</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public static DefaultListModel&lt;String&gt; listModelPath;   
</code></pre>

<p>In my file under property <code>b</code>. I can't find any way to load back and parse this <code>listModelPath</code> into my desired type, which is <code>Position</code>.</p>

<p>The class, <code>Position</code>, can be initialised with below constractor:</p>

<pre><code>Position newPos = new Position(int x, int y, int z);
</code></pre>

<p>or for array:</p>

<pre><code>public Position[] toTown = new Position[] {
            new Position(3094, 3491, 0), new Position(3088, 3487, 0),
            new Position(3080, 3475, 0)};
</code></pre>

<p>This is how the <code>String</code> of <code>listModelPath</code> looks when It's been saved into the file</p>

<pre><code>c=[[x\=3094, y\=3491, z\=0], [x\=3092, y\=3491, z\=0], [x\=3090, y\=3491, z\=0], [x\=3088, y\=3490, z\=0], [x\=3086, y\=3488, z\=0], [x\=3084, y\=3486, z\=0], [x\=3082, y\=3484, z\=0], [x\=3081, y\=3482, z\=0], [x\=3080, y\=3481, z\=0], [x\=3080, y\=3479, z\=0], [x\=3080, y\=3477, z\=0], [x\=2045, y\=5194, z\=0], [x\=2044, y\=5192, z\=0], [x\=2042, y\=5190, z\=0], [x\=2041, y\=5189, z\=0]]
</code></pre>

<p>I need to figure out a way to parse the String above, into my Positions, or somehow find a way to save this array to a File, which I honestly have no idea how to do.</p>

<p>I've tried doing this numerously on different ways, always failing, so that's why I'm here.
Hopefully you guys knows how to handle a situation I have here.</p>

<p>PS. I have just started reading about serialization, perhaps it is the way to go? Would it allow me to save the array I have dynamically created in the application in the file without converting it to string and back from string?</p>

At the moment I've ""corrupted"" the plugin by modifying my CordovaActivity function manually.

<p>To do this, I need to transfer callbacks to <code>onActivityResult</code> initiated via <code>startResolutionForResult</code> into a plugin-specific function.

<p>Can anyone think of a mechanism to do this?</p>

<p>Here is my CordovaActivity code and my plugin code.</p>

<p>I have read many docs,google,forums trying to understand how components load and where to place them such as stores, models, ect but still confused.</p>

<p>This is an example I am trying to get working</p>

<p>Application description</p>

<p>Main menu with Contacts,Projects,People ect ect, app first loads to display a static non data-driven, then use clicks on Contacts which displays a grid with list of contacts.  User then clicks on a contact row and popup edit view is displayed.</p>

<p>In contacteditview the contact is loaded into the form in addition the form has a combobox that loads ContactTypes store.  The ContactType should be set to contacttype value for that contact record.</p>

<p>What is the common way to do this considering this is a large application and I only want to load the data when it is need ie the view is displayed.</p>

<p>Here are some of my confusions</p>

<p>1) You can define all of you Controllers, Stores, Models, Views in the app config, but then everything is loaded no matter what page you are looking at.  In addition if you have autoLoad: true on your stores then calls for all the stores are made to the database even though you are not looking at that particular view.</p>

<p>2)When you specify a store or model in the stores or models property in your controller, what exactly does that do?  Is it just letting you easily reference the store but not actually creating it or does it create it or is it just setting getter and setter functions for convienance.  Example if I specify a store in the store property of my controller and have autoLoad true all data is loaded with no need to do anything else.  But what I really want is for that store to only load when I click on Contact and the list view is displayed.  So I set autoLoad:false and in my list function I manually get store using this.getStore('Contacts'). This works fine, but what is purpose of using stores and models array property of controller.  I see in debugger that if I do not use the store/model properties a get request is made for those js files.</p>

<p>Sorry I know this is alot but it is very confusing to me and have been struggling with it for awhile.</p>

<p>3)Lastly, I have the Contact grid loading only when you click on the Contacts button by setting autoLoad:false and manually loading.  Now when a user clicks edit the record loads fine but how do I get the combobox to load and then select the correct value.  I think part of my problem is understanding how stores models get loaded and instantiated.  In my combobox store property I have specified ContactType as the store but I get error store undefined, so either the js file is not loaded or store is not instantiated.</p>

<p>Here is my code so far.</p>

Example:</p>

<pre><code>void myFunction(std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; &amp;my_reference)

<p>Then I have a container, like this:</p>

<pre><code>class IoC
{
  protected $db;

  public static function newPost()
  {
     $post = new Post(); // Instantiate post class so we can use the methods in there
     $input = $post-&gt;getInput(); // Method that gets the POST values
     $post-&gt;insertInput($input, $db); // Method that adds the post values to a database
  }
}
//Call IoC::newPost(); on the page the form submits to
</code></pre>

<p>This is the <code>Post</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>class Post
{
  protected $db;

  public function __construct($db)
  {
    $this-&gt;db = $db;
  }

  public function getInput()
  {
    // Should I get the post input here? Like $_POST['title'] etc. and put it 
    // into an array and then return it?
    return $input;
  }

  public function insertIntoDB($db, $input)
  {
    // Should I hardcode the connection and query here?
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I'm confused as to where the connection should come from. Thinking about it I guess it would be sensible to have a separate, re-usable <code>Database</code> class that creates the connections and call that class in the container?</p>

<p>I really don't know, feel free to tell me how you would do it and give examples if you have any.</p>

"14062563","1","14130054","","2012-12-27 23:17:53","","6","790","<p>I'm using a native DLL. I'm not sure, but I think I can't use PInvoke decl's with it since it does not export any functions and does not have a manifest. The DLL is delivered with a header file, explaining how to use it. The header file defines countless structs, enums and one class to be constructed using a factory method which is accessed via a Windows function <code>::GetProcAddress</code> (security through obscurity).
This class holds functions I would like to use in managed code.</p>

<p>I have successfully wrapped the class in a CLI ref class and can call trivial methods on it, wrapping those as well.</p>

<p>I'm going through the process of converting some structs from the header file to managed structs. For example, Native structs:</p>

<pre><code>struct FooACL{
    int               action;                
    unsigned long     from,to;               
    char              comment[64]; 
    int               reserved[17];          
};
</code></pre>

<p>Turns into managed struct:</p>

<pre><code>[StructLayout(LayoutKind::Sequential, CharSet = CharSet::Ansi)]
public value struct ManagedFooACL{
     int   action;                
     int   from,to;     
     [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType::ByValTStr, SizeConst = 64)]
     String^    comment;
     [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType::ByValArray, SizeConst = 17)]
     array&lt;int&gt;^ reserved;
};
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can tell this should make the managed struct blittable? And any other struct that follows a similar pattern or levels of nested structure. As long as a layout is specified and none blittable are adorned with MarshalAs, will the structure as a whole be blittable?</p>

<p>And so, I'm attempting to see if there is a way to use <code>Marshal::Copy</code> or <code>Marshal::PtrToStructure</code> to convert an <code>FooACL*</code> array to <code>array&lt;ManagedFooACL&gt;^</code>.</p>

<p>I get the FooACL* array from a function call; I do not allocate it myself.</p>

<pre><code>int total;
FooACL* foos = unamagedClass-&gt;GetFooACLS(&amp;total);
</code></pre>

<p><code>total</code> is an in/out that gets the size of the array returned.</p>

<p>What I managed to do so far, and what work is:</p>

<pre><code>ManagedFooACL first = static_cast&lt;ManagedFooACL&gt;(Marshal::PtrToStructure(IntPtr(&amp;foos [0]), ManagedFooACL::typeid));
</code></pre>

<p>What I can't wrap my mind around is why this does not:</p>

<pre><code>array&lt;ManagedFooACL&gt;^ mfoos = gcnew array&lt;ManagedFooACL&gt;(total);
Marshal::PtrToStructure(IntPtr(&amp;foos), mfoos);
</code></pre>

<p>This throws a:</p>

<pre><code>System.ArgumentException was unhandled
  Message=The specified structure must be blittable or have layout information.
Parameter name: structure
  Source=mscorlib
  ParamName=structure
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to copy array data in one call or do I really need to do a for loop?  It seems kind of silly with all this marshaling capability.</p>

I'd like to avoid that throttling.</p>

<p>The target framerate is unchanged throughout the life of the application. Both <code>backgroundFrameRate</code> and <code>frameRate</code> are set to 24 and do not change.

<p>I never see this problem--even if the application is inactive--if something is visibly happening in the window; if I set a Timer to change a label's text every second, the throttling never occurs. If I cover up the label, the throttling reoccurs.</p>

<p>Is the throttling really the result of not having anything to render? If so, is there another way to avoid this throttling that won't require that the window remain visible?</p>

<p>The JMS connection is working fine. I have successfully configured, subscribed to, and tested a JMS topic. Here is that code:</p>

<pre><code>final String topic = ... ;
final InitialContext context = new InitialContext();
PrivilegedAction&lt;JmsConnectionContext&gt; action = new PrivilegedAction&lt;JmsConnectionContext&gt;() {

    @Override

return AccessController.doPrivileged(action);
</code></pre>

<p>And my JNDI properties configuration is very straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>java.naming.factory.initial=org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory
java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming
java.naming.provider.url=10.1.3.143:1099
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the jars have all been signed using our company certificate, which was issued via a CA (set to expire within the next few months, but it's still valid). I've also tried clearing the <code>javaws</code> cache to make sure it wasn't an outdated code issue.</p>

<p>So why is the warning still coming up? I'm running it as a privileged action which, as far as I understand, should just grant the code the <code>all-permissions</code> policy from the JNLP file, but yet when <code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPChannel.checkConnectPermission()</code> gets called during the JNDI lookup, the JWS security manager brings up the security warning. Is there something else I have to configure for the JNDI lookups to have elevated connection privileges, and can I configure that over Java Web Start?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I'm still dealing with this problem. I narrowed down the dialog to coming up when it tries to access the RMI port on the server (it's checking permission<code>host:1098</code>). I tried setting the <code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> property to <code>host</code>, going off of the workaround listed in <a href=""http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6533026"" rel=""nofollow"">this bug report</a>. Since the first RMI lookup doesn't happen until after the client is already started, I assume that I don't need to find a way to add it to the JNLP file via a <code>&lt;property&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the stack trace from when I click ""cancel"" in the security warning:</p>

<p>So the problem is specific to RMI access. Why doesn't setting the hostname work to fix the dialog, as suggested in the workaround in the linked bug report and a few other resources I have found? Is there any other workaround to fix this?</p>

<p>The way it works is that I have created two instances of <code>multiprocessing.Queue</code> - one for sending work tasks to the workers and another to receive the results back.</p>

<p>Each worker just sits in a permanently running loop like this:</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    try:
        request = self.request_queue.get(True, 5)
    except Queue.Empty:
        continue
    else:
        result = request.callable(*request.args, **request.kwargs)
        self.results_queue.put((request, result))
</code></pre>

<p>There is also some error-handling code, but I have left it out for brewity. Each worker process has <code>daemon</code> set to <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>I wish to properly shutdown the main process and all child worker processes. My experiences so far (doing Ctrl+C):</p>

<ul>
<li>With no special implementations, each child process stops/crashes with a KeyboardInterrupt traceback, but the main process does not exist and have to be killed (<code>sudo kill -9</code>).</li>
<li>If I implement a signal handler for the child processes, set to ignore SIGINT's, the main thread shows the KeyboardInterrupt tracebok but nothing happens either way.</li>
<li>If I implement a signal handler for the child processes and the main process, I can see that the signal handler is called in the main process, but calling <code>sys.exit()</code> does not seem to have any effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am looking for a ""best practice"" way of handling this. I also read somewhere that shutting down processes that were interacting with <code>Queue</code>s and <code>Pipe</code>s might cause them to deadlock with other processes (due to the Semaphores and other stuff used internally).</p>

<p>My current approach would be the following:
- Find a way to send an internal signal to each process (using a seperate command queue or similar) that will terminate their main loop.
- Implement a signal handler for the main loop that sends the shutdown command. The child processes will have a child handler that sets them to ignore the signal.</p>

<p>Is this the right approach?</p>

<p>Simple interface that I have used with Entity Framework 4.0 is following. The find members are the problematic area for me. I don't have a clue how to proceed with them with mongodb context.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class
{

    void Remove(T entity);
    IQueryable&lt;T&gt; Find(Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt; predicate);
    //IQueryable&lt;T&gt; FindAll();

}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a very simple model that is called Hero its drive from ImongoEntity which provides a member called accessId.</p>

<pre><code>public class Hero : MongoDB.Kennedy.IMongoEntity
{
    public ObjectId _id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Alias { get; set; }
    public string _accessId { get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Context class is very simple you can see the collection of Heros exposted as IQueryable property.</p>

<pre><code>public class MongoDataConetext: MongoDB.Kennedy.ConcurrentDataContext
{
    public MongoDataConetext(string databaseName, string serverName=""localhost"") : base(databaseName, serverName)
    {
    }

    public IQueryable&lt;Hero&gt; Heros {
        get {
            return base.GetCollection&lt;Hero&gt;().AsQueryable();
        }
    }
}

It would be cool great if you could help me. What is important to me is to decide which actions happen. The event listeners for each action can be implemented later easily. The function should only simulate the game results and comments to happening actions. There is no 2D/3D graphics needed. We're talking about games like <a href=""http://www.hattrick.org/"">Hattrick</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I would propose that you have an array of minutes with actions at first.</p>

<p>$minutes = array(1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13, ..., 90, 92);</p>

<p>For each of these minutes, you could then simulate an attack.</p>

<p>The attacking team is determined by dice before: $attacking = mt_rand(1, 2);</p>

<p>So the part which is most important to me is the attack function.</p>

<p>Please edit my approach or use it as a sample. Can you help me to improve this? The function should be complex so that the results are as realistic as possible. But you need to find something between high predictability and too random results. I only want to improve this function.</p>

<p><strong>Tactical settings which should have an influence on the randomness:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>adjustment (1=defensive, 2=neutral, 3=offensive): the higher the value is the weaker is the defense and the stronger is the offense</li>
<li>speed of play (1=slow, 2=medium, 3=fast): the higher the value is the better are the opportunities but the higher is the risk of getting a quick counter attack</li>
<li>distance of passes (1=short, 2=medium, 3=long): the higher the value is the less but better opportunities you get and the more often you are offside</li>
<li>creation of changes (1=safe, 2=medium, 3=risky): the higher the value is the better are your opportunities but the higher is the risk of getting a quick counter attack</li>
<li>pressure in defense (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high): the higher the value is the more quick counter attacks you will have</li>
<li>aggressivity (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high): the higher the value is the more attacks you will stop by fouls</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Integration of the tactical settings:</strong></p>

<p>All the tactical settings have a value which can be ""1"", ""2"" or ""3"". ""2"" is always neutral/medium. So I divide the values by 2. I get a ratio which is 0.5 or 1 or 1.5. I thought that I could then easily multiply the chances by this in order to integrate tactical influence. But one problem has evolved: If I multiply a chance by 2 or more tactical values, it can be higher than 100% (60 x 1.5 x 1.5 for example). So I can't integrate the tactics this way. What else can I do?</p>

I have found some answers, but none of them seem to be ""proper"" or best practice. Consider this scenario. Let's say we're building a 20 page website. I want the footer to appear on all pages and be the same on all 20 pages. This is a static, generic HTML website. I would like to put the </p>

<pre><code>&lt;footer&gt;

<p>markup in say a footer.html (or whatever ext.) so that I can just add it to the bottom of the pages. Then when I need to make changes, I only have to change a single footer.html (or whatever...) file. </p>

<p>This is simple enough using jquery. </p>

<pre><code>$('whatever').html('content');
</code></pre>

<p>Which works... but requires loading jquery. Not usually a problem if we're using Bootstrap or Foundation since they require it any ways and you can locally run the js and css files needed for both.</p>

<p>We can try this one...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;object name=""whatever"" type=""text/html"" data=""whatever.html""&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And that kind of works. You have to add the stylesheet to the whatever.html file so that is not efficient. </p>

<pre><code>document.write
</code></pre>

<p>Is a dead horse. </p>

<p>And just to be clear, let's pretend that putting this on a server is just not a possibility. </p>

<p>Does anybody out there have a solution for something simple like this that would be effective?</p>

<pre><code>const void* iv = malloc(kCCBlockSizeAES128);
// EDIT:
//if (!iv) {
//    iv = NULL;
//}
</code></pre>

<p>and then I create the cryptor object:</p>

<pre><code>CCCryptorRef cryptor;
CCCryptorStatus cryptStatus = CCCryptorCreate(operation, kCCAlgorithmAES128, kCCOptionPKCS7Padding,
                                                  keyPtr, kCCKeySizeAES256,
                                                  iv,
                                                  &amp;cryptor);
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that encryption this way seems to fail (sad face...). I mean: it encrypts with no apparent problem, but it decrypts data different than the original. I though this would work because when you <code>malloc()</code> memory, it is not written all to zeros, it is random. I also tried writing random values myself but my C background is failing really hard. If there is a function (like <code>bzero</code>) that writes random bytes please tell me.</p>

<p>I also tried doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>char* iv = malloc(kCCBlockSizeAES128);
int i;
srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));
for (i = 0; i &lt; kCCBlockSizeAES128; i++) {
    iv[i] = (char)rand()%256;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ohh, by the way, I realise this must be a very nooby question :)</p>

<p>In the end all I want is something like <code>const void* iv = malloc(kCCBlockSizeAES128)</code> that after some operations I am sure it's data is completely random. Any ideas on that?</p>

<p>PS: I only provided the crypto/Objective-C background so you know what I need this for. I think that won't influence a thing. kCCBlockSizeAES128 = 16 (90% sure :)</p>

<h2>EDIT:</h2>

<p>Allright! After <em>some</em> deugging I'm happy to announce that the problem I was having with the encryption &amp; decryption was due to a bug in another part of my program I have now solved. So all I need to figure now is how to fill the iv with random bytes. Some options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use malloc(), which returns junk, not random bytes -> potentially insecure <strong>(?)</strong></li>
<li>Use arc4random_buf(), which is exactly what I want except it only works 10.7+ and my mac is 10.6.6 (plus I want to support 10.6)</li>
<li>Something else I haven't considered...? <strong>&lt;-- help here!</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>EDIT 2:</h2>

<p>Allright! After filling the iv with some test data (all zeros, all ones, etc) and <em>some more</em> deugging I'm <strong>NOT</strong> happy to announce that ccrypto doesn't seem to be working in some conditions. I'll explain how:</p>

<p>Whenever I feed the crypto a zeroed iv or NULL (same thing for crypto) it works. For example, this works well when encrypting and decrypting:</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t iv[kCCBlockSizeAES128];
int i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; kCCBlockSizeAES128; i++) {
    iv[i] = 0x0; // I know this is the same as doing: memset((void *)iv, 0x0, (size_t)sizeof(iv));
}

CCCryptorRef cryptor;
CCCryptorStatus cryptStatus = CCCryptorCreate(operation, kCCAlgorithmAES128,
                                              kCCOptionPKCS7Padding,
                                              (const void *)keyPtr, kCCKeySizeAES256,
                                              iv,
                                              &amp;cryptor);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> when I feed him a iv in which at least ONE of it's bytes is NOT zero, encryption/decryption do not provide errors but decrypting doesn't yield the original data. For example, this...</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t iv[kCCBlockSizeAES128];
int i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; kCCBlockSizeAES128; i++) {
    iv[i] = 0x1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>or for completely random data...</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t iv[kCCBlockSizeAES128];
int i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; kCCBlockSizeAES128; i++) {
    iv[i] = arc4random() % 256;
}
</code></pre>

Sometimes I get interested in this or that Linux project, usually coming as a git or svn repository... The problem is that I usually clone the repo, I try to configure it, I install all the needed libraries (and this takes ages), maybe finally I succeed... but then make fails or configure itself fails, complaining about some tool that is missing. Or maybe I installed two versions of the same library and the configure script gets the wrong one, or boring problems like this. 
Anyway, I see loads of people using those tools everyday, so it must not be so difficult after all!</p>

<p>Can you point out resources that may help in the first steps?</p>

<p>How do you check in ruby if a variable has length?</p>

<p>If I use <code>@dvds.length?</code> I get an error <code>undefined method length for ...</code> when it doesn't have a length. </p>

<p>Basically I've got some searches that mostly retrieve an ActiveRecord:Relation, but one or two simply return one entry since they search by id. I have things like:</p>

<pre><code>@total = @dvds.length
</code></pre>

<p>To show how many we've found.</p>

<p>When @dvds does not contain any length, I get an error for undefined method. I did something like:</p>

<pre><code>if @dvds.class == 'ActiveRecord:Relation' 
</code></pre>

<p>to get around one error, but this is horrible and prone to more errors. </p>

<p>There has got to be a Ruby way of checking whether a variable has length or not that is a lot prettier and easier no?</p>

<p>Ideally I'm looking for something like:</p>

<pre><code>@total = @dvds.length if @dvds.length
</code></pre>

<p>Or similar. </p>

<p>I was thinking it was an android version feature and now I am more secure it is. I tried using the emulator in those version and the result was the same. It's an android version problem.</p>

<p>Here I attach the images, so it could be clear what's the problem.</p>

<p>If I click the back button at this position, it takes me out of the app to the home screen.
That is with the Galaxy S3</p>

<p>But with the android 2.3.5, this is how it works.</p>

<p>In the 2.3.5 version, I click back, an every activity is back at the foreground.
Any clue about that problem?</p>

They all run Debian. We want to achieve this in Java. Application will be killed under some conditions. We want to automatically restart the application. We only have user rights, so we can't install it as a service.</p>

<p>Details:
We want to run an application on every computer that waits for tasks to run. 
Problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>if a process occupies too much processor time it will be killed. </li>
<li>after 7 days every process is killed. </li>
<li>Some computers don't run 24h/7 and do shutdown at night.st </li>
</ul>

<p>Goal: How to run an application on 150 computers and automatically start the application again, if it is shutdown?</p>

<p>My idea: The computers are server and clients for tcp connections and send alive packets. If computer B doesn't get an alive message from A within a time period, it will restart the application at computer A.</p>

<p>Problem of my idea:
150x149 alive messages is too much traffic, even so it's Gigabit LAN.</p>

<p>idea 2:
They share the same disk. We can create a folder for just this application to access. But i rather don't like to write in a file the machine name of the server, and if the server crashes the first one that realizes this writes his machine name into it, if it's not the server's machine name. All others will look into this file, if they can't connect to the server.</p>

The relation based on the keys is many-to-many, but it's actually zero-or-one-to-many relation made unique by a fixed value in the shared table.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Table1; field:code, ...</p>

<p>Table2; field:code, ...</p>

<p>SharedTable; key1:code, key2:tablename, ...</p>

<p>If I use the EF designer to model this, I can only use the Table1:code to SharedTable:key1 for the assiociation, resulting in a many-to-many relation which is not allowed. </p>

<p>Is there any way to 'model' these associations to include a fixed value for SharedTable:key2, or force many-to-many relations to be allowed, so I could add the 'where key2=tablename' and ' manually for example?</p>

<p>Of course I could always resort to dropping the associations and joining manually...</p>

I currently have a background process that handles reading data to and from the card and storing it for processing, but I'd like to be able to shut down power to the card when my application is not running. I've done some investigating, and while WMI evidently does support the <code>CIM_PCMCIAController</code> profile in its <code>WIN32_PCMCIAController</code> implementation, the <code>SetPowerState()</code> and <code>Reset()</code> functions are not implemented. Does anyone know of a way (with or without WMI) to control the power state of the slot? I need to be able to programatically both power off and power on either the slot or the card.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Several people I've spoken to have suggested adding a function to the card that would facilitate this. Unfortunately modifying the card to provide this sort of functionality really isn't an option right now.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>I've confirmed that the device does show up in the Device Manager under the ""Multifunction adapters"" category, though neither disabling the device nor the PCMCIA controller itself from here has any effect on the power of the card.</p>

<p>The infile can be whatever you want it to be, and all characters will be shown, but the "" will not be typed. I don't know if the <code>type()</code> method is ever accessed in its case.
Here is an example input:</p>

<pre><code>""Hi, my name is koikoi.""
</code></pre>

<p>The output comes out like this:</p>

<pre><code>Hi, my name is koikoi.
</code></pre>

<p>When it should have the quotations on it. The typer does not recognize/read them. I can't find any flaws in my code and would like some advice. I can add the main method if requested.</p>

<p>Through some research I have ascertained that the package SVGMapping would have gotten me part way there however this package has been removed from the CRAN repository and I am therefore wary about using it for anything I may come to rely on.</p>

<p>Because SVG is XML, my plan is to use the XML package to alter attributes of my SVG file. I then want to call inkscape using the shell function to convert the SVG to a PNG.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble navigating the XML structure. As you can see in the SVG below, I have created three rectangles with different colours. I'd like to change the colours using R.</p>

<p>I can read in the SVG and navigate to the attributes using the following:</p>

<pre><code>doc &lt;- xmlTreeParse(""c:\\Temp\\drawing.svg"", getDTD = F)
doc$children$svg$children$g$children[1]$rect$attributes
</code></pre>

<p>I can then pull out all the style information using:</p>

<pre><code>doc$children$svg$children$g$children[1]$rect$attributes[""style""]
</code></pre>

<p>But then the result of this is just a character string containing values for fill, stroke, opacity etc.</p>

<pre><code>""fill:#00ffff;fill-opacity:1;stroke:#000000;stroke-width:2;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:none"" 
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to select a single one of the style attributes, such as fill, so I can put a new colour code in?</p>

<p>I'm guessing I may end up using something regular expression based but thought I'd ask to see if there was an alternative (ie simpler!) way to navigate through the style attributes.</p>

<p>After trying several things we're just left at a loss to get the exported animation from blender to load. I have noticed a few differences from the example ""monster.dae"" file in the collada loader. No matter what we've tried the animation just never seems to start.</p>

<p>Other opinions and a second set of knowledgeable eyes would be appreciated. The animations play fine in blender. There are 31 keyframes. There are also no errors on the console.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I think that this issue pertains to these issues with the three.js collada loader.

<p>Am I overlooking a semantic difference between ""Length"" and ""Count"", or did perhaps some implementation detail in the .NET Framework require different names for these similar concepts?

<p>snippet of html I want to use in my pages that Angular will recompile into the above:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;toggle on-text=""On"" off-text=""Off"" ng-model=""myModelName""&gt;&lt;/toggle&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My directive is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>.directive('toggle', function() {
    return {
        restrict: 'AE',
        templateUrl: 'views/toggle.view.html',
        replace: true,
        scope: {
            onText: '@',
            offText: '@',
            ngModel : '=',
        },
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, when looking at the html markup the ng-model attribute has not changed to 'myModelName' and still shows just 'modal' so hasn't updated.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks all</p>

The application then sits around until the server sends data back.  Once the server sends data back I want to read it and write it to a file (easy enough).  </p>

h.putrequest('POST', selector)
h.putheaders(...)
h.endheaders()
h.send(body)

while 1:

  f=open(unique_filename, 'w')
  f.write(r.read())
  f.close()

<p>What I expect is that the app should block in the loop and when data arrives it gets written to the file.  I suspect I'm using <code>read</code> the wrong way, but looking at the httplib source didn't help.</p>

<p>Also, the python documentation site mentions a <code>httplib.fileno()</code> that returns the socket httplib uses.  I'm using 2.7.0 and website doc is for 2.7.2, I can't find the <code>fileno()</code> method.  I suspect taking the socket over httplib and calling <code>recv</code> myself is the best way to go, is that a good idea?</p>

<p>I have two tables, a source table I'm trying to SELECT my data from, and a reference table containing serial #'s and transaction #'s (the source table also has these columns, and more). I want to do two different SELECTs, one where the serial/trans number pair exist in the source table and one where the serial/trans number do not exist. (the combination of serial and trans number are the primary keys for both these tables)</p>

<p>Intially I'm doing this with a join like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM source s
INNER JOIN reference r ON s.serial = r.serial AND s.trans = r.trans
</code></pre>

<p>I would think this should give me everything from the source table that has a serial/trans pair matching with one in the reference table. I'm not positive this is correct, but it is returning a reasonable number of results and I think it looks good.</p>

<p>When I go to do the opposite, get everything from source where the serial/trans pair do not match up with one in reference, I encounter a problem. I tried the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM source s
INNER JOIN reference r ON s.serial &lt;&gt; r.serial AND s.trans &lt;&gt; r.trans
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this the query goes on forever, it starts returning way more results than it should, more than are actually in the entire source table. It eventually ends with an OOM exception, I let it run for 20 min+. For some persepctive the source table I'm dealing with has about 13 million records, and reference table has about 105,000.</p>

<p>So how do I get the results I'm looking for? If it is not already clear, the number of results from the first query + results from second query should equal the total number of records in my source table.</p>

<p>Edit:
I changed it to include the answer and it's still not working as I'm expecting. I added the .AsParallel().WithDegreeOfParallelism(10) to the GetWorkItems() call. Are my expectations incorrect when I think that Parallel should continue to execute even though the base thread is sleeping?</p>

<p>Example: 
I have 15 items, it iterates and grabs 10 items and starts them. As each one finishes, it asks for another one from GetWorkItems until it tries to ask for a 16th item. At that point it should stop trying to grab more items but should continue processing items 11-15 until those are complete. Is that how parallel should be working? Because it's not currently doing that. What it's currently doing is when it completes 6, it locks the subsequent 10 still being run in the Parallel.ForEach.</p>

<p>upper layout contain spinner, set and remove buttons.
bottom layout contain <code>text view</code> and back button.</p>

<p>By default bottom layout is in <code>GONE</code> state and when the user clicks on <code>set</code> button <code>upper</code> layout is <code>GONE</code> and bottom is <code>VISIBLE</code> (clicking on back button in bottom layout will return upper bottom back).</p>

<p>my problem is spinner value is disappear after specific flows:</p>

<p><strong>Flow 1:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Add two items</li>
<li>Click on SET button on the first item</li>
<li>Remove the second item</li>
<li>Click on 'Back' button on the first item</li>

<p><strong>However</strong> it seems that hooking up PowerPivot to an existing analysis services cube is not a solution for ""organisational BI"". It is not always desireable to suck millions of rows into excel at once and the interface between PowerPivot and analysis services is very poor in my book.</p>

<p><strong>Hence the question is</strong> can an existing analysis services solution get the enhanced ui features that power pivot brings, <strong>without</strong> using powerpivot as the design tool? If powerpivot is aimed at self service/personal BI then it seems bizare that the UI for this is better than for bigger/more costly analysis services solutions.</p>

<p>):</p>

<p>From I figured out through trial-and-error that the test crashes at <code>NSArray *matches = [regex matchesInString:sample_uuid options:0 range:searchRange];</code> when it calls <code>enumerateMatchesInString:options:range:usingBlock:</code>. Again, it passes with a different UUID generator that gives the exact same format.</p>

<p>Side notes: This isn't supposed to match type 4 UUIDs that's why the regular expression is as is.</p>

<p>EDIT: When I run xctools from a terminal using <code>xctool -workspace MyApp.xcworkspace -scheme MyApp -sdk iphonesimulator7.1 build test</code> I get the above error. However, when I run the test through XCode I get my UUID in NSLog and it passes.</p>

<p>I removed Repository folder and updated again. Still same issue.
And I am pretty sure that the reason behind this ""$env"" which we actually pass as argument.</p>

<p>In a command prompt, this command works:</p>

<pre><code>mvn clean install -Penv-itt
</code></pre>

<p>but the following command throws the same error as above:</p>

<pre><code>mvn clean install
</code></pre>

<p>So how can I modify the Maven update project to accept arguments or another work-around to get rid of these errors from Eclipse?</p>

<p>I have a very small sample of texts and I'm trying to predict values associated with them. I've used sklearn to calculate tf-idf, and insert those into a regression model for prediction. This gives me 26 samples with 6323 features - not a lot.. I know:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(min_n=1, max_n=1)
&gt;&gt; term_freq = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
&gt;&gt; transformer = TfidfTransformer()
&gt;&gt; X = transformer.fit_transform(term_freq) 
&gt;&gt; print X.shape

(26, 6323)
</code></pre>

<p>Inserting those 26 samples of 6323 features (X) and associated scores (y), into a <code>LinearRegression</code> model, gives good predictions. These are obtained using leave-one-out cross validation, from <code>cross_validation.LeaveOneOut(X.shape[0], indices=True)</code> :</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Pretty good! Using ngrams (n=300) instead of unigrams (n=1), similar results occur, which is obviously not right. No 300-words occur in any of the texts, so the prediction should fail, but it doesn't:</p>

<pre><code>using ngrams (n=300):
      human  machine  points-off  %error
       8.67    7.55    1.12       5.60

std :  1.94    0.08    1.32       6.61
</code></pre>

<p><em><strong>Question 1:</em></strong> This might mean that the prediction model is <strong>overfitting</strong> the data. I only know this because I chose an extreme value for the ngrams (n=300) which I KNOW can't produce good results. But if I didn't have this knowledge, how would you normally tell that the model is over-fitting? In other words, if a reasonable measure (n=1) were used, how would you know that the good prediction was a result of being overfit vs. the model just working well?</p>

<p><em><strong>Question 2:</em></strong> What is the best way of preventing over-fitting (in this situation) to be sure that the prediction results are good or not? </p>

<p><em><strong>Question 3:</em></strong> If <code>LeaveOneOut</code> cross validation is used, how can the model possibly over-fit with good results? Over-fitting means the prediction accuracy will suffer - so why doesn't it suffer on the prediction for the text being left out? The only reason I can think of: in a tf-idf sparse matrix of mainly 0s, there is strong overlap between texts because so many terms are 0s - the regression then thinks the texts correlate highly.</p>

<p>Please answer any of the questions even if you don't know them all. Thanks! </p>

</code></pre>

<p>Then I do a </p>

<pre><code>Company oldCompany = destinationModel.company; // save it before mapper assigns it null

Mapper.Map(sourceViewModel,destinationModel);

//After this piece of line my company in destinationModel will be null because sourceViewModel's company is null. Great!!
//so I assign old company to it

destinationModel.company = oldCompany;

context.Entry(destinationModel).State = EntityState.Modified;

context.SaveChanges();
</code></pre>

<p>And problem is even when I assign oldCompany to my company it is still null in database after savechanges. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>If I change these lines:</p>

<pre><code>destinationModel.company = oldCompany;

context.Entry(destinationModel).State = EntityState.Modified;

context.SaveChanges();

destinationModel.company = oldCompany;

context.Entry(destinationModel).State = EntityState.Modified;

context.SaveChanges();

Here, we want to get all elements in a certain node. In the other Question they want to get the parent node. This is almost the opposite. Here we are not selecting the people node and its children but rather get ever person within a context. I see it might look similar.</p>

<p>Question:
To be clear: I want to do this with XML Reader.</p>

<p>I have got an XML-file and want to retrieve the content of the name-node within the context people. The name-node also appears in cars, that's why I need the context.</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>For example, say I have a function that takes a vector.</p>

<pre><code>void foo(vector&lt;int&gt; x);
</code></pre>

<p>And I want to call it like this (happens to be in Perl)</p>

<pre><code>foo(1,2,3,4);
</code></pre>

<p>The typemap should take arguments ($argnum, ...), gather them into one vector and then pass that to foo.</p>

<p>I have this so far:</p>

<pre><code>typedef vector&lt;int&gt; vectori;
%typemap(in) (vectori) {
  for (int i=$argnum-1; i&lt;items; i++) {
      $1-&gt;push_back( &lt;argv i&gt; );   // This is language dependent, of course.
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would work, except that SWIG checks the number of arguments</p>

<pre><code>if ((items &lt; 1) || (items &gt; 1)) {
  SWIG_croak(""Usage: foo(vectori);"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I do:</p>

<pre><code> void foo(vectori, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>SWIG will expect to call foo with two arguments.</p>

<pre><code> foo(arg1, arg2);
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps there's a way to tell SWIG to suppress arg2 from the call to foo?</p>

<p>I can't use this in my .i:</p>

<pre><code>void foo(...)
</code></pre>

<p>because I want to have different typemaps, depending on the types that foo is expecting (an array of int, strings, whatever). Maybe there's a way to give a type to ""...""</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this?</p>

I don't want to use a template, I want to do things a bit more advanced and therefore I will need to make many tables and many rows to achieve the same effect because each page will have a different design. </p>

<p>So, in the index.php I have 7 text fields that I want to be able to be updated via RTE. So I created a table called ""page_hem1"" on my database where those 7 text fields exist with the names ""text1"", ""text2"", etc.</p>

<p>Then I made some basic code for that:</p>

<pre><code>// Query the body section for the proper page
$sqlCommand = ""SELECT text1 FROM page_hem WHERE id='$pageid' LIMIT 1""; 
$query = mysqli_query($myConnection, $sqlCommand) or die (mysqli_error()); 
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($query)) { 
    $body1 = $row[""text1""];
    $body2 = $row[""text2""];
    $body3 = $row[""text3""];
    $body4 = $row[""text4""];
    $body5 = $row[""text5""];
    $body6 = $row[""text6""];
    $body7 = $row[""text7""];
} 
mysqli_free_result($query); 
</code></pre>

<p>My issue is that only the $body1 variable is being echoed. Why aren't the others? What am I doing wrong? You should know that I also tried to repeat the same code sequence for each and every single one of the ""$body"" variables, but it didn't work out neither. Perhaps i didn't repeat in the right way?</p>

<p>Here is an image of my result. It is supposed to be a black sphere with colored ""latitude and longitude"" lines, with a black spot in the middle. But it seems like every second triangle is left black. You can see the result here:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DNZb4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>My prof said that it looks like the normals are backwards, but I don't think that is the case because the shape is still being hit - and the color of the ""wrong"" triangles is the color of background color of the texture (ie. black in this case). </p>

<p>When I load the OBJ, each vertex has a UV coord associated with it. What I do to get a UV coord when a ray hits the shape is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>T: the triangle that was hit
hp: where on the triangle the ray hit
v1,v2,v3: the vertices of the triangle, each has a UV coord UV1, UV2, UV3

find the distance to each v[i] from hp (d1,d2,d3 respectively)
find the weight of each of these (w1 = d1/(d1+d2+d3), same for d2,d3)
find the weighted UV coord: UV1/w1 + UV2/w2 + UV3/w3

find the pixel color based on this weighted coord

The kicker here is that I have never touched Flask, dc.js, d3, crossfilter, or javascript for that matter... (Yes; stupid is, stupid does)</p>

<p>What made me go for it was a <a href=""http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2015/01/interactive-data-visualization-d3-dc-python-mongodb/"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorial</a>, that laid everything out so understandably, and tempting. </p>

<p>So now I am here, sweating due to the time pressure, trying to get data generated at the back with pandas, over to the front-end. The code from the tutorial is as follows;</p>



<pre><code>queue()
.defer(d3.json, ""/donorschoose/projects"")
.defer(d3.json, ""static/geojson/us-states.json"")
.await(makeGraphs);

function makeGraphs(error, projectsJson, statesJson) {

//Clean projectsJson data
var donorschooseProjects = projectsJson;
var dateFormat = d3.time.format(""%Y-%m-%d"");
donorschooseProjects.forEach(function(d) {
    d[""date_posted""] = dateFormat.parse(d[""date_posted""]);
    d[""date_posted""].setDate(1);
    d[""total_donations""] = +d[""total_donations""];
});
</code></pre>

<p>Following the monkey see monkey do principle (the monkey has been using the last couple of hours googling, trying to get an understanding of what is happening, but to no avail), my code is as follows; </p>

<pre><code>queue()
.defer(d3.json, ""/salgshisto"")
.await(makeGraphs);

function makeGraphs(error, salgsData) {

var salgsTransaksjonene = salgsData;
var dateFormat = d3.time.format(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"");
salgsTransaksjonene.forEach(function(d) {
    d[""InvoiceDate""] = dateFormat.parse(d[""InvoiceDate""]);
    d[""InvoiceDate""].setDate(1);
    d[""TotalAmount""] = +d[""TotalAmount""];
});
</code></pre>

<p>This leads to the following error in the safari console; </p>

<pre><code>TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating 'salgsTransaksjonene.forEach')
</code></pre>

<p>And the last piece of info; The flask app.py file, has a </p>

<pre><code>@app.route(""/salgshisto"")
def betHisto():
    ....
    creating FO = pandas.DataFrame object 
    ....

   return FO.to_json(orient='index', date_format='iso', date_unit='s', force_ascii=False)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the console shows an object, which is the .json data, I can see that since I can span out the object's object elements, and see the info from the pandas Dataframe. So; The info makes it across, but it does not look like it gets to the makeGraphs function and the salgsTransaksjonene selector. </p>

<p>I just cannot understand what the typeError is, so if anyone has any idea, I would be very grateful!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>

<p>@Mark thank you for replying!! I implemented the <code>d3.json()</code> you supplied like so; </p>

<pre><code>var salgsData = d3.json(""/salgshisto"", function(error, json) { if (error) return console.warn(error);}); 

function makeGraphs(salgsData) {.....
</code></pre>

<p>There are now, no error messages either in the Flask server, or the chrome / safari console. So the code seems to be executing now. But it is not behaving as expected. The rest of the code does not return what I expect - a rowChart:</p>

<pre><code>var salgsData = d3.json(""/salgshisto"", function(error, json) { if (error) return console.warn(error);}); 

function makeGraphs(salgsData) {

//  var salgsData = d3.json.loads(""/salgshisto"");

//klargjoer salgsData
var salgsTransaksjonene = salgsData;
var dateFormat = d3.time.format(""%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"");
salgsTransaksjonene.forEach(function(d) {
    d[""InvoiceDate""] = dateFormat.parse(d[""InvoiceDate""]);
    d[""InvoiceDate""].setDate(1);
    d[""TotalAmount""] = +d[""TotalAmount""];
});

//Create a Crossfilter instance
var ndx = crossfilter(salgsTransaksjonene);

//Define Dimensions
var kundeDim = ndx.dimension(function(d) { return d[""CustomerName""]; });
//var betingelseDim = ndx.dimension(function(d) { return d[""Name""]; }); 

//Calculate metrics
var OmsetningKunder = kundeDim.group().reduceSum(function(fact) { return fact.TotalAmount;});

//Charts
var resourceTypeChart = dc.rowChart(""#topp-20-row-chart"");

resourceTypeChart
    .width(300)
    .height(600)
    .dimension(kundeDim)
    .group(OmsetningKunder)
    .xAxis().ticks(4);

dc.renderAll();
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>I can see from the server log that <code>""/salgshisto""</code> is being called. </p>

<p>The corresponding bootstrap keen.io template has the correct <code>&lt;div id=""topp-20-row-chart""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> added.</p>

<p>Concerning the .json data. I am wondering how to transmit it to you. I cannot get the same info, laying out the object, in the javascript console anymore. Best I can do I guess is copying the response from running "".../salgshisto"" url in the browser. That returns the entire list. The only problem then is that the text is <code>uff-8</code>which I cannot get it printed as. So here is the first two entries, as unicode; 
<code>{""0"":{""InvoiceDate"":""2011-04-04T00:00:00Z"",""CustomerName"":""M\u0000e\u0000c\u0000h\u0000a\u0000n\u0000i\u0000c\u0000a\u0000 \u0000A\u0000S\u0000"",""Name"":""Netto per 30 dager"",""TotalAmount"":14689.74},""1"":{""InvoiceDate"":""2011-04-07T00:00:00Z"",""CustomerName"":""H\u0000e\u0000l\u0000l\u0000a\u0000n\u0000d\u0000 \u0000M\u0000e\u0000k\u0000.\u0000 \u0000V\u0000e\u0000r\u0000k\u0000s\u0000t\u0000e\u0000d\u0000"",""Name"":""Netto per 30 dager"",""TotalAmount"":3705.0},...}</code></p>

But in reality there are often situations where you want to maintain kind of a sorted List instead of a Set. Still there is afaik no TreeList or any SortedList in Java. Though you can of course use Collections.sort().</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>what is the proper way to use a TreeSet (or any sorted set) so that it also contain equal items?</strong> </p>

<p>I normally do something like that:</p>

<pre><code>new Comparator&lt;MyObject&gt;() {
    @Override
    public int compare(MyObject o1, MyObject o2) {
        int result = Float.compare(o1.getDistance(), o2.getDistance());

        //both distances are equal so we use the object hash as distinctive
        //property.
        if (result == 0) {
            result = Integer.compare(System.identityHashCode(o1), 
                System.identityHashCode(o2))
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>While this works very well, this has of course the disadvantage that there is still the slim chance of a <strong>hash collision</strong>, that would lead to <strong>missing objects</strong> in the TreeSet. </p>

<p>So I wonder if there is any better way to really distinguish these objects properly?</p>

It will ship with a version of this database, but I need to update it on a regular basis (most likely once a month).  Typically I've been sending updates for other parts of my app as XML through a bunch of webservices I've set up, but this particular database I'm working on now is pretty large (about 20-30 MB), and I'm getting timeout errors when I try to send it that way.</p>

<p>I tried putting the database on my companies server, then downloading it into an <code>NSData</code> object.  I then saved that data object to my app's Documents directory.  When I restart my app, I get an error saying ""File at path does not appear to be a SQLite database"".  Code for this is below.</p>

<pre><code>// Download data
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://www.mysite.net/download/myDatabase.sqlite""];
NSData *fileData = [[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:url];
NSLog(@""%@"",fileData); // Writes a bunch of 8 character (hex?) strings

// Delete old database
NSError *error;
NSURL *destination = [app applicationDocumentsDirectory];
destination = [destination URLByAppendingPathComponent:@""myDatabase""];
destination = [destination URLByAppendingPathExtension:@""sqlite""];
NSLog(@""destination = %@"",destination);
[[NSFileManager defaultManager] removeItemAtPath:[destination path] error:&amp;error];

// Save into correct location
[fileData writeToURL:destination atomically:YES];
//[NSFileManager defaultManager] createFileAtPath:[destination path] contents:fileData attributes:nil]; // I also tried this, it doesn't work either.
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a standard procedure for updating a large database that an app will use?  I get the feeling that what I'm trying to do is incorrect and that there is a totally different way to do this, but I can't figure out what.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE:
I've tried a couple things to try to find the problem, but nothing is getting me any closer.  I put the database I'm trying to download from my server onto a USB drive and then onto the mac I'm developing on, and into the Documents folder for my app in the Simulator.  When I run my app by transferring the database this way, it runs without any problem and I can see all my data.  </p>

<p>Conversely, I completely removed my app from the simulator and re-ran it, so it would create my database from scratch.  I transferred this newly-made database from my mac onto my server with the USB drive.  Once the file was on my server, I tried to run my ""download update"" in the code block above, but it still crashes the next time I start my app with the ""File at path does not appear to be a SQLite database"" error message.</p>

<p>From these tests, I'm confident that the problem is not with the database I'm trying to download.  Something in my ""download update"" code is corrupting the database, but I still haven't been able to figure out why, nor have I found an acceptable alternate method to get my updates out to my users once my app launches.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE 2:
I've been doing some more searching, and I've learned that a user will need to put in a username and password to access any file on my server.  I now believe that the <code>NSData</code> I'm getting back from my code above is actually an authentication challenge, or something related to that, and that's why when I save it with the <code>NSFileManager</code> it's not being recognized as a sqlite DB.</p>

<p>The simplest solution I've found to get through the authentication is <a href=""http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/security/a-simple-way-to-download-data-from-a-password-protected-web-page"">here</a>.  When I try to do <code>NSData *fileData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url options:NSDataReadingMapped error:&amp;error];</code> (after changing my <code>url</code> as suggested in the link, of course), I get an error <code>NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=256</code>, which is just unknown error.  My <code>fileData</code> is <code>nil</code> after doing this.  I've noticed this post is quite old, so I don't know if it is still supported.</p>

<p>I also found a different solution to the authentication problem <a href=""http://iosdevelopmentjournal.com/blog/2013/02/10/an-example-nsurlconnectiondelegate/"">here</a> using an <code>NSURLConnection</code> instead of <code>dataWithContentsOfURL</code>.  This is much more recent, but there is some more advanced looking syntax used in that example that I haven't really seen before.  I was able to pretty much copy-paste from the example, and my project will build without errors, but I don't know the proper syntax for using the <code>fetchURL:withCompletion:failure:</code> routine from my <code>UIViewController</code>.  I tried</p>

<pre><code>NSError *error;
NSData *fileData;
ExampleDelegate *download = [[ExampleDelegate alloc] init];
[download fetchURL:url withCompletion:fileData failure:&amp;error];
</code></pre>

<p>but that gives a build error for sending an incompatible pointer.  I think I can't pass a straight <code>NSData</code> and <code>NSError</code> as <code>ExampleDelegateSuccess</code> and <code>ExampleDelegateFailure</code> objects respectively, even though that what they are <code>typedef</code>ed from.  I probably have to do something to <code>fileData</code> and <code>error</code> to convert them, but that <code>typedef</code>ing is one of the ""advanced looking syntax"" I was referring to above, and I don't really know what to do.</p>

<p>It's not included in his example, but I found another <code>NSURLConnectionDelegate</code> method called <code>connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:</code> <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1973325/nsurlconnection-and-basic-http-authentication"">here</a> that I think I can just add into the code from the example, and that should solve my authentication issue.  I feel if I just knew how to call <code>fetchURL</code> I'd be set.  Does anyone have any advice on what I need to do to get <code>fileData</code> and <code>error</code> into that call?</p>

I have taken ownership of 3 websites that share a number of internal assemblies, they each connect to a WCF Service hosted in IIS for basic CRUD type operations.</p>

<p>A couple of different developers could be working on each website at any one time, making changes/additions to the code that is used in the shared assemblies. </p>

<p>The Issue
Each developer then builds their code and ensure that their website is working correctly. However they are unaware that in changing the shared code they could have affected the functionality in the other websites.</p>

<p>To resolve this, I could build each shared assembly separately, copy the dll to a directory specific to each website and add a reference from there. </p>

<p>However this flags up a couple of issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This means constantly building the shared assembly and manually copying the dll to the directory it is required in.</p></li>
<li><p>When a developer gets the latest source code for the shared assembly, they get the changes any way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have thought about managing this using nuget packages, but this only really addresses issue #1 to make it slightly easier to manage specific versions.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense...</p>

<p>I have a dore data db with the metadata of a filesystem. I want to retrieve the number of files > 10 kbytes, so I'm using a predicate statement. Unfortunately the app crashes with:</p>

<p>'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'keypath SELF.SIZE not found in entity '</p>

<p>Here the code:</p>

<pre><code>// Initialize NSFetchrequest and define entity

NSError *error;
NSFetchRequest *request = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];
NSEntityDescription *file = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""Files"" inManagedObjectContext:appDelegate.managedObjectContext];
[request setEntity:file];

// Query on Number of files between 0 and 10000 bytes

NSNumber * tenk = @10000;
NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""any self.size &lt; %@"", tenk];
[request setPredicate:predicate];
fetchResult = [appDelegate.managedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:request  error:&amp;error];

int primaBar = fetchResult.count;
NSLog(@""Files smaller than 10k: %d :"",primaBar);
</code></pre>

<p>The code works if instead of comparing NSnumbers I compare strings (e.g. I'm able to retrieve the number of files with extension ""pdf"" with the predicate @""any self.extension contains %@"",extension ) so I believe that I'm doing something wrong accessing the NSnumber self.size.</p>

Don't think it's a big deal so hopefully someone can provide a solution (bit of a SO noob so any more details needed let me know).</p>

<p>I'm trying to get the values of multiple items from a listbox in a W8.1 universal XAML app so I can pass them to a SQLite DB (am thinking as a string using a comma delimited 'join' statement). The data source for the ListItems is currently manually set for various values.</p>

<p>In the meantime I'm setting a label to the text of the string as a test and wasn't getting any joy from using Checkboxes within the listbox, so I've changed to ListBoxItems, however I'm not getting the content through, just the following (when selecting two list items):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ListBoxItem,
  Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ListBoxItem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously I'm after the Content, which should be 'Developer' and 'Tester'. Here's the XAML for the ListBox and my current code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBlock x:Name=""lblAreas"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" Margin=""548,200,0,0"" TextWrapping=""Wrap"" Text=""Areas of Interest"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"" RenderTransformOrigin=""1.143,1.692"" FontSize=""13.333"" Height=""32"" Width=""336""/&gt;
    &lt;ListBox x:Name=""lbAreas"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" Height=""231"" Margin=""548,241,0,0"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"" Width=""194"" SelectionMode=""Multiple""&gt;
        &lt;ListBoxItem Content=""Developer""/&gt;
        &lt;ListBoxItem Content=""Tester""/&gt;
    &lt;/ListBox&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Code behind:</p>

<pre><code>var listSelectedItems = lbAreas.SelectedItems.ToList();
string strSelectAreas = string.Join("", "", listSelectedItems);
lblAreas.Text = strSelectAreas;
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully that all makes sense, I've tried various methods from SO and elsewhere that look like they should work but not quite there! Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Neo4j, maybe Titan: graph search awesomeness!</p>

<p>But what are good strategies for queries that combine facets, full-text and graphs? I would not want to materialize graph search results and carry these over into a faceted/full-text query. How to combine these worlds?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facets</strong> &ndash; We have ""items"" with facets such as <em>modified date</em>, <em>status</em>, <em>item type</em> (and much more; although fields/facets of these items are even configurable, a reasonable, average <em>item</em> would have around 20 facets).</li>
<li><strong>Graphs</strong> &ndash; These ""items"" are related to each other (we talk a lot about ""upstream"" and ""downstream"" items/relationships), they are related to users in various ways, they have associated comments (which in turn will have more users associated).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we would like to do queries such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show me all the ""items"" that are <em>x</em> steps away from a given list of items (a <em>graph</em> concern), that are in status <em>such-and-such</em> and that are modified in the last 30 days (<em>faceted</em> concerns).</li>
<li>Show me all the users that are connected to a given ""item"", meaning that they modified or commented on the given item, or any of its related items up to <em>x</em> steps away from the given item, provided that these related items were in a certain status, and modified after the given item was modified.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>You could model graphs in Lucene, but that seems a big no-starter. (Prove me wrong!)</p>

<p>You could add facets to Neo4j, but that seems a performance hazard that it is just not optimized for. (But maybe you have different experiences.)</p>

<p>And maybe there is a golden bullet to this problem.</p>

When using C++/Qt, the compiler will give you a hint where you are wrong about the signal/slot, but the PyQt default configuration doesn't give a hint about error. Is there a ways or such as debug trigger mode to enable PyQt to display more information?
the Code is as following:</p>

        time.sleep(1)

<p>In C++,the QObject::connect return value will show the signal/slot binding is success or not. In PyQt, the return value is True, but it doesn't trigger the slot.
My Question:
1) Is the signal shoud be a class member or instance member?
2) If QObject.connect 's return value can't give the hint of the binding is success or not, is there other ways to detect it?
   I want to bind the signal/slot outside the signal sender and slot receiver, so I perfer to use the QObject.connect ways. But how can I write this correct, I tried the following ways,both fail.</p>

You tap the button, the email screen comes up via the MessageUI framework, the To, Subject, and Body fields are already pre-entered, all that's needed is for the user to hit ""send"".</p>

<p>My problem, is that I need the latitude and longitude coordinates to be included in the email body.  Those coordinate variables are generated in the -(void)CLLocationManager function and turned into strings, just like I need.  The problem is, the email is being sent from another function, -(void)displayComposerSheet, and I can't figure out how to get the lat / long strings into the body of the email to be sent.  After pounding my way through Google for a bit, I've come across the idea of Global Variables.  This seems like it's what I need to implement.  A lot of sources are saying ""declare your variables in the app delegate and then you'll be able to use them wherever in your code"", or at least that's what I'm taking it to mean.  Again, I'll stress that I'm fairly new to this game.  So, it seems that if I were to create my latitude and longitude strings in the delegate.m file instead of the project .m file, then I'll be able to call upon them at my leisure and, presto, send them in my email's body.</p>

Now, in one of my tabs (all tabs are fragments) I want to have a settings screen for creating a new game. I figure preferences is the best choice. BUT I don't know how to use preferences in a fragment and still support api level 9. Can anyone please help?
If it's not possible to use preferences in fragment and support api level 9, do you have any suggestions? How can I for example create views to look like a preference, that is, text to the left, checkbox to the right and when I check it, the whole layout gets selected? And a radiobuttongroup with the same look?</p>

However, in order to do that I've had to use button type=""button"" to do so but when I do that the form no longer submits. I'm sure there's a very obvious solution but it's not smacking me in the face. Does anyone out there have a quick fix solution?</p>

<p>The problem is specifically in the event where it listens for ButtonAddBalance and ButtonSetBalance. It gives a NullPointerException and I have found no way of fixing. It is supposed to get text from label ""thebalance"" and parse it to Double, and then depending on which, it will either added to balance or set it to the balance global double variable. Thank You!</p>

<pre><code>opts_chunks$set(dev='pdf')
knit(input)
</code></pre>

<p>However, it isn't working, as <code>knit</code> seems to use a fresh set of <code>opts_chunks</code> within <code>knit</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to set a global chunk option outside a call to <code>knit</code>, and have it apply for the call to <code>knit</code>?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Reason I'm doing this:</p>

<p>I'm writing <code>Rmd</code> (R markdown) documents, and I want to be able to knit these to pdf <strong>or</strong> HTML, my choice, like so:</p>

<pre><code>knit2 &lt;- function (input, out=c('pdf', 'html')) {
    # set the appropriate output image format
    opts_chunk$set(dev=ifelse(out == 'pdf', 'pdf', 'svg')) # &lt;--

    # knit to md
    o &lt;- knit(input)

    # knit md to html or pdf
    pandoc(input=o, format=ifelse(out == 'pdf', 'latex', 'html'))
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the idea is that I can <code>knit2('mydoc.Rmd', 'pdf')</code> OR <code>knit2('mydoc.Rmd', 'html')</code> and I <strong>don't have to change the Rmd depending on the output</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem I encountered was that I want my images to be SVG for HTML output, and PDF for PDF output (I wanted vector graphics but SVG doesn't work in Latex, and pdf doesn't work in HTML, so I need to modify this based on the output format), i.e.</p>

<pre><code>opts_chunk$set(dev=ifelse(out == 'pdf', 'pdf', 'svg'))
</code></pre>

<p>I know that if I put this in a chunk in my Rmd file along with a definition of <code>out</code>, it will work.
However, I don't want to embed this within <code>mydoc.Rmd</code>, as I can't assign <code>output</code> until <code>knit2</code> is called an I know what output I actually want.</p>

<p>Hence, I want knit2 to somehow set the <code>dev</code> option for me before calling <code>knit</code> and have that option apply for th duration of the <code>knit</code>. (I would also accept embedding my <code>opts_chunk$set(dev=ifelse(out=='pdf', 'pdf', 'svg'))</code> into my Rmd file, provided that I could define <code>out</code> <em>outside</em> the Rmd file, i.e. in <code>knit2</code>, although if I can handle it all from <code>knit2</code> I'd prefer that)</p>

<p>How can I do this in vb.net?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SgWAG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In my design page I have many panel, splitter, textbox, checkbox and other things and please take note that this design is under the panel tab (index 2). What I want is to create a short code (Short as possible) so when the user types in a certain textbox I will know what schedule to activate so every time the user clicks the apply button the system will just send the set that has a last <code>text_change</code>.</p>

<p>This is my code in vb.net and I wanted to use me.controls to call an object in a string, but it's not working</p>

<pre><code>     Dim lab As Label

     For i As Integer = 1 To 10
        lab = Me.Controls(""tb_hour_"" &amp; i)
        lab.Text = ""Test"" &amp; i
     Next
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, the name of my textbox, checkbox and radio button is something like this</p>

<p>tb_hour_1, tb_minute_1, cb_monday_1, etc. _1 stands for schedule 1 so for the schedule 2 it will be like this tb_hour_2, tb_minute_2, cb_monday_2, etc.</p>

<p>Actually my code is working, the problem comes in when I put the textboxes, checkboxes, etc inside the panel and splitter. The purpose of panel and splitter is just to have a design (my aim is the border).</p>

<p>Currently this is the code that I used to achieved my goal, but my code is so hard to maintain because I nested a condition. That's why I want to apply while loop and target all of the objects in a string</p>

<p>I want to have custom css on dates like calendar is showing 1 to 30 dates,I want to add a drop down with each date and that drop down will contain some options,i want to show dates as buttons so that user can click on it,something more css stuff like that.</p>

<p>Is it possible to add such logic,how easy it is and how can I implement it?</p>

All these child divs have a 50% width. The idea is to have 2 columns. 
Also these child divs have a dynamic height.</p>

<p>I have an example here. 
<a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/y2jpr052/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jsfiddle.net/y2jpr052/</a></p>

<p>This is done with inline-block. And as you can see, there is bizarre spacing between the divs. What is that exactly? And how can I get rid of it. 
Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE: 
I see that the divs are all aligned on the top per row, hence the weird spacing. That's what I want to get rid of.</p>

<p>Another update: Basically no vertical spacing. Or spacing depending on the margin/padding of the children div. Each colored box here being a floated div with dynamic height.</p>

            CFReadStreamScheduleWithRunLoop(readStream, CFRunLoopGetCurrent(), kCFRunLoopCommonModes);

            NSLog(@""Could not open read stream"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like this callback function to be able to call instance functions in the current object (self). It does not appear that CFReadStreamSetClient will allow me to change the callback functions signature and so I cannot just pass a reference to the current object to the callback I don't think. </p>

<p>This is the callback function:</p>

<pre><code> void serverCB(CFReadStreamRef stream, CFStreamEventType event, void *myPtr)
{
    switch(event) {
        case kCFStreamEventHasBytesAvailable:
            [self readStreamData:stream];
            break;
        case kCFStreamEventErrorOccurred:
            NSLog(@""A Read Stream Error Has Occurred!"");
            break;
        case kCFStreamEventEndEncountered:
            NSLog(@""A Read Stream Event End!"");
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>ServerCB will not know what 'self' is in this context. Can someone give me a pointer on how I can work around this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Right now it scales from the corner and I would like it to scale from the middle so I can start it in the middle and it scales out evenly.

I am using Jaxb2Marshaller for marshaling/unmarshaling. In my application, I create a single instance of the SaajSoapMessageFactory and one instance of Jaxb2Marshaller. I also create a single instance of the WebServiceTemplate and assign the previously created instances of SaajSoapMessageFactory and Jaxb2Marshaller.</p>

<p>The WebServiceTemplate I created is used in a multi threaded way i.e. multiple threads can call marshalSendAndReceive at the same time. My question is - is my configuration thread safe? I am concerned about the Jaxb2Marshaller. The javadoc says Jaxb2Marshallers are not necessarily thread safe. How can I use the Jaxb2Marshaller in a thread safe way without reinitializing the Jaxb context?</p>

<p>As an aside: looking at the example spring-ws configuration in the <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/1.5/reference/html/oxm.html#oxm-jaxb2-xsd"" rel=""nofollow"">spring reference</a> leads me to believe that the Jaxb2Marshaller is thread safe but the Javadoc seems to contradict that.</p>

The enviroment is rails, though it is not in the http server context, so there is no request for devise to automatically deserialise. There is the Warden::SessionSerializer, though I did not really get how to use it.</p>

<p>Before I wasn't using Devise so I used this method to deserialize the rails session cookie:</p>

<pre class=""lang-ruby prettyprint-override""><code>def decrypt_cookie(cookie)
  cookie = CGI.unescape(cookie)
  config = Rails.application.config

  encrypted_cookie_salt = config.action_dispatch.encrypted_cookie_salt
  encrypted_signed_cookie_salt = config.action_dispatch.encrypted_signed_cookie_salt

  key_generator = ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.new(config.secret_key_base, iterations: 1000)
  secret = key_generator.generate_key(encrypted_cookie_salt)
  sign_secret = key_generator.generate_key(encrypted_signed_cookie_salt)

  encryptor = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(secret, sign_secret)
  encryptor.decrypt_and_verify(cookie)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Since some people might be skeptical whether there is a context in which manually deserializing the cookie can ever be proper:
The client (browser) authenticates via HTTP, and the session is of course stored in the cookie. Rails is also running (rails runner) the websocket server that responds to certain privileged actions. For these I need to (re-)authenticate the user. If someone sees a different (better) way of doing that, I'd be glad to read it. :)</p>

I've made one deployment to Heroku as a test and have developed the application more since. Well now I am wanting to push newer versions to heroku but I am having the worst time. First off, I've lived and learned the importance of consistant databases (test/dev used sqlite3, heroku uses postgres). </p>

<p>I've moved the test/dev databases from sqlite3 to postgres which works fine, but I am still having issues when pushing to heroku that I am not having locally, even though I am using postgres. </p>

<p>Originally I was using time datatype for rooms until I realized that date was important too:</p>

<pre><code>class AddingTimeToRoomModel &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :rooms, :start_time, :time
    add_column :rooms, :end_time, :time

  def change
    change_column :rooms, :start_time, :timestamptz
    change_column :rooms, :end_time, :timestamptz
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Data is not important at this moment since the only data in database was test data that I've accidentally deleted/dropped anyway. I've tried to use :timestamp and :timestamptz but I just cannot get anything to work and am confused why it works locally but not on heroku.</p>

<p>I managed to use the qdap polarity function to calculate the polarity of some blog entries, loading my own dictionary, based on sentiWS. Now I do have a new sentiment dictionary (<a href=""http://www.opinion-mining.org/SePL-Sentiment-Phrase-List"" rel=""nofollow"">SePL</a>) which not only contains single words, but as well phrases. For example ""simply good"", where ""simply"" is neither a negator nor an amplifier, but makes it more precise. So i was wondering, wether I could search for ngrams using the polarity function of qdap.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<pre><code>library(qdap)
phrase &lt;- ""This is simply the best""
key &lt;- sentiment_frame(c(""simply"", ""best"", ""simply the best""), """", c(0.1,0.3,0.8))
counts(polarity(phrase, polarity.frame=key))
</code></pre>

<p>gives:</p>

<pre><code>  all wc polarity    pos.words neg.words                text.var
1 all  5    0.179 simply, best         - This is simply the best
</code></pre>

<p>However, I would like to get an output like:</p>

<pre><code>  all wc polarity    pos.words neg.words                text.var
1 all  5    0.76 simply the best         - This is simply the best

<p>My Symfony2 app for this issue has two different profiles, name 'em ""Seller"" and ""Buyer"". The goal is to keep a bunch of attributes about a ""Seller"", and, on the other hand, not much about the ""Buyer"" (email and password would do it).</p>

<p>I realise that it's not easy to have two different entities log in and register using FOSUserBundle. There are quite some other bundles, such as PUGXMultiUserBundle that 'hack' FOSUserBundle, and are not easy to config/implement.</p>

<p>So my quiestion is: Is it more correct to use the hack PUGXMultiUserBundle proposes, dealing with its implementation and config, or is it better to stick to FOSUserBundle, have a User entity, and a one-to-one relation with a ""Seller"" entity that represents the attributes of a Seller different from a buyer? There would be another problem with that approach, with the registration form, that should be splitted in two, for Seller and Buyer register (which I don't know if it is possible/advisable using FOSUserBundle)</p>

I have created a simple C# Windows Form application using Visual Studio 2012 Premium.  I have a small program that starts up and creates a NotifyIcon in the system tray.  On click of the tray icon, a context menu is displayed and it shows a few menu options (Options, About, etc.), where each option displays a form.  I have added two icon files (.ico) via the Resources by right clicking on my Project item, Properties, Resources.  I programmatically change the Icon of my NotifyIcon, alternating between the two different icons.  My problem is that my old icons keep displaying, instead of my new ones that I've added to the project.  To be clear, my issue is that OLD icons keep displaying--everything is working and there are no errors, it just doesn't show my latest icons.
The way I'm changing the icons in code is using:</p>

<pre><code>notifyIcon.Icon = Resources.IconA03312014; //or the other one; the numbers are the date
</code></pre>

<p>I initially made my icons and used those and later decided to change them a little bit--I changed some colors, etc.  So then I removed the old icons from my project by clicking the Exclude from Project option.  Then I added my new icons, which had different names.  Then I updated my two code references that load the icons to use the new names.  No matter what I do, my new/updated icons are not displayed!</p>

<p>Whether I run the program in Visual Studio in Debug or Release mode, it does not matter.  I can clean the solution, rebuild, and then run the executable directly by clicking on it in Windows, and no difference.  Old icons are shown.
I have followed different sets of instructions online that explain how to clear the Windows 8 icon cache (three different methods).  I have cleared the cached Notification tray icons as well, using two different methods.</p>

<p>Basically, I cleaned my solution and then closed Visual Studio.  I kill all explorer processes, run ie4uinit.exe -ClearIconCache from the command line and delete the IconCache.db file.  Then I delete the notification icon cache by editing the registry following instructions similar to these (<a href=""http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/13102-notification-area-icons-reset.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/13102-notification-area-icons-reset.html</a>).  Then I shutdown the computer.  Upon starting backup and rebuilding my solution and running, the old icons are still there somehow.  The physical .ico files for the old icons were deleted long ago.  Each time I've added new icons to my Resources, I've created new icon files from scratch (using icobundl.exe) and named them uniquely by including the date in the name.  I am aware that Windows, and apparently Visual Studio also, like to cache icons and if you delete some icon file A.ico in Windows and then rename another icon file B.ico to A.ico, the B.ico file's actual icon will change to A's.  Anyway, I don't the name of the icon file is the issue.</p>

<p>Now, in code, if I use the same strategy and set one of my form's icons, it works correctly and the form displays my latest icon, while my notify icon still shows the old (and now nonexistent, except in Visual Studio la la land) icon.
So, I have:</p>

<pre><code>...
if(firstState){
    notifyIcon.Icon = Resources.IconA03312014;
    optionsForm.Icon = Resources.IconA03312014;
}
else{
    notifyIcon.Icon = Resources.IconB03312014;
    optionsForm.Icon = Resources.IconB03312014;
}
firstState = !firstState;
...
</code></pre>

<p>There are no errors and both the notifyIcon and optionsForm's changes, but the notify icon displays my OLD icon that no longer exists anywhere (except somewhere/somehow in VS).  The form's icon changes to my updated/latest icon.</p>

<p>If I copy my app's .exe file to another computer and run it, it too displays the old icons for the notify icon, so the old icons are somehow still embedded in my exe generated by Visual Studio.  If I just directly load the .ico file, instead of referencing my project resources, the new icons ARE shown.  This have to be some sort of strange Resources caching issue in Visual Studio?</p>

<p>Can anyone please help me with this issue?  I just don't understand how my old icons are still existing somewhere, and how Visual Studio somehow knows how to switch them!  That's right, the above icon swapout works perfectly for the form.  But for the notifyIcon, the icon does switch from ""A"" to ""B"", but it uses the old A icon and the old B icon--icons that do not exist anywhere anymore!</p>

<p>I hope I have explained my issue.  I greatly appreciate any help that anyone can provide.</p>

<p>But as far as I can see 2.2 is the latest version of the mapping, so how can anyone put a column element inside the version element?</p>

<p>Sorry if this is really basic,</p>

<p>The component is part of a patch that I can install and roll back. The problem is that the uninstall action doesn't fire when I uninstall the patch. The odd part is that the same XmlConfig action does execute if I change it to be <code>On=""install""</code>. I see that the registry key is properly removed on uninstall. Why isn't the XmlConfig action firing as well? I checked the logs and did not see any errors or explanation of why it didn't happen.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
The XmlConfig action works when doing a full uninstall. Just not on a patch rollback.</p>

<p>for instance, the syntax of my DSL specification is as follows. I am entering this information through nice editor facilities provided by xText.</p>

<pre><code>structs:
    TempStruct
        tempValue : double;
            unitOfMeasurement : String;

abilities :
    sensors:    
        TemperatureSensor
            generate tempMeasurement : TempStruct;
            attribute responseFormat : String;  
</code></pre>

<p>The grammar of above mentioned DSL specification is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>       VocSpec:

          'structs' ':'
          (structs += Struct)+

          'abilities' ':'
           ('sensors' ':' (sensors += Sensor)+ )+ 
         ;

      Sensor:
          name = ID
          ((attributes += Attributes ) |
          (sources += Sources))* 
          ;

     Sources:
          'generate' name=ID ':' type = Type ';' 
           ;

     Attributes:
         'attribute' name=ID ':' type = Type ';' 
           ; 

    Struct:
          name = ID
          (fields += Field)+ 
         ;

    Field:
         name=ID ':' type += Type ';' 
        ;
</code></pre>

<p>The xText generates semantic model corresponding to above mentioned Specification. In our example, xText generates Semantic model, which contains files such as <code>struct.java</code>, <code>Field.java</code>, <code>Attribute.java</code>, <code>Sensor.java</code>, etc.</p>

<p>I can clearly see that this semantic model can be linked with the <code>StringTemplate</code> file. 
The <code>StringTemplate</code> file takes object of the class. For instance, <code>StringTemplate</code> file takes <code>TemperatureSensor</code> (instance of Sensor) as Input and generate Java code.</p>

<p>My question is how can I instantiate the semantic model ( generated by xText ) and What do I need to do to link with StringTemplate files ?</p>

        {
            Text = c.LocationName,
            Value = c.Id.ToString()
        };

        ViewBag.CageLocationList = selectList;
    }

    public int CheckIn_Id { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = ""Location Required."")]
    public IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem&gt; CheckIn_Location { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = ""Quantity Required."")]
    [Range(1, 100, ErrorMessage = ""Quantity must be between 1 and 100000"")]
    public int CheckIn_Quantity { get; set; }

    public string CheckIn_Comment { get; set; }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my Controller:</p>

<pre><code>    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult CheckIn(CheckInViewModel model)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {

            var New_Transaction = new Transaction
            {
                Id = model.CheckIn_Id,
                Quantity = model.CheckIn_Quantity,
                LocationId = Convert.ToInt32(model.CheckIn_Location),
                TransactionDate = DateTime.Now,
                TransactionComments = model.CheckIn_Comment.Replace(""\r\n"", "" "")
            };

            unitOfWork.TransactionRepository.Insert(New_Transaction);

<p>here is the JS function that fire the submit:</p>

<pre><code>    function SubmitCheckInForm() {
            $('#CheckInForm').submit();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone show me how to:</p>

<ol>
<li>populate the dropdown with (value/text) using the model as the binding agent (not the viewbag as I previously did it)</li>
<li>return the selected option to the controller and insert it into the transaction table's location element (which is an int)</li>
<li>properly hook this all up so the server side annotations work and return messages when something is incorrect in the form.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in Advance!</p>

These business processes typically involve lots of interaction with our SQL Server backend.  We have created a custom task queue implementation whereby the requests are queued via an initial service call and later executed based on priority.  This execution can take long to complete (20-30 minutes extreme).  Clients can then query the server for the progress of their own background tasks.  </p>

<p>In our current implementation the tasks fires off on a separate thread to execute and not from the ThreadPool.  This was done due to <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pedram/archive/2007/08/05/dedicated-thread-or-a-threadpool-thread.aspx"">reading recommendations</a> of not running long-running tasks using the ThreadPool as to prevent starving the ASP.NET requests from being served.  We control the number of threads spawned by placing an upper limit on the number of background tasks that can be executed concurrently.  This way we try to control the load on the CPU and prevent too much thread context switching.  While all of this is happening we of course still need to serve the normal ""on-line"" requests for the application as well.</p>

<p>After reading <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tmarq/archive/2010/04/14/performing-asynchronous-work-or-tasks-in-asp-net-applications.aspx"">this post</a> by Thomas Marquardt  I'm concerned about the fact that we are not using the ThreadPool as we won't get the benefit of the tuning heuristics built into it.  We already solve the shutdown issue Thomas mentions by hooking into the ApplicationEnd event and cancelling the long running tasks.  So my question is, should we switch over to using the ThreadPool?  What about these threads being tied up for lengthy periods of time?  If I understand Thomas correctly he is saying this doesn't matter as the ThreadPool will tune itself to create more requests to serve the normal on-line operations? I've also read through <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1325718/using-threadpool-queueuserworkitem-in-asp-net-in-a-high-traffic-scenario"">this StackOverflow question</a> that covers the same grounds but I'm still unsure as to the way forward.</p>

AddComment does not have it's own view,  so instead of returning View(), we must return View(""Blog""). We can't use RedirectToAction(""Blog"") because we loose our ModelState errors. The problem is what if the Blog view is bound to a Blog model?!? Let's assume we have an Index() action whose job it is to retrieve the Blog's data and returns View(""Blog"",BlogModel). We would have to copy the contents of Index(), where the BlogModel is retrieved, to our AddComment() action. Else, returning View(""Blog"") from AddComment will give us a null exception when the Blog view is being parsed. Is this the only way to maintain ModelState errors between actions that use the same view? I just started learning MVC and I'm still learning the right way to layout my code so please enlighten me. </p>

(http://masterblood.ru/ch12c.shtml)
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682432(v=vs.85).aspx)</p>

<p>does anyone know of any full working examples of one? I think it would be helpful for me to see.</p>

<p>If not, I'm confused about how exactly I implement the interfaces they say I need to implement (IMarshal, IUnknown, and IClassFactory) I know I need to write functions like loaddllserver and freesurrogate myself, but do i actually have to write functions like addref and release myself too? Usually when i create a com object, I use ATL and use all of those Macros to define those functions, but that doesnt work unless you create the com object with cocreateinstance, and they seem to be using new. also, the msdn page for IMarshal says ""Implement IMarshal only when you believe that you can realize significant optimizations to the COM default implementation. "" I don't have any optimizations to make to the marshalling so I'd like to use theirs if possible. I know the non-msdn page doesnt mention IMarshal, but MSDN says I need to use it. </p>

<p>Are the surrogate objects normal com objects, or are they just regular objects that inherit from those Interfaces? do I need an idl file? </p>

<p>I understood what the example on the site did, but I'm confused about how the classes get defined in the first place.</p>

<p>Any help you could give would be great.</p>

The most likely candidate for this, is <a href=""http://webkit.org"">Webkit</a>/<a href=""http://chromium.org"">Chromium</a>. <strong>We are looking for something similar to <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html"">WebView</a>, essentially, but backed by a browser (version) that we control.</strong></p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Significant parts of our app consist of web page fragments embedded in the view (served by the app itself). We try to do this as transparently as possible (from a visual/user experience standpoint). So far, we have been using <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html"">WebView</a> for this and that works for the most part. Except when it doesn't. </p>

<p>Some phone vendors have unfortunately decided to tweak the standard Android browser here and there. In some cases, this breaks our app or makes the fact the we embed a web page more noticeable.</p>

<h1>Our Idea</h1>

<p>We'd like to have a component similar to <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html"">WebView</a> but where we control what version of Webkit/Chromium (or some other rendering engine) is being used. It wouldn't necessarily have to be the latest and greatest version. It is more important that we can get our app to work <em>consistently</em> across as many Android devices as possible.</p>

<h2>So far</h2>

<p>Our research so far has not turned up anything useful. We have found three dead attempts to port Webkit to <a href=""http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html"">NDK</a> (the bare Webkit for Android port uses functionality not available in the NDK and thus not to app developers):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.dorothybrowser.com/introducing-webkit-android-ndk-port/"">Webkit Android port by Company 100</a> (no updates for over two years)</li>
<li><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/mogo-browser/"">mogo-browser</a> (their last revision was to delete all source code)</li>
<li><a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/ndkwebkit/"">NDK Webkit</a> (officially abandoned by its author)</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking on StackOverflow, we have also found a number of similar questions, most of which being solved by pointing to WebView (we already do that, and it's not good enough)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10154454/webkit-component-for-android"">Webkit component for Android</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15155331/embed-basic-webkit-v8-in-my-app"">Embed basic WebKit + V8 in my app</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9671933/embedding-a-newer-version-of-webkit-with-android-app"">Embedding a newer version of WebKit with Android app</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We are currently investigating whether <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/AndroidBuildInstructions"">Chromium for Android</a> (or parts of it) can be turned into a library that our app could use. Has anyone else done this?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>After having a look at the chromeview project on GitHub (accepted answer), we decided that we'd rather wait for Google to release a Chrome-based WebView on future Android devices. The Chromium rendering engine turns out to be fairly large (~40MB), which doesn't leave much space for the actual app :(</p>

<p>Say I have an input with a lot of elements with a number in it, some of them containing a numberrange:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;root&gt;
&lt;ele&gt;
    &lt;no&gt;1&lt;/no&gt;
&lt;/ele&gt;
&lt;ele&gt;
    &lt;no&gt;3&lt;/no&gt;
&lt;/ele&gt;
&lt;ele&gt;
    &lt;no&gt;4-11&lt;/no&gt;
&lt;/ele&gt;
&lt;ele&gt;
    &lt;no&gt;12&lt;/no&gt;
&lt;/ele&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>and I want to get this (shortened, up to 11, like in the input):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;root&gt;
&lt;ele&gt;
    &lt;no&gt;1&lt;/no&gt;
&lt;/ele&gt;
&lt;ele&gt;
    &lt;no&gt;3&lt;/no&gt;

&lt;ele&gt;

&lt;/ele&gt;
&lt;ele&gt;
    &lt;no&gt;6&lt;/no&gt;
&lt;/ele&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>So far I have come up with this XSLT:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;xsl:output indent=""yes""/&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match=""/""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:for-each select=""//no""&gt;
        &lt;no&gt;
            &lt;xsl:if test=""not(contains(.,'-'))""&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="".""/&gt;&lt;/xsl:if&gt;
            &lt;xsl:if test=""contains(.,'-')""&gt;
                &lt;xsl:variable name=""beforehiven""&gt;
                    &lt;xsl:value-of select=""substring-before(.,'-')""/&gt;
                &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
                &lt;xsl:variable name=""afterhiven""&gt;
                    &lt;xsl:value-of select=""substring-after(.,'-')""/&gt;
                &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
                &lt;xsl:variable name=""diff""&gt;
                    &lt;xsl:value-of select=""$afterhiven - $beforehiven""/&gt;
                &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
                &lt;xsl:value-of select=""$diff""/&gt;
            &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
        &lt;/no&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>First I adress the ones without a hiven and output them. And I know that between 4 and 11 are 6 numbers, so I have to create new <code>&lt;ele&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;no&gt;</code>elements and give them the value 7-1, create a new variable 6-1 for the next one and so on.</p>

<p>Is this possible with XSLT? If yes, how? </p>

<p>Thanks for your time!</p>

I am using xslt version 2.0</p>

<p>This has worked nicely for the parent element. However I have a child element ""Logo"" where the background image is a JPG. The shadow is applying to the top of the image.

<p><em>That results are random. I didn't test my program.</em> </p>

<p>After I run that algorithm(I think I will give a result time that is good for me for example 78 milliseconds) it will say something like that:</p>

<pre><code>You should use that parameters to get a result that takes 78 milliseconds:
Genes to populate |  Genes to kill   |   Mutation rate

<p><strong>PS1:</strong> One more is that, what strategy I should follow to test it. For example just changing one parameters and test them some number of times and changing other parameter etc.etc.(I tried to give my example values as like that) or testing some values and find one parameter and using that parameter always and testing other parameters that changes one by one and finding other parameter and using that two parameters and changing other one by one and going on like that.</p>

<p><strong>PS2</strong> I can use an API or a software program to find it too.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
These are my variables that I use nowwith their values:</p>

<pre><code>MAX_POPULATION_SIZE = 50;
HARD_WEIGHTS = {1,20,1,1,1,20,1};/* It means that I have 7 variables for this */
NUMBER_OF_GENES_TO_KILL = 5;
MUTATION_RATE = 100;
MAX_MUTATION_NUMBER = 1000;
/* Mutation rate is MUTATION_RATE/MAX_MUTATION_NUMBER */

<p>There can be around 5-10 components for each template which may not be common for other templates, like:</p>

<pre><code>pageTitle
tagline
firstParagraph
buttonText
headerImage     -   Image Component
firstImage      -   Image Component
</code></pre>

<p>So the simple calculation says:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 page = 1 template</li>
<li>1 user can have > 1 pages</li>
<li>Each template can have 5-10 components</li>
</ul>

<p>So if i store it like:</p>

<pre><code>COMPONENT   TYPE        VALUE         LINK

pageTitle   text        Hello world
tagline     text        tagline here
headerImage image       image.jpg     http://example.com
</code></pre>

<p>And it can be any number of users, so lets say 10000 pages will have > 10000*10 components in a db!!</p>

<p>How can we have less number of entries and with the best performance?
Better schema? Serialized? Json? File based system? or anything else...
What can be done?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>For relatively small arrays, or when the comparison logic is trivial, this is probably not a big deal, but with larger arrays or when the comparison logic is not trivial, I would like to be able to cancel a sort already in process. </p>

<p><strong>Trivial Use Case Example</strong></p>

<p>Sorting a set of results that match based on a user's fuzzy search string. As the user types in the search field, results are fetched on a background thread and sorted before being presented to the user. If the fetch-and-sort operation is not completed before the user changes the search string, then it should be cancelled and a new fetch-and-sort operation started. The problem is that if the fetch-and-sort operation has already reached the sorting stage and called one of the <code>NSArray</code> sort methods above, then there's no way to cancel it. Instead, the next fetch-and-sort operation is left waiting for the now stale sort operation to complete.</p>

<p>So far, I've come up with two possible solutions but neither seems all that elegant. </p>

<p><strong>Attempted Solution #1</strong></p>

<p>Allow newer fetch-and-sort operations to start before any stale fetch-and-sort operations are finished. I just keep track of which is the latest operation using some internal state and as the operations complete, if they aren't the primary operation, then their results are discarded. </p>

<p>This works, but it can quickly result in multiple outstanding sorting operations all running concurrently, whether they need to be or not. This can be somewhat mitigated by throttling the maximum number of concurrent operations, but then I'm just adding an arbitrary limit. Pending, stale operations can be cancelled before they get executed, but I'm still left with situations where sorting work is being done when it doesn't need to be.</p>

<p><strong>Attempted Solution #2</strong></p>

<p>Roll my own quick sort or merge sort implementation and add an <code>isCancelled</code> flag to those routines so that they can quickly unwind and terminate. This is working, and working fairly well, but when the sorting operation doesn't need to be cancelled, the run time is about 15-20% slower than using one of the <code>NSArray</code> methods. Part of this, I imagine, is the overhead of calling methods like <code>objectAtIndex</code> and <code>exchangeObjectAtIndex</code> which I <em>assume</em> the internal sorting routines can bypass depending on how the NSArray is internally storing the objects in question. </p>

<p>It also feels <em>wrong</em> to be rolling my own sorting implementations in 2015 against something like <code>AppKit</code> and <code>NSArray</code>. </p>

<p><strong>Semi-Attempted Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keeping a previously sorted array around and re-using that for filtering: This doesn't really work for what I'm trying to do so for sake of discussion, assume that the array I have to sort on is always unsorted and has no relationship to the previously sorted array. </p></li>
<li><p>Moving away from <code>NSArray</code> and back to C-style arrays: This works pretty well and the performance is quite good, but I'm left playing a bunch of games with <code>ARC</code> and the complexity of the overall implementatiion is significantly higher because at the end of the day, I'm always dealing with <code>NSObjects</code>. There's also a non-zero cost of going back and worth between <code>NSArray</code> and C-style arrays. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>So, all of that to get back to the original question: ""How do you cancel an in-progress <code>NSArray</code> sorting method?""</p>

<p><strong>Tech Note</strong></p>

<p>For those that are curious why this is a problem to begin with, I'm attempting to sort somewhere between 500,000 to 1,000,000 strings using compare methods like <code>localizedStandardCompare</code>, which is dramatically slower than just a straight <code>NSString</code> compare. The runtime difference between the various <code>sortUsing...</code> methods is relatively insignificant when compared to the total time to sort. </p>

<p>Goal: I want to know if Eclipse has a macro that acts as <code>getLineNumber()</code> the same way Visual Studio has the ability to use the preprocessor macro <code>__LINE__</code> to easily/universally get the line# for where this particular call to <code>getLineNumber()</code> lives on.  It's useful for knowing if a line of code was hit, without using a debugger/breakpoints.  </p>

<p>I'd like to debug using: <code>println(""I just hit file@line: ""+__FILE__ +'@'+ __LINE__ );</code> </p>

<p>I am seeking a universal macro that can be copied and pasted to any file/any line, so that those values are known at/before compile time.  Does Java/Eclipse offer such a feature?  Possibly in an Eclipse plugin?  </p>

<p>I can't find any info on this anywhere, I'm at a loss.  Thanks.</p>

My makefile is based on the one provided on <a href=""https://github.com/cleversoap/osx-ogremake"" rel=""nofollow"">cleversoap's github repository</a>. I am also using a prebuilt version of the SDK for OSX.</p>

<p>When I first tried to build the <a href=""http://ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=Basic+Tutorial+1"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorial framework</a> from the OGRE 3D webiste, I ended up with multiple linking errors related to the Ogre objects and functions definitions. I edited the source file leaving only those few lines of code.</p>

Our barbershop quartet, The Bell \r Tones was asked to perform at the local Home for the Blind in the next town.  We, of course, were glad to entertain such a worthy group and immediately agreed .  One wag joked, ""Which uniform should we wear?""  followed with, ""Oh, that\'s right, they\'ll never notice.""  The others didn\'t respond to this, in fact, one said that we should wear the nicest outfit we had.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A small stage was set up for us and a pretty decent P.A. system was donated for the occasion.  The audience was made up of blind persons of every age, from the thirties to the nineties.  Some sported sighted companions or nurses who stood or sat by their side, sharing the moment equally.  I observed several German shepherds lying at their feet, adoration showing in their eyes as they wondered what was going on.  After a short introduction in which we identified ourselves, stating our voice part and a little about our livelihood, we began our program.  Some songs were completely familiar and others, called ""Oh, yeah"" songs, only the chorus came to mind.  We didn\'t mind at all that some sang along \x1e they enjoyed it so much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, a popular part of our program is when the audience gets to sing some of the old favorites.  The harmony parts were quite evident as they tried their voices to the different parts.  I think there was more group singing in the old days than there is now, but to blind people, sound and music is more important.   We received a big hand at the finale and were made to promise to return the following year.  Everyone was treated to coffee and cake, our quartet going around to the different circles of friends to sing a favorite song up close and personal.  As we approached a new group, one blind lady amazed me by turning to me saying, ""You\'re the baritone, aren\'t you?""  Previously no one had ever been able to tell which singer sang which part but this lady was listening with her whole heart.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Retired portrait photographer.

<p>I would like to grab the report title for each report page on my website. The website in question is a number of ""report"" pages.</p>

<p>I'm new to code in general and this is my first time coming across a MVC framework. It sounds good though, as far as I can interpret one can pull info out of the db without writing a sql query but rather by calling it within the view itself. Right?</p>

<p>The documentation gives some examples of using Kohana to grab info out of the DB here: <a href=""https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Database+access"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Database+access</a></p>

<p>Here's one of the examples I tried that outputs the expected data:
 <code>$reportcount = ORM::factory('incident')-&gt;count_all();</code></p>

<p>So, as someone new to this, I wanted to use that snippet of code as a base and edit it to get what I need for my current task. The website in question is a series of ""reports"" and for each report page I would like to add the report title to a meta description tag in the head.</p>

<p>Here is the code that outputs the report title further down the DOM on a report page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 class=""report-title""&gt;&lt;?php
echo html::escape($incident_title);
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot find the escape function anywhere to refer to and, since I'm adding this meta tag via  a plugin, the function that generates the meta tag exists on a separate script. I tried simply cutting and pasting <code>echo html::escape($incident_title);</code> but as expected the variable $incident_title was not recognized.</p>

<p>Each report page somehow seems to know it's id $incident_id. I know this after experimenting with the following:</p>

<pre><code>$incititle = ORM::factory('incident')-&gt;table_column('incident_id');
echo $incititle;
</code></pre>

<p>This gave the error message ""Invalid method table_column called in Incident_Model""</p>

<p>Then I tried:</p>

<pre><code>$incititle = ORM::factory('incident')
-&gt;where('incident_title', 'incident')-&gt;find();
echo $incititle;
</code></pre>

<p>This just returned the number 10. I was expecting (more hoping) it would return ""Hello Ushahidi"", the default example report when one installs the Ushahidi platform.</p>

<p>Here is a screen shot of the incidents table:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/wM2WH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I want the incident_title for each report - ""Hello Ushahidi!"" in the example report shown in the table.</p>

<p>It seems too that ""incident"" when used as a parameter in the code I tried above seems to recognize what specific incident is being referred to. So in theory each view should have it's own ID magically stored away somewhere, I do not know how but appears to be the case.</p>

<p>How would I grab the incident_title from the incident table for each incident/report?</p>

Now I need to port the code on the older Android API, and in case, Android API version 8, so I can run my application on mostly all Android devices, starting from Android 2.2.</p>

<p>The problem I come across is that some methods used in the answer are only available in Android API 16+.</p>

<pre><code>        mPagination = new Pagination(mText,
                mTextView.getWidth(),
                mTextView.getHeight(),
                mTextView.getPaint(),
                mTextView.getLineSpacingMultiplier(),
                mTextView.getLineSpacingExtra(),
                mTextView.getIncludeFontPadding());
</code></pre>

<p>So, I have to implement at least these methods:</p>

<pre><code>                TextView.getLineSpacingMultiplier()
                TextView.getLineSpacingExtra()
                TextView.getIncludeFontPadding()
</code></pre>

<p>The second one seems to be already described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22243801/how-to-get-linespacing-of-a-textview"">here</a> as:</p>

<pre><code>mTextView.getPaint().getFontSpacing()
* mTextView.getLineSpacingMultiplier() + mTextView.getLineSpacingExtra()
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't know if the other two are relevant in 2.2, and if they are, how to implement them in Android API version 8. There is some hint <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19755405/retrieve-line-spacing-in-textview-android"">here</a>, using the source code of Android <code>TextView</code> which I could not fully understand.</p>

After spending the whole day looking for the memory leak I found the problem: I had a JPG defined as background for the Main-Activity. After changing the JPG to a PNG the memory problem was solved.</p>

<p>The background was defined as drawable and was defined in main.xml.</p>

<p>The problem did not come when I tested the App under 2.2 (emulator) but with 2.3.1 (also emulator) the app crashed.</p>

<p>Can someone reproduce this problem?</p>

<hr>

<p>Now I reduced my app to the following code:</p>

<pre><code>package at.memtest;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.graphics.drawable.BitmapDrawable;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.LinearLayout;

public class MemTestActivity extends Activity {
/** Called when the activity is first created. */
@Override
public void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
}

@Override
protected void onDestroy() {
    recycleImages();
    super.onDestroy();

}

@Override
protected void onPause() {
    recycleImages();
    super.onPause();
}


private void recycleImages() {
    final LinearLayout theView = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.main_layout);
    if (theView != null) {
        final BitmapDrawable background = (BitmapDrawable) theView.getBackground();
        if (background != null) {
            background.getBitmap().recycle();
        }
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the memory stays constant...
Can you imaging that this is necessary to avoid memory leaks?
As I said above - the image I use as a background is a PNG with about 220K.</p>

<p>Then i grep for ""virtualbox"" and kill the process of that machine. Or i simply reboot my host without using <code>vagrant halt</code>, which is the main use case.</p>

<p>Here is the <code>dmesg</code> output of the next <code>vagrant up</code>:</p>

</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>When i open the box via the <strong>VirtualBox GUI</strong>, i get a login prompt at the first attempts. After killing the virtualbox process (or rebooting the host), it hangs at the following lines without giving me the login prompt. Here are the last lines of output:</p>

<pre><code>* Starting early crypto disks...
  ...done.
* Starting AppArmor profiles
Skipping profile inn /etc/apparmor.d/disable: usr.sbin.rsyslogd
  ...done.
* modprobe vboxvideo failed. Please use 'dmesg' to find out why
  ...fail!
* Setting up X socket directories...
  ...done.
ssty: standard input: Input/output error
* Not starting NFS kernel daemon: no exports
</code></pre>

<p>And then it just waits infinitely.</p>

<h2>First Approach</h2>

<p>I thought that maybe <strong>supervisor</strong> is causing this and i removed the initial start of <code>supervisord</code>. After killing the process (or rebooting the host) and got no problems or errors at all and everything booted and mounted just fine. <strong>Without starting supervisord everything works as expected.</strong></p>

<p>The supervisord process starts several services:</p>

<ol>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>Mongodb</li>
<li>Nginx</li>
<li>Elasticsearch</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Tornado</li>
<li>Celery</li>
</ol>

<p>These processes use the aforementioned shared folder on my host.</p>

<p>I didn't try yet to isolate one of the services yet.</p>

<p>The thing I don't like is that I have to create a temp variable, <code>attribute</code>, in order to test if it's <code>null</code> or not, and then assign the value to the <code>BgImage</code> variable, <strong>which is a nullable int</strong>.</p>

<p>I was hoping I could figure out a way to write it all on one line, but I cannot figure a way.  I even tried using a ternary statement, but got nowhere:</p>

<pre><code>if (element.TryGetAttributeValue(""bgimage"") != null) ? BgImage = //Convert result to int :  else null; 
</code></pre>

<p>Realistically, my original two lines of code do the job.  I was just hoping to pare it down to one line.  But, if anyone knows how to do what I'm trying to accomplish, I'd love to learn how.</p>

<p>My scenario involves event usage such that for each SomeType1, there's an arbitrary number of SomeType2, with an event associated with it.</p>

<p>Example,</p>

<pre><code>public event SomeEventHandler EventA1EventB1
public event SomeEventHandler EventA1EventB2
public event SomeEventHandler EventA1EventB3

<p>Problem, of course, is that you can't add the above event declaration to a dictionary. For this, I just used,</p>

<pre><code>someType1Dictionary[someLookUpKey1][someLookUpKey2] += someEventOfTypeSomeEventHandler
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, is there a better way of dealing with the above scenario?</p>

<p>And second, when running, the same event/delegate (for any look-up) always fires or I get a null for the returned value in the second dictionary.</p>

<li>the default dropdown behavior of autocomplete would be disabled and the hiding of
elements would actually be done on the child elements of the
school-wrapper div </li>
<li>I'm basically trying to figure out how to use
autocomplete functionality and apply it to the markup of the page
rather than making the default dropdown show yet another list below
the input.  I do not know if it can do this but if so, I'm looking
for direction on how.  I've created the source array for the
autocomplete thus far.</li>

<p>I have an <strong>HTML5 canvas</strong> (which is basically a snapshot from a video stream that I have taken and drawn on to the HTML 5 canvas using drawImage()). On click of a button, I want the image with the following effect to come on the canvas instead of the original image.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ts4Qq.jpg"" alt=""original Image""> 
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/m1NCo.jpg"" alt=""image with focal spotlight""></p>

<p>My problem is that I am able to replicate the effect if I apply the effect on just an image. However, on the canvas it gives me the mask separately and the image separately.    This is the code that I am using for the SVG</p>

<pre><code>&lt;svg height=""0""&gt;
    &lt;defs&gt;
      &lt;mask id=""mask-radial""&gt;

        &lt;feGaussianBlur in=""SourceGraphic"" stdDeviation=""10""/&gt;
      &lt;/filter&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;/defs&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is how I am calling it in <strong>CSS</strong></p>

<pre><code>   .effet{
  width: 500px; height: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto 50px auto;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba(0,0,0,.5);
}
.effet img{
  position: absolute;
}
.filtre--r{
  -webkit-mask: -webkit-radial-gradient( center, closest-side, transparent 50%, black 80%);
  -webkit-mask: radial-gradient( closest-side at center, transparent 50%, black 80%);
  -webkit-filter: blur(40px);
  mask: url('#mask-radial');
  filter: url('#filtre1');
}
</code></pre>

<p>and these are my HTML elements.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""effet""&gt;
  &lt;img src=""/static/images/noEffect.png"" alt="""" /&gt;
&lt;img class=""filtre filtre--r"" src=""/static/images/noEffect.png"" alt="""" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Can somebody please tell me how I can recreate the effect for my canvas? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>This works great, but I reach an issue when I need to test websites that have 'm.' subdomain flexibility for mobile versions. In a live environment, this subdomain would still use the same directory as the normal domain, but I am unable to achieve this in development.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>website.devdomain.com</code> goes to <code>/var/www/website.devdomain.com</code>, and <code>m.website.devdomain.com</code> goes to <code>/var/www/m.website.devdomain.com</code>, but preferably this should go to <code>/var/www/website.devdomain.com</code></p>

<p>Is there a way to make sub-subdomains go to their parent's directory? The current VirtualDocumentRoot snippet I use is <code>VirtualDocumentRoot /var/www/%0/</code></p>

<p>I can create custom document roots on a per-site basis to achieve this, but if there is an automated way with VirtualDocumentRoot it would be much more practical.</p>

I want to combine the slice given by two (or more) tuple calls. This is because I want to include two elements from the same dimension that is not logically structured in a dimensional hierarchy.
An example would be if I wanted to have combine the actuals for 2012 and 2013 without first making separate data items for both.
Then I would have two expressions:</p>

<pre><code>tuple([Actuals], [2012])
tuple([Actuals], [2013])

<p>To illustrate what I want, I would ideally be able to write something similar to these suggestions:</p>

tuple([Actuals], set([2012], [2013]))

<p>However, these suggestions do not work. Hence, I was wondering if there is any other way of combining the slices given by two or more tuple calls, as described earlier in this post.

<p>I'm curently developping a phonegapp client application that connects to an extern Nodejs api.</p>

<p>My client app has the possibility post an object to the API, with this ajax call:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: ""http://localhost:3333/api/bars"",
    data: fields,
    type: ""POST"",
    crossDomain: true,
    xhrFields: {
        withCredentials: true
    },
    dataType: 'json',
    success: function(){
        console.log('success');
    },
    error: function(){
        console.log('error');
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works fine when the post is done, but i need to securise my API by allowing only my client to access to it.</p>

<p>Here is my server configuration:</p>

<pre><code>allowCrossDomain = (req, res, next) -&gt; 
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true)
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'MYCLIENT')
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS')
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'X-Custom-Header, Content-Type, Authorization, Content-Length, X-Requested-With')

if 'OPTIONS' == req.method
    res.send(200)
else
    next()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that i'm able to post from everywhere, ant not only from MYCLIENT.</p>

<p>When I post from a different domain than the one that is allowed on my server, my ajax sends me this error:</p>

<pre><code>XMLHttpRequest cannot load API_URL. The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 
header has a value ALLOWED_CLIENT that is not equal to the supplied origin. 
Origin MYCLIENT is therefore not allowed access.
error
</code></pre>

<p>But still, my bar is added on the API, added from a domain that should not be allowed.</p>

<p>Does anyone already went through this problem, and how did you solve it ? </p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your answers,</p>

<p><code>GenericCharacterFieldMixin</code> is a Mixin of Fields for Characters, that are Generic, i.e. common to all types of characters.</p>

<p>I'd like my Mage Serializer to have these 'mixed in' rather than c/p then between all types of character (Mage is a type of character) hopefully this will increase DRYness in my webapp.</p>

<p>The issue is on the model I have this:</p>

<pre><code>class NWODCharacter(models.Model):

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
        ordering = ['updated_date', 'created_date']

    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    player = models.ForeignKey('auth.User', related_name=""%(class)s_by_user"")
    ....

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    attributes = GenericRelation('CharacterAttributeLink')
    skills = GenericRelation('CharacterSkillLink')
</code></pre>

<p>Which means I get this error:</p>

<p><strong>Django Rest Framework thinks I want to serialize my generic relationship.</strong></p>

<p>If I rename the fields in the model (<code>s/attributes/foos/g</code>, <code>s/skills/bars/g</code>) then I get a different (less clear?) error :</p>

<code>date,time,event,user,net</code> .
I need to go through each line of this file, and if event == start, 
continue till it reach the line with event == end for the same user and net, 
then calculate the time difference between the two events. 
I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
import datetime
import time

with open('dates.csv', 'rb') as csv_file:
    csv_read = csv.reader(csv_file)
    for row in csv_read:
        if row[2]==""start"":
            n1=datetime.datetime.strptime(row[1], '%H:%M:%S')

            for row2 in csv_read:
                if (row2[2]==""End"" and row[3]==row2[3] and row[4]==row2[4]):
                    n2=datetime.datetime.strptime(row2[1], '%H:%M:%S')

                    print row[2],row[1], row2[2], row2[1]

                    diff = n2 - n1
                    print ""time difference = "", diff.seconds
                    break
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem with this code is that when it find a match ""End"" and calculate the time, it will start searching from the line after the with the match ""End"", ignoring the lines before it.
as an example</p>

<pre><code>May,20,9:02:22,2010,start,user1,net-3
May,20,9:02:23,2010,start,user1,net-3
May,20,9:02:55,2010,start,user1,net-2
May,20,9:02:55,2010,End,user1,net-3
May,20,9:03:43,2010,End,user1,net-2
May,20,9:02:55,2010,End,user1,net-3
May,20,9:03:43,2010,End,user1,net-2
May,20,9:03:44,2010,start,user1,net-2
May,20,9:03:49,2010,End,user1,net-2
</code></pre>

<p>will only produce the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Connect 9:02:22 Disconnect 9:02:55
time difference =  33
Connect 9:03:44 Disconnect 9:03:49
time difference =  5
</code></pre>

<p>So does anyone have an idea how to solve this problem, please?
Also is it possible to add the time difference as an extra column to the existing data?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>I've updated the code, but now I'm facing a new problem, my file contains 35734 rows, but the output file contain only 350 rows, I'm confused as to why this happens, and I would appreciate any help, thanks

The thing that makes this a little trickier is that I want to rotate the ""world"" around the ship when it turns, so that the ships front is always facing towards the top of the phone screen. </p>

<p>I've created a group that contains the ""world"" and the ship as well as a group that I call <code>cameraLayer</code> that ""follows"" the ship around. All of this works fine in the sense that I can move the ship around and always keep it in the center of the phone screen. However, I can't seem to get the <code>cameraLayer</code> to rotate properly in relation to the ships rotation. </p>

<p>Here's the code for the two groups:</p>

<pre><code>physicsLayer = display.newGroup()
physicsLayer:insert(bg)
physicsLayer:insert(player)

cameraLayer = display.newGroup()
cameraLayer:insert(physicsLayer)
cameraLayer.rotation = 0
cameraLayer.xScale = 1
cameraLayer.yScale = 1
cameraLayer.anchorX = 0.5
cameraLayer.anchorY = 0.5
cameraLayer.x = centerX
cameraLayer.y = centerY
cameraLayer.angle = 0
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the move function:</p>

<pre><code>local function move()

    player.x = player.x + Cos( Rad(player.angle) ) * 2
    player.y = player.y + Sin( Rad(player.angle) ) * 2 

    cameraLayer.x = cameraLayer.x - Cos( Rad(cameraLayer.angle) ) * 2
    cameraLayer.y = cameraLayer.y - Sin( Rad(cameraLayer.angle) ) * 2   

end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the rotation function:</p>

<pre><code>local function enterFrameListener(key)
    if holding then
        if leftKey.isFocus == true then
            player.angle = player.angle - 3
            player.rotation = player.rotation - 3

            cameraLayer.angle = cameraLayer.angle - 3
        elseif rightKey.isFocus == true then
            player.angle = player.angle + 3
            player.rotation = player.rotation + 3

            cameraLayer.angle = cameraLayer.angle + 3
        end
    else
        -- Not holding
    end
end

<p>I can understand the meaning of degrees on a polynomial kernel, but what about the gaussian (rbf) kernel?
As I can see, the default value is 3 in sklearn's library. I also ran a GridSearch with some numbers I came up with, which estimated 3 as the best value too.
Is it really significant or is this just a misstype?

Upon returning to the home page, users who have not logged out should get a customized experience depending on their preferred settings.  I can do this server side, draw the page html with the custom info before sending the page to the client. The catch is that on the client side, jQuery actually creates certain html elements. I want to initialize these too. So one thought is to send a JSON object along with the page and have JQuery inspect it and draw the elements using the info in the JSON object.  But how can I do that? In the absence of that, All I can think of is to put the info in hidden fields on the page and have JQuery get its data from these fields.  But that is so ugly.  How would you go about this?</p>

<p><strong>The error does not happen when the cache is OFF.</strong>    Please, note that the origin of this query is from complicated fetch relationships written in a way specific for OPENJPA.<br>
It starts from finding the Order containing Fetch group and shipments (interface  ShipOrder).  From the implementation of ShipOrder (PhysicalOrderShipmentImpl ) we fetch  shippingServiceLevelInternal that results in the select statement for TSHIPPINGSERVICELEVEL (see some code below).</p>

<pre><code>@FetchGroup(name = FetchGroupConstants.ORDER_SEARCH, attributes = {

    public void nextBoard(Square[][] sudokuboard) {

                    west = 6;
                }

<p>I'm fairly new with GUI so this might seem like a easy problem to solve, but I've been pulling my hair for a while now...
As I've said, I mange to write nextBoard(Square[][] sudokuboard) to terminal, but so far not to the GUI screen. Can anyone explain what I'm doing wrong here?</p>

<p>I have React.js + Flux powered application: </p>

<ul>
<li>There is a <strong>list view</strong>  of articles (NOTE: there are multiple of of different lists in the app) and article <strong>details view</strong> inside it. </li>
<li>But there is only one API endpoint per each list which returns array of articles. </li>
<li>In order to display the details I need to <code>find</code> article by id in array. That works pretty fine. I trigger action which makes request to server and propagates store with data, when I go to details screen then I just get the necessary article from that array in store.</li>
<li>When user lands on article details view before list (stores are empty) then I need to make a request. </li>
<li>Flow looks like: <code>User loads details view</code> -> <code>component did mount</code> -> <code>stores are empty</code> -> <code>rendered empty</code> -> <code>fetchArticles action is triggered</code> -> <code>request response is 200</code> -> <code>stores now have list of articles</code> -> <code>component did update</code> -> <code>rendered with data successfully</code> </li>
<li><p>Component could look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>let DetailsComponent = React.createClass({
   _getStateFromStores() {
       let { articleId } = this.getParams();
       return {
           article: ArticleStore.getArticle(articleId)
       };
   },

   componentDidMount() {
       // fire only if user wasn't on the list before
       // stores are empty
       if (!this.state.article) {
          ArticleActions.fetchArticles('listType');
       }
   },

   render() {
      return &lt;ArticleDetails article={this.state.article} /&gt;;
   }
});
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The interesting part comes next:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Now I need to make another request to server but request options depend on the article details</strong>. That's why I need to make second request after the first one on the details view.</li>
<li>I've tried several approaches but all of them look ugly. I don't like calling actions from stores that makes stores too complicated. Calling action inside action in this case doesn't work well because I will need to find article from store inside that action.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution (?!)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>What I've came up with is to use callback in action inside component and it feels much more cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>let DetailsComponent = React.createClass({
   _getStateFromStores() {
       let { articleId } = this.getParams();
       return {
           article: ArticleStore.getArticle(articleId)
       };
   },

   componentDidMount() {
       if (!this.state.article) {
          ArticleActions.fetchArticles('listType', () =&gt; {
              this._requestAdditionalData();
          });
       }
       this._requestAdditionalData();
   },

   _requestAdditionalData() {
       if (this.state.article) {
          ArticleActions.fetchAdditional(this.state.article.property);
       }
   },

   render() {
      return &lt;ArticleDetails article={this.state.article} /&gt;;
   }
});
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

There's no error here - the program executes the update without error and the input values are what they should be. For instance, I take the record for the person with the name ""First Last"", and tell the code to change it to ""Work Please"", but after updating, the database shows that it has been changed to ""-1 Last"". Nothing but the FirstName changes - and FirstName changes to -1 regardless of what I put in.</p>

<p>Relevant snippet: I've debugged it to the point where it executes it, and all the values are there - even ""Joe"". But instead, it decides to update the whole record with no changes except for FName being ""0"" or ""-1"". </p>

<pre><code>sql = ""UPDATE Member SET FName = ? and LName = ? and Email = ? and ""

<p>When I load a site that requests an authentication challenge, (responds with HTTP 401), my <code>UIWebViewDelegate</code> only receives the following callbacks: <code>webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType:</code> and sometimes <code>webViewDidStartLoad:</code> (<code>webViewDidStartLoad:</code> seems to be called if I navigate directly to the site, and it seems not to be called if I'm redirected there).</p>

<p>By overriding <code>-[NSObject respondsToSelector:]</code>, the <code>UIWebViewDelegate</code> receives some calls to <code>uiWebView:resource:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace:forDataSource:</code> and <code>uiWebView:resource:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:fromDataSource:</code>, which could be useful, but of course those are private API and will probably get my app rejected.</p>

<p>I've tested a few different mainstream apps with embedded <code>UIWebView</code>s. So far, only Chrome handles these authentication challenges properly. I've even set up my own server and validated that Chrome only <code>POST</code>s once. Twitter and Tweetbot fail just show the loading screen forever, just like mine. </p>

<p>Is there another (probably very hacky) way to detect these authentication challenges other than using a second speculative <code>NSURLConnection</code>? If I make a <code>POST</code> request, that will double-<code>POST</code> everything, which is bad.</p>

For instance, splitting [123]*** into a column with 123 (no brackets) and column with ***. Here's what I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>require(reshape2)
# create dataframes
  df1 &lt;- data.frame(var=c(""item1"", ""item2""),
                    var.se.1=c(""[123]**"", ""[456]""),

                    var.se.2=c(""[34]**"", ""[2]""))
</code></pre>

<p>I have:  </p>

<pre><code># df1
#     var var.se.1 var.se.2
# 1 item1  [123]**   [1]***
# 2 item2    [456]    [45]*
</code></pre>

<p>I want:</p>

<pre><code>#     var var.se.1 var.se.1.ast var.se.2 var.se.2.ast
# 1 item1      123           **        1          ***
# 2 item2      456                    45            *
</code></pre>

<p>I tried:</p>

<pre><code># create list of dataframes
  dfs &lt;- list(df1, df2)
# loop through dataframes
  for (i in 1:length(dfs)) {
    # index columns with .se in the name
      seCols &lt;- grep("".se"", names(dfs[[i]]))
    # loop through every column with .se in the name
      for (s in seCols) {
        # remove [, which will leave ] to split on
        # want to get rid of [] anyway
          dfs[[i]][,s] &lt;- gsub(""\\["", """", as.character(dfs[[i]][,s]))
        # split into two columns on ]
          dfs[[i]] &lt;- cbind(dfs[[i]],
                            colsplit(dfs[[i]][,s],
                                     pattern = ""\\]"",
                                     names = c(names(dfs[[i]][s]),
                                               paste(names(dfs[[i]][s]),

      }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The code is mostly doing what I want it to do, but the results are not being stored in the dataframe. If I run the loop and then run <code>dfs[[i]]</code>, so when <code>i==2</code>, I get the following:</p>

<pre><code># i == 2
dfs[[i]]
    var var.se.1 var.se.2 var.se.1 var.se.1.ast var.se.2 var.se.2.ast
1 item3      7]*    34]**        7            *       34           **
2 item4   89]***       2]       89          ***        2 
</code></pre>

<p>I need to delete columns 2 and 3, but other than that, it works. Just need to get columns 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (column naming is correct) into <code>df1</code> and <code>df2</code> (<code>df2</code> in this case).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>My actual use case is more complex than the MRE and breaks @Tyler's code. The problem seems to be related to my real dataframes having different numbers of observations. If we redefine <code>df2</code> to have 3 rows, and leave <code>df2</code> to have 2 rows, R will throw an error when running @Tyler's code: ""Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE) : arguments imply differing number of rows: 2, 3""</p>

<pre><code>df2 &lt;- data.frame(var=c(""item3"", ""item4"", ""item5""),
                  var.se.1=c(""[7]*"", ""[89]***"", ""new""),
                  var.se.2=c(""[34]**"", ""[2]"", ""rows""))

<p>However when I click a link to <a href=""https://myapp.com/link"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myapp.com/link</a>, Chrome complains that the app is trying to load from an insecure source. I get the following message in the console:</p>

<p>""[blocked] The page at '<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/page/app_###"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/page/app_###</a>' was loaded over HTTPS, but ran insecure content from '<a href=""http://myapp.com/link/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myapp.com/link/</a>': this content should also be loaded over HTTPS.""</p>

<p>Now the link is an absolute URL with the https prefix, yet apparently the page is trying to load from the http version.</p>

<p>I visited the domain itself and checked the Network tab in the Chrome console to see what was happening. The following happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>The GET to <a href=""https://myapp.com/link"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myapp.com/link</a> is a 301, moved permanently.</li>
<li>This then redirects to <a href=""http://myapp.com/link"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myapp.com/link</a></li>
</ol>

<p>As far as I can tell, there is nothing in my python code to make this happen, so I suspect  some feature of Heroku is causing this, but I haven't been able to find anyone else with this problem.</p>

<p>As a side note, I used Flask-SSLify to add a redirect back to the https version. This redirect works, but Chrome still blocks the page because it passes through the insecure version.</p>

<p>I also reviewed the response and the json object comes correctly formatted and with only one record.</p>

<p>My project is a Ruby bot that uses the <a href=""https://github.com/sprsquish/blather"">Blather</a> library to connect to a Jabber server.  The problem is that when there is a problem with the server and Blather generates an exception the whole program exits and I have no opportunity to catch the exception.</p>

<p>Here is some simple code that shows the problem.  There is no Jabber server running on localhost so the Blather client throws an exception.  I was under the impression that EM.error_handler{} would be able to intercept it but I never see the <code>**** ERROR</code> message and the program just stops.  :(</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'blather/client/client'

EM.run do
  EM.error_handler { puts "" **** ERROR "" }

  Blather::Stream::Client.start(
    Class.new {
    }.new, 'echo@127.0.0.1', 'echo')
end

<p>I think the problem is that Blather also uses EventMachine and maybe is calling EM.stop, which causes the external EM instance to stop.</p>

<p>But UIImage doesnt want to convert it AsPng() in order to convert it to stream. In this case I've noticed that CGImage is empty, most of properties set to 0. Perhaps, there is some way to convert the CIImage itself, without any wrapping? </p>

Each one of my tools opens a modal dialog using the .ShowDialog() method.  My client wants to be able to open a PDF document from the tools that will serve as the help documentation tool rather than a traditional method like HTMLHelp or Windows Help Viewer.<br>
So, I've imported the Interop.AcroPDFLib.dll and set up a form with an AxAcroPDF (veiwer) object on it.  Whenever the user clicks the help button on any of the tool dialogs, the help form opens using .Show() and goes to the associated page in the document using the .setCurrentPage method.  Everything works great up to this point.</p>

<p>However, as you can imagine, because the tool dialog is modal, it blocks the user from being able to interact with the PDF form.  So, what I need is a technique to prevent this block so that the user will be able to scroll pages, click links within the PDF, etc. while the tool dialog is open.  I.e., I need a solution that will mimic using the traditional HTMLHelp veiwer.</p>

<p>I've tried opening the PDF form in a new thread, but that causes ArcMap to crash at Application.Run(New PDFForm).  Maybe this is because I have very little experience with multithreading, or maybe because ArcMap does not support multithreading.  Not sure.</p>

<p>My Doubt here is, 1) As i dont have backup of .p12, should i need to raise a request for new certificate from my keychain and proceed with that?
                  2) If so, will users can be able to upgrade the existing app from the appstore?</p>

<p>My question is why doesn't <strong>d.bark()</strong> compile? The bark method has an access modifier of <em>protected</em>, which allows it to be accessed from classes in the same package or subclasses. So what's going on?</p>

<p>If the husky reference is able to access the bark method, by the same logic the dog reference should also be able to access the bark method. </p>

<p>So I can only assume that there must be an issue with the Dog reference?</p>

<li>When the user plays a song using my app, then the default music player should get stopped(is playing)</li>
<li>And if some other application starts playing when my app is already playing then mine should get stopped.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am able to work out with the 1st point using <a href=""http://developer.android.com/training/managing-audio/audio-focus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Audio Focus</a>.
But for the 2nd point, i.e. Handling <code>AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS</code>, i'm facing some issues.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
I've followed the documentation but how should I register my music player service to detect that AudioFocus has been lost.</p>

<p><strong>For 1st Point, here is the code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if (reqAudioFocus()) {
    mPlayer.start();
}

private boolean reqAudioFocus() {
    boolean gotFocus = false;
    int audioFocus = am.requestAudioFocus(null, AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC,

    if (audioFocus == AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_GRANTED) {
        gotFocus = true;
    } else {
        gotFocus = false;
    }
    return gotFocus;
}

<p><strong>For 2nd point my code so far:</strong></p>

<pre><code>//Class implements OnAudioFocusChangeListener

@Override
public void onAudioFocusChange(int focusChange) {
    /*
     * TODO : Call stopService/onDestroy() method. Pause the track; Change

    } else if (focusChange == AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN) {
        // TODO: Resume Playback
        if (!mPlayer.isPlaying()) {

For each of these drills I wish to display a drop down list of any drill assumptions the user may have saved.  Below is the relvent code.
From the controller</p>

<pre><code>...
@drill_interests = @company.drill_interests
first_index = 0
@drill_interests.each do |di|
  @array_name = ""eval_assum"" + first_index.to_s
  @array_name = Array.new
  @matched_eval_assum = 
    EvaluationAssumption.matched_eval_assum(@current_user.id,  di.drill_id)
  second_index = 0
  if @matched_eval_assum.present?
    @matched_eval_assum.each do |mea|
      data_for_select = {""id"" =&gt; second_index, ""name"" =&gt; mea.user_save_name, 
            ""table_index"" =&gt; mea.id,}
      @array_name = @array_name &lt;&lt; data_for_select
      second_index += 1
    end
  else
    puts ""no matches found""
  end 
  first_index += 1 
end 
</code></pre>

<p>Endevouring to create arrays eg. eval_assum0, eval_assu1 etc which have 0 to many hashes of id, name and table index.
Having set trace statements I know I am looping through the data in the expected manner.  However my attempts to access the arrays, see below, seem to indicate I haven't built the array as expected.  It seems ""eval_assum0"" is a string (not an array).  What have I done wrong ? 
As always thanks in advance - Pierre</p>

<pre><code>...    &lt;% index = 0 %&gt;
...
    &lt;% @array_name = ""eval_assum"" + index.to_s %&gt;
      &lt;%= select(""name"", ""id"",
          @array_name.collect {|r| [ r[""user_save_name""], r[""id""] ] },

<p>Further carification.
So for example company EML is invested in two drill - (eg. drill-01 and drill-02).  The user has saved 2 evaluation_assumptions for drill-01 and 3 evaluation assumptions for drill-02 .  Of course a company canhave invested in 0 to many drills.
On Eml page next to Drill-01 trying to create adrop down list (with two selections) and next to Drill-03 (hree selections.  Thanks</p>

I've read all the threads about numeric sorting, but couldn't find a working solution for my problem, yet. I'm storing my numbers in an jQuery data attribute called <code>sort-count</code></p>

<p>This is my dataTables initialization:</p>

<pre><code>$('.wp-list-table').dataTable({
    ""aoColumns"": [
        null,
        null,
        null,
        { ""sType"": ""numeric"", ""sSortDataType"": ""numeric-data-attribut"" },
        { ""sType"": ""numeric"", ""sSortDataType"": ""numeric-data-attribut"" },
        { ""bSortable"": false, ""bSearchable"": false },
    ],
    ""bJQueryUI"":true,
    ""bPaginate"":true,
    ""sPaginationType"":""full_numbers""
});
</code></pre>

<p>And this is my custom afnSortData function to catch the values before sorting:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.fn.dataTableExt.afnSortData['numeric-data-attribut'] = function ( oSettings, iColumn )
{
    var aData = [];
    jQuery( 'td:eq('+iColumn+')', oSettings.oApi._fnGetTrNodes(oSettings) ).each( function () {
        aData.push( parseInt( jQuery(this).attr('data-sort-count'), 10 ) );
    } );

    console.log(aData);

    return aData;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>console.log(aData)</code> is showing the following output when clicking multiple times on the column to sort it. As you can see, it fetches the right values, they are all numeric, but it is sorting them completely randomly.</p>

<p>Now when clients log in, they see this row in their table for that day.</p>

<p>Then clients can make modifictaions and the system needs to recalulate the times like in the below example:</p>

<p>Suppose that the client enters <code>10am - 11am</code> as ""meeting time"" . Then I need to create three rows in the system like this</p>

ROW 2    10AM  11AM
ROW 3    11AM  5PM

ROW 2    10AM  11AM
ROW 3    11AM  3PM

<p>I am also thinking if he enters something weird like <code>8am to pm</code> then I think the system will have to delete all previous enteries.</p>

<p>While googled I saw many suggested about Bouncy Castle. But I did not clearly understood about this Bouncy Castle. Is this an algorithm ?.  </p>

<p>I need to encrypt/decrypt password for sending to server. In all other phone (Android, iPhone, Blackberry), we use AES/ECB/PKCS7Padding algorithm for this. They all give same ecrypted/decrypt result for our input. But in windows phone I used AesManaged Class for the encryption. But it gives different encrypted result. In the msdn documentation (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.aesmanaged%28v=VS.95%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN documentation</a>) about AESManaged class they said ""The cipher mode is always CBC, and the padding mode is always PKCS7"". I think maybe thats why here I am getting different encrypted result comparing to other phones. </p>

<p>Is that the problem here ?. If its, then how can I use AES/ECB/PKCS7Padding algorithm in WP7 ?</p>

<p>I dont see any property for setting the cipher mode in AesManaged class.</p>

</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>So as in the file ""command_history.txt"", there is only one line stored, I reassumed that it would return this one line in an array of chars. To test I printed the results:</p>

<pre><code>    cmd = getSavedCommand();
    printf(""|%s|"",cmd);
</code></pre>

<p>And the result I get is: </p>

<pre><code>   arj@arj-Inspiron-1545:~/projet$ ./a.out 
   |ls -l /home/arj
   �|
   arj@arj-Inspiron-1545:~/projet$ 
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is:</p>

<pre><code>         |ls -l /home/arj|
</code></pre>

<p>I think the EOF is creating the problem. Can someone help me?</p>

"27594038","1","27612590","","2014-12-21 21:29:43","","-2","76","<p>I've run into an issue with portability of code that I've written that I wish to distribute, it isn't. The Makefiles that I send along require a lot of editing before users can compile and optimize the code for their systems, which is something I'd like to avoid (obviously). I've been looking into automake and autoconf lately and I've been able to successfully generate a configure script to generate Makefiles for my system. The problem is that I can't seem to get it to work on machines that don't have autoconf or automake installed or just a different version. So I don't have to put it all here, I've been able to replicate these results with a simpler ""hello world"" program</p>

<p>hello.c</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main(){
  cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello World"" &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Makefile.am</p>

<pre><code>bin_PROGRAMS=hello
hello_SOURCES=hello.c
</code></pre>

<p>Then I run autoscan. I don't particularly care about the versions here, so I just move <code>configure.scan</code> to <code>configure.ac</code>. Then I run automake. Just for the sake of completeness, I get these errors:</p>

<pre><code>configure.ac: error: no proper invocation of AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE was found.
configure.ac: You should verify that configure.ac invokes AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE,
configure.ac: that aclocal.m4 is present in the top-level directory,
configure.ac: and that aclocal.m4 was recently regenerated (using aclocal)
Makefile.am: error: required file './INSTALL' not found
Makefile.am:   'automake --add-missing' can install 'INSTALL'
Makefile.am: error: required file './NEWS' not found
Makefile.am: error: required file './README' not found
Makefile.am: error: required file './AUTHORS' not found
Makefile.am: error: required file './ChangeLog' not found
Makefile.am: error: required file './COPYING' not found
Makefile.am:   'automake --add-missing' can install 'COPYING'
configure.ac:7: error: required file 'config.h.in' not found
Makefile.am: error: required file './depcomp' not found
Makefile.am:   'automake --add-missing' can install 'depcomp'
/usr/share/automake-1.13/am/depend2.am: error: am__fastdepCC does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
/usr/share/automake-1.13/am/depend2.am:   The usual way to define 'am__fastdepCC' is to add 'AC_PROG_CC'
/usr/share/automake-1.13/am/depend2.am:   to 'configure.ac' and run 'aclocal' and 'autoconf' again
/usr/share/automake-1.13/am/depend2.am: error: AMDEP does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
/usr/share/automake-1.13/am/depend2.am:   The usual way to define 'AMDEP' is to add one of the compiler tests
/usr/share/automake-1.13/am/depend2.am:     AC_PROG_CC, AC_PROG_CXX, AC_PROG_OBJC, AC_PROG_OBJCXX,
/usr/share/automake-1.13/am/depend2.am:     AM_PROG_AS, AM_PROG_GCJ, AM_PROG_UPC
/usr/share/automake-1.13/am/depend2.am:   to 'configure.ac' and run 'aclocal' and 'autoconf' again 
</code></pre>

<p>So I fix the errors:</p>

<pre><code>touch NEWS README AUTHORS ChangeLog
automake --add-missing
add `AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(hello, 1.0)` to configure.ac
aclocal
autoheader
automake
</code></pre>

<p>And then the only error I get is the fact that automake doesn't like the number of argument that I pass into <code>AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE</code>. Then I run <code>autoconf</code> and <code>configure</code>. The configure script does it's thing and generates a usable makefile. Now the problem is when I try to move it to a different system.</p>

<p>I can get the configure script to run, but then I get the following error when I try to <code>make</code></p>

<pre><code>cd . &amp;&amp; /bin/sh /home/dbwy/autohell/missing automake-1.13 --gnu
/home/dbwy/autohell/missing: line 81: automake-1.13: command not found
WARNING: 'automake-1.13' is missing on your system.
         You should only need it if you modified 'Makefile.am' or
         'configure.ac' or m4 files included by 'configure.ac'.
         The 'automake' program is part of the GNU Automake package:
         &lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/automake&gt;
         It also requires GNU Autoconf, GNU m4 and Perl in order to run:
         &lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf&gt;
         &lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/&gt;
         &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;
make: *** [Makefile.in] Error 1
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems as though my problem is in the fact that the Makefiles that get generated by <code>configure</code> are implicitly dependent on <code>automake</code>. I know in my experiences using configure files in the past that this isn't always required (because I just installed the autotools suite to generate this project), so I'm wondering how I can do this? I.e. how can I create a configure file that I can give to any UNIX-type machine and have them be able to install it without having automake or autoconf (I run into a problem with autoconf on a Mac). My end goal is to be able to give someone the source tree and configure script and have them be able to customize which compiler they use, etc...</p>

<p>These error pages have a couple images (a background and a logo). Both are loaded the usual way (not using any rails helpers):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""Checklick-Logo-White-Transparent.png"" alt=""Checklick Logo"" style=""width: 100%""&gt;

<p>On production, when I try to load these pages (<code>app.checklick.com/500.html</code>), they load just fine. </p>

<p>However, when I get an <em>actual error</em> on the app, and those same error pages are loaded, for some reason, the image paths get a controller name appdended to them (ie they become <code>app.checklick.com/programs/Checklick-Logo-White-Transparent.png</code>). The controller then tries to perform an action using that image filename as an argument, which causes yet another error. And of course, the browser can't render either images, so the error pages themselves look broken. </p>

<p>Any idea how/why the controller name would be added to the image request during an actual error?</p>

<p>I have created a simple Inline Pattern class that encapsulates matched expression in a div tag. My regex is as follows: <code>r'(\{mytag_start\})(.+)(\{mytag_end\})'</code> which then is put inside <code>""^(.*?)</code> --- <code>(.*?)$""</code> by the markdown.inlinepatterns.Pattern class upon compilation, so that the compile method is called as <code>re.compile(""^(.*?)%s(.*?)$"" %r'(\{mytag_start\})(.+)(\{mytag_end\})')</code>.</p>

<p>At a first glance this does seem to do the trick, however I've noticed that all line breaks need to be hardcoded as <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<p>So</p>

<pre><code>{mytag_start}This code&lt;br&gt;
will work{mytag_end}

<p>However, the following code breaks the entire markdown</p>

<pre><code>{mytag_start}This code

will not{mytag_end}

<p>So instead I just get the entire above block unprocessed in plain text.</p>

<p>I tried supplying re.MULTILINE and re.DOTALL to the <code>re.compile</code> but it didn't help. Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>public ServiceClass(Resource someResource)
</code></pre>

<p>We need to inject an instance of the service class into a Groovy class of our app using Spring DSL, with the Resource referring to an XML file within our /src/main/resources. I tried to create the Spring config for this purpose, but so far I couldn't find a working solution. The relevant part of the config file looks like this</p>

<pre><code>beans = {
    xmlns aop:""http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"",
    sec:""http://www.springframework.org/schema/security"",
    context:""http://www.springframework.org/schema/context""

    serviceClass(com.somepackage.ServiceClass) {
      //here we need to refer to the constructor arg XML file some way
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried multiple syntaxes found in various tutorials, e.g. closure for beanDefinition.constructorArgs, but unfortunately without success so far. Although neither the app compilation (grails:war) nor the startup (grails:run-app) indicates any problems with the bean wiring, when the app is actually loaded into the browser, we receive a NPE stating that our Groovy class into which the service class is injected, is a null object. So it seems that the bean wiring was not successful after all. Any help is appreciated</p>

I don't have a strong programming background (I'm learning) and so I'm hoping that someone can simply help explain a part of this for loop. (Note this is using ggplot2 among some other packages)</p>

<pre><code>files &lt;- unique(SQLTable$file_names)
for (i in 1:3){
    dat &lt;- subset(SQLTable,file_names==files[])

        facet_grid(Measure ~., scales = ""free"")
    print(g)

<p>Don't worry about SQLTable, file_names, id, or Value, those are all either a SQL table or column names. The code above is a part of a larger script but I'm trying to figure out what the (i in 1:3) is doing in the for loop. I pretty much get everything else thats going on in the loop but I've modified it to be (i in 1:2) all the way to (i in 1:100) and it doesn't seem to make much of a change. So whats the purpose? Why is it specifically 1:3? I hope that doesn't rely on other things but if it does, maybe you can just explain what that part is doing?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> When I run that section of code, I get the following message 6 times.

<p>App store is not required as these are private projects.  Ad Hoc seems to be limited to 100 pre-identified devices which again isn't ideal and Enterprise is for 250+ applications? So how can you develop an app for the iphone with an unknown number of client installs from say 50 to 150?  </p>

<p>I want to give the client the app (ipa) and let them control who they give/sell it too, is this even possible?</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice</p>

<p>It seems like I need a migration in the way that ActiveRecord (I've played around a little with that ORM) handles migrations. Or I would need to change the column name with SQL or an app or the Firefox SQLlite plugin.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I'm wondering now if this is more a SQLite thing than a DataMapper thing. When I went to delete a column in Firefox's SQLite Manager plugin I got this message: </p>

<p>This is a potentially dangerous operation. SQLite does not support statements that can alter a column in a table. Here, we attempt to reconstruct the new CREATE SQL statement by looking at the pragma table_info which does not contain complete information about the structure of the existing table.</p>

<p>Do you still want to proceed?</p>

For a certain case I need the HTML5 <em>audio.ontimeupdate()</em> Event to trigger, but seeing as only <em>click, dbclick, focus, (...)</em> are handles with the standard Meteor package, I am having problems triggering this Event.</p>

<p>Is there a Possibility to trigger this Event otherwise?</p>

<p>Here is a Code Sample:</p>

<p>radio.js</p>

<pre><code>Template.audioPlayer.helpers({

    audio:function(){
        audioSource = videos.findOne({_id:Session.get(""playlist"")[Session.get(""queue"")]});
        myAudio = new Audio();
        myAudio.src = audioSource.source;
        return audioSource.source
    }
});

Template.audioPlayer.events({   

    'click #mainPlay':function(){          
          myAudio.play();
     },

     'click #mainPause':function(){         
        myAudio.pause();
     },

     'myAudio.ontimeupdate':function(){
        console.log(""Current Track Position is: "" + myAudio.currentTime);
     }      

 });
</code></pre>

<p>In this case i would like the program to simply log the current position of the audiofile. 
Any ideas?</p>

Each of these will need the context, but I can think of multiple ways to give it to them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add it as a parameter to each draw function call</li>
<li>Add it as a global variable</li>
<li>Call ""getContext"" in each draw method.</li>
<li>Extend the prototype of ´CanvasRenderingContext2D´.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't like to use global variables if I can avoid it, so I'm phasing out option 2. Option 3 requires way too much code duplication, so I also ignore that.</p>

<p>This leaves me with choice 1, which is how I would do it in a non-functional language and 4 which is in my opinion the cleanest approach, but I'm not entirely sure it won't lead to problems. How do you do it? Is there a reason why I shouldn't go with option 4?</p>

<p>To illustrate this, I'll add a code example for each of the remaining option. Here's option 1:</p>

<pre><code>function drawPerson(context, ...) {
    context.fillRect(...);
    ...
}

$(function() {
    var context = $(""#canvas"")[0].getContext(""2d"");
    drawPerson(context, ...);
});
</code></pre>

<p>And here option 4:</p>

<pre><code>CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.drawPerson = function(...) {
    this.fillRect(...);
    ...
}

$(function() {
    var context = $(""#canvas"")[0].getContext(""2d"");
    context.drawPerson(...);
});

I tried to memory map some files , and I found that I am not able to map any more files when the ""Mapped"" usage comes close to the ""MemTotal"" ( viewed via cat /proc/meminfo).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From /proc/meminfo on the 64 bit linux box :</p>

<p>Why would it prevent the hosts on subnet B to connect to hosts on subnet A and through them to SrvA (since they, according to the task solved and correct answer, would continue to have access to SrvA)?</p>

<p>1a) why it would prevent the direct connection to a host (with a server) from another network at all? </p>

<p>2)</p>

<p>Why does the ability of a server to communicate influence the communication abilities of hosts on a network?</p>

<p>2a)
Are servers needed for hosts to communicate with hosts on another subnetwork?</p>

<p>2b) and why only with foreigners - hosts from another network?</p>

<p>Why the absence of default gateway address on a server would prevent the hosts from another network to communicate with a server if there is only one possible external output (through a router separate from servers) between networks, i.e. anything not-found locally should probably be destined by router to another network ?</p>

<p>3)</p>

<p>What is the difference between ""connect"" and ""establish session""?</p>

<hr>

<p>[1]</p>

<p>2 private neworks A and B are connected by a router.</p>

<p>A server named SrvA (in subnetwork A) functions as an intranet Web server for the human resources (HR) department. </p>

<p>A server named SrvB (in subnetwork B) is a Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server mail server.</p>

<p>SrvA contains confidential documents that must be accessed daily by users on only the A subnet.</p>

<p>All users must be able to connect to SrvB.</p>

<p>You want to configure the TCP/IP properties of SrvA to prevent any computer in the  subnet B from establishing a session with SrvA.</p>

<p>What should you do?</p>

<hr>

<p>[2]
Explanation to correct answer ""Configure SrvA with no default gateway address""</p>

<p>In order to communicate with SrvA, the clients in the network B have been
configured with a default gateway address, that is, the address of the router. </p>

<p>For SrvA to communicate with the clients in the network B, it has to be
configured with a default gateway address (the address of the router). Removing the
default gateway from SrvA will prevent computers residing in the subnet B from establishing a session with SrvA. </p>

<p>SrvA will however continue to be able to communicate with clients in the network B. 
This will ensure that the confidential files will be accessible only by users on the 
subnet A.</p>

<p>I have a simple UIDatePicker initialized like this:</p>

<pre><code>self.picker = [[UIDatePicker alloc] init];
self.picker.datePickerMode = UIDatePickerModeTime;
self.picker.calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
self.picker.timeZone = [NSTimeZone localTimeZone];
self.picker.date = self.initialDate;
[self.view addSubview:self.picker];
</code></pre>

<p>This is done in the viewDidLoad method of a simple view (no xib, no interface builder, just plain code).</p>

<p>Now I have a button, which retrieves the date and ""processes"" it.</p>

<pre><code>NSDate* selected = self.picker.date;
NSLog(@""%@"", selected);

NSDateComponents* components = [self.picker.calendar components:(NSHourCalendarUnit | NSMinuteCalendarUnit | NSSecondCalendarUnit) fromDate:selected];
NSLog(@""0001-01-01 %02i:%02i:%02i +0000"", components.hour, components.minute, components.second);

[components setSecond:0];
NSLog(@""0001-01-01 %02i:%02i:%02i +0000"", components.hour, components.minute, components.second);

selected = [self.picker.calendar dateFromComponents:components];
NSLog(@""%@"", selected);
</code></pre>

<p>Since the date picker will not allow the user to set seconds, I just want to reset them to zero (because I need to compare dates later).</p>

<p>When I select ""16:00"" (which is 4:00 pm) The log output is:</p>

<pre><code>2012-05-21 17:43:48.428 Green Thumb[26828:fb03] 0001-01-01 14:55:36 +0000
2012-05-21 17:43:48.428 Green Thumb[26828:fb03] 0001-01-01 16:00:56 +0000
2012-05-21 17:43:48.429 Green Thumb[26828:fb03] 0001-01-01 16:00:00 +0000
2012-05-21 17:43:48.429 Green Thumb[26828:fb03] 0001-01-01 14:54:40 +0000
</code></pre>

<p>So the original date taken from the picker is completely off. The time taken from the components (which is created based on the date from the picker) is correct, as is the corrected time. But when I put the components back in a NSDate instance, it all gets messed up again (but differently).</p>

<p>Me and google we are both out of ideas, so I hope we can create some new ones here!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance, LetzFlow</p>

<p>PS: I'm testing this with the iPhone 5.1 Simulator.</p>

<p>EDIT #1:</p>

<p>I've tracked down the actual problem, but I'm stuck again:</p>

<p>I've tracked it down to the following point: I'm storing the dates in the NSUserDefaults object.</p>

<pre><code>NSUserDefaults defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
[defaults setValue:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:[time timeIntervalSince1970]] forKey:@""notification.time""];
</code></pre>

<p>And here I get them out again:</p>

<pre><code>NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
NSNumber num = [defaults valueForKey:@""notification.time""];
NSDate* time = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:[num floatValue]];
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting enough: What goes in, is not what comes out! But why? :)</p>

<p>EDIT #2:
And last but not least I've solved it myself. Thankfully, because it's the most stupidest mistake ever.
NSTimeInterval is not a float but a double. And while up until now I never ran into any problems with using a float saving it in the NSUserDefaults seems to have brought forward the errors.</p>

<pre><code>Create table #SH ([date] datetime,
        sched_id int,
        agent_id int)

Create table #SD (sched_id int,
        start_minute int,
        length int,
        exception_code int)
</code></pre>

<p>(Schema and design is something I can't change unfortunately, both temp tables are loaded from flat files.  I can introduce and load new temp tables if needed).</p>

<p>A little background - The #SH header table holds a persons schedule as 'Start_minute' and goes for 'schedule_length' in minutes.  For example, if start minute and schedule length were both 480, that would read as 8am (8am = 480th minute) and goes until 4pm (480 minutes later, 4pm = 960th minute)</p>

<p>The #SD table holds exceptions to the header.  In the example above, the person would likely have a lunch exception which would be start_minute = 720 and length of 30 (12:00 - 12:30).  </p>

<p>Date and agent_id is the only thing I'm interested out of #SH, the exception info in #sd is what I'm interested in.</p>

<p>This query works:</p>

<pre><code>Select [date],#sd.start_minute,#sd.length,#sd.start_minute + #sd.length as 'end_minute',agent_id
from #SH 
inner join #SD on #SD.sched_id = #sh.sched_id
</code></pre>

<p>*end_minute is ultimately a calculated value of start+length = end</p>

<p>This returns something like:</p>

<pre><code>   Date     Start  length   end

1 2010-11-11 600    30  630

2 2010-11-11 630    40  670

3 2010-11-11 750    15  765

4 2010-11-11 800    40  840
</code></pre>

<p>Now I wish I could say this was over and walk away...but data entry issues exist.  In line 1 and 2, the end time of line 1 lines up with the start time in line 2 and should be combined so my results look like this :</p>

<pre><code>Date     Start  length     end

1 2010-11-11 600    70  670

2 2010-11-11 750    15  765

3 2010-11-11 800    40  840
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea's on how to build this logic so I get the 3 lines back instead of 4?  I'm working on joining the table to itself on #sd1.start + #sd1.length = #sd2.start for now.</p>

<p>And to further complicate...the example above was 2 lines that needed combined.  I've come across a record that had 30 1 minute entries in succession that I will need to make into a single record.  Fortunately they cannot overlap (you won't have 2 records occupying the same minutes), but I don't think the join statement I'm considering above will work for that.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem :-</strong></p>

<p>So far so good. I am facing new difficulty. 
I am having a view with a Div within which data is rendered through json. I am rendering one of my partial view as Json. This partial view shows a list in which paging need to be implemented. I dont want to postback instead new rendered json need to be shown in the Div.</p>

<p>The code</p>

<p><code>&lt;%=Html.PageLinks(Model.Pager, x =&gt; Url.Action(""Index"", new { Current = x }))%&gt;</code></p>

<p>actually generates the numbered boxes, what i want is to attach a JS function on these numbered boxes instead of a url.</p>

<p>I tried like </p>

<p><code>&lt;%=Html.JQueryPageLinks(Model.Pager, x =&gt; ""MyJSFunction("" + x + "")"")%&gt;</code> </p>

<p>where x represents the page number. Creating another extension but seems no luck.</p>

<p>Here is the code -</p>

<p>it displays the data that doesn't exist correctly, but when it does exist, the code under the 'if' doesn't run. I put error_reporting on, and all the lines that the data does exist for, it shows an error for all those lines, which is good, it's finding the lines that do exist within the database, yet the stuff under the if don't run why?

We have software that communicates with hardware but sometimes something
goes wrong and we are no longer to communicate with it, until we restart the software.</p>

<p>I have tried forcing TcpClient.Close() and even setting it to  null but that doesn't work.
Only a complete restart of the software works.</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

<hr>

<p>I can't use the using keyword because TpcClient is only defined in one location, but used throughout the library. (And there is only one connection at any given time)</p>

<p>It's a library that handles communication. The software itself can call the ResetConnection() method of the Controller class (which represents the hardware).</p>

<p>It currently looks like</p>

<pre><code>if (tcpClient != null)
{
    tcpClient.Close();
    tcpClient = null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now from what I've read here I should use tcpClient.Dispose() instead of "" = null""</p>

<p>I'll give that a try and see if it makes a difference.</p>

<p>I've spent a few days building the Linq to Entities query to use projection. All was well on the surface until I looked at the generated SQL statement underneath. Gasp!</p>

<p>I next spent another few more days trying to rid these UNION statements from the SQL statements, trying JOINs, FROMs, INCLUDEs, anything that would just give me inner/left outer joins with the related entities loaded.</p>

<p>But I haven't been able to do this successfully and still stuck at this point.</p>

<p>Some points to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>L2E query contains multiple related (child) entities with projection (no issue here unless this is a bad design, i.e. causing the UNIONs)</li>
<li>Created summary classes that fit the anonymous types, e.g. StudentSummary</li>
<li>Summary classes only contain a few of the columns of the entity object's columns for performance reasons - don't need to return all columns on initial search</li>
<li>Recently started using PredicateBuilder to return students from a search, e.g. male students with a specialization... All good in this area (so far).</li>

<p>I'm not sure why are UNIONs being used here. Perhaps I'm using projection poorly. Although I have noticed when two or more projections are included in your L2E statement then UNIONS appears in SQL.</p>

<p>I've tried going in another direction by removing the projections but unsuccessfully tried using Joins, Froms... just can't seem to get the related child entities being returned.</p>

<p>I can't use Include as I'm using my summary objects for performance reasons.</p>

<p>I'm also questioning if I'm going about this correctly now, i.e. am I going in the right direction of returning nested related (child) entities?!?! Perhaps I should be returning flat results, e.g. Students, Campuses, Specializations... objects all at the same level, i.e. remove the hierarchy.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>

<p>If I built this with T-SQL I would be using INNER &amp; LEFT OUTER JOINs to return the related child nested entities and also filter students. This is what I'm trying to achieve with Linq to Entities. How can I do this? E.g. with joins, projection, or whatever... (without the UNIONs and Cast(NULL)s...</p>

<p>Appreciate any help, even if it's just pointing me in the right direction, as I'm really stuck here. Thanks.</p>

<p>Specifically when default value is added, the following additions are made to the definition: <code>this:_b40c.NewArg=""test""</code> and <code>xmlns:this=""clr-namespace:""</code>
<code>xmlns:this=""clr-namespace:""</code> is invalid as it doesn't point anywhere and can't be parsed with <code>ActivityXamlServices.Load(stream);</code> (it throws XamlObjectWriterException: ""'Cannot set unknown member '{clr-namespace:}_b40c.NewArg'.' ...)
This seems to occur whatever the specified type of the argument is.</p>

<p>Any idea what could be causing this?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I was using an <code>ActivityBuilder</code> to utilise the activity in the first place. This was fine, but as I hadn't provided it with a name, it had to generate a key, in the example above <code>_b40c</code>. <code>ActivityXamlServices.Load</code> has some kind off issue processing these keys. However, simply defining a name for <code>ActivityBuilder</code> seems to do the trick.</p>

<p>This still doesn't answer why it creates <code>xmlns:this=""clr-namespace:""</code> without an actual namespace.</p>

In particular, I am developing an application using the Oracle example of an FXML Address Book as a starting point (<a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/fxml_get_started/fxml_tutorial_intermediate.htm#CACFEHBI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/fxml_get_started/fxml_tutorial_intermediate.htm#CACFEHBI</a>). What I want to do now, is to add a column with a button associated with each entry of the phone book. For example, a button that when clicked shows, on another table, more data regarding that name entry. I want to do this using FXML. Searching the web I found some resources on how to create a button column, but they look kind of confusing and it seems they don't use FXML, which is what I need. 
Anybody can suggest me some tutorial or hint?
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Edit: I started my work following this tutorial (<a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/fxml_get_started/fxml_tutorial_intermediate.htm#CACFEHBI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/fxml_get_started/fxml_tutorial_intermediate.htm#CACFEHBI</a>). Part of what I want to do, is described here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16360323/javafx-table-how-to-add-components"">JavaFX table- how to add components?</a>. However, this example doesn't make use of fxml. What I am trying to do is mixing the codes.
So, I have a fxml file (taken from the oracle tutorial linked above) where the table is declared, this way:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;TableView fx:id=""tableView"" GridPane.columnIndex=""0"" 
    GridPane.rowIndex=""0""&gt;
    &lt;columns&gt;
        &lt;TableColumn fx:id=""Names_column"" text=""Table"" prefWidth=""100""&gt;
            &lt;cellValueFactory&gt;&lt;PropertyValueFactory property=""name"" /&gt;
            &lt;/cellValueFactory&gt;
            &lt;cellFactory&gt;
                &lt;FormattedTableCellFactory alignment=""center""&gt;                        
                &lt;/FormattedTableCellFactory&gt;
            &lt;/cellFactory&gt;
        &lt;/TableColumn&gt;

        &lt;TableColumn text=""Color"" prefWidth=""100""&gt;
            &lt;cellValueFactory&gt;&lt;PropertyValueFactory property=""color"" /&gt;
            &lt;/cellValueFactory&gt;                
        &lt;/TableColumn&gt;  

        &lt;TableColumn text=""Button"" prefWidth=""100""&gt;          
        &lt;/TableColumn&gt;                                  
    &lt;/columns&gt;

    &lt;items&gt;
        &lt;FXCollections fx:factory=""observableArrayList""&gt;
            &lt;ColTab name=""Table 1"" color=""1""   /&gt;  
            &lt;ColTab name=""Table 2"" color=""2""   /&gt;
            &lt;ColTab name=""Table 3"" color""1""   /&gt;
        &lt;/FXCollections&gt;
    &lt;/items&gt;

&lt;/TableView&gt;

<p>Then, I took a look at the other example (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16360323/javafx-table-how-to-add-components"">JavaFX table- how to add components?</a>). In this example, everything is made only using Java, but for my purpose, I need to use fxml.
In my .java main file, I did this:</p>

<pre><code>       TableColumn&lt;ColTab, ColTab&gt; btnCol = new TableColumn&lt;&gt;(""pulsanti"");
   btnCol.setMinWidth(150);
   btnCol.setCellValueFactory(new Callback&lt;CellDataFeatures&lt;ColTab, ColTab&gt;, ObservableValue&lt;ColTab&gt;&gt;() {

<p>This code is copied from the second example I linked, and actually is not too clear to me. What I see is that it creates a new column and sets some properties. The last line of code (commented out) adds this column, and some other ones, to a table, which was previously declared in the original .java file and which I didn't declare, since I already declared the table in the fxml file. Now I am looking for a way to integrate this column that I am defining in the .java file, in the table that I declare in my .fxml file. 
I know that what i am saying might look very messy, but I am really new to JavaFX and fxml, and not all the details are clear to me.</p>

<p>Edit2:
My code for the controller looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class FXMLDocumentController implements Initializable {

@FXML
private TableView&lt;ColTab&gt; tableView;    
tableView.getColumns().add(btnCol); 


@Override
public void initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb) {
    // TODO
}    
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Now I am getting an error that says:</p>

<p>package tableView does not exist</p>

<p>identifier expected</p>

<p>';' expected</p>

<p>I am using Netbeasn as ide.</p>

<p>My use-case is as follows:</p>

<p>There is a certain set of classes which need to be visible to all Java classes executing within the framework/SMX runtime. You might suggest to simply create a bundle out of the classes and export the relevant packages. However, in my SMX runtime, even WAR files can be deployed.
I don't think WAR's installed within the SMX framework can also utilise the Import/Export-Package feature. So I basically need to have this set of classes available to all other classes in a manner similar to say <code>java.util.List</code> is available.</p>

<p>In Tomcat, this can be done by placing the JAR within the lib/endorsed directory. However, I believe SMX doesn't declare any endorsed directories. So I created an endorsed directory within the <code>%JAVA_HOME%\jre\lib\</code> folder. But my classes fail to get resolved. </p>

<p>Any assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4612387/dynamically-add-reference-of-wcf-service"">Dynamically add reference of WCF service</a></p>

<p>However, there is one class library, which references a WCF service - let's call it CL1.
Then there are multiple projects - let's call them P1 and P2 - which reference to CL1.</p>

<p>How it looks like now:
There are two versions of CL1, just because I don't know how to dynamically add a wcf service reference.
So it looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1 uses CL1 Version 1. </p>
  
  <p>P2 uses CL1 Version 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I would rather inject the URL of the service from PL1 and PL2 into CL1. So I don't have to maintain two versions!</p>

<p>So it should rather look like this:</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1 and P2 inject Service-URL into CL1. CL1 adds or updates the service reference (generate reference.cs and rebuilds itself).</p>

So with that I mind, I installed <a href=""http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/maven/maven-2/2.2.1/binaries/apache-maven-2.2.1-bin.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">Maven 2.2.1</a> while my system uses the <strong>64-bit</strong> JDK 6.</p>

<p>I tried to verify that it is correctly installed by running <code>mvn --version</code> and what I received in response was:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory.
JAVA_HOME = ""C:\Windows:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_37""
Please set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the
location of your Java installation
</code></pre>

<p>I am suspecting that Maven expects the <strong>32-bit</strong> version of Java and that it cannot deal with 64-bit Java. Is this true?</p>

<p>If indeed this is the case, setting the <code>%JAVA_HOME%</code> environment variable to point the 32-bit version (already installed) is <strong>not</strong> what I would like to do because it will then fail other tools installed on my PC that count on it pointing to the 64-bit version.</p>

<p>Is there a way around this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Problem solved by inserting into <code>maven.bat</code> the following line (just before <code>=== START VALIDATION ===</code>):</p>

<pre><code>set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_37
</code></pre>

<p>This way, this <code>%JAVA_HOME%</code> environment change is localized to Maven and is not visible outside.</p>

<p>If there is a better solution, I would be happy to know about it.</p>

If you can even suggest a vague topic for me to look into it would be great as I have been banging my head against this all day with zero progress.</p>

<p>So, I have built a little image display widget (Flash CS6, FlashPlayer 10.3, AS3).
It is simply a container clip into which I load a a stack of images (wrapped in a custom class), one on top of the other but offset a little so that the side of each is visible to be clicked.</p>

<p>Each of the images listens for <code>MouseEvent.ROLL_OVER</code> and becomes the active image when this happens, I also have a listener attached to the <code>stage</code> of their container clip that listens for <code>Event.MOUSE_LEAVE</code> and updates the display when the user is not actively engaging with the Flash area.</p>

<p>Everything works fine when I run within Flash and also when I test in Chrome but in FF and Safari when I mouse out of the Flash area, as well as the expected <code>MOUSE_LEAVE</code>, a <code>ROLL_OVER</code> is also registered by the very bottom image in the stack. This means that whenever you mouse out in the affected browsers the bottom image always becomes active rather than the last one you actually rolled over.</p>

<p>Any thoughts, even vague possibilities, would be great because I am stumped. This is either some really tiny detail of Flash event propagation that I'm not getting or some stupid mistake that I've over thought into a mountain :)</p>

<p>Right now I will take what-ifs, maybes, legends, riddles, anything!</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3MJDJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Basically, I need a layout which allows me to control each square by using left/top values. Each square will be added dynamically, therefore each square will be a Fragment. What layout can I use? I've done this in .Net in a metro app using UserControls for each square, all added to a Canvas layout. What would be the equivalent in Android?</p>

<p>I created an android background service that is called every 2 minutes. When its called it starts listening for locationUpdates for GPS and NETWORK for 40 seconds. Extracting useful information( lat, long, accuracy, provider ... ) And sent the data to a server. </p>

<p>When i run the application on the emulater it works fine. ( Well i dont get real gps information, just the default values of all the variables, but i know my service is called every two minutes and sends the data to the server ) </p>

<p>So when i run the application on a real device, its working perfect for something like 40 minutes. Then , i guess , something is closing my service. ( maybe android itself because of memoryconsumpiton or whatever )</p>

<p>Has anybody an idee of how i can track down the bug , or even what could be the bug???</p>

<pre><code>function success() {
    console.log('User accepted');
}

function deny() {
    console.log('User rejected');
}

navigator.webkitGetUserMedia({video: true, audio: true}, success, deny);
</code></pre>

<p>The site I'm developing absolutely needs the use of the user's webcam and microphone (actually, using Flash, but that seems to go through this API now), so I'm trying to do everything to ensure the user always knows what they need to click for the site to work.</p>

<ul>
<li>If neither function is called, assume the dialog is showing, and display instructions to the user.</li>
<li>If deny is called, explain that webcam access is needed, and show them they can click the camera icon in Chrome's URL bar to change their decision.</li>
<li>Of course, if success is called, then the user has accepted, and continue as normal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the kicker; and you could follow along by pasting the above Javascript into any site you like (in Chrome). If the user navigates to a new webpage, or refreshes the current page without either accepting, denying, or dismissing the dropdown, <em>they will not see a permissions dialog again for the current domain for the browser session</em>.</p>

<p>Calling <code>navigator.webkitGetUserMedia(...)</code> again will <strong>not</strong> show a permissions dialog, nor will the camera icon even appear in the URL bar. The console doesn't even log ""User rejected"". What's more, for many users this dropdown is very easy to accidentally ignore. The only fix available is to close the browser entirely and re-open it (or, to manually navigate through complicated settings menus that we DON'T want to force our users into).</p>

<p>Can I confirm with anyone here whether this is 'somehow' intended, or if there's something I'm missing?</p>

I get that null terminated strings, arrays with no length and a few other things are bad (billions of dollars on buffer overflow exploits) but to completely remove null?</p>

<p>Some languages have made null a thing of the past and other languages have attempted at being a replacement for C but I cannot find which language has accomplished both.</p>

<p>That said, my problem lies with a few factors: The queries come from a series of classes. This is the essential function being used:</p>

<pre><code>public function query($query, $params = array())

<p>When I run the SQL queries through MYSQL on their own, they run perfectly fine...and I get the correct responses every time.</p>

<p>When I test this, however, the $rec_to_upload results come back as a single record, rather than the 9 that should show. It doesn't run the foreach loop more than the once. If I run the numrows function we have to determine the number of rows, it's correct on the first query, but it retains its result the first time through for the inside query, then goes to 0 and bounces between 0 and 1. The properties table is empty, so it should be 0 all the way through.</p>

<p>I can't do $rec['city'] because it's running one record only. If I do $rec_to_upload['city'] there's a result, but this is still not a solution for multiple records.</p>

<p>And while it should change ""type"" for all records to either original or duplicate, it's leaving some as uploads.</p>

<p>Finally, the results of the first query seem to be pushing through twice: I'm getting both the associative results and the numerical results.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any help you can provide. If you have any questions to help clarify, I'm more than happy to answer them.</p>

<p>Results: It recorded 62 records. There are 9 records, and there are 30 columns. It looks like it's gone through and put one record in field by field with the fields as separate records...both the associative and the numerical, rather than entering the rows in.</p>

Using the command line I am able to produce a WAR and deploy that in my container (Tomcat). I then run it and it works fine.</p>

<p>My next step was to import my project structure into IntelliJ. IntelliJ sees everything fine, and is able to compile it all. I have tested this by doing a maven clean first, and then let IntelliJ do the rest (rebuild project).</p>

<p>The last step is to let it run in my container. I have set up the run configurations before for web apps (they do not use war overlays), and they worked just fine. In this case I set it up just like before and point to my exploded webapp artifact.</p>

<p>Once I run tomcat, it does not find my webapp. I find that the overlay has not been merged into the target directory of the project (which normally is the case when just doing maven install). IntellJ however has created an overlays directory in my project and unpacked the (overlay/super) WAR file in there.</p>

<p>I get it working when I do a maven install myself, and then run Tomcat in IntelliJ. Which is obvious, because all sorts of needed files are now in my target directory (like a web.xml for example :)).</p>

<p>What I want is this:
- IntelliJ knows that when it runs Tomcat, it should have prepared the target directory just like ""mvn install"" or ""mvn package"" would do.</p>

<p>What it does:
- It does something in between. It does create a target dir, and it does copy resources from the webapp project. It does not overlay any WAR dependency, hence the webapp target dir is incomplete.</p>

<p>Anyone has any tips to solve this?</p>

<pre><code>myClass.addListener(new FancyInterfaceListener({
    void onListenerInterestingAction(Action a){
        ....interesting stuff here
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>So for example to handle an UIActionSheet call I have to declare another method in the same class, which seems a bit silly if I want to pass it data, because I'd have to store that data as a global variable. Here's an example of deleting something with a confirmation dialog asking you if your sure:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)deleteItem:(int)indexToDelete{
    UIActionSheet *confirm = [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle:@""Delete Item?"" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@""Cancel"" destructiveButtonTitle:@""Delete"" otherButtonTitles:nil];
    [confirm showInView:self.view];
    [confirm release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the UIActionSheetDelegate in the same class:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)actionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex{
    if (buttonIndex == 0){
    	[[Settings sharedSettings] removeItemAtIndex:/*need index variable here*/];
    	[drinksTable reloadData];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to be able to do is declare it inline, just like I did in the java example at the top. Is this possible?</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; nodes.length; i++) {
    the_table_color = nodes[i].getAttribute(""table_color"");

    link_for_deletion = nodes[i].getAttribute(""link_for_deletion"");
    comment = nodes[i].getAttribute(""comment"");

<p>As you can see from above I have this bit:</p>

<pre><code>td = document.createElement(""td""),
    td2 = document.createElement(""td""),
</code></pre>

<p>and the reason for that is, if I do not have the ""td"" declared again, the first one gets overwritten and the second one does not display...<br>
A) Is that the right way of doing this? (not sure if this is the right approach,I came about the solution of declaring another variable to get it to work, but it seems like extra code)  </p>

<p>Then this line of code:</p>

<pre><code>strong.appendChild(document.createTextNode(the_type));
</code></pre>

<p>just adds all the stuff from the loop in there :(<br>
For example of the first iteration of the for() loop has <code>abc</code> and the second had <code>def</code> it displays abcdef instead of abc the first time and def the second.<br>
B) Why is that and how do I fix it?</p>

One contains actual latencies from an experiment in the first column (e.g. 0.345, 0.455... never more than 3 decimal places), along with other data from that experiment. The other contains what is effectively a 'look up' list of latencies ranging from 0.001 to 0.500 in 0.001 increments, along with other pieces of data. Both data sets are X-by-Y doubles.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is something like...</p>

<pre><code>for i = 1:length(actual_latency) 
   row = find(predicted_data(:,1) == actual_latency(i))
   full_set(i,1:4) = [actual_latency(i) other_info(i) predicted_info(row,2) ...

<p>...in order to find the relevant row in <code>predicted_data</code> where the look up latency corresponds to the actual latency. I then use this to created an amalgamated data set, <code>full_set</code>.</p>

<p>I figured this would be really simple, but the find function keeps failing by throwing up an empty matrix when looking for an actual latency that I <em>know</em> is in <code>predicted_data(:,1)</code> (as I've double-checked during debugging). </p>

<p>Moreover, if I replace find with a for loop to do the same job, I get a similar error. It doesn't appear to be systematic - using different participant data sets throws it up in different places. </p>

<p>Furthermore, during debugging mode, if I use find to try and find a hard-coded value of <code>actual_latency</code>, it doesn't always work. Sometimes yes, sometimes no.</p>

<p>I'm really scratching my head over this, so if anyone has any ideas about what might be going on, I'd be really grateful.</p>

<p>Look how the second column is named <code>COLUMN_VALUE</code>. Looks like a generated name by one of the construct CAST/MULTISET or TABLE.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>With the accepted answer below, I checked the documentation and found that the TABLE mechanism is a <em>table collection expression</em>. The expression between rounded brackets is the <em>collection expression</em>. The documentations defines a mechanism called <strong>left correlation</strong> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The collection_expression can reference columns of tables defined to
  its left in the FROM clause. This is called left correlation. Left
  correlation can occur only in table_collection_expression. Other
  subqueries cannot contains references to columns defined outside the
  subquery.</p>

<pre><code>database.Users.Select(c =&gt; c).Skip(10).Take(10);
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that I am now projecting a set of results from multiple tables and I want to page on the overall set (and still get the benefit of paging at the DB).</p>

<p>My entity model looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>A campaign [has many] groups, a group [has many] contacts</strong></p>

<p>this is modelled through a relationship in the database like</p>

<p><strong>Campaign -> CampaignToGroupMapping -> Group -> GroupToContactMapping -> Contact</strong></p>

<p>I need to generate a data structure holding the details of a campaign and also a list of each contact associated to the campaign through the CampaignToGroupMapping, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>Campaign
   CampaignName
   CampaignFrom
   CampaignDate
   Recipients
      Recipient 1
      Recipient 2
      Recipient n...
</code></pre>

<p>I had tried to write a LINQ query using .SelectMany to project the set of contacts from each group into one linear data set, in the hope I could .Skip() .Take() from that.</p>

<p>My attempt was:</p>

<pre><code> var schedule = (from c in database.Campaigns
                 where c.ID == highestPriority.CampaignID
                 select new PieceOfCampaignSchedule
                 {
                     ID = c.ID,
                     UserID = c.UserID,
                     Name = c.Name,
                     Recipients = c.CampaignGroupsMappings.SelectMany(d =&gt; d.ContactGroup.ContactGroupMappings.Select(e =&gt; new ContactData() { /*Contact Data*/ }).Skip(c.TotalSent).Take(totalRequired)).ToList()

                 }).SingleOrDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the paging (with regards to Skip() and Take()) is happening for each group, not the entire data set. </p>

<p>This means if I use the value 200 for the parameter <em>totalRequired</em> (passed to .Take()) and I have 3 groups associated with this campaign, it will take 200 from each group - not 200 from the total data from each group associated with the campaign.</p>

<p>In SQL, I could achieve this with a query such as:</p>

<pre><code>select * from
(
    select [t1].EmailAddress, ROW_NUMBER() over(order by CampaignID desc) as [RowNumber] from contacts as [t1]
    inner join contactgroupmapping as [t2] on [t1].ID = [t2].ContactID
    inner join campaigngroupsmapping as [t3] on [t3].ContactGroupID = [t2].GroupID
    where [t3].CampaignID = @HighestPriorityCampaignID

) as [Results] where [Results].[RowNumber] between 500 and 3000
</code></pre>

<p>With this query, I'm paging over the combined set of contacts from each group associated with the particular campaign. So my question is, how can I achieve this using LINQ To SQL syntax instead?</p>

    liquibase.setDataSource(dataSource);
    liquibase.setChangeLog(""classpath:/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.xml"");

<p>It currently has a single changeset. When the changeset gets applied by running the application, a record is inserted into <code>DATABASECHANGELOG</code> as expected with a <code>FILENAME</code> of <code>classpath:/db/changelog/0.0.1/db.changelog.xml</code></p>

<p>When I execute a <code>liquibase rollbackCount 1</code>, the response is <code>Liquibase Rollback Successful</code>, but the change did not get rolled back. </p>

<p>After manually rolling back the change (deleting the table created by the changeset), I do a <code>liquibase update</code>. The update is successful, but the <code>FILENAME</code> is <code>db/changelog/0.0.1/db.changelog.xml</code>.

<p>The Qt API is really confusing to understand when it comes to using and it was fine for my projects because I could accomplish what I wanted in a really ""hacky"" way a my set book on the subject is very poorly laid out...</p>

<p>Let me get to the point, what would be a clean way of using QInputDialog and QMessageBox in this scenario:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;QApplication&gt;
#include &lt;QInputDialog&gt;
#include &lt;QDate&gt;
#include &lt;QMessageBox&gt;

int computeAge(QDate id) {
  int years = QDate::currentDate().year() - id.year();
  int days = QDate::currentDate().daysTo(QDate
              (QDate::currentDate().year(), id.month(), id.day()));
  if(days &gt; 0) 
    years--;
  return years
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  QApplication a(argc, argv);
  /*  I want my QInputDialog and MessageBox in here somewhere */
  return a.exec();
}
</code></pre>

<p>For my QInputDialog I want the user to give their birth date (don't worry about input validation)
I want to use the QMessageBox to show the user's age</p>

<p>I just don't understand what parameters need to go into the QInputDialog and QMessageBox in a basic case like because there don't seem to be any examples out there.</p>

<p>How would I accomplish this?</p>

<p>To elaborate with code, I read the image into memory with ImageIO utility class like so:</p>

<p><code>BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(imageFile);</code></p>

<p>and later on use this loop to retrieve pixel information:</p>

<pre><code>Matrix imageMatrix = new Matrix(image.getHeight(), image.getWidth());
Raster raster = image.getData();
double[] pixelColor = new double[4];
for (int x = 0; x &lt; image.getWidth(); x = x + 1) {
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; image.getHeight(); y = y + 1) {
        raster.getPixel(x, y, pixelColor);
        double pixelColorAverage = (pixelColor[0] + pixelColor[1] + pixelColor[2]) / 3.0;
        imageMatrix.set(y, x, pixelColorAverage);
    }
}
return imageMatrix;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that <code>raster.getPixel(x, y, pixelColor);</code> returns each RGB value in 8 bits (in my test image, the 0,0 pixel value is returned as 24,24,24 [8 bit values] when it should be 6168,6168,6168 [16 bit values]).</p>

<p>I've tried changing the simplistic <code>ImageIO.read(imageFile)</code> to the following lines of code based on another <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2898311/reading-and-writing-out-tiff-image-in-java"">stack overflow tiff question</a>:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(file);
BufferedImage convertedImage = new BufferedImage(image.getWidth(), image.getHeight(), BufferedImage.TYPE_USHORT_565_RGB);
convertedImage.createGraphics().drawRenderedImage(image, null);
</code></pre>

<p>But this time, the <code>raster.getPixel(x, y, pixelColor);</code> returns 3,6,3 which isn't correct either.</p>

<p>Based on the fact that ImageIO has support for tiff images and buffered image has a 5-6-5 style 16 bit image format, I can only assume this is possible, but I'm stumped as to what I'm missing.</p>

If I then go in console and manually execute a <code>$('.selectpicker').selectpicker('refresh')</code> it then works. <br/>I got it temporarily working by doing a patch and adding a <code>.selectpicker('refresh')</code> inside a <code>$timeout</code> but as you know it's not ideal since we're using <code>jQuery</code> directly in an ngController...ouch!<br/><br/>So I believe the directive is possibly missing a watcher or at least something to trigger that the <code>ngModel</code> got changed or updated. <br/><br/>Html sample code: </p>

&lt;/div&gt;

<pre><code>// get list of languages from DB
dataService
    .getLanguages()
    .then(function(data) {  
        vm.languages = data;

        // need a timeout patch to properly refresh the Bootstrap-Select selectpicker 
        // not so good to use this inside an ngController but it's the only working way I have found
        $timeout(function() {
            $('.selectpicker, select[selectpicker]').selectpicker('refresh');
        }, 1);

"2276031","1","2315558","","2010-02-16 20:19:50","","2","1756","<p>I always strive to increase my productivity when developing applications and in the span of the last few years, I can say that I have made good steps towards increasing that productivity, but I still find I need more tools or methods. I need to edit faster and learn touch typing (currently in the process) and therefore I find a need to move to Vim. It has been now over one year I have trashed Windows and moved to Linux (Ubuntu to be more precise) and I am using the IDE <a href=""http://www.zend.com/products/studio/"" rel=""nofollow"">Zend Studio</a> combined with <a href=""http://www.aptana.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Aptana Studio</a> for developing OO PHP5.3 websites. Although the IDE does everything I would need from an IDE (which I will enumerate shortly), it lacks the editing mode Vim would give. </p>

<p>So my question is: how would I have all the same following 'killer features' I already have within this IDE in Vim? </p>

<p>Here is the extensive list of features I need to keep the productivity at an high level for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Code completion for PHP5.3, not just PHP5 and not just the PHP functions, but any libraries that are added to the buildpath, such as <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Zend Framework</a> and my own library.</p></li>
<li><p>Code formatting, I don't use it much, except for XML files, but that is something I would need soon as I will start to lead more people within my company and formatters will help to keep the code coherence.</p></li>
<li><p>I use <a href=""http://www.oxygenxml.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Oxygen XML editor</a> within Zend Studio (eclipse) for editing <a href=""http://www.docbook.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Docbook XML</a> technical documentation. It has already proven of great quality to me and I would like to keep it.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax validation for any file extensions that can be used on the Web, mostly for me would be PHP5.3 syntax, html syntax (not that important), CSS, Javascript (that's why I have Aptana Studio integrated with Zend Studio, their javascript editor is great with JQuery support)</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe a git integration just like <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/egit/"" rel=""nofollow"">EGit</a> (eclipse plugin)? Not required but a nice addon.</p></li>
<li><p>Debugging features (already using it through the ZendDebugger)</p></li>
<li><p>Powerful searching within files</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know that is a lot, but I am already having all this within my IDE and as I said, I feel the need to move to mode based editors like Vim to be more productive when typing and I feel the learning curve and time invested in setting up all of this will be well worth the effort.</p>

<p>I know that there is <a href=""http://eclim.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Eclim</a>, which integrates eclipse to its daemon and I am thinking of using just that, if anyone has feedback on Eclim used with Zend Studio that would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Along with Eclim, if I need more vim plugins to achieve my needs, I would gladly appreciate it if someone could direct me to them.</p>

                    &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The property that it is bound to, in my viewmodel, looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>Public Property notifCodeSubs As dsPeruseFM
    Get
        If _notifCode Is Nothing Then
            _notifCode = New dsPeruseFM
        End If

    End Get
    Set(ByVal value As dsPeruseFM)
        MsgBox(""If you can see this, success!"")
    End Set
End Property
</code></pre>

<p>In the codebehind I create an instance of the viewmodel and set the datacontext of the xaml to that instance, rather simple... </p>

<pre><code>Dim vm As New ctrlAlertNotifyVM
</code></pre>

<p>As well as:</p>

<pre><code>ctrlAlertNotifyXML.DataContext = vm
</code></pre>

<p>The above configuration compiles and reads data just fine. The grid is populated with all the correct data, etc. The problem comes when I try to add <code>Mode=twoway</code> to the ItemsSource on the datagrid. At that point VS2010 spits out the following error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A TwoWay or OneWayToSource binding cannot work on the read-only property 'notification_configuration' of type 'PeruseFM.dsPeruseFM'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm quite sure that all of my properties are read/write. And while the set command for this is nothing more than a message box at this point, it doesn't seem like I can even access that. </p>

<p>So the question is... has anybody ever encountered this issue before?</p>

<p>Update, response to question ""What does notification_configuration look like?"" from sixlettervariables:</p>

<p>Basically, in the backend ASP.NET code we're using normal response.redirect() calls, and sometimes, in Safari, we'll just get a ""server is down"" kind of error, as if Safari can't connect to the server.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this error is not consistent, so it's been hard to find a pattern.</p>

<p>Also, one of the developers reported that this was even happening on normal anchors (i.e. no postback event, just a new request).</p>

<p>What could be happening? Anyone experience this before?</p>

<p>I'm guessing it's either something to do with server redirects (but what could affect the browser??) ...or, perhaps, some of our pages are loading weirdly...like, maybe we're handling Page_OnLoad twice or something, and Safari thinks it's in a loop...? but that's not it...</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>We put the domain info of the site we were having problems with in our hosts file, and the problem went away.</p>

<p>So, it seems to be that safari is sometimes timing out on the DNS lookup.</p>

I am attempting to modify values in packets sent to and from my Iphone, of course I can't directly view and tamper with packets directly from my phone. So I've connected my phone via proxy to my computer (windows) so I could attempt to modify the packets their. Now I can successfully view and save packets but I can't seem to find a way to modify them on the fly. </p>

<p>I've followed many suggestions posted here such as scapy and other tools like it yet I can't seem to get them to work on windows at all, also i'm not sure these tools are even right for my end goal. I am familiar with modifying live packets on programs like WPE Pro, but I don't think that's the right tool for the job. </p>

<p>My question is this, is this the right path for accomplishing my goal? If so do you have a suggestion for tools that may help? If not, where should I begin looking for different solution?</p>

<p>Edit: Specifically I am aiming to alter hex code in the packet. In the http 1.1 packets I want to alter, I know the exact position of a certain group of hex values that translate to a plain text number. For example, say on line 80 is some hex equaling ""value:12345"". I want to alter that ""12345"" part to different numbers, keeping everything else the same so my phone will process that different value instead.</p>

<p>The problem I have with using WCF is so granular, whereas this wee framework has everything I need to message packets, has a nice dsl, partly based on xpath predicates, and it's a perfect fit.

A few weeks ago I read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11317973/string-similarity-how-exactly-does-bitap-work"">this</a> entry where a user asked how one performs exact string match which was answered by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/11320966/1959534"">Matthew Slattery</a> that I found helpful, however he never went over how one performs fuzzy. After some searching I found a blog entry by <a href=""http://ntz-develop.blogspot.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">Nikita Smetanin</a> that describes the rules for fuzzy:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/TtIyK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But no matter what sort of examples I try with I never get the expected result. Below is a short example that should work for exact string matching and one-incorrect string matching:</p>

<pre><code>Text: ABB
Pattern: AB
R: 000
j: 0

s[A]: 001
s[B]: 110
s[Unknown]: 111

Exact match:
j = 0)
    &lt;&lt;R =&gt; R = 001
    t[0] = A, s[A] = 001

    s[A] AND R =&gt; 001 AND 001 = 001 =&gt; R = 001
    j = j+1 = 1

j = 1)
    &lt;&lt;R =&gt; R = 011
    t[1] = B, s[B] = 110

    s[B] AND R =&gt; 110 AND 011 = 010 =&gt; R = 010
    j = j+1 = 2

j = 2)
    &lt;&lt;R =&gt; R = 101
    t[2] = B, s[B] = 110

    s[B] AND R =&gt; 110 AND 101 = 100 =&gt; R = 100
    j = j+1 = 3
</code></pre>

<p>No t[3] to be found, exact is finished. Found one match. This works as expected but straight out the gate I have problem when performing k=1:</p>

<pre><code>One-incorrect match, k=1:
j = 0)
    &lt;&lt;R =&gt; R = 001
    t[0] = A, s[A] = 001

    Insertion   : (R AND s[A]) OR R[k-1, j] =&gt; (001 AND 001) OR 000 = 001
    Deletion    : (R AND s[A]) OR Bitshift(R[k-1, j+1]) =&gt; (001 AND 001) OR 011 = 011
    Substitution: (R AND s[A]) OR Bitshift(R[k-1, j]) =&gt; (001 AND 001) OR 001 = 001
    R           : Insertion OR Deletion OR Substitution =&gt; 001 OR 011 OR 001 = 011

    j = j+1 = 1
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see deletion finds an extra (start of) match which seems really strange to me and my question behind this long post is where did I go wrong?</p>

Rather than managing those numbers by hand (heaven forbid I want to change something), I thought I might use my trusty hammer python for the task.</p>

<p>SVG 1.1 doesn't natively support any kind of variable scheme that would let me do what I want, and I'm not interested in introducing javascript or unstable w3c draft specs into the mix. One obvious solution is to use string formatting to read, parse, and replace variables in my SVG file. This seems like a bad idea for a larger document, but has the advantage of being simple and portable.</p>

<p>My second though was to investigate the available python->svg libraries. Unfortunately, it seems that the few options tend to be either too new (<a href=""http://codeboje.de/pysvg/"" rel=""nofollow"">pySVG</a> still has an unstable interface), too old (not updated since 2005), or abandoned. I haven't looked closely, but my sense is that the charting applications are not flexible enough to generate my documents.</p>

<p>The third option I came across was that of using some other drawing tool (cairo, for instance) that can be convinced to put out svg. This has the (potential) disadvantage of not natively supporting the absolute element sizes that are so important to me, but might include the ability to output PDF, which would be convenient.</p>

<p>I've already done the googling, so I'm looking for input from people who have used any of the methods mentioned, or who might know of some other approach. Long-term stability of whatever solution is chosen is important to me (it was the original reason for the hand-coding instead of just using illustrator). </p>

<p>At this point, I'm leaning towards the first solution, so recommendations on best practices for using python to parse and replace variables in XML files are welcome.</p>

<p>I read that on Macs, sans-serif will pull in Helvetica as its first choice, and on Windows, it will be Arial. In the my dev tools, if I change sans-serif to Helvetica, it changes the font and fixes the problem, rather than the font looking exactly the same, which is what I expected.

Actually, now that I've played with it a bit more, I found that when I select Korean, the non-Korean words are rendered in Apple Gothic, for Chinese the non-Chinese words are in Century Gothic, and for Japanese the non-Japanese words are in Avant Garde. Any thoughts on why? I could just create a rule set that assigns Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif as the font stack for these languages, but any explanation on what's going would be a great learning experience. </p>

<p>Edit: When I mentioned Apple Gothic, Century Gothic, and Avant Garde, what I meant was that for each of the Asian languages, I changed 'sans-serif' to some other font name in my dev tools to see if I could determine what sans-serif font was being defaulted to in CJK for the non-Asian words on the page. I find it weird that Chinese, Japanese and Korean each used a different sans-serif font. </p>

<p>I've been made an answer but still more than 1 second. I try to use polynominal.</p>

<p><strong><em>So, how I can reduce the time to find n-th place from digits above?</em></strong></p>

<p>This is my answer, (PHP):</p>

<pre><code>function digit_pol ($n) {

  $counter = 1;
  $digit_arr = array();

  for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= $n; $i++) {

    for ($j = 0; $j &lt; strlen($i); $j++) {

      // If array more than 100, always shift (limit array length to 11)
      if($i &gt; 10) {
        array_shift($digit_arr);
      }

      // Fill array
      $digit_arr[$counter] = substr($i, $j, 1);

      // Found
      if($counter == $n) {
        return $digit_arr[$counter];
      }

      $counter++;
    }

  }

}

/**
 * TESTING

$find_place = 1000000;

$result = digit_pol($find_place);

echo ""Digit of "" . $find_place . ""th is &lt;b&gt;"" . $result . ""&lt;/b&gt;"";

I am trying to display the WorkItems in a Kendo Grid.  The Action is returning Json, but nothing is displayed in the grid.<br>
If I create an anonymous object with just the properties I want to display, it works.
That indicates that an Entity (WorkItem) that has a relationship (WorkItemNote) cannot be displayed in a Kendo Grid.<br>

<pre><code> public ActionResult GetActiveWorkItems([DataSourceRequest]DataSourceRequest request)
 {
     using (TaskManagerContext context = new TaskManagerContext())
     {
         IQueryable&lt;WorkItem&gt; list = context.WorkItems.Where(x =&gt; x.IsActive == true);
         DataSourceResult result = list.ToDataSourceResult(request);
         return Json(result);
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from my Action that I'm not even interested in the WorkItemNotes for the grid.</p>

<p>As proof that it is due to the relationship, I created this second Action which does work and display data:</p>

<pre><code>  public ActionResult GetActiveWorkItems2([DataSourceRequest]DataSourceRequest request)
  {
      using (TaskManagerContext context = new TaskManagerContext())
      {

          List&lt;Object&gt; dataObjects = new List&lt;object&gt;();
          foreach (WorkItem workItem in list)
          {
              dataObjects.Add(new { Title = workItem.Title, Description = workItem.Description });

<p>So here's my question: Is there a way to access any point in memory? I tried doing this with a char pointer so that It would only be a byte long. However the program crashed and spat out something in that nature of: ""can't access memory location"". Now I was pointing at the 0x00000000 location which where the system stores it's interrupt vectors (unless that changed), which shouldn't matter really.</p>

<p>Now my understanding is the kernel will allocate memory (data, stack, heap, etc) to a program and that program will not be able to go anywhere else. So I was thinking of using NASM to tell the CPU to go directly fetch what I need but I'm unsure if that would work (and I would need to figure out how to translate MASM to NASM).</p>

<p>How would I create a form for the <strong>Skilled Person</strong> entity? It would display simple fields such as <em>name</em> and <em>birth</em> (StringProperty and DateProperty). Additionally, it must display a 'group' of fields for the <em>Education</em> and <em>Experience</em> StructuredProperty properties. I would imagine the form to look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""post""&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Skilled Person Form&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;Name&lt;br&gt; 
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""name"" value=""{{name}}""&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;


    &lt;label&gt;Birth&lt;br&gt; 
        &lt;input type=""date"" name=""birth"" value=""{{birth}}""&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;


    &lt;!-- Education form goes here --&gt;

    &lt;!-- and Experience form goes here --&gt;

    &lt;input type=""submit""&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How do I include the groups of fields for Education and Experience in this form?</p>

<p>An example <em>Education</em> form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""post""&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add Education&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;Institution&lt;br&gt; 
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""institution"" value=""{{institution}}""&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;Certification&lt;br&gt; 
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""certification"" value=""{{certification}}""&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;Start&lt;br&gt; 
        &lt;input type=""date"" name=""start"" value=""{{start}}""&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;Finish&lt;br&gt; 
        &lt;input type=""date"" name=""finish"" value=""{{finish}}""&gt;

<p>(I'm new to C++ and Boost so I might have missed some basic concept while putting code from the internet together.)
I assume that I can just not iterate through a polygon that easily and I missed the non-trivial part, or that a polygon can not be used as a ring, or iterations are just not the way I thought they are, or I have no idea what else can be wrong. What did I do wrong?</p>

(Who knows how far off I may have been.)</p>

<p>My table headers are
pland, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune</p>

<p>The values for pland are the dates and the planetary columns have text containing numbers that look like ""6 sa 15"" and ""10 ge 15 Rx""</p>

<p>I need a query that will put it all into 3 columns: pland, plannme, plans where the value for 'plannme' is the column header and the 'plans' is value for the corresponding date and planet.</p>

<p>I've tried pivot/unpivot solutions that were previously given to other questions, but none of them seem to give me any results.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sure the answer is sitting right in front of me.</p>

<p>Sample data is:</p>

I want to add records to a join table (assign tasks to a user) and retrieve data from that table. For some reason, this does not work. Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>var orm = new Sequelize('db_name', '', '', {
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  storage: path.join(__dirname, 'db_name')
});

var User = orm.define('User', {
  username: {type: Sequelize.STRING, unique: true}
});

var Task = orm.define('Task', {
 id: {type: Sequelize.STRING, unique: true},
 taskName: Sequelize.STRING
});

Task.hasMany(User);
User.hasMany(Task);

Task.sync();
User.sync();
</code></pre>

<p>Having read documentation (<a href=""http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/associations/#hasmanytarget-options"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/associations/#hasmanytarget-options</a>), I expect that a join table TasksUsers should be created. I also expect .addTask method do be available. Then in another file I have:</p>

<pre><code>db.User.findOrCreate({where:{username: ""fakeUser""}}); //this seems to work
//some code to populate ""Tasks"" table;

db.User.find({where: {username: ""fakeUser""}}).
  complete(function(err,user){
    console.log(""user"", user); //the user is found
    db.Task.find({where: {id: ""some_value""}}).
      complete(function(err, task) {
        console.log(""task"", task); //the task is found, so it works up to this point
        user.addTask(task). //this line does not work
          complete(function(err, results){
            console.log(""posting error"", err);
          });    
      })
  });
</code></pre>

<p>I get an error ""Possibly unhandled SequelizeDatabaseError: Error: SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: TasksUsers"". The user.getTasks() method (without any arguments in the parentheses) does not work for the same reason.</p>

<p>Another observation: for testing purposes, I added these lines of code after establishing hasMany relationships: </p>

<pre><code>orm.query(""SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table'"").success(function (res) {
    console.log(""tables"", res);
  })
</code></pre>

<p>The result that I get is tables [ 'Tasks', 'Users' ]</p>

<p>The versions: sequelize 2.0.0-rc2, sqlite3 3.0.4. I would be very grateful for any help.</p>

<p>For example, I could have configuration file for both environments. The path of the libs is specified (libA, libA_dev). I could have 2 different setup scripts (or make on configurable) which indicate, where to install packages.

<p>To get that to work, I'm using the meta tag </p>

<p>This works great sa long the content-wrapping divs have a fixed width, or if the screen is less than 500px wide. But when I flip my phone (and thereby get >500px width), divs directly in the body with their width set to 100% get cut off. I'm assuming because width=device-width makes css 100% equal to the screen width, even if the website is larger than the screen.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>I would like the user control height to be equal to placeholder height with list box to grow and fill up any height difference as all other controls are of known size.
Some useful info:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Height can have the following values: 300, 400, 600 px, thus the need
for the listbox height to compensate for any height difference. </p></li>
<li><p>List box can contain 0 to 2000 elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Placeholder can be a div or an asp.net tab container.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For testing purposes, I did:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new user control, eg. SearchItem.ascx </p></li>
<li><p>Create a default aspx page for example:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a) Add the user control
//&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""uc"" TagName=""SearchItem"" Src=""~/Controls/SearchItem.ascx"" %></p>

<p>b) Add to body</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;form id=""form1"" runat=""server""&gt;
&lt;div id=""ChangeMyHeight"" style=""height: 300px; width: 30%; float: left;""&gt;
    &lt;uc:SearchItem ID=""AvailableItems"" runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;/uc:SearchItem&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you change the height of the container div to 500, 600.(ChangeMyHeight), you will have:</p>

<p>Current behaviour:</p>

<ul>
<li>Listbox is not resizing properly. (filling the height difference)</li>
</ul>

<p>Expected behaviour:</p>

<ul>
<li>Listbox is resizing properly and filling the height difference. (like docking in Winforms) </li>
</ul>

<p>My preference would be a css/jquery solution but code behind will do as well (I was thinking of using a height property to set up the child controls)</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>The sample markup  uses style for brevity's sake.</li>
<li>The sample markup has hard coded some values for demo purposes(thus
the demo is working for height 300 px but not for the other values),
feel free to change style/html as needed.</li>
<li>Environment:  VS2010/.NET 4.0/jQuery latest.</li>
<li>Browsers: FF, IE7/8/9</li>

<p>It is expensive to call and search for partial matches on my database considering the code portion has 1000s of possible items which have similar code and description.  What I would like to do is load the database based on the selection of type of codes and set that as the source for the autocomplete for each of the respective inputs in the table.</p>

<p>So if they declick group for example, the new url for the source would be <code>/item/code?comp=comp1&amp;type_chk=""pick,item,service</code> which should be cached browser side - I have seen people use the <code>var cache = {}</code> method but I don't think that is correct.  This cache should be used as the source data for the code autocomplete and then match the hdescrip component of the passed data to the hdescrip input text.  </p>

<p>I know how to set it up as an ajax call, but I don't want to constantly ping the database.</p>

<p>Also, this is on google app engine so I cannot create static files.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>During debug I've verified that the enable/start commands are executed but still the timer never ticks.</p>

Another example is in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/12687392/1333025"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I stumbled upon <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Exception-Base.html#v%3aevaluate""><code>evaluate :: a -&gt; IO a</code></a> that does a similar thing - it evaluates its argument to WHNF but only when the <code>IO</code> action is evaluated. This seems to be much safer, as one expects that ""in <code>IO</code> we can do everything"". Of course it cannot be used everywhere, but often the need to evaluate an expression is connected somehow with an <code>IO</code> operation (like to force a producing thread to evaluate a computation instead of a consuming thread when working with <code>MVar</code>s).</p>

<p>So I'd like to ask, how safe is <code>evaluate</code>? Is it possible to create examples (involve <code>IO</code> of course) where it breaks reasoning about code like <code>seq</code> does? Or can I consider it as a safe replacement of <code>seq</code> (if it's possible for a particular program)?</p>

We would like the timing to be robust so that the periods where the computer is hibernating, the timing is paused, giving us a more precise timing of active usage. We have been around various BCL and P/Invoke methods (Environment.TickCount, DateTime.UtcNow, Stopwatch, QueryPerformanceCounter (which I think Stopwatch uses internally if available) and timeGetTime (from winnm.dll, mmtimer.dll or core.dll)) but all of them continue their tick counting while hibernating the computer.</p>

<p>Are there any robust BCL or P/Invoke calls that will count <em>actual</em> execution time and pause while the operating system is hibernated?</p>

<p>I guess an alternative could be to use one of the above methods and maintain an internal periodic tick that could account for ""holes"" in the timing (which could indicate period of hibernation), but that seems somewhat cumbersome and error prone to implement and verify.</p>

<p>EDIT: On request, I'll add a little background. We are creating a small library to do timing of feature usage in applications. We would like to avoid taking dependencies on 3rd party solutions so we need to stick to something in the BCL (or P/Invoke, though we would like to avoid that). We have had some feedback that some of our timing was way off and discovered that we had been unaware of the fact that our timing code was not robust towards hibernation in the operating system. Therefor we are looking for a solution to provide <em>actual</em> execution time of the program. We are <em>not</em> looking for CPU usage or similar lower level counters, we would like a way to measure the actual execution time of the feature and we do not consider a hibernating operating system as execution time.</p>

From my understanding, when you initiate threads without joining them, they will compete with the main thread and all other threads for resources and then execute, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes not.</p>

<p>Does locking ensure that threads DON'T execute simultaneously?</p>

<p>Also, what wrong with threads executing simultaneous? Isn't that even better? (faster overall execution)</p>

<p>When you lock threads, will it lock them all or can you choose which ones you want to be locked? (Whatever locking actually does...)</p>

When bundle B is redeployed, bundle A still has reference to classloader from old version of B, so Class.forName returns old class version from B. This causes that calling Class.isInstance from A returns false when argument is instance created in B and passed to method in A.
Is there some way to refresh classloader in A to be able return new version of classes from B? It is possible to call bundle refresh A command from Virgo console, this solves this problem, but this refresh causes that all dependent bundles (B and others) are stopped and started again.

<p>When outputting an edit control for a special type of entity, for example, let’s say a color or something:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.EditorFor(product =&gt; product.Color)
</code></pre>

<p>I want this to output a drop-down list, so I tried to create a custom editor template that shall render such a drop-down. Here is what my template looks like so far:</p>

<pre><code>@model MyProject.Models.Color
@using (var db = new MyProject.Models.DbContext())
{
    @Html.DropDownList(???,
        new SelectList(db.Colors, ""Id"", ""Name"", Model))
}
</code></pre>

<p>What do I have to put instead of the <code>???</code> — the parameter that specifies the HTML <code>name</code> attribute for the drop-down?</p>

<hr>

<p>(For obvious reasons, it’s not just <code>""Color""</code>. Consider several invocations of the same edit template for <em>different</em> fields of the <em>same</em> type, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.EditorFor(product =&gt; product.InnerColor)
@Html.EditorFor(product =&gt; product.OuterColor)
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, this needs to generate drop-downs with different names.)</p>

<p>At present I'm manually creating the bundles with a version number (e.g. <em>mybundle-1.0.0.css</em>) in order to avoid caching issues when pushed out to production. I'm also having to manually change the bundle files version number each time a change is made to the source.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any sort of automatic versioning functionality in Web Essentials bundling that I may have overlooked?</strong></p>

<p>The ideal workflow would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developer updates a source file.</li>
<li>Web essentials updates the bundle automatically.</li>
<li>Web essentials increments the version number in the filename automatically.</li>

<p>So is there a way of fixing this without manually messing with the include directory?</p>

<p>And if there isn't how do I get an up to date header fitting my OpenGL version?</p>

<p>The steps to do so are as follows:</p>

<li>Set the particular script engine as the default ""open with"" program for the script file type extension using Windows Explorer</li>

The only other thing that I'd like to validate is that I can send/receive e-mails using my username/password with the SMTP server I received from IT</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I confirmed thru telnet that the SMTP server is working properly by following steps 1-5 in <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/153119"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>.  </p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas as to why I'm getting this problem, or how to troubleshoot it further? </p>

<p>However, this works when the source property is null, if target has it, it will copy that to source.
IT can still be improved to merge when inconsistencies are there e.g. if FirstName=""Tiju"" and FirstName=""John""</p>

<p>Any commments appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm new to PDO statements in general, and am using it for a site I'm working on, which is going to contain an image uploader. Right now, I have this function:</p>

<p>Now, <code>$location</code> comes into this function correct - it is an image location, such as <code>C:\image.png</code> or <code>http://test.com/image.jpg</code>. It is correct at that point. However, upon insertion, the image extensions are being scrubbed, entering only <code>""C:\image""</code> or <code>""http://test.com/image""</code> into the database, which of course is an issue later when I need to use that information to fetch and or modify the image. I assume it's something to do with a sql injection prevention within PDO? I really don't know. Please help!</p>

<p>Currently I am doing a postback on a buttonclick which does some server-side calculations. The server-side code then uses those calculations to alter the contents of a div. In IE and Firefox when a postback happens, the div updates as expected.</p>

<p>However, in chrome all postbacks do a complete refresh of the entire page. What is causing this and is there a way around this behavior?</p>

ClientSide I have the following..</p>

<p>It is possible that when this postback(if I understand this correctly) happens, that it is still fully reloading in firefox and ie, but it doesn't show it. This effectively masks the postback. However, when I test in chrome, any postback completely blanks the page before reloading the state. Hopefully this clears up exactly what I am asking. Also, my C#/.Net usage might be slightly flawed and I am willing to take comments on such.</p>

<p>I am going to implement the listvieww using viewholder pattern to display the web content. When it comes to the implementation, some device turns black as follows. Is there any way I have to take cautions or amendments to prevent such issues ? </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/hXQTB.jpg"" alt=""ScreenShot""></p>

<p>The below is my code</p>

<pre><code>@Override
    public View getView(int position, View v, ViewGroup parent) {
        // Keeps reference to avoid future findViewById()
        ContactsViewHolder viewHolder;

        if (v == null) {
            LayoutInflater li = (LayoutInflater) getContext().getSystemService(
                    Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
            v = li.inflate(R.layout.readpost_reply, parent, false);
            viewHolder = new ContactsViewHolder();
            viewHolder.txName = (TextView) v.findViewById(R.id.userName);

            //
            WebSettings settings = viewHolder.txContent.getSettings();
            settings.setDefaultTextEncodingName(""utf-8"");

            settings.setLayoutAlgorithm(LayoutAlgorithm.SINGLE_COLUMN);
            viewHolder.txContent.setFocusable(false);
            viewHolder.txContent.setClickable(true);
            viewHolder.txContent.setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(""#00FFFFFF""));


            viewHolder.txTime = (TextView) v.findViewById(R.id.replytime); 
            viewHolder.ivQuote = (ImageView) v.findViewById(R.id.action_quote);
            v.setTag(viewHolder);
        } else {
            viewHolder = (ContactsViewHolder) v.getTag();
        }

        final Content content = (Content) contacts.get(position);
        if (content != null) {
            viewHolder.txName.setText(content.getUsername());
            //  viewHolder.txEmails.setText(content.getContent());
            TextProcessor processor = BBProcessorFactory.getInstance().create();
            String htmlParsed = processor.process(content.getContent());
            for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; hkgiconsCodes.length ; i++){
                htmlParsed = bbC.replace(htmlParsed, hkgiconsCodes[i], hkgiconsHTML[i]);
            }

            for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; otherCodes.length ; i++){
                htmlParsed = bbC.replace(htmlParsed, otherCodes[i], otherHTML[i]);
            }
            htmlParsed =   bbC.replaceColor(htmlParsed, true);
            htmlParsed =   bbC.replaceColor(htmlParsed, false);


  System.out.println(htmlPreffix + htmlParsed + htmlSuffixString);
            viewHolder.txContent.loadDataWithBaseURL(null, htmlPreffix + htmlParsed + htmlSuffixString, ""text/html"", ""utf-8"", null);
            viewHolder.txTime.setText(content.getTime());

            viewHolder.txName.setTextColor(Color.BLACK);
            //viewHolder.txEmails.setTextColor(Color.BLACK);
            //          viewHolder.txTime.setTextColor(Color.BLACK);

            if(content.getSex().equals(""male"")){
                viewHolder.txName.setTextColor(Color.BLUE);
            }else{
                viewHolder.txName.setTextColor(Color.RED);
            }

    static class ContactsViewHolder {
        TextView txName;
        WebView txContent;
        TextView txTime;
        ImageView ivQuote;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Even I have commented</p>

<pre><code>viewHolder.txContent.setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(""#00FFFFFF""));
</code></pre>

<p>and set the color same as the transparent , the black screen still occurs at Sony devices</p>

Some of this information is validated to ensure that some fields are required while others are not. When an invalid entry is input, we see the following validation messages:</p>

<p><a href=""http://gyazo.com/693fefaa64693ebbddbe1484f9b20cb8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gyazo.com/693fefaa64693ebbddbe1484f9b20cb8</a></p>

<p>This is fine when working in an English locale, however the website also runs in Swedish and the form is displayed as followed:</p>

<p>So far so good, but when we submit the form with empty fields, the validation is bypassed and the entry is sent off with the following message:</p>

<p>I believe along the lines of ""Data updated."" For the life of me I can't pin down the cause of this issue. Please see below for the validation of the form in the scripting of the page:</p>

        onkeyup:function()
        {
           //do nothing on keyup
        },
        submitHandler: function (form) {
        return true;
        },
        rules: {

<p>Once the worker has started, if I look in the WADLogsTable, all I see is ""WorkerRole.OnStart()"" and nothing else!</p>

<p>Any ideas on what the problem could be or how to troubleshoot this would be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> If I stop the role, I don't see any of the debug statements from the <code>OnStop()</code> method either.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I <em>must</em> have something configured incorrectly with my diagnostics. I thought I was seeing my debug come out correctly when debugging locally, but it turns out I'm not. I see everything in the output window, but I don't see everything in the storage table. I am seeing the following entries in development:</p>

<pre><code>WorkerRole.OnStart()
WorkerRole.Initialize()
Configuring AutoMapper...
</code></pre>

<p>I realize that the trace output is only periodically uploaded, but I've waited 5 minutes or so, so I think this should be long enough, since I have it set to 1 minute.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As suggested by @kwill in the comments section I have tried adding a file trace listener as follows:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;system.diagnostics&gt;
    &lt;trace autoflush=""true""&gt;
      &lt;listeners&gt;
        &lt;add type=""Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Diagnostics.DiagnosticMonitorTraceListener, Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Diagnostics, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35""
             name=""AzureDiagnostics""&gt;
        &lt;/add&gt;
        &lt;add name=""File"" type=""System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener"" initializeData=""C:\TextWriterOutput.log"" /&gt;
      &lt;/listeners&gt;
    &lt;/trace&gt;
  &lt;/system.diagnostics&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine in my development environment and seems more reliable as well as I get all of the debug out that I would expect. When I deploy it to staging however, the TextWriterOutput.log file isn't even created!</p>

<p>I really need a reliable way of getting debug out of my worker role so that I can troubleshoot the ultimate problem, which is that my jobs aren't working - at this point I still have no idea what they are even trying to do as I can't get any debug out!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I am pretty sure that the missing dll idea suggested by most people is not the problem. To hopefully prove this, I have overridden the run method as shown below and I am seeing the ""Heartbeat..."" debug come out. It seems to me that either the diagnostics functionality or at least the way I have it configured is unreliable, which is preventing me from investigating why on earth my jobs aren't running.</p>

<pre><code>    public override void Run()
    {
        Trace.WriteLine(""LearningMiles.JobProcessor.WorkerRole.Run()"", ""Information"");

        try
        {
            while (true)
            {
                Thread.Sleep(10000);
                Trace.WriteLine(""Heartbeat..."", ""Verbose"");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            TraceUtil.TraceException(ex);
            throw;
        }
        finally
        {
            Trace.WriteLine(""LearningMiles.JobProcessor.WorkerRole.Run() - Complete"", ""Information"");
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have now cross posted this problem on the <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazuretroubleshooting/thread/cb9ec387-8ba3-46e1-aa51-499e041916c4"" rel=""nofollow"">Windows Azure MSDN forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As suggested in the comments, I have now tried removing all 'useful' code. In development this resulted in all of the debug being output. I then tried <em>just</em> removing the call to <code>AutomapperConfiguration.Configure()</code> since previously I was seeing nothing come out after that call. This resulted in some of the trace statements not coming out again. Importantly however, I was seeing the trace statements that I have put in the ""jobs"". Since it's the jobs not running that I ultimately want to resolve, I deployed that version of the code to staging, but there I just see the OnStart() trace and the ""heartbeat"" trace. I don't think this really helps, but maybe it will give someone some ideas.</p>

[MyAttribute(Attributes = ""&lt;items&gt;&lt;item key='visibility' value='Condition1'/&gt;&lt;item key='myAttribute' value='some-value'/&gt;&lt;/items&gt;"")]

<p>In one of the Views there is a DataGrid, and one of the columns of this grid is a DataGridTemplateColumn, which has just a Button. </p>

<p>I'd like to define both a Command and a CommandParameter on the Button. The Command should be a DelegateCommand of the ViewModel. CommandParameter should be the SelectedItems list coming straight out of the dataGrid.</p>

<p>I've tried several approaches to do this, but either Command or CommandParameter are null. </p>

<p>It follows the code that I originally wrote:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sdk:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;
    &lt;sdk:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;Button Width=""15"" Height=""15"" Content=""&gt;"" 
                    Command=""{Binding UpdateSearchParametersCommand}"" 
                    CommandParameter=""{Binding SelectedItems, ElementName=dataGrid}""&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/sdk:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
&lt;/sdk:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Could someone advice me on what the best way to go about it is? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Gianluca.</p>

<p>To do this, my script calculates the x and y dimensions in spatial units (for example, 11mm x 4.2 mm or 11mm x 4.5 mm) and then forces the aspect ratio in <code>plt.imshow</code> using the <code>aspect</code> setting to the ratio of the y axis size to the x axis size.</p>

<p>This does not work for some reason.  Also, setting the figure size doesn't work.  Here's my code and images:

<p>It seems to me that this should work, and I have verified that this script correctly calculates the spatial dimensions of every image, along with the aspect ratio that each should have.  I should point out that the third image is 110 pixels across in the x direction, while the other two are only 55.</p>

<p>Also, if anybody has advice on how to place ticks more robustly, that would be wonderful to hear.</p>

<p>A way to select data from the database could be like this:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = ""SELECT *, DATE_FORMAT(date, '%b %e, %Y') AS show_date FROM persons ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 100"";
</code></pre>

<p>But, what if i want to give the users the opportunity to sort by date, hits, rating (another table) both descending and ascending and also the opportunity to only select persons below age X with the gender of male (for example). How do i do this? Do i need to make <code>if else</code> for all possible querys or is it possible in one single query?</p>

<p>I dont need a finish code snippet, i just need to know if there are any good articles or a ""Best Practice""-way to do this. The easiest and most secure method is prefered.</p>

<p>P.S. what do you call this kind of 'problem'?</p>

<p>However, when I then ran the app that uses the DLL, it errored out with:</p>

<pre><code>""An expected error has occurred...bla bla bla...or select Details for more information.

<p>I did select Details, and saw:</p>

Version=&lt;bla&gt;
Culture=neutral
PublicKeyToken=null, or one of its dependencies, was not found.
</code></pre>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>Based on the comments, I guess there's more to replacing a DLL than one might expect. I don't know if this is significant or not, I thought replacing a DLL would be like replacing an EXE, but maybe not: the DLL project's AssemblyInfo.cs says, </p>

<pre><code>[assembly: AssemblyVersion(""1.3.*"")]                // used by .NET framework only
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(""1.3.0.308"")]        // File Version - increment here
[assembly: AssemblyInformationalVersion(""6.3.0"")]   // Product version - set to current IEQ system

<p>...and the Version in the err msg is ""1.3.3889.27539""</p>

<p>Do I need to update one of these lines (I would guess the middle one, if so) to that value (1.3.3889.27539)? Or...???</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>So since the .DLL is not strongly named, I tried simply removing the reference (to the old .DLL) in the project that uses the DLL and then adding it back again (same file name, different version). I see, though, that updating the .DLL does not change the version numbers shown above - IOW, the AssemblyInfo.cs does not get updated when building. Should it? Do I need to manually update these vals?</p>

<p>Basically - any pointers to writing a crawler in Django or an existing python crawler that I could adapt? Or should I incorporate 'turning into Django-friendly stuff' in step two and write some glue code? Or, finally, should I abandon Django altogether? I really need something that can search quickly from the front end, though.</p>

<p>Django already has a calling style for referencing model fields with query constraints -- multiple terms are composed into predicates with double-underscores and passed as keyword args. Queryset filtering, using <code>QuerySet.filter()</code> and <code>Q()</code>, make use of this syntax e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>stuff = MyStuff.objects.filter(name__isnull=False)
thing = MyStuff.objects.filter(Q(name__icontains=""yo"") &amp; Q(ptype__iendswith=""dogg"")).get()
</code></pre>

<p>The same syntax is used by <code>F()</code> expressions, which are used to build dynamic predicates in query statements. The majority Django users have seen (if not used) this syntax in some form.</p>

<p>I would like to create a similar dynamically-evaluated, composeable Python idiom -- for this question's sake I'll call it <code>G()</code> -- that uses the same syntax, to furnish a similar handle for a lazily-evaluated field lookup instance that can be logically recombined with other such instances.</p>

<p>How ought one approach this task? Both <code>Q()</code> and <code>F()</code> are subclasses of <code>django.utils.tree.Node</code> -- at least they are in Django 1.4 (they weren't always implemented as they are now, and their interface may or may not be private). Much of the kwarg-filter-expression action takes place in <code>django.db.models.sql.Query</code>, I believe... which that is an enormous and daunting class with illegible couplings to myriad bits of the ORM's guts.</p>

<p>I'm reasonably sure the query-filter syntax can be accomplished much more simply than I'm imagining. Where should I begin?</p>

<p>I've never made a store locator before but I assumed Google would have had it set up so that you could list addresses and Google spits out the snippet for you to paste on your site. Too naive, I know.</p>

<p>Well I've got the map working but I can't figure out how to add locations, display them, or allow users to input a zip and find nearby locations. Right now we only have three locations so I was hoping to find a solution that forgoes the database part and lets me specify these lat/longs directly in the Google js. I don't mind it loading all three locations on pageload.</p>

<p>So if you know of a way to specify the locations directly in the Google v3 snippet, please do tell. If you know how to display the sidebar with those store details and a place to input a zip, please share that too and I'd be most appreciative. </p>

<p>For example, I have the following documents:</p>

<pre><code>{_id:1,make:""chevrolet""}
{_id:2,make:""chevrolet""} 
{_id:3,make:""Chevrolet""} 
{_id:4,make:""chevy""}
{_id:5,make:""chevy""}
</code></pre>

<p>How would I query the collection so that it returns (capitalization not important):</p>

<pre><code>{_id:1,make:""chevrolet""}
{_id:4,make:""chevy""}

<p>I get the result of: </p>

<pre><code>Thu Oct 25 18:40:50 +0000 2012
</code></pre>

<p>If I try to get the text with:</p>

<pre><code>echo $result-&gt;text;
</code></pre>

<p>I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$text in /Library/WebServer/Documents/include/twitter_noformat/items.php on line 35 
</code></pre>

<p>A partial var_dump of my data format includes this:</p>

<pre><code>{""created_at"":""Thu Aug 01 16:12:18 +0000 2013"",

</code></pre>

<p>My question is:
created_at gives me a value. id gives me a value. Why doesn't text?  I know nothing about JSON btw. I'm not a very advanced programmer, but the pattern looks the same to me. </p>

<p>Edit: Well I found a cool snippet that converted my twitter array to something more readable.  The function goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>// It's json, so decode it into an array
$result = json_decode($json);

// Access the profile_image_url element in the array
$pretty = function($v='',$c=""&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"",$in=-1,$k=null)use(&amp;$pretty){$r='';if(in_array(gettype($v),array('object','array'))){$r.=($in!=-1?str_repeat($c,$in):'').(is_null($k)?'':""$k: "").'&lt;br&gt;';foreach($v as $sk=&gt;$vl){$r.=$pretty($vl,$c,$in+1,$sk).'&lt;br&gt;';}}else{$r.=($in!=-1?str_repeat($c,$in):'').(is_null($k)?'':""$k: "").(is_null($v)?'&amp;lt;NULL&amp;gt;':""&lt;strong&gt;$v&lt;/strong&gt;"");}return$r;};

echo $pretty($result);
</code></pre>

<p>The results now look like this:</p>

<pre><code>statuses_count: 583
lang: en
status:
    created_at: Thu Aug 01 21:10:10 +0000 2013
    id: 363044004444651522
    id_str: 363044004444651522
    text: @CalStateEastBay AD Sara Lillevand Judd '86 honored for her work as an athletic adminstrator. http://t.co/WzOqjIDrBw
</code></pre>

<p>This is strange because that makes text look like it's part of an object?  </p>

<p>I have determined that twitter kicks back an array of objects. Those objects can have a lot of items(?) As I mentioned previously though I can echo $result->created_at; but not text. They are both at the same level of the array.</p>

<p>thanks in advance for your help,

I bring it up to not only figure out why, but to let folks know of this possibly unexpected result.</p>

<p>Consider this statement where the intent is to tack ""note 2"" on the end of string ""Note 1"".  My intention was to group the entire line, then concatenate the new string to the end:</p>

<pre><code>select regexp_replace('note 1', '(.*)', '\1' || ' note 2') try_1 from dual;

note 1 note 2 note 2

<p>The note gets repeated twice!  Why?</p>

<p>If I change the pattern to include the start of line and end of line anchors, it works as expected:</p>

<p>Why should that make a difference?</p>

<p>EDIT: please see Politank-Z's explanation below.  I wanted to add if I change the first example to use a plus (match 1 or more occurrences of the previous character) as opposed to the asterisk (for 0 or more occurrences of the previous character) it works as expected:</p>

<p>Since I'm not used to work with SSL certificates it's not clear to me what can be the advantage of setting the SSL on NGINX and make NGINX itself to proxy-pass to a http:// connection or have the real node.js endpoint to be a SSL server and (then proxy-pass to https://).</p>

<p>I guess with the NGINX solution, I could re-use the same SSL cert adding it to our ""api"" domain, while each different SSL node server would need a different cert.
Then it's not clear to me if into a production environment like this I should be using self-signed certificates (since the endpoint is touched through other services) or if it should be a CA trusted certificate exactly like it should be a public domain.</p>

<p>The problem is that first i need to develop the menu in such a way that the section that opens on hover should open and take the entire width of the menu. Thus when i hover on any of the links, a common area should be there that opens up for displaying the menu content.</p>

<p>secondly the lvl2 class is overlapping on hover the already open content. thus ruining the look.</p>

<p>Also please suggest if i need to use jquery to solve this..currently i was looking for a solution without jquery.</p>

The problem is that my first thread just doesn't stop running. My second thread will not even create before my first thread finish the whole process. How do I solve this problem?
Here is a simple code to demonstrate my problem</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

pthread_t *ptr;
int num;

{

    ptr = malloc(sizeof(pthread_t)*num);

    for(i = 0; i &lt; num; i++)
        pthread_create(&amp;ptr[i], NULL, func(i), NULL);

    //free allocated space

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that <code>0</code> is always printed, I never see <code>1</code>.
My guess is that ptr[1] never get the chance to initialize itself, so the thread doesn't exists. So it will not get it's cpu share.
Isn't the program itself has 1 main thread. After some process time, cpu should switch back to the main thread then pthread_create the second thread.It never happens. I'm just wondering why.</p>

<p>I'm a newbie in C, and this is my first time doing pthread. So please give advice that suits my level. Thank you.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the great advices, I have changed my code to:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int num;
pthread_t *ptr;

void* func(void* id)
{
  int *c;
  c = (int*)id;
  while(1)
    if(c)
      printf(""%d\n"", *c);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int i;

  num = atoi(argv[1]);

  ptr = malloc(sizeof(pthread_t)*num);
  for(i = 0; i &lt; num; i++)
    pthread_create(&amp;ptr[i], NULL, func, (void*)&amp;i);

  for(i = 0; i &lt; num; i++)
    pthread_join(ptr[i], NULL);

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I still only see <code>0</code>. I created the thread now right?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] because <strong>incrementing the smart pointer reference count</strong>
  can usually be optimized to be the same as an ordinary increment 
  in an optimized <code>shared_ptr</code> implementation — just an ordinary increment instruction,
  and no fences, in the generated code.</p>
  
  <p>However, <strong>the decrement must be an atomic decrement</strong> or equivalent,
  which generates special processor memory instructions that are more expensive in
  themselves, and that on top of that induce memory 
  fence restrictions on optimizing the surrounding code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The text is about the implementation of <code>shared_ptr</code> and I am not sure if his remark applies only on this or is generally the case. From his formulation I gather it is <em>generally</em>.</p>

<p>But when I think about it I can only think of ""more expensive decrement"" when a <code>if(counter==0)</code> immediately follows -- which probably is the case with <code>shared_ptr</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore I wonder if the <em>atomic</em> operation <code>++counter</code> is (usually) <strong>always faster</strong> than <code>--counter</code>, <strong>or just because</strong> it is used <code>if(--counter==0)...</code> with <code>shared_ptr</code>?</p>

Sorry that I cannot provide a SSCCE. I tried to recreate this problem on a small project, but without success, or should I say with success, because its working there!</p>

<p>So here is my Problem:
I have an editable JCombobox, which should listen to a focus event by clicking in the editor component. But it doesn´t.</p>

<p>Here is a code snippet where I attach the listener:</p>

<pre><code>cmbZoom.setToolTipText(locale.getString(""GUI_ZoomFactor""));
cmbZoom.setFont(new Font(Font.SANS_SERIF, Font.PLAIN, 16));
cmbZoom.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(88, 29));
cmbZoom.setEditable(true);
((JTextField)cmbZoom.getEditor().getEditorComponent()).setHorizontalAlignment(JTextField.CENTER);
cmbZoom.getEditor().getEditorComponent().addFocusListener(
  new FocusListener(){
    public void focusGained(FocusEvent arg0) {
      System.out.println(""GAINED"");
    }

    public void focusLost(FocusEvent arg0) {
      System.out.println(""LOST"");
    }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>I have already tried to remove all other listener on the combobox, remove the observer pattern, make the combobox protected and attach the listener on each child,...</p>

<p>I have also tried to reimplement it like written on this post:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10293135/jcombobox-focuslost-is-not-firing-why-is-that"">JCombobox focusLost is not firing-why is that?</a></p>

I was hoping to display their inputs on one final review panel that would then allow them to decide to edit the info and move back to a earlier panel to edit. </p>

<p>Following is the test script. The farthest I've gotten is getting it to return 'textBox' and not the value of the textBox. Is it possible to get the values while staying in the doGet portion of my script, or must I move to doPost to access the values? </p>

<p>What would be the work around you would suggest?
Thanks for any and all help!</p>

Currently in Windows 7 both install and from debugger the code below works.  However, when the program is installed in Windows XP, the final line is never reached.</p>

<p>This code is called from a MenuStrip, and then passed to a subsequent method to perform the actions based on the item clicked in the menu.  However, this is not the only place where SaveFileDialog is failing and it always fails on the ShowDialog() method.</p>

<p>Code for the MenuItem:</p>

<pre><code>            private void saveOnlyPlaylistToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
            {
                try
                {
                    MainMenuClick(sender, e);
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    StackTrace st = new StackTrace();
                    string methodName = st.GetFrame(1).GetMethod().Name;
                    Logger.LogToFile(""Failure in "" + methodName + "": "" + ex.Message);
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Code that is failing:</p>

<pre><code>            Logger.LogToFile(""Entered Save Only Playlist."");
            SaveFileDialog sfd = new SaveFileDialog();
            string playlistSaveLocation = config[""PlaylistLocation""];
            if (!Directory.Exists(playlistSaveLocation))
                Directory.CreateDirectory(playlistSaveLocation);
            sfd.InitialDirectory = playlistSaveLocation;
            sfd.Filter = ""L Playlist (*.lpl)|*.lpl"";

            DialogResult result = sfd.ShowDialog();
            Logger.LogToFile(""Result of Dialog: "" + result.ToString());
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out why the last line is not being called, it feels like the ShowDialog() method of the SaveFileDialog is no completing.  Afterwards the program continues to run fine, but will no longer interact with the file directory and cannot make new processes.</p>

<p>There is no error left in the debugger, nor the event log.  I've rebuilt it on a windows XP using Visual Studio 2010 and it worked fine, the error only seems to appear when the program is created in Windows 7 and then installed on Windows XP.  Windows 7 is 64 bit.</p>

<p>I should note that I have all exceptions being thrown from Debug -> Exceptions.</p>

<p>I've searched around and there doesn't seem to be many cases of a base method like SaveFileDialog failing, any ideas on what could be causing this issue?</p>

<hr>

<p>Further analysis based on the answer below has lead to me to believe that perhaps this has something to do with how the SaveFileDialog is being called.  Since this is being called from a MenuStrip, I believe it is coming out as a separate thread.  This may be the reason why the ShowDialog() method is never returning, but I can't pinpoint why that would be.  In an effort to find the problem, I created a separate window form that did nothing but had a button to open a save file dialog.  This button works, and correctly returns, but upon returning control back to the original thread it seems to fail again.  This is all based on the logging I am placing for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>Logging code:</p>

<pre><code>            public static void LogToFile(string message, FileInfo fInfo)
            {
                try
                {
                    if (!fInfo.Exists)
                        using (FileStream fs = fInfo.Create()) ;

                    message = DateTime.Now.ToString(""yyyy-MM-dd hh-mm-ss"") + "": "" + message;

                    File.AppendAllText(fInfo.FullName, message + ""\n"");
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    StackTrace st = new StackTrace();
                    string methodName = st.GetFrame(1).GetMethod().Name;
                    MessageBox.Show(""Failure in "" + methodName + "": "" + ex.Message);
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Code for additional Window:</p>

<pre><code>            public partial class Buffer : Form
            {
                public Buffer()

                    try
                    {
                        result = sfd.ShowDialog();
                    }
                    catch (Exception ex)
                    {
                        MessageBox.Show(""Dialog problem: "" + ex.Message);
                    }
                    Logger.LogToFile(""Result of Dialog: "" + result.ToString());
                    MessageBox.Show(""Result of Dialog: "" + result.ToString());
                    DialogResult = result;
                }
            }

<p>The code above works, and the MessageBox.Show() actually shows the dialog result.</p>

<p>Now I am build an app which would allow the user to read or write the data if their email is in a specific list of emails.</p>

<p>Like (abc@exmample.com,xyz@exmample.com,iou@exmample.com), then abc@example.com would have the access to read and write.</p>

<p>So the whole process will be </p>

<p>1.(user go to my app) </p>

<p>2.(click authenticate via google)</p>

<p>3.(firebase get the data and validate user's email)</p>

<p>4.If user's email is in the special list, got permission. If not, no permission.</p>

<p>My data and user object look like:</p>

<pre><code>+ myapp
   + projects
     + project1
       + name: ""name1""
       + type: ""regular""
     + project2
       + name: ""name2""
       + type: ""emergent""
     + ...
   +user
     + user1 (should have access to data)
       + email: ""abc@email.com""
       + admin: true
     + user2  (no access)
       + email: ""ooo@email.com""
       + admin: false
</code></pre>

<p>What I have done is using fire base's Google authentication to require users to authenticate first. This works well. </p>

<p>But the problem is, anyone has a google account will be able to read and write my data.(Because I don't have a good rule for this).</p>

<p>What I want to do is, after the user authenticated my app, can I know their email address as well as uid and provider. (<a href=""https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/api/rule/auth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Document here</a>) </p>

<p>I have read ""Custom 'auth' payload"" and try their code already. 
When I log out the token, it returns  a super long string.
So I assumed that was create successfully.</p>

<p>According to the document, after the token is generate successfully, the customize properties would be able to use in the auth object in Security and rules tab in firebase. However, I still could not use them like auth.isModerator.</p>

<p>Here are the questions I have read on stack Overflow. </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21350736/firebase-security-rules"">Firebase Security Rules</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25641184/firebase-set-security-rules-depending-on-user-roles"">Firebase: set security rules depending on user roles</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26913202/firebase-user-write-read-rules-based-on-data-objects"">Firebase user write/read rules based on data objects</a></p>

<p>and some more similar.</p>

<p>So After all, my questions will be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it normal to grant permission to user when first time they authenticated my app ? 
(Because it's an internal app for a group of people, so I didn't implement the register function).</p></li>
<li><p>How can I give permission to those users whose email is the special list. </p></li>
<li>How to modify the 'auth' object in Security and rules tab.</li>

<p>The most straightforward way I thought of was to simply copy and replace the persistentStore.  Like so..</p>

<p>This is how I replace the persistentStore:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)restoreBackupWithBackupURL:(NSURL *)backupURL {
// close the current document
[self.database closeWithCompletionHandler:^(BOOL success) {        
    // GET PERSISTENT STORE URL

    databaseURL = [databaseURL URLByAppendingPathComponent:@""StoreContent""];
    databaseURL = [databaseURL URLByAppendingPathComponent:@""persistentStore""];

    // DELETE PERSISTENT STORE

    if (!deleted) {
        NSLog(@""Error deleting file: %@"", error.localizedDescription);
        return;
    }

    // COPY BACKUP PERSISTENT STORE
    BOOL copied = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] copyItemAtURL:backupURL toURL:databaseURL error:&amp;error];
    if (!copied) {
        NSLog(@""Error copying file: %@"", error.localizedDescription);
        return;
    }

    // INITIALIZE
    NSURL *url = [[[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory inDomains:NSUserDomainMask] lastObject];
    url = [url URLByAppendingPathComponent:@""Default Database""];

    self.database = [[UIManagedDocument alloc] initWithFileURL:url]; 
}];

To support different screen size, I followed the second answer in this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8428096/design-layout-for-multiple-screens"">thread</a>, which is creating those folders in the file system. </p>

<p>However I didn't create these folders through eclipse and actually I don't know whether we can do that. I created them directly in file system. And then, I renamed xml files and add one new xml file in the original layout folder. Next I copied the xml files in the original layout folder to each of the new directories. Question is: Is it right steps to create different screen size layouts? </p>

<p>After this, I go to activities (the .java files) to change the layout names, since I renamed the xml files. However I cannot find the renamed files but the original ones. So I followed this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6759891/android-i-got-error-when-open-xml-file-in-eclipse"">thread</a> since I also get the same problem. After doing project->clean, I have error symbol (the red cross) on each of my activities, and turned out in the imports, <code>import com.mylocalname.R;</code> cannot be resolved since <code>R.java</code> is not generated. I didn't import <code>android.R</code>. </p>

<p>According to what I found, R.java is not generated maybe because xml file has some errors. However I cannot see any red cross on those files. So how to fix this problem?</p>

<p>So the project is in a mess now. Does anyone have an idea on how to solve the problem? Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I'm using android platform 4.1 and API level 16. </p>

<p>I want the page to display the list of classes along with the list of students for each one as the standard view, while the <strong>teacher-marks</strong> should be initially hidden, but made visible on demand, when they should be editable in place (new and remove operations).</p>

<p>The way I've implemented this display-wise is this:</p>

<p>Each <strong>class</strong> is displayed as an Ember view, as I need a lot of interaction with the controller. The <strong>teacher-marks</strong> are implemented as Ember components, as well as the <strong>students</strong>. Neither the view, nor the components perform any communication with the server, they basically just send actions to the controller / route.</p>

<p>Displaying and hiding the <strong>teacher-marks</strong> are done via properties in the components.</p>

<p>I only have one route for all this (and as far as Ember.js tutorials and examples go, I feel I may be doing it wrong) and one controller. The route is named 'classes' and has an ArrayController displaying the array of <strong>classes</strong>. I have item controllers for each <strong>class</strong>.</p>

<p>The route object is the one that fetches data from the server. The manipulated child elements (e.g. new/removed <strong>teacher-marks</strong>) are pushed to the server via dedicated model functions (using Ajax calls) called from the main route events. I am not using Ember data.</p>

<p>As far as I read, I should be having nested resources for this implementation, but am otherwise at a loss as to how to implement it that way and keep displaying the <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>students</strong> at all times.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate all amendments and suggestions to the way I currently implemented this. It would also help me a great deal if you could add why will something work better one way or the other.</p>

<p>I haven't included any code as I feel it would be better expressed this way as a problem. My code is obviously more complicated than above, and not involving the class - students case. If needed, I can sketch-up a model.</p>

The line that's showing me an error is <code>$array['data']-&gt;attach( new Cake($name,$ingredients,$prepare,$image));</code> but i don't know what I'm doing wrong.
I haven't yet written the line that includes and transforms the array into json</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>//opens the file, if it doesn't exist, it creates
$pointer = fopen($file, ""w"");

// writes into json


$cake_list['data'] = new SplObjectStorage();
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $row; $i++) {

    // Takes the SQL data
    $name = mysql_result($sql, $i, ""B.nome"");
    $ingredients = mysql_result($sql, $i, ""B.ingredientes"");

<hr>

<p>Hello Guys, I just builded a Broadcast Receiver with which I can get the incoming text messages, than I split the text message when there's a space and save it into a String[]</p>

<p>Now I need to check if in this String[] is something from my database. For that I created a ArrayList, which gets all the entries from the corresponding column. Now I need to check if a String in my ArrayList is the same in my String[] from the text message, but I don't know how to realize that.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>So on I like to know if there is a easy and fast way to check that, also I need to know which String is in both of them? It would be great if you have an example or a tutorial for me, that I can learn it on my own =)
Down here you find the Code.</p>

<p>We have been tasked with layering in ""friendly urls"" and decided to use the new Asp.net routing.  We have a rule in IIS to map <em>all requests</em> to the aspnet_isapi.dll, which yields this declaration in our web.config (system.webServer/hanlers):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;add name=""asp.net routing"" path=""*"" verb=""*"" modules=""IsapiModule"" scriptProcessor=""C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll"" resourceType=""Unspecified"" preCondition=""classicMode,runtimeVersionv2.0,bitness32"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But now routing breaks our .asmx webservice requests (of the form <a href=""http://example.com/blah.asmx/SomeMethod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/blah.asmx/SomeMethod</a>).  Any request to a web service leaves us with the always fun:</p>

<pre><code>Failed to Execute URL.
[HttpException (0x80004005): Failed to Execute URL.]
System.Web.Hosting.ISAPIWorkerRequestInProcForIIS6.BeginExecuteUrl(String url, String method, String childHeaders, Boolean sendHeaders, Boolean addUserIndo, IntPtr token, String name, String authType, Byte[] entity, AsyncCallback cb, Object state) +2004885

System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean&amp;amp; completedSynchronously) +155
</code></pre>

<p>Putting this line in our routes setup:</p>

<pre><code>routes.Add(new Route(""{service}.asmx/{*pathInfo}"", new StopRoutingHandler()));
</code></pre>

<p>still leaves us with the ""Failed to execute URL"" exception.  I know the route is matching because of this:</p>

<pre><code>public sealed class DieHandler : IRouteHandler
{
	#region IRouteHandler Members

	public IHttpHandler GetHttpHandler(RequestContext requestContext)
	{
		throw new NotImplementedException();
	}

	#endregion
}
routes.Add(new Route(""{service}.asmx/{*pathInfo}"", new DieHandler()));
</code></pre>

<p>With that route in place instead of ""Failed to Execute URL"" I see ""Method not implemented"" like I would expect.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that our * -> aspnet_isapi.dll is wreaking havoc, since I haven't found anyone else doing this while scouring google.</p>

<hr>

<p>Bob does this:</p>

<p>pubk_A = Alice's public key</p>

<p>entropy = bytes from cryptographic quality PRNG</p>

<p>encrypted_entropy = <i>RSA_Encrypt</i><sub>pubk_A</sub>(entropy)</p>

<p>hashed_entropy = <em>SHA2-512</em>(entropy)</p>

<p>encrypt_key<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[0:32]<br>
encrypt_nonce<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[32:48]<br>
hmac_key<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[48:64]</p>

<p>Bob then sends encrypted_entropy to Alice.</p>

<p>Then Alice does this:</p>

<p>privk_A = Alice's private key</p>

<p>entropy = <i>RSA_Decrypt</i><sub>privk_A</sub>(encrypted_entropy)</p>

<p>hashed_entropy = <em>SHA2-512</em>(entropy)</p>

<p>encrypt_key<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[0:32]<br>
encrypt_nonce<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[32:48]<br>
hmac_key<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[48:64]</p>

<hr>

<p>This works great for generating keys that can be used to communicate from Bob to Alice. But I need keys I can use in both directions. I was thinking of modifying the algorithm in this way:</p>

<hr>

<p>Bob does this with entropy:</p>

<p>pubk_B = Bob's public key</p>

<p>hashed_entropy<sub>BA</sub> = <em>SHA2-512</em>(<i>SHA2-256</i>(pubk_A) + entropy</p>

<p>encrypt_key<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[0:32]<br>
encrypt_nonce<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[32:48]<br>
hmac_key<sub>BA</sub> = hashed_entropy[48:64]</p>

<p>hashed_entropy<sub>AB</sub> = <em>SHA2-512</em>(<i>SHA2-256</i>(pubk_B) + entropy</p>

<p>encrypt_key<sub>AB</sub> = hashed_entropy[0:32]<br>
encrypt_nonce<sub>AB</sub> = hashed_entropy[32:48]<br>
hmac_key<sub>AB</sub> = hashed_entropy[48:64]</p>

<p>Alice can do the same thing on her side after she obtains entropy by decrypting encrypted_entropy.</p>

<hr>

<p>As you can see, now there are two sets of keys, one used for communicating from Bob to Alice, and another for communicating from Alice to Bob.</p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with this? What security risks am I taking? Is the security of the system less or more than if I simply had one party tweak a bit in the nonce? Is there a better way to handle this problem without adding round-trips?</p>

All users have a basic email retention policy. Only one user has Litigation Hold enabled for their mailbox. This has been enabled since late May of 2015.</p>

<p>Day to day, this user deletes approximately 30 emails - that number for illustrative purposes. They empty their ""deleted"" folder of these 30 emails every day. Essentially, shift deleting their email. </p>

<p>While all other users are configured to ""recover deleted items"" with a default policy of 14 days, this litigation hold user has their deleted items recoverable indefinitely, as far as I understand.</p>

<p>The problem is that when this litigation hold user right clicks their deleted items folder and selects ""recover deleted items"", the pop-up window doesn't populate with as many emails as expected. Historically, the emails go back to the end of May, but say they want to recover one of the 30 emails emptied from the deleted folder yesterday, only, say, 15 of those emails are listed. Again, 15 of 30 is a number I've made up, but it's very close to what is being experienced.</p>

<p>I can't find any info to suggest it's a config issue, so here I am asking if anyone knows what might be causing this. Retention policies across all users are rather high, I believe 5 years. Mailbox sizes for everyone all have at least 90~95% remaining space.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a <code>config.cfg</code> file, which has all the information about <code>Apache</code>, <code>Tomcat</code> and <code>MySQL's</code> user and password, as well as port numbers.</li>
<li>I use <code>ConfigParser</code> to have that information available.</li>
</ul>

<p>The installer script is iterative: you execute it like <code>sudo foo.run</code> and it prompts the command line so the person doing the installation can enter the inputs mentioned above. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Apache user: **[foo]** 
Apache password: **[bar]**
</code></pre>

<p>and after that information is entered, the installer actually installs the product. However, I want to automate the full process, including inputting those informations using <code>Python</code>.</p>

I need a <code>while</code> loop to read from it until <code>stdout</code> is empty, and then I would inject the data contained in <code>ConfigParser</code>.
Could someone please give an example how that could be done? Is there any other easier way of doing it? I'm open to any suggestions ... A first step for me could be doing a manual installer from python, using <code>Python's</code> <code>p.stdin.write()</code> to give the informations to the installer.</p>

<p>The different items do different things when they set a label, but at the end they should all do the same thing, which is a series of housekeeping activities. I know I can create a method in the base class to do these chores and then call that in each of the implementations, but that is bad because among other things if I forget to call it from one of the implementations, it will create a bug.</p>

<p>What is a good way to structure this?</p>

<p>Here is example code (how I am doing it now in Java):</p>

<pre><code>final public void _setLabel( String s ){
    if( s.trim().equals( ""null"" ) ) return;
    StringBuffer sbError = new StringBuffer();
    if( ! _setConstantValue( s, sbError ) ){
        Error.vShowError( ""failed to set value: "" + sbError );
        return;
    }
    sLabel = s;
    _update();
    _updateProperties();
    if( _isGroupMember() ) this.nodeGroup._update();
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is an abstract method ""_setLabel"" in the base class, so all my subclasses MUST implement this method. The last three lines in the method are always the same:</p>

<pre><code>_update();
_updateProperties();
if( _isGroupMember() ) this.nodeGroup._update();
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, I just copy and paste these lines into each implementation, but I would rather they get done in the base class somehow, so I can guarantee that they always occur. These must be called <strong>after</strong> everything else.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>

<p>Based on the marked answer below (thanks to user3736255), the solution is to use a non-virtual interface in C++ or a template method in Java (which is equivalent). So the new base class code is:</p>

<pre><code>final public void _setLabel( String s ){
    __setLabel( s );
    _update();
    _updateProperties();
    if( _isGroupMember() ) this.nodeGroup._update();
}

abstract protected void __setLabel( String s );
</code></pre>

<p>Each subclass implements the <code>__setLabel</code> method which is called by the template method <code>_setLabel</code> in the base class.</p>

I thought <strong>ShowWindow()</strong> with <strong>SW_HIDE</strong> as the second parameter would do the job, but it simply doesn't work. Yet <strong>SW_SHOW</strong> works just fine. I have the correct window handle for both controls, so that's not the issue.</p>

<p>I googled and all I could find was people asking how to hide dialogs, not controls. Either that or MFC-based applications, which doesn't apply here.
I'm using pure Windows API, <strong>no MFC</strong>.</p>

<p>What am I getting wrong?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: More info: I'm writing some simple class wrappers for WinApi controls. The WindowsControl class has, along other methods, the following methods for showing and hiding the Control:</p>

<pre><code>void Show() {
    ShowWindow(this-&gt;_hWnd,SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE);
}

void Hide() {
    ShowWindow(this-&gt;_hWnd,SW_HIDE);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Every control inherits from WindowsControl.</p>

<p>This image has the window layout so you understand exactly what I'm doing: <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PHQnH.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/PHQnH.png</a></p>

<p>When the user clicks inside the ""Chipset"" Static control, it'll load  information for a given Tile (which is stored in an array, but that's irrelevant). Depending on the setting, it'll hide the ""Edit bitwall"" button on the left and show the empty GroupBox behind it or viceversa.
Just to be clear this isn't something wrong with my windows api wrappers, I am getting the correct HWND. Though ShowWindow might not be able to be called from a Window Procedure that isn't the parent's (that'd be weird).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>: Using C++ with Visual Studio 2008, no MFC, no WTL, no CLR, no .NET</p>

<p><strong>EDIT3</strong>: I'll post even more code so it's easier</p>

<p>Inside the static's window procedure, I handle WN_LBUTTONDOWN like this:</p>

<pre><code>case WM_LBUTTONDOWN: {
  ...
  update_tiledata(c, l)


void update_tiledata(GroupBox * c, ListView* l ) {
    ...

   if (chp_copy.Tiles[selectedTile].Pass() == PT_BITWALL) {
          c-&gt;Controls(CTL_BTNEDITBIT)-&gt;Show();
          c-&gt;Controls(CTL_FRPHOLD)-&gt;Hide();
   } else {

          c-&gt;Controls(CTL_FRPHOLD)-&gt;Show();
          c-&gt;Controls(CTL_BTNEDITBIT)-&gt;Hide();
   }
   update_edits();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The ommited code does nothing to affect the classes, as I said before, ShowWindow with SW_HIDE IS getting called, with the correct HWND, but nothing is happening.</p>

I realize the only way to do this is to sort() the Queryset with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>sorted(queryset, key=lambda q: q.choice_entropy())
</code></pre>

<p>However, to incorporate this in ListView, and also allow users to select the ordering criteria, I would require something like this</p>

<pre><code>class IndexView(ListView):
    model = Question

    def get_queryset(self):
        queryset = super(IndexView, self).get_queryset()
        if 'order_by' in self.request.GET:
            if self.request.GET['order_by'] == 'entropy':
                return sorted(queryset, key=lambda q: q.choice_entropy())
            elif self.request.GET['order_by'] == 'newest':

            elif self.request.GET['order_by'] == ... (some other sorting criterion)

<p>The problem here (presumably) is that <code>sorted(queryset, key=lambda q: q.choice_entropy())</code> returns a <code>&lt;type 'list'&gt;</code> why <code>queryset</code> is of type <code>&lt;class 'django.db.models.query.QuerySet'&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I didn't think this would be a problem since <a href=""https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/views/generic/list.py#L196"" rel=""nofollow""><code>self.queryset</code> can actually be any iterable of items, not just a queryset.</a> but ListView doesn't seem to like this and I simply get <code>A server error occurred.

<p>I have a web application (SnapshotServer) which uses a WebBrowser control to take a snapshot images of a web page.</p>

<p>I use a WebBrowser control within SnapshotServer to navigate to a entry page of a secure web application (ImageHost) and then redirects me to my required page.
The ImageHost application is protected by FormsAuthentication, which uses cookies. The entry page I navigate to takes care of logging me in - which will create an Auth cookie.</p>

<p>Once a response is generated from the ImageHost, I convert the result within the WebBrowser control to an image.</p>

<p>Issue:</p>

<p>When I run SnapshotServer on my PC (Windows 7, IE8), using IIS7, and navigate to ImageHost on my development server (Windows 2008 R2, IE8), the result is as required - I'm logged into ImageHost and redirected to the page I want an image of.
When I run SnapshotServer on any Windows 2008 R2 server, using IIS7, and navigate to ImageHost on my development server (Windows 2008 R2, IE8), the result is not as required - ImageHost fails to log in - so my image is of the login page. The reason it fails to log in is that it isn't creating an Auth cookie.</p>

<p>So I'd like to know if anyone can tell me why the WebBrowser control, when run from a Windows 2008 server, cannot create cookies.</p>

I looked at the ButtonBase code through .NET Reflector and wow, that looks overly complicated. Is adding a command this complex??

As mentioned in Apple documentation : <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/UIKitUICatalog/UITabBar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/UIKitUICatalog/UITabBar.html</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tab bars are translucent by default on iOS 7. Additionally, there is a system blur applied to all tab bars. This allows your content to show through underneath the bar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this system blur is not visible on iPhone 4 and the <code>UITabBar</code> goes transparent on the device as shown below:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/wHOi5m6.jpg"" width=""400""></p>

<p>I <em>believe</em> that this might be happening because of the weaker GPU in iPhone 4 and thus it must be falling back to transparency instead of translucency. Reference : <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/09/new-lease-on-life-or-death-sentence-ios-7-on-the-iphone-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/09/new-lease-on-life-or-death-sentence-ios-7-on-the-iphone-4/</a></p>

<p>A simple solution to this can be to conditionally make the <code>UITabBar</code> <code>translucent</code> for iPhone 4. But instead of putting this dependancy on the device type, I want to know if I can somehow detect if the iOS is going to be falling back to transparency when GPU is weak? (Thus making the condition more appropriate)</p>

I have a page that shows a bunch of different pictures from different galleries, the user selects one, which prompts an ajax call back to my php page and jquery slides it over to show the carousel. This is technically working but my problem is that the carousel itself doesn't seem to reinitialize. The #carousel div gets the images and loads them up, but they are just images, and the pages are not updated. 
Using firebug, I can see that the first time it loads, it walks through </p>

<pre><code>$( ""#carousel"" ).rcarousel({
auto: {enabled: false},
start: generatePages,
visible: 4,
pageLoaded: pageLoaded,
width: 160,
height: 120,
margin:20
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>and then goes and does the generatePages and pageLoaded functions.
But after I click on an image, it still parses $( ""#carousel"" ).rcarousel({ and the options, but then it just stops. I need to know what to call to re-initialize (or kill and start over) the carousel.</p>

<p>After some rooting around, I found:</p>

<pre><code> return !( $.isFunction(callback) &amp;&amp;
 callback.call( this.element[0], event, data ) === false ||
 event.isDefaultPrevented() ); 
</code></pre>

<p>in the jquery.ui.widget.js file (line 230), but I'm not sure if that's the problem, or if it were, what to do about it...
Anyone have any suggestions or can point me in the right direction and I will literally mail you a beer!</p>

<p><em><strong></em>*Update***</strong>
So having done some more research, I think what I need to do is either completely destroy the widget or instead of using a sledgehammer, just reinit it somehow. 
I see that ui.widget.js has this function:</p>

<pre><code> destroy: function() {
this.element
.unbind( ""."" + this.widgetName )
.removeData( this.widgetName );
this.widget()
.unbind( ""."" + this.widgetName )
.removeAttr( ""aria-disabled"" )
.removeClass(
this.widgetBaseClass + ""-disabled "" +
this.namespace + ""-state-disabled"" );
},
</code></pre>

<p>I tried adding:</p>

<pre><code>    destroy: function()
    {
        this.rcarousel.remove();
        $.Widget.prototype.destroy.call(this);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>to ui.carousel.js and then calling it via </p>

<pre><code>$( ""#carousel"" ).rcarousel( ""destroy"" );
</code></pre>

<p>but that completely breaks the carousel.</p>

<p>So how can I improve upon this, to get the desired result? I know I can use <code>s/foo/bar/g</code> to replace it but I can't get the expression to separate properly. Also how will I access the nested groups?</p>

<p><strong>Notice that I am missing the last row of data.</strong> In order to copy the data, I'm using <code>setGridParam</code> and then triggering a <code>reloadGrid</code>, like this:</p>

&lt;/html&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, you can assume</p>

<ol>
<li>The html is served by Google Drive Hosting.</li>
<li>The reference to the Google Doc is static.</li>
<li>There is no need to edit the Doc from within the public html page (i.e it's read-only in that context).</li>  
</ol>

<p>I've read through the Apps Script documentation and it looks as though something might be possible with some combination of Document Service and Content Service. For instance, Document Service has getBody() and copy() methods, but it's not clear whether the objects returned by these calls can be rendered WYSIWYG as html for insertion into an html container.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> I'm trying to implement a safe easy-to-use CMS for a small nonprofit. I've prototyped a website framework that's hosted
on Google Drive. So far it looks promising,  but changes require being able to edit the html.   We have a number of people who can create content in a word-processor-like environment but only couple including myself
who can cope with HTML/CSS/JQuery/AppsScript. </p>

<p>If I could concentrate on the overall framework and let the others update the content for 
events, etc., that would be a huge win. Basically, I'd be very happy if they were able to edit the Google Doc and then manually reload the web page to see the result.</p>

<p>I realize there are many approaches for CMS, but for now, I'm interested in exploring a pure Google Docs/Google Drive solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd rather hide than delete because deletions in tables eventually lead to table index havoc that causes queries to take longer than expected (much worse than Inserts or Updates).  This won't be a problem in the beginning of the site (it gets exponentially worse over time), but seems like an easy issue to never encounter by just not deleting anything (yet) as part of the ""everyday"" web application functionality.  We can always handle deletions much later as part of a Data Optimization &amp; Maintenance process and re-index tables in that process on some (yet to be determined) scheduled basis.</p>

<p>In my UITypeEditor, because I'm working with a read only property, I'm careful to pass back the original value (after updating the relevant sub property).</p>

<p>This change is reflected immediately on the designer but will not be persisted unless I do something like resize the control that the property is attached to.</p>

<p>To fix this I, blindly, include a call to context.OnComponentChanged() before returning the value.</p>

<p>I can see why this is needed. It's a reference type, I've altered it (not replaced it), and the property grid doesn't know this. I have a couple of questions for clarification:</p>

<p>Do I need a call to context.OnComponentChanging as well? A simple call to OnComponentChanged works in the tests I've done so far, but I don't want biting on the arse at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Also, is there any danger that, with my call to OnComponentChanging, I'll be persisting other components, in DesignerTransactions, that I shouldn't be persisting?</p>

<p>I have given the click event for all the a tag in the webpage inside the iframe</p>

<pre><code>$('a').bind('click', function(e){
      var path = $(this).getPath();
      var ahash={
                   'path':path

});
</code></pre>

<p>The ""path"" in the click event gives the path of the clicked a tag (eg. html > body > div#bar > ul#abc.def.ghi > li#foo). The getFrameElement() returns the frame which is clicked. Now what i want to do is use this path and trigger the click event in other iframe</p>

<p>I have defined sendevent function from where the other iframe gets the event of the parent iframe and triggers the same event as parent and synchronize.</p>

<pre><code>document.sendevent=function(e, ahash){
    var iframes= parent.document.getElementsByTagName('iframe');
    for (var i= iframes.length; i--;) {
        var iframe= iframes[i];

                  }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is how i want to do and make the iframe work, follow the path of the parent iframe clicked element and then trigger the click event to make other iframe synchronize with the parent iframe using the path</p>

<p>The click event is not getting triggered inside the sendevent function but i am getting the path of the parent iframe clicked element when i do console.log(ahash .path) inside the sendevent function. How can i make this method work or something similar like that. Please suggest me some solution how to do this.</p>

I want to execute the second form on click on button but it seems that it ignores when I'm  passing the form's id on execute attribute. But when I replace it with 'execute="":form1""' it runs correctly(the information from the form is sent to server). Can someone tell me why won't work with the id of second form, or how can I achieve this: with one button to execute any form i want from the page.( as it is now no information is sent to server, only the listener is called).</p>

<p>Code bellow:</p>

        &lt;h:inputText id=""input1"" value=""#{counterMB.number1}"" /&gt;

<p>Update: 
so to be more explicit: from what I have read I can use ajax to update/refresh etc some parts of a page instead of refreshing the whole page. What i have tried to do is group some components in different forms and execute a form at a time to see how it behaves. It works perfectly if I use the id of first group(form) but doesn't work at all if I use the id of the second form(it calls the action but doesn't submit any data from any form). I don't understand why. (PS for those who claim i lack some knowledge : this is the reason of asking questions isn't it? I'm trying to learn some new stuff)</p>

<p>I am going to setup a batch lot of runs and Log the results over different interation sizes and then graph the results to <strong>identify a memory usage trend</strong> which can then be extrapolated for any given hardware.</p>

<p>Looking for advice on the best way to implement this, <strong>what .net methods, classes to use</strong> or should I use external tools.

 I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale

<p>;</p>

<p>I don't understand how my query even works in the where clause here: </p>

<pre><code>and ps.date_created = (select min(ps2.date_created) 
from plate_set ps2 
where ps2.campaign_id = cam.id)
</code></pre>

<p>In my mind,  ps.date_created should be a join where ps.date_created = the first plate set created in every campaign</p>

<p>something like</p>

<pre><code>join (
select min(plate_set.date_created) as created_date
 from plate_set 
join campaign on plate_set.campaign_id 
group by campaign.id 
) helperTable on helperTable.NotSureHowToJoinLikeThis on ps.date_created
</code></pre>

<p>is what I have actually correct and sql queries the campaign ids then filters on the row with the lowest date created or can someone help me with the join I should do to write it better?</p>

I have a pretty good grasp on the language basics at this point, but I still find myself often ""fighting"" the type system.</p>

<p>Long story short, breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms are the same aside from the mechanics of pushing/popping to their underlying collection. Depth-first would <em>prepend</em> new possibilities and use a Stack, while Breadth-first would <em>append</em> and use a Queue. </p>

<p>To keep my algorithm the same, I created a typeclass called ""GiveGrab"" (I know, horrible name) with the intention of pimping ... err ... <em>enriching</em> collections with these ""default"" push (give) and pop-like (grab) operations.For example, grab would result in a call to .dequeue() for queues, and .pop() for stacks.</p>

<p>Here's (a somewhat abbreviated version of) the code:</p>

<pre><code>object Example extends App {

  trait GiveGrab[A, M[A]] {
    def give(x: A*): M[A]
    def grab(): A
  }

  implicit class GiveGrabQueue[T](q: Queue[T]) extends GiveGrab[T,Queue[T]] {
    override def give(x: T*) = q ++= x
    override def grab() = q.dequeue()
  }

  class TestClass[T, X &lt;% GiveGrab[T, Queue[T]]](var storage: X) {}

  val test = new TestClass[Int, Queue[Int]](new Queue[Int]())

}
</code></pre>

<p>When trying to compile this, I get the following errors:</p>

<pre><code>Error:(18, 39) scala.collection.mutable.Queue[T] takes no type parameters, expected: one
  class TestClass[T, X &lt;% GiveGrab[T, Queue[T]]](var storage: X) {}
                                  ^
Error:(13, 67) scala.collection.mutable.Queue[T] takes no type parameters, expected: one
  implicit class GiveGrabQueue[T](q: Queue[T]) extends GiveGrab[T,Queue[T]] {
                                                              ^
</code></pre>

<p>That said, it took me a lot of trial and error to even get to this point. I'm not sure if my trait is really supposed to be typed
<code>trait GiveGrab[A, M[A]]</code>
or
<code>trait GiveGrab[A, M[_]]</code>
or
<code>trait GiveGrab[A, M]</code></p>

<p>The error ""takes no type parameters, expected: one"" doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me at this point, and there's only a handful of other posts about that message (some related to dependent types, and some related to the Play framework).</p>

<p>Somewhat related: is there a good article for understanding Scala type signatures? I read through Programming in Scala 2nd Ed, but it didn't really touch on this sort of type gymnastics (either that, or I just missed it.)</p>

For my Spring application, I would love to create a <strong><em>@ManyToMany</em></strong> relationship between two classes, but it refuses to create the third middle table supplied with two <em>cascade options</em>.</p>

<p>Both my classes have the proper implementations of <em>hashCode()</em> and <em>equals(...)</em> and both are involved in other relationships, <strong><em>non @ManyToMany</em></strong> of course, that support <strong><em>CASCADE</em></strong> options and work fine.</p>

<pre><code>[Stream]-(0..n)--&lt;streams_tags&gt;--(0..n)-[Tag]

<p>The following is a fragment of my DDL script regarding the ManyToMany relationship:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE streams_tags (tagged_streams INTEGER NOT NULL, tags INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (tagged_streams, tags))
...
ALTER TABLE streams_tags ADD CONSTRAINT UNQ_streams_tags_0 UNIQUE (tags, tagged_streams)
...
ALTER TABLE streams_tags ADD CONSTRAINT FK_streams_tags_tagged_streams FOREIGN KEY (tagged_streams) REFERENCES TAGS (TID)
...
ALTER TABLE streams_tags ADD CONSTRAINT FK_streams_tags_tags FOREIGN KEY (tags) REFERENCES STREAMS (SID)
</code></pre>

<p>The following stubs are extracted straight from the involved classes, <em>Stream</em> and <em>Tag</em>:</p>

<pre><code>@ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@JoinTable(name = Stream.TAGS_JOIN_TABLE, 
            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = Stream.TAGS_JOIN_COLUMN), 
            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = Tag.TAGGED_STREAMS_JOIN_COLUMN), 
            uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = {
        Stream.TAGS_JOIN_COLUMN, Tag.TAGGED_STREAMS_JOIN_COLUMN }))
@CascadeOnDelete
List&lt;Tag&gt; tags;
</code></pre>

<p>The following is the <em>Tag</em> class, which doesn't hold directly the relationship.</p>

<pre><code>@ManyToMany(mappedBy = ""tags"")  
List&lt;Stream&gt; streams;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the predictable error that I received when I try to delete a tagged <strong><em>Stream</em></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: update or delete on table ""streams"" violates foreign key constraint ""fk_streams_tags_tags"" on table ""streams_tags""
  Dettaglio: Key (sid)=(2) is still referenced from table ""streams_tags"".

<p>After trudging a bit on Google I found out that the gem <strong>activerecord-deprecated_finders</strong> seems to not have been released on Rubygems yet, which would explain that last error. <a href=""http://yehudakatz.com/2010/12/16/clarifying-the-roles-of-the-gemspec-and-gemfile/"" rel=""nofollow"">Yehuda Katz</a> suggests that these kind of dependencies can be declared on the Gemfile and would override the gemspec definition, which the good folks that develop Rails have indeed done:</p>

<pre><code># rails/Gemfile
...
gem 'activerecord-deprecated_finders', github: 'rails/activerecord-deprecated_finders', branch: 'master'
...
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried the suggestion of one of the commenters on Yehuda's post but it also didn't work:</p>

<pre><code># rails/Gemfile
...
@dependencies.delete_if{ |d| d.name == 'activerecord-deprecated_finders'  }
...
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm a bit of at a loss as to why the <code>bundle install</code> didn't go work. I found a reference to that gem on <code>activerecord/activerecord.gemspec</code> and commenting out that solves the issue but that hardly seems like an acceptable solution. Does anyone know where I might have gone wrong? I'm using Ruby 1.9.3p286 and Bundler 1.2.3.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: I saw plenty of info regarding this very gem while generating a new Rails 4.0.0.beta application, which is not what I'm trying to accomplish here.</p>

<pre><code>Button bf[];
public static final int[] Buttons = { R.id.b1, R.id.b2, R.id.b3, R.id.b4,
        R.id.b5, R.id.b6, R.id.b7, R.id.b8, R.id.b9, R.id.bBack,
        R.id.bClearAll, R.id.bClear };
</code></pre>

<p>I have a static final int that holds some of my buttons, which is list in the header.
Within my onCreate method I set up my buttons:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {

        bf[i] = (Button) findViewById(Buttons[i - 1]);
        bf[i].setOnClickListener(this);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Nice and easy right? but then when I try to reference them in the switch and case (within my implemented onClickListener method, I'm having problems:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        case Buttons[i-1]:
            Toast.makeText(this, bf[i].getText(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        break;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work, so then I just tried a single reference:</p>

<pre><code>switch (v.getId()) {
    case Buttons[0]:
        Toast.makeText(this, bf[1].getText(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        break;
</code></pre>

<p>which doesn't work either?!?!  Help please?</p>

It works when there is no existing Image Object, I just simply create a new Image, add it to User (using setter) Object and save it, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public void addImage(Image image){
    image.setUser(this);
        setImage(image);
    }

    }

<p>Problem occurs when updating the Image.  I have to manually add each image property to the existing image object (see following method).  If I use the above addImage(), it just saves new record without removing the existing Object causing multiple records to appear in the database. </p>

<p>Can somebody have a look and help me identify the problem? Thanks</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The querying process starts every X seconds, eg a cron job runs a python script</p></li>

<p>ps - regarding the particulars of twitter: I know that it sends emails for following and direct messages, but sometimes one might want the flexibility of parsing @replies. In those cases, I believe polling is as good as it gets.</p>

<p>pps - twitter limits bots to 100 requests per 60 minutes. I don't know if this also limits web scraping or rss feed reading. Anyone know how easy or hard it is to be whitelisted?</p>

<p>I was hoping to be able to use a MULTI capture group to make this work.  I found this <a href=""http://www.regular-expressions.info/captureall.html"" rel=""nofollow"">PAGE</a> talking about the common mistake between repeating a capturing group and capturing a repeated group.  I need to capture a repeated group.  For some reason I just could not make mine work right though.  Anyone else have an idea?</p>

<p>Note: If I could get rid of the leading and trailing spaces EX: ""1234567123456"",""D"",""TEST1 "" ending up as ""1234567123456"",""D"",""TEST1"" that would be even better but not necessary.</p>

<pre><code>msvcr110.dll is missing. 
</code></pre>

<p>I have followed some instructions given here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14557245/wamp-shows-error-msvcr100-dll-is-missing-when-install"">WAMP shows error &#39;MSVCR100.dll&#39; is missing when install</a></p>

<p>However, none of the advice worked for me. I have already installed Visual C++ for windows 32 bits and Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012. After that I installed Visual C++ 2008, it didn't worked either. </p>

<p>And even after that I installed vcredist_x86.exe. This gave me an option to repair my Visual C++, and so I did.</p>

<p>In all my tries I restarted my computer.</p>

<p>I didn't install Visual c++ for windows 64 bits because my os is running a 32 version.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>The collection does not have to be implementing any particular interface, or be convertible to another collection (however of that is possible it would be nice).</p>

<p>It does not have to be thread safe, but if it is.... good!</p>

<p>Returning -1 when not found or error situation is OK.</p>

<p>The purpose of the collection is that I quickly need to know at which position a newly inserted record was put in. Also I want to look up at what position a record exists.</p>

<p>The collection doesn't need to support duplicate keys.</p>

<p>--- update ----</p>

<p>I went with the ArrayList solution, where I keep it sorted by doing a binary lookup before inserting (to get the index where it should be inserted). This way the position in the list always correspond to the row number (in the table that that is synced with this list). It's fast and simple. I'm sure there must exists a more robust implementation than mine though?!?!</p>

There are times where we need to remove certain keywords from the list. The process includes various match-type policies to determine if the keywords should be removed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>EXACT</strong>: <code>WHERE keyword = '{term}'</code></li>
<li><strong>CONTAINS</strong>: <code>WHERE keyword LIKE '%{term}%'</code></li>
<li><strong>TOKEN</strong>: <code>WHERE keyword LIKE '% {term} %' OR keyword LIKE '{term} %'
OR keyword LIKE '% {term}'</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, when a list is processed, it can only use one of the match-types listed above. But, all 30mil+ keywords must be scanned for matches, returning the results for the matches. Currently, this process can take hours/days to process depending on the number of keywords in the list of keywords to search for.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to optimize the process so this will run much faster?</p>

Here is an example query to search for Holiday Inn:</p>

a.setComment(""a"");

Run b = new Run();
b.setComment(""b"");

List&lt;Run&gt; runs = new LinkedList&lt;Run&gt;();
runs.add(a);
runs.add(b);

Sequence seq = new Sequence();
seq.setRuns(runs);

persist(seq); // order in database should be ""a"", then ""b""
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I check the database, it's not always so that the instance <strong>a</strong> gets a lower identifier than <strong>b</strong>; it seems to behave as if the list is just a bucket.</p>

<p>How do I keep the order of the list when using persistence? If the instance <strong>a</strong> is added before <strong>b</strong>, I want to keep the order in the database as the entries are results of a sequential execution of tests and the order must be perserved.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<pre><code>filter_functions: {
        // Add these options to the select dropdown (regex example)
        2 : {
          ""A - D"" : function(e, n, f, i) { return /^[A-D]/.test(e); },
          ""E - H"" : function(e, n, f, i) { return /^[E-H]/.test(e); },
          ""I - L"" : function(e, n, f, i) { return /^[I-L]/.test(e); },
          ""M - P"" : function(e, n, f, i) { return /^[M-P]/.test(e); },
          ""Q - T"" : function(e, n, f, i) { return /^[Q-T]/.test(e); },

          ""Y - Z"" : function(e, n, f, i) { return /^[Y-Z]/.test(e); }
        }
      }
</code></pre>

<p>This makes a custom filter function for the 3rd column. I wonder if it's possible to specify a selector, e.g. <code>.columnWithCoolFilteFunction</code> instead of the column number?</p>

<p>The reason is that I have multiple tables where some of the columns contain similar data - and thus should be filtered in the same way - but the column number might be 1 in one table and 5 in another.</p>

<p>I understand that one solution would be to initiate every table with its own options, but I really like to initiate every table the same way (less code, yay!).</p>

<p>Possible?</p>

Now, I haven't done a lot of network programming in my days, so I don't know if it is reasonable to to expect that they stay connected a lot longer than that? How long can one expect an <em>active</em> TCP connection to live? How common are disconnections like these?</p>

<p>I have conducted these tests in order to test my own local network, as I have been having problems with MSN logging out once an hour, downloads stopping after a couple of minutes and other strange behavior.
