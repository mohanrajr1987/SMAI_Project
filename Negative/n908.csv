"31512465","1","31699474","","2015-07-20 09:01:20","","9","243","<p>We are trying to implement <a href=""https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/android/app"">Google's App Indexing</a> feature. We've added the deep links to our website with the rel-alternate tag in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>android-app://id.of.the.app/scheme/?screen=Product&amp;product=123456
</code></pre>

<p>Now we get content mismatch crawling errors. If I use the QR code for testing from <a href=""https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/webmasters/test"">here</a> everything works fine. But if I open a crawling error, click on ""Open App Page"" and use the adb command for testing I can see that everything starting from the ampersand doesn't get passed to the app and therefore my product data cannot be loaded. I suspect that's how the crawler checks the content of the app and that's why we get Content Mismatch Errors.</p>

<p>Also if I use the ""Fetch as Google"" from the Search Console it looks like everything from the ampersand gets cut off.</p>

<p>I checked on eBay as it is working with their app and that's the link they are using:</p>

<pre><code>android-app://com.ebay.mobile/ebay/link/?nav=item.view&amp;amp;id=221559043026&amp;amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Froverns%2F1%2F711-13271-9788-0%3Fmpcl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252FRoxy-Fairness-Backpack-Womens-Red-RPM6-%252F221559043026%253Fpt%253DLH_DefaultDomain_0
</code></pre>

<p>They have encoded the ampersand with <code>&amp;amp;</code> but if I do that and test it with the ""Fetch as Google"" function it doesn't work either. </p>

<p>These users seem to have the same issue, but they didn't share a solution (if they found one):</p>

<p>I'm thankful for any ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>

<p>That's how I'm interpreting the deep link inside the Android app:</p>

<pre><code>Uri data = getIntent().getData();
String scheme = data.getScheme();
if (scheme.equals(""scheme"")) {
    String screen = data.getQueryParameter(""screen"");
    if (screen.equals(""Product"")) {
        String product = data.getQueryParameter(""product"");
        // Open Product and give it product number as intent data
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Here's the relevant part of our Manifest.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity
    android:name=""id.of.the.app.StartActivity""
    android:configChanges=""orientation|screenSize""
    android:label=""@string/app_title""
    android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustPan|stateHidden""&gt;

        &lt;intent-filter&gt;
            &lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" /&gt;
            &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"" /&gt;

It is possible, that I don't get it right, but my current perspective is just confusion.</p>

<p>You save a couple of salts in a table, but you must reference them in the table with password hash, which allows you to rebuild the password hash. So I would do it like this:</p>

<p>By creating a new password, save hash ( input + salt ) into the table</p>

<p><strong>Table</strong>:
Password: <em>hash</em>,
Salt reference: <em>123</em></p>

<p>I thought, this is used to prevent ""dictionary attacks"", but what happens, when the user uses a password, which is contained by the dictionary. The attacker can easily pass through.</p>

<p>Just a list with events, which are happening in my point of view:</p>

<ol>
<li>User/Attacker ""types"" in this login data</li>
<li>Email/Username is looked up and returns salt reference</li>
<li>Look up salt with reference</li>
<li>Build password</li>
<li>Check password in table with email/username</li>
</ol>

<p>So how can the salt matter, if it is automatically looked up?
This might be a bit confusing, but in the end it makes all sense to me.</p>

So, I ran the R the code:</p>

library(MASS) #for fitdistr function

samples&lt;-5000

# first n is the number of nodes, the n/samples is the probability of making 
# an edge between any two nodes

d &lt;- degree(g) #finds the degree of each node in graph

# fit should be done on frequency, not on probability, and not on summary
fits&lt;-fitdistr(d,""Poisson"") 

dd&lt;- as.numeric(table(d)) # creates a summary of each degree and its frequency

plot(dd, xlab = ""degree"", ylab=""frequency"") # plot degree distribution

a&lt;-1:length(dd)

# multiply by original samples to create frequency plots
lines(a,dpois(a,lambda=fits$estimate)* samples) 
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/hunPQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I get a plot in which it looks like the distribution of degrees is indeed Poisson but the best fitting Poisson distribution is dramatically right shifted compared to the actual degree distribution.  Given that the graph was created so that there would be on average 20 links per node, it makes sense that the best fitting lambda value is around 20, but why does the actual distribution have a mode around 14 (although the mean of the degrees is also around 20)?</p>

<p>Otherwise, </p>

<pre><code> $_SESSION['language'] = ""FRA""

}
else
{
   $word1 = ""bonjour""
   $word2 = ....

I've created a class I would like to import but I'm getting the ""TypeError: 'module' object is not callable"" error.  All the .py modules are stored in a directory call ""lib"".  In the lib directory are the following modules - noun.py, verb.py, context.py, word.py, base.py.  Within the lib directory is the --init--.py file.  I'm trying to import the noun.py module into the context module.  Below is the code in the context.py module that is used to import the other modules.</p>

<pre><code>from lib import verb, word, base
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work fine for importing the verb, word and base modules.  But when I add noun to the end of that statement to make it...</p>

<pre><code>from lib import, verb, word, base, noun
</code></pre>

<p>I get the ""TypeError: 'module' object is not callable"" error.  I've also tried...</p>

<pre><code>import noun #Also produces the same error
</code></pre>

<p>So I tried the following...</p>

<pre><code>from noun import *
</code></pre>

<p>When I import the module this way the error is eliminated but when I reference an attribute of the noun module I get the error ""AttributeError: noun instance has no attribute 'get_stem_used'"".  Below is the code from the noun module...</p>

<pre><code>from base import base

class noun:
    wordBase = None
    stemBase = None

    def __init__(self, pId):
        b = base()
        wrdBase = b.get_word_base(pId)
        self.wordBase = wrdBase['base']
        stmBase = b.get_stemBase(pId)
        self.stemBase = stmBase['stem']
        #Code to make sure the module is instantiated correctly and the data is validated

    def get_output(self):
        return self.wordBase

    def get_stem_used(self):
        return self.stemBase
</code></pre>

<p>The verb.py module has essentially the same code as the noun.py module.  In the context.py module I have the following code...</p>

<pre><code> n = noun(id)
 base = n.get_output()
 #I print out base to make sure everything is good and it is

 v = verb(id)
 verb = v.get_output()
</code></pre>

<p>""n"" and ""v"" are then passed to the word.py module.  Within the word.py module is the following code.</p>

<pre><code>if v.get_stem_used == ""Some Value"":
    #do whatever
elif n.get_stem_used == ""Another value"":  #This line produces the ""attribute error""
    #do something
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to access n.get_stem_used I get the ""AttributeError: noun instance has no attribute 'get_stem_used'"" error.  I've done some research and I ran into this url <a href=""http://effbot.org/zone/import-confusion.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://effbot.org/zone/import-confusion.htm</a> this leads me to believe that I'm not properly importing the noun module and since I'm not importing the noun module using the following code...it won't allow me to refer to the elements with the noun class using the dot notation.</p>

<pre><code>from lib import, verb, word, noun
</code></pre>

<p>It's weird to me that adding ""noun"" to the end of the above statement isn't working but it seems to properly import all the other modules.  I've seen that mixing tabs and spaces can cause this error but I've checked using my editor that it is properly tabbed.  I've been working on this for a while so any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Below is what is in the --init--.py</p>

<p>It actually seems to be a problem of length of file url. When my file url (sDocumentUrl) is longer than the length of my script url in which I call EditDocument it works perfectly fine.

(when user request login page i.e for manager and for end user, it will redirect to some action page which I also do in page_load event by 'httpcontext.current.request.isauthorized'). </p>

<p>The above is also valid in case of a manager.</p>

<p>Is there any way that an end user can view only his side of application? vice versa</p>

<li><p>Create a cookie which stores an encrypted form user type i.e he is manager or end user and check it in page_load event.</p></li>
<li><p>store it in some session variable</p></li>

<p>Whenever I've made use of Entity Framework in clickonce desktop applications, I've suffered a bit with the ""entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker"" error. This arises when multiple versions of the same database object are updated by different versions of the context. </p>

<p>On a web project, it's easy to bypass this issue by sending all the Db calls through some sort of singleton pattern on the server. If you're farming out a lot of Db update/insert calls to a service, you can do the same.</p>

<p>But what if you had a distributed application (e.g. WPF via clickonce) which potentially had a lot of users connecting to the database. Each user has their own install of the code, so even if you separate out the business logic from the Db logic, each user will still have their own copy of the context. </p>

<p>Is there any sort of pattern or technique that would allow inserts/updates direct from the application while avoiding the ""multiple contexts"" problem? Or is using something like a Windows service the only way to achieve this?</p>

dynamically with <code>mmap</code> (well, GLibc caches thread stacks but this
could change at any time), and allocates kernel stacks dynamically

<p>However, the first time (and only the first) I click on a menu element (triggering a .show() call via onclick=""javascript:showContent(URL)"") the target div gets visibile but does not fade in - it just appears. Every other time I click on a menu item the animation works fine.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?<br />
Thank you for your help.</p>

function startup() {
    $('#hiddenMenu').show(millis, foo());
    $('#footer').show(millis, foo());
    //$(""""+""#hiddenContent""+"""").show('slow', foo());

<h3>Here is rules():</h3>

<pre><code>public function rules() 
{ 
  $newRules = array(
    array('password_verification', 'required'),
    array('password_verification', 'length', 'min'=&gt;6, 'max'=&gt;32),

    array('email', 'email'),
    array('valid_until_formated','compare',

  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>(sorry for the format of the code).</p>

<h3>And here is the problem:</h3>

<p>I want to test if ""valid_until_formated"" is greater than ""valid_from_formated"".</p>

<p>When I submit my form with wrong values (valid_from greater than vali_ until) I get an error message, I can see it on firebug but the values are inserted in data base.</p>

<p>But for instance if I try with a username already used or a password with fewer character than 6 then I have an error and nothing is created in database?</p>

<p>Does anybody have an idea why this rule doesn't work (even if I get an error message) ?
(this is the format of valid_until_formated, for example: ""20121118"" )</p>

<p>Thanks for reading me and sorry for my approximate English.</p>

<p>Have a good day :)</p>

<p>So, the login works fine. But, again, how do i now post to a different form, or load the entire form + submission details into a url? I need to post data after being logged in and submit the form. The form will return data I will then parse out. Basically, all of this can be done manually but this program will save me time by logging in, submitting, and parsing automatically.</p>

Not only is it a great VCS, it's running laps around FTP when pushing via ssh. I did run into a hitch this evening though, and I'm wondering if you fine folk can help me resolve it.</p>

<p>There are certain files in a project that I want to track, but don't want to push to production. Is there a way to push to a production server while excluding certain files from the repo? Two great examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>.less files don't need to be on a production server at all, but ABSOLUTELY should still be tracked</li>
<li>As my local and production environments operate under different domains, the .htaccess files vary slightly. I still want to track these, as most of the rules are universal (and a pain to rewrite if lost) - but every time I push my local .htaccess live, it breaks my production environment and I have to fix the file by hand.</li>
</ul>

<p>If possible, I'd like to keep everything under a single commit/push. My workflow is beautifully simple (except for this one thing), and adding extra steps or complicating factors would make me a sad Moose.</p>

"20597055","1","20597491","","2013-12-15 16:47:56","","5","176","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I’m in the process of creating a shortcut for lambdas, since the repeated use of <code>function (…) …</code> clutters my code considerably. As a remedy, I’m trying out alternative syntaxes inspired by other languages such as Haskell, as far as this is possible in R. Simplified, my code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>f &lt;- function (...) {
    args &lt;- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)$...
    last &lt;- length(args)
    params &lt;- c(args[-last], names(args)[[last]])

    function (...)
        eval(args[[length(args)]],
             envir = setNames(list(...), params),
             enclos = parent.frame())
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows the following code:</p>

<pre><code>f(x = x * 2)(5)       # =&gt; 10
f(x, y = x + y)(1, 2) # =&gt; 3
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Of course the real purpose is to use this with higher-order functions<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<pre><code>Map(f(x = x * 2), 1 : 10)
</code></pre>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, I sometimes have to <em>nest</em> higher-order functions and then it stops working:</p>

<pre><code>f(x = Map(f(y = x + y), 1:2))(10)
</code></pre>

<p>yields “Error in <code>eval(expr, envir, enclos)</code>: object <code>x</code> not found”. The conceptually equivalent code using <code>function</code> instead of <code>f</code> works. Furthermore, other nesting scenarios also work:</p>

<pre><code>f(x = f(y = x + y)(2))(3) # =&gt; 5
</code></pre>

<p>I’m suspecting that the culprit is the parent environment of the nested <code>f</code> inside the map: it’s the top-level environment rather than the outer <code>f</code>’s. But I have no idea how to fix this, and it also leaves me puzzled that the second scenario above works. Related questions (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/17732314/1968"">such as this one</a>) suggest workarounds which are not applicable in my case.</p>

<p>Clearly I have a gap in my understanding of environments in R. Is what I want possible at all?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Of course this example could simply be written as <code>(1 : 10) * 2</code>. The real application is with more complex objects / operations.</p>

<p>So when I call the method ""edit()"" I change the showAll variable's value so it renders the second form and ""hide"" the first one. Problem is after I do that the command buttons in the second form do nothing. (Don't even enter the method)</p>

<p>Here's my bean</p>

<pre><code>    @Named(value = ""tablaBean"")

<p>Any advice on what I might be doing wrong is appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>I did a little more debugging and I found out that my managed bean is being called every time I hit the edit button in the first form, so I'm guessing the problem is my conversation bean.</p>

<h2>Edit 2</h2>

<p>I changed the scope of the backing bean to Application, now it didn't get called when hitting the edit button, but the command buttons still don't work</p>

Because we now broadcast in HD and that involves a certain amount of compression, any audio files that we play, if they have ever been compressed with mp3 (or any other lossy) compression, will sound pretty bad on the air when listening on an HD receiver.</p>

<p>I am looking for a way to scan our audio file library and determine which files are likely to have been MP3s at some point in their lives. I believe if I take a look with a spectrum analyzer with, say, Audacity or Audition, and I see that telltale dropoff at 16K, that the file has been MP3'ed before. Is there a way to scan several hundred or thousand files with Sox or another command-line program and get a report of which filenames have that dropoff? Or does somebody know of another way to tell?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>[Edit] Here is where I'm at now. Getting somewhere on this. I have a python script that looks at all my files and sees if they are WAV files containing mpeg encoded audio by examining the AudioFormat byte. If this is anything other than '1', I put the file on a list to be replaced immediately. This is the first routine. If it is a '1', it is a PCM encoded WAV file, but it could contain previously-mpeg-encoded audio. So I need to examine it using sox (second routine). But I am having trouble getting the sox analysis to return the rms value of the filtered audio file when using python.</p>

<p>This works perfectly (bash shell script):</p>

<pre><code>for f in *.[Ww][Aa][Vv]; do

sox $f output.wav sinc 16k
printf $f &gt;&gt;rms.txt
printf , &gt;&gt;rms.txt
sox output.wav -n stat 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed -n 's#^RMS     amplitude:[^0-9]*\([0-9.]*\)$#\1#p'    &gt;&gt;rms.txt

done
</code></pre>

<p>Creates a file with the filename and the value of the RMS amplitude (that's the only thing that seems to tell the tale properly).</p>

<p>But since I want both routines to run together in my python script, I need to do something like this (Python):</p>

<pre><code>##strWAVFile is the name of the file, stHeaderFields holds metadata. Output.wav 
##is the temporary file created by sox to hold the high-pass-filtered audio that 
##needs to be scanned for the RMS amplitude value.

subprocess.call(['sox', strWAVFile, 'output.wav', 'sinc', '16k'])
        with open('rms.txt','a') as the_file:
            the_file.write(strWAVFile)
            the_file.write('|')
            the_file.write(stHeaderFields['Artist'])
            the_file.write('|')
            the_file.write(stHeaderFields['Title'])
            the_file.write('|')
            the_file.close()
        subprocess.call((""sox output.wav -n stat 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed -n 's#^RMS     amplitude:[^0-9]*\([0-9.]*\)$#\1#p' &gt;&gt;rms.txt""),shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>All I get for the RMS amplitude values in my 'rms.txt' file is an image that I assume depicts a non-printable character (it's a rectangle with 0 0 0 1 in it. My rep isn't high enough to post an image yet.</p>

<p>Should be something like 0.00001423 etc.</p>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>Got it working. I needed to escape my \1 to \1. Wasn't saving it properly. All is working as advertised now. If anyone needs this let me know. When I have it cleaned up and commented thoroughly I will post the full python script here.</p>

I'm using the Android Screenshot Library (ASL for short) project as a base, and I'm modifying it to suit my needs. I can also freely modify Android's source code for it. The goal is to have something like what the Galaxy Note does: you take a screenshot with a key press combo and then an editor shows up which allows you to change the image however you like. You could take a screenshot anywhere: on the main screen, while using apps, etc.</p>

<p>Right now I have 3 working parts: a native binary that captures the screen buffer, a service that talks to the native binary and retrieves the screenshot, and the editor. But I'm not sure how I could join the 3 things together. The native binary can be added to the Android prebuilt part and init.rc can be modified to execute it as root when booting (I still have to do this though). The editor is a simple app that can be included in Android as well. But I still can't figure out what to do with the service.</p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to capture a key press combo (say power button and volume down, or maybe two of the front buttons), which would trigger the service. The service would then call the binary to take a screenshot and launch an intent to open the editor with the screenshot. However, as far as I know a service cannot catch key presses. Besides, the service has to be bound somewhere in order to know when it has to take a screenshot, so I guess that I should modify Android itself to start the service and bind to it at startup, but the documentation regarding Android source code is lacking and I have no clue where to start looking.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what component of Android is in charge of the key presses, and where I should bind my service? Is my approach even possible at all?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any possible help.</p>

<p>The script can be accessed from <a href=""http://elasticmapreduce.s3.amazonaws.com/samples/spark/0.8.1/install-spark-shark.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> internet direction.</p>

<p>In order to upload the .jar application to the cluster, I have created a step configuration as follows:</p>

<pre><code> HadoopJarStepConfig customConfig = new HadoopJarStepConfig()
                 .withJar(""s3://mybucket/SparkApp.jar"")
                 .withMainClass(""SparkApp.java"");

 StepConfig customJarStep = new StepConfig()
                 .withName(""Run custom jar"")                                                                                    
                 .withActionOnFailure(ActionOnFailure.CONTINUE)
                 .withHadoopJarStep(customConfig);
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, the following code shows the actual Spark application extracted from the wordcount example provided by the Spark team (For the 0.8.1 version). As you may notice, the code imports different spark libraries to be able to run the application. The libraries are: </p>

Everything works fine, but I recently switched to the support.v4 package, to make use of the ViewPager class to swipe between tabs. Swiping and all the other classes that now use the support.v4.Fragment work fine, but my ListFragment has stopped working.</p>

<p>There are no exceptions thrown, but the ListFragment simply doesn't show any items. </p>

<p>Just FYI: The TextView's in the layout file are shown, but the list itself is just missing. Not even the TextView for an empty list is shown.</p>

<p>Hope you can help.</p>

<p>EDIT: I have checked for the <code>ExpandableListView</code>'s width and height via their corresponding methods and both return a value of 0. Its <code>getCount()</code> method returns 347. So the View definitely exists and is filled properly, but it is for some weird reason just not drawn to the screen.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Ok I fixed the problem. The problem was that the <code>LinearLayout</code> that hosted the <code>TextViews</code> on top of the actual list had its <code>layout_height</code> attribute set to <code>fill_parent</code>, which strangely was no issue for the non-support version as well as the composer in eclipse, since they both worked that way and I didn't even notice that it was set to <code>fill_parent</code>.</p>

<p><strong>The explanation:</strong> We have a project specifically built to access our Oracle database. This is all pretty much legacy code and the database isn't exactly set up ORM friendly. We are trying to make any new tables and additions use Eclipselink though. The problem I am having is that this entire project was setup to pass around the connection object. So I won't have the url, username, or password for accessing the database with an EntityManagerFactory.</p>

<p>I have tried pulling the information from the connection with the metadata and all I can get seems to be the url and the user name. The password seems to not be there, I am assuming for security reasons.</p>

<p>It seems like the EntityManagerFactory and Connection are very similar objects so I was hoping to find a simple way to convert it but have only found the EM to Connection, not the Connection to EM(or EMF) and so I come seeking help, or at least a definitive no, it is not possible. Thanks!</p>

I can't get the example you give transposed.. so i'll give a different example of what i'm trying to do.  I'm trying to go against a list(of JobS).  Jobs has instances of Job in it and Job has properties of Duties and Class in it.  So i'd like a linq statement with that in mind.   And if you know how to do it in vb... well i couldn't hardly ask for more.
Thanks

I'm trying to install RapidSMS, and it should be as easy as ""pip install rapidsms"" and it does start the process, but it doesn't complete and I'm left with the below error message. </p>

<p>I've been trying to google it, but I haven't been able to find this specific problem, for the error I find fixes for people who have written the code themselves, and I haven't seen anyone mention this problem about rapidsms themselves. Since it stops in Django-tables, I wonder if I messed up that installation somehow or if there's a problem with the python version compatibility. I've used pip when installing some other software, so I don't <em>think</em> that's the problem.</p>

<p>So if anyone's encountered this error when installing pyhton packages or really have any idea what the cause might be I'd really appreciate it! (I also plan to post this in the RapidSMS mailing list when I get approved, but wanted to see if this was a more general problem that might have a fix.)</p>

<p>The left hand main area should scroll in the y direction as per any normal page.</p>

<p>The top menu bar should scroll with the main content.</p>

<p>But the region on the right hand area needs to have a fixed background that scales and covers this entire region (using CSS cover property), and is fixed - so it doesnt scroll, always covers this area, and is always visible.</p>

<p>I can do parts of this but not everything at the same time!</p>

<p>Ignoring top bar, this code works for everything except the position of the rhs background. The backgrounds are in place and are fixed, and the rhs background scales and covers, but it is not in the correct position within the block:</p>

I have found some great solutions on this, but am missing one piece of the puzzle. I want to be able to automatically apply a custom AuthorizationAttribute to API nonsafe methods (POST, PUT etc). I hope someone can help.</p>

<p>On the MVC side, I am using the MVC AntiForgeryToken in conjunction with <a href=""http://haacked.com/archive/2011/04/24/conditional-filters.aspx/"" rel=""nofollow"">Phil Haacked's ConditionalFilterProvider</a>, configured to apply the ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute to all POST methods. The technique is explained in <a href=""http://kylehodgson.com/2013/01/08/asp-netmvc-web-security-basics-csrf/"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a>. The code for the ConditionalFilterProvider is listed below:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Web.Mvc;

public class ConditionalFilterProvider : IFilterProvider
{
    private readonly
      IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;ControllerContext, ActionDescriptor, object&gt;&gt; _conditions;

    public ConditionalFilterProvider(
      IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;ControllerContext, ActionDescriptor, object&gt;&gt; conditions)
    {
        _conditions = conditions;
    }

    public IEnumerable&lt;Filter&gt; GetFilters(
        ControllerContext controllerContext,
        ActionDescriptor actionDescriptor)
    {
        return from condition in _conditions
               select condition(controllerContext, actionDescriptor) into filter
               where filter != null
               select new Filter(filter, FilterScope.Global, null);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For WebAPI, I'm using <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.%24http"" rel=""nofollow"">AngularJS's CSRF protection mechanism</a>, packaged it up with some helper classes for easy implementation on the server, and I'm decorating the API methods with a custom AuthorizeAttribute, as described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15574486/angular-against-asp-net-webapi-implement-csrf-on-the-server"">here</a>.</p>

<p>All this works as intended, but I'd like to go one step further. Following the pattern used for the MVC controllers, I want to create a ConditionalFilterProvider that can be used with WebAPI controllers so that I can ensure that all POST methods are automatically decorated with my custom AuthorizeAttribute.</p>

<p>However, though I've had a stab at creating a ConditionalFilterProvider for WebAPI, I'm not sure I have it right, and can't test it as I don't know how to register it. What I've come up with is:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Web.Http;

public class ConditionalApiFilterProvider : IFilterProvider
{
    private readonly
      IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;HttpConfiguration, HttpActionDescriptor, object&gt;&gt; _conditions;

    public ConditionalApiFilterProvider(
      IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;HttpConfiguration, HttpActionDescriptor, object&gt;&gt; conditions)
    {
        _conditions = conditions;
    }

    public IEnumerable&lt;FilterInfo&gt; GetFilters(
        HttpConfiguration configuration,
        HttpActionDescriptor actionDescriptor)
    {
        return from condition in _conditions
               select condition(configuration, actionDescriptor) into filter
               where filter != null
               select new FilterInfo(filter as IFilter, FilterScope.Action);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And to register it in Application_Start (this doesn't work):</p>

<pre><code>    private void ConfigureValidateCsrfHeaderAttribute()
    {
        //Configure a conditional filter
        string[] nonSafeMethods = { ""post"", ""put"", ""delete"" };
        IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;HttpConfiguration, HttpActionDescriptor, object&gt;&gt; conditions =
            new Func&lt;HttpConfiguration, HttpActionDescriptor, object&gt;[] {
                    ( c, a ) =&gt; nonSafeMethods.Contains(""need HTTP method here"") ?
                    new ValidateCsrfHeaderAttribute() : null
            };

        var provider = new ConditionalApiFilterProvider(conditions);

        // This line adds the filter we created above
        FilterProviders.Providers.Add(provider);        //incorrect provider registration

Can this be achieved with a not() selector as seen in this post? <strong>The predicament appears to be that since the certain div is within a body element, the mouse will always be hovering over the body element even when it's over the certain div, thus the body will always have a red background-color.</strong></p>

<p>I am trying to use the not() selector to affect elements when hovering over elements that are not within my selection.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>    [data-panel] { background-color:white; }

    :not([data-panel=visible]):hover { background-color:red; }</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div data-panel='visible'&gt;
    &lt;div data-panel='visible'&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>My desired outcome is that if the mouse is hovering anywhere besides those <code>div</code>s, the background-color will change to red (i.e. hovering in the body).</p>

<p>However, since those <code>div</code>s are within the body, that selector will always be active. The body will always be red. Is there anyway to style those <code>div</code>s so that this doesn't happen? Maybe something with <code>z-index</code>? Any clues?</p>

Currently, we just add the two repo references n the git/config file of the repositoy, both as the remote origin. So, when we push changes, they go to both repos. We started doing this as a redundancy policy.</p>

<p>However, we started using the pull requests. The main objective behind this is: a inexperienced dev forked the main repo, made changes, tested them, pulled them to their repos and then pull-requested them to the main repo. A more experienced developer would review these changes and merge or not into the main repo. However, in a first test, this caused the repos to go out of sync.</p>

<p>Is there any way to keep them synced? I also would appreciate protips for a better approach or better practices.</p>

I have a special form that allows my customers to request a quote for a specific product (defined by PID in url) The form is loaded inside a modal dialogue and within that a Iframe. The Iframe's src value is set from the onclick event of ahref on the product pages eg;</p>

<p>The form that I am loading does a SQL insert when Page_Load is fired. Also it is within 
    If Page.IsPostBack = False Then</p>

<p>For some strange reason the page is doing it twice when the page loads and another time when the page is closed.. I need the SQL insert on the first page load as the returned values are used by my form. Can anyone suggest a good way of making the code within Page_Load only fire up once?</p>

The NameCollection is already loaded with the data on the ASP.NET page load event, so while I'm not sure what's going on in the background with server-side tags, I assumed the data should exist in that object statically the way it was at the last call to the server, but that the <em>snapshot</em> of that data physically existed on the client-side (it would have to to avoid post-backs, right?)? Thus, I should be able to avoid having to talk to the server here since I am only accessing data that should already be on the client side? Correct me (nicely please) if I am wrong, since I'm not an expert on JavaScript or web programming in general and I have been able to find very few decent references on server-side tags.</p>

<pre><code>$('#&lt;%= txtIDNumber.ClientID %&gt;').change(function(){
    var idnumber = $('#&lt;%= txtIDNumber.ClientID %&gt;').val();
    var lblName = $('#&lt;%= lblName.ClientID %&gt;');
    var tempJSKey = '';
    var tempJSValue = '&lt;span class=""error""&gt;Not a Member&lt;/span&gt;';

    &lt;%If Not NameCollection Is Nothing Then%&gt;
        &lt;%For Each kvp As System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair(Of String, String) In NameCollection %&gt;
            tempJSKey = '&lt;%=kvp.Key %&gt;';
            if (tempJSKey == idnumber)
            {
                tempJSValue = '&lt;%=kvp.Value%&gt;';
            }
        &lt;%Next%&gt;
    &lt;%End If%&gt;
    lblName.html(tempJSValue);
});

<p>Gives an error that Lazarus doesn't support 64-bit:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/hPvCM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Reading the somewhat dated <a href=""http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Cross_compiling#From_win32_to_win64"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Cross compiling Wiki page</strong></a> gives the instructions on how to make the 64-bit Lazarus work on 64-bit machines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>From win32 to win64</h2>
  
  <p>If you are compiling the 2.1.1 or greater branch of fpc you can just do:</p>

<pre><code>$ make all OS_TARGET=win64 CPU_TARGET=x86_64
</code></pre>
  
  <p>and then</p>

<pre><code>$ make crossinstall OS_TARGET=win64 CPU_TARGET=x86_64
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>which, if you follow, just gives a few thousand errors:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fzaX0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The common suggestion is to abandon the Lazarus IDE, <a href=""http://www.gotwavs.com/0038067694/MP3S/Movies/Airplane/ap12.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">altogether</a>, and use a fork known as <a href=""http://www.pilotlogic.com/sitejoom/index.php/codetyphon"" rel=""nofollow"">CodeTyphoon</a>. Downloading that 500 MB, and installing it, i couldn't find an IDE anywhere:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SHG5Y.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Which is confusing, because i <em>thought</em> CodeTyphoon was a Pascal Visual Programming Environment.</p>

<h1>Before i go on</h1>

<p>Before i go randomly stumbling around, downloading gigabytes of stuff, let me just ask straight out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can Lazarus 64-bit for Windows compile to 64-bit for Windows?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a 64-bit Lazarus for Windows, that can create 64-bit Windows binaries? Am i missing something, or is that functionality not in there yet?</p>

<p>And if the ability is in there, at least could someone commiserate that my confusion is understandable?</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>If I have SSH supported by <em>provider</em> on the server side, does it mean that I have SOCKS5 too? </p>

<p>What else is needed for me to set-up my secure tunnel to find way out using my existing web server account?</p>

<pre><code>A, Hello, my name is John, how are you?
B, Hello John, I'm doing well, thanks!

<p>Right now, the CSV shows four values for the first and second entry since they are both delimited by commas. My goal is to have the CSV show two values for each entry like so: </p>

<pre><code>A, Hello my name is John how are you?
B, Hello John I'm doing well thanks!

fout = open ('newExample.csv', 'w')

<p>However on the client side, the browser doesn't redirect and if I look in the response object in the complete function I see what would normally be return from my '/' route: 200 OK and the index.html template.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>Is there some way I can intercept make the client redirect?</p>

<p>I assume the issue is because jquery is initiating the request and not the browser.</p>

<p>My first attempt at solving this problem was to construct the response myself using <code>make_response</code> and set the Location header but this resulted in the same behaviour. My current solution is to return 200 and then the client does <code>window.location = ""/""</code>, but this seems hacky</p>

<p>PS : I know I can use DISTINCT and get rid of duplicates, but it is slowing down the query a lot so I need to rework the query for which I  need to identify the duplicates, the resultant records are greater than 200,000 so exporting them to excel and filtering duplicates is not an option either (I tried but excel can't handle it)</p>

&lt;MyObject: 0x1006ec480&gt;
(lldb) po [NSBundle bundleForClass:[myObject class]]
NSBundle &lt;/Users/paynerc/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/xxxx/Build/Products/Debug/MyTests Tests.xctest&gt; (loaded)
(lldb) po [[NSBundle bundleForClass:[myObject class]] bundleIdentifier]
com.paynerc.MyBundle
</code></pre>

<p>However, after I pass <code>myObject</code> into <code>[OCMockObject partialMockForObject:myObject]</code>, things change:</p>

<pre><code>(lldb) po myObject
&lt;MyObject-0x1006ec480-401894396.880136: 0x1006ec480&gt;
(lldb) po [NSBundle bundleForClass:[myObject class]]
NSBundle &lt;/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin&gt; (loaded)
(lldb) po [[NSBundle bundleForClass:[myObject class]] bundleIdentifier]
nil
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that the object is modified and includes the partial mock magic makes sense. What doesn't seem to make sense is why the call to <code>bundleForClass</code> has changed what it returns.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to ensure that <code>bundleForClass</code> continues to return the original value, short of mocking the calls inside MyObject? The concern there is that anybody else that needs a partial mock of MyObject in another unit test will need to remember to provided a stubbed implementation of <code>bundleForClass</code>.</p>

<p>My present solution is to request the bundle identifier and examine the result. If it is nil, I am calling <code>[NSBundle allBundles]</code> and iterating over them until I find one that has a non-nil bundleIdentifier. While that currently... <em>works</em>... it's A) not very robust B) horribly brute force-ish and C) modifying application code to support unit tests.</p>

<p>Has anybody else come across this and come up with a better solution?</p>

<p>If I want my whole page content to be inside a centered column, with - lets say - 800px width, the usual way of doing that would be this (at least, this is the way I always did it):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;style&gt;
            body {
                text-align: center; /* IE6 */
            }

            #wrapper {
                margin: 0px auto;
                width: 800px;
                background-color: #eee; /* to see it better */
                text-align: left; /* IE6 */
            }
        &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=""wrapper""&gt;
            ... content ...
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, there is another method to do exactly the same thing, but with <code>margin: -50%;</code> (or a fixed value, in this case <code>margin: 400px;</code>), like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;style&gt;
            body {
                margin-left: 50%;
            }

            #wrapper {
                margin-left: -400px;
                width: 800px;
                background-color: #eee; /* to see it better */
            }
        &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=""wrapper""&gt;
            ... content ...
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My question is - does one of this two methods have any advantages over the other? Or disadvantages? Is there a common 'best solution' for centering a main column?</p>

I want to know how best to dispose of the SqlConnection and SqlCommand when the task completes.  Lets say I have these two objects:</p>

<pre><code>SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(base._ConnectionString);
SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(""SomeProcedure"", connection);
</code></pre>

<p>I am considering two different ways of handling this.</p>

<p>The first is to use a continuation to clean everything up.</p>

<pre><code>return Task.Factory
    .FromAsync&lt;int&gt;(
        beginMethod: command.BeginExecuteNonQuery,
        endMethod: command.EndExecuteNonQuery,
        state: null)
    .ContinueWith(a =&gt;
        {
            if (command != null)
            {
                command.Dispose();
            }
            if (connection != null)
            {
                connection.Dispose();
            }
            // Need to propagate the exception too if one occurred.
            a.Wait();
        });
</code></pre>

<p>My concern here is that I think this spins up another thread just to handle the continuation?  The whole reason I used the FromAsync method was to try and avoid doing that.  Also, as you can see in this example, I am a little unsure how exactly to best make sure any exceptions get back to the caller.  I am trying this trick with the wait to force the continuation task to rethrow the exception but it does not feel quite right.</p>

<p>The second approach I am looking at uses a lambda for the 'endMethod' argument:</p>

<pre><code>return Task.Factory
    .FromAsync&lt;int&gt;(
        beginMethod: command.BeginExecuteNonQuery,
        endMethod: (asyncResult =&gt;
            {
                int test = command.EndExecuteNonQuery(asyncResult);
                command.Dispose();
                connection.Dispose();
                return test;
            }),
        state: null);
</code></pre>

<p>On the surface this seems like a nicer approach although I have no idea why it feels that way.  I also feel like this would not spin up a second thread but I am not entirely sure about that.  Also, in this case I have absolutely no idea how to propagate an exception to the caller were one to occur.  Actually, I am not even sure how to identify if an exception has occurred.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>So basically before doing the insert the existent columns need to be checked and supplemented with the new columns if needed.</p>

I am using deferred objects to keep track of several asynchronous requests, and all are working except for the AJAX function shown below. The other two are non-AJAX. <strong>Likely problem areas in the code below are marked with</strong> <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>For context, I am writing the backend to a one-page animation in the browser. The template remains the same regardless of any requests (clicks) from the viewer or any data requests the animation makes on its own programmatically (periodic adding and subtracting of visual material). </p>

<p><strong>Flask/Python:</strong></p>

<pre><code>from flask import Response, json, render_template
from app import app
from motifs import get_motif_list

# &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can/should I use two functions aimed at the same route? Not sure how to both render the template and pass data
@app.route('/')
def index():
    motifs = get_motif_list(10)
    return Response(json.dumps(motifs), mimetype='application/json')

@app.route(""/"")
def index():
     return render_template(""index.html"")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>function getData() {

    var deferredData = new jQuery.Deferred();

    $.ajax({
        type: ""GET"",
        url: ""/"",
        dataType: ""json"", // &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when I comment this out I get an error, when I leave it in I get a parsererror
        success: deferredData.resolve(),
        complete: function(xhr, textStatus) {
            console.log(""AJAX REquest complete -&gt; "", xhr, "" -&gt; "", textStatus);
            }
    });

    return deferredData; // contains the passed data &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; currently undefined!!!
};


// DEFERRED OBJECTS
// used to perform a callback after multiple asynchronous functions
var deferredData = getData();
var deferredWindow = windowLoaded();
var deferredImages = loadImages();


// SINGLE CALLBACK AFTER MULTIPLE ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTIONS
$.when( deferredWindow, deferredData, deferredImages  ).done( function( window, data, images ) {
    console.log(""The window has loaded - "" + window); // successful!
    console.log(""The data are: "" + data); // &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; undefined!
    console.log(""The images are: "" + images); // successful!    
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to @Jason P the success function in the <code>getData</code> AJAX call is now <code>success: function(data) { deferredData.resolve(data); }</code> and the result is no longer <code>undefined</code>! Alas, it's not my data, either. I think I may have a bug (or a conceptual misunderstanding) in my Flask code because the request returns the complete text of my html template instead of my JSON data. Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>Also @Jason P's suggestion I changed the route url in Flask and the AJAX request to an alternate route: <code>/ajax</code> to avoid a potential(?!) clash with the template rendering. However, the request still returns the full text of my html template. Perhaps I also need to differentiate the python/flask function names? ...will try that next. <em>Updated code below.</em></p>

<p>Python/Flask:</p>

<pre><code>@app.route('/ajax')
def index():
    motifs = get_motif_list(10)
    return Response(json.dumps(motifs), mimetype='application/json')

@app.route(""/"")
def index():
     return render_template(""index.html"")
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript AJAX url property changed to:
<code>url: '/ajax'</code></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong></p>

<p>I differentiated the python/flask function names so that the <code>/ajax</code> route function is now called <code>ajax()</code>, and the root route <code>'/'</code> function is still called <code>index()</code>. The JSON object now renders to the screen (instead of being passed in as a variable) and nothing from the javascript renders (presumably now missing the template rendering?)</p>

<p><strong>RESOLVED</strong></p>

<p>Following on comments by @Jason P the call is finally resolved and functioning. Wheew! Here is the final code:</p>

<p>Flask/Python</p>

<pre><code>from flask import Response, json, render_template
from app import app
from motifs import get_motif_list

@app.route('/ajax')
def ajax():
    motifs = get_motif_list(10)
    return Response(json.dumps(motifs), mimetype='application/json')

@app.route(""/"")
def index():
     return render_template(""index.html"")
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>function getData() {

    var deferredData = new jQuery.Deferred();

    $.ajax({
        type: ""GET"",
        url: ""/ajax"",
        // dataType: ""json"",
        success: function(data) { 
            deferredData.resolve(data);
            },
        error: function (data) {
            debugger;
            alert(""Error"");
            },
        complete: function(xhr, textStatus) {
            console.log(""AJAX Request complete -&gt; "", xhr, "" -&gt; "", textStatus);
            }
    });

    return deferredData; // contains the passed data
};

// all else in the script remains the same as above...

<pre><code>file = ""data.dat""

set terminal epslatex
set output ""figure1.tex""

plot file
</code></pre>

<p>This way, two files are generated: one <code>.eps</code> file, which contains the graphics, and one <code>.tex</code> file, which contains the text. The great advantage of this is that text <strong>is rendered by LaTeX</strong>, so the tics, labels, etc. have the same font as the rest of the document. </p>

<p>Now I am starting with matplotlib, which has a much nicer API, is more scriptable and, well, is Python. But, even though I can make matplotlib render the text with LaTeX, <em>it gets embedded into the image</em> and I cannot achieve the same advantages I had with gnuplot. </p>

<p>Looking at the lines of the errors is not particularly illuminating. Since this error doesn't occur unless --cookie is used, I'm presuming it's trying incorrectly to parse the cookie parameter.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that I am using Neo4django, which I believe precludes me from being able to use API Key Authentication. The code for my user is as such:</p>

            url(r""^(?P&lt;resource_name&gt;%s)/logout%s$"" % params, self.wrap_view('logout'), name=""api_logout"")

        data = self.deserialize(request, request.raw_post_data, format=request.META.get('CONTENT_TYPE', 'application/json'))

        username = data.get('username', '')
        password = data.get('password', '')

        if username == '' or password == '':
            return self.create_response(request, {
                'success': False,
                'error_message': 'Missing username or password'
            })

        user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)

        if user:
            if user.is_active:
                login(request, user)
                response = self.create_response(request, {

<p>So, in summary, the main questions/points of confusion for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Which data must be sent via the curl request to send an authenticated GET/POST/etc.?</li>
<li>Is the Authentication value correct for the User Resource?</li>
<li>Am I supposed to be able to authenticate with only the CSRF token, or is the session ID also necessary?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance for any insight on this!</p>

<p>EDIT:
Here is the custom user model we have.</p>

That way my form doesn't lock up while tasks are being processed.</p>

<p>Semi-recently, after going through a repeated process a number of times (the program processes incoming data, so when data comes in, the process repeats) my app will crash with a System.OutOfMemory error.</p>

<p>The stack trace in the error message is useless because it only directs me to the the line where I call the delegated form control function.</p>

<p>I've heard people say they use ProcMon from SysInternals to see why errors like this happen. But I, for the life of me, can't figure it out. The amount of memory I am using doesn't change as the program runs, if it goes up, it comes back down. Plus, even if it was going up, how do I figure out which part of my program is the problem?</p>

<p>How can I go about investigating this problem?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>So, after delving further into this issue, I looked through anything that I was ever re-declaring. There were a few instances where I had hugematrix = new uint[gigantic], so I got rid of about 3 of those.</p>

<p>Instead of getting rid of the error, it is now far more obscured and confusing.</p>

<p>My application takes the incoming data, and renders it using OpenGL. Now, instead of throwing ""System.OutOfMemory"" it simply does not render anything with OpenGL.</p>

<p>The only difference in my code is that I do not make new matrices for holding the data I plot. That way, I hope, my array stays in the same place in memory and doesn't do anything suicidal to my LOH.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this twists the beast far beyond my meager means. With zero errors popping up, and all my data structures apparently still properly filled, how can I find my problem? Does OpenGL use memory in an obscure way so as to not throw exceptions when it fails? Is memory still a problem? How do I find out? All the memory profilers in the world seem to tell me very little.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>With the boatloads of support from this community (with extra kudos to Amissico) the error has finally been rooted out. Apparently I was adding items to an OpenGL list, and never taking them off the list.</p>

<p>The app that finally clued me in was .Net Memory Profiler. At the time of crash it showed 1.5GB of data in the <code>&lt;unknown&gt;</code> category. Through process of elimination (everything else in the list that was named), the last thing to be checked off the list was the OpenGL rendering pipleline. The rest is history.</p>

<p>I am currently solving a list of math problems in Java. I create a new class called ProblemX for every problem. I want each class to print the duration time of the execution.
Rather than programming this in each seperate class I though I'd use some inheritance but that's where I got stuck.</p>

<pre><code>Public abstract class Problem{

 public static void main(String[]args){
   Problem p = new Problem();
   long startTime = System.nanoTime();
   p.solve();
   long endTime = System.nanoTime();
   System.out.println(""Execution time: "" + (endTime - startTime) + "" nanoseconds"");
 }

abstract void solve();

}

<p>This doesn't work because I can't create an instance of Problem in an abstract class.
I can't use a Solveable interface because then Problem has to define 'solve'.</p>

<p>Initially a couple of waiters are created and then tables are created. There are many more tables than waiters so tables have to ""wait"" for waiters to serve them. I am supposed to use ""java synchronization primitives, wait notify, and notifall"" to solve this problem. Here are the guidelines for each class:</p>

<p>Table:
When it is started, it enters the queue and then calls an internal method waitService() which returns if it has been serviced or waits for a waiter.</p>

<p>the way I have this method right now:</p>

<pre><code>$if(serviced)
        return 0;
    try {
        this.wait();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Waiter:
The waiter code is not really giving me any issues but essentially the way it works is that in the run method there is an infinite loop that checks if there is a table waiting and then gives that table service for a random amount of time after which it checks if another table is waiting. It lets the table know it is giving it service by calling giveService() method inside the table class.</p>

<p>Queue:
It has a list of waiters and a list of tables. The waiter calls nextTable() in the queue class when it is ready to give service. this is how I have it set up:</p>

<pre><code>$public Table nextTable(Waiter w) throws InterruptedException {

    if(closed)
        return null;
    if(tables.isEmpty()) {
        w.wait();
    }
    Table t =  tables.removeFirst();
    t.notify();
    return t;   
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know the above may have some very fundamental mistakes but essentially I have no clue how synchronization primitives work in java. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for the kind notice @ctheo :)<br>
Yes I did have a look at <code>autotools</code> and understood that shall satisfy all my needs. However what I'm dealing with is an existing project and its <code>Makefile</code> contains other directives dealing with codes in <code>C++</code>, and I think for now I'd better just modify a few lines instead of port the whole <code>Makefile</code> to <code>autotools</code>, unless I couldn't find a satisfying solution without introducing <code>autotools</code>. :)</p>

Why?
because I have a friend whose adsense account was banned because of invalid clicks.
What i'm wanting to do is have it record the IP and once an ad is clicked, all the ads will disappear for about 5 days before appearing again, meaning that they cant continuously click the ads, which results in the adsence account banned.</p>

<p>What I have done to test is this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
function mouseDown() {
    alert(""Yes"");
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p id=""myP"" onmousedown=""mouseDown()""&gt;
Does this work?
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works for when someone clicks the text, and shows the message ""Yes"". But when I put a ad inside</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""myAds"" onmousedown=""mouseDown()""&gt;
&lt;script async src=""//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;ins class=""adsbygoogle""
     style=""display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px""
     data-ad-client=""ca-pub-2948xxxxxxxxx2""
     data-ad-slot=""6735xxxx36""&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work, all it does is go strait to the ad without any alert</p>

<p>can someone help with this issue, or any other work around?</p>

<p>The multiplayer works with UDP, and I have a concern regarding receive speed.</p>

<p>Here's the current receive code:</p>

<pre><code>    void Receive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Started"");
        while (true)
        {
            byte[] msg = new byte[1024];
            client.Receive(msg);
            string message = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(msg);
            if (...) ...
            if (...) ...
            if (...) ...
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And so on with a few checks (right after a packet is received these checks are being done).</p>

<p>So my question is - while it's decent for a Console Application, what about handling hundreds or thousands of clients?</p>

<p>When handling a big number of clients, the receive and respond speed is very important.</p>

<p>And these checks, of course, slow down the receive process.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make the receive process faster, so the server will be able to handle even hundreds of clients concurrently?</p>

Some of you may be familiar with the multi-vendor plugin (the free one, WC Vendors).
I hope to address exactly these people.</p>

<p>When adding products, my theme gives me this ""Sold by"" #vendor-name# thing, which is kind of useful. However I want to edit the displayed text.
Since I haven't exactly had the time yet to work myself through each and every folder of my WP-installation, I figured asking here would be quicker while I continue to look for the line of code in the background.</p>

<p>I'm unsure if it's related to my theme, the WC Vendors plugin or WooCommerce itself (probably the plugin I imagine).</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class A, class B&gt;
void foo(A&amp; a, B&amp; b)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""generic fallback"" &lt;&lt; endl;
}

template &lt;class A&gt;
void foo(A&amp; a, int &amp;i)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""generic int"" &lt;&lt; endl;
}

template &lt;class A&gt;
void foo(A&amp; a, string&amp; s)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""generic str"" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to create an overload which will get called whenever <code>A</code> is an instance of a particular struct[1]. The best I came up with so far was:</p>

<pre><code>struct mine
{
    int is_special;
};

template &lt;class A, class B&gt;
auto foo(A&amp; a, B&amp; b) -&gt; decltype(A::is_special, void())
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""specialized fallback"" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result I want is:</p>

<pre><code>int x;
string y;
float z;
string generic;
mine special;

foo(generic, x); // generic int
foo(generic, y); // generic string
foo(generic, z); // generic fallback
foo(special, x); // specialized fallback
foo(special, y); // specialized fallback
foo(special, z); // specialized fallback
</code></pre>

<p>The above code doesn't work, however, because for the specialized cases, there is an ambiguous overload. Is there any easy way to cause those functions to only get created if <code>A::is_special</code> is not a valid type? Ideally I would annotate each function with something like:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class A, class B&gt;
auto foo(A&amp; a, B&amp; b) -&gt; decltype(doesnt_work(A::is_special), void())
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>I ask also in the more general case: given any ""positive"" SFINAE test which results in a function or class getting created as a result of the test, is there any way to negate that test specifically for use in other cases? In essence, the equivalent of <code>if ... else if</code> with SFINAE.</p>

<p>I did get this case to work, but I had to rename all <code>foo</code> to <code>foo_imp</code>, add a <code>long</code> parameter to the generic ones, an <code>int</code> parameter to the specialized one, and then define a <code>foo</code> that called them (ideone code <a href=""https://ideone.com/ds5So4"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). This seems less-than-ideal in that it's not as straightforward, although either way I have to modify all the existing <code>foo</code>s anyway.</p>

<hr>

<p>[1] Note that I can't use the type's name because it is a nested template and would thus result in a non-deducible context.</p>

With Xcode 3.2.2 and earlier versions all worked just fine, but in 3.2.3 apple seems to have introduced changes in how to handle target settings.
In 3.2.2 I just could choose ""base-sdk"" from drop-down menu and set up a target for each, iPhone simulator, iPhone device and Mac and xcode would always automatically build for the correct platform and architecture for that target.
Now, with xcode 3.2.3 and later you can't choose this option any more.
Switching between targets for simulator or device does not have influence on the platform, you build for, anymore. You always have to choose the platform separately and then all targets are build for that platform.
This issue is already described for simulator vs device here:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3160787/targeting-multiple-platforms-in-iphone-sdk-4"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3160787/targeting-multiple-platforms-in-iphone-sdk-4</a>
For iPhone only projects I could live with it and just only have one target and choose the platform separately from the target.</p>

<p>The real issue with that change is with having an iPhone and a mac target in the project:
if the mac target is chosen, you do not have the option anymore, to switch between device and simulator, but they still affect the mac target.
If the platform has been set to device prior to switching active target from iPhone to mac, than xcode does not find the CoreServices for the mac target, because it is searching in iPhone device frameworks, where this isn't existing. Xcode even builds for arm in this case, also the target settings clearly tell it to build for i386.
If switching back to iPhone target an setting the platform to simulator and then switching back again to mac target, CoreServices framework is found, but the simulator one is used, not the os x one, which leads into the issue of dozens of ""error: expected declaration specifiers or '...' before 'CFXMLTreeRef'"" errors in the iphone simulator core services framework, where this is not defined, although I do of course want to use the mac version of the framework for mac target.</p>

<p>As I already mentioned, this was all working fine before Xcode version 3.2.3. Projects only for iPhone or only for mac are still building fine.</p>

<p>Any ideas, how I can get projects with static libs targets for iPhone and for mac, to build with Xcode 3.2.3 and later versions?</p>

How could I get that message?
If i do loadStrings(""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"">http://stackoverflow.com</a>"") for instance, I got all HTML as strings, that would be good enough for me, but with the error 500 in the url above I got an error and don't reach the HTML, but the browser does...

I like the visual approach to sketching out the flow of an app, but IMHO, it does not really force component reuse, or maybe I do not know how to do it.</p>

<p>I have an actual problem, which is the following: Instead of the typical master-detail approach, I have a situation, in which clicking on a TableView cell forces a push to another TableView, which looks the same and behaves the same way. There are two specific types of a TableViewCell that I want to reuse across the whole application, so I can't just duplicate the first TableViewController several times. I need changes in one type of TableViewCell to be affected everywhere, same for the look and behaviour of the Tableview. Sort of like reusing a component, you get the picture I hope.</p>

<p>I tried creating a custom TableView and TableViewCell in a separate xib file, connecting it to a custom controller class. Yet, when I want to reuse that controller class in the storyboard, I can't make a segue from the cell to the next one, because only view controllers are displayed, but no views inside.</p>

<p>Maybe, I am doing it all wrong. Perhaps, I should make a single controller, and force it to seque to itself if possible, no idea.</p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

<p>I have got a WindowsForm named GUI with an listbox item (it not have to be a listbox)</p>

<p>What I want to realize is having a box in the GUI an send from every classes in my project text to that box.</p>

<p>Example:
in Programm.cs I want simply write something like this GUI.WriteToLog(""Hello World"");
and it should appear in that box.</p>

<p>This GUI.WriteToLog should work in every class.</p>

<p>I tried to write a static function WriteToLog in the GUI class but if its static I cant use the listBox1 in that function.</p>

<pre><code>    public partial class GUI : Form
{
        public void WriteToLog(string msg)
    {


        listBox1.Items.Add(msg);

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here the class that should access the box:</p>

<pre><code>    class FileManager
{

        internal static void RenameFiles(string filePath)
    {
        GUI g = new GUI();
        g.WriteToLog(""Moving Files"");
        try {
            File.Move(filePath, filePath + "".RDY"");
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            string message = e.ToString();
            string caption = ""Error"";
            MessageBox.Show(message, caption);
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>More Details what I want to do:
I have to access the ListBox from all of my classes, because it should inform about status. After some more google searches. I figured out that the best way to do this is to write an event ? I this right ? How du I do this ? Example what I want: GUI with the ListBox ... I'm in class ""FileManager"" Function ""RenameFile"" there I want write one line to the ListBox ""Hey, I'm renaming files now"" or I'm in Class ""Communicator"" in Function ""SendEmail"" so I want to add a line to the ListBox ""Hey dude, I'm sending a fabilous email"" ... </p>

<pre><code>offers.sort{|a,b|
if a.expires?
    b.expires? ? 0 : -1
else
    b.expires? ? 1 : a.expires &lt;=&gt; b.expires
end
}

NoMethodError: undefined method `expires' for #&lt;Offer:0x00000100d3faa8&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I was hoping to be able to update the class definition with something like:</p>

<pre><code>expires ||= """"
</code></pre>

<p>... but I don't know if that's possible. I don't really follow how the sorting blocks work yet, though. I know I could just loop through the offers and assign the value, but it seems grossly inefficient.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<pre><code>offers.sort{|a,b|
if defined? a.expires == nil
    (defined? b.expires == nil) ? 0 : -1
else
    (defined? b.expires == nil) ? 1 : a.expires &lt;=&gt; b.expires
end
}

The game works, except my ""floodfill"" algorithm, to clear any adjacent blank spaces. 
I have made the board, printed a previously created list, according to choices(height, width and amount of mines) chosen by the user, with labels, and hidden these labels behind buttons.</p>

<p>I can bind events to hide these buttons when clicked on, but what I also want is to be able to hide the buttons nearby, with the help of my floodfill algorithm. I feel like all I need anymore is the line of code that will hide the button according to x and y coordinates, and not just the one that's clicked upon.
I think you've got the idea,</p>

<pre><code>def initGame(field, height, width, mn):

<p>the long line of # is where I believe is all I need anymore to get this system to work, in something like ""button.position(x, y).

<p>I have a data set I am trying to run a boosted regression tree model on with code:</p>

<pre><code>pa.brt.m &lt;- gbm.step(data=data, gbm.x = 5:15, gbm.y = 2,

<p>As it goes about it's business, it returns the error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am wondering what is going on and how I can fix this? This error seems to stop the function and I don't get the rest of the output I would expect. Can anyone provide some insight into what is going on?</p>

When you roll over each logo, it should pop-up to a larger size and go back to its normal state when you roll out. In addition, when clicked, it should appear in the colorbox window… this also does not work. All of the links to the scripts and other resources appear to be correct, but for some reason, the script is not triggered on roll-over and the colorbox window also does not appear when clicked.

I am using the post data to populate the form fields so that the user does not have to enter the information again and is able to just edit the information they have already entered.  It seems that the $_POST is receiving the file information but it will change to displaying ""No file selected."" rather than the name of the file.  What is the problem here?  Below are some excerpts of my code</p>

<pre><code>//Set field values as posted data.
if ($_FILES[""Image""][""error""] &gt; 0) 
{
    echo ""Error: "" . $_FILES[""Image""][""error""] . ""&lt;br&gt;"";
} 
else
{
    echo ""Upload: "" . $_FILES[""Image""][""name""] . ""&lt;br&gt;"";
    echo ""Type: "" . $_FILES[""Image""][""type""] . ""&lt;br&gt;"";
    echo ""Size: "" . ($_FILES[""Image""][""size""] / 1024) . "" kB&lt;br&gt;"";
    echo ""Stored in: "" . $_FILES[""Image""][""tmp_name""];
}
$Name = $_POST['Name'];
$Image = $_FILES[""Image""];
</code></pre>

<p>And the form:</p>

It is specifically needed to run on 10.6.* because the VPN needs to use the Cisco IPSec protocol which is only built in to Snow Leopard. I am not sure if it is even possible, but I was thinking this could be done using terminal commands or some form of shell scripting. I really have no idea where to start though. When I looked through the system for possible start points I found that if you opened the following file with Property List Editor it had all the Network Services.</p>

<pre><code>/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if that just shows the services or if that actually does control them, thus making it have the ability to add another service through modification of that .plist file.
So basically what I am asking is: How can add a network service with specific settings through terminal or scripting?</p>

<pre><code>function loadPage(page) {
    $.ajax({
        url: ""/pages/load.php"",
        type: ""POST"",
        data: ""pagina="" + page,
        dataType: ""html"",
        succes: function(loadedPage) {
            if (loadedPage != """") {
                $(""#MainContent"").stop(true).animate({
                    'height' : 0
                }, 500).after(loadedPage);
            }
                else
            {
                loadPage('404');
            }
        },
        error: function() 
        {
            loadPage('404');
        } 
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>So its pretty basic I guess. This is the PHP code involved with this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    if (file_exists($_POST['pagina'] . '.tpl'))
    {
        include($_POST['pagina'] . '.tpl');
    }
        else
    {
        include('404.tpl');
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I've noticed is that it does nothing. It doesn't show output in the page, neither does it in the console. I've tried different PHP, with the regular <code>ob_get_contents</code> stuff, but it didn't work either.</p>

<p>I also have confirmed that my edition of jQuery works, that its included before the other JS files, all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>So how is it that this code doesn't work?</p>

Each <code>Character</code> has a list of <code>Skill</code>s, of which the skill level can be changed. Each <code>Fit</code> belongs to a <code>Character</code>, and a <code>Character</code> may own any number of fits.</p>

<p>I would like the user to be able to change the levels of the skills belonging to a <code>Character</code>, but on a temporary basis. That is, when they change it, they can close the program and lose the changes, or choose to save the changes they have done. This seems difficult to do for three reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any time the <code>Character</code> object changes (which has a list of Skill objects), it is added as a dirty object to the session. This leads into the next problem...</li>
<li>Any time other things in the program change (the <code>Fit</code> object is modified, the user creates new <code>Character</code>s, etc), the program does a flush/commit, which would include the temporary changes that were made to previous characters</li>
<li>I do not wish to <code>expunge()</code> the character from the session, because when a new fit is loaded, it will load a new Character object fresh from the database. This is unwanted as I wish to use the modified Character for all fits that are assigned to that characters, and I do not want extra Character objects floating around.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, I want the user to tweak the <code>Character</code> object without fear of having it saved with a session flush/commit from another change.</p>

<p>I have thought about using SQLalchemys <code>before_flush</code> event, but examples of using it seem to be sparse. I envision setting a property on the Character whenever it is changed, and then checking for this property before flushing.  If it has this property, remove it from the flush pool and flush/commit all other changes. I think this would be exactly what I need, however I'm not sure how to work with the events. </p>

<p>I'm passing the location to for loop to get the latitude and longitude to plot the markers in map. i'm using the following function</p>

<pre><code>var markers = {};

function initial_markers(locations){
     for(var i=0;i&lt;locations.length;i++){
        (function(address,attr_title,i,attr_id,cat_id) {

            }, function(results) {
                var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
                   map: map,
                   position: results[0].geometry.location,

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Totally 12 locations in that data. I get the 12 values before the function enters to geocode function. after the geocode it fails for the last element. and the order of i also changed. but its not problem for me. My problem is unable to get the latitude and longitude for the last location. and also unable to get the index. i'm using this index value for some other functions. The index value is stops in 10.  Please help to resolve this problem </p>

<p>This leaves me with two options:</p>

<p>1) Deploy the portable application with an installer.</p>

<p>2) Package the C++ dependencies within the same folder or use private assemblies.</p>

<p>Both 1 and 2 defeat the idea of portable software, so I was thinking of a third option:</p>

<p>3) Use IExpress to drop the C++ dependencies before launching the application. On exit, delete the C++ dependencies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, option 3 has received some flak from some stackoverflow members. They even dislike option 2 which leaves me with only option 1. I can see option 1 as doable if I use a portable installer.</p>

<p>Is there such thing as a portable installer? Essentially, I want the installer to check to see if the needed dependencies are installed before running my application (just like a regular installer would) and if they are, then just continue running my application. Otherwise, give a message box to the user that they could download it providing a link to the URL. I am aware I can write my own installer that can do this in C++ but I was wondering if there are any installers that already offer this specific functionality.</p>

The two classes I've looked at are UIScrollView and UITextView. UIScrollView is easy to scroll with, but I'm not sure how to add all the formatted text that I need without manually creating each label, formatting it, and adding it to the view in the right place. I created a UITextView (non-editable, non-selectable) with attributed text, which gave me what I needed, but then I was unable to get it to scroll past the boundaries of the window (i.e. I couldn't scroll beyond the bottom border of the screen, even after I changed its content size and changed its frame to be much larger than the screen itself). I also tried a merger of the two, with something like this (after disabling scrolling on the text view):</p>

<pre><code>_scrollView.scrollEnabled = YES;
_scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(320, 2000);
[_textView removeFromSuperview];
[_scrollView addSubview:_textView];

<p>But then the text view never appeared in the scroll view. I'm sure this is an issue other people have run into, as many apps have pages similar to the one I'm describing. I'm hoping someone can help me find a way to do this without using a UIScrollView and manually creating a label for each piece of text I want to add. </p>

<p>After more investigation it looks like the DbConnection variable was made a class variable to enable unit testing. When it's a local variable there's no way to test it's value. The state of the DbConnection was being tested</p>

<p>This can only happen because the underlying HashMap is used by two different Threads. As HashMap is not thread-safe the method loops forever because of <code>e = e.next</code> in HashMap Line 465 </p>

This is just a stop-gap solution until the end of the holidays and I can write it all in C#. I can get the VBScript files to execute with no problem but I am unable to execute the .bat file. When I ""click"" in the C# app to execute the .bat file a DOS window opens up and closes very fast and the test .bat file does not execute - ""Windows does not recognize bat as an internal or external command"" is the error returned in the DOS box. If I simply doubl-click the .bat file or manually run it from the command prompt it does execute. I also need the .bat file to execute silently unless a user interaction is required - this script copies 11k+ files to folders on a networked machine and occasionally Windows ""forgets"" if the destination is a file or directory and asks for the user to tell it what it is (this is a whole other issue not for discussion here...needless to say I am annoyed by it).</p>

<p>I am aware that this code does not work - but it is essentially what I want it to do. What I am looking at is something like this for .bat files. I assume I have to tell the system to use cmd to run the .bat. I am at a loss as to how to do this.  I have checked out this <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq/archive/2004/06/01/146375.aspx"">site</a> which is for C# 2003. Not much help for me as I am very green with C#. </p>

<p><strong>Focusing first on Storyboard:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>(a) Have a LoginViewController (as initial View Controller) and then
a segue to the MainViewController </li>
<li>(b) Have the MainViewController (as
initial View Controller) and a connection to the LoginViewController,
which will be used if the user is not logged in </li>
<li>(c) Like (a) but in a
NavigationController embedded</li>
</ul>

<p>Or are there other possibilities? </p>

<p><strong>Focusing on the code-logic:</strong>

<p>""Based on Harvard architecture, the CPU can concurrently fetch the data and instruction words...- Instruction fetches can take place during previous 
instruction execution and not wait for either a finish of 
instruction execution or have to stop the processor's
operation while the next instruction is being fetched.""</p>

<p>However due to my limited knowledge of computer architecture, this question arises to me:
""If the data (operands) to be manipulated are destined by the instruction word, how is it possible!? imagine by iteration from very first cycle, the instr. is loaded from prog. memory, then the two operands should be loaded in next cycle and here is the ambiguity:
now it is the execution time/cycle turn, so if while loading the data, the next instr. was loading simultaneously, the previous loaded instr. was lost and thus what could happen to the execution of that!? Or am i wrong and the execution is done immediately by loading the data from memory to data register!?""</p>

<p>** code example:
MPYF3 *(AR0)++, *(AR1)++, R0</p>

<p>*addendum:
I think, Since there is no register file so there is no load of any data into any register - directly done through memory!!
So in my opinion, after very first instr. has fetched, in next cycle the required data (operands) destined by the prev. instr. are manipulated (instr. exec.) through memory by functional unit and meanwhile the next instr. word is fetched, and the address of operands are also updated (as a result of exceution, through address register ALU); All because each of this operations (data access, arithmetic operation, address update, instruction fetch) are processed via distinctive - physical - architecture.</p>

<p>Is there anyone who can assure me about this my interpretation!?
Explanation of a typical instruction iterated over cycles making use of concurrent data and instruction access in DSP Harvard architecture is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

I just want to know if it's possible to get some settings from an external XML file in the server (from a SharePoint 'document library' in fact) to use them when loading some other data. This setting will be only the period which we want to be shown in some charts.<br>
I'm looking for this solution instead of editing the HTML and JS files to set it manually which what we're currently doing to change desired period to be loaded.<br>
I've done some research related to jQuery and Ajax but I haven't arrived to any conclusion yet. I've tried Ajax's GET method although it doesn't work equally between IE6 (users' browser) and Firefox: success and error call-back functions aren't fired properly.<br>
Is this doable? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is the code:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; 
$(document).ready(function(){

$.ajax({
type: ""GET"",
url: ""config.xml"",
dataType: ""xml"",
cache: false,
async: false,
success: function(xml) {
    // process xml returned
    alert(""success"");
    })
},
error: function() {
    // handle error
    alert(""error"");
}
});

});

<p>Which will create a new instance of a panel and pass it back to Lua. This works great, but I'd like to be able to create new controls inside lua, based upon controls created in C#.
This could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>function createCustomPanel()

        // Custom stuff here
    end;

<pre><code>gui:DefineControl(""custompanel"", createCustomPanel);

<p>The only problem left is, the controls written in C# cannot be extended with extra functions.</p>

<p>I'm using LuaInterface to bind C# and lua together, which I've downloaded the source of to try and see if I could add this functionality. For the most part, this is possible, by using a custom object extending the DynamicObject class and containing a list of LuaFunctions, which get called when needed, passing back the return value.</p>

<p>The only problem with that approach is, that Lua doesn't think the method has been executed properly.</p>

<p>Now I would like to ask what you think I should do concerning the extending of existing controls. Is this the right road to take, or should I take a whole different approach?</p>

<p>And if this is the right way, how could I add functions to an existing C# class, using Lua?</p>

"14990958","1","","","2013-02-20 22:13:57","","4","675","<p>I have a document management system that records all historical events in a history table. I've been asked to be able to provide the oldest doc_id that has a status of 5 for a given client on a given date. The table looks something like this (truncated for simplicity):</p>

<pre><code>doc_history:
    id integer
    doc_id integer
    event_date timestamp
    client_id integer
    status_id integer
</code></pre>

<p>The client_id and status_id columns are the value of the document after the event has occurred. This means that the maximum history event row for a document defined by doc_id will match the same columns in the document table. Limiting events by a specific event date, you can see what the values of the document were at that time. Because these values are not static, I can't just simply search for a specific client_id with a status_id of 5 because the found result might not match the max(id) of the document. Hopefully that makes some sense.</p>

<p>What I've found to work, but is slow, is the following:</p>

<pre><code>select
    t.*
from
    (select
        distinct on (doc_id),
        *
    from
        doc_history
    where
        event_date &lt;= '2013-02-17 23:59:59'
    order by
        doc_id, id desc) t
where
    t.client_id = 9999 and
    t.status_id = 5
limit 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I'm getting the maximum ID for a particular document ID before the given maximum event date, and then verifying that that maximum history item is assigned to the given client, with the status set to 5.</p>

<p>The drawback to doing it my way is that I'm scanning all history records for all clients to get their maximums, and then finding what I'm looking for for one client and status. As of right now, this scans roughly 15.06 million rows, and takes about 90 seconds on my dev server (which is not blazing fast).</p>

<p>To make matters more complicated I need to do this for each day of the previous week, or seven times total each run. Additionally, all documents in the system start with a status of 5, which represents new. This makes it so that this query would just return the first document entered for that client:</p>

<pre><code>select * from doc_history where client_id = 9999 and
    status_id = 5 and
    event_date &lt;= '2013-02-17 23:59:59'
    order by id limit 1;
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm hoping to do is scan until I find a maximum history record for a specific document that matches the specific client and status values without having to first find the maximum ids for all document ids for all clients first. I don't know if this can be done with a windowing function (partition by) or some other logic that I'm currently not seeing.</p>

<p>An example of one of the events in the doc_history table:</p>

<pre><code># select id, doc_id, event, old_value, new_value, event_date, client_id, status_id from doc_history where doc_id = 9999999 order by id;
    id    | doc_id  | event | old_value | new_value |         event_date         | client_id | status_id
----------+---------+-------+-----------+-----------+----------------------------+-----------+-----------
 25362415 | 9999999 |    13 |           |           | 2013-02-14 11:49:50.032824 |      9999 |         5
 25428192 | 9999999 |    15 |           |           | 2013-02-18 11:15:48.272542 |      9999 |         5
 25428193 | 9999999 |     7 | 5         | 1         | 2013-02-18 11:15:48.301377 |      9999 |         1
</code></pre>

<p>Event 7 is status changed, and the old and new values show that it was changed from 5 to 1, which is reflected in the status_id column. For an event_date of less than or equal to 2013-02-17 23:59:59, the above record would have been the oldest ""NEW"" document with status_id of 5, but after 2/17/2013 it would not have.</p>

<p>The entity looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Category
{
    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""Client"")
     * @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""client_id"", referencedColumnName=""client_id""))
     * @var Client
     */
    protected $client;

    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\Column(type=""string"")
     * @var string
     */
    protected $category_id;

    /**
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""Category"")
     * @ORM\JoinColumns({
     *  @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""parent_id"", referencedColumnName=""category_id"", nullable=true),
     *  @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""client_id"", referencedColumnName=""client_id"", nullable=false)
     * })
     * @var Category
     */
    protected $parent;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type=""translated"")
     * @SAP\Mapping(fieldName=""name"")
     * @var string
     */
    protected $name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, every child of a category must have the same client_id as its parent. 
The problem seems to be that Doctrine expects the parent to exists of the foreigen key isnt empfy ( = at least one field has a non-null value). Thats obviously always true since the FK contains a part of the PK. </p>

<p>Is there a way to tell Doctrine that it shouldn't try to load the parent if parent_id is null? </p>

<p>The only alternatives I see are changing the schema by either using an artifical auto generated pk or adding a new column for the parent_client_id and make sure it equals the client_id in PHP-land. </p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

  session.get(""connected"").map { user =&gt;
    Ok(""Hello "" + user)

    Unauthorized(""Oops, you are not connected"")

<p><a href=""http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.4/ScalaSessionFlash"" rel=""nofollow"">Documentation</a> explains <code>implicit</code> there: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alternatively you can retrieve the Session implicitly from a request</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides, I read this post: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6326132/scala-functional-literals-with-implicits"">Literal with Implicit</a> and it seems logically that function cannot have implicit parameter. </p>

<p>If I well figured out, this is because a <strong>function</strong>, contrary to <strong>method</strong> has always a contract (interface).</p>

<p>Indeed, for instance, <code>Function1[Int, Function1[Int, Int]]</code> has as a return type's first parameter an <code>Int</code>, and thus prevents us to annotate this one as <code>implicit</code>. This would lead to a confusion about its high-level return type: <code>() =&gt; Int</code> or <code>Int =&gt; Int</code>   ...</p>

<p>Therefore, what the previous snippet code behaves with implicit since first <code>Action</code>'s required parameter is a literal function.</p>

<p>I guess the reason allowing compiler to accept this code is the multiple signatures of <code>Action.apply()</code> method:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>def apply(block: Request[AnyContent] =&gt; Result): Action[AnyContent]</code></li>
<li><code>def apply(block: =&gt; Result): Action[AnyContent]</code> (redirecting to the first one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the second doesn't need some parameter, is this one selected in presence of a literal function's implicit parameter? </p>

<p>In this code, I read through each character of a file, convert it to lower case, and put it in a string.  Now, say I allocate 21 bytes * sizeof(char) to file_string.  Occasionally, after this piece of code shown here, strlen(file_string) will return 30, rather than the expected 20.  Perhaps there is something wrong with my pointer arithmetic?  Some things I have gathered:</p>

<p>1 - This only occurs some of the time.</p>

<p>2 - I have ensured that I am allocating the right amount of bytes to file_string (which happens the line directly before this code).  The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>fseek(fp, 0L, SEEK_END);
file_len = ftell(fp);
file_string = malloc( sizeof(char) * (file_len+1) );
</code></pre>

<p>printing file_len outputs  the expected length.</p>

<p>3 - I printed out the value of i to make sure it was iterating the exact number of times as the length of file_string, and it is.</p>

<p>4 - Now, DIRECTLY after this code (after closing the file), when I print out the length of file_string, sometimes it will suddenly increase to some larger size.  This has been causing me problems elsewhere in my code.</p>

<p>Now, I figure I can just stick the null terminal character in there and fix the problem (maybe that will cause errors further down the line), but I would prefer to know what's going on under the hood here.</p>

<p>Here is an example of my debugging, showing the change in size before and after.  Bear in mind, the before length corresponds to the file_len variable.</p>

Obviously, several instances of the same module are created in my project.</p>

<pre><code>var myModule = function() {

    if (!(this instanceof myModule)) { return new myModule(); }

    ...

};

...

module.exports = new myModule();

I'm trying to avoid having to alter and recompile the application which entails signifigant retesting, documentation, etc.  I tried altering the INI file so that for the new server I have put in:  SERVERNAME\INSTANCE,NEWPORTNUMBER</p>

<p>I have a basic <code>Dictionary&lt;long, object&gt;</code>. When trying either <code>ContainsKey()</code> or <code>TryGetValue()</code>, it doesn't always get a hit (when it should) and moves on to attempting to populate the missing entry (as it technically should if that were the case).</p>

<p>You guessed it: it then complains about the existing key because, well, it exists.</p>

<p>So why is it having problems matching a basic <code>long</code> key and how do you make it behave?</p>

<p>Edit: Code. I have tried several things. In their most basic form:</p>

<pre><code>public void Add(long id)
    {
        if (AreaDataDict.ContainsKey(id)) return;

        AreaData ad = new AreaData(id);
        ad.Load();
        AreaDataDict.Add(id, ad);
    }

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>public void Add(long id)
{
    AreaData areaData;
    if (AreaDataDict.TryGetValue(id, out areaData)) return;

    AreaData ad = new AreaData(id);
    ad.Load();
    AreaDataDict.Add(id, ad);

2. I Drag and drop the ClientDataset one my Form and connect it to my class with Livebindings, like this: DataSet &lt;---> Class &lt;---> Edit</p>

When the user clicks on an input field a tooltip should be displayed, which works fine. The problem comes when I try to remove the tooltip, which happens if the user clicks on another input field. Below is a piece of code from my application, and I hope it's enough to understand how it works.</p>

<p>The arguments that are passed to ""showTooltip()"" are a DOM reference to the clicked input field, the text that is displayed in the tooltip, and a number (0-4) that is used to find the containing div that's surrounding the clicked input field (all input fields are inside their own div).</p>

<p>The application works fine, but after I've clicked around a couple of times on the fields the following message is displayed in the console: ""Node was not found - inputDiv.removeChild(tooltip).

<p>Super basic javaScript question I can't find.....I'm learning from trial, mostly error, and StackOverflow.</p>

<p>When I refresh I want to return to the top of the page (F5 or browser reload or any other way the page can be reset). I believe this was the 'old' way browsers worked but when I refresh I stay in the same place on the page. I'm testing in Chrome. Of course I would like this behavior in all browsers. </p>

<p>In this case I am building a single page app. Most mobile users will never use the refresh/reload as it is buried in the hamburger, but I would like to handle this event by going back to the home state. In this case the <code>&lt;div data-role=""page"" id=""menu""&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I am using jquery but I want to make sure and learn javascript.</p>

&lt;div class=""pull-left""&gt; 
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=""font-size:80%""&gt; Animal Name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;%= @animal.name %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table class=""table""&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Type of Animal&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Breed&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Photo&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= @animal.animal_type %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= @animal.breed %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= @animal.photo %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Associated Orders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table class=""table""&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Order Number&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Order Status&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Line Notes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Line Units&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;%= render 'orderlist' %&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_animal_path(@animal) %&gt; |
&lt;%= link_to 'Back', animals_path %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And, finally, here's that orderlist helper</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% @animal.orders.each do |o| %&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;&lt;%= o.id %&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;&lt;%= o.status %&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;&lt;%= o.lines.notes %&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;&lt;%= o.lines.units %&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;%end%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This throws up an error when I visit the show page, though, saying</p>

<pre><code>undefined method `notes' for #&lt;ActiveRecord::Relation:0x007f9259c5da80&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I delete .notes, then it says the same for units. If I delete both (and leave o.lines), the page loads just fine and lists in those two table cells all the information (line id, line units, line notes) of the relevant lines. So it's definitely finding the right model object, but it's not letting me call the specific attribute. </p>

<p>Any idea what I'm doing wrong? Stumped. Thanks!</p>

I noticed that sometimes I need to place a watch on my data, so that my controllers/directives wait until the data is retrieved before continuing.</p>

<p>My question is: at what times do I need to place a watch? Up until now, I've only placed one if I noticed my application won't run without it, but I don't fully understand the logic behind it. Is it only needed when I am retrieving data from an external source using http? Or could it be that I need a watch() statement even if I'm getting data already stored in local variables?</p>

    return myVar
end tell

<p>So, basically I'm trying to get the value of <code>obj</code> and return it to AppleScript, which should be between 0 and 255 (it's a button). The problem is, I don't have any control over the javascript function so I can't add a <code>return obj.value</code>. Is this possible?</p>

<p>I am using omniauth for facebook authentication, but that can't be the problem since facebook login is working just fine, it's the normal registration that's causing the problem and it's not using and external service. Could it be that it is trying to send an email?</p>

<p>I want to accomplish this by (perhaps) having a background image of the room on a div, and then having another div inside that with a black background, to simulate the darkness. Then, as the player moved light sources around, removing the bits of the black background (or making them transparent) so you can see the background through them, making them look like they are lit up.</p>

<p>I've tried several methods - the only one so far that has worked was using lots of 1x1px black divs as 'pixels' and making them transparent programatically, but that was really (really) slow.</p>

<p>The problem is that I keep getting back 6.35 when I call pI() no matter what I input, I can't figure out what the problem is. I suspect it is in the charge() method by I can't tell where and the lack of errors doesn't narrow it down. The input 'VLSPADKTNVKAAW' should give a pI of 9.88. Any ideas?</p>

<h1>What I'm trying to do</h1>

<p>I want to be able to get all of the products, with the current prices in a given currency.</p>

<p>I've set up the models as follows:</p>

<h2>User</h2>

<pre><code>public function prices()
{
    return $this-&gt;hasMany('App\Price', 'product_id', 'id');
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Price</h2>

<pre><code>public function currency()
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo('App\Currency', 'currency_id', 'id');
}

public function product()
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo('App\Product', 'product_id', 'cat_id');
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Currency</h2>

<p>No relationships defined.</p>

<h1>What I've Tried</h1>

<pre><code>$products = $this-&gt;product-&gt;with([
        'prices' =&gt; function($query) use ($currency) {

            $query-&gt;where('valid_from', '&lt;=', date('Y-m-d'));
            $query-&gt;orderBy('valid_from', 'DESC');

                $currency = $this-&gt;currency-&gt;where('name', strtoupper($currency))-&gt;limit(1)-&gt;get();
                $query-&gt;where('currency_id', $currency[0]-&gt;id);


        },
        'prices.currency'
    ])-&gt;get();
</code></pre>

<p>Which pretty much works, but there's no way to return only one price (adding a limit on the $query doesn't work)</p>

I understand of how to validate all field in the form.
Using the plugin of this <a href=""http://jqueryvalidation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {

    $('#dialog').validate({
        rules: {
            category:
            {
                required: true
            },
        },
        submitHandler: function (form) { // for demo
            if ($('#ccategory').val() == 0){
                document.getElementById('choose_own_text').innerHTML  = ""Please change here"";
                return false;}
         //   console.log($('#ccategory').val());
            alert('valid form'); // for demo
            return false; // for demo
        }
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>But I have the <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> that I created via Javascript.
For example <code>id=""inputp""+j+""_id""</code> where j is a number.</p>

<p>Now I want to validate this field but i have the error:</p>

<pre><code>SyntaxError: missing : after property id
</code></pre>

<p>I use this method because I declare with the number the data.</p>

<p>How to correct this error for that I can use always this technique's validate.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense to someone, as I really cant get it to work.</p>

<p>I think a simple search within the database to extract all the values that match the device name would work best and then convert the device number attribute to a string and the device password to another string, i just cant work that bit out.</p>

<p>Many Thanks

What I currently have is the launch screen that displays when the user starts the application to which then I load in the home screen. At the moment the home screen looks exactly like the splash screen, but after a few seconds I would like a popup to appear with a menu layout (labels, buttons, etc.). I created a custom UIViewController with a view, a label, and a button on it. I then have the following code to call the popup:</p>

<pre><code>// Create our popup window
LoginPopupView *popup = [[[LoginPopupView alloc] init] autorelease];
[self presentModalViewController:popup animated:YES];

<p>This causes my home screen to rotate the background behind it and have the popup fill the fullscreen while the controls are also sideways. Both views are set to landscape mode and aside from this code snippet everything loads fine. It's only after I added in this code that everything is sideways (commenting out the snippet returns the view back to normal).</p>

I can connect with Gmail and can retrieve all the messages but I'm facing a problem here: I cannot tell if a message is already read or not. There is a flag property in the TidMessage component that should tell me if the message has been read.
The code looks like this:</p>

 i: Integer;
 count: Integer;
 flag: TIdMessageFlags;

 end;


 ShowMessage(IntToStr(Count));
 pop3Test.Disconnect;

<p>In the test mailbox there is one unread message but all the retrieved messages have the flags enum property empty so the result is always 0. Am I doing something wrong? Is it a problem of Indy/Gmail compatibility?</p>

It works fine when rendering, the alpha values are not displayed, but when in selection mode, the alpha test is skipped, and hovering the mouse over the transparent areas selects the object instead of whatever is behind it.</p>

Basically, I have a mesh that I've drawn and I am attempting to calculate an Oriented Bounding Box. In order to do this I have used Principle Component Analysis. After computing the Eigenvectors, I find the rotation matrix that would transform the eigen vectors onto the x, y and z axis respectively. I then transform the mesh by this rotation matrix, calculate an axis aligned bounding box and then rotate both the mesh and the box by the inverse of the rotation matrix. When I run the program, it successfuly runs through the bounding box function once, although no box is visible, but on the second run of the display function it crashed when trying to compute the bounding box. I have identified the line that causes the crash and it is part of the eigenvector calculations. However, because I am using a library that I was given to compute the eigenvectors I'm not completely sure what is going on in the function and I cant identify why it's not working. When it crashes it gives the error ""assertion failed"" followed by the file path of my program and the line. </p>

<p>My function for calculating the covariances is here:</p>

<p>Unfortunately I'm not experienced enough with C to really figure out what is causing the error here.
Because it might be relevant, here is my function that computes the rotation matrix:</p>

double sinAngle = modVector(crossProd)/(modVector(vec1) * modVector(vec2));
std::array&lt;std::array&lt;double, 3&gt;, 3&gt; xProdMatrix = {{{0, crossProd[2] * -1, crossProd[1]}, {crossProd[2], 0, crossProd[0] * -1}, {crossProd[1] * -1, crossProd[0], 0}}}; 
tempMatrix = matrixAdd(iMatrix, xProdMatrix);
tempMatrix2 = matrixMult(xProdMatrix, xProdMatrix);
tempMatrix2 = matrixMultNum(tempMatrix2, (1 - dotProd)/pow(sinAngle, 2));
tempMatrix = matrixAdd(tempMatrix, tempMatrix2);
return tempMatrix;
}

<p>If you need any more code segments I can provide them, I've hit a wall with this issue and haven't made any progress in hours so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that since the eigen calculation is from a library that the error is mine and not with the function and if I had to guess where my mistake was it would be in the rotation matrix calculation but I've not been able to spot the error myself if that is where it is.</p>

<p>Edit: Ok I've fixed the issue with my covariance calculations I hope but unfortunately the same crash still occurs. I've also changed all my arrays to std::arrays as per the advice of another commenter. I've been at this for 7 hours now.</p>

<pre><code>ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH, 0, 0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Attempting to run an executable with this code in GDB would result in the GDB quitting with the response of <code>[Inferior 1 (process #) exited with code 055]</code>. Getting around this was as simple as using loading the executable into gdb, and setting a breakpoint on ptrace with <code>b ptrace</code> and entering <code>y</code> when asked <code>Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n])</code>. Unfortunately, when the executable runs, this breakpoint is never set and it exits without continuing.</p>

<p>Here is how to reproduce the problem.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Xcode 5 with command line tools.</li>
<li>Install GDB through Homebrew (<code>brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/gdb.rb</code>), code sign the executable (<a href=""http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin</a>), and reboot (restarting taskgated did not seem to work).</li>
<li><p>Compile the following C program <code>ptrace.c</code>, compile using <code>gcc -o ptrace ptrace.c</code></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/ptrace.h&gt;

int main()
{
ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH, 0, 0, 0);
printf(""Hello, World!\n"");
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>From the directory with the compiled executable, follow along with the following.</p>

<pre><code>$ gdb ptrace
...
(gdb) b ptrace
Function ""ptrace"" not defined.
Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y

Breakpoint 1 (ptrace) pending.
(gdb) r
Starting program: .../ptrace
[Inferior 1 (process #) exited with code 055]
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>After further testing, the same is true for other functions that are not part of the executable, such as <code>printf</code>. I have scoured the internet and have not been able to find anything to suggest the above may not work. I'm open to pretty much any solution using gdb or lldb and would also appreciate any documentation as to what the issue may be.</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: Need a valid target to patch. You supplied: 'MyClass'
</code></pre>

<p>For example, the following code gives me the above error:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest
from mock import Mock, MagicMock, patch
from notification.models import Channel, addChannelWithName, deleteChannelWithName, listAllChannelNames

class TestChannel(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch(""Channel"")

        addChannelWithName(""channel1"")
        Channel.put.assert_called_with()
</code></pre>

<p>While this second version of the code does not give me the type error:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest
from mock import Mock, MagicMock, patch
from notification.models import Channel, addChannelWithName, deleteChannelWithName, listAllChannelNames

class TestChannel(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch(""notification.models.Channel"")

        Channel.put.assert_called_with()
</code></pre>

<p>Why is that? Why can I reference Channel as just ""Channel"" in other places, yet for the patch I need the module prefix not to get an error? Also, I have a feeling that giving the full module prefix isn't working either because when I call Channel.put.assert_called_with() I get the error that assert_called_with is not an attribute of Channel.put. Can someone explain what's going on? Thank you much!</p>

"16508640","1","","","2013-05-12 14:56:39","","7","1420","<p>I'm getting quite interested in search algorithms and backtrack programming. For now, I have implemented Algorithm X (see my other post here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16048609/determine-conflict-free-sets"">Determine conflict-free sets?</a> ) to solve an exact cover problem. This works very well but I'm now interested in solving this with a more basic variant of backtracking. I just can't figure out how this can be done. The problem description is the same as before:</p>

<p>Suppose you have a bunch of sets, whereas each set has a couple of subsets.</p>

<p>Set1 = { (banana, pineapple, orange), (apple, kale, cucumber), (onion, garlic) }</p>

<p>Set2 = { (banana, cucumber, garlic), (avocado, tomato) }</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>SetN = { ... }</p>

<p>The goal now is to select one subset from each set, whereas each subset must be conflict free with any other selected subset (one element is not contained in any of the other chosen subsets).</p>

<p>As an example, I wrote two Java classes that. The sets are identified by a single character and the elements are plain numbers.</p>

<p>I specifically have two problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to iterate over all sets/subsets in such a way that the use of a heuristic is possible (choose subset with minimum elements, minimum cost, ...)</li>
<li>How to maintain the selected sets+subsets and their contained elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>All other examples I can find are either Sudoku or n-Queens and are all using fixed for-loops. In addition to that, I was thinking about a rather general approach where a function ""isPossiblePartialSolution"" may be used to check, if a chosen path/set may be in conflict with a previously chosen subset/element.</p>

<p>Here are the two Java classes:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

    ArrayList&lt;Set&gt; allSets = buildRandomTest();

    for(Set r : allSets) {
        System.out.print(""Set with id: "" + r.id + "" is subset in collection: "" + r.name + "" and contains: "");
        for(Integer n : r.listOfElements) {
            System.out.print("" "" + n + "" "");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

}

public static int myRandomRange(int low, int high) {
    return (int) (Math.random() * (++high - low) + low);
}

public static ArrayList&lt;Set&gt; buildRandomTest() {

    ArrayList&lt;Set&gt; mySet = new ArrayList&lt;Set&gt;();

    int numberOfSets = myRandomRange(10, 12);

    for(int i=0; i&lt;numberOfSets; i++) {
        String nameOfSet = Character.toString((char) myRandomRange(65, 67));
        Set tmp = new Set(nameOfSet, i);

        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; listOfElements = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
        int elementsInList = myRandomRange(2, 4);

        for(int j=0; j&lt;elementsInList; j++) {
            listOfElements.add(myRandomRange(1,30));
        }

        tmp.listOfElements = listOfElements;
        mySet.add(tmp);
    }

    return mySet;
}

}

<p><code>main.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ""public: static int SUP::staticint"" (?staticint@SUP@@2HA)</code></p>

<p>I'm almost 100% certain I've set up ProjB's options correctly. Under ""Additional Dependencies"" all I have ""ProjA.lib"", and under ""Additional Library Directories"" I have the path to the directory where the ProjA.lib file is generated.</p>

<p>I've even had ProjA output a .map file, and in the map I find:
<code>0003:00004458       ?staticint@SUP@@2HA               10049458     foo.obj</code></p>

<p>So I'm guessing that it means that <code>staticint</code> has been defined correctly.</p>

<p>What could possibly be going wrong? Obviously, I'm doing something wrong, but I fail to see what. I've made sure that ProjB is linking with the correct .lib file. I've made sure the include directories are good. I've made sure that the definition of the static variable is sound. I will provide any other information if necessary.</p>

<p>and does not show the ""WITH"" clause so in fact I cannot actually edit and save the view getting an incorrect syntax complaint since an extra ')' char, and if I copy, it is not executable code. If I script the view to a query window however, I get the original code as I created it. The view with the CTE seems to work fine however.</p>

<p>My question is - is this normal? Can a CTE be used in a view like this? Should I see the WITH clause if I ask SSMS to design the saved view?</p>

<p>But i'm not able to find master key after login into my AWS console and look into created pipeline. Please help me to set master key to pipeline so that i can implement HLS content protection.</p>

I have created a web.config with binding redirects, and also a config file for the compiled code in the format My.ProjectName.dll.config - this is following advice here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15226494/assembly-binding-redirect-not-working"">Assembly binding redirect not working</a></p>

<p>I am using Azure SDK 1.7.</p>

<p>The issue is that despite having the correct binding redirect in both config files (this approach works on multiple other worker roles) I repeated see that the worker role recycles on deployment because of an issue.</p>

<p>Checking the event logs shows this is a binding redirect issue with Castle.Windsor:</p>

<pre><code>WaIISHost
Role entrypoint could not be created: System.TypeLoadException: Unable to load the role entry point due to the following exceptions:
-- System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'Castle.Windsor, Version=3.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=407dd0808d44fbdc' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)
File name: 'Castle.Windsor, Version=3.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=407dd0808d44fbdc'
</code></pre>

<p>I have enabled fusion logging to get additional detail, and I can see that the role entry point loads:</p>

<ul>
<li>F:\base\x64\WallSHost.exe.config</li>
<li>Machine.config</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't want to put the binding redirect in there because I have no control over those files as part of the deployment process.</p>

<p>I am sure I am missing something simple here - any suggestions as to what I might be missing?</p>

<p>For reference, my binding redirect contains the following (in both config files):</p>

<pre><code> &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
        &lt;assemblyIdentity name=""Castle.Windsor"" publicKeyToken=""407dd0808d44fbdc"" culture=""neutral"" /&gt;

"25388493","1","","","2014-08-19 16:28:12","","-1","20","<p>I have a method which creates a key value pair of delivery costs, the key being the type, and the value being the cost. </p>

<pre><code>  def calculate_scoped_job_delivery_costs
    delivery_hash = {}
    ['install', 'fuel', 'breakdown'].each do |scope|
      delivery_hash[scope.humanize] = job_delivery_costs.send(scope).inject(0) { |total, item| total + (item.cost_per_unit * item.hour_count) * item.quantity }
    end
    delivery_hash.delete_if {|key, value| value &lt;= 0 }
  end
</code></pre>

<p>the key is a scope in the job delivery costs model, which retrieves all associated costs with that scope and adds them up. It works, but I want to test its behaviour, albeit retrospectively.</p>

<p>So its core expected behaviour is: </p>

<ol>
<li>it should output a hash</li>
<li>it should calculate each scope value </li>
<li>it should remove blank values from the hash</li>
</ol>

<p>So I have written this test (factories posted below)</p>

<pre><code>let(:jdc1){FactoryGirl.create :job_delivery_cost, job: job, delivery_cost: delivery_cost}
let(:jdc2){FactoryGirl.create :job_delivery_cost, job: job, delivery_cost: delivery_cost}
let(:jdc3){FactoryGirl.create :job_delivery_cost, job: job, delivery_cost: delivery_cost}

describe ""calculate_scoped_job_delivery_costs"" do 
    before do
      allow(jdc1).to receive(:timing).and_return('fuel')
      jdc2.update_attributes(quantity: 4)
      jdc2.delivery_cost.update_attributes(timing: 'breakdown')
      allow(job).to receive(:job_delivery_costs).and_return(JobDeliveryCost.where(id: [jdc1,jdc2,jdc3].map{|jdc| jdc.id}))
    end
    it ""should retrieve a hash with jdc scopes"" do 
      expect(job.calculate_scoped_job_delivery_costs.is_a?(Hash)).to be_truthy
    end
    it ""should calculate each hash value"" do 
      expect(job.calculate_scoped_job_delivery_costs).to eq ""Fuel""=&gt;15.0
    end
    it ""should remove blank values from hash"" do 
      expect(job.calculate_scoped_job_delivery_costs).to_not include ""Breakdown""=&gt;0
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>So in the last test, it passes, why? I have purposefully tried to make it break by updating the attributes in the before block on <code>jdc2</code> so that <code>breakdown</code> is another scoped value.</p>

<p>Secondly, by changing the state of <code>jdc2</code> and its values, this should break test 2 as fuel is no longer calculated against the same values.</p>

<pre><code>Here are my factories...

    FactoryGirl.define do
      factory :job_delivery_cost do
        job
        delivery_cost
        cost_per_unit 1.5
        quantity 3
        hour_count 1.0
      end
    end 

FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :delivery_cost do
    title 
    timing ""Fuel""
    cost_per_unit 1.5
  end
end

FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :job do
    job_type
    initial_contact_id_placeholder {FactoryGirl.create(:contact).id}
    title ""random Title""
    start ""2013-10-04 11:21:24""
    finish ""2013-10-05 11:21:24""
    delivery ""2013-10-04 11:21:24""
    collection ""2013-10-05 11:21:24""
    delivery_required false
    collection_required false
    client { Client.first || FactoryGirl.create(:client) }
    workflow_state ""offer""
    admin
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>job has_many :job_delivery_costs. 
job_delivery_cost belongs_to :delivery_cost
has_many :job_delivery_costs
has_many :jobs, through: :job_delivery_costs</p>

<p>I am really struggling with the logic of these tests, I am sure there are more holes than what I have laid out above. I welcome criticism in that regard.</p>

<p>Now when I load this driver, my m/c crashes with (IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL_TO) at <code>KeWaitForSingleObject</code> that means, I'm trying to access invalid address. But Timer address is same in handler and in start_timer. Without KeWaitForSingleObject its fine. I don't know what is wrong, if anyone can help! </p>

<p><em><strong>//////////////////////////////

<p>WIthout <code>KeWaitForSingleObject</code> i.e.</p>

<pre><code>int handler(void* data)
{
    KTIMER *Timer = (KTIMER *)data;
    DbgPrint(""*** timer1.sys: Inside handler ...\n"");
    DbgPrint(""handler: Address of data: %p\n"", data);    // Same address
    DbgPrint(""handler: Address of Timer: %p\n"", TImer);  // Same address

    DbgPrint(""Done waiting!!! ...\n"");
    KeCancelTimer(Timer);
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Its crashing later .. installing driver successfully and also unloading successfully ... then suddenly blue screen! Windows driver programming isn't child's play! :(</p>

<p>Still same address in both the function .. BTW it works fine whn I write without thread ... (Uncommenting code in start_timer()) But I have to do it with thread ... What I want to do is, calling start_timer() with different delay multiple time, and handler should be called accordingly it should not block other execution hence creating thread.</p>

Different well-known node developers follow <a href=""http://dailyjs.com/2012/01/12/style/"" rel=""nofollow"">different styles</a>. For example, TJ Holowaychuk uses this style:</p>

<pre><code>(method1)
var connect = require('connect')
  , Router = require('./router')
  , methods = Router.methods.concat('del', 'all')
  , middleware = require('./middleware')
  , View = require('./view');
</code></pre>

<p>Ryan Dahl, on the other hand, prefers this way:</p>

<pre><code>(method2)
var express = require('express');
var socketio = require('socket.io');
var bench = require('./bench');
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: My question is not regarding style (which has been covered extensively in <a href=""https://gist.github.com/isaacs/357981"" rel=""nofollow"">this gist</a>), but rather about which of the two methods produce the most optimized code (Bonus points if specific to the case of requiring modules). I understand that the difference won't be much, but I do believe it is worth knowing. For example, in C++, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14242491/defining-multiple-variables-on-one-line-does-this-offer-any-optimization-for-th"">this question</a> comes to the conclusion that the build process will benefit a little from the smaller number of characters to parse. Apart from that, could there be any other advantage of one method over the other?</p>

          Bla &lt;a class=""trigger""&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""tooltip""&gt;empty&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>note: By default, the plugin loads extended HTML in the DIV with class ""tooltip"" after the trigger element.</p>

<p>Now, the JS should tell me the name of the parent DIVs ID and load content into the tooltip, depending on that ID name.  </p>

<pre><code>jQuery("".tooltip"").tooltip({
    onShow: function() {
        var foundId = jQuery(this).parent().parent().attr(""id"");
                    // generate a url from the result, e.g. exmpl.com/id-1.html
                    // put the url content in the tooltip container
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm pretty rubbish at JS - is there a solution to solve this?</p>

<p>Everything works but when I first pick like the categroy europe I get all the questions from Europe. So the intent = continent = europe. But when I after that choose another category it gives me the questions from europe again the intent doesn't change ...
How can I resolve this?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I need to plot three different lines in a single plot. The function I have listed does what I want it to do, but it will take a bit of work if I want a fine customisation in the x-axis (the time line). As it is, it prints just the years (for 10 years of data) or the months (for 6 months of data) in the x-axis, with no formatting for ticks.</p>

<p>If I use an xts object, i.e., if I use</p>

<pre><code>plot(xts-object-with-date-asset1-asset2, ...)
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>plot(date, asset2, ...)
</code></pre>

<p>I get a nicely formatted x-axis right away (along with the grid and the box), but subsequent additions to the plot using functions like points(), text(), lines() fails. I suppose points.xts() and text.xts() are not coming out any time soon.</p>

<p>I would like the convenience of xts objects, but I will also require a fine grained control over my plot. So what should my work-flow be like? Do I have to stick to basic graphics and do all the customisation manually? Or is there a way I can make xts work for me?</p>

<p>To observe this thing.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Xcode project.</li>
<li>Add the LocalAuthentication framework.</li>
<li>Observe that the app crashes right away in iPhone 5s with iOS 7.1.</li>
<li>Now mark LocalAuthentication as optional but it still crashes on that specific device.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I also set <strong>Link Frameworks Automatically</strong> to NO in build settings. Then I had to add ""<strong>UIKit</strong>"" framework to app manully. Apart from that I did nothing.</p>

<p>The plan is to work with a different translation namespace depending on which view (i.e. which handlebars file) is currently being served. So if we're looking at the page called ie(.hbs), i18next will look in the namespace called ie(.json) for the relevant language. This makes organisation and coordination of translations easier.</p>

<p>This is how I'm currently doing it: first I send the current page into the handlebars template for rendering (even this seems unnecessary - handlebars doesn't automatically expose which file it's rendering?):</p>

<p><code>res.render( url_base_path, { layout: (""sub""), title: title, currentpage: url_base_path } );</code></p>

<p>and then I access the variable ""greeting"" to be translated in the namespace of the current page like so <code>{{t ""greeting"" page=currentpage }}</code> - the annoying thing is that there are 10's of these variables on each page. Don't Repeat Yourself, anybody?</p>

<p>'t' is defined in the express3-handlebars create() function, like so, <code>helpers: { t: t }</code></p>

<p>and the translate function looks like this</p>

<pre><code>var t = function (i18next_key, options) {
  var page, result;
  page = options.hash.page;
  result = i18next.t(page + "":"" + i18next_key);
  return new hbs.handlebars.SafeString(result);
};
</code></pre>

<p>for the sake of full disclosure, this is what my (english) namespace file for the current page looks like</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""greeting"": ""Hello, it appears you're using Internet Explorer, an outdated web browser.""
}
</code></pre>

<p>this works, but it seems like there should be a much simpler solution.</p>

<p>what i really want is to be able to just type <code>{{t ""greeting""}}</code> into the handlebars template to achieve the same result. is this possible without overriding core handlebars functionality?</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(p=1234|p=111)($|&amp;)

<p>But some of these pages have really strange query strings and I don't know how to query them and remove them in htaccess.</p>

<pre><code>www.domain.com/news/?p=12345;0;0;0;latestnews

<p>OK I came up with a solution for these two</p>

<pre><code>www.domain.com/news/?p=12345;0;0;0;latestnews
www.domain.com/news/?p=123%3B0%3Blatestnews

<p>I just add p=123;0;0;0latestnews in condition as the code write like ths</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(p=1234|p=111|p=123;0;0;0latestnews)($|&amp;)

<p>I found the answer for feed=rss&amp;p=123, sorry that I forgot to metion that my site is a wordpress site. </p>

<p>So it seems like the browser is not recognise this page as a 404 or even a page under our server. the page looks like an empty RSS page.
So I decide to disable the RSS since I don't really use it, then do a redirect via PHP.
this is the code in my functions.php</p>

<pre><code>function wp_disable_feed() { 
    header('Location: http://www.mysite.com/news/');
    //wp_die( __('Sorry, no feeds available, return to &lt;a href=""'. get_bloginfo('url') .'""&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;') );
}
add_action('do_feed', 'wp_disable_feed', 1);
add_action('do_feed_rdf', 'wp_disable_feed', 1);
add_action('do_feed_rss', 'wp_disable_feed', 1);
add_action('do_feed_rss2', 'wp_disable_feed', 1);
add_action('do_feed_atom', 'wp_disable_feed', 1);

<p>So lets say I have this table</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE surveys_answer
    (`id` int, `activationCode_id` int, `mainQuestion_id` int, `subQuestion_id` int,   `timestamp` int);

INSERT INTO surveys_answer

 (3, 2, 3, 1, 201315),
 (4, 2, 4, 0, 201316),
 (5, 1, 9, 1, 201317),
 (6, 1, 6, 0, 201318),
 (7, 1, 4, 1, 201319);

<p>and I want the results which are <code>latest by time or id which have activationCode_id = 1 and where subQuestion_id = 0</code></p>

<p>what I want is</p>

<pre><code>2, 1, 4, 0, 201314

6, 1, 6, 0, 201318
</code></pre>

<p>I have been trying with group by, that misses (2, 1, 4, 0, 201314) and takes the first one (1, 1, 4, 0, 201313) which is not what I want</p>

<p>I thought this would work:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM surveys_answer 
WHERE activationCode_id = 1
AND subQuestion_id = 0
group by mainQuestion_id
</code></pre>

<p>I have been trying to get this to work:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  a.*
FROM    surveys_answer a
    INNER JOIN
    (
        SELECT  max(id) xx, mainQuestion_id
        FROM    surveys_answer 
        GROUP   BY mainQuestion_id
    ) b ON  a.mainQuestion_id = b.mainQuestion_id AND 
            a.id = b.xx AND a.activationCode_id = '1' AND a.subQuestion_id = 0

This annotation is just a normal MKPointAnnotation which I then change the image in the viewForAnnotation method. This is fine until I begin to drag the annotation, after which the annotation changes to the default red pin and loses the custom image I had set.</p>

<p>I create and add the annotation like this:</p>

<pre><code>MKPointAnnotation *userAnnotation = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];
[userAnnotation setCoordinate:userCoordinate];
[userAnnotation setTitle:@""My Location""];
[userAnnotation setSubtitle:@""Drag to move - Press to reset""];

[self.mapView addAnnotation:userAnnotation];

<p>Then I set the annotationView like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(id &lt;MKAnnotation&gt;)annotation {
....
[annotationView setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""locationpin""]];
[annotationView setDraggable:YES];
[annotationView.layer setZPosition:999];
return annotationView;
</code></pre>

<p>And I implement the method didChangeDragState: fromState: like so:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView
 annotationView:(MKAnnotationView *)annotationView
didChangeDragState:(MKAnnotationViewDragState)newState
   fromOldState:(MKAnnotationViewDragState)oldState {

    if (newState == MKAnnotationViewDragStateEnding) {

    bool b_correct;

    Answer():aText(0){;}  //default constructor

<pre><code>int main(void) 
{

    static const unsigned int MAX_ANSWERS = 5;
    Answer answers[MAX_ANSWERS];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The (unexpected) weirdness I am getting is that there is an alloc happening, and I haven't used a new anywhere in my code yet.  I'm guessing that the char* is calling this in the initialization list.</p>

<p>I am using valgrind to test my code, and I'm getting 11 allocs and 10 frees.  When I remove the initializer of <code>:aText(0)</code>, the extra alloc goes away.</p>

<p>I get that this is badly constructed code.  I am following a course outline to learn how to write in C++.  Can someone please help me understand how the memory is allocated or what's happening during the initialization list to cause a call to new?</p>

<p>I know the error is coming from the code shown.  I know the extra alloc is happening When I compile and run just this code.</p>

<p>How do you make user changes persistent?</p>

<p>I've used HTML5 localStorage before for saving text, checkbox, and select box entries, etc. but with this Timeline the only entry is:</p>

<p>which is the reference to the JS that builds the timeline container.</p>

<p>Any ideas or examples or pointers?</p>

Here is what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>//Check to see if localStorage is supported

    var data=timeline.getData();
    localStorage.setItem('mytimeline', JSON.stringify(data));
    var storedData=JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem('myTimeline') );

// clear storage
function clearLocal() {
clear: localStorage.clear();
return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've also made these changes - body onload=""storedData()"" to try to load localStorage saved values and changed div id=""mytimeline"" onmouseup=""storeTimelineData()"" to store the values when changes are made to the timeline.</p>

<p>Changes to the Timeline are being saved in localStorage and I can see these changes in the console for Key/Values.  When I refresh the browser though, these are not being loaded into mytimeline.  What did I miss?</p>

<p>I am trying to judge whether a phrase is semantically related to other words found in a corpus using Gensim.  For example, here is the corpus document pre-tokenized:</p>

<pre><code> **Corpus**
 Car Insurance
 Car Insurance Coverage
 Auto Insurance
 Best Insurance
 How much is car insurance
 Best auto coverage
 Auto policy
 Car Policy Insurance
</code></pre>

<p>My code (based on <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/tut3.html#similarity-interface"" rel=""nofollow"">this gensim tutorial</a>) judges the semantic relatendness of a phrase using cosine similarity against all strings in corpus.  </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>It seems that if a query contains ANY of the terms found within my dictionary, that phrase is judged as being semantically similar to the corpus (e.g.  **Giraffe Poop Car Murderer has a cosine similarity of 1 but SHOULD be semantically unrelated).  I am not sure how to solve for this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>#Tokenize Corpus and filter out anything that is a stop word or has a frequency &lt;1
texts = [[word for word in document if word not in stoplist]
        for document in documents]
from collections import defaultdict

for text in texts:
    for token in text:
        frequency[token] += 1
texts = [[token for token in text if frequency[token] &gt; 1]
        for text in texts]
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(texts)

# doc2bow counts the number of occurences of each distinct word, converts the word
# to its integer word id and returns the result as a sparse vector

corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]  
lsi = models.LsiModel(corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=2)
doc = ""giraffe poop car murderer""
vec_bow = dictionary.doc2bow(doc.lower().split())

#convert the query to LSI space
vec_lsi = lsi[vec_bow]              
index = similarities.MatrixSimilarity(lsi[corpus])

# perform a similarity query against the corpus

<p>As you can see there is a field <code>spell</code> wich i am using for a suggestion queries. 
This works great even for multiple term queries. </p>

<p>But what I need is to search on selected fields only.<br>
So for example I want valid suggestions only for the fields <code>image_memo</code> and <code>username</code>
The user can dynamicly add and remove fields to search.</p>

<p>I know that I could do something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>q=(image_memo:*search* OR image_username:*search*)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is is slowing down dramtically if you got a lot of fields and a multiple term query.</p>

<p>Example: Searching in Field <code>memo, username, field, field1 and field2</code> for <code>term, term1 and term2.</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>((memo:<em>term</em> OR username:<em>term</em> OR field:<em>term</em> OR field1:<em>term</em> OR
  field2:<em>term</em>) AND (memo:<em>term1</em> OR username:<em>term1</em> OR field:<em>term1</em>
  OR field1:<em>term1</em> OR field2:<em>term1</em>) AND (memo:<em>term2</em> OR
  username:<em>term2</em> OR field:<em>term2</em> OR field1:<em>term2</em> OR
  field2:<em>term2</em>))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any way to dynamically select the <code>spell</code> fields. Or is there a way that I can search for specific fields only in a multivalued field  </p>

"19710072","1","19793028","","2013-10-31 15:06:35","","0","665","<p>To start with, I'm not very familiar with the COM-technology, this is the first time I'm working with it so bear with me.
I'm trying to call a COM-object function from C#.</p>

<p>This is the interface in the idl-file:</p>

<pre><code>[id(6), helpstring(""vConnectInfo=ConnectInfoType"")] 
HRESULT ConnectTarget([in,out] VARIANT* vConnectInfo);
</code></pre>

<p>This is the interop interface I got after running tlbimp:</p>

<pre><code>    void ConnectTarget(ref object vConnectInfo);
</code></pre>

<p>The c++ code in COM object for the target function:</p>

<pre><code>STDMETHODIMP PCommunication::ConnectTarget(VARIANT* vConnectInfo)
{
    if (!((vConnectInfo-&gt;vt &amp; VT_ARRAY) &amp;&amp; (vConnectInfo-&gt;vt &amp; VT_BYREF)))
    {
        return E_INVALIDARG;
    }

    ConnectInfoType *pConnectInfo = (ConnectInfoType *)((*vConnectInfo-&gt;pparray)-&gt;pvData);
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This COM-object is running in another process, it is not in a dll.</p>

<p>I can add that the COM object is also used from another program written in C++. In that case there is no problem because in C++ a VARIANT is created and pparray->pvData is set to the connInfo data-structure and then the COM-object is called with the VARIANT as parameter.</p>

<p>In C#, as I understand, my struct should be marshalled as a VARIANT automatically. </p>

<p>These are two methods I've been using (or actually I've tried a lot more...) to call this method from C#:</p>

<pre><code>    private void method1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        pcom.PCom PCom = new pcom.PCom();
        pcom.IGeneralManagementServices mgmt = (pcom.IGeneralManagementServices)PCom;
        m_ci = new ConnectInfoType();
        fillConnInfo(ref m_ci);
        mgmt.ConnectTarget(m_ci);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In the above case the struct gets marshalled as VT_UNKNOWN. This is a simple case and works if the parameter is not a struct (eg. works for int).</p>

<pre><code>    private void method4_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        ConnectInfoType ci = new ConnectInfoType();
        fillConnInfo(ref ci);

        pcom PCom = new pcom.PCom();
        pcom.IGeneralManagementServices mgmt = (pcom.IGeneralManagementServices)PCom;

        ParameterModifier[] pms = new ParameterModifier[1];
        ParameterModifier pm = new ParameterModifier(1);
        pm[0] = true;
        pms[0] = pm;
        object[] param = new object[1];
        param[0] = ci;
        object[] args = new object[1];
        args[0] = param;
        mgmt.GetType().InvokeMember(""ConnectTarget"", BindingFlags.InvokeMethod, null, mgmt, args, pms, null, null);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In this case it gets marshalled as VT_ARRAY | VT_BYREF | VT_VARIANT. The problem is that when debugging the ""target-function"" ConnectTarget I cannot find the data I send in the SAFEARRAY-struct (or in any other place in memory either)</p>

<p>What do I do with a VT_VARIANT? </p>

<p>Any ideas on how to get my struct-data? </p>

<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<p>The ConnectInfoType struct:</p>

<pre><code>    [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]
    public class ConnectInfoType
    {
        public short network;
        public short nodeNumber;
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = 51)]
        public string connTargPassWord;
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = 8)]
        public string sConnectId;
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = 16)]
        public string sConnectPassword;
        public EnuConnectType eConnectType;
        public int hConnectHandle;
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = 8)]
        public string sAccessPassword;
    };
</code></pre>

<p>And the corresponding struct in c++:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct ConnectInfoType
{
    short network;
    short nodeNumber;
    char connTargPassWord[51];
    char sConnectId[8];
    char sConnectPassword[16];
    EnuConnectType eConnectType;
    int hConnectHandle;
    char sAccessPassword[8];
} ConnectInfoType;

<p>Notice the gaps between the rows. My problem is that they are not connecting properly while other Unix tools that use ANSI printing look fine in terminal. For example, tree, if I run <code>tree -A</code> in my terminal `I get this: </p>

<p>notice how vertical lines are connected together. it's funny because when I copy and paste the output of tree into my text editor and run my script I get something like this:</p>

I've came across a couple of bugs when trying to add to the iPhone's calendar, which I'm happy to try and sort out myself with a bit of debugging.</p>

<p>One problem is that when I go to run the application on the iPhone simulator, it seems to run an older version of the app than the one I am running. I've removed and added another button since then and the old button is still showing when I run it in the simulator. However, when I compile and run this on a device, it loads the correct version and displays the correct version number in the 'about' view.</p>

<p>But... my main problem is that it doesn't seem to debug on the device properly. The app actually works fine except for the calendar problems, but if I put a few breakpoints in so I can see exactly where this is going wrong, it just doesn't seem to step through! The app pauses, and Xcode says the app has paused! I can press step over and continue execution etc and it appears to work, but I can't see it stepping over the code, nor can I hover over variables to see their values.</p>

<p>I've tried reinstalling Xcode multiple times (I did have a problem installing an older version, so I had to wait until the next version was available before Xcode would install).</p>

<p>The stress is: Today is my last day at work, and I'd really like to get this app ready for iOS 5 before I leave.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen these symptoms before? Is there a debug setting that I've missed? Or is it a corrupted installation?</p>

<p>I wish I could help people a bit with more information, but I don't even know where to start looking here. Any code I can post? any settings? (not too familiar with this, I'm a .NET guy usually).</p>

<ol>
<li>live updates whenever a new message arrives or an existing message changes or gets deleted and</li>

<p>The first part seems easy. I create a firebase reference with a limit.</p>

<pre><code>ref = new Firebase(FIREBASE_URL).child(""chat"").limitToFirst(50);

<p>This reference is then used by an Adapter which adds a listener. And then modifies a List whenever data changes.</p>

<pre><code>ref.addChildEventListener(new ChildEventListener() {

    public void onChildAdded(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot, String previousChildName) {...}
    @Override
    public void onChildChanged(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot, String s) {...}
    @Override
    public void onChildRemoved(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {...}

<p>The second part is where I struggle to find the right approach.
When the user arrives at the end of the list, I want to load older messages and add them to the list of messages (infinite scroll).</p>

<p>The preferred solution would be to simply call something like <code>ref.changeLimitToFirst(100)</code> but such a method does not exist.</p>

<p>What would be the best approach to solve this with firebase?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>I deleted the solutions initially suggested by me because they did not help clarifying the problem. Instead, I will list new solutions below which I found since I originally asked the question. </p>

<p><strong>If you know of a better, more elegant approach, please leave an answer!</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The easiest approach seems to be to remove the listener from the old Query; Then create a new Query with a new limit. An example for this approach can be found in <a href=""https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/pull/7"" rel=""nofollow"">this pull request</a> for the Firebase-UI-Android lib. Downsides are:

<ul>
<li>After adding the new listener you will receive child_added event for each child, not only for the ones you are trying to load. Therefore you have to check if a child already exists in the ArrayList before adding it. This means there will be a lot of iterations if your list gets longer.</li>
<li>You don't know when loading is completed. A workaround for this is to add an additional value listener, which will be fired once the complete snapshot has been loaded (and thus loading of the new page is completed).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The second approach would be to load each page separately by listening to the value event. Unfortunately, something like offset() does not exist. So the way to go is to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27691254/firebase-query-with-limit-offset-possible-solutions"">remember the last item you loaded and pass it to the startAt method</a>. Downsides:

<ul>
<li>In order to receive updates you'd need to remove the old child listener and add a new one (because the limit changes) each time you'll load a new page. This listener will then receive child_added events which you have to filter out (see above).</li>
<li>The position of the last item might change between the time when you load the first page and the time you load and add the second page. If the order of your data might change, you can not be sure that child you saved still is the correct reference for your next Query. In this case you need, again, a child listener to receive updates on the data you previously loaded.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>What I'm trying to do:</strong>
A history form for my screen capture pet project. The history must list all images as thumbnails (ex: picasa).</p>

<p><strong>What I've done:</strong>
I created a HistoryItem:UserControl. 
This history item has a few buttons, a check box, a label and a picture box. The buttons are for delete/edit/copy image. The check box is used for selecting one or more images and the label is for some info text. The picture box is getting the image from a public property that is a path and a method creates a proportional thumbnail to display it when the control has been loaded. This user control has two public events. One for deleting the image  and one for bubbling the events for mouse enter and mouse leave trough all controls. For this I use <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13216/Broadcasting-Events-through-a-Control-Hierarchy"" rel=""nofollow"">EventBroadcastProvider</a>. The bubbling is useful because wherever I move the mouse over the control, the buttons appear. The dispose method has been extended and I manually remove the events.</p>

<p>All images are loaded by looping a xml file that contains the path of all images. For each image in this XML I create a new HitoryItem that is added (after a little coding to sort and limit the amount of images loaded) to a flow layout panel. </p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong>
When I lunch the history form, and the flow layout panel is populated with my HistoryItem custom control, my memory usage increases drastically.From 14Mb to around 100MB with 100 images loaded. By closing the history form and disposing whatever I could dispose and even trying to call GC.Collect() the memory increase remain. I search for any object that could not be disposed properly like an image or event but wherever I used them they are disposed. The problem seams to be from multiple sources. One is that the events for bubbling are not disposing properly, and the other is from the picture box itself. All of this i could see by commenting all the code to a limited version when only the custom control without any image processing and even events is loaded. Without the events the memory consumption is reduced by axiomatically 20%.</p>

<hr>

<p>So my real question is if this logic, flow layout panels and custom controls with picture boxes, is the best solution for displaying large amounts of images as thumbnails.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>At this time, I've found GeoDjango which looks a very complex solution to this problem. To use it, I need a quite complex setup and I couldn't find any recent (and good) tutorial.</p>

<p>I came with this solution: </p>

<ul>
<li>Store every polygon as a Json into the database</li>
<li>Apply a method to determine if some x,y belongs to any polygon</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with this solution is quite obvious: Queries may take too long to execute, considering I need to evaluate every polygon.</p>

<p>Finally: I'm looking for another solution for this problem, and I hope find something that doesn't have setup GeoDjango in my currently running server</p>

<p>Determine wheter some point is inside a polygon is not a problem (I found several examples); the problem is that retrieve every single polygon from DB and evaluate it does not scale. To solve that, I need to store the polygon in such way I can query it fast.</p>

I am trying to create a table on my website that displays the lowest 10 grades along with some information about the student. I am pretty comfortable from this aspect, but I am having trouble coding the write SQL query. I am using SQL Server 2008.</p>

<p>I have a table in my database with 10 columns and 500 rows. Two of these columns contain grades (grade1 and grade2). My goal is to display in my website table the TOP 10 lowest GRADE1, but if GRADE1 is NULL I want it to take GRADE2 into consideration and display that instead. So in context, if a student named Billy has no GRADE1 (its NULL) but his GRADE2 is the lowest of all (GRADE1's AND GRADE2's combined), he should be first in the list.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate help making a query capable of accomplishing this task, I have been researching for a solution but it has only confused me more.</p>

I have tileList within it. Contents in the tab comes dynamically so I cannot provide explicitly fixed height and width.
I need to resize the tabs depending on the contents within it. 
To resize the tabs I have enabled 'resizeToContent' property of tabNavigator.For some reason it is not resizing as expected.</p>

<p>Could anybody please suggest me the way out of it. 
Thanks </p>

<hr>

<p>Hey thanks Gregor for you reply,</p>

<p>'resizeToContent' works fine for other child items in tabNavigator but fails when I use tileList as child in tabNavigator that time tileList resizes to its default size(4 rows are only visible). So i was wondering if there any way so that I can force tileList to display all its items without putting scrollbars after its default size.</p>

<p>just by invalidating size on creationComplete ,will that resize all tabs for me. I am having n-number of tabs in tabNavigator as user can add tabs and content within it.
Could you please explain me, how can I achieve this.
I am new to flex so just getting confused with its behaviorand struggling with this issue from long time.</p>

<p>To further explain the usage, the user uploads 300dpi images which are approx 3000x3000 pixels. The user is using these images to create a catalog page which will be used for pdf printing. When they are creating the page, we only need 72dpi images to display to the screen, but for print, need the 300dpi images. Obviously they do not want to add a 3000x3000px image to the page, so it needs to be resized to the correct viewing area, e.g. 500x500px etc. </p>

The store requires a Beforeload variable of bin:</p>

<pre><code>BinDetailsStore.on('beforeload', function() {
        BinDetailsStore.getProxy().extraParams = {
            bin: bin
        }
    }, this);
</code></pre>

<p>From another function I have also been able to bring up the bin details from a successful add of a bin:</p>

<pre><code>...
button.up('form').submit({
                            clientValidation: false,
                            url: 'binsites/addbin?bin=' + bin + '&amp;size=' + size + '&amp;bintype=' + bintype + '&amp;stat=' + stat + '&amp;bpid=' + bpid + '&amp;rte=' + rte,
                            success: function() {
                                Ext.Msg.alert('Bin Added', 'Bin ' + bin + ' added');
                                deleteFlag = false;
                                BinDetailsStore.load();

                                popBinAdd.close();
                                popBinAdd = null;
                            }
                        });
</code></pre>

<p>However when I edit a bin's details and try to reload the store this way</p>

<pre><code>...
button.up('form').submit({
                    url: 'binsites/editbin?bid=' + bid + '&amp;size=' + newSize + '&amp;type=' + newType + '&amp;bin=' + bin,
                    success: function() {
                        Ext.Msg.alert('Bin Saved', 'Bin ' + bin + ' has been saved');
                        //Ext.Msg.alert(bin);
                        editFlag = false;
                        binEdForm.close();
                        binEdForm = null;
                        BinDetailsStore.load();
                    }
                });
</code></pre>

<p>The details save and the success call is called but I lose the value of bin by the time the beforeload event is hit.
I have tried redefining bin within the success function and passing bin along to another function to call the load on BinDetailsStore (bin transfers to new function but is again lost for beforeload) to no avail.</p>

<p>Bin is defined as so:</p>

<pre><code>BinDetailsStore.on('load', function() {
        if (deleteFlag) {
            bin = null;
            bid = null;
            size = null;
            bintype = null;
            stat = null;
            this.binDelConfirm(bin, bid, size, bintype);
        } else if (editFlag) {
            bin = null;
            bid = null;
            size = null;
            updated = null;
            bintype = null;
            stat = null;
            desc = null;
            this.binEditForm(bin, bid, size, updated, bintype, stat, desc);
        } else {
            this.loadSearchResults();
        }
    }, this);
</code></pre>

<p>Because the editFlag is active it passes along to binEditForm:</p>

<pre><code>binEditForm: function(bin, bid, size, updated,  bintype, stat, descr) {
    if (binEdSer) {
        binEdSer.close();
        binEdSer = null;
    }
    if (binEdForm) {
        binEdForm.close();
        binEdForm = null;
    }
    if (binResult) {
            binResult.destroy();
            binResult = null;
    } 
    if (cusResult) {
        cusResult.destroy();
        cusResult = null;
    }

    if (!bin &amp;&amp; !bid &amp;&amp; !size &amp;&amp; !updated &amp;&amp; !bintype &amp;&amp; !stat &amp;&amp; !desc) {
      if (BinDetailsStore.getTotalCount()) {
        rec = BinDetailsStore.getAt(0);

        bin = rec.get('number');
        bid = rec.get('id_');
        size = rec.get('size');
        updated = rec.get('updated');
        bintype = rec.get('bintype');
        if (rec.get('cust_type') == 'Park' || rec.get('cust_type') == 'Truck') {
                stat = rec.get('cust_type') + ' - ' + rec.get('park');
            } else {
                stat = rec.get('cust_type');
            }
        desc = rec.get('desc_');
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In short I would like to know why the value of bin disappears when the BinDetailsStore beforeload event gets fired.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>The Build works, so long as I enter no checkout rules.
If I understand it, I'll need to set up some artifacts, that themselves rely on checkout rules(?).</p>

<p>I have two builds that are identical other than the way they are kicked off.
One is initiated on check-in
One is initiated manually from within TC. This build is the Test Build</p>

<p>Assembly version numbers come from a single versioninfo.cs file that is a linked file in all projects in the solution. This method is detailed here : <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/328977/The-Right-Way-to-Version-Your-Assemblies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/328977/The-Right-Way-to-Version-Your-Assemblies</a> and holds the version number thus:
    [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(""9.1.0.0"")]</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'm unable to copy the output of the test build to another location.
As it stands, the only output of a build is in the teamcity data directory, for example :
    C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\ceaaf65dc87ff856\Project1\bin\Debug
    C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\ceaaf65dc87ff856\Project2\bin\Debug
etc</p>

<p>I'd like to copy the output files (exes and DLLs) to an output folder which has the build number of the build on it
For arguments sake, lets say for the version number above, this would be to
    c:\BuildServer_Output\SolutionName\9.1.0.0</p>

<p>Currently I have not been able to create artifact paths that actually do anything - i.e. to copy anything anywhere.
For instance I have acoupe of artifact paths, but nothing ever gets put into C:\BuildServer_TestBuilds - 
    +:Accounts\bin\debug* => C:\BuildServer_TestBuilds
    +:BackOffice\bin\debug* => C:\BuildServer_TestBuilds</p>

<p>Am I getting no artifacts (and my artifact paths therefore ignored) because I have no checkout rules? </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

(I know this is trivial question, but I can't get my head around this.)</p>

<p>Chapter 10, page 240:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>10.2-4</em></strong> </p>
  
  <p>As written, each loop iteration in the LIST-SEARCH procedure requires
  two tests: one for <code>x != L.nil</code> and one for <code>x.key != k</code>. Show how to
  eliminate the test for <code>x != L.nil</code> in each iteration.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>LIST-SEARCH(L, k)
  x = L.nil.next
  while x != L.nil and x.key != k
    x = x.next
  return x
</code></pre>

<p><code>L</code> is circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel. (A sentinel is a fixed static element in the starting, that helps to simplify boundary conditions. For example, suppose that we provide with list <code>L</code> an object <code>L.nil</code> that represents <code>NIL</code> but has all the attributes of other objects in the list.)</p>

<p>Unless, <code>k</code> you search for is always present, simple removing <code>x != L.nil</code> would cause infinite iteration. </p>

<p>You can transform, this expression <code>x != L.nil</code> to other expressions (such as count of elements in the list), but that isn't a solution, I guess.</p>

<p>What am I lacking in solving this question?</p>

However the code is not getting added and I don't know if this is a bug with IE9 or MVC.</p>

<p>The problem is that I put the code for the script at the top of the view - it gets added to a session which then gets rendered on the master template, but in IE9, the view is not being hit so the code doesn't get rendered.  I have put a breakpoint onto the view and visited the page in all the browsers.  The breakpoint gets hit and then moves onto the master layout in every browser except IE9 where the breakpoint is completely missed (no matter where I put it in the view) and the master layout is loaded first.</p>

<p>However if I do a postback on this page, the view will then be hit and the script will render.</p>

<p>Has anyone had this problem before or know what causes it</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> </p>

<p>the code in the controller isn't hit in IE9 either.  Is this a caching problem - if so, how do I stop MVC caching a page</p>

<p>Okay, a further update is in IE9, I have noticed that the url being loaded is <code>http://localhost/Quote/#/Quote/Form/</code> but in every other browser the url is the correct one: <code>http://localhost/Quote/Form/</code>.  If I go to the correct url then the page works properly in IE9. </p>

<p>Is this caused by jQuery mobile ajax enabled option?</p>

But we are having a issue with the AI. If you click on a empty tile in our grid a method will trigger called onEmptyTileClicked with a X and Y coordinate of the tile. We use this method to place stones on the field (each player has its own stone so lets say you are blue and the AI is yellow).</p>

<p>You can see a basic example here:</p>

<pre><code>public void onEmptyTileClicked(int x, int y) {
        GameBoard board = getGameBoard();
        int counter = 0;
        //check if the blue player needs to set or the yellow
        if (player1) {

            //sets the amount of diamonds that will be taken over in the var counter, if this is bigger than 0 we can place it
            counter = board.countTakeovers(x,y, true);
            if (counter &gt; 0) {
                //add the diamond to the board
                board.addGameObject(new Blue(), x, y);

                //add a message in logcat and in the statistic log
                Log.d(""CoolGameBoard"", ""Adding blue diamond"");  
                activity.updateStatisticLog(activity.getString(R.string.blue_placed)+"" ""+(x+1)+"", ""+(y+1)+ "" + "" + counter + "" "" + activity.getString(R.string.conquered)); 

                //change all the diamonds that are taken over with this set
                board.takeover(x,y,true);

                //turn is over give the other player a turn and update the gameboard
                setDone();

            } else {

                //player clicked a wrong point, give them a error message
                Log.d(""CoolGameBoard"", ""Can't place the blue diamond at this location."");
                activity.updateStatisticLog(activity.getString(R.string.cant_blue) + "" ""+(x+1)+"", ""+(y+1)); 
            }

        } else {

            counter = board.countTakeovers(x,y,false);
            if (counter &gt; 0) {
                board.addGameObject(new Yellow(), x, y);
                Log.d(""CoolGameBoard"", ""Adding yellow diamond"");                
                activity.updateStatisticLog(activity.getString(R.string.yellow_placed)+"" ""+(x+1)+"", ""+(y+1)+ "" + "" + counter + "" "" + activity.getString(R.string.conquered));                                   
                board.takeover(x,y,false);              
                setDone();
            } else {
                Log.d(""CoolGameBoard"", ""Can't place the yellow diamond at this location."");
                activity.updateStatisticLog(activity.getString(R.string.cant_yellow) + "" ""+(x+1)+"", ""+(y+1));       
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If a player placed a stone the setDone() method will be called to handle some visual stuff like updateing the gameboard and some other stuff. This method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void setDone() {
    GameBoard board = getGameBoard();
    player1 = !player1;

    activity.updateBeurt(player1);
    activity.updateBlueDiamonds(board.countBlueDiamonds());
    activity.updateYellowDiamonds(board.countYellowDiamonds());
    board.updateView();

    if (board.possibilities(player1) == 0) {
        player1 = !player1;
        activity.updateBeurt(player1);
        if (board.possibilities(player1) == 0) {
            Log.d(""FDGame"",""GAME OVER!!"");
            activity.gameOver();
        }
    }

    if(AI &amp;&amp; !player1){
        computerPlayer.move();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see at the end of this method if the boolean AI is set to true we will call the computerPlayer.move(); method which will basicially let the AI set a new stone which we once again use the onEmtpyTileClicked() method for.</p>

<p>We wanted to have a sleep between the set you made as a player and the set your AI does else you won't see the chances the AI makes to the field. However the method board.updateView() seems to be executed at the end of the whole onEmtpyTileClicked() loop. this method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void updateView() {
    Log.d(TAG, ""Updating game view"");

    setChanged();
    notifyObservers();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Could someone maybe explain why the notifyObservers() only triggers while a certain thread seems to be done? Because if we add a sleep before the AI makes a move it will just look like nothing is placed for a second and then both of the stones are placed resulting in the same as before with just a delay before it all happends.</p>

the network adapter, including enabling/disabling DHCP.
For this purpose, i'm using the ""SetIpConfig"" command from this source code:</p>

<p><a href=""http://delphi.borlandforum.com/impboard/impboard.dll?action=read&amp;db=del_tip&amp;no=204"" rel=""nofollow"">SetIPConfig</a></p>

<p>It works very well and does what i need if the network adapter is connected.
The problem is that i cannot enable DHCP if  the LAN cable is unplugged,
while i can correctly change other parameters such as IP or Gateway.
When i try to enable dhcp, while network adapter is disconnected, i
get the ole error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>94 Path, file, or object not found</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it should work anyway, even if the network card is disconnected, because
i can do this correctly, going into the network card/ip properties window (using XP).</p>

<p>HERE IS DESCRIBED EXACTLY MY PROBLEM:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/515984-c-enabling-dhcp-on-nic-through-wmi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/515984-c-enabling-dhcp-on-nic-through-wmi/</a></p>

<p>as that guy did, i tried to change directly the register keys to activate
the DHCP but, even if on the network adapter properties, the value
was changed correctly, the NIC behaved like nothing was changed, like
the changes were not ""applied"" to it.  </p>

<p>Here another topic related:</p>

<p>www.winvistatips.com/wmi-config-fails-ethernet-cable-unplugged-t181330.html</p>

<p>They suggest to disable dhcpsense putting a key into
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
named DisableDHCPMediaSense (DWORD) and setting it to 1.</p>

<p>Ok..it works now, i didn't try the full dhcp functionality, just i've seen that
it can be enabled with nic unplugged but, as someone wrote, i don't think
disabling dhcp sense is a great idea.
It means that the dhcp client cannot know the connection status, so i think
that it could have troubles in renewing leases if the connection drops, then
is estabilished again. </p>

<p>OS: XP SP3
Language:DelphiXE</p>

<p>What's wrong ?
Many thanks.</p>

"30775365","1","","","2015-06-11 08:22:00","","-1","64","<p>In my angular app I have some HTML with angulars <code>ng-class</code> directive:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button type=""button"" class=""btn"" ng-class=""{true:'btn-success', false:'btn-danger'}[status.isSoftware()]""&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;{{status.isSoftware()}}&lt;/span&gt;

<p>This evaluates to:</p>

<p>As you can see, <code>ng-class</code> evaluates the expression to <code>true</code> and assigns <code>.btn-success</code> to my button while the <code>span</code> evaluates the same expression to <code>false</code> (what is the expexted behaviour). I debugged the function and it always returns <code>false</code> (as it should).</p>

<p>How is this even possible? I have quite similar statements throughout my application and everywhere else it works fine.</p>

<p>I have created 2 class for this. A base class that Inherit UltraButton where I put the values that will be common to all the buttons. In this case the ButtonStyle, image size and the control size.</p>

<p>Here is the class :</p>

<pre><code>    public class BaseButton : Infragistics.Win.Misc.UltraButton
{
    public BaseButton()
    {
        //We set the properties of the base object.
        ButtonStyle = Infragistics.Win.UIElementButtonStyle.Popup;
        ImageSize = new Size(32, 32);
        Size = new Size(100, 62);
    }

    [Browsable(false)]
    public new Size Size
    {
        get { return base.Size; }

        set { base.Size = value; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I need to create a Reset button (that inherits from BaseButton) that will specify the image to use for the ResetBt, the Text and the default anchoring for the control :</p>

<pre><code>public class ResetBt : BaseButton
{
    private readonly string _text;

    public ResetBt()
    {
        Appearance.Image = Properties.Resources.Restart_32_32;
        _text = ""&amp;Reset"";
        base.Anchor = AnchorStyles.Bottom | AnchorStyles.Right;
    }

    [Browsable(false)]
    public override string Text
    {
        get { return _text; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is where I noticed a problem. If I try to change the Anchor setting at design-time I can but at run time the values passed to the constructor override anything that was input at design-time. That behavior is fine for the image of the button and the Text value but for other properties like Anchor this is not suitable. </p>

<p>What is the best approach to pass default values to some properties of an inherited control and still allow for their modification at design-time ?</p>

<p>Okay so I have an exe file with ""add"" defined in it, This exe is a win32 console application and loads a DLL. The DLL also aims to use the add function from the exe file ( without exports )</p>

<p>Here is my main win32 console application file:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#pragma auto_inline ( off )

int add ( int a, int b )
{
    printf( ""Adding some ints\n"" );
    return a + b;
}

int main ( )
{
    HMODULE module = NULL;

    if ( (module = LoadLibrary( L""hook.dll"" )) == NULL )
    {
        printf( ""Could not load library: %ld\n"", GetLastError() );
        return 0;
    }

    add( 3, 5 );

    FreeLibrary( module );

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is code for hook.dll:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;detours.h&gt;

static int (*add) ( int a, int b ) = ( int (*)( int a, int b ) ) 0x401000;

int Detoured_add ( int a, int b )
{
    return add( a, b );
}

BOOL WINAPI DllMain ( HINSTANCE hDll, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved )
{
    if ( reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH )
    {
        DetourTransactionBegin();
        DetourAttach( (PVOID*) &amp;add, Detoured_add );
        DetourTransactionCommit();

    }
    else if ( reason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH )
    {
        DetourTransactionBegin();
        DetourDetach( (PVOID*) &amp;add, Detoured_add );
        DetourTransactionCommit();
    }

    return TRUE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I disassembled my win32 console application to find the address of the add function</p>

<pre><code>.text:00401000 ; ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ S U B R O U T I N E ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦

<p>The problem is when I call LoadLibrary, it returns 998 which I believe is error code access violation. I guess this makes sense though as that memory area is probably protected.</p>

<p>Any tips?</p>

<p>i have a sql query question. Two tables:</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong></p>

<pre><code>lid  State
---  -----
1    MI
2    FL
3    CA
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Time</strong></p>

<pre><code>tid lid
a   1
b   1
c   2
d   2
e   3
f   3
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to connect those two tables.  If I do:</p>

<pre><code>select l.lid, l.state, t.tid 
from location l, time t 
where l.lid=t.lid
</code></pre>

<p>Then it will give me this result:</p>

<pre><code>lid state tid
--- ----- ---
1   MI    a
1   MI    b
2   FL    c
2   FL    d
3   CA    e
3   CA    f
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of getting this, I want to have this result:</p>

<pre><code>lid state tid1 tid2
--- ----- ---- ----
1   MI    a    b
2   FL    c    d
3   CA    e    f
</code></pre>

<p>How should I write the query? </p>

<p>Also, assume that in the <strong>Time</strong> table there would be <strong>exactly two records</strong> for each lid. </p>

<p>This is what the salt generation code does, step by step</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A pseudo-random string with a length of 10 is generated, It has these possible values :</p>

<p>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p></li>
<li><p>A truly random number from -2 to 123 is generated by atmospheric noise</p></li>
<li>This pseudo random string and completely random number are shuffled together with a unix timestamp.</li>
<li>This pre-salt is then encrypted with md5.</li>

<p>Also, just how long should a salt be? I personally don't think hashing it's other types of characters matters that much simply because no one brute forces an entire <strong>salt</strong>, I don't think. That's all! Thanks in advance. Also, any better or more efficient method would be helpful.</p>

"30998847","1","","","2015-06-23 09:23:46","","0","33","<p><strong>Summary:</strong> VB.NET has the <code>handles</code> clause for attaching event handlers.  When the event belongs to a custom <code>DataGridViewColumn</code>, the WinForms designer removes this clause from the code each time the ""edit columns"" dialog of the <code>DataGridView</code> is used.</p>

<p><strong>Long version:</strong> I implemented a simple <code>DataGridViewColumn</code> by deriving from the <code>DataGridViewButtonColumn</code> class.  All it does is add an event <code>GetImage</code>, used by the paint logic of the cell (the cell code is not relevant to the problem).</p>

<pre><code>Public Class DataGridViewAdvButtonColumn
    Inherits DataGridViewButtonColumn

    Public Sub New()
        Me.CellTemplate = New DataGridViewAdvButtonCell
    End Sub

    Public Event GetImage(ByVal rowIndex As Integer, ByRef image As Image)

    Friend Sub OnGetImage(ByVal rowIndex As Integer, ByRef image As Image)
        RaiseEvent GetImage(rowIndex, image)
    End Sub

    Public Overrides Function Clone() As Object
        Return TryCast(MyBase.Clone, DataGridViewAdvButtonColumn)
    End Function

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose I use this column type on a specific form, and I attach a handler to the <code>GetImage</code> event, like so:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub column_GetImage(rowIndex As Integer, ByRef image As Image) Handles column.GetImage
    ' ...
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am experiencing is that the WinForms designer removes the <code>handles</code> clause whenever I open the ""edit columns"" dialog of the <code>DataGridView</code> hosting the column.  Result:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub column_GetImage(rowIndex As Integer, ByRef image As Image) 
    ' ...
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>That should obviously not happen.  It is very dangerous, because it mostly goes unnoticed (produces no compiler errors).</p>

<p>I already tried adding code to the <code>Clone</code> method of the column, to copy over attached event handlers.  However, that did not change anything (I noted that there are no attached events at design time anyway).  I also tried changing the signature of the event to something more ""conventional"" with <code>e As GetImageEventArgs</code> instead of <code>ByRef image As Image</code>; didn't help.</p>

<p>This should be a common problem, but somehow nobody seems to be using custom events on their custom <code>DataGridViewColumns</code>.  So Google did not turn up anything either.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong> To answer the questions of user Plutonix, here the detailed steps to reproduce this (compiles with option strict).</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a WinForms project.</li>
<li>Add the <code>DataGridViewAdvButtonColumn</code> class (code above) to the project</li>
<li>Add the <code>DataGridViewAdvButtonCell</code> class (code below) to the project</li>
<li>Compile</li>
<li>Use the designer to add a <code>DataGridView</code> to the <code>Form1.vb</code> form.</li>
<li>Use the designer to add a new column of type <code>DataGridViewAdvButtonColumn</code> to the <code>DataGridView</code></li>
<li>Select the column in the property editor, click on the events icon (so that all events are listed) and double-click on the <code>GetImage</code> event.</li>
<li>You are now in the code-behind of the form with an event handler as shown in my example above.</li>
<li>Go back to the designer; add another column (type does not matter) to the <code>DataGridView</code></li>
<li>Go back to the code-behind.  You will see that the <code>handles</code> statement for the event handler added in the previous step is now gone.  QED</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the code of the DataGridViewAdvButtonCell:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class DataGridViewAdvButtonCell
    Inherits DataGridViewButtonCell

    Public Overrides Function Clone() As Object
        Return TryCast(MyBase.Clone, DataGridViewButtonCell)

<p>My current, inelegant solution is to return the query to a DataTable, then iterate through the table's columns, deleting the one's i dont want. This is not robust, efficient, and does not like me delete the primary key column.</p>

<p>Let's consider a recursive <code>quick_sort</code> function which is currently set up as follows: (i) it takes one argument - a linked-list, (ii) it sorts elements in ascending order, and (iii) it returns a sorted linked-list.  Illustrative code below (I can post actual code - which is obv longer - upon request).  </p>

<pre><code>#include ""list.h""  /*our linked-list implementation which includes definitions
                     for `concatenate`, which we use below*/

typedef int (*ordinal(int referenceValue, int currentValue));

int smaller(int referenceValue, int currentValue)
{
  return currentValue &lt;= referenceValue ? 1 : 0;
}

int larger(int referenceValue, int currentValue)
{
  return currentValue &gt; referenceValue ? 1 : 0;
}

List *getElements(List *fullList, ordinal compare)  /*let's assume this function exists*/
  /*implementation of getElements*/

List* quickSort(List* originalList)
{
  /*code to handle the two base cases, i.e., the cases
    in which the input list has either 0 or 1 elements */

  List *pivotElement = List_create();
  List_push(pivotElement, originalList-&gt;first-&gt;value);

  /*we're simply using the first element in the list as the pivot-point*/

  List *prePivotElements = quickSort( getElements(originalList, smaller) );
  List *postPivotElements = quickSort ( getElements(originalList, larger) );
  List *newList = concatenate(prePivotElements, pivotElement, postPivotElements);

  return newList;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's say we wanted to modify our <code>quick_sort</code> function so that it takes two arguments: a linked-list AND an array of function pointers.  The idea is to use the second argument (i.e., the array of function pointers) to specify the sort order.  The syntax for the function call would look something like this: <code>quick_sort(linked_list, increasing[])</code> or <code>quick_sort(linked_list, decreasing[])</code>.  </p>

<p>I should mention that my focus is on understanding the feasibility of/the correct syntax for recursively passing arrays of function pointers and not so much on efficiency of algorithm, etc.  In other words, let's try to ignore the horrible efficiency/memory-management aspects of this particular implementation of quick-sort :)</p>

<p>In order to modify <code>quick_sort</code> as described above, I thought that the following code might work...</p>

<pre><code>#include ""list.h"" 

typedef int (*ordinal(int referenceValue, int currentValue));

int smaller(int referenceValue, int currentValue)
{
  return currentValue &lt;= referenceValue ? 1 : 0;
}

int larger(int referenceValue, int currentValue)
{
  return currentValue &gt; referenceValue ? 1 : 0;
}

/*two new global arrays of function pointers*/
int (*increasing[2]) (int referenceValue, int currentValue) = {smaller, larger};
int (*decreasing[2]) (int referenceValue, int currentValue) = {larger, smaller};

List *getElements(List *fullList, ordinal compare)
  /*implementation of getElements*/

/*updated argument list*/
List* quickSort(List* originalList, ordinal compare[])
{
  /*base cases*/
  List *pivotElement = List_create();
  List_push(pivotElement, originalList-&gt;first-&gt;value);

  /*updated recursive function call*/
  List *prePivotElements = 
              quickSort( getElements(originalList, compare[0]), compare );
  List *postPivotElements = 
              quickSort ( getElements(originalList, compare[1]), compare );
  List *newList = concatenate(prePivotElements, pivotElement, postPivotElements);

  return newList;
}
</code></pre>

<p>...but it results in the following errors: </p>

<pre><code>error: declaration of ‘compare’ as array of functions
   List* quickSort(List* originalList, ordinal compare[])
                                               ^
error: type of formal parameter 2 is incomplete
   List *prePivotElements = quickSort( getElements(originalList, compare[0]), compare );
   ^
error: type of formal parameter 2 is incomplete
   List *postPivotElements = quickSort ( getElements(originalList, compare[1]), compare );
   ^
</code></pre>

<p>To recap my question(s): Does C allow us to pass arrays of function pointers to other functions?  What about doing so recursively?  If it's allowed, what is the correct syntax? </p>

<p>Please pardon length of post, I'm sure one of you SO veterans would have been far more succinct!</p>

<p>(Regarding the SO rule that <code>all posted code must compile</code>: I thought that it made sense to stick to the conceptually relevant code in this case.  However, if folks prefer, I can post the full <code>.c</code> file and <code>.h</code> file.)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
As requested here are the relevant files for the working version of <code>quick_sort</code>.  I've also included the shell output, including commands for compiling/linking.  FYI, code-pad is giving some weird errors that don't make any sense (e.g., on lines with correct/compilable function headers, it's claiming that I'm missing a parenthesis):</p>

"1088833","1","","","2009-07-06 19:34:52","","8","3514","<p>I'm working on a project that involves drawing curved paths between two objects.  Currently, I've been writing some test code to play around with bezier curves and animation.  The first test is simply to move the endpoint (Point3) from the origin object (a rectangle) to the destination object (another rectangle), in a straight line.  here is the code which sets up the actual line:</p>

<pre><code>        connector = new Path();
        connector.Stroke = Brushes.Red;
        connector.StrokeThickness = 3;

        PathGeometry connectorGeometry = new PathGeometry();
        PathFigure connectorPoints = new PathFigure();
        connectorCurve = new BezierSegment();

        connectorPoints.StartPoint = new Point((double)_rect1.GetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty) + _rect1.Width / 2,
            (double)_rect1.GetValue(Canvas.TopProperty) + _rect1.Height / 2);
        connectorCurve.Point1 = connectorPoints.StartPoint;
        connectorCurve.Point2 = connectorPoints.StartPoint;
        connectorCurve.Point3 = connectorPoints.StartPoint;

        connectorPoints.Segments.Add(connectorCurve);
        connectorGeometry.Figures.Add(connectorPoints);
        connector.Data = connectorGeometry;
        MainCanvas.Children.Add(connector);
</code></pre>

<p>OK, so we now have a line collapsed to a point.  Now, lets animate that line, going from _rect1 to _rect2 (the two objects at the endpoints):</p>

<pre><code>        PointAnimation pointAnim = new PointAnimation();
        pointAnim.From = connectorCurve.Point3;
        pointAnim.To = new Point((double)_rect2.GetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty) + _rect2.Width / 2,
            (double)_rect2.GetValue(Canvas.TopProperty) + _rect2.Height / 2);
        pointAnim.Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
        board.Children.Add(pointAnim);
</code></pre>

<p>Works beautifully.  However, when I try to do it with a storyboard, I get nothing.  Here's the storyboarded code:</p>

<pre><code>        Storyboard board = new Storyboard();
        PointAnimation pointAnim = new PointAnimation();
        pointAnim.From = connectorCurve.Point3;
        pointAnim.To = new Point((double)_rect2.GetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty) + _rect2.Width / 2,
            (double)_rect2.GetValue(Canvas.TopProperty) + _rect2.Height / 2);
        pointAnim.Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

        Storyboard.SetTarget(pointAnim, connectorCurve);
        Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(pointAnim, new PropertyPath(BezierSegment.Point3Property));
        board.Children.Add(pointAnim);
        board.Begin();
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing moves.  I'm suspecting there is a problem with what I'm feeding SetTarget or SetTargetProperty, but can't seem to figure it out.  Does anyone have experience with animating line / bezier points in WPF?</p>

I have HTML Validator 0.8.6.1 which according to the help files should offer an option to check the web page after an AJAX request, however, this doesn't seem to be an option anywhere on the Mac version.</p>

<p>My approach is to get all of the code tidy and to standard on Firefox then test on other browsers on the basis that the better the code the more likely it is to work elsewhere.</p>

<p>So if there is a good plugin for Firefox, or Chrome on a Mac I would love toe know about it.</p>

<p>Thanks

<p>I am working in spring mvc project, which was developed by others and I am looking into it.</p>

<p>I want to have a page which needs to be accessed without login form in this existing project.</p>

<p>Whenever I called the following page <a href=""http://localhost:8080/myProject/mypage.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080/myProject/mypage.htm</a> it always goes to <a href=""http://localhost:8080/myProject/login.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080/myProject/login.htm</a> first and then I have to provide credentials to access that page. </p>

<p>Is it possible to visit that page without login action required?</p>

<p>In myPage.htm I have a form action to call that controller and DAO classes.</p>

<p>Also tiles has been used in this project.</p>

<p>Is there a mysqli fetch filter (correct term?) that will use the primary key from the result set if one exists as the array index value? In case my question is not clear it would result in something instead to his effect:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>It's not essential for the <code>type_id</code> values to be removed, but it would be super useful if the Primary Key could be used to index the array. I can do this with a fetch loop but I'm wondering if there is a simpler more elegant way of handling this.</p>

<p>I studied modules and classes in python. Now i want to make some operations using python and apt. I'm studying from : <a href=""http://apt.alioth.debian.org/python-apt-doc/library/apt.cache.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apt.alioth.debian.org/python-apt-doc/library/apt.cache.html</a>
However, i couldn't understand, the module is apt.cache, as shown in the top of the page. I expected that object should be created by writing apt.cache.Cache(), but object is created by writing apt.Cache(), as shown below. Why?</p>

<pre><code>    import apt
    import apt.progress

    # First of all, open the cache
    cache = apt.Cache()
    # Now, lets update the package list
    cache.update()
    # We need to re-open the cache because it needs to read the package list
    cache.open(None)
    # Now we can do the same as 'apt-get upgrade' does
    cache.upgrade()
    # or we can play 'apt-get dist-upgrade'
    cache.upgrade(True)
    # Q: Why does nothing happen?
    # A: You forgot to call commit()!
    cache.commit(apt.progress.TextFetchProgress(),
                 apt.progress.InstallProgress())
</code></pre>

<p>Second similar question is about below code, Cache class is imported from module apt.cache. I expected that object would be created by writing apt.cache.Cache(), but it is created by writing apt.Cache(). Why?</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; from apt.cache import FilteredCache, Cache, MarkedChangesFilter
    &gt;&gt;&gt; cache = apt.Cache()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; changed = apt.FilteredCache(cache)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; changed.set_filter(MarkedChangesFilter())
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print len(changed) == len(cache.get_changes()) # Both need to have same length
    True

"9396454","1","","","2012-02-22 14:11:28","","2","160","<p>I have a structural problem that I could use your help with. I'll explain the abstract problem first, then an example to illustrate the problem.</p>

<p>Consider an abstract class <b>A</b> holding a number of instances of an abstract class <b>B</b>, also assume the following methods in <b>A</b>: <b>void a.foo1(B val)</b> and <b>B a.foo2()</b>. The problem arises when we inherit the classes (<b>A'</b> inherits <b>A</b> and <b>B'</b> inherits <b>B</b>) and demand that the relation <b>A</b> has to <b>B</b> should be the same as <b>A'</b> has to <b>B'</b>. That is, in <b>A'</b>: <b>void a.foo1(B' val)</b> and <b>B' a.foo2()</b>. The second method will work, but not the first one (unless we do a unsafe type-cast). In other words, in <b>A'</b>: <b>a.foo1(B val)</b> should be illegal unless parameter is an instance of <b>B'</b>. I've tried to model this relationship with generics/templates with little sucess.</p>

<p>This problem arises when making a graph framework. Here we have classes <b>Graph</b> and <b>GraphVertex</b>. (In my actual implementation I overload GraphVertex's delete operator.) In C++:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt; class Graph; // Forward reference.

template&lt;class T&gt; class GraphVertex
{
    public:
        GraphVertex(Graph&lt;T&gt; &amp;graph) : m_graph(graph){}
        virtual ~GraphVertex() {}

        ... // Abstract methods, using T parameter.

        void remove()
        { m_graph.removeVertex(this); }
    protected:
        Graph&lt;T&gt; &amp;m_graph;
}

template&lt;class T&gt; class Graph
{
    public:
        virtual ~Graph(){}

        ...

        virtual GraphVertex&lt;T&gt; *add(T val) = 0;
        virtual void removeVertex(GraphVertex&lt;T&gt; *vertex) = 0; // &lt;--- !!!
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is the <b>removeVertex</b> method. Lets say we have implemented the classes with <b>AdjacencyMatrixGraph</b> and <b>AMGVertex</b>. When removing a vertex in the <b>AdjacencyMatrixGraph</b> we need more data than is provided in the abstract base class <b>GraphVertex</b>. We know that the parameter type <i>should</i> be <b>AMGVertex</b> but sending another type as parameter would not generate an (compile-time) error.</p>

<p>To solve this problem I've tried to add a new template parameter, specifying the implemented type. That is:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T, class G&gt; class GraphVertex
{
    public:
        GraphVertex(G &amp;graph) : m_graph(graph) {}
        ~GraphVertex() {}

        ...

        void remove() { m_graph.removeVertex(this); }

    protected:
        G &amp;m_graph;
}

template&lt;class T, class V&gt; class Graph
{
    public:
        virtual ~Graph() {}

        ...

        virtual V *add(T val) = 0;
        virtual void removeVertex(V *vertex) = 0;
}

template&lt;class T&gt; AdjacencyMatrixGraph; // Forward declaration.

template&lt;class T&gt; AMGVertex : public GraphVertex&lt;T, AdjacencyMatrixGraph&lt;T&gt;&gt;
{ ... }

template&lt;class T&gt; AdjacencyMatrixGraph : public Graph&lt;T, AMGVertex&lt;T&gt;&gt;
{ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>However, this will not work. It is not possible to use the base class <b>Graph</b> due to circular reference of the base classes.</p>

<pre><code>Graph&lt;int&gt; *p = new AdjacencyMatrixGraph&lt;int&gt;(); // Won't work.
</code></pre>

<p>The example above has the same problems in Java with generics.</p>

<p>So, is there anyway to model the relation in a type-safe way? Or am I stuck with casting pointers around?</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>An example usage of the above could look like:</p>

<pre><code>Graph&lt;int&gt; *someGraph = getSomeGraph();
GraphVertex&lt;int&gt; *newVertex = someGraph-&gt;add(3);
...
newVertex-&gt;remove();
</code></pre>

<p>I am using Sequence input and output files, and custom Writables.</p>

<p>The input is a list of triangles, maximum size 2Mb, but can be smaller around 50kb too.
The intermediate values and the output is a map(int,double) in the custom Writable.
Is this the bottleneck?</p>

<p>The problem is that the calculation is much slower than the version without hadoop. <strong>also, increasing the nodes from 2 to 10, doesn't speed up the process.</strong></p>

<p>One possibility is that I don't get enough mappers because of the small input size.
I made tests changing the <code>mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.maxsize</code>, but it just got worse, not better.</p>

<p>I am using hadoop 2.2.0 locally, and at amazon elastic mapreduce.</p>

<p>Did I overlook something? Or this is just the kind of task which should be done without hadoop? (it's my first time using mapreduce).</p>

<p>Explicitly adding the not null condition on either of the 2 sub children requires me to map the column, which still doesn't work even if I map it to some extraneous property. </p>

<p>None of the combinations of conditions for ""BothNullItem"" works either.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I am trying to implement this kind of pattern: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/MobileApps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/MobileApps</a> (Google have totally changed that page, so no longer makes sense - see the page I was referring to here: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20130822184827/https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/MobileApps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20130822184827/https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/MobileApps</a>)</p>

<p>Here is what I need to accompish:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web app has simple sign-in/sign-up forms that work with normal spring user/password authentication (have done this type of thing before with dao/authenticationmanager/userdetailsservice etc)</li>
<li>REST api endpoints that are stateless sessions and every request authenticated based ona token provided with the request</li>
</ul>

<p>(e.g. user logins/signs up using normal forms, webapp provides secure cookie with token that can then be used in following API requests)</p>

<p>I had a normal authentication setup as below:</p>

<pre><code>@Override protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .csrf()
            .disable()
        .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers(""/resources/**"").permitAll()
            .antMatchers(""/mobile/app/sign-up"").permitAll()
            .antMatchers(""/v1/**"").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
        .formLogin()
            .loginPage(""/"")
            .loginProcessingUrl(""/loginprocess"")
            .failureUrl(""/?loginFailure=true"")
            .permitAll();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was thinking of adding a pre-auth filter, that checks for the token in the request and then sets the security context (would that mean that the normal following authentication would be skipped?), however, beyond the normal user/password I have not done too much with token based security, but based on some other examples I came up with the following:</p>

<p>Security Config:</p>

<pre><code>@Override protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf()
                .disable()
            .addFilter(restAuthenticationFilter())
                .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS).and()
                .exceptionHandling().authenticationEntryPoint(new Http403ForbiddenEntryPoint()).and()
                .antMatcher(""/v1/**"")
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers(""/resources/**"").permitAll()
                .antMatchers(""/mobile/app/sign-up"").permitAll()
                .antMatchers(""/v1/**"").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage(""/"")
                .loginProcessingUrl(""/loginprocess"")
                .failureUrl(""/?loginFailure=true"")
                .permitAll();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>My custom rest filter:</p>

<pre><code>public class RestAuthenticationFilter extends AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter {

    public RestAuthenticationFilter(String defaultFilterProcessesUrl) {
        super(defaultFilterProcessesUrl);
    }

    private final String HEADER_SECURITY_TOKEN = ""X-Token""; 
    private String token = """";


    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest) req;
        HttpServletResponse response = (HttpServletResponse) res;

        this.token = request.getHeader(HEADER_SECURITY_TOKEN);

        //If we have already applied this filter - not sure how that would happen? - then just continue chain
        if (request.getAttribute(FILTER_APPLIED) != null) {
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
            return;
        }

        //Now mark request as completing this filter
        request.setAttribute(FILTER_APPLIED, Boolean.TRUE);

        //Attempt to authenticate
        Authentication authResult;
        authResult = attemptAuthentication(request, response);
        if (authResult == null) {
            unsuccessfulAuthentication(request, response, new LockedException(""Forbidden""));
        } else {
            successfulAuthentication(request, response, chain, authResult);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Attempt to authenticate request - basically just pass over to another method to authenticate request headers 
     */
    @Override public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws AuthenticationException, IOException, ServletException {
        AbstractAuthenticationToken userAuthenticationToken = authUserByToken();
        if(userAuthenticationToken == null) throw new AuthenticationServiceException(MessageFormat.format(""Error | {0}"", ""Bad Token""));
        return userAuthenticationToken;
    }


    /**
     * authenticate the user based on token, mobile app secret &amp; user agent
     * @return
     */
    private AbstractAuthenticationToken authUserByToken() {
        AbstractAuthenticationToken authToken = null;
        try {
            // TODO - just return null - always fail auth just to test spring setup ok
            return null;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error(""Authenticate user by token error: "", e);
        }
        return authToken;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The above actually results in an error on app startup saying: <code>authenticationManager must be specified</code>
Can anyone tell me how best to do this - is a pre_auth filter the best way to do this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I wrote up what I found and how I did it with Spring-security (including the code) implementing a standard token implementation (not OAuth)</p>

In Active Directory that information is stored in a bit-register in an attribute called userAccessControl as a HEX-Value. In our Windows 2008 Server R1, that is 0x10200 for an enabled account with the option that a users password never expires, or 0x10202 for a disabled account with the option that a users password never expires.</p>

<p>Now to just touch the flag for the enabled/disabled information, I wrote the following method... </p>

<pre><code>def set_account_active_flag(activate)
  success = false
  get_aduser if @aduser.nil?
  puts ""#####################################""
  unless @uac.nil? || @uac.blank?
    tmpuac = @uac.to_i
    tmpuac = activate ? tmpuac &amp; 2 == 0 ? tmpuac | 2
                                        : tmpuac
                      : tmpuac &amp; 2 == 2 ? tmpuac ^ 2
                                        : tmpuac
    ldap_con = self.class.initialize_ldap_con
    # success = ldap_con.replace_attribute ldap_encode(@dn), :userAccountControl, tmpuac


   success = ldap_con.replace_attribute ldap_encode(@dn), :userAccountControl, ldap_encode(tmpuac.to_s)
  else
    puts ""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\nuserAccessControl-Register is not available\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;""
  end
rescue Net::LDAP::LdapError =&gt; e
  puts ""NET::LDAP::LdapError\n#{e}""
ensure
  puts ""-------------------------------------""
  puts ""LDAP operation failed (#{ldap_con.get_operation_result.code}):""
  puts ""-------------------------------------""
  puts ldap_con.get_operation_result.message
  puts ""#####################################""
  return success
end
</code></pre>

<p>ok... internals: </p>

<ul>
<li>get_aduser is just a method that loads a set of ad-attributes (['dn','userPrincipalName', 'givenname','sn', 'mail', 'memberof', 'userAccountControl']) and stores them into instance-variables of the user trying to login (@dn, @user_principal_name, @first_name, @last_name, @groups, @uac)</li>
</ul>

<p>That part works like a charm. @uac (returened as a string), I can transform to an integer</p>

<pre><code>x = @uac.to_i
</code></pre>

<p>and then use that as a bit-register to check and modify flags</p>

<pre><code>x &amp;  2 # =&gt; 0 if unset, =&gt; 1 if set
x |= 2 # sets the flag
x ^= 2 # unsets the flag
</code></pre>

<p>That working I thought it as easy as to just write back that value to my Active Directory.</p>

<p>There comes my Problem:
So far I tried to write back the new userAccountControl value as <strong>integer</strong> and as <strong>string</strong>, but both attempts fail, although the operation-result-message in both cases is {Code:0, Message:'Success'}</p>

<p>Trying to write back the new userAccessControl value as <strong>integer</strong> raises NET::LDAP::LdapError</p>

<pre><code>#####################################
NET::LDAP::LdapError 
response missing or invalid
-------------------------------------
LDAP operation failed (0):
-------------------------------------
Success
#####################################
=&gt; false 
</code></pre>

<p>Trying to write back the new userAccessControl value as <strong>string</strong> does not raise an error but still results in false</p>

<pre><code>#####################################
-------------------------------------
LDAP operation failed (0):
-------------------------------------
Success
#####################################
=&gt; false 
</code></pre>

<p>So I wonder, 'What am I doing wrong?'</p>

<p>Does anybody know how to write back userAccessControl to ActiveDirectory?</p>

<p>Do I have to transform the new userAccessControl-Value using something like that awkward algorithm needed to write back a user-password?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance for any useful hint or even a solution.</p>

<p>But my actual use-case has many new columns and different types of calculations that I want to calculate in the <code>ddply</code> function. So I want to do something like:</p>

<pre><code># here's a simple version of a function that I want to send to ddply    
func &lt;- ""am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)""

# here's how I imagine it might work
lapply(list.1, function(x)   ddply(x, .(d), function(x)  data.frame(func)) )

# not the desired outcome... 
$df1
  d                                     func
1 a am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)
2 b am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)
3 c am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)
4 d am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)

$df2
  d                                     func
1 e am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)
2 f am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)
3 g am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)

$df3
  d                                     func
1 h am=mean(x$a), bm=mean(x$b), cm=mean(x$c)

<p>I've tried <code>noquote</code>, <code>deparse</code>, <code>eval(as.symbol())</code>, <code>do.call(data.frame, ...)</code> and some of the methods here: <a href=""https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/Evaluation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/Evaluation</a> on <code>func</code> to no avail. The solution might be obvious at this point (ie. melt everything!), but in case it's not, here's a longer example that's closer to my use case:</p>

<pre><code># sample data
s &lt;- 23 # number of samples
r &lt;- 10 # number of runs per sample
el &lt;- 17 # number of elements
mydata &lt;- data.frame(ID = unlist(lapply(LETTERS[1:s], function(x) rep(x, r))),
                     run = rep(1:r, s))
# insert fake element data
mydata[letters[1:el]] &lt;- lapply(1:el, function(i) rnorm(s*r, runif(1)*i^2))

# generate all combinations of 5 runs from  ten runs
su &lt;- 5 # number of runs to sample from ten runs
idx &lt;- combn(unique(mydata$run), su)

# RSE function
RSE &lt;- function(x) {100*( (sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)))/mean(x) )}

# make a list of dfs for all samples for each combination of five runs
# to prepare to calculate RSEs
combys1 &lt;- lapply(1:ncol(idx), function(i) mydata[mydata$run %in% idx[,i],] )

# make a list of dfs with RSE for each ID, for each combination of runs
combys2 &lt;- lapply(1:length(combys1), function(i) ddply(combys1[[i]], ""ID"", summarise, RSEa=RSE(a), RSEb=RSE(b), RSEc=RSE(c), meana=mean(a), meanb=mean(b), meanc=mean(c)))
</code></pre>

<p>I want to replace <code>RSEa=RSE(a), RSEb=RSE(b), RSEc=RSE(c), meana=mean(a), meanb=mean(b), meanc=mean(c)</code> in the last line above with the object <code>doRSE</code> from here, to avoid lots of typing:</p>

<pre><code># prepare to calculate new colums with RSE and means
RSEs &lt;- sapply(3:ncol(mydata), function(j) paste0(""RSE"",names(mydata[j]))) 
RSExs &lt;- sapply(3:ncol(mydata), function(j) paste0(""RSE("",names(mydata[j]),"")"")) 
doRSE &lt;- paste0(sapply(1:length(RSEs), function(x) paste0(RSEs[x],""="",RSExs[x])), collapse="","", sep="""")
</code></pre>

<p>I'm open to solutions involving base, <code>data.table</code> and dirty tricks. Seems like these are close to what I want, but I can't quite translate them to my problem:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13339157/pass-character-argument-and-evaluate?rq=1"">Pass character argument and evaluate</a>, 
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13781881/force-evaluation-of-multiple-variables-using-vector-of-character?rq=1"">Force evaluation of multiple variables using vector of character</a>, 
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10232195/using-a-vector-of-characters-that-correspond-to-an-expression-as-an-argument-to"">Using a vector of characters that correspond to an expression as an argument to a function</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Here's the catch: I want to be able to modify the <code>func</code> in the simple example (or <code>doRSE</code> in my use-case) to create a bunch of new columns that result from various calculations on the existing columns to explore the data. I want a workflow that allows the resulting dataframes to have new columns that were not in the original dataframes. Sorry that wasn't more clear in the original question. I can't see how to adapt @Marius' answer to do this, but @mnel's is helpful (see update below) </p>

<p>Working through @mnel's excellent dirty tricks, with some minor fixes I can get the desired result on my use-case:</p>

<pre><code># @mnel's solution, adapted (no period before eval)
combys2 &lt;- lapply(combys1, function(x) do.call(ddply,c(.data = quote(x), 
                           .variables = quote(.(ID)), .fun = quote(summarize),
                           eval(parse(text = sprintf('.(%s)', doRSE ))))))
head(combys2)

<p>Just take a case:</p>

<pre><code>RelativeLayout myLayout = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.myrlLayout);
//Adding now 100 Buttons with 100 TextViews below each Button(just a example)
for(i=0;i&lt;100;i++) {
    Button btn = new Button(this);
    btn.setId(i+1); //Should be a positive integer
    //set LayoutParams for Button
    RelativeLayout.Layoutparams btn_layoutparams = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams....
    ....
    myLayout.addView(btn, btn_layoutparams);
    TextView mytv = new TextView(this);
    mytv.setid(101+i);
    //set LayoutParams for Button with referenced to the Button(because the Textview Needs to be
    of Button)
    ....
    myLayout.addView(mytv, tv-layoutparams);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding to the high amount of Views programmatically created, my app starts really slow...
I think it's not because of creating a new View, but because of setting the LayoutParamters each time for the view. I can't find a Workaround because my LayoutParams for the TextView for example Need to reference to the button created before. Due to that i'm not really able to create a XML-layout-file or XML-style-file because i can't reference the tv's layoutparameters anchor in the XML-file to the button which does not exist at the Moment. At least i didn't find a way. I hope somebody got an idea how to appreciable improve the Performance when creating such a amount of views at runtime. Every advise is welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Update regarding answere from rom4ek</strong></p>

<p>The Problem is, that i Need to calculate how much views can i add per row before the Screen-width is fully used. That means i Need second LayoutParams to add the next Button below the first Button from the first row. And i also Need to reference to the img-Button added before in the LayoutParams.. so it's not possible to reference LayoutParams to a Button which doesn't exist before the for-loop.Maybe i completely miss something.. Do you have an idea/solution? Thank you for your respond.</p>

In my app I actually need synchronous sockets because I handle all communication in background myself on a different level. So I try to write wrapper around AsyncSocket class SyncSocket. Here is code:</p>

<pre><code>// SyncSocket.h

@synthesize waiting = _waiting;
@synthesize nsLog = _nsLog;

//

    _connectTimeout = connectTimeout;
    _readTimeout = readTimeout;
    _writeTimeout = writeTimeout;
    _waiting = NO;

    _asyncSocket = [[AsyncSocket alloc] initWithDelegate: self];

    return self;
}

    [_asyncSocket release];
    [super dealloc];

        return NO;

    while (self.waiting &amp;&amp; [_asyncSocket isConnected] == NO) {

<p>The problem is: AsyncSocket connects to the host just fine, but my delegate didConnetToHost is never called. And if I debug AsyncSocket code I can see that even though delegate is set <code>respondsToSelector</code> fails. Looks like there is some strange memory violation or something but I have no idea where did I do mistake. </p>

<p>Any ideas? Is there a good example on how to wrap AsyncSocket to be synchronous socket?  </p>

<p>PS: Just to be clear: XCode 3.2.5, iPhone Simulator 4.2.</p>

<p>Update: The reason I'm trying to wrap it with SyncSocket is because I wanted to hide all socket delegate stuff from business logic of application. I need to use socket connection in many different places and I don't want to implement low level socket functions (like detecting state of the socket, receiving header of the message then body etc) in many different places. I want to have simple interface where I can open/send/receive and don't worry about low level implementation. I do understand that network connectivity should be run in separate thread and that's fine - making one background worker in the main thread is not a problem. </p>

<p>So I took InterfaceTest sample from AsyncSocket repository as a starting point. Removed DNS related stuff from there. Works fine. didConnect get called, everything is shiny. </p>

<p>I added then to the project my SyncSocket implementation to see what's wrong with it. Project can be downloaded here: <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6402890/NetworkTest.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6402890/NetworkTest.zip</a> - may be somebody can tell me what I'm doing wrong - I got a feeling that I'm not using threads properly in SyncSocket. </p>

<p>If I use in waiting loop both <code>asyncSocket is Connected</code> and my internal <code>self.waiting</code> - it gets out of that loop and <code>didConnect</code> is called (but AFTER the loop is finished). If I try to use only my <code>self.waiting</code> which is set in didConnect - <code>didConnect</code> never called and application hangs. </p>

<p>Anybody can tell me what's wrong? </p>

In this field I'm loading a CSV file. From the CSV (contains a column of emails) I'm extracting the data using <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/jquery-csv/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/jquery-csv/</a> and add it to a select readonly multiple field with all options selected.</p>

<p>Note: I've created the form using Form Types (by the Symfony2 book) - <code>class NotificationType extends AbstractType</code>; The form is submitted through AJAX;</p>

<p><strong><em>1. Strike one</em></strong>
Taking into account that the select field is being populated dynamically, I've decided <strong>not</strong> to add it to the form builder but to inject it using JavaScript.</p>

<p>It was a bad move, because when submitting the form, Symfony2 validates that the fields added in the form builder are the exact ones that are submitted. The error returned is: <em>This form should not contain extra fields</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>2. Strike two</em></strong>
Moving on from strike one I wanted to see if I can work around that, so I added the select field in the form builder but without options, also injecting the options via JavaScript.</p>

<p>Still no luck. Symfony2 also makes sure you can't submit an option that was not added to the form builder when adding the field. The error returned is: <em>This value is not valid</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>3. Strike three</em></strong> 
From Strike 1 and 2, I'm guessing that the only way to make this work would be to add all possible options in the form builder in the choices array when adding the field. This way the field and options would be valid for submit.</p>

<p>But this is not something I would consider a viable option, especially because in the select field I'm expecting 10000 possible results which I'm not aware of until I'm loading the CSV file.</p>

<p>Can you suggest any other approach for this one?</p>

The method packages the snippet in an html wrapper which adds things like the DTD, and html, head, and body tags to form a complete html document. The documentation (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/</a>) suggests that HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile() works differently. It suggests that in the later case the relevant file contains the ENTIRE html code and the method does not add a wrapper.  Experimentation reveals that the later works like the former in that a wrapper is added. My question is this: Is there some way to return a snippet of html code (i.e., no wrapper) from an app-script?

<p>This is how I enable transparency:</p>

<pre><code>this.gl.blendFunc(this.gl.SRC_ALPHA, this.gl.ONE);
this.gl.enable(this.gl.BLEND);
this.gl.disable(this.gl.DEPTH_TEST);

I have created a sample project using Jboss tool plug-in of eclipse and deployed via eclipse.<br><br>
I didn't install maven separately, it came with above plug-in I guess.<br><br>
As per my knowledge maven download all required JAR files that mentioned in .pom file in to local repository. In my case .m2\repository\ location.<br><br>
But I don't understand how Jboss refer this location when it runs individually in a production server. There we don't have  any eclipse or jboss tool.<br><br>
I checked .pom file in deployed project and still I didn't notice any location reference.
Technically I cannot understand how this works. It's really helpful if someone can explain bit further.<br><br>
My question is, if I upload my project to a different Jboss in a different server, will it automatically down load all required JARs that mentioned in .pom file when deploying? If yes what is the location? How can I change that location?<br><br>
What  is the exact procedure I have to follow when setup a production kind of environment (subject to maven repository)  ?<br><br>
Just copy my Jboss along with deployed project to production environment, then can I expect Jboss and project .pom file take care of JARs and dependencies?<br><br>
or  do I need to install and configure maven and repository in production environment?
What I understood may incorrect at all. It's really appreciate if you can help me on this.<br><br></p>

      &lt;!--and again the whole block above for each columns...--&gt;

    &lt;/wpftk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
  &lt;/wpftk:DataGrid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to achieve is to bind the value at the <code>DataGridTemplateColumn</code> level and propagate it to the template level. Anyone know how to do that?</p>

<p>What I tried to do is something like that:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;wpftk:DataGrid ItemsSource=""{Binding Tests}"" AutoGenerateColumns=""False""&gt;

    &lt;wpftk:DataGrid.Resources&gt;
      &lt;DataTemplate x:Key=""CustomCellTemplate""&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding}""/&gt;
      &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
      &lt;DataTemplate x:Key=""CustomCellEditingTemplate""&gt;
        &lt;TextBox Text=""{Binding}""&gt;&lt;/TextBox&gt;
      &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/wpftk:DataGrid.Resources&gt;

    &lt;wpftk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
      &lt;wpftk:DataGridTemplateColumn Header=""Start Date"" Binding=""{Binding StartDate}"" CellTemplate=""{StaticResource CustomCellTemplate}"" CellEditingTemplate=""{StaticResource CustomCellEditingTemplate}""/&gt;
      &lt;wpftk:DataGridTemplateColumn Header=""End Date"" Binding=""{Binding EndDate}"" CellTemplate=""{StaticResource CustomCellTemplate}"" CellEditingTemplate=""{StaticResource CustomCellEditingTemplate}""/&gt;
    &lt;/wpftk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
  &lt;/wpftk:DataGrid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the binding porperty is not a valid property of the <code>DataGridTemplateColumn</code> but maybe by playing with the datacontext and some relative source could do the trick but frankly I can't find a way to implement that.</p>

<p>Not sure if what I want is possible and i'm willing to accept a ""no way you can do that"" as an answer</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The <code>TextBlock</code>/<code>TextBox</code> in the template is just for test (the real template is much more complex) <code>DataGridTextColumn</code> will not do the trick
Thanks in advance</p>

<p>So what I have is the following command that I want to run in cmd:</p>

<pre><code>xcopy /q C:\fileName.txt \\VMNAME\C$\destFolder /Y /E
</code></pre>

<p>But I need it to be executed with certain credentials. So what I was doing manually is entering the below command first:</p>

<pre><code>runas /user:&lt;domainName&gt;\&lt;userName&gt; cmd
</code></pre>

<p>That was opening a separate cmd window and I was running the first (<code>xcopy</code>) command in that window.</p>

<p>What I have at the moment:</p>

<pre><code>string strCmdText = string.Format(@""xcopy /q {0} {1} /Y /E"", source, destination);

ProcessStartInfo procStartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo();

procStartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;
procStartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
procStartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
procStartInfo.FileName = ""runas"";
procStartInfo.Arguments = String.Format(@""/user:&lt;domainName&gt;\&lt;userName&gt; cmd "" + strCmdText);

Process.Start(procStartInfo);
</code></pre>

<p>Where the <code>source</code> and <code>destination</code> are of the below structure:</p>

<pre><code> source = ""C:\\somePath\\fileName.txt""
 destination = ""\\\\&lt;VMName&gt;\\C$\\somePath\\""
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried defining <code>procStartInfo</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>procStartInfo.Verb = ""runas"";
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>procStartInfo.FileName = ""runas"";
</code></pre>

<p>With similar results.</p>

<p>At the moment, when I run the above code, it does not return any error but doesn't do what's expected either. Am I missing something or this approach is wrong?</p>

<p>Huge thanks to Kuffs for getting me in the right direction.</p>

<p>The key to this is in what Kuffs points to in the manifest:</p>

<p>The problem is when data becomes available (for instance) in the real socket, it will have to go through a lot of processing, so if select points to the real socket fd, app will be blocked a lot of time.

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/2hXu3.png"" alt=""Interface""></p>

<p>Currently, the plugin inserts the following HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div title=""Dynamic Element: E-Cards (sidebar)"" class=""dynamicelement ecards-sidebar""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The snippet of Javascript in my plugin that accomplishes the actual insertion of these placeholders is this:</p>

<pre><code>function insertNewDiv() {
    var divNode = oEditor.FCK.EditorDocument.createElement('div');
    oEditor.FCK.InsertElement(divNode);
    oEditor.FCK.Focus();
    oEditor.FCK.Events.FireEvent('OnSelectionChange');
    return divNode;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To make it look nice in the FCKeditor window, I'm applying some CSS to the FCKeditor window, including the following, that writes the title in there:</p>

<pre><code>.dynamicelement:before {
    content: attr(title);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, other than the styling, FCKeditor treats these <code>div</code> elements no differently than any other <code>div</code> element in its window. This is not good for me. </p>

<p><strong>I need these placeholders to have the following traits:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Insertion of content into the placeholder is not allowed.</li>
<li>Clicking it should select it as a whole. </li>
<li>Tapping the delete key when it's selected should delete it.</li>
<li>The only way to edit it (apart from deleting it) is to select it, then click the toolbar button to open an edit dialog.</li>
<li>It should always be considered a block-level element</li>
<li>It doesn't matter if the HTML output uses a custom tag name or not (<code>&lt;dynamicelement&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;div class=""dynamicelement""&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Does the FCKeditor API provide a way to give it command like, ""Treat every element that matches the selector 'div.dynamicelement' the following way: ..."" ?</p>

<p>Also, is there another FCKeditor plugin that does a similar thing that I can refer to that I might have overlooked in my research?</p>

<p>EDIT: By the way, I already know about CKeditor. I'm using FCKeditor for a couple of reasons: it's working for my CMS, the configuration options I'm using are perfect for my clients (except, obviously, for the placeholder thing), etc..</p>

<p>EDIT : I changed the conditional to</p>

<p>Line 215 happens to be the if conditional itself.</p>

<p>Even after the change, the error persists.</p>

But the problem is after running for a few times (20ish) it throws error. </p>

<p>The code: </p>

<pre><code>public class TestConnection {

<p>And the error it throws is </p>

<pre><code>ORA-12519, TNS:no appropriate service handler found

<p>Important to note, if I run this just once - not 100 times as shown in the code snippet above - it works absolutely fine. If I run it 100 times, it runs for a few time (20 - 25 times) and then exits with the error shown above. For example the snippet shows that many connections were open and were successfully closed, but immediately after that it starts throwing error. </p>

However, I found out that if I selected more than 20 images, I will start to get memory low warning and the app exited. Here is my code of the conversion</p>

<pre><code>for(int i =0 ; i &lt; [self.selectedPictures count] ; i++)
{
    NSLog(@""Object %d"",i);
    ALAsset *asset = [self.selectedPictures objectAtIndex:i];
    ALAssetRepresentation *rep = [asset defaultRepresentation];
    CGImageRef iref = [rep fullResolutionImage];
    UIImage *anImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:iref scale:[rep scale] orientation:(UIImageOrientation)[rep orientation]];
    float newHeight = anImage.size.height / (anImage.size.width / 1280);

    UIImage *resizedImage = [anImage resizedImageWithContentMode:UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit bounds:CGSizeMake(newHeight, 1280.f) interpolationQuality:kCGInterpolationHigh];

    UIImage *resizedThumbnailImage = [anImage resizedImageWithContentMode:UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill bounds:CGSizeMake(290.0f, 300.f) interpolationQuality:kCGInterpolationHigh];

    // JPEG to decrease file size and enable faster uploads &amp; downloads
    NSData *imageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(resizedImage, 0.6f);
    //NSData *thumbnailImageData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(thumbnailImage);
    NSData *thumbnailImageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(resizedThumbnailImage, 0.6f);

    PFFile *thumbnailFile = [PFFile fileWithData:thumbnailImageData];

}

<p>So i figured out that I should add CGImageRelease(iref); after anImage to release the iref, and the memory warning is gone. However, my app will crash after the last asset is converted to UIImage. And so far i could not find out why it is crashing.</p>

<p>From what I understand is that apparently an element with a non-matching namespace is returned. However, the namespace: <code>http://www.ups.com/schema/xpci/1.0/error</code> is nowhere to be found in my project.
The weird thing is, I am using the same wsdl, xsd's etc. in a spring project, which works fine. When I am using the same in servicemix, then I get the exception described above.</p>

<p><strong>In the wsdl, the following schema's are defined:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;wsdl:types&gt;
    &lt;xsd:schema&gt;
        &lt;!-- This schema defines the UPS Security header used for authorization purposes --&gt;
        &lt;xsd:import namespace=""http://www.ups.com/XMLSchema/XOLTWS/UPSS/v1.0"" schemaLocation=""UPSSecurity.xsd""/&gt;
        &lt;!--  This schema defines the error detail data types returned within SOAPFaults to provide more specific information pertaining to the problem. --&gt;
        &lt;xsd:import namespace=""http://www.ups.com/XMLSchema/XOLTWS/Error/v1.1"" schemaLocation=""Error1.1.xsd""/&gt;

    &lt;/xsd:schema&gt;
&lt;/wsdl:types&gt;

<p><strong>I have defined the following configuration for the endpoint etc.</strong></p>

<p>This works correctly in both a local dev environment and a ci environment when using the ""default"" bucket name and no password as the authentication.</p>

<p>Moving beyond the example, I want to make use of a different bucket and ultimately make use of a password.</p>

<p>When I create a new bucket (named ""test_bucket""), and update the property injected into the CouchbaseConfig (extends AbstractCouchbaseConfiguration) to use this new bucket inplace of the ""default"" I get the following exception when running the unit tests.</p>

<p>I also tried adding a password to the creation script and adding the same password (""psswd"" string in both cases) to the properties used in the CouchbaseConfig but get the same exception shown below.</p>

<p>So is it possible to use another bucket than ""default"" (and its no-authorisation required) and how do I configure a password for use on this bucket ?</p>

<p>I have verified that the bucket(s) and the expected views have been created correctly in couchbase from the Admin GUI.</p>

Getting properties from the plugin worked well but when I tried to

I thought maybe something is wrong with the example, so I wrote my own basic scriptable plugin that has one property and one method which returns a string.
The property worked well, but calling the method caused Firefox to freeze, again.</p>

I tried debugging the plugin and everything seems fine. All the right

But soon I found out that it lacked badly the ability to perform CPU-intensive tasks. So, I started googling and got these answers to solve the problem: Fibers, Webworkers and Threads (thread-a-gogo). Now which one to use is a confusion and one of them definitely needs to be used - afterall what's the purpose of having a server which is just good at IO and nothing else? Suggestions needed!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I was thinking of a way off-late; just needing suggestions over it. Now, what I thought of was this: Let's have some threads (using thread_a_gogo or maybe webworkers). Now, when we need more of them, we can create more. But there will be some limit over the creation process. (not implied by the system but probably because of overhead). Now, when we exceed the limit, we can fork a new node, and start creating threads over it. This way, it can go on till we reach some limit (after all, processes too have a big overhead). When this limit is reached, we start queuing tasks. Whenever a thread becomes free, it will be assigned a new task. This way, it can go on smoothly.</p>

<p>So, that was what I thought of. Is this idea good? I am a bit new to all this process and threads stuff, so don't have any expertise in it. Please share your opinions.</p>

<p>Thanks. :)</p>

<p>However, something is not quite right with my code below! The two lines <code>$query1-&gt;bindValue(2, $recipename);</code> and <code>$query2-&gt;bindValue(1, $recipename);</code> are not working properly, as they are not actually binding anything to the corresponding question marks in the SQL statement. I believe that the SQL is correct as when I replace these <code>$recipename</code> variables in the lines above with a string such as 'Tuna Pasta', the whole function works perfectly. I have also used var_dump on this variable to ensure that it does actually contain a string.</p>

<ul>

<p>I am currently using modernizr script as a fallback for older IE versions which swaps the svg to a png extension.</p>

<p>The only problem is that I am using widths to control the svg sizes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""img/testing.svg"" width=""200px""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(but in the long run I won't be putting the width there I will be putting it in CSS for media queries for it to scale up and down)</p>

<p>At the moment I am using this modernizr script:</p>

<pre><code>if(!Modernizr.svg) {
  $('img[src*=""svg""]').attr('src', function() {
      return $(this).attr('src').replace('.svg', '.png');
  });
}

<p>That was working great as I tested it in Ie and it was swapping it out no problem, but one thing I did notice is that if for example my png is ""200px wide"" and in my css I have stated the svg version to be ""400px wide"" - it is scaling my png up which is resulting in blurring.</p>

<p>I guess my question is how do I stop the png from scaling up beyond its original size to prevent pixelation? </p>

<p>Or alternatively is there a better way of dealing with svg's and png fallbacks?</p>

<ul>
<li>tens of thousands of users</li>
<li>multiple clients per user (phone, tablet, desktop)</li>
<li>millions of rows per table (continually growing)</li>
</ul>

<p>Azure SQL will be the central data store which will be exposed via Web API.  The clients will include a web application and a number of native apps including iOS, Android, Mac, Windows 8, etc.  The web application will require an “always on” connection and will not have a local data store but will instead retrieve and update via the api - think CRUD via RESTful API. </p>

<p>All other clients (phone, tablet, desktop) will have a local db (SQLite).  On first use of this type of client the user must authenticate and sync.  Once authenticated and synced, these clients can operate in an offline mode (creating, deleting and updating records in the local SQLite db).  These changes will eventually sync with the Azure backend.  </p>

<p>The distributed nature of the databases leaves us with a primary key problem and the reason for asking this question.</p>

<p>Here is what we have considered thus far:</p>

<p><strong>GUID</strong></p>

<p>Each client creates it’s own keys.  On sync, there is a very small chance for a duplicate key but we would need to account for it by writing functionality into each client to update all relationships with a new key. GUIDs are big and when multiple foreign keys per table are considered, storage may become an issue over time.  Likely the biggest problem is the random nature of GUIDs which means that they can not (or should not) be used as the clustered index due to fragmentation.  This means we would need to create a clustered index (perhaps arbitrary) for each table.</p>

<p><strong>Identity</strong></p>

<p>Each client creates it’s own primary keys.  On sync, these keys are replaced with server generated keys.  This adds additional complexity to the syncing process and forces each client to “fix” their keys including all foreign keys on related tables. </p>

<p><strong>Composite</strong></p>

<p>Each client is assigned a client id on first sync.  This client id is used in conjunction with a local auto-incrementing id as a composite primary key for each table.  This composite key will be unique so there should be no conflicts on sync but it does mean that most tables will require a composite primary key.  Performance and query complexity is the concern here.</p>

<p><strong>HiLo (Merged Composite)</strong></p>

<p>Like the composite approach, each client is assigned a client id (int32) on the first sync The client id is merged with a unique local id (int32) into a single column to make an application wide unique id (int64).  This should result in no conflicts during sync.  While there is more order to these keys vs GUIDs since the ids generated by each client are sequential, there will be thousands of unique client-ids, so do we still run the risk of fragmentation on our clustered index? </p>

<p>Are we overlooking something?  Are there any other approaches worth investigating?  A discussion of the pros and cons of each approach would be quite helpful.</p>

<p>Right-o! I want to do that. But what I would like to know is: <strong>is there a gem out there to help me build this REST API</strong>? If so, I could save time and use it instead of reinventing the wheel myself (and misinterpreting the conventions). Alternatively, I could set about developing such a framework as a separate gem!</p>

<li><a href=""https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails</a> (seems focused on managing the javascript side and asset pipeline)</li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/dgeb/ember_data_example"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dgeb/ember_data_example</a>  (more an example app than a framework?)</li>

<p><strong>Problems are how to keep it on the masking format 99-99-99-99-[repeat format until last inputed number] ? :</strong> <br />
1. If the user is pressing delete, or backspace, the  will be changed. How to keep the masking format stand still ?<br />
eg : <br />
Input : press 1234567890, move arrow left to 4, press delete, press 8, and move to the last line and press 12<br />
My wrong result : 12-38-56-78-90-1-2<br />
Correct result : 12-38-56-78-90-12-<br />
<br />
2. If the user press the number in very fast, the input mask will be come weird... Sometimes it can become 999-9-99-99-99- and other masking format. Did not give me the desired masking format.. It should be still with the masking format : 99-99-99-99-[repeat format until last inputed number]. How to fix my current script ?<br /><br />
Eg:<br />
Input : pres 123 in quick <br />
My wrong result : 123-<br />
Correct result : 12-3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any idea how to fix my script ?<br />

<p>Here is what I have so far:</p>

It seems like clunky procedural code to give all my JPanel constructors a parameter referring to the JFrame. So some research uncovered SwingUtilities.getAncestorOfClass, which looked like the solution. But I cannot understand why it returns null when I try to use it to get a reference to the JFrame in my JPanel code. </p>

<p>To give you an idea, here is code for the main JFrame, which also creates a ViewPanel and plonks that in the JFrame:</p>

<pre><code>import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;

public class SDA {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                SDAMainViewPanel sdaMainViewPanel = new SDAMainViewPanel();
                JFrame frame = new JFrame(""SDApp"");
                frame.setSize(400, 400);
                frame.setContentPane(sdaMainViewPanel);
                frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);                    
                frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);                
                frame.setVisible(true);
            }
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my code for the ViewPanel, which, when you press the button ""Try Me"", results in a NullPointerException, because the call to SwingUtilities.getAncestorOfClass for the ViewPanel is a null call. </p>

<pre><code>import javax.swing.JPanel;
import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class SDAMainViewPanel extends JPanel {

    public SDAMainViewPanel() {
        initComponents();
    }

    private void initComponents() {
        getAncClass = new JButton(""Try me"");
        // This is null even though there IS an Ancestor JFrame!?!?
        final JFrame parent = (JFrame)SwingUtilities.getAncestorOfClass(JFrame.class, this);
        getAncClass.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {                
                parent.getContentPane().removeAll();

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>According to this <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Concurrency/jobs-api.html"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> under ""Providing Feedback about Jobs"" the only thing you need to set is <code>job.setUser(true);</code> to get a progress dialog.
But this does not work for me.</p>

<p>To reproduce the problem I created a new Eclipse4 project with sample content and modified the created AboutHandler:</p>

<pre><code>import org.eclipse.core.runtime.*;

public class AboutHandler
{

  public void execute(Shell shell)
  {
    Job j = new YourThread(10);
    j.setUser(true);
    j.schedule();
  }

  private static class YourThread extends Job
  {
    private int workload;

    public YourThread(int workload)
    {
      super(""Test"");
      this.workload = workload;
    }

    @Override
    public IStatus run(IProgressMonitor monitor)
   {
      // Tell the user what you are doing
      monitor.beginTask(""Copying files"", workload);

      // Do your work
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workload; i++)
      {
        // Optionally add subtasks
        monitor.subTask(""Copying file "" + (i + 1) + "" of "" + workload + ""..."");
        System.out.println(""Copying file "" + (i + 1) + "" of "" + workload + ""..."");

       try
        {
          Thread.sleep(2000);
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e)
        {
          // TODO Auto-generated catch block
          e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Tell the monitor that you successfully finished one item of
        // ""workload""-many
        monitor.worked(1);

        // Check if the user pressed ""cancel""
        if (monitor.isCanceled())
        {
         monitor.done();
          return Status.CANCEL_STATUS;
        }
      }

      // You are done
      monitor.done();
      return Status.OK_STATUS;
    }
  }
}

<p>When I press the About-menuitem the only thing I see is the println() and in the debugger I see that <code>monitor</code> is a <code>NullProgressMonitor</code>.</p>

<p>Is this the default behavior? And how do I change it?</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>I wrote my own <code>IProgressMonitor</code> as greg-449 suggested. I found out that the jFace <a href=""http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjface%2Fdialogs%2FProgressMonitorDialog.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ProgressMonitorDialog</code></a> contains a <code>IProgressMonitor</code> and was a good reference for me.</p>

"4807659","1","4811810","","2011-01-26 17:20:27","","4","490","<p>There were a couple recent questions about boxing a ValueType as an Object, in particular whether it happened in certain instances.</p>

<p>Something I realized I don't know is, what is the difference between ""boxing"" a ValueType (treating it as a referenced Object) and simply accessing it by reference, for instance using ref or out keywords (where what you are passing is just a ""pointer"")? In both cases, the value is somewhere where you can point to it (for an Object it's the heap, for a locally-scoped ValueType it's... where, exactly?).</p>

<p>If I had to guess, from what I know of C++, I would say it works like this: a ValueType accessed by reference (let's say via parameter keyword) remains on the level of the call stack for which it is scoped, but a ""shortcut"" pointer to that variable's bucket in the stack is created and becomes part of the next layer of the stack. Because the value is already stored in memory (probably even the CPU cache), you don't have to instantiate something new on the heap; the only new thing is the pointer, which is its own ValueType (an IntPtr) and is itself stored on the stack, so AFAIK it would be faster than putting something in the heap. </p>

<p>Is this what's going on, or is there something else afoot?</p>

<p>EDIT: More clarity:</p>

<pre><code>public void TakesAnObject(Object obj) {...}

public void TakesAnIntValueType(ref int myValue) {...}

public void AnotherIntParameterMethod(out int myValue) {...}

...

//this locally-scoped variable is simply created on the stack.
int myInt = 5;    

//Performs boxing; an Object is instantiated in the heap that holds the 
//variable value from the stack, and that is passed by ref.
TakesAnObject(myInt);

//Apparently does NOT perform boxing, but we're still dealing with a reference.
//So what's going on?
TakesAnIntValueType(myInt);

//Again created on the stack, with the default 0.
int anotherInt;

//Again, apparently no boxing, but we're dealing with a reference to anotherInt.

This generally works quite well, but I have run into a particular situation in which the generated query is very slow.  The query looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  [dateExpr] AS domainValue,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 WHERE [dateExpr]=[dateExpr(maintable)] AND column2='A') AS series1

FROM table1 maintable
GROUP BY [dateExpr]
ORDER BY domainValue
</code></pre>

<p>I have abbreviated [dateExpr] because it's a combination of CAST and DATEPART functions that convert a datetime field to a string in the form of 'yyyy-MM-dd' so that I can easily group by all values in a calendar day.  The query above returns both those yyyy-MM-dd values as labels for the x-axis of the chart and the values from the data series ""series1"" to display on the chart.  The data series is supposed to count the number of records that fall into that calendar day that also contain a certain value in [column2].  The ""[dateExpr]=[dateExpr(maintable)]"" expression looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(DATEPART(YEAR,dateCol) AS VARCHAR)+'-'+CAST(DATEPART(MONTH,dateCol) AS VARCHAR) = 
CAST(DATEPART(YEAR,maintable.dateCol) AS VARCHAR)+'-'+CAST(DATEPART(MONTH,maintable.dateCol) AS VARCHAR)
</code></pre>

<p>with an additional term for the day (ommitted above for the sake of space).  That is the source of the slowness of the query, but I don't know how to rewrite the query so that it returns the same result more efficiently.  I have complete control over the generation of the query, so if I could find more efficient SQL that returned the same results, I could modify the query generator appropriately.  Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The recommended Java mapping for the DECIMAL and NUMERIC types is
  java.math.BigDecimal, a Java type that also expresses fixed-point
  numbers with absolute precision. The java.math.BigDecimal type
  provides math operations to allow BigDecimal types to be added,
  subtracted, multiplied, and divided with other BigDecimal types, with
  integer types, and with floating point types.</p>
  
  <p>The method recommended for retrieving DECIMAL and NUMERIC values is
  ResultSet.getBigDecimal. JDBC also allows access to these SQL types as

<p>My final aim to transform Oracle PLSQL logic into equivalent java code. I tried to explain with sample logic. </p>

<p>See example Below :</p>

<p><strong>In Oracle</strong> :</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE
    inv_quantity_Balance DECIMAL(10,2);
BEGIN

WHEN (inv_quantity_Balance &lt;= 1) THEN
      inv_quantity_Balance := 2;
ELSE
      inv_quantity_Balance := 3;
END;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Java :</strong></p>

<pre><code>BigDecimal  inv_quantity_Balance  = null ;
if ((inv_quantity_Balance &lt;= 1)) {
    inv_quantity_Balance = 2 ;
}else {
    inv_quantity_Balance = 3 ;
}  
</code></pre>

<p>It shows complier error :</p>

<pre><code>The operator &lt;= is undefined for the argument type(s) BigDecimal, int
Type mismatch: cannot convert from int to BigDecimal
</code></pre>

<p>This is just one sample.
Please help me finding java equivalent for the same. How can I preserve precision and scale etc ?</p>

<p>The idea of using your fingerprint for authentication is nice. But I can add fingerprints in the device if I know the passcode. And its very easy to get the passcode, like you sit in the train next to ur victim and watch him/her enter the passcode. </p>

<p>I want to use the fingerprint as a way of secure authentication but want to be able to detect if new fingerprints were added since the last time I requested the fingerprint.</p>

<p>Apple is doing this for the AppStore. If you want to authenticate a transaction in the AppStore and have added a new Fingerprint since your last transaction, the AppStore requests your AppleId-Password. This is sane behaviour, because the phone might have been taken by someone else who knows the passcode and added his own fingerprint to buy something expensive.</p>

<p>My Question: Can I detect if a new fingerprint was added since the last time that I used Local Authenticator?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've a scenario like in picture.
My problem is in STEP 2: the service provider returns to User's browser a form that onloads submits itselfs to Identity Provide enpoint (on the picture the scenario is a little bit different, because SP returns a redirect response, so the user agent will do a Get request do IP's endpoint).</p>

<p>On Identity Provider I'm using JSF + Primefaces.</p>

<p>I don't know how to retreive posted parameters that come from the form created by the Service Provider.
Is it possible to use the backend functionalities provided by Primefaces ecosystem to retreive values that come from a form rendered by the SP (from another domain)?</p>

<p>I think that Primeface's application lifecycle will broke this mechanism, isn't it?
How can I resolve this problem keeping the adoption of Primefaces/JSF?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23598285/linking-to-modules-in-external-directory-compaq-fortran-command-prompt"">Linking to modules in external directory compaq fortran command prompt</a></p>

<p>And I thought that the first answer was correct (that is, in the manual they say you can simply specify the path name before the module), but after deleting the temporary files in my library folder, this approach seemed to stop working. Trying with the /include[:path] approach, here is my .bat file:</p>

<pre><code> df /include:..\FORTRAN_LIB\ __constants 
 myIO griddata_mod myfdgen myDiff magneticField /exe:magneticField
</code></pre>

<p>And an error is returned saying:</p>

<pre><code> __constants
 myIO
 griddata_mod
 myfdgen
 myDiff
 magneticField
 f90: Severe: No such file or directory
 ... file is '__constants'
</code></pre>

<p>Again, I apologize that this question is VERY specific, but it seems like it should be simple and does not work at all.</p>

<p>p.s. Originally, I was using:</p>

<pre><code> df ..\FORTRAN_LIB\__constants ..\FORTRAN_LIB\myIO 
 ..\FORTRAN_LIB\griddata_mod ..\FORTRAN_LIB\myfdgen 
 ..\FORTRAN_LIB\myDiff magneticField /exe:magneticField
</code></pre>

<p>But, as I've said, it stopped working after I deleted the temporary files in my FORTRAN_LIB folder. <strong>Also note</strong>, these .bat files used only one line, I've broken them into several lines just for readability. I would prefer using the /include[:path] option since that seems like a better solution.</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I have looked in to the maps problem suggested but was unable to figure it out. I am trying to do this using HTML5 and javascript. </p>

<p>The exact problem is in this link. Previously my friend posted this query on how to achieve this in android. </p>

<pre><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20892611/how-to-implement-this-android-animation.
</code></pre>

<p>We were able to solve it, but that feature for android is only applicable for Android 3.0 and above. Currently we are trying develop the same for Windows and so thinking to move this to HTML5 so that it is cross platform and supports all versions of android.</p>

<p>Initially the grid cells looks like this. </p>

<pre><code>-------------------------  
|  A  |  B  | NIL | NIL |  
+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
|  C  |  D  | NIL | NIL |  
+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
| NIL | NIL | NIL | NIL |  
+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 
| NIL | NIL | NIL | NIL |  
-------------------------  
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when i click on 'A' , the grid cells change to the below format.</p>

<pre><code>-------------------------  
| NIL | NIL | NIL | NIL |  
+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
| NIL |           | NIL |  
+-----+     A     +-----+  
| NIL |           |  B  |  
+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 
| NIL | NIL |  C  |  D  |  
------------------------- 
</code></pre>

<p>Now if i click on B, it should be like , </p>

<pre><code>-------------------------  
| NIL | NIL | NIL | NIL |  
+-----+-----+-----+-----+  
| NIL |           | NIL |  
+-----+     B     +-----+

It works for the most part, but I must be missing something obvious with my design, because this way it's very hard for me to effectively tell when all of the data has been processed.</p>

<p>I have two separate tasks that run; one that feeds the other.  I guess this is a producer/consumer problem.  I use a shared Queue between all processes, where the producers fill up the queue, and the consumers read from the queue and do the processing.  The problem is that there is a finite amount of data, so at some point everyone needs to know that all of the data has been processed so the system can shut down gracefully.</p>

<p>It would seem to make sense to use the map_async() function, but since the producers are filling up the queue, I don't know all of the items up front, so I have to go into a while loop and use apply_async() and try to detect when everything is done with some sort of timeout...ugly.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm missing something obvious.  How can this be better designed?</p>

<p>PRODCUER</p>

<pre><code>class ProducerProcess(multiprocessing.Process):
    def __init__(self, item, consumer_queue):
        self.item = item
        self.consumer_queue = consumer_queue
        multiprocessing.Process.__init__(self)

    def run(self):
        for record in get_records_for_item(self.item): # this takes time
            self.consumer_queue.put(record)

def start_producer_processes(producer_queue, consumer_queue, max_running):
    running = []

    while not producer_queue.empty():
        running = [r for r in running if r.is_alive()]
        if len(running) &lt; max_running:
            producer_item = producer_queue.get()
            p = ProducerProcess(producer_item, consumer_queue)
            p.start()
            running.append(p)
        time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>

<p>CONSUMER</p>

<pre><code>def process_consumer_chunk(queue, chunksize=10000):
    for i in xrange(0, chunksize):
        try:
            # don't wait too long for an item
            # if new records don't arrive in 10 seconds, process what you have
            # and let the next process pick up more items.

            record = queue.get(True, 10)
        except Queue.Empty:                
            break

        do_stuff_with_record(record)

<p>MAIN</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()
    consumer_queue = manager.Queue(1024*1024)
    producer_queue = manager.Queue()

    producer_items = xrange(0,10)

    for item in producer_items:
        producer_queue.put(item)

    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=start_producer_processes, args=(producer_queue, consumer_queue, 8))
    p.start()

    consumer_pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=16, maxtasksperchild=1)
</code></pre>

<p>Here is where it gets cheesy.  I can't use map, because the list to consume is being filled up at the same time.  So I have to go into a while loop and try to detect a timeout.  The consumer_queue can become empty while the producers are still trying to fill it up, so I can't just detect an empty queue an quit on that.</p>

<pre><code>    timed_out = False
    timeout= 1800
    while 1:
        try:
            result = consumer_pool.apply_async(process_consumer_chunk, (consumer_queue, ), dict(chunksize=chunksize,))
            if timed_out:
                timed_out = False

        except Queue.Empty:
            if timed_out:
                break

            timed_out = True
            time.sleep(timeout)
        time.sleep(1)

    consumer_queue.join()
    consumer_pool.close()
    consumer_pool.join()
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that maybe I could get() the records in the main thread and pass those into the consumer instead of passing the queue in, but I think I end up with the same problem that way.  I still have to run a while loop and use apply_async()  Thank you in advance for any advice!</p>

<p>My professor and I are trying to modify the code below to send a uniquely named .txt file after every pulse we receive from our Arduino.So far, our efforts have been fruitless.  Right now it sends us all of the data received after a period of time and compiles all of the pulse data into one file. Since the file name isn't changing that data stored in the file is only temporary. </p>

<p>The Arduino Sketch is called Girino and can be found <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Girino-Fast-Arduino-Oscilloscope/?ALLSTEPS"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. The code that we wish to modify is the accompanying python code called readgirino.py that's found under Step #23.
I think we have to modify this loop;</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(5):
    stream.write('s')
    eventString = stream.read(1280)
    eventData.append(np.array(unpack( '1280B', eventString )))
    print eventData
    stream.write('S')
    stream.flushInput()

np.savetxt( ""data.txt"", eventData[4] )
</code></pre>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>UPDATE
-Creating a unique file name was solved with:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>  stream.write('S')
    stream.flushInput()
    n = n + 1
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>np.savetxt( ""data"" +str( n) + "".txt"", eventData[4] ) 
</code></pre>

<p>Although I still don't understand how to only capture one pulse per data file.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Girino code makes no mention of eventData, but I think it means the array that appears in my terminal window after I run the readgirino.py code:

<pre><code>wrapper.java.initmemory=5000
wrapper.java.maxmemory=5000
</code></pre>

<p>Now coming to the question- I am trying to write a cypher query which traverses graph and calculates allocation amount. Here is a snapshot of the structure of the graph. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/j5EVr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Basically I have a department as a starting point which has certain amount and then it is allocated out to certain Product which in turn allocates out to other Products, so on. It can be n level deep allocation. Now I need to calculate amount for all the products.</p>

<p>The cypher query that I am using is as below:</p>

<pre><code>MATCH (f:financial) WHERE f.amount &lt;&gt; 0 
WITH f
MATCH f-[r_allocates:Allocates*]-&gt;(n_allocation)
RETURN 
    n_allocation.cost_pool_hierarchy_id,  
    SUM(reduce(totalamt=f.amount, r IN r_allocates| (r.allocate)*totalamt/100 )) as amt 
ORDER BY n_allocation.cost_pool_hierarchy_id 
LIMIT 1000
</code></pre>

<p>This query takes 30+ seconds with warmed up caches. I have tried going back to Neo4j 1.9 as I found on some posts that Neo4j 2.0 is not yet optimized, but the similar query in 1.9 takes 40+ seconds.</p>

<p>Here is the output from profiler:</p>

<p>I would appreciate any help in optimizing this query. Do I need to update some configuration settings? Or do I need to change the structure of graph?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Just to add further - even the below relatively simple query takes 26 seconds:</p>

I would like to get French page of <a href=""http://dbpedia.org/page/London"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dbpedia.org/page/London</a> using SPARQL. I have noticed that I can retrieve this information through owl:sameAs.</p>

<p>I am trying to write this query on <a href=""http://dbpedia.org/sparql"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dbpedia.org/sparql</a> endpoint to retrieve <a href=""http://fr.dbpedia.org/page/Londres"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fr.dbpedia.org/page/Londres</a> page:</p>

<pre><code>prefix owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt;
select ?resource where {
?resource owl:sameAs ""http://dbpedia.org/page/London""
FILTER strStarts (?resource, ""http://fr.dbpedia.org"")
</code></pre>

<p>In particular, I thought to use <code>""strStarts""</code> property, because I have read this document: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-strstarts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-strstarts</a>.
This document says that ""The STRSTARTS function corresponds to the XPath fn:starts-with function"" and I thought to use this function to retrieve the triples that start with ""<a href=""http://fr.dbpedia.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fr.dbpedia.org</a>"".</p>

<p>But, from my query I don't get any result. Why?
What am I doing wrong here?</p>

Now, I have it so it shoots multiple bullets, but it behaves strangely which I believe is because of the way the counter is reset...The bullets will appear and disappear, and some will keep blinking in the original spot they were shot at, and there will sometimes be a delay before any can be shot again even if the limit isn't on the screen...And sometimes the player character will suddenly jump way to the right and only be able to move up and down.  How do I fix this so it smoothly shoots?  I've included all relevent code...</p>

<p>[edit] Please note that I intend on cleaning it up and moving it all to a class once I get this figured out...This is just a simple prototype so I can have the basics of the game programmed in.</p>

<p>So i want to create a Metro menu (indeedy inspired by win 8 X3 ) so i got the divs movable with Jquery. Now i want to possition them all the right way:</p>

<pre><code>[  big block  ]
[small] [small]
[  big block  ]
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>i got the first 2 row's just perfect.
Now the problem is the following:
My 2th big block will be placed like this:</p>

<pre><code>[  big block  ]
[small] [small] [  big block  ]
</code></pre>

<p>or just behind other divs :/</p>

<p>here is some code stuffs to make it more clear what i mean XD:
[CSS]</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;style&gt;
#facebook{
    margin-left:10px;
    margin-top:10px;
    width:462px;
    height:174px;
    border:none;
    background-color:transparent;
    background:none;
    background-image:url(buttons/facebook.png);
    background-repeat:no-repeat;
    background-size:cover;
}

#agenda{
    float:left;
    margin-left:18px;
    margin-top:10px;
    width:223px;
    height:146px;
    border:none;
    background-color:transparent;
    background:none;
    background-image:url(buttons/Agenda.png);
    background-repeat:no-repeat;
    background-size:cover;
}

#contacts{
    float: none;
    width: 462px;
    height: 174px;
    border: none;
    background-color: transparent;
    background: none;
    background-image: url(buttons/Contacts.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    margin: 10px;
    position: relative;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the HTML looks a bit like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""facebook"" class=""ui-widget-content""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""desktop"" class=""ui-widget-content""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""agenda"" class=""ui-widget-content""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""contacts"" class=""ui-widget-content""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>so if anyone knows a good tutorial on how to place them divs the right way or just some explanation on how-to that would be amazing!^_^</p>

<p>thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I want to avoid making a mess of it, so I'd like to make sure that I have the basic security bases covered.</p>

<p>Taking what I can pull from facebook's way of doing things, a few points that key points to remember are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Require old password (of course).  </li>
<li>Confirm new password input twice.  </li>
<li>log off the account (only on all other pages, somehow)?  </li>
<li>Require a secure password length &amp; that the password fits all the <em>[insert various criteria here]</em> required for passwords on each specific system.</li>
<li>Require new password to differ from old password.</li>
<li>Prevent multiple password change attempts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook also:<br>
 - Requires new password to be different from past passwords.  (seems like an edge case use)</p>

<p>Those are only the policies that I can glean from the outside UI of facebook's account system. What other security points should I cover when providing a ""change password"" system?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
In my specific case I intend to be relatively permissive with the <em>[insert various criteria]</em> for what characters will have to go into the password itself.  My site isn't a bank, if a player wants to use the password ""password1"", then they should expect their account to be taken over by their friends.  <strong>MY FOCUS</strong> on the other hand, is on making sure that my site prevents any opportunities for ""hostile takeover"" via any kind of insecurity in the <em>password changing system itself</em>. </p>

<p>More good points from the answers below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send notice of password changes to user's email.</li>
<li>Keep change of email and change of password each dependent on each-other.</li>
<li>Use a secure encrypted (https) connection for such changes.</li>
</ul>

It works great and was easy to setup, but I'm stuck.</p>

<p>I have some items on the Actionbar, and it looks great.
Some Items are behind the three dots (ifRoom) and some you always can see.</p>

<p>How do I make so when you click on one of these items so it starts an new Activity?
I tried with switch/case and other methods, but didnt work to send from one Activity to another through the Items. I know how to send from button, imagebutton to another Activity, but not from Items.</p>

<p>My main.xml looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;item 
    android:id=""@+id/add""
    android:title=""Lägg till""
    android:icon=""@drawable/new""    
    android:orderInCategory=""1""
    budsnabben:showAsAction=""always""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the code in MainActivity looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    switch(item.getItemId()) {
    case R.id.:
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, MapActivity.class);
        this.startActivity(intent);

    return true;

<p>The problem is on case R.id.... After Id, I dont get my class map or main, its not there.</p>

<p>Thank you. </p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>

<p>Just want to thank you Gerard.</p>

<p>I created new Strings in strings.xml.
After that, I did change the title in my main.xml to this:</p>

<p>android:title=""@string/add""</p>

<p>I did hard-coded that line like before, therefor it didn't work I think:</p>

<p>android:title=""@+id/add""</p>

<p>Next step: Get the search action on the top while rest of my actions should be on bottom.</p>

<p>Step after that: Make Google Maps v2 work on the Emulator in Eclipse and make it work for API 8 and above. This will be fun :-)</p>

<p>At the end, I fetch my CallDataRecord, the list inside is instanciated but empty so it doesn't work as expected.
I tried to retrieve only one CallDataRecordLine in another JSP and it works fine. So the problem is the iteration on the list.</p>

<pre><code>func isHostConnected(hostAddress : String) -&gt; Bool

    let request = NSMutableURLRequest(URL: NSURL(string: hostAddress)!)

<p>Now since, <code>NSURLConnection</code> is deprecated, as per Xcode suggestion I tried writing it using <code>NSURLSession.dataTaskWithRequest</code>, here it is :</p>

<pre><code>func isHostConnected(hostAddress : String) -&gt; Bool
{
    let request = NSMutableURLRequest(URL: NSURL(string: hostAddress.stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)!)!)
    request.timeoutInterval = 3

    let session = NSURLSession(configuration: NSURLSessionConfiguration.defaultSessionConfiguration(), delegate: nil, delegateQueue: NSOperationQueue.mainQueue())

    var responseCode = -1

    session.dataTaskWithRequest(request, completionHandler: {(data : NSData?, response : NSURLResponse?, error : NSError?) -&gt; Void in
        responseCode = (response as? NSHTTPURLResponse)!.statusCode
    })!.resume()

    return (responseCode == 200)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Above code always returns <strong>false</strong> (its Obvious), since <code>completionHandler</code> gets executed on seperate Thread.</p>

<p>My concern is that, can I make <code>completionHandler()</code> run on MainThread somehow like <code>sendSynchronousRequest</code> does by blocking it.</p>

<p>I have reasons to not to use 'Apple's Reachabilty' here.</p>

<p>At the moment the signing works the following way: </p>

<ol>
<li>A HTTP GET is sent to a servlet to get the document that is going to
be signed;</li>
<li>The applet gets started, the digital signature driver gets extracted from the file system and the user enters the PIN;</li>
<li>The applet gets the certification chain, checks CRLs/OSCP and signs the document;</li>
<li>The applet sends a multipart post with the already signed file to a servlet in the system.</li>
</ol>

<p>One alternative solution would be to import the certificate in the browser and use js to do the signing. But that won't be an user friendly solution.</p>

<p>Another solution could be to ask the user to download a run a program using JNLP that downloads and signs the document and automatically uploads it using HTTP multipart POST. The drawback of this approach would be it requires additional user interactions (the download action) and we lose browser http session, so we have to authenticate again.</p>

<p>Which is more viable? Can you think of alternative?</p>

<p>Documentation and common examples always show basic comparisons with table attributes</p>

<p>Like in this example :</p>

<pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :created_before, -&gt;(time) { where(""created_at &lt; ?"", time) }
end
</code></pre>

<p>But in my case, I want to compare a datetime from my Model to a date string coming from a form submission</p>

<pre><code>scope :departure, -&gt; (departure) { where(""departure = ?"", ""%#{departure}%"")}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I want to do some manipulation to my model variable before the comparison (ex, convert to string or change format)</p>

<p>I tried with different methods like this one</p>

<pre><code>def self.departure(departure)
  @date_without_time = flights.departure.to_date.to_s
  where(@date_without_time, ""= ?"", departure)
end
</code></pre>

<p>But the condition end up like this (2012-01-03) instead of (departure = ""%#{departure}%"")</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do it?
To be more general, how do you create methods or scope to compare two variables instead of only comparing one variable to a model attribute?</p>

<p>In this case, I want to compare my model attribute which is a Datetime with a form submitted string date, so before I can compare the two dates I need to do some treatment on my model attribute since I need to ignore the time part and format it to a string</p>

<p><strong>Update :</strong></p>

<p>I ended up making it work using this method, but I'd still like to know if it's possible to call class or instance method on a Model column in a scope or if there is a better way to handle the Datetime/form date comparison in a better way</p>

<pre><code>scope :departure_s, -&gt; (departure) { where(""departure &gt; ?"", departure.to_datetime.beginning_of_day)}
scope :departure_e, -&gt; (departure) { where(""departure &lt; ?"", departure.to_datetime.end_of_day)}

void runscript(const string &amp;file) {

    cout &lt;&lt; ""attempting to run: "" &lt;&lt; file &lt;&lt; endl;

    int parse_status = 0;
    eval_string(file, false, parse_status);
    cout &lt;&lt; ""parse_status: "" &lt;&lt; parse_status &lt;&lt; endl;

    eval_string(file, false, parse_status, 0); // I'm not sure what the difference here is or 
                                  // what the value 0 means, I can't find any documentation on 
                                  // what `hargout` is.. See Note {1} below
    cout &lt;&lt; ""parse_status: "" &lt;&lt; parse_status &lt;&lt; endl;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

    // Set-up
    char *oct_argv[3] = {(char*)""embedded"", (char*)""-q"", (char*)""--interactive""};
    octave_main(3, oct_argv, true);


    // Attempt to run script    
    runscript(""Script1"");
    runscript(""Script1.m"");


    // `a` should be defined after running Script1.m..
    octave_value_list a = get_top_level_value(""a"", false);

    do_octave_atexit ();

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Script1.m is very simple and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = 1000;
a
</code></pre>

<p>When I run, I always get this output:</p>

<pre><code>attempting to run: Script1
error: invalid call to script /Users/Daly/Documents/School/EECS/Labs/GitHub/deep/Octave/    Script1.m
parse_status: 0
parse_status: 0
attempting to run: Script1.m
parse_status: 0
parse_status: 0
error: get_top_level_value: undefined symbol 'a'
</code></pre>

<p>It only ever complains about the invalid call the first time, no matter how many times I try to eval_string or in what order.</p>

<p>Notes: {1} After searching for <code>error: invalid call to script</code>, I found <a href=""http://octave.sourceforge.net/doxygen/html/de/d5e/ov-usr-fcn_8cc_source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this source code</a> which at line 00155 raises this exact error if <code>nargout</code> isn't 0, so I thought they might be related?</p>

<p>But anyway, maybe this isn't the right way to be going about it. What is the correct way to execute an entire octave script from an octave-embedded c++ program? Thanks!</p>

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in &lt;UIKit/UIView.h&gt; may also be helpful.

<p>I was hoping to use an enum (eg High, Medium and Low priority) as this keeps things simple and closed, but the ordering actually needs to be quite finely grained. </p>

<p>So, the next obvious choice is an integer...but there is the problem of lazy users giving very low or high priority documents increasingly huge values and hoping that the value they chose is the highest. Also, I need to be able to add a new document X between document A and document B without having to change the priorty of A or B (once a document has a priority, it cant change!) It's a bit like the line numbering problem in BASIC...should this priority go up in steps of 10, so I can add document X at 15? But what if I run out of space between numbers? Maybe steps of 100? 1000? Its getting ugly! And then you have a convention people have to follow, and our users might not be great at that. And what if I want something to happen before the document with ID 0, do I go into negative numbers? Maybe I could use floating point so it is unlikely I'd ever run out of space to 'insert' new documents? Getting even uglier!</p>

<p>Is there a nice solution to this problem, or is it basically just a case of using numbers and encouraging a sensible convention?</p>

<p>Some additional points, as I'm not sure I explained very clearly:</p>

<ul>
<li>The documents are in a database and need to be sent to another serivce in a particular order, defined by a property on the document itself, that cannot change once it has been set</li>
<li>The priority value on each doc does not need to be unique</li>

I just started learning ios programming, and I follow the book ""IOS programing: Big Nerd Guide programming"". In a simple test to create a colorful rectangle block, I have this code:</p>

<pre>
 - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
    CGRect frame = CGRectMake(160,240,200,150);
    ENTHyposisView *firstView = [[ENTHyposisView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
    firstView.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];
    [self.window addSubview:firstView];
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    self.window.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];


    return YES;
}

</pre>

<p>the ENTHyposisView simply inherits from UIView. The original coordination in CGRectMake, (160,240) seems not working - while the rectangle block did appear with right size and color, the origin is at the (0,0) position rather than the specified one.</p>

<p>The code seems too straightforward to have missed anything, but why it didn't act as expected?</p>

<p>Thats gonna be something I have missed or not aware of.</p>

I'm new to <code>Javascript</code> so I may be making a mistake in my approach or code. So if I am, please point it out so I can learn.</p>

<p>The date/time <code>jQuery</code> selector shows and works as expected, however I need to send its data to a Java servlet I created, which then creates a new Parse Object in my Parse.com database with that date data. According to <a href=""https://www.parse.com/docs/rest#objects-types"" rel=""nofollow"">Parse's docs</a>, the Date field stored for an object is as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The Date type contains a field iso which contains a UTC timestamp
  stored in ISO 8601 format with millisecond precision:
  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMZ.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, I need to reformat the returned date from the form to match Parse's requirements, which I will do with SimpleDateFormat in my servlet. (I've been able to do that with a <code>Date object</code> in Java already, so an alternative solution would be to send the Date data as a Date object straight from the <code>jsp</code>. If that is possible, please tell me how.)</p>

<p>I matched up the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">formatting for SimpleDateFormat</a> with the <a href=""http://www.phpeveryday.com/articles/jQuery-UI-Changing-the-date-format-for-Datepicker-P1023.html"" rel=""nofollow"">DatePicker format</a> and <a href=""http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/#tp-formatting"" rel=""nofollow"">TimePicker format</a> so that SimpleDateFormat would be able to parse and reformat the Date string without a problem into a Date object in my servlet. (Curse whoever allowed using such a variety of formats when dealing with dates and times instead of using one universal format... T_T) (Maybe this is the part I did wrong? Anyone willing to double-check?)
So I changed the format in my <code>DateTimePicker</code> to match up with SimpleDateFormat's, while retaining user readability:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
$(function() {
    $(""#timezone_datetimepicker"").datetimepicker({
        dateFormat: 'mm-dd-yy', 
        timeFormat: 'HH:mm Z',
        onClose: function (dateText) {
            $(this).datetimepicker.formatTime('HH:mmZ', dateText);
            }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>The function at <code>onClose</code> is my attempt to match the format to SimpleDateFormat's with exact precision before it is sent to the <code>servlet</code>. I based it on the utility function mentioned in the <a href=""http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/#tp-examples"" rel=""nofollow"">TimePicker's examples:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the utility function to format your own time. $.datepicker.formatTime(format, time, options)</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$('#utility_example_2').text(
$.datepicker.formatTime('HH:mm z', { hour: 14, minute: 36, timezone: '+2000' }, {})
</code></pre>

<p>);</p>

<p>Regardless of my numerous attempts and variations, <strong>this is the part where it fails</strong> and I need help with. When I try to parse the passed over Date string with <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SimpleDateFormat formatter1 = new SimpleDateFormat(""MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm z"");       
SimpleDateFormat formatter2 = new SimpleDateFormat(""MM-dd-yyyy'T'HH:mmz"");
try {
        //datePicked and datePickedFormatted are global Date variables
        datePicked = formatter1.parse(request.getParameter(""sendTime""));
        datePickedFormatted = formatter2.parse(datePicked.toString());
    } catch (ParseException e1) {
        System.out.println(""Date formatter failed to parse chosen sendTime."");
        e1.printStackTrace();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I get this error in my log:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: ""08-22-2014 05:18 -04:00""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it still being sent to the servlet formatted like that, when I try to format it to match SimpleDateFormat's? Why won't SimpleDateFormat accept it?</p>

<p>I even tried to parse the date string with <a href=""http://www.joda.org/joda-time/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Joda-Time</a> instead of using SimpleDateFormat, but even that didn't work:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime dt = new DateTime(request.getParameter(""sendTime""));
</code></pre>

<p>The text box is shown on the page, but not clickable or input text into it. If i remove file ""leaflet.js"", the text box works just fine, but all the other stuff is gone in the same time.</p>

<p>I'm a school teacher and I'm creating an ELearning website for my school, at present I'm attempting to create a code window where my students can input some python syntax and onlick the code is converted and shown in the adjacent window. Very similar to what is used in W3schools for its examples and various elearning websites.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any knowledge as to where I should start or have any links about creating this? I would probably go along the lines of when the 'submit code' button is pressed, a javascript object is created of the user input code, then rendered into the adjacent result box using some sort of ajax.</p>

&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;a href='some_url'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have bound custom drag events using mousedown, mouseup and mousemove to the parent div and a click event to the 'h1' tag. The events look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$element.on('mousedown', $.proxy(handleMouseDown,this));
$element.on('mouseup',$.proxy(handleMouseUp,this));
$element.on('mousemove',$.proxy(handleMouseMove,this));
$('element selector h1').on('click', click_function);

var handleMouseDown = function(event){
   clicked = true;
}

var handleMouseUp = function(event){
   if(dragging){
      event.preventDefault();
      event.stopPropagation();
      event.stopImmediatePropagation()
      handleDragEnd(event);
      dragging = false;
   }

   clicked = false;
}

var handleMouseMove = function(event){
   if(clicked){
       dragging = true;
   }
   else if(dragging){

   }
}

var handleMove = function(event) {
    //move element
}

var handleDragEnd = function(event) {
   //do stuff
}

<p>Everything works by itself but my problem is that if i start dragging by grabbing either the 'a' tag or the 'h1' tag their click events trigger after mouseup, and I don't want this to happen. As you can see I've tried several versions of stop propagation. </p>

<p>I could solve this by unbinding events or using locking variables to block the click events but this seems clumsy, plus I'm not sure how I would go about it concerning the 'a' tag.</p>

<p>I have already looked at other posts (thats how I came up with my tried solutions) but they don't work for me.</p>

<p>I decided that the first thing I would need to do was to create a login and register page for users who want to sign on to the website. I had no idea how to do this so I did a little research online and I found some pre-built scripts that would do exactly what I wanted to do. In the end I decided to go with this script: <a href=""http://www.html-form-guide.com/php-form/php-registration-form.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.html-form-guide.com/php-form/php-registration-form.html</a></p>

<p>On my website (hosted with hostgator using cPanel) I set up a Mysql database called ljbaumer_gifts (website is a gift website) and I added a table with 2 columns. The first one a login column which was set to int with auto increment and 25 characters. The second one is a password one which was set to var_char and 25 characters. </p>

<p>I filled in all of the information on the setup scripts from the website I linked to earlier  completely correctly but every single time I try to register I get this error code: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Database Login failed! Please make sure that the DB login credentials provided are correct
  mysqlerror:Access denied for user 'ljbamer_root'@'my_server_adress' (using password: YES)

<p>What I'm seeing right now looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Socket.io connects</li>
<li>User triggers a page navigation (submits a form, refreshes, etc.)</li>
<li>Server-side logic sends a request to the socket.io server, which immediately dispatches the event to the still-connected client</li>
<li>The client receives and confirms the request (I'm pretty sure there's some confirmation of messages built-in to socket.io, correct me if I'm wrong), and would display a notification to the user, but then ...</li>
<li>The socket.io connection closes on the original page</li>
<li>The new page loads and displays</li>
<li>Socket.io opens a new connection, but there's no new messages, because the last one was received and confirmed.</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn't really a bug, per se, since I don't think it's reasonable to expect Socket.io to close the connection in advance of a navigation occurring. However, I'm not really sure what the best way to handle this is. Currently I keep one connection open per-client at a time, and close the other when a new one connects. This doesn't happen in this case though, since the first one has closed before the second one connects. I also could keep a list of all clients, but that wouldn't solve this problem either, because the message would still be received by the first connection.</p>

<p>Can someone suggest a solution to this problem that would ensure the user always sees a notification for the message?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : Here is how the RTB is placed in the DataGrid</p>

<p>The DataTemplate is defined in a ResourceDictionary and looks roughly like this : </p>

    &lt;RichTextBox x:Name=""rtbDiff"" x:Uid=""rtbDiff""/&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;

<p>What I need to do at runtime is fill the richtextbox of the SelectedItem with a FlowDocument. I now use the extension methods described <a href=""http://techiethings.blogspot.com/2010/05/get-wpf-datagrid-row-and-cell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> to find the Cell that contains that Control. With that I do the following :</p>

<pre><code>DataGridCell cell = this.dgTexts.GetCell( this.dgFreetexts.GetSelectedRow(), 0 );
object ob = cell.Template.FindName( ""rtbDiff"", cell );
</code></pre>

<p>No matter how, I never find any Child with that Name - FindName always returns NULL.
Does anybody have any ideas how I can improve my search for the RichTextBox?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Basically the issue I am having is that I have a <code>TreeView</code> of folders in my application i.e:</p>

<pre><code>Catalog

  Brands
    Nike
    Adidas
    Lactose

  Styles
    Sandles
    Trainers
    Boots
</code></pre>

<p>The issue that I am trying to fix is that when I drag a folder around (This is handled in my <code>DragDropManager</code> class), I am unable to scroll up or down(simply displays a lovely stop sign). I am also unable to find a scroller actually within the treeview, so I am unsure how it is being generated (This is not my own software, I have recently started working for a company so I am not familiar with the code and no one else seems to know.)</p>

<p>This is a problem if I want to move something from the very top to the very bottom.</p>

<p>The scrolling works fine on its own without the dragging being done.</p>

<p>If anyone wishes to see any part of my code feel free to ask as I am unsure what to actually show you guys.</p>

<p>I have read through a good few articles and am just left scratching my head.</p>

<p>HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""sidebar""&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Sidebar 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""sidebar-two""&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Sidebar 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code> var sidebar = L.control.sidebar('sidebar', {
            closeButton: true,
            position: 'left'
        });
        map.addControl(sidebar);


    var marker = L.marker([51.2, 7]).addTo(map).on('click', function () {
        sidebar.toggle();
    });

    var sidebarTwo = L.control.sidebar('sidebar-two', {
        closeButton: true,
        position: 'left'
    });
    map.addControl(sidebarTwo);

    var marker = L.marker([52.2, 7]).addTo(map).on('click', function () {
        sidebarTwo.toggle();
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I am using a <a href=""https://github.com/turbo87/leaflet-sidebar/"" rel=""nofollow"">Leaflet sidebar plugin</a>, and when I click on several markers at a time, the sidebars open on top of each other. </p>

<p>What I'd like to do is if you click markerA and sidebarA appears, you can click markerB, and it will close sidebarA and bring in sidebarB. I'd like for this to be interchangeable, so any marker will close the current one open bring in its own sidebar. Is this possible? I've included a <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Lno1a6nc/1/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>JSFIDDLE</strong></a> to show what the basic map, markers and sidebar look like. <strong>NOTE:</strong> You'll need to stretch the demo window wider to see it on the default screen width.</p>

<p>The demo also includes the plugin's source code. I've fiddled with it and have a feeling this code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>toggle: function () {
        if (this.isVisible()) {
            this.hide();
        } else {
            this.show();
        }
    },

You can then right-click and in their context menu choose <em>Open File Location</em>. This will open up one windows explorer window for each directory that the files are in, and the files will be selected for you. </p>

<p>So let's say we have a bunch of mp3 files in our library where three of them are these:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Z:\Music\Thursday Blues\01. I wish it was friday.mp3</em></li>
<li><em>Z:\Music\Counting Sheep\01. Sheep #1.mp3</em></li>
<li><em>Z:\Music\Counting Sheep\02. Sheep #2.mp3</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If we select those three (in a view where all of them are visible) and do <em>Open File Location</em> then two explorer windows will pop up. One will be the <em>Z:\Music\Thursday Blues</em> folder with <em>01. I wish it was friday.mp3</em> selected, and the other one will be the *Z:\Music\Counting Sheep** folder with both <em>01. Sheep #1.mp3</em> and <em>02. Sheep #2.mp3</em> selected.</p>

<p>How can I do this myself in C#? We have an application which is going to export data to various formats, for example CSV and Excel, and I would like to open up explorer windows with these files selected when they are created and ready to be viewed. Currently I just do <code>Process.Start(path)</code>, and this works but I would love to be able to highlight those particular files as well. Would make the files that were just created much more obvious.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any assignment that silently fails in normal code (assignment to a non-writable property, assignment to a getter-only property, assignment to a new property on a non-extensible object) will throw in strict mode</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, using their example, doing something like the following throws a TypeError</p>

<pre><code>""use strict"";
var obj1 = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj1, ""x"", { value: 42, writable: false });
obj1.x = 9; // throws a TypeError
</code></pre>

<p>However I ran into an example where it seems 'use strict' is being a little overzealous about this rule. Here is my setup</p>

<p><em>definelol.js</em></p>

<pre><code>Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'lol', {
    value: 'wat'
})
</code></pre>

<p><em>setlol.js</em></p>

<pre><code>'use strict';

console.log('here 0');

var sugar = { lol: '123' }

console.log('here 1');

var verbose = {};
verbose.lol = '123';

console.log('here 2');

console.log('sugar.lol:', sugar.lol);
console.log('verbose.lol:', verbose.lol);

</code></pre>

<p><em>app.js</em></p>

<pre><code>require('./definelol.js');
require('./setlol.js');
</code></pre>

<p>running <code>node app.js</code> gives</p>

<pre><code>here 0

</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple of interesting things that are interesting about this output. First is that we are not trying to set the <code>lol</code> property on <code>Object.prototype</code> we are trying to set the <code>lol</code> property of <code>verbose</code>. To prove this I changed <code>definelol.js</code> to be</p>

<pre><code>Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'lol', {
    writable: true,
    value: 'wat'
})
</code></pre>

<p>Now, running <code>node app.js</code> gives</p>

<pre><code>here 0
here 1
here 2
sugar.lol: 123
verbose.lol: 123
Object.prototype.lol: wat
</code></pre>

<p>The second thing that was interesting was that the original program failed on <code>verbose.lol = '123'</code> but was perfectly happy creating <code>sugar</code> and setting its <code>lol</code> to 123.  I don't understand this because it seems that the way we created <code>sugar</code> should simply be syntactic sugar for the way we created <code>verbose</code></p>

Besides to method-specific attributes each WS call will need to accept/provide some common attributes (e.g. authentication tokens or paging parameters for the request, or version and error info for the response). There will be tens to hundreds of different WS calls. We also expect to use WIF or similar technology for understanding SAML tokens and identity federation.</p>

<p>My preferred approach is (so far) to use a XML structure with some common header and a variable body for each call, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Request&gt;
   &lt;Header&gt;
     &lt;Paging&gt;...&lt;/Paging&gt;
     ...
   &lt;/Header&gt;
   &lt;Body method=""GetInvoices""&gt;
     &lt;!-- specific attributes for GetInvoices web method --&gt;
   &lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/Request&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a good approach or do you recommend an alternative one?</li>
<li>How to apply existing .NET technologies in order to simplify/automate dealing with this format as much as possible, namely 
<ul>
<li>write the interface for a specific call and generate service/schema description for the body part(similar how WCF generates WSDL service description from the method contract)</li>
<li>parse the XML upon receipt, translate it into a call of the desired method with correct parameters (what I don't want to end up with is to have one big method with a big switch and 100s of cases...)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE (1.7.2014)</strong></p>

<p>My question formulation has been perhaps somewhat vague. The real issue I am struggling with is to be able to apply ready-made .NET technologies for service generation (i.e. define a service contract and let VS generate WSDL service descriptions etc.) but at the same time make the message format flexible enough to allow for adding some out-of-band information which I intend to process separately. </p>

<p>For example I would like to have authentication data in the header (unsure yet in which form - possibly some authentication tokens, or SAML). Then I would like to intercept the request before it actually ends in the corresponding web method and reject it or set some context based on the authentication data, so that the web method can rely on the context. The same goes for paging in web methods where it is applicable, or success/failure messages for the response.</p>

<p>For sake of interoperability/generality I started with a ""pure"" XML approach, but now I can imagine a better solution would be to extend common SOAP message format like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;s:Envelope xmlns:s=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/""&gt;
   &lt;s:Header&gt;
       &lt;!-- out of band data --&gt;
   &lt;/s:Header&gt;
   &lt;s:Body&gt;
      &lt;GetInvoices xmlns=""http://tempuri.org/""&gt;
          &lt;!-- arguments  of GetInvoices() --&gt;
      &lt;/GetInvoices &gt;
   &lt;/s:Body&gt;
&lt;/s:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The question is then if this makes sense and whether it is implementable in WCF (how)?</p>

<p>I use <a href=""https://github.com/cloudhead/toto"" rel=""nofollow"">toto</a> as a blog engine for my website. So it uses Rack, Heroku and all the settings can be put nicely in the file <code>config.ru</code>, which is why I like it since it makes everything simple for me. </p>

<p>I use a Rack plugin: <a href=""https://github.com/talison/rack-mobile-detect"" rel=""nofollow"">mobile detect</a> to detect mobile devices and then redirect to a different site.</p>

<p>And that's where the problem comes. I tested the redirect request, for some time after the deployment, the redirect only works after I refresh the page, which means, I type in the URL for my website on an iPhone, first try will give me the original site, not the one for mobile, after I hit refresh it gets redirected.</p>

<p>I think it's because of the caching on the server (because even if I clear all cache on my phone, it still happens). So this leads to my question: what Rack function/plugin would let me automatically clear the cache on the server OR force the browser to refresh when a mobile is detected. </p>

<p>I have googled for this solution many times and most of it is for Rails app which is not really for me. How do I just make it work all in the <code>config.ru</code> ? </p>

I have some code that I'm adapting and I don't understand how the variables are being passed from PHP to JavaScript. I suspect I'm missing out on a bit of basic theory but I have so far been unable to track it down on the web. Google maps marker information is being passed as follows: -<br/><br/></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php  
$mrk_cnt = 0;    
while ($obj = $res-&gt;fetch_object()){
    $username[$mrk_cnt] = $obj-&gt;username;
    $inf[$mrk_cnt] = $obj-&gt;title;   
    $lat[$mrk_cnt] = $obj-&gt;lat;
    $lng[$mrk_cnt] = $obj-&gt;long;
    $begin[$mrk_cnt] = $obj-&gt;begin;
    $end[$mrk_cnt] = $obj-&gt;end;
    $distance[$mrk_cnt] = $obj-&gt;distance;
    $marker_type[$mrk_cnt] = $obj-&gt;type;
    $icon[$mrk_cnt]=(($marker_type[$mrk_cnt]=='inquirer')? 'red_marker': 'blue_marker');    
$mrk_cnt++;    
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Further on there's some JavaScript echoed from php: -</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
&lt;?php
    for ($lcnt = 0; $lcnt &lt; $mrk_cnt; $lcnt++){ 
        echo ""var point$lcnt = new google.maps.LatLng($lat[$lcnt], $lng[$lcnt]);\n"";
        echo ""var mrktx$lcnt = \""$inf[$lcnt]\"";\n"";
        echo ""var infowindow$lcnt = new google.maps.InfoWindow({ content: mrktx$lcnt });"";
        echo ""var marker$lcnt = new google.maps.Marker({position: point$lcnt, map: map, icon:"" . $icon[$lcnt] . ""});\n"";
        echo ""google.maps.event.addListener(marker$lcnt,'click', function() {infowindow$lcnt.open(map,marker$lcnt);});\n"";
        echo ""bounds.extend(point$lcnt);\n"";    
    }
?&gt;
    map.fitBounds(bounds);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How are the php variables - $lat[], for instance - finding their way into the JavaScript? They are declared in PHP and they are not being concatenated or quoted. It is assumed the JavaScript will know that $lat[$lcnt] will be the $lat[$mkr_cnt] declared in the php above with $lcnt set to =$mkr_cnt.<br/>Many thanks.</p>

<p>They present an example of the kind of devilish String question i might expect to see on the exam:</p>

<pre><code>String s1 = ""spring "";
String s2 = s1 + ""summer "";
s1.concat(""fall "");
s2.concat(s1);
s1 += ""winter "";
System.out.println(s1 + "" "" + s2);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the output? For extra credit, how many String objects and how
  many reference variables were created prior to the println statement?</p>
  
  <p>Answer: The result of this code fragment is spring winter spring
  summer. There are two reference variables, s1 and s2. There were a
  total of eight String objects created as follows: ""spring"", ""summer ""
  (lost), ""spring summer"", ""fall"" (lost), ""spring fall"" (lost), ""spring
  summer spring"" (lost), ""winter"" (lost), ""spring winter"" (at this point
  ""spring"" is lost). Only two of the eight String objects are not lost
  in this process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question in the title is very specific. As you can see, they say there were a total of 8 <code>String</code> objects, but, what happens at the println method call ? It is passing a String object reference as argument, so, the value of s1 plus s2 should create other String object, since its immutable, increasing the count to 9.</p>

<p>But (possibly even more) shouldn't the empty String ("" "") between the value of s1 and s2 create other object, increasing the count to 10 ?</p>

<p>It counted when they did this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>s1.concat(""fall "");</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, why not this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>s1.concat(s1 + "" "" + s2);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or the real one, this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.out.println(s1 + "" "" + s2);</p>

<p>I've seen other people's code that does this:</p>

<pre><code>writer.AddAttribute(HtmlTextWriterAttribute.Id, this.ClientID + ""_divTest"");

<p>That will prevent naming conflicts between instances of my control, but what if I've already created a div elsewhere on the page that coincidentally has the same ID?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p>I've worked around this by overriding <code>CreateChildControls</code> and adding actual controls, as opposed to rendering HTML directly.  In that case INamingContainer does its job.  However, I'm still curious if there's a way to solve my original problem (unique IDs for directly rendered elements).</p>

Within my meteor test project, I have two templates. One is navTest.html and other is columnTest.html. Both the templates uses bootstrap classes to style the elements. However, columnTest template is not creating 3 equal width columns for which I have written the code. Where as the navTest template is working properly as it is creating a navigation bar using the bootstrap classes. My question is why bootstrap code is working in one template but not in other. It appears that I am doing something wrong for which I am looking for help. To add bootstrap package, I have used the following command: </p>

<pre><code>meteor add bootstrap

<p>Here's the code for columnTest.html</p>

This being done with the intent of alleviating subclasses with the burden of implementing methods that they themselves may not need/use:</p>

<pre><code>public interface MyInterface {
    public void doThis();
    public void doThat();
    public void done();
}

public class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    public void doThis() {
        // NO-OP
    }
    public void doThat() {
        // NO-OP
    }
    public void done() {
        // Some standard implementation
    }
}

public class MuSubClass extends MyClass {
    public void doThat() {
        // Subclass only cares about doThat()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have seen this pattern used a number of times including <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/xml/sax/helpers/DefaultHandler.html"">Java's DefaultHandler in the SAX framework</a>, and <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/event/MouseAdapter.html"">MouseAdapter</a>. In somes cases such classes are named as Adaptors, but I was under the impression that the adapter pattern translates between two different interfaces. </p>

<p>Given that in these instances there is only one declared interface that is being translated to an undefined subset of that interface - I am not clear on how this is in the spirit of the adapter pattern.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I don't quite see how this adheres to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null%5FObject%5Fpattern"">NullObject pattern</a> either, given that some methods could have an implementation, and the NullObject is traditionally a singleton.</p>

<p>I need to create a new web-api and a new web project and integrate ASP.NET Identity into the already existing database.</p>

<p>I have currently setup my solution to breakup the projects as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>WEB_API</li>
<li>WEB_UI</li>
</ul>

<p>My aim is to implement the Identity in the services layer so that both my WebAPI and MVC site can utilize the same identity mechanism.</p>

<p>I am fairly overwhelmed at the moment, I have read many tutorials and articles over the last day or two and have ended up with the options of either re-implementing the <code>IUserStore</code> and <code>IRoleStore</code>. And also with mapping the different entities in the <code>OnModelCreatingMethod</code>.</p>

<p>I cant seem to find a tutorial  which is aimed at what I want to do. My database is to different to simply remap the names of columns, And I dont want to re-implement the entire Identity Stores as there are only a few conflicting fields. Most tuts I have found are related to using mysql instead of EF. I still want to make use Entity Framework.</p>

<p>Issues I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>The current Users Table in the database used <code>Int</code> pk , not <code>GUID</code></li>
<li>The Password Field uses a different Hashing algorithm. So i would need to override how Identity checks and store the password.</li>
<li>I do not have all the required Identity User fields in my database, however I am able to add new fields, I just cant change already existing fields.</li>
<li>I am making use of Database First as the DB already exists.</li>
</ul>

<p>So basically my question is, In what direction do I need to go in order to overcome the above mentioned issues. Can I get away with changing the Database mapping? Or do I need to go as far as re implementing the User and Role Stores? </p>

<p>What I had initially planned was to re-implement the User and Role Stores using entity framework, And i could then make use if the DB first model classes and map the actual DB structure and fields to my ApplicationUser Fields. But this is where I thought I might be diving into cold waters, and i'm generally not a fan of reinventing the wheel if not necessary.</p>

Currently my code works as intended it assigns a date of to the finaldate variable then looks in the code to delete all dates that are higher than the finaldate variable. Only problem is that the sub procedure needs to be run multiple times in order for this to take effect. For instance when I run through it once it removes about half of the dates, run through it again and it does the same, I usually F5 it about 5 times to confirm its complete. While this is fine in debugging I need to know this will work perfectly everytime.</p>

<p>The following is one iteration of my game loop:</p>

<pre><code>input &lt;- getInput -- where input is some list of pressed keys
let world' = update world input
-- ... continue with the next iteration
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>getInput</code> function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>getInput = do
    w &lt;- getKey $ CharKey 'W'
    q &lt;- getKey $ CharKey 'Q'
    -- ...
    return [(""W"", w), ...]
</code></pre>

<p>and the <code>update</code> function (inside the <code>World.hs</code> file) looks like:</p>

<pre><code>update world input = world'
    where world' = -- if w, then do something, if q then do something, etc.
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, my input logic is split between my actual <code>Input.hs</code> file and my <code>World.hs</code> file. The update function shouldn't really need to test for key press (in my opinion).</p>

<p>How do I split my input from my updating logic?</p>

<hr>

<p>I am looking for something like callbacks, I suppose, which can be registered and unregistered at will. Registering <code>moveForward</code> to the key press of <code>W</code> would be ideal.</p>

<p>I have also looked into netwire - but I am having a hard time wrapping my head around functional reactive programming. If this is a case for FRP, I would appreciate any examples using it, as well.</p>

I use structure as message data to send to server, server processes the data. when i run in the IOS simulator, it's right, but in the device it's wrong, I find that the structure data which the server receives from the devices client is different from the client message data! I'm sorry my English is very bad.</p>

<p>my structure code is:</p>

<pre><code> typedef struct Message
    {
        char msg[4000];
        char name[256];
        bool isBroadcast;
        bool islogin;
        USER userInfo;
    }__attribute__((packed)) MessageType;
</code></pre>

<p>user code is :</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct user
{
    int id_number;
    char name[256];
    char password[20];
    char *p_chatlog;
    struct sockaddr user_addr;
    int sock;
} __attribute__((packed)) USER;
</code></pre>

<p>send code is :</p>

<pre><code>MessageType *loginMsg = (MessageType *)malloc(sizeof(MessageType));
bzero(loginMsg, sizeof(MessageType));
loginMsg-&gt;islogin = true;
const char *name_str = [userName.text UTF8String];
memcpy(&amp;(loginMsg-&gt;userInfo.name), name_str, strlen(name_str));

const char *password_str = [password.text UTF8String];
memcpy(&amp;(loginMsg-&gt;userInfo.password), password_str, strlen(password_str));
write(m_sock, loginMsg, sizeof(MessageType));
free(loginMsg);

"5808151","1","5808235","","2011-04-27 17:32:05","","2","3695","<p>I would prefer to see if there is a reasonable way to handle this without using a second thread due to the specifics of this application (originally a DOS app with lots of global static variables, converted to Windows/MFC, but not designed from the ground up to be multi-threaded - just making it multiple document aware was a major undertaking).</p>

<p>The application in question is trying to do a very computationally intensive operation which has the side-effect of modifying the current document.  It wants to be able to update the main window &amp; document windows iteratively as the process is performed.</p>

<p>Doing the simple approach: loop through the work-items, issuing drawing on the document's window, modifying the document's underlying data, and updating the status bar with status text indicating x of y complete usually works.  But sometimes the app stops updating both the status bar and the document's window (view) until the entire job is completed, and then everything updates at once.</p>

<p>So there aren't any hang-conditions in the code.  i.e. it never fails to complete.  It's purely a matter of failing to process window messages for the duration (since this is a single threaded application, for the most part).</p>

<p>I thought the obvious approach would be to put a PeekMessage() loop within the task-loop to dispatch any accumulated messages.  I was assuming that this is the reason that the visual updates stop occurring: there must be a windows message in either the view's, the main-frame's, or the thread's message queue blocking the direct updates to the screen.</p>

<p>However, perhaps the issue is something else?</p>

<p>Regardless, it just seems like a bad idea for our app to ignore the message queue for what can be eons of processing time (the user will perceive the app as ""stopped responding"" if they ask Task Manager just due to the lack of processing our message queue).</p>

<p>However, the following loop becomes infinite:</p>

<pre><code>    // dispatch the messages until we're out of them again...
    for (MSG msg; PeekMessage(&amp;msg, NULL,  0, 0, PM_REMOVE); )
    {
        TraceMessage(msg.message, msg.wParam, msg.lParam);
        if (msg.message == WM_QUIT)
            return;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: TraceMessage() simply outputs a human-friendly trace to the debugger window of what message &amp; arguments this is.  In this case, it is WM_PAINT.</p>

<p>So the paint message, even though it's being requested to be removed, seems to sit in the queue forever (or new ones are being generated somehow infinitely).</p>

<hr>

<p>Questions:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Could I have it all wrong, and the reason our applications stops being able to update the status bar &amp; view is something else?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a better approach to a long cpu or disk I/o intensive operation than placing a PeekMessage loop within the task loop (that doesn't involve re-architecting the entire application to be more multi-thread-friendly)?</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Solution I'm going with...</p>

<pre><code>void DoSomethingLengthy()
{
    CWaitCursor wait;

    // disable our application windows much as if we were running a modal dialog
    // in order to lock out the user from interacting with us until we're doing doing this thing
    AfxGetMainWnd()-&gt;BeginModalState();

    while (bMoreWorkToDo)
    {
        // empty any generated / received thread &amp; window messages
        for (MSG msg; PeekMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE|PM_NOYIELD); ) 
            AfxPumpMessage();

        // for some reason, our cursor reverts to the normal pointer
        // so force ourselves to continue to have the wait-cursor until we're really done
        AfxGetMainWnd()-&gt;RestoreWaitCursor();


        // here's where we do one work-item
        // ...
    }

    // restore our prior state
    AfxGetMainWnd()-&gt;EndModalState();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, this is very old technology, and not necessarily the best approach.  It is however feasible and highly useful for this context.  We already have a complex app that uses the OnIdle mechanic for a multitude of purposes, making it less attractive as a possible approach.</p>

My idea was to write a .c subroutine that calls the gsl rountine and depends on a function and bounds. Two problems: I have only very little idea about c and fortrans iso_c_binding. My attempt is as follows:</p>

<p>A simple calling program (similar to M.S.B's post in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7347959/no-output-from-a-fortran-program-using-the-gnu-scientific-library-via-a-c-wrappe/7351916#7351916"">No output from a Fortran program using the Gnu Scientific Library via a c wrapper</a> ):</p>

<pre><code>program test

   use iso_c_binding

   interface
      function  my_cquad (f,a,b)  bind(c)
         import
         real (kind=c_double) :: my_cquad

         interface
            function f(x) bind(c)
               import
               real(kind=c_double) :: f,x

      end function my_cquad
   end interface

   real (kind=c_double) :: y,a,b

   a=0. ; b=1.
   y=my_cquad(g,a,b)
   print*,y

   stop

contains

   function g(x) bind(C)
      real(kind=c_double) :: g,x
      g=sin(x)/x
      return
   end function g

end program test
</code></pre>

<p>The .c subroutine (basically taken from the example given by the author of CQUAD in <a href=""http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/4730/numerical-integration-handling-nans-c-fortran"">http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/4730/numerical-integration-handling-nans-c-fortran</a>):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;gsl/gsl_integration.h&gt;

double my_cquad ( double my_f() , double a , double b  )
{
    gsl_function f;
    gsl_integration_cquad_workspace *ws = NULL;
    double res, abserr;
    size_t neval;

    /* Prepare the function. */
    f.function = my_f;
    f.params = NULL;

    /* Initialize the workspace. */
    if ( ( ws = gsl_integration_cquad_workspace_alloc( 200 ) ) == NULL ) {
        printf( ""call to gsl_integration_cquad_workspace_alloc failed.\n"" );
        abort();
        }

    /* Call the integrator. */
    if ( gsl_integration_cquad( &amp;f, a , b , 1.0e-10 , 1.0e-10 , ws , &amp;res , &amp;abserr , &amp;neval ) != 0 ) {
        printf( ""call to gsl_integration_cquad failed.\n"" );
        abort();
        }

    /* Free the workspace. */
    gsl_integration_cquad_workspace_free( ws );

    /* Bye. */
    return res;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The .c subroutine alone seems to work fine. This can be tested with:</p>

<pre><code>double g (double x)
{
return sin(x)/x;
}

int main () {
double y;
y=my_cquad(g,0.,1.);
printf(""y:    %2.18f\n"", y);

return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But together with the .f90 calling program, at the moment it compiles but at runtime I get a segmentation fault that I don't quite get.</p>

<p>Additionally, it would of course be good to have some kind of wrapper that creates a c-type function depending on a fortran type function. I'm thinking about something like:</p>

<pre><code>function f_to_c(f) bind(c)
   real(kind=c_double) :: f_to_c
   real(kind=8) :: f
   f_to_c=real(f,kind=c_double)
end function
</code></pre>

<p>But this desn't cover the dummy variables.</p>

<p>If I leave out the ""setAndSaveSessionData"" Part, the login doesn't work at all, after a page redirect the login data are gone and the user is logged out again. But the setAndSaveSessionData stores the session in a cookie and the user will remain logged in even after closing the browser - which is a behaviour I do not want (not without the user's consent). Is there a way to manually login the user without the ""setAndSaveSessionData"" part? I'm using Typo3 6.2.12 with extbase and felogin </p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance! </p>

I am using Rails 3.0.3, Ruby 1.8.7 (patchlevel 334), Apache, Passenger 3.0.7 and the Devise gem 1.1.8.  Also, I am using gmail for sending out emails.  When I attempt to send a password reset I am getting an error in my Apache error_log:</p>

<p>[Tue Nov 01 19:40:31 2011] [error] Premature end of script headers: users
[ pid=9371 thr=3084437904 file=ext/apache2/Hooks.cpp:822 time=2011-11-01 19:40:31.664 ]: The backend application (process 9569) did not send a valid HTTP response; instead, it sent nothing at all. It is possible that it has crashed; please check whether there are crashing bugs in this application.</p>

<p>From my research, I found one reason that it could be due to Ruby on Rails looking for a version of OpenSSL that is buggy.  I tried the suggestion of adding this to my .bashrc file:</p>

<p>export RUBYOPT=""-ropenssl""</p>

<p>Also, I tried to update my SMTP configuration in my production.rb to not use TLS:</p>

<p>:enable_starttls_auto => false</p>

<p>My complete SMTP configuration:</p>

<pre><code>config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host =&gt; '&lt;domain&gt;' }
  ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
  :enable_starttls_auto =&gt; false,
  :address =&gt; ""smtp.gmail.com"",
  :port =&gt; 587,
  :domain =&gt; &lt;domain&gt;,
  :user_name =&gt; &lt;username&gt;,
  :password =&gt; &lt;password&gt;,
  :authentication =&gt; ""plain"" 
}
</code></pre>

<p>None of the suggestions I have found seem to have worked.  I am not sure where to go from here as these are the only suggestions and fixes I have found.  It does work without any issues on my development machine.  Which is running the same versions of all the above except Apache/Passenger, which I do not us locally.  </p>

<p>Looping through current_user.friends in a view gives <em>a user's friends</em>, and lets you access all the normal user fields. e.g. .email, .name etc. on each.</p>

<p>Now i'd like to paginate and apply search_for to current_user.friends, like I normally do on my user model stuff, but it doesn't work.</p>

<p>So this, works:</p>

<pre><code>User.order('created_at desc').search_for(params[:search]).paginate(per_page: 10, page: params[:page])
</code></pre>

<p>But this</p>

<pre><code>current_user.friends.search_for(params[:search]).paginate(per_page: 10, page: params[:page])
</code></pre>

<p>gives</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError (undefined method `search_for' for #&lt;Array:0x007faac0b0db10&gt;):

<p>or this, when I knock out search_for</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError (undefined method `paginate' for #&lt;Array:0x007faac015c7d8&gt;):

<p>Hoping there is a simple answer here!</p>

While building the annotations I store a link between annotation and building so I can assign the right building and open the right segue afterwards.</p>

<p>In iOS 6 they get built really fast, I also enabled animation while adding them, so one pin got dropped after the other, but with apple maps in iOS7 this isn't possible anymore (?). Now building those 100 annotations takes over 1 second on my iPhone 4S and that's too long. Is there anyway to improve the code?</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad

...

//creating annotations
    annotationlink = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.count; i++) {
        NSDictionary *dataItem = [data objectAtIndex:i];

        //storing annotation in array for link
        Annotation *buildingannotation = [[Annotation alloc] init];
        NSNumber *index = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:i];
        NSDictionary *dict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:index, indexKey, buildingannotation, annotationKey, nil];
        [annotationlink addObject:dict];

        buildingannotation.title = [dataItem objectForKey:@""Building""];
        buildingannotation.subtitle = [dataItem objectForKey:@""Info""];

        MKCoordinateRegion buildingcoordinates;
        buildingcoordinates.center.latitude = [[dataItem objectForKey:@""Latitude""] floatValue];
        buildingcoordinates.center.longitude = [[dataItem objectForKey:@""Longitude""] floatValue];
        buildingannotation.coordinate = buildingcoordinates.center;

        [self.mapView addAnnotation:buildingannotation];
    }


- (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(id &lt;MKAnnotation&gt;)annotation
{
    if ([annotation isKindOfClass:[MKUserLocation class]]){
        return nil;
    }

    MKAnnotationView *pinView = (MKAnnotationView *)
    [self.mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier:pinIdentifier];

    MKAnnotationView *customAnnotationView = [[MKAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotation:annotation reuseIdentifier:pinIdentifier];
    customAnnotationView.canShowCallout = YES;

    //right button to detail view
    UIButton* disclosureButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeDetailDisclosure];
    customAnnotationView.rightCalloutAccessoryView = disclosureButton;

    //left button for image
    NSInteger *buildingindex = [self getIndex:annotation];
    NSDictionary *dataItem = [data objectAtIndex:buildingindex];
    NSString* filename = [dataItem objectForKey:@""Thumb""];
    filename = [filename stringByAppendingString:@""@2x.jpg""];

    NSString* resourceimagePath = [resourcePath stringByAppendingPathComponent:filename];
    Image = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:resourceimagePath];

    UIImageView *AnnotationThumb = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:Image];
    AnnotationThumb.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 31, 31);
    customAnnotationView.leftCalloutAccessoryView = AnnotationThumb;

    //annotation image
    customAnnotationView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""Annotation_white.png""];

    return customAnnotationView;
    return pinView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>the following function gets the index of the current annotation using nspredicate to filter the array with the dictionaries. the advantage of this is the fact, that i can also use it when calloutAccessoryControlTapped:</p>

<pre><code>-(NSInteger*) getIndex:(Annotation*)searchannotation
{
    NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""%K == %@"", annotationKey, searchannotation];
    NSArray *filteredarray = [annotationlink filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];
    NSDictionary *building = [filteredarray objectAtIndex:0];
    NSInteger *buildingIndex = [[building objectForKey:indexKey] integerValue];
    return buildingIndex;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With an iPhone 4S the last pin is built 1.14 seconds after the view gets loaded.</p>

<p>if i search the annotation link array manually instead of using nspredicate function like this:</p>

<pre><code>//left button for image
    int buildingIndex;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; annotationlink.count; i++) {
        NSDictionary *annotationDict = [annotationlink objectAtIndex:i];
        if ([[annotationDict objectForKey:annotationKey] isEqual:annotation]) {
            buildingIndex= [[annotationDict objectForKey:indexKey] integerValue];
            i = annotationlink.count;
        }
    }

    NSDictionary *dataItem = [data objectAtIndex:buildingIndex];
</code></pre>

<p>the log says that the last pin is built 1.89 seconds after the viewDidLoad.</p>

<p>if i create the annotations in viewDidApper instead of viewDidLoad the View is shown off course immediately but the background takes some time to load so until the pins are dropped everything is gray which is also not very nice...</p>

What has just occurred to me after writing my first bit of code is the question of whether or not gfortran will optimise an expression using array syntax by placing the expression in a single loop. In most array-based interpreters an expression such as A=B/n*2*pi (where B is an array) would require 5 loops and multiple array temporaries to evaluate. Is gfortran clever enough to optimise this out, and will my code below (the line that calculates the array from 0 to 2pi) be as efficient as an explicit do loop around the expression? Is there anything I should look out for when using array syntax if I'm worried about performance?</p>

<p>I have a 2 models

<p>Devices has a type column. For example it can be a Tablet or a Smart Phone.</p>

<p>I then have another model <strong>Ownership</strong></p>

<p>This model belongs to both Users and Devices so it will have entries in the table matching users to devices representing that that user owns that device. </p>

<p>I need to setup some validations on the <strong>Ownership</strong> model the primary ones begin. </p>

<ul>
<li>No device can have more than one ownership entry (simple as validating that device_id column is unique)</li>
<li>A user can only have ownership of one device for each type of device available. </li>
</ul>

<p>So how would I make a validation for this last part? I can't set the client_id table to unique because they will have multiple entries for different types of devices. But I want them to only have one row per type of device. </p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. Please let me know if you need more details. I would appreciate any insight!</p>

<p>Program Run Location(<strong>PRL</strong>)--> G:\Users\\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\Comics Project\ZipEntryDemo2\ZipEntryDemo2\bin\Debug</p>

<p>In first run of the program a folder named temp gets created at the program location (PRL\temp).
After closing the application and running again the temp directory created at first step is not empty; rather the lblAddress shows the value G:\temp ; which actually doesn't even exists.</p>

<p>Then I explicitly created a folder G:\temp and put some extra file and folder in it, for test purposes, the program now removes all files and folders from G:\temp and PRL\temp is still as it is with all contents.</p>

<p>Actually my program passes the location of the temp folder, i.e. PRL\temp to a method which extracts it's contents in that folder. In every run contents always extracts in PRL\temp;
but G:\temp 's content is lost provided the folder exists.</p>

<p>One peculiar thing also is that when I was debugging  at the first run since the temp directory doesn't exist's at PRL if condition statement doesn't executes and program creates a folder at the correct location, i.e. PRL\temp.
It's just that files and folders are checked for the wrong folder G:\temp</p>

<p>I am not getting any exception like folder already exists or of any kind till now.</p>

<p>I also noticed that if I change ""\temp"" to ""temp"", now all things happens in the correct location, i.e. PRL\temp; and there is no G:\temp in middle. My program works fine. But I find it weird and would appreciate if someone could explain that. Thanks, and sorry if it's a very silly question, this is some of my first experiences with IO.</p>

<p>I followed the Oracle instructions to sign the jar and then used the jarsigner tool to verify the jar. Supposedly, it was fine.</p>

<p>In the .jnlp file, I included the security tag with all-permissions:  </p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>    &lt;security&gt;
        &lt;all-permissions/&gt;
    &lt;/security&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the program launches, however, <strong>I never see a dialog prompting the user to accept the certificate</strong> or asking for some kind of permission to run on the client computer.  It was my understanding that I should see such a dialog, according to Oracle documentation.</p>

<p>I have read this page on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10918777/jnlp-get-a-permission"">JNLP get a permission</a></p>

<p>and I have a similar situation in that I get a security exception.  In my case, the exception is thrown when the app attempts to show a filechooser dialog:</p>

<pre><code>java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission user.home read)
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the user was never asked to provide permission.  I believe I followed the advice on that stackoverflow page, but it doesn't seem to be working for me.  It's like the jar appears to be unsigned.  I even tried removing the all-permissions tag and got exactly the same behavior.</p>

<p>I have looked inside the jar and I can see that the two required files are in there:  MYKEY.DSA and MYKEY.SF.  I looked inside the readable one (.SF) and it contains the text that should be there.  I believe that is all the jar needs in order to be signed.  </p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) Does it matter what the names are of the .DSA and .SF files are, with respect to the app?  Currently they just have the name of the alias I used with keytool.</p>

<p>2) Does it matter if the java version on my server is 1.7 while the java version on my development computer is 1.6?  I need to compile in 1.6 because our school has not upgraded to 1.7, so when it runs on client computers it needs to be 1.6.</p>

<p>3) Is there a way to determine which version of jarsigner I am using when I run it from the terminal?  I tried jarsigner -version, but that is not one of the options.  I notice that the top of the MYKEY.SF file looks like this:</p>

    Name: org/arps/tranz/TranzActionMap.class
    SHA1-Digest: dSI3RKfgUrRHbwnZLyXbkiJLWdU=
</code></pre>

<p>Does this mean that there is actually some older version of jarsigner running?  I didn't think Java 1.4 was still on my computer.  In any case, my version of jarsigner seems to create the same kind of file as seen here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/intro.html</a></p>

<p>I don't know if files created by a 1.6 jarsigner or 1.7 jarsigner look any different, or if it should matter.</p>

<p>4) If the version of jarsigner is the culprit, how do I force a newer version of jarsigner to run from the terminal (Ubuntu)? </p>

<p>Thanks for your help.  As I said at the start, I am an amateur programmer.  All I really want to do is to be ready for my classes next week.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>After struggling for quite a time with a jar tool that couldn't find libjli.so, I have now successfully used the 1.6 jar tool and jarsigner tool, so that the top of the MYKEY.SF file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Signature-Version: 1.0
    SHA1-Digest-Manifest-Main-Attributes: DGUFMaJYirZi//67NI+M5RVi63k=

    SHA1-Digest-Manifest: ZPS3aOyPW/tymxbGdfe4/qBVK/g=
</code></pre>

<p>But I still get the same behavior, where the app starts to launch without asking the user to accept the certificate.  So now my main question is:</p>

<p><strong>Does it matter that the jar was created with 1.6 while my server is running 1.7?</strong>  </p>

<p>I don't know how much java activity actually happens on the server.  At some point, it switches over to the client computer but I assume parts of jnlp happen on the server first.</p>

In general, the problem is predicting the financial values. So, because I am given the sequence of financial data as an input, I thought that RNN would be better. On the other hand, I think that if I can fit the data into some structure, I can train with DNN much better because training phase is easier in DNN than RNN. For example, I could get last 1 month info and keep 30 inputs and predict 31'th day while using DNN. 
I dont understand the advantage of RNN over DNN in this perspective. My first question is about proper usage of RNN or DNN in this problem.</p>

<p>When I simulated it first we add a 0 value to an value we called a. And the ALU shows 0 bit 1 during this operation. But when I assigned another 0 to an value b the ALU shows 4. And in the end when i added a and b with an add and put the result with an sw into the register the ALU showed 8.</p>

<p>My goal is to be able to ""paint"" the circles as I drag the mouse over them. I will eventually want to use selection shapes that will change the color of all the circles contained within the selection shape. </p>

<p>I'm using a mouse dragging listener that continually scans the entire 2d array and checks is the current point is inside on of the circles. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>        addMouseMotionListener(new MouseAdapter() {

        public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {

            currentColor = ColorSliderPanel.getRGB();

                for (int y = 0; y &lt; numRows; y++) {
                    if (circle[x][y].contains(e.getX(), e.getY())) {

                        circle[x][y].setColor(currentColor);
                        repaint();

        }

</code></pre>

<p>The above code works, but it's really slow (1000+ circles), as it is checking every single object. </p>

<p>There must be a better way. I've read a little about a Quadtree, but I'm not sure if a quadtree is more horsepower than I need. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I made the following changes based on some of the comments below. Circles is now a linear ArrayList. The draw method simply fill the circle. Making this change improved the speed by two orders of magnitude. It works much better now. Although, I can still sweep across the panel with moderate speed and miss a few circles. So I may need to optimize futher.</p>

<pre><code>  Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) getGraphics();

            for (Circle2D c : circles) {
                if (c.contains(p)) {
                    c.setColor(currentColor);
                   //Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) getGraphics(); (moved)
                    c.draw(g2d);

<p>Here is the function in a vb.net module that I call from the form,  if you can see something's wrong with my query, please tell also:</p>

        Return cmd.ExecuteReader


    End Function
</code></pre>

<p>And in the form I have this one, I load both the data into the datagridview and in the textboxes, thats why I called 2 methods/functions. This one is in the textbox_textchanged:</p>

<pre><code>    Dim rdr As Odbc.OdbcDataReader

<p>I known that is due to the fact that this is now a sorted array because before I implemented this feature it worked fine though I haven't got a clue of how to fix it.</p>

<p>Here is the code I use to delete things from the array:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) tableView:(UITableView *)tv commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    if ( editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete ) {
        Patient *thisPatient = [patients objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];

            [self.tableView setEditing:NO animated:YES];
        }
        [self deletePatientFromDatabase:thisPatient.patientid];
        [tv deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationLeft];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is being stopped at this line:</p>

<pre><code>[tv deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationLeft];
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code that I use for sorting the array:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) processForTableView:(NSMutableArray *)items {

    for (Patient *thisPatient in items) {
        NSString *firstCharacter = [thisPatient.patientName substringToIndex:1];
        if (![charIndex containsObject:firstCharacter]) {
            [charIndex addObject:firstCharacter];
            [charCount setObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1] forKey:firstCharacter];
        } else {
            [charCount setObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:[[charCount objectForKey:firstCharacter] intValue] + 1] forKey:firstCharacter];
        }
    }
    charIndex = (NSMutableArray *) [charIndex sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare:)];
}
- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tv cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
        UITableViewCell *cell = [tv dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@""cell""];
        NSString *letter = [charIndex objectAtIndex:[indexPath section]];
        NSPredicate *search = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""patientName beginswith[cd] %@"", letter];

    NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@""patientName"" ascending:YES];

    NSArray *filteredArray = [[patients filteredArrayUsingPredicate:search] sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:[NSArray arrayWithObject:sortDescriptor]];

    cell.textLabel.textColor = [UIColor blackColor];
    if (self.editing) {
        [cell setSelectionStyle:UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone];
    }
    return cell;
}

<p>I have monthly activity data (40+ years) for individuals, tracking changes to a membership.  Individuals can join the service, remain for an indefinite period of time, quit, and rejoin later.  The changes have a specific code for when they leave the service.  I am trying to find a way to follow these quit/ rejoin cycles for each individual, and increment a column value, showing how many times they've been in the service, and associating the history records during the period.</p>

<p>Using analytic functions, I can detect their first appearance, and when they leave, and when they're BACK in after leaving.  I haven't figured out a way to use this toincrement a column and carry that value forward until the end for that individual.</p>

<p>It's not a sequence, because each individual starts at ""1"".  Row number hasn't worked for me for the logic/partition combinations that I've tried.  I've tried subqueries with CASE statements on the change code and then using LAST_VALUE to carry those forward in the outer query - but I'm just not finding a way to get the right increment or carry it forward.  I just not getting it.</p>

<p>I have fiddled this, with the core query that I've started with.<br>

<ul>
<li><p>RecNo is the record number from the source table. </p>

<p>UNIQ is the unique identifier for an individual. </p>

<p>SYM is the date of a change, an ALPHANUMERIC date string, 'YYYYMM' -
I handle some invalid months in other code. </p>

<p>MCHTY is the activity Change code.  Activity codes can be '0' to '6',
with '6' being the ""leaves the service"" indicator.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The records are ordered by the date of the change, then by the type of the change.</p>

<p>In the example query results, </p>

<ul>
<li><p>HISTREC is the row number for an individual history</p>

<p>PREMCHTY is the most recent Change code (Lag)</p>

<p>JOIN_SVC - first record in a set</p>

<p>REJOIN_SVC - first record after leaving</p>

<p>SVC (or SVC_NUM in the example) is what I'm trying to generate - the
""nth"" time in the service as I think it should be.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>How can I get query/calculate/generate the contents of the SVC field, incrementing it for each new period of time, after an individual leaves ('6')?</p>

<p>Ultimately, the unique ID and incremented svc number combination will be used to create a master record for each time an individual is in the service.  </p>

<p>Background:  I'm trying to replace a lot of procedural code and logic left over from PL/1 procedural days, but ""updated"" by putting it in PL/SQL procedures with multi-nested cursors, and sharing field values across a set of records through IN/OUT parameters.<br>
Data size is about 5 millions of records, about 270k individual IDs.  I'd like to handle the individual's history records as a set, using SQL to replace most of the field transformations.  If I'm approaching this wrong, or if there's a better way, then let me know.</p>

Each one contains a few strings, some boolean values, etc. This is a fairly quick process, takes a few seconds, tops, but it's a bit unwieldy using a .plist with thousands of objects.</p>

<p>I'm going to migrate to Core Data (which I've never used before), so the initial step is going to be getting the data from that .plist into those custom objects, then saving them in the context. I've watched the videos and such, and think I'm going to be okay doing that.</p>

<p>My first question is: <strong>can I create the object graph and data model in a small, separate app (say, called ObjectMaker), then save it there, and import the .sqlite or whatever format I export my data as into the actual app I'm making?</strong> From there, I'd be performing all of the fetch requests, further editing and saving of the data, etc.</p>

<p>My second question is: <strong>is it possible to provide a ""first launch state"" of an object graph that a user would get on first opening my app (with those 5,000 objects ready-made and ready to be accessed / queried, etc.?</strong> I'd like the app to ship with the .sqlite or whatever format I export my data to in the ObjectMaker app, and use that exclusively, without ever knowing that the .plist existed.</p>

<p>I use bitwise operations to find the combinations. Each combination is constructed as an ArrayList(Integer), called ""writeitem"". I then want to store these in another ArrayList, called ""master"", which has to have the form ArrayList(ArrayList(Integer)). [for formatting reasons &lt;> have to be replaced with (); they don't show up otherwise...]</p>

<p>The problem arises when attempting to save each combination to the ""master"" ArrayList. If you run the code below, the printf function will show that the combination is constructed correctly. However, once I ask for it to be ""added"" to ""master"", it doesn't seem to be appended to the end of ""master"". Rather, all of ""master"" is overwritten with i copies of the combination just constructed.</p>

<p>So, for example, if I call the function on [1,2,3,4,5], my ""master"" array ends up being 31 copies of [1,2,3,4,5] (the 31st combination to be found).</p>

<p>I imagine this has something to do with using nested array lists, and there's a better way to achieve what I want. But it's equally possible I am committing some other novice error.</p>

    for(int i=1;i&lt;32;i++){

        writeitem.clear(); //clear before constructing next combination

        if((i &amp; 1)&gt;0){          //check if each element is present in combination
            writeitem.add(x[0]);
        }

            writeitem.add(x[1]);

However, when using generic collections of a type found in a signed assembly, that type is strictly versioned based on its assembly.</p>

<p>Here is what I've found works. </p>

<pre><code>internal class WeaklyNamedAppDomainAssemblyBinder : SerializationBinder
{
    public override Type BindToType(string assemblyName, string typeName)
    {
        ResolveEventHandler handler = new ResolveEventHandler(CurrentDomain_AssemblyResolve);
        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += handler;

        Type returnedType;
        try
        {
            AssemblyName asmName = new AssemblyName(assemblyName);
            var assembly = Assembly.Load(asmName);
            returnedType = assembly.GetType(typeName);
        }
        catch
        {
            returnedType = null;
        }
        finally
        {
            AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve -= handler;
        }

        return returnedType;
    }

    Assembly CurrentDomain_AssemblyResolve(object sender, ResolveEventArgs args)
    {
        string truncatedAssemblyName = args.Name.Split(',')[0];
        Assembly assembly = Assembly.Load(truncatedAssemblyName);
        return assembly;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, causing the binding process to change globally seems rather dangerous to me.  Strange things could happen if serialization was happening in multiple threads.  Perhaps a better solution is to do some regex manipulation of the typeName?  </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  The string based method does not work.  Generics apparently need a full strongly named type.  Quite heinous if you ask me.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>So say I have a basic table:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;col 1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Col 2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;sweet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;tooth&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I have 200 rows in the body section and want to make it so that when I scroll the thead section stays on top while everything else flows underneath it. Is there anyway to do this in CSS?</p>

<p>Following styles:</p>

<pre><code>div {
    max-height:400px;
    overflow:auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out how to do this. I tried to make the scroll part just tbody, but when I do that the max-height portion doesn't take effect for some odd reason. Also if I break it up into 2 tables then the columns won't be the correct widths. I also can't state what the widths are beforehand as the data changes rapidly so it needs to be able to be changeable. </p>

<p>Any ideas? I'm lost.</p>

<p>I get my data from a query.</p>

<p>Sorry if I post a lot of code, but it's all needed and I'm not sure how to do a MCVE as I'm pretty new at working with PDF.</p>

<p>This issue is:</p>

<p>Before writing next block of code I check current Y coord, I can achieve this, but when I need to create new Page and start writing again, well happens <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-z424N1EYicYkp1SXdESnRFcmM/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a></p>

<p>Here are the codes used in the PDF:</p>

<pre><code>public float checkContentStream(float y) throws Exception {
    float newY = checkYCoord(y, 3, 10);
    if (newY == 700) {
        if (content != null) {
        content.close();
        }

        File file = new File(logoPath);
        PDJpeg logoImg = new PDJpeg(doc, new FileInputStream(file));
        PDPage page = new PDPage(PDPage.PAGE_SIZE_LETTER);
        doc.addPage(page);
        content = new PDPageContentStream(doc, page);
        content.drawImage(logoImg, 50, 720);
        rHeader();
    }
    return newY;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This method checks if reached BOTTOM MARGIN = 60</p>

<pre><code>private float checkYCoord(float y, int lines, int space) {
    float newY = y;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; lines; i++) {
        if ((newY - space) &lt;= BOTTOM_MARGIN) {
        newY = 700f;
        return newY;
        } else {
        newY = newY - space;
        }
    }
    return y;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This method does the same as 1st but used both, I know I shouldn't and must not use hardcoded values, like 10 or 3.</p>

<pre><code>public float checkContentStream(float y, int lines, int space) throws Exception {
    float newY = checkYCoord(y, lines, space);

        }
        File file = new File(logoPath);
        PDJpeg logoImg = new PDJpeg(doc, new FileInputStream(file));
        PDPage page = new PDPage(PDPage.PAGE_SIZE_LETTER);
        doc.addPage(page);
        content = new PDPageContentStream(doc, page);
        content.drawImage(logoImg, 50, 720);
        rHeader();
    }
}

public float rText(float x, float y, int space, String labelField, String value, int fieldSize) throws Exception {
    if(fieldSize == 1){
        return rText(x, y, space, labelField, value, FIELD_WIDTH, VALUE_WIDTH);

    else{
        if(fieldSize == 2){
        return rText(x, y, space, labelField, value, FIELD_WIDTH, DESC_WIDTH);
        }
        else{
        return rText(x, y, space, labelField, value, FIELD_WIDTH, TEXT_WIDTH);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm almost sure the error comes from this method:</p>

<pre><code>public float rText(float x, float y, int space, String labelField, String value, int fieldWidth, int valueWidth) throws Exception {
    PDFont font = PDType1Font.TIMES_BOLD;
    content.setFont(font, 9);
    float y1 = 0f;
    float y2 = 0f;
    //y = y &gt;= 700 ? 700 : checkContentStream(y, 3, 10);
    if (value == null) {
        //y = checkYCoord(y, 1, 10);
        return rText(labelField, fieldWidth, x, y - 19, space, font, false);
        }else {

        return y2;
        } else {

<p>I recently came across the <a href=""http://fuppes.ulrich-voelkel.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">fuppes UPnP media server</a> and it seemed great. I installed it on my home server and started using it to stream video to my XBox. It worked really really well and I was happy with it. Then I upgraded my servers distribution and fuppes stopped working; I now know that it's because various libraries have depreciated, most specifically <a href=""http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/08/msg00783.html"" rel=""nofollow"">debian has started dropping the .la libtool files from the majority of their packages</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem / Question</strong></p>

<p>So my question is, how do I build fuppes now that I don't have those .la files for libtool? More specifically, this is my exact error message:</p>

<pre><code>/bin/sed: can't read /usr/lib/libogg.la: No such file or directory
libtool: link: `/usr/lib/libogg.la' is not a valid libtool archive
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have a /usr/lib/libogg.la file anymore. This proves it from the terminal:</p>

<pre><code># dpkg -L libogg-dev | grep ""a$""
/usr/lib/libogg.a
#
</code></pre>

<p>I just need to be pointed in the right direction really. I've read the libtool-automake docs but I'm still missing that piece of information that tells me how to compile now that I don't have libogg.la anymore. So in short, how do I compile in the absence of .la files?</p>

It's a complex system of copying, replacing, and deleting specific parts of DOCX files and XLSX files. I'm using XML powertools ""DocumentBuilder"" to assemble the document during the process of generating the proposal. The issue I'm having is as follows. Because of the age of the template files and the sheer number of options I must deal with Document builder ends up ignoring some of the margin settings throughout the length of the document. What I want to do to solve my formatting issue is iterate through each paragraph in the XML file and look for the properties, then drill into that element and check to see if I need to modify an existing margin entry or add a new one. My goal is for each paragraph element to have a section entry containing the default margin parameters for the document. This should alleviate the formatting issue. I can't seem to get it to work though. I've tried several different ways to change the XML file to no avail...</p>

I'm new to web development and I've been trying to create a simple app using <code>angularjs</code> and <code>bootstrap</code>. There's no much content on my pages, only a couple of <code>inputs</code> and <code>buttons</code> that do nothing.
I placed <code>ng-view</code> in the <strong>index.html</strong> page as I saw in many tutorials and that allows me to navigate to all my pages. I'm trying to add a navigation bar to all my pages once a user logs in, so I placed another <code>ng-view</code> on my home(page after user logs in), but it seems that <strong>angular</strong> allows only one view for each app. And also it doesn't allow nested app. If I'm wrong, please correct me (that's what I understood from my Google 'research').
So, my question is: how can I add a navigation bar(or any same html content) to all my pages after the user logs in without copying the same code in each html page?
Btw, I had this working with <code>jQuery</code>, but I don't know how to do it using <strong>angularjs</strong>

The server sends an xdebug request to the client which seems to get stuck in the windows firewall if there is no client application (e.g. phpstorm) listening on the xdebug port. This results in a timeout in the browser trying to open a website from the development server.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be the Stealth Mode of the Windows firewall which cannot be disabled and does not send an ICMP Port Unreachable back to the debug server.</p>

<p>The only solution found so far is turning of the firewall completely for the internal domain.</p>

<p>Is there any chance of getting rid of this behavior without having to install special software on any windows client in the network trying to open a website on the development server?</p>

<p>One of the following options would be a good solution for us - but we do not know how to achieve it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having a special php / xdebug configuration for subdomains</li>
<li>Changing the behavior of the windows firewall on the xdebug port</li>
</ul>

<p>The following options were discarded due to one reason or the other:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing a client application (e.g. PHPStorm) listening on the corresponding port on every windows client.</li>
<li>Turning off the windows firewall completely.</li>
<li>Turning off xdebug completely or requiring special request parameters on each request.</li>

I can't tell it to start at a numbered-position and return a specified number of characters; I have to compute the end position myself.  And if I specify an end position beyond the end of the String, instead of just returning the rest of the String for me, Java throws an Exception.</p>

<p>I'm used to languages where substring() (or substr()) takes two parameters: a start position, and a length.  Is this objectively better than the way Java does it, and if so, can you prove it?  What's the best language specification for substring() that you have seen, and when if ever would it be a good idea for a language to do things differently?  Is that IndexOutOfBoundsException that Java throws a good design idea, or not?  Does all this just come down to personal preference?</p>

<p>Here's the idea: Access to the CakePHP app is controlled by the server AuthType.  If the user isn't authenticated, they can't access the app at all, and instead get kicked back to the SSO login page. If they then login successfully, they are redirected back to the app and granted access by the web server.</p>

<p>At this point, CakePHP would read the contents of <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']</code> to identify the user and present him or her with the correct information.</p>

<p>Specific questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assuming we can trust that the SSO is secure, is this approach safe and robust?</li>
<li>Is it possible (or useful) to integrate this mechanism with Cake's Auth component?</li>
<li>Is it Cakey to read the <code>$_SERVER</code> super-global directly?
<li>Is there a more Cake-like way of making an application SSO aware?</li>
</ul>

<p>To clarify, I only need to know the authenticated user&mdash;I don't need (or want) to share the entire session with any other app.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just to reiterate my comment below, the SSO and all the apps will be on our servers. We won't use RealID or any other external auth mechanism.  So when I say ""external"" auth, I mean external to CakePHP but not external to our web server.</p>

#import &lt;IOBluetooth/IOBluetooth.h&gt;

@interface BBBluetoothController ()

@property (nonatomic, strong) CBCentralManager *bluetoothManager;

@end

<p>The exception is thrown in <code>-startScanning:</code> on the first line of the method. Drilling down in the stack trace, I see the exception is thrown from inside the <code>CBCentralManager</code>'s implementation:</p>

<p><code>0x7fff96c6ed49:  leaq   -413178944(%rip), %rax    ; CBCentralManager._delegate</code></p>

<pre><code>(lldb) po self
&lt;BBBluetoothController: 0x1022213b0&gt;
(lldb) po self.bluetoothManager
&lt;CBConcreteCentralManager: 0x102222180&gt;

(CBCentralManagerState) $2 = CBCentralManagerStateUnknown
(lldb) po self.bluetoothManager.delegate
&lt;BBBluetoothController: 0x1022213b0&gt;

<p>Furthermore, if I refer to the instance variable in <code>-startScanning:</code> instead of the property, everything runs without a hitch. Am I missing something obvious here?</p>

    getline(cin, text); } while (text.size() &gt; 500);
return text;
}
//Query word to search for and store as variable
string word;
string wordQuery(string msgWord) {

cout &lt;&lt; msgWord &lt;&lt; endl;

    char ch_2 = text.at(i + 1);
    char ch_3 = text.at(i + 2);
    char ch_4 = text.at(i + 3);
    cout &lt;&lt; i;

I converted 10,000 digits of Pi which gave me these <a href=""https://github.com/darshilvala/Pi_letters/commit/06f00cf4509ab0a5090093bbcc6511e323b6e47c"" rel=""nofollow"">8700 letters</a> to work with. The second step involves finding meaningful words from this generated letter sequence. I was wondering if anyone has ever worked on such a project? Can somebody post an algorithm or a linear code that will help me easily find the words of the random sequence? If not the code directly, could anyone show me a workaround of an easier approach to finding the words? </p>

<p><a href=""http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist"" rel=""nofollow"">This link</a> has all the letters from an English dictionary listed for easier selection.</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm sorry I didnt mention how the code works. The java code takes two numbers into consideration and assigns it a character (eg. o=14) since letters after 9 wont be assigned. If the number is above 25, 2 and 5 are considered separately. For example, 2526 would be z(25), b(2) and g(6) since 26 is split into 2 &amp; 6.</p>

I've been looking for the right setup on the internet and found questions and answers for them for exactly the same problem but the solutions don't work for me.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the viewarea there's a debug console reporting the statsus of the websocket.</p>

<p>So I feel like I have not made a simple mistake in the setup and it runs locally with only the change of the host name and the port number for the websocket. </p>

<p>Could it be a routing trouble after the upgrade of the connection?</p>

<p>I deploy my war file directly to the webapps directory.
I also think I got websockets working at one moment but i'm not so sure anymore. I could be looking at the localhost after all.</p>

<p>Eventually I decided to try wildfly8 gear because it ships with support for websockets. I checked out the <a href=""https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples</a> repo and deployed the chat demo to the local wildfly8  and the example worked from the first run as it is supposed. Great. But the same war file fails to work correctly on the openshift (<a href=""http://wildfly8-belgampaul.rhcloud.com/chat3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wildfly8-belgampaul.rhcloud.com/chat3/</a>)</p>

<p>I tried to use ports 80 or 8000 in both setups.

<p>I am looking for a jQuery- or JavaScript-based combobox shuttle widget that allows the user to filter the source list. The source list is a combobox (on the left) and the destination list is a second combobox (on the right).</p>

<h1>Mockup</h1>

<p>The widget should resemble:</p>



<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lm3rz.png"" alt=""mockup""></p>



<p>An existing jQuery <a href=""https://github.com/rabihkodeih/bootstrap-transfer"">widget</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ULo8q.png"" alt=""Bootstrap Transfer""></p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>The user can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Type a regex to filter the source list (e.g., <code>Toy.*</code>).
<ul>
<li>The widget hides all items that do not match the filter expression.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select one or more items in the source list (using click, control-click, and shift-click selections).</li>
<li>Click the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to transfer the items from the source list to the destination list.</li>
<li>Clear the filter to reveal the full source list.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Technical</h1>

<p>Ideally, the comboboxes would use a multiselect HTML combobox and the markup would be trivial:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=""sourceList"" id=""sourceList"" size=""20"" multiple=""multiple""&gt;
  &lt;option value=""1""&gt;Toyota&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""2""&gt;Mitsubishi&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""3""&gt;Nintendo&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""4""&gt;Samsung&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""5""&gt;Bank of Kyoto&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;select name=""destinationList"" id=""destinationList"" size=""20"" multiple=""multiple""&gt;
  &lt;option value=""6""&gt;Mazda&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""7""&gt;Fuji&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""8""&gt;Honda&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  $('#sourceList').shuttle();
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>What I want to do is, from textbox value rotate this matrix so that, for example if I write 2 and press <kbd>rotate</kbd>, program must keep both diagonal values of matrix (in this case a11, a22, a33, a13, a31) and rotate 2 times clockwise other values. So result must be like</p>

a23 a22 a21
a31 a12 a33

<p>Form 2 has 1 textbox for controlling rotation (others are generated on the fly, programmatically). What I want to do is, when I enter rotation count and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on this textbox, I want to rotate textbox matrix as I explained above. Can't figure out how to do it. </p>

<p>I have taken most code from the example, but wanted to reference a current jQuery library.</p>

    &lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have created a fiddle. Unless I turn on the <code>Migrate 1.1.0</code> script, the editor does not show the nicely formatted text area, just the bare HTML and the editor buttons do not work. </p>

<p>Here's how it currently looked like:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/wYInh.png"" alt=""JSFiddle showing the result""></p>

<p>I also have reproduced this behavior with an asp.net WebForms page and with local files. </p>

<p><strong>What can I do about it?</strong> Should I go and try to fix jHtmlArea for me? For other components on the page, I would like to use current jQuery. <strong>Will I get in trouble, when I reference both an old and newer jQuery version on the same page?</strong></p>

On this diagram it shows a picture above each text box it creates. The diagram it creates is based off a template where the picture is actually a empty text box with a picture background. This is the code which changes the background picture:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array(s_picFrame)).Select
With Selection.ShapeRange.Fill
    .Visible = msoTrue
    .UserPicture s_imageFile
    .TextureTile = msoFalse
End With
</code></pre>

<p>However the problem with this code is that the pictures inserted are very low quality, and resized/distorted to fit inside the original box. </p>

<p>Attempting to fix this problem I tried to import the pictures, but when I do this the pictures require a absolute position to be set. This doesn't work because often the pictures and text boxes need to be moved because of the amount of information in the textbox above.</p>

<p>This is the code I use to import the pictures:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddPicture Filename:=s_imageFile, linktofile:=msoFalse, _ 
savewithdocument:=msoCTrue, Left:=0, Top:=0, Width:=-1, Height:=-1

<p>Is there a way I can change either of these pieces of code to either not distort the image I'm trying to place, or to place the image above a text box?</p>

<p>I need to tokenize the query (split query into parts), suppose the following one as an example:</p>

<pre><code>These are the separate query elements ""These are compound composite terms""
</code></pre>

<p>What I eventually need is to have an array of 7 tokens:</p>

<pre><code>1) These
2) are
3) the
4) separate
5) query
6) elements
7) These are compound composite term
</code></pre>

<p>The seventh token consists of several words because it was inside double quotation marks.</p>

<p>My question is: Is it possible to tokenize the input string accordingly to above explanations using <strong>one regular expression</strong>?</p>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>I was curious about possibility of using <code>Regex.exec</code> or similar code instead of <code>split</code> while achieving the same thing, so I've did some investigation that was followed by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30334649/a-regular-expression-to-tokenize-the-query"">another question here</a>. And so as a another answer to a question a following regex can be used:</p>

<pre><code>(?:"")(?:\w+\W*)+(?:"")|\w+
</code></pre>

<p>With the following one-liner usage scenario:</p>

<pre><code>var tokens = query.match(/(?:"")(?:\w+\W*)+(?:"")|\w+/g);
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it will be useful...</p>

This code is working well. However, just for testing purposes i wrote to a LogFile from the destructor of the OptionElem-Class so i could count how many OptionElem objects have been instantiated all together.
There are 9 Entrys in the Logfile. So 9 Objects have been instantiated and destroyed. I expected only 3 objects (e1, e2 and e3), because
i instantiated them once in the GameState constructor and then moved them to the optionElems-vector. I dont understand where the other 6 OptionElem objects have been instantiated.</p>

<pre><code>#include ""OptionElem.h""
#include &lt;vector&gt;

    {
    std::vector&lt;OptionElem&gt; optionElems;
    OptionElem*        currentElem;

GameState::GameState()

    OptionElem e3(""Exit"");

    optionElems[0].Connect(optionElems[1]);
    optionElems[1].Connect(optionElems[2]);

    currentElem = &amp;optionElems[0];

I changed the lines</p>

<pre><code>OptionElem e1(""Start Game""); 
optionElems.push_back(std::move(e1));

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>optionElems.emplace_back(""Start Game""); 
</code></pre>

<p>and did the same change to the similar code below as suggested by sftrabbit and the Logfile changed to 3 entries, so only 3 OptionElem objects gets instantiated when using the emplace_back method instead moving the local variables to the vector.

The problem is that I would likely be generating thousands of folders and hundreds of thousands of files (if I ever have to scale).
What are the problems with doing this? Does it get really slow? Is it about the same performance as using a Database?</p>

<p>What I mean:
Instead of having a database that stores a blog table, then has a row that contains ""author"", ""message"" and ""date"" I would instead have:
A folder for the specific post, then *.txt files inside that folder than has ""author"", ""message"" and ""date"" stored in them.</p>

I have some pictureBoxes as my buttons, and would like a label or another pictureBox (acting as a label) to be visible/not visible and be triggered by a MouseEnter and MouseLeave event.</p>

<p>When the MouseLeave event happens(triggering Visible=false), a white box appears in place of the pictureBox or label that was previously there for a split second until the background image fills back in.</p>

<p>I have read up a little bit on using the BackgroundWorker to ""pre-load"" my pictureBox or labels.  I am not sure that i am doing it right.  I am very new to programming; i dabble here and there, and do not have any formal training in c#.</p>

<p>I am not looking for anyone to write the code for me, but i also am not objected to that either.  A simple example of how to use it should suffice.</p>

<p>I have a background image (1920x1080) on my form. I think this image is actually having a harder time refreshing after the label or pictureBox's visibility is set to false.  </p>

When one option is selected, then text changes in textarea, everything is working perfectly while user don't try to write something in text area, when user types, then text doesn't change anymore.

select with option:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;select class=""es"" id=""es1""&gt;

    &lt;option id=""edu2""&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;

                });
</code></pre>

<p>and I have text area with id=""sk1"". The most interesting is that, when user types something extra into box, when I select other option, text doesn't change in it, but when I look at inspect element (in google chrome) I can see that text is changing, but after  tag. For example when user don't type everything is showing in html like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;textarea id=""sk1""&gt;text here&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After user types something extra:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;textarea id=""sk1""&gt;ecustom text and user text&lt;/textarea&gt; Another options text which is not shown to user&lt;/textarea&gt;

<p>Gmail says ""No conversations selected"" while performing some action, in this case I did a ""Mark as Read"".

Hello poi users and devs, </p>

<p>I have the following question, after the creation of my shapes and their connectors, the shapes are displayed and but the connector shapes (lines in my case) are not redered as i would like to. But for instance if I move a shape (not connector) its connection are displayed as expected. </p>

    XSSFClientAnchor connectAnchor = createAnchorRelativeToPosition(patriarch, currAnchor); 
    XSSFConnector connect =  patriarch.createConnector(connectAnchor); 
    CTConnector ctConnector = connect.getCTConnector(); 
    ctConnector.getSpPr().getPrstGeom().setPrst(STShapeType.BENT_CONNECTOR_3); 


    CTNonVisualConnectorProperties cx = ctConnector.getNvCxnSpPr().getCNvCxnSpPr(); 
    CTConnection startCnx = cx.addNewStCxn(); 

    startCnx.setId(shapeIdBefor); 
    startCnx.setIdx(2); 


    CTConnection endCnx = cx.addNewEndCxn(); 
    endCnx.setId( shape.getCTShape().getNvSpPr().getCNvPr().getId() ); 
    endCnx.setIdx(0); 
} 

private XSSFClientAnchor createAnchorRelativeToPosition(XSSFDrawing patriarch, XSSFClientAnchor currAnchor) { 
    short startCol, endCol; 
    int startRow, endRow; 
    startCol = anchorBefor.getCol1() &lt; currAnchor.getCol1() ? anchorBefor.getCol1() : currAnchor.getCol1(); 
    endCol = anchorBefor.getCol2() &lt; currAnchor.getCol2() ? anchorBefor.getCol1() : currAnchor.getCol2(); 
    startRow = anchorBefor.getRow1() &lt; currAnchor.getRow1() ? anchorBefor.getRow1() : currAnchor.getRow1(); 
    endRow =anchorBefor.getRow2() &lt; currAnchor.getRow2() ? anchorBefor.getRow2() : currAnchor.getRow2(); 

    return patriarch.createAnchor(0,0,0,0, 
        startCol,startRow, endCol, endRow); 
  } 
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is the following:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FYJGL.png"" alt=""How it renders:""></p>

<p>Then if i move a shape, the connector gets recalculated I suspect it thisplays like this, which is what I'd like to see from the start:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that main.qml is meant to load on Android using ""QtQuick2ApplicationViewer"" instead of ""QQmlEngine"". Should the ""QQmlEngine"" not be used at all for loading main.qml in attempt to get Q_RETURN_ARG running - when dealing with Android, and therefore that is why ""QQmlComponent component"" is not loading? If I try to use "" QtQuick2ApplicationViewer viewer"" replacing ""QQmlEngine engine"" for ""QQmlComponent component"", it says: ""no matchning function for call to QQmlComponent"".</p>

<p>Any suggestions how to get QQmlComponent initialized, so Q_RETURN_ARG starts working? Thanks!</p>

  <p>SocketException: Could not resolve host '(localdb)'</p>

<p>From what I see, the config.json file has the standard localdb connection string, which expects a local SQL Server database. Not sure if this will work on mac.</p>

<p>I tried to change this to connect to a postgresql db I have running locally but I don't know how to configure the app to use npgsql. I added npgsql to my project.json and ran the <code>dnu restore</code>. I then tried a connection string like this </p>

<p>I have the support libraries loading successfully, because code completion is possible for the ActionBar classes in java files.  The issue is that Android studio shows red text errors for assignments to the Theme.AppCompat.Light in the AndroidManifest.xml.</p>

<p>Is there a way to enable code completion for theme resources declared in the manifest from external libraries in Android Studio?</p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong> Here is my <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> block from my AndroidManifest:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity
    android:name=""com.example.activities.MainActivity""
    android:label=""@string/app_name""
    android:screenOrientation=""portrait""

<pre><code>&lt;application

    android:icon=""@drawable/main_final_ic""
    android:label=""@string/app_name""

<p>This is a odd to me, although I don't understand dll load rules comprehensively I thought it would search the CWD for the specified file. And the fact this same setup works on the various other computers I've tried is also odd.</p>

<p>Curiously, on a working computer if I remove clipper.dll and then run it:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Temp&gt;ConsoleApplication1.exe

Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or ass
embly 'clipper, Version=1.0.3975.26584, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or
 one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
   at ConsoleApplication1.Program.Main(String[] args)
</code></pre>

<p>The unhandled exception is slightly different, with a full assembly name.</p>

<ul>
<li>Both <code>ConsoleApplication1.exe</code> and <code>clipper.dll</code> are built for .NET 4.</li>
<li>All machines have the .NET 4 runtime installed. The problem machine does not have the .NET sdk </li>
<li>clipper.dll is a combination of ummanaged c++ code and C++/CLI. It is a suspicious character because it is basically the first C++/CLI .NET assembly I have created and much fumbling was involved. It seems to load in reflector fine.</li>
<li>These efforts came about when I was trying to figure out why I was unable to successfully utilise a COM object (call it <code>foo.dll</code>) which also referenced <code>clipper.dll</code> - all also on the same problem machine. After several hours of regasm hell I was able to further isolate it to this.</li>

<p>Ideally because I've already stated when creating the Array List that it will contain 'ModuleInfo' objects I could just Collection.sort(moduleDB, ModuleInfo.getDateDue) or something along those lines. moduleDB being the Array List</p>

<ol>
<li>Insert input data in a global temporary table. This data comes from the front end. The front end receives a string and creates a DML insert statement over the global temporary table that is then executed using <code>OracleCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()</code>. </li>

<p>I have a blog-style website, so on the homepage articles are loaded alongside the date published, the user that posted it, etc. Basic data like this.</p>

<p>I store it in MySQL like so:</p>

<pre><code>article_id     username      date                     content          etc.

2              user2         2015-05-16 02:33:15      my content b
</code></pre>

<p>This way, I can display it using one query, where I retrieve the username, date, content, etc.</p>

<p>My question is. I want to allow users the option to change their username. There are two options I see for this.</p>

<p>Either I continue storing data as I do now, and manually update tables like this with user-related data to the new username. Or I store data by a <code>user_id</code> rather than <code>username</code>, and have an extra query for each article loaded to get the associated username from another <code>user</code> table.</p>

<p>Which is the correct approach?</p>

<p>I ask this because I assume there's a recommended practice for this situation? Is it normal to store data by username and update it, or to store by id to avoid having to do this - but at the cost of the overhead when querying data. I'm guessing it's possible to display the username for id-based data in just one query, but that would still take significantly longer?</p>

  <p>*Adding a second core or CPU might increase the performance of your parallel program, but it is unlikely to double it. Likewise, a
  four-core machine is not going to execute your parallel program four
  times as quickly— in part because of the overhead and coordination
  described in the previous sections. However, the design of the
  computer hardware also limits its ability to scale. You can expect a
  significant improvement in performance, but it won’t be 100 percent

<p>Every Element in this list is Animated on Drawer open, I am animating the Listview Elements as follows: </p>

<pre><code>public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {

        //set the view as target
        sunSet.setTarget(imgIcon);
        //start the animation
        sunSet.start();

        wheelSet.setTarget(imgIcon);
        //start the animation
        wheelSet.start();


        ObjectAnimator textAnim2 = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(txtTitle, ""x"",convertView.getWidth()-(txtTitle.getWidth()/2), (convertView.getWidth()/2)-70);

        textAnim2.setDuration(1000);
        textAnim2.setRepeatCount(0);
        textAnim2.start();

        txtTitle.setTypeface(tf); 
        txtTitle.setTextSize(18);

        imgIcon.setImageResource(navDrawerItems.get(position).getIcon());    
        txtTitle.setText(navDrawerItems.get(position).getTitle());
        //convertView.startAnimation(getMaximAnim());

        if(navDrawerItems.get(position).getCounterVisibility()){
            txtCount.setText(navDrawerItems.get(position).getCount());
        }else{
            // hide the counter view
            txtCount.setVisibility(View.GONE);
        }

        return convertView;
    }

</code></pre>

<p>in onDrawerOpen</p>

<pre><code>runOnUiThread(run);
</code></pre>

<p>and my run is: </p>

<pre><code>final Runnable run = new Runnable(){
            public void run(){
                //reload content


                adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
                mDrawerList.invalidateViews();
                mDrawerList.refreshDrawableState();

            }
        };
</code></pre>

<p>I am doing the above so that I get the animation always, when I open the nav Drawer. I find my animation is working on most of the phones, however some phones between 4.0 and 4.4 are running this animation with jitters. What can be the possible cause and how to avoid/overcome the same? </p>

<p>This is the trace between nav drawer open and close calls: </p>

I had made a few minor modifications to TabHost to add a few extra methods (full source to follow) to work with some other parts of my App.</p>

<p>However, when I try to run the following I get a null pointer exception on Inflate and it doesn't really tell me anything about why. I downloaded the full Android source for my SDK and added it in eclipse to step through the inflation process and find if I could get any more info about the error that way.</p>

<p>I found exactly what line was causing the error (source included below) but when stepping through the debugger something strange happened. The logic is an if/else case where if == true it should return a New Parser() object, I ran that code and it successfully stepped through the constructor of Parser, yet after returning from that, the next instruction stepped right out of the statement group to the line below returning null.</p>

<p>The constructor appears to have run properly (it's located in XmlBlock.java in case you're wondering) yet it still steps to the next line and returns null and I have no idea why this is. I've searched for solutions but so far the only similar problem was encountered by someone using a TabActivity which is not suitable for my Application. I need Tabs and their views to be generated by objects I've defined within my project (similar to IOS style View Controllers) and not separate processes via using Intents to launch new Activities.</p>

<p>Can someone please have a look at my source and tell me what I'm doing wrong here because no one else can seem to tell me what the problem is? Here's another direct link to the source involved: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/9VRE2UGW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/9VRE2UGW</a></p>

This is a C# console application. Code works fine except when I try to Withdraw. If I enter amount of wrong type it detects(catches), informs me of invalid input and sends me back to menu prompt. That's fine and dandy until I get to the part where I try to withdraw more dosh than I have(balance). Supposedly, I should've gotten message saying that I'm short on funds to withdraw so much. Instead I get this:</p>
