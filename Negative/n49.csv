<p>I work on a Java application using Notes classes.</p>

<p>I wanted to use lotus.domino.Session object in order to create stream. I wanted to stream local computer files in order to embed them in a MIME field.</p>

<p>However, though created stream is finally closed, I can't delete source of attached file. It looks like Notes is not closing stream correctly.</p>

<p>Issue occurs even when I just open and close a stream, f.e.</p>

<pre><code>Stream stream = session.createStream();
stream.open(attachmentPath);
stream.close();
stream.recycle();

</code></pre>

<p>Document is locked till the end of main function.</p>

<p>I have no idea what could be causing it, but in result it leaves some temp files, which can't be deleted through code.</p>

<p>What could be cause of this issue?</p>

<p>There is a great way of compressing text using javascript in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/294421/637142"">JavaScript implementation of Gzip</a>.</p>

<p>The problem is I want to compress the response on my aspx server and decmpress it with javascript. Therefore I need to run the <code>lzw_encode</code> function on my asp.net server. Should I I translate that function to C# or there is another way? </p>

<p>Using the link above if you dont want to configure IIS or change header you can compress the code on the server with:</p>

<p><strong>C#</strong></p>

<pre><code>    public static string Compress(string s)
    {
        var dict = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();
        char[] data = s.ToArray();
        var output = new List&lt;char&gt;();
        char currChar;
        string phrase = data[0].ToString();
        int code = 256;

        for (var i = 1; i &lt; data.Length; i++){
            currChar = data[i];
            var temp = phrase + currChar;
            if (dict.ContainsKey(temp))                
                phrase += currChar;                
            else
            {
                if (phrase.Length &gt; 1)                    
                    output.Add((char)dict[phrase]);                    
                else                    
                    output.Add((char)phrase[0]);                    
                dict[phrase + currChar] = code;
                code++;
                phrase = currChar.ToString();
            }
        }

        if (phrase.Length &gt; 1)            
            output.Add((char)dict[phrase]);            
        else            
            output.Add((char)phrase[0]);

        return new string(output.ToArray());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and on the browser you can decompress it with:</p>

<p><strong>javascript</strong></p>

<pre><code>// Decompress an LZW-encoded string
function lzw_decode(s) {
    var dict = {};
    var data = (s + """").split("""");
    var currChar = data[0];
    var oldPhrase = currChar;
    var out = [currChar];
    var code = 256;
    var phrase;
    for (var i = 1; i &lt; data.length; i++) {
        var currCode = data[i].charCodeAt(0);
        if (currCode &lt; 256) {
            phrase = data[i];
        }
        else {
            phrase = dict[currCode] ? dict[currCode] : (oldPhrase + currChar);
        }
        out.push(phrase);
        currChar = phrase.charAt(0);
        dict[code] = oldPhrase + currChar;
        code++;
        oldPhrase = phrase;
    }
    return out.join("""");

<p>I'm looking to write some functions in Python that can extend my capabilities in AmiBroker. I've written the functions, and was able to establish the link on one of my machines, but I need it to work on multiple computers and I'm having difficulties.</p>

<p>AmiBroker claims that I should be able to test their OLE interface by creating a .gif file of a chart using javascript, they give a simple example on their website here: <a href=""https://www.amibroker.com/kb/2014/10/21/how-to-export-chart-image-to-a-file/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amibroker.com/kb/2014/10/21/how-to-export-chart-image-to-a-file/</a> . When I run this test, I had to modify the code slightly to write to a different path since C:\ wouldn’t work, but ultimately the test confirmed that COM/OLE should work on AmiBroker’s end; however, when trying to make a connection to a Python server instead of just the simple javascript application, AmiBroker tells me that the COM/Object doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>So, I tested to see if maybe my Python installation was wonky and that it couldn’t handle COM interactions in general. To do so I copied some of the code from  <a href=""http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?fromSeriesID=219&amp;name=2190050"" rel=""nofollow"">http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?fromSeriesID=219&amp;name=2190050</a> to do a quick check of Python’s ability to interact with Excel. Upon running this test, I found that Python had no problems interacting with Excel, as I got the expected “Hello World” and “1” dialogue boxes from Excel. </p>

<p>At that point, I can see no reason why the two won't cooperate with each other since it's clear that they both can cooperate with COM In general. Any guidance would be very helpful. Here is the code I'm using to establish the Python COM server:</p>

<pre><code>import pythoncom
import win32com.server.register
import numpy as np
import win32com.server.util
import win32com.client.dynamic
from win32com.server.exception import COMException

class PythonCOM:
_public_methods_ = ['test',]
_reg_progid_ = ""Test.COM""
_reg_clsid_ = ""{57103D9A-2A34-42D6-AB1D-6903F593F5E0}""

def test(self,array):
    array = np.asarray(array)
    return array + 1

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    print ""Registering COM server...""
    win32com.server.register.UseCommandLine(PythonCOM)

    #Uncomment below section to unregister a server

    #win32com.server.register.UnregisterServer(PythonCOM._reg_clsid_)
    #print ""COM server unregistered""

I'm not really advanced C/C++ programmer, however I'm not a beginner too. I started to learn CUDA C excited by the power of nowadays GPU's in compare to the power of CPU's and what I realized is that CUDA programming is mostly about parallel thread execution and that sometimes proper thread synchronization is necessary. In fact I don't even know how to apply thread synchronization in C or C++ yet. The last time I was using synchronization was about 2 years ago whan I was writing simple apps in Java like this:</p>

<pre><code>synchronized returnType functionName(parameters)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>what allow 'functionName' to be executed by only one thread at a tmie - that is this function is executed alternately by diffrent threads. Now coming back to CUDA C, if I have e.g. 200 threads in a block which run the code inside while loop:</p>

<pre><code>while(some_condition)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I make threads &lt;0 - 99> synchronized with each other and threads &lt;100 - 199> synchronized with each other too, but apply synchronization the way that threads &lt;0 - 99> and &lt;100 - 199> execute alternately(That is first 100 threads run contents of 'while' and after that next 100 threads run contents of 'while' and so on) ?</p>

I am looking for the simplest way of doing this in Tapestry 5.</p>

<p>Firstly, lets define some utility classes e.g.</p>

<pre><code>public class ModelObject {
  private URI uri;
  private boolean modified;
  // the usual constructors, getters and setters ...
}

public class Literal&lt;T&gt; extends ModelObject {
  private Class&lt;?&gt; valueClass;
  private T value;
  public Literal(Class&lt;?&gt; valueClass) {
    this.valueClass = valueClass;
  }
  public Literal(Class&lt;?&gt; valueClass, T value) {
    this.valueClass = valueClass;
    this.value = value;
  }
  // the usual getters and setters ...
}

public class Link&lt;T extends ModelObject&gt; extends ModelObject {
  private Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass;
  private T target;
  public Link(Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass) {
    this.targetClass = targetClass;
  }
  public Link(Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass, T target) {
    this.targetClass = targetClass;
    this.target = target;
  }
  // the usual getters and setters ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can create some fairly complex data structures, for example:</p>

<pre><code>public class HumanBeing extends ModelObject {
  private Literal&lt;String&gt; name;
  // ... other stuff
  public HumanBeing() {
    name = new Literal&lt;String&gt;(String.class);
  }
  // the usual getters and setters ...
}

public class Project extends ModelObject {
  private Literal&lt;String&gt; projectName;
  private Literal&lt;Date&gt; startDate;
  private Literal&lt;Date&gt; endDate;
  private Literal&lt;Integer&gt; someCounter;
  private Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt; projectLeader;
  private Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt; projectManager;
  // ... other stuff, including lists of things, that may be Literals or
  // Links ... e.g. (ModelObjectList is an enhanced ArrayList that remembers
  // the type(s) of the objects it contains - to get around type erasure ...
  private ModelObjectList&lt;Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt;&gt; projectMembers;
  private ModelObjectList&lt;Link&lt;Project&gt;&gt; relatedProjects;
  private ModelObjectList&lt;Literal&lt;String&gt;&gt; projectAliases;
  // the usual constructors, getters and setters for all of the above ...
  public Project() {
    projectName = new Literal&lt;String&gt;(String.class);
    startDate = new Literal&lt;Date&gt;(Date.class);
    endDate = new Literal&lt;Date&gt;(Date.class);
    someCounter = new Literal&lt;Integer&gt;(Integer.class);
    projectLeader = new Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt;(HumanBeing.class);
    projectManager = new Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt;(HumanBeing.class);
    projectMembers = new ModelObjectList&lt;Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt;&gt;(Link.class, HumanBeing.class);
    // ... more ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you point <code>beaneditform</code> at an instance of Project.class, you will not get very far before you have to supply a lot of custom coercers, translators, valueencoders, etc - and then you still run into the problem that you can't use generics when ""contributing"" said coercers, translators, valueencoders, etc.</p>

<p>I then started writing my own components to get around these problems (e.g. <code>ModelObjectDisplay</code> and <code>ModelObjectEdit</code>) but this would require me to understand a lot more of the guts of Tapestry than I have time to learn ... it feels like I might be able to do what I want using the standard components and liberal use of ""delegate"" etc. Can anyone see a simple path for me to take with this?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far.</p>

<p>PS: if you are wondering why I have done things like this, it is because the model represents linked data from an RDF graph database (aka triple-store) - I need to remember the URI of every bit of data and how it relates (links) to other bits of data (you are welcome to suggest better ways of doing this too :-)</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>@uklance suggested using display and edit blocks - here is what I had already tried:</p>

<p>Firstly, I had the following in AppPropertyDisplayBlocks.tml ...</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;t:block id=""literal""&gt;
        &lt;t:delegate to=""literalType"" t:value=""literalValue"" /&gt;
    &lt;/t:block&gt;

    &lt;t:block id=""link""&gt;
        &lt;t:delegate to=""linkType"" t:value=""linkValue"" /&gt;
    &lt;/t:block&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and in AppPropertyDisplayBlocks.java ...</p>

<pre><code>    public Block getLiteralType() {
        Literal&lt;?&gt; literal = (Literal&lt;?&gt;) context.getPropertyValue();

        Class&lt;?&gt; valueClass = literal.getValueClass();
        if (!AppModule.modelTypes.containsKey(valueClass))
            return null;

        String blockId = AppModule.modelTypes.get(valueClass);
        return resources.getBlock(blockId);
    }

    public Object getLiteralValue() {
        Literal&lt;?&gt; literal = (Literal&lt;?&gt;) context.getPropertyValue();
        return literal.getValue();
    }

    public Block getLinkType() {
        Link&lt;?&gt; link = (Link&lt;?&gt;) context.getPropertyValue();

        Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass = link.getTargetClass();
        if (!AppModule.modelTypes.containsKey(targetClass))
            return null;

        String blockId = AppModule.modelTypes.get(targetClass);
        return resources.getBlock(blockId);
    }

    public Object getLinkValue() {
        Link&lt;?&gt; link = (Link&lt;?&gt;) context.getPropertyValue();
        return link.getTarget();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>AppModule.modelTypes is a map from java class to a String to be used by Tapestry e.g. Link.class -> ""link"" and Literal.class -> ""literal"" ... in AppModule I had the following code ...</p>

<pre><code>    public static void contributeDefaultDataTypeAnalyzer(
            MappedConfiguration&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;, String&gt; configuration) {
        for (Class&lt;?&gt; type : modelTypes.keySet()) {
            String name = modelTypes.get(type);
            configuration.add(type, name);
        }
    }

    public static void contributeBeanBlockSource(
            Configuration&lt;BeanBlockContribution&gt; configuration) {

        // using HashSet removes duplicates ...
        for (String name : new HashSet&lt;String&gt;(modelTypes.values())) {
            configuration.add(new DisplayBlockContribution(name,
                    ""blocks/AppPropertyDisplayBlocks"", name));
            configuration.add(new EditBlockContribution(name,
                    ""blocks/AppPropertyEditBlocks"", name));
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I had similar code for the edit blocks ... however none of this seemed to work - I think because the original object was passed to the ""delegate"" rather than the de-referenced object which was either the value stored in the literal or the object the link pointed to (hmm... should be [Ll]inkTarget in the above, not [Ll]inkValue). I also kept running into errors where Tapestry couldn't find a suitable ""translator"", ""valueencoder"" or ""coercer"" ... I am under some time pressure so it is difficult to follow these twisty passages through in order to get out of the maze :-)</p>

<p>This works! I'll get a nice table with [Number] and [Foldername] ! Now comes the tricky part! In addition, I want the date of an index.html located in each folder. Therefore I have another bash script:</p>

<pre><code>ls -ltr /test/folder1/*.html | tail -1 | awk '{printf""%3s %1s %s\n"",$6, $7, $8}`
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me the perfect output: <strong>Feb 22 10:56</strong> Now I need this information in my table. I have added this line in my perl script within the while loop:</p>

<pre><code>$timestamp = `ls -ltr /test/folder1/*.html | tail -1 | awk '{printf""%3s %1s %s\\n"",\$6, \$7, \$8}`;
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfect when I add the foldername as a string. As soon as I exchange <strong>folder1</strong> with <strong>$foldername</strong> I'll get nonsense ""ls"" information.</p>

<p>Why is that so?</p>

<p>Edit: Now I have used:</p>

<pre><code>use File::stat;
use Time::localtime;
my $timestamp = ctime(stat(""/test/folder1"")-&gt;mtime);
</code></pre>

<p>This is way more secure compared to parsing the ls output. But still I have issues with the $foldername. I have used the <strong>length</strong> function to determine the length of <em>$Foldername</em>.</p>

<p>$foldername has a length of 7, but the string output has only 6 chars: tomato</p>

<p>So I've tried Chop/chomp the $foldername with always the same result: 7 chars!</p>

<p>In a collection I'm saving events. Among other fields, these events have a start and an end, saved as <code>Dates</code> in Mongodb.</p>

<pre><code>events { 
  start: ""Date1"",
  end: ""Date2"",

<p>When inserting new documents in this collection I need a constrain that forbids insertion of document which start-end dates overlapping an event alreay created. In short, I dont want any events share the same time span.</p>

<p>To make a long story short this is as good as impossible to do in MongoDB, and instead I'm finding myself compromise the design of my data structure around the limitations of the DB. The compromise is to split the time range in discrete 15 minutes steps and put these into an array which is given a unique index. </p>

<p>I have started to develop an Android application and I found that the Android plugin for eclipse are terribly good.

<ul>
<li>SourceA => TargetA</li>
<li>SourceA => TargetB</li>
<li>SourceB => TargetA</li>
<li>SourceB => TargetB</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, conversion is a little bit more advanced than a simple cast. It requires a very own strategy for each of the cases above.</p>

<p>What I would like to <em>avoid</em> is having several methods which contain the types in the method <strong>name</strong>, so I do <strong>not</strong> want something such as:</p>

<p><code>ConvertAtoA</code></p>

<p>or similar things. The reason why I do not want this is because the types are then used as strings, not as types themselves, so whenever I go to rename a type there is no refactoring support. Supposed I rename <code>SourceA</code> to <code>SourceXyz</code>, the method will not get renamed automatically, but I will have to do this manually.</p>

<p>What I would like to have is a generic way of expressing this, mainly to get refactoring support. So basically something such as:</p>

<p><code>Convert&lt;SourceA, TargetA&gt;(mySourceValue)</code></p>

<p>The problem here is that I end up with a generic <code>Convert&lt;TSource, TTarget&gt;</code>method which contains <strong>ALL</strong> the logic for <strong>ALL</strong> types (which is a bad idea for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>I have already taken a look at various design patterns, including visitor, strategy and chain of responsibility, but none of them caught attraction. Anyway, I am not sure whether I missed a point there.</p>

<p>How could I solve this issue?</p>

<p>Basically, the two main targets are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having separate conversion logic for each combination (no complex methods)</li>
<li>Having refactoring support (no types as strings)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I have considered using AutoMapper, but I am not sure whether it works the way I want. What I can do for sure is set up a custom converter, such as</p>

<pre><code>Mapper.CreateMap&lt;string, DateTime&gt;().ConvertUsing(new DateTimeTypeConverter());
</code></pre>

<p>but then again I have the type <code>DateTime</code> as part of the converter name. I know that I can also use a lambda expression here, but this again makes the code ugly, because it will become very long. Anyway, I fear that I can't have everything ...</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> You could ease the problem by putting on the constraint that there is always a <code>Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</code> (although with different contents) on the left and a custom class on the right. So what I would like to end up with is an extension method such as</p>

<pre><code>dictionary.To&lt;TargetA&gt;()
</code></pre>

<p>but without the need to put all the logic for converting to different types into the <code>To&lt;T&gt;</code> method.</p>

<p>The first one is also mapped to receive messages and send one back. The first funciton works and the message makes it back to the browser and displays on the webpage.

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt; T* spawnEnemy(SpawnDirection dir);

<p>My intention is to create a generic spawning function that accepts <strong>type</strong> of enemy as a template parameter and return the spawned object from the function.</p>

<pre><code>popFreeObjectAndAddToActiveListForType(int type)

<p>So how can I do type checking in situation like this within template function?</p>

After got a suggestion from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15191315/how-to-check-type-directly-from-type-that-passed-through-template-function-not-f#comment21403834_15191315"">stephen lin</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15191315/how-to-check-type-directly-from-type-that-passed-through-template-function-not-f/15191385#comment21403895_15191315"">nvoigt</a>, then I see that this design has a flaw but it's because I top it up from what I already. The easier is to let function have another <strong>type</strong> parameter and not involve with template but do need to cast to specific type later. Anyway, it's good to know a solution for this situation.</p>

    sock.onclose = function() {

    };
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>The connection works fine, but I'm unable to see the data stream.</p>

<p>How can I properly configure my application in order to produce and then route on my client's console the messages sent by the WebSocket Server?</p>

"22792178","1","23863654","","2014-04-01 16:56:33","","0","146","<p>I am adding exception handling to my PHP code.  It seems that I end up with lots of sparse blocks that do exception handling and by their sheer bulkiness hide the actual production code that is being run.  For example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>function loadProduct($id)
{
    $product = new ProductRecord();

    try 
    {
        $data = $product-&gt;loadFromDatabase($id);
    }
    catch (\BadFunctionCallException $e)
    {
        $error = true;
    }        

    return $data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>the actual payload of the above function is to return the $data.  Without the exception handling it could be a 2-line function:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>function loadProduct($id)
{
    $product = new ProductRecord();
    return $product-&gt;loadFromDatabase($id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>One way to hid this is to use <code>Factory Method</code>, such as:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>function loadProduct($id)
{
    $product = new ProductRecord();
    $factory = new ProductFactory($product);
    return $factory-&gt;loadProduct($id);  //inside loadProduct I can put try/catch block
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I am adding a whole new (factory) class and another line of code in my function to hide my exception handling.  With proper care I think this will work and still look good (i.e. I can initialize my factory inside the constructor, thus moving it out of the function-level code, so it can be a good option).  But is that the best?</p>

<p>In other words, my question is -- how can I use Exception Handling in my code without burying my actual payload into the sparseness of try/catch blocks?</p>

<p>The starting document is from a mail-merge, and I am trying to produce a set of numbered and named tickets as PDFs to send to people for an event (this is for a charity). The mail-merge seems to work fine and I can save the merged document and it looks OK with e.g. a list of fifty people giving me a 50-page document.</p>

<p>Ideally the result would be a set of PDFs.</p>

<p>I have tried to create some simple VBA code to do this, but it is not working consistently. If I try this very simple macro below , I get the correct number of documents, but only perhaps 1 or 2 documents with the correct contents out of every five. Most of the documents are completely empty.</p>

<pre><code>Sub splitter()
Dim i As Integer
Dim Source As Document
Dim Target As Document

Set Source = ActiveDocument

For i = 1 To Source.Pages.Count
    Set Target = Documents.Add
    Source.Pages(i).Shapes.Range.Copy
    Target.Pages(1).Shapes.Paste
    Target.SaveAs Filename:=""C:\Temp\Ticket_"" &amp; i
    Target.Close
    Set Target = Nothing
    Next i

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I did sometimes get an error that the clipboard is busy, but not always.</p>

<p>Another approach might be to start with the master document and do this looping over the separate documents and fill in the personal details for each person's ticket and directly produce the PDFs. But that seems more complex, and I am not a VB programmer (but been doing C++ etc for 20+ years, so I can program :-) )</p>

<p>A final annoyance is that it seems to keep opening a new Publisher window for each document. It takes a while to then close 50+ copies of publisher, and the laptop starts to crawl...</p>

<p>Please advise how best to get round these issues. I am probably missing something trivial, being a relative VB(A) newbie.</p>

The idea is to walk around with an android device and calculate your location in a room based on the signal strengths of bluetooth dongles placed around the room. 
In order to do this I have decided to use machine learning to approximate, as closely as possible, the RSSI as a distance, meters for example. 
I have been told by a lecturer in my college that LibSVM is what I'm looking for so I've been doing some reading. 
I had a look at this <a href=""http://lekshmideepu.blogspot.ie/2012/02/libsvm-tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorial</a> and can't seem to get my head around the data that's needed to train the system.
The data that I will have is:</p>

<ul>
<li>the locations of each dongle (along with a mac address) saved in a database, x and y coordinates</li>
<li>the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the dongles nearest to my android device</li>
<li>the mac addresses will be used to query the database for certain dongles</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand the data has to be in SVM format but I'm a bit unsure of what it should be in terms of input data and output data. The example below, taken from the tutorial I've mentioned, shows that a man is a class and a woman is a class. So in my case would I have just one class ""dongle""? And should all the values dongle reflect the values I have stored in my database?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>man voice:low figure:big income:good </p>
  
  <p>woman voice:high figure:slim
  income:fare</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Convert the feature values to its numeric representation.    Let's say, that best salary would be 5 and worst salary 1 (or no salary =
  0), the same with other enumarated variables.</li>
  <li>We have 2 classes, man and women . convert the classes to numeric values: man = 1, woman = -1</li>
  <li>Save it in libsvm data format:</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>[class/target] 1:[firstFeatureValue] 2:[secondFeatureValue] etc. ex.:
  a women with great salary, low voice and small figure would be encoded
  like:
  -1 1:5 2:1.5 3:1.8</p>
  
  <p>In general the input file format of SVM is</p>
  
  <p>[label] [index1]:[value1] [index2]:[value2] ... [label]
  [index1]:[value1] [index2]:[value2] ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could someone give me an example of what I should be aiming for?</p>

<p>This is all brand new to me so any helpful hints or tips to get me going would be great.
Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Any help?</p>

<hr>

<p>Solution: Thanks to  theomega i have solved the isse. Here is the code just for community sharing:</p>

<pre><code>$args = array('role' =&gt; 'author');

    $authors = get_users($args);
    shuffle($authors);
    $i = 0;
     foreach ($authors as $author): 
           if($i == 4) break;
           //do stuff
           $i++;
         endforeach;
</code></pre>

<p>Did not set the limit on the $args because i need the shuffle in all users. Hope it will help someone out there, in the wild. :D Thanks!</p>

<p>I am using <code>CCTurnOffTiles</code> action on a <code>CCSprite</code> (.png image, not animated).</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes</strong>, everything goes smoothly. Other times, the sprite <strong>seems to be tinted</strong>. The tint color seems to be mostly <strong>green</strong>.</p>

<p>My AppDelegate has the settings I was suggested here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8988260/ccliquid-renders-my-screen-black"">CCLiquid renders my screen black</a></p>

<p>This is the action code:</p>

<pre><code>id myAction = [[CCTurnOffTiles actionWithSize:ccg(35, 20) duration:0.7] reverse];
</code></pre>

<p>I use <code>reverse</code> because I want my tiles to turn ON rather than OFF. But I believe that the problem persists either way.</p>

<p>Why might this be happening?</p>

<p>Is it failing because I have a user_id presenece:true parmam in my rails app model - but no users in my xcode app?
Or is it a discrepancy between a class declaration in xcode and rails?</p>

Here is the server log from a successful post</p>

After the install was finished, I edited fstab file of eOS so that it would automatically mount a ntfs partition at the address /mnt/Windows.
Later after that I turned off the laptop and when I powered it on later, after choosing elementary OS in grub's options, I get the error ""There was an error while mounting filesystem '0'"", or something like that.
I proceeded to elementary OS by skipping the error and it appears that ntfs partition was mounted at the address /mnt/Windows and it's fully available to usage from my account in linux.
I opened a terminal and did this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -a

<p>The result was:</p>

<p>I got this error after editing fstab file, so the way I mount that partition is the cause. Tried these two ways:</p>

<p>Tried with ntfs instead of ntfs-3g and it's still the same.

<p>I am new to web dev so I am just learning about things like JavaScript is extremely difficult to protect.</p>

<p>I've read this thread <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18417169/how-to-protect-jsp-pages-from-being-open-source"">how to protect jsp pages from being open source</a> and duplicates that have been made, but these are older questions. </p>

<p>I was curious what approaches are good ones to take if we have to use JavaScript/jQuery? As mentioned above what kinds of logic should be on the server, what should be in the client?  Does node.js do anything to stop the code from being shown or does it only serve js to the client (or do something else entirely)?</p>

<p>I have read up and found a few applications that seem good, but as many have said it's ""impossible to 100% protect Javascript code.""</p>

<p>Are any of these good?  Is jscrambler worth the money?</p>

<p>I am also curious what other code (besides HTML and CSS) is available for people to view on the client?</p>

<p>I also want to explain a little bit about the application I am trying to develop. I am in the process of developing an application that draws shapes on the screen using SVG.  From there I have menu options to change the objects, i.e., instead of a color, switch the element with its image that's provided.  I wanted this to be fully AJAX and change instantly when the menu is clicked.  I am using jQuery for everything, and reading in my data via JSON which is on my server.</p>

<p>Originally I was working with JSP/Servlets, but I still needed to create the data via SVG and do things with jQuery and AJAX, so I believe this would still have visible code.</p>

<p>I do secure my application using Apache Shiro for authentication and authorization, but I also will be setting up a guest account for people to try out the product, so that limits how much security I do have on the source code if anyone can view the trial account.</p>

<p>Most of my code is not in jQuery/JavaScript just the drawing of my elements.  Eventually this will grow, so I am concerned overall. So I am curious, what are some best practices that one should take in order to make sure their application code is as protected as possible?</p>

<p>What are some best practices in regards to what code should go where (or is that based on preference?  I would assume there would be some useful tips though).</p>

<pre><code>  @javascript
  Scenario: Successful sign out
    Given there is the following user:
    | id       | 1                    |
    | email    | a@b.com              |

    And I am signed in as ""a@b.com""/""please""
    When I follow ""Sign out""
    Then I should see ""You are signed out""
</code></pre>

<p>Clicking on the ""Sign out"" link requires javascript emulation, so I tagged the scenario with the @javascript tag, which causes it to run in firefox using selenium. It seems to run fine and everything works, except soon after the sign in succeeds, the browser screen suddenly changes and says ""Internal Server Error"" before capybara has a chance to record the result.</p>

<p>I have seen other errors saying that this can be fixed by switching the transaction strategy to truncation instead of transactions, but this seems to be happening already, since Cucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy is set to :truncation.</p>

Once Group A and B is set, it will not be changed. 500 of pairs should be selected from fixed A and B. In the each pair, a &lt; b. </p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>{

<p>The page structure will actually be highly dynamic, so many updates will occur simultaneously with many reads. However, every change (like moving a subpage into another page) requires at least 2 update operations:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// move 123 into page 234
db.pages.update({""_id"":012}, {$pull:{""subpages"":123}});
db.pages.update({""_id"":234}, {$push:{""subpages"":123}});

// delete page 345
db.pages.update({""_id"":012}, {$pull:{""subpages"":345}});
db.pages.remove({""_id"":345});
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to perform (or design the model to enable performing) operations like moving a page or deleting a page atomically (to prevent the state of the hierarchy going bad)?</p>

<p><b>Notes</b></p>

<p>One possibility I'm looking at right now is manually locking the documents by adding a ""lockedBy"" field to every page, which will contain a transaction ID. But I don't like the idea of continuously polling if I want a second locking operation to block until the first locking operation completes (see <a href=""https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-2244"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-2244</a>). Also, since locking is managed by the application, if the application (or one instance of it) goes down for whatever reason during a locking operation, the documents need to be unlocked somehow, without affecting other transactions.</p>

<p>I've also looked at <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Trees+in+MongoDB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Trees+in+MongoDB</a> and it seems that none of the examples (except for the single document one) solves this problem. However, I would like to avoid putting the entire hierarchy into a single document, because of the 16MB document size constraint and the difficulty of moving pages around (basically I need to upsert the entire document for every change).</p>

<p><b>Updates</b></p>

<p>We hope to support up to 10000 subpages for a page. The IDs for pages are at least 6 characters long. With that in mind, we moved from mySQL because we need to keep track of the order of the sub-pages. Since mySQL doesn't have array structures, the only way to do that is to use a position column. When pages are moved around frequently, it is expensive to calculate average positions and re-index when the position value becomes too long. Also, if we wanted to put a comma separated list of ids into a column, we would have to use a TEXT column (read from disk) rather than a VARCHAR (which has a limit of 65536 chars) in order to support 10000 sub-pages.</p>

<p>And it lags every time when I open this fragment. Also I noticed that fragment with map view also have some lags. I read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20164633/navigation-drawer-is-slow-with-complex-view"">this post</a> and looks like I should do all my work after navigation drawer is closed (if I call mDrawer.closeDrawers() before fragment transaction isn't it the same??), but what the reason for lags if I open drawer when fragment with complex view is already initialized? It is very strange for me.</p>

<p>Also debugger said that uithread takes 2 much work and skip frames.So should I optimize my ""complex"" fragments or optimize navigation drawer appears? And how? Thx</p>

<p>This is the original program I wrote, based on Euclidean Algorithm for GCD. It functions correctly. I now want to remove the two commented lines above and replace it with a call to a further module I made, which calculates the remainder:</p>

#Gives the remainder of the division of x by y. Outputs as r.
   while x &gt;= y:
       x -= y
   r = x

<p>This program also functions correctly. 
I want to use the value of the name 'r' in my edited program. I have attempted to do this below, but it causes problems:</p>

<pre><code>def GCD(x,y):
import remainder
#gives the Greatest Common Divisor of two values.
while y != 0:
    remainder.xy(x,y)

                            #module into this module. This line is incorrect. 
    x = y
    y = r #Python cannot find 'r'. I want to use the value for 'r' from the execution
          #of the remainder calculating module. Attempts to find how have been
          #unsuccessful.
print x

<p>I need to find out how to use the calculated value of 'r' from my xy module in my second GCD module. I have tried using </p>

<pre><code>global r
</code></pre>

<p>in my module though I have had no success. I'm not sure if I am interpreting the function of 'global' correctly.</p>

<pre><code>SolrDocument resultDoc = iter.next();
String content = (String) resultDoc.getFieldValue(""source"");

<hr>

<p>Environment: a real distributed Hadoop cluster (no local instance) / Cloudera configured with <code>utf-8</code> and <code>Apache Pig version 0.12.0</code></p>

<p>My source file is encoded with <code>iso-8859-1</code> and the goal is to store it's content as <code>utf-8</code> (after or before several other operations within pig).</p>

<p>After running/submitting the script I got following output:</p>

I need to scrape a table of price information from an ASP.NET webpage (<a href=""http://www.spp.org/LIP.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spp.org/LIP.asp</a>) based on dates and hours that I specify. I am comfortable with and want to use R. My basic stumbling block is that the URL doesn't reflect search parameters, it's static, and I also don't know how to submit an HTML form with Javascript in it on an ASP.NET site.</p>

<p>I viewed the source code for the URL above. I found that within an iframe is a link to another page for 'source data': <a href=""http://www.spp.org/LIPPosting/LIP.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spp.org/LIPPosting/LIP.aspx</a>. I tried doing a POST request in R based on this StackOverflow thread: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16601520/what-if-i-want-to-web-scrape-with-r-for-a-page-with-parameters"">What if I want to web scrape with R for a page with parameters?</a>.</p>

<pre><code>##ASP.NET site scrape
forms = getHTMLFormDescription(""http://www.spp.org/LIPPosting/LIP.aspx"")
# Name the list for easy reference
names(forms)='spp'
# Use the createFunction tool so I can submit a search
fun = createFunction(forms$spp, verbose=T)
# Submit an HTML form looking for data using all form defaults
# Except change the hour to '03'
results &lt;- fun(ddlHour = '03')
# Grab the table results from the HTML based on its id tag  
tableData &lt;- getNodeSet(htmlParse(results), ""//*/table[@id = 'dgLIP']"")
readHTMLTable(tableData[[1]])
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML results show that in the 'hour' form element I did select '03'. </p>

<pre><code>           &lt;td style=""height: 42px; width: 77px;""&gt;
&lt;span id=""lblLIPHour""&gt;Hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;select name=""ddlHour"" id=""ddlHour""&gt;&lt;option value=""1""&gt;01&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""2""&gt;02&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option selected value=""3""&gt;03&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""4""&gt;04&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""5""&gt;05&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""6""&gt;06&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""7""&gt;07&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""8""&gt;08&lt;/option&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this request does not get passed to the server, because when I look at the actual table results it is for the current time, not '03'. </p>

<p>In addition, I can only get the HTML for the page that gets returned from the server, which does not contain all of the results. In reality, there are JavaScript arrow buttons on the bottom of that page that allow me to tab between all the results when I am in the webpage.</p>

<p>In the webpage itself, to see results after choosing from a dropdown menu, I have to hit the 'view' button. Is there a way to replicate this in R to get my '03' parameters sent as a query to the server to return new HTML to the webpage?</p>

<p>If I can do that, I can write something to ""push"" the page arrows as well. </p>

My current setup is that I'm using a -Xms1g and -Xmx3g. my application is using java 1.4.2. I don't have any garbage collection flags set. by the looks of it, 3gb is not enough and I really have a lot of objects to garbage collect.</p>

<p>question:</p>

<p>should I change my garbage collection algorithm?
what should i use? is it better to use <code>-XX:+UseParallelGC or -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC</code></p>

<p>or should i use this combination</p>

<pre><code>-XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
</code></pre>

<p>the ones occupying the memory are largely reports data and not cache data. also, the machine has 16gb memory and I plan to increase the heap to 8gb. </p>

<p>What are the difference between the two options as I still find it hard to understand.
the machine has multiple processors. I can take hits of up to 5 seconds but 30 to 70 seconds is really hard.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

I have created a new customer attribute via my module's sql/setup file (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5961290/adding-attributes-to-customer-entity/5962237#5962237"">ref</a>), and now I want to populate that attribute for each of the existing customers. I've created a Backend model for the attribute that detects null values during the entity load (afterLoad) and generates the content, but I am hesitant to save the entity at that point in the process.</p>

<pre><code>class Aligent_Referral_Model_Customer_Attribute_Backend_Referralcode extends Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Attribute_Backend_Abstract
{
public function afterLoad($oCustomer)
{
    $vAttrCode = $this-&gt;getAttribute()-&gt;getAttributeCode();
    $vValue = $oCustomer-&gt;getData($vAttrCode);
    if (empty($vValue)){
        $oCustomer-&gt;setData($vAttrCode, Mage::helper('referral')-&gt;generateRafCode($oCustomer));
    }
    return $this;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to call something like <code>$this-&gt;getAttribute()-&gt;setValue('blah')-&gt;save()</code> in that <code>afterLoad</code> method so that it doesn't rely on the user clicking save. </p>

<p>I could write a script that loads a collection of all customers and walks them to set the value, but there's over 50,000 customers and I'm concerned about the performance impact of running that on a production server...</p>

A while ago I have read a research paper regarding multithreading v.s. event-base programming paradigm. The thesis is to challenge the current belief that multithreading has a natural limit on the number of threads a system is able to support. It asserts such limit is an implementation issue. By examining and removing the constraints from the implementation, it is able to scale the number of threads to a much higher number. Finally it assert that the multithreading paradigm and the event based programming paradigm is equivalent (with respect to something). I think the paper is published within last few years.</p>

<p>I've lost the link to that document and I wonder if someone can help me to recover it. The description from my reconstructed memory may contain errors of course.</p>

I have a generic DataGrid (with AutoGenerateColumns set) that is bound to a DataTable with column names that vary on every load. When the dataTable contains columns that are of type boolean, I want to render a column that contains custom images representing true and false.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, I have a StaticResource declared on the page for the celltemplate, and I have c# code that traps the AutoGenerateColumn event and uses this template:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;DataTemplate x:Key=""CheckmarkColumnTemplate""&gt;
        &lt;Image x:Name=""CheckmarkImage"" Source=""..\..\images\check.png"" Height=""16"" Width=""16"" /&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate.Triggers&gt;
            &lt;DataTrigger Binding=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}, Path=Value}"" Value=""False""&gt;
                &lt;Setter TargetName=""CheckmarkImage"" Property=""Source"" Value=""..\..\images\nocheck.png"" /&gt;
            &lt;/DataTrigger&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate.Triggers&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>C# code:</p>

<pre><code>    private void dgData_AutoGeneratingColumn(object sender, DataGridAutoGeneratingColumnEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.PropertyType == typeof(bool))
        {
            DataGridTemplateColumn col = new DataGridTemplateColumn();
            Binding binding = new Binding(e.PropertyName);
            col.CellTemplate = (this.Resources[""CheckmarkColumnTemplate""] as DataTemplate);
            col.Header = e.PropertyName;
            e.Column = col;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This mostly works, except I've got the DataTrigger Binding property messed up. It never detects when the value of the column is ""false"", so it never shows the nocheck.png image. I don't know how to write the Binding property so that's referencing the databound value of the column (remember, the column name is different every time, so I can't hard-code a column name in the Path part of the binding).</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what the Binding property should look like so that it just grabs the value of the column?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>However during testing I discovered that Application <code>onCreate()</code> is called twice. (Second time likely from a service that I don't know well) Although <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation says</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>public void onCreate ()</strong> Added in API level 1</p>
  
  <p>Called when the application is starting, before any activity, service,
  or receiver objects (excluding content providers) have been created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it be because Application is created for both Activity and Service and the same time? </p>

<p>What I may be missing?</p>

<p>I have tried chunks and the array functions in numpy but they are useless for this. </p>

<p>Here is my code in Perl that works well, but I want it to compare to Python (in efficiency).</p>

<pre><code>sub make_array {

<p>As an example, I have the following 12 x 12 matrix:</p>

<pre><code>000011110011
000011110011
000011110011
000011110011
000011110011
000011110011
000011110011
000011110011
</code></pre>

<p>and I want it decomposed into 6 square submatrices of length 4:</p>

<pre><code>0000 1111 0011
0000 1111 0011
0000 1111 0011
0000 1111 0011

0000 1111 0011
0000 1111 0011
0000 1111 0011
0000 1111 0011
</code></pre>

<p>The original matrix comes from a file (the program should read it from a text file) in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011
</code></pre>

<p>So the program needs to split it by hyphens and take each chunk as a row of the large matrix. The 6 submatrices should come in the same input format, hence the first one would be:</p>

<pre><code>0000,0000,0000,0000
</code></pre>

<p>The program should decompose any input matrix into square matrices of length j, say 4, if the original matrix is of size not multiple of 4 then it should disregard the remaining chunks that couldn't form a 4x4 matrix.</p>

<p>Several large matrices of different size could come in the original input file, with break lines as separators. For example, the original large matrix together with anothe rmatrix would look like the following in a text file:</p>

<pre><code>000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011,000011110011\n
0101,0101,0101,0101
</code></pre>

<p>and retrieve the 2 sets of subarrays, one of 6 arrays of 4x4 and a single one of 4x4 for the second one. If you solve it for the single case is of course fine.</p>

<p>I did succeed to get a working login page, meaning I was able to log in. The following steps explain my setup. Writing a test case for this procedure did however fail. At this point I'm neither able to spot an error in my test, nor sure whether this approach makes sense before all. Can someone help me?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the meantime I have noticed, that my form error message was too unspecific. The issue appears to be caused by empty form fields that fail some form validation step. When I add the errors <code>{{ form.errors }}</code> to the template, the response contains the following (formatted a little less nicely):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""errorlist""&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;username
    &lt;ul class=""errorlist""&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This field is required.&lt;/li&gt;

<p>I'm still not sure how to test this procedure most reasonably. I'm quite new to Django and the philosophy of it's testing framework. May it be, that this issue falls not directly into the scope of the Django testing framework, where models, and views, and forms are (seemingly) intended to be tested rather seperated from each other? Does this test rather fall into the realm of an independent test suite doing black-box/functional testing, e.g., using Selenium?</p>

<hr>

<p>I started like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Started a fresh project, like this:</p>

<pre><code>django-admin.py startproject login_test
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>added an entry to the <code>login_test/urls.py</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^login/$', 'django.contrib.auth.views.login'),
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>made up a template at <code>/home/moooeeeep/login_test/templates/registration/login.html</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>{% if form.errors %}
&lt;p&gt;Your username and password didn't match. Please try again.&lt;/p&gt;
{% endif %}
{% if not user.is_active %}
&lt;form method=""post"" action=""{% url 'django.contrib.auth.views.login' %}""&gt;
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  &lt;button type=""submit""&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""next"" value=""{% url 'django.contrib.auth.views.login' %}"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
{% else %}
&lt;p&gt;You are logged in as &lt;strong&gt;{{ user.username }}&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
{% endif %}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>added the template directory to the <code>TEMPLATE_DIRS</code> in the <code>login_test/settings.py</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    '/home/moooeeeep/login_test/templates/',
)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Sync'ed the database to get the auth-related tables, and added a superuser like this:</p>

<pre><code>python manage.py syncdb
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>If I did not miss a step, at this point I am able to log into my site. When logged in I get displayed my username, if not I see the form, if login fails it displays an error message in addition.</p>

<hr>

<p>My test case however, after submitting correct post data, gets to see the failed login response, with the user not being logged in. </p>

<p>Here's my <code>login_test/tests.py</code>: </p>

<pre><code>from django.contrib.auth.models import User

<p>There's a lot of contradictory information on the web, regarding this subject. Thanks to @John, I managed to work out that the closures (as used below) aren't the cause of memory leaks, and that -even in IE8- they're not that common as people claim. In fact there was only 1 leak that occurred in my code, which proved not that difficult to fix. </p>

<p>From now on, my answer to this question will be:<br/>
<em>AFAIK, the only time IE8 leaks, is when events are attached/handlers are set on the global object. (<code>window.onload</code>,<code>window.onbeforeunload</code>,...). To get around this, see my answer below.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>HUGE</em> UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I'm completly lost now... After some time digging through articles and tuts both old and new, I'm left with at least one humongous contradiction. While one of <em>THE</em> JavaScript Guru's (Douglas Crockford) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since IE is unable to do its job and reclaim the cycles, it falls on us to do it. If we explicitly break the cycles, then IE will be able to reclaim the memory. According to Microsoft, closures are the cause of memory leaks. This is of course deeply wrong, but it leads to Microsoft giving very bad advice to programmers on how to cope with Microsoft's bugs. It turns out that it is easy to break the cycles on the DOM side. It is virtually impossible to break them on the JScript side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as @freakish pointed out that my snippets below are similar to jQuery's internal workings I felt pretty secure about my solution not causing memory leaks. At the same time I found <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250448%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"">this MSDN page</a>, where the section <code>Circular References with Closures</code> was of particular interest to me. The figure below is pretty much a schematic representation of how my code works, isn't it:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NIsKQ.gif"" alt=""Circular References with Closures""></p>

<p>The only difference being that I have the common sense of not attaching my event listeners to the elements themselves. <br/>All the same <em>Douggie</em> is quite unequivocal: closures are not the source of mem-leaks in IE. This contradiction leaves me clueless as to who's right. </p>

<p>I've also found out that the leak issue isn't completely solved in IE9 either (can't find the link ATM). </p>

<p><em>One last thing</em>: I've also come to learn that IE manages the DOM outside the JScript engine, which puts me in a spot of bother when I change the children of a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element, based on an ajax request: </p>

<pre><code>function changeSeason(e)
{
    var xhr,sendVal,targetID;
    e = e || window.event;//(IE...
    targetID = this.id.replace(/commonSourceFragment/,'commonTargetFragment');//fooHomeSelect -&gt; barHomeSelect
    sendVal = this.options[this.selectedIndex].innerHTML.trim().substring(0,1);
    xhr = prepareAjax(false,(function(t)
    {
        return function()
        {
            reusableCallback.apply(this,[t]);
        }
    })(document.getElementById(targetID)),'/index/ajax');
    xhr({data:{newSelect:sendVal}});
}

function reusableCallback(elem)
{
    if (this.readyState === 4 &amp;&amp; this.status === 200)
    {
        var data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
        elem.innerHTML = '&lt;option&gt;' + data.theArray.join('&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option&gt;') + '&lt;/option&gt;';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If IE really does manage the DOM as though the JScript engine weren't there, what are the odds that the option elements aren't deallocated using this code?<br/> I've deliberately added this snippet as an example, because in this case I'm passing variables that are part of the closure scope as an argument to a global function. I couldn't find any documentation on this practice, but based on the documentation provided by Miscrosoft, it should break any circular references that might occur, doesn't it? </p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: lengthy question... (<em>sorry</em>)</p>

<p>I've written a couple of fairly large JavaScripts to make Ajax calls in my web application. in order to avoid tons of callbacks and events, I'm taking full advantage of event delegation and closures. Now I've written a function that has me wondering as to possible memory leaks. Though I know IE > 8 deals with closures a lot better then its predecessors, it is company policy to support IE 8 all the same. </p>

<p>Below I've provided an example of what I'm on about, <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/6xsRv/"">here</a> you can find a similar example, though it doesn't use ajax, but a setTimeout, the result is pretty much the same. (You can, of course skip the code below, to the question itself)</p>

<p>The code I have in mind is this: </p>

<pre><code>function prepareAjax(callback,method,url)
{
    method = method || 'POST';
    callback = callback || success;//a default CB, just logs/alerts the response
    url = url || getUrl();//makes default url /currentController/ajax
    var xhr = createXHRObject();//try{}catch etc...
    xhr.open(method,url,true);
    xhr.setRequestMethod('X-Requested-with','XMLHttpRequest');
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type','application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept','*/*');
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function()
    {
        callback.apply(xhr);
    }
    return function(data)
    {
        //do some checks on data before sending: data.hasOwnProperty('user') etc...
        xhr.send(data);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All pretty straight-forward stuff, except for the <code>onreadystatechange</code> callback. I noticed some issues with IE when binding the handler directly: <code>xhr.onreadystatechange = callback;</code>, hence the anonymous function. Don't know why, but I found this to be the easiest way to make it work. </p>

<p>As I said, I'm using a lot of event delegation, so you can imagine it may prove useful to have access to the actual element/event that fired the ajax call. So I have some event handlers that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>function handleClick(e)
{
    var target,parent,data,i;
    e = e || window.event;
    target = e.target || e.srcElement;
    if (target.tagName.toLowerCase() !== 'input' &amp;&amp; target.className !== 'delegateMe')
    {
        return true;
    }
    parent = target;
    while(parent.tagName.toLowerCase() !== 'tr')
    {
        parent = parent.parentNode;
    }
    data = {};
    for(i=0;i&lt;parent.cells;i++)
    {
        data[parent.cells[i].className] = parent.cells[i].innerHTML;
    }
    //data looks something like {name:'Bar',firstName:'Foo',title:'Mr.'}
    i = prepareAjax((function(t)
    {
        return function()
        {
            if (this.readyState === 4 &amp;&amp; this.status === 200)
            {
                //check responseText and, if ok:
                t.setAttribute('disabled','disabled');
            }
        }
    })(target));
    i(data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <code>onreadystatechange</code> callback is the return value of a function, that provides the reference to the <code>target</code> element when the callback is called. Thanks to event delegation, I no longer have to worry about events that might be bound to that element, when I decide to remove it from the DOM (which I do sometimes). <br/>
To my mind, however, the call object of the callback function might prove too much for IE's JScript engine and its garbage collector:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Event ==> handler ==> prepareAjax is a pretty normal call sequence, but the callback argument:</p>
  
  <p>[anon. func (argument t = target) returns anon. F (has access to t which in turn refs back to target)]<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;===> passed to a anon callback function, called using .apply method to the xhr object, in turn a <em>private</em> variable to the prepareAjax function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've tested this ""construction"" in FF and chrome. It works just fine there, but would this kind of callstack of closure upon closure upon closure, on each occasion passing a reference to a DOM element be an issue in IE (especially versions prior to IE9)?</p>

<hr>

<p>No, I'm not going to use jQuery or other libs. I like pure JS, and want to know as much as I can about this seriously underrated language. The code snippets are not actual copy-paste examples, but provide, IMO, a good representation of how I'm using delegation, closures and callbacks throughout my script. So if some syntax isn't quite right, feel free to correct it, but that's not what this question is about, of course. </p>

<p>This works up to a point, if you open the <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/xc2cgs6b/show"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/xc2cgs6b/show</a> and your browser is more than 640px it will show a grid, if you then resize the browser to less than 640px it will show a slideshow, so far it works fine, but once you resize it over 640px again it should go back to the grid but it doesn't, also if you open the browser less than 640px, it doesn't work at all.</p>

For this i read their guide for using <code>OAuth 2.0</code> here. Broadly i followed these steps</p>

<ol>
<li>Register my app with google and get a client id and client secret and registered my <code>redirect uri</code> with them</li>
<li>now i first created a file called <code>sample.php</code> on which if the user clicks on <code>get contacts</code> he is redirected to google confirmation page</li>
<li>now google asks for confirmation and if the user agrees to provide its contact details then he is redirected to the <code>redirect uri</code> with a <code>code</code>.</li>
<li>now i extract the code and make a post request to get the OAuth token and if i get the token i make a request for the contacts.</li>
</ol>

<p>The code for the <code>sample.php</code> looks like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$client_id=""my client id"";
$redirect_uri=""http://localhost/htdocs/contacts/redirect.php"";

<p>now the problem is that step 4 fails. It goes well till the confirmation step and when i click <code>Allow access</code> i am redirected to my <code>redirect uri</code> but its saying </p>

<p><strong>Required parameter is missing: grant_type  Error 400</strong> </p>

<p>now i dont understand this because i am providing the <code>grant_type</code> parameter. i looked in <code>firebug</code> and found out that a post request is being made but not the one which i intended. the post request that is being made is this<br>
<code>https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/approval?xsrfsign=AC9jObYAAAAATkfm3uvx0sfsW7WVmB_FeRqVPLjDcTLz</code> and the status says <code>302 moved Temporarily</code>. I dont understand whats going on. have they changed something in the <code>OAuth workflow</code>? Need some help</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
As suggested bu <strong>Ikke</strong> i removed the space before <code>grant_type</code> and it worked. Now i can get the access token but still i am unable to get the contacts.(<em>i get an error as <code>Empty string supplied as input in htdocs\contacts\redirect.php on line 35</code> and <code>line 35</code> refers to <code>$dom-&gt;loadXML($xml)</code>; so it seems that the get request is not being made</em>) Moreover i am not able to see the post request being made in <code>firebug</code> (but surely its being made because i get the access token as the response). i also dont see the get request in <code>firebug</code> which i make after post request whats wrong?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
the problem was that the request was on https and i was not using the appropriate headers for https. I used the correct headers and it worked.Problem solved? Maybe. Because i still dont understand why i am unable to see those get and post requests in <code>firebug's'</code>net` tab</p>

<p>What we hope to achieve by this is that we can have karma running on one of our servers and that whenever we upload new code or tests, our tests will be re-run on a myriad of different browsers. The html-files generated by these tests could then be displayed by anyone wanting to see whether or not all tests still go green on all the different desktop and mobile browsers tested.</p>

<p>Currently I've looked into using Karma's junit reporter and then post-process these files with ant to get HTML-files, but we're currently using Grunt as our building tool and I'd prefer not having to include ant to the mix.</p>

<p>Also, is there some sort of guide to creating Karma reporters if we decide that creating one would be the best way to solve our issue?</p>

Although it decreases the redundant code in my test method (instead of writing all test data in test method and calling same function everytime) but on the other hand I think it is making my Unit test complicated(with configuration Settings, parsing data from Excel, unexpected exceptions..etc). Can anyone please throw some light on the pros and cons of each approach. For better understanding I am writting below a sample test method with and without data source:</p>

<p><strong>Without Data Source</strong></p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
[DataSource(""CompanyAddressInfo_DataSource"")]
[DeploymentItem(""CoreUnitTests\\CompanyUnitTests\\CompanyTestData.xlsx"")]
public void CompanyAddressInfo_GetItem_Test()
{
    if (TestContext.DataRow[""Company_No""] != DBNull.Value)
    {
        bool expected = false;
        bool actual=false;

        if (TestContext.DataRow[""Expected""].ToString() == ""Y"")
        expected = true;
        long Company_No = Convert.ToInt64(TestContext.DataRow[""Company_No""]);

        CompanyAddressInfo obj = CompanyAddressInfo.GetItem(Company_No);

        if (obj != null)
        {actual = (obj.Company_No == Company_No);}

        Assert.AreEqual(expected,actual);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Without Data Source</strong></p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void CompanyAddressInfo_GetItem_Test()
{
    bool actual=false;

    long Company_No;

    Company_No = 20;
    CompanyAddressInfo obj = CompanyAddressInfo.GetItem(Company_No);
    actual = (obj.Company_No == Company_No);
    Assert.AreEqual(true,actual);

    Company_No = 23;
    CompanyAddressInfo obj = CompanyAddressInfo.GetItem(Company_No);
    actual = (obj.Company_No == Company_No);
    Assert.AreEqual(false,actual);

    ..............so on

}
</code></pre>

<p>Please not that above mentioned code is just an example. Also, another alternative to data driven unit testing I thought could be to make a generic function for calling dll and pass test data to this function (Hence reducing the redundancy). </p>

"10669133","1","10669200","","2012-05-19 21:56:34","","1","523","<h1>Question:</h1>

<p>How do I use Python's regular expression module (<code>re</code>) to determine if a match has been made, or that a potential match could be made?</p>

<h1>Details:</h1>

<p>I want a regex pattern which searches for a pattern of words in a correct order regardless of what's between them. I want a function which returns <code>Yes</code> if found, <code>Maybe</code> if a match could still be found or <code>No</code> if no match can be found. We are looking for the pattern <code>One|....|Two|....|Three</code>, here are some examples (Note the names, their count, or their order are not important, all I care about is the three words <code>One</code>, <code>Two</code> and <code>Three</code>, and the acceptable words in between are <code>John</code>, <code>Malkovich</code>, <code>Stamos</code> and <code>Travolta</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Returns YES:</strong></p>

<pre><code>One|John|Malkovich|Two|John|Stamos|Three|John|Travolta
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Returns YES:</strong></p>

<pre><code>One|John|Two|John|Three|John
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Returns YES:</strong></p>

<pre><code>One|Two|Three
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Returns MAYBE:</strong></p>

<pre><code>One|Two
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Returns MAYBE:</strong></p>

<pre><code>One
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Returns NO:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Three|Two|One
</code></pre>

<p>I understand the examples are not airtight, so here is what I have for the regex to get YES:</p>

<pre><code>if re.match('One\|(John\||Malkovich\||Stamos\||Travolta\|)*Two\|(John\||Malkovich\||Stamos\||Travolta\|)*Three\|(John\||Malkovich\||Stamos\||Travolta\|)*', 'One|John|Malkovich|Two|John|Stamos|Three|John|Travolta') != None
   return 'Yes'
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously if the pattern is <code>Three|Two|One</code> the above will fail, and we can return <code>No</code>, but how do I check for the <code>Maybe</code> case? I thought about nesting the parentheses, like so (note, not tested)</p>

<pre><code>if re.match('One\|((John\||Malkovich\||Stamos\||Travolta\|)*Two(\|(John\||Malkovich\||Stamos\||Travolta\|)*Three\|(John\||Malkovich\||Stamos\||Travolta\|)*)*)*', 'One|John|Malkovich|Two|John|Stamos|Three|John|Travolta') != None
   return 'Yes'
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't think that will do what I want it to do.</p>

<h1>More Details:</h1>

<p>I am not actually looking for <code>Travoltas</code> and <code>Malkovichs</code> (shocking, I know). I am matching against inotify Patterns such as <code>IN_MOVE</code>, <code>IN_CREATE</code>, <code>IN_OPEN</code>, and  I am logging them and getting hundreds of them, then I go in and then look for a particular pattern such as <code>IN_ACCESS</code>...<code>IN_OPEN</code>....<code>IN_MODIFY</code>, but in some cases I don't want an <code>IN_DELETE</code> after the <code>IN_OPEN</code> and in others I do. I'm essentially pattern matching to use inotify to detect when <em>text editors gone wild</em> and they try to crush programmers souls by doing a temporary-file-swap-save instead of just modifying the file. I don't want to free up those logs instantly, but I only want to hold on to them for as long as is necessary. <code>Maybe</code> means dont erase the logs. <code>Yes</code> means do something then erase the log and <code>No</code> means don't do anything but still erase the logs. As I will have multiple rules for each program (ie. <code>vim</code> v <code>gedit</code> v <code>emacs</code>) I wanted to use a regular expression which would be more human readable and easier to write then creating a massive tree, or as user <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/1142167/joel-cornett"">Joel</a> suggested, just going over the words with a loop</p>

<p>I've been searching and reading a couple days, but I need some Rails help- </p>

<p>Here is my goal: I want to make a multi-page profile for each user, and I'd like to handle this profile with a profile controller. </p>

<p>The problem? How do I make the 'show' REST action apply to an entire controller instead of just one page? Specifically, how can I have both a @current_user and a @user variable available in the Profile controller that correspond to the signed-in user and the current user's page.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I should be making routes with multiple :id s in the route or if there is some way to persist the signed-in-user in something like @current_user when they sign in that is just available everywhere and then I would use the :id of the user who's profile it is in the route. I'm pretty sure facebook does something like facebook.com/{your_id}/{their_id}/ for example. </p>

<p>I tried accessing @current_user from my session_helper.rb class but it came up nil and I'm not sure how to pass the :id to use User.find(params[:id]) because the profile controller is not affiliated with the resource for the User model.</p>

<p>Any protips or links to helpful readings would be much appreciated. I'm a beginner so feel free to suggest a better course of action if I'm going against the rails way. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I am doing some drawing on Canvas, I use Path.quadTo() with few points and my Paint has CornerPathEffect. So how can I get the y position of the line when x can be anything? Is there some algorithm behind CornerPathEffect which can lead to me get precise calculation in here?</p>

<p>I have 1 web page, lets call it X, that performs a query to pull data out.
I have a short url redirect page, lets call this Y, that takes the ID and redirects it to page X with the ID to perform the query.</p>

<p>So when I attempt to upload my sitemap to google, it says INVALID URL.</p>

<p>www.domain.com/Y?ID -> www.domain.com/X?ID</p>

<p>The purpose of this is that webpage X is a VERY LONG ugly URL.</p>

<p>I have 10 of these listed with 10 different IDs. I am unsure of what I can do. I read somewhere regarding 301 redirect page, however, I don't fully understand it.</p>

<p>I think I may have the answer but I am unsure if it's correct, but the way I see this working is having TWO sitemaps.</p>

<p>The first sitemap contains www.domain.com/Y and some sub URL that will call the 2nd sitemap which will contain ALL possible entries of www.domain.com/X?ID
This way the bot can crawl through the first sitemap and knows that it needs to go to my second sitemap with all the long ugly URLS. Only problem is how would I be able to pass the ID into my redirect page.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated 
{ 
    [super viewWillAppear:animated]; 

    myTableView = [[UITableView alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame] style:UITableViewStylePlain]; 
    myTableView.delegate = self; 
    myTableView.dataSource = self; 

    myTableView.autoresizesSubviews = YES; 

    .......

    self.view = myTableView; 

    UIBarButtonItem *addButton = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemBookmarks target:self action:@selector(setEditing:animated:)];     
    self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = addButton; 
    [addButton release]; 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I used self.editButtonItem instead of my addButton, the editing mode IS animated. And here's my setEditing:animated: method. I can get my tableview into editing mode and the insert button appeared immediately to the left. I've tried <code>[myTableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[myTableView indexPathsForVisibleRows] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];</code> 
but it doesn't help on iOS 4.3.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing animated:(BOOL)animated{

<p>I've been developing a script to make certain search/compare/retrieve data on Linux systems.
In particular what I'm trying to cross is data from 2 files previously created by the script with the following example text:</p>

<pre><code>file_1:

/dev/abcde_vg/abcde_lv            APP     /bbdd_abcde                          
/dev/abcde_vg/system_lv           APP     /bbdd_abcde/system                   
/dev/abcde_vg/data_lv             DAT     /bbdd_abcde/data      

file_2:              

/bbdd_abcde         APP 
/bbdd_abcde/system      APP 
/bbdd_abcde/data            DAT
</code></pre>

<p>The goal here is to getting a list of the first column of the file 2 with awk:</p>

<pre><code>for i in `cat file_2|awk '{print $1}'
do ..........;done
</code></pre>

<p>and to obtain something similar to the following statement:</p>

<pre><code>awk '$3 ~ ""^/bbdd_abcde$""{print $0}' file_1
/dev/abcde_vg/abcde_lv            APP     /bbdd_abcde  
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried the following with no success:</p>

<pre><code>for i in `cat file_2|awk '{print $2}'
do
awk -v VAR1=""$i"" '$3 ~ VAR1{print $0}' (or awk -v VAR1=""$i"" '$3 ~ ""^VAR1$""{print $0}' or similars)
done
</code></pre>

<p>With no success at all.</p>

<p>============ RESOLVED ==============
Thanks for the answers the final fix to this I applied was to search for exact match using AWK with this:</p>

<p>for i in <code>cat file_2|awk '{print $2}'</code>
do
awk -v VAR1=""$i"" '$3 == VAR1{print $0}'
done</p>

<p>The idea behind this is more complex, the problem itself is part of a 200+ script for crossing data using bash only</p>

<p>The script generates a file on each server with a format like explained before </p>

<pre><code>/dev/abcde_vg/abcde_lv            APP     /bbdd_abcde                          
/dev/abcde_vg/system_lv           APP     /bbdd_abcde/system                   
/dev/abcde_vg/data_lv             DAT     /bbdd_abcde/data  
</code></pre>

<p>And those files are check against a ""how it should be"" file on a NAS with the format:</p>

<pre><code>/bbdd_          APP 
/bbdd_/system       APP 
/bbdd_/data                 DAT
</code></pre>

<p>To verify if the ""type"" of disk assigned to a lv is correct. (disk types are figured out in other part of script)</p>

<p>So the goal was to compare each mountpoint disk type ""APP/DAT..."" to the same in ""how it should be""</p>

<p>the main problem for me was that searching for a specific mount point like ""/bbdd_abcde"" on one file with awk and ""~"" I got a lot of results instead of only the exact one.
I needed to use ""=="" in my awk statement.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help              </p>

"23181882","1","23184343","","2014-04-20 12:19:22","","0","62","<p>Yeah. Talk about confusing titles. So this is the scenario: I've a generic class <code>PromiseListener</code> which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class PromiseListener&lt;T&gt;
{
    public virtual void IsResovled(T value)
    {
        return;
    }

    public virtual void IsSpoiled()
    {
        return;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This class is supposed to be implemented and its methods overridden. An implementation of this class may look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestPromiseListener : PromiseListener&lt;float&gt;
{
    public override void IsResovled(float value)
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(""RMI RETURNED VALUE "" + value);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>TestPromiseListener</code> is what's implemented by users. What I need to do is store listeners in a dictionary (key is irrelevant for this problem). This is the context of the problem: a <code>promise</code> is an unresolved return-value of a remote method which may eventually resolve to an actual value. A promise is immediately returned when a remote method invocation is made. So then you can ""install"" a <code>PromiseListener</code> whose methods have been implemented by a derived class (<code>TestPromiseListener</code>). One of these methods is <code>IsResovled</code> which takes one argument: the return value of the remote method invocation. This method would be called when the remote method invocation finally returns a value.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble storing the objects in a dictionary. I could store the listeners as <code>object</code>, but I don't see how I could get a listener from the dictionary without knowing the type first, because I would need to know its original type to cast it to. When fetching the PromiseListener I only know the type of the return value (and all information to fetch the right listener from a dictionary). So what I'm asking is: is there a type-safe way to store these generic objects, fetch them and call their methods?</p>

<p>(Some more detailed info as requested - sorry for the wall of text)
Both <code>IsResolved</code> and <code>IsSpoiled</code> may be called at different times. A promise can resolve if a return value has been received (calls <code>IsResolved</code>) or it may be spoiled when no return value could be received (due to a network error, for example) (calls <code>IsSpoiled</code>). The <code>PromiseListener</code> a user implements may choose to override any of these methods. So internally I have a method which is called when a return value has been received from the network. In this method I have the identifier for the listener (key in the mentioned dictionary), the actual return value (object) and the AssemblyQualifiedName of the return value (which I can use to convert the return value of type <code>object</code> to the correct type). I'll then have to find the correct listener - which I can because I have its identifier - but I don't know how to fetch it in a type-save way because I don't know what type the listener is supposed to be.</p>

<pre><code>?Type? listener; // Don't know what type the listener is. Could be PromiseListener&lt;string&gt; or PromiseListener&lt;int&gt; - or anything, really
if(promiseManager.TryGetPromiseListener(promise, out listener)

<p>Here the chart is working fine. But the problem is in data.php file the php variable $df  has some value which is posted by the form. But when I try try to use that is where clause it is not getting that value. </p>

<p>But if enter the value manually like
$result = mysql_query(""SELECT subj_area, documents, auth_name FROM subj_area WHERE  auth_name='Ronnie'"");</p>

<p>As shown above if i enter the value directly as Ronnie then its working. What is the problem actually? Please help.</p>

<p>But it never reaches the breakpoints that I have set in the function Initialize (form the class that inherits and implements the IshellExtInit class). When I do a right click on a file, the right click menu initialises with the custom context menu and performs desired actions, but no breakpoint hitting involved!!
I want to know how can I debug because I'm trying to register the context menu for the recycle bin and it doesn't work, I want to see what's happening with the code.
The code for registration with the Recycle Bin can be found on this post:

<p>I expected Core Data to be little more intuitive. I am new in it and I could use some help. 
I fetched all objects(rows) from the entity (table) City. Now I have an array of objects. From the array I need to extract the attribute “streetName” to an array which will feed the picker. I figured I need to do it in the loop but I could not figure out the way to do it. 
Please help.</p>

<p>I have a background with SQL but Core Data is still a big mystery to me. Is there any publication which would take a SQL statement and show comparable Core Data syntax?</p>

Cross compiling in this manner seems like a great idea, but I have to wonder, how do they overcome the fundamental differences between the two type systems? One specific example of my general question is heterogeneous data structures. Statically typed languages don't tend to let you put arbitrary types into an array or other container because they need to be able to figure out the types on the other end. If I have a PHP array like this:</p>

<pre><code>$mixedBag = array(""cat"", 42, 8.5, false);
</code></pre>

<p>How can this be represented in C++ code? One option would be to use void pointers (or the superior version, boost::any), but then you need to cast when you take stuff back out of the array... and I'm not at all convinced that the type inferencer can always figure out what to cast to at the other end. A better option, perhaps, would be something more like a union (or boost::variant), but then you need to enumerate all possible types at compile time... maybe possible, but certainly messy since arrays can contain arbitrarily complex entities.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how HipHop and similar tools which go from a dynamic typing discipline to a static discipline handle these types of problems?</p>

The frequency table is generated from counting the frequency of characters in a given string and placing the respective item (character and frequency) in a LinkedList. I then need to place the items in a Huffman Tree in order of their frequency. I get that the logic behind it is to make sure there are right and left nodes to each subtree, add their frequencies, create a root node with their added frequencies, place the next frequencies in the left and right trees respectively and repeat this process until there are no more frequencies and the subtrees are connected with a root that adds their frequencies; the trouble I am having is figuring out how to implement the code. </p>

<p>The code is rather extensive so I would rather avoid posting all of it, the general layout is that I have a HuffmanFrequencyTable class that allows me to build the table, a HuffmanTreeNode class that allows us to create nodes to place in the tree, and a HuffmanTree class that helps us create the actual tree. An encode class then inputs a string and builds the tree from the string using the HuffmanFrequencyTable it creates. This is a homework problem so please do not provide solutions, I am just hoping for some help in figuring out the logic in the code of it.</p>

<p>Right now, I am creating an array of characters that have been placed in the tree, finding the lowest frequency among characters remaining in the table that aren't in the array, and attempting to place them in leafs. When the base leafs are full in the subtrees I am trying to add those values, create a node, and continue up the tree. I am using a for loop for this. Does this seem like the right start?</p>

<pre><code>typedef typename cusp::csr_matrix&lt; int,

class CuspMatrix
: 
  public csr_matrix,
  public Matrix

}
</code></pre>

<p>At some point, I have to do an assignment, which will copy the base class object from the host to the device like so:</p>

<pre><code>cusp::csr_matrix&lt;int,float,cusp::host_memory&gt; A(4,3,6);
cusp::csr_matrix&lt;int,float,cusp::device_memory&gt; A = B;
</code></pre>

<p>but before I can do that, I have to upcast my <strong>this</strong> to its base class <strong>csr_matrix</strong></p>

<p>I've tried with <strong>static_cast</strong> and a custom cast operator:</p>

<pre><code>operator csr_matrix()
{
  return *( cusp::csr_matrix&lt; int,float,cusp::device_memory&gt; *)this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to do the actual thing, I get tons of errors from the compiler</p>

<pre><code>cusp::csr_matrix&lt;int,float,cusp::device_memory&gt; mtx = *(csr_matrix *)this;
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, static casting also is beyond me at this point:</p>

<pre><code>auto me = static_cast&lt;csr_matrix&gt;( *this );
cusp::csr_matrix&lt;int,float,cusp::device_memory&gt; mtx = me;
</code></pre>

<p>yet, a C-style shotgun cast without the typedef, seems to work:</p>

<pre><code>auto me = *( cusp::csr_matrix&lt; int,
                               float,
                               cusp::host_memory&gt; *)this;
</code></pre>

<p>but fails with the typedef:</p>

<pre><code>auto me = *( csr_matrix *)this;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>So, How can I safely up-cast using my own custom operator, preferably by
using a static cast?</strong></p></li>

<pre><code>class C(object):
    def __hash__(self):
        return 42
</code></pre>

<p>I just assumed that only one instance of the above class can be in a set at any time, but in fact a set can have multiple elements with same hash.</p>

<pre><code>c, d = C(), C()
x = {c: 'c', d: 'd'}
print x
# {&lt;__main__.C object at 0x83e98cc&gt;:'c', &lt;__main__.C object at 0x83e98ec&gt;:'d'}
# note that the dict has 2 elements
</code></pre>

<p>I experimented a little more and found that if I override the <code>__eq__</code> method such that all the instances of the class compare equal, then the set only allows one instance.</p>

<pre><code>class D(C):
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return hash(self) == hash(other)

p, q = D(), D()
y = {p:'p', q:'q'}
print y

# note that the dict has only 1 element

<p>So I am curious to know how can a dict have multiple elements with same hash. Thanks!</p>

<p>Note: Edited the question to give example of dict (instead of set) because all the discussion in the answers is about dicts. But the same applies to sets; sets can also have multiple elements with same hash value.</p>

<p>It's Ok But there's a problem which is driving me crazy; <strong>K2 Item pages inherit the class of the ""content container"" from top level pages such as category pages</strong> So while on item view I have 1 module position lesser than category view, the content container would not fill enough width.
I use this snippet to show module position on every k2 page except item views:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php   
    $com = JRequest::getCmd('option');
    $view  = JRequest::getCmd('view');
    if(!($com =='com_k2' &amp;&amp; $view!=='item')) : ?&gt;
        &lt;jdoc:include type=""modules"" name=""position-5"" style=""xhtml"" /&gt;
&lt;?php endif ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As expected <code>pistion-5</code> codes don't exist on item views' HTML source but still the content container uses ""<strong>span6</strong>"" class which belongs to 3-columns pages. (Actually we need ""span9"" class for the content container on item pages). ُThese classes are chosen through below function:</p>

<pre><code> public function isContent ()
   {
      $modLeft  = $this-&gt;theme-&gt;countModules('position-7');
      $modItem  = $this-&gt;theme-&gt;countModules('position-custom');
      $modRight = $this-&gt;theme-&gt;countModules('position-5');

  switch(true) {

One of the things I am wrestling with is the idea of a ""page"", and how to represent that properly within MVC.  To my knowledge, CodeIgniter has a front controller that delegates to page controllers. In my thought process, each page would have it's own controller. All too often though I see someone using a page controller stuffed with many methods.  So in that sense, each action becomes it's own page.</p>

<p>I've never really liked the idea of stuffing many methods into one controller, because it seems like there will be too much overhead if you only need one method or two in the controller at a time. It's seems more reasonable for each page to have it's own controller, and the actions would only correspond to something you can do on that particular page. Am I thinking about this the wrong way?</p>

<p>What makes it more confusing is I'll notice in some web applications where they will have one controller that will have multiple methods (i.e. login, register, view, edit, etc.), but then on others they actually have a login controller, and a register controller. What is the proper use of a ""page controller""?</p>

<p>I can not for the life of my figure out why it will not pick up the mysql database resourse stored in the <code>$con</code> variable during the contructor call and use it in other functions.</p>

<p>Eventually there will be an encryption function for strings in another class but the only errors I am currently getting fall on the connection class.</p>

<p>So the page throwing the error looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>include 'connection.php';
include 'loginClass.php';
$longinConnection = new Connection('***USERNAMEHERE***','***PASSWORD***');
$longinConnection-&gt;dbConnect(""***DBTOCONNECTTO***"");
echo Authoriz::encryptPassword(""***USERPASSWORD***"",$longinConnection);
</code></pre>

<p>This page tests the <code>encryptPassword</code> function but I can't even get the <code>Connection</code> class to work. The errors it throws are below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warning: mysql_select_db() expects parameter 2 to be resource, null given in [PATH] on line 27
  There has been a connection error on line 31
  Active Connection Error
  Data Base Selection Error</p>
  
  <p>Warning: mysql_close() expects parameter 1 to be resource, null given in [PATH] on line 103</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that the <code>$con</code> variable is not being set for some reason any insight into what I am doing wrong would be greatly appreciated. </p>

These beans have both JPA and JAXB annotations, and are being used in a RESTful implementation. Most of my relationships are lazy-loaded, and I was hoping to achieve some more granular control over which elements are actually marshalled for transport.</p>

<p>I've got the modified MOXy Customer.java class below.</p>

<pre><code>@javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType

public class Customer {

  private List&lt;PhoneNumber&gt; phoneNumbers;

  // getters and setters
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was hoping I'd be able to use the MOXy eclipselink-oxm mapping to control what gets marshalled, but it isn't behaving as I'd expect. Using JAXB annotations, you declare an element (field or property) to be transient, but the eclipselink-oxm.xml only allows transient declarations on types. However, when I declare a type transient like so, I get the following exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;xml-bindings 
    xmlns=""http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/xsds/persistence/oxm""&gt;

    &lt;/java-type&gt;

    &lt;java-type name=""example.gettingstarted.PhoneNumber"" xml-transient=""true"" /&gt;

&lt;/java-types&gt;
&lt;/xml-bindings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Exception:</p>

<pre><code>Exception [EclipseLink-110] (Eclipse Persistence Services - 2.1.0.v20100614-r7608):     org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DescriptorException

Descriptor: XMLDescriptor(example.gettingstarted.Customer --&gt; [DatabaseTable(customer)])
</code></pre>

<p>If I remove the xml-transient attribute, or set it to false, the Customer is transformed into XML as expected. Is there any way I can suppress the marshalling of phone numbers without modifying the Customer bean?</p>

When a car arrives, the massage should specify whether or not there is room for the car in garage. If there is no room for a car, the car waits until there is room or until a departure line is read for the car. When room becomes available, another massage should be printed.

<p>If user hits ok and then accepts application permissions running up is automatically killed and when installation is done <strong>Application installed</strong> message comes with <strong>Open</strong> and <strong>Done</strong> buttons.</p>

<p>So things go out my control.I want to automatically run the newly installed .apk after this re-install process but my activity is already killed and replaced with a new one.</p>

<p>How can I figure it out and start my app after re-install under these cimcumstances?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I solve the problem importing all .so dependencies of mesos, but not is a pretty solution and then al developers need to know mesos .so</p>

<p>I research about: How run spark app on <strong>IntelliJ IDEA</strong> but all examples show the first scenario runing locally.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it the valid scenario to develop an sapark app? or the rigth flow is develop algorith locally and later use spark-submit to run on mesos?</p></li>
<li><p>Anybody know a better way to run spark app from <strong>IntelliJ IDEA</strong> to run on spark mesos cluster?</p></li>

<p>so ive created an image upload page which saves the image to a folder and sends the file name to the DB, ive checked to see if they are actually being added to the DB and folder which they are, but when i call the data to another page to display the images i get broken images.</p>

<p>below is my code to call the images, its some code ive scraped together from various tutorials as they gave me the same problem as im having now.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
ive managed to get the images showing but now im faced with being shown the same image for each row of data called, the id and img_name and right for each row but the image is always the same as the first listed.</p>

<p>UPDATED CODE:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
//connect to database
include ('connect.php');

//save the name of image in table
$query = mysql_query(""select * from tbl_img"") or die(mysql_error());

//retrieve all image from database and store them in a variable
while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($query))
{
    $img_name = $row['img'];
}

&lt;?php

include ('connect.php');

$img_id = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM tbl_img"");

while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($img_id))

$id = $row['img_id'];

<pre><code>- (UIView *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView viewForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    Target *aTarget = [targetDictionary objectForKey:[NSNumber numberWithInteger:section]];
    UILabel *headerLabel = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 20, self.TargetTableView.frame.size.width, 20)];

    headerLabel.textColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
    UIView *headerView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.TargetTableView.frame.size.width, 200)];
    headerView.backgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
//    [headerView addSubview:headerLabel];

    return [headerView autorelease];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Couple questions.  For my headerView, I wanted the height to be 40, but it looked SO small.  Then I changed it to 60, and I saw it didn't change at all in my <code>UITableView</code> (I'm presenting this data in a popover which I don't think should matter).  So I made the height 200 just to see if it would change and the orange view I have is tiny.  Probably only as big as the status bar if that.</p>

<p>Next I have my <code>UILabel</code>.  I want it to be somehwat centered in my <code>UIView</code>.  When I show it though, it's not even in my <code>UIView</code>.  It's on top of my first row of my <code>UITableView</code>.  When I initialize it with the <code>CGRectMake()</code>, is it setting it in the coordinates of the parent view or something that is shifting it off?  I was trying to create it where I'd want to position it once I add it to my headerView.</p>

<p>Lastly, if I want to add a simple background gradient to my tableView, do I just set the <code>UITableView.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor]</code>, and have the backgroundView set to a gradient?  Cause that too does not seem to be working?  I only see the default colors of the grouped tableView.  Thanks.</p>

Anyway, I am trying to obtain user data from Facebook, just  his/her name, user id and email; however, I can't use the Login Button because it doesn't support Nested Fragments and it uses UiLifecycleHelper which keeps a Session open and keeps executing a callback that I only want to call once.</p>

<p>I don't need to keep a Session open; I will sporadically open Sessions the first time the user uses the app and if he/she wants to publish something (very rare).</p>

<p>So far I have tried using the Login Button, performing a simple Request and combining both. However, it seems that the SDK as a whole doesn't play very well with Nested Fragment.</p>

<p>So, what happens? The dialog prompt is shown in order to login using your Facebook account. But, once  you press Login and the dialog disappears, nothing happens. Nothing is shown in the LogCat. I think is a problem with the onActivityResult method, because the callback is never executed. I tried re-adding the UiLifecycleHelper, but it ends up making unwanted calls to the callback (I only want to call this method once).</p>

What i'm trying to do is when someone checks one or more rows a garbage can icon appears.
Clicking on the garbage can deletes the chosen rows.</p>

<p>This is the code i wrote so far:</p>

<p><strong>The div where the garbage can appears:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""hidden"" id=""adminPanelShow""&gt;
      &lt;img src=""../images/garbage.jpg"" class=""adminPanelIcons""/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;img class=""hrLine"" src=""images/line.png""/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Table:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
         &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type = ""checkbox"" name=""idPriv[]"" id=""idPriv""  onclick=""evaluateIT(this)"" data-related-item=""adminPanelShow"" value =""&lt;?php echo $value[""id""]?&gt;"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""text"" name=""userName[]"" id=""userName"" class=""adminPanel"" value=""&lt;?php echo $value[""userName""]?&gt;""/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;&lt;input  name=""firstName[]"" type=""text"" id=""firstName"" class=""adminPanel"" value=""&lt;?php echo $value[""firstName""]?&gt;""/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;&lt;input  name=""lastName[]"" type=""text"" id=""lastName"" class=""adminPanel"" value=""&lt;?php echo $value[""lastName""]?&gt;""/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The javascript code:</p>

<pre><code>function evaluateIT(obj){

    var item = $(obj);
    var relatedItem = $(""#"" + item.attr(""data-related-item""));
    var length = $(""input:checked"").length;

    if(item.is("":checked"") )
        relatedItem.fadeIn();
    else if(item.not("":checked"") &amp;&amp; length == 0)
        relatedItem.fadeOut();   

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, everything is working good, But how can i pass the values (id numbers..) from the selected checkboxes into an onclick function of the garbage can?
That means, I want that each time i click the garbage can i can do some operations with the values of the chosen checkboxes.</p>

So - I need a coffescript which will create a copy of an element,  strip all values from any input elements, and append this copy to the document when asked to do so.  Here is my disfunctional attempt:</p>

<pre><code>template = $('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;')
template.addClass('proposal-unit')

stripText = -&gt;
  this.val("""") 

addUnit = -&gt;
  $('#proposal-properties').append(template)
  $('.delete-row').on(""click"", deleteUnit)

deleteUnit = -&gt;
  $(this).closest('.proposal-unit').remove()

reload = -&gt;
  $('#add-row').on(""click"", addUnit)
  $('.delete-row').on(""click"", deleteUnit)
  template.html($('.proposal-unit').first().html())
  template.find('input').each stripText

$(document).on('page:load', reload)

$ -&gt;
  reload()
</code></pre>

<p>Help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I've tried: </p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(ACTION_MAIN);
intent.addCategory(CATEGORY_LAUNCHER);
</code></pre>

<p>and this only shows application that are preinstalled or can run the ACTION_MAIN Intent type.</p>

<p>I also know I can use PackageManager to get all the installed applications, but how do I use this to run a specific application?</p>

<p>Thanks </p>

I've previously done all my development in Python using Django, but as we're a windows shop we're probably going to go with ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p>We won't really be able to afford a SQLServer license though, so we were perhaps looking into using Postgresql. However I can't seem to find many examples or guides for people who want to utilise a third party ORM - or at least, an ORM with similar usage as Django - that works with Postgresql.</p>

<p>Ultimately we'd like to handle authentication via Active Directory [including groups], but store actual content within the db.</p>

<p>There have been previous questions of a similar nature, but most of them are over a year old when MVC was stil in Beta.</p>

<p>I then have two UIVCs, UIVC1 and UIVC2 I want MY_CELL to segue to UIVC1 and MY_CELL_2 to segue to UIVC2 so I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender

    if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@""cell_to_vc1""])
    {

    UICollectionViewCell *cell = (UICollectionViewCell *)sender;

    UIVC1 *vc1 = (VC1 *)segue.destinationViewController;


    }

    if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@""cell2_to_vc2""])
    {

      UICollectionViewCell *cell2 = (UICollectionViewCell *)sender;
    NSIndexPath *indexPath = [self.collectionView indexPathForCell:cell];

    UIVC2 *vc2 = (VC2 *)segue.destinationViewController;

    }


}

<p>However, I can't even see the second cell being displayed. Only MY_CELL is visible.</p>

<p>Anyone know what I'm doing incorrectly and why I cannot see the second cell?</p>

After lots of mucking about I found that the error was being generated due to Russian characters being stored in these tables.</p>

<p>For example: <code>Бухгалтерский учет</code></p>

<p>There are other non-English characters in the tables, such as <code>Profissão Jurídica</code> and they are coming through OK.</p>

<p>The error is to do with collation and the collation on the MySQL table is <code>latin1_swedish_ci</code> and the column that holds the ""foreign"" characters has <code>utf8_unicode_ci</code> collation on it and is a <code>varchar(255)</code>.</p>

<p>The recipient table in MSSQL uses the database default collation (<code>Latin1_General_CI_AS</code>) and the recipient column is a <code>nvarchar(255)</code>.</p>

<p>In SSMA the <em>charset mapping</em> for <code>latin1</code> is set to the default of <code>CHAR/VARCHAR</code> and I have tried having this set to <code>NCHAR/NVARCHAR</code> with no success. The <em>type mapping</em> for <code>varchar</code> is set to <code>nvarchar</code> for all instances.</p>

<p>The only thing close to an answer that I have found is <a href=""https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/528e7363-fbba-4d0d-b2da-a326bf12e181/ssma-from-mysql-error-22018?forum=sqlservermigration"" rel=""nofollow"">this posting</a>.

<p>The function GetData is like this, and because it is within cshtml then it is defined as a @Helper function</p>

<pre><code>       @helper GetData(int interval)
       {
           var xdata = Model.Select(model =&gt; model.Id).Take(10).ToList();
       }
</code></pre>

<p>The ajax call is throwing an exception (Exception [object Object]). My main suspects for this not working are 1) my ""data"" format and 2) the ""url"" being correct.</p>

<p>I am not restricted to only considering ajax, I am open to any method which can call a function and pass variables from Javascript/Jquery to @Helper functions within .cshtml (if indeed this is the best method), maybe I should be using the .cs files more i.e. controllers?</p>

<p>Any help and direction would be much appreciated.</p>

I am looking for the simplest way of doing this in Tapestry 5.</p>

<p>Firstly, lets define some utility classes e.g.</p>

<pre><code>public class ModelObject {
  private URI uri;
  private boolean modified;
  // the usual constructors, getters and setters ...
}

public class Literal&lt;T&gt; extends ModelObject {
  private Class&lt;?&gt; valueClass;
  private T value;
  public Literal(Class&lt;?&gt; valueClass) {
    this.valueClass = valueClass;
  }
  public Literal(Class&lt;?&gt; valueClass, T value) {
    this.valueClass = valueClass;
    this.value = value;
  }
  // the usual getters and setters ...
}

public class Link&lt;T extends ModelObject&gt; extends ModelObject {
  private Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass;
  private T target;
  public Link(Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass) {
    this.targetClass = targetClass;
  }
  public Link(Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass, T target) {
    this.targetClass = targetClass;
    this.target = target;
  }
  // the usual getters and setters ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can create some fairly complex data structures, for example:</p>

<pre><code>public class HumanBeing extends ModelObject {
  private Literal&lt;String&gt; name;
  // ... other stuff
  public HumanBeing() {
    name = new Literal&lt;String&gt;(String.class);
  }
  // the usual getters and setters ...
}

public class Project extends ModelObject {
  private Literal&lt;String&gt; projectName;
  private Literal&lt;Date&gt; startDate;
  private Literal&lt;Date&gt; endDate;
  private Literal&lt;Integer&gt; someCounter;
  private Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt; projectLeader;
  private Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt; projectManager;
  // ... other stuff, including lists of things, that may be Literals or
  // Links ... e.g. (ModelObjectList is an enhanced ArrayList that remembers
  // the type(s) of the objects it contains - to get around type erasure ...
  private ModelObjectList&lt;Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt;&gt; projectMembers;
  private ModelObjectList&lt;Link&lt;Project&gt;&gt; relatedProjects;
  private ModelObjectList&lt;Literal&lt;String&gt;&gt; projectAliases;
  // the usual constructors, getters and setters for all of the above ...
  public Project() {
    projectName = new Literal&lt;String&gt;(String.class);
    startDate = new Literal&lt;Date&gt;(Date.class);
    endDate = new Literal&lt;Date&gt;(Date.class);
    someCounter = new Literal&lt;Integer&gt;(Integer.class);
    projectLeader = new Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt;(HumanBeing.class);
    projectManager = new Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt;(HumanBeing.class);
    projectMembers = new ModelObjectList&lt;Link&lt;HumanBeing&gt;&gt;(Link.class, HumanBeing.class);
    // ... more ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you point <code>beaneditform</code> at an instance of Project.class, you will not get very far before you have to supply a lot of custom coercers, translators, valueencoders, etc - and then you still run into the problem that you can't use generics when ""contributing"" said coercers, translators, valueencoders, etc.</p>

<p>I then started writing my own components to get around these problems (e.g. <code>ModelObjectDisplay</code> and <code>ModelObjectEdit</code>) but this would require me to understand a lot more of the guts of Tapestry than I have time to learn ... it feels like I might be able to do what I want using the standard components and liberal use of ""delegate"" etc. Can anyone see a simple path for me to take with this?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far.</p>

<p>PS: if you are wondering why I have done things like this, it is because the model represents linked data from an RDF graph database (aka triple-store) - I need to remember the URI of every bit of data and how it relates (links) to other bits of data (you are welcome to suggest better ways of doing this too :-)</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>@uklance suggested using display and edit blocks - here is what I had already tried:</p>

<p>Firstly, I had the following in AppPropertyDisplayBlocks.tml ...</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;t:block id=""literal""&gt;
        &lt;t:delegate to=""literalType"" t:value=""literalValue"" /&gt;
    &lt;/t:block&gt;

    &lt;t:block id=""link""&gt;
        &lt;t:delegate to=""linkType"" t:value=""linkValue"" /&gt;
    &lt;/t:block&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and in AppPropertyDisplayBlocks.java ...</p>

<pre><code>    public Block getLiteralType() {
        Literal&lt;?&gt; literal = (Literal&lt;?&gt;) context.getPropertyValue();

        Class&lt;?&gt; valueClass = literal.getValueClass();
        if (!AppModule.modelTypes.containsKey(valueClass))
            return null;

        String blockId = AppModule.modelTypes.get(valueClass);
        return resources.getBlock(blockId);
    }

    public Object getLiteralValue() {
        Literal&lt;?&gt; literal = (Literal&lt;?&gt;) context.getPropertyValue();
        return literal.getValue();
    }

    public Block getLinkType() {
        Link&lt;?&gt; link = (Link&lt;?&gt;) context.getPropertyValue();

        Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass = link.getTargetClass();
        if (!AppModule.modelTypes.containsKey(targetClass))
            return null;

        String blockId = AppModule.modelTypes.get(targetClass);
        return resources.getBlock(blockId);
    }

    public Object getLinkValue() {
        Link&lt;?&gt; link = (Link&lt;?&gt;) context.getPropertyValue();
        return link.getTarget();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>AppModule.modelTypes is a map from java class to a String to be used by Tapestry e.g. Link.class -> ""link"" and Literal.class -> ""literal"" ... in AppModule I had the following code ...</p>

<pre><code>    public static void contributeDefaultDataTypeAnalyzer(
            MappedConfiguration&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;, String&gt; configuration) {
        for (Class&lt;?&gt; type : modelTypes.keySet()) {
            String name = modelTypes.get(type);
            configuration.add(type, name);
        }
    }

    public static void contributeBeanBlockSource(
            Configuration&lt;BeanBlockContribution&gt; configuration) {

        // using HashSet removes duplicates ...
        for (String name : new HashSet&lt;String&gt;(modelTypes.values())) {
            configuration.add(new DisplayBlockContribution(name,
                    ""blocks/AppPropertyDisplayBlocks"", name));
            configuration.add(new EditBlockContribution(name,
                    ""blocks/AppPropertyEditBlocks"", name));
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I had similar code for the edit blocks ... however none of this seemed to work - I think because the original object was passed to the ""delegate"" rather than the de-referenced object which was either the value stored in the literal or the object the link pointed to (hmm... should be [Ll]inkTarget in the above, not [Ll]inkValue). I also kept running into errors where Tapestry couldn't find a suitable ""translator"", ""valueencoder"" or ""coercer"" ... I am under some time pressure so it is difficult to follow these twisty passages through in order to get out of the maze :-)</p>

<p>My problem now is that the <strong>handleMatchEnded:</strong> method is never called... The weird thing is that this method is part of the same delegate protocol as <strong>handleTurnEventForMatch:didBecomeActive:</strong> which actually works.</p>

<p>Any idea is welcome.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 03/17:</strong>
As my first player quitted is turn, and the second one end the match, I think the two players are not going to receive the event. This event is probably made for other players in game, or when players are not within the app when the others leave. Didn't find anything related in the documentation, but it seem's logical.</p>

Even better if it is based off of boost::asio since my company already has these libraries checked into the code base. I have found 2 so far online: WebSocket++ and libwebsockets</p>

<p>WebSocket++: Seems like what I am looking for but I do not have a lot of confidence in it when the author says ""The latest version, 0.3.x, is relatively stable and nearing its first beta release."" I understand that it is still in development but I am looking for a solution that can safely be put into a production environment.</p>

<p>libwebsockets: Seems like a good solution but it is written in C. I would have to create a C++ wrapper around this library in order to use it in our code.</p>

<p>The rest of the libraries I read about are too bulky and would require bringing in a ton of other unnecessary code (i.e. it is part of a larger framework).</p>

<p>Then I read about the possibility of just implementing WebSockets myself. It could be based off of boost::asio. While I am little bit familiar with TCP/IP programming, I am not familiar with WebSockets at all. But if it is the only solution left then maybe that's what I will have to do.</p>

Now, we want the function to print that nth number. As the same function is being called repeatedly, there has to be a condition that allows only the root call to print. The question is: how to write this condition without passing any additional arguments, or using global/static variables.</p>

<p>So, we're dealing with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int fib(int n) {
    if(n &lt;= 0) return 0;
    int fn = 1;
    if(n &gt; 2) fn = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1);
    if(???) cout &lt;&lt; fn &lt;&lt; endl;
    return fn;
}

int main() {
    fib(5);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that the root call differs from all children by returning to a different caller, namely the main method in this example. I wanted to know whether it is possible to use this property to write the condition and how.</p>

So this delay only happens when setting a new .ItemsSource. The datagrid has no custom styles/triggers/templates, so I cannot understand why rendering takes so long.

<p>In the reusable bundle I have a Folder, File a that belongs to the folder and and interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Acme\FolderBundle\Entity;

class Folder implements FolderInterface
{

}

namespace Acme\FolderBundle\Entity;

interface FolderInterface
{
    // no methods here
}

namespace Acme\FolderBundle\Entity;
/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class File
{
    // Belongs to one folder
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on the other bundle just one class:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Acme\NewBundle\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Acme\FolderBundle\Entity\Folder as BaseFolder;
use Acme\FolderBundle\Entity\FolderInterface;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity

class Folder extends BaseFolder implements FolderInterface
{
    // Has many files
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the config.yml's ORM configuration:</p>

<pre><code>orm:
    auto_generate_proxy_classes: %kernel.debug%
    auto_mapping: true
    resolve_target_entities:
        Acme\FolderBundle\Entity\FolderInterface: Acme\NewBundle\Entity\Folder

<pre><code>[Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\SchemaException]                                 
The table with name 'foldersDatabase.folder' already exists.
</code></pre>

<p>To get this working, I have to explicitly change one of the Folder's Entities table:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Acme\FolderBundle\Entity;
/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name=""distributed_folder"")

class Folder implements FolderInterface

The system works in linear fashion - an external party calls A, which publishes a message on a queue that B consumes. The format of the output is fixed, say AResult. B reads AResult, does some processing and publishes BResult to service C, etc.</p>

<p>The problem I'm running into now is that services down the pipeline need data not supplied by the previous step. E.g. service F needs properties from BResult.</p>

<p>I've considered a few alternatives, but they all have shortcomings:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pass a dictionary of all previous results along. That way say F will
be able to read AResult, BResult, etc. The problem is this will
introduce high coupling, any change anywhere can break other
services.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a global God object that different services populate. I've done something similar before and it ended very complex.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain a special object of the most useful data and pass it along each result. E.g. D receives CResult and GlobalContextData and publishes DResult and GlobalContextData. The problem is deciding to include in the context and maintaining it.</p></li>

<p>In this case, I can get the line as:</p>

<pre><code>Chairman Microsoft

Chariman Borbis

Bill&amp;Melinda Gates Fundation

Director Berkshire Hathaway

CEO Cascade Investment
</code></pre>

<p>Compared with the original text I want, they basically missed ""of"", also some other texts.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that ""preceding-sibling"" only return the sibling tags, but can't return the ""text"" which belongs to its parent, such as ""of"" in this case.</p>

<p>Anyone here know how to extract the complete information separated by <code>br</code> tag?</p>

The page would just be for posting non-confidential information, such as private-member events, and scheduling.  I know the basics of PHP, and would like to use that, but I'm concerned about safety.  The page will have multiple users, but it only needs one password which would be used by all the users.  It's also a fairly low-traffic site, so for the situation it doesn't need to be 100% secure, but I would like it to be as secure as possible without too much hassle.</p>

<p>So far I have a login-page that comes up when the user tries to access the member-page, with a password input field, which posts the result to a page called (example name) verifypassword.php</p>

<p>This file looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$password = (""mypass"");

$passresult = $_POST[""password""];
$passresult = strip_tags($passresult);
$passresult = htmlspecialchars($passresult);

if ($passresult != $password) {
die(""Invalid password."");
}

elseif ($passresult == &amp;password) {
setcookie(""mycookie"");
header(""location: member-page.php"");
}

else {
die(""Unknown Error"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, at the top of the member page, I have some lines of PHP code as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$userloggedin = $_COOKIE[""mycookie""];

if (!isset ($userloggedin)) {
die(""Please log in to view this page"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The files and values themselves are hidden via the die function if the user isn't logged in, but the password and cookie are still being transferred across the server.
I've tried to read up on salting and hashing a password value, but unfamiliar with this kind of thing. How should I be doing this? Are there any tutorials or resources I can read?  I tried looking on Google, php.net, and of course here on stackoverflow, but I couldn't find anything that dealt with passwords other than creating a database to store multiple user-generated passwords, which isn't what I need.</p>

<p>I'm currently using WAMPP.</p>

<p>I've already seen this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8827871/a-multilineparagraph-footer-and-header-in-reportlab"">question</a> The answer given seems more or less the same as this <a href=""http://eric.sau.pe/tag/reportlab-header-footer/"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post</a>. Anyhow, the script shown is full of errors, but I don't want to vote it down, the OP accepted it, seemed to solve his problem, who am I to argue, I'd rather ask another question.</p>

<p>First of all you need to import </p>

<pre><code>from reportlab.pdfgen.canvas import Canvas
</code></pre>

<p>and it's not <code>canvas</code> it's <code>Canvas</code> and then you can't just do</p>

<p><code>Canvas.restoreState()</code> or  <code>Canvas.saveState()</code></p>

<p>Maybe there are more errors, I'd rather use another example. I spent the entire night yesterday trying to make that snippet work and couldn't.</p>

<p>Is there another method to create footer? A specific method I want to ask about is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei0fL6j8DtI"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, the guy do a for loop, on <code>row[0]</code> he writes something, <code>row[1]</code> something</p>

<p>I counted on a LibreOffice document, which is A4, using <code>Liberation Serif</code> 12, there are 49 rows. Assuming that on average there are 45 rows, depending on the font size, and the footer font size is 8, can't one just insert the footer like this <code>x=row[45]</code> and then increment x based on the page number? wouldn't that be a far easier solution?</p>

<p>If I can detect that the end of file, or the last line on which text is inserted, then I can do it, I think.</p>

<p>If you refer to my other question, you would notice that I convert powerpoint, excel and word to pdf and then insert a footer.</p>

<p>If there is a library that works on linux and windows covert powerpoint and excel to word, then add the footer then convert to pdf, it would be great, since I think it's easier to work with documents then PDFs</p>

I am using these fields in my table (Product_Name, Product_Type, Product_Price, Product_Image). I am able to get all of this info uploaded via PHP (I am storing the images in a folder and not in the database via BLOB). I can get it to display the first 3 columns (Name, Type, Price). I can't get it to display the image. I have read that I cannot display binary data as well as other field types because of the header declaration. I know how to do the thumbnail with PHP. I want the thumbnail to be clickable with a lightbox type deal showing the full size image.</p>

<p>I had a screenshot to show what I am trying to do, but I am not able to because I am new to this site.</p>

<p>I have found numerous tuts on how to upload files, how to display images from either a folder or a BLOB, but I have not found an answer to what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>Is it even possible through PHP to do a SELECT * from table and display all fields in a table, including a thumbnail which is clickable to display full size image.</p>

<li>Netbeans with dstepanov's Coffeescript plug-in</li>
<li>Aptana with the Coffeescript ruble</li>

<p>Further, I am aware of Jetbrain's WebStorm 3.x support for Coffeescript, unfortunately, my evaluation period expired before I realized I'd need this feature - can anyone confirm that setting the Javascript / Coffeescript Usage Scope works as expected with auto-complete?</p>

<pre><code>StringBuilder test = new StringBuilder(""test"");
StringBuilder test2;
StringBuilder test3;

<p>So I can append test3 and it will append the original test.</p>

<p>Using the same logical inference it should behave exactly the same way yet if I change test3 it has nothing to do with test which means when I do <code>test=test2</code> it is actually doing something like <code>test2=new test</code> and <code>test3 = new test2</code> this seems highly illogical to me. Suppose I wanted to make my own simple byte class one that behaves like StringBuilder and one that behaves like String what exactly in the StringBuilder class allows the instance to be passed and what in the String class allows it to automatically create a new instance just by using the equal sign? I don't understand how test=test2 is logically consistent between the 2 examples I gave. It actually looks unpredictably illogical to me. What line of code actually makes this difference between the 2 classes?</p>

<p>When you use an equal sign with an instance of StringBuilder it passes the instance but when you use an equal sign with an instance of String it magically creates a new instance. What line of code in the class determines how the equal sign behaves like this? I don't like this because it actually changes the meaning of the equal sign so I would like to know at least what piece of code changes the definition of the equal sign.</p>

I'd like to be able to send the direct message ""from"" the application via oAuth.

<p>When I check my DM's I basically get a DM from myself. Is that because the Twurl console uses your screenname when sending stuff from applications or because when calling the direct_message/new.xml you are sending a DM from your account which was authenticated with the test application in Twurl. In the end I'm looking to accomplish the same thing that spontwts does - notify you via DM when something happens on your account.

<p>The returned XML is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rs:data ItemCount=""896"" xmlns:rs=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:rowset""&gt;
&lt;z:row ows_A=""1"" ows_B=""2"" xmlns:z=""#RowsetSchema"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There's actually closer to 60+ attributes per row, and the problem is the returned attributes per ""row"" aren't consistent (e.g. some have 60, some have 67, some have 59, etc).</p>

<p>If I explicitly ask for the attributes by name, it's not a big deal:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (System.Xml.XmlNode listItem in nodeListItems)
            {
 if (listItem.Name == ""rs:data"")
                {
                  for (int i = 0; i &lt; listItem.ChildNodes.Count; i++)
                    {
                        if (listItem.ChildNodes[i].Name == ""z:row"")
                        {
                            wtSr.Append(listItem.ChildNodes[i].Attributes[""ows_Title""].Value);
                            wtSr.Append(""\t"");
</code></pre>

<p>etc, etc.</p>

<p>I tried parsing through all the attributes using something like </p>

<pre><code>for (int k = 0; k &lt; listItem.ChildNodes[i].Attributes.Count; k++)
 {
                                    tmpWtCol =                                          listItem.ChildNodes[i].Attributes[k].Name.ToString().Replace(""ows_"", string.Empty).Replace(""_"", string.Empty);
                                    wtSr.Append(tmpWtCol + ""\t"");


                                    wtDidHeaders = true;
                                }
</code></pre>

<p>to get the possible attributes, but I realized it would only pick up the first row, which may or may not have the maximum attributes possible. I thought about parsing through the entire thing. Though it's unlikely, I also have no real way of knowing if the ""biggest count"" row contains every combination. </p>

<p>Is there a more elegant solution to with ""null"" (missing) attributes and determining all the attributes to create an acceptable ""column list""?</p>

<p>Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate with Update 4 </p>

<p>Google Chrome Version 38.0.2125.111 m </p>

<p>Windows 7 Professional with 32-bit Operating System </p>

<p>Coded UITest Builder 11.0.60315.1</p>

<p>Microsoft Coded UITest Project is within the ASP.NET Web Application Solution.</p>

<p>We use the Microsoft Coded UITest Project to run Automated UI tests on the Web application.</p>

<p>At present, I have the ASP.NET Web application in one Visual Studio 2012 solution file, and 
the Microsoft Coded UI Test Project with Selenium in another Visual Studio 2012 solution file.</p>

<p>So far, if I wanted to run the Automated UI tests, I take the following steps:</p>

<p>a) Open up the ASP.NET Web Application solution file in one instance of Visual Studio 2012</p>

<p>b) Press ""F5"" to build and then run the application in a Web Browser</p>

<p>c) Open up the Microsoft Coded UITest Project solution file in another Visual Studio 2012</p>

<p>d) From the main menu, click on the ""Test"" in main menu</p>

<p>e) Click on the Run in the menu that shows up</p>

<p>f) Click on the All tests in the other menu that shows up</p>

<p>The above steps can be seen as time-consuming, and inefficient since I'm opening up two instances of Visual Studio in order to conduct my testing.  I needed to figure out a way to be more efficient with my automated tests.</p>

<p>I've added my Microsoft Coded UI Test Project with Selenium to the ASP.NET Web Application Solution.  Moreover, I made the following configuration change:</p>

<p>""Test -> Test Settings -> Run Test after Build in Visual Studio."" </p>

<p>However, Now, if I do a Build on the entire application, the Browser will open up, and give a ""This webpage is not available"" ( By the way, the reason for the said error makes sense because it when you do build solution, it will build the ASP.NET Web application and the Microsoft Coded UI module that was added, but it won't deploy the Web application to Visual Studio Development Server.  Therefore, when the build completes, it starts executing the Microsoft Coded UI test code which would initiate a browser to open up, but it will obviously give a ""This webpage is not available"" error because the Web application has Not been deployed to the Visual Studio Development Server. )</p>

<p>I'm trying to do the following steps:</p>

<p>1) Build the ASP.NET Web Application Solution </p>

<p>2) Deploy ASP.NET Web Application to Visual Studio Development server</p>

<p>3) Run the UI automated tests in the Microsoft Coded UITest Project</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to take on the aforementioned 3 steps by doing some configuration in Visual Studio with my ASP.NET WEb application? Or is there a way of doing this in MSBuild?  Efficiency and Less time-consuming steps are important otherwise conducting tests would be real waste of time.</p>

As a newbie just following the tutorial, its quite hard to see how to expand the <code>start_urls</code> into grabbing all the links on that page. I'm guessing there's some way built in, but can't decipher the documentation very well. At the moment it just visits that top page, realizes that no, indeed, it isn't one of the child pages and raises some exception.</p>

<p>The idea is to avoid as much as possible polling the server, so I thought to implement it with sockets and messages, and relying in some easy pulling solution in case a socket connection could not be done, (Firewalls, etc).
In the other hand is important that the data traveling get encrypted.</p>

<p>So I have a couple of question/""request for opinions"" more related with the WPF client:</p>

<ol>
<li>Perhaps already exist some solution for that, any tips?</li>
<li>Could be good to think in some SSL sockets connections for that?</li>
<li>If 2 is OK, there is some native solution for secure sockets in .net or any library?</li>
<li>If sockets solutions is an option, I guess i need to go through port 443 and by the way it will avoid many problems with firewalls and so on, am i right?</li>
</ol>

<p>I know there is many question but all are related to the same problem.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Each line has varying no of characters &amp; they are > 20. I want to read the 1st 20 characters &amp; if the word does not exist in those characters then I want to jump to the next line. Initially I had used <code>myFile.getline(read, 20, '\n');</code> But after the 1st loop every subsequent looping resulted in NULL being passed to read. So I made it to read 1000 because before reading 1000 chars it would find '\n' &amp; go to next line.
A better mechanism of achieving the same would be very helpful.</p>

However I fail to understand how this is an example of lazy loading.</p>

<p>The first time the application loads the page, he still does get 200 cars. I would expect (as I wanted to implement lazy loading this way in my app as well) that the first time the app loads this page, he only loads as many entries as there are rows on the first page, then when the user clicks on the second page the next x entries get loaded and so on.</p>

<p>As I have a potentially huge datatable (more than a million records) I obviously do not want to load a million records, and let the user wait 5 minutes, if he only needs something from the first 20 records.</p>

<p>EDIT: Even worse, when I use a spring backing bean which is viewscoped I noticed he loads all records every time the user switches to another page. I would even benefit from using a datatable without lazy loading this way.</p>

<p>I found, there are lots of naming conventions out there. I'm just wondering which one best suits for laravel eloquent models.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of following naming convention:</p>

<ol>
<li>Singular table names (ex: Post)</li>
<li>Singular column names (ex: userId - user id in the post table)</li>
<li>Camel casing for multiple words in table names (ex: PostComment, PostReview, PostPhoto)</li>
<li>Camel casing for multiple words in column names (ex: firstName, postCategoryId, postPhotoId)</li>
</ol>

<p>So with this, I could use similar syntax in the controller.</p>

<pre><code>$result = Post::where('postCategoryId', '4')-&gt;get();

<pre><code>class BaseProblem(Base, Slugged, Ownable, Tagged)

<p>Now a situation has so arisen that I need to make another abstract class which derives from all these classes and in that I have to write a save function that uses one of the field which is defined in the other abstract classes</p>

<pre><code>class Slugged(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
    title = models.CharField()
    slug = models.SlugField()

            # do something with slug field
</code></pre>

<p>But the issue is that when the save function for the XYZ class is executed, the slug field does not exist, because the slug field is not yet generated.</p>

<p>I am assuming the save function for abstract classes are being executed in alphabetical order that's why the slug field does not exist at the time the save function for <code>BaseProblem</code> is executed</p>

In addition to that, I would also like pre-compile client-side templates, i.e. compile them from markup to JavaScript. At a glance, I thought Rhino's serialize() method would do it but that does not seem to be the case.</p>

<pre><code>// Load templating engine
load( ""engine.js"" );

// Read template file
var template = readFile( ""foo.template"" ),

// Compile template
compiled = engine.compile( template );

// Write compiled template to file
serialize( compiled, ""compiledFoo.js"" );
</code></pre>

<p>This results in a binary file being written. What I want is a text file which contains the compiled template.</p>

<p>If using serialize() is not the answer, then what is? Since it's Rhino, it would be possible to import Java classes as well. Offhand, I can't figure out a way to do it.</p>

<p>I know this can be done in Node but I'm not in a position to migrate the build process from Ant-Rhino to Grunt-Node right now.</p>

<p>I have a trigger to handle the insert of a new record to a table. This trigger, as you will see below, inserts a record into another table, which in turns executes a trigger on that table, that calls a stored procedure (I tried to do it within the trigger itself, but it failed and was difficult to test where it was failing, so I moved it into its own little unit.) </p>

<p>Within the stored procedure, there is a call to extract information from the Active Directory database (ADSI) and update the newly inserted record. However, this is where it fails when called by the trigger. When I call it by simply executing it, and passing along the record to be updated, it works great... Can anyone point me in the right direction? Please!!!</p>

<p>I'm trying to do a spike to test the feasibility of interop between a C# project and an existing RubyGem rather than re-invent that particular wheel in .net. I've downloaded and installed IronRuby and the RubyGems package, as well as the gem I'd ultimately like to use. </p>

<p>Running .rb files or working in the iirb Ruby console is without problems.  I can load the both the RubyGems package, and the gem itself and use it, so, at least for that use case, my environment is set up correctly. </p>

<p>However, when I try to do the same sort of thing from within a C# (4.0) console app, it complains about the very first line:</p>

<pre><code>require 'RubyGems'
</code></pre>

<p>With the error: </p>

<pre><code> no such file to load -- rubygems
</code></pre>

<p>My Console app looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>using System;
using IronRuby;
namespace RubyInteropSpike
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var runtime = Ruby.CreateRuntime();

            var scope = runtime.ExecuteFile(""test.rb"");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Removing the dependencies and just doing some basic self-contained Ruby stuff works fine, but including any kind of 'requires' statement seems to cause it to fail. </p>

<p>I'm hoping that I just need to pass some additional information (paths, etc) to the ruby runtime when I create it, and really hoping that this isn't some kind of limitation, because that would make me sad. </p>

In order to achieve this (it seems to me: I am a beginning with OAuth workflows) I have to create a session logged in to Twitter through the web.</p>

<p>The application-only workflow is relatively easy to establish with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>consumer_key = API_key = ""app API key""
consumer_secret = API_secret = ""app API secret""
encoded_secrets = base64.b64encode(consumer_key+"":""+consumer_secret) # key &amp; secret should be URL-encoded
r =  requests.post(""https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/token"",
               headers={""authorization"": ""Basic ""+encoded_secrets },
               data={""grant_type"": ""client_credentials""})
</code></pre>

<p>This retrieves the bearer token that can be used to authenticate an application to Twitter without any user interaction. For example,</p>

<pre><code>access_data = json.loads(r.content)
bearer_auth_header = {""authorization"": ""Bearer ""+access_data['access_token']}
timeline_endpoint = ""https://api.twitter.com/1.1/trends/available.json""
response = requests.get(timeline_endpoint,
                              headers=bearer_auth_header)
</code></pre>

<p>This code works fine (and fails due to authentication failure when the headers are omitted).</p>

<p>When it comes to authorizing an application with a user's identity, however, things are more complex as an account identity has to be authenticated. The standard workflow is to bring up a link in the user's web browser that allows them to authorize the application to access their details through the web (by clicking on a button and submitting a form.</p>

<p>The issue comes when trying to automate this login using a request from a program rather than a web browser. My current attempt looks like this.</p>

<pre><code># access the Twitter login page to receive a '_twitter_sess' session cookie.
twit_response = requests.get(""https://twitter.com/login"")
# Submit sign-on form through the web
TW_ID = ""username""
TW_PW = ""password""
login_data = {
              ""session[username_or_email]"": TW_ID,
              ""session[password]"": TW_PW,
              ""return_to_ssl"": True,
              ""scribe_log"": """",
              ""redirect_after_login"": ""http://holdenweb.com/contact"",
              ""force_login"": True
}
login_response = requests.post(""https://twitter.com/sessions"",
                               data=login_data, 
                               cookies=twit_response.cookies,
                               headers={""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 ""
                                        ""(Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:24.0) ""
                                        ""Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0""})
</code></pre>

<p>This fails (though because this is not web authentication it receives a 200 response). I also observe that despite the <code>cookies=twit_response.cookies</code> argument to <code>requests.post()</code> the request did not seem to include the session cookie and the User-Agent header is still incorrect. However, I am unsure whether this is the cause of the failure, so I only mention this in case it's relevant.</p>

<pre><code>trrh = twit_response.request.headers
for header in trrh:
    print ""%s: %s"" % (header, trrh[header])
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress
Accept: */*
User-Agent: python-requests/2.2.1 CPython/2.7.2 Darwin/12.5.0

<p>Can anyone help me make progress, please, it's getting to the stage where I feel I am overlooking some fundamental and possibly quite simple mistake(s).</p>

<pre><code>public class Stuff {

    [Range(0, Double.PositiveInfinity)]
    public double? SomeProp { get; set; }

}
</code></pre>

<p>(and some infrastructure defined at the bottom of the post) a request with a payload such as <code>{ someProp: ""1.2"" }</code> will model bind correctly - and negative or missing values will give errors - but if I enter something that isn't a valid number (e.g. <code>{ someProp: ""hello"" }</code>) the model state has an error such as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error converting value ""hello"" to type 'System.Nullable`1[System.Double]'. Path 'someStuff', line 1, position 41.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I guess the position is in the JSON object, here cut from a larger request, so don't mind the exact numbers...). For another property, which isn't nullable but instead has a <code>[Required]</code> attribute, the error message about a missing required property is included in the model state dict <strong>in addition to</strong> the above message.</p>

<p>I do understand why <code>""hello""</code> cannot be bound to a <code>double?</code> (or <code>double</code>), but regardless of constraints I set in attributes, it seems that the value has to be model bound before they are even checked, and if model binding fails I both get that not-so-friendly message above, as well as all other errors that apply when the value is unset. The only constraint I've been able to apply <em>before</em> attempting to bind the value is a Regex, but if that fails I get a similarly user-unfriendly message like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The field SomeProp must match the regular expression '&lt;my regex>'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a way to work around this, so that I can give the user a better error message when entering something non-numeric into a textbox that should specify a numeric value?</p>

I figured I should check if its null to see if the space is empty or if it has been deleted. The <code>del.compare</code> is to check if the first name string has been replaced by <code>""DEL""</code>, which is how I mark the elements that have been deleted and ready to be rewritten.</p>

<p>I'm getting an error:</p>

<p><code>error: no match for ‘operator!=’ in ‘(((Student*)this)-&gt;Student::studentList + ((unsigned int)(((unsigned int)((Student*)this)-&gt;Student::key) * 20u)))-&gt;Student::studentEntry::FIRST != 0’</code></p>

<p>For this line:</p>

<p><code>if(studentList[key].FIRST != NULL || del.compare(studentList[key].FIRST) != 0)</code></p>

<p>What's wrong with using <code>!=</code> in this instance?</p>

<p>edit about <code>del.compare</code>:</p>

<p>I'm just using the string library compare, in this case <code>del</code> is initialized in the function:</p>

<p><code>string del(""DEL"");</code> </p>

<p>and <code>studentList[key].FIRST</code> corresponds to a pointer to a struct of strings, initialized to <code>10</code>.  <code>studentList[0].FIRST</code> should be the first name of the first entry in the array of <code>10</code>, and it should be empty.  </p>

<p>Here's how I declared it in a constructor:</p>

<p><code>studentList = new studentEntry[10];</code></p>

<p>edit about <code>FIRST</code>:</p>

<p><code>FIRST</code> is declared in the <code>Students</code> class inside the <code>studentEntry</code> struct.  That part looks like:</p>

<pre><code>class Student
{
    private:    
        struct studentEntry
        {
            string FIRST; 
        };
        studentEntry *studentList;
        int key;
        int index;

    public:
        void add(string &amp;firstname);
        Student();
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is the constructor for the <code>Student</code> class, which might also be relevant:</p>

<pre><code>Student::Student()
{
    studentList = new studentEntry[10];
    key = 0;
    index = 0;  
}
</code></pre>

<p>edit about <code>add</code>:</p>

<p>Here is the <code>add</code> function where the compare is made that is causing the error:</p>

<pre><code>void Student::add(string &amp;firstname)
{       
    string del(""DEL"");

    //find key to know which bucket to use
    key = index % 10;

    //check if spot in studentList is empty or has been removed
    if(studentList[key].FIRST != NULL || del.compare(studentList[key].FIRST) != 0)
    {
        //do stuff

<p>I have a universal app. The iPad version supports only landscape and the iPhone version supports only portrait. </p>

<p>When a user opens the iPad version, it opens in landscape mode, which is expected. However, every control on the right side of the view is unresponsive to user touch events. The affected area is 256 wide, and the area on the left that 'works' is 768 wide (portrait width). Therefore, even though the app opens in landscape, the app thinks it's in portrait. Since the phone version only supports portrait, the issue doesn't reveal itself there, though I believe the issue is not device specific, however, the issue only affects devices running iOS8.</p>

<p>The app was originally developed for iOS4 and has gone through several iterations since. However, much of the original code and nibs are still in use. Other orientation issues have shown up with iOS8 and could be related, or not, who knows? </p>

<p>Since the app was originally designed for iOS4, storyboards were not used, and still aren't. I have checked some things: made sure all nibs have <em>'Auto resize subviews'</em> checked, and made sure that only landscape orientations existed in the app plist (verified in XML). Here is a code snippet from AppDelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController;
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    [self.window setFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];

    self.viewController = [[AppMainViewController alloc] initWithNibName:nib bundle:nil];

<p>In the image, I'm showing both portrait and landscape sizes. As I mentioned earlier, the view controller renders and looks as it should in landscape, but anything in the red area of the image is unresponsive to user taps.</p>

<p>Perhaps I've looked at this issue too long and hopefully somebody has some insight on why this is happening. Anyone? Thanks!</p>

    if (callback != null)
    {

"14923645","1","14926637","","2013-02-17 17:05:33","","1","748","<p>In a ASP.NET Masterpage I am using YepNope to unconditionally and asynchronously load jQuery (from the Google CDN, with local fallback) and some scripts which are used on all pages in the site. In the MasterPage I have created a ContentPlaceHolder before the closing body tag (and below the YepNope script that loads those used on all pages) which is used for scripts used on individual page. As jQuery should be available on every page in the site it should not be loaded individually on those pages where there are specific scripts that use it. </p>

<p>The problem I have is that I can't use the callback or complete functions in the yepnope script where jQuery is loaded, as this is on the MasterPage and these are individual page scripts which are only used or added on that page, yet I need to be able to delay the execution of the individual page scripts until yepnope (which appears above the page scripts) has finished loading any dependencies (such as jQuery) used in them.</p>

<p>I can think of two options-</p>

<p>1- Make the script used on the page an external file and load that using the syntax -</p>

<pre><code>yepnope('/url/to/your/script.js'); 
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>yepnope({ load: '/url/to/your/script.js' });
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure I like this idea as it introduces an extra HTTP request for a few lines of javascript which isn't going to be used on any other page.</p>

<p>2- Load jQuery again in another yepnope test object block, with the complete function wrapping up the page scripts (calling complete without a test seems to execute the function immediately, before the previous scripts are loaded) and relying on the following-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am requesting a file twice and it's only loading once? By popular
  demand, in yepnope 1.5+ we added the feature that scripts that have
  already been requested not be re-executed when they are requested a
  second time. This can be helpful when you are dealing with less
  complex serverside templating system and all you really care about is
  that all of your dependencies are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the page I could presumably load the same version of jQuery from the Google CDN, which based on the above would not actually be loaded twice, and then load the page scripts in an anonymous function called from the complete function of the yepnope test object.</p>

<p>On the plus side this would mean that the page is no longer dependent on jQuery being loaded from the MasterPage, but a negative would be that (even assuming YepNope does not load the script twice now) we would be loading multiple versions of jQuery should the version in the MasterPage be changed without the same happening in the page in the future. From a maintenance point of view I don't feel this is a good idea, especially on the assumption (which I feel you should always make) that another developer would be the one making the changes.</p>

<p>It also does not seem especially elegant.</p>

<p>On balance I will almost certainly use the first option but I would like to know if there is a way to delay or defer scripts on a page until asynchronous loading is completed, and this cannot be done as part of the YepNope test object loading the resources.</p>

<p>How do other developers approach this problem?</p>

Anyway, my goal is to make it 100% flash-free, so I've been reading a lot about HTML5 and, in particular, the Web Audio API (<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Audio-API-Boris-Smus/dp/1449332684/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372005204&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=web%20audio%20api"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""this"">this</a> book helped a lot, btw).</p>

<p>To record audio from the user's microphone, using getUserMedia(), I made a custom version of <a href=""https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs"" rel=""nofollow"">RecorderJS</a>. In a nutshell, I'm routing the output from getUserMedia() to a ScriptProcessorNode which, every 4096 samples, writes the contents of the inputBuffer to an array that is later exported to a PCM WAV file. So far, it works fine.</p>

<p>The problem is that the start of the recording procedure involves two things: playing all the previously recorded tracks, so the musician has a reference to play on top of, and starting the actual recording (writing the buffer to the array, that is).</p>

<p>Although there is no audible latency or delay from the sound of the microphone when the user is recording, when the recording ends and all the tracks are played, the newly recorded track has a slight delay.</p>

<p>What can be causing this? What are the possible solutions?</p>

<p>I thought I could find the time difference between both events by also sending the playback to the same processor node and then find out when do they actually begin, to compensate any delay.
For this, I would need to have the ScriptProcessorNode receiving, for example, getUserMedia stuff on channels 1 and 2, and playback on channels 3 and 4, but I can't make this work.
I tried routing both sources to the processor node and I also tried with a Merger/Splitter, but nothing seems to work. They all reach the processor node on channels 1 and 2, while 3 and 4 come empty.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is off-topic or doesn't contain actual code (which I am more than happy to provide if necessary), but there is not much stuff done on this area and so any ideas would be very welcome.</p>

<p>and my markdown file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>title: ""Liquidity Report""

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

<p>It seems like Markdown is not recognizing the parameters even though I'm following the steps of the tutorial. Has anyone been able to successfully use parameters in R Markdown?</p>

<p>Also, I'm following the recommendations of the tutorial and am using the R Studio preview as well as the latest builds of r markdown and knitr.</p>

<p>I find that understanding how a given software language is compiled can be key to understanding best practices and getting the most out of that language.  This seems to be doubly true with C++. Is there a good primer or document (for mortals) that describes C++ from the point of view of the compiler?  (Obviously every compiler is a little different.)</p>

<p>I thought there may be something along those lines in the beginning of Stroustrup's book.</p>

here is my problem, I'm confused about Synchronization among client-server-client.
let me explain:
               <br><br> let's suppose client(1) shot client(2) at time t1, and client(2) position was c2. client(1) send this information to server, now here is problem before server process information and update game state, client(2) change his/her position from c2 to c3 (let suppose take cover where client(2) is safe). But when server update game state, client(2) still got shot.
              <br><br> From client(1)'s end,, this shot was right. but from client(2)'s end that was wrong because he/she already has taken cover.

<p>here sample code.</p>

<pre><code>Vector vector;
Vector&lt;Vector&gt; vector_content;
table = new javax.swing.JTable();

table.setModel(new DefaultTableModel(vector_content,vector){

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

        return false;
    }

<p>now i have click event like this where m adding data into the Header table of content.</p>

<pre><code>            vector = new Vector();

<p>data is added to the Vector i can print data but some how its not set to the table how can i make it?</p>

<pre><code>&gt; nc 127.0.0.1 8080
hello
hi how are you?
</code></pre>

<p>I want to automatize the interaction with this service in order to perform some attack e.g. format string. So I create a Python script and that was really painful to make it work. Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>    t = Telnet(HOST, PORT)
    t.write('2\n')
    for _ in xrange(10)): print(t.read_some())
    t.write('3\n')
    for _ in xrange(12)): print(t.read_some())
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is the response from the service. The behavior I was expecting from this script was the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Send request for example ""hello""</li>
<li>Get the response: ""hi how are you?""</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case the service is quite simple but suppose I have a service that prints a menu of options or a welcome screen, I had to read all this stuff and manually find the response to the command I sent (using the for _ in xrange ...).</p>

<p>To summarize: what's the best way to interact with such service by taking into account ONLY the response of an input command?</p>

<p><em>I don't know if python is right for this things. I tried using sockets but it was even worse than telnet because of the function recv</em> </p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/amvvkm9z/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/amvvkm9z/</a></p>

<p>Pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>var scene = $('#scene');

scene.imagesLoaded(function() {
  var circularMovement = [
    [0,0],
    [0.5,0],
    [1,0],
    [1,0.5],
    [1,1],
    [0.5,1],
    [0,1],
    [0,0.5]
  ];

  // Initiate Parallax

  scene.parallax({
    originX: 0,
    originY: 1
  });

  circularMovement.each(function() {
    scene.parallax('origin', N, N);
  });

  scene.masonry({

<p>As far as I can tell, nothing had changed in the build settings that would have triggered this.</p>

<p>Here is what I have tried, unsuccessfully, while attempting to debug this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reverting to a previous commit of my project that had previously compiled ok.</li>
<li>Checking out a fresh copy of Pixelwave.</li>
<li>Reverting to the first commit of my project that had previously compiled ok.</li>
<li>Deleting the DerivedData subdirectory for the project.</li>
<li>Restarting Xcode.</li>
<li>Rebooting.</li>
<li>Uninstalling and reinstalling dev tools (I was getting desperate).</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this has helped—I still encountered the same errors every time. I am at my wits’ end as to what is causing this behaviour. I don’t even know where to start looking.</p>

<p>I have looked up almost all the posts on Stackoverflow (would be quite surprising for me if this post turns out to be a duplicate), and found this fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/cpatik/3QAeC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/cpatik/3QAeC/</a></p>

<p>Its <code>getSelectionBegin</code> code was:</p>

<pre><code>function getSelectionBegin(element) {
    var caretOffset = 0;
    if (w3) {
    }
    else if (ie) {
        var textRange = document.selection.createRange();

        preCaretTextRange.moveToElementText(element);

<p>Notice the <code>w3</code> part (which I require) is blank. Seemed to me like there's no method for getting selectionStart, but I assume someone might have developed a hack to get round this. </p>

<p>The problem is that I need to add one checkbox on each node (low and high level). I have been looking for a solution and the best one is using HierarchicalDataTemplate. But I never found a example with fixed and dynamic nodes at same time. I tried with several examples but I couldn't solve it.</p>

<p>Can you help me on this?</p>

  <p>This topic provides an overview of the

  compile database objects using the
  Microsoft SQL Server integration with
  the Microsoft .NET Framework common
  language runtime (CLR). The topic also
  shows you how to write, compile, and
  run a simple CLR stored procedure
  written in Microsoft Visual C#.</p>
  
  <p>CLR integration functionality is
  exposed in an assembly called
  system.data.dll, which is part of the
  .NET Framework. This assembly can be
  found in the Global Assembly Cache
  (GAC) as well as in the .NET Framework
  directory. A reference to this
  assembly is typically added
  automatically by both command line
  tools and Microsoft Visual Studio, so
  there is no need to add it manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After create, (compiling it and add to path dll's) you can use that code as a Stored Procedure like:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE ASSEMBLY helloworld from 'c:\helloworld.dll' WITH PERMISSION_SET = SAFE
</code></pre>

<p>Once the assembly has been created, we can now access our HelloWorld method by using the create procedure statement. We will call our stored procedure ""hello"":</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE hello
AS
EXTERNAL NAME helloworld.HelloWorldProc.HelloWorld
</code></pre>

<p>Once the procedure has been created, it can be run just like a normal stored procedure written in Transact-SQL. Execute the following command:</p>

<pre><code>EXEC hello
</code></pre>

<p>To drop that proc:</p>

<pre><code>drop procedure hello
</code></pre>

<p>Once the procedure has been dropped, you can remove the assembly containing your sample code.</p>

<pre><code>drop assembly helloworld
</code></pre>

<p><strong>After this introduction:</strong></p>

<p>I need to use a C++ code that also uses an extern dll, and my question is the following,</p>

<p>How could I use my C++ code (that also uses extern dll) inside that C# like in the example, so, after creating assembly at the moment I exec the stored proc, the following is transparant:</p>

<ol>
<li>SQL creates the assembly and then calls the C# code inside a dll.</li>
<li>C# code calls C++ code (inside a dll)</li>
<li>The C++ code calls extern dll. </li>
</ol>

<p>So I only do </p>

<p><strong>EXEC hello</strong></p>

<p>and all that happens (SQL SERVER -> C# -> C++ -> extern dll).</p>

<ul>
<li>How to make all this dll party go on and coexist, so I only execute a Stored proc in SQL Server like

<p>any ideas how to speed this up? it seems that basically echoing (or however readfile does it) the full cache in one go takes longer than just generating the page on the fly.</p>

<p>ps the file size of the cache file is approx 41 kilobytes. i've fully tested to make sure it is the loading tof the large file that is the problem. doing a readfile($smallfile); is fast. its only slow when outputing the cache file when the cache file is large</p>

<p>edit - also i am using this script on another site, with a much smaller cache file (pretty basic page) and it deff speeds it up. the large cache file is required because it has a lot of data on the page, so i cant get it down from 40kb.</p>

That program logs events out to a file <code>worker_log</code>. It is simple enough to configure this in the <code>supervisord.conf</code> I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisord/worker_log;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'd like for the events being written to the log to timestamp themselves. I don't have control over the php program, so decorating it's log is not an option. I figured that what I would do is comment out the above logging configuration and decorate the program via command-line pipes in supervisor's command configuration:</p>

<pre><code>command=php /www/myapp/worker.php 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed ""s/^/`date` /"" &gt; /var/log/supervisord/worker_log;
</code></pre>

<p>When running this command manually it seems to work fine. However, supervisord seems to somehow prevent it from properly functioning, and I'm unable to tell how. <code>worker.php</code> performs fine, but it's reporting is, in this configuration, suppressed. And, because of that, it of course does not add the timestamp.</p>

<p>Does anyone know enough about this to provide guidance on how to accomplish the goal of timestamping the worker's output?</p>

<p>Given that per web app there is only one instance of DelegatingFilterProxy (per <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> declaration, of course ) I have to assume that under high load a lot of worker threads are trying to call the <code>doFilter()</code> method in parallel. </p>

<p>Now have a look at the code:</p>

<pre><code>public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)
        throws ServletException, IOException {

    // Lazily initialize the delegate if necessary.
    Filter delegateToUse = null;
    synchronized (this.delegateMonitor) {
        if (this.delegate == null) {
            WebApplicationContext wac = findWebApplicationContext();
            if (wac == null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(""No WebApplicationContext found: no ContextLoaderListener registered?"");
            }
            this.delegate = initDelegate(wac);
        }
        delegateToUse = this.delegate;
    }

    // Let the delegate perform the actual doFilter operation.
    invokeDelegate(delegateToUse, request, response, filterChain);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>synchronized (this.delegateMonitor)</code> block must be passed by all threads which means that all workers are forced to queue up patiently until they are allowed to enter.</p>

<p>Regardless of why the bean lookup needed to be done here I suspect that the use of <code>synchronized</code>could have been avoided in favour of parallel execution - may be by making <code>this.delegate</code> volatile and use synchronization only in case of lookup needs to be done.</p>

<p>So am I barking up the wrong tree ? Any input is appreciated.</p>

<p>It looks like lock in share mode can be acquired by two different transactions as long as the row being modified has not been updated. This sucks in the following scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>t1 begin</li>
<li>t1 read lock on X </li>
<li>t2 begin </li>
<li>t2 read lock on X </li>
<li>t2 check if X.foo == 0 </li>
<li>t1 update X.foo = 1 </li>
<li>t1 end </li>
<li>t2 continue with bad logic since X.foo != 0</li>
</ul>

<p>The alternative I could use is lock for update, but that is too restrictive for my application because I don't care if my users read values that are 10 seconds old. So I never want to use lock for update. </p>

<p>QUESTION: Is there a lock I can use which:</p>

<ol>
<li>is exclusive</li>
<li>allows reads on the row without getting the lock </li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>t1 my_lock row X</li>
<li>t2 my_lock row X => NOT ALLOWED</li>
<li>t3 select row X => ALLOWED, returning the latest committed data like lock in share mode</li>
</ul>

But after that it came to my mind that on some level it might be difficult, so please resolve my doubts!</p>

<p>Every <code>UITableViewCell</code> has different style (some are <strong>custom</strong>, some are <strong>basic</strong> and few are <strong>right-detailed</strong> etc.).<br>
What is more, content size of each cell may vary as I have long names put inside labels so they use autolayout to fit.  </p>

<p>There is no problem when I have the same cells repeating but with different tex inside <code>UILabel</code>s. In that case I use a simple:</p>

<pre><code>- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    if (!self.prototypeCell) {
        self.prototypeCell = [self.tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@""ActivityCell""];
    }

    [self fetchedResultsController:[self fetchedResultsController] configureCell:self.prototypeCell atIndexPath:indexPath];

    CGSize size = [self.prototypeCell.contentView systemLayoutSizeFittingSize:UILayoutFittingCompressedSize];

    return size.height;
} 
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I don't know how to deal with <code>heightForRowAtIndexPath</code>. I can give an identifier to each cell, call <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code>, and make a big switch or if statement, but is it right? The same problem occurs while I think of <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> and populating those <code>UITableViewCells</code>. With those testing statements this code won't be pretty and readable.</p>

The response was received from my <a href=""http://www.ssocircle.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">SSOCircle</a> test Identity Provider (see below for complete SAML Response) and appears to be a standard <code>samlp</code> response which contains an Assertion that has been correctly signed using an xml digital signature.</p>

<p>Here is the code I am using. This has been taken from the xmlcrypto help on github.</p>

<p><strong>CoffeeScript</strong></p>

<pre><code>validateSignature: (saml) -&gt;
    doc = new @xmldom.DOMParser().parseFromString saml
    signature = @xmlCrypto.xpath(doc, ""/*/*[local-name(.)='Signature' and namespace-uri(.)='http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#']"")[0]
    signed = new @xmlCrypto.SignedXml null, idAttribute: 'AssertionID'
    signed.loadSignature signature.toString() # this line fails as signature is undefined
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the code above uses the <code>xmlCrypto.xpath()</code> function to retrieve the <code>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</code> element from the parsed xml document, however the result of this function is always <code>undefined</code></p>

<p>As I understand it, I need a view (form), controller and model. The model connects to my default DB connection via a class/function (my DB is where my drop-down list country data is stored), it returns an array, and finally the model parses the array to the form.</p>

<p>Where I struggle is how to parse the array along to the view. Because I'm dealing with 3 files, to output one html file, context is really important, as is syntax. I asked this earlier today and nearly lost my mind as the two answers I got were fragmented and out of context. They were helpful but assumed I knew a lot more than I do.</p>

<p>In other words, please be explicit, because a syntax oversight or knowledge assumption could have me scratching my head for hours. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>To expand the cell, I call <strong>reloadRowsAtIndexPaths</strong> passing an array of the cell's indexPath.</p>

<p>I find that this works in most of the cases but sometimes a cell doesn't update. 
Digging around, I discovered that in the case of these faulty cells, there's never a call to <strong>cellForRowAtIndexPath</strong>.</p>

<p>The normal sequence for a cell's expansion, as I understand it, is</p>

<pre><code>*expandCellAtIndexPath: -&gt; reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation: -&gt; tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:*
</code></pre>

<p>Between <strong>reloadRowsAtIndexPaths</strong> and <strong>cellForRowAtIndexPath</strong>, there's a call to tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath: where I include the updated height of the affected cell.</p>

<p>The sequence is mostly the same (as far as code I can step-through) for the faulty case, except after <strong>heightForRowAtIndexPath</strong> on the table, <strong>cellForRowAtIndexPath</strong> never gets called.</p>

<p>The result is that the table view expands the cell but the content has not been updated in the faulty case, resulting in a poor user experience.</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced this problem with cell updates on a UITableView or am I missing something obvious? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A couple of things to note:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The indexPath for each cell is valid when reloadRowsAtIndexPaths executes (it's not nil and points to a cell in the tableview) in both
functioning and faulty scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>My tests suggest that the same row always triggers the fault condition during expansion regardless of where it is positioned
within the visible portion of the table view.</p></li>

If I want to avoid putting jqueryui onto every page (i.e. I don't want to include it in the bundle(s) that are loaded by default in my _Layout.cshtml), how could I have the editor template include the jqueryui.js and jqueryui.css files for me in a way that wouldn't result in multiple references to those files, and would put the references in the header or at the end of my body instead of inline?</p>

<p>Here's what I've tried in my editor template that <em>didn't</em> seem to work:</p>

<pre><code>@System.Web.Optimization.Scripts.Render(""~/bundles/jqueryui"")
@System.Web.Optimization.Styles.Render(""~/Content/jqueryuistyles"")
</code></pre>

<p>This added the script and link tags, but it renders the tags once per use of the editor template, and it also renders them right in-line, so in my case, that's before jquery has been loaded at the bottom of the body.</p>

<pre><code>@section Scripts{ &lt;script src=""@System.Web.Optimization.BundleTable.Bundles.ResolveBundleUrl(""~/bundles/jqueryui"")""&gt;&lt;/script&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>This matches how I include the bundle in my _Layout.cshtml, but this apparently doesn't work from an editor template. Nothing was rendered at all, and even if it did, I think it'd still result in multiple references to the javascript file (1 per time that the editor template was called)</p>

<p>Seems like there should be a way to have an editor template trigger the inclusion of a javascript or css file that can tie into the bundles or at the very least the @section system. Anyone know how to do this?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>and get the length of that selection:</p>

<pre><code>len(fal_mean.loc[(35, -75), '101'])
Out[75]: 21
</code></pre>

<p>But I cannot figure out how to return a slice of the data frame using<br>
  <code>len(fal_mean.loc[(35, -75), '101']) &gt; N</code></p>

<p>something like:</p>

<pre><code>fal_mean.loc[(len(fal_mean.loc[(35, -75), '101']) &gt; 32)] 
</code></pre>

<p>Except I'd need to pass all values for the lat and lon indices.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 1</p>

<p>Here is a dataframe containing the lengths of each combination (index=lat, columns=lon), so I just need to be able to call those combinations >N with some slice notation on the origanl dataframe 'fal_mean'</p>

<p>I created the dataframe using:</p>

<pre><code>cv=np.arange(35, 45, 1)
cv2=np.arange(-75, -66, 1)
fal=pd.DataFrame(data=None, index=cv, columns=cv2)
for lat in cv:
    for lon in cv2:
        fal.loc[lat, lon]=len(fal_mean.xs((lat, lon), level=('lat', 'lon')))

    -75 -74 -73 -72 -71 -70 -69 -68 -67
35  21  8   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
36  33  32  0   0   0   0   0   0   0
37  33  35  0   0   0   0   0   0   0
38  13  35  32  8   0   0   0   0   0
39  0   31  35  35  25  9   16  0   0
40  0   0   35  32  36  37  37  37  37
41  0   0   0   0   34  33  36  37  37
42  0   0   0   0   0   37  37  35  37
43  0   0   0   0   0   32  35  31  34
44  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   12  31
</code></pre>

<p>I'm hoping there is some clever slice notation I could use to do this.  I have tried <code>xs</code> and <code>df.index.get_level_values</code> but my syntax is wrong.</p>

<p>e.g.   <code>fal_mean.loc[:, len(fal_mean.index.get_level_values('yr') &gt;32)]</code> does not work.</p>

<p>If there isn't a way to do this in one line, I could call a boolean array on this matrix and hopefully use <code>.loc</code> to call the 0 and 1 indices (lat, lon) for those combinations in the original dataframe, but I'm not sure yet how to go about that.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:
here are the first 50 rows and 4 columns, there are 28+ columns, but that is not important at this point.  I would like to keep all columns at only the latitude and longitude combinations with at least (N) entries for year index - I'm thinking 32 may be sufficient.  That would exclude data from lat/lon combinations (35, (all)), (36, -74), (38, -75), etc. using the dataframe above as a guide.</p>

<p>These data were generated by a groupby function <code>grouped=nm.groupby(['lat', 'lon', 'yr'])</code> so if I could modify that call with some limiter for the resulting lengths of grouped.year that would work also.  I tried <code>df.groupby(['key1', 'key2', 'key3']).size()</code> and this gives the number of data points that were binned to each lat lon combination for each year.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that the server sends multiple '206 partial content' packets to the browser and the preloading image just hangs around because I believe the server is sending small packets of the video to load or it's just requesting the file over and over - I really can't tell. </p>

<p>I've tried to think of some way around this, but after hours of searching I haven't come up with any solutions. </p>

<p>I have a client application, working on multiple tablets, that have to send several requests to add content to the server.
But I don't want to use auto rollback at the end of each API request (default behavior with flask-sqlalchemy), because the sending of data is done with multiple requests, like in this very simplified example :</p>

<p><strong>1. beginTransaction/?id=transactionId</strong> -> opens a new session for the client making that request. <strong>SessionManager.new_session()</strong> in the code below.</p>

<p><strong>2. addObject/?id=objectAid</strong> -> adds an object to the PostGreSQL database and flush</p>

<p><strong>3. addObject/?id=objectBid</strong> -> adds an object to the PostGreSQL database and flush</p>

<p><strong>4. commitTransaction/?id= transactionId</strong> -> commit what happened since the beginTransaction. <strong>SessionManager.commit()</strong> in the code below.</p>

<p>The point here is to not add the data to the server if the client app crashed / lost his connection before the « commitTransaction » was sent, thus preventing from having incomplete data on the server.</p>

<p>Since I don't want to use auto rollback, I can't really use flask-SQLAlchemy, so I'm implementing SQLAlchemy by myself into my flask application, but I'm not sure how to use the sessions.</p>

<p>Here's the implementation I did in the __ init __.py :</p>

<pre><code>db = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://admin:pwd@localhost/postgresqlddb',
                   pool_reset_on_return=False,
                   echo=True, pool_size=20, max_overflow=5)

Base = declarative_base()
metadata = Base.metadata
metadata.bind = db

# create a configured ""Session"" class
Session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=db, autoflush=False))



class SessionManager(object):

    currentSession = Session()

    @staticmethod
    def new_session():
    #if a session is already opened by the client, close it
    #create a new session
        try:
            SessionManager.currentSession.rollback()
            SessionManager.currentSession.close()
        except Exception, e:
            print(e)

        SessionManager.currentSession = Session()
        return SessionManager.currentSession

    @staticmethod
    def flush():
        try:
            SessionManager.currentSession.flush()
            return True
        except Exception, e:
            print(e)
            SessionManager.currentSession.rollback()
            return False

    @staticmethod
    def commit():
    #commit and close the session
    #create a new session in case the client makes a single request without using beginTransaction/
        try:
            SessionManager.currentSession.commit()
            SessionManager.currentSession.close()
            SessionManager.currentSession = Session()
            return True
        except Exception, e:
            print(e)
            SessionManager.currentSession.rollback()
            SessionManager.currentSession.close()
            SessionManager.currentSession = Session()
            return False
</code></pre>

<p>But now the API doesn’t work when several clients make a request, it seems like every client share the same session.</p>

<p>How should I implement the sessions so that each client has a different session and can make requests concurrently ?</p>

<p>Let me explain it a bit further.</p>

<p>I have this CoreData application and I am relatively new in CoreData. I have two tables. One is Budget and one is Spending. So Budget table has a field called TotalBudget. Now I have different rows in Spending Table which user input over the time and this table has a field called Individual Spend.</p>

<p>Now what I am hoping to do is to get only those budgets where Sum of Individual Spend is less than TotalBudget (Budget table). In SQL language it would be something like below</p>

<p>Select BudgetName
From Budget
Where TotalBudget &lt; (Select Sum(IndividualBudget) From Spend Where BudgetID = Budget.BudgetID)</p>

<p>How can I achieve that in core data? I have the code to retrieve data from one table and I can use NSPredicate to filter records based to BudgetStartDate and BudgetEndDate but how can I achieve something like that.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I need my body inside and sidebar content to extend down to meet the other wherever the other stops. I need this for dynamic pages for wordpress. So here is the header.</p>

<p><strong>header.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" &lt;?php language_attributes(); ?&gt;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;
!!!!content cut to save space!!!!!
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body &lt;?php body_class(); ?&gt;&gt;

&lt;div id=""site""&gt;

    &lt;div id=""wrapper""&gt;

            &lt;!------break-from-header------&gt;

            &lt;div id=""wrapperbody""&gt;
                &lt;div id=""bodyinside""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The index.php pages and post.php pages anything with content are calling the header above and footer below. Self explanatory right?</p>

<p><strong>footer.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--body-inside--&gt;
&lt;div id=""sidebar""&gt;

&lt;?php get_sidebar(); ?&gt;

&lt;div id=""sidebarlight""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--wrapper-body--&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--main-wrapper--&gt;
    &lt;div id=""footer-wrapper""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""footer""&gt;

    &lt;div id=""footer-nav""&gt;

                &lt;?php wp_nav_menu(array('theme_location' =&gt; 'footer-menu')); ?&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--footer-nav--&gt;

            &lt;div id=""copyright""&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Powered by: &lt;a href=""http://wordpress.org""&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; Copyright 2013&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--copyright--&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--footer--&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--footer-wrapper--&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>I took out a lot of code but that is the basic stuff. Like I said I need the sidebar and body inside to align with one another. You can see where the content extends past the sidebar and I need the grey to extend down to meet with the white here <a href=""http://patriotvoice.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patriotvoice.net</a>..... BUT I need the white to  extend down to the grey on a page like this <a href=""http://patriotvoice.net/news"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patriotvoice.net/news</a></p>

<p>On top of the Seadragon viewport, the user can draw measurements and annotations.  Those annotations are drawn into a Canvas on top of the Seadragon.  </p>

<p>In order to be able to edit the annotation, my application has to be into ""Edit Annotation"" mode.  What this mode does, it simply removes the CSS style pointer-events: none; from the annotation canvas.  When this mode is off, I put back the pointer-events: none; to the annotation canvas so that the Seadragon viewport can receive the mouse events.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that the pointer-events property is not supported by IExplorer and Opera.  Since the annotation canvas is drawn on top of the Seadragon viewport, in IExplorer9 and Opera, I can NEVER have the mouse event to reach the Seadragon Viewport.</p>

<p>I gave it a try by passing the mouseevent to the DOM element used to created the Seadragon viewport, but it does not seem to work.</p>

<p>$('#annotationCanvas').mousedown(function(){ $('#seadragonVP').trigger('mousedown'); });</p>

<p>But this does not work...</p>

<p>Can someone help me on how to :</p>

<ol>
<li>Either pass the mouse event to elements underneath another element</li>
<li>or to call directly the mouse events from Seadragon</li>

<p>Every .isotope object (a circle with text) has</p>

<pre><code>margin: 0 10px 0 10px;

<p>Like on the screen:</p>

<p>--> Check image 2 now &lt;--</p>

<p><strike>
There are four objects in the row. What I want is no margins for left and right side of first and fourth item so that every one is sticking to ""walls"" of parent body container. 
</strike>
Edit:<br/>
Every item should have bottom margin of 20px and every item except 1,5,9 or in other words 4n+1 should also have left-margin of 20px. So they will nicely stack. <a href=""http://www.imgur.com/nusu8n0"" rel=""nofollow"">image</a></p>

<p>So I have tried with <code>nth-child</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#portfolio-wrap &gt; div:nth-child(4n+1)  {
    margin: 0 0 20px 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it makes isotope act buggy as seen below.
The red numbers are consecutive child numbers as they should appear according to code without filtering:</p>

<p>--> Check image 3 now &lt;--</p>

<p>The first and fifth children have their margin applied good. And everything would be well if not two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>After filtering the applied margin is not changing.</li>
<li>The position bug, as on last imgur link.</li>
</ol>

I have found a js solution to one problem and it works partially for me: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11677827/css-nth-child2n1-repaint-css-after-filtering-out-list-items"">Stackoverflow - click</a> When I apply the 4n+1 code it doesnt work, whats wrong? (I'm not really any good with js)</p>

<pre><code>var x=0;
$('.portfolio-item:not(.isotope-hidden)').each(function(){
     for (x=4*x+1; x&lt;=50; x++ ) { 
        $(this).css('margin','0 0 20px 0') 
     } else {
        $(this).css('margin','0 0 20px 20px')
     }
})
</code></pre>

<p>ad. 2<br/>
I don't know what causes the alignment bug. I thought that could be too much margins destroying wrapper, but it is not the case.</p>

<h1>Update for everybody:</h1>

<p>I have fixed my js and it works!:</p>

<pre><code>$('.portfolio-item:not(.isotope-hidden)').each(function()) {
        for (x = 1; x &lt;= 50; ++x) { 
        if ((x - 1) % 4 == 0) {
            $(this).css('margin','0 0 20px 0') 
        } else { 
                $(this).css('margin','0 0 20px 20px')  
        } 
    }}
</code></pre>

<p>Layout bug is still bugging as on image3!</p>

<p>Also js after filtering is not applying new margin... :(</p>

<h1>Update 2:</h1>

<p>I have resolved the problem by applying gutterWidth (see isotope manuals) also you not only need apply gutterwidth but also long stack of code from demo of gutterwidth from source. Shame on you isotope documentation. </p>

<p>I am currently working on a native/server project where one important step is to render a HTML/CSS animated 3D cube into a video. I am using <em><a href=""http://phantomjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">PhantomJS</a></em> and <em>FFmpeg</em> for the video part.</p>

<p>The 3D cube is in a <code>div</code>, which is inside a container, in the HTML code. On the CSS side, the cube gets animated in CSS3 using media queries as seen below.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>This 3D cube works fine when looking at it using a web browser, but when it gets rendered into a PNG the whole cube looks flat as a paper. Tearing down the code, I noticed <em>PhantomJS</em> is ignoring the <code>preserve-3d</code>. If you commentate the <code>preserve-3d</code> away, you will get the same result as the PNG´s using <em>PhantomJS</em>.</p>

<p>Also, using <code>translateZ</code>, <code>rotateY</code> and <code>rotateX</code> seems not to be working as intended. Mainly because of the <code>preserve-3d</code> problem.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how I should proceed with this problem? </p>

<p>P.S. I have also tried using <code>-moz-transform</code>, <code>-o-transform</code>, <code>-ms-transform</code> and <code>transform</code> instead of <code>-webkit-transform</code>, did not work.</p>

<p>I would like to use the first line's syntax with no out-of-class definition:</p>

<pre><code>static constexpr struct E {} nested {}; // works in gcc and clang
</code></pre>

<p>When there are no members in <code>E</code>, Clang and GCC only seem to care that I have no out-of-class definition of <code>nested</code> if I trip ODR (e.g. by taking the address). <strong>Is this standard mandated or luck?</strong></p>

<p>When there are members, GCC (5.2) appears to additionally want me to have manually defined a constexpr copy constructor. <strong>Is this a bug?</strong></p>

<p>From googling and SO I have found several different answers but it's hard to tease apart which are up to date with C++14. In C++98/03 I believe only integer types could be initialized inside the class. I <em>think</em> that C++14 expanded this to 'literal' types which includes constexpr constructable things. I don't know if this is the same as saying I am allowed to get away with not having an out-of-class definition though.</p>

I'd like to keep a list of the numbers but be able to refer to them by name so that I can call them and use them where needed easily. Kind of like an inventory listing, where the numbers all refer to a part ID and I'd like to call them idPart1, idPart2, idPart3 so their purpose is easily identifiable when they are used.</p>

<p>What would be the best way to do this?<br>
1)Define a structure. Say, Inventory. A number of int members will be included, part1, part2 etc. To use, an instance of the structure will be created, values assigned to the members, and the numbers will be used by saying struct.member as needed.<br>
2)Define an enumeration. Use part1, part2 as the enum literals. Store the actual values in a vector or list, each one at the index corresponding to the value of the number's name within the enum. Use the enum literals to retrieve the values, list[enumLit].<br>
3)Something completely different</p>

<p>There's nothing else I need to do with the numbers - just look them up every once in a while. Since there's no processing, I kind of think a new class for them is overkill, but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise.</p>

When displaying the value to the user, I want to show a corresponding string.  Sometimes this is in ComboBox (where the user can select a value), and sometimes it is in a TextBlock (where it is read-only).</p>

<p>Example: for <code>ExportRegulationType.EAR</code>, I want to display <code>""EAR""</code>, while for <code>ExportRegulationType.DoNotExport</code>, I want to display <code>""Do Not Export""</code>.  Note that I don't have any language localization needs, but I recognize the issue...</p>

<p>Currently, in my ViewModel, I have a property that returns a string based on the current enum value, and also another property that returns a <code>Dictionary&lt;ExportRegulationType, string&gt;</code>.  For the ComboBoxes, I can bind <code>ItemsSource</code> to the dictionary property, and for the TextBlocks, I can bind to the string property.  This works, but is kind of clumsy.</p>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<p>1) It seems to me that I should be able to declare the dictionary (with keys and values) as a static resource in XAML (probably in App.xaml), and use that for the ItemsSource for the ComboBox version.  However, I can't figure out how to declare and reference such a thing.  How can I do that?</p>

<p>2) Assuming the above is in place, I would think I could also set up a binding with the textblock, so based on the enum property, it will look up the string in the dictionary.</p>

<p>I have seen the following questions relating to a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2981046/wpf-binding-to-items-within-a-dictionary-by-key"">static</a> or <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5414122/how-to-use-enum-as-key-when-binding-a-dictionary-to-many-textblock-on-xaml"">dynamic</a> enum value.  The first isn't adequate, and the second isn't answered...</p>

<p>These should be a XAML-only, and will enable me to remove the methods from my ViewModel (having only the one exposed <code>ExportRegulationType</code> enumerated property. Are these possible?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Additional information:</strong></p>

<p>In the application, I will have many different sets of views, models, and ViewModels.  However, as export control regulations are a common and consistent requirement, I am using composition to keep it DRY.  i.e., Models A and B both have an ExportControl model.

<p>Would it be acceptable/possible to use codefirst migrations to add to my database and than mimic those changes in my designer?  </p>

<p>For example, if I added the scalar property ""Name"" to my ""Person"" table, could I simple open up a new project in visual studio, use database to code first to generate my current schema, and use auto migration to add the the database? All I would have to do after that is mimic those changes in my model- first designer. Essentially, I could continue writing new methods that use the Name property in the Person class.  I would just never execute the code from the model first generator again and use the code first migration to continually add new tables or properties to  my database.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" class=""loginable postStory""&gt;Share Your Quirks&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>loginable checks if user is logged in and, if not, presents a ""modal"" login popup:</p>

<pre><code>$("".loginable"").live(""click"",function(e) {                        
    $.getJSON(""/cfcs/global.cfc?method=userAuthenticated&amp;returnformat=json"", {}, function(res,code) {
        if(res == 0){
            doSiteLogin();
        }
    });
})
</code></pre>

<p>postStory loads a form for adding a story:</p>

<pre><code>$("".postStory"").live(""click"", function(e) {
    $(function() {
        $(""#divCentre"").load(siteRoot + ""add_story.cfm?mode=create"");
    })
});
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that once the link is clicked, we don't want to show the add_story page unless the user is logged in, i.e. we need to user to stay on the current page UNTIL they've successfully logged in. But currently, it displays the add_story page AND the login popup. </p>

<p>To see what I mean, go to www.quirkup.com and click the ""Share your quirks"" link at the top of the ""True Confessions"" section.</p>

<p>The problem is that the user can close the modal window without logging in and can start filling in the form. I realise I can probably hide the form until the login is completed, but I'm wondering if there's a better way.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>THe doSiteLogin() function looks like this</p>

<p>The following are the steps which I am taking at this stage: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using the DateTimeFormatter to do the initial formatting: </p>

<pre><code>DateTimeFormatter jodaParser = DateTimeFormat
                            .forPattern(inputDateWhichIsAString);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Converting it to a LocalDate with the necessary Time Zone (UTC)</p>

<pre><code>LocalDate localDate = jodaParser
                            .withZone(DateTimeZone.UTC)
                            .parseDateTime(inputDateWhichIsAString).toLocalDate();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Using the LocalDate to retrieve the Java Date object </p>

<pre><code>return localDate.toDate();
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>However while I should expect the returned date to be : 5th of Jan 2012, what I am getting is 1st of Jan 1970. I was under the impression that JODA takes care of these problems which the Java Date object is known to have.  </p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong here - or do anyone of you have had similar issues and know a workaround to it? </p>

<p>Thanks 
Rajat</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>Firstly thanks Michael. </p>

<p>So here is an improvement over my previous snippet which has made sure that I get the right Date - in other words the solution.  </p>

<pre> <code>
    //Make sure you use HH instead of hh if you are using 24 hour convention. I use this convention since my date format is: 2012-01-05T08:00:00.000Z


     DateTimeFormatter jodaParser = 
                 DateTimeFormat.forPattern(""yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZZ"");

     LocalDate date = jodaParser.withZone(DateTimeZone.UTC).parseDateTime
                 (inputDateWhichIsAString).toLocalDate();

     return date.toDate();

I have a web server, written in C++, that for each connection in, will need to send a ZMQ message to a subscriber.  These servers can have hundreds to thousands of concurrent connections, so I am curious what the most efficient way to write to this subscriber is.  I can think of three different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Share connection</strong></p>

<p>I do not believe this way will work, but basically having a single connection pointer, and passing that to all threads.  I am assuming(could not find much information when I was searching on the ZMQ site), this will cause a race condition, as I don't think zmq_msg_send() is thread safe.  I could put a mutex around the send to solve this problem, but I am worried about speed, as my server needs to be as fast as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Shared queue</strong></p>

<p>This is similar to the shared connection, but in a different way, instead of putting a mutex around the zmq_msg_send(), instead I have a mutex around a shared vector of messages to send, and have a write thread to process all of these messages.  I believe this will be faster than the previous method since writing to a vector is probably much quicker than doing a zmq_msg_send(), however, if possible I would like to avoid waiting at all.</p>

<p><strong>Connection per thread</strong></p>

<p>The only way I can think of to avoid mutex waiting is to open a zmq connection per thread(which means per connection I get in, as a process one user connection per thread).  This maybe doable, although I do not know how zmq_connect works.  Does that block until connection is established?  Ideally my flow would go something like this:</p>

<pre><code>user_connection()
{
    createZMQConnection();
    doWork();
    sendData();        
}
</code></pre>

<p>However if creating a connection blocks, it may be better to to use the shared queue.</p>

<p>Has anyone made a similar application, or does anyone know what the recommended patter would be?  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Thank you for the response, I was just looking more into the zmq docs, and found a lot of what you were talking about, but maybe you can clarify a little bit.</p>

<p>So as for my infrastructure, I have a many pub to single sub.  The pubs are connecting and subs are binding.  </p>

<p>I have multiple load balanced boxes running multiple threads per box.  Overall I am seeing about 30,000 messages / sec.  Per box, I will probably see about about 2,000-4,000 messages/sec.  My usual processing time per request is about 40ms, so I will often have about 100-200 concurrent instances open.  I wasn't sure if opening 200 concurrent socket objects would be a problem, or if this would be the ZMQ way of doing stuff.  From the sounds of things, I should be passing a zmq::context to each thread and creating the sockets there.</p>

<p>This is kind of how I imagine the code will be flowing, please let me know if this looks right</p>

<pre><code>void receiveConnection()
{
    zmq::context_t context(1);
    doWorkClass c(context);
    c.run();
}

doWorkClass(context)
{
    socket(context, ZMQ_PUB);
}

void doWorkClass::run()
{
    sendString = doWork();
    s_send(socket,sendString);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I use one context for all sockets, and create one socket per thread, do my work, and send my message.</p>

<p>And I am writing code in cakephp to create a request by passing the $param variable using soapnu, like this: </p>

<pre><code>142 $param = array('val1' =&gt; $arr['1'],
143                'val2' =&gt; $arr['2'],

<p>What I would like to know is how I can pass the value of the selected unordered list item to the code behind using JQuery or AJAX. Neither method I know much (or to be totally honest) anything about. </p>

<p>When I hit the submit button it takes the text box value and passes that back to <code>Request.Form(""srchTerm"")</code> but i cant seem to get anything else to pass. </p>

<p>I have seen this link here at <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/RyG95/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">fiddle</a> but cant seem to get it to work for me. </p>

<p>I am wondering if its because how I have declared my listbox, but do need help in order to get this to work. </p>

<p>If I am missing a tag, please let me know. But I would very much appreciate the help with the JavaScript to get this wired up to pass the data so I can call the information from my database. </p>

<p>====================================</p>

<h1>edit 1</h1>

<p>I've tried various methods, none of which i have kept, but this is that i have right now and cant get anything to pass a value across.</p>

<pre><code>$("".dropdown-menu li a"").click(function () {
    var selText = $(this).text();
    $(this).parents('.btn-group').find('.dropdown-toggle').html(selText + '     &lt;span class=""caret""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;');

$('.reportStatus li').click(function () {

  document.getElementById('bbtop').src = ""img/2520dip8_c1_10pf.png"";
  document.getElementById('bbdefine').innerHTML = ""10pf Capacitor"";
}

function topCap2() {
  document.getElementById('bbtop').src = ""img/2520dip8_c2_39pf.png"";
  document.getElementById('bbdefine').innerHTML = ""39pf Capacitor"";

<p>At the top of each page, in the Page Header, I want to print the Parent Name.</p>

<p>There are a number of columns in the report, and when the group breaks, I want to display the new Child name, as well as the column headers again.  The report should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Parent Name
    Child Name
    Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4 Col5 Col6
    XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
    XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX

    Child Total:             XXXX

    Child Name
    Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4 Col5 Col6
    XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
</code></pre>

<p>If a child group wraps around to the new page, though, I want to re-display the Child Name and column captions before displaying data again.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, I have created a Page Header that contains the following objects:</p>

<pre><code>Parent Name
    Child Name
    Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4 Col5 Col6
</code></pre>

<p>In the page header is a variable <code>RowReset</code> that contains the following formula:</p>

<pre><code>WhilePrintingRecords;
Shared numberVar nRowCount := 0
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in each detail row, as well as the Group Footer 1 and Group Footer 2 sections, I have the following <code>RowIncrement</code> formula:</p>

<pre><code>WhilePrintingRecords;
Shared numberVar nRowCount := nRowCount + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, in each Group Header 2 section, I have the following conditional suppression formula:</p>

<pre><code>WhilePrintingRecords;
Shared numberVar nRowCount;
IF (PageNumber &lt;&gt; 1) AND (nRowCount = 0 OR nRowCount = 0.00) THEN
    True
ELSE
    False
</code></pre>

<p>What this attempts to do is suppress the Child group header if we're on a brand new page, and no detail records have been printed yet, to prevent the following from happening:</p>

<pre><code>Parent Name                          ---+
    Child Name                          +-- Page header
    Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4 Col5 Col6    ---+

    Child Name                       ---+-- Group header 2
    Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4 Col5 Col6    ---+
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason I can't figure out, about 40 pages into the report, I get exactly that though; a Page Header record, followed by a Group header 2 record.  If I create a formula that contains the conditional suppress formula, it displays <code>TRUE</code>, but the group header still doesn't suppress.</p>

<p>If I break up the code so that it checks only one of the conditionals (either <code>PageNumber &lt;&gt; 1</code> or <code>nRowCount = 0</code>) then the Group Header 2 suppresses correctly.</p>

<p>I have even tried this to break things up:</p>

<pre><code>WhilePrintingRecords;
Shared numberVar nRowCount;
booleanVar bSuppress:= False;

IF PageNumber &lt;&gt; 1 THEN bSuppress:= True;
IF (bSuppress) THEN (IF nRowCount = 0 THEN True ELSE False);
</code></pre>

I have an application that returns a list of features on the local SharePoint farm.  But the issue is that it seems to return them as 'Online' whether or not they are activated.
For example, this feature would still show up in my app as 'Online' even though it is not activated:<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4intP.png"" alt=""This feature would still be displayed as 'Online'""></p>

<p>The code I am using currently is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    foreach (SPFeatureDefinition featureDefinition in featureCollection)
            {
                if (featureDefinition.Scope.Equals(scopeSelect))
                {
                    string featureName = featureDefinition.DisplayName;

                        XElement newItem = new XElement(""Item"", featureName);
                        XElement itemStatus = new XElement(""Item"", featureDefinition.Status);
                        infoTree.Add(newItem);
                        infoTree.Add(itemStatus);
                    }
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that featureDefinition.Status always returns 'Online' regardless of the actual status of the feature.  This leads me to believe I am doing something wrong, or the <code>.Status</code> property isn't actually what I am looking for.</p>

<p>Is there another property I can use that would set me on the right track?</p>

<p>Any guidance/suggestions will be most appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Just as an aside, an IIS reset does not have any effect on it returning a different status.</p>

"3769706","1","","","2010-09-22 13:29:15","","1","844","<p>I develop a client/server application which share some camera images. The general cycle is:</p>

<ol>
<li>The client captures a camera image and compress it to an binary image. After that it sends it to the server</li>
<li>The server exactly knows how large the buffer is (640*480/8 bytes) so he is able to receive the hole image with only one recv-call. The next recv-call will get the second image and so on</li>
<li>After receiving the image the server works with the image and will then send another image back to the client. But here is the problem: The image is jpeg compressed and so the client doesn't know the filesize and can't receive the image like the server with a fixed bufferlength.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think that wouldn't be a problem if the server would close the connection after sending the image. But I don't want to close the connection because in the next cycle I will send the next image over the same connection.</p>

<p>My question is: How can I tell the client that the server send the hole image without closing the connection?</p>

<p>Here's some code:
(The client sends the  binary image to the server)</p>

<pre><code>void sendToServer(char* sendbuf, int sendbuflen) {
    int iResult = send(ConnectSocket, sendbuf, sendbuflen, 0);
    if (iResult == SOCKET_ERROR) {
        (*errCallbackFunc)(""Sending image error"", -1);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(The server receives the image with only one functioncall - recbuflen = 640*480/8)</p>

<pre><code>int receiveCameraImages(ARUint8* dataPtr) {
int         iResult;

iResult = recv(ClientSocket, recvbuf, recvbuflen, 0);
if (iResult &gt; 0) {
    if ((*(recvbuf+0)) != 'U' || (*(recvbuf+((xsize*ysize/8)-1))) != 'U')
        return RECEIVING_INCOMPLETE;

    convertBWChartoBGR(recvbuf, dataPtr, recvbuflen);

    return RECEIVING_SUCCEEDED;
} else if (iResult == 0) {
    (*errCallbackFunc)(""Connection closing"", -1);
    return RECEIVING_CONN_CLOSED;
}
else {
    (*errCallbackFunc)(""recv failed"", WSAGetLastError());
    return RECEIVING_ERROR;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Now the Server works with the image and send another jpeg compressed image back)</p>

<pre><code>int sendObjectImage(ARUint8* dataPtr, int bufLen) {
int iResult;

/* send the openGLBuffer back to the client */
iResult = send(ClientSocket, dataPtr, bufLen, 0);
if (iResult == SOCKET_ERROR) (*errCallbackFunc)(""send openglbuffer back to client failed"", WSAGetLastError());
}
</code></pre>

<p>(And the client doesn't know how large the buffer is so it receives 512Byte parts)</p>

<pre><code>int receiveFromServer(ARUint8* dataPtr) {
int iResult, returnBufLen = 0;
int recvBufLen = DEFAULT_BUFFER_LEN;
ARUint8 recvBuf[DEFAULT_BUFFER_LEN];

/* receive openGL buffer */
do {
    iResult = recv(ConnectSocket, recvBuf, recvBufLen, 0);
    if (iResult &gt; 0) {
        printf(""Bytes received: %d\n"", iResult);
        returnBufLen += iResult;
    }
    else if (iResult == 0)
        printf(""Connection closed\n"");
    else
        printf(""recv failed: %d\n"", WSAGetLastError());
} while (iResult &gt;= DEFAULT_BUFFER_LEN);

dataPtr = recvBuf;

return returnBufLen;
}
</code></pre>

<p>with the while (iResult >= DEFAULT_BUFFER_LEN) I thought it will stop the receiving (because if a part is smaller than 512Bytes it must be the end). But my recvBuf only contains the last Bytes.</p>

<p>Maybe it's possible that I don't understand the hole winsock stuff, but I thought that the recvBuf will contain the hole buffer I received. Is that wrong? How do I get the hole received buffer without closing the connection?</p>

<li>I want to pipe this request to another server</li>
<li>I want to receive response inside express handler (I dont want to pipe response to express res stream)</li>
</ol>

<p>For now I have following code:</p>

<p>So this does not work - request is not even piped to server2 - I checked it and there is no incoming request.</p>

<hr>

<p>I solved points 1 &amp; 2 like this:</p>

<pre><code>var bodyParser = express.bodyParser();

app.use(function(req,res,next){

<pre><code>app.post('/server1',function(req,res,next){

    var request = require('request');
    var pipe = req.pipe(request.post('/server2'));

    pipe.on('end',function(){

        console.log(res2);

    });
});

<p><code>res2</code> object has correct statusCode and headers and so on but it does not contain body - how I can get this from the <code>res2</code> object? <code>/server2</code> returns some data in json but I dont know how to read it from response...</p>

<p>I want to use a selector on an NSObject instance <em>without</em> the need for an implemented protocol. For example, there's a category method that should set an error property if the NSObject instance it's called on supports it. This is the code, and the code works as intended:</p>

{
    [self performSelector:@selector(setError:) withObject:[NSError errorWithDomain:@""SomeDomain"" code:1 userInfo:nil]];

<p>However, the compiler doesn't see any method around with the setError: signature, so it gives me a warning, for each line that contains the <code>@selector(setError:)</code> snippet:</p>

<pre><code>Undeclared selector 'setError:'

<p>I don't want to have to declare a protocol to get rid of this warning, because I don't want all classes that may use this to implement anything special. Just by convention I want them to have a <code>setError:</code> method or property.</p>

  <p>""To get a JSON string from a JSON file, use the Get-Content cmdlet with its Raw parameter.""</p>

<pre><code>   PS C:\&gt; Get-Content -Raw -Path .\myJson.json
</code></pre>
  
  <p>""The Raw parameter tells Get-Content to ignore line breaks and return a single string.""  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking this looks handy - I want to learn more about this parameter, I type the following commands and receive unexpected results:</p>

<pre><code>    PS C:\&gt; Update-Help
    PS C:\&gt; Get-Help Get-Content -Parameter Raw
    Get-Help : No parameter matches criteria Raw. ##error etc.

    PS C:\&gt; Get-Help Get-Content -Full | Out-String | Select-String 'Raw'
    PS C:\&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>In the ISE, intellisense offers 'raw' as a parameter of 'Get-Content' and in the normal shell tab-complete tells me it's a real parameter. I just can't seem to locate any documentation that explains it's usage. ""Help Get-Content -Online"" also returns nothing.</p>

<pre><code>    PS C:\&gt; Get-Command * -ParameterName 'raw'
    Cmdlet      Get-Content        Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
</code></pre>

<p>Get-Command confirms the parameter exists, is not a member of the 'Common Parameter' Set and is present in my version of PowerShell. My question: </p>

<p><strong>Why are some parameters of ""Get-Content"" not visible in my help files or online but are still available for use, specifically -raw, -stream and -encoding. Is there a list of similarly hidden parameters for other Cmdlets?</strong></p>

<p>I'm running PowerShell v4 on Windows 8.1 in a workgroup environment.
Thanks for your help. </p>

<p>What do I need to do to connect the JS to the HTML elements, if that is actually what I am doing wrong? Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: I realized that it is also important to note that the HTML for the table is generated dynamically via an AJAX call to a server. When that call returns, the table is created by updating the innerHTML of the div with the id ""upload_res"" with the string returned by the server.</p>

<p>If you scroll the main body content (long articles, etc) quickly and let momentum carry the animation, subsequent taps inside the overlay content are treated as taps to the body directly.

I have come to realise that adding extra parentheses at the end helps the anonymous functions execute.

It goes something like :-</p>

        format: 'alphanumeric',

    });

});

Here when i will have '0' as any parameter i.e. <code>CategoryId</code>, <code>GameId</code>, <code>LimitVariantId</code>, that means user has selected ""All"" from interface.</p>

<p>My Sql query, when I will pass parameter values greater than '0' is : </p>

<pre><code>select * from dbo.GameCombinations gc
inner join dbo.StakeBuyInByStakeCategories sbsc
on sbsc.StakeBuyInByStakeCategoryId = gc.StakeBuyInByStakeCategoryId
inner join dbo.GameTables gt

where gc.CurrencyId=1 and gc.GameTypeId=2
and sbsc.StakeBuyInId=gt.BuyIn
and gc.CategoryId=4
and gc.GameId=7
and gc.LimitVariantId=23
and gc.StakeCategoryId in (3,5,6)
</code></pre>

<p>When I will pass CategoryId as <code>0</code> then My Sql query will be : </p>

<pre><code>select * from dbo.GameCombinations gc

I'm used <a href=""http://mchung.github.io/heroku-buildpack-wordpress/"" rel=""nofollow"">this project</a> and everything worked really well, except for one problem: the blog is hosted at the root directory on Heroku and I want it hosted on ""/blog"".</p>

<p>I'm looking for two options, neither of which I can figure out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preferred option: figure out how to literally move the entire Wordpress installation from / to /blog. The simple approach of moving everything in to a subdirectory didn't work as Heroku complained that there was not a ""supported app"" when I tried pushing it.</li>
<li>Backup option: keep the blog hosted at / but modify the <a href=""https://github.com/mchung/wordpress-on-heroku/tree/master/config/vendor/nginx/conf"" rel=""nofollow"">nginx config</a> to respond to /blog as well. This is less preferred because it'll mean I'll need to maintain working links at the root of my domain indefinitely, which I'd prefer to avoid.</li>

Normally, I would be satisfied to put the logic in the header file, however, the ACML library conflicts with my use of the ""complex"" include.  Long story short, I need to make all calls to the C ACML library from a separate cpp file.  Below is my code and I have been unable to get it working.  I am using Visual Studio 2013 preview and I am getting the following compilation error:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>acml_lapack.h(8): error C3861: 'dgetrf_c': identifier not found

<p>How do I call and pass arguments to a function physically located in another *.cpp file?  I have found other posts on the subject but I must be missing something as my code will not work.</p>

<p>Header File:</p>

<p>Additional *.cpp file:</p>

<p>I've created a &lt;script&gt; that closely parallels, and reproduces the problem of, another more complex &lt;script&gt; that I've written elsewhere.</p>

<p>Here's what it does:</p>

<ul>
<li>creates an &lt;iframe&gt; and inserts in into a &lt;div&gt; on the page</li>
<li>creates and appends a document to that &lt;iframe&gt;, which contains a &lt;script&gt; that defines a few functions (including a callback function and a function that loads an external &lt;script&gt; using AJAX)</li>
<li>the latter external script is just a call to the callback function, which calls a function that creates a document and appends it to the &lt;iframe&gt; it's in; this should effectively overwrite the &lt;script&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>The three files involved are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://troy.onespot.com/static/document_write/index.html"">http://troy.onespot.com/static/document_write/index.html</a> (the main page)</li>
<li><a href=""http://troy.onespot.com/static/document_write/main.js"">http://troy.onespot.com/static/document_write/main.js</a> (the first &lt;script&gt; that's loaded)</li>
<li><a href=""http://troy.onespot.com/static/document_write/jsonp.js"">http://troy.onespot.com/static/document_write/jsonp.js</a> (the &lt;script&gt; loaded by jQuery's $.ajax() method)</li>
</ul>

<p>This all works in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. Where it breaks down is in Internet Explorer and Opera. What happens is that the render() function in main.js executes, and all three alerts are fired, but the document in the &lt;iframe&gt; is not overwritten. I can't tell what document is being created or written to, or if one is at all.</p>

<p>If I add debug code (like console.log(document)) in the beginning of the render() function, the working browsers seem to get a handle on the existing &lt;iframe&gt; document and list the properties included below. Internet Explorer also appears to find a document of some sort. I just can't tell why it's not letting me overwrite it.</p>

<p>Could it be an issue of scope? Maybe I'm using the document.write(), document.open() or document.close() methods improperly, and Firefox and a few other browsers are just letting me get away with it?</p>

<p>One possible clue: if I take the guts of the render() function out (i.e., just put them after load() in main.js), this works fine. That suggests to me that it's not how I'm using document.open(), etc., but that somehow by the time that the callback() function is executed, the document object is not available, or has gone out of scope, or something like that.</p>

<p>This has me totally stumped, and it's for a very important project with an impending deadline. I'm not above a hack or workaround if it gets me out of this jam. Any help or insight would be EXTREMELY appreciated!</p>

"21607387","1","21607527","","2014-02-06 15:43:13","","2","438","<p>This is more a question out of curiosity than necessity and came about having had to deal with Active Directory (MS) types such as <code>SearchResultCollection</code> (in the <code>System.DirectoryServices</code> namespace).</p>

<p>Frequently when dealing with AD in code, I find that I'm having to check values for null, Count, [0] .. whatever and convert what I get out .. all the while hoping that the underlying AD object via COM doesn't go poof etc.</p>

<p>After having a play about with <code>Parallel.ForEach</code> recently - and having to pass in an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, I thought, maybe it would be fun to see how I could cast a <code>SearchResultCollection</code> to an <code>IEnumerable</code> of my own custom type. In this type I would pull out all the values from the <code>SearchResult</code> object and stick them in my own, .NET managed code. Then I'd do away with the <code>DirectoryEntry</code>, <code>DirectorySearcher</code> etc. etc.</p>

<p>So, having already worked out that it's a good idea to do searchResultCollection.Cast() in order to supply Parallel.ForEach with it's source, I added an explicit operator for casting to my own type (let's just call it '<code>Item</code>').</p>

<p>I tested this out within the <code>ParallelForEach</code>, <code>var myItem = (Item)currentSearchResult</code>.</p>

<p>Good times, my cast operator is called and it all works. I then thought, it would be nice to do something like <code>searchResultCollection.Cast&lt;Item&gt;()</code>. Sadly this didn't work, didn't hit any breakpoints in the cast operator.</p>

<p>I did some Googling and discovered a helpful post which Jon Skeet had answered:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2760804/ienumerable-cast"">IEnumerable.Cast&lt;&gt;</a></p>

<p>The crux of it, use .Select(...) to force the explicit cast operation. OK, but, hmmm.</p>

<p>I went off and perhaps disassembled <code>System.Core</code> -> <code>System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast&lt;TResult&gt;</code>, I noticed that this 'cast' is actually doing an 'as' keyword conversion under the hood:</p>

<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;TResult&gt; Cast&lt;TResult&gt;(this IEnumerable source)
{
    IEnumerable&lt;TResult&gt; enumerable = source as IEnumerable&lt;TResult&gt;;
    if (enumerable != null)
    {
        return enumerable;
    }
    if (source == null)
    {
        throw Error.ArgumentNull(""source"");
    }
    return CastIterator&lt;TResult&gt;(source);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I read some more and found this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3873944/implicit-explicit-conversion-with-respect-to-the-as-keyword"">Implicit/Explicit conversion with respect to the &quot;as&quot; keyword</a></p>

<p>The top answer here states that '<code>as</code>' doesn't invoke any conversion operators .. use a (cast). Semantically I find this a little weird, since the extension method is called cast.. Shouldn't it be casting? There will no doubt be a really good reason why this doesn't happen, anyone know what it is?</p>

Each contains titles.
I got the Movie titles from the IMDB list of titles based on Video games. Not all of them have the same title as the game they are based, but may have a word or two similar.</p>

<p>I was wondering how would I go about using the titles on ps3 and comparing it to the Movies.
I want to return the similar items.</p>

<p>For example, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a film, there is no game called Resident Evil: Apocalypse, but there is Resident Evil games on the PS3 with different names, so would like to get that data.</p>

<p>How could I go about this? I tried doing</p>

<pre><code>WHERE ps3.titles LIKE '%movie.titles%'

I'm not even sure if it is possible in MySQL.

<p>After loding the new patch, <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/983583/en-us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/983583/en-us</a>, .NET Version changes to 2.0.50727.3615 and Environment.WorkingSet now returns the value: 2.047.468.141.(which is 80 bytes bigger than previous one) </p>

<p>On a Vista machine with 3GBs of Ram, Environment.WorkingSet and Process.WorkingSet values are similar and around 37 MBs.</p>

<p>So, why Environment.WorkingSet returns a fixed value? Restarting the application pool does not change anything, it always return the same magic value, 2.047.468.061.</p>

<p>I have also setup an .NET 1.1.4322.2443 application, and it weirdly WorkingSet is returned a number from a random set of unrelated numbers(193.654.824, 214.101.416, 57.207.080, 287.635.496) each time page refreshed while GetProcessMemoryInfo() returns the expected number.</p>

<p>I have also found that when the application run by impersonating ""NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService"" account this problem does not occur, Environment.WorkingSet returns the expected number both .net v1.1 and v2.0.</p>

<p>I have checked CodeAccessPermissions like EnvironmentPermission for windows user and NetworkService but could not find anything that restricts reading the WorkingSet value.</p>

<p>So, what could cause this? Is it a bug, some incorrect configuration or corrupt file etc.?</p>

You can just download it, and start making your game in a few minutes (based on modified examples). And it is <strong>opensource</strong></p>

<p><strong>what I don't like about jMonkey is Java.</strong> It is very limiting if you want to do a <strong>lot of fast vector/quaternion/matrix math</strong>. In C++ you can make overloaded operators for this math. In Java you loose quite a lot of performance by accessing objects elements and allocation of new objects (you often cannot avoid that). It is quite inconvenient to use getters and setters to protected object properties all the time, instead of just accessing numbers directly.</p>

<p>So I wonder if there is something with so much functinality like jMonkey ( <strong>physical engine, scene graph, shaders, import of various 3D mesh / texture formats, networking</strong> .... ) but being in C++ where you can write:</p>

<pre><code>Vector1 += scalar1*Vector2*Vector3;
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>Vector1.add(  vector2.mul( Vector3 ).mul( scalar1 ) );
</code></pre>

<p>and not worry about construction new objects </p>

<p><strong>I made some tests:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>in C++ with -02 optimization I got fmul (fused multiply add) of double3 in 1 processor
tick </li>
<li>in java it took ~4-6 ticks if I used just local operations of
Vectro3f ( without allocation ) </li>
<li>and ~10 ticks when new object was created. Creation of new objects cannot be avoided sometimes due to architecture of Vectro3f class, and even worse with quaternions where components x,y,z,w are protected variables )</li>

<p>So basically I want to make a scroll box that works with images instead of text, I want it to be like I.M.D.B (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com</a>) just a long list of films and a description next to them.</p>

<p>The following is the example scenario of current code which is <strong>working</strong>,</p>

<p>1.) User select the customer's receipt by checkbox</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type='checkbox' class='customer_id' value='&lt;?php echo $entry-&gt;customer_id;?&gt;'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2.) Javascript read the customer(s) id then send those data to CodeIgniter. Once return data is received, fire callback function to display them target div</p>

<pre><code>var data;
var counter = 1;
$(.customer_id:checked).each(function(){
    data['customer_' + counter] = $(this).val();
})    
$.post('finance/getReceipt', data, function(){
    $('#some_target_div').html(data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>3.) CodeIgniter retrieve customer data from db and generate page</p>

<pre><code>function getReceipt(){
    $counter = 1;
    while ($this-&gt;input-&gt;post('customer_' + $counter)){
        $where['customer_id'] = $this-&gt;input-&gt;post('customer_' + $counter);
        $data += $this-&gt;getCustomerReciept($where);
    }
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;page('finance/receipt', $data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But now I need to convert this code to make it open a new blank page with a print button</p>

<p>The purpose of this is because I want to generate a formatted receipt and display in a new blank page with a print button. I know that there are several plugin that I can print a div but this is the request from my client. So, that's isn't a solution for me.</p>

<p>Any suggestion or comment will be great. Thank in advance.</p>

<p>On the backend, the socket.io only logs <code>warn  - websocket connection invalid</code>.</p>

<p>Note: I have nginx dev running: <code>nginx version: nginx/1.1.14</code> so it should support HTTP/1.1.</p>

<p>Also note that if I just use the node.js server without the nginx it works without any warnings.</p>

<p>Finally, here is my nginx config file:</p>

    private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(FirstClass.class);

    public void action(){
        LOG.info(""FirstClass.action."");

<p>the second class:</p>

    public void action(){
        FirstClass firstClass = new FirstClass();
        firstClass.action();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I will write unit test for these two classes, the first class unit test:</p>

<pre><code>public class FirstClassTest {
    @Test
    public void testAction(){
        FirstClass firstClass = new FirstClass();
        firstClass.action();
    }
}

<p>the second class unit test:</p>

<pre><code>public class SecondClassTest {
    @Mocked
    private Logger LOG;

    @Mocked
    private FirstClass firstClass;

    @Test
    public void testAction(){
        SecondClass secondClass = new SecondClass();
        secondClass.action();
    }
}  
</code></pre>

<p>About the second class unit test, As the second class depend on the first class, so I mocked the first class, at same time I also mocked Logger class.</p>

<p>I add a suite class to run these two classes:</p>

<pre><code>@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({SecondClassTest.class ,FirstClassTest.class})
public class TestAll {
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this suite class, it throw the follow exception:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.NullPointerException

<p>From this trace log, the LOG of first class has been mocked. but in fact I don't mock Logger in FirstClassTest class.</p>

<p>But when I changed this suite class, firstly run FirstClassTest.class, and then run SecondClassTest.class. all cases are successful.</p>

<pre><code>@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({FirstClassTest.class ,SecondClassTest.class})

}

<p>How to fix this issue and ensure that there is no effect between the two cases? Thanks! </p>

<pre><code>$('#brandsort').change(function(){
    $('#child_cat a').fadeOut(500);
    $('[value=""' + $(this).val() + '""]').fadeIn();
    if ($('#brandsort option:selected').text() === """") {

    }
});

<p>The code will filter out the products that do not match their option value, but it won't play the animation. Right now, it acts more like a delayed .show() / .hide() function than anything. Please enlighten me from any wrongdoing in my code or what I could possibly be doing wrong aside from that.</p>

<p>I know the people on SO would normally like some hands-on help from one of you, but in this case I was specifically only asking for ""enlightenment"". Just some verbal input of what I could have been doing wrong.</p>

<p>So I take as input from the user his couchbase URL, bucket name in which he wants to keep his doucments, Ramquota etc etc ... </p>

<p>But when he has multiple tables which he wants to replicate in Couchbase(used as caching layer on Oracle DB)... How should I represent table in it ... I mean buckets can't be equivalent to tables coz multiple buckets decrease performance. Also, for doc ID i use the primary key of the table the user is refering to, but then, even though there is a table name in the JSON which he can use in the view to query, if two tables have same ID's it would be a conflict ... So do I create primarykey + table name as the DOcumentID ... Or how do you represent tables in couchbase so that quering is easy for READS.</p>

<pre><code>enter code here{""table"": ""gj2"", ""type"": ""insert"", ""id"": ""3"", ""name"": ""xyz""}
</code></pre>

<p>So here primary key for table gj2 is id which I also use as document ID in bucket ""default"" , and I can't create multiple buckets for each tables ... So if now a second table comes with same primary key value = ""3"" ... It won't add it.</p>

<h3>What if a user closes the browser while uploading a file?</h3>

<p>Well, correct me if I'm wrong but I think the file will still be in your /tmp/ directory and will not be removed until the /tmp/ directory is cleaned up.</p>

<h3>So if I would like to resume an upload, what then?</h3>

<p>And this was the question I was not able to answer. That's why I've posted my question here. So in short: How can I resume a user's upload when he returns after closiing the browser or leaving the page?</p>

<h3>My form</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;form enctype=""multipart/form-data"" action=""upload.php"" method=""POST""&gt;
     Please choose a file: &lt;input name=""uploaded"" type=""file"" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Upload"" /&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt; 
</code></pre>

<h3>My PHP</h3>

<pre><code>if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $target = ""upload/""; 
     $target = $target . basename( $_FILES['uploaded']['name']);
     if (!move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploaded']['tmp_name'], $target)) {
        die (""There was a problem while uploading your file"");
     }
     header(""Location: index.php"");
     exit;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>The actual question</h3>

<p>A user takes the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>User selects a file</li>
<li>User uploads the form</li>
<li>User closes browser</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I want the following to happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>User returns</li>
<li>User selects same file</li>
<li>User submits form</li>
<li>Upload resumes at the point it stopped last time</li>
</ul>

<p>What i would like to know is if this is possible and how i can achieve this.</p>

'Chart1.Series(1).LabelToolTip = ""why"" 
</code></pre>

<p>Points I add to ser has tooltip but when i launch the app, i can't see tooltip.
If i uncomment the last line, i can see the tooltip.
I can put anything to replace ""why"" but i must put something or i couldn't see tooltip of point. So atm my code works but i dont understand why I need this line  </p>

<pre><code>Chart1.Series(1).LabelToolTip = ""why""
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to understand my code ^^</p>

<p>Thanks and sorry for my bad english</p>

<p>The class of the lock variable is wrapper around the POSIX mutex implementation. Because of the module operations, it is not possible to use atomic operations.</p>

<p>Is it possible that a gcc compiler with a O3 flag optimizes the code so that the assignment of current_id is moved before the lock?</p>

<pre><code>$f3-&gt;route('GET /datasets/read', function($f3) {
    $db = new DB\SQL('sqlsrv:Server=192.168.**.**;Database=test',""sa"",""*****"");

    $results = $db-&gt;exec('SELECT * FROM builds');
    var_dump($results);
});
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine. I see a nice dump of all the records in the <code>builds</code> table. So far so good.</p>

<p>The next thing I tried was using the ORM approach provided by the framework:</p>

<pre><code>$f3-&gt;route('GET /datasets/read', function($f3) {
    $db = new DB\SQL('sqlsrv:Server=192.168.**.**;Database=test',""sa"",""*****"");

    $builds =new DB\SQL\Mapper($db,'builds')
    $builds-&gt;load();
});
</code></pre>

<p>This, however, fails. The generated query has no fields (this is the exact query generated: <code>SELECT  FROM builds</code>), which results in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Internal Server Error</strong></p>
  
  <p>PDOStatement: [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL
  Server] Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'FROM':</p>
  
  <p><code>[call stack]...[/call stack]</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I doing something incorrectly here? I can't imagine there's a problem with the connection string, since it manages to retrieve data just fine when using the raw SQL approach. Is some sort of configuration needed to enable table to entity mapping?</p>

<p>I am following along with the guide provided <a href=""http://fatfreeframework.com/databases"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, for reference.</p>

<p>I have a method, <code>$this-&gt;Time-&gt;getTime();</code> which always logs an action, then returns true. When called from the browser, it works as expected: logs the action, then returns true.</p>

<p>I created a shell, <code>TimeShell</code>, in which I log another action <strong>only</strong> if <code>$this-&gt;Time-&gt;getTime();</code> returns true. Now, the weird thing is that the second action is logged, hence the method returned true, but the action from the method (which obviously had to run since it passed it and returned true) isn't logged.</p>

<p>Why isn't the first action logged when the method is called from the shell? (if it helps, the shell is run via a cron job on my server)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>After further testing, I found out that if I don't log the second action (the one in the shell), then the first action (in <code>$this-&gt;Time-&gt;getTime();</code>) is correctly logged. But I can't figure out why does Cake only log the last action from those which should be logged.</p>

<p>Moreover, it seems that only the DatabaseLogger behaves this way, FileLog logs both actions. Very weird.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>(I apologize for formatting...)  The phone data (which is actually phone and/or e-mail; I didn't design this database...) is roughly half-way between the ends of the template that are in my codepen.io example.  (The whole thing is really long and I didn't want to waste anyone's time with the whole, long thing.)  Originally, I was doing more <code>{{#if fieldThatShouldHaveData}} {{else}}</code> but took that out for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>At first, I had named the object ""phone"" and thought that maybe ""phone.PHONE"" was too ambiguous, but ""this.PHONE"" and renaming it to phoneObj didn't change anything.  This is all within a huge <code>{{#each this}}</code> that prints the rows of the table.  I'm not using any tags that I don't use earlier in the template without incident, and I did confirm that it's legal for me to nest if's and etc.</p>

<p>Incidentally, even if I comment out those lines with <code>{{! if xyz}}</code> I still get the same error, citing the same line.</p>

<p>I'm also having the problem of my outermost <code>{{#each}}</code> looping in such a way that only the last record returned is being output through the template.  Everything logs in <code>{{log this}}</code> after that opening <code>{{#each}}</code> , but it's not even hiding in the HTML output somewhere.</p>

<p>I AM new to templating, so those of you who've done it before may think this is a stupid question.  I've done what I can with the documentation available, but much of the handlebars official documentation seems to presume familiarity with templating.</p>

The tiles rectangle doesnt seem to react at all when my player touches it.
What i do to apply the rectangle to the tile when generating the map:</p>

<pre><code>public void GeneratorCollision(int[,] mapCollision, int size)
    {
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; mapCollision.GetLength(1); x++)
        {
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; mapCollision.GetLength(0); y++)
            {
                int number = mapCollision[y, x];

                if(number &gt; 0)
                collisionTiles.Add(new CollisionTiles(number, new Rectangle(x * size, y * size, size, size)));

            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The Tile class looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Tile
{
    protected Texture2D texture;
    Rectangle rectangle;

    //collision rectangle
    public Rectangle Rectangle
    {
        get { return rectangle; }
        protected set { rectangle = value; }
    }


    private static ContentManager content;
    public static ContentManager Content
    {
        protected get { return content; }
        set { content = value; }
    }

    public void Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch)
    {
        spriteBatch.Draw(texture, rectangle, Color.White);
    }


}

class CollisionTiles : Tile
{
    public CollisionTiles(int i, Rectangle newRectangle)
    {
        texture = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(""Tile"" + i);
        this.Rectangle = newRectangle;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So i should be able to test the collision by simply doing</p>

<pre><code>if(player.Rectangle.Intersects(tile.Rectangle))
</code></pre>

<p>but it doesn't seem to work. I made another class called Crate and the collision worked perfect with that class, so again there must be something wrong within the Tile class, because the tile.Rectangle seems to be null and i can't find any solution :/</p>

<p>My Map class(the class that generates the map) looks like:</p>

<pre><code>class Map
{
    List&lt;Tile&gt; collisionTiles = new List&lt;Tile&gt;();

    public List&lt;Tile&gt; CollisionTiles
    {
        get { return collisionTiles; }
    }



    public Map()
    {

    }

    public void GeneratorCollision(int[,] mapCollision, int size)
    {
        //Layer1
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; mapCollision.GetLength(1); x++)
        {
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; mapCollision.GetLength(0); y++)
            {
                int number = mapCollision[y, x];

                if(number &gt; 0)
                collisionTiles.Add(new CollisionTiles(number, new Rectangle(x * size, y * size, size, size)));

            }
        }
    }

    public void Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch)
    {         
            foreach (CollisionTiles tile in collisionTiles)
            {
                tile.Draw(spriteBatch);
            }
    }

}

<p>I've played around with the Mutable types trying to get it working but haven't had any luck. Elsewhere I do use the mutable types for a json column which is fine - in a way that seems simpler though because with these classes you need to track changes to objects within the objects too.</p>

<p>Any thoughts appreciated.</p>

<p>In the custom binding I loop through an array and create nodes (<em>i.e.</em>, HTML elements) for each element (usually an observable but doesn't have to be), then I set the value and attributes of that dynamically-created node to that of context observable/object.</p>

<p>However, when I call <code>ko.dataFor</code> on one of these dynamically-created nodes I receive the <em>outer</em> observableArray that was specified rather than the inner observable which I'm using for that specific node.</p>

<p>In my head, this makes sense because I haven't actually attached a more specific observable (or object of any kind) to this dynamically-created node.</p>

<p>So my question is, inside a custom binding how do I attach data to a node? Or to put it another way, what's the <em>opposite</em> of <code>ko.dataFor</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've tried using</p>

<pre><code>ko.utils.domData.set(elmnt, ""data"", currentObservable);
</code></pre>

<p>And then when I call</p>

<pre><code>ko.utils.domData.get(element, ""data"");
</code></pre>

<p>I get the observable back again. However, <code>ko.dataFor</code> still returns the outermost observable which was bound to the containing element, which makes me feel that I'm not using the correct methodology here.</p>

<p>And just to be clear, when I say ""containing element"" I'm referring to the only DOM element which existed when <code>ko.applyBindings</code> was called; this is the element which has the <code>data-bind</code> attribute. All the other (inner) elements are then added by the custom binding.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: This question was written in relation to a Knockout custom binding that I've been writing. This custom binding can be viewed <a href=""https://raw2.github.com/Supertext/knockout.groupedOptions/master/knockout-groupedOptions.js"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Specifically, towards the end of the javascript file you can see that I've used</p>

<pre><code>ko.utils.domData.set(option, ""data"", thisOption);
</code></pre>

<p>and in the ""init"" handler near the top of the file I've retrieved this using</p>

<pre><code>ko.utils.domData.get(node, ""data"");
</code></pre>

<p>What I'd really like to know is, is this the ideal approach for 'storing' the observable data with the element for later retrieval? And why can't I use <code>ko.dataFor</code> against this method of 'storing'?</p>

<p>I see that in TLS handshake the expired certificate is send by Tomcat connector.<br>
But the client (i.e. the TrustManager) does not reject the connection.<br>
Is this the default behavior?<br>
Am I suppose to configure the trustmanager somehow to check for expiration?  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>
I found that the actual TrustManager used is X509TrustManagerImpl. Here <a href=""http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Modules-sun/security/sun/security/ssl/X509TrustManagerImpl.java.java-doc.htm"">X509TrustManagerImpl</a> says that this class has a minimal logic.May be I am using the wrong TrustManager?  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong>
From the javadoc <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager.html"">X509TrustManager</a> it is not clear if it checks for certificate expiration  </p>

<li>The controller I call here isn't a Modal Instance controller but my global <code>loginCtrl</code>, is this a problem? should I subclass somehow the loginCtrl or call it from the ModalInstanceCtrl? and if so - how exactly?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll be glad for guidance and clarfication about this.
Thanks!</p>

<p>So I have created a table in APEX that has a PK that is incremented by a SQL sequence:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE SEQUENCE seq_increment
MINVALUE 1
START WITH 880    
INCREMENT BY 1
CACHE 10
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work perfectly. The issue is that sometimes, usually when I get on in the morning and run a process to enter a new row, it skips a bunch of numbers. I only care because these numbers are being used as the ID# of documents in my company and losing/skipping blocks of numbers is not going to be acceptable when this tool goes live. </p>

<p>It does seem to jump to the next '10' number. i.e. yesterday my last test assigned 883 and this morning it assigned 890 as the next number. Looking at my code for creation of the sequence I notice that I have set it up to cache 10 values so that it will process quicker. Is it possible that this cache is getting dumped over night and that it is pulling 890 because it had 880-889 in cache and it was dumped? </p>

<p>Are there other potential causes and solutions? Let me know what you guys think. </p>

<p>Anyway,
This is the sql I wrote.  It returns the expected results of quests not yet completed by the user that are unlocked and within the users level requirements:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT writing_quests . *

LEFT OUTER JOIN members_quests_completed ON members_quests_completed.quest_id = writing_quests.id
LEFT OUTER JOIN members ON members.id = $user_id

AND members_quests_completed.user_id IS NULL 
</code></pre>

<p>This is the codeigniter active record query, it returns all quests that are unlocked and within the users level requirement:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;db-&gt;select('writing_quests.*');
$this-&gt;db-&gt;from('writing_quests');
$this-&gt;db-&gt;join('members_quests_completed', 'members_quests_completed.quest_id = writing_quests.id', 'left outer');
$this-&gt;db-&gt;join('members', ""members.id = $user_id"", 'left outer');

$this-&gt;db-&gt;where('writing_quests.level_required &lt;=', $userlevel);   
$this-&gt;db-&gt;where('members_quests_completed.user_id is null', null, true);

<p>I'm saving some data and before writing it to a file I convert it to binary and store it in array, which I encrypt and then write to file. I encrypt data in chunks (32 bytes). In the same way I read data in chunks of 32 bytes and then decrypt that data and then this should repeat till the end of file. But when it comes to decryption the following error is thrown:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Padding is invalid and cannot be removed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use the same key and iv (hardcoded just until I get it working)</p>

<p>Here is my encryption code, which works without problems:</p>

<pre><code>        //result
        byte[] data = new byte[32];

        //setup encryption (AES)
        SymmetricAlgorithm aes = Aes.Create();
        byte[] key = { 145, 12, 32, 245, 98, 132, 98, 214, 6, 77, 131, 44, 221, 3, 9,50};
        byte[] iv = { 15, 122, 132, 5, 93, 198, 44, 31, 9, 39, 241, 49, 250, 188, 80, 7 };
        ICryptoTransform encryptor = aes.CreateEncryptor(key, iv);

        FileStream fStream = new FileStream(file, FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read, 1024, false);

        //prepare data to write (byte array 'data') ...

        //encrypt
               MemoryStream m = new MemoryStream();
               using (Stream c = new CryptoStream(m, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
                   c.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
               data = m.ToArray();
               fStream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my decryption code:</p>

<pre><code>FileStream fStream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read, 4096, false);

            //setup encryption (AES)

            ICryptoTransform decryptor = aes.CreateDecryptor(key, iv);

            //result
            byte[] data = new byte[32];

            //loop for reading the whole file ...
            int len = fStream.Read(data, 0, 32);

            //decrypt

                data = m.ToArray();

                //using the decrypted data and then looping back to reading and decrypting...

<p>I tried all I could think of (which is not much because I'm very new to cryptography), I searched everywhere and I couldn't find a solution to my problem. I also helped myself with the book <em>C# in a Nutshell</em> .</p>

<p>If anyone has ideas on why this could happen I'll be really thankful because I have no ideas.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and answers.</p>

<p>EDIT:
It seems that the size of the encrypted data is 48 bytes (12 bytes more than the original). Why is that so? I thought that it only adds bytes if they are not a multiple of the block size (16 bytes, my data is 32 bytes). Is data always larger, and with constant increase (I need to know that in order to properly read and decrypt).</p>

<p>Note: I can't directly use other streams because I need to have control over the output format and I believe it is also safer and faster to encrypt in memory.</p>

<ol>
<li>every text line is inside a gettext function ( <code>__</code> and <code>_e</code> )</li>
<li>using poedit i created the .po and .mo file scanning the plugin directory (everythig went ok), then i added translations on that file.</li>
<li>i named the .po file like that NAME-OF-THE-PLUGIN-it_IT.po (the .mo file was generated with the same name)</li>
<li>i've put the translations files inside the plugin folder/languages (name of the folder is the same of the plugin and of the translations files)</li>
<li>then i've tried to add the <code>load_plugin_textdomain</code> function inside the main plugin file. I've tried because there's no way to get it working.</li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing on wich i'm not sure is the fact that the plugin i've created is not under a class+constructor funcions... just because i'm still not so good in coding.</p>

<p>But i've put the <code>load_plugin_textdomain</code> inside an <code>init add_action</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>add_action('init', 'gw_load_translation_file');

function gw_load_translation_file() {
// relative path to WP_PLUGIN_DIR where the translation files will sit:
$plugin_path = dirname(plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) .'/languages' );
load_plugin_textdomain( 'gallery-view-for-wordpress', false, $plugin_path );
}
</code></pre>

<p>the lines above are not inside a logic, they are just in the main plugin file, like that.</p>

<p>this is an example of my use of gettext functions:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;?php _e('Panel Options','gallery-view-for-wordpress') ?&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>what did i not understand?</p>

It's done in storyboard and the problem is that when I put the code in viewDidLoad the pushes works but I can't see the rootviewcontroller from the storyboard but if I move the code into the init with coder I can see the viewcontroller but the push return's nil in the method that's supposed to push to a new vc, so the transition never happens. </p>

<p>The code looks like follows:</p>

<pre><code>    if (emp == nil) {
        [self gotoRegisterView];

</code></pre>

<p><em>Question 1</em></p>

<p>I am having a hard time understanding why 'header h2' still seems to stretch the entire 'header', even though margins and padding are 0;</p>

<p>What I know:
adding a 'position:absolute' or 'float:[left|right]' value to 'header h1' will free it of the stacking order and free up 'nav' vertically.</p>

<p><em>Question 2</em></p>

<p>If I want to make 50% of 'nav' to stick out of banner I figured that I would add this to the code. or another jsfiddle <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/CodeAmend/3atm5a4v/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jsfiddle.net/CodeAmend/3atm5a4v/</a></p>

<pre><code>header, header h1 { position: absolute;}
nav { margin-top: 75px;}
main {  background: red;
        width: 500px;
        height: 100px;
        margin-top:100px;}
</code></pre>

<p>What happens is it all looks good until I add a top margin to main. It seems to go behind the header. Well this makes sense, since it is absolute. So if I add 'margin-top: 100px' to 'main' now it hides behind the header.</p>

<p>I head that making things absolute ruins the fluidity of a page. I want to make responsive designs eventually and I want to have good habits. So am I going about this right at all? What do you recommend?</p>

<p>I have created a custom UIWindow that I place over the status bar with a transparent background color.</p>

<p>When rotating, blacks bars appear and I don't know why:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CKroG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fUKdD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This only happens on <strong>iOS 6</strong>, whereas my device with <strong>iOS 5</strong> does not display the black bars.</p>

<p>In the <strong>AppDelegate</strong>, I create a <strong>UIWindow</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) GRWStatusBarOverlayWindow *statusBarWindow;

CGRect statusBarFrame = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarFrame];
self.statusBarWindow = [[GRWStatusBarOverlayWindow alloc] initWithFrame:statusBarFrame];
self.statusBarWindow.hidden = NO;
</code></pre>

<p>I set the <strong>rootViewController</strong> of the status bar window to a dummy <strong>UIViewController</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>@interface GRWStatusBarRootViewController : UIViewController

@interface      GRWStatusBarOverlayWindow : UIWindow
@implementation GRWStatusBarOverlayWindow

- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame
{
    self = [super initWithFrame:frame];
    if (self)
    {
        self.rootViewController = [[GRWStatusBarRootViewController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];

        self.windowLevel = UIWindowLevelStatusBar + 1.0f;
        self.frame = frame;

        self.statusBarView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
        self.statusBarView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:1.0 green:0.0 blue:0.0 alpha:0.25];
        [self addSubview:self.statusBarView];
    }
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried both with and without a Nib, and some other approaches, without complete success.</p>

<p>The closest I have gotten is if I leave the <strong>rootViewController</strong> *<em>nil</em>*, and then I do get rotations without the black bars, however I do get a message:</p>

<pre><code>Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch
</code></pre>

<p>I always prefer to have clean builds and executions without any errors or warnings, so I would like to find a solution that removes that message and the black bars. However, if that message is harmless, I will accept it, although then I have to wonder what other problems might result down the road.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any insight into this problem? Any guidance or direction would be appreciated.</p>

I cannot figure out how to add tool tips to each of the rectangles showing information about the data which that rectangle represents. I looked at the developer documentation for <code>NSView</code> and have added the following code:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)view:(NSView *)view stringForToolTip:(NSToolTipTag)tag point:(NSPoint)point userData:(void *)data
{

    // use the tags to determine which rectangle is under the mouse
    if (tag == blueTag) {
        return NSLocalizedString(@""The Blue rectangle"", @"""");
    }
    if (tag == redTag) {
        return NSLocalizedString(@""The Blue rectangle"", @"""");    
    }
    // we should never get to here!
    return NSLocalizedString(@""Unknown tooltip area"", @"""");
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>// add tooltips for the rectangles (in my  drawRect method 
// after the rects have been initialized etc.)
[self removeAllToolTips];
redTag = [self addToolTipRect:startingRect owner:self userData:NULL];
blueTag = [self addToolTipRect:blueRect owner:self userData:NULL];
</code></pre>

<p>I run into two issues:<br>
1) when I print out the tag for the tooltips, they both show <code>1</code> as the tag even though they are for two different rectangles.<br>
2) the <code>stringForToolTip</code> method is never called</p>

<p>Any help/suggestions would be great. Thanks!</p>

<li><p>A.java reads from the input stream of the Process object using a bufferedreader</p></li>
<li><p>A.java outputs the data read from the input stream to a file (<code>output.txt</code>)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The B.o binary simply prints random lines using printf function call.</p>

<p>Now, if I run the above setup, I receive all the data sent by <code>B.o</code> flawlessly. Then to test (the blocking / nonblocking thing), I changed the <code>A.java</code> to sleep for 5 milliseconds after every read from the inputstream of the Process object of <code>B.o</code>. As it turned out, now I wasn't receiving the complete data in <code>A.java</code> send by <code>B.o</code>. This indicates that the communication channel being used is non-blocking (as per my weak understanding).</p>

<p>Then just to make sure, I started looking at the source code of java to see if I was right. And I have found the following so far:</p>

<p>Every call to <code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)</code> ends up in <code>forkAndExec()</code> method in <code>ProcessImpl_md.c</code>. In ProcessImpl_md.c the command is executed, a process is created, and PIPES are setup for communication (using the pipe function call in c). I can't find anywhere in the source code where the <strong>PIPES</strong> are being set to nonblocking mode (as indicated by my code). I am assuming the <strong>PIPES</strong> are blocking by default.</p>

<p>I know this is a very bad way to check what I want to check. I am way out of my depth here and I am just head-banging uselessly, I think. </p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction or tell me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are the <strong>PIPES</strong> of a process created through java runtime API are blocking or non-blocking?</p></li>
<li><p>When I make <code>A.java</code> sleep after reading from the input stream, why all data is not received? (Assumption being that the PIPE is blocking)</p></li>
<li><p>Any non-programmatic way (i.e. I don't have to change the source code of java and etc!) to figure out if the <strong>PIPES</strong> of a process are blocking or non-blocking?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>EDIT: (added code)</p>

<p>Following is not the actual (or even compilable) code but it shows what i am trying to do.</p>

<p>Source of ""B.o"":</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void main(int argc, char*argv[]){
    int a = 0;
    for(; a&lt;9000000; a++){
        printf(""%s"", argv[1]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Source of ""A.java"":</p>

<pre><code>&lt;java imports&gt;
public class A{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""./B.o"");
        BufferedReader br = new 
            BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
        int a = 0;
        while(br.readLine() != null){
            a++;
            Thread.sleep(5);//data missed if this line not commented out
        }
        br.close();
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>PLEASE CHECK MY ANSWER. USELESS QUESTION BY ME.</p>

<p>I have a python script that Windows Scheduler runs every 5 minutes for me.  The script works fine but every time it runs it's loading up the console really quick on my desktop before it automatically closes.  Does anyone know how to remove this behavior?  I'd like it to just run in the background without me knowing.</p>

<pre><code>public interface DbMapper{
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then this implementation:</p>

<pre><code>public interface NameDbMapper extends DbMapper {

    @SqlUpdate(""insert into names (name) values (:name)"")
    void insert(@Bind(""name"") String name);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This implementation exists in a module, so I don't know all DbMappers at compile time. I discover DbMappers through reflection:</p>

<pre><code>public class GuiceModule extends AbstractModule{

    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        Reflections reflections = new Reflections(""com.company"");
        Set&lt;Class&lt;? extends DbMapper&gt;&gt; dbMappers = reflections.getSubTypesOf(DbMapper.class);

        for (Class&lt;? extends DbMapper&gt; dbMapper : dbMappers) {
            Class&lt;DbMapper&gt; db = (Class&lt;DbMapper&gt;) dbMapper;
            binder().bind(db).toProvider(DbMapperProvider.class);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then I instansiate mappers in my provider:</p>

<pre><code>public class DbMapperProvider implements Provider&lt;DbMapper&gt; {

    private final User user;

    @Inject
    public DbMapperProvider(User user) {
        this.user = user;
    }

    @Override
    public DbMapper get() {
        String jdbc = user.getJdbc();

        DBI userSpecificDatabase = new DBI(jdbc, ""user"", ""password"");
        //How to replace NameDbMapper.class here with the db variable in GuiceModule?
        DbMapper dbMapper = userSpecificDatabase.onDemand(NameDbMapper.class);
        return dbMapper;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>User is a @RequestScoped instance, so I can't create providers regularly in GuiceModule. Injecting User works but how do I pass which Class DBI should use instead of hardcode NameDbMapper in DbMapperProvider here?</p>

<p>I've tried the approach suggested in <a href=""http://google-guice.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/inject/assistedinject/FactoryModuleBuilder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-guice.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/inject/assistedinject/FactoryModuleBuilder.html</a> but couldn't get it to work.</p>

<p>The goal here is that modules shouldn't have to write their own providers, is this achievable?</p>

I want to produce a view that shows all user profiles and one row per user with all their profile fields combined in one row. I have gotten this to work in views... YAY. However, when I try to use it on the live site with 900+ users (3 profiles each) it fails to execute (white screen). If I limit it to 100 results it works. So I was thinking maybe I could hard code a db_query to make it quicker. Two part question:</p>

<p>First I tried to paste the query into phpmyadmin with a few modifications <a href=""http://hastebin.com/raw/nuyalidumo"" rel=""nofollow"">(See it here)</a> </p>

<p>What happens almost works... the profile UID and Profile Types show up right. However the other fields all have ""profile2"" as data. I know this is an error with my query but I am unsure how to modify the 'profile2' part of the query to produce the data i want. </p>

<p>Second question.... any ideas on how to make this more efficient since I wont be using views?</p>

<p>When I delete a Justification, deletes two things. The justification and the DocumentsProduct associated.</p>

<p>Justifications Controller:</p>

<pre><code>class JustificationsController extends AppController {

  public function delete($id = null) {

    $this-&gt;Justification-&gt;id = $id;
    if ($this-&gt;Justification-&gt;delete()) {                        
      $valorNull = null;
      $this-&gt;Justification-&gt;DocumentsProduct-&gt;updateAll(
        array('DocumentsProduct.justification_id' =&gt; $valorNull),
        array('DocumentsProduct.justification_id' =&gt; $id));
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Justification Model:</p>

<pre><code>public $hasMany = array(
  'DocumentsProduct' =&gt; array(
    'className' =&gt; 'DocumentsProduct',
    'foreignKey' =&gt; 'justification_id',
    'dependent' =&gt; false,
    'conditions' =&gt; '',
    'fields' =&gt; '',
    'order' =&gt; '',
    'limit' =&gt; '',
    'offset' =&gt; '',
    'exclusive' =&gt; '',
    'finderQuery' =&gt; '',
    'counterQuery' =&gt; ''
    )
  );
</code></pre>

<p>DocumentsProduct Model:</p>

<pre><code>public $belongsTo = array(  
  'Justification' =&gt; array(
    'className' =&gt; 'Justification',
    'foreignKey' =&gt; 'justification_id',
    'conditions' =&gt; '',
    'fields' =&gt; '',
    'order' =&gt; ''
    )
);

<p>So, if I delete a Justification in the justification/delete view, deletes both, Justification and DocumentProduct. But the dependent is in false.
I try $this->Justification->delete($id, false), but still deletes DocumentsProduct.</p>

    }

</code></pre>

<p>What it does is it checks $parent_categories array for category names, if there's a new name it will use that (array value), else it will just use the old name (array key).
I hope i made my intentions clear.
What goes wrong is when i execute the code it only adds the parent categories i.e.'targetaudience' and 'productgroup', when i delete those parent-categories via the WordPress categories-page it deletes them and adds all the other categories right after. That can't be normal behavior.</p>

<p>Any help is really appreciated!</p>

<p>EDIT : I checked the database, after the script is executed, all categories are added to the database. But when i check the WP-categories page it shows the parent-categories and allot of empty pages, it says '266 items' and '14 pages' but those pages are empty. Only when i delete or edit any one category the rest appears. Sometimes the last parent-category isn't even added although it is there when i echo it from the loop so something got to be going wrong when adding the category.</p>

<pre><code>{ Called for each supported locale. }

end;

procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
   EnumSystemLocales(@LocalesCallback, LCID_SUPPORTED);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the callback is only being called once. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>EnumSystemLocales</code> <em>is</em> returning true, indicating success.</p>

<p>The remarks of <code>EnumSystemLocales</code> says that my callback must return <strong>true</strong> to continue enumerating (or more correctly, must not return <strong>false</strong> to continue enumerating):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The function enumerates locales by passing locale identifiers, one at
  a time, to the specified application-defined callback function. This
  continues until all of the installed or supported locale identifiers
  have been passed to the callback function or the callback function
  returns FALSE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317822%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation of the callback function</a>:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL CALLBACK EnumLocalesProc(
  __in  LPTSTR lpLocaleString
);
</code></pre>

<p>a commenter has come across a problem with the definition of ""not false"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This function must return 1, not (DWORD) -1 to continue processing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes me think that delphi's definition of </p>

<pre><code>True: BOOL;
</code></pre>

<p>is different than Window's. (That's why i tried a return value of <code>BOOL(1)</code> - which still fails).</p>

<p>Next i wonder if it's not even supposed to be <code>stdcall</code>. </p>

<p>Either way, can someone suggest how, in Delpi, to call <code>EnumSystemLocales</code>?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Also tried: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>Result := BOOL(-1);</code></li>
<li><code>Result := BOOL($FFFFFFFF);</code></li>
<li><code>Result := BOOL(1);</code></li>

At the moment we have every drawable object draw itself with a call to glDrawArrays(). Blend mode is on, we really need it. Without disabling blendmode, how would we improve performance for this app?</p>

<p>For instances, if we now draw 3 textures (1024x1024, 256x512, 256x512) across the whole screen, the app only gets 15FPS, which is really slow I think? Are we doing something terribly wrong? Our drawing code (for each drawable), is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) draw {
    GLuint textureAvailable = 0;
    if(texture != nil){
        textureAvailable = 1;
    }

    glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture.name);

    glVertexAttribPointer(ATTRIB_VERTEX, 2, GL_FLOAT, 0, 0, vertices);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(ATTRIB_VERTEX);

    glVertexAttribPointer(ATTRIB_COLOR, 4, GL_FLOAT, 1, 0, colorsWithMultipliedAlpha);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(ATTRIB_COLOR);

    glVertexAttribPointer(ATTRIB_TEXTUREMAP, 2, GL_FLOAT, 1, 0, textureMapping);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(ATTRIB_TEXTUREMAP);

    //Note that we are NOT using position.z here because that is only used to determine drawing order
    int *jnUniforms = JNOpenGLConstants::getInstance().uniforms;
    glUniform4f(jnUniforms[UNIFORM_TRANSLATE], position.x, position.y, 0.0, 0.0);
    glUniform4f(jnUniforms[UNIFORM_SCALE], scale.x, scale.y, 1.0, 1.0);
    glUniform1f(jnUniforms[UNIFORM_ROTATION], rotation);
    glUniform1i(jnUniforms[UNIFORM_TEXTURE_SAMPLE], 0);
    glUniform2f(jnUniforms[UNIFORM_TEXTURE_REPEAT], textureRepeat.x, textureRepeat.y);
    glUniform1i(jnUniforms[UNIFORM_TEXTURE_AVAILABLE], textureAvailable);

    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Possible optimizations I think won't work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drawing geometry in batches
<ul><li>I'm only drawing 3 items and the FPS is 15, I don't think batching the geometry would work here because it's such a small number of calls for drawing that it doesn't matter if we kill 2/3 of those calls.</li></ul>
</li><li>Texture Atlas
<ul><li>Again, only drawing 3 textures. What I do wonder if it would matter (a lot) if we were to convert these to PVR? I haven't looked into it, but I must admit we're loading big PNGs at the moment. Is there any way to see if this is indeed the case, or is it easier just to check it out?</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>But please tell me if I'm wrong, I'm happy to hear any ideas.</p>

<h2>Proposed solutions</h2>

<h3>Mipmapped textures</h3>

<p>Loading mipmapped textures, doing it like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) initWithUIImage: (UIImage * const) image {
    glGenTextures(1, &amp;name);
    //JNLogString(@""Recieved name(%d), binding texture"", name);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, name);

    //Set the needed parameters for the texture
    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR); 
    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);

    //Load the image data into the texture

    glGenerateMipmap(GL_TEXTURE_2D);

    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't seem to do anything for our FPS, I think this is because our textures are already roughly at the size they are rendered to on the screen, in most cases even 1:1.</p>

<p><em>Other solutions are welcome! I will try them out and post the results here</em></p>

<a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=theinfiniteblack.client"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=theinfiniteblack.client</a></p>

<p>In my naivety, I was expecting moderate growth rate of about 1,000 players a month, and needing to manage ~20 live TCP/IP clients tops.</p>

<p>The game has had unexpectedly explosive growth with over 40,000 new users in a week, and is averaging ~300 live connections at once, and growing exponentially.</p>

<p>The server architecture consists of 2 threads per connection (blocking read/write), one ServerSocket thread to spawn off new clients, and one controller thread that polls each client for new actions, applies it to the game world, then flushes data back out when done.</p>

<p>The server is built in Java which I'm not very well versed in, particularly in a high-stress situation such as this. C# has really spoiled me when it comes to memory and thread management.</p>

<p>To get to the point.. I've just ordered two very powerful systems to run as dedicated game servers and want to maximize resource use. A lot of the information on Java resource configuration has proven to be misleading, incorrect, or out of date.</p>

<p>I currently use -Xss512k as my launch argument, and understand that this dictates stack size allotment for each thread, but I don't fully comprehend all that it may entail. What tools or methods are available to tell me if I'm overshooting the mark and can scale it down? What other command line arguments should I consider?</p>

<p>The new servers have 16gb of RAM and i7-2600K Sandy Bridge 3.4GHz processors: What options are available in configuration to take as much advantage of this as possible? My goal is 1,200 online clients at once per server (2,400 threads).</p>

<p>What kind of unexpected pitfalls and problems should I be concerned with?</p>

<p>I've read wildly conflicting stories on maximum thread counts: Will things fall apart if I'm trying to push 2,400 active threads?</p>

<p>Java doesn't seem like it was designed for this type of task. Should I consider migrating the server to another language?</p>

<p>I currently run the server in debug mode out of Eclipse while it's in development (ugh..)</p>

It's still pretty basic but I've managed to send and receive messages with a user Loged In with Spark and another at the emulator.</p>

<p>After some SO reading I decided to create a service for my XMPP connection that I bind to every Activity. I currently have three activities </p>

<ul>
<li>MainActivity ( user logIn and connection to XMPPconnection).</li>
<li>RosterActivity ( a listview containing the users contacts )</li>
<li>ChatActivity </li>
</ul>

<p>My question is twofold : </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it necessary to bind every activity to the Service, or would it be possible to just bind MainActivity to it and pass the XMPPConnection as an extra ? If so, how can the passing be done?</p></li>
<li><p>After I log in and start the RosterActivity, I bind the service in the onCreate() method. In the onStart method, if I check the mBound variable, it's always false. I've tried SystemClock.sleep() just to see if it would work and it didn't. What really puzzles me is that when I first wrote this Activity, I used a button that, when clicked, would start the procedure to populate the list. That worked perfectly. </p>

<p>So what is it that I am missing? I obviously don't want the user to have to press a button just to see the contacts, I want the list to be populated at onStart(). Why is the Service bound when I try to reach it from inside the onClickListener and why does it simply not work at onStart.</p>

<p>I'm guessing it has everything to do with the binding being asynchronous, but I'm trying to find out exactly what.</p></li>

They can search for Brand, Type, Hard Drive Capacity and other things. Once they click the search button, results are displayed in a repeater control. The DeviceID for each device is clickable and when clicked, it takes the user to another page that has all the details about that certain device. I want to be able to display the image for that certain device on that page, as well as all the other information. I have the image being saved as Image type in my SQL database. But I can't figure out how to get it out of my database and display it on the page. I've tried a few different approaches including displaying it in a grid control, which didn't work. I also tried using ASHX files but couldn't quite figure that one out either. I am using C# and ASP.NET. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If any code is needed, please let me know and I will be glad to post it. Thanks!</p>

I Use one connection for all queries. Thats so i will be able to run them all in transactions.</p>

<p>Every second I get a new set of files that has to be entered into a SQL Server 2005 Express.</p>

<p>The Application can run for 24 to 36 hours and than suddenly get a ""EAccessViolation"" in a query.</p>

<p>This query is by then been executed for atleast 24 * 60 * 60 times.</p>

<p>I'm not shure if it also happens with querys without parameres because most of the queries (90%) has parameres. they are inserts/updates or select with a parameter(s).</p>

<p>when this occures all queries afterwards get the same EAccessViolation and after a while I get a StackOverflow. </p>

<p>While the code is constructed in sutch a manner that an exception will be handled and the next time the code should run without problems.</p>

<p>the fact that this is happening in varios queries (that did't change from the former version) with the only change that in stead of using dbGo from BCB Builder 2007 we did ADO with Cpp Builder 6.0.</p>

<p>I asume that it is someware in the Windows version MDAC(2.8) or in de dbGo from CodeGear. The fact that in the previous version (ADO BCB6.0)we did't run into it and now with (dbGO and BCB2007) we have is it making that part very suspicius.</p>

<p>I hope that some has some nice Ideas what could be the reason for all this.</p>

<p>At the moment I Can't reproduce it here on a desktop. I'm still trying to get it reproduced that will defibnitly give more info.</p>

<p>I'm open for suggestions.</p>

Since most dev are migrate from coding stateful class, we found some of stateless bean actually contain instance variables which themself are stateful.</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong, it shouldn't be too tough to write a unit test to verify that all the stateless bean defined in spring xml actually is stateless (i.e. bean shouldn't have any instance variable which never defined in spring xml). Before I will try myself to write one, wonder if there is any existing tool out there to check that?</p>

<p>On the lefthand side of the app, I have a slide out menu, similar to the Facebook and Path apps.  Selecting one of those table rows will slide the main webview back in and load the URL.</p>

<p>I've seen random crashes of WebCore from a Webthread, but I simply cannot understand how to solve it.  I tested for zombies and memory allocations, but the app always stays within 3-4MB live bytes.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's relevant, but there is significant ""hooks"" when the webview loads its page.  For example, within shouldStartLoad, I check for certain URLs and then call a JS function on the page.  I don't know if this may cause the crash.</p>

<p>The crash logs show different areas of webcore crashing.  I've added some of the latest variants below, but I'm not sure these are all of the possible variants.</p>

<p>In short, what is a WebCore crash?  Is it a bug within UIWebView that I can't do anything about? Thank you!</p>

<p>The query command allows the agent to specify any SQL SELECT statement, and the server will execute this statement (with a select-only sql user) and return the results. The server charges the agent based on how long the query took, and how big the returned resultset is.</p>

<p>I would like to use MySQL 5.7's new MAX_STATEMENT_TIME (<a href=""http://mysqlserverteam.com/server-side-select-statement-timeouts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mysqlserverteam.com/server-side-select-statement-timeouts/</a>) to limit the execution of the query based on the max time cost the agent specifies. However, the agent could simply set the MAX_STATEMENT_TIME to whatever they like in the query, which would override anything the server sets before executing the query.</p>

<p>While it reeks of a half-baked solution, I am considering simply scanning the supplied query and refusing to run any query with the MAX_STATEMENT_TIME keyword. This way, the server could theoretically run user-specified SELECT queries, while guaranteeing that its set MAX_STATEMENT_TIME will be obeyed.</p>

<p>So, the first part of my question is: is this a good idea? Am I missing something vital?</p>

The site has a login page that posts back to a login action, which logs the user in via FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie().  I am looking to add an api to the site, as an mvc2 area, where users would be authenticated based on a token passed as an http header.  This area will consist of only json actions, so redirecting the user to a login page doesn't make sense.  Instead, I want the users to just pass a token along with each request.  That token is mapped to each user account and the user would be authenticated automatically.  </p>

At this point, the best choice seems to be adding the header lookup logic and authentication to the Global.asax in the Application_AuthenticateRequest method.

                options.xAxis.categories.push(value.date); // date = 'mm/dd'
                options.series[0].data.push(value.val1); // val1 = integer

<p>The categories show up just fine on the x-axis (the dates), but nothing else shows up. If I hard code the data like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(e) {

    var options = {
        chart:{
            type:'line'
        },
        title:{
            text:'Line Chart'
        },
        xAxis:{
            title:'Date',
            categories:['08/16','08/17','08/18','08/19']
        },
        yAxis:{
            title:'Val1/Val2'
        },
        series:[{name:'Val1', data:[23, 56, 73, 12]}, {name:'Val2', data:[12, 65, 23, 49]}]
    };

    $.ajax({
        url:'includes/getData.php', // select * from 'myTable' order by date
        dataType:'json',
        success:function(data){
            $.each(data, function(index, value){
                //options.xAxis.categories.push(value.date); // date = 'mm/dd'
                //options.series[0].data.push(value.val1); // val1 = integer
                //options.series[1].data.push(value.val2); // val2 = integer
            });

            $('#chart').highcharts(options);
        }
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>it works perfectly. Notice i hardcoded the xaxis category array and the 2 series data arrays, and commented out the 3 lines in the ajax success handler where it populates using the data from the DB. </p>

<p>Not sure why it works hardcoded by not dynamically. I outputted the data arrays to the console in the success handler and the data is there, as expected.</p>

<p>Any thoughts whats wrong with this?</p>

    INDEX `price` (`price`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM ROW_FORMAT=DEFAULT

<p>This query extracts records within a 2 mile x 2 mile square area ....</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM prices1
WHERE lat &gt;= 55.9430 AND lat &lt;= 55.9641
AND lng &gt;= -3.2279 AND lng &lt;= -3.1901                 
AND price &gt;= 100000 and price &lt;= 400000
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 50
</code></pre>

<p>... it takes 0.8 seconds. <code>EXPLAIN</code> says it is using index 'price'. </p>

<p>If I use <code>force index(lat)</code> the query runs in 0.1 seconds - much faster but I'd really like it faster still.</p>

<p>The query will be run via a web-site with multiple users. All queries will be similar but with different ranges for lat, lng and price. Table write speed is not important.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest how I can speed up the query? Or at the least encourage MySQL to use index 'lat' when its a better choice (I'd rather not use 'force lat' as I found queries extracting from a larger area are better run using the 'price' index).</p>

<p>I've run 'ANALYZE' and 'OPTOMIZE'.</p>

<p>I've read up on MySQL 'order by indexation' - where the same index can be used for the 'WHERE' and 'ORDER BY' clauses but I dont think this can be used where the WHERE is a range?</p>

<p>Is it worth pursuing 'spacial indexes'?</p>

<p>Any ideas welcome as I really need to get this much faster.</p>

<p>I found out that I can use the variable ""data"" that I had declared locally but this makes the template less reusable because someone would have to name their dataset ""data"" specifically. Does segments have a field for getting the data values?</p>

To match up the thumbs with the large images I'm adding attributes to each thumbnail and large image. The attributes contain a number which matches each thumb to its corresponding large image. It works when one slideshow is present on a page. But I want it to work if more than one slideshow is present.</p>

<p>Here's the code for adding attributes to thumbs and large images:</p>

<pre><code>thumbNo = 0;
largeNo = 0;
$('.slideshow_content .thumbs img').each(function() {            
   thumbNo++;
   $(this).attr('thumbimage', thumbNo);
   $(this).attr(""title"", ""Enter image gallery"");
});
$('.slideshow_content .image_container .holder img').each(function() {   
   largeNo++;
   $(this).addClass('largeImage' + largeNo);
});
</code></pre>

<p>This works. To make the incrementation work when there are two slideshows on a page, I thought I could stick this code in an each function...</p>

<pre><code>$('.slideshow').each(function() {
    thumbNo = 0;
    largeNo = 0;
    $(this + '.slideshow_content .thumbs img').each(function() {            
       thumbNo++;
       $(this).attr('thumbimage', thumbNo);
       $(this).attr(""title"", ""Enter image gallery"");
    });
    $(this + '.slideshow_content .image_container .holder img').each(function() {   
       largeNo++;
       $(this).addClass('largeImage' + largeNo);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that the incrimenting operator does not reset for the second slideshow div (.slideshow), so I end up with thumbs in the first .slideshow div being numbered 1,2,3 etc.. and thumbs in the second .slideshow div being numbered 4,5,6 etc. How do I make the numbers in the second .slideshow div reset and start from 1 again?</p>

<p>This is really hard to explain concisely. I hope someone gets the gist.</p>

<p>The output of the NSLog when run through the simulator:</p>

<p>And then there's the standard error for the index out of bounds. I don't know if it's relevant or not, but two of my icons aren't loading on the device, either, though they work on the simulator. Let me know if you need any more code, or if you have questions about the app or its behavior, I'd be happy to add more.</p>

<p>I want to create a multithreaded android app. My problem is the communication between the threads. I read about communication between threads and I came across stuff like Looper/Handler design, which seemed quite involved and Atomic Variables like AtomicInteger. For now, I used AtomicInteger as a communication but since I am not very experienced in Java, I am not sure if that is bad in my case/ if there is a better solution for my particular purpose. Also I got a little suspicious of my method, when I noticed I need actually something like AtomicFloat, but it's not existing. I felt like I am missusing the concept. I also found that you can make yourself an AtomicFloat, but I am just not sure if I am on the right way or if there is a better technique. </p>

<p>Question:
<strong>Is it ok/good to use Atomic Variables and implement also AtomicFloat for my particular purpose (described below) or is there a better way of handling the communication?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Purpose/Architecture of the App using AtomicVariables so far:</strong></p>

<p>I have 4 Threads with the following purpose:</p>

<p>1.SensorThread: Reads sensor data and saves the most recent values in AtomicVariables like</p>

<pre><code>AtomicFloat gyro_z,AtomicFloat gyro_y, ...
</code></pre>

<p>2.CommunicationThread: Communication with the PC, interprets commands which come form the socket and set the state of the app in terms of a AtomicInteger:
    AtomicInteger state;</p>

<p>3.UIThread: Displays current sensor values from 
    AtomicFloat gyro_z,AtomicFloat gyro_y, </p>

<p>4.ComputationThread: uses sensor values <code>AtomicFloat gyro_z,AtomicFloat gyro_y, ...</code> and state <code>AtomicInteger state</code> to perform calculation and send commands over USB.</p>

<p>I have the following function which currently has two commands, who and the svcadm command I really want to run.</p>

<p>I am also aware that this code is very insecure and should never be exposed publicly.</p>

<pre><code>private function RestartApacheImmediately(){
    var_dump($this-&gt;exec_enabled());
    $output = array();
    $returnvar = """";

    var_dump($return);
    var_dump($returnvar);
}

<p>Both x and y are configured as Service Management profiles in /etc/user_attr .</p>

<pre><code>svcadm: Could not set restarter_actions/auxiliary_tty property of svc:/network/http:apache: permission denied.
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Resolution was as follows:</p>

<p>I got this to work by using the user_attr method I described above. However, what I discovered was that the httpd daemon was running as a different user than php reported upon executing the 'who' command. So it wasn't x or y, it was z.  I determined this by doing a simple ps -e while logged in as root at the shell.</p>

<p>My problem is with correctly formatting the XML in the flash tool. </p>

<p>The flash tool has a series of nested arrays witch i don't know if i can explain very well but i'll try.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WjfLj.jpg"" alt=""Visual representation of the object structure""></p>

<p>So I wrote this function to parse the arrays and export the XML:</p>

<pre><code>        public function exportGridBeta(event:MouseEvent):void {
        var nodeColumn:XML = new XML();
        var nodeRow:XML = new XML();
        var nodeCublet:XML = new XML();

        for each (var arrayRows in arrayColumns) {

            for each (var arrayTowers in arrayRows) {

                for each (var cublet in arrayTowers) {

                    nodeCublet = &lt;{arrayTowers.indexOf(cublet)}&gt;{cublet.shortColor}&lt;/{arrayTowers.indexOf(cublet)}&gt;

                    nodeRow = 
                        &lt;{arrayRows.indexOf(arrayTowers)}&gt;
                            {nodeCublet}
                        &lt;/{arrayRows.indexOf(arrayTowers)}&gt;

                    nodeColumn =
                        &lt;{arrayColumns.indexOf(arrayRows)}&gt;
                            {nodeRow}
                        &lt;/{arrayColumns.indexOf(arrayRows)}&gt;                            

                    miXML_01 = miXML_01.appendChild(nodeColumn);

                }
            }
        }

        var fileReferenceAdress:FileReference = new FileReference();
        fileReferenceAdress.save(miXML_01, ""Nivel_01.xml""); 
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Finally getting to my problem, the result of this is different from what i want and I've been trying different configurations of the xml nodes and for each order with no success.</p>

<p>Specifically, the last line would take all the alphabetical strings out, e.g., </p>

<p>Is there a way to fix this? 
Alternatively, i wonder if there is way to trim space within substrings of a string:</p>

<pre><code>今 天 f o o 天 气 b a r 好      -&gt;            今 天 foo 天 气 bar 好

<p>It returns bool false.</p>

<p>I have tried searching for the problem,one of the problem was cookies were not being set,
but my cookies are being set in the browser, under domain localhost. And I have tried using cookies on localhost earlier in a different project, without codeigniter, in which I was able to retrieve cookies on localhost.</p>

<p>Here <code>$_COOKIE['username']</code> would throw error invalid index 'username', <code>$this-&gt;input-&gt;cookie('username')</code> would return <code>bool(false)</code>. But I can see 'username' cookie in my browser.</p>

<p>Cookies set and retrieved are on different files.</p>

    $this-&gt;load-&gt;helper('cookie');

    $row['user']    = $this-&gt;input-&gt;cookie('username', TRUE);

    $row['id']      = $this-&gt;input-&gt;cookie('pid', TRUE);

<p>I set the cookies in a different file,</p>

<pre><code>setcookie(""username"",$user, time()+60*60*60*24*30);
setcookie(""email"",$handle, time()+60*60*60*24*30);

<p>Please ask for more information needed. I have used construct function(two underscores) in my controller, not in model.

<p><strong>What kind of limits are expectable ?</strong></p>

<p>Because I think this module is pushing the <code>Cypher</code> queries directly to the <code>node-java</code> module, what uses them directly with Neo4j java libs, I belief there shouldn't be any limits.</p>

<p>I feel it is dangerous to decide to use a lib what isn't maintained for about 2 years (see: <a href=""https://github.com/joewhite86/node-neo4j-embedded/tree/neo4j-2.x"" rel=""nofollow"">github</a>) - and it shouldn't be on <a href=""http://neo4j.com/developer/javascript/#_other_drivers"" rel=""nofollow"">Neo4j docs</a> if it isn't maintained (see: README.md dead link about API-Docs).</p>

<p>It looks like there could be a new trend to power up node.js support like first citizen languages by <a href=""http://orientdb.com/welcome-to-orientjs/"" rel=""nofollow"">other distributor(s)</a> for (in_memory) graph databases. Maybe Neo4j also should review this and the unmaintained node module (like OrentDB did). The trend had bin initiated by a <a href=""http://orientdb.com/orientdb-performance-challenge/"" rel=""nofollow"">benchmark-battle</a> between <a href=""https://www.arangodb.com/2015/07/multi-model-benchmark-round-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">ArangoDB</a> and OrientDB.</p>

<p>I would love to see an Node-Neo4j-embedded benchmark answer to the open source benchmark of ArangoDB - done by professional Neo4j people like OrientDB people had done. But note: They hadn't been fair enough (read the last lines about enabling <a href=""http://orientdb.com/orientdb-performance-challenge/"" rel=""nofollow"">query caches</a>...).</p>

<p>Or it has to be a new benchmark focused on most possible first citizens-like access by NodeJS. There are three possible solutions to test. I am not experienced enough to do such a test what would be really acceptable. But I would like to help by verifying this.</p>

<p><strong>Please support this call for action with comments and (several types of) answers. A better (native like access) and wider range of supporting in_memory and graph solutions would help the node community very much. A new benchmark would force innovation</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Short note about ArangoDBs benchmark</strong>: <em>They've tested the REST-APIs. But if you think about performance, you don't like to use a REST-API - you like to use direct library access.</em></p>

<p>The type of the object is an EF dynamic proxy for change tracking. Still, when calling <code>SaveChanges()</code> the properties of the unchanged XYZ987 car are read. I thought that change tracking would cause EF to only read the objects that were known to change, or am I missing something? Is there something else I need to add to enable change tracking?</p>

I am under the impression that the CPU will run fairly close to full speed, even in a VM. Are there virtual machine platforms that allow you to limit the CPU cycles?

<p><strong>update:</strong> yes, need to execute ssis on the fly.. and give back a message on the UI page ..telling the 'uploader' if his upload failed or not based on message that SSIS would give back to the application. </p>

However, a question that arose from my original question is:</p>

<p><strong>What is the most elegant regular expression (POSIX or Extended Regular) for birthyear-dates between 1900 and 2XXX that do NOT satisfy <code>YYYY-01-01</code></strong></p>

<p>I can come up with something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>(19|2[01])[0-9][0-9]-(1[012]-[0-9][0-9]|0[^1]-[0-9][0-9]|01-[123][0-9]|01-0[^1])
</code></pre>

<p>i.e., accept all years starting with 19, 20, or 21 and then allow every month >= 10 and all months > 01 with arbitrary day, and then finally all days in month <code>01</code> that are not <code>01</code>, but this is clearly not elegant.  It does, however, mimic the way an FTA would accept the word.</p>

<p>Is it possible to shorten this regex, possibly using extended regular expressions?</p>

<p>The task is: 
Make an OrangeTree class. It should have a  height method which returns its height, and a  oneYearPasses method, which, when called, ages the tree one year. Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think an orange tree should grow in a year), and after some number of years (again, your call) the tree should die. For the first few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that older trees produce more each year than younger trees... whatever you think makes most sense. And, of course, you should be able to countTheOranges (which returns the number of oranges on the tree), and pickAnOrange (which reduces the @orangeCount by one and returns a string telling you how delicious the orange was, or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year). Make sure that any oranges you don't pick one year fall off before the next year.</p>

<p>Here's my program:</p>

<pre><code>class OrangeTree

    def initialize
        @tree = ""orange tree""
        @age = 0
        @height = 0
        @fruit = 0
        @fruitPicked = 0
        puts ""your "" + @tree + "" is budding""
    end

    def age
        puts ""your "" + @tree + "" is #{@age} years old.""
        @age = @age
        oneYearPasses
    end

    def height
        puts ""your "" + @tree + "" is growing taller.""
        @height = @height
    end

    def fruit
        puts ""your "" + @tree + "" has #{@fruit} oranges.""
        @fruit = @fruit
    end

    def pickOrange
        puts ""pick how many oranges?""
        @fruitPicked = @fruitPicked + gets.chomp.to_i
        puts ""you picked #{@fruitPicked} oranges.""
    end


    def oneYearPasses
        if @age &gt;= 0
            @age = @age + 1
        end

        if @height &gt;= 0 and @height &lt; 20
            @height = @height + 1
        else
            puts ""your "" + @tree + "" is no longer growing taller.""
        end

        if @age &gt;= 3
            @fruit = @fruit + (@age * 2)
        end


        if @age &gt;= 3
            @fruitPicked = @fruitPicked + @fruitPicked
            @fruit = @fruit - @fruitPicked
        end
    end
end

<p>My question is why my instance variable @fruit isn't deducting the number of @fruitPicked? orange.fruit keeps outputting the number of oranges the tree grows. Thanks.</p>

<p>the ""playerstat"" table is empty at the first time, the ""players"" already have a choice of players and the table ""game"" also has an entry where the stats and the players can be assigned.
 
now i want that the players with the related stats should be listed. you can give each player points or other stats. that already works.</p>

<p>the entries in the ""playerstat"" (each player is here automatically as soon as data like points is filled in) and ""game"" table have one and the same relations code. the players have no relation code, because the game is always changing but the player remains the same.</p>

<p>my problem is that if a game is completed and a new game started and i put in data to the player then the points etc are again in the first gamestats. so the new data for the second game are added to the stats from the first game.</p>

<p>how do i get that the points are added to the respective stats that also had the relations code of game and stats?</p>

<p>here is my query:</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = $conn-&gt;prepare(""SELECT 
lt_player.name, lt_player.surname, lt_player.nickname, 
lt_player.number, lt_player.id as playerid, 
lt_playerstat.points, lt_playerstat.team_id, 
lt_playerstat.rel_code 
FROM
lt_player
LEFT JOIN lt_playerstat ON (lt_player.id = lt_playerstat.playerid)
</code></pre>

<p>what i actually need is a ""WHERE lt_playerstat.rel_code = 'lt_game.rel_code'"" and at the same time all available players. how can i do this?</p>

<p>here are my tables: </p>

<p>playerstats
  <code>id</code>
  <code>game_id</code>
  <code>team_id</code>
  <code>playerid</code>
  <code>points</code>
  <code>active</code> 
  <code>rel_code</code></p>

<p>player
  <code>id</code>
  <code>team_id</code>
  <code>name</code>
  <code>surname</code>

  <code>number</code></p>

<p>game
  <code>id</code> 
  <code>team_id</code>
  <code>date</code>
  <code>time</code>
  <code>rel_code</code></p>

<p>first game stats ""denny doodle"" has 4 points

<p>second game stats ""denny doodle"" has again 4 points because thats the stat of the first game and not the second because the relation to the game is missing i guess.

<pre><code>var answers = [],
    answer1 = { Id: 1, Text: '3-4 weeks ago' },
    answer2 = { Id: 2, Text: '1-2 weeks ago' },

    answer5 = { Id: 5, Text: '1-2 days ago' },
    answer6 = { Id: 6, Text: 'More than 1 month ago' };

answers.push(answer1);
answers.push(answer2);
answers.push(answer3);
answers.push(answer4);
answers.push(answer5);
answers.push(answer6);
</code></pre>

<p>I need to analyse the <code>Text</code> property of each item so that, after the sorting, the array looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>answers[0] = { Id: 6, Text: 'More than 1 month ago' }
answers[1] = { Id: 3, Text: '7-8 weeks ago' }
answers[2] = { Id: 4, Text: '5-6 weeks ago' }
answers[3] = { Id: 1, Text: '3-4 weeks ago' }
answers[4] = { Id: 2, Text: '1-2 weeks ago' }
answers[5] = { Id: 5, Text: '1-2 days ago' }

<p>The logic is that, the furthest away the date, the more high priority it is, so it should appear first in the array. So ""1-2 days"" is less of a priority then ""7-8 weeks"".</p>

<p>So the logic is that, I need to extract the number values, and then the units (e.g. days, weeks) and somehow sort the array based on those details.</p>

<p>Quite honestly I'm finding it very difficult to come up with a solution, and I'd appreciate any help.</p>

Regards the data I'm working with, it's coming back from a web service, and I don't have the ability to change the text. So I have to work with it as is.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use Plupload along with CodeIgniter. I tried uploadify before Plupload and it worked awesome, the main problem with uploadify is that it never sent the CSRF code, no matter what I used, this was really odd so I reviewed Plupload and I made it work as expected in matter of minutes. However, it ONLY works well with the HTML5 uploader and not with the Flash Uploader.</p>

<p>Reviewing the logs I found the reason why it was not working: while using the CodeIgniter File Uploading Class.</p>

<p>Since I'm doing a bulk image uploader I set it up to allow ""jpg,gif,png,jpeg"" but found that the uploader rejects the uploading petition since I'm uploading a wrong type_file (which I found is octet/stream - wtf?).</p>

<p>After the upload process, I was processing the image (generating thumbs, watermarks, cropping, etc) so if I set it to allow all file types, the image processing won't work at all.</p>

<p>What I was thinking was on doing something like upload the file (allowing octet/stream MIME TYPE) then convert it to image (with imagecreatefromstring and file_get_contents functions) and then process it individually.</p>

<pre><code>mvn help:active-profiles upload:upload -PdeployPoc -PuploadUpdate

<p>Its only executing 'uploadUpdate', I have tried everything i.e. -Pa,b; -P a,b etc etc.</p>

<p>Nothing seems to be working though maven shows following;</p>

<pre><code>The following profiles are active:

<p>I read somewhere that DB could be a good thing for such cases.</p>

<p>What do you think about this ?</p>

<p><strong>What am I trying to do ?</strong></p>

<p>This ""matrix"" represents a world. And each element is a 1mx1mx2m block who could be a different kind (water, mud, stone, ...) Some block could be empty too.</p>

<p>But the user should be able to remove blocks everywhere and change everything around (if they where water behind, it will flow through the hole for exemple.</p>

<p>In fact what I wish to do is not Minecraft be a really small clone of DwarfFortress (http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)</p>

<p><strong>Other interesting things</strong></p>

<p>In my model the groud is at level 10. It means that [0,10] is empty sky in most of cases.
Only hills and parts of mountains could be present on those layers.</p>

<p>Underground is basicaly unknown and not dug. So we should not have to add instances for unused blocks.</p>

<p>What we should add from the beginning to the model : gems, gold, water who could stored without having to store the adjacent stone/mood/earth blocks.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the game, <em>80%</em> of the cube doesn't need to be loaded in memory.</p>

<p>Each time we dig we create new blocks : the empty block we dug and the blocks around.</p>

<p>The only things we should index is :</p>

<ul>
<li>underground rivers</li>
<li>underground lakes</li>
<li>lava rivers</li>

However, I am a little concerned that sklearn/python might be too slow for a problem that could involve classifications of millions of websites. I have already trained the classifier on several thousand websites from DMOZ. 
The research framework is as follows:</p>

<p>1) The crawler lands on a domain name and scrapes the text from 20 links on the site (of depth no larger than one). (The number of tokenized words here seems to vary between a few thousand to up to 150K for a sample run of the crawler)
2) Run the sklearn multionmial NB classifier with around 50,000 features and record the domain name depending on the result</p>

<p>My question is whether a Python-based classifier would be up to the task for such a large scale application or should I try re-writing the classifier (and maybe the scraper and word tokenizer as well) in a faster environment? If yes what might that environment be?
Or perhaps Python is enough if accompanied with some parallelization of the code?
Thanks</p>

<p>The galleries work on my iMac, but not on iPhones, iPads, and other devices.</p>

<p>Strangely, the first gallery worked on a phone.  You could swipe with one finger to see photos to the end of the gallery.</p>

<p><b>THE PROBLEM</b><br></p>

<p>Galleries 2-6 didn't swipe on mobile devices.  After a few moments, I could swipe the images with two fingers.  But it took a few minutes.</p>

<p>I want the Photography galleries to scroll on the computer and swipe (one finger) on mobile devices.</p>

<p><b>THE SOLUTION?</b><br></p>

<p>I think the PortfolioJS JavaScript was using the id ""#gallery"".  I think the JavaScript did not support all six galleries when I added more id's (#gallery-2, #gallery-3, etc.). </p>

<p>So I changed the first gallery from id ""#gallery"" to ""#gallery-1"".  I used ""var gallery"" to create an array with all six gallery id's.  I don't know if this works yet.  I don't have an iPhone, iPad, or mobile device.</p>

<p>I am trying to understand how to work with combination of peer nodes</p>

<p>Part 1 of my question</p>

<p>I need help with putting together xpath expression, in order to fill a collection only with links, which have span as a peer node (exists).</p>

<p>a) Add to collection</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""font-weight:bold;padding-top:4px;padding-left:10px;text-align:left;white-space:nowrap;""&gt;
    &lt;a class=""LeftNavLink"" href=""find/all-years/alfa-romeo"" style=""margin-left:14px;""&gt;Alfa Romeo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=""font-weight:normal;""&gt; (121)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>b) Do not add to collection</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""font-weight: bold; padding-top: 4px; padding-left: 10px;""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""find?tags=convertible"" class=""LeftNavLink""&gt;Convertibles&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Part 2 of my question</p>

<p>What would be xpath expression, in order to fill a collection only with links, which have span as a peer node with specific attribute (ex. style=""font-weight"" not style=""font-weight:normal;"")</p>

<p>Here's what I want. Look at the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT xyz
)
JOIN ...
ORDER BY RANDOM()
</code></pre>

<p>I want to know the initial order of the <code>xyz</code> rows when the query is over. So I thought about something like this (pseudo SQL):</p>

<pre><code>iterator = 1;
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT iterator++, xyz
)
JOIN ...
ORDER BY RANDOM()
</code></pre>

<p>So afterwards my result set will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>iterator | some other data
--------------------------
5        | ...
1        | ...
6        | ...
8        | ...
4        | ...
2        | ...
7        | ...
3        | ...
</code></pre>

<p>So it would afterwards be possible to recreate the original order.</p>

<p>May you will now say: Why you don't simply use the <code>id</code> where you select <code>xyz</code>? Simple: There's no <code>id</code>. The <code>xyz</code> data is user input and I want to create an artificial <code>id</code> for that within the query.</p>

<p>I feel like I am missing an option, or misunderstanding a key concept of Entity Framework.  Any idea how to have the missing TableB generated with the T4? The EDMX file does show it, but for some reason it doesn't get generated into a .CS file with the two properties indicating the relationship.</p>

<p>The primary reason we need this, is we extended the EF6 T4 template to add some factory patterns to match our existing models. Because it doesnt generate a class for TableB, we dont get the autogenerated code that we are looking for.</p>

I tried Google but I can't find anything. Google page with good results will suffice.</p>

<p>I've just experienced a situation where my 2 plugins which had its layout changed and accommodated my needs and I want to make sure it doesn't happen again. Apart from having the main file in another location, is there a way to move along any CSS and JS files as well?</p>

<p>In Concrete5 CMS there is a nice way of doing this, by creating a new folder inside a block of an addon (may be regarded as a WP plugin), inside of which you can create copies of main file, any CSS and JS files and then you can simply edit them and choose that template for a page location you are using that block in.</p>

<p>I assume there is no such thing in Wordpress but how close can I get?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I found where I applied that advice on creating a new instance of the file then moving it to the theme directory.
The plugin in question was HL-Twitter. These are the plugin files:</p>

<pre><code>admin.php
archive.php
functions.php
hl_twitter.php
hl_twitter_archive.php
hl_twitter_widget.php
import.php
widget.php
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is the top contents (commented out) of the hl_twitter_widget.php:</p>

<pre><code>Widget Theme for HL Twitter
To change this theme, copy hl_twitter_widget.php
to your current theme folder, do not edit this
file directly.

Available Properties:
$before_widget
$after_widget
$before_title
$after_title
$widget_title
$show_avatars
$show_powered_by
$num_tweets: how many tweets to show
$tweets: array of $tweet
$tweet: object representing a tweet
$tweet-&gt;twitter_tweet_id
$tweet-&gt;tweet
$tweet-&gt;lat
$tweet-&gt;lon
$tweet-&gt;created
$tweet-&gt;reply_tweet_id
$tweet-&gt;reply_screen_name
$tweet-&gt;source
$tweet-&gt;screen_name
$tweet-&gt;name
$tweet-&gt;avatar
$user: represents the Twitter user (ONLY SET IF SHOWING A SINGLE USERS TWEETS!)
$user-&gt;twitter_user_id
$user-&gt;screen_name
$user-&gt;name
$user-&gt;num_friends
$user-&gt;num_followers
$user-&gt;num_tweets
$user-&gt;registered
$user-&gt;url
$user-&gt;description
$user-&gt;location
$user-&gt;avatar       
</code></pre>

<p>So I was wrong about copying the main file (in this case hl_twitter.php), but still - this enabled me to edit the file outside the plugin directory and the system somehow checks for its existence and picks it up if exists.
If this behavior something that is natively supported by Wordpress or it has been integrated in the plugin itself?</p>

Of course, the manager tells me that by dialog box or log file, but what if I would like to store results in a database? For example I would like to have in a database table a names of routines which allocated given blocks.</p>

<p>After reading a documentation of FastMM I know that since version 4.98 we have a possibility to be notified by manager about memory allocations, frees and reallocations as they occur. For example <code>OnDebugFreeMemFinish</code> event is passing to us a <code>PFullDebugBlockHeader</code> which contains useful informations.
There is one thing that <code>PFullDebugBlockHeader</code> is missing - the information if the given block was freed by the application.</p>

<p><strong>Unless <code>OnDebugFreeMemFinish</code> is called only for not freed blocks? This is which I do not know and would like to find out.</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that even hooking into <code>OnDebugFreeMemFinish</code> event I was unable to find out if the block was freed or not.</p>

uses
  FastMM4, ExceptionLog, SysUtils;


procedure MemFreeEvent(APHeaderFreedBlock: PFullDebugBlockHeader; AResult: Integer);
begin
//This is executed at the end, but how should I know that this block should be freed
//by application? Unless this is executed ONLY for not freed blocks.

  MyObject := TObject.Create;
end;

end.

<p>What I am missing is the callback like:</p>

<pre><code>procedure OnMemoryLeak(APointer: PFullDebugBlockHeader);

<p>After browsing the source of FastMM I saw that there is a procedure:</p>

<p>Should I get the current user in my base controller and pass it along everywhere? So all my services are not dependent on an interface ??</p>

<p>So in my base controller i create a property called:</p>

<pre><code>public UserProfile MyProfile {get {return //something here;}}
</code></pre>

<p>then send this property to any service, use this property in any db calls etc. UserProfile would be a strongly typed object.</p>

<p>Now the problem statement:</p>

<p>The above message comes with different port numbers many time. I did the research on the net and the people were suggesting to fallback to the older version of java to resolve the issue, in my case I downloaded and installed 1.6.0_45. now the above DDMS error is gone, but there arises a bigger problem now.</p></li>
<li><p>The Eclipse closes suddenly all by itself no message no error displayed or reported on the UI. but when I looked into the eclipse log file, I found the error is raised due to some java related library is not functioning.</p>

        uid = Column(INT, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
        dateRegistered = Column(TIMESTAMP)

<pre><code>Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails
</code></pre>

<p>I was expecting for my update of the uid value to chain to any connected Commands, or at least to succeed (there are not actually any commands in the table). I expected this because I explicitly indicate <code>passive_updates=False</code> which is the advice suggested by this python article:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.pythoncentral.io/sqlalchemy-association-tables/
</code></pre>

<p>I did try setting <code>passive_updates=True</code> just to see what would happen, and it seemed to have no effect. I've been banging on this for a very long time without any progress. Does anyone have any idea what is going on here?</p>

<p>In a single core CPU, it runs each process in the OS, jumping around from one process to another to utilize the best of itself. A process can also have many threads, in which the CPU core runs through these threads when it is running on the respective process.</p>

<p>Now, on a multiple core CPU, </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do the cores run in every process together, or can the cores run separately in different processes at one particular point of time? For instance, you have program A running two threads. Can a dual core CPU run both threads of this program? I think the answer should be yes if we are using something like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP"">OpenMP</a>. But while the cores are running in this OpenMP-embedded process, can one of the cores simply switch to other process?</p></li>
<li><p>For programs that are created for single core, when running at 100%, why is the CPU utilization of each core distributed? (ex. A dual core CPU of 80% and 20%. The utilization percentage of all cores always add up to 100% for this case.) Do the cores try to help each other by running each thread, of each process, in some ways?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My newsFeedNavigationController is just a subclassed UITableViewController (and the subclass is not interfering with viewWillAppear, as it's never called in newsFeedNavigationController). In it, items that when clicked will push a new UIViewController into the stack. </p>

<p>The problem is that whenever views are popped off the stack, viewWillAppear is never called in newsFeedNavigationController, and the items in the list remain highlighted. I've been messing with this for a few hours am at the point where I need some help to find out what I am doing wrong.</p>

<p>In my newsFeedNavigationController, I tried to add an NSLog to see if it is called or I did something, but it is never even called.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    NSLog(@""is viewWillAppear called?"");
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Okay, now here is something weird I noticed:</p>

<p>If I run: </p>

<pre><code>[self presentModalViewController:(any UIview) animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>and then dismiss it, viewWillAppear begins to work properly when popping and pushing views... So now I am stumped. It's not really a solution but maybe an inside of something that is going on.</p>

<p>I couldn't find an easy way to sort files using the shell that works in every case the way I'd expect. An easy solution such as <code>find | rev | sort | rev</code> does the job but the files appear in an odd order, and it doesn't arrange them as nicely for the best compression ratio. Other tools such as <code>ls -X</code> don't work with <code>find</code>, and <code>sort -t. -k 2,2 -k 1,1</code> messes up when files have more than one period in the filename (e.g. version-1.5.tar). Another quick-n-dirty option, using <code>sed</code> replaces the last period with a <code>/</code> (which never occurs in a filename), then sorts, splitting along the <code>/</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sed 's/\(\.[^.]*\)$/\/\1/' | sort -t/ -k 2,2 -k 1,1  |  sed 's/\/\([^/]*\)$/\1/'
</code></pre>

<p>However, once again this doesn't work using the output from <code>find</code> which has <code>/</code>s in the names, and all other characters (other than 0) are allowed in filenames in *nix.</p>

<p>I discovered that using Perl, you can write a custom comparison subroutine using the same output as <code>cmp</code> (similar to <code>strcmp</code> in C), and then run the perl sort function, passing your own custom comparison, which was easy to write with perl regular expressions. This is exactly what I did: I now have a perl script which calls</p>

<pre><code>@lines = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
print sort myComparisonFunction @lines;
</code></pre>

<p>However, perl is not as portable as bash, so I want to be able to do with with a shell script. In addition, <code>find</code> does not put a trailing / on directory names so the script thinks directories are the same as files without an extension. Ideally, I'd like to have <code>tar</code> read all the directories first, then regular files (and sort them), then symbolic links which I can achieve via</p>

<pre><code>cat &lt;(find -type d) &lt;(find -type f | perl exsort.pl) &lt;(find -not -type d -and -not -type f) | tar --no-recursion -T - -cvf myfile.tar
</code></pre>

<p>but I still run into the issue that either I have to type this monstrosity every time, or I have both a shell script for this long line AND a perl script for sorting, and perl isn't available everywhere so stuffing everything into one perl script isn't a great solution either. (I'm mainly focused on older computers, cause nowadays all modern Linux and OSX come with a recent enough version of perl).</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to put everything together into one shell script, but I don't know how to pass a custom function to GNU sort tool. <b>Am I out of luck, and have to use one perl script? Or can I do this with one shell script?</b></p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b> Thanks for the idea of a Schwartizan Transform. I used a slightly different method, using <code>sed</code>. My final sorting routine is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sed 's_^\(\([^/]*/\)*\)\(.*\)\(\.[^\./]*\)$_\4/\3/\1_' | sed 's_^\(\([^/]*/\)*\)\([^\./]\+\)$_/\3/\1_' | sort -t/ -k1,1 -k2,2 -k3,3 | sed 's_^\([^/]*\)/\([^/]*\)/\(.*\)$_\3\2\1_'
</code></pre>

<p>This handles special characters (such as *) in filenames and places files without an extension first because they are often text files. (Makefile, COPYING, README, configure, etc.).</p>

<p>P.S. In case anyone wants my original comparison function or think I could improve on it, here it is:</p>

<pre><code>sub comparison {
    my $first = $a;
    my $second = $b;
    my $fdir = $first =~ s/^(([^\/]*\/)*)([^\/]*)$/$1/r;
    my $sdir = $second =~ s/^(([^\/]*\/)*)([^\/]*)$/$1/r;
    my $fname = $first =~ s/^([^\/]*\/)*([^\/]*)$/$2/r;
    my $sname = $second =~ s/^([^\/]*\/)*([^\/]*)$/$2/r;

<p>is it possible? </p>

<p>My question is: how to edit such lines once plotted?</p>

<p>In example, once one or more line(s) are drawn  I would like to select one of these, and by right mouse click and using a pop-up menu, delete it, modify length, (to make it shorter or longer) or change line slope.</p>

<p>Please note that I need the application to be interactive, the user will never be passing the username and password as command line arguments, so argv is not the correct answer.</p>

<p>For example, when doing this in Ruby, you would enter this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'io/console'
puts ""Enter your password""
@password = STDIN.noecho(&amp;:gets).chomp

<p>No matter how many letters are entered, it only shows that blue box with the dot in it. It doesn't print the password to the screen and it doesn't show ********* for the password either.</p>

<ul>
<li>a very old, big, C# legacy code base with no testcoverage whatsoever</li>
<li>(almost) every class derives from some interface</li>
<li>nothing is sealed</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the practical benefits of using profiler-API-driven solutions like JustMock and TypeMock, compared to using extract&amp;override + e.g. RhinoMocks? Are there cases I'm not aware of, besides circumventing private/protected, where using TypeMock/JustMock etc. is really <em>needed</em>? I'd especially welcome some experience from people having switched to one of the products. </p>

<p>Using extract&amp;override seems to solve all problems when handling old legacy code, the refactoring seems dead simple, and the possibility for introducing bugs seems very minor. Is the benefit writing less test code? More beautifull classes with less virtual protected stuff? Right now, I don't 'get it', although I understand it's very helpfull to first test private methods in isolation, as public methods may be too large under the hood in such old legacy codebases.</p>

<p>I did all the Project Structure settings, and Build Artifacts, but still got that message. Basically, in src/main has an object class, and in scr/test has the test class. I don't know what's wrong. My guess is the Main Class in the Manifest ???</p>

There's many columns in the relevant table, but for now I only care about a 'name' column. (The database is in a server app, the iPhone app is a client, talking over a socket) Naturally to make this usable, I want to support the 'quick access bar', and hence to count the number of rows that start with A, B, C .. Z (and ideally handle the rows that start with an awkward characters such as #, or a digit).</p>

<p>I'm having trouble formulating a SQL query (supported by SQLite) to count the rows starting with a given letter; if necessary I could make 26 separate queries, but I wonder if there's some nested query magic to compute all the values at once. (Obviously 'COUNT WHERE NAME LIKE 'A*' would work, repeated twenty-six times, but it feels very crude, and wouldn't handle digits or symbols)</p>

<p>Relevant facts: modifications to the database are infrequent, and I can easily cache the query, and refresh it when the DB is modified. The DB is much larger than the RAM on the server device, so avoiding paging the whole DB file would be good. There is an index on the relevant 'name' column of the DB already. Performance is more important than brevity, so if separate queries is faster than one complex query, that's fine.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram of underlying data structure:</p>

<pre><code>|------Root
    |------nodeA0
        |------nodeA1
            |------nodeA2



    |------nodeB0
        |------nodeB1
            |------nodeB2_0

            |------nodeB2_1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

<p>I start by querying a top-level <code>QModelIndex</code> from Row 1 and Column 0:</p>

<pre><code>nodeB0_modelIndex=myModel.index(1, 0, QtCore.QModelIndex())
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>1</code> is a Row number, <code>0</code> is a Column number and <code>QtCore.QModelIndex()</code> is an empty QModelIndex (this is how we let the model know that we request a <strong>top-level</strong> <code>QModelIndex</code>).</p>

<p>Next using <code>QModelIndex</code> <code>.internalPointer()</code> method I query a data-variable linked to a received <code>QModelIndex</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nodeB0=nodeB0_modelIndex.internalPointer()
print 'Confirming: top-level node at row 1 column 0: ""%s""'%nodeB0.name
</code></pre>

<p>The confirmation prints I get a ""correct"" variable back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Confirming: top-level node at row 1 column 0: ""nodeB0""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<p>Now having a top-level <code>QModelIndex</code> linked to ""nodeB0"" I can propagate down the data hierarchy to <code>nodeB1</code> and then to <code>nodeB2_0</code> and <code>nodeB2_1</code>. Once again querying <code>QModelIndex</code> I will be using <code>myModel.index()</code> method supplying it with three arguments: Row number, Column number (both numbers are relative to the <code>QModelIndex</code>-parent) and the <code>QModelIndex</code>-parent itself as a third argument:</p>

<pre><code>nodeB1_modelIndex=myModel.index(0, 0, nodeB0_modelIndex)
nodeB1=nodeB1_modelIndex.internalPointer()
print 'Confirming: node B at row 0 column 0: ""%s""'%nodeB1.name

nodeB2_0_modelIndex=myModel.index(0, 0, nodeB1_modelIndex)
nodeB2_0=nodeB2_0_modelIndex.internalPointer()
print 'Confirming: node B at row 0 column 0: ""%s""'%nodeB2_0.name

nodeB2_1_modelIndex=myModel.index(1, 0, nodeB1_modelIndex)
nodeB2_1=nodeB2_1_modelIndex.internalPointer()
print 'Confirming: node B at row 1 column 0: ""%s""'%nodeB2_1.name
</code></pre>

<p>So far I have been working with Row numbers only. For the Column numbers I was using 0.
Looking at my underlying data structure defined in the <code>self._rootNode</code> I can see why:</p>

<p>The model's Row numbers are eventually used to query a Node-instance stored in <code>_children</code> list variable:</p>

<pre><code>def getChildNode(self, row):
    return self._children[row]
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>row</code> argument corresponds to both Model's row and list variable index number - an ordered number of elements stored in a typical list variable.</p>

<p>Question: Looking at my underlying data structure I can't find a way to implement the <strong>Column</strong> numbers. How, where and why I should be using Columns?</p>

<h1>Edited Later:</h1>

<p>I was rereading my own question when I came to an idea... What if the answer to my question is: we use Row numbers when we intend to place the node-items vertically within QTableView with the zero numbered item at the Row # 0 and all others items going down (so there is only single Column # 0 in use). If we decide to position node-items horizontally we use Columns numbers instead. This way the first item is leftmost. And all the following items are placed next to each other on a right side. Then only a single Row # 0 is used. </p>

<p>With QTableView we use either Row or Column numbers. Not the both. So we design the underlying data structure variable and a model handling it accordingly. Am I correct?</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated, and as I stated I'd like to not really on any 3rd party libraries and stay in native C++11.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a page displaying <code>books</code>, and then a feature where <code>users</code> can save any amount of books to their own personal libraries (""liking"" them, essentially).</p>

<p>A book comprises parameters like <strong>author</strong>, <strong>title</strong>, <strong>amount of pages</strong>, <strong>synopsis</strong>, <strong>list of characters</strong>, etc.</p>

<p>In SQL I would need to set up a join table between <code>books</code> and <code>users</code>, but in noSQL (and specifically Firebase because that's what I'm starting with) there's no such thing and that leaves me puzzled. I have been warned to nest data, but here it seems necessary to nest <code>books</code> under <code>users</code> (or vice versa?) and have a lot of duplicated data.</p>

<p>This seems icky to me for several reasons. One is that it would require a lot of extra time to iterate over users, because their entire library would need to be iterated over as well. Second, I would need to duplicate a lot of data, because I want to display the books in their library in full, along with the synopsis and character lists, etc.</p>

<p>Do I actually need to make another segment, called <code>library</code>, where I list <code>users</code> and nest their <code>books</code> under them? Is that a valid approach?</p>

<p>Or have I missed something essential here? Can I actually refer to data as with a foreign key even in noSQL (including Firebase)?</p>

Page Error: TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating     '$(this.get(0).children).deepEach')
</code></pre>

<p>I am getting this error thrown in toolkit.js when the page is loaded. But the same error is not thrown when i get this HTML opened in the browser. Not sure if this is because of behavior in headless browser. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Can I write to declaration like: const int &amp; F?</p>

<p>I am confused about reference and pointer, because they both represent the address of something, but we always write parameter use reference as: const &amp; F, I understand that this is to reduce the copy and does not allow others to change it, but are there any other meanings? and why do we need ""const"" after a function declaration like: int F(int z) const; this const makes the return type const or everything in the function const?</p>

<p>One more example,</p>

<pre><code>void F(int* p)
{
p+=3;
}

int z=8;
F(&amp;z);
std::cout&lt;&lt;z&lt;&lt;std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>What is the output for z since z is a reference, and I pass it as a pointer who points to an integer.Increasing p by 3 just makes the address different and does not change its value?</p>

<p>Let's say I have a Car:</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public Car {
    @Inject private Engine engine;
    @Inject private Chassis chassis;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the Engine comes in 2 variants, @Standard and @Powerful</p>

<p>What I want is to inject a Car, and qualify this injection with @Standard or @Powerful, without actually having to create 2 Car instances myself.</p>

<p>In other words when I write:</p>

<pre><code>@Inject @Powerful Car car;
</code></pre>

<p>I want Spring to create (or use existing) singleton Car with the standard Chassis and the Powerful Engine.</p>

<p>But when I write:</p>

<pre><code>@Inject @Standard Car car;
</code></pre>

<p>I want Spring to create (or use existing) singleton Car with the standard Chassis and the Standard Engine.</p>

<p>So far I can only manage this by giving Car a constructor and doing this myself in a @Configuration class.  This is ok for this example, but tiresome if there's like 10 injections for Car.</p>

<pre><code>@Bean @Powerful
public Car car1() {
    return new Car(new PowerfulEngine(), new Chassis());
}

@Bean @Standard
public Car car1() {
    return new Car(new StandardEngine(), new Chassis());
}

@Bean @Standard @Sedan
public Car car1() {
    return new Car(new StandardEngine(), new SedanChassis());
}

etc...
</code></pre>

<p>There must be an easier way...</p>

<p>Can Spring just create these two beans for me?  What about even more if there's 3 engine types?  Or 3 engine types and 5 chassis types (meaning there can be 15 differently configured Car objects)?</p>

<p>ie:</p>

<pre><code>@Inject @Powerful @Sedan Car car;
</code></pre>

<p>Where @Sedan is a Chassis variant...</p>

<p>I make an AJAX call which generates a list of radio buttons. The number of radio buttons is random, all depends on the number of items in a JSON object.</p>

<p>I am wanting to validate that all of the generated radio buttons have been selected before making the submit button available.</p>

<p>Currently my HTML looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""toDo"" class=""col-sm-6 text-center""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""manualChecks"" class=""panel panel-default""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""panel-heading text-center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Check&lt;/strong&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;button type=""submit"" class=""btn btn-primary""&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My ajax reads a .JSON file and generates a list of checkboxes via the following javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var ul = $('&lt;ul class =""list-group text-left""&gt;');

            $.each(item, function (key, value) {
                var li = $('&lt;li class=""list-group-item""&gt;').append(
                    $('&lt;input type=""radio""&gt;' + value.Description + '&lt;/input&gt;')

                li.appendTo(ul);    
            });

            $('#manualChecks').append(ul);
        }

<p>One solution would be to use relative links, however due to particular reasons, I cannot use relative links, resultantly, I have had to find an alternative...</p>

<p>I have recently learned that you can write a link like so in order use the current protocol:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""//www.example.net/test/""&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Up until now I have been using the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

    // Get the current protocol
    $_PROTOCOL = $_SERVER['HTTPS']=='on' ? 'https://' : 'http://';

?&gt;

&lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo $_PROTOCOL; ?&gt;www.example.net/test/""&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst the first solution works, I have only recently discovered it am not familiar with how it works and whether it is reliable. I am aware that older browsers may not like it, but this does not bother me as it is only very old browsers (apparently).</p>

<p>When I tried to generate a sitemap for one of my websites, the urls were written very oddly like so:</p>

<pre><code>http://beta.example.net///venue/
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of</p>

<pre><code>http://beta.example.net/venue/
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this? Is this because of the links I am using?</p>

<p>Is my original (PHP) solution better, despite the large amount of code to go with it?</p>

Sometimes, without any apparent reason, this application starts consuming 100% of CPU time (50% on a dual-core CPU system). This is what Windows Task Manager and other process monitoring/analysis tools are showing, anyway. Usually, the only way to stop such CPU thrashing is to restart the application.</p>

<p>We still don't know how to trigger this problem at will. But I have a feeling that it usually happens when some of the forms get closed by a user.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Recently we noticed that one of the forms consistently makes CPU usage raise to 100% whenever it gets minimized. Most of the time CPU usage goes back to normal when that form is ""un-minimized"". Perhaps, it's a different problem, but we'd like to uncover this mystery, too. :)</p>

<p>Googling for a solution of this problem didn't yield very good results. The most frequent theory is that MS Access gets into some sort of waiting-for-events loop which is practically harmless, performance-wise, because the thread running that loop has very low priority. This doesn't seem to help us because in our case (a) it certainly does hurt the system's performance and (b) it's still unclear what exactly makes Access to get into such ""bad state"" and how to avoid that.</p>

<p>Table_words - my table for words</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I create a new FTS table i.e. Table_words_fts - does it replace table_words, is it added as just another table? </p></li>
<li><p>If added as another table do I add the data at the same time to the FTS table as I do to the table_words through my code? </p></li>
<li><p>If so can I omit some columns which are not necessary and include others that are not in the table_words table?</p></li>
<li><p>If I am just replacing the table in number 1, then does it affect regular queries?</p></li>
<li><p>If I am not replacing it, but do not need to store data in the new FTS table then is it just added to be able to read the table faster?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My understanding so far is the following, it is a separate table, add I add the data to it throughout my code, and I can omit some columns but not add new ones. Also, the way I would store the data would be the exact same way I add it to the other tables...</p>

<p>Here is my idea of working with it...
Creating the table:</p>

<pre><code>// create FTS tables for quicker matches for search
db.execSQL(""CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE "" + TABLE_WORDS_FTS + "" USING fts3(""
    + KEY_ID + "", "" + KEY_DICTIONARYID + "", "" + KEY_WORD1 + "" , ""
    + KEY_WORD2 + "" , "" + KEY_WORD3 + "", "" + KEY_WORD4 + "" "" + "");"");
</code></pre>

<p>Create Regular Table as well:</p>

<pre><code>// Words table create statement
private static final String CREATE_TABLE_WORDS = ""CREATE TABLE ""
    + TABLE_WORDS + ""("" + KEY_ID + "" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,""
    + KEY_DICTIONARYID + "" INTEGER,"" + KEY_WORD1 + "" TEXT,"" + KEY_WORD2
    + "" TEXT,"" + KEY_WORD3 + "" TEXT,"" + KEY_WORD4 + "" TEXT"" + "")"";
db.execSQL(CREATE_TABLE_WORDS);
</code></pre>

<p>The rest I will be doing the regular way... but to recap: Trying to figure out if the Table is created additionally to the Table? If data is stored regularly in it as well? </p>

<p>I need to highlight the background of a textbox under certain conditions.  I have created a Highlight property and tried using a trigger in a style to set it but it doesn't actually ever highlight the text.</p>

<p>Here is my Style, simplified:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style x:Key=""TextBoxStyle"" BasedOn=""{StaticResource CommonStyles}""&gt;
    &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;
        &lt;Trigger Property=""Elements:DataElement.Highlight"" Value=""True""&gt;
            &lt;Setter Property=""Control.Background""
                    Value=""{DynamicResource EntryBoxHighlightBackground}""/&gt;
        &lt;/Trigger&gt;
    &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Elements is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>xmlns:Elements=""clr-namespace:MDTCommon.Controls.Forms.Elements""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have the section where the style is applied:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Applies above style to all TextBoxes --&gt;
&lt;Style TargetType=""TextBox"" BasedOn=""{StaticResource TextBoxContentHolder}"" &gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""Validation.ErrorTemplate"" Value=""{x:Null}"" /&gt;
    &lt;!-- Overrides the default Error Style --&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the code behind of the DataElement class is the following:</p>

<pre><code>public static readonly DependencyProperty HighlightProperty = 
    DependencyProperty.Register(""Highlight"", typeof(bool), typeof(DataElement));

public bool Highlight
{
    get { return (bool)base.GetValue(HighlightProperty); }
    set { base.SetValue(HighlightProperty, value); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A DataElement ultimately derived from UserControl and it contains a reference to TextBox object as well as othe objects.</p>

<p>In the CustomForm class that houses all of the DataElement objects I have the following to set the color.</p>

<pre><code>Resources[""EntryBoxHighlightBackground""] = Brushes.Yellow;
</code></pre>

<p>So, the first issue is that setting the Highlight property for the DataElement doesn't cause the textbox background to draw in yellow.</p>

<p>The other issue is that I realize that I am applying this style to all textboxes and I could have textboxes in other areas that are not actually contained within a DataElement, which may cause a binding issue.</p>

<p>I faced a lot of error shown. Even I tried to fix these errors but some of them I could not understand. I just wonder it is the errors made by Apple developers or the errors for my Xcode 6 beta 4.</p>

<p>and use eq(), like here:</p>

<p>I get 'something here', but 'third paragraph' is what I need, because 'something here' is the second generation child of myDiv and should not be taken into account.

<p>You are right - there is nothing wrong with my js code. But, as you suggested, I have looked into my html, and saw something strange happening there. I have:</p>

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and what I see in elements field in browser:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Option1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Option2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Option3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Option4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Following problem: I am using those 2 methods to populate a JTable with a DefaultTableModel, the ResultSet shows the right amount of data entries (i already searched it with System.out.println) but the JTable always misses the first row </p>

<p>I am using a method to get a ResultSet like this: </p>

<pre><code>    public static JTable DBCFillBTableAuftraege() {

        rs = stmt.executeQuery(""SELECT a.auftrags_nr, k.firma, a.auftragsdatum, a.lieferdatum, a.rechnungsbetrag, k.name, k.strasse, k.plz, k.ort from auftrag a join kunde k on k.kunden_nr = a.kunden_nr "");
        while (rs.next()) {

<p>Which then calls this method:</p>

<pre><code>public static DefaultTableModel TableModel(ResultSet rs)

        columnNames.add(metaData.getColumnName(column));
    }

    // data of the table
    Vector&lt;Vector&lt;Object&gt;&gt; data = new Vector&lt;Vector&lt;Object&gt;&gt;();
    while (rs.next()) {
        Vector&lt;Object&gt; vector = new Vector&lt;Object&gt;();

I have did lot of R&amp;D on this and have gone through the questions posted in stackoverflow.So please it is not necessary to say that it is a duplicate.</p>

<p>I tried putting these options<br>
  <code>objIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP|Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP);</code><br>
 while starting the activity. Also I have tried this,     </p>

<pre><code>    objIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_MAIN);
    objIntent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER); 
</code></pre>

<p>But none of these seem to be working for me. </p>

<p>The scenario goes like this, where this fails. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I run my application, go to some activity from the initial activity say from A to B</p></li>
<li><p>Now I will press my phone home button and do some actions like clicking photo and etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Again I try to launch the app from home screen. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Oops!! Now my app has not retained its state, it is launching from the initial state.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>However this is not true in all the cases. some times say around 1 or 2 times out of 10 or 15 times, it launches from the same state where it was left before. </p></li>
<li><p>One more doubt i have is do I need to set this for all the intents? Say i have some 10+ positions of Intent i.e., starting the activity. Do I need to add this piece of code in all those places? I included this for 2 or 3 cases</p></li>

<p><strong>This works in the debug mode, but when it comes to the point of an apk create, it is getting failed. However, if I try number of times it gives me the required result and there after behaves in the way as expected. Breaking my head to understand why it happening like this.</strong></p>

<p>If I understand correctly, what should happen is that each result should now have a field called ""countrycode"" with the value of ""country"" in it.</p>

<p>The results of _mapping look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{""postcode"":
    {""postcode"":
        {""properties"":

                   ""properties"":{}

           }
</code></pre>

<p>Once all the data is in the index if I run this command:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:9200/postcode/_search?pretty=true&amp;q=country:au
</code></pre>

<p>it responds with 15740 total items</p>

<p>what I was expecting is that if I run the query like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:9200/postcode/_search?routing=au&amp;pretty=true
</code></pre>

<p>Then I was expecting it to respond with 15740 results</p>

<p>instead it returns 120617 results, which includes results where country is != au</p>

<p>I did note that the number of shards in the results went from 4 to 1, so something is working.</p>

<p>I was expecting that in the result set there would be an item called ""countrycode"" (from the rounting mapping) which there isn't</p>

<p>So I thought at this point that my understand of routing was wrong. Perhaps all the routing does is tell it which shard to look in but not what to look for? in other words if other country codes happen to also land in that particular shard, the way those queries are written will just bring back all records in that shard?</p>

<p>So I tried the query again, this time adding some info to it.</p>

<pre><code> http://localhost:9200/postcode/_search?routing=AU&amp;pretty=true&amp;q=country:AU 
</code></pre>

<p>I thought by doing this it would force the query into giving me just the AU place names, but this time it gave me only 3936 results</p>

<p>So I Am not quite sure what I have done wrong, the examples I have read show the queries changing from needing a filter, to just using match_all{} which I would have thought would only being back ones matching the au country code.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help in getting this to work correctly.</p>

<p>Almost have this working, it now gives me the correct number of results in a single shard, however the create index is not working quite right, it ignores my number_of_shards setting, and possibly other ones too</p>

<p>Is it possible simply with XSL and maybe some javascript or pure CSS?</p>

<p>I have a general form of this problem, though I did pinch the sample XML shown above <a href=""http://www.experts-exchange.com/Web_Development/Web_Languages-Standards/XML/Q_21040020.html"" rel=""nofollow"">from</a></p>

<p>Essentially I would very much like to end up with something as cool as <a href=""http://jasalguero.com/demos/expandableList/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, but just using XSL (and a little javascript if necessary) to transform my XML document. Any ideas?</p>

<p><em>Note:I have precious little experience with XSL or javascript, I do use python a bit so if there's a python library or solution please let me know</em></p>

</code></pre>

<p>It takes input such as ""World"" and ""World+News"" through a url such as website.com/articles/World+News and passes whatever is after articles/ to the search function in the Articles controller. This was working fine up until the update. Now it will pass up the route and go to my ""cannot find route"" route if there is anything other than alphanumeric characters. It's like the regex isn't matching properly. e.g. ""World"" and ""World123"" will work but ""World+News"" will not.</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>Changing the regex to .* just to see if it works. It does.</li>
<li>Changing the route from :keywords to * just to see if it works. It does.</li>
<li>Trying something I know will fail such as excluding anything with letters in the match. It fails to use this route as expected.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've been scouring everywhere, trying all sorts of regex combinations (the ones I have match successfully in the tester), and just generally trying to find out why this route will match but I cannot. This was working fine before the update and I can't find anything in the CakePHP documentation that would suggest why this isn't working. As far as I know the expressions have been right and I have confirmed that they fully match using a regex tester. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>

Specifically, if $document_root/maintenance.html existed and $remote_addr =! 1.2.3.4 (where 1.2.3.4 is my home IP), the site was effectively in maintenance mode. However, it turned out that index.php wasn't being rewritten for any request coming from an IP that isn't 1.2.3.4. By modifying the if statement to how it is written above, index.php is properly rewritten for any request coming from any IP that <em>isn't</em> 1.2.3.4.</p>

<p>Since none of this has anything to do with PHP rewriting, I have no idea why this is happening and I'm hoping someone else might know why.</p>
