<ol>
<li>Set the base to the user DN.</li>
<li>Set the scope to base.</li>
<li>Use a search filter of (memberof:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=[GROUP DN HERE])</li>
</ol>

<p>This lead to the following function which works fine for all tested groups <em>except</em> the Domain Users group which is quite large (5k+ members). Total membership for my other test groups didn't exceed 100 however there were many layers of nesting.</p>

<pre><code>private static bool IsGroupMember1(string distinguishedName)
{
    //Setting base to user DN
    using (DirectoryEntry d = new DirectoryEntry(""LDAP://my.domain.com/"" + distinguishedName))
    using (DirectorySearcher s = new DirectorySearcher(d))
    {
        //Setting scope to base
        s.SearchScope = System.DirectoryServices.SearchScope.Base;
        //Setting search filter as specified
        s.Filter = ""(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=CN=Domain Users,OU=SomeOU,DC=my,DC=domain,DC=com)"";
        SearchResult r = s.FindOne();

        if (r != null)
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For testing and comparison, this second function correctly returns membership but is too slow for large groups because of the List to Hashset conversions.</p>

<pre><code>public static bool IsGroupMember2(string distinguishedName)
{
    using(PrincipalContext ctx = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, ""my.domain.com""))
    using(GroupPrincipal group = GroupPrincipal.FindByIdentity(ctx, IdentityType.DistinguishedName, ""CN=Domain Users,OU=SomeOU,DC=my,DC=domain,DC=com""))
    {
        if(group != null)
        {
            var list = group.GetMembers(true).Select(l =&gt; l.DistinguishedName).ToList();

            HashSet&lt;string&gt; hash = new HashSet&lt;string&gt;(list, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

            if (hash.Contains(distinguishedName, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase) == true)
                return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any pointers as to why the first function would fail for just the Domain Users group and not others?  I also tried changing the scope to SubTree which didn't work. No exceptions are being raised and permission aren't an issue.</p>

I've written the boost.python wrappers successfully. I also have access to my C++ objects from Python without any error, in addition called a Python file (module) method from C++ using boost attr("""")() function without any problem. </p>

<p>My problem is the execution time of the Python method. Referencing to the wrapped objects are about microseconds in Python code as I've printed. Although the time calling the Python method takes is about milliseconds and it increases with respect to the number of references I've made in the Python to my wrapped C++ objects (and only referencing/assigning not any further use). Thus I've made some search and my assumptions about this increasing time is:</p>

<ol>
<li>some reference policies (default policies) causes this problem by doing some unnecessary operation(s) when returning from the Python code. So probably I'm doing something wrong in the wrappers.</li>
<li>Boost.Python call method has some overhead, which there might be some options I'm not aware of.</li>
</ol>

<p>It worth mentioning that the Python method called in each execution cycle of my program and each time I get a very same (not exact) time.</p>

<p>I hope my description were enough. Below is also a part of my sample code:</p>

<p>One of my Wrappers:</p>

<pre><code>class_&lt;Vertex&lt;&gt; &gt;(""Vertex"")
  .def(init&lt;float, float&gt;())

Currently I'm studying some P2P DHT models (Chord, Kademlia, Pastry, etc) for a simple distributed service of resource monitoring (cpu, disk, ram, others) of individual hosts over ethernet. The DHT protocol used will be based on Kademlia.</p>

<p><strong>SCENARIO</strong>: all peers can broadcast randomly their local resource comsuption at any given time and also they can connect directly with each other via UDP using a gossip based protocol to inform they resurce comsuption, also randomly times.</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong>: most P2P DHT models keeps log(N) contacts for peers, with N being the number of peers in the network. Every peer needs to know in (soft?) real time the resource usage of any other peer, so i'm planning to maintain a separate table of N contacts in each peer so they can store the snapshots of the other peers.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: is this approach of descentralized global state feasible? or I must take a centralized tracker/index approach? I don't want the network performance to degrade given the (possible) high exchange of udp packet between peers if the pure p2p approaach is used, or given the single point of failure that a centralized option gives.</p>

<p>Ie, one form, several submit buttons. The form will submit and all being well the user will be able to go on and hit another submit button, sending their data through to another instructor. To achieve this I want to use javascript to alter the value of my hidden field on click. </p>

<pre><code>    &lt;%form_for :call_back_request, :remote =&gt; true, :url =&gt; {:action =&gt; ""call_back_request""} do |c| %&gt;
    &lt;%= hidden_field_tag(:instructor_id, @instructor.id) %&gt;
    &lt;%= hidden_field_tag(:pr_ok, true) %&gt;
    &lt;%= c.text_field :first_name, :class =&gt; ""profilesmstext"" %&gt;
    &lt;%= c.text_field :last_name, :class =&gt; ""profilesmstext""%&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;%= c.text_field :postcode, :class =&gt; ""profilesmstexta""%&gt;
    &lt;%= c.text_field :telephone_number, :class =&gt; ""profilesmstext"" %&gt;
    &lt;%= c.submit, :value=""Go!"" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's the simple one instructor version of the form, essentially what I'm talking about doing is putting a loop of submit buttons and instructor ids in there.</p>

<p>So I'll have a loop (pseudo code..)</p>

<pre><code>    @instructors each do |i|
      &lt;%=c.submit, :value =&gt; ""go!"", :onclick =&gt; ""javascript to change hidden field value""%&gt;
     &lt;script / js&gt;
     &lt;function doChicagoShuffleOnId etc &gt;
     &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;%end%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So My question is - what is the js to change that hidden field tag?
Additional question - This makes perfect sense to me, may be rubbish, if there is a more sensible solution please let me know!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>And I don't know why, but it seems that, there is a conflict between thoses controllers' routes.</p>

<p>If for instance I comment <code>HomesController</code> and <code>SearchesController</code>, then <code>WelcomesController</code>'s routes are availables (200). But the routes of the two other controllers are inaccessible (404).</p>

<p>If I uncomment the 3 lines of the <code>config.ru</code>, only the routes of one of thoses 3 controllers are going to be availables.</p>

<p>Is there a tip to fix this trouble?  Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>But the below given code does not work.</p>

<p>From the rules of foreign keys in the manual of SQLite:</p>

<pre><code>- The parent table does not exist, or
- The parent key columns named in the foreign key constraint do not exist, or
- The parent key columns named in the foreign key constraint are not the primary key of the parent table and are not subject to a unique constraint using collating sequence specified in the CREATE TABLE, or
- The child table references the primary key of the parent without specifying the primary key columns and the number of primary key columns in the parent do not match the number of child key columns.

<p>I can see nothing that I'm violating. My create tables look like this:</p>

<pre><code>DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `msrun`;
-- -----------------------------------------------------

<p>Initializing a Java Project from an Existing Ant Buildfile, and using the build.xml file, I get TONS of com.alvazan.orm.api packages, each containing various .java files/test cases and and equal number of .Jar files containing even more packages, etc.</p>

<ol>
<li>Classpath variable 'JRE_LIB' in project 'std_buildfile' is deprecated: Use the JRE System Library instead</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this something that will effect the running and debugging of test cases?</p>

<p>Additionally, I have run into <b>Java Problems</b>, upon initial build:</p>

<ol>
<li>The method translateToColumnImpl(Collection, RowToPersist, Collection) from the type DboColumnToManyMeta is never used locally</li>
<li>The value of the local variable existing is not used</li>
<li>The value of the local variable toBeAdded is not used</li>
<li>The value of the local variable toBeRemoved is not used</li>

<p>While these are currently only errors, since attempting to run various test cases and coming up with even more warnings and errors, I am concerned the looming warnings maybe affecting the outcome.</p>

<p>Please advise if this something which needs addressing or if is generally a common occurrence.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>There are lots of <code>&lt;span class=""sentence""&gt;</code> in my webpage. I'd like to add a tooltip <strong>at the beginning of <code>.sentence</code></strong> when user clicks on a <code>.sentence</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var $tooltip = $('&lt;span id=""tooltip-anchor""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;').html(
                 $('&lt;input type=""button"" class=""tooltip"" id=""sentence-tooltip""&gt;'));
$('.sentence.select').prepend($tooltip);
$tooltip.hide().fadeIn(200);
</code></pre>

<p>The structure will become:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""sentence""&gt;
  &lt;span id=""tooltip-anchor""&gt; &lt;!-- Anchors at the beginning of sentence.--&gt;
    &lt;input type=""button"" class=""tooltip"" id=""sentence-tooltip""&gt; &lt;!-- The tooltip --&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  text text
&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this method has a problem: when the <code>.sentence</code> starts at the left border of browser, the <code>span#tooltip-anchor</code> appears at the right border of browser, because the browser breaks the line between <code>#tooltip-anchor</code> and the <code>.sentence.select</code>. How can I fix this problem?</p>

<p><code>#tooltip-anchor</code> is just an idea I thought to anchor the beginning of the <code>.sentence</code>. Can you help come up with another solution?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Expect:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The tooltip is floating on the top of the beginning of the sentence.</li>
<li><p>The tooltip feature should not change the layout of sentences.</p>

<pre><code>                    [tooltip]
This is a sentence. This is
another sentence.
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally i can be able to solve the problem using the suggestion in the answer of Christop and modify it just a bit.</p>

<p>I found the approximate slop of the function (something near to -4) then taking this parameter fix i just fit the curve with only a, found it i fix it and modify only b. After that using the output as starting solution for the fit i found the best fit.

It is an array of a datacontract from a REST service, <code>ContactContract[]</code>. When this array is empty everything is great and the workflow continues on correctly. However, if there are any items in the array a stack overflow occurs outside of my activities, I can't pinpoint the specific spot unfortunately.</p>

<p>So, having seen something like this before with the <code>DataContractSerializer</code> when cycles exist in the object graph I wrote a unit test to try it out. The test fails with the following exception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.Xaml.XamlObjectReaderException: Unable to serialize type
  'System.Runtime.Serialization.ExtensionDataObject'.  Verify that the
  type is public and either has a default constructor or an instance
  descriptor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the test:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void ContactArraySerialize()
{
    var ser = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(ContactContract[]));
    var reader = new StringReader(Strings.SERIALIZED_CONTACT_LIST);
    var xmlReader = XmlReader.Create(reader);
    var list = ser.ReadObject(xmlReader) as ContactContract[];

    var str = XamlServices.Save(list);
}
</code></pre>

<p>(I would add the xml for the contact list but it's huge)</p>

<p>I gather this is because the contract implements <code>IExtensibleDataObject</code> to support versioning a bit better.</p>

<p>This is not the stack overflow I had anticipated, but I bet it is related.</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered either of these issues or have any advice?</p>

<p>I have the following issue:</p>

<p>For some strange reason the regular expression is working on regexr - link above - but is failing miserably with no apparent reason when used with <code>g_regex</code>. Specifically, in <code>g_regex</code> the subexpression </p>

<pre><code>((\r\n){2}((([--]{2,}[=][a-zA-Z0-9._]+)(\r\n)) ((((Content([\x2D][a-zA-Z]+)+)[:]([\x09\x0C\x20]*([a-zA-Z0-9\x2D]+([\x2F][a-zA-Z\x2D]+)?)[;]?)(\r\n))([\x09\x0C\x20]*[a-zA-Z]+[\x09\x0C\x20]*[=])))))
</code></pre>

<p>is working fine, but</p>

<pre><code>((\r\n){2}((([--]{2,}[=][a-zA-Z0-9._]+)(\r\n)) ((((Content([\x2D][a-zA-Z]+)+)[:]([\x09\x0C\x20]*([a-zA-Z0-9\x2D]+([\x2F][a-zA-Z\x2D]+)?)[;]?)(\r\n))([\x09\x0C\x20]*[a-zA-Z]+[\x09\x0C\x20]*[=][\x22]?)))))
</code></pre>

<p>is not, which means the problem is in the <code>[\x22]</code> - the <code>""</code> character. I am unable to understand what is wrong. I have checked with a Hex veiwer, and the hex code is indeed <code>22</code>.</p>

<p>Where is the problem? Might it be a glib bug or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Basically I need a stat tracking system which allows me to track a variety of different types of events, each of them connected to a user that has custom properties (id, country, etc). Think Google Analytics with custom events and custom variables, but without the limit of 5 custom variables and more flexibility with events.</p>

<p>The events are anything from impressions to bank statuses and item ownerships. Basically our database in a statistical format.</p>

<p>At the moment we simply use our MySQL database to gather the info we need, but as we are rapidly growing we cannot keep doing this, also we really need a system that can automate the creation of statistical reports.</p>

<p>So my question really comes down to this, are there any such services (preferrably open source) out there, or possibly frameworks or databases created especially for this type of processing that we can easily create our own stat tracking software from?</p>

<p>Long story short, I need a service, framework or database that eases the creation of custom statistics reports.</p>

I think I have it nearly working, but I cannot seem to make a piece of the code work right.  The code needs to check to see if a node on the graph is already in the set it's trying to be added to; otherwise, you don't want to add it.  Here is the code I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>public static boolean difSets(int index1, int index2, ArrayList&lt;Node&gt; sets[], Node nodes[])
{
    int setnum1 = 0;
    int setnum2 = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; nodes.length; i++)
    {
        for(int j = 0; j &lt; sets[i].size(); j++)
        {
            if(nodes[index1].getX() == sets[i].get(j).getX() &amp;&amp; nodes[index1].getY() == sets[i].get(j).getY());
                setnum1 = i;
            if(nodes[index2].getX() == sets[i].get(j).getX() &amp;&amp; nodes[index2].getY() == sets[i].get(j).getY());
                setnum2 = i;
        }
    }
    if(setnum1 == setnum2)
        return false;
    else
        return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A little info: this method is determining whether or not the two nodes are already in the same set.  The nodes array contains all of the points on the graph (Node is a class that just stores the x and y values and can retrieve them.  Sets is an array of ArrayLists of nodes.  At the start of the problem, every node will be in an ArrayList by itself; by the end, they should all be in the same ArrayList.  Indexes 1 and 2 correspond to the node in the Nodes array.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this code does not seem to be giving me the right output; I've been staring at it for over an hour and I can't figure out what the problem is, so I was hoping someone here could help me out.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Thanks for all the responses.  The table Structure (minimally) is as such:</p>

<p>seotc:
|  Id  |  Clock  |  CampusID  |  Term  |</p>

<p>seotcresults_v2:
|  Id  |  Clock  |  CampusID  |  Term  |  Q1  |  Q2  |  ...etc</p>

<p><code>Id</code> is the auto-incremented index in each table for the surveys and survey results</p>

<p>Where '<code>Clock</code>' is an Id for an instructor and can be found multiple times in the <code>seotc</code> and <code>seotcresults_v2</code> table because they have multiple classes and multiple surveys completed for each class for multiple terms.  I'm essentially trying to determine the response rate based on the number of surveys for an instructor at a given campus in a given term versus the number of results posted given those same parameters.  Does that help?</p>

<p>The problem is that I don't know how to effectively test this. My first instinct was to just add www.aaa.com to my host file and have it resolve as 127.0.0.1:64099 (for instance), but you can't specify ports. How else can I go about this without actually having to publish to IIS or a site running on port 80?</p>

<p>What I really see as my options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add an ObservableCollection to use as the Source of the CollectionViewSource property in my ViewModel - this way I can add to both the DomainContext and the ObservableCollection at the same time to keep the collections in sync.</li>
<li>Change the Binding to the EntitySet directly, and add a filtering event handler to provide the filtering on the CollectionViewSource.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm building a jQuery based app on ASP.NET Razor. I am using jQuery.ui sortable to enable sorting of things. </p>

<p>It was non-obvious to me how to pass the results of a sortable event to my Razor page. There are lots of examples for PHP, but I couldn't find anything for Razor.</p>

<p>Here's an example jQuery.ui for sortable:</p>

<pre><code>    $('#Categories').sortable({
        update: function () {
            var catOrder = $(this).sortable(""serialize"").toString();
            $.ajax({
                type: ""POST"",
                url: ""OrderCategories"",
                data: catOrder,
            }).done(function (msg) {
                alert('done: ' + msg);
            });
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>This passes a string that looks like this to the <code>OrderCategories</code> page:</p>

<pre><code>{id[]=2&amp;id[]=3&amp;id[]=1&amp;id[]=4&amp;id[]=5}
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently ASP.NET is smart enough to figure out a query string like this is an array.  All you have to do to get this array is</p>

<pre><code>var order = Request.Params[""id[]""];
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>order</code> is an array of integers representing the order of the list. Took me way too long to figure this out. Hope this helps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.out.println(""1""+2+3);//Should be 15 right? NO. It is 123.</p>

<p>I tried few other such statements which were along the same lines. I was able to see one two clear behaviors.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If integers are at the front, without the quotes, they are added and subsequent integers are just appended as suffix to the added values from the front.</p></li>
<li><p>if the statement starts with string, under quotes, then all other subsequent elements get appended as suffix.</p></li>

<p>I have no idea what could cause it. <strong>It's caused only</strong> when I click on an input box or submit button and it makes the browser's tab crash. I can't show you the code because it's too complicated. I only need the clue of what I should do first.</p>

<p>Your ideas?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: It's caused only for <code>input text</code> on onblur(?) event: when I go to another tab and press alt+tab or when I click on this <code>input text</code>. There are no custom event handlers though.</p>

<p>What is the probable cause? How do I fix this?</p>

<p>Currently, I don't have any devices hooked up. Could this cause the segfault? I would have expected to get either a zero or some random byte, but not a segfault.</p>

1) Declared the input variable as int instead of char.

<p>Edit: /proc/ioports did not list anything at address 0x100, so I tried several other port addresses that were listed, with the same result. Then I decided to try an <em>output</em> to a known parallel port location (0x0378), and outb did not cause a segfault. However, trying to read either 0x378 or 0x379 <em>did</em> cause a segfault. I am beginning to suspect that the problem is hardware related.</p>

I have written this code to draw a little ship, on the iPad's screen using the projection matrix that I defined previously. It will move the ship around the iPad's screen by dragging.</p>

<pre><code>//draw the ship

    0+ship.x_position,1.0+ship.y_position

};    

GLKBaseEffect *shipEffect = [[GLKBaseEffect alloc] init];
shipEffect.transform.projectionMatrix = GLKMatrix4MakeOrtho(asteroidsViewController.projectionLeft, asteroidsViewController.projectionRight, asteroidsViewController.projectionBottom, asteroidsViewController.projectionTop, 1, -1);

<p>The problem that I am having is twofold. First is that now want to be able to rotate the ship so it points at a spot that the user taps on the screen. When I tried different ways to rotate, I then run into the problem that the ship will rotate in relativity to itself rather than the plane of the iPad. I.e. When the ship is rotated on it's left side, dragging left on the screen will move the ship down not to the left. I also would like to know if the code I have written here is congenitally correct for drawing a 2D object. I've done some research on model view matrices and experimented a with those to try and get the rotating and translating done but I was not very successful. </p>

<ol>
<li>Check if a path exist, so if i want upload test.txt under root/folder1/folder2 I want to check if the file already exist and in the case update it</li>
<li>Build a visual file explorer, now I know that google provides his own (I can't remember the name now, but I know that exist) but I want to restrict the file explorer to specific folders.</li>
</ol>

<p>For now I have a function that fetch the root of Gdrive and I can build the three by recursive calling a function that list me the content of a single folder, but it is extremely slow and can potentially make thousand of request to google and this is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Here the function to get the root:</p>

<pre><code>def drive_get_root():
""""""Retrieve a root list of File resources.
Returns:

#build the service, the driveHelper module will take care of authentication and credential storage
drive_service = build('drive', 'v2', driveHelper.buildHttp())
# the result will be a list
result = []
page_token = None
while True:
    try:
        param = {}
        if page_token:
            param['pageToken'] = page_token
        files = drive_service.files().list(**param).execute()
        #add the files in the list
        result.extend(files['items'])
        page_token = files.get('nextPageToken')

            break
    except errors.HttpError, _error:
        print 'An error occurred: %s' % _error

#so if is in this folder we can return it
if len(file_path) == 1:
    exist = False
    for elem in list:
        if elem[""title""] == file_path[0]:
            #set exist = to the elem because the elem is a dictionary with all the file info

            file_path.pop(0)

    if exist:

<p>I would like the current admin user to have ""Company goggles"" on, i.e. a select list, on the admin index page or maybe the base header, where they can switch their ""current"" Company. Doing that should automatically apply a ""company equals"" filter - for models that have a foreign key to Company - in addition to any other filters.</p>

<p>What's the best way to achieve this?</p>

<p>NB: This is meant as a comfort function for the admin interface, actual protection of models is not necessary at this stage (client views do need that but I can just use a custom Manager and lookup via request.user there).</p>

<p>My current idea is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Store current company in session.</p></li>
<li><p>Use middleware to look up current company from session, and append the company to all relevant links:</p>

<p>a) change_list: (?/&amp;)""company__eq=42""</p>

<p>b) change_view ""add?company=42"" for models that have a foreign key to Company.</p>

<p>This may require to reverse or pattern match the URLs to find out their model and check it for presence of the foreign key (or I might prepare that list beforehand to improve performance).</p></li>
<li><p>Include in each ModelAdmin form the foreign key field, but hide it via CSS, so that change_view add (""new"") includes the preset foreign key value from the link without mentioning it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Do you find this a viable approach?</p>

<p>If <a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10761"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10761</a> was implemented I guess I could just specify a custom queryset which reads the current company from request.session and be done with it. Maybe better to fast-track (=make and submit patch) that ticket instead?</p>

<p>EDIT: or maybe just redefine the queryset() method on every ModelAdmin that needs it / has the foreign key?</p>

<p>We have a web app that opens a new browser page when a certain values are selected from a dropdown.  This worked fine in all previously tested browsers including Safari on ios 5.  After the dropdown value is selected in ios 6, we get the Allow/Deny popup which is expected. But then after making a selection on the popup Safari totally freezes.  The strange thing is that this freezing does not happen every time. Only occasionally.  Is it possible this is a ios 6 bug?  I've tried <code>onblur()</code> like other questions have suggested but I still get ocassional freezing.  I am able to see the problem using the code above.  </p>

<p>Thanks for any help! </p>

<p>However, the plugin used an method as taught by Buddpress in group-extension-api> link.</p>

<p>The group steps are registered using the function bp_register_group_extension and add_action are called. I tried to remove the action by with no success. Because I not really understand how the array works i.e. array( &amp;$extension, \'_register\' ), so I go search out and found this <a href=""http://funcdoc.wordpress.com/2008/01/13/writing-plugins-what-is-the-class-callback-format/"" rel=""nofollow"">post</a>. </p>

<p>There's a line stating that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new format for the above object referenced method callbacks are always: class name, followed immediately by the method name, followed by the amount of previously added (classname+methodname). For classes, this allows you to add as many object referenced classes and add methods which don’t override each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However I can't seems to be able to remove the action.</p>

<p>I tried to remove the action by putting following lines of code in function.php</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>function remove_bp_hierarchy(){</p>
  
  <blockquote>

<p>Is it something wrong with my remove_action or I use wrong method? Thanks and regards.</p>

<p>## Update</p>

<p>Found a <a href=""http://www.wprecipes.com/list-all-hooked-wordpress-functions"" rel=""nofollow"">page</a> in which let we see a list of hooks and also hooked function in the page. I see that there's a function with the name _register which is the function I'm looking for. However, class address always change. I was thinking using the function found to do a preg_match on it and remove it when it found. this is super heavy. So is there other way of removing it? Thanks and Regards.</p>

In short, I have an <code>AJAX</code>call that returns a bunch of <code>HTML</code> ie a table of order items. The returned data is rows of the order items and each of these row also has <code>AJAX</code>functions. For example, you add an order item which returns the necessary <code>HTML</code> and appends the order item to the existing items. The returned row for the new item has say a discount field which also works using <code>AJAX</code>. If I add an item and then try to type into the discount field the discount <code>AJAX</code> function will not be called on the added row, but will work for existing rows. If I refresh the page and the item is of course present, the discount field works fine. It appears that all the necessary <code>HTML</code> is passed but not the <code>JQUERY</code> for the <code>AJAX</code> call.</p>

<p>Here is some code specifically related to this issue, again this is dealing with order items, but the code specifically allows creation of a row and creates an <code>AJAX</code> delete button at the end of the row. This button does not work until the page has refreshed.</p>

<p>The view has the following:</p>

<pre><code>  /*
  ** This is used to pull in the items.
  */
  echo '&lt;div id=""order_items""&gt;';

   echo OrderItems::model()-&gt;createEngineerOrderForm($model-&gt;order_id);

<p>Hopefully this makes sense, but any questions let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Here is a small example you can test to see the issue I am referring to. Effectively here you should have a button, Button A, you press Button A and another button, button B appears. You then press Button B and it should <code>alert</code> ""Successful"". The first ajax call from Button A works, but the second ajax call from Button B does not. </p>

<p>Here is the <strong>view</strong> code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

echo CHtml::ajaxSubmitButton('Button-A',
CHtml::normalizeUrl(array('/Accounts/testAjax')),
array('success'=&gt;'function(data)
                               {
                                   $(""#button-test"").html(data);
                                }',
 'type'=&gt;'POST'),array('id'=&gt;'button-a'));



?&gt;
&lt;div id=""button-test""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the <strong>Controller</strong> code:</p>

<pre><code>public function actiontestAjax()
{
    echo CHtml::ajaxSubmitButton('Button-B',
CHtml::normalizeUrl(array('/Accounts/testAjax2')),
array('success'=&gt;'function(data)
                     {
                         alert(data);
                     }','type'=&gt;'POST'),array('id'=&gt;'button-b'));

}

public function actiontestAjax2()
{
    echo successful;

secondaryform.label1.Text = ""I was created in AddUserForm and will change my text here in Form1!"";

primaryform.label1.Text = ""I was created in Form1 and will change my text here in AddUserForm!"";

I am puzzled because I had thought that JTA/JPA treated these transactions independently so that rollback on one did not affect the other.  I'm using Java 1.6.0_24, EJB 3.1, GlassFish 3.0.1, JPA 2, MS SQL Server (non-XA) 2008, CMT.  </p>

<p>The example below shows the essence: A Process EJB in its own TN invokes the auditor at its start, performs DB actions but determines failure, sets rollback, and then invokes auditor upon completion. An Auditor EJB invokes JPA to create an audit record in a separate transaction (REQUIRES_NEW) and this works fine when the transaction is successful.  The code shows a generic auditing structure with all unnecessary code omitted--the generics appear to be part of the problem.</p>

<pre><code>public interface ErrorDescriptor {  
    public String getName ();  
}  

public interface GenericAuditor&lt;T extends ErrorDescriptor&gt; {
    public void log(T errorType);
}

public abstract class AbstractGenericAuditorImpl&lt;T extends ErrorDescriptor&gt;
    implements GenericAuditor&lt;T&gt; {
}

public enum AuditType implements ErrorDescriptor {
   BEGIN, FAILED;
    public String getName() { return name(); }
}

public interface Auditor extends GenericAuditor&lt;AuditType&gt; {
    // The absence of the following 2 lines causes the problem
    @Override
    public void log(AuditType errorType);
}

@Stateless
public class AuditorImpl
    extends AbstractGenericAuditorImpl&lt;AuditType&gt;
    implements Auditor {
    @PersistenceContext (""EntityPersistenceManagement"")
    protected EntityManager entityManager;

    @Override
    @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void log (AuditType e) {
        ErrorEvent errorEvent = new ErrorEvent (); // entity
        errorEvent.setName (e.getName());
        entityManager.persist (errorEvent);
   }
}

@Stateless
public class ProcessImpl implements Process {
    @Resource private EJBContext ejbContext;
    @EJB private Auditor auditor;

@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void method1() {
    auditor.log(AuditType.BEGIN);

    // Perform series of actions including database ops
    // Takes up to 1 minute
    // Somethings happen that detects failure
    ejbContext.setRollbackOnly ();

    auditor.log(AuditType.FAILED);
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that when parent.method1() is invoked it proceeds quietly until it determines failure and sets rollback.  At that point the 2nd audit call throws Client's Transaction Aborted as if it were part of the current transaction rather than in a separate transaction. Moreover, the first audit call puts no data in the database--even when successful it does not commit until the parent commits (is that normal?) This should be non-XA in separate transactions.</p>

<p>I've read many articles that claim the transactions are independent, but  <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Transactions"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> suggests that nested transactions do not commit until the parent commits and that if the parent rollsback, the children rollback also.  I don't see how I could commit partial or status work if that were true because nothing would commit until the top most transaction committed.</p>

It then returns TRUE is the sub-string is found in the cell, and FALSE if it is not found.</p>

<p>Here is the code for the UDF (named the <code>contains</code> function)</p>

<pre><code>Function contains(substring As String, testString As String) As String
'testString = cell to be tested for substring
Dim result As Boolean
result = False
testString = UCase(testString)
substring = UCase(substring)

For i = 1 To Len(testString)
If Mid(testString, i, Len(substring)) = substring Then result = True
Next

contains = result

End Function
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I created this function is so that I can nest it within stock Excel functions, mainly <code>IF</code> functions, <code>AND</code> functionS, and <code>OR</code> functions.</p>

<p>However, when I use it with an OR function, the OR function does not seem to ""recognize"" the result of the =contains function. </p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the issue within Excel:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3wDdp.png"" alt=""containsprobelem""></p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> Here is what the =contains function is doing in the above pic <code>=contains(""Hello"",A2)</code></p>

<p>Obviously, since the =Contains function in column C is returning <code>True</code>, then the <code>OR</code> function in column D should be returning <code>True</code> as well. But for some reason it is as if the stock Excel <code>OR</code> function doesn't recognize the result of my <code>contains</code> function. </p>

"14811981","1","14813377","","2013-02-11 12:32:47","","1","1837","<p>I'm trying to make a class which sets an image as its variable and tells the main class what image it is, then the main class paints it. Basically have an amount of objects that print themselves while they exist. I achieved this using <code>ImageIcon</code> but <code>BufferedImage</code> seems better for drawing many images at a time or images that move and so on, so I'd like to avoid using <code>ImageIcon</code>. Main class:</p>

<pre><code>package handBasket;

import java.awt.*;
import javax.swing.*;
public class AppStarter  extends JPanel
{
static ImageDisplayerTest idt;
public void paintComponent(Graphics g)
{
    g.drawImage(idt.demoPann, 0, 0, null);
}
public static void main(String[] args)
{        
    JFrame frame = new JFrame();
    frame.setSize(800,600);
    frame.getContentPane().add(new AppStarter());
    frame.setVisible(true);
    frame.setTitle(""The Great Graphical Achievement"");
    frame.setResizable(false);
    int w = frame.getSize().width;
    int h = frame.getSize().height;
    Dimension dim = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();
    int x = (dim.width-w)/2;
    int y = (dim.height-h)/2;
    frame.setLocation(x,y);
    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    idt = new ImageDisplayerTest();
    System.out.println(idt.demoPann);
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>This all worked fine while the image was an <code>ImageIcon</code>. As for the object that has the image to be drawn, it creates a File, reads the filename in to that file and tries to pass that file to the <code>BufferedImage</code> but that's where I get the <code>NullPointerException</code> saying that it cannot read the file. Tried with multiple files and filetypes, no change.</p>

<pre><code>package handBasket;

import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;

public class ImageDisplayerTest
{
BufferedImage demoPann;
File loadThis;
public ImageDisplayerTest()
        {
            loadThis = new File(""hp_small.jpg"");
            try 
            {
            demoPann = ImageIO.read(loadThis); 
            } 
            catch (IOException e) 
            {
            System.out.println(""wtf"");
            }
        }
}

<p>which, as I understand, is passing an anonymous function to the <code>noConflict()</code> object that was returned, which gives me the idea that <code>$j</code> is itself a function that does something. But I'm a little confused about how that attaches the above function as a <code>click</code> event to the expanding list links. Does anyone here understand it, and if so, can you explain it to me?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Rows&gt;
&lt;Row MANUFACTURERID=""76"" MANUFACTURERNAME=""Fondont"" ISMANU=""F"" ISAUTO=""F""/&gt;
&lt;Row MANUFACTURERID=""18"" MANUFACTURERNAME=""Anti"" ISMANU=""T"" ISAUTO=""T""/&gt;
&lt;/Rows&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I parse it so that there is an array of dictionaries (each dictionary has the four values of the Row in it).</p>

<p>I then pass ManufacturerName to my startSortingTheArray method like this</p>

<pre><code>if (dataSetToParse == @""ICMfg"") // ICMfg is a string passed to this view from the parent view cell selection enabling me to pass different data sets to this view
    {
       //Filter results (ISAUTO = T)
        NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""%K like %@"",@""ISAUTO"",@""T""];
        NSArray *filteredArray = [myDataArray filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];
        //Passes Manufacturer strigs over to startSortingtheArray method
        [self startSortingTheArray:[filteredArray valueForKey:@""MANUFACTURER""]];
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So from here all of the ManufacturerNames are sent to my method as an array of strings. I then use this array to set up all of my sections / index-scroller. The method below shows how I am doing this.</p>

<pre><code>//method to sort array and split for use with uitableview Index
- (IBAction)startSortingTheArray:(NSArray *)arrayData
{
    //If you need to sort incoming array alphabetically use this line of code
    //TODO: Check values coming in for capital letters and spaces etc
    sortedArray = [arrayData sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare:)];
    //If you want the standard array use this code
    //sortedArray = arrayData;

    self.letterDictionary = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    sectionLetterArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    //Index scrolling Iterate over values for future use
    for (NSString *value in sortedArray) 
    {
        // Get the first letter and its associated array from the dictionary.
        // If the dictionary does not exist create one and associate it with the letter.
        NSString *firstLetter = [[value substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(0, 1)] uppercaseString]; //uppercaseString puts lowercase values with uppercase

        NSMutableArray *arrayForLetter = [letterDictionary objectForKey:firstLetter];
        if (arrayForLetter == nil) 
        {
            arrayForLetter = [NSMutableArray array];
            [letterDictionary setObject:arrayForLetter forKey:firstLetter];

            [sectionLetterArray addObject:firstLetter]; // This will be used to set index scroller and section titles
        }
        // Add the value to the array for this letter
        [arrayForLetter addObject:value];
    }      
    //Reload data in table
    [self.tableView reloadData];
}
</code></pre>

<p>from here I do several things to do with setting up the tableview after <strong>[self.tableView reloadData];</strong> is called, The main thing being is that I set the cell up with the string values of the array.</p>

<pre><code>//Display cells with data
    NSArray *keys = [self.letterDictionary objectForKey:[self.sectionLetterArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.section]];
    NSString *key = [keys objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];

    cell.textLabel.text = key;
</code></pre>

<p>when the cell is then selected the string value inside the cell is then sent back to the main view and used later as a search parameter... The thing being is that I am setting up several parameters that will be used as one search string. </p>

<p>Looking back at the XML I parsed</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Rows&gt;
    &lt;Row MANUFACTURERID=""76"" MANUFACTURERNAME=""Fondont"" ISMANU=""F"" ISAUTO=""F""/&gt;
    &lt;Row MANUFACTURERID=""18"" MANUFACTURERNAME=""Anti"" ISMANU=""T"" ISAUTO=""T""/&gt;
&lt;/Rows&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These are the values of columns inside an SQl table that has a keyvalue MANUFACTURERID that is also found in other tables that I parse. I would like to use these key values to restrict/refine other queries but I just cannot figure out how to pass them to my parentview where I set up all of the search parameters, that is my question how can I save the dictionary of values that is related to the users tableview selection from the subview. So that I can then pass one or some of those values back to the subview of a different dataset to restrict the information that is displayed dependent on the users previous selections. </p>

<p>This has taken me about an hour to type up. Hopefully it makes sense, I am still fairly new to iOS development and Objective C, and this concept is really pushing my capabilities and before I move on and end up hasing some crap together that I will have to fix later on I am hoping that one or some of you will be able to lend your experience in this type of this to me so I can get this right first time :)</p>

<p>If you need me to clarify anything or provide you more information that will help you help me just let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Now i'm thinking about the database... 
Currently i have the Azure SQL Database in the Region West Europe.
it is a very small database and does not contain a large amount of data. There are mostly only relations, userdata and other stuff like that in it.</p>

<p>So what would now be the best practice to scale it to multiple regions?</p>

<p>I think i have the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leaf the database in that region and connect from other regions to the same database (here i fear mostly latency issues)</li>
<li>Create a database for each region and work with Database synchronisation</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the database synchronisation i could not find an answer which would explain what would happen in the following situation:</p>

<p>Initial State (both are sync):</p>

<p>Region A, Table A</p>

<p>id value</p>

<p>1  ""test""</p>

<p>2  ""test2""</p>

<p>3  ""test3""</p>

<p>Region B, Table A</p>

<p>id value</p>

<p>1  ""test""</p>

<p>2  ""test2""</p>

<p>3  ""test3""</p>

<p>Now data is added in both databases:</p>

<p>Region A, Table A</p>

<p>id value</p>

<p>1  ""test""</p>

<p>2  ""test2""</p>

<p>3  ""test3""</p>

<p>4  ""test4""</p>

<p>5  ""test5""</p>

<p>Region B, Table A</p>

<p>id value</p>

<p>1  ""test""</p>

<p>2  ""test2""</p>

<p>3  ""test3""</p>

<p>4  ""test6""</p>

<p>5  ""test7""</p>

<p>In the Documentation they always talk about if a row has been updated then the specific Rule ""Hub wins"" or ""Client wins"" apply. But what will happen in this situation where rows where added?
i believe that the final outcome after the sync will be (if hub wins is selected and the Hub is the Database in Region A):</p>

<p>4  ""test4""</p>

<p>5  ""test5""</p>

<p>So all changes in Region B will be ignored. is that right?
The PK in this table is an integer. Maybe this problem can be solved if the PK is a Guid i guess... </p>

<p>I'm currently not sure, what would be the best way to scale the database. I hope that somebody could give me a hint.
Does anybody have already experienced how the latency is inside the Azure Network accross multiple regions? </p>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

I have created a status route on my web service that simple returns 'ok' if the server is up-and-running properly and some error if it is not. I want to have several buttons (maybe better option?) that display green if the api call returns ok and red if not. One wrinkle is that these calls will be cross-domain albeit inside our corporate firewall.</p>

<p>Simple enough but I am a webservice developer that has next-to-no experience in this area. My thought was to make a call to each servers status route on page load and set the style. I am embarrassed to say that I am honestly not sure where to start. every tutorial I find seems to be missing some piece of the puzzle for it to 'click' for me.</p>

<p>So, my ultimate questions is whether there is a known tutorial that meets the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>html5/CSS3 enabled (preferably responsive design for mobile display)</li>
<li>jquery/angularjs libraries if necessary</li>
<li>cross-domain api calls supported</li>
<li>button (drawing) based on api call results.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is easy enough to just show with straight html and js in a question response body that would be fine as well. the only reason I added the other pieces is that this is just one small piece of a dashboard I'm building that will be integrating statistical graphs and management capabilities. So, starting with these capabilities would be ideal compared to integrating later.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. and please let me know if this question is not specific enough. I will edit.</p>

<p>There is an obvious separation between the start screen and the other two elements that are active during game time, so should there be two controllers, one to handle game events and one for out-of-game events?  Or is it bad practise to have multiple controllers in a very small application?</p>

<p>Maybe what I'm really trying to get at is: if you were reviewing this game as a prospective employer, would you look badly on there being a different controller for the different states of the application, or would you appreciate the seperation?</p>

The app has two forms: a quick launch and a view showing the details. The quick launch just has a tree with 2 levels, so the tree structure looks something like</p>

<ul>
<li>Category 1
<ul>
<li>Subcategory 1-1</li>
<li>Subcategory 1-2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Category 2
<ul>
<li>Subcategory 2-1
etc,</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>When the user clicks on a category or subcategory, the details view displays all items belonging to that category or subcategory. An item can belong to only one of category or subcategory (the items in my app are really documents such as orders, invoices, etc). Category's item and subcategory's item have almost identical properties but there is still a bit difference. </p>

<p>I have a controller class that handles the click event raised by the quick launch. The controller determines whether the user clicks on a category and subcategory, then gets all the items that belong to that category or subcategory. It then sends all the items to the details view to display them.</p>

<p>My questions is that is it better to use one generalized details view or create a view for each of category and subcategory? If I were to use one generalized view, I need to show/hide a few fields depending on whether the items belong to a category or subcategory, which might make it harder to maintain if category's item structure and subcategory's item structure becomes more different in the future.</p>

<p>If I were to create a view for each of category and subcategory, the controller needs to add the category view and remove the subcategory view when the user clicks on a category node. This is what bugs me because the controller needs to add/remove view from the main form when the user clicks on a node, which doesn't look like a good design to me.</p>

<p>So neither seems like a good design. What's the correct solution to this problem?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Which part is too vague. Basically, the user can see two types of items: CategoryItem and SubCategoryItem. SubCategoryItem is a child class of CategoryItem. In MVC pattern, do I need 2 views (call CategoryView and SubCategoryView) and the controller determine which view to render to the user? Or just one view so the controller always render this view and it's the view's job to determine whether to display CategoryView or SubCategoryItem?</p>

<p>Basically, the .swf movie is part of an add-on for forum communities. By that I mean that I don't know beforehand the full path of the .swf movie.</p>

<p>I.e. one may have his community in: </p>

<p>www.domain1.com/forum
OR
www.domain2.com/forums
OR
www.domain3.com/community</p>

<p>etc... In any case, the .swf movie will be in www.domainX.com/{some unknown folder}/{known1}/{known2}/movie.swf</p>

<p>I hope you understand everything so far.</p>

<p>My problem is what argument to use as the localPath of the getLocal method to store the LSO.</p>

<p>What I do so far is this: SharedObject.getLocal(""guid"", ""/"");</p>

<p>which creates a guid.sol file in #SharedObjects\X9X9X9X9\www.domain1.com</p>

<p>If I do it like this: SharedObject.getLocal(""guid""); (which is, totally omitting the localPath arguement, thus it'll use the full path), it will create a guid.sol file in #SharedObjects\X9X9X9X9\www.domain1.com\community\public\cache</p>

<p>So, without knowing the folder name the community will reside in, how can I store the LSO two folders before the full path?</p>

Currently this implementation works fine with detecting available services, getting updates using <code>ServiceListener</code> (<code>serviceAdded</code>, <code>serviceResolved</code>, <code>serviceRemoved</code>).</p>

<p>The service on the server side is implemented such that it detects ip address change, and re-registers  the service with new ip address. This should be detected by the Android app, however this is not working perfect (Sometimes it detects, sometimes not, it is driving me crazy).</p>

<p>Basically I have a list of <code>ServiceEvents</code>, containing all the resolved services. The new services are added only in callback <code>serviceResolved</code>, and they are removed in <code>serviceRemoved</code>. Very mysterious thing is, when the ip address is changed on the server side, neither of these callbacks are called, but the new ip address is added to the existing <code>ServiceEvent</code>. Anyone can explain how this is happening? I noticed it when I tried to view all the ip addresses of the existing <code>ServiceEvent</code> after the JmDNS host is re-registered at the server side, and found the new ip address in the list of addresses, without the callbacks being called. Am I missing some kind of a listener?
Please note that new event is added only in the <code>serviceResolved</code> callback, and nowhere else. And in my case this callback sometimes is not called at all (I have some other methods as well in this callback, and none of them are executed), and yet the existing <code>ServiceEvent</code> is updated with the new ip address...</p>

<p>Here is the code for the client side:</p>

<pre><code>public Hashtable&lt;String, ServiceEvent&gt; eventsByKey = new Hashtable&lt;String, ServiceEvent&gt;();

// initialize the JmDNS
JmDNS mDNS = JmDNS.create(myAddress);
mDNS.addServiceListener(type, new SrvListener(""_http._tcp.local.""));

private class SrvListener implements ServiceListener {


        /** Simple constructor */
        public SrvListener(String serviceType) {
            Log.d(TAG, ""service type: "" + serviceType);
        }

        /** Callback method for adding services */
        @Override
        public void serviceAdded(ServiceEvent event) {
            Log.i(TAG, ""serviceAdded"");

            // request resolution of service details
            mDNS.requestServiceInfo(event.getType(), event.getName(), true);
        }

        /** Callback method for removing services */
        @Override
        public void serviceRemoved(ServiceEvent event) {

                Log.i(TAG, ""serviceRemoved"");
                eventsByKey.remove(event.getInfo().getKey());
        }

        /** Callback method for resolution results */
        @Override
        public void serviceResolved(ServiceEvent event) {
                Log.i(TAG, ""serviceResolved"");
                eventsByKey.put(event.getInfo().getKey(), event);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The server side registers a service, and has a <code>NetworkTopologyListener</code>, which has these methods for registering new service and unregistering old one:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void inetAddressAdded(final NetworkTopologyEvent event) {

    log.debug(""Register mDNS service ("" + event.getInetAddress().getHostAddress() + "")"");

    final JmDNS jmdns = event.getDNS();
    final InetAddress address = event.getInetAddress();
    registerService(jmdns, address);
}

@Override
public void inetAddressRemoved(final NetworkTopologyEvent event) {

    log.debug(""Unregister mDNS service ("" + event.getInetAddress().getHostAddress() + "")"");

    final JmDNS jmdns = event.getDNS(); 
    unregisterService(jmdns);
}

I'll award bounty if you can come up with an alternative call to brandes_betweenness_centrality that will allow keeping the index external.</p>

<p>I'm trying to convert some of my old vecS code to work with listS, specifically the <code>brandes_betweenness_centrality</code> algorithm.</p>

<p>I'm trying to keep the Vertex and Edge properties very light weight and work mainly with external properties. The reason for this is that I don't know what all I'll want to associate with them at this point.</p>

<p>The errors I'm getting are coming from inside <code>adjacency_list.hpp</code> so I figure the problem is with our old friend <code>vertex_index_t</code> with listS.</p>

<p>The following code shows how to reproduce the compile error. In this working example, you can change the definition to stuff a vertex_index into the graph definition and change the set up in the betweenness method for completely working code (which runs betweenness correctly).</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/30248156/2912901"">answer</a>, helped me add <code>boost::vertex_index_t</code> property in the graph definition which allowed the code to run by using <code>boost::property&lt;boost::vertex_index_t,size_t,VertexProperties&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I would like a way to keep <code>vertex_index_t</code> completely external from the graph and add it just before I run the algorithm.</p>

<p>The virtually identical code for setting up edge_index allows this. Am I missing something or is this an MSVS thing or could it be a bug?</p>

<p><strong>My specific question is</strong>: What do I need to change to keep vertex_index out of the graph definition, add it on the fly, and still run the algorithm?</p>

<p>in other words, i need it to read the rows left to right. i have no problem separating each number, i just need it to read it in the specified order.</p>

<p>thank you all for your suggestions. ive tried the regexp and i forgot to mention that after each line there is a line break. i am not sure if this would impact the regex, but in any case, after i do the regex, i get the following order: 0, 6.65, 84..??, 35.... etc</p>

"12701009","1","12701037","","2012-10-03 02:05:14","","0","1142","<p>I'm trying to use a timer to send an email every minute. The information for each email is taken from values for each row of components I have on a form. I can send the emails without using the timer, so I know the email method works. But when I try to implement the timer, the emails do not get sent. I read the docs on the timer class, and I believe this should work. But I'm not familiar with it enough to really know what to do. Here is the code:</p>

<p>Here is the email method:</p>

<pre><code>//method to send email to outlook
public void sendEMailThroughOUTLOOK(string recipient, 
    string subject, string body)
{        
    try
    {    
        // Create the Outlook application.
        Outlook.Application oApp = new Outlook.Application();
        // Create a new mail item.
        Outlook.MailItem oMsg = 
            (Outlook.MailItem)oApp.CreateItem(Outlook.OlItemType.olMailItem);
        // Set HTMLBody. 
        //add the body of the email
        oMsg.Body = body;

        oMsg.Subject = subject;
        // Add a recipient.
        Outlook.Recipients oRecips = (Outlook.Recipients)oMsg.Recipients;
        // Change the recipient in the next line if necessary.
        Outlook.Recipient oRecip = (Outlook.Recipient)oRecips.Add(recipient);
        oRecip.Resolve();
        // Send.
        oMsg.Send();
        // Clean up.
        oRecip = null;
        oRecips = null;
        oMsg = null;
        oApp = null;
    }//end of try block
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
    } //end of catch
} //end of Email Method
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the timer event:</p>

<pre><code>private void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
{
    foreach (rowClass row in this.rows)
    {
        string recipientAddress = ""roomcheckstest@gmail.com"";

        //sendEMailThroughOUTLOOK(recipientAddress, subjectLine, finalbody);
    }       
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is where the timer is created inside a send email button on the form, which should in theory call the email method:</p>

<pre><code>private void submitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (rows[0].buildingComboBox.SelectedIndex &gt; -1)
    {
        System.Timers.Timer time = new System.Timers.Timer();
        time.Interval = 300000;
        time.Enabled = true;
        time.Elapsed += new ElapsedEventHandler(OnTimedEvent);

        MessageBox.Show(""Issues Sent"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I send an email for each row of components on the form (the user adds rows as needed)
The email is sent through outlook (it has to be sent through outlook using exchange server)
I need to delay it because the server will not accept them all at once. My understanding of the timer class must be flawed. I cant figure out why this isn't working. </p>

<pre><code>Sorry, ActiveSync doesn't support what you're trying to do
</code></pre>

<p>However, <strong>manually</strong> dragging that very same message to that very same folder works fine!</p>

<p>I am aware that -by design- the EAS provider for Outlook is unable to move mail items from outside (like a .PST store) into a Hotmail folder, as this violates the ""no import"" restriction on Hotmail.</p>

<p>But this particular behaviour here imho cannot be explained this way, since in that case it shouldn't be able to support the manual drag &amp; drop case either!  Nor has it anything to do with importing anything into Hotmail, as the item is moved solely between folders within a single Hotmail store.</p>

<p>So I'm left wondering: is this by design or is it a bug? 
And is there perhaps a workaround? </p>

<h3>Quick repro case:</h3>

<p>(this assumes <a href=""http://www.dimastr.com/outspy"" rel=""nofollow"">OutlookSpy</a> is installed - but it should be quite easy to simulate as well using a basic VSTO add-in)</p>

<p>add a hotmail/outlook.com account to your Outlook profile</p>

<p>create a childfolder in the hotmail/outlook.com inbox</p>

<p>position on a mail item in the hotmail/outlook.com inbox</p>

<p>click on the OutlookSpy ribbon tab</p>

<p>click on the Item button in OutlookSpy ribbon</p>

<p>click on the Script tab in the MailItem dialog</p>

<p>enter the following script and press Run:</p>

<pre><code>set inbox = MailItem.Parent    
set childfolder = inbox.Folders.item(1)
MailItem.Move childFolder

{

<p>However, when iOS performs the ""zoom in"" animation that is performed when an app is moved from the background to the foreground, it still shows the previous <code>rootViewController</code>'s view.  Then, as soon as the animation is complete, the app blasts the new <code>rootViewController</code>'s view onto the screen.</p>

<p>One way to solve this is to simply move that code to <code>- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:</code>, but the problem with this solution is that, in my app, there is no way to tell if a new <code>rootViewController</code> will be assigned until <code>- (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application</code> (it is based on time passed since leaving the app).</p>

<p>Basically this is a homework assignment, however, I am not looking for a solution as I have already seen a working solution for this on SO.

The idea is to count how many 0's or whatever element / atom are within a list then display / return.</p>

<p>I am sure by looking at the code it will be easy to see what my logic is doing. The issue I am having is incrementing the totalZeros variable each time I recurse. (+ 5 myNum) would certainly add 5 to whatever myNum is. Hence why doesn't (+ 1 totalZeros) seem to be working? When I step through the debugger I can see that the totalZeros variable never changes. It is always zero...</p>

We´ve created a single page with a commandButton, a outputText and 50 composite components that contains a p:dialog. Click on the button just updates the outputText component (Ajax).

<p>Trying the regex in <a href=""http://regexpal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">regexpal.com</a>, I get a match only for the part excluding the message, i.e. the match is, according to regexpal,</p>

<pre><code>123 [main] INFO org.apache.log4j.whatever x=8 - 
</code></pre>

<p>(with a space in the end). Apparently, the regex needs to be closed with a $ sign for the message to be included.</p>

<p>Am I making any mistake in the pattern definition?</p>

We have about well over 10k+ rows of data with spatial attributes of latitudes and longitudes. We would like to sort and fetch the object(around 300) closest to my current location.</p>

<p>What has been done:
Created OrmLite Object Table that stores all the rows with lat and long being double. Currently calling queryForAll and using Comparable interface (distanceTo) to sort the data in order of distance from current location.</p>

<p>Problem:
The above solution is highly inefficient as number of rows increases beyond 10K+, it takes long time to perform the sort operation. </p>

<p>Question:
a. Is there a way to handle Spatial data in Ormlite or even adding Android Location as a column?
b. Can we call raw query that gives list of objects, I would prefer this approach as the sorting takes place while querying itself.</p>

The most common is obviously the GDI way. And it is decent in performance as well. Depending on the system load and static/non-static screen content, the screen capture rate ranged from 27-47 fps (Windows 7, Intel i5@2.6 GHz, 8 GB RAM).</p>

<p>Now, with DirectX front buffer approach(using the GetFrontBufferData() API), the performance was comparable but slightly on the slower side(I couldn't reach as high as 48 fps).</p>

<p>I went through this post: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5069104/fastest-method-of-screen-capturing"">Fastest method of screen capturing</a> and the tried out the way suggested in the accepted answer using getRenderTarget() and getRenderTargetData(), but as suggested in the comments, all I get is a black image. Here is my complete code including initial configurations for the device:</p>

<pre><code>    IDirect3DSurface9* pRenderTarget=NULL;
    IDirect3DSurface9* pDestTarget=NULL;
    // sanity checks.
    if (g_pd3dDevice == NULL){
      return;
    }
    HRESULT hr;
    // get the render target surface.
    hr = g_pd3dDevice-&gt;GetRenderTarget(0, &amp;pRenderTarget);
    // get the current adapter display mode.
    //hr = pDirect3D-&gt;GetAdapterDisplayMode(D3DADAPTER_DEFAULT,&amp;d3ddisplaymode);

    // create a destination surface.
    hr = g_pd3dDevice-&gt;CreateOffscreenPlainSurface(1600, 900, D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8, D3DPOOL_SYSTEMMEM, &amp;pDestTarget, NULL);
   //copy the render target to the destination surface.
   hr = g_pd3dDevice-&gt;GetRenderTargetData(pRenderTarget, pDestTarget);

   D3DLOCKED_RECT lockedRect;
   hr =pDestTarget-&gt;LockRect(&amp;lockedRect,NULL, D3DLOCK_NO_DIRTY_UPDATE|D3DLOCK_NOSYSLOCK|D3DLOCK_READONLY);

    for( int i=0 ; i &lt; 900 ; i++)
    {
        for(int j=0; j &lt; 1600; j++){
            memcpy( (BYTE*) data + i * 1600 * 3 + j * 3, (BYTE*) lockedRect.pBits + i* lockedRect.Pitch + j * 4,  3);
        }
    }
    pDestTarget-&gt;UnlockRect();
   // clean up.
   pRenderTarget-&gt;Release();
   pDestTarget-&gt;Release();
</code></pre>

<p>And for the device Initialization part:</p>

<pre><code>g_pDirect3D = Direct3DCreate9(D3D_SDK_VERSION); 
D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS PresentParams; 
memset(&amp;PresentParams, 0, sizeof(D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS)); 
PresentParams.Windowed = TRUE;

</code></pre>

<p>Please point out the mistake in the above code. Any suggestions are welcome. I also tried the GetBackBuffer() API but I couldn't get hold of the image data.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>My use case was to capture desktop screen which seems to be done only using GetFrontBufferData() via directX. GetBackBuffer()/GetRenderTargetData() is not the correct API to call for this case. Reference: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12859894/the-desktop-capture-with-directx-does-not-work/12863143#12863143"">The desktop capture with DirectX does not work</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12879880/how-to-get-the-screenshot-of-the-desktop-from-back-buffer-with-directx?rq=1"">How to get the screenshot of the desktop from back buffer with DirectX</a>.</p>

<p>However, any suggestions to a faster method for capturing desktop screen or optimizing the GDI way are welcome.</p>

<ul>
<li>three docker containers each hosting a kafka/zookeeper server pair</li>
<li>six docker containers with three of them for kafka servers and three others for zookeeper servers</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm asking this because it seems to me like a three-node Zookeeper cluster  only survives single-node failure, whilst a three-node Kafka cluster could potentially survive a two-node failure (you may have to set the topic replication factor to 3). So is it better to run them in different containers if it isn't so costly to create new containers? Speaking of which, how costly is it to start a new Docker container?</p>

<p>In case I am advised to run one server per container, is it more preferred to build a tailored Docker image for every kind of server (in this case, one docker image for kafka and another for zookeeper), or one unified image for all different servers? I'm guessing it doesn't make sense to create two separate images just for kafka and zookeeper but what if i have all different kinds of clusters and servers, think elasticsearch, to simulate? at what point would it start to make sense to create different docker images to be used inside a single project?</p>

The product of e to the power of a normally distributed variable with a mean of 0 should be 1. But when I do it in Python, I get a product that is higher than 1. Any explanation for this?</p>

<pre><code>sumProduct = 0.0
iterations = 100000

for j in range(iterations):

    product = 1.0
    for i in range(10):
        normalVar = numpy.random.normal(0.0, 0.1)
        product *= math.exp(normalVar)

    sumProduct += product

print sumProduct/iterations # Outputs 1.05
</code></pre>

<p>Shouldn't it output 1.0? The expected value of the product variable should be 1.0, and the average of all the product variables should be 1.0. So why does it output 1.05? (Changing the number of iterations and the standard deviation changes the output, but it always greater than one). Thanks for the help!</p>

I read up on all I could find about GUIs in cocoa applescript, and I wanted to convert this:</p>

<pre><code>choose from list baseactions with title ""Version Control"" default items defaultaction with prompt ""What do you want to do?"" OK button name ""Go"" cancel button name ""Quit""
set choice1 to result as string
if choice1 = false then
    error number -128
else if choice1 = ""Make New Project"" then
    set thechoice to ""new""
else if choice1 = ""Edit Existing Project"" then
    set choice2 to button returned of (display dialog ""What would you like to do with the existing Project?"" buttons {""Quit"", ""Make new version"", ""Create Project Folder""} default button 3 with title ""Version Control"" with icon ""Icon.png"")
    if choice2 = ""Quit"" then
       error number -128
    else if choice2 = ""Create Project Folder"" then
       set thechoice to ""folder""
    else if choice2 = ""Make new version"" then
       set thechoice to ""version""
    end if
else if choice1 = ""Change Settings"" then
    set thechoice to ""settings""
end if
</code></pre>

<p>to a GUI in which instead of multiple dialog boxes, it is one smooth GUI in which when you press a button, depending on which is pressed, it sets 'thechoice' to either ""new"", ""folder"", ""version"" or ""settings"" and then the rest of the script continues off that. I have already made the GUI in Xcode:
[I don't have enough reputation to post pictures, but the GUI looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Make New Project
Import to Existing Project
Edit Existing Project

Settings
</code></pre>

<p>and linked each button to a handler (eg the ""Make New Project"" button):</p>

<pre><code>on NewProject_(sender)
    set thechoice to ""new""
end
</code></pre>

<p>And similar handlers for each button. The problem is, after I press the button, it doesn't continue with the rest of the script - it just stops. So for anyone who knows how Cocoa-Applescripts work, I would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>I'm making a small app for Mac in Java with a main menu for the user, so he can choose several options.</p>

<p>One of them is install an app using a .pkg</p>

<p>Everything was working fine with these commands:</p>

<pre><code>File instFolder = new File(System.getProperty(""user.dir"") + ""/foldername/appInstaller.pkg"");
String s = ""open ""+ instFolder.toString();
Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(s);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I realized that there is a problem when foldername has spaces or if I copy this java file with the needed subfolders to a USB pen drive with ""NO NAME"" as name (or some name with spaces).</p>

<p>Because s will become something like:
<br>
<br>
open /Volumes/NO NAME/foldername/appInstaller.pkg<br>
or<br>
open /Users/user1/Desktop/folder name/appInstaller.pkg<br>
<br>
<br><br>
So when you run the p process, the command will finish where the first space appears on the path
<br>
<br>
open /Volumes/NO<br>
or<br>
open /Users/user1/Desktop/folder<br>
<br>
<br>
To try to fix this I changed the s definition for something like this:</p>

<pre><code>String s = ""open ""+ ""\"""" + instFolder.toString() + ""\"""";
</code></pre>

<p>It stopped working fine.  The strange thing is that if i copy the s value (after creating the s variable) and paste it in the terminal it works:
<br><br>
open ""/Users/user1/Desktop/folder name/appInstaller.pkg""<br>
<br><br>
but running it from Java it does't work.</p>

<p>Could you help me, please?</p>

<pre><code>$apeasy = dir .\APEasy\*.csv | Import-CSV -delimiter '|'

<p>The problem is this returns null. Without exception, no matter what I do.
The weird thing is that this works:</p>

<pre><code>dir .\APEasy\*.csv
</code></pre>

<p>It returns a FileInfo object, which SHOULD be getting piped into Import-CSV as the file to import. In addition, these two commands work:</p>

<pre><code>$csvFiles = dir .\Processed_Data_Review -Filter *.txt | Import-CSV -header(1..19) -delimiter ""$([char]0x7C)""
dir .\LIMS -Filter *.csv | Import-CSV | ? {$_.SampleName -like ""????-*""}| Export-CSV -Path .\lims_output.txt -NoTypeInformation
</code></pre>

<p>I really have no idea what's going on here. I'm dealing with a basic pipe-delimited file, quotations around every field (which is fine, I can import the data with those). Nothing special going on here. The file is THERE, Import-CSV just isn't GETTING it for some reason.</p>

<p>So my question is this: What could cause a file grabbed by 'dir' to fail to be piped into Import-CSV?</p>

<p>EDIT: The overall goal of this is to read the CSV files in a directory without knowing their name in advance, and output specific columns into a variety of output files.</p>

<p>EDIT: This is the line of code as it stands right now:</p>

<pre><code>$apeasy = Get-ChildItem .\APEasy\*.csv | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName | Import-CSV -delimiter ""$([char]0x7C)""
</code></pre>

<p>Isolating the Get-ChildItem statement, and isolating Get-Child and Select-Object both return what they should. A list of csv files in the directory, and an array of their full paths, respectively. Still, when they get piped into Import-CSV, they dissappear. Get-Member on the variable returns that it's empty.</p>

<p>For example, if I navigate to:</p>

<p>The page loads the first blog post as it should. But what I am trying to accomplish is instead of calling the post by ""postid"" and ""type"" I would like to call the post buy its slug name.</p>

<p>I can accomplish echoing the slug name by using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $post-&gt;post_name; ?&gt;

<p>But how can I call the article by slug in my code. And how can I then transform my url from:</p>

<p>I am adding a map on my website with geocoded entries. Each entry into the table is a business. Each entry/business currently has a field/column for</p>

<p>(<code>name</code>, <code>address</code>, <code>lat</code>, <code>lng</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>url</code>) </p>

<p>Screenshot Here <a href=""http://postimg.org/image/3z8kcwq4b/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://postimg.org/image/3z8kcwq4b/</a></p>

<p>I was able to add the <code>url</code> field and it be displayed properly on the map markers. I need to be able to also add two more fields. 1 for 'phonenumber' and one for 'description.</p>

<p>the purpose of the above entries into the database is that when they click a marker on the map of an entry/business it will display information about that business. I can't get it to show this information when clicked. The code that I believe to be relevant to my issue is below.</p>

<p>here is the code I currently have.</p>

<pre><code>  var name = markers[i].getAttribute(""name"");
  var address = markers[i].getAttribute(""address"");
  var url = markers[i].getAttribute(""url"");
  var type = markers[i].getAttribute(""type"");
  var point = new google.maps.LatLng(
      parseFloat(markers[i].getAttribute(""lat"")),
      parseFloat(markers[i].getAttribute(""lng"")));
  var html = '&lt;a href=""' + url + '""&gt;' + name + '&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;' + address + ' &lt;br/&gt;' ;

<p>I need to be able to add more info into the database so i can make the map call it. I would like for it to display a phone number and description when they click the map marker for that business.</p>

<p>(the above code pulls data from the tables on the database and displays the url of the business, the name of it, it's long/lat-geocoded, and it's address.)</p>

<p>I have been able to completely add this into my site except for this. Last thing i'm stuck on. Any help as always is more than appreciated! </p>

<p>Using a signed int is probably easiest and most space efficient, but has the disadvantage that they're not human readable and if someone forgets to do the conversion, some of them will work, which may obscure errors.</p>

<p>Raw binary is probably most difficult for inexperienced programmers to deal with, and also suffers from non-human-readability.</p>

<p>A string representation is the least space efficient (~40 bytes in unicode vs 8 bytes per field), but then at least all of the possible values will map properly, and for querying only a conversion to string is required instead of a more complicated conversion.</p>

<p>I need these values to be available from different platforms, so a single driver-specific solution isn't an option.</p>

<p>As a test I have built a simple article system that has 4 tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>articles
<ul>
<li>article_id</li>
<li>article_format_id</li>
<li>article_title</li>
<li>article_body</li>
<li>article_date</li>
</ul></li>
<li>article_categories 
<ul>
<li>article_id</li>
<li>category_id</li>
</ul></li>
<li>categories
<ul>
<li>category_id</li>
<li>category_title</li>
</ul></li>
<li>formats
<ul>
<li>format_id</li>
<li>format_title</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>An article can be in more than one category but only have one format. I feel this is a good example of a real-life situation.</p>

<p>On the category page which lists all of the articles (pulling in the format_title as well) this could be easily achieved with the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT articles.*, formats.format_title 
FROM articles 
INNER JOIN formats ON articles.article_format_id = formats.format_id 
INNER JOIN article_categories ON articles.article_id = article_categories.article_id 
WHERE article_categories.category_id = 2 
ORDER BY articles.article_date DESC
</code></pre>

<p>However the script I am trying to build would receive this query, parse it and run the queries individually.</p>

<p>So in this category page example the script would effectively run this (worked out dynamically):</p>

<pre><code>// Select article_categories
$sql = ""SELECT * FROM article_categories WHERE category_id = 2"";
$query = mysql_query($sql);
while ($row_article_categories = mysql_fetch_array($query, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {

    // Select articles
    $sql2 = ""SELECT * FROM articles WHERE article_id = "" . $row_article_categories['article_id'];
    $query2 = mysql_query($sql2);
    while ($row_articles = mysql_fetch_array($query2, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {

        // Select formats
        $sql3 = ""SELECT * FROM formats WHERE format_id = "" . $row_articles['article_format_id'];
        $query3 = mysql_query($sql3);
        $row_formats = mysql_fetch_array($query3, MYSQL_ASSOC);

        // Merge articles and formats
        $row_articles = array_merge($row_articles, $row_formats);

        // Add to array
        $out[] = $row_articles;
    }
}

// Sort articles by date
foreach ($out as $key =&gt; $row) {
    $arr[$key] = $row['article_date'];
}

array_multisort($arr, SORT_DESC, $out);

// Output articles - this would not be part of the script obviously it should just return the $out array
foreach ($out as $row) {
    echo '&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""article.php?id='.$row['article_id'].'""&gt;'.$row['article_title'].'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;('.$row['format_title'].')&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'.$row['article_body'].'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=""date""&gt;'.date(""F jS Y"", strtotime($row['article_date'])).'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;';
}
</code></pre>

<p>The challenges of this are working out the correct queries in the right order, as you can put column names for SELECT and JOIN's in any order in the query (this is what MySQL and other SQL databases translate so well) and working out the information logic in PHP.</p>

<p>I am currently parsing the query using <a href=""http://pear.php.net/package/SQL_Parser"" rel=""nofollow"">SQL_Parser</a> which works well in splitting up the query into a multi-dimensional array, but working out the stuff mentioned above is the headache.</p>

<p>Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I find that there is a field <strong>""version""</strong> in <strong>""JournalArticle""</strong> table , but not in <strong>""JournalTemplate""</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario/Requirement:</strong> 
We have developed our pages containing a set of journal articles. The code for the journal template resides in its editor itself. (Unlike coming from a versioned theme plugin using #parse()). </p>

<p>I understand , that placing the code in the template's editor is not a very good idea, but our clients want it that way , so that their content editors don’t have to wait for a code roll-out to carry out their changes.</p>

<p>So whenever a change is made to the template , we want it to be versioned, so that we can revert back to any of the earlier versions , when needed.</p>

<p>Let's say I have 10 sets of documents and for each set I have calculated the cosine similarity matrix based on the term frequency matrix of the set.</p>

<p>In R we can simulate my list of cosine similarity matrices like this</p>

<pre><code>cosine_simil_mat &lt;- list()
for (i in 1:10) {
  cosine_simil_mat[[i]] &lt;-
    matrix(rnorm(n=100, mean=0.89, sd=.2),ncol=10)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for each matrix, I can visualise the distance separating each document on a plane with this</p>

<pre><code>mds &lt;- cmdscale(1-cosine_simil_mat[[1]], eig=TRUE, k=2)
x &lt;- mds$points[,1]
y &lt;- mds$points[,2]
</code></pre>

<p>(note the <code>1-</code> part, since make more sense to visualise the dissimilarities (or distance) not the similarities)</p>

<p>I can plot my <code>mds</code> with </p>

<pre><code>mds_df &lt;-
  data.frame(x,y, type=c(""alpha"", c(rep(""betas"",dim(cosine_simil_mat[[i]])[1]-1)) ) )

require(ggplot2)
ggplot(mds_df, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = type)) + geom_density2d() + theme_bw()
</code></pre>

<p>which plots</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pL8Br.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pL8Br.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now, what I want to do is to understand how my document of interest (<code>alpha</code>), which is always the first row/column of the cosine similarity matrix, behaves in the different sets. Specifically, I want to measure the distance of my document <code>alpha</code> from the densest part of each plot, in order to understand whether the document <code>alpha</code> is at the core of the sets, measured in terms of relative term frequencies, or at the periphery and if its position change in the different sets. </p>

<p>Does any statistic capture this distance from the densest part of the plot? Does it make any sense?</p>

<p>i am doing a Facebook Connect integration with CI2.0, based on this guy's work: </p>

<p><a href=""http://hitsend.ca/2010/10/facebook-connect-user-authentication-using-the-new-graph-api-in-codeigniter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hitsend.ca/2010/10/facebook-connect-user-authentication-using-the-new-graph-api-in-codeigniter/</a></p>

<p>which I've upgraded to 2.0</p>

<p>some relevant code bits are:</p>

<p>config/facebook.php:</p>

<pre><code>
 $config['facebook_api_key'] = 'xxx';  (it is the ID, not the key, as he misnamed his array key)
 $config['facebook_secret_key'] = 'xxx'; 
</code></pre>

<p>controllers/fb_login.php</p>

<pre><code>
    function index() {
        $this->load->library('fb_connect');
</code></pre>

<p>libraries/fb_connect.php</p>

<pre><code>
    include(APPPATH.'libraries/facebook/facebook.php');

    class fb_connect {
          ....

        function fb_connect()
        {
            //Using the CodeIgniter object, rather than creating a copy of it
            $this->_obj =& get_instance();

            //loading the config paramters for facebook (where we stored our Facebook API and SECRET keys
            $this->_obj->load->config('facebook');
            //make sure the session library is initiated. may have already done this in another method.
            $this->_obj->load->library('session'); 

            $this->_api_key        = $this->_obj->config->item('facebook_api_key');
            $this->_secret_key    = $this->_obj->config->item('facebook_secret_key');

            $this->appkey = $this->_api_key;

            //connect to facebook
            $this->fb = new Facebook(array(
                          'appId'  => $this->_api_key,
                          'secret' => $this->_secret_key,
                          'cookie' => true
                        ));
</code></pre>

<p>and finally, the facebook php library:
libraries/facebook/facebook.php</p>

<pre><code>
  public function __construct($fb_config) {
print_r($fb_config);
    $this->setAppId($fb_config['appId']);
    $this->setApiSecret($fb_config['secret']);
    if (isset($fb_config['cookie'])) {
      $this->setCookieSupport($fb_config['cookie']);
    }

</code></pre>

<p>The best way I can describe the issue is just to give you the output of print_r($fb_config):</p>

<pre><code>Array ( [facebook_api_key] => xxx [facebook_secret_key] => xxx) </code></pre>

<p>and 
Message: Undefined index: appId
Message: Undefined index: secret</p>

<p>The facebook __construct() has been loading with the config file's $config[] array; no idea why it is doing this.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any leads or spottings of ""dumb things I've done""</p>

<p>Here he doesn't configure, so I have to download libgmp.so.3 and install it</p>

<pre><code>sudo make install

<p>GHC installs properly.</p>

<p>Now I try running it with ghci and get an error of missing libgmp.so.
I download it as well and install. Both using ubuntu software center and from pkgs.com</p>

<p>Now I run ghci. It works fine. I try:</p>

<p>Here my real problem starts:</p>

I don't understand what I'm suppose to do.  I've got the public wrapper that calls on the private one... but the public one is the one with the function being passed in so what do I even do with it??  I feel retarded so even if someone were to give me a small hint I'm sure I'd get it.  I just don't know where to go from here.</p>

<p><strong>MAIN.py</strong></p>

<p>This scripts does nothing except initiating the whole process and calling another python script through <code>subprocess</code></p>

<pre><code>paramet = ['parameter']
# Calling Subprocess 
result = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable,""./sub_process.py""] + paramet)
result.wait()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>sub_process.py</strong></p>

<p>This is the script which first executes bunch of SQL statements and then initiate another <code>subprocess</code> by calling itself again. The number of subprocess spawned depends on the <code>parameter</code> being passed with each <code>subprocess</code> call. Also the SQl statements are mostly <code>insert</code> statements</p>

<pre><code>    conn = connect(host=host_ip, port=21050, timeout=3600)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    sql = ""SQL statement""
    cursor.execute(sql)
    result_set = cursor.fetchall()

    for col1, col2 in result_set:
        sql = ""SQL statement 2""
        cursor.execute(sql)

        sql = ""SQL statement 3""
        cursor.execute(sql)

               result = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable,""./sub_process.py""] + paramet)

   result.wait()
</code></pre>

<p>Now this setup works fine on my local machine but when I am trying to run the same setup on server <strong>it throws following error:</strong></p>

<pre><code>File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/impala/dbapi/hiveserver2.py"", line 151, in execute

    raise OperationalError(""Operation is in ERROR_STATE"")
OperationalError: Operation is in ERROR_STATE
</code></pre>

<p>When I go to impala UI to check status of queries then I see exception as state. Also on the profile of queries shown as exception it says <strong>""Query Status: Memory limit exceeded""</strong>. But when I execute the same queries from my local machine then there is no exception and everything runs fine.</p>

<p>Even if I execute only one sql statements instead of bunch of sqls the same error comes on server but not on my local machine. I tried to look for some reasons for this but couldn't find anything which might provide the reason for this error.</p>

<p><strong>I have also tried the python threading and still got the same errors as they were coming with subprocess. The structure of the threading code is same as it is for subprocess above.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I have CentOS 6.6, impala 2.0 and impyla 0.9 on my server</strong></p>

<p>How can I find the reason for this and resolve it? Also what could be a workaround to get the same behavior through other ways if this is not getting resolved? What I basically want is that once a process reaches a certain point in its execution, it should start another process and also continue to keep on executing simultaneously. Once it is done then it should wait for the subprocess to finish before exiting.</p>

"27338589","1","27338656","","2014-12-07 01:29:16","","3","62","<p><strong>What I'm trying to do:</strong></p>

<p>I'm creating a class hierarchy that represents and has utilities for a lot of linear algebra concepts (both to practice linear algebra and to practice Java, which I'm learning right now).
All went pretty well until I decided to add the different types of numbers, that is, integers, rationals, reals and complex (for now).</p>

<p>What I want is to be able to operate with them (for example, inside a Matrix class) without having to care about which number type I'm operating with, and implement all the operations inside different classes representing each number type.</p>

<p><strong>What I thought/tried:</strong></p>

<p>I thought it was a good idea to make an interface called ""AnyNumber"" (since Number is already taken by the Java API) on which I'd define all the necessary abstract methods, and then implement that interface on each number type class.
The problem is, I can't figure out how to handle class types.</p>

<p>Here is what the interface declaration would look like:</p>

<pre><code>public interface AnyNumber {

    public AnyNumber add(AnyNumber other);
    public AnyNumber subtract(AnyNumber other);
    public AnyNumber multiply(AnyNumber other);
    public AnyNumber divide(AnyNumber other);

}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, I'd be able to operate with any objects that implement the interface by simple calling methods like:</p>

<pre><code>number1 = number1.add(number2)
</code></pre>

<p><br>
<strong>The problems I had</strong></p>

<p>The problem comes when trying to implement the interface methods on a particular class.<br>
I thought Java understood that the type ""AnyNumber"" could be any type that implements the interface, so I tried declaring the methods like this:</p>

<pre><code>public IntegerNumber add(IntegerNumber other) {
    return new IntegerNumber(this.value + other.value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But Eclipse complained that I did not not implement the following method:</p>

<pre><code>AnyNumber add(AnyNumber other)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I though that I could just change the return and argument types to ""AnyNumber"", but soon realized I couldn't access the variable ""value"" inside ""other"" because the interface doesn't define it.</p>

<p>So I thought maybe what I needed was an abstract class that defined all the necessary fields and abstract methods for all the different types of number, but I'm not sure if that's a good approach, since integer numbers just need one field, while rationals need two, and complex need also two but I'd like to name them different. Also, something keeps telling me that an interface makes a lot of sense in this situation..</p>

<p>..So I though maybe what I needed were generics. But I don't yet fully understand them and all my attempts to use them to solve this problem have miserably failed.</p>

<p><strong>Please help</strong></p>

<p>I realized I'll not be able to solve this alone... I really want to continue working on this project and learn how to deal with this kind of situations in Java.</p>

<p>Your help is very much appreciated!</p>

<p>The service has a bunch of XSD files and we intend to generate out classes from these XSD's using xsd2code for Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I have a few thoughts/worries however. The names for the properties in the class are a little curt and I'd like to make them a bit more friendly, so instead of </p>

<pre><code>private string ix_Rep_St { get; }
</code></pre>

<p>I'd rather it was something like:</p>

<pre><code>private string BookingStatus

<p>Even better I'd like it to have intellisense which I could add by editing the generated classes however as mentioned we are expecting these to change a little which could mean having to regenerate it all.</p>

<p>I'm after a way to end up with a set of classes that work with the service, yet are easy to code against (ie they use readable syntax) and have intellisense. I'm not sure how best to go about it.</p>

<p>My options seem to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find away to separate out comments from the generated class file?</li>
<li>Generate everytime and put up with it, have some higher level classes interact with these nastily named ones from the service which should keep the mess contained.</li>
<li>Wrap all my classes in new human friendly wrappers with intellisense added in. Store the XSD's in source control and use that to highlight when something has changed then manually add it in</li>
</ul>

<p>The wrapper sounds appealing if it where not for the amount of files I need to wrap, 30+ by my rough calculations which makes it feel like a bit of a slog.</p>

<p><h1>Background</h1>  I am building a dll that has an MEF container, and uses a DirectoryCatalog to find a local plugin folder.  I call this dll currently from a simple WinForm, that is setup to with a seperate project to use ShadowCopy so i can overwrite the dlls in my plugin folder. Instead of using a FileWatcher to update this folder, I am exposing a public method that calls refresh on the DirectoryCatalog, so i can update the assemblies at will instead of automatically.</p>

<h1>Code</h1>

<p>base class instantiates the MEF catalogs and container, and saves them as class variables for referential access later</p>

    private CompositionContainer _container;
    private DirectoryCatalog dirCatalog;

    public FieldProcessor()
    {

    }

} ...

<p>here's the plugin i'm trying to overwrite. My test of updating, is that the stings returned are output to a text box, I change the Strings the plugin is returning, rebuild, and copy it in to the plugin folder.  But it does not update for the running app, until i close and restart the app.</p>

<p><h1>Research</h1> I have done fairly extensive research and everywhere in articles and code samples the answer appears to be, to add a DirectoryCatalog to a container and save a reference of that catalog, then call Refresh on that reference, after a new plugin has bee added, and it will update the assemblies...which i am doing, but it's not showing updated output, from the new plugin dll.</p>

<p><h1>Request</h1> Has anyone seen this issue, or know what may be causing my problems with the assemblies not updating during runtime?  Any additional information or insight would be appreciated.</p>

<p><h1>Resolution</h1> Thanks to Panos and Stumpy for their links which led me to the solution my issue.  For future knowledge seekers, my main issue was that the Refresh method does not update assemblies, when the new assembly has the exact same assembly name as the overwritten dll.  For my POC i just tested rebuilding with a Date appended to the assembly name and everything else the same, and it worked like a charm. their links in the comments below, were very useful, and are recommended if you have the same issue.</p>

<p>The problem more so is the process of how i have the data.</p>

<p>Here is grab the data i need.</p>

<pre><code>$results = mysql_query($query);
     while($rows = mysql_fetch_assoc($results)){
            extract($rows);
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to grab a column of <code>item_specifiations</code>. Within this column there are multiple data, separated by commas. Some items have more data that others, some are lacking certain data. </p>

<pre><code>$specs = explode("","" , $item_specification);
</code></pre>

<p>I separate the data using the above method.Then i run the loop to show the data for each item in the DB. </p>

<pre><code>foreach($specs as $spec =&gt; $key ){
</code></pre>

<p>This now returns every data separated for each item (UPC, PRODUCT_NAME, ETC), which is exactly what i need. But i need only the ""BRAND"" of the item. So i do the following.</p>

<pre><code>  if (strpos($key, 'Brand') === 0) {
        $brand = explode(':', $key);                
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem i am having is certain items having duplicate brand names.</p>

<p>So i want to remove any strings that are returning. The problem is, since this is a loop, there is no way to compare the strings with each other. Each is its own array, so i am dealing with multiple multi-dimensional arrays. I cant figure a way to push them into 1 array then compare, or using something like unique_array. </p>

<p>Any suggestions or help would be appreciated. I have been stuck for awhile.</p>

C:/MyUploaded is where my virtual directory exists.  Since that is the case, it puts that instead of /content/images/uploaded (the virtual directory path)

I am developing an OData service, and I want an entity that can have several user-designated name-value pairs associated, which can then be searched against.  I am using EF4.3, DataServiceVersion 3.0.  I am using a custom Metadata, Query, and Update provider.</p>

<p>So let's say that I have an entity Person:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person : EntityBase
{
    public virtual IList&lt;Property&gt; PropertySet { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(EntityBase is a common POCO that all my entities come from; it has only a Guid ID property.)  Now let's define our Property:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Property : EntityBase
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Person Person { get; set; }
    public Guid PersonId { get; set; }
}

public class IntProperty : Property
{
    public int? IValue { get; set; }
}

public class StringProperty : Property
{
    public string SValue { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good.  In my configuration, I am using Table Per Hierarchy for inheritance.</p>

<p>Now, I am able to add a Property to my Person, and when I make a request like this:</p>

<pre><code>GET /Service/People(guid'THE_ID')?$expand=PropertySet
</code></pre>

<p>It works:</p>

<pre><code>{""d"": {
  ""__metadata"": {...},
  ""PropertySet"": {
    ""results"": [{
      ""__metadata"": {...},
      ""Id"": ""PROP_1_ID"",
      ""Name"": ""Number"",
      ""IValue"": 1234
    },{
      ""__metadata"": {...},
      ""Id"": ""PROP_2_ID"",
      ""Name"": ""EmailAddress"",
      ""SValue"": ""AAAA""
    }]
  },
  ""Id"": ""THE_ID"",
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I query for a Person that has a property named 'EmailAddress', that works:</p>

<pre><code>GET /Service/People?$expand=PropertySet&amp;$filter=PropertySet/any(x: x/Name eq 'EmailAddress')
</code></pre>

<p>But even for that, I had to pull a few tricks.  I implemented an expression visitor, and whacked out a few comparisons that Linq To Entities didn't seem to like:</p>

<pre><code>protected override Expression VisitBinary(BinaryExpression node)
{
  if (node.NodeType == ExpressionType.Equal)
  {
    Expression left = Visit(node.Left);
    Expression right = Visit(node.Right);

    ConstantExpression rightConstant = right as ConstantExpression;
    if (null != rightConstant &amp;&amp; rightConstant.Value == null)
    {
      if (left.Type == typeof(IList&lt;Property&gt;))
      {
        return Expression.Constant(false, typeof(bool));
      }
    }
  }
  return base.VisitBinary(node);
}

protected override Expression VisitConditional(ConditionalExpression node)
{
  Expression visitedTest = Visit(node.Test);
  Expression visitedIfTrue = Visit(node.IfTrue);
  Expression visitedIfFalse = Visit(node.IfFalse);
  ConstantExpression constantTest = visitedTest as ConstantExpression;
  if (null != constantTest &amp;&amp; constantTest.Value is bool)
  {
    return ((bool)constantTest.Value) ? visitedIfTrue : visitedIfFalse;
  }
  return Expression.Condition(visitedTest, visitedIfTrue, visitedIfFalse);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The gist is with the first override my query gets expressions such as ""it.PropertySet == null"", which I know will always be untrue.  (In my spike, the only thing that has PropertySet is a Person, and a Person always has a PropertySet.)  In the second override, I'm looking at expressions such as ""IIF((it.PropertySet == null), Empty(), it.PropertySet)"", and I know that ""it"" will always have a PropertySet.  This prevents errors comparing an IList against null.</p>

<p>Now, the problem.</p>

<p>Merely searching for the presence of a Property isn't enough.  I would like to check it's value:</p>

<pre><code>GET /Service/People?$expand=PropertySet&amp;$filter=PropertySet/any(x: x/Name eq 'EmailAddress' and cast(x, 'InheritedPropertyTest.Entities.StringProperty')/SValue eq 'AAAA')
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the resulting query:</p>

<pre><code>value(System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery`1[InheritedPropertyTest.Entities.Person])
.MergeAs(AppendOnly)
.Where(it =&gt; it.PropertySet.Any(x =&gt; ((x.Name == ""EmailAddress"") AndAlso (IIF((Convert(x) == null), null, Convert(x).SValue) == ""AAAA""))))
.OrderBy(p =&gt; p.Id)
.Take(100)
.Select(p =&gt; new ExpandedWrapper`2() {ExpandedElement = p, Description = ""PropertySet"", ReferenceDescription = """", ProjectedProperty0 = p.PropertySet.OrderBy(p =&gt; p.Id)    .Take(100)})
</code></pre>

<p>But I get this error: ""Unable to cast the type 'InheritedPropertyTest.Entities.Property' to type 'InheritedPropertyTest.Entities.StringProperty'. LINQ to Entities only supports casting Entity Data Model primitive types.""  So... now I'm stuck beating my head against the wall again.  Perhaps my inheritance isn't set up correctly?  Do I need to overload some other Expression Visitor method to make the Convert work?  How do I convince Linq To Entities to work with inherited properties?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

.done(function() {

<p>To abort the call just do: <code>call.abort();</code> But that doesn't seem to work. (While it should, right?!).</p>

<p>When I trigger the <code>abort()</code> function, it gives back an object, but my request is still pending in the network tab of dev tools. Once the server is done processing my request it gives it back regardless of the <code>abort()</code> function.</p>

<p>According to my research, it can't be stopped that way, because the request is already sent and received by the server and therefore can't be aborted. But shouldn't there be a way to stop waiting on the server and disregard the info it would give back or just cut the connection of the AJAX call in question? </p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>So I just got a reply back from google.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for contacting Google Play Developer Support. We investigated
  the behavior that you've reported and have found that your app is not
  compatible with the NSZGS7 due to a conflict with the following: none
  of the specified native platforms (armeabi, armeabi-v7a, mips, x86)
  are supported by the device. Unfortunately we aren't able to provide a
  more detailed analysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are the native platforms connected to the libraries that I have included in my app, or is there some kind of preference I have forgotten to turn off? I am using eclipse with ADT.</p>

<p>When I go to second View and add new Item for selected list by adding Item object to Core data and I return to List View it still shows old number of objects. And the items property of list which should show me all Items objects for this list is an NSarray object with items count not including new added objects. But second View shows me all items with those new added too.</p>

<p>In few words it looks like by using NSFetchResultsController I have all object frozen from the first fetch and not responding to changes despite using ""performFetch:"" function. While using simple NSFetchRequest in second View everything works fine.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me why NSFetchResultsController objects stay frozen and do not change while core data records change?</p>

As part of my project definition I reference a utility library to which I have attached the source code.  So far, so good - I can see that source when I bring up classes from the library and while I am debugging.</p>

<p>Now however I would like to make a change to one of the classes while still retaining all the features of the Eclipse Java editor (specifically things like tool tips and quick fix).  These features seem to work when I'm viewing the source (I can CTRL+LClick through method names for instance), but it is read-only.  On the other hand I can explicitly open the source file which will allow me to edit it, but I lose all of the ""smart"" editing features.</p>

<p>I've recently switched to Eclipse from IntelliJ where this was possible so I'm hoping it is in Eclipse as well.  Note that although I could simply include the code as a project in my workspace, I'd really rather not.  The workspace is already quite large and I don't want to further slow Eclipse down by adding projects I rarely would ever touch.</p>

"21754560","1","","","2014-02-13 12:41:36","","1","138","<p>I’d like to define elegant interfaces for a binary relation and for a transitive relation. I consider a binary relation as a set of pairs, a subset of some set X × Y. In fact I intend to work mainly with transitive relations, but I occasionally need general binary relations. This is mainly for my own usage but I may end-up publishing this as a FLOSS library for other users. I would like my definitions to make sense on a general level as I do not have yet precise requirements about usage of these classes: I need them for experimental work related to scientific research, I have some ideas right now but it is unclear yet what kind of experiments I will need as more ideas come while doing the research.</p>

<h2>General idea</h2>

<p>The core of what I (think I) need is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @param &lt;F&gt;
 *            the type used for the “from” elements.
 * @param &lt;T&gt;
 *            the type used for the “to” elements.
 * 
 */
public interface BinaryRelationTentative&lt;F, T&gt; {
    /**
     * @return a view of the domain of this relation: all the elements x such that for some y, (x, y) is in the
     *         relation.
     */
    public Set&lt;F&gt; getFromSet();

    /**
     * @return a view of the range of this relation: all the elements y such that for some x, (x, y) is in the relation.
     */
    public Set&lt;T&gt; getToSet();

    /**
     * @return the number of pairs that this relation contains.
     */
    public int size();

    /**
     * @return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; iff the relation has empty from and to sets.
     */
    public boolean isEmpty();

    /**
     * A binary relation equals an other one iff they have equal from and to sets and for each (x, y) contained in one,
     * (x, y) is contained in the other one.
     */
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj);

    /**
     * @return whether the given &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt; element is in relation with the &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; element.
     */
    public boolean contains(F from, T to);

    /**
     * Optional operation.
     */
    public boolean add(F from, T to);
}
</code></pre>

<p>(This is only the core features, so that you see what I mean — nicer features for traversal and so on would be welcome, see below.) Then I would define a <code>TransitiveRelation&lt;E&gt;</code> that extends <code>BinaryRelation&lt;E, E&gt;</code>, that does not implement <code>add</code> but rather provides <code>addTransitive(F from, T to)</code>.</p>

<h2>Re-using classical collections</h2>

<p>Now of course, I want to re-use classical collection interfaces as much as possible. It seems Guava’s <code>SetMultimap</code> (<a href=""http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/SetMultimap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">javadoc</a>, <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/NewCollectionTypesExplained#Multimap"" rel=""nofollow"">user guide</a>) has the core features I need and more. The user guide even mentions the use case of an unlabeled directed graph. One problem I see with using directly <code>SetMultimap</code> is that the terminology is not exactly right: speaking of “keys” and “values” in case of a binary relation is strange. Moreover, it misses something. There is an asymetry that makes sense in a SetMultimap (designed to go from key to values), that makes less sense in a binary relation. The SetMultimap has an interface (and implementations) that allows one to, given a “from” element, iterate efficiently (i.e. without traversing the whole relation) through the ”to” elements in relation to it. Similarly, I would like to be able to, having a “to” element, iterate over the corresponding “from” elements efficiently. So I need something that could be called a BiSetMultimap (corresponding to both a <code>Map&lt;K, Set&lt;V&gt;&gt;</code> and a <code>Map&lt;V, Set&lt;K&gt;&gt;</code>). I have not been able to find such thing in the Java world.</p>

<p>I am currently, thus, thinking about defining <code>BinaryRelation&lt;F, T&gt;</code> as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">facade</a> to <code>SetMultimap&lt;F, T&gt;</code>. I can then create better-named methods in the interface (conceptually equivalent to the methods in <code>SetMultimap</code>), and I can add a method <code>getInverselyRelated(T to): Set&lt;F&gt;</code> that gives the “from” elements. I could provide implementations based on two <code>SetMultimap</code>s kept in sync, one representing the relation and one representing its inverse.</p>

<p>There’s numerous alternative approaches to this problem. I could for example define <code>BinaryRelation</code> as extending <code>SetMultimap</code>. Or I could avoid hiding completely <code>SetMultimap</code> and provide access to it through <code>BinaryRelation#asSetMultimap()</code>. That way I get all their nice method interfaces. Or I could give up entirely the idea of a specific interface and use a <code>SetMultimap</code> instead of a <code>BinaryRelation</code>, considering then the reverse-traversal operation as an optimisation feature available in specific classes but not on the interface level. Or I could perhaps use something else than SetMultimap as a basis for the design.</p>

<p>Therefore, my question (finally!): what do you think about my approach? Can you think about other approaches? Some problems I overlooked? An existing solution I could use?</p>

<h2>Possible links</h2>

<p>I thought about using some Graph library (<a href=""http://jung.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">JUNG</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht/"" rel=""nofollow"">JGraphT</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">Blueprint</a>), but I do not think they fit my needs. All these have an <code>Edge</code> class (or an Edge type parameter) which adds complexity and none provide interfaces and implementations as nice as <code>SetMultimap</code>, in my humble opinion. <a href=""http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~hogie/grph/"" rel=""nofollow"">Grph</a> does not provide objects for vertices, as the <a href=""http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~hogie/grph/?page=Documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">user manual</a> says. I may have missed something though so tell me if you disagree.</p>

<p>(Edit.) As mentioned by Xaerxess, this guava <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=394"" rel=""nofollow"">issue</a> suggests to add what I call here a BiSetMultimap to Guava.</p>

<p>It seems to me that only ""#!"" is a pretty URL and that Durandal does not support this. It supports pushState, though. According to the last link, this should <strong>not</strong> be included if the page already are using pretty URLs:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name=""fragment"" content=""!""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>One effect being that the indexed version of the page ""www.domain.com?_escaped_fragment_=#"" will be ""www.domain.com#"", and we want the URL without the hashbang to be indexed of course.</p>

<p>So to wrap it up - I will use # fragments, and not #!, should I include the meta fragment or not - and our internal links will also have # fragments, and not #!, will they be followed by Google?</p>

<p>Thanks for input!</p>

According to the first link you could actually change the fragment to ""#!"" instead of just ""#"", but I cannot get it to work. I tried overloading the convertRouteToHash() function, it goes in, and I don't see a change no matter what the function returns.</p>

<p>I'm doing a tiny downloader for personal use that accepts a maximum of 5 simultaneous downloads. Each download is handled by a different <em>thread</em> (not the common threads, just swingworker, which I also use to avoid UI freezing.).</p>

<pre><code>   public static String PATH;                   //File path
   public static String NAME;                   //File name

   //Download Method
   public void download() { 
      //download code...
   }
</code></pre>

<p>This method works fine (it downloads a file and then saves it into the hard drive as expected). But the issue comes when I want to do two (or more) downloads <strong>simultaneously</strong>. Consider I am downloading two files at the same time, <strong>file A</strong> and <strong>file B</strong>. When I start the download of <strong>A</strong>, strings <code>PATH</code> and <code>NAME</code> obtain its values according to file <em>A</em>, all OK. Then, I start downloading <strong>B</strong> and the previous stored values from <strong>A</strong> are replaced with the values that correspond to <strong>B</strong>. So when the download of <strong>A</strong> is complete, the file name is the same that <strong>B</strong> should have when download B is completed.
Resuming, I need different ìnstances of the same variable, that will contain different and indepentant values.</p>

<p>I started to research about the topic and led to <code>ThreadLocal</code> variables. This type of variable is supposed to change in each running thread, just what I need.
I tried to implement this to my code.</p>

<pre><code>   public static String PATH;                   //File path
   public static String NAME;                   //File name

   public ThreadLocal&lt;String&gt; TL_PATH =  new ThreadLocal&lt;String&gt;();
   public ThreadLocal&lt;String&gt; TL_NAME =  new ThreadLocal&lt;String&gt;();

   public void download() { 
   //Try to set ThreadLocal to PATH and NAME variables.
       TL_NAME.set(NAME);
       TL_PATH.set(PATH);

   //download code... 

   }
</code></pre>

<p>Once I did this, everything was the same. What's wrong in my code? (No exceptions are thrown in any case, just what I explained before)</p>

To show this in a graph, my idea is to fix the position of each production-company-node to an individual location in a circle, and then use the spring_layout algorithm to position the remaining movie-critic-nodes, such that one can easily see how some critics are drawn more towards certain production companies.</p>

<p>My problem is that I can't seem to fix the initial position of the production-company-nodes. Surely, I can fix their position but then it is just random, and I don't want that - I want them in a circle. I can calculate the position of all nodes and afterwards set the position of the production-company-nodes, but this beats the purpose of using a spring_layout algorithm and I end up with something wacky like:</p>

<li>Step 4: PHP searchs for an image of that link (crawls the web, takes a few seconds) and saves the image with the name of the last ID from database insert. If last ID was 75 image will be saved as 'img_75'.</li>
<li>Step 5: PHP loads 'You have succesfully posted a link'</li>
</ul>

<p>What I want is <strong>step 5 to happen just after step 3</strong>, while step 4 is running. I don't actually need the response from step 4. As long as it runs on the background I am happy :)</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> I have done what @shadyyx suggests. A simple AJAX call. I really hoped for an alternative but apparently not php nor any other server side language can handle asynchronous calls.</p>

<pre><code>var barData = {

<p>I use an <code>if</code> statement to change the <code>colormap</code> of the water with increasing depth, determined by two thresholds (in the code below the thresholds are represented by the array <code>C</code>)</p>

<pre><code>if max(C(:)) &lt; 2
    colormap([0.5 0.25 0 ; 0 0.8 1]);
elseif max(C(:)) &gt;= 2 &amp;&amp; max(C(:)) &lt; 3
    colormap([0.5 0.25 0 ; 0 0.8 1 ; 0 0.5 0.65]);
elseif max(C(:)) &gt;= 3
    colormap([0.5 0.25 0 ; 0 0.8 1 ; 0 0.5 0.65 ; 0 0.2 0.3]);
end
</code></pre>

<p>The result is that when the water level is below threshold 1 it is a light blue, between the two thresholds it turns darker, and above threshold 2 it turns darker yet.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I draw the legend</p>

<pre><code>legend('ground','water');
</code></pre>

<p>... I only get one color representing the water, and it changes according to the max depth. How do I make a static legend showing all four categories with a color example:</p>

<ol>
<li>(brown)           Ground</li>
<li>(light blue)      Water level beneath threshold 1</li>
<li>(standard blue)   Water level between thresholds</li>
<li>(dark blue)       Water level above threshold 2</li>
</ol>

<p>The only solution I can think of is making 3 neat little patches somewhere by the axis (where it won't be noticed) in the right blue colors and then making the legend point at them and not the water surface. But that would be a real crappy solution...</p>

This is now a dead question. While debugging further I realized the server (which I need to test this part of my code on, due to file permissions and such) was not getting my updates from VS2010, even though I published them to it. Frustrating. Anyway, all this works fine. Perhaps it could be used by someone else trying to figure out how to do a similar thing? Thanks everyone for your help.</strong></p>

<p>This one's been driving me crazy for a couple days.</p>

<p>What I have is a simple list of image thumbnails, which when clicked on should display the full-size image in another div via some jquery. </p>

<p>I get the thumbnail image data and full-size image's filepath from the database. The corresponding full-size image is stored on the same server as the IIS instance. </p>

<p>We do not want to display the filepath in the rendered HTML, so what we do is encrypt the filepath and send that as a parameter to a generic handler, which decrypts it, loads the file from the server, and outputs it as a byte array stream. </p>

<p>The handler works as intended, however the problem arises when trying to do the jquery html part. Instead of displaying the image in the div, it opens a new browser tab and shows the image from the handler just as would happen if javascript was disabled. What I need is the image to show in the #photosLarge div, which would happen if we used an image URL or something.</p>

<p>Here's my relevant code:</p>

<p>View:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""thumbnails""&gt;
    @For Each photo In Model.Photos
        Dim p As MyProject.Models.FolderImage = photo
        Dim FullSizeLink As String = ""/Handlers/GetImage.ashx?file="" &amp; p.DocPath
        @:&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""@FullSizeLink"" class=""thumbnail""&gt;&lt;img src=""@p.Thumbnail.ToString"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    Next
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=""photoLarge""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>js:</p>

<pre><code>$("".thumbnail"").click(function () {
    var image = $(this).attr(""href"");
    $('#photoLarge').hide();
    $('#photoLarge').fadeIn('slow');
    $('#photoLarge').html('&lt;img src=""' + image + '""/&gt;');
    return false;
});

<p>Can anybody help me to get resolved my problem. Thanks in advance.</p>

I am supposed to count the number of letters in the stdin and say how many times each one was used.
It is also expected that we use a counter and the fread method.</p>

<p>EDIT: Igor helped me with his answer and the programm does now almost everything right. Small mistakes still remain: Only the first 10 chars are recognized and counted the others are ignored. And the input must be bigger than 10 or else it doesn't work.</p>

<p>I commented the changes I made in the code so others can follow my mistakes.</p>

<p>The code I have is:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int main(){
  char text[10];
  int timesUsed[26]; // I initialized the array but didn't set the values to 0.
  int timesUsed[26] = {0}; //this line corrected the issue with getting random numbers
  int textLength = 0;
  char *ptr;
  while(fread(&amp;text,sizeof(char),10,stdin)){
    ptr = &amp;text[0];    
    while(1){
      if(isalpha(*ptr)){
    textLength++;
    *ptr = tolower(*ptr); //the original was only tolower(*ptr); which is useless
    timesUsed[((char) *ptr) - 'a']++;
      }
      if(*ptr == '\n') goto end; //the original had here only one '='
      /**ptr = '\0';*/
      if(ptr == &amp;text[10]) goto end; // on both
      ptr ++;
    }
  }
 end:
  printf(""Number of letters:%20d\n"",textLength);
  int i;
  for(i=0;i&lt;26;i++){
    if(timesUsed[i]&gt;0){
      char thechar = (char) 'a' + i;
      printf(""The letter %c was used %5d time(s).\n"",thechar,timesUsed[i]);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which doesn't print the expected result, what it actually prints is:</p>

<pre><code>Testing testing testing testing testing testing M
Number of letters:                   9
The letter e was used     2 time(s).
The letter g was used     1 time(s).
The letter i was used     1 time(s).
The letter n was used     1 time(s).
The letter s was used     1 time(s).
The letter t was used     3 time(s).

<p>The changes made the output a lot more meaningful. Still some mistakes though.</p>

I have a video playing on a website using the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag. Client asked to add only a ""mute"" button in the shape of an icon that changes when clicked.</p>

<p>So i've tried this:
this is the icon i place over the video</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""mute0.png"" id=""mutebutton"" onclick=""javascript:muteUnmute()"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and this is the javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var mutebutton = document.getElementById('mutebutton');

function muteUnmute() {
    video.muted = !video.muted;
}
video.onvolumechange = function(e) {
    mutebutton.src = video.muted ? ""mute1.png"" : ""mute0.png"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine on Firefox and Opera, but the img src does not change in Chrome or in Safari!</p>

<p>I also tried this:</p>

<pre><code>video.onvolumechange = function(e) {
    if (video.muted) {
        mutebutton.src = ""mute1.png""
    } else {
        mutebutton.src = ""mute0.png""
    }
}

<p>but still no result.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a clue why Chrome and Safari do not allow me to change the img src in this way? Can you suggest a way to solve this matter?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Solved!</strong> this might be useful to someone:</p>

<p>the problem was on the <code>video.onvolumechange</code> event, it seems that Chrome and Safari do not understand that</p>

<p>so I've done this and it now works:</p>

I want to plot a graph of 128 nodes (labeled 1 to 128) in graphviz using circular layout. Circo does this, but I want the nodes to be placed in order of their label number instead of the order created by circo (based on the edges between them). Also, there may be nodes with no incoming or outgoing edges, but still have to be placed in the circular order. </p>

<p>I have tried fiddling with edge weight but it didn't affect anything. I could get the no-edge nodes to appear in the circo circle using invisible edges between adjacent nodes (e.g. 1->2, 2->3, ..., 128->1). But the order is still left wanting.</p>

<p>Is there any way to achieve this? I would really appreciate any help in this regard. Here is my code:</p>

The page would load, and then the user could click a certain section that he wants to change. So basically what I need is, a way to display a web page inside my app (could possibly be done with frames but I'd prefer not to have a horizontal scroll bar), and then another way to let users select a block of text or a page element.</p>

<p>I.e if a block of text is in a <code>div</code>, hovering above the text would outline that div using a faint green color (hovering away would remove this border/outline), and clicking the text would draw a solid green border around it to show that its been selected, and then some content on my page will show the id of the div, and let the user specify some other info that i need.</p>

<p>So I probably need a way to get all the <code>&lt;div&gt;s</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;s</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;s</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;s</code> and any other 'container' tags, and then have the ability to cause hovering/clicking of them to change their <code>style.border</code> property, and the ability to retrieve their id/name, </p>

<p>For a block of text the border could probably work, but what about images and such? Also, what if a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> doesn't have an ID/Name, how could it be specified?</p>

My camera activity is locked to portrait mode and due to other features on it - it must be portrait mode. After I take photo with my Camera and displays it it appears rotated. I found solution to handle this problem but it takes too much memory of weaker devices so after clicking ""take photo"" button I have to wait around 8 sec till it goes to next activity (PREVIEW ACTIVITY) while on my own Nexus 4 it works without lags and starts instantly.

<p>getOutputMediaFile is a method that generates directory in my device where photo should be saved. (I'm not adding photo to gallery yet). When you analyse the code I've posted above you can see that im using FileOutputStream twice. First time I just save photo in phone memory, second time I open it again, write it on rotated matrix and flush it. I think using FileOutputStream, saving -> opening -> saving -> closing -> opening -> saving - closing is slowing weaker devices. I would like to modify this metod somehow to make it more efficient. Please help me with that.</p>

<p>What I have tried till now is trying to delete first FileOutputStream and make everything at once like that:</p>

<pre><code>private Camera.PictureCallback mPicture = new Camera.PictureCallback() {

    @Override
    public void onPictureTaken(byte[] data, Camera camera) {

        File pictureFile = getOutputMediaFile();

        if (pictureFile == null){
            return;         
        }
        try {
            FileOutputStream outStream = new FileOutputStream(pictureFile);
            outStream.write(data);

            Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(pictureFile.getAbsolutePath());

            Matrix matrix = new Matrix();
            if (currentCamera == BACK_CAMERA) {
                matrix.postRotate(90);
            } else {
                matrix.postRotate(270);

<p>I am reading a CSV in java, in which one of the column has string as follows:</p>

<p>a. ""123345""</p>

<p>b. ""12345 - 67890""</p>

<p>I want to split this like(Split it into two separate columns):</p>

<p>a. ""123345"", """" </p>

<p>b. ""12345"",""67890""</p>

<p>Now, when I am using Java's default split function, it splits the string as follows:</p>

<p>a. ""123345,""</p>

<p>b. ""12345,67890"" (Which is basically a string)</p>

<p>Any idea how can I achieve this? I have wasted my 3 hours on this. Hope any one can help.</p>

<p>Code as follows:</p>

<pre><code>while ((line = bufferReader.readLine()) != null)
{
      main = line.split(""\\,""); //splitting the CSV using "",""

    //I know that column # 13 is the column where I can find digits like ""123-123"" etc..
 therefore I have hard coded it.


if (main[12].contains(""-""))
    {
    temp = main[12].split(""-"");
    //At this point, when I print temp, it still shows me a string.
    //What I have to do is to write them to the csv file. 
    E.g: [""86409, 3567""] &lt;--Problem here!
    }
    else
    {
    //do nothing
    }
}
 after this, i will write the main[] array to the file.

<p>The object returned has been modified??</p>

<p>If the GetUsersByGroup method is called with a userGroupID  i.e the first case, then output is all as expected.</p>

<p>If i remove the conditional from the method and simply return <code>$col = UserGroup::GetCollection(""User"" ,_DB_GET_ALL_INSTANCE_NOGROUP_MEMBERS,$instanceID);</code> then all output is as expected.</p>

<p>It seems that the else condition executes correctly, and then is corrupted on return, but this only happens if the else condition is present, remove the else condition, and simply return the result of the method call in the else condition, and all is as expected.</p>

<p>Any idea please?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>ADDED THE UserGroup::GetCollection Method (this is a deep rabbit hole though, could go on) </p>

<pre><code>protected static function GetCollection($class, $sqlID, $params = null)
{
    $dal = DAL::GetInstance(); //not to be confused with the Instance object, this is an instance of DAL        

    $collection = new Collection($class);
    $items = $dal-&gt;QueryForAssoc($sqlID,$params);

    foreach($items as $item)
    {
          $itemObject = new $class();
          $itemObject-&gt;LoadFromList($item);
          $collection-&gt;add($itemObject);
    }

    return $collection;        
}
</code></pre>

<p>To further clarify the follwing works fine ::</p>

<pre><code>public static function GetUsersByGroup($instanceID, $groupID)
{               
    $col = null;
    //if($groupID != null)

Watchr has been great but the only problem is I can't get colored output. I'm using this as my <a href=""https://gist.github.com/483101"" rel=""nofollow"">watchr file</a></p>

<p>If I run my tests manually via ""rspec spec/"" then I get colored output. However, letting watchr run the tests (via modifying one of my files) the output is no longer in color.</p>

<p>One thing I notice is that this part seems to prevent colored output somehow</p>

<pre><code>def run(cmd)
  puts(cmd)
  `#{cmd}`
end

<p>Normally, watchr runs the tests using this (in my watchr file)</p>

<pre><code>result = run ""rake spec""

<p>But if I instead do the following I get colored output.</p>

<pre><code>result = system ""rake spec""

<p>Only problem is that the above line no longer captures the output to ""result"", which in turn mans growl notifications no longer work.</p>

  Type  n time

<p>The java server nodes where getting restarted with Out Of Memory error. Looking at the hprof files, i found that they where only 1.2G(avg of 3 server nodes) in size , when 3GB(both -Xms and Xmx) of heap is configured for the server nodes. This observation lead to the following doubt.</p>

<p>I have read that when Xms and Xmx are set to the same value, the jvm is allocated the entire heap when it starts. If its the case the server nodes would have 3GB of heap from the start. If so why does it doesn't reflect in the hprof file or if the hprof contains only the memory allocated to objects during runtime, the the size clearly idicates that the heap memory was free(more than 50%), so how OOM error...!!..??</p>

<p>I also know that linux does something called as memory over-commit. ie memory is not actually given when its requested but when its actually used. Is this contributing to the out of memory exception. Like when the JVM starts the os says to it that you have been allocated 3GB of memory but actually defers it until its actually required. By the time the jvm actually tries to allocate the memory to objects  , some other applications might have exhausted the memory. Is this possible...??</p>

<p>Even if the java nodes had memory leak issue, wouldn't it be confined to the 3GB of heap. How can it hog up the entire 64G of physical memory....???</p>

<p>One more thing i observed was the swap space was only 50% used.</p>

<p>Any light on this...!</p>

<p>Simply put, the ComboBox cmbTarget's ItemsSource is set depending on the value of ComboBox cmbTargetType. This code worked perfectly while the result of AllProductParts and AllMaterials was a collection of strings, in this case, the names of the objects in the collection. However, I realized that I don't want the result of these to be a string. I want to use the objects themselves so I can pass those to my attached ViewModel object. However, this naturally results in the ComboBox simply displaying a list of class names. </p>

<p>Is there way to get this ComboBox to display a ProductPart/Material's InternalName variable, while having it communicate with it's ViewModel in the form of the actual ProductPart/Material objects?</p>

<p>I tried using a Converter class. But it seems these are completely disconnected from the rest of the program, meaning I can't access other parts of my code to try and find the correct object belonging to an InternalName.</p>

<p>In this example, the iframe should only show a green area and it should be impossible to reveal the red area. This is mostly true: there is no scrollbar, the mouse wheel doesn't do anything and neither do the arrow keys. </p>

<p>However click and drag still scrolls the view. This is particularly noticeable when selecting text.</p>

<p>Does anyone know any trick to stop Safari from doing this?</p>

<p>Everything is working except for one line. I need to write the following line into another batch file which will be created by my program:</p>

<pre><code>echo find /v ""%url%"" &lt; C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts &gt; C:\Users\%username%\desktop\temp.txt &gt;&gt; unblock.bat
</code></pre>

<p>This line is part of the code which will be able to remove the website from the hosts file if the user wishes to.
The problem appears to be the ""&lt;"" and "">"" signs. The program will not allow me to write these to the new batch file. I have tried to save them as variables and realized that the only way i could do it was by declaring them with inverted commas like this:</p>

<pre><code>set char1=""&lt;""
set char2=""&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>and then my command looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>echo find /v ""%url%"" %char1% C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts %char2% C:\Users\%username%\desktop\temp.txt &gt;&gt; unblock.bat
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that when writing to the new batch file, they both still have """" around them which makes the new batch file useless as the command does not execute properly.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>

<p>Here's the whole code for the batch file (incomplete):</p>

<pre><code>@echo off
TITLE Site Blocker
SET /P url=Enter website (e.g. www.facebook.com)- 
echo. &gt;&gt; C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

kind of problem if and only if I derive from it and the derived class has a virtual destructor.</p>

<li>Why is this a problem?</li>

Anyway, I've got a few of the sample apps (petstore/etc) running, got spring security basics figured out, and am ready to start a new project.  My question is, are there any best practices for ""breaking apart"" the site into different webapps.</p>

<p>For example, the project will have the standard web stuff (/contactus, /about, etc), a user area (/myprofile, etc), and an admin section (/admin/users, etc).  Is it generally the practice to roll all of this into one webapp, or I was thinking about possibly removing all of the admin functionality to a separate webapp. Other than being able to keep the admin site running while the other stuff is down for maintenance, is there any reason for breaking apart the project?  Any best practices to be observed here?</p>

<p>The question is to produce three arrays: int, String and Calendar type. Then pick out the biggest out of each category (and display the answers). </p>

<p>This class extends the <code>GregorianCalendar</code> class which means I have access to the Calendars <code>toString()</code> which I'm trying to override. However it doesn't work. Its like the <code>toString()</code> method isn't overriding because I'm getting the default <code>toString()</code> output. However, I'm using Netbeans and it acknowledges the override and even takes me to to <code>Calendar.toString()</code> when I click the override link. So I'm stuck, any help would be appreciated.</p>

Bonita portal lets me edit the html form. But it needs to be in the  format. It automatically generates the button type elements when it loads the page. So I don't have access to button type class.If I did it would be simpler to add the onclick check there.</p>

<p>My problem is propogation of onclick to submit button type. So I can give onclick check only on the top most div type but it doesn't apply to submit button type which is auto generated.

<p>Edit: I've been using python for about a year and I feel like this is a pretty common thing to do but I'm not even sure that I'm looking up/searching for the right terms. What topics would you search for to answer this? If anyone can post a link or two to what I need to read up on regarding this, that would be very appreciated.</p>

So let me see if I understand correctly: anything that I put in exports will be included in files which require the file.</p>

<p>I have inherited some node files, one main file with heaps of <code>require</code>s, and each required file with the structure:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {};
obj.prop1 = ""some value1"";
obj.prop2 = ""some value2"";    
module.exports = exports = obj;
</code></pre>

<p>Is this a standard way of exporting data in a required file? Is it sensible to a)declare this (seemingly redundant <code>obj</code>)? ,b)if no functionality is being assigned to either <code>exports</code> or <code>module.exports</code>, why do they both need to be pointed at <code>obj</code>? c)what is the purpose of this middle-level <code>exports</code> if it can be overridden? What is the use case for both of these objects?</p>

<p>Presumably, the optional variable is not initialized properly. How to do it the correct way?</p>

<p>EDIT:: Got some very good answers, just couple of more questions 1. Is it a good idea to use <code>make_optional</code> at the end of <code>'func'</code> function and return it? Also 2. I was thinking of assigning <code>boost::none</code> to emphasize that I have no value to assign and that's why <code>boost::none</code>. But not sure if that is valid?   </p>

<p>Second later edit: It is terrible, I get the initial page load now, but forms are not submitting and after some going back and forward to the webview, new images do not load anymore. Is it a memory problem? How do I make it start fresh every time?</p>

"19409042","1","","","2013-10-16 16:42:32","","1","3293","<p>I have a following CQL table (a bit simplified for clarity):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE test_table (
    user        uuid,
    app_id      ascii,
    domain_id   ascii,
    props       map&lt;ascii,blob&gt;,
    PRIMARY KEY ((user), app_id, domain_id)
)
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that this table would contain many users (i.e. rows, say, dozens of millions). For each user there would be a few domains of interest and there would be a few apps per domain. And for each user/domain/app there would be a small set of properties.</p>

<p>I need to scan this entire table and load its contents in chunks for given app_id and domain_id. My idea was to use the TOKEN function to be able to read the whole data set in several iterations. So, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT props FROM test_table WHERE app_id='myapp1'
  AND domain_id='mydomain1'
  AND TOKEN(user) &gt; -9223372036854775808
  AND TOKEN(user) &lt; 9223372036854775807;
</code></pre>

<p>I was assuming that this query would be efficient because I specify the range of the row keys and by specifying the values of the clustering keys I effectively specify the column range. But when I try to run this query I get the error message ""Bad Request: Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING"".</p>

<p>I have limited experience with Cassandra and I assumed that this sort of query would map into get_range_slices() call, which accepts the slice predicate (i.e. the range of columns defined by my app_id/domain_id values) and the key range defined by my token range. It seems either I misunderstand how this sort of query is handled or maybe I misunderstand about the efficiency of get_range_slices() call.</p>

<p>To be more specific, my questions are:
- if this data model does make sense for the kind of query I have in mind
- if this query is expected to be efficient
- if it is efficient, then why am I getting this error message asking me to ALLOW FILTERING</p>

<p>My only guess about the last one was that the rows that do not have the given combination of app_id/domain_id would need to be skipped from the result.</p>

<p>--- update ----</p>

<p>Thank for all the comments. I have been doing more research on this and there is still something that I do not fully understand.</p>

<p>In the given structure what I am trying to get is like a rectangular area from my data set (assuming that all rows have the same columns). Where top and the bottom of the rectangle is determined by the token range (range) and the left/right sides are defined as column range (slice). So, this should naturally transform into get_range_slices request. My understanding (correct me if I am wrong) that the reason why CQL requires me to put ALLOW FILTERING clause is because there will be rows that do not contain the columns I am looking for, so they will have to be skipped. And since nobody knows if it will have to skip every second row or first million rows before finding one that fits my criteria (in the given range) - this is what causes the unpredictable latency and possibly even timeout. Am I right? I have tried to write a test that does the same kind of query but using low-level Astyanax API (over the same table, I had to read the data generated with CQL, it turned out to be quite simple) and this test does work - except that it returns keys with no columns where the row does not contain the slice of columns I am asking for. Of course I had to implement some kind of simple paging based on the starting token and limit to fetch the data in small chunks.</p>

<p>Now I am wondering - again, considering that I would need to deal with dozens of millions of users: would it be better to partially ""rotate"" this table and organize it in something like this:</p>

<p>Row key: domain_id + app_id + partition no (something like hash(user) mod X)
Clustering key: column partition no (something like hash(user) >> 16 mod Y) + user</p>

<p>For the ""column partition no""...I am not sure if it is really needed. I assume that if I go with this model I will have relatively small number of rows (X=1000..10000) for each domain + app combination. This will allow me to query the individual partitions, even in parallel if I want to. But (assuming the user is random UUID) for 100M users it will result in dozens or hundreds of thousands of columns per row. Is it a good idea to read one such a row in one request? It should created some memory pressure for Cassandra, I am sure. So maybe reading them in groups (say, Y=10..100) would be better? </p>

<p>I realize that what I am trying to do is not what Cassandra does well - reading ""all"" or large subset of CF data in chunks that can be pre-calculated (like token range or partition keys) for parallel fetching from different hosts. But I am trying to find a pattern that is the most efficient for such a use case.</p>

<p>By the way, the query like ""select * from ... where TOKEN(user)>X and TOKEN(user)

<p>Date is OK because I can use between from_date and to_date but my problem is time. Look at table, Time isn't increasing like date, so I can't use between for time. For example my time start from 135911 and end with 020719 so it just lists rows that are between these two numbers but I need all blue rows like row 6 that is not in this range.</p>

<p>The problem is that, this event doesn´t fire at IE 11 (as well as mouse-drag-start, mouse-drag-end). But on the other browsers it works fine (IE9, Firefox, Chrome). The other problem is that other mouse events (click, mouse-move, etc) work fine on IE 11, so the problem is only with the mouse-drags.</p>

At the moment these are being run simultaneously which causes the list to remain with 0 items despite grabbing 20 new ones.</p>

<p>The REST call is currently sitting inside one of my services. From my searches I've found two possible solutions, <code>$timeout</code> and <code>$viewContentLoaded</code>, or possibly combining them into one solution. However, in my case I can't figure out how I would implement this for it to work properly.</p>

    $(this).addClass('selected');

At the moment my code can scan the folder and give me a list of the file names, and if it finds that there is more than one file it creates the folder they need to be moved into, but how would I actually go about doing the check on the file names and moving them if they are over 7 days old?</p>

<pre><code>// What do I do at the ...  ? 
matrix&lt;double&gt; analysis::gradient_ND(std::function&lt;double(...)&gt; fn, matrix&lt;double&gt;)

<p>So that I can pass a std::function with arbitrary input say N and I will pass 
a vector which has N values. </p>

<p>How will I go about doing this ? If the answer is too long , links will be appreciated too .
Thank you.   </p>

<p>PS: I saw a method using Templates , but if I use templates in the implementation , the I will have to change the .cpp file to something else right ? I would like to avoid. If using templates is the only way , then I will have to compromise. Thanks. </p>

<p>So I am busy with some javascript development inside drupal 7 pages. We basically have an MVC that hooks into a drupal page. Nothing fancy. Recently I started fixed legacy code that called jQuery.noConflict() to get an instance of jQuery because in drupal 7 jQuery is namespaced and the current dev did not know how to solve the dreaded '$ is not a function' issue without plastering every script with its own 'aliased' jquery instance like so: </p>

<pre><code>$xj = jQuery.noConflict();
</code></pre>

<p>This causes a hole world of sh!z for any other code assuming $ is still available globally.</p>

<p>Now I have cleaned up all the noConflict calls and also wrapped all 'onload code' in this fancy closure:</p>

<pre><code>(function ($) {
   // we can now use $ yo....
}(jQuery));
</code></pre>

<p>But now, sadly, I am being punished by the universe for using the javascript module reveal pattern. Let me try and explain by a code snippet: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/yz41wr2g/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/yz41wr2g/</a></p>

<p>Does anyone have experience using namespaced jQuery in the module reveal pattern like this?</p>

Because the list can become quite large, only checking the first N rows is obligatory.
To show this to the user, I add an extra <code>TableRow</code> with one <code>TableCell</code> (colspan=4) with some instructional text before the first optional row.
I add this row on the repeaters <code>ItemDataBound</code>.</p>

<p>On postback all checked radio-buttons before and after the extra row <em>do</em> return with their checked values, <em>except</em> the one item before which I inserted the extra row.
I tried varying the types for the extra row (<code>Html/RadioButton</code>, <code>Html/TableRow</code> and <code>Html/TableCell</code>), and I tried varying <code>EnableViewState</code> on the extra row.
However I can not get this row/radio-button to postback the checked-value, it is always false.</p>

<p>Does anybody know why this value does not postback?<br>
Does anybody know how to add an extra row without preventing the radio-button to postback?</p>

<p>Extra remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not want to add an <code>OnClick</code> to the radio-button, as I like to process and store all the values at once</li>
<li>I dowload the original data in the <code>Page_Load</code>, but that does not seem a problem for the other rows/RadioButtons</li>

<p>I have found some other (old) questions about this, but couldn't find a solution for me. How should I try to debug this? Running <code>rspec</code> works like a charm, but I'm eager to find out what's the problem here.</p>

<p>Here's my <code>spec_helper.rb</code>:
<a href=""https://github.com/jmuheim/transition/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jmuheim/transition/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb</a></p>

<p>And here's the original Rails project:
<a href=""https://github.com/jmuheim/transition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jmuheim/transition</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I found that the <code>spec</code> rake task seems to be defined twice (notice the <code>/</code> that separates the description of each task):</p>

<pre><code>$ rake -T | grep spec
...
rake spec                               # Run all specs in spec directory (excluding plugin specs) / Run RSpec code examples
...
</code></pre>

<p>One of them is described with <code>Run all specs in spec directory (excluding plugin specs)</code>, one with <code>Run RSpec code examples</code>.</p>

<p><code>Run RSpec code examples</code> seems to come from <a href=""https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/master/lib/rspec/core/rake_task.rb#L72"" rel=""nofollow""><code>rspec/core/rake_task.rb</code></a>. <code>Run all specs in spec directory (excluding plugin specs)</code> seems to come from <a href=""https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/blob/master/lib/rspec/rails/tasks/rspec.rake#L12"" rel=""nofollow""><code>rspec/rails/tasks/rspec.rake</code></a>.</p>

<p>It seems to me that only one of them should exist?!</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>It seems to be a problem with <code>rspec-rails</code> being in both the <code>test</code> and <code>development</code> groups. I added an issue about this here: <a href=""https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/904"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/904</a></p>

Here, <em>substring</em> means any part of the original string. For example ""abc"" is the substring of ""ffabcgg"", while ""abg"" is not. </p>

<p>I've found a way to compute the maximum length common substring of two strings <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>. It works by concatenating the two strings using a character not in them, '$' for example. Then for each prefix of the concatenated string <code>s</code> with length <code>i &gt;= |s1| + 2</code>, we calculate its LRS (longest repeated suffix) length <code>lrs[i]</code> and <code>sp[i]</code> (the end position of the first occurence of its LRS). Finally, the answer is</p>

<pre><code>max{lrs[i]| i &gt;= |s1| + 2 and sp[i] &lt;= |s1|}
</code></pre>

<p>I've written a C++ program that uses this method, which can solve the problem within 200ms on my laptop when <code>|s1|+|s2| &lt;= 200000</code>, using the factor oracle.</p>

<pre><code>s1 = 'ffabcgg'
s2 = 'gfbcge'
s = s1+'$'+s2 
  = 'ffabcgg$gfbcge'
p: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
s:  f f a b c g g $ g f  b  c  g  e
sp: 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 1  4  5  6  0
lrs:0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1  1  2  3  0

ans = lrs[13] = 3
</code></pre>

<p>I know the both problems can be solved using suffix-array and suffix-tree with high efficiency, but I wonder if there is a method using factor oracle to solve it. I am interested in this because the factor oracle is easy to construct (with 30 lines of C++, suffix-array needs about 60, and suffix-tree needs 150), and it runs faster than suffix-array and suffix-tree.</p>

<p>I have the following task to perform:</p>

<p>I have several classes (call these A) that constantly gather information from various sources (database, internet, etc). They can contain a potentially large amount of information on some topic..</p>

<p>I also have a bunch of classes (call these B) that allow me to render a variety of graphs, if supplied with enough information (here, information can be as simple as one or more floating values).</p>

<p>Now, I have to tie these two things together, so that I can modify which information is displayed in which form with minimal changes. Now, I'm considering using an observer pattern here, because it seems to lend itself nicely to this problem. However, I'm a bit stuck and would like advice. I can clearly make classes A of a ""data source"" base type, that allows subscribers and notifies subscribers when there are changes. I can also make classes B of the type ""observer"" and let them subscribe to data sources and be notified of changes. </p>

<p>The problem is that I don't want my observers to know any particular type of information they are displaying. For instance, if I want to graph temperature in my city on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis, and I have a 2D-plot class (of type B), then I want to avoid any kind of <code>A-&gt;GetTemperature ()</code> calls. Similarly, in class A, I don't want to call <code>NotifyOfTemperatureChange ()</code> or anything like that...</p>

<p>One idea is to define a bunch of enums or strings like <code>""temperature""</code>, <code>""time""</code>, <code>""humidity""</code>, etc and then tell the observer what it should listen to (something like <code>A-&gt;SetYAxis (B, ""temperature"")</code> -- here, I'm informing class A that it should get a single float value for its Y axis from data source B, channel ""temperature"")</p>

<p>so that A can just do <code>B-&gt;subscribeTo (whateverIPassedIn)</code>. That way, B doesn't need to know what information its plotting. A can then say <code>notifyOfChangesOnThisChannel (""temperature"")</code>. This, however, seems a bit hacky for me... For instance, would the data be actually passed to the notified function? Would I have to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>void B::subscriberChanged (int subscriberId, std::string channel)
{
    float value = datasource [subscriberId].GetCurrentValue (channel);
}
</code></pre>

<p>or would be it something like</p>

<pre><code>void B::subscriberChanged (int subscriberId, std::string channel, void *data)
{
   float value = *static_cast &lt;float *&gt; (data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and besides, how would B know the type of data? I mean in this example it's a float, but what if it's an int or a double?</p>

<p>I guess my question is: is this correct? Is there a nicer way to approach this problem?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance</p>

<a href=""https://github.com/egorkhmelev/jslider"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/egorkhmelev/jslider</a> (dated October 10, 2012) but have been unable to initialise a jslider instance programmatically.  I'm also using jQuery 1.9.1 and the full jQuery-ui 1.10.3 (both minified)</p>

<p>I have seen in Egor's documentation and on this site references to <code>$(elementID).slider(""value"", value, value)</code> but when I put that in the document.ready function in the subsequent statement to building the jslider, jQuery 1.9.1 reports </p>

<pre><code>Error: cannot call methods on slider prior to initialisation; attempted to call method 'value'
</code></pre>

<p>This error is not generated if I move the <code>.slider(""value""...)</code> line of code outside the document.ready function but then it doesn't do anything either.  I have tried <code>.</code><b>j</b><code>slider(""value""...)</code> inside and outside the doc.ready but although it does not generate an error it does not set the default value either.</p>

<p>I've also tried specifying a 'value' option in the jslider initialisation but this also has no effect.</p>

<p>Getting creative, I also tried</p>

<pre><code>$('input[id=timeSlider]').val(defaultValue);
$('#timeSlider').slider(""value"",defaultValue);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>$('#timeSlider').html($('#timeSlider').html().replace(/value=\d+/,'value='+defaultValue));
</code></pre>

<p>neither of which have any effect.  <code>.html()</code> within doc ready returns nothing.</p>

<p>I discovered that I had to include a <code>value=NN</code> parameter in the HTML otherwise I get an <code>uncaught exception: jquery.slider: INPUT element does not have a value.</code></p>

<p>I have tried and I have searched for an answer but I haven't been able to solve this.  I apologise if I'm missing the obvious.</p>

<p>The HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span style=""display: inline-block; width: 270px; padding: 1em 1em 1.5em 1em;""&gt;
&lt;input id=""timeSlider"" type=""slider"" name=""timeSlide"" value=15 /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Javascript (from doc ready function):</p>

<pre>
$('#timeSlider').jslider({
        from: 0,
        to: 600,
        heterogeneity: ['25/10', '50/20', '75/120'],
        step: 1,
        round: 1,
        limits:false,
        scale: ['&infin;', '|', 10, '|', '20', '|', 120, '|', 600],
        dimension: '&nbsp;s',
        skin: ""plastic"",
        onstatechange: function (value) {
            defaultValue = value;
        }

I put fancy box onto the page because I want the images to pop after clicking the thumbnails. Here is what my css looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-3 col-lg-3""&gt;
    &lt;a class=""thumbnail fancybox"" rel=""lightbox"" href=""#""&gt;
         &lt;img src=""images/gal1.jpg"" class=""img-responsive""&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in order to get this structure I had to add this bit of script:</p>

<pre><code>$('.col-sm-8 img').addClass('img-responsive');
$('.col-sm-8 img').wrap('&lt;a class=""thumbnail fancybox"" rel=""lightbox"" href=""#""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;');
$('a.thumbnail.fancybox').wrap('&lt;div class=""col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-3 col-lg-3""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
$('div.col-sm-4.col-xs-6.col-md-3.col-lg-3').wrapAll('&lt;div class=""list-group gallery""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
</code></pre>

<p>This all works great except for the image pop -  because of the way fancy box works it needs the image link in the <code>href</code> of the anchor tag wrapped around the thumbnail. Is it possible to select the image in the content and place it in the <code>href</code> making it look like this effectively:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-3 col-lg-3""&gt;

I know the <code>_resizeColumns</code> function works correctly. However it is being run before the DOM has been updated with the search results. I have verified that <code>_resizeColumns</code> is being called by updating the background-color on all divs with yellow. The divs that existed prior to the model update are getting set to yellow, but the search results are not.</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: 'foo.com',
    data: postData,
    contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
    dataType: 'json',
    processData: true,
    success: function(data) {
      model.SearchResults(data.d); // updates the DOM with the search results via knockout.js
      _resizeColumns();            // does not resize the columns because they haven't been added to the DOM yet
    },
    error: function() { alert('error'); }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The search results do get added to the DOM, it is just after my call to <code>_resizeColumns</code></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I don't think knockout is running asynchronously. I believe it is the web browser itself updating the DOM asynchronously.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>
The <code>_resizeColumns()</code> function works when called directly from <code>$(document).ready()</code>. </p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>
I have two versions of <code>_resizeColumns()</code> one that uses jquery selectors to both get and set the widths, and another that stores into a 2d array when getting widths, and accesses that 2d array when setting them. The 2d array version performs faster. The 2d array version also causes the problem in my original question above. The jquery only version does not.</p>

<pre><code>id (key) | entityName

1        |   john
2        |   harris
3        |   henry
4        |   mark

1        |       1   |   1
2        |       2   |   0
3        |       4   |   1
</code></pre>

<p>Geodata table</p>

<pre><code>id (key) | entityID  | moment (timestamps when the entry was done)

1        |       1   | 1429542320 (smaller)
2        |       1   | 1429542331 (bigger)
3        |       2   | 1429542320 (smaller)
4        |       2   | 1429542331 (biger)
5        |       4   | 1429542331 (bigger)
</code></pre>

<p>Info table</p>

<pre><code>id (key) | entityID | infos | date 

   1     |      1   |  xxx  |   today
   2     |      1   |  xxx  |   yesterday
   3     |      2   |  xxx  |   today
   4     |      2   |  xxx  |   yesterday
   5     |      3   |  xxx  |   yesterday
   6     |      5   |  xxx  |   today
   7     |      5   |  xxx  |   yesterday
   8     |      5   |  xxx  |   tomorrow
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, I need every Entities that has an info for today
Moreover, if their status is true (or 1) (from activity table), show me their date in geodata table.</p>

<p>So this is what i've got :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT e.id, 
       e.entityName, 
       i.infos, 
       a.status, 
       MAX(g.moment) -- but the max only if status =1 
  FROM entities AS e
  LEFT JOIN activity AS a ON a.entityID = e.id
  LEFT JOIN geodata AS g ON g.entityID = e.id
 INNER JOIN infos AS i ON e.id = i.entityID
 WHERE i.date = 'today'
 GROUP BY e.id
</code></pre>

<p>I want every entities that has an info about today, but some of them have activity too, so i want to show it (if it doesn't just let the left join put NULL) If the status is 0, I don't need the moment, but if its true, I only need the bigger one (its numbers, so Max() should do it but it breaks)</p>

<p>The expected results is :</p>

<pre><code>id (key) | entityName | infos |   status |   MAX(moment) | ..other columns

   1     |     john   |  xxx  |      1   | 1429542331 (the bigger one)
   2     |     harris |  xxx  |      0   | NULL
   5     |     dom    |  xxx  |     NULL | NULL
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to try building a proof-of-concept app using the Samsung SmartTV SDK 2.5 (I have a 2011 model TV - UA55D8000). </p>

<p>Unfortunaltely, the SDK comes in two varieties that only seem to work on Microsoft Windows. It's weird because there's no reason it should be the case: the televisions themselves run Linux and applications are written in JavaScript.</p>

<p>This presents two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As I don't have Microsoft Windows at home, I can't use the build environment (nor the TV emulator) that come with the SDK. (The SDK files themselves are just JavaScript)</p></li>
<li><p>Even if I had access to Windows, it's very hard to automate building &amp; testing of the Apps without access to traditional build tools (e.g: Make, Ant, Autotools, etc)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How can I build Samsung Smart TV Applications on Linux? (i.e: without using the Windows-based build tools that come with the SDK)</p>

<hr>

<p><b>What I've figured out so far:</b></p>

<p>From what I can gather, a JavaScript-mode application is simply  zip file containing an XML config file, one or more JavaScript files (including supplied JavaScript interface libraries for platform SDK functions), and any required assets (HTML, images, etc).</p>

<p>Also, from what I gather, deployment involves placing the zip file and an XML manifest file on a web-server network accessible to the TV, logging in as 'develop' on the TV and 'syncing' the application to the installed applications on the TV.</p>

<hr>

<p>Could someone point me to a source for the full deployment requirements &amp; app bundle requirements? Or even just a working sample?</p>

In short - User enters keyword in View1. Hits Enter. Form in View 1 calls View2. ActionResults in View2 calls some logic to search and return View2 as the view and then I can display the results.</p>

<p>I tried some basic things like action=""/View2"" but I was pretty sure it would fail. It says 'the resource cannot be found'. Is it even possible to do this? Kindly advice.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/687/keyboard-for-programmers"">Keyboard for programmers</a></p>

<p>I know there are a few keyboards out there with programmable function keys, but let's say you've already found the keyboard of your dreams and it has no such feature. Ideally I'd like a device with the following qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Similar in size to the USB numeric keypads they sell for laptop users</li>
<li>Each key can be remapped to a user-defined macro.  Macros should at least allow combinations of keypresses (ie, <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>) and ideally should be able to allow pauses (ie, <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (pause) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <kbd>F5</kbd>) and even more ideally should be able to click menu/toolbar items that have no keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Should have OS-specific software that allows different sets of macros to be active depending on the application that's active (ie, separate macros whether I'm in Visual Studio or my text editor)</li>
</ul>

<p>I've found some products and software that are close in functionality. Kensington's Powermate peripheral and its software come pretty close, but I've found that thing to be pretty useless in practice thanks to its limited number of possible inputs. (Only three, or six if you count the click-and-hold gestures, though I find those inconvenient)</p>

<p>Possibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A programmable keypad that does exactly what I want (I've looked and haven't found any, though maybe I just didn't look in the right places)</li>
<li>Specialized ""gamer"" keypads (Saitek had a keyboard with a separate keypad that looked to be close to what I wanted a few years back)</li>
<li>Software that would let a standard run of the mill numeric keypad have this kind of functionality.  The software would have to distinguish between me pressing a button on my normal keyboard's numeric pad versus the external numeric pad, because I wouldn't want to lose the use of my normal numeric pad for entering numbers.</li>
<li>Giving up on the hardware aspect and using mouse gesture software like Gmote to accomplish what I want</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, I'm just <em>awful</em> at remembering keyboard shortcuts.  As a consultant who does a lot of maintainance work for various clients I have to switch environments constantly which compounds the problem.  I can remember some keyboard shortcuts, but not keyboard shortcuts for fifty million different software packages.</p>

<p>the app get 3 colors: blue , green, red. 
they move between 0 to 255 and after every second they are display on screen as abackground using color.rgb(red,gree,blue).</p>

<p>there are 4 timers 1 for every color and one for background displaying. </p>

One thing that is continuously getting in my way are the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties of <code>DisplayObject(Container)</code>s. I'm finally starting to get my head around them and learned that the width and height of a <code>Sprite</code> are determined solely by their contents for example.</p>

<p>I do not understand the following though: I've got a <code>Sprite</code> that I add a bunch of <code>Button</code>s to. The buttons all have a <code>height</code> of 30 and an <code>y</code> of 0. As such, I'd expect the <code>height</code> of the containing <code>Sprite</code> to be 30. Surprisingly, the <code>height</code> is 100.</p>

<p>The Adobe documentation of the <code>height</code> property of a <code>DisplayObject</code> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indicates the height of the display object, in pixels. The height is calculated based on the <strong>bounds</strong> of the content of the display object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, the 'bounds' of the object are important. So I went ahead and wrote this little test in the <code>Sprite</code> that contains the <code>Button</code>s:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; numChildren; ++i)
{
    trace(""Y: "" + getChildAt(i).y + "" H: "" + getChildAt(i).height);
    trace(""BOUNDS H: "" + getChildAt(i).getBounds(this).height);
}
trace(""SCALEY: "" + scaleY + "" TOTAL HEIGHT: "" + height);
</code></pre>

<p>This code iterates through all the objects that are added to its display list and shows their <code>y</code>, <code>height</code> and <code>getBounds().height</code> values. Surprisingly, the output is:</p>

<pre><code>Y: 0 H: 30
BOUNDS H: 100
... (5x) 
SCALEY: 1 TOTAL HEIGHT: 100
</code></pre>

<p>This shows that the bounds of the buttons are actually larger than their height (and the height that they appear to be, visually). I have no clue why this is the case however. So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why are the bounds of my buttons
larger than their height?  </li>
<li>How can I
set the bounds of my buttons so that
my <code>Sprite</code> isn't larger than I'd
expect it to be based on the
position and size of the objects it
contains?</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, the buttons are created as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var control:Button = new Button();
control.setSize(90, 30);
addChild(control);

<p>The items table describes a type of item (""apple"", ""orange"", ""banana""), not individual items.</p>

<p>I select ""POST"", then, in the field next to ""POST"", I enter the ID of my page (a 15-digit-number starting with 102 ending with 937). This ID is correct, because I can <code>GET</code> data from this page using exactly this ID.</p>

<p>The specific example I read, which mirrored my own use-case, is one where the middle tier creates a new design document for every customer, limiting all queries and the associated generated b-trees to that customer.</p>

<p>But doesn't this mean that you'll have, at a best-case scenario (from a business point of view) <em>thousands</em> of design documents?  It occurs to me that since every single one of those design documents has to be run for every insert, if only to emit nothing, that would end up being a heck of a strain on the server.  </p>

<p>Am I missing something essential about the design of CouchDB that makes this a non-issue?  Or is there a smarter way to handle this?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;article data-bind=""foreach: widgets""&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>Widgets is a simple obvservable array:</p>

<pre><code>var widgets= ko.observableArray();
</code></pre>

<p>This works nicely giving me a list of my ""widgets"".  If I add a new ""widget"" to this list then it appears dynamically in the list via data binding.</p>

<p>However as soon as I add sorting to the array:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;article data-bind=""foreach: widgets.sort(function (left, right) { return left.order() == right.order() ? 0 : (left.order() &lt; right.order() ? -1 : 1); })""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then newly added widgets no longer appear in my list - unless I reload the page.  (The sorting works nicely at this point - if I update the ""order"" field that I am sorting on then the items in my list are dynamically re-sorted).</p>

<p>How can I go about getting the sorting to play nicely with the dynamic updating of new items in my observable array?</p>

<p>This is where I am trying to load the data, and if there is no path to plist then create one:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) loadData
{
// load data here
NSString *dataPath = [self getFilePath];
BOOL fileExists = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:dataPath];

NSLog(@""Does the file exist? %i"", fileExists);
// if there is data saved load it into the person array, if not let's create the array to use
if (fileExists) {
    NSLog(@""There is already and array so lets use that one"");
    personArray= [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:dataPath];
    NSLog(@""The number of items in the personArray %i"", personArray.count);
    arrayNumber.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%i"",personArray.count];
}
else
{

    personArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
    arrayNumber.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%i"",personArray.count];
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is where I have a mutable array and then trying to add it to the plist.
    // add the person object to the array
        [personArray addObject:personObject];</p>

<pre><code>    for (Person *obj in personArray)
    {

        NSLog(@""obj.lastName: %@"", obj.lastName);
        NSLog(@""obj.email: %@"", obj.email);
    }


    // check the count of the array to make sure it was added
    NSLog(@""Count of the personArray is %i"", personArray.count);
    arrayNumber.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%i"",personArray.count];

    // check to see if the object was added
    NSLog(@""The number of items in the personArray %i"", personArray.count);
    [personArray writeToFile:[self getFilePath] atomically:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>Everything seems to work, I can log the data in my array to make sure it's there, but when I restart  the app, it never pulls in the plist data. 
I have been working on this for some time, and can't seem to make any progress on it.</p>

<p>Why do we have that different results? My version is the following.</p>

<p>In C program inside of the GetValues() function the items[] local array will be created and initialized. The return instraction will return the pointer to begining of the array, but this array will be allocated at the LOCAL memory of that function. When the last instruction of the GetValues() function will be invoked the local memory will be destroyed. In this case we can't predict what data are stored there and we dont know what will print the <code>printf(""%d\n"", array[i])</code> instruction (no wonder, the memory has been destroyed and values as well).</p>

<p>In java program we have the following situation. Arrays in JAVA are objects. Objects in java are storing in heap. So, after executing <code>foo()</code> method the object <code>array</code> will be created and puted to the heap. After executing method local variables will be cleaned, but our pointer to <code>array</code>-object is still in the heap (garbage collector will understand when this object has to be deleted), what is why we are able to print it normally.</p>

<p>Am I right? Do I understand this features properly? If not can somebody correct me?
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for my english I hope I explained my problem more or less clear.</p>

I think it's brilliant, but missing one feature which I did use often with other test runners such as NUnit - something similar to the <a href=""http://nunit.org/index.php?p=testCaseSource&amp;r=2.5"" rel=""nofollow"">TestCaseSource</a> property from NUnit to specify a potentially dynamic set of data for tests to be ran against at run time.</p>

<p>I would often have different data in each environment the test should run in, so cannot specify hardcoded values for test parameters. A trivial example is for checking that each type of user account is able to login, the user account credentials can be retrieved using a DB query to populate each test case dynamically in NUnit:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;User&gt; GetTestData()
{
    List&lt;User&gt; testData = new List&lt;User&gt;();
    testData = MyDatabase.GetAllUsersInfo().ToList();

    return testData;
}

[Test, TestCaseSource(""GetTestData"")]
public void CallLoginService(User user)
{
    var response = LoginController.TryLogin(User.UserName, User.Password);

    if (response.Error != null)
    {
        Assert.Fail(""Failed to Login: {0}"", response.Error);
    }

    Assert.AreEqual(""Logged in ok"", response.Message, ""Login message not as expected"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a simple example of that feature, but I think it describes it well enough. I know we have the ability in SpecFlow to use a Scenario Outline and table of test run input data, but that is still static, so doesn't fit the bill.</p>

<p>I've been looking for a while and have not found anything in SpecFlow like this yet, does anybody know of anything similar to the above which can be used (or planned if anyone who works on the project reads this)?</p>

<p>I have considered MiniProfiler and Glimpse. </p>

<p>In MiniProfiler it's easy (actually, the only way?) to log profiling messages: </p>

<pre><code>var profiler = MiniProfiler.Current;
using (profiler.Step(""Doing complex stuff""))
{
    using (profiler.Step(""Step A""))
    { // something more interesting here
        Thread.Sleep(100);
    }
    using (profiler.Step(""Step B""))
    { // and here
        Thread.Sleep(250);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Glimpse, you get automatic profiling for the request lifecycle -- but I'm not sure what's the easiest way to profile custom business logic scenarios.</p>

<p>I read <a href=""http://getglimpse.com/Docs/Trace-Tab"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that Glimpse supports <code>System.Diagnostics.(Trace|Debug).Trace*()</code> in its 'Trace' tab, but that only shoows points in time, it doesn't seem to profile nested scopes. It would be nice to be able to trace custom data in a more structured way - for instance in the 'Timeline' tab. </p>

<p>So the question is, can I (hopefully easily) get MiniProfiler-like structured, custom logging in Glimpse?</p>

<p>PS. I know there's a Glimpse extension to display MiniProfiler data, but it looks like it's abandoned.</p>

<p>PPS. I was pleasantly surprised to see Glimpse work (almost) out of the box in my WebForms project (in IIS classic pipeline mode!). AFAIK, MiniProfiler doesn't play very nice with that configuration, it's skewed towards MVC.</p>

If you are confident that the expression can only change due to the current thread's activity (and if you are also confident that no other thread can become current), then you can use software watchpoints as usual. However, gdb may not notice when a non-current thread's activity changes the expression. (Hardware watchpoints, in contrast, watch an expression in all threads.)</em> </p>

I'm using STS v3.4.0.RELEASE and TestNG v6.8.6.20141201_2240. I also have the ScalaIDE plugin for Eclipse 3.0.4.v-2_11-201407232043.</p>

<p>I've got a simple test (MusicalTest.java in my src/test/java) and its corresponding testsuite.xml file that outlines this class with specific method to be included. I run the xml file as a TestNG test and there are no issues, things run just as expected; my testsuite.xml file looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM ""http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd""&gt;
&lt;suite thread-count=""1"" verbose=""1"" name=""Fishy Tests""
    skipfailedinvocationcounts=""false"" junit=""false"" parallel=""methods""
    data-provider-thread-count=""1"" annotations=""JDK""&gt;

    &lt;test verbose=""2"" name=""MusicalTestSuite"" annotations=""JDK"" preserve-order=""true""&gt;
        &lt;classes&gt;
            &lt;class name=""com.rock.and.roll.MusicalTest""/&gt;
        &lt;/classes&gt;
    &lt;/test&gt;
&lt;/suite&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I create a new class (in my case, I created a Scala class in the same package as the above test) called MusicalScalaTest.scala. I go ahead and include it in my testsuite.xml as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM ""http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd""&gt;
&lt;suite thread-count=""1"" verbose=""1"" name=""Fishy Tests""
    skipfailedinvocationcounts=""false"" junit=""false"" parallel=""methods""
    data-provider-thread-count=""1"" annotations=""JDK""&gt;

    &lt;test verbose=""2"" name=""MusicalTestSuite"" annotations=""JDK"" preserve-order=""true""&gt;
        &lt;classes&gt;
            &lt;class name=""com.rock.and.roll.MusicalTest""/&gt;
            &lt;class name=""com.rock.and.roll.MusicalScalaTest""/&gt;
        &lt;/classes&gt;
    &lt;/test&gt;
&lt;/suite&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I run the xml file as a testNG test, I run into the following error:</p>

<pre><code>org.testng.TestNGException:
Cannot find class in classpath: com.rock.and.roll.MusicalTest
    at org.testng.xml.XmlClass.loadClass(XmlClass.java:81)
    at org.testng.xml.XmlClass.init(XmlClass.java:73)

    at ........ &lt;truncated&gt;
    at org.testng.remote.RemoteTestNG.main(RemoteTestNG.java:175)
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly enough, it doesn't complain about the MusicalScalaTest but complains about the MusicalTest instead. I go ahead and comment out the MusicalScalaTest class in the XML file thinking that that's what's causing the confusion, but on running the testNG test I run into the same error again! After this, I delete the MusicalScalaTest.scala class and delete the ""commented"" out line from the xml. No dice. I right click on the project and do a Run As -> Mvn Clean. No dice. I restart my IDE, do a Mvn Clean, and Maven Update Project followed by a refresh. No dice. I uninstall the testNG plugin, run a mvn clean test-compile just to be sure and then go through the usual motions of maven update project followed by a refresh. Then I reinstall the testNG IDE and give the same xml a whirl. No dice.</p>

<p>Frankly <a href=""https://github.com/cbeust/testng-eclipse/issues/84"" rel=""nofollow"">this smells like a test-ng plugin-based issue</a> that has cached some error that it's not willing to purge. I try to run any other testsuite xml files of the same project and they are all complaining with the same error! So basically all my testSuite xml's are out of commission.</p>

<p>Anybody have any recommendations on next steps? I'm trying to make all this work within the IDE as opposed to shifting to the terminal and running testNG through there. If you think it's not worth it at this point, drop a comment regardless.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This code works like - prntscr.com/7rrozc - displays all tags( on right side ) and post ID(on left side ) divided by ""||"" from current archive page posts.</p>

<h2>End result:</h2>

<p>I need to display only one tag, if it similar to another. </p>

<hr>

<p>I have two posts, their tags: first post( ""vip 1"", ""vip 2"", ""vip 3"", ""OTHER"" ), second post( ""vip 1"", ""vip 2"", ""OTHER 2""). </p>

<hr>

<p>In sidebar must be displayed ""vip 1"", ""vip 2"",""vip 3"",""OTHER"",""OTHER 2"".</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm stuck on that question for two days, i have no solution in my mind... If someone knows how to do that, pls help me out. I would be happy for a little hint.</p>

    )

    name = models.CharField( max_length = 2, choices = TYPE_CHOICES )
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>admins.py</code>, I set <code>filter_horizontal = ( 'user_types', )</code> for <code>UserProfile</code>, which has a <code>ManyToManyField</code> to <code>UserType</code>. But in the <code>UserProfile</code> admin page, the horizontal filter for M2M only shows the short-name of the tuple:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/RBgrm.png"" /></p>

<p>Also in a template, I want to show a list of user types a particular user has. So my template code looks like this</p>

<pre><code>User type:
&lt;ul&gt;
    {% if user_object.profile.user_types.all %}
        {% for user_type in user_object.profile.user_types.all %}
            &lt;li&gt;{{ user_type|capfirst }}&lt;/li&gt;
        {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
        &lt;li&gt;No user type&lt;/li&gt;
    {% endif %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And on the template, it displays only the short-name. I know normally I could show it the long-name by doing something like <code>{{ get_user_type_display }}</code>, but in this case for M2M, it doesn't work.</p>

<p>So my question is two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I display the long-name of a M2M choice/tuple in the admin page?</li>
<li>How do I display the long-name in a M2M choice/tuple in a template?</li>

<p><strong>What I want to do:</strong> </p>

<p>I have two classes <em>T1</em> and <em>T2</em> that have both a DependencyProperty <em>IntTest</em>, defaulting to 0. T1 should be the root to T2, just like a Window is the logical root/parent to a TextBox it contains.</p>

<p>So when I don't set the value of <em>T2.IntTest</em> explictly it should provide the value of <em>T1.IntTest</em> (just like for example TextBox.FlowDirection usually delivers the parent window's FlowDirection).</p>

<p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>

<p>I created two classes T1 and T2, deriving from FrameworkElement in order to use <em>FrameworkPropertyMetadata</em> with <em>FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.Inherits</em>. Also I read that in order to use value inheritance you must design the DependencyProperty as an AttachedProperty.</p>

<p>Currently when I assign a value to the root T1, it is not returned by the DP-Getter of the child T2. </p>

<p>What am I doing wrong???</p>

<p>These are the two classes:</p>

<pre><code>// Root class
public class T1 : FrameworkElement
{
    // Definition of an Attached Dependency Property 
    public static readonly DependencyProperty IntTestProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached(""IntTest"", typeof(int), typeof(T1), 
        new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(0, FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.Inherits));

    // Static getter for Attached Property
    public static int GetIntTest(DependencyObject target)
    {
        return (int)target.GetValue(IntTestProperty);
    }

    // Static setter for Attached Property
    public static void SetIntTest(DependencyObject target, int value)
    {
        target.SetValue(IntTestProperty, value);
    }

    // CLR Property Wrapper
    public int IntTest
    {
        get {  return GetIntTest(this); }
        set { SetIntTest(this, value); }
    }
}


// Child class - should inherit the DependenyProperty value of the root class
public class T2 : FrameworkElement
{
    public static readonly DependencyProperty IntTestProperty = T1.IntTestProperty.AddOwner(typeof(T2),
        new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(0, FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.Inherits));

    public int IntTest
    {
        get { return (int)GetValue(IntTestProperty); }
        set { SetValue(IntTestProperty, value); }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the code to try it out:</p>

<pre><code>        T1 t1 = new T1();
        T2 t2 = new T2();

        // Set the DependencyProperty of the root
        t1.IntTest = 123;

        // Do I have to build a logical tree here? If yes, how?

        // Since the DependencyProperty of the child was not set explicitly, 
        // it should provide the value of the base class, i.e. 123. 
        // But this does not work: i remains 0   :((
        int i = t2.IntTest;

<p>The problem is the 'emailValidate' callback assumes a well formed email address has been entered, something like a@b.com, but if I enter garbage, like 'fdadfaa', the form still proceeds to try to execute the post validator, when it shouldn't. There is no reason to issue a query if the data is no good. </p>

<p>I <a href=""http://symfonyexperts.com/question/show/id/131"" rel=""nofollow"">found</a> a 'halt_on_error' flag which can be passed to a schema validator constructor, but didn't work for me. Anyone else cross this bridge?</p>

"29006981","1","","","2015-03-12 10:15:23","","1","47","<p>I am new to PHP OOP (coded PHP in procedural style for some time now) and I think that I understood the SOLID principles and I understood that an object not necessarely is equal to an entity in a relational database. Anyway I have slight problems to apply this knowledge to this practical situation:</p>

<p>I want to write a class serving/handling product data which is attributes of products (like product name, weight, etc.) but als quantity on stock, open orders, next incoming shipment (with date and quantity being delivered) and so on.</p>

<p>This alone raises questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does the plan to create one class to serve all this data interfere with the single responsibility principle (so is serving the quantity in stock another responsibility than serving the weight of the product)? In other words: Should I rather write an extra class for serving product attributes and another class to serve quantity in stock and another class to serve incoming shipments on this product? To explain: It can be, that external code accessing the object data of this class does not need all these information but just a part of it (e.g. either an attribute of the product or the next incoming shipments, but maybe the external code also needs both).</p></li>
<li><p>If I should write two different classes would they be totally seperate or should one extend the other? I personally do not see why one should extend the other as it can always be that only one of these two is needed, so why should I link them together then.</p></li>
<li><p>What I know from past experience is that the bottle neck of PHP applications very often is the number of queries you send to the database interface. If I divide everything in different classes, I have several database queries while I would only need two if I have it in one class.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyway if I write it in one class, I still have two queries while maybe the outside code needs only data that can be retrieved from one of these two queries. Should I put the two queries in two different methods and let the code outside of the class decide which methods should be executed and therefore decide which parts of the product data are available in the object? (This would be to save on resources and execution time.)</p></li>
<li><p>If I want to prevent that the outside code has to decide which methods to call to have the right data available should I better declare the properties to be private and have the magic __get function execute the necessary queries? I myself believe this is a dirty work around and I read somewhere that the magic __get function is rather a type of error handling if an outside code wants to access private properties.</p></li>
<li><p>Should I also add data manipulation methods to this class? I could add one for changing the static attributes of a product, but does it make sense to have a method in this class to change the quantity in orders? I think this would rather belong to an ""orders"" class than to a class of product data, right?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is some code snippet to illustriate, what I intend to do (in this case I wrote to serve all data by one class and let the outside code decide which method to call to have the right data available:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class productdata {

    public $productID;
    public $productname;
    public $weight;
    public $deliverytime;
    public $deprecated;
    public $openorderquantity;
    public $stock;
    public $opensupplierorders;

    public function readproductdatafromDB() {

        $db = new Db();
        $safe_productID = $db-&gt;quote($this-&gt;productID);

        $rows_get_productdata = $db-&gt;select(""SELECT ..."");

        $error = $db -&gt; error();

        foreach ($rows_get_productdata as $row_get_productdata) {
            $this -&gt; productname = $row_get_productdata[""productname""];
            $this -&gt; weight = $row_get_productdata[""weight""];
            $this -&gt; deliverytime = $row_get_productdata[""deliverytime""];
            $this -&gt; deprecated = $row_get_productdata[""deprecated""];
            $this -&gt; openorderquantity = $row_get_productdata[""openorderquantity""];
            $this -&gt; stock = $row_get_productdata[""stock""];
        }

    } 

    public function readopensupplierordersfromDB () {

        $db = new Db();
        $safe_productID = $db-&gt;quote($this-&gt;productID);

        $this-&gt;opensupplierorders = $db-&gt;select(""SELECT ..."");

        $error = $db -&gt; error();

    } 

} ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Please do not care about the DB calls I have a good DB wrapping class, I think.</p>

<p>When calling the class I would do:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$productdata = new productdata();
$productdata-&gt;productID = '123';
$productdata-&gt;readproductdatafromDB();
echo ""The weight of the product is: "" . $productdata-&gt;weight;
?&gt;

This 200 files will be for example : for selling cars, bikes etc. In all the title, head, keywords I used a variable x which is the location. Then I used a scripting language to open each of the 200 files, replace x with location name, save it in different names. For ex: location1_websitename_cars.php. There are more than million locations. I created 200× million files like these. But I cannot host my website economically due to file number limitation on shared hosting servers.</p>

<p>My intention for replicating 200 files for each location was that google search engine can find my pages when user searches the location name as keyword. As per my understanding google crawls through the existing pages in server and find the location name as keyword and this results in inclusion of webpage in search results. Since this approach wont work with shared hosting, I changed strategy.</p>

<p>I am able to generate files required for a location dynamically according to the user selected location from the home page of my website. In this case I just need to store 200 files in my server. All pages would be accessible from home page of website. But I don’t know whether that pages would accessible from google search. For ex: if user types : ""location1 www.mywebsite.com cars "", that php page wont be displayed as this page don’t exist in server. It is to be dynamically created.</p>

<p>To simply put: "" Is there a way of including my website pages in google search results if that page don’t exist in server. It would be dynamically created once user selects some input and submit it from the home page.</p>

Ideally I would like to use [NSDate distantPast] and  [NSDate distantFuture] to retrieve in a single call all of the events in all of the calendars. Is this actually possible? Also, since even the second example does not work (at least for me), what is the proper way to retrieve all of the events? Do I need multiple calls with a narrow time interval? If yes, what is the largest time interval once can use to retrieve the events?

I've done part of the domain model and I'm trying to figure out how to do something that's pretty basic in SQL alone, but I can't figure it out in my application.  Here are my Entities:</p>

<pre><code>[Table(Name=""Users"")]

    [Column] public int ParentId { get; set; }

    [Column] public string Description { get; set; }
    [Column] public bool IsGlobal { get; set; }
    [Column] public int DisplayOrder { get; set; }
}

<p>I also have a linking table called AllowedForums that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>userid  forumid
  1       4
</code></pre>

<p>In order to select the forums that a user is allowed to view and forums where IsGlobal == true I'd do this in SQL:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Forums
LEFT OUTER JOIN AllowedForums ON Forums.id = AllowedForums.Forumid
WHERE AllowedForums.Userid = 1
OR Forums.IsGlobal = 1
</code></pre>

<p>How should I populate the </p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;Forum&gt; AllowedForums

<p>Should AllowedForum be a value object with its own table mapping?  That seems like overkill but I could easily join on it.  I looked briefly at EntitySet but the simple example I saw didn't seem to fit.  It feels like there should be an elegant way to get a collection of Forum objects for each User, but I can't come up with any.  BTW, I'm new to C# &amp; OO.  I should also mention that since these are the early stages of the app, I'm open to changing the structure/relationships of the entities or tables if there's a better approach I'm not seeing.</p>

There is already an existing request that was made and enabled on a specific processor. I would like to extend this IRQ, which fires based off a hardware counter, such that there exists an IRQ for each of the processors, and if any of the IRQs are triggered, they are funnelled to the already existing IRQ and its handler.

<p>A better explanation is that the IRQ is the same across all processors. So, I would like to change an already requested and enabled IRQ (requested, enabled, and handled in a separate .c file) to a percpu IRQ within the new .c file</p>

    return nodes;

<p>And it can be enhanced to save a copy of the current position and the score?</p>

<ul>
<li>9 tables total</li>
<li>Company can be a supplier, customer or both</li>
<li>Company can have many or no addresses (billing/delivery etc)</li>
<li>Company can have many or no contact names</li>
<li>Contacts can have many or no email addresses and many or no phone numbers of different types (DDI, mobile, fax etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Being my first attempt it's highly likely the code is not sophisticated, elegant, efficient or robust but it appears to work for now and I'm enjoying the learning curve.</p>

<p>So I can check correct working I have created a select statement incorporating full outer table joins, aliases, column formatting and breaks to produce a report to look something like in the link below.</p>

<p><code>BREAK on c1 on c2 on c3 on c4 on c5 on c6 on c7 on c8 on c9 on c10
COLUMN c1 HEADING ACCT FORMAT A6
COLUMN c2 HEADING COTY FORMAT A4
COLUMN c3 HEADING ""COMPANY NAME"" FORMAT A35
COLUMN c4 HEADING CITY FORMAT A15
COLUMN c5 HEADING POSTCODE FORMAT A10
COLUMN c6 HEADING FIRSTNAME FORMAT A10
COLUMN c7 HEADING SURNAME FORMAT A10
COLUMN c8 HEADING EMAIL FORMAT A39
COLUMN c9 HEADING TYPE FORMAT A8
COLUMN c10 HEADING NUMBER FORMAT A20
SELECT
  cp.code c1, cp.type c2, cp.name c3, ad.city c4, ad.postcode c5, ct.firstname c6, ct.surname c7, em.emailaddress c8, pt.type c9, ph.phoneno c10
FROM company cp FULL OUTER JOIN companyaddress cpad ON cp.companyid=cpad.companyid
                FULL OUTER JOIN address ad ON cpad.addressid=ad.addressid

                FULL OUTER JOIN email em ON ct.contactid=em.contactid
                FULL OUTER JOIN phone ph ON ct.contactid=ph.contactid
                FULL OUTER JOIN phonetype pt ON ph.phonetypeid=pt.phonetypeid

<p>2 Issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Notice the TYPE column.  This shows the type of phone number.  What I can't fathom is why sometimes the column is indented to the left and creeps into the formatted space for the EMAIL column.  Whatsmore this appears inconsistent.  I'm sure this is a formatting issue and I have experimented with returning more/less columns from the joined tables and also with my column size allocation in the column formats.  These variations sometimes result in a correct column format but I can't find any consistency which isolates the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a contact has two email addresses but only one phone type the phone details are listed twice.  See contact Dave Michaels for CompanyE Ltd.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have tried reducing down the functionality to a few tables and a few lines of code.  I hoped this would isolate the problem or limit the lines of code I may need to post but no  joy.  I can supply the schema diagram and scripts for table create, data insert and select to anyone who would be willing to assist me.  I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>My question is that if the user clicks another rows edit button, instead of the cancel or submit button on the currently editable row, is there a way to return the first editable row to a non-editable state while leaving the newly selected row editable?</p>

<p>Here's the grid if you want to check is out. Rather large amount of code. The data is passed to the grid through a function. This is part of a large MVC app. The data is in json format.</p>

                         &amp;&amp; noexcept(std::declval&lt;typename std::decay&lt;T&gt;::type&gt;() = std::forward&lt;T&gt;(t)))
{
  typedef typename std::decay&lt;T&gt;::type DT;
  /* ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>The need to repeat <code>typename std::decay&lt;T&gt;::type</code> so often seems overly verbose.  I could replace the whole expression with the <code>DT</code> type, but unfortunately this is only available in the function body.</p>

<p>The easiest way to introduce <code>DT</code> before the function body I can think of is this:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T, typename DT = typename std::decay&lt;T&gt;::type&gt;
void foo(T&amp;&amp; t) noexcept(   noexcept(DT(std::forward&lt;T&gt;(t)))
                         &amp;&amp; noexcept(std::declval&lt;DT&gt;() = std::forward&lt;T&gt;(t)))
{
  /* DT also available here... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>It feels like the wrong thing to add another template parameter just for this purpose though.  So, my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any harmful side effects to adding the extra defaulted template parameter?</li>
<li>Is this considered bad practice?</li>
<li>Are there any other ways to introduct <code>DT</code> so that it is available in the <code>noexcept</code> specifier?</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:
It occurs to me that the real problem isn't so much gaining access to <code>DT</code>, but decreasing the complexity of the <code>noexcept</code> expression entirely (as it is used on many functions).  I've added an answer below that creates a custom trait for this purpose.</p>

<p>Here is the deal. I've started to play a bit with the Firefox Add-On SDK, and I want to develop a specific add-on / Firefox extension. </p>

<p>Case 1: </p>

<ul>
<li>I want to develop an add-on that creates a new icon in the toolbar (This is not a big deal.)</li>
<li>I want to develop an add-on that highlights on a page some specific text (This will variable according to the domain) and when hovering it, to display a small pop-up with different info about the specific text. </li>
</ul>

<p>Case 2: </p>

<ul>
<li>I want to develop an add-on that creates a new icon in the toolbar (This is not a big deal.)</li>
<li>I want to develop an add-on that implements a new context element (a new option when right clicking) to search info about the selected text and display it by the same pop-up referred in Case 1. </li>
</ul>

<p>Do you think that at least 1 of these 2 cases can be developed using Firefox Add-On SDK using modules as context-menu, widget, panel? I'm asking these because after looking over those modules I've seen some different results than the ones that I was expected. </p>

<p>While waiting for some tips I'm gonna try harder to get it done. :) </p>

I also looked at the counts for the moc insertedObjects, updatedObjects, and deletedObjects. These all look right.</p>

<p>The calling code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) calculateBoundsForSearch {
    NSArray *searchesArray = [currentSearchEntity.resultOfSearch allObjects];

    MyMKMapBounds bounds = [MapController calculateBoundsForArrayOfSearchResults:searchesArray];

    currentSearchEntity.minLatitude = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:bounds.min.latitude];
    currentSearchEntity.minLongitude = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:bounds.min.longitude];
    currentSearchEntity.maxLatitude = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:bounds.max.latitude];
    currentSearchEntity.maxLongitude = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:bounds.max.longitude];

    [dataInterface commitBackgroundChangesAndNotify:@""bounds""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is called by two objects. For one, there is no exception.</p>

<p>The only output in the console is this:</p>

<pre><code>2012-07-22 10:47:13.790 myApp[46578:17e07] enter commit

Catchpoint 7 (exception thrown).2012-07-22 10:47:21.160 myApp[46578:17e07] exit commit
</code></pre>

<p>This is a non-fatal exception. One thing I noticed, which I don't understand, is that when it breaks, I have to click continue twice to get past it. The message <code>Catchpoint 7 (exception thrown).</code> is shown after the first click.</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out what tools I have on hand to determine the cause of the exception. Of course, any ideas on what is causing the exception would be helpful, too.</p>

<p>My problem is printing transaction. I am able to print something but the wrong values are coming up. For example, when you create a bank account, you will need to input a opening balance which was (5.00). When I print transaction,  nothing comes up. So I deposit money into the same account (10.00), when I print, the (5.00) from before comes up and the (10.00) appears in the transactionDate. Hpwever, when I view the account balance, it all adds up to what it show be.</p>

Should I typedef the structure?
Do I define the structure in a header file and include that header in each c++ source file?
Do I need the #ifndef macro in the header file?
Do I declare the structure extern in the header?</p>

<p>If I have an array of elements A [0 to 15], and I know that the median is in the range A[8..11]. How can I find the median of all the elements in A by picking it from A[8..11]? What will its rank be? I've been reading a lot about this but I couldn't find an answer to this specific question. Any help is appreciated. The array basically contains 2D points, and I want to split the points into rectangular regions.</p>

<p>So, basically i'm trying to attach an handler to every mathjax rendered object so that when i click one of those, the function ""jax_remove"" is called.</p>

<p>The problem is that no matter what mathjax element I click, it removes the last mathjax element!</p>

<p>This is the function i'm using:</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function() { //timeout is necessary for mathjax loading
    jaxes = MathJax.Hub.getAllJax(""math"");
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; jaxes.length; i++) {
        var jax=jaxes[i];
        alert(jax.inputID);
        $(""#""+jax.inputID+""-Frame"").click(function() {                     
            jax_remove(jax);
        });
    };
},1250);
</code></pre>

<p>if you inspect the DOM, you can see that every rendered mathjax is included in a span with an id like ""MathJax-Element-n-Frame"", where n=1,2,3,... so those are the element I attached the handler to, and it seems to work, the proof are the two initial alerts that comes out.</p>

<p>So the problem seems to be in the link to the ""jax_remove"" function.</p>

<p>Can you please help me?</p>

<p>I solved this problem like so:</p>

<pre><code>def unify_refrences(match_list):
    """"""Makes each unique refrence to a model instance non-unique.

    In cases where multiple model instances are being used django creates a new
    object for each model instance, even if it that means creating the same
    instance twice. If one of these objects has its state changed any other
    object refrencing the same model instance will not be updated. This method
    ensure that state changes are seen. It makes sure that variables which hold
    objects pointing to the same model all hold the same object.

    Visually this means that a list of [var1, var2] whose internals look like so:

        var1 --&gt; object1 --&gt; model1
        var2 --&gt; object2 --&gt; model1

    Will result in the internals being changed so that:

        var2 ------^

    match_dict = {}
    for match in match_list:

<p>My question: Is there a way to solve the problem more elegantly through the use of QuerySets without needing to call save at any point? If not, I'd like to make the solution more generic: how can you get a list of the foreign keys on a model instance or do you have a better generic solution to my problem?</p>

<p>Please correct me if you think I don't understand why this is happening.</p>

<p>First I tried using the JVM options given below when starting the Play app.</p>

<pre><code>-Dhttp.proxyHost=&lt;proxy_server_hostname&gt; -Dhttp.proxyPort=&lt;proxy_server_port&gt; -Dhttp.proxyUser=&lt;username&gt; -Dhttp.proxyPassword=&lt;password&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Above didn't work fully. Application was able to connect to the proxy server without any issue, but proxy server is returning PROXY_AUTH_REQUIRED error which suggests that -Dhttp.proxyUser and -Dhttp.proxyPassword JVM options didn't work.</p>

<p>I searched and found the following two links which shows how to do this in a typical Java application.</p>

<p><a href=""http://memorynotfound.com/configure-http-proxy-settings-java/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://memorynotfound.com/configure-http-proxy-settings-java/</a>
<a href=""http://rolandtapken.de/blog/2012-04/java-process-httpproxyuser-and-httpproxypassword"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rolandtapken.de/blog/2012-04/java-process-httpproxyuser-and-httpproxypassword</a></p>

<p>As suggested in these two links, I modified my Play application's onStart method in Global.java as below,</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onStart(Application application) {
    //Proxy authentication begin
    System.setProperty(""http.proxyHost"", ""&lt;proxy_server_hostname&gt;"");
    System.setProperty(""http.proxyPort"", ""&lt;proxy_server_port&gt;"");
    System.setProperty(""http.proxyUser"", ""&lt;username&gt;"");
    System.setProperty(""http.proxyPassword"", ""&lt;password&gt;"");

    Authenticator.setDefault(new Authenticator() {
        @Override
        protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
            if (getRequestorType() == RequestorType.PROXY) {
                String prot = getRequestingProtocol().toLowerCase();
                String host = System.getProperty(prot + "".proxyHost"", """");
                String port = System.getProperty(prot + "".proxyPort"", """");
                String user = System.getProperty(prot + "".proxyUser"", """");
                String password = System.getProperty(prot + "".proxyPassword"", """");

                if (getRequestingHost().equalsIgnoreCase(host)) {
                    if (Integer.parseInt(port) == getRequestingPort()) {
                        return new PasswordAuthentication(user, password.toCharArray());
                    }
                }
            }
            return null;
        }
    });
    //Proxy authentication end
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the above modification I started the Play application *without specifying the previously mentioned JVM options (as I an now giving the same in the code). But the result remained the same. The proxy server still returns PROXY_AUTH_REQUIRED error message to the application. Again the application is connecting to the proxy server with the above code modification, but Java Authenticator seems not submitting the proxy username and password to the proxy server.</p>

<p>Or is there a different approach to do this in a Play Java application?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The structure of the Network is 27 *16 * 2
The input layer has 26 inputs for each letter of the alphabet plus a bias unit.</p>

<p>My problem is that the error is thrown violently in opposite directions as each new training example is encountered. As I mentioned, the training examples are read in, in alternating fashion (English, Africaans, English....)</p>

<p>I can train the network to identify all English, or all Africaans, but not to identify either one (both) in the same pass.</p>

<p>The y-axis below is the Output signal error for each of the two output nodes (English and Africaans), and the x axis is the number of the training example. In a way, it does exactly what I programmed it to do; when the example is English it the changes the weights to identify English better. However, in doing so, it makes the network worse at predicting Africaans. This is why the error goes between positive and negative values.</p>

<p>Wrote this line in the compiled template to error log it:</p>

<ul>
<li>the C code automatically get the value in the address pointed at by the pointer and inserts it in to the integer. </li>
<li>integer take the address in the pointer and stores the address in the 4 bytes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reason i am asking is because changing from 32 bit to 64 bit a pointer can not be cast to a integer any more. That is because the size of memory a pointer takes is 64 bit which is 8 bytes.</p>

<p>A pointer could be pointing to an integer or a long since we do not know the value size the pointer is pointing to. </p>

<p>Is it the pointer address can not be stored in the integer or the value it contains can not be stored in the integer?</p>

<p>Say this simple code. This will not work on 64bit. Even though the pointer is to be treated as an integer it can not be cast. This leads me to believe that it is not taking the value but the address of the pointer and inserting it in to the integer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 32 bit the integer takes the pointer address and knows that it has
  to take 4 bytes from that pointer address to get the full value.</p>

<p>Is that statement correct?</p>

<pre><code>int main(void){

int number = 3;
int * pnumber = &amp;number;
int castNumber = (int)pnumber;

}
</code></pre>

<p>I had a look at this question but still did not make sense what is actually happening under the hood.

<p>I am currently in database <code>db2</code> where I have the old table <code>y7vhb_menu</code>, and my new table is in <code>db1</code> named <code>category</code>.</p>

<p>I am using an INSERT INTO SELECT QUERY for migration, I have in table <code>category</code> 2 columns that map the old data <code>old_menu_id</code> and <code>old_parent_id</code>. The id in table <code>category</code> is auto increment.</p>

<p>My problem resides when I'm trying to migrate the new parent ID, what I am trying to do is a nested select within the big SELECT statement :</p>

<pre><code>(SELECT db1.category.category_id 
                FROM db1.category 
                WHERE db1.category.old_menu_id =  level_1.parent_id) 
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is trying to obtain the <code>new_parent_id</code> based on the newly inserted Ids in table <code>category</code> where I am selecting the <code>db1.category.category_id</code> where the <code>old_menu_id</code> is the same as the <code>parent_id</code> in the old table : <code>WHERE db1.category.old_menu_id =  level_1.parent_id</code>.</p>

<p>I know this is a bit HARSH, and I can do a query post the migration process to obtain the new parent IDs easily but I'm trying to do this in one query.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to query data in the table am trying to insert to using a select statement from within this select statement??</strong></p>

<p>Note : This is only part of my select statement, I am getting all the menus and their children in my select, and I have ordered the menus so that parents are surely inserted before children.</p>

<p>Below is my full query. Please tell me if this is doable or not??</p>

<pre><code>    INSERT INTO db1.category 

    SELECT  null,
            NOW(), 
            CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ,

The idea is to be able to run this interface on a network hosted intranet with straight HTML, plain Javascript, VBScript &amp; ActiveX objects, so that it doesn't require IIS etc to run ASP or PHP etc (I don't want to involve corporate IT for the IIS).</p>

<p>All is going pretty well, &amp; I'm impressed with the setup except for a few minor things - checking if a frame is loaded, &amp; global variables.</p>

<p>My setup is a HTML page hosting 5 frames with each containing an empty  (which gets the page written to it dynamically), but I need to ensure all frames are loaded before getting into the heavy stuff (which Javascript is handling brilliantly!). But I'm finding that Javascript sux at truly detecting if a frame is loaded (someone please prove me wrong!). I have all 5 frames call a function fnInitialiseIfReady(), then if I could either successfully test if all frames are loaded, or if I could globally count if this function has been called 5 times, I can proceed with confidence &amp; call my function fnInitialise(). But unfortunately neither is working for me. :(</p>

<p>From tireless internet searches, I've tried the 'frames always load in order' theory, &amp; that is simply not correct. I have set up a test with the frames calling a function passing their name as a parameter, &amp; each time the frames load in a different order every time. It is totally random. Note: I proved this by having the first 4 frames call a certain function(which contains an alert() line showing the frame name parameter passed), &amp; having the last frame call a different function (which contains an alert(""all are loaded!"") line). The ""all are loaded!"" does not always appear last.</p>

<p>I've also tried the '.frames[""FrameName""].document.loaded' approach, &amp; it ALWAYS returns 'undefined' for every frame. Am I doing something wrong here?</p>

<p>I've also tried the '.frames[""FrameName""].window.location.href' approach &amp; it ALWAYS returns the html filename regardless of whether that page has loaded or not, so it is not an indicator of loading completion.</p>

<p>I've also tried the '.frames[""FrameName""].document.location' approach &amp; it's ALWAYS the same as the '.window.location.href' approach.</p>

<p>Also, I'm finding Javascript will not hold global variables for me at all. I don't know if it's a combination of multiple frames &amp; using Javascript &amp; VBScript together, but global variables just do not hold a value at all. Local variables (within functions) are fine. Any ideas? I don't have many globals, so I'm thinking of using a cookie. A valid Solution?</p>

<p>BTW, the reason for also using VBScript is that it accesses the ActiveX controls by default, &amp; being a corporate intranet app I can guarantee MSIE usage.</p>

<p>It's frustrating because if I can solve these 2 relatively minor issues, then I'm super impressed with the robustness of this Javascript/VBScript approach. By leveraging each of their strengths, it's crunching the data just as quickly as the VB, C#, &amp; C++ programs I've written for this particular dataset. I'm impressed! :)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

DateTime WorkItemToCompleteByLocal{get; set;}

<p>I'd like to store Australian/American/Indian/Other times in the Local property and the respective UTC value in the other one. Since am dealing with dozens of time zones, I have code that converts the UTC to the desired timezone and stores it in the WorkItemToCompleteByLocal property. 
I'd like Mongo to store this value 'as-is' and return it to me. The problem is that Mongo always stores it as ISODate and converts the value to Utc version.
To explain.
If UTC is 0730 Hours and I compute Brisbane Time to 1730Hours and set it to WorkitemToCompleteByLocal, 
they get saved as </p>

<pre><code>""WorkItemToCompleteBy"" : ISODate(""2013-06-05T07:30:00Z""),
""WorkItemToCompleteByLocal"" : ISODate(""2013-06-05T12:00:00Z""),

<p>Mongo interprets  the time provided as local, <em>the server being in India</em> and coverts it to the equivalent UTC of 1200 hours. While it retrieves values back as 1730 (IST Albeit) It defeats my purpose and prevents me from running any local time based queries on Mongo. Am out of ideas.

I have a small windows application written in C# that I'm making that is essentially a server listening for HTTP calls from an android device. The application basically acts as a remote - if it hears mute, it will mute the volume of the computer, and so on. My issue is I'm having some problems with pausing the foreground application. I'm specifically trying to imitate the play/pause button you see on so many keyboards these days. My method for doing so has been to use the Windows Input Simulator project (<a href=""http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/</a>) to simulate that play/pause key. Unfortunately, I'm not getting any type of discernible response - nothing in particular is happening. Fearing my set up, I switched the VirtualKeyCode.MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE flag to the mute key flag and successfully muted my machine. Note that I am using Windows Media Player so I'm confident it's listening for the call.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is, is there any extra setup I need to do before I can pause whatever media is currently playing? Are there any other ways to achieve what I'm after rather than simulating the key press? Any help would be much appreciated guys!</p>

<p>My question is, a user can type very quickly..So is there any way that instead of making a request to the API for every letter the user types, can we create a delay i.e. if the difference between typing 2 successive letters is extremely small, combine that into a single requests (rather than make 2 separate requests)</p>

<p>Alas, the gcc-C++0x-implementations 4.5 does not seem to be working, I get a link error <a href=""http://ideone.com/LY7hc"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>But here is my gcc-4.7.0 try, quite straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;regex&gt;
using namespace std;
int main () {
    regex rxWorld(""world"");
    const string text = ""hello world!"";
    const auto t0 = text.cbegin();
    smatch match;
    const bool ok = regex_search(text, match, rxWorld);
    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think I should get <code>ok==true</code> <em>and</em> something in <code>match</code> as well. I reduced the example to a very simple regex for this. I tried slightly more complicated first.</p>

<p>But by printing code at <code>/* ... */</code> says otherwise:</p>

<pre><code>  cout &lt;&lt; ""  text:'"" &lt;&lt; text
       &lt;&lt; ""' ok:"" &lt;&lt; ok
       &lt;&lt; "" size:"" &lt;&lt; match.size();
  cout &lt;&lt; "" pos:"" &lt;&lt; match.position()
       &lt;&lt; "" len:""&lt;&lt; match.length();
  for(const auto&amp; sub : match) {
      cout &lt;&lt; "" [""&lt;&lt;(sub.first-t0)&lt;&lt;""..""&lt;&lt;(sub.second-t0)
           &lt;&lt; "":""&lt;&lt;sub.matched
           &lt;&lt; ""'""&lt;&lt;sub.str()
           &lt;&lt; ""']"";
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./regex-search-01.x
text:'hello world!' ok:0 size:0 pos:-1 len:0
</code></pre>

<p><em>Update: I also tried <code>regex_search(t0, text.cend(), match, rxWorld)</code> and <code>const char* text</code>, no change.</em>
`</p>

<p><strong>Is my understanding of <code>regex_search</code> wrong?</strong> I am completely baffled. Or is it just the gcc?</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1372068/how-to-use-two-different-microsoft-interop-assemblies-in-one-project?rq=1"">How to use two different Microsoft Interop assemblies in one project?</a></p>

<p>The crux of the matter is that I need to instantiate a particular version of the namespace and class, depending on the user machine situation.  I don't want to use both assemblies for various purposes; just the right one.  Some actual code, using WordPerfect and its API, PerfectScript:</p>

<p>This is the simple set-up, using only the WPx4 dll</p>

<pre><code>using WordPerfect;

namespace WP_PS_Tools {

public class WP_PerfectScript {
    public PerfectScript perfectScript { get; set; }
    public IntPtr _wpHandle { get; set; }

    /**
     * Initialize perfect script object
     */
    public WP_PerfectScript()
    {
        perfectScript = new PerfectScript();
    }
...
</code></pre>

<p>No problems here. The ""WordPerfect"" reference is to a Primary Interop Assembly that I created from the vendor's ""wpwin14.tlb"".</p>

<p>However, some of my users have WPx6 installed, so they need to use the newer WPx6 dll.  These dlls are very similar, with nearly identical methods, and share the same class name and can share the same namespace (depending on how I create the Primary Interop Assembly).</p>

<p>I first tried using the route attempted by this question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22460689/allowing-multiple-versions-of-the-same-com-library"">Allowing multiple versions of the same COM library</a>, for which there is a very cryptic and unfinished description by Microsoft on how to modify an assembly to include 2 versions: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1565h6hc.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">How to: Wrap Multiple Versions of Type Libraries</a>.  I also could not figure out how to add another assembly to an existing one, plus I was not convinced that would actually help.</p>

<p>The next futile attempt was to try to somehow abstract the class so that one or the other could be called, depending on the particular installation: </p>

<pre><code>using Corel.WordPerfect14;

namespace WP_PS_Tools {

public class WP14_PerfectScript {
    public virtual PerfectScript perfectScript { get; set; }
    public IntPtr _wpHandle { get; set; }

    /**
     * Initialize perfect script object
     */
    public WP14_PerfectScript()
    {
        perfectScript = new PerfectScript();
    } 
.
.
.

using Corel.WordPerfect16;

namespace WP_PS_Tools
{
public class WP16_PerfectScript: WP14_PerfectScript
{
    public PerfectScript perfectScript { get; set; }


    public WP16_PerfectScript()
    {
        perfectScript = new PerfectScript();
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>This did not even compile, because of the main problem:  the property perfectScript has to be cast as one or the other versions of the PerfectScript types (in this example, the class Corel.WordPerfect14.PerfectScript or Corel.WordPerfect16.PerfectScript).  Inserting ""new"" did as expected:  I got a version of the WPx4 dll running perfectly (but unable to interact with the already running WPx6 program).  As far as I know, there is no other more abstract type than the PerfectScript class itself, so I can't use that class to inherit from.</p>

<p>I also tried naming the two assemblies exactly the same, but Visual Studio would not let me reference them with the same name.  Then I tried creating the assemblies with the same name and then renaming the file name.  I was allowed to add them as references, but ended up with the ambiguity of class names other questions have mentioned.</p>

<p>Next I tried using the extern alias keyword, but ended up with the same type casting problem.</p>

<p>There must be a simple answer to this problem!  It sure would be nice if ""virtual"" in a property meant you could override the type, but alas, that is not the case.</p>

<p>I guess I may just need to compile two versions of my application, with the different references, but that solution is less than desirable.</p>

<p>Now, I'd like to be able to use the query language features for my chart and something I could not figure out is how exactly the query language works.
Let's take the table below as example:</p>

<pre><code>Name     | Age | Phone
-------------------------------
John     |  23 | 12341234
Chris    |  47 | 54223452
Sam      |  36 | 69694356
</code></pre>

<p>When called, my datasource will return a JSON representation of the entire table above.
In theory, I should be able to do something like this from my Javascript</p>

<p>query.setQuery('select Name, Age'); </p>

<p>So, the result would ignore the column ""Phone"".</p>

<p>Now, my question is:</p>

<p>Is the setQuery() method applied to the JSON response only, or my datasource should be able to handle the query on request and return the correct data (only Name and Age columns). I'm not sure if the query language will act on the JSON response or if it's just an interface to tell the server what to do and the server should be able to prepare the correct data.</p>

<p>I'm asking that because as I said, my JSON response works fine, however the setQuery() method is being ignored. My table always shows the entire Dataset, no matter what I put on the setQuery method. Even if I define a column which does not exist, it does not cause any error.
I did some tests using a google spreadsheet and it works just fine. I should add that the structure of the JSON response from my app and the one from the google spreadsheet looks exactly the same.
Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<pre><code>Worker.UserRepository.Update(user);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what is going on. I don't want to break my generic repository/unit of work pattern just to update many-to-many relationships. </p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I've got this working...but it is extremely different from the pattern that I'm going for. Having hard implementations means I will need to create a method for each type that has a many to many relationship. I am investigating now to see if I can make this a generic method.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> So the previous implementation I had did not work like I thought it would. But now, I have a slightly working implementation. If someone would please help me so I can move on from this, I will love you forever.</p>

<pre><code>public virtual void Update(TEntity updated,
    IEnumerable&lt;object&gt; set,
    string navigationProperty,
    Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; filter,
    Type propertyType)
{
    // Find the existing item
    var existing = Context.Set&lt;TEntity&gt;().Include(navigationProperty).FirstOrDefault(filter);

    // Iterate through every item in the many-to-many relationship
    foreach (var o in set)
    {
        // Attach it if its unattached
        if (Context.Entry(o).State == EntityState.Detached)
            // Exception ""an object with the same key already exists""
            // This is due to the include statement up above. That statement
            // is necessary in order to edit the entity's navigation
            // property.
            Context.Set(propertyType).Attach(o);
    }

    // Set the new value on the navigation property.
    Context.Entry(existing).Collection(navigationProperty).CurrentValue = set;

    // Set new primitive property values.
    Context.Entry(existing).CurrentValues.SetValues(updated);
    Context.Entry(existing).State = EntityState.Modified;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Worker.UserRepository.Update(user, user.BusinessModels, ""BusinessModels"", i =&gt; i.UserId == user.UserId, typeof (BusinessModel));
</code></pre>

<p>Extremely messy, but it lets me update many-to-many relationships with generics. My big problem is the exception when I go to attach new values that already exist. They're already loaded because of the include statement.</p>

The gallery has a ItemsControl.ItemsSource which the XAML is populating with two Array items, these array items are a custom type which has a bitmap property and a ICommand property.  Everything looks fine but I cannot get the array item property to bind to anything to do with the window's data context.  I have tried every trick i know, RelativeSource, ElementName but to no avail. Below is the XAML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ribbon:RibbonGallery.ItemsSource&gt;
    &lt;x:Array Type=""{x:Type customUITypes:ClickableImage}""&gt;
        &lt;customUITypes:ClickableImage   x:Name=""BitmapAddWorkflow"" Command=""{Binding ElementName=MainView, Path=DataContext.MyCommandOne}""&gt;
            &lt;customUITypes:ClickableImage.Bitmap&gt;
                &lt;BitmapImage UriSource=""/Images/GalleryWorkflowAdd.png""/&gt;
            &lt;/customUITypes:ClickableImage.Bitmap&gt;
        &lt;/customUITypes:ClickableImage&gt;
        &lt;customUITypes:ClickableImage  x:Name=""BitmapDeleteWorkflow"" Command=""{Binding ElementName=MainView, Path=DataContext.MyCommandTwo}""&gt;
            &lt;customUITypes:ClickableImage.Bitmap&gt;
                &lt;BitmapImage UriSource=""/Images/GalleryWorkflowDelete.png""/&gt;
            &lt;/customUITypes:ClickableImage.Bitmap&gt;
        &lt;/customUITypes:ClickableImage&gt;                                        
    &lt;/x:Array&gt;
&lt;/ribbon:RibbonGallery.ItemsSource&gt;
&lt;ribbon:RibbonGallery.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
        &lt;Button Command=""{Binding Command}""&gt;
           &lt;Image Margin=""2"" Source=""{Binding Bitmap}"" Stretch=""None""/&gt;
        &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
&lt;/ribbon:RibbonGallery.ItemTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note : MainView is the name of the window, the data context is 100% what I want, I have no problems with any other bindings on this view, just within this array definition.</p>

<p>I guess I'm getting in a muddle with regards to the hierarchy of the objects i have access to but in my opinion regardless of whether I'm binding inside the array definition markup i should still be able to find an element and bind to it's data context.  Sometimes XAML seems to have inconsitency gotchas which creates hours of head scratching, just for something simple.  I realise I could hard code some of this in my View Model, i.e. create my array items in the code and bind to that but I want to avoid doing that as it would mean having image paths hardcoded in code, i feel paths to images are a markup declaration.</p>

<p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>

Ok, so it looks like boost::this_thread::sleep acquires a mutex in the behind-scenes, so I guess I'll stick with plain old sleep() which is plain old good for me.
[/LATER EDIT]</p>

<p>From main() I issue a t1 thread which counts 2 seconds and another thread which does the following: fork()'s inside it, the parent waits for the child and the child creates another thread which also counts 2 seconds. </p>

<p>The problem is that if I use boost::this_thread:sleep the program hangs or deadlocks somehow. If I use sleep(), then it works ok. Am I doing something wrong here? What is the difference between these two ?</p>

<p>From the man-page of sleep I get that: </p>

<p>""sleep() makes the calling thread sleep until seconds seconds have elapsed or a signal arrives which is not ignored.
""</p>

<p>Also from the boost docs, boost::this_thread::sleep seems to do the same thing.</p>

<p>I am wondering is there a simple way to block automatic content crawler on a shared web host (LAMP, no root access).</p>

<p>For example. I have a large collection of jpg images, and someone decided to make a automatic program (php or others) to download all my image data.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using javascript to decrypt the image at client-side, thus make it more difficult or more effort to collect all the data by the crawler. But I am not sure the impact on browsers without javascript support, and the effectiveness on preventing such crawler.</p>

<p>Of course, good search engine crawler should be allowed.</p>

It draws them based on the idea that the first coord is (x1,y1) and the second is (x2,y2). When drawing on a canvas at 100% zoom, everything works as expected. But when I zoom (via CSS) to, say, 80%, the app gets the coords of the mouse position as actual screen pixels from the (0,0) canvas point. It draws them on the scaled canvas with these points, but scaled to the ratio. This makes all the rectangles draw at the wrong coords. </p>

<p>This is confusing to explain, so here's a quick video of me drawing a rectangle on a canvas scaled to 80%.

You can see why this doesn't work. Basically there has to be a formula so it can take the scaled coords and multiply them by some number based on the scale (0-100%) to get what the actual screen coords would be at that zoom.</p>

<p>I noticed that my database has increased to 8GB, and it is getting slower to load a page.</p>

<p>I am thinking of storing the news in a file and then saving the path in database. </p>

<p>Is there anyway I can convert the form value representing ""[Description]"" into a file and then store the path to my database?</p>

1) I use Visual Studio 2008 (C#)</p>

<p>2) I want my desktop application to ""remember"" certain settings (preferences) for every user individually.</p>

<p>3) The application would use its own database of users (logins + passwords), so they have nothing to do with Windows accounts.</p>

<p>How can I accomplish that? Trying to find an answer</p>

<p>4) I've found the ""Using Alternate Sets of Settings"" subject on MSDN => <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730869%28VS.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730869%28VS.80%29.aspx</a> - but</p>

<p>5) it suggests that even these alternative settings need to be added in design time. That's a bit of a problem, because:</p>

<p>6) I don't know in advance, how many users would be in the database - and I want the ""main user"" (admin) to have an option of adding more accounts any time he wants.</p>

<p>So 
7) how do I accomplish that?</p>

<p>So far I thought about:
8) using isolated storage files? (but they, too, are user-scoped in the sense of referring to Windows accounts)</p>

<p>9) deriving my own class from ApplicationSettingsBase class and supplying it with a SaveAs() method (which it lacks by default)?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Problem solved trought dicusion and googling <br/></strong>
so I'm adding changes it may help somebody with similar problem. <br/>
There were couple problems in Server:
instead of<br/></p>

<pre><code>int server_len, client_len;
</code></pre>

<p>I should use 
    <code>socklen_t str_len, client_len;</code>
<br/>
Then instead of this (which was the cause of segmentation fault):
 printf( ""Connected client from %s\n"", inet_ntoa( client_address.sin_addr) );
I should use function inet_ntop cause I found that inet_ntoa deprecated.
Cause of seg fault was that I use %s so as arg of printf is expected char *
this is the better solution and I hope also clear.</p>

<pre><code>char str[INET_ADDRSTRLEN];
inet_ntop(AF_INET,&amp;(client_address.sin_addr), str, INET_ADDRSTRLEN);
printf( ""Connected client from %s\n"", str );
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't know what with this question, cause I get good answers trouht comments and my work.
So I at least added fixes needed to solve problem. <br/></p>

<p>I am trying to filter out one matrix M using a second matrix N.</p>

<p>M = AxBxCxD where A,B,C,D are on the order of ~150 each
N = AxBxC. Same A,B,C above. Its entries are binary. </p>

<p>I wish to filter matrix M so it only contains data where entries in the N matrix are 1. Additionally, I want it to be a two dimensional array SxD where S is the number of elements that are 1 in N</p>

<p>I have tried two methods so far, both which are either too memory intensive or slow:</p>

<p>1)</p>

<pre><code>indx = find(N(:));
[X,Y,Z] = ind2sub(size(M),indx);
result = squeeze(M(X,Y,Z,:));
</code></pre>

<p>In the third time, the result of M(X,Y,Z,:) is way to big to hold in memory.</p>

<p>2) </p>

<pre><code>l = logical(N) ;
map = repmat(l,'length of D dimension');
M(map);
%Reduce dimension next
</code></pre>

<p>But the computation time to build repmat(l,280) is considerable. </p>

<p>Are there any more efficient ways to computer this result. Perhaps apply the mask to each row along the D dimension in M  (I looked into this but wasn't able to figure anything out).</p>

<p>This is the hierarchy of the views and controllers:</p>

<ul>
<li>MainViewController (extends UITabBarController just to override shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:)
<ul>
<li>Three extended UITableViewControllers as tabs (also those have the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation correctly setted up).</li>

<p>If I kinda force the orientation of the device to Landscape with:</p>

<p>[[UIDevice currentDevice] setOrientation: UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight];</p>

<p>Then for an instant the Simulator flashes in portrait mode, and then it goes landscaped. The problem is that in this way, the auto-rotation animations gets started, which is something I cannot tollerate. I just want a fixed, landscaped application.</p>

<p>What i want is simple. I want to prevent my website to be called from domains I did not approve.
Let's say only a.com and b.com can have a page with an iframe calling my webapplication wwww.mydomain.com/myapp.php. How can I accomplish this?</p>

<p>1st I was thinking about my web appplication checking the domain of the iframe's parent. Maybe that is possible, but certainly not easy, because of cross-domain restrictions.</p>

<p>2nd I was thinking of having the requesting page on a.com and b.com execute a small PHP-script first which writes some info to a file or my database, so I know the requesting page is on one of the approved domains. The question is how to call and when to execute the script?  </p>

<p>Is placing a script tag or image tag with a src attribute a good idea? That looks like a fairly simple solution to me and no PHP is required. The requesting page can be pure HTML.</p>

<p>Should it look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""http://wwww.mydomain.com/myapp.php"" style=""width: 0px; height: 0px;"" alt=""Not an image""  title=""Not an image""/&gt;

<p>For example, I've created a custom ""Review"" action. It hasn't been approved yet, so it only works for my developer/test accounts. </p>

<p>I want a user to share this story on facebook:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fRn17.jpg"" alt=""request to share buttons""></p>

<p>If yes is clicked, <code>FB.ui(method: 'share_open_graph', ... )</code> is called, which brings up this dialog:</p>

<p>Is this alone not an acceptable case for using/approving a custom story?</p>

<p>When I attempt to submit my action for review, I'm forced to declare that my app uses facebook login. I have no need to call <code>FB.login()</code> anywhere. So does the above process implicitly constitute as facebook login? If not, why do I need to shoehorn facebook login into my app, when this is all I want to accomplish?</p>

                string r = HttpGet(""http://www.example.com/some.php?Username= Z&amp;Status=On"");
            }, 10000);
        }
        catch (WebException) { MessageBox.Show(""No Network!""); }
</code></pre>

<p>What the Setinterval() does in retry run the code every 10000 milliseconds. 
But If I am not connected to internet, it gives me a WebException error. But it seems I can't even handle it. catching the exception still gives me the same error. Is there any way to just say 'Do nothing' when the error occurs?</p>

<p>P.S I am new to C#. </p>

<p>EDIT:
Here's the code for setinterval:</p>

<pre><code>public static IDisposable SetInterval(Action method, int delayInMilliseconds)
    {
        System.Timers.Timer timer = new System.Timers.Timer(delayInMilliseconds);
        timer.Elapsed += (source, e) =&gt;
        {
            method();
        };

        timer.Enabled = true;
        timer.Start();

        // Returns a stop handle which can be used for stopping
        // the timer, if required
        return timer as IDisposable;
    }

<p>What I read:
 - My request is processed by Spring dispatcher servlet
 - the request is mapped to ResourceHttpRequestHandler
 - ResourceHttpRequestHandler finds the matching resource in my files
 - it determines the good media type ""application/javascript""
 - a NullPointerException is thrown when the Response is being written.</p>

<p>I had a look to the <a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repository.springsource.com/org.apache.coyote/com.springsource.org.apache.coyote/7.0.25/org/apache/coyote/Response.java?av=f#428"" rel=""nofollow"">Response.setContentType() method</a> and found nothing worth a NullPointerException.</p>

Is there an easy way to do this?</p>

<p>What I mean is, for an HTML5 Canvas document</p>

<pre><code>console.log( this.myItemInstanceName.name )

<p>I do a lot of aircraft panels, which generally consist of a panel with a bunch of controls of type switch, dial or btn. I've got a function library that allows me to do the behavior of each control and then it calls a panelUpdates function with a switch statement based on the control name. This lets me do things like light a lamp on the panel wihen a switch is turned on.</p>

<p>I can easily set up the controls, but I can't see a way to hook up to the panelUpdates function the way I'd like because of this silliness with names. Anyone got a good method for populating the proper instance names in or know when Adobe will add it to a Flash CC update?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Eric.</p>

<pre><code>var myPanel = this;

myPanel.mcLightSwitch.btnUp.addEventListener( ""click"", switchUp.bind( this ) ); // as per code snippets
myPanel.mcLightSwitch.btnDn.addEventListener( ""click"", switchDn.bind( this ) ); // as per code snippets

function switchUp( e ) {

     thisControl.gotoAndStop(""btnUp"");

I need some way to aggregate each level (stages/sub-stages), to see how much it costs, but to do it at a minimum performance cost.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, I will use the following data structure:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE stage
(
    id int not null,
    fk_parent int
)

CREATE TABLE task
(
    id int not null,
    fk_stage int not null,
    cost decimal(18,2) not null default 0
)
</code></pre>

<p>with the following data:</p>

<pre><code>==stage==
id  fk_parent
1   null
2   1
3   1

==task==
id  fk_stage  cost
1   2         100
1   2         200
1   3         600
</code></pre>

<p>I want to obtain a table containing the total costs on each branch. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Stage ID      Total Cost
1             900
2             300
3             600
</code></pre>

<p>But, I also want it to be productive. I don't want to end up with extremely bad solutions like <a href=""http://bosker.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/the-worst-algorithm-in-the-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">The worst algorithm in the world</a>. I mean this is the case. In case I'll request the data for all the items in the <code>stage</code> table, with the total costs, each total cost will be evaluated <code>D</code> times, where <code>D</code> is the depth in the tree (level) at which it is situated. I am afraid I'll hit extremely low performances at large amounts of data with a lot of levels.</p>

<p>SO,</p>

<p>I decided to do something which made me ask this question here.<br>
I decided to add 2 more columns to the <code>stage</code> table, for caching.</p>

<pre><code>...
calculated_cost decimal(18,2),
date_calculated_cost datetime
...
</code></pre>

<p>So what I wanted to do is pass another variable within the code, a <code>datetime</code> value which equals to the time when this process was started (pretty much unique). That way, if the <code>stage</code> row already has a <code>date_calculated_cost</code> which equals to the one I'm carrying, I don't bother calculating it again, and just return the <code>calculated_cost</code> value.</p>

<p>I couldn't do it with Functions (updates are needed to the <code>stage</code> table, once costs are calculated)<br>
I couldn't do it with Procedures (recursion within running cursors is a no-go)<br>
I am not sure temporary tables are suitable because it wouldn't allow concurrent requests to the same procedure (which are least likely, but anyway I want to do it the right way)<br>
I couldn't figure out other ways.</p>

<p>I am not expecting a definite answer to my question, but I will reward any good idea, and the best will be chosen as the answer.</p>

<p>Imagine an application with 2 forms, Form1 and Form2. When I click on a button in Form1 i want to open Form2 and close Form1, close not hide.
The way I was doing it was:</p>

<pre><code>_Form2 = new Form2();
_Form2.Show();
 this.Close();//or this.Dispose();
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the code it closes the form1 and ends the application. Im not sure but it maybe because in my Program.cs I have <code>Application.Run(new Form1());</code>? Or this line only means that when the Application start it should load the Form1?</p>

<p>So far, I haven't really been able to find anything that does this, other than <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370802(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Core Audio APIs</a>, and even then it seems better built for simply locating sound files and encoding/unencoding then. </p>

<p>I've also taken a look at <a href=""http://naudio.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">NAudio,</a> however this seems better suited, again, for sound files. The one bit of streaming it is able to do, is only uses a URL as the source. </p>

<p>Can anyone point me to a library or interface within the .Net framework that will allow me to simply connect to my computer's audio out function and collect a stream of data?</p>

"14057567","1","","","2012-12-27 16:06:04","","2","326","<p>I've created a simple animation with raphaeljs. You can take a look at it here:
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/fJt96/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/fJt96/</a></p>

<p>It generates random fractal plants and blends between them. It will take about 8 seconds before the second plant is shown and then about 4 seconds for each refresh depending on the plants complexity. The rules for creating one of the drawings are explained in the description of this sample (not made by me)
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fractal-plant.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fractal-plant.svg</a></p>

<p>In my code the functions <code>applyRules</code> and <code>draw</code> are more or less direct translations from the description to javascript.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there's a memory leak in my script and I can't figure out where. The only variables that are persistent are the RaphaelPaper and two RaphaelSets as well as one boolean toggle. Each set holds one fractal plant and the toggle stores which set is currently shown and which can be redrawn. The rest of the program relies on local variables but still somewhere there's a memory leak.</p>

<p>I have two ideas</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I am removing the elements from a set as it is redrawn. Is it sufficient to call Element.remove for each Element of the set?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there maybe a memory leak in Raphael? I don't want to appear rude - the inventor of Raphael is certainly an ingenious mastermind but I can't find the problem in my code. Maybe there is some known issue ?</p></li>

here's the code</p>

<p>I guess the usage of List and Entry will be slightly confusing. I created this with Typescript and wrote a custom List implementation. Here's some Typescript</p>

<pre><code>class Entry { public X: number; public Y: number; public Rot: number;}

}
catch(\LengthException $ex) {

<p>That is what I want but when that comes back to the service layer and then to the controller and I catch it I know that a <code>LengthException</code> was thrown but I can't give the user a proper message like ""The supplied last name was too short"" because I do not know for which field the exception was thrown, just the type of exception.</p>

<p>Im looking for the fastest way to get special path strings, because this stuff is happening on a 200ms animation of a panel element these times are critical to me.</p>

<p>Heres some speed analysis:</p>

<p>Inside the empprint function i call a bfs print function, which calls itself recursively till its done printing everything that needs to be printed, after which its supposed to return me back to empprint function. But the return statement in bfsprint doesn't take me back to empprint. </p>

<p>One possible reason I can think of is that bfsprint calls itself recursively so it will only return to the last bfsprint method that called it instead of empprint function but it doesnt seem to solve my problem. I m stuck up with a code whose execution doesnt terminate.</p>

    //do something

    // lot of code to implement breadth-first search. No issue

    if(c.getHead()==NULL) cout&lt;&lt;""1"" //this does print 1 to output

<p>Say I have this design (in an iOS project using CoreData):</p>

<p><strong>Class A</strong><br>
- name: NSString<br>
- children: NSSet of Class A objects<br>
- parent: Class A object</p>

<p>so it's a simple parent/child setup. This is all fine.</p>

<p>Now, I want to make it so that if a Class A object doesn't define a value for 'name', its parents are searched until one is found that does define 'name' and this value is returned.</p>

<p>This is a tricky thing to do, because my natural reaction was to override the getter for name like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)name
{
  return name =! nil ? name : self.parent.name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this doesn't work because 'name' has to be accessed via self.name because this is a CoreData entity.</p>

<p>Then I had the idea of making a new method called nameRecursive which works like:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)nameRecursive
{
  return self.name =! nil ? self.name : self.parent.name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this feels very clunky and not very elegant (as the real life version of Class A has many properties which need to work like this), but I haven't been able to think up anything nicer.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on a) whether or not this is a stupid design or b) how I might solve it in an elegant way.</p>

<p>Any ideas or thoughts would be brilliant. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I have a column of cells (>3000 rows), with either a value of 1 or 0 (call this column A). The value will depend on the value in column B (which will contain either a value or nothing). The values in column B are a SUMIFS function based, summing from column C, and based on months in column D. </p>

<p>The values in B are paid out on the first business day of the next month. So, the SUMIFS function will calculate the dates that match the last month. This works well in theory, however, not every first business day is the first day of the month. This leads the SUMIFS function to not include everything in the correct month, and allows for some discrepancy, which, when you are dealing with people's money is not great. Further, this discrepancy is compounded across multiple periods (in some cases, there are over 100 periods, and a discrepancy of $1 in period 1 amounts to nearly $1000 in period 100)</p>

<p>What I am wondering is:</p>

<p>Is there any way that I can tell the SUMIFS function (column B) to stop when the value in column A is 0? This would tell the SUM function start the summing from the current value in column B and continue the function to the cell below the preceding value in column B.</p>

<p>I've seen suggestions that the MATCH function may work, but I can't see how to do this with either COUNT or SUM.</p>

<p>For security reasons, this solution needs to be entered into the cell, and can't be VBA. Also, it can't be too large, as it will need to be replicated across 200 worksheets in the workbook (not my file originally, and I would have done it differently, but that is another story). There is no problem entering another column or two if that is required.</p>

<p>Any help is gratefully appreciated.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't post an image of the screenshot. I've included a similar screenshot (columns are not the same layout, but hopefully it gives the idea) here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/ij35zwmawshlv7t/mil.jpg?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">Rates calculations</a></p>

<p>The SUMIF formula is (for B2)</p>

<p>=SUMIFS(C2:C35,D2:D35,D2-1,A2:A35,1)</p>

<p>This works fine if I want all the values in the month, irrelevant of when the payment was made.</p>

<p>However, what I need the formula to do is:</p>

<p>SUM (C2:C35,D2:D35,D2-1, but stop when the first 0 is encountered in A2:A35)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"15524511","1","","","2013-03-20 13:10:34","","0","307","<p>Background:</p>

<p>For my Windows Phone application, I have created a UserControl called CharacterPresenter (let's call it CP, for short). This is a small rectangle with a Border control which I can toggle between PhoneAccentBrush and Transparent so the user can see when it is selected.</p>

<p>I have created a second UserControl called MultiCharacterPresenter (MCP). This contains a horizontally-oriented StackPanel to display multiple CP controls on a single line. This too has a Border control so the user can see when the whole line is selected.</p>

<p>Note that only one *Presenter can be selected at any time and all BorderThickness=""6"".</p>

<p>Requirement:</p>

<p>I can't have a 12px. gap (caused by the Transparent Borders) between each CP so I set the Border Margin=""-6,-6,-6,-6"". This puts the Border outside the rectangle bounding the CP UserControl and allows the CP controls to form one continuous line inside the MCP.</p>

<p>So then, when a CP is selected, the Border overlaps the neighbouring CP controls. That's fine since the selected CP has the user's focus so it's OK that other CP controls may be partially obscured.</p>

<p>Problem:</p>

<p>The issue is that the right-side of the Border of each CP is <strong>underneath</strong> the next CP on the right. Only the right-most CP shows a complete border. I want the whole Border to show when a CP is selected but it is partially hidden.</p>

<p>Non-solution:</p>

<p>I tried setting the Canvas.ZIndex of all the Border controls to 1 (while the default for all other content is zero) which should put the Border controls on top of everything else... but that didn't work. I'm not sure why.</p>

<p>If it makes a difference, I'm adding the CP controls one-by-one to the MCP in code, based on the data. So perhaps the ZIndex only works when all the controls are rendered at the same time, e.g. if they are already present in the XAML (not added programmatically).</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Memory and Hook are both non-static classes, and openprocess and Apply are both static methods within those classes.</p>

<p>However, the problem is, for each instance of my Memory or Hook, I want to have a different process opened, and a different Hook applied.</p>

<p>What I want to do is:</p>

<pre><code>Memory newMemory = new Memory();
newMemory.OpenProcess(processes[1].Id);

Hook newHook = new Hook();
newHook.Apply(....);

<p>But of course I cannot do this because the methods are static and not particular to each instance.</p>

<p>I cannot change the static methods because these methods are coming from a dll in which I do not have access to the source code.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Currently I can confirm that no packets are being generated from the system to the remote syslog server via wireshark.  I can telnet to the remote syslog server on port 514 and write messages without an issue.  I can assume that something isn't right with my XML, but I have no messages to tell me what the error is.</p>

<p>Here's the Appender:</p>

    &lt;layout class=""org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout""&gt;
        &lt;param name=""ConversionPattern"" value=""[%d{yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}][%5p](%t) %m%n"" /&gt;
    &lt;/layout&gt;
&lt;/appender&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried the Log4j 2 syntax</p>

<pre><code>&lt;appender name=""syslog"" class=""org.apache.log4j.net.SyslogAppender""&gt;
    &lt;param name=""format"" value=""bsd"" /&gt;
    &lt;param name=""host"" value=""172.16.81.39"" /&gt;

    &lt;/layout&gt;
&lt;/appender&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the corresponding Logger:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;logger name=""printing.com.application"" additivity=""false""&gt;
    &lt;level value=""INFO"" /&gt;
    &lt;appender-ref ref=""SYSLOG"" /&gt;
&lt;/logger&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I change the <code>&lt;appender-ref /&gt;</code> to the default PRINTING_MONTHLY_ROLL then it will print to the log file.  </p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Still stumped but I'll add some more info on my problem</p>

<p>1: If I rename the default <code>PRINTING_MONTHLY_ROLL</code> to <code>SYSLOG</code> then the messages are correctly output to the log file</p>

<p>2: If I give the logger a bogus name then I see log4j init error messages in the system log</p>

<p>3: If I give the syslog appender an incorrect host parameter, it will give me an error that the host could not be found and that logging will fail.  Since I do not get this message after saving the config listed in my original question, I can only assume that there are no errors with the syntax.  </p>

<p>4: Firewalls on either side are not an issue.  I can make a connection with telnet and I confirmed that port TCP:514 is allowed on both sides in the proper direction.</p>

I can successfully write and read to/from yml/xml files.
This only works when writing and reading functions are in the same program though.</p>

<p>When I create and write a yml file successfully in one program and tried to access that file from another program, I'm having the following problem.</p>

<p>Writing part:</p>

<pre><code>d_img = imread(filename, 1);
FileStorage fs_source(""tmp.yaml"", FileStorage::WRITE);
if (fs_source.isOpened()){
  fs_source &lt;&lt; ""source"" &lt;&lt; d_img;
  fs_source.releaseAndGetString();
  cout&lt;&lt;""Source : image written to temporary file""&lt;&lt;endl;
}
else
{
  fs_source.open(""tmp.yaml"", FileStorage::WRITE);
  fs_source &lt;&lt; ""source"" &lt;&lt; d_img;
  fs_source.releaseAndGetString();
  cout&lt;&lt;""Source : image written to temporary file 2""&lt;&lt;endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Reading part:</p>

<pre><code>FileStorage fs_sink(""tmp.yaml"", FileStorage::READ);
if (fs_sink.isOpened()){
  fs_sink[""source""] &gt;&gt; d_img;
  fs_sink.releaseAndGetString();
  cout&lt;&lt;""Sink : image read from file 1""&lt;&lt;endl;
}
else
{
  fs_sink.open(""tmp.yaml"", FileStorage::READ);
  fs_sink[""source""] &gt;&gt; d_img;
  fs_sink.releaseAndGetString();
  cout&lt;&lt;""Sink : image read from file 2""&lt;&lt;endl;
}

imwrite( ""output.jpg"", d_img );
</code></pre>

<p>First code creates the yml file without any problem.
But the second code throws the following error when it comes to the first line here which is <code>FileStorage fs_sink(""tmp.yaml"", FileStorage::READ);</code></p>

<pre><code>OpenCV Error: Parsing error (tmp.yaml(0): Valid XML should start with '&lt;?xml ...?&gt;') in icvXMLParse, file /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/opencv-2.4.7/work/opencv-2.4.7/modules/core/src/persistence.cpp, line 2257

</code></pre>

<p>This is odd because the file is yml, not an xml. It still gives the same error when I change the file type to xml.</p>

<p>What could cause this error?</p>

<p>PS: Both <code>releaseAndGetString();</code> and <code>release();</code> methods are tried to close the file. Same results.
<code>xml</code>, <code>yml</code>, and <code>yaml</code> extensions are all tried too.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm expecting there might be a valid reason I'm experiencing a failure in using $injector.invoke when calling it from a function defined for a route's templateUrl, but it would be good to get confirmation of that. If this should work, that'd be good to know also. :)</p>

<p>The failure is demonstrated in <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/HwXpe2US5WUhJo2xv7XW"" rel=""nofollow"">this plnkr</a>. The sample has two uses of $injector.invoke. There are two clickable divs in the sample to trigger each use:
one triggers a call from a controller that works just fine
the other is a call from the route's templateUrl function which fails.</p>

<p>The JavaScript there is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function MyCtrl($location, $injector) {
  this.tryInjectorInvoke = function() {
    // This works
    $injector.invoke(function($rootScope) {
      alert('Have $rootScope? ' + !!$rootScope);
    });
  };
  // This is used to trigger a route change to the failing case.
  this.navTo = function(dest) {
    $location.path(dest);
  };
}

function configRoutes($routeProvider, $injector) {
  $routeProvider.when('/fails', {
    controller: 'MyCtrl',
    controllerAs: 'ctrl',
    templateUrl: function() {
      try {
        // This fails horribly.
        $injector.invoke(function($rootScope) {
          return 'fails.html'
        });
      } catch (err) {
        alert('$injector.invoke failed!\n\n' + err);
      }
    }
  }).otherwise({
    controller: 'MyCtrl',
    controllerAs: 'ctrl',
    templateUrl: 'works.html'
  });

Then the client communicates with this <code>Thread</code> using <code>ObjectInputStream</code> and <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>. In this communication the client can start a new game or choose existing game to join. If a client joins existing game, server starts a new <code>Thread</code> with the game instance and this game instance should start its own communication with clients. I pass the <code>Sockets</code> to this game instance but when I try to send some message to clients, only one of them recieves it correctly. The second client throws an exception <code>java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header: 79ACED00</code>.
I use the same method to send the message, so I have no idea, why it works for one client and why it does not work for the second client.</p>

<p>Here is the code where the game instance is created:</p>

<pre><code>GameInstanceDescription joined_game = (GameInstanceDescription) response;
joined_game.setSocket_challenger(socket_from_client);
joined_game.setChallenger(rcvd_msg.getChallenger());
joined_game.setSocket_promoter(game_server.getPromotersSocket(joined_game.getName()));
game_server.startNewGame(joined_game);
</code></pre>

<p>After the last line that <code>Thread</code> should end.</p>

<p>Here is the server method:</p>

<pre><code>public void startNewGame (GameInstanceDescription desc)
{
    Thread t = new Thread(new MainGame(desc));
    t.start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the method used to send message from the game instance to the client:</p>

<pre><code>public void sendMessageToClient(ServerToClientMessage message, ObjectOutputStream stream)
{
    try {
        stream.writeObject(message);
        stream.flush();
        stream.reset();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the clients code which should read the message from the server, but it works only for one client and also the exception is thrown here:</p>

<pre><code>input = new ObjectInputStream(client.getInputStream());
Object o = input.readObject();
</code></pre>

<p>I didn´t find anything useful on the internet what would solve this, so could you please tell me what is wrong? 
Thanks in advance.</p>

I have only become familiar with the concept of the JFileChooser and have implemented it into my code. My hope is to be able to use a JFileChooser to open a text file and append the contents of the text file to the JTextArea. To try my best at seperating my functionality i implemented the MVC (model view controller) so i have 3 classes. the view is called WordFrame.java, the model is called DataStuff.java and the controller is called ProcessEvents.java. My issue is rather simple, i can print the contents of a text file to the console, but attempts to append the said contents to the TextArea is only resulting in white space, the image below shows the position on the textArea, signifying its character spacing, this is after the file is loaded. As stated the console prints it out perfectly.</p>

    }
    catch (TransformerException e) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see xslt is loaded from resources. The function together with the transformation files i need are bundled in a library and this works as long as the library is stand alone from a main method or so. 
However if this library is bundled with a webapplication and deployed in Jetty/Tomcat it gets a bit complicated. As long as the transformation files in it self do not reference any other files from resources there is no problem but with files like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;

  &lt;xsl:import href=""import_file1.xsl"" /&gt;
  &lt;xsl:import href=""import_file2.xsl"" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name=""aTtemplate""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:for-each select=""document('import_file3.xml')""&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The imports cannot be resolved and the document from the for each loop cannot be found. In Tomcat a workaround is to put the files inside the $TOMCAT/bin directory but that is not a suitable solution for us. Is there any method to get this resources recursively out of the lib?</p>

<p>I've started to commit some of the in-file navigation to memory but I'm struggling with navigating between multiple files. </p>

<p>In my workflow it is pretty common that I'm flipping between a handful of files pretty regularly (enough files such that split-pane windows become too small).</p>

<p>I'm currently using NERDTree but find drilling down into directories cumbersome as well as constantly using <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd>/<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>l</kbd> to hop back and forth. </p>

<p>I think I would do better with tabs I can easily toggle between but maybe I need to use a different workflow.</p>

<p>I'd also like a ""Go to File..."" shortcut like <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> in TextMate. I've found <a href=""http://github.com/jamis/fuzzy_file_finder""><code>fuzzy_file_finder</code></a> but it requires vim to be built with Ruby bindings which isn't the case the native installs I've worked on. </p>

<p>While I <em>could</em> rebuild the main reason I want to switch to vim is so I can have one editor environment that I know will easily work across any platform.</p>

<p>The options out there are overwhelming any ideas are much appreciated!</p>

<p>I'm wondering how to optimally design the URLs that point to these pages, so that users can't manually change the URL to change the displayed data.</p>

<p>This is a node.js + mongoDB project, with an MVC structure (actually via sails.js, even if it's probably not relevant here).</p>

<p>Let's say the pattern looks like <code>http://domain.com/xxxxxx</code></p>

<p>• <strong>Approach 1: encryption.</strong><br>
<code>xxxxxx</code> carries the six integers and a control key, encrypted via a simple library. The server decrypts the URL and serves the page and embedded data.</p>

<p>Pros: fast, smaller disk space since no need to maintain a database collection for this</p>

<p>• <strong>Approach 2: database.</strong><br>
I define a model to keep track of all data sets (the six integers) that are created by users.
In the URL, <code>xxxxxx</code> is the model's primary key. Data is retrieved from accessing the database.</p>

<p>Pros: analytics, ie: by enriching the model, it's possibile to track past usage and statistics</p>

<p>For now, I'm thinking that analytics are the only justification to Approach 2. If I don't need them, is there a risk to choosing Approach 1, and are the listed advantages meaningful?</p>

Now I've discovered that in a single test there seems to be some caching (my test class extends  extends <code>AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests</code>).</p>

<p>What I mean is the following.
My delete function:</p>

<p>does it exist?<br>
yes: delete it and return true<br>
no: return false.  </p>

<p>Now I try to do two asserts in my test function.<br>
the first is an assertTrue to check if it's actually deleted<br>
the second is an assertFalse to see that it correctly returns false.  </p>

<p>However my second test fails, and when I debug it it does indeed go to the true section.</p>

<p>However if I add the following line <code>getHibernateTemplate().find(""from classX"");</code>
as the first line in the delete function it works as intended. Even though I do nothing with the value. So a caching problem seems to be the most logical.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice, because leaving the line in there seems a bit dirty.</p>

"32226243","1","32228145","","2015-08-26 12:08:57","","1","39","<p>I found a strange behavior today.
I sent a message in google cloud messaging via the python requests lib.
Then I tried to decode the response to json like this:</p>

<pre><code>response = requests.post(Message_Broker.host, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
response_results = json.loads(response.content)[""results""]
</code></pre>

<p>This crashed with a decode error:</p>

<pre><code>response_results = json.loads(response.content)[""results""]
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/simplejson/__init__.py"", line 505, in loads
    return _default_decoder.decode(s)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/simplejson/decoder.py"", line 370, in decode
    obj, end = self.raw_decode(s)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/simplejson/decoder.py"", line 400, in raw_decode
    return self.scan_once(s, idx=_w(s, idx).end())
JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
</code></pre>

<p>This happened on my productive system, so I added some debug logging to get to know what the actual content of the response is like this:</p>

<pre><code>        logger.info(""GCM-Response: "" + str(response))
        logger.info(""GCM-Response: "" + response.content)
        logger.info(""GCM-Response: "" + str(response.headers))
</code></pre>

<p>Now the actual weird behavior occured. It got logged correctly and didn't throw the decoding error anymore.</p>

<p>Can someone explain me that behavior?</p>

<p>I have also checked what response.content actually is:</p>

<pre><code>@property
    def content(self):
        """"""Content of the response, in bytes.""""""

        if self._content is False:
            # Read the contents.
            try:
                if self._content_consumed:
                    raise RuntimeError(
                        'The content for this response was already consumed')

                if self.status_code == 0:
                    self._content = None
                else:
                    self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()

            except AttributeError:
                self._content = None

        self._content_consumed = True
        # don't need to release the connection; that's been handled by urllib3
        # since we exhausted the data.
        return self._content
</code></pre>

<p>It is part of the <code>requests</code> models. Not a actual property but made accessable via the <code>@property</code> decorator.
For my understanding, the first time the content is read for the logging, the <code>_content_consumed</code> flag is set to True. Therefore the second time, when I read it for the json decoding it should actually raise the Runtime Error.</p>

<p>Is there an explanation, which I just not found when browsing the requests docs?</p>

If you just derive from Shape and use a line geometry (in overridegeometry) and define two DPs for the start and end point, they will use the absolute coordinate system (the one of the containing panel) Why is this different?

<pre><code>private static void CheckValue&lt;T&gt;(ref Double result, Int64 value, String condition, T checkValue) where T : class{};

<p>The checkValue can be a Double or an Int64. However it gives the following error;</p>

<p>Because I want a generic function and do not want to define two functions (One with the Int64 checkValue and one with the Double checkValue signature), I came up with T.</p>

<p>I used the where T : class, this way it limits T to classes and can use operators. (Found this on the following topic):

<p>I can imagine that this works if I can restrain T to only Int64 or Double. However if I change the following in the signature:</p>

<pre><code>where T : class, Int64, Double

<p>It gives the same error.</p>

My bad, If I run the prior it gives an error about the Int64 and Double in the where clause. (It is not a valid constraint)</p>

The problem is that lines are often splited in two parts at each page break, producing an unreadable line.</p>

<p>I've read many articles on the web to find a solution. <code>page-break-*</code> don't work with Chrome. 
I've tried to deal with the <code>offset().top</code> feature to detect when a page break occurs (then we  could remove the last-line to begin a new table on the next page), but Chrome adds headers and footers to the print page: sizes are not relevant.</p>

<p>I don't find a solution, and this feature is primordial for me: I have to print a client list with ""name;firstname;comment""</p>

<p>So, my questions:
- Is there a way to set a tr height (wrapping the comment line if necessary)?
- Do you have a solution to print a listing (with dynamic line height if possible) ?</p>

I want to control the style of the TextBlock based on the state in which the app is in.
1. Snapped
2. Fullscreen. </p>

<p>The styles are loaded through StaticResources.</p>

<p>Here is the style, that I want to load in Snapped View</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style x:Key=""SnappedTextBlockStyle"" TargetType=""TextBlock""&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""Foreground""
            Value=""Blue"" /&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""FontSize""

    &lt;Setter Property=""FontWeight""
            Value=""ExtraBlack"" /&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the style, that I want to load in Fullscreen</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style x:Key=""FullscreenTextBlockStyle""
       TargetType=""TextBlock""&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""Foreground""
            Value=""Red"" /&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""FontSize""
            Value=""30"" /&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""FontWeight""
            Value=""Black"" /&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The way I assign the initial Style to the TextBlock is</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBlock Style=""{StaticResource FullscreenTextBlockStyle}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't want to modify the individual properties directly on the TextBlock elements.</p>

<p>One workaround I am aware of, is to use a boolean variable IsSnapped and load different styles using a converter.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBlock Style={Binding IsSnapped, Converter={StaticResource SnappedToStyleConverter}} /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I don't like the above approach. Because I feel it is a good idea to put all my code related to states in Visual states than handle it from different places.</p>

<p>I would be very glad if someone can point me in the right direction.
Thanks in Advance.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is a Server Side problem.  When I look at Chrome net-internals I see that processing a smaller JSON (length = 121664) makes a successful POST request and net-internals show HTTP_TRANSACTION_READ_RESPONSE_HEADERS but the large JSON (length = 7036490) give me --> net_error = -324 (ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE) instead of response headers.

<p>Only one file can be loaded at any one time, and when a new one is loaded I re-assign the new file to the existing file object, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>myBigFile = new BigFile(fileName);
</code></pre>

<p>I had always assumed the previous file would be cleared from memory, but I am finding that after loading several files one after the other I often get an Out Of Memory Exception.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to call <code>GC.Collect()</code> before assigning a new file to my file variable? I had assumed that Windows would clear the previous memory once it was no longer being used?</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>Further to some helpful comments, I went back and implemented IDisposable in the relevant classes and subclasses, using more or less the Microsoft template:</p>

<p>E.g, set arrays of classes to null, where each sub-type also has a Dispose() method:</p>

<pre><code>public void Dispose()
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; myArrayOfClassType.Length; i++)
    {
       myArrayOfClassType[i].Dispose();
    }

    myChannels = null;                

    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when about to load a new file I did the following:</p>

<pre><code>if (myBigFile != null)
{
    //dispose any previous instance:
    myBigFile.Dispose();
    myBigFile = null;
    GC.Collect();
}

myBigFile = new BigFile(fileName);
</code></pre>

<p>However then when loading the new file I would generally get an error, and arrays within the newly loaded file would turn out to be null, despite it just being loaded.</p>

<p>Is it possible that they are not being Disposed immediately and sometimes it is the new file which is present when the relevant clean-up occurs, and it is therefore being partly disposed straight away?</p>

<p>Any insights would be much appreciated.</p>

I've never seen a real-world example of this and would like to make one using <a href=""http://sqlfiddle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">SQLFiddle</a> but not sure on the SQL syntax to do so.</p>

<p>Let's say I have 3 tables: 1) <code>Users</code> 2) <code>Comments</code> 3) <code>Items</code>.
Let's also say that each item can be commented on by any user. So to get item=3's comments here's what the SQL <code>SELECT</code> would look like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * from comments join users on comments.commenter_id=users.user_id 
WHERE comments.item_id=3
</code></pre>

<p>I've heard that generally speaking if the number of rows gets large, i.e., many thousands/millions, one should put indices on the <code>WHERE</code> and the <code>JOIN</code>ed column. So in this case, <code>comments.item_id</code>, <code>comments.commenter_id</code>, and <code>users.user_id</code>.</p>

<p>I'd like to make a <a href=""http://sqlfiddle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">SQLFiddle</a> to compare having these tables indexed vs. not using many thousands, millions rows for each table. Might someone help with generating this SQLFiddle?</p>

<p>Here we see that the file <strong>lib/vboxconnector.php</strong> has 2807 additions and 2778 deletions. Additionally, from doing a manual git diff I find that indeed, the whole file is taken in as a deletion (marked with minus) and a whole new file is taken as an addition. However, the files have a lot in common which Git simply ignored.</p>

<p>I've looked at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12876350/diff-returning-entire-file-for-identical-files"">diff returning entire file for identical files</a> but it does not seem to be the case as no white space changes exist between the two commits.</p>

<p>Furthermore, taking the two commits of the file (the one in <code>626e09958384f479f94011ac3b8301bd497aec51</code> and <code>626e09958384f479f94011ac3b8301bd497aec51^1</code>) and diff'ing them using Meld, I get the right diff analysis.</p>

<p>The main code was a select box:</p>

All looks well, but only field ""transaction"" in Alerts entity is null(alert.getTransaction() returned null), but in my db its has value-""61"".</p>

<p>This is how transaction value presents im my Alerts class:</p>

@Entity(name = ""Alert"")
public class Alert extends AbstractBaseEntity {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 9007994864788693025L;

    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST})
    @JoinColumn(name = ""TRANSACTION_ID"")
    private Transaction transaction;
....
</code></pre>

<p>This is id field from Transaction entity:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity(name = ""Transaction"")
@Table(name = ""TRANS"", schema = ""REACTION"")
public class Transaction extends AbstractTransaction {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1110243741971153313L;

    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = ""TRANS_SEQ"")
    private Long id;

<p>I thought it was cause i had ""fetch = FetchType.LAZY"" on transaction field. But fetch = FetchType.EAGER didnt solve my problem. Maybe someone can help me?</p>

<p>Firstly, am I correct in believing that When using <code>TransactionManager</code>, all services which result in persistence to the database must be invoked from within a <code>@Transactional</code> method in order for the update to persist to the db?</p>

<p>Eg, Given the following class:</p>

<pre><code>class MyService
{
   CustomerImporter customerImporter
   CustomerDAO customerDAO

   {
       customerImporter.importCustomers(url);
   }
   return customerDAO.getFromURL(url);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>updateCustomer</code> is not <code>@Transactional</code>, will the method have any effect?</p>

<p>Furthermore, If on <code>CustomerImporter</code> the method <code>importCustomers()</code> is marked <code>@Transactional</code> but MyService is not, will the update be persisted to the database?</p>

<p>For the past month I've been working on a pet project console application, which has been performing well.  I'm now trying to take it another step further by adding a modern GUI to the project.</p>

<p>I'd like to emulate a console (just the basic outpu functionality) by using a WPF textblock wrapped inside a scroller in a WPF window.  You can <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=TKvSL9yvki4#!"" rel=""nofollow"">see the original console application  in action here</a> to get a better idea of the kind of console output I'm trying to emulate.  But I'm having a major problem with basic function calls, and I assume it's because I don't fully understand how WPF/C# work under the hood.</p>

<p>The Application starts in code via Main() like so:</p>

<pre><code> class Program
{
    public static ConsoleWindow MainConsole = new ConsoleWindow();

    [STAThread]
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Application MyApplication = new Application();
        MyApplication.Run(MainConsole);

        // The following code does not work, it produces no output in the Textblock
        MainConsole.WriteLine(""Crystal Console"");
        MainConsole.WriteLine(""Version: "" + Properties.Settings.Default.BuildVersion);
        MainConsole.WriteLine(""Current Time: "" + DateTime.Now);
        MainConsole.WriteLine(""Last Login: "" + Properties.Settings.Default.dateLastLogin);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the methods called don't seem to have any affect on the content of the textblock.</p>

<p>Although I'm about to give a lot of information just in case it's needed, the question itself is quite simple: <strong>Why does the Textblock update fine when taking content from a textbox control on the same window, but doesn't show any updates when the same method is called in Main() ?</strong></p>

<p>For testing purposes the window has a few Textboxes that call the .WriteLine method inside the window, and THAT works, so I know there isn't a problem with the .WriteLine code, which you can see here:</p>

<pre><code>public void WriteLine(string Message = null, string Sender = null)
    {
        _Console.AddElement(new ConsoleElement(Sender, Message + ""\n""));
        _Console.DisplayContent(ConsoleTextBlock);
        ConsoleScroller.ScrollToEnd();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code for the console itself in case it's needed, the class ""ConsoleElement"" is essentially just a object that contains the messages to be displayed in the Textblock as well as the formatting for each one.</p>

<pre><code>class ConsoleStream
{
    IList&lt;ConsoleElement&gt; ConsoleElements = new List&lt;ConsoleElement&gt;();

    public void AddElement(ConsoleElement NewElement)
    {
        if (NewElement.Sender == null)  // Sender is System not user.
        {
            NewElement.Content = ""     "" + NewElement.Content;
            NewElement.Font = new FontFamily(""Arial"");
            NewElement.FontSize = 12;
        }

<p>According to the K&amp;R, the mode of action for the conversion specification ""%c""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""The next input characters (default 1) are placed at the indicated spot. The normal skip over white space is suppressed; to read the next non-white space character, use %1s""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is, is that statement supposed to be read like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""The next input characters (default 1) are placed at the indicated spot. <strong>THEN, in successive calls to scanf in which %c is used again</strong>, the normal skip over white space is suppressed; to read the next non-white space character, use %1s""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...because this code:</p>

<pre><code>void test1()
{
   char t1, t2;

   scanf(""%c %c"", &amp;t1, &amp;t2);
   printf(""%d\n"", t1);
   printf(""%d\n"", t2);

   //INPUT is: ""b d"" (without quotes)
}
</code></pre>

<p>results in t1 = 98 (b) and t2 = 100 (d). (Whitespace skipped)</p>

<p>However, this code:</p>

<pre><code>void test2()
{
   char t1, t2;

   scanf(""%c"", &amp;t1);
   scanf(""%c"", &amp;t2);
   printf(""%d\n"", t1);
   printf(""%d\n"", t2);

   //INPUT is: ""b d"" (without quotes)
}
</code></pre>

<p>results in t1 = 98 (b) and t2 = 32 (' '). (Whitespace <strong>NOT</strong> skipped)</p>

<p>Reading the original quote, I think any reasonable person would take it to mean that during that same call to scanf(%c), the whitespace skip is suppressed. However, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p>

<p>It seems that in order to gain back the original functionality, one would have to completely empty stdin.</p>

<p>Is this supposed to work this way? Has it been documented? Because i've looked around and haven't seen much information on this.</p>

<p>For reference, I'm programming in C99.</p>

<p>But I can't seem to find the right one.  Is there one that will provide the functionality I am looking for, and work with IE?</p>

<p>I'm trying to compile some C code in VS2008 and it doesn't create an exe. Also, when I try to run it with f5, I get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This application has failed to start

<p>I did some googling and it said that this was because my c++ redistributable package wasnt installed. So I installed that, restarted everything and tried again. But alas, I still get the same error. Does anyone have any clue how to fix this?</p>

When the server's <code>Region and Language</code> settings is set to <code>English (United States)</code> there are no issues with objects containing the date and time. But when I change it to my countries local <code>Dutch (Belgium)</code> I am experiencing problems in some of my PowerShell scripts.</p>

<p>Is there somewhere a variable in PowerShell that needs to be set to fix this? Or do I have to default to English  date formats on the server all the time?</p>

<p>We use for example the <code>SQL module</code> provided by Don Jones for filling up an SQL database. This line generates an error when it's set to Dutch, but not when it's set to English:</p>

<pre><code>if ($properties[$property] -eq 'datetime2') { [datetime]$prop = $result.GetDateTime($result.GetOrdinal($property)) }
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing I do to retrieve the date is <code>Get-Date</code> without anything special. And it generates this error when set to <code>Dutch (Belgium)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Exception calling ""ExecuteNonQuery"" with ""0"" argument(s): ""Conversion failed when converting date and/or time from char
acter string.""

<p>I've experienced the same problem when generating stuff for Excel sheets. It also complains about the date time format. Thank you for your help or advice guys.</p>

<p>E.g.
Dir10 is child of D5,
Dir5 is child of Dir2,
Dir2 is child of Dir1,
Dir1 is child of root (nothing)</p>

<p>So my index should return each of the Dirs as one row, but I also need the details of the parents of the node in the same row.</p>

<p>E.g.
Dir10 should include all those other dirs, 
Dir5 should include all dirs other than Dir10, 
Dir2 should include Dir1, 
Dir1 has just itself</p>

<p>Now, putting the information of all parents in the same row is going to be tricky and additionally I don't actually need the specific parent details. What I need is only the privacy settings because each node has a privacy (public = 1 or private = 2), and I want to filter by row where if any parent node is set to private (2), the row is determined to be private. This is so that I can filter out all files/folders which the user has set as private if any parent dir has been set as private.</p>

<p>This is a little different from the other hierarchical queries around where one row is selected as the ""seed"" and either all children or all parents are found.</p>

<p>Anyone have any idea how this is done? Or if there's another solution?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: <em>the ""#"" char is ok, the "" in the ""%""23 were wrong. Putting just %23 works (but still have the same error).</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>I know there are a couple of articles to talk about using dynamic programming to solve it. Since I'd like to do practice in writing recursion code, I wrote the following code:</p>

<pre><code>const int not_possible = 999999;

class box{
public:
    int width;
    int depth;
    int height;
    box(int h=not_possible, int d=not_possible, int w=not_possible):
        width(w), depth(d), height(h) {}
};


bool check_legal(box lower, box upper){
    return (upper.depth&lt;lower.depth) &amp;&amp; 
           (upper.height&lt;lower.height) &amp;&amp;
           (upper.width&lt;lower.width);
}

void highest_stack(const vector&lt;box&gt;&amp; boxes, bool* used, box cur_level, int num_boxes, int height, int&amp; max_height)
{
    if(boxes.empty())
        return;

    bool no_suitable = true;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; num_boxes; ++i){
        box cur;
        if(!(*(used+i)) &amp;&amp; check_legal(cur_level, boxes[i])){
            no_suitable = false;
            cur = boxes[i];
            *(used+i) = true;
            highest_stack(boxes, used, cur, num_boxes, height+cur.height, max_height);
            *(used+i) = false;

                    no_suitable = true;
        }
    }

    if(no_suitable){
        cout &lt;&lt; height &lt;&lt; endl; //for debug
        if(height &gt; max_height)
            max_height = height;
            return;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tested it using a lot of examples. For example:</p>

<pre><code>boxes.push_back(box(4,12,32));
boxes.push_back(box(1,2,3));
boxes.push_back(box(2,5,6));
highest_stack(boxes, used, cur, boxes.size(), 0, max_height);
</code></pre>

<p>In the function <code>highest_stack</code>, there is one line <code>cout &lt;&lt; height &lt;&lt; endl;</code> for output. If I comment <code>no_suitable = true;</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the output is: 1 2 4; 1 2; 1, 1 4;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if I don't comment <code>no_suitable = true;</code> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the output is: 1 2 4; 2 4; 4; 1 2; 2; 1; 1 4; 0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of them can give the correct result which is 7.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>My question is:
(1) Can anyone help me verify my solution?
(2) Is there any more elegant recursive code for this problem? 
</code></pre>
  
  <p>I don't think  my code is elegant.
      Thanks</p>

<p>I saw a similar question at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12635152/what-is-the-use-of-the-pool-option-in-database-yml"">what is the use of the pool option in database.yml</a> but needed to go further to understand this more.</p>

<p>Here is my setup. I have instances running Unicorn with 5 worker process'. I also have Sidekiq instances with concurrency set to 5 (I am asumming thats 5 concurrent threads).</p>

<p>What should I consider for my pool size? What are other factors should I take into consideration?</p>

<p>This is my understanding so far (as quoted from an engineer I was speaking to earlier):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you leave it at the default 5. It just means that, inside ""a
  single process"", the pool size is 5. The pool is
  per process. It is not system-wide so having a value of 5 does not
  mean that you are limited to 5 processes it just means that <em>each</em>
  process has its own pool, of size 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In summary</strong>, each instance has a db pool size of 5. This also means the db pool size setting is not app wide, but per process/instance. Which also means, since Sidekiq and Unicorn will run in its own instance. It will have its own db pool size of 5. Is this assumption correct?</p>

<p>PS. If you can share your pool size for your AWS RDS instances. That would be appreciated.</p>

<p>the numbers in this matrix are index of a point cloud and this matrix show points that have a relation with together.
as seen points 1 to 8 exept 7 build a group and 9 to 12 with 7 build a new group. 
how can I find these groups?
I try using the second column and say that when I have not a number smaller than any unique number in first column so we have a new group.but in row 9 this condition is faild.</p>

<p>I am trying to remove a host from a contact group (localhost) using wato. When I remove a host I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>""Contact group **** specified in service ***** is not defined anywhere""
</code></pre>

<p>I have tracked down the config file /etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/rules.mk so that I can amend the file for testing and run cmk -R rather than use wato. </p>

<pre><code>host_contactgroups = [
  ( 'TEST1', [], ['TESTSERVER1', 'localhost'], {'comment': u'First Test Contact'} ),
  ( 'TEST2', [], ['TESTSERVER2', 'localhost'], {'comment': u'Second Test Contact'} ),
] + host_contactgroups
</code></pre>

<p>I have also had a look at files in /etc/nagios/objects and the contacts.cfg file is empty (bar a few comments) and I can see that some extra folders for host groups with custom host.cfg and services.cfg files.</p>

<p>It is this services.cfg file that it seems to complaining about - this is an extract:</p>

<pre><code>define service{
  contact_groups all,TEST1
  use generic-service,srv-pnp
  host_name TESTSERVER1
  service_description Check server health
  check_command check_nrpe!check_server
  }
</code></pre>

<p>When I look at the file check_mk builds (/etc/nagios/objects/servers/check_mk_objects.cfg) I can see the mentions of the Contact Groups assigned to the localhost but taking them out breaks the nagios preflight checks:</p>

<pre><code> define host {
   host_name localhost
   use check_mk_host
   address 127.0.0.1
   _TAGS
   hostgroups check_mk
   contact_groups all,TEST1,TEST2
   alias This is Nagios

<p>On the main sheet (Employees!), each person has a row of data for each active year.  Work 14 years, you have 14 lines of data to track.</p>

<pre><code>Employees! -----------------------------------------
C       D               **E**                       F       G   H   I   J...
Year    Name            NewNameDOB                  Dept
2013    Julie Assan     Julie Assan1978-0805        East
1998    Mike Rogers     Duplicate in Same Year      Main
1999    Mike Rogers     Duplicate in Same Year      Main
2000    Mike Rogers     Mike Rogers1969-0510        Main
2001    Mike Rogers     Mike Rogers1969-0510        Main
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned, I need to separate duplicate names from 10395 records (like Mike Rogers and Mike Rogers).  <strong>Employees! column E</strong> will now identify the employees as Julie Assan1978-0805 and Julie Assan1980-0131 (for example).  </p>

<p>Today we take my first step, using the years they worked in order to solve 99% of the duplicates.  After this, only a few duplicate names will be left who worked at the same time as each other, which I'll have to handle manually.</p>

<p>If the Employees! sheet has a 2013 record for ""Julie Assan,"" then the first step is to check DOBs to find any Julie Assans who worked in 2013.  My new <strong>column E in Employees!</strong> will take the current 2013 record of Julie Assan, and find any matches in DOB! where C (name) matches Julie Assan, E &lt;= 2013, and F >= 2013.  Usually, there will be only one match, and it will tell me that is Julie Assan1978-0805.  Sometimes, there will be two Mike Rogers who worked during the same year, and it should tell me ""Duplicate in Same Year"".</p>

<p>On the <strong>Employees! sheet column E</strong>, I've started with this...<br>
    =index(DOBs!$k$2:$k$10395,match($d3&amp;$c3,DOBs!$c$2:$c$10395&amp;   ???   ,0)  </p>

<p>Not sure where to go with this formula, whether that means adding ""IFs"" or something different.</p>

<p>I've tried to set up a menu item to point to the blog by setting it up as an external URL:</p>

<p>www.domain.com/blog</p>

<p>However, Joomla keeps throwing an error:</p>

<p>Save failed with the following error: A first level menu item alias cannot be 'our-blog' because 'our-blog' is a sub-folder of your joomla installation folder.</p>

<p>I can't get it to work without hacking the database or the core code.  Is there a simple solution that I'm missing?</p>

So, to insert the values into my <code>users</code> and <code>profiles</code> table which hav <code>OneToOne</code> relationship, Here is how my <code>store()</code> method looks like</p>

<pre><code>public function store(Requests\StoreNewUser $request)
{
    // crate an objct of user model
        $user = new \App\User;
        // now request and assign validated input to array of column names in user table
        $user-&gt;first_name = $request-&gt;input('first_name');
        $user-&gt;last_name = $request-&gt;input('last_name');
        $user-&gt;email = $request-&gt;input('email');
        $user-&gt;password = $request-&gt;input('password');
        /* want to assign request input to profile table's columns in one go 
        */
        $user-&gt;profile()-&gt;user_id = $user-&gt;id; // foreign key in profiles table
        $user-&gt;profile()-&gt;mobile_no = $request-&gt;input('mobile'); 
        dd($user); // nothing related to profile is returned
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm creating the new record, hence <code>dd()</code> never returns anything related to profile table.</p>

<p>Is this Because the <code>$user</code> object is not including relationship by default?
If yes Can i create the <code>$user</code> object which includes the associated relations in <code>User</code> Model ? </p>

<p>Or do i have to create two separate objects of each table and <code>save()</code> the data<BR> But then what is the significance of <code>push()</code> method ? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong>
P.S. yes, the relationships are already defined in <code>User</code> &amp; <code>Profile</code> model </p>

        NetworkStream stream = endpoint.GetStream();

        {
            Console.WriteLine(System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes, 0, i));

<p>For example.</p>

<p>Item 1:
Id = 1
Tags = Something,Separated-Term</p>

<p>I will then be structuring the search so I can look for documents against tag i.e.</p>

<p>tags:something OR tags:separate-term</p>

<p>I need to maintain the exact term value in order to search against it.</p>

<p>I have something running, and the search query is being parsed as expected, but I am not seeing any results. Here's some code.</p>

<p>My parser (_luceneAnalyzer is passed into my indexing service):</p>

<pre><code>var parser = new QueryParser(Lucene.Net.Util.Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, ""Tags"", _luceneAnalyzer);
parser.SetDefaultOperator(QueryParser.Operator.AND);
return parser;

<pre><code>var doc = new Document();

var id = new Field(
    ""Id"",
    NumericUtils.IntToPrefixCoded(indexObject.id),
    Field.Store.YES,

var searcher = Searcher;

TopDocs hits = searcher.Search(query, null, max);

float scoreNorm = 1.0f / hits.GetMaxScore();

for (int i = 0; i &lt; hits.scoreDocs.Length; i++)
{
    float score = hits.scoreDocs[i].score * scoreNorm;
    result.Add(CreateSearchResult(searcher.Doc(hits.scoreDocs[i].doc), score));
}

return result;
</code></pre>

<p>I have two documents in my index, one with the tag ""Something"" and one with the tags ""Something"" and ""Separated-Term"". It's important for the - to remain in the terms as I want an exact match on the full value.</p>

<p>When I search with ""tags:Something"" I do not get any results.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What Analyzer should I be using to achieve the search index I am after?

<p>Is there some Haskell program that cannot be easily mapped to Scala? If yes, what is the missing feature in Scala that prevents this mapping? </p>

<p>My intuition is that Scala is at least as powerful as Haskell, I am just not sure if this intuition is correct. Can someone confirm this ?  </p>

<p>EDIT:
I see the point of Abrahamson's. The definition of emulation is indeed crucial. I would define emulation from a practical point of view, given a programmer who knows both Haskell and Scala can transform a 100 line Haskell code into an equivalent Scala codes say in 1-2 hours. Now is the question, what is equivalent? That means, transforming the logical constructs that are in the Haskell code into equivalent logical constructs in Scala, for example Type Classes in Haskell transformed into equivalent constructs implemented with implicits.</p>

<p>Once attempting to update. (AS soon as I click edit on one of the columns) I get the following error message: <strong>'DropDownList2' has a SelectedValue which is invalid because it does not exist in the list of items.

<p>I split the columns into templates, as seen below,so I can manage them easier. 'Dropdown list 2' is located in my edit template. It is connected to a datasource; that being the exact same source as my first dropdownmenu which works flawlessly. So I don't believe it would be the sql behind that procedure.

    @FirstName nvarchar(20),

<p>I am looking for <strong>Java web framework</strong> that will expose domain classes via RESTful JSON web services. Then will [hopefully] generate web forms for those domain classes. And uses jQuery ajax to communicate with server for sending/receiving JSON data and populate in HTML.</p>

<p>All web UI processing should be in client browser. Server should just transmit <strong>static HTML5 pages</strong>. No server-side processing like JSP.</p>

<p>UPDATE. I must clarify that my question point is not what framework to use for web-services creation. (There are a lot like Apache CXF, Spring MVC web services). It is not also about jQuery or not. But <strong>Java</strong> framework that will save time for boilerplate coding of client-server communication.</p>

<p>Groovy &amp; Scala are great things, but they are not Java, but JVM languages.
( Imagine telling to teammates ""We should learn Java-like language with some differencies to start using that framework..."" )</p>

<p>I know how to write a query for an individual culture. I figure I'll write individual queries for all cultures in the <code>Culture</code> table that have the <code>Supported</code> field set to 1 (<code>true</code>). Then, I'll apply a LEFT OUTER JOIN between the English culture (which will have all values) and all other cultures to get the above data set.</p>

<p>So far, I've gotten this far in writing the query for a single culture:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
ResourceKey.Id AS ResourceKeyId, 
ResourceKey.Name AS [Key], 
Category.Name AS CategoryName, 
Culture.Id AS CultureId, 
Culture.ShortName AS CultureShortName, 
Strings.ResourceValue
FROM 
ResourceKey LEFT OUTER JOIN Strings ON ResourceKey.Id = Strings.ResourceKeyId
INNER JOIN Culture ON Strings.CultureId = Culture.Id
LEFT OUTER JOIN StringCategory ON ResourceKey.Id = StringCategory.ResourceKeyId
LEFT OUTER JOIN Category ON StringCategory.CategoryId = Category.Id
WHERE Strings.CultureId = 23; -- this will be a T-SQL stored procedure parameter I understand
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns the following results:</p>

<pre><code>ResourceKeyId   Key         CategoryName    CultureId   CultureShortName    ResourceValue

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""inform"" action=""http://site.com""&gt;

    $na= jQuery.noConflict();
    $na(document).ready(function(){ 
            $na('#infuse').click(function(){


                         var name= $na('#name').val();

                         var email = $na('#email').val();


                 $na.ajax({

<p>The video sits on a background color of <code>#dcdcdc</code>.  The video's background is also <code>#dcdcdc</code>.  On my machine (Windows 7, Chrome) the colors match.  On my iMac in Chrome the background does <em>not</em> match and is a slightly lighter shade of grey.  On a colleagues machine (Windows 7, Chrome) the background does <em>not</em> match and is the same as the iMac.</p>

<p>I'm confused about the proper use of gcnew with marshal_context.  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384856.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a> uses gcnew to instantiate marshal_context, while many online examples do not instantiate marshal_context at all.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is use of gcnew optional with marshal_context?  If so, why?</li>
<li>My wrapper is consumed by a C# application that throws heap corruption errors on when invoking Cleanup().  Why?</li>

<p>1.) I'm not sure if I'm creating too much redundancy with my models if so how do I minimize it. For example, for music albums, I'm creating a model for albums, artists, and tracks and in each of those models I reference the other models multiple times.</p>

<p>2.) In regards to my ManyToManyFields, by referencing a model that's not defined until further down in models.py, <code>python manage.py syncdb</code> is throwing up an error that I have no defined the relationships.

<p>What I'm still not understanding is where do I had a custom hex color ?</p>

<p>here is what I've tried but without success:</p>

<p>First in maze.tmLanguage</p>

<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;patterns&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;dict&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;comment&lt;/key&gt;

                &lt;key&gt;fontStyle&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;key&gt;foreground&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;#BADA55&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/dict&gt;
        &lt;/dict&gt;
        &lt;dict&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;comment&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;This pattern matches the player charactere&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;match&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;[\u25C4,\u25BA,\u25B2,\u25BC]&lt;/string&gt;

<p>Obviously, if I just execute a drop statement, the SQL Server database will complain stating that the new table has foreign key references to other tables.</p>

<p>I need something more automated. Why do I have to drop each foreign key constraint separately, and then only be able to drop the table?</p>

  <p>Turns off the display of an element (it has no effect on layout); all descendant elements also have their display turned off. The document is rendered as though the element did not exist.</p>

<p>I know this means I can't see the element. Since the element has no effect on the layout, it appears as if it does not exist. </p>

<p>My question is: does it still exist in the layout (it still responds to user events)? Or does it not exist in the layout at all (therefore not just appearance)?</p>

<p><strong>Just to clarify:</strong> </p>

<p>I know the element still exists in the DOM. I'm asking if interaction with the view can still affect the state of that element. For example, if I click where a hidden element would have existed, does that still trigger an event?</p>

<p>I'm asking because I know you can target hidden elements in CSS like so:</p>

<pre><code>input[type=""checkbox""] {
  display: none;

input[type=""checkbox""]:checked + otherElement {

On the accordion, I have several partial views that use the jQuery dialog widget to open either an add, edit or delete partial view.  Everything works well except the add and edit partial views using the jQuery datepicker widget.  The icon displays and opens the widget, but when I select a date, the date is not put into the respective textbox.  This behaviour doesn't occur in other partial views when they are opened from a view instead of a partial view.  </p>

<p>I should mention that if I type a date into the textbox and save it, everything works as expected.</p>

<p>I use a DateTime.cshtml template to convert all @Html.EditorFor dates to @Html.TextBox, and add a .datepicker class attribute.</p>

<pre><code>@model System.DateTime?
@Html.TextBox("""", String.Format(""{0:d}"", Model.HasValue ? Model.Value.ToShortDateString() : string.Empty), new { @class = ""datepicker"" })
</code></pre>

<p>The datepicker jQuery from the _Layout.cshtml is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  $(document).ready(function () {
    $('.datepicker').datepicker({
      changeMonth: true,
      changeYear: true,
      showOn: ""button"",
      buttonImage: ""/Images/calendar.gif"",
      buttonImageOnly: true,
      dateFormat: 'm/d/yy'
    }).css(""z-index"", ""9999"");
  });

So my test can pass even if I don't implement the restoring things in my <code>onCreate</code> method (since my fields are unchanged...).</p>

I have 3 sequences </p>

<pre><code> seq1='AATC'
 seq2='GCCT'
 seq3='ATCA'
</code></pre>

<p>I want to calculate the entropy of three sequences, its formula is:</p>

<pre><code>Entropy (A[:][i])= - ∑  p_ia log( p_ia)
p_ia = C_ia /∑  C_ia'
</code></pre>

<p>where p_ia is the probability of letter a in column i ,and C_ia is the number of letter a in the column A[:][i]</p>

<p>example: from the above 3 sequences: first column:a' take the values C , A and C, here C_ia'= 3 , if a='C' C_ia=2 so p_ia=2 /3,</p>

<p>if a='A' C_ia=1 so p_ia=1 /3</p>

<pre><code>Entropy (A[:][0])=-(2/3 log (2/3)+1/3 log(1/3))
</code></pre>

<p>the same thing for the rest of columns.
I have tried this:
this function calculate the  occurence (frequency) of each letter in a given string and l is the length of string it means <code>l=∑  C_ia'.</code></p>

<pre><code>def occ(source):
    occ={}
    l=0
    for e in source:
        l +=1
        if e not in occ:
            occ[e]=0
        occ[e]+=1
    return (l,occ)
</code></pre>

<p>example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; source='aaazzzedc'
&gt;&gt;&gt; occ(source)
(9, {'z': 3, 'c': 1, 'a': 3, 'd': 1, 'e': 1})
</code></pre>

<p>then, this is the function of entropy:</p>

<pre><code>def entropy(occ,l):
    elist=[]
    for v in occ.values():
        c=v/l
        elist.append(-c *math.log(c, 2))
    return sum(elist)
</code></pre>

<p>example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (l,h)=occ(source)
&gt;&gt;&gt; entropy(h,l)
2.113283334294875
</code></pre>

<p>OK.
this is for simple example, but for me I want to apply it on columns of sequences.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; source=[occ(t) for t in zip(seq1,seq2,seq3)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; source
[(3, {'A': 2, 'G': 1}), (3, {'C': 1, 'A': 1, 'T': 1}), (3, {'C': 2, 'T': 1}), (3, {'C': 1, 'A': 1, 'T': 1})]
</code></pre>

<p>how can I calculate the entropy of this sequences?
this gives by the first column:</p>

<pre><code>(3, {'A': 2, 'G': 1})
2/3 * log(2/3)+ 1/3 * log (1/3)
</code></pre>

<p>How can I write the entropy of all columns?</p>

<p>The thing I wanted to ask is interaction threads and sockets. Specifically, I'm interested in accept() function. I tried searching it, but didn't quite find similar situation.</p>

<p>So, the problem is - while I'm trying to accept socket outside of the thread, it works perfectly. Contrary, if I use it inside the thread, its' call is just ignored.</p>

<p>So, here's the method which calls accept function:</p>

<pre><code>void ServerSocket::Accept( void )
{
    sockaddr_in saClientAddr;
    int nCliSize = sizeof( sockaddr_in );
    sClient = accept( sSocket, (sockaddr*)&amp;saClientAddr, &amp;nCliSize );

    if( sClient == INVALID_SOCKET )
    {
        GetError();
        return;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, using it in following manner:</p>

<pre><code>CServerObj.Accept();
</code></pre>

<p>it works perfectly, and server waits for the input from the client and then resumes.
But, if it's used inside the thread:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned __stdcall ServerThread( void* Param )
{
    while( true )
    {
        CServerObj.Accept();
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and than begin the thread:</p>

<pre><code>_beginthreadex( 0, 0, &amp;ServerThread, 0, 0, NULL );
</code></pre>

<p>then accept() is ignored every time and program goes into the infinite loop telling about the error (GetError method).</p>

<p>So, I'm kinda confused with this situation. Is this because thread call is asynchronous and therefore it doesn't wait for client's response?</p>

<p>Anyway, I'd be grateful if someone could explain me what did I do wrong.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, after some trial &amp; effort, I figured out the reason behind this strange behavior. It seems like, <code>CServerObj</code>, which was declared as <code>static</code> called constructor twice, therefor rendering <code>bind</code> function useless. Figures, that was stupid error on my part.</p>

<p>But well, now I have another question - why was constructor called twice there?
Code in the header looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef __BLAH_H__
#define __BLAH_H__

class ServerSocket
{
    //some code
}
static ServerSocket CServerObj;

#endif // __BLAH_H__
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose it could be because variable was declared in the header file... but shouldn't <code>#ifndef</code> protect it against second declarations?</p>

  =hidden_field_tag 'invoice[status]', 'Sent'
</code></pre>

<p>This generates the following html;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset=""UTF-8"" action=""/bulk_invoices/"" class=""mark-sent-form"" method=""post""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""margin:0;padding:0;display:inline""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""utf8"" type=""hidden"" value=""&amp;#x2713;"" /&gt;
    &lt;input name=""_method"" type=""hidden"" value=""put"" /&gt;
    &lt;input name=""authenticity_token"" type=""hidden"" value=""OU8GtbHycR/EJ+H3GG9MN59xI59v47LSaFc2wYZloAs="" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;input id=""invoice_status"" name=""invoice[status]"" type=""hidden"" value=""Sent"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the DOM, this appears as follows</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset=""UTF-8"" action=""/bulk_invoices/"" class=""mark-sent-form"" method=""post""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""margin:0;padding:0;display:inline""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""utf8"" type=""hidden"" value=""✓""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""_method"" type=""hidden"" value=""put""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""authenticity_token"" type=""hidden"" value=""OU8GtbHycR/EJ+H3GG9MN59xI59v47LSaFc2wYZloAs=""&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;input id=""invoice_status"" name=""invoice[status]"" type=""hidden"" value=""Sent""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This form is posted with jquery (using coffeescript) like so;</p>

<pre><code>jQuery -&gt;
  $('a.mark-sent').click -&gt; updateBulkInvoices('.mark-sent-form')

updateBulkInvoices = (form) -&gt;
  $(form).attr('action', ""/bulk_invoices/#{checkedInvoices().get().join()}"").submit()
</code></pre>

<p>This pattern has served me well with other actions but the 'invoice[status]' seems to be causing problems. When the form is submitted with jQuery the hidden field is not passed. I see the following in my Rails console;</p>

<pre><code>Parameters: {""utf8""=&gt;""✓"", ""authenticity_token""=&gt;""+qW9kIih5l2j69w1LK2YfQ9mYQ7nKPDm5XgLZuKB4ic="", ""id""=&gt;""16""}
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. the invoice[status] field isn't being passed with the form parameters. If I change the name of this field to anything else it works just fine, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>=form_tag bulk_invoice_path(''), method: 'put', class: 'mark-sent-form' do
  =hidden_field_tag 'invoice[flatus]', 'sent'
</code></pre>

<p>gives me the following parameters in my console;</p>

<pre><code>Parameters: {""utf8""=&gt;""✓"", ""authenticity_token""=&gt;""+qW9kIih5l2j69w1LK2YfQ9mYQ7nKPDm5XgLZuKB4ic="", ""invoice""=&gt;{""flatus""=&gt;""sent""}, ""id""=&gt;""16""}
</code></pre>

<p>I see the same thing happening if I monitor the 'network' tab on Chrome's developer tools so I don't think it's a Rails thing, it seems to be a browser issue. I get the same thing with Safari and Firefox as well though.</p>

<p>Is status some sort of magical reserved word in browser forms? What's going on here?</p>

I am writing a program in java for Android to take the fft of a float array. On the complex frequency spectrum returned I extract the real and imaginary components so I can calculate some parameters such as magnitude and phase. The problem is the libgdx fft transform I am using uses float, however most of the Math class operations use double. So that means I need to convert float to double.
It seems to work fine on the Real component of the fft, however with the imaginary I get precision errors, or rather I get for one frequency bin I get an imaginary float value of 45.188522 however, when I convert to double it changes to -45.188522.</p>

<pre><code>   fft.forward(array);
   fft_cpx=fft.getSpectrum();
   tmpi = fft.getImaginaryPart();
   tmpr = fft.getRealPart();
   for(int i=0;i&lt;array.length/2;i++)
   {
       real[i] = (double) tmpr[i];
       imag[i] = (double) tmpi[i];  // THIS CONVERSION
       mag[i] = (float)Math.sqrt((real[i]*real[i]) + (imag[i]*imag[i]));
       phase[i] = (float) ((float) Math.atan2(imag[i], real[i]));
   }
</code></pre>

<p>I am aware and have tried the android FloatMath class, however there is no atan2 implemented so I am forced to convert to double regardless. </p>

<p>I have also tried a few different conversions like:</p>

<pre><code> imag[i] = tmpi[i];
 imag[i] = Double.parseDouble(Float.toString(tmpi[i])); // Of course you loose accuracy
</code></pre>

<p>But all still return a -45.18852 instead of 45.18852</p>

<p>More Detail:</p>

<p>Below is my src code and usage for those interested.</p>

<p>Ok, I am using Ubuntu 10.10 with eclipse JDK, Version: Helios Service Release 2
Android SDK: The latest r10 from <a href=""http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">android developers</a>.
I am compiling for android 1.6, API level 4. 
I am using libgdx for the fft you can get it here, <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/Building"" rel=""nofollow"">Libgdx</a> and ensure you add the gdx.jar to your libs and added to your build path libraries. If you create a new project either with the same or new activity for android 1.6, set up a AVD, the one I have set up has the following support (included for completeness) :</p>

<p>I am having some troubles with my indexeddb plugin that I wrote closing an object store and then reopening it with a version change.</p>

<p>But first some background on what exactly I'm doing. Due to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26184695/safari-implementation-of-indexeddb-is-very-slow/26849762#26849762"">this issue,</a> I was forced to do a terribly ugly structure for my database. Basically, I found that as you insert more records, it gets slower to insert. Since I have a very large set of data that needs to be saved, it turned out to be much much quicker to save each chunk of data into a separate Objectstore. At first I was creating a new database for each objectstore. This worked out quite well, but as I grew to understand indexedDB more I realized that this was not the best way to do it. I switched my plugin from using multiple databases to one database with multiple objectstores. However, this is where my problems started.</p>

<p>Since I am unable to know how many chunks of data I will need, and one objectstore for each chunk of data, I first get from the server the total count of records that will be inserted and then divide that by the size of each chunk. That way I know how many objectstores I will need. However, since I am going to need to sync this data, those objectstores may already exist or they may not.</p>

<p>Because of this, I get the number of objectstores that already exist, and if that amount is less than the number of the parts I add more.</p>

<p>In order to get that number of object stores, I need to open the database first, then open it again with the updated schema information. However, when I try to do that, it always hits my abort function in my onupgradeneeded. However, if I just run that create function from page load rather than opening the db first, it seems to update the database schema just fine (That doesn't really help me though, as I need to know how many tables I have and the current db version before I can update anything.</p>

<p>This works fine in chrome, firefox and chrome on android, but not on iOS or Safari. Looks like some sort of WebKit issue but I've been digging through their bugtracker and haven't found anything that looks quite like this.</p>

<p>I think that it is not properly closing the previous database connection so it cannot open a new one but I could be wrong here. Has anyone run into this before, or have any thoughts on how I can work around it?</p>

<p>The code is in UILabel extension.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableParagraphStyle *paragraphStyle = [[NSMutableParagraphStyle alloc] init];
paragraphStyle.lineBreakMode = NSLineBreakByWordWrapping;
paragraphStyle.alignment = NSTextAlignmentLeft;

NSDictionary *attr = @{NSDocumentTypeDocumentAttribute: NSHTMLTextDocumentType,  NSCharacterEncodingDocumentAttribute: @(NSUTF8StringEncoding), NSParagraphStyleAttributeName: paragraphStyle};
NSError *error = nil;

NSMutableAttributedString *attributedText = [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc]initWithData:[html dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] options:attr documentAttributes:nil error:&amp;error];

// also tried with this
[attributedText addAttribute:NSParagraphStyleAttributeName value:paragraphStyle
                           range:NSMakeRange(0, html.length)
     ];

self.attributedText = attributedText;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so I created a separate project and there, the text is left aligned by default. I have to find out why in above example the text shows justified. In any case, the main problem remains, I can't change the default alignment. It works when initializing the attributed string with <code>initWithString</code>. But in this case html doesn't work. When <code>initWithData</code>, like in above example, html works but alignment does not work.</p>

<p>Run this snippet and you will see.</p>

label.frame = CGRectMake(50, 50, 300, 400);
label.backgroundColor = [UIColor yellowColor];

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>Case 1 - solved - I somewhere later in the code alignment was being changed. Didn't see that.</p>

<p>Case 2 - solved - see answer.</p>
