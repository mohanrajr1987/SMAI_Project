This method allows all sources to be scraped at the same time, but it also puts a strain on the server, and a bottleneck on the database (MySQL).</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to scale my current application, could I do something like this with AWS? Perhaps each of these scraping scripts could run in their own small server instance, each of these instances would be automatically created by a ""main"" instance and then die once the script has finished. I don't have any experience with AWS, so I'm not entirely sure if this is possible, or maybe it's just a bad idea.</p>

<p>In my attempts to solve the problem I have already cleaned the project, used ""fix project properties"", even created a new project from scratch and restarted Eclipse.</p>

I run Fedora 21 and until recently had no problems. I never installed any proprietary drivers or special tools to deal with graphics, it just worked under fedora.
(I use a Windows partition to play games, everything there works fine too.)</p>

<p>Quite recently I acquired a second GT755 for my Ultrabay-Slot. Booting to Windows went without a problem, SLI activated like a charm and everything seemed fine. However, booting to fedora caused the CPU to rapidly heat up. I found out later that having both VGAs installed causes the bios to disable IntelHD, which apparently was the only VGA Fedora can run out of the box.
So my first try was to install VGA drivers and IntelHD-drivers in parallel.
(following this guide: <a href=""https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/36506/changing-default-driver-for-displaying-x/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/36506/changing-default-driver-for-displaying-x/</a> )
After I found out about the ""no IntelHD with SLI""-problem I tried out to get the SLI disabled and rely only on my Intel. There I made a huge mistake:
In the bios, I disabled the GT755 while booting with only one VGA. Forgetting about that, I later tried to install the Nvidia driver again, which could not find the implemented GT755. Believing this was due to some xorg.conf-code within /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf:</p>

<pre><code>Section ""Device""
    Identifier ""Intel""
    Driver ""intel""
EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>I simply plugged in the second GT755, which caused the bios to disable IntelHD.
Now I installed the Nvidia Driver (bumblebee-nvidia) and everything worked fine, xorg.conf was rewritten autmatically, I disabled nouveau in /etc/default/grub and recompild grub (with grub2-mkconfig -o grub.cfg), and rebooted.
Since then, I could not get to the login-screen. When I enter my LUKS-passwd, I see a yellow Message:</p>

<pre><code>[    0.093961] Ignoring BGRT: invalid status 0 (expected 1)
</code></pre>

<p>But if I remember correctly, this was always displayed, just in white.</p>

<p>I have tried reverting to my backups of xorg.conf, grub.cfg and /etc/default/grub and recompiling grub, nothing worked.
Everything was tested with both enabled and disabled internal GT755.
I tried to reinstall bumblebee-nvidia with enabled GT755, no difference.
IntelHD drivers are loaded at startup and appear to be correctly configured in all xorg related confs.
Calling startx causes the login-screen to flash for a moment, just to be instantly replased by an error-message:</p>

<pre><code>(==) Using system config directory ""/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d""
waiting for X server to shut down ""sni-qt/[NUMBER, 4 digits]"" WARN [TIMESTAMP] void StatusNotifierItemFactory::connectToSnw() Invalid interface to SNW_SERVICE bluedevil-monolithic: Fatal IO error: client killed(EE) Server terminated successfully (0). Closing log file.
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I would be glad to get my display back. Ideally however, I want to be able to keep the second VGA in it's slot and still use IntelHD, since I will never require high VGA performance under fedora.
<strong>What I need now is a possibility to revert my system back to it's old state.</strong>
With any luck I can actually install all required drivers afterwards and would write a little VGA-guide for the Y510P.</p>

<p>Also if tiles were always with a fixed size, I could prepare a texure that would match it, but they HAVE TO be easily resizable without changing a bitmap file I use as texture.</p>

<p>In my unit testing, I'm using Moq to mock the IApi, but I cannot work out how to 'simulate' the WebServiceException that's thrown by the JsonClient when the remote server returns a 409. My unit test code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var mockApi = new Mock&lt;IApi&gt;();
var ex = HttpError.Conflict(StatusMessages.USERNAME_NOT_AVAILABLE);
var wsx = new WebServiceException(ex.Message, ex);
wsx.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.Conflict;

mockApi.Setup(api =&gt; api.GetSomeData()).Throws(wsx);

var c = new FooController(mockApi.Object);
var result = c.Index() as ViewResult;
result.ShouldNotBe(null);
result.ViewName.ShouldBe(""Conflict"");

<p>This leaves me with my modifiedhtml, with which I can do as I please. However- this doesn't seem elegant at all, especially since creating webviews is only permitted on the main thread and this whole process would ideally run in a background thread, also, very occasionally the script throws an error and the webview load event is not called so I have a growing number of lines just dedicated to handling a timeout for this occurrence. It is, all in all, a big ugly mess.</p>

<p>In an ideal world I would apply this javascript on the first pass without creating a webview at all. I've been trying all sorts of things like:</p>

I've tried all the usual suspects and googled every combination of ruby 1.9.1, load path, gems, mac os x,freebsd,prawn and other stuff.  The bottom line is this:</p>

<p>When I compile ruby1.9.1-p129 from sources on mac os x 10.5, the default load path ($:) I get is:</p>

<pre>
ruby -e ""puts $:""
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems
/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1
/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/i386-darwin9.7.0
/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby
/usr/local/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/1.9.1
/usr/local/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/1.9.1/i386-darwin9.7.0
/usr/local/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby
/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.9.1
/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.9.1/i386-darwin9.7.0
.
</pre>

<p>when I install the prawn gem, for example, I get:</p>

<pre>
gem which prawn
(checking gem prawn-0.5.0.1 for prawn)
/prawn.rb
</pre>

<p>and when I try to require it I get:</p>

<pre>
ruby -e ""require 'prawn'""
-e:1:in `require': no such file to load -- prawn (LoadError)
    from -e:1:in `'
</pre>

<p>The only way I've been able to resolve this is by doing something stupid like this:</p>

<pre><code>$: &lt;&lt; ""/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/prawn-0.5.0.1/lib""
</code></pre>

<p>which, of course, is utterly ridiculous. So the question is how do I get ruby 1.9.1 to recognize and follow the correct gems path?  I've never had this issue with 1.8.7 so I'm assuming it 1.9.1 specific.  I feel I'm missing something  completely obvious here and any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<li><p>Hardware: We utilize a 24-core (2*12 core) machine. There are 2 separate controllers for a SSD-disk and a SAS-RAID 0-disk. OS: Windows 8.1. Hyper-threading is disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Software:</p>

<p>2.1. There is a master which fills up a work-queue for the workers and collects the results from a result-queue thereafter.</p>

<p>2.2. There are <em>n</em>-workers which retrieve work from the work-queue. They write small input files to the disk and start an external process to carry out the actual computation. After the external process has finished output-files in the size of 10-15 MB need to be read in from the file-system and to be parsed accordingly. Finally, the worker places the results in the result-queue and carry on with the next item from the work-queue.</p></li>
<li><p>The access to the file-system utilizing both of the disks is distributed evenly among the worker-processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observations</strong></p>

<p>4.1. From <em>0</em> - <em>10</em> workers there is an almost linear speed-up for both multi-threading and multi-processing. Increasing from <em>10</em> to <em>28</em> workers there is a reasonable but sub-linear speed-up in case of multi-processing but almost no increase in case of multi-threading.</p>

<p>4.2. We did extensive timings for multi-threading and found that the time for the computation stays almost constant with a negligible increase when increasing the numbers of workers. <strong>In contrast</strong>, when increasing the number of workers from <em>10</em> - <em>40</em> the time for reading the files from the disks dramatically increases and causes the cores into idling.</p>

<p>4.3. In case of multi-processing the workers seem to be rightly able to take full advantage of the two independent file-IO-channels (RAID and SSD) and out-perform multi-processing by far.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Finally the question</strong>: What is the bottleneck in case of multi-threading and how can we circumvent it?</p>

<p><em>Note 1:</em> Avoiding file-system access altogether is not an option, since the external process is a third party software.</p>

<p><em>Note 2:</em> I'm aware of these <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3376562/performance-difference-for-multi-thread-and-multi-process"">answers</a>, but they don't address my question.</p>

<p>I'm familiar with making customer table cells for use in a table but I've never made a custom view again.</p>

<p>My question is what is the best way to load this view? I've tried simply placing the view in the view controllers I want it to appear in using IB, but that doesn't seem to be enough. It seems to me that it would make sense that if you set the Class Identity for the view that it should load up that view when the view controller is created. Or maybe it doesn't because it doesn't know what nib to get it from (it's in its own nib, of course).</p>

<p>Since it's not a view controller, I can't just use initWithNibName. I've tried using NSBundle loadNibNamed like I do with table cells but it seems like an awfully large amount of work. The code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *topLevelObjects = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@""MyCustomView"" owner:nil options:nil];
for (id currentObject in topLevelObjects) {
    if ([currentObject isKindOfClass:[MyCustomView class]]) {
        self.customView = currentObject;
        break;
    }
}
[self.view addSubview:self.customView];
</code></pre>

<p>There must be an easier way which doesn't involve the loop. Also, creating the view this way makes me lose all the info from IB on where I actually placed the view. It's created at 0,0 which is not where I want it. Yes, I know I can set a new frame, but again, there must be an easier way. Is there a way I can do this all through IB? Or at least with less work programmatically?</p>

  class Meta:
    db_table = 'Proxy'
  equipment = models.ForeignKey('Equipment', primary_key=True)

<p>the json output contains the ""id"" of the Pop and not the name, which I want.</p>

<p>So I used the Manager class and this is my Pop class now- </p>

<pre><code>class PopManager(models.Manager):

  objects = PopManager()
  name = models.CharField(max_length=10)
  type = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=POP_TYPES)

<p>But after this, when I do</p>

<pre><code>res = Proxy.objects.filter(equipment_id__exact='eq1')
Serializer.serialize('json', res, use_natural_keys=True)
</code></pre>

<p>I get an error,
TypeError: Equipment: eq1 is not JSON serializable</p>

<p>I have also tried wadofstuff for this serialization of foreign keys, but apparently in Django1.5, there is a clash between simplejson and json, and the query was throwing an error. So I am back to square one.</p>

"720326","1","","","2009-04-06 05:14:04","","5","129","<p>I have an existing Perl application which is deployed to multiple customer sites. Unfortunately, the code has been cloned multiple times to customise it for individual customers. So there are now several complete copies of the code which all have slight (or major) differences.</p>

<p>My task is to fix this mess by creating a single, generic code base with customisations for different customers being isolated in their own libraries.</p>

<p>The application already has a class hierarchy (with about 120 classes) along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>Control.pm
  \__ BaseJob.pm
           \___Job1.pm
           |
           |__ Job2.pm
           |
           |__ Job3.pm
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is to be able to customise a specific class or method by modifying only the library for a particular customer.</p>

<p>My first instinct is to create sub-classes for anything that needs to be customised for a particular customer. These sub-classes would live in a customer-specific lib directory (one per customer). Then, to customise a class or method for a customer, I would just add a new sub-class to the customer library.</p>

<p>For example, if one method in <code>Job2.pm</code> needs to be customised, I might create a subclass <code>CustomJob2</code> which inherits from <code>Job2</code> and contains only the method to be customised. </p>

<p>Then in the main program, this:</p>

<pre><code>Job2-&gt;some_method();
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>CustomJob2-&gt;some_method();
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this will break the code for all other customers because they don't have the <code>CustomJob2</code> class in their libraries. It appears I would have to add an empty <code>CustomJob2</code> class to the library for every customer.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

<p>The other possibility I've considered is to use overrides instead of sub-classes. The main program would just need a <code>use lib</code> to include the customer library and any methods to be customised would just be re-defined in the library. However this is probably dangerous and not considered best practice.</p>

<p>I seek the wisdom of StackOverflow gurus in finding the best approach to this problem.</p>

  # login credentials
  username  = params[:user][:email] # The username is the email field
  password  = params[:user][:password]

  begin
    # Here is the code to authenticate
    # Basically, we are sending the credentials to another central authentication server
    # If the authentication fails, it will throw an exception, which will be caught below to fail!

    user = klass.find_or_initialize_by_email(username)

    puts ""user: #{user.inspect}""

    success! user
  rescue Exception =&gt; e
    failureMessage = ""Auth error: #{e.inspect}""

    fail! failureMessage
  end

<p>And in my <code>User</code> model:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see that I'm not using <code>database_authenticatable</code> at all, but we need to save some user info from the central server to our application server.</p>

<p>I'm guessing it's because of:</p>

<p>In jsp, I try to use my variable in this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""button"" class=""styledButton"" 
       onclick=""javascript: doAjax('myActionName',false);"" 
       value=""${myActionVariable}""
</code></pre>

<p>But it is not shown. However, if I output this variable from the javascript code included within the same jsp file:</p>

<pre><code>alert (${myActionVariable})
</code></pre>

<p>I will get the value of it....</p>

<p>Any idea please ? ...</p>

<pre><code>public uint MyPropery 
{
    get 
    {
        object o = Session[""MyProperty""];
        if (o != null)
            return (uint)o;
        else
            return 0;
    }
    set 
    {
        Session[""MyProperty""] = value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this time I get a NullReferenceException in the setter. As far as I know, it is valid to assign the Session variable in the manner above. Also, Session is not null and neither is value.</p>

<p>Any ideas on this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Adding the code for the UserControl in which the property exists. I am using ext.net but that shouldnt have anything to do with this. One thought that crossed my mind:</p>

<p>The UserControl (seen below) is added dynamically in code-behind of a page. Can that have anything to do with it?</p>

<p>I am adding UserControls like this  (on a Page):</p>

<pre><code>foreach(CoreCommons.System.Comment c in cg.Reply_Comments)
{
    WebApplicationExtNetTest.Secure.UserControls.CoreComment cc = new UserControls.CoreComment();
    cc._Comment = c; // here is where i get the NullRef
    this.Panel1.ContentControls.Add(cc);
}

I make backups regularly using <code>pg_dump</code> (via php-pgadmin) in copy mode and the size of the backup file is almost 10-12 MB. Now the problem I am facing is that whenever I try to restore the database, foreign key constraint problem occur. The scenario is as follows:</p>

<p>There are two tables: 1) <code>users</code> and 2) <code>zones</code>. I have stored the id of zone in <code>users</code> table to identify the user's zone and have set it as foreign key.</p>

<p>When I take the db dump, the entries for table <code>zones</code> come only after that of table <code>users</code>. I think it's due to the first letter of table name: <code>u</code> comes before <code>z</code>, and therefore when I restore the database, a foreign key constraint problem occurs and the execution stops. The same problem occurs when I try to restore the db structure, it says the table <code>zones</code> does not exist in the database since the structure of <code>zones</code> comes after that of <code>users</code> in the dump file.</p>

<p><em>The question is:</em> <strong><em>Why does the compiler/linker fail to resolve the call to the virtual function from the derived class?</em></strong> In this case, the derived class is a template class with variadic parameters that applies multiple inheritance against the same template class multiple times (once for each type in the variadic parameters).</p>

<p>In the concrete example below, the derived class is <code>JobPlant</code>, and it is being called from <code>Worker</code>. Invoking the abstract <code>work()</code> method fails to link, while invoking <code>workaround()</code> links and executes in the expected way.</p>

<p>These are the link failures as shown by <a href=""http://ideone.com/mxfoKd"" rel=""nofollow"">ideone</a>:</p>

<pre><code>/home/g6xLmI/ccpFAanK.o: In function `main':

</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://ideone.com/yDaBSf"" rel=""nofollow"">Follow this link</a> for demonstration of the workaround working.</p>

<p><code>Job</code> is an abstract base class, and it has associated derived classes. <code>Work</code> is an abstract template class that performs a job. <code>Worker</code> is a template that identifies the <code>JOB</code> and performs it (<code>struct</code> instead of <code>class</code> purely to reduce syntax clutter):</p>

<pre><code>struct Job { virtual ~Job() {} };

struct JobA : Job {};
struct JobB : Job {};
struct JobC : Job {};

template &lt;typename JOB&gt;
struct Work {
    virtual ~Work() {}
    virtual void work(const JOB &amp;) = 0;
    void workaround(const Job &amp;job) { work(dynamic_cast&lt;const JOB &amp;&gt;(job)); }
};

    bool operator()(PLANT *p, const Job &amp;job) const {
        if (Worker&lt;PLANT, JOB&gt;()(p, job)) return true;
        return Worker&lt;PLANT, JOBS...&gt;()(p, job);
    }

        }
        return false;

<p>A <code>JobPlant</code> is a template class parameterized by <code>JOBS</code>, that finds a <code>Worker</code> to perform a <code>job</code>. The <code>JobPlant</code> inherits from <code>Work</code> for each job type in <code>JOBS</code>. <code>MyJobPlant</code> is an instance of <code>JobPlant</code>, and implements the virtual <code>work</code> methods from the associated <code>Work</code> abstract classes.</p>

<p>I think I have found something <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1586843/apache-commons-fileupload-tomcat-cant-cope-with-out-flush"">that may be related</a> on StackOverflow. It seems to suggest there is some bug in Tomcat 6 which was fixed in version 6.0.20, a slightly higher version than the one we're using. Unfortunately it doesn't mention what the issue itself was. I've <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/changelog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">had a look</a> at the Tomcat changelog, but can't see any likely candidates for a bug which could cause this problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to my actual question, has anyone encountered a similar problem, and if so, what was the underlying issue and how did you resolve it?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any responses. </p>

<p>EDIT: This appears to be some kind of problem with load balancing and Tomcat. If you bypass the load balancer and access Tomcat directly via the server IP address, the problem goes away. The strange thing is that this appears in both our staging environment, in which we use Apache/AJP1.3, and live, where we use Zeus. </p>

<p>EDIT3: This turned out to be an issue with the clients firewall. It appears that they were.. er.. not being entirely truthful when they said that the knew definitely this was not a Firewall issue.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Mystagogue/nk5Wx/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSFiddle, Sample #1</a> </p>

<p>But as soon as IE7 is asked to the same thing, with javascript modifying the ""class"" of the elements, it completely loses horizontal formatting:</p>

<p>This second example generates the HTML, and updates it with a timer, but it is identical HTML.</p>

<p>I speculate this has something to do with having more than one class associated with the div elements (class=""count-digit digit4""), and the fact that I'm updating the second of those two classes dynamically.  I figure IE7 just gives up.  Is that the real issue?  And regardless, what would be the proper way to fix this - so that dynamic updates work correctly?</p>

<p>I use this jQuery function to get a list of guests. The user fills out an inputfield with a name like 'John'. Ajax is searching  a database for guest with either first or lastname containing 'John'. In the same script (PHP) i create a JSON object which looks like [""1234:John Doe"",""..."",""...""] (the number is the ID of this guest, guess thats not important, just want to mention that).
Then i pass the JSON to the autocomplete function of jQuery UI.</p>

<p>Everything works fine in FF and Chrome, after getting a result in form of a JSON, a litte window opens below the inputield and shows all matches.
In IE9 its not like it doesnt work at all but i never get the full JSON object as a result. Also, mostly i have to write almost the whole name to get a match - 'Sulliv' to get lastnames like 'Sullivan'. In FF its enough to write 'Sul'.</p>

<p>In the Guest database are aroung 8.1k entries. Can't IE handle a JSON that large or do i have to improve my script. Is it a common issue with IE and JSON or jQuery?</p>

<p>According to the everyauth page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then, from within your views, you will have access to the following
  helpers methods attached to the helper, <code>everyauth</code>:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><code>everyauth.loggedIn</code></li>
  <li><code>everyauth.user</code> - the User document associated with the session</li>
  <li><code>everyauth.facebook</code> - The is equivalent to what is stored at <code>req.session.auth.facebook</code>,    so you can do things like ...</li>
  <li><code>everyauth.facebook.user</code> - returns the user json provided from the OAuth provider.</li>
  <li><code>everyauth.facebook.accessToken</code> - returns the access_token provided from the OAuth provider   for authorized API calls on behalf of the
  user.</li>
  <li>And you also get this pattern for other modules - e.g., <code>everyauth.twitter.user</code>,    <code>everyauth.github.user</code>, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Within my .jade templates I can make the requests just fine:</p>

<pre><code>- if (everyauth.facebook)
h3 Facebook User Data
p= JSON.stringify(everyauth.facebook.user)
p= 'facebook access token is '+ everyauth.facebook.accessToken
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, how can I fetch the access token from the server-side javascript? I noticed that within </p>

<pre><code>app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.render('home');
console.log(req.sessionStore.sessions.);
});
</code></pre>

<p>the req object does contain the access_token value but the corresponding JSON is very unwieldy to parse and not really practical for dozens of APIs. Is there any way I can simply  retrieve the access_token from the server using everyauth?</p>

<p>Hypothetically I could simply use a bit of AJAX and send everyauth.facebook.accessToken back to the server from the client but I feel like this is somewhat impractical.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Right now I have a model file and I created in it a ""todo"" entity with some different attributes (body, status , time etc), and im using core data to holds those todo's.</p>

<p>So I created a button to the ""History"" page which is a table view, and Now im trying to figure out how to keep the todo's that was marked done and populate the History page (table view) cells with this todo's.</p>

<p>So I thought that in the Home view controller I will create an NSMutableArray property called ""todos"", And ill create a method in the Home view controller .m file that is adding todos to the todos property, import the home view controller to the history table view controller and populate it's cells with the todos array property.</p>

<p>How bad is this solution? </p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>Fig1 showed the intensity profile of my laser profile. According to the laser intensity, I divide the profile into 2 region of interest (ROI1 and ROI2). </p>

<p>Fig2 showed the overlap of my exp result of positive responses and the laser intensity profile. The positive response data file is composed of x and y coordinates. As you can see the results are scattered over the laser profile image.</p>

<p>Here is what I want to do, I want to extract the spots within the ROI2 and discard all the rest as shown in Fig3. How can I do it? Specifically, how can I define a irregular shape ROI2 in matlab and extract the coordinates of positive response data.

<p>The problem is that when GPS sensor is working (to locate my position and translate it into the MapView), compass data gets so much interferences. And if I turn it off, compass works well again.</p>

<p>I'm using a low-pass filter, but interferences are bigger than 90º, so it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Tournoi is the name of a model</p>

<p>but when I write:</p>

<pre><code>org.user.has_perm('inscription.ecriture_Palaiseau')`

<p>it returns True</p>

<p>but when I rewrite:</p>

<p>it returns False</p>

<p>It is really weird. Why does it works like this?</p>

<p>In my views, it seems that the permissions are not removed even if I do write:</p>

<pre><code>org = Organisateur.objects.get(user__username__contains=""ghj"")

<p>(after removing the permission, the user still has it)</p>

<p>What I want to do is to remove a permission from an user and add another permission to the same user immediately after.
But each time I do that, the user still has the ""removed permission""......</p>

<p>My situation is more general and sort of simple:</p>

<p>iOS\Swift</p>

<p>I have a button which when clicked - moves the user to the next view. 
At the same time as the button is clicked it also executes a query to Parse to fetch the data which will be displayed on the next view.</p>

<p>I'm using Parse's async <code>query.getObjectInBackgroundWithId(""jjjkkkdddd"")</code></p>

<p>So if my code runs as is = click -> move to the next view -> empty
because fetching stuff takes a second or so.</p>

<p>What i want is to have a small animation popping up when user clicks a button to tell them that the data is being fetched at the moment and move to the next view once data arrives.</p>

<p>Here is my button tap code:</p>

<pre><code>override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject!) {

if (segue.identifier == ""1"") {

     var svc = segue.destinationViewController as ViewControllerQuotes;

     svc.toPass = functionToFetchDataFromParse() //&lt;- takes longer than    
                                                //switching to the next view
     //toPass is a var which lands into the next view 
     //and it's value is displayed to the user.

   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am quite fresh with Swift and iOS dev so I can't figure this one out still:(</p>

<p>I created a new MVC application in VS2013 and are now customizing it.
Currently I am writing the administrator area when I can modify a users properties.</p>

<p>The whole admin section is bound to an adminController. In this controller I create a new UserContext to access the user database.
However since the application already defines a user context in the AccountController this should not be necessary.</p>

<p>What would be best practice to access the UserContext in my AdminController?</p>

<p>/edit: In a comment I explained it a bit more in detail:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The data-context and the connection to the database already exist. This is not the problem. My problem is, that I have an account controller which manages login, register, etc. This controller is instanstiated when the page loads. with that instance I also have a instance of the UserManager class. In my admin controller I want to use that instance of the UserManager class and not create a new one as I'm currently doing. Hope this explains it a bit better</p>
</blockquote>

<p>/edit2: As requested the code snippets. What I want to do is to take the UserContext instance from the AccountController class and use it in the AdminController class. I also might add that the connection to the database works fine. I can query everything. It's just that I'm reluctant to create another instance of the UserContext.</p>

    }

    public AccountController(UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; userManager)
    {
        UserManager = userManager;
    }

    public UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; UserManager { get; private set; }

    //
    // GET: /Account/Login
    [AllowAnonymous]
    public ActionResult Login(string returnUrl)
    {
        ViewBag.ReturnUrl = returnUrl;
        return View();
    }
    // Additional GET/POST/PUT/DELETE methods
</code></pre>

<p>AdminController.cs</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;The admin controller.&lt;/summary&gt;

{
    private UserContext userContext = new UserContext();

    public ActionResult Admin()
    {
        return this.View();
    }

    public ActionResult ManageUser()
    {
        var users = this.userContext.Users.ToList();

        return this.PartialView(users);

But the .dll is not suited for Silverlight so I can not do that. And I can't access the SOAP service because of cross-domain issues (I do not host it so a clientpolicy xml will not do).</p>

<p>So my solution is the include the .dll in a WCF enabled webservice in my own domain and let the Silverlight application call the webservice. This works.</p>

<p>Now to my problem: The client provided from the .dll referenced by my webservice has a .Connect() method so I have to save the state of the object. But can I do that? Proberly not because Silverlight is not supporting wsHttpBinding. I know I can access ASP Session variables but can I also do that out-of-browser? I can only figure out one solution to my problem and that is saving username/password in ASP Session and call the .Connect() method in each method. But that is really a bad solution.</p>

<p>Better ideas?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I don't think I have made myself clear and I apologise about that. My english is properly the main cause for that.</p>

<p>I have:</p>

<p>My Silverlight app which runs on a website and out-of-browser</p>

<p>My WCF Service which is hosted in the same domain.</p>

<p>A cross-domain webservice (I can't get access to store a cross domain policy file)</p>

<p>My WCF webservice provides a layer between my app and the cross-domain webservice because you can't add cross domain webservices without the policy file.</p>

<p>My webservice looks like this (in a abstract way):</p>

<pre><code>class MyWebService
{
   CrossDomainWebServiceClient client = new CrossDomainWebServiceClient();

   public void Connect(string username, string password)
   {
      client.Connect(username, password);
   }

   public object Foo()
   {
      //GetEmployees() do only work if I'm connected
      return client.GetEmployees(); 
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Foo() method do not work because it is session per call and not session per instance. I want this to work. So the client object need to be preserved for the next call. Session.required do not work in Silverlight because wsHttpBinding apparently is not supported.</p>

The way it is coded right now makes it so that when the form is submitted, it redirects to my backend php script to display the output.</p>

<p>What I want it to do is take this output from the backend script, and display it in a div on the page once the form has been submitted, without redirecting to another page. Here is the code as of right now:</p>

<p>Form and the div I want the results to go in</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;form method='post' action='serverManager.php' name='form1'&gt;
        &lt;input type='SUBMIT' value='GO' name='btnGo' onSubmit=document.form1.submit(); /&gt;
        &lt;input type='HIDDEN' name='ACTION' value='GO' /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;div id=""result""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Ajax call</p>

<pre><code>  $('input#btnGo').click( function() {
  $.ajax({
        url: 'serverManager.php',
        type: 'post',
        data: $('form#form1').serialize(),
        success: function(data) {
               $('#result').html(msg);
             }
   });
});
</code></pre>

<p>With this code it still redirects to the serverManager.php page with the job submission text on it. Any ideas how this can be fixed? I'm sure it's something that's not too difficult, but I've been stuck on this for quite a while now. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>How should I design the interface?
Is it bad design to pass callbacks? Doesn't feel OO to me</p>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>public int Subscribe(string code, DataUpdatedDelegate callback) 
{
    this.subscribers[subscriptionId] = callback;
    this.codeSubscribers[code].Add(subscriptionId);

     {
         DataUpdatedDelegate callback = this.subscribers[subId];
         callback(data);

<pre><code>public interface ISubscriber
{
    void ProcessData(Data data);

public int Register(ISubscriber subscriber)

<p>Oh, one more thing: This contact form came with a website template and within the contact.js I found this warning:
Usage Note:
    -----------
    Do not use both ajaxSubmit and ajaxForm on the same form.  These
    functions are mutually exclusive.  Use ajaxSubmit if you want
    to bind your own submit handler to the form. </p>

<p>What does that mean exactly? The contact.js contains code for both. Do I need to delete some of it to get it to work?</p>

The frameworks clients may use the code in multi-threaded context but the framework itself does not spawn Threads or use shared memory or locks/synchronization. I am seeing some multithreading issues in the client environment and looking for a deterministic multi-threading testing framework as the problem seems to be occuring in the third party framework.</p>

<p><strong>Tried so Far:</strong></p>

<p>1) Able to reproduce it in a few runs in the jmeter performance testing environment</p>

<p>2)Able to reproduce it in a not so consistent way by stress testing using the testng multithreading annotation.
(@Test(threadPoolSize = 10, invocationCount = 100,  timeOut = 10000))</p>

<p>Cons: This just executes the method in a threadpool and does not guarantee interleaving/static code analysis or provide a way to deterministically reproduce.</p>

<p>3) Tried Junit's ActiveTestSuite and @ConcurrentJunitRunner. Its similar to the testng annotation.</p>

<p>4) <a href=""http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/multithreadedtc/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">MultiThreadedTC</a> : seems to work well for lock/synchronization/shared memory based multithreading code</p>

<p>5) <a href=""http://groboutils.sourceforge.net/testing-junit/using_mtt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GroboUtils</a> Seems to oriented more towards testing/monitoring shared-memory </p>

<p>6) IBM ConTest seems to be licensed and there is no trial version for us to ensure that it fits our needs and ask our management to purchase it.</p>

<p>Any suggestions similar to Microsoft Chess or HelGrind/DRD for Java which could record specific thread inter-leavings through static code analysis or byte code instrumentation and replay for debugging purposes.?</p>

<p>I am also looking at integrating this tool to our unit test/build process to avoid future occurences of similar error.</p>

<p>My intention is to answer to the get message of my managed objects by reading the snmp data from a text file (updated over time).</p>

<p>I'm polling the responder using snmpB, drawing a graph of the polled object value evolution.</p>

<p>I've successfully modify the example exporting my first Managed Object, adding it with mibBuilder.exportSymbols() and retrieving the values from the txt file in the modified getvalue method. I'm able to poll this object with success. It's a Counter32 type object.</p>

<p>The next step is handle other objects with a value type different from the ""supported"" classes like Integer32, Counter32, OctetString</p>

<p>I need to handle floating point values or other specific data formats defined within MIB files, because snmpB expect these specific formats for correctly plotting the graph.

Well we all know that scatterlists are primarily for DMA, where each scatter-gather (sg) array element describes a chunk of memory and those chunks are discontiguous in their physical addresses.</p>

<p>I'm writing a block device driver.  Suppose I receive struct requests from my request_queue, and I want to do something with the I/O data that my request is holding, like <code>memcpy</code>ing them to somewhere.  That operation will need a virtual address and length parameter.  Now all I know is that I can access the request's data via the scatterlist mapped through the helper function <code>blk_map_rq_sg()</code>.  Is my assumption correct, that those sg elements are contiguous in virtual, and that I can get the data address via <code>sg_virt()</code>, and use that address and total length for <code>memcpy</code>?  Or they are discontiguous in virtual, and I have to walk through each sg array element and <code>memcpy</code> to/from each sg memory chunk (in virtual) which is harder?</p>

<p>This is the outline of my task. I should write a Perl subroutine that gets a reference to a hash of hashes.</p>

<p>I have another sub (<code>helper</code>) that gets a single inner hash and does some stuff to with, including adding keys.</p>

<pre><code>sub helper {
    $href = shift;
    $href-&gt;{NEW_KEY}=1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since each of the internal hashes is independent of the others, I would like to use multi-threading to call <code>helper</code>.</p>

<p>I'm using <a href=""http://p3rl.org/Thread%3a%3aPool%3a%3aSimple"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Thread::Pool::Simple</code></a> which almost lacks any documentation. <a href=""http://p3rl.org/Thread%3a%3aPool"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Thread::Pool</code></a> is not supported by my Perl version.</p>

<p>So I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>sub my_sub {
    $hohref = shift;

    # create thread pool
    my $pool = Thread::Pool::Simple-&gt;new(
        do  =&gt; [ \&amp;helper ]
    );

    # submit jobs
    foreach my $hashref ( values %{$hohref} ) {
        $pool-&gt;add( $hashref );
    }

    # wait for all threads to end
    $pool-&gt;join();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The key point is that I would like the main hash of hashes to reflect all the changes made to the inner hashes.</p>

<p><code>my_sub</code> gets an unshared reference to <code>$hohref</code> so I tried creating a shared copy in the body of <code>my_sub</code>:</p>

<pre><code>my $shared_hohref = shared_clone $hohref;
</code></pre>

<p>use it and return it instead, but still, the internal hashes were not updated.</p>

<p>When I use the exact same code, but simply replace all the thread pool block with a simple loop</p>

<pre><code>foreach my $hashref ( values %{$hohref} ) {
    helper( $hashref );
}
</code></pre>

<p>then everything works fine.</p>

<p>Your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>See this runnable example:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;

use threads;
use threads::shared;

use Thread::Pool::Simple;
use 5.010;

use Data::Dumper;

sub helper {
    say ""helper starts"";
    my $href  = shift;
    say ""href is $href"";
    $href-&gt;{NEW_KEY} = 1;
    say ""helper ends with $href"";
}


sub my_sub {
    my $hohref = shift;

    my $shared_hohref = shared_clone $hohref;
    my $pool = Thread::Pool::Simple-&gt;new( do =&gt; [\&amp;helper] );

    # submit jobs
    foreach my $hashref ( values %{$shared_hohref} ) {
        say ""adding to pool: $hashref"";
        $pool-&gt;add($hashref);
    }

    # wait for all threads to end
    $pool-&gt;join();

    return $shared_hohref;
}

my $hoh = {
    A =&gt; { NAME =&gt; ""a"" },
    B =&gt; { NAME =&gt; ""bb"" }
};

say ""1\t"", Dumper $hoh;
my $updated_hoh = my_sub($hoh);

<p>I am having a hard time getting a simple version of this working and am not sure I understand everything. First, I loaded all the scripts provided in the gist, then set up a really simple nav and content section:</p>

&lt;div id=""content""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<pre><code>/* Application Specific Variables */
contentSelector = '#content',
$content = $(contentSelector),
contentNode = $content.get(0),
$menu = $('#nav'),
activeClass = 'active',
activeSelector = '.active',
menuChildrenSelector = 'li',
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm supposed to do next is where I get lost. All I want to do is load in html content specific to the nav link selected. So if I clicked ""Work"", I would like to load a work.html file into the content section and change the url to ""mywebsite.com/work"". To keep things easy lets say work.html and all other ajaxable content is located in the same directory.</p>

<p>I am currently working with the <a href=""http://blackberry.github.io/Cascades-Samples/mapview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">sample map view</a>, the app alone works great, but after I try to put this sample together with a navigation panel, it stopped working. </p>

<p>I have added my own main.qml, another page called menu.qml, and renamed the app's original main.qml to map.qml. So now user would require to navigate the panel like this: main.qml -> menu.qml -> map.qml</p>

<p>My problem is: 
Originally, from the sample, app constructor saves a mapView pointer when it creates main.qml so later it can add markers/change location to the mapview.</p>

<p>It gets mapView pointer by calling:</p>

<pre><code>QmlDocument *qml = QmlDocument::create(""asset:///main.qml"").parent(this);
qml-&gt;setContextProperty(""_mapViewTest"", this);
AbstractPane *root = qml-&gt;createRootObject&lt;AbstractPane&gt;();
QObject* mapViewAsQObject = root-&gt;findChild&lt;QObject*&gt;(QString(""mapViewObj""));
mapView = qobject_cast&lt;bb::cascades::maps::MapView*&gt;(mapViewAsQObject);
</code></pre>

<p>However, I have changed the name to map.qml, findChild returned as null. Since my app is unable to find mapView, the whole app crushes when I try to set a marker/locate myself.</p>

<p>I tried to QmlDocument::create(""asset:///map.qml""), and use the same method as above to find the mapview, and I was able to get it, but nothing happens when I try to put down a marker/locate.</p>

<p>I have also tried to add a new function that calls findChild and get the mapView pointer. The function gets called in onCreationCompleted inside the map.qml page, but mapViewAsQObject still returned null and app crushed.  </p>

<p>Any hints would be really appreciated! Thanks</p>

<p>I have a legacy Delphi 7 program with both SQLDataSet and ClientDataSet fields set at design time (in order to override various properties).</p>

<p>These are connected to a 3rd-party Sybase SQL Anywhere 11 database.</p>

<p>Recently the vendor changed all 'Description' fields from VarChar(128) to long varchar, but only for certain of his customers. So, my code has to support both types of fields when I query on these 'Description' fields.</p>

<p>Mucking through the errors, you find out that you can make it work by defaulting the template argument, and then default-constructing the argument thereafter:</p>

<pre><code>// Works! But the syntax is strange... potential ramifications/deduction mishaps?
// Is this the ""proper"" way to default these arguments?

<p>Is this the ""proper"" way to be handling this? What should be the syntax I use? Are there multiple ways to have the desired effect of ""defaulted forwarded references""?

<p>I have a general design problem with iPhone application.
I want to know the main principle how to go from normal view with navigationController to tabBarController with tabs where each tab has it's own navigationController (dont need first navigationController any more).</p>

<p>Let me show you how I made this:</p>

<p>First I added some view with a button to navigationController. AppDelegate adds this navigationController (with view controller of course) as subView to window:</p>

<pre><code>[window addSubview:navigationController.view];
</code></pre>

<p>When I get to that new view (with navigationController on top) I click on button that takes me to new view which has tabBarController (with his own navControllers):</p>

<pre><code>SearchViewController *searchViewController = [[SearchViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""SearchView_iPhone"" bundle:nil];
searchViewController.tabBarItem.title = @""FirstTab"";
UINavigationController *searchNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:searchViewController];

SettingsViewController *settingsViewController = [[SettingsViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""SettingsView_iPhone"" bundle:nil];
settingsViewController.tabBarItem.title = @""SecondTab"";
UINavigationController *settingsNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:settingsViewController];

//Add navigation controllers to tabBar controller
tabBarController = [[UITabBarController alloc] init];
tabBarController.viewControllers = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:searchNavigationController, dictionariesNavigationController, settingsNavigationController, nil];

<p>Ok, I added all views (with navControllers) to tabBarController. All I have to do is to push tabBarController to be seen:</p>

<pre><code>[self.navigationController pushViewController:tabBarController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>But after that I see that navigationController from first view is still present on views with tabBars. This is logical, because I pushed tabBarController with navigationController. So I did this to hide it:</p>

<pre><code>self.navigationController.navigationBarHidden = YES;
</code></pre>

<p>Now it looks ok. All of the tabBar views has it's own navController.</p>

<p>THE MAIN PROBLEM: When I want to push another view (settingsResultsViewController) from subviewed table (settingsTableViewCell) which is in settingsViewController nothing happens. Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>SettingsResultsViewController *settingsResultsViewController = [[SettingsResultsViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""SettingsResultsView_iPhone"" bundle:nil];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:settingsResultsViewController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried to push this view with appDelegate like this:</p>

<pre><code>[delegatePhone.settingsViewController.navigationController pushViewController:settingsResultsViewController animated:YES];
[delegatePhone.firstViewController.navigationController pushViewController:settingsResultsViewController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>But again nothing happens.</p>

<p>I assume that the main problem is in navigationControllers. The first navigationController is still somewhere in the back while I want to push with current navController on that particular tabBar.</p>

<p>Is there a way to push new view (tabBarController in my case) from first view other than with navigationController ?</p>

<p>All I want is when the button on firstView is clicke that app takes me to tabBarController and forget about firstView (and first navigationController) at all - I dont need them any more.</p>

<p>Hope I made it clear.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your help. I really appriciate it.</p>

<li><p>First, I noted that the download is a .vmdk file. Of course, this suffix is for VMWare, so that was a bit odd.  </p></li>
<li><p>Luckily, I found a tutorial on how to convert the cloudera vmdk into a virtual box file here : <a href=""http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-convert-vmware-image-to-virtualbox-image.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-convert-vmware-image-to-virtualbox-image.html</a>.  However, when I tried to convert the vmdk file to a virtual box file by using  convertdd, and ultimately got a message that ""Failed to write to disk image ""cdh.vdi"" VERR_DISK_FULL"" </p></li>
<li><p>So my question is , how do you run the Cloudera Hadoop VM in vbox ?

I only get ""remove"" and ""refresh"" options in my VBox disk manager.  </p></li>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A surprising thing is that looking closely at the data using Audacity shows the repeating parts are very very similar but not identical. Since FLAC (the format I use for encoding the audio) is a loss-less compression, I guess this is not a bug in the streaming/encoding but the problem originates at the data that comes from the microphone!</p>

Problem is that the changed function is not loaded by the <code>mgcv</code> package. The <code>mgcv</code> package loads termplot from the stats package in its namespace, using <code>importFrom()</code> in the NAMESPACE file.</p>

<p>How can I convince mgcv to use the changed termplot? I tried :</p>

<pre><code>unlockBinding(""termplot"", as.environment(""package:stats""))
assign(""termplot"", my.termplot, as.environment(""package:stats""))
lockBinding(""termplot"", as.environment(""package:stats""))
</code></pre>

<p>and when applied to lm-objects, this works and the altered termplot is used. But when using gam-objects made by the mgcv package, this doesn't work. I'm not really going to build the stats package from source if I can avoid it...</p>

<p>To clarify, I also tried with </p>

<pre><code>assignInNamespace(""termplot"", my.termplot, ns=""stats"")
assignInNamespace(""termplot"", my.termplot, ns=""mgcv"")
</code></pre>

<p>in all possible combinations, before attaching mgcv, after attaching mgcv, and I didn't manage to get it working.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT :</p>

<p>I tried all options given here (apart from rebuilding either package), and couldn't get it to work. The easy way out for me is using a wrapper function. That discussion can be found <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-June/061197.html"">here</a>. Thanks for all the tips.</p>

<hr>

<p>A reproducible example :</p>

<pre><code>my.termplot &lt;- function (x) print(""my new termplot"")

  unlockBinding(""termplot"", as.environment(""package:stats""))
  assignInNamespace(""termplot"", my.termplot, ns=""stats"", envir=as.environment(""package:stats""))
  assign(""termplot"", my.termplot, as.environment(""package:stats""))
  lockBinding(""termplot"", as.environment(""package:stats""))


y &lt;- 1:10
x &lt;- 1:10
xx &lt;- lm(y~x)
termplot(xx)
require(mgcv)
dat &lt;- gamSim(1, n = 400, dist = ""normal"", scale = 2)
b &lt;- gam(y ~ s(x0) + s(x1) + s(x2) + x3, data = dat)
plot(b,all=TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p><code>plot.gam</code> calls termplot for the non-smooth terms (x3 in this case), but fails to find the new termplot function.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT2 : apparently, my example works. I see now I solved my own question: In the first code, I didn't add both the namespace and the package in assignInNamespace. It is important to remember to change the function both in the namespace and the package before loading the other package. Thx @hadley for pointing me in the right direction, @Marek for testing the code and reporting it works, and the rest for taking the effort to answer.</p>

<p>In my model I have:</p>

<pre><code>class Board
  include Mongoid::Document

  attr_accessible :title

  field :title, :type =&gt; String

  #has_and_belongs_to_many :users
  embeds_many :items
end
</code></pre>

<p>when I call</p>

<pre><code>Board.all
</code></pre>

<p>it returns the whole collection, including also :items.</p>

<p>I've read in many articles/forums that using MongoDB embedded relations should be preferred over referenced ones but I have some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What about performaces? each time i want to retrieve a board i'll also retrieve items inside it: it may be useful sometimes but in the case i want only board's information and not items inside it I should create a new method for not retrieving items.</li>
<li>When I want to update an item the DB will reload the whole document and not only the item I want to retrive, right?</li>
</ul>

<p>Up to now I've noticed that the only advantage in using embedded document is for something like what in SQL are called ""joins"" but I also see a lot of performaces problem, there are important reason to use embedded relations over referenced relations?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>As pointed out by Adam C my thoughts are releated to situations like these:</p>

<p>as explained before I will have Boards each one with many Items inside it and using Rails scaffolding it generates methods that retrieve the whole Board document from the database but many times (for example when editing a Board) i want to load the document without the Items part.</p>

<p>Since I will be using mostly JSON calls my idea was to add an optional parameter to the url like ""?get_items"" to be set to TRUE in case I want also to get items, in other situations I would use Mongoid's:</p>

<pre><code>Model.without
</code></pre>

<p>For example let's take the index action:</p>

<pre><code>  def index
    @boards = Board.all

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # index.html.erb
      format.json { render json: @boards }
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>I'll need to get only fields specified in Board Model (in that case only :title) without items so I may use:</p>

<pre><code>  def index
    @boards = Board.without :items

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # index.html.erb
      format.json { render json: @boards }
    end
  end

The ScatterChart is <strong>placed within a ScrollPane</strong> so that the user can zoom and pan the timeline. 
To display the line indicating the player position I need the <strong>coordinates of the start and the end</strong> of the timeline, so that I could add a Line to the Pane in the background of the chart.
I can't seem to get the coordinates of the origin, no matter what I try.<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pv6Ri.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

I am trying to achieve a little animation effect in my simple application, using this time an UIPickerView object.</p>

<p>Basically, when a certain event occurs, I wish my picker view to animate itself selecting its last row (with animation, of course) and immediately after (without any further user interaction) its first row (with animation, of course). This, to give an 'application got crazy' effect which is supposed to be really really witty, I guess.</p>

<p>Therefore my code was:</p>

<pre><code>[myPicker selectRow:[myPicker numberOfRowsInComponent:0]-1 inComponent:0 animated:YES];
[myPicker selectRow: 0 inComponent:0 animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>And what I got is that the picker will execute only the second instruction no matter the row specified within it. It seems to ignore the first one.</p>

<p>I thought it could be for some 'clever' function of the compiler which notes that two following instructions perform an assignment to the same variable, therefore is better to ignore the first one (not considering the 'ANIMATED' factor).
I don't know if it is the case but I tried to move these two instructions within two if statements based on value of some parameter, trying this way to fool the compiler (which cannot know at compile time the value of that parameters, therefore it is not supposed to perform such an optimization).
It didn't work, either because I am completely out of trace or because the compiler is far more clever than me.
I even thought it could be a problem of delays and correct sequence of events therefore I tried to rewrite the code as follow</p>

<pre><code>-(void) setPickerRowToLastRow;
 {
     [myPicker selectRow:[myPicker numberOfRowsInComponent:0]-1 inComponent:0 animated:YES];
 }
 -(void) setPickerRowToFirstRow;
{
    [myPicker selectRow:0 inComponent:0 animated:YES];
}
                      .....
[self performSelector: @selector(setPickerRowToLastRow)
                     withObject: nil
                     afterDelay: 1];
[self performSelector: @selector(setPickerRowToFirstRow)
               withObject: nil
               afterDelay: 1];
</code></pre>

<p>And it didn't work: the picker still performs just the second action and it will move just once.</p>

<p>And now the question(s):</p>

<p>Why does the picker move just once?</p>

<p>How can I reach my goal (even if maybe a bit trivial)?</p>

<p>I'm currently developing a single-page document class for some kind of flyers which should be generated automatically. Unfortunately the limited amount of space doesn't make it possible to display everything on the page, so I need to skip some articles completely (I don't want only one half of a article printed on the flyer).</p>

<p>In pseudo code, thats the command I am looking for:</p>

<pre><code>\if_sufficient_vspace_left
    {&lt;big block/minipage with an article&gt;}
    {&lt;otherwise do nothing or something else&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p>And the use cases are:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is enough vertical space for the following article left on the page, print the article completely. Otherwise add only the headline to an »Other Articles« list.</li>
<li>If there is enough vertical space left, add a big advertisement, otherwise add a smaller one or do nothing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am quite sure that there will be a way to obtain this. For example, the TeX command <code>\leaders</code>, which works in vertical and horizontal mode, only inserts the leader if there is enough space left. Unfortunately I don't want to repeat anything, and an else action might be great too.</p>

<p>Any keywords and tips to useful commands will be appreciated. You don't have to post complete solutions (but you can of course).</p>

<p>Many thanks,<br />

<p>So i have all the page specific scripting in one js that is loaded once from the index.html which always remains in the DOM.</p>

<p>So for example i have handlers like: </p>

<p>When you start navigating the app everything is okey until you hit f5 or browsers refresh button. </p>

<p>This so called full-refresh won't load my central js file, also the needed jquery-mobile resources from the head of index.html (js &amp; css) are lost.</p>

<p>Due to this it's obvious where the problem lies. When i hit refresh from index.html then everything works fine.</p>

Python 2.7.5, when using descriptors as decorators, is there any way to pass in arguments (to the <code>__init__</code> method)?
OR
How can I get access to a class instance's attributes using a method decorator with arguments (<a href=""https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=240845"" rel=""nofollow"">as here</a>)? -- I believe this is not possible, though, hence the focus below on descriptors...</p>

<hr>

<p>Long version</p>

<p>I have a class of objects, with different ""type"" attributes. Based on an instance's ""type"", I would like a method to be available or not. I know one way is to create multiple classes, but I'm trying to not have a bunch of if / else statements when creating these objects. For example, I have two objects A and B that are almost identical, except object B I don't want to have the <code>get_start_date()</code> method available. So essentially, what I want is that both A and B are instances of class MyObjects, but have a ""type"" attribute that is different.</p>

<pre><code>type(A) == type(B)
A.genus_type != B.genus_type
</code></pre>

<p>I would use that <code>.genus_type</code> attribute to differentiate which methods are allowable and which ones not...</p>

<p>I was thinking I could use decorators with a whitelist, like:</p>

<pre><code>def valid_for(whitelist):
    def wrap(f):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
return wrap

class A(object):
    @valid_for(['typeB'])
    def do_something_cool(self):
        print 'blah'
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem was I did not have access to the actual class instance in the decorator, where I could test for the instance type attribute. Based on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2366713/can-a-python-decorator-of-an-instance-method-access-the-class"">this SO question</a>, I thought, ""I can use descriptors!"".</p>

<p>So I then tried:</p>

<pre><code>class valid_for(object):
    """""" descriptor to check the type of an item, to see
    if the method is valid for that type""""""
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.f = func

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        def wrapper(*args):
            return self.f(instance, *args)
        return wrapper
</code></pre>

<p>But then I couldn't figure out how to get the <code>['typeB']</code> parameter passed into the descriptor...by default, Python passes in the called method as the argument to <code>__init__</code>. I could create hard-coded descriptors for each type and nest them, but then I wonder if I will run into <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15581288/nesting-descriptors-decorators-in-python"">this problem</a>. Assuming I could overcome the nesting issue, it also seems less clean to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    @valid_for_type_b
    @valid_for_type_f
    @valid_for_type_g
    def do_something_cool(self):
        print 'blah'
</code></pre>

<p>Doing something like this just made my <code>func</code> equal to the list <code>['typeB']</code>...</p>

<pre><code>class valid_for(object):
    """""" descriptor to check the type of an item, to see
    if the method is valid for that type""""""
    def __init__(self, func, *args):
        self.f = func

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        def wrapper(*args):
            return self.f(instance, *args)
        return wrapper

class A(object):
    @valid_for(['typeB'])
    def do_something_cool(self):
        print 'blah'
</code></pre>

<p>And my <code>func</code> is not in the <code>*args</code> list, so I can't just do a simple swap of arguments (<code>*args</code> is empty).</p>

<p>I've been looking for hints <a href=""https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=240845"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#implementing-descriptors"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, but haven't found anything that seems like a clean or valid workaround. Is there a clean way to do this, or do I have to use multiple classes and just mix-in the various methods? Or, right now I am leaning towards an instance method that checks, but that seems less clean and reusable...</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    def _valid_for(self, whitelist):
        if self.genus_type not in whitelist:
            raise Exception

    def do_something_cool(self):
        self._valid_for(['foo'])
        print 'blah'
</code></pre>

<p>I am using Python 2.7.5.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE 1</p>

<p>Per a suggestion in the comments, I tried:</p>

<pre><code>def valid_for2(whitelist):
    def wrap(f):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            import pdb
            pdb.set_trace()
            print args[0].genus_type
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return wrap
</code></pre>

<p>But at this point, args[0]. just returns the args:</p>

<pre><code>(Pdb) args[0]
args = (&lt;FormRecord object at 0x112f824d0&gt;,)
kwargs = {}
(Pdb) args[0].genus_type
args = (&lt;FormRecord object at 0x112f824d0&gt;,)
kwargs = {}
</code></pre>

<p>However, using <code>functools</code> as suggested does work -- so I will award the answer. There seems to be some black magic in <code>functools</code> that lets the arguments in?</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE 2</p>

<p>So investigating jonrsharpe's suggestion more, his method also seems to work, but I have to explicitly use <code>self</code> instead of <code>args[0]</code>. Not sure why the behavior is different...</p>

<pre><code>def valid_for2(whitelist):
    def wrap(f):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            print self.genus_type
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return wrap
</code></pre>

<p>results in the same output as with <code>functools</code>.
Thanks!</p>

If the file has <code>CRLF</code> endings, the output file should also have that. My problem is in writing the line ending especially with the <code>CLISP</code> implementation(it works with <code>gcl</code>). When I try to write a linefeed character(<code>LF</code>), the file ends up having <code>CRLF</code> endings. I'm guessing this is something to do with <code>CLISP</code>'s implementation.<br>
I need a way to <code>write the file in binary mode</code> like in other langauages. The standard I/O functions in the specification only take an optional stream name and the content to be written.  </p>

<p>You can reproduce that behaviour with something like this:</p>

<p>When i press a button, a new Intent opens and surfaceDestroyed sets a boolean to set the thread sleeping.
When i return the thread gets a notify signal.</p>

<p>This works in about 90% of the time (and 100% when i debug with eclipse).</p>

<p>I believe the deadlock takes place in the run function of the thread (two synchronized). The problem is, wait() needs a synchronized of the thread and ondraw() needs the lock on the surfaceholder.</p>

<p>In SQL Server I've used CTEs to successfully recurse through an adjacency list table structure to produce the desired result set.  From what I can tell so far with MySQL, it does not support CTEs.  I've got a fairly simple table structure to hold my hierarchy (written in SQL Server syntax b/c of my familiarity with it):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE TreeNodes (
    NodeId int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ParentNodeId int NULL,
    Name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    FullPathName varchar(MAX) NOT NULL,  -- '/' delimited names from root to current node
    IsLeaf bit NOT NULL  -- is this node a leaf?
)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side Note</strong>: I realize that FullPathName and IsLeaf are not required and could be determined at query time, but the insert of a tree node will be a very uncommon occurrence as opposed to the queries against this table - which is why I plan to compute those two values as part of the insert SP (will make the queries that need those two values less costly).</p>

<p>With CTE (in SQL Server), I would have a function like the following to find leaf nodes of current node:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION fn_GetLeafNodesBelowNode (
    @TreeNodeId int
)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
WITH Tree (NodeId, Name, FullPathName, IsLeaf)
AS (
    SELECT NodeId, Name, FullPathName, IsLeaf FROM TreeNodes WHERE NodeId = @TreeNodeId
        UNION ALL
    SELECT c.NodeId, c.Name, c.FullPathName, c.IsLeaf FROM Tree t
        INNER JOIN TreeNodes c ON t.NodeId = c.ParentNodeId
)
SELECT * FROM Tree WHERE IsLeaf = 1

<p>Update:
I figure out this problem, we need using natural_key(), and overrive this method in user manager class, add next code to models.py:</p>

<pre><code>class UserManager(models.Manager):
    def unatural_key(self):
        return self.username
    User.natural_key = unatural_key
</code></pre>

<p>And dont forget add argument <code>use_natural_keys=True</code> to serializers.serialize()</p>

<p>The input fields are validated using jQuery validator and everything works as it should.

Something like, when the component is not focused it shows Username with different letter style like Italic for example. So when you press on the textInput it disappears and will only show again if there is no text. It sounds like something that I could easily code. But there must be something done for it already.

The content of the pop-ups can change so I need to adapt the size of the pop-up to the content.
I was initially setting the height of the pop-up on creation, but then the content would show outside it if bigger.
Removing the setHeight, the pop-up actually adapts itself to the content, but I'm having problems centering the pop-up.
When the content changes I call popup.center(), but it is not really being centered as when I set manually the height.</p>

<p>I think it's a timing problem, because I have added a listener to center the popup when the window is resized and in this case the pop-up is being properly centered.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>UPDATE: think I found the issue. The content of the pop-up includes a table. The ResizeEvent is fired BEFORE the content of the table is shown, so on centring is actually considering the size of an empty table.
I tried to add a LoadingStateChangeHandler to fire a ResizeEvent when the status is LOADED, but it's still firing too early.</p>

I'm at <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=23"" rel=""nofollow"">problem 23</a>. I know how to do it and I've done it before but it's not working right now and I've been trying to tackle it for so long, I can barely think straight. I'm using NodeJS this time around.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.math-magic.com/misc/pos_int_div2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this really simplified article</a>, I can use the prime factorization to figure out the sum of a number's divisors. So I have these two functions:</p>

<pre><code>Util.GetPrimeFactors = function (val) {
    var init = val;
    var num = 2;
    var primes = {};
    while (val &gt; 1) {
        if (val % num == 0) {
            if (num == init) return [];// prevent prime numbers from including themselves
            if (primes[num]) {
                primes[num]++;
            } else {
                primes[num] = 1;
            }
            val /= num;
        } else {
            num++;
        }
    }
    return primes;
}

Util.SumOfDivisors = function (val) {
    var primes = Util.GetPrimeFactors(val);
    var coeff = primes[0];
    var count = 0;
    var total = 1;
    for (var i in primes) {
        count++;
        if (primes[i] &gt; 1) {
            var n = parseInt((Math.pow(parseInt(i), primes[i] + 1) - 1) / (parseInt(i) - 1))
            console.log(n);
            total *= n;
        } else {
            var n = parseInt(i) + 1
            console.log(n);
            total *= n;
        }
    }
    if (count == 1) return 1;
    return total;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I call <code>GetPrimeFactors(12)</code> I get this object: <code>{ '2': 2, '3': 1 }</code> which represents <code>2^2+3</code>, the name is the base value and the value is the exponent. <code>SumOfDivisors</code> uses that object to do the math in the above linked article. The problem is that according to the Project Euler problem, 12 is the first abundant number. If I run 6 through <code>SumOfDivisors</code>, I get the proper prime factors (the object <code>{ '2': 1, '3': 1 }</code>) but it results in SumOfDivisors returning 12 making 6 look abundant. If you add up factors the inefficient way (bullet B in the math article) then you obviously get the factors 1, 2, and 3 which makes 6 a perfect number.</p>

<p>I remember in my old C# code that I used this same technique: finding primes and using them to sum divisors. But I didn't have this problem with 6 (and probably many more numbers). I'm at a lose for what I'm doing wrong here. What am I doing wrong when I'm finding the sum of divisors? Is this technique known not to work for certain values? Am I glazing over a special case? Am I snagged on a Javascript gotcha?</p>

<p>Areas table already have some data with row id's ranging from 1 to 50.</p>

<p>I want to populate the Readings table with some sample data - (random float values for 'Reading' column between 1.0 and 100.0  AND a random datetime value for ReadingDateTime between a given DateTime range; for example between current datetime and a datetime 3 months back).  These values should be inserted to the Reading table by <strong>randomly</strong> selecting AreaKeys which already exist in the Areas table.</p>

<p><br/> In other words I want to insert random reading values to randomly selected areas, with random datetimes.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me a clue on how to do this?</p>

<p>My main query is:</p>

<pre><code>           create table new_depts as
           select d.department_id,d.department_name,sum(e.salary) dept_sal
           from employees e,departments d
           where e.department_id = d.department_id;

<p>I got an Error:</p>

<pre><code>           select d.department_id,d.department_name,sum(e.salary) dept_sal

</code></pre>

<p>So, I googled it. I found that group function like sum, avg, max, min can't be used in select statement. I needed GROUP BY clause. So, I wanted to solve it individually. Therefore, I skipped the ""create table..."" statement and wrote:</p>

<pre><code>           select distinct d.department_id,d.department_name,sum(e.salary) dept_sal
           from employees e,departments d
           where e.department_id = d.department_id
           group by department_id;

<p>I got Error: </p>

<p>Then I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>           select d.department_id,d.department_name,sum(e.salary) dept_sal
           from employees e,departments d
           where e.department_id = d.department_id
           group by d.department_id;

<p>I got Error:</p>

<pre><code>           select d.department_id,d.department_name,sum(e.salary) dept_sal

<p>Then I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>           select d.department_id,d.department_name,sum(e.salary) dept_sal
           from employees e,departments d
           where e.department_id = d.department_id

However, that API is <a href=""http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.31/glib-Deprecated-Thread-APIs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">deprecated as of 2.32</a> and I can't find any info on setting thread priorities using the new API. I've Ctrl+F'd through all thread-related sections in the <a href=""http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.32/"" rel=""nofollow"">API refrence</a> and found nothing priority-related. Google also doesn't seem to know anything.</p>

<p>So is assigning priority to a thread possible in the 2.32 API at all? If yes, how to do it on creation and is it possible to change it after the thread is created? I know at that pthread supports all this, but I'd prefer to stick to the platform-independent Glib API.</p>

<p>By using logic that checks to see if today is 03/01/2014. If not, I want it to do two things (eventually producing a new 14 day range like ""03/15/2014 - 03/28/2014"":
*Add 1 day to the existing second date and redefine this day as the new first date in the string.
*Add 13 days to the new first date and redefine it as the new second date in the string.</p>

<p>So, the with every ActiveX Button click, the string  FirstDate&amp;"" - ""&amp;SecondDate    will read:</p>

<p>03/01/2014 - 03/14/2014</p>

<p>03/15/2014 - 03/28/2014</p>

<p>03/29/2014 - 04/11/2014</p>

<p>04/12/2014 - 04/25/2014  and so on...</p>

<p>And that string will be placed in cell B3 to read ""03/01/2014 - 03/14/2014""</p>

<p>So far, I've tried..</p>

<pre><code>Sub CommandButton1_Click()

    Dim SecondDate As Date

    If Date = CDate(""03/01/2014"") Then
         FirstDate = Date
         SecondDate = DateAdd(d, 13, FirstDate)
         Range(""B3"") = CDate(FirstDate&amp;"" - ""&amp;SecondDate)
    Else
         FirstDate = DateAdd(d, 1, SecondDate)

Specially with mobile devices where my page content goes vertically responsive.</p>

<p>Please look at the following HTML page code. I will request that pls see this page in mobile resolution. Copy and paste this HTML code in a file and save it with .html extension and open into browser will recommend firefox.
After opening into the browser please use ""ctrl + shift + m"" to see the page with small resolution. Now scroll to travel the users list you can use mouse scroll or swipe, but after reaching to the users list end i.e. user 50 i want that other section of a page should be scroll.</p>

<p>Student A is enrolled in Course 1, 2</p>

<p>Student B is enrolled in Course 1, 2, 3</p>

<p>Student C is enrolled in Course 2</p>

<p>So there are two kinds of events:</p>

<p>Student A is deleted -> need to notify two objects: Course 1 and Course 2 </p>

<p>Course 1 is canceled -> need to notify two objects: Student A and Student B</p>

<p>I know that the Observer pattern can work if each Student can be only enrolled in 1 Course, in which case I have a list of Student for each Course object in the Observer Pattern.</p>

<p>I am wondering if I should do some two way Observer Pattern (Student keeps a list of Courses and the Course also keeps a list of students). So would be a good way to deal with this problem? Main concern is speed/space tradeoff (what I can think of at best now is a two way hash/tree from 1 Student to 1 set of Courses and 1 Course to 1 set of Students). Any pointer will be appreciated!! </p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>mWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webView);
mWebView.setWebChromeClient(new KB_WebChromeClient(this));
mWebView.setWebViewClient(new KB_WebViewClient());
mWebView.setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION);
mWebView.clearCache(true);
mWebView.clearHistory();
mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically(true);
mWebView.addJavascriptInterface(new WebAppInterface(this, this), ""Android"");

mWebView.loadUrl(""file:///android_asset/check.html"");
</code></pre>

<p>The WebViewClient has the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public class KB_WebViewClient extends WebViewClient {

    @Override
    public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {
        super.onPageFinished(view, url);
        view.clearCache(true);
    }

    @Override
    public void onReceivedError (WebView view, int errorCode, String description, String failingUrl)
    {
        view.loadUrl(""file:///android_asset/check.html"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the <code>check.html</code> page is loaded, <code>onPageFinished</code> is called and then the html forwards to the other page, which is not working, so <code>onReceivedError</code> is called, which will start loading the <code>check.html</code> again aso.</p>

<p>On my research I found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17033438/android-expand-jni-local-reference-table"">SO: Android Expand JNI Local Reference Table</a>, where the answer is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to delete local references to classes as well as to objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does it mean and where is my problem? Does webview.loadUrl create anything complex and the Garbage Collector is not fast enough to clean up? I don't create the WebView all the time, so what is messing around?</p>

<p>Thanks for help in advance!</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I implemented a counter which counts how often the webview.loadUrl is called. It counts 280 to 290 before the app crashes. I tried to remove the <code>check.html</code> and just load my wanted webpage in the network, then the amount of tries goes up to 570 before crashing. It seams, that every webpage load is counted, even when it's done from the HTML page. I was having a look at the heap of the system and what I saw is that every time when one loop is done, there are 1 to 3 more byte[] arrays with 32kB size allocated and not freed. Even the Garbage Collection doesn't free it. I will try to get rid of the Webview every x tries. Maybe that workaround could work...</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Under the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=20686"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> they show that there is a bug:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems that there is a leakage in the external/webkit/Source/WebKit/android/WebCoreSupport/UrlInterceptResponse.cpp. <br/>
   <br/>
  if (!m_buffer) { <br/>
      m_buffer = env->NewByteArray(out->capacity()); <br/>
      m_buffer = (jbyteArray) env->NewGlobalRef(m_buffer); <br/>
  } <br/>
   <br/>
  A local reference is created by NewByteArray but it's not deleted. <br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that this could be related to my problem. I'm running Android 4.0.3 and I can't update, as it seems they fixed that problem....well well, I'll try to find a workaround.</p>

<p>... which is a <strong><em>static</em></strong> class and property.  Why would the compiler be giving me the blue squiggly and grousing about ""<code>Object reference not set to an instance of an object</code>""?  I am setting the DataContext to point to a <em>static</em> reference with the <code>{x:Static ...}</code> bit, am I not?</p>

<p>I'm sure I'm missing something simple here, but darned if I know what it is.</p>

<p>Where does static instance variables defined in a class are stored - in heap or in Permanent generation?</p>

<p>JLS(both pre java SE 7 and Java SE 7) says that:</p>

<pre><code>17.4.1   Shared Variables
Memory that can be shared between threads is called shared memory or heap
memory.
All instance fields, static fields and array elements are stored in heap memory.
</code></pre>

<p>BUT <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/122"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> post says that:</p>

<pre><code>Success Metrics
...
Class metadata, interned Strings and class static variables will be moved from the permanent generation to either the Java heap or native memory.
...

Description
...
Class metadata and statics are allocated in the permanent generation when a class is loaded and are garbage collected from the permanent generation when the class is unloaded. Interned Strings are also garbage collected when the permanent generation is GC’ed.
...
</code></pre>

<p>According to above post statics are in Permanent generation area.</p>

<p>Which is correct??</p>

<p>My cube's schema is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Cube cache=""true""
    defaultMeasure=""Value"" enabled=""true"" name=""mycube""&gt;
    &lt;Table name=""response"" schema=""public""/&gt;

            &lt;/Join&gt;
            &lt;!-- works fine with the category itself: &lt;Level column=""name"" type=""String"" name=""Category Name"" table=""category"" uniqueMembers=""true""/&gt; --&gt;

&lt;/Cube&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, based on the mondrian FoodMart test pages, I have set up a simple jsp pages for my cube, which I want to use as a starting point for my tests. It has the following MDX:</p>

<pre><code>select {[Measures].[Value]} ON COLUMNS,
 {( [Category] )} ON ROWS
from [mycube]
</code></pre>

<p>The result it shows at first is ""All Categories"". When I try to drill down or hierarchize in the Categories, it returns nothing but [All Categories]. I have tried also with Descendants() to no avail.
Equally, when I try to list the members of Categories, it returns nothing.</p>

<p>I see that in the background it runs a query as follows to start the drilling down:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>05/12/13 23:53:10,967 postgres: [3-1] LOG:  execute : select
  ""category"".""id"" as ""c0"", ""category"".""name_en"" as ""c1"" from ""question""
  as ""question"", ""category"" as ""category"" where ""question"".""category_id""
  = ""category"".""id"" and ""category"".""parent_id"" IS NULL group by ""category"".""id"", ""category"".""name_en"" order by ""category"".""id"" ASC
  NULLS LAST</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously this query has an empty result because it joins question with root-level categories whilst only the leaves of my tree are attached some Questions.
It also shows that the closure table is not used here.</p>

<p>Any clue on what I can do to fix this?</p>

<p>Thanks ahead

There is also a secondary timer in the child that prevents it from running for too long in the background, like so:</p>

<pre><code>Fork execution
In the fork's child:
    Start a thread to execute a task
        If that thread runs for longer than X milliseconds:
             thread.stop(), a custom method that softly stops the thread.
In the fork's parent:
    If the child's PID stays running for longer than Y milliseconds:
        return -1
    else:
        return 0
</code></pre>

<p>After returning a value, I want the script to terminate. The child can and should keep running if it isn't done.</p>

<p>The code I have tried (abbreviated) is:</p>

<pre><code>class MyCustomThread(threading.Thread):
    abort = False
    def run(self):
        counter = 0
        while True:
            if self.abort: break
            counter += 1
            if counter == 30: self.stop()
            sleep(1)
        return 0

    def stop(self):
        self.abort = True

def test():
    X = 2000
    Y = 500
    pid = os.fork()
    if pid == 0:
        thread1 = MyCustomThread() #Sleeps for 30 seconds and ends.
        thread1.start()
        print ""Started 1!""
        timeout = X # say, 1000ms
        while timeout &gt; 0:
            if not thread1.is_alive(): return ""custom thread finished before the deadline!""
            timeout -= 1
            sleep(0.001)
        if thread1.is_alive():
            return ""custom thread didn't finish before the deadline!""
            thread1.stop()
        exit()
    else:
        print pid
        thread2 = Thread(target = os.waitpid, args = (pid, 0))
        thread2.start()
        print ""Started 2!""
        timeout2 = Y # say, 500ms
        while timeout2 &gt; 0:
            if not thread2.is_alive(): return ""child PID finished!""
            timeout2 -= 1
            sleep(0.001)
        if thread2.is_alive():
            return ""child PID didn't finish yet!""
print test()
print ""all done!""
</code></pre>

<p>The output is correct, in that I get </p>

<pre><code>1171
Started 2!
Started 1!
child PID didn't finish yet!
all done!
custom thread didn't finish before the deadline!
all done!
</code></pre>

<p>But then the script doesn't exit! It sleeps for the remaining 28 seconds before  </p>

<p><strong>How do I make the main execution of this script complete after the <code>fork</code>ed parent returns a value?</strong> As I said before, the child can and should keep running in the background, it just shouldn't block execution of the next task on the parent. </p>

<p>I really don't even care if the child can print output to standard out--in the actual implementation, all it's doing is talking to a database, so it doesn't need to report anything interactively. The parent, however, needs to dispatch the child, wait <strong>at most</strong> Y seconds for the child to finish, and then (as far as whoever invoked the script is concerned) end the script's execution so that the next thing can be done. The other timer (X) isn't relevant, I think; it only exists to keep the child from running too long in the background.</p>

<p>Any ideas? I'm probably approaching this totally wrong, so ""start over and do it <em>_</em> way"" ideas are welcome.</p>

<p>As expected, since I'm using <code>appcompatv21</code>, I need to build it using build tools 21+.</p>

<p>When I build, I get more than 400 errors, all looking like these:</p>

We have a Location page that includes info about a location and a map of the location via the Google Maps API. (v2 - I know it's deprecated but I haven't justified the time to upgrade, ""if it ain't broke.."") I want to use a single column layout with basic information followed by the map followed by more information.</p>

<p>Now when I use my finger to scroll down the mobile page on an iPhone, once I get to the map, the page scrolling is overridden and the map starts panning. The only way for me to scroll farther down the page is to put my finger above or below the map, assuming such space is available. If I disable map dragging, then when I start scrolling down and get to the map it doesn't pan but the page doesn't scroll either. I would like to treat the map as a static image that I can scroll past, but still allow the zoom buttons and allow the map to be redrawn with directions through a select field I have coded, so a <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/"">literal static image</a> is not a solution.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5596781/google-maps-api-suppress-map-panning-to-enable-page-scrolling/5679949#5679949"">this post that required similar functionality</a>, but it's using v3. I think all I need to do is ""add touch events to the map container,"" but I'm not familiar with that part of javascript, and what I have below does not allow normal scrolling. Do I need to bite the bullet on v3, or do I have a bug on adding touch events that has a simple javascript correction to do what I want?</p>

<pre><code>function initialize() {
  if (GBrowserIsCompatible()) {
    map = new GMap2(document.getElementById(""map_canvas""));
    geocoder = new GClientGeocoder();
  }
}

function showAddress(address, zoom) {
//clipped... this part works fine
}

//These three lines create a map that my finger pans
initialize(); 
showAddress(""[clipped.. street, zip code]"");
map.addControl(new GSmallZoomControl3D());

//This stops the map pan but still prevents normal page finger scrolling
map.disableDragging();

//If done right could this allow normal page finger scrolling??
var dragFlag = false;
map.addEventListener(""touchstart"", function(e){
   dragFlag = true;
   start = (events == ""touch"") ? e.touches[0].pageY : e.clientY; 
},true);
map.addEventListener(""touchend"", function(){ 
dragFlag = false; 
}, true);
map.addEventListener(""touchmove"",function(
if ( !dragFlag ) return;
end = (events == ""touch"") ? e.touches[0].pageY : e.clientY;   
window.scrollBy( 0,( start - end ) ); 
}, true);

Most of the time this works, but for certain requests it won't, and I can't find out why. The failing requests take some seconds, and the data length is about 100 kB, but we're not talking about minutes or Megabytes here.</p>

<p>Strangely, the <code>ZServerHTTPResponse</code> object looks quite ok, but it arrives at the web client's side (Firefox, Firebug) as an empty string!</p>

<p>The toolchain looks like this:</p>

##bind subpath=traverse_subpath
##parameters=
##title=
##
thebrowser = context.getBrowser('thebrowser')
return thebrowser.get(thedict={'path':'/'.join(traverse_subpath)})
</code></pre>

<p>This makes requests to <code>/theservice/some/sub/path</code> work; <code>some/sub/path</code> is put in the <code>path</code> key.</p>

<p>The <code>get</code> method of <code>thebrowser</code> takes the <code>path</code> argument, does the general processing (sending a signed request to <a href=""https://remote.service.somewhere/some/sub/path"" rel=""nofollow"">https://remote.service.somewhere/some/sub/path</a>), feeds the XML response to the right transform method according to the <code>path</code>, and returns the response, which is used e.g. by a jquery accordion.</p>

<p>... which looks quite reasonable to me.  Anyway, for some requests (possibly those with big responses or longest processing times) the client browser sees an empty string.</p>

<p>Versions: Zope 2.10.13, Python 2.4.6 (64bit), Plone 3.3 (yes, we'll switch to Plone 4, but it will take some time...)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I thought my problem was solved when I fixed the <code>ElementTree</code> imports to make use of the compiled version:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    from celementtree import fromstring        # modern Python versions
except ImportError:
    try:
        from cElementTree import fromstring    # Python 2.4
    except ImportError:
        from elementtree import fromstring     # emergency fallback
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this worked for me, but not for the customer.</p>

<p>The Zope site is served in an Apache VirtualHost where the usual RewriteRule is active:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:8082/VirtualHostBase/http/%{HTTP_HOST}:80/theportalroot/VirtualHostRoot/$1 [L,P]
</code></pre>

<p>According to Firebug, there is no content-length header present (can this have been stripped by Apache?!). Here are the complete response headers:</p>

<pre><code>Connection          Keep-Alive

The one recommendation we've found that clearly applies for us is 'SET NOCOUNT ON' at the top of each procedure.  (Yes, I've seen the posts that point out issues with this depending on what client objects you run the stored procedures from but these are not issues for us.)</p>

<p>So now I'm just trying to add in a bit of common sense.  If the benefit of SET NOCOUNT ON is simply to reduce network traffic by some small amount every time, wouldn't it also make sense to turn off all the PRINT statements we have in the stored procedures that we only use for debugging?</p>

<p>I can't see how it can hurt performance. OTOH, it's a bit of a hassle to implement due to the fact that some of the print statements are the only thing within else clauses, so you can't just always comment out the one line and be done.  The change carries some amount of risk so I don't want to do it if it isn't going to actually help.</p>

<p>Lets say that I have a div that animates on page load and fades in, then at a later time I have another script that appends an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to the div.</p>

<p>I want the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> to be appended <em>after</em> the animation has completed in order to avoid any stuttering during the animation and to just make it look nicer.</p>

<p>Currently I know that I can write something like this (assuming I use animate.css):</p>

<p><strong>HTML:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""append-image-here animated fadeIn""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    'oanimationend',
    'animationend'
  ].join(' '), function() {
    $('&lt;img&gt;', { src: '/image.jpg' }).appendTo(this);
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is fine if the script runs before the animation completes and the <code>animationend</code> event fires, but if the script happens to run after the animation ends the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag will never be created and will never be appended to the div (for example if the handler was set in a timeout or something like that which ran past the animation duration).</p>

<p>Is there any way to detect if a CSS animation is currently running so the script can decide whether to wait for the <code>animationend</code> or not without having to rely on user added classes or data attributes?</p>

Lest imagine we have 3 boolean variable:</p>

<pre><code>boolean a = false;
boolean b = false;
boolean c = false;
</code></pre>

<p>Java allows to write the folowing:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(a=b);
System.out.println(a==b &amp; a==c);
</code></pre>

<p>And from this two statements I expected that the following is legal, too.</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(a=b &amp; a=c);
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: why in the second case it isn't allowed, when it is allowed in the first one? In the second case both assignments resolved in boolean and &amp; looks legal for me.</p>

<code>Project_name/src/test/*.cpp</code> 
and my includes in 
<code>Project_name/include/test/*.h</code></p>

<p>Some qt4 mocs must be created as some header files contain Q_OBJECT in their classes.</p>

<p>I tried the 
<code>set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)</code>
in the cmake file but as it seems it does not search the /include/test/ folder. AUTOMOC states that works either bu searching the source files for moc_<em>*</em>*.cpp files or by examining the header files for Q_OBJECT.</p>

<p>I also tried to include a <code>moc_***.cpp</code> in a source file (for example <code>/src/test/a.cpp</code>). So it searched for <code>a.h</code> but could not find it in <code>include/test/a.h</code>.</p>

<p>I must note that if I remove the Q_OBJECT from the classes the compilation succeeds, as the include/ folder is added like this:
<code>include_directories( include
    ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
</code></p>

<p>Finally I've tried to use QT4_WRAP_CPP but for some reason it couldn't find the mocs as well   and the link failed (although in another project with the same parameters in the cmake file works :/)</p>

<p><em><strong>Edit :</em></strong>
Found a solution. In added in the cpp file:</p>

<p><code>#include ""../../include/test/moc_a.cpp""</code></p>

<p>and found the .h in include/test.</p>

<p>Though something tells me that it is not the correct way :P</p>

I thought I'd come out the shadows and see if anyone is kind enough to help me with a specific problem I haven't been able to find the answer too on here or other sources about woocommerce.</p>

<p>I'm doing a home project for my brother in law whilst travelling to work on the train, but I'm struggling to get the WOOCOMMERCE product page within my site to look how I'd like it to look.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get the product summary information stretching across the screen to appear  above the product images with everything centered on the page.
So far I have used remove/add actions in the functions.php file to filter/order items to basically how I'd like them displayed. 
As a result in full screen mode it still looks the same, with images to the left of the summary info, but however in a narrower screen mode the summary info is above the images.  Any idea what that is all about?</p>

<p>You can see what I mean on my test domain > <a href=""http://cowbay.co.uk/?product=el-fregadero"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cowbay.co.uk/?product=el-fregadero</a></p>

<p>If I can achieve this, I'd then also like to remove the featured image and just have large thumbnails which can then bring up the lightbox when clicked.</p>

<p>I'm working on Ubuntu x64 13.04 raring ringtail Server.</p>

<p>Let's say i have two projects, one developed in django 1.3 and the other on django 1.4</p>

<p>And in the system i have django 1.6 installed.</p>

<p>I follow these steps to create my virtualenv:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir enviroments 

cd enviroments 

virtualenv --no-site-packages django1.3 

cd django1.3 

source bin/activate 

sudo pip install Django==1.3 
</code></pre>

<p>Everything is ok, but when i repeat this process, but changing, let's say <code>Django1.3</code> for <code>Django1.4</code>, it just reinstalls django in root files of the pc.</p>

<p>I mean, it doesn't just installs django for THAT virtualenv, it reinstalls it completely in the pc, substituting the django 1.3 previously installed on the other virtualenv.</p>

<p>And yes, i do activate the <code>virtualenv</code> before installing Django version.</p>

<p>I know virtualenv exists to create and install different projects on different versions of django, on the same machine.</p>

<p>What could be causing this behavior? </p>

In the main activity, the notes list, I am using MenuInflater to show the default 'Compose' menu option:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);

    // menu initialization, use the baseline menu from XML
    MenuInflater inflater = getMenuInflater();
    inflater.inflate(R.menu.noteslist, menu);

    // generate any additional actions that can be performed on the
    // overall list.  In a normal install, there are no additional
    // actions found here, but this allows other applications to extend
    // our menu with their own actions.
    Intent intent = new Intent(null, getIntent().getData());
    intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE);
    menu.addIntentOptions(Menu.CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE, 0, 0, new ComponentName(this, NotesList.class), null, intent, 0, null);

    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With noteslist.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;menu 
xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
&lt;item android:id=""@+id/compose_note""

      android:alphabeticShortcut=""c""
      android:numericShortcut=""3"" /&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works fine.  Now, per the example (and modified as the example tries to add intent options when there are no items selected on the list as well), I want to add some additional options if there are items in the list, and one of them is selected:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {

    super.onPrepareOptionsMenu(menu);

    // determine if we have any items in the list via the ListAdapter
    final boolean haveItems = (getListAdapter().getCount() &gt; 0);

    // do we have items?
    if (haveItems) {
        // there are items, check if any are selected
        //Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), ""position: "" + getSelectedItemPosition(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        if (getSelectedItemPosition() &gt;= 0) {
            // an item is selected, add the intents for one of our list items to the menu
            Uri uri = ContentUris.withAppendedId(getIntent().getData(), getSelectedItemId());

            // build menu on the fly... always starts with the EDIT action
            Intent[] specifics = new Intent[1];
            specifics[0] = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_EDIT, uri);
            MenuItem[] items = new MenuItem[1];

            // now add additional CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE intent-based actions, (see the manifest)
            Intent intent = new Intent(null, uri);
            intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE);
            menu.addIntentOptions(Menu.CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE, 0, 0, null, specifics, intent, 0, items);

            // finally, add a shortcut to the edit menu item
            if (items[0] != null) {
                items[0].setShortcut('1', 'e');
            }
        }
    } else {
        menu.removeGroup(Menu.CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE);
    }

    return true;
}

<p>Finally, the referenced AndroidManifest.xml, unchanged from the default for the demo app:</p>

<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/NotePad/AndroidManifest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/NotePad/AndroidManifest.html</a></p>

<p>So, I have two questions:</p>

<p>1) The resulting menus, Edit Note and Edit Title, generated by onPrepareOptionsMenu() when an item is selected, use the default icon and have no shortcuts assigned.  I can set the intent-filter to have a different icon via android:icon="""", but no such luck with assigning alphabetic and numeric shortcuts... I'd like to specify these, and was hoping that there might be a way to define these menu items in XML, and when they are to be brought in by the app via being identified by the intent-filters, also pull the XML and inflate/import it somehow.  Any suggestions or pointers?</p>

<p>2) In onCreateOptionsMenu(), why is the addIntentOptions() call with CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE NOT adding the activities with intent-filter set to category.ALTERNATIVE to the menu (not adding is correct behavior in this case, just trying to get my head around how the virtually identical calls to addIntentOptions() in onCreateOptionsMenu() and onPrepareOptionsMenu() result in different menus).</p>

<p>But I want to use newer versions of some of those JARs, and when I try, I get various compatibility issues -- e.g., if I write a test using a Hamcrest class that was new in 1.2, I can, but at runtime I get NoSuchMethodErrors because the 1.1 Hamcrest core is ahead of it in the classpath.</p>

<p>I could of course just start messing with the grails-2.0.x/lib directory, but this seems like a bad idea and also means bypassing the normal Ivy / Maven way of specifying dependencies.

<p>attr_list (or something to do with attr_list) seems to be the the most likely suspect (see my complaints and the error messages below). attr_list contains a list of attribute indices, which I will ""use"" one by one by selecting one at a time from the list without replacement. </p>

<p>The <strong>three base cases</strong> for the recursive function are as follows:</p>

<h1>1 (all the same class):</h1>

<p>every row (list of attributes) in dataset (list of rows) shares a common value in the row indexed by class_index</p>

<h1>2 (no more attributes):</h1>

<p>the parameter attr_list is empty. This should be the most active base case, occurring most frequently.</p>

<h1>3 (a partition is empty):</h1>

<p>the data is partitioned by partition_on_attr(), one of these partitions (list of rows) is empty, cannot continue</p>

<p>recursive call is the longest line (the one causing the horizontal scroll bar) where the function tdidt() is called as a component of the appended list. The aim of the list comprehension assigned to removed_attr_list is to have an attribute list without the attribute we had just selected form attr_list.</p>

<p>ok, so as for the error I'm getting it's huge. I'm hitting the recursive limit, and for a really weird reason. I'm printing the attr_list immediately on function call and whenever an empty list is presented. Here's the output...</p>

<pre><code>[0, 1, 2]
[0, 1]

</code></pre>

<p>Emphasis on the ellipsis. The [1]'s keep coming until recursion max out error. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in cmp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The beginning behavior is exactly how I anticipate; the attr_list is used up, a few branches created from the for loop over the recursive call are seen, then the base case speaks up with ""i see an empty list!"", then the [1]'s start flowing!</p>

<p>Am I missing a recursive case? How does the attr_list get set back to [1] again and permanently? Any help is much appreciated, and thanks for making it to the bottom of this novel!</p>

<p><strong>-----------------------------UPDATE 10/24/2014-----------------------------</strong></p>

<p>When printing the dataset variable on each recursive call I see a similar behavior to the attr_list parameter. Things behave as expected and then the dataset parameter becomes this line over and over...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'yes'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'yes'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'yes'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no'], ['third', 'adult', 'male', 'no']]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's only one line! (And a peek at a weird mangling of some of the data)</p>

<p>How in the world is this happening? The function seems to spawn some kind of divide-by-zero meltdown once it is done with its process... my recursion must have something faulty.</p>

<p><strong>-----------------------------UPDATE 10/25/2014-----------------------------</strong></p>

<p>Ok, we're onto something now. @njlarsson suggested checking the behavior when the function <strong>partition_on_attr()</strong> returns the same dataset that it receives, meaning the chosen attribute is consistent through the dataset and no partition takes place. My original thoughts on this case is that the next recursive call would have a smaller attr_list, and eventually the empty attr_list base case would catch this partition. I am obviously mistaken, here are a couple of basic test cases I've run and the light that they share...</p>

<p>first play dataset has two instances, the first three attributes are the attributes to split on, fourth is the attribute we are trying to guess. Since all of the splitting attributes are unequal the case that the partition_on_attr() function returns the entire dataset as one partition cannot happen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>play = [[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0]]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>output is a wonderful decision tree (not too aesthetically pleasing, but that's not the point)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>['a', 0, ['v', 0, ['c', 1]], ['v', 1, ['c', 0]]]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>now let's try a different play dataset, similar to the first play set - two instances, same schema.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>play = [[1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0]]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this dataset the first three attributes, the attributes to be split on, are all equal. Thus the partition_by_attr() function HAS to return a single partition identical to the passed dataset. <strong>THE MAX RECURSION ERROR OCCURS!</strong></p>

<p>@njlarsson you're onto something! I just don't see why this happens. What should the algorithm do in the case that the partition_on_attr function returns the entire dataset as one partition?</p>

So far i have successfully implemented Huffman encoding to the image which gives me a vector of binary codes. After that i run Huffman decoding and i get a vector which contains the elements of the image compressed. My problem is that i can find how is possible from this vector to reconstruct the image and create the image file.</p>

<p>Any help would be grateful</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Based on Ben A. help i have made progress but i still have some issues.
To be more exact. I have an image matrix. After finding unique symbols(elements) on this image matrix, i calculate the probabilities and then with this function:</p>

<pre><code>function [h,L,H]=Huffman_code(p,opt)
% Huffman code generator gives a Huffman code matrix h, 
%  average codeword length L &amp; entropy H
% for a source with probability vector p given as argin(1) 
zero_one=['0'; '1']; 
if nargin&gt;1&amp;&amp;opt&gt;0, zero_one=['1'; '0']; end
if abs(sum(p)-1)&gt;1e-6
  fprintf('\n The probabilities in p does not add up to 1!');
end  
M=length(p);  N=M-1; p=p(:); % Make p a column vector
h={zero_one(1),zero_one(2)};
if M&gt;2
  pp(:,1)=p;
  for n=1:N
     % To sort in descending order
     [pp(1:M-n+1,n),o(1:M-n+1,n)]=sort(pp(1:M-n+1,n),1,'descend'); 
     if n==1, ord0=o; end  % Original descending order
     if M-n&gt;1, pp(1:M-n,n+1)=[pp(1:M-1-n,n); sum(pp(M-n:M-n+1,n))]; end
  end
  for n=N:-1:2
     tmp=N-n+2; oi=o(1:tmp,n);
     for i=1:tmp, h1{oi(i)}=h{i}; end
     h=h1;   h{tmp+1}=h{tmp};
     h{tmp}=[h{tmp} zero_one(1)]; 
     h{tmp+1}=[h{tmp+1} zero_one(2)];
  end
  for i=1:length(ord0), h1{ord0(i)}=h{i}; end
  h=h1;
end
L=0; 
for n=1:M, L=L+p(n)*length(h{n}); end  % Average codeword length
H=-sum(p.*log2(p)); % Entropy by Eq.(9.1.4)
</code></pre>

<p>i calculate the huffman codes for the image.</p>

<p>Now i use this function:</p>

<pre><code>function coded_seq=source_coding(src,symbols,codewords)
% Encode a data sequence src based on the given (symbols,codewords).
no_of_symbols=length(symbols);  coded_seq=[];
if length(codewords)&lt;no_of_symbols
  error('The number of codewords must equal that of symbols');
end
for n=1:length(src)
   found=0;
   for i=1:no_of_symbols
      if src(n)==symbols(i), tmp=codewords{i}; found=1; break; end
   end
   if found==0, tmp='?'; end
   coded_seq=[coded_seq tmp];
end
</code></pre>

<p>where in src i put my image (matrix) and i get a coded sequence for my image.</p>

<p>Last is this function:</p>

<pre><code>function decoded_seq=source_decoding(coded_seq,h,symbols)
% Decode a coded_seq  based on the given (codewords,symbols).
M=length(h);  decoded_seq=[];
while ~isempty(coded_seq)
  lcs= length(coded_seq); found=0;
  for m=1:M
    codeword= h{m};
    lc= length(codeword);
    if lcs&gt;=lc&amp;codeword==coded_seq(1:lc)
      symbol=symbols(m); found=1;  break;
    end
    if found==0, symbol='?'; end
  end 
  decoded_seq=[decoded_seq symbol]; 
  coded_seq=coded_seq(lc+1:end); 
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which is used to decode the coded sequence. The problem is that finally as coded sequence i get a 1x400 matrix where i should get a 225x400 which is my image dimensions.
Am i missing something? Maybe should i replace something because i have a matrix and not a number sequence (for which the code is written)?</p>

<p>To make the problem reproducible and somewhat simpler, I have extracted the first 100 rows of data, which features 4 variables (<code>id</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>x</code>). The <code>id</code> is a unique subject identifier. The <code>date</code> is an integer sequence from 0 to n days of observation for each <code>id</code>. <code>y</code> is the status or outcome of the hazard analysis and <code>x</code> is the time varying covariate. In this example, once <code>y</code> = 1 has occurred the data for each subject will be censored and no additional data should be included in the ideal output dataframe.</p>

<p>The data are structured so that each subject has 1 row that corresponds to each day of observation. </p>

<pre><code>head(test)
id date y x
1     0 0 0
1     1 0 1
1     2 0 1
1     3 0 1
1     4 0 1
1     5 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>However, as I understand it, the <code>cph</code> function in R requires that time varying covariates be structured in such a way that the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> variables need to be recoded into 3 rows with intervals from (0,1] and (1,5] and (5,6] for the data featured in the <code>head(test)</code> code block above.</p>

<ol>
<li>Reads source file paths and destination folder path from an XML file</li>
<li>Checks if source file and destination path exist (for each file)</li>
<li>Checks if source file (same name) exists in the target folder</li>
<li>Checks the last modified date of every source and destination file, if the file exists in the target folder</li>
<li>Copies source files to the target folder if the file does not already exist, or if the source file is newer than the existing file in the destination folder, otherwise does nothing</li>

<p>This only works on source files, if a source folder is specified in the XML file, only that folder will be copied, and none of its content.</p>

<p>I don't want to use <code>Copy-Item -Recurse</code> because I want to check the last modified date of every item, and if it fails the above conditions I don't want to copy it at all.</p>

<p>I've searched for this issue and almost every one say that it's about:<br>
1) Not having the same type<br>
 - They're both ""VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL"" (tried letting the one in table_two be null, didn't alter the error-message)<br>
2) The foreign key not being a primary key<br>
 - table_one_name is a primary key in table_one together with table_one_id<br>
3) Make sure that the Charset and Collate options are the same both at the table level<br>
 - What does this mean? I suppose they are since I don't change them?</p>

<p>But what I am noticing is the instances of IFoo (could be 100 or so per request) are not being released or having their dispose method called.</p>

<p>In the above example, <code>remove</code> can return <code>v.end()</code> if 99 is not found in the <code>vector v</code>. It is basically passing <code>past-the-end-iterator</code> to erase method.</p>

<ol>
<li>What happens when <code>past-the-end-iterator</code> is passed to the <code>erase</code> method?  Does standard says it a UB? </li>
<li>If it is undefined behavior, then <code>erase-remove idiom</code> example in Scott Meyer’s book should have looked like:</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<pre><code>  vector&lt;int&gt; v; 
    ...
    vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator newEndIter = remove(v.begin(), v.end(), 99);
    if(newEndIter != v.end() )
    {
     v.erase(newEndIter, v.end();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas on this?</p>

<p>But this inadvertantly causes some of the other textviews to take on these special attributes. I think it's because cause textviews get ""recycled"" in the AbsListAdapter class.</p>

<p>The best solution I've come up with is to stuff the conditional into a static bool, and use that as the condition. There's a goodly amount of code above and below the if-else, so I wrap the whole thing in braces to limit the scope of the variable as much as possible:</p>

<pre><code>// &lt;snip&gt;

    static bool isSameSize = (sizeof(alias_wchar_t) == sizeof(wchar_t));

<p>This feels pretty gross though. This seems like it should be resolvable at compile-time rather than runtime, but the preprocessor doesn't know about sizeof. Is there a cleaner, more elegant way to resolve this?</p>

<p>For example say I want to parse a dsn into its components. Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase';

preg_match_all('/host=(?P&lt;host&gt;[^;]+);dbname=(?P&lt;dbname&gt;[^;]+)/', $dsn, $matches);
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to achieve the same result without explicitly defining each capture group's name?</p>

<p>In other words, match pattern <code>/;|:([^=]+)=([^;]+)/</code> and use whatever is on the left side of the equals sign as the group's name, and whatever is on the right side as the value.</p>

<p>I am aware I could emulate the desired behavior with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase';

list($engine, $dsn) = explode(':', $dsn);
$result = [];

 while(preg_match('/;?(?P&lt;key&gt;[^=]+)=(?P&lt;val&gt;[^;]+)/', $dsn, $matches)) {
    $result[$matches['key']] = $matches['val'];
    $dsn = str_replace($matches[0], '', $dsn);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm also aware that there are several other ways of achieving this. I'm not looking for a workaround, I'm interested in knowing if dynamically named capture groups are possible, and if yes, how?</p>

<p>I am trying to find the recursive depth of a function that trawls a dictionary and I'm a bit lost...
Currently I have something like:</p>

<pre><code>myDict = {'leve1_key1': {'level2_key1': {'level3_key1': {'level4_key_1': {'level5_key1':   'level5_value1'}}}}}
</code></pre>

<p>And I want to know just how nested the most nested dictionary is... so I do the following...</p>

<pre><code>def dict_depth(d, depth):

    for i in d.keys():
        if type(d[i]) is dict:
            newDict = d[i]
            dict_depth(newDict, depth+1)
    return depth

print dict_depth(myDict, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Only problem is, the recursive loop only returns the return of the final value (0).
if I put in a print statement 
    <code>for i in d.keys():</code> then I can at least print the highest value of recursion, but returning the value is a different matter...</p>

<p>I'm sure this is straightforward - I've just got jellybrain.</p>

However, my first question is very general: When is appropriate to put functionality in a new class rather than a new function in the same class? According to this <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Java tutorial</a>, which focuses on basic object-oriented principles, a class is supposed to be a ""blueprint of an object"". I always understood this to mean that any functionality or behavior that the object would use should be contained within the class. However, according to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">single responsibility principle</a>, each class should have only one reason to change. For example, you should have one class to compile a report and one class to print it rather than a single Report class.</p>

<p>Can you guys help me understand the pros and cons to creating a new class? What are the costs to splitting an object into multiple classes? Are there compile-time or performance costs for keeping related functionality in the same class, or for splitting it into two? Are there perhaps times that you would want to split things out, while you might want to keep them together other times?</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>My web application is RESTful and does not support sessions or even cookies for that matter. Every source URL is complete in a sense that it contains a user specific query parameter to be able to identify a unique user. The pages which see most visits in the web application are listing pages. I just need to show the user's email in the header and the links on the page must also carry the user specific query parameter ahead so as to simulate a logged in behavior. Page contents are supposed to be the same for each user except for the header and those internal links.</p>

<p>I tried to use <code>&lt;esi:include /&gt;</code> for such areas on the page but obviously, could not include the user specific parameter in the page source (else the first user specific hit would be cached with the first user's parameter and be served the same for every subsequent user). Further, I tried to strip user specific parameter in <code>vcl_recv</code> subroutine of Varnish and store it temporarily in a header such as <code>req.http.X-User</code> just before a <code>lookup</code>. Each source URL gets hashed with a <code>req.url</code> that doesn't contain any user specific parameters and hence, does not create duplicate cache objects for each unique user.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I would like to read the user specific parameter from <code>req.http.X-User</code> and hash user specific ESI requests by adding this user specific value against each ESI URL as a query parameter. I do not see a way in which one could share query parameters between a source request and it's included ESI requests. Could someone help?</p>

"17039668","1","","","2013-06-11 08:32:10","","2","120","<p>I'm trying to figure out why django ORM has such strange (as I think) behaviour. I have 2 basic models (simplified to get the main idea):</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>class A(models.Model):
    pass

class B(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=15)
    a = models.ForeignKey(A)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to select rows from table <code>a</code> that are refered from table <code>b</code> that dont have some value in column name.
Here is sample SQL I expect Django ORM to produce:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT * FROM inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a a
INNER JOIN inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_b b ON a.id = b.a_id
WHERE NOT (b.name = '123');
</code></pre>

<p>In case of <code>filter()</code> method of <code>django.db.models.query.QuerySet</code> it works as expected:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from inefficient_foreign_key_exclude.models import A
&gt;&gt;&gt; print A.objects.filter(b__name='123').query
SELECT `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a`.`id`
FROM `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a`
INNER JOIN `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_b` ON (`inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a`.`id` = `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_b`.`a_id`)
WHERE `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_b`.`name` = 123
</code></pre>

<p>But if I use <code>exclude()</code> method (a negative form of Q object in underlaying logic) it creates a really strange SQL query:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print A.objects.exclude(b__name='123').query
SELECT `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a`.`id`
FROM `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a`
WHERE NOT ((`inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a`.`id` IN (
    SELECT U1.`a_id` FROM `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_b` U1 WHERE (U1.`name` = 123  AND U1.`a_id` IS NOT NULL)
) AND `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a`.`id` IS NOT NULL))
</code></pre>

<p>Why does ORM make a subquery instead of just JOIN?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p>I've made a test to prove that using a subquery is not efficient at all.
I created 500401 rows in both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> tables. And here what I got:</p>

<p>For join:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; SELECT count(*)
    -&gt; FROM inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a a
    -&gt; INNER JOIN inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_b b ON a.id = b.a_id
    -&gt; WHERE NOT (b.name = 'abc');
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|   500401 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.97 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>And for subquery:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; SELECT count(*)
    -&gt; FROM inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_a a
    -&gt; WHERE NOT ((a.id IN (
    -&gt;     SELECT U1.`a_id` FROM `inefficient_foreign_key_exclude_b` U1 WHERE (U1.`name` = 'abc'  AND U1.`a_id` IS NOT NULL)
    -&gt; ) AND a.id IS NOT NULL));
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|   500401 |
+----------+
1 row in set (3.76 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>Join is almost 4 times faster.</p>

<p>There is one problem with this, changes in tools are not saved when process is killed, for exampl last project, opened files, visual positions of controls and all other stuff. These settings are saved only when you close your tool, but it's really time consuming to click each of them.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>Can I send shutdown command to software instead killing process?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I need command for CMD, not programing solution, as I have mentioned above I need command like ""tskill skype"" which kills skype process. Windows can send this command, because when you shutting down your windows, windows is sending shutdown command to all running programs.

<p>My setup:
I've got Linux Mint 16 installed (on an HP Pavilion dv7 laptop).
I've got Python 3.3.2+ installed, and it's working fine.
I've got Python 2.7.5+ installed, and it's working fine.</p>

<p>What I did:
I followed the instructions at <a href=""http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html"">http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html</a> to install Pillow v2.4.0 (PIL fork):</p>

<p>I started with:</p>

<pre><code>~$ pip install Pillow
</code></pre>

<p>I installed python-setuptools with:</p>

<pre><code>~$ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools
</code></pre>

<p>and also, for python 3:</p>

<pre><code>~$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-setuptools
</code></pre>

<p>I installed ""prerequisites on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS"" thus:</p>

<pre><code>~$ sudo apt-get install libtiff4-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev \
libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.5-dev tk8.5-dev python-tk 
</code></pre>

<p>(<em>Mint 16 is based on Ubuntu 13.10, but I didn't find a list of prerequisites for any later version</em>)</p>

<p>What happened:
With python 2,
import image
worked and I could open a .png image and show it.
But with python 3,
'import image'
gave <strong>'no module named Image'</strong> and
'from PIL import Image'
gave <strong>'no module named PIL'</strong></p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm using Scala Play with Anorm, but for dealing with BYTEA and BLOB's I've regressed to using plain old java.sql.Connection API and roughly followed this description: </p>

<p><a href=""http://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/80/binary-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/80/binary-data.html</a></p>

<p>My code looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def saveSmallImage(id: String, img: SmallImage): Unit = {
  DB.withConnection { implicit conn =&gt;

  val ps = conn.prepareStatement(
    ""INSERT INTO SmallImage(id, mimeType, image) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"")
  ps.setString(1, id)
  ps.setString(2, img.mimeType)
  ps.setBinaryStream(3, img.binaryStream, img.length)
  ps.executeUpdate()
  ps.close()
}
} 
</code></pre>

<p>where 'image' column is of type BYTEA, img.binaryStream is of type InputStream.</p>

<p>I'm getting this error:</p>

<pre><code>java.sql.SQLFeatureNotSupportedException: Method 
org.postgresql.jdbc4.Jdbc4PreparedStatement.
  setBinaryStream(int, InputStream, long) 
is not yet implemented.
</code></pre>

<p>I have the following dependency in my build.sbt:</p>

<pre><code>""postgresql"" % ""postgresql"" % ""9.1-901-1.jdbc4""
</code></pre>

<p>(this corresponds to groupId, artifactId, version in maven POM-files). This seems to be the most recent one. The Postgres Manual tells me, that this feature has been present since PostgreSQL version 7.2.</p>

<p>What's going on? Is PostgreSQL/JDBC somehow deprecated and no longer maintained?
Should I take another version to make it work?
Or is SQL completely dead, and I should switch to some other database? 
Is it somehow a generally bad idea to use Postgres with Java?
Could it somehow matter that my postgres version is 9.3 but I'm using JDBC 9.1-x?</p>

<p>I would be very thankful if anyone tells me what I'm doing wrong and how to make it work.</p>

<p>PS:
... Tried to git-clone pgjdbc. It requires ant 1.4.1 to build. This ant version is ~8 years old and no longer available at the website of the Apache foundation. Isn't it kind of eerie?</p>

<p>I have two questions about this Makefile:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I found there are commands, such as mkdir, $(CP),$(MAKE). I changed $(CP) to cp, and the compiling goes well. So I don't understand why these two kinds of formats exsits.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the parameters, such as $(PKG_BUILD_DIR), $(INSTALL_DIR), are defined in openwrt? I just found the place where $(TOPDIR) is defined but not the others.</p></li>

<p>In looking at
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8449999/whats-the-most-efficient-way-of-generating-all-possible-combinations-of-skyrim"">What&#39;s the most efficient way of generating all possible combinations of skyrim (PC Game) potions?</a> I had the naïve notion that it would be a really, really simple recursive filter in Lisp to generate all combinations of size ""n."" The answer given there, in R, is elegant and shows off the language well, but that <code>combn(list,n)</code> method caught my attention. ( <a href=""http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/utils/html/combn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/utils/html/combn.html</a> )</p>

<pre><code>(defun combn (list n)
  (cond ((= n 0) nil)
        ((null list) nil)
        ((= n 1) (mapcar #'list list))
        (t (mapcar #'(lambda (subset) (cons (car list) subset))
                   (combn (cdr list) (1- n))))))

(combn '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) 3)

((1 2 3) (1 2 4) (1 2 5) (1 2 6) (1 2 7) (1 2 8) (1 2 9))
</code></pre>

<p>Except, this just returns the first set of combinations … I can't wrap my head around what's wrong, precisely. It seems that the <code>(= n 1)</code> case works right, but the <code>t</code> case should be doing something differently, such as stripping <code>(1 2)</code> off the list and repeating?</p>

<p>So, my attempt to fix it, got nastier:</p>

<pre><code> (defun combn (list n)
  (cond ((= n 0) nil) ((= n 1) (mapcar #'list list))
        ((null list) nil)
        (t (cons (mapcar #'(lambda (subset) (cons (car list) subset))
                         (combn (cdr list) (1- n)))
                 (combn (cdr list) n)))))
</code></pre>

<p>which is wrong at the point of <code>(t cons(</code>… I think. But, if <code>cons</code> is the wrong answer, I'm not sure what is right…? (Reduced to using 2 to demonstrate output…)</p>

<pre><code>(combn '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) 2)
(((1 2) (1 3) (1 4) (1 5) (1 6) (1 7) (1 8) (1 9))
 ((2 3) (2 4) (2 5) (2 6) (2 7) (2 8) (2 9))
 ((3 4) (3 5) (3 6) (3 7) (3 8) (3 9))
 ((4 5) (4 6) (4 7) (4 8) (4 9))
 ((5 6) (5 7) (5 8) (5 9))
 ((6 7) (6 8) (6 9))
 ((7 8) (7 9))
 ((8 9))
  NIL)
</code></pre>

<p>… which appears to be right, except for the extraneous nesting and the bonus <code>NIL</code> at the end. (I had anticipated that <code>((null list) nil)</code> would have filtered that out?)</p>

<p>What did I do wrong? :-(</p>

<p>(And, also, is there a standard routine for doing this more efficiently?)</p>

<p>It seems like it should be pretty straightforward to have a slider change the visualization of the stacked barchart.  However, the problem is the <code>Bar</code> object from the <code>bokeh.charts</code> library does not expose where the data that is rendered in the bargraph is sourced. As far as I can tell, this is because the <code>charts</code> module does not maintain this data.</p>

<p>Is it possible to have an interaction as described above using the <code>Bar</code> object. I'm stuck as to where to source the data so the barchart can be updated when the slider moves. I really don't want to have to rebuild the entire barchart from primitives explicitly every time the slider moves.</p>

<p>See refs: <a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/outlets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/guides/outlets/</a> and this:
<a href=""http://codebrief.com/2012/07/anatomy-of-an-ember-dot-js-app-part-i-redux-routing-and-outlets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codebrief.com/2012/07/anatomy-of-an-ember-dot-js-app-part-i-redux-routing-and-outlets/</a></p>

<p>How I understand this to work: 
When you connect an outlet using a string the following things happen</p>

<ol>
<li>Ember looks for the view definition on the App and instantiates it</li>
<li>Ember looks for the controller definition on the App and creates a instance of it</li>
<li>Hooks the two between each other like so: sets views controller property and sets controllers view property</li>
</ol>

<p>--- Works well up until the last step. I can't seem to get the view property to set on the controller.</p>

<p>JSBin here: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ekekir/40/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbin.com/ekekir/40/edit</a></p>

<p>Relevant code:</p>

<p><strong>App.Router</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>App.Router = Ember.Router.extend({
  root: Ember.Route.extend({
    state1: Ember.Route.extend({
      route: '/state1',

      connectOutlets: function (router) {
        router.get('applicationController').connectOutlet('state1')
      }
    })
  })
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Controller and View</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>App.State1View = Ember.View.extend ({ 
  templateName: 'state1',
  submit: function () {
    this.get('controller').doLogView();
    return false;
  }
});

App.State1Controller = Ember.Controller.extend({
  doLogView: function () {
    console.log('Getting controller view:');
    console.log(this.get('view'));
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>At the end it returns a big fat null.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong or is this just the way it should be?</p>

<p>BTW: This is using ember-1.0.pre.</p>

<pre><code>public class Supplier
{

    }

    public Guid SupplierId { get; set; }

    public Guid SupplierId { get; set; }
    [ForeignKey(""SupplierId"")]
    public virtual Supplier Supplier { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using ASP.NET MVC 4 and upon Create of a new Contact, the SupplierId is passed in the querystring and added to the Contact create form as a hidden field:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.HiddenFor(model =&gt; model.SupplierId)
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the Contact successfully and populate's the Contact's SupplierId field with the Guid from the query string. However, the problem is that the Contacts table has another field for the virtual Supplier relationship called Supplier_SupplierId and this field is NULL. I'm not sure I understand why Supplier_SupplierId is even being created on the Contacts table, as SupplierId should be being used as the foreign key and this would just be redundant. If I try to access the Contacts collection of a Supplier I successfully added a Contact to, the collection comes back empty because Contact.Supplier_SupplierId is NULL. However, if I copy the value from the SupplierId column into the Supplier_SupplierId column of the Contact record, Supplier.Contacts will bring back the Contact.</p>

<p>This is what my Contacts table ends up looking like:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Contacts] (
    [ContactId]           UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL,
    [FirstName]           NVARCHAR (MAX)   NOT NULL,
    [LastName]            NVARCHAR (MAX)   NOT NULL,
    [Supplier_SupplierId] UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NULL,

    CONSTRAINT [FK_dbo.Contacts_dbo.Suppliers_Supplier_SupplierId] FOREIGN KEY ([Supplier_SupplierId]) REFERENCES [dbo].[Suppliers] ([SupplierId])
);
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know why 2 foreign keys to Suppliers are being created in Contacts? How can I change it so that the only foreign key to Suppliers is SupplierId?</p>

<p>Is it really returning all the rows then sorting and narrowing down stuff with LINQ on the client side?</p>

<p>I've tried doing it with both Entity Framework and Linq to SQL; both appear to have the same behavior.</p>

<p>Not sure it makes any difference, but I'm using C# in VWD 2010.</p>

<p>Any insight?</p>

    var context = new TectonicEntities();
    totalRecords = context.Stores.Count();
    int skipRows = (page - 1) * pageSize;
    if (desc)
        return context.Stores.OrderByDescending(sort).Skip(skipRows).Take(pageSize).ToList();
    return context.Stores.OrderBy(sort).Skip(skipRows).Take(pageSize).ToList();
}

[Extent1].[SecureURL] AS [SecureURL], 
[Extent1].[UseSSL] AS [UseSSL]

<p>After some further research, I found that the following works the way I would expect it to:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;Store&gt; ListStores(Func&lt;Store, string&gt; sort, bool desc, int page, int pageSize, out int totalRecords)
{
    var context = new TectonicEntities();
    totalRecords = context.Stores.Count();
    int skipRows = (page - 1) * pageSize;           
    var qry = from s in context.Stores orderby s.Name ascending select s;
    return qry.Skip(skipRows).Take(pageSize);           
}
</code></pre>

<p>Resulting SQL:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP (3)

    FROM [dbo].[tec_Stores] AS [Extent1]
)  AS [Extent1]
WHERE [Extent1].[row_number] &gt; 3
ORDER BY [Extent1].[Name] ASC
</code></pre>

<p>I really like the way the first option works; Passing in a lambda expression for sort. Is there any way to accomplish the same thing in the LINQ to SQL orderby syntax?  I tried using qry.OrderBy(sort).Skip(skipRows).Take(pageSize), but that ended up giving me the same results as my first block of code. Leads me to believe my issues are somehow tied to OrderBy.</p>

<p>Now my question is, my program is very very slow. If I insert 50 words into the application, it take more than 1 hour to do the work I explained before. I have tried 2 weeks to find a solution, but I could not. Can someone please help me here to speed this work? FYI, it takes no longer than 12 seconds to read the 77MB Hash file. Something else is wrong. Please help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I am almost desperate, I have spent 2 days on this problem. the only thing I can spot is the <code>CFRunLoopTimer</code> zombie object. I use <a href=""https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer"" rel=""nofollow"">CocoaHttpServer</a> and <code>NSURLConnection</code> in my code. From somewhere I learnt that <code>NSURLConnection</code> depends on <code>NSRunLoop</code>, so I wonder if it is the <code>NSRunLoop</code> that causes the crash. in my app, both <code>CocoaHTTPServer</code> and <code>NSURLConnection</code> depend on <code>NSRunLoop</code>, of cause they run on different threads.</p>

<p>Please help!</p>

<p>I use <strong>Instruments</strong> to find the zombie object, and took 2 screenshots of the crash report:

<p>I'm almost sure that this is caused by the use of explicit Select statements in my DAO class (where I'm selecting specific entity fields instead of the whole entiy), so that the results are returned as an array. If I try to call docs[0] in the JSF data table, the list displays fine, but I want to be able to explicitly call docs.classification instead of using array indices. </p>

<p>The below question does not adequately answer MY question because I do not want to use array indices but rather explicit EL properties (ie: docs.classification NOT docs[0]). In this case, I would like to know 1) What the appropriate result class should look like (see my below attempt)? 2) Do I need to include a custom conversion class in addition or instead of the defined result class?</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19629067/showing-hibernate-jpa-results-in-jsf-datatable-causes-java-lang-numberformatexc"">Showing Hibernate/JPA results in JSF datatable causes: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;[propertyname]&quot;</a></p>

<p>The above is helpful but I already understand that the structure of my query returns a tuple and my question as above is if there is a way to get around that without having to use array indices. </p>

<p>After trying conventional ORM methods, I tried to define the following result class: </p>

            + "" WHERE d.fk_projectdoc_id = ?1"";

    Query query = em.createQuery(SQLCOMMAND);
    query.setParameter(1, projectid);
    try {
      //  ListDataModel&lt;ProjectDocs&gt; lresults = new ListDataModel&lt;ProjectDocs&gt;(query.getResultList());
  List&lt;ProjectDocs&gt; lresults = query.getResultList();
        return lresults;
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        throw new RuntimeException(""FAILED"", ex);
    }

<p>And the JSF Managed bean class is as follows (I also tried using a CDI bean but this product a NPE):</p>

<pre><code>@ManagedProperty(value = ""#{projBB}"")
// @Model

<p>Trying to get the clickable area after scaling custom relative layout. When I scale(mScaleFactor,mScaleFactor) this code works properly since the Zoom happens from the top left corner and the calculation gives the clickable area position at the half of the mScaleFactor which is passed to the viewContains where it checks the position of the imageviews. Now I am facing problem When I try scaling at the different position by passing scale(mScaleFactor,mScaleFactor,click_locn_x,click_locn_y). I am not getting the calculations correct. How to get the clickable area when I scale with click as the midpoint.  Rite now I am at initial stages of scaling and trying to learn. I am going step by step. please help me with the clickable area and is there any similar things done by someone ...example will be greatful !!! </p>

Basically I click on a button and it takes me to a page where I can write and save my note. Now when I click save. The note saves in a directory and when I return to the mainpage where the listbox is which usually loads the notes in a directory, its empty. So the only way for me to load the items back to the listbox is if I quit the app and then launch it again. That is the current problem which I have right now. </p>

<p>I've added the ObservableCollection. The FillListBox obviously gets called from the OnNavigatedTo event in the MainPage.</p>

<pre><code>NoteTemplateList LoadNotes = new NoteTemplateList();

    var MainMenux = (MainMenu)frame.Content;

<pre><code>_txtvFooter.editable = NO;

<p>The issue I am having is a strange one, but when I run my app onto my device (or sim) from Xcode, the UITextView detects all of the links fine, and I can click them. If I then run the app not in debug (not running through Xcode), the links show as black standard text and cannot be touched. Note this is only happening on iOS 6.</p>

<p>On the iOS 5 simulator, the links show as blue and are clickable no matter if the app is run in debug, or just ran from the simulator.</p>

<p>I have looked all over the internets, and cannot find a solution or anyone else who has reported this issue. Does anyone know if something changed in iOS 6 specifically? I thing is, like I said it detects the links when run straight from Xcode, so to me it seems like an iOS 6 bug.</p>

<p>When loading an Installation, I include the associated District, which works fine (I'm getting the entity on the client side).  However, when I change the District on the client and try to update, the HasChanged flag is still false on the entity and the service context, and the associated foreign key doesn't change (DistrictID on the Installation record).  </p>

data = f.read()
tree = lxml.etree.XML(data)
if tree.xpath('//name/text()=""Espresso""'):
    insert new child here

<p>At this point, it should be possible to use use <code>lxml.etree.Element</code> to make the xml node, and use insert to attach them into xml document</p>

<p>However, while this sounds great in theory, I am unable to get it to work.<br>

<p>Now, I've updated some object A on the main thread in the main MOC, and now I'm in some method and working within a block on my private MOC queue/thread:</p>

<pre><code>[self.privateManagedObjectContext performBlockAndWait:^{
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>I save my main-thread MOC:    </p>

<pre><code>[self.managedObjectContext performBlockAndWait:^{
    NSError *contextError;
    if (![self.managedObjectContext save:&amp;contextError]) NSLog(@""ERROR SAVING MOC : %@ ; %@"", contextError, [contextError userInfo]);
}];
</code></pre>

<p>The save is successful (verified) and triggers the save notification (verified), which executes the merger.</p>

<p>But the MOCs remain inconsistent: when I then fetch object A from my main MOC and log the number of objects in its relationship R, I find that the number of objects differs from when I fetch object A from my private MOC and log the number of objects in relationship R.</p>

<p>A bit downstream of this, in a related chain of events, I go to save my private MOC. The app pauses (only if I have enabled an all-exceptions or all-objective-c-exceptions breakpoint), and execution can be resumed without any apparent harm. This issue is described here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22948130/core-data-moc-save-pauses-execution-and-fails-to-save-w-o-error-or-crash"">core data MOC save pauses execution and fails to save (w/o error or crash)</a>. I have a feeling it's related, but I suspect this failure to properly merge is a more fundamental problem.</p>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have tried every merge policy</li>
<li>I found that if I attempt to execute the merger using performBlock<b>AndWait</b>, the app hangs indefinitely; I don't know whether that is the expected behavior.</li>
<li>I've read every question I can find about this and tried everything I can think of. </li>
</ul>

<p>Is there something wrong with this code? What else can I try? Thanks!</p>

Now though, I think it would be a good idea to have it to where it can at least be easily used by MVC projects. I'm wondering if my project would map well to the ASP.Net MVC style though. </p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that my view engine generates everything at compile-time via T4 templates. This means that everything is statically typed for the most part. Most of MVC seems to be a bit loosely typed however. </p>

<p>So for some view you might have this code generated:</p>

<pre><code>class MyView{
  public string Foo{get;set;}
  public int Bar{get;set;}
  public string Render(){
    return ""This is my view: ""+Foo+(string)Bar;
  }
}

<p>And because of how it works, even if there is a views/FooView.html file, it may get processed into a class named <code>MyView</code>. </p>

<p>So how exactly is the best way to assign <code>ViewData</code> to say <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> of MyView? Should I just impose the limitation that you can only use a single field in the views(basically being a <code>ViewData</code>) or? </p>

<p>The other major problem I see is that MVC is almost completely file based. When you say <code>RenderView(""MyView"",data);</code> it will look in /views/ for a file named MyView.aspx or whatever(you can change where it looks and the file extension of course). The problem is that <code>MyView</code> could have been compiled from a file named <code>FooView.html</code>. Should I basically just generate a huge list for every view available with their mappings from class name to filesystem name? Or is there a better way? </p>

<p>Note: Because I generate all the views(and possibly could generate the MVC view engine) from a T4 template, this means I could write huge lists and other extremely tedious or bad code. But I feel like there is a better way than a huge list in this case, and that there will be underlying problems with only keeping a list.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>When I take a look to the console, there's this output:</p>

<pre><code>undefined app.js?body=1:153
undefined app.js?body=1:155
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined app.js?body=1:119
43.653226,-79.38318429999998 main.js?body=1:109
40.0583238,-74.4056612 
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the first <strong>undefined</strong> is the output of <code>console.log(city1);</code>, the second one of <code>console.log(city2);</code>, the <code>Uncaught TypeError</code> is from the function <code>count_the_distance</code> - because as parameters are passed 2 <code>undefined</code>s and the last two coordinations are from the <code>get_city_point</code> function - the <code>console.log(point)</code>.</p>

<p>So does it means that counting coordinations takes too much time and instead of returning lat+long it returns <code>undefined</code>?
Because the <code>console.log</code> in the function <code>get_city_point</code> shows that the coordination is counted.</p>

<p>Where's the problem in here?</p>

I found a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14736328/looking-for-an-example-for-inserting-content-into-the-response-using-a-servlet-f"">way to modify the response content</a>. Using the <code>OncePerRequestFilter</code> base class from Spring, I have end up with:</p>

<pre><code>public class JsonArrayVulnerabilityPreventorFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

<p>The problem is that when I have introduced the response wrapper, the <code>Content-Type</code> header (and few others) disappeared from the response. I have confirmed that without a wrapper, the <code>response.getHeaderNames()</code> call returns 14 different headers (including content type) whereas with the wrapper, there is only 9. It also breaks character encoding, because with the wrapper the <code>Content-Type</code> header does not tell the browser that the content is in UTF-8. Why?</p>

<p>It is working great. The only problem I got here is I couldn't get the blank value. What I get is <code>0</code> is equal to <code>''</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Here is what I mean:</strong></p>

<p>Let's assume that <code>domain.com</code> PR is <code>blank</code> or <code>no value</code>, <code>example.com</code> PR is <code>0</code> and <code>yoursite.com</code> is <code>1</code>. </p>

<p>With the <code>class</code> I mentioned above, I want to retrieve their <code>pagerank</code> and output string <code>N/A</code> if the <code>pagerank</code> is not <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> or bigger.</p>

<p>So, the code would be something like this: </p>

<pre><code>$allurls = array('domain.com', 'example.com', 'yoursite.com');

foreach( $allurls as $url) {

$pr = GooglePageRankChecker::getRank($url);

if ($pr &gt;= 0) {
echo $pr . ' ';
} else {
echo ""N/A"";
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>But it returns just like this:</p>

<p><code>0 1</code> instead of <code>N/A 0 1</code></p>

<p>I had tried <code>empty</code> and <code>is_null</code>, but it still can not recognize the <code>blank</code> value.</p>

<p>How to make it recognize <code>blank</code> value and not confuse it with <code>0</code> so I can output 'N/A' when the pagerank is blank?</p>

<p>We are preparing to develop an application that is exceptionally dynamic and interactive.  It's particularly heavy on the graphics side.</p>

<p>We are 85% convinced that Adobe Flash built atop Flex is the right path to take, however Cappuccino is quite nice and seems as though it may be able to nearly fit the bill.</p>

<p>The only pause we have right now is portability for the iPhone.  With the lack of blessings from Apple we will most certainly have to create a 2nd interface for the iPhone for the site, however... Having two interfaces may not be bad as it will likely have to be custom anyway to take advantage of the differences that it affords.</p>

<p>Any further thoughts or reevaluations of points enumerated in the noted article?  Further, Flex 4 adds a lot of strength to the position mentioned previously regarding UI development.  Fx4 is very nice vs Fx3 and shaves 90% from the development time when coupled with Flash Catalyst, which is not really always fully appropriate, but with some round trip tricks it seems as though it can cut through things rather well...</p>

<p>Apart of things that I can explain by myself, the project uses the code like this:</p>

<pre><code>ostringstream ostr;
ostr &lt;&lt; ""The "" __FUNCTION__ ""() failed to malloc("" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "")."";
throw bad_alloc(ostr.str().c_str());
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler now complains</p>

<pre><code>error C2248: 'std::bad_alloc::bad_alloc' : cannot access private member declared 
    in class 'std::bad_alloc'
</code></pre>

<p>... which is true.  That version of constructor is now private.  </p>

<p>What was the reason to make that version of constructor private?  Is it recommended by C++11 standard not to use that constructor with the argument?</p>

<p>(I can imagine that if allocation failed, it may cause more problems to try to construct anything new.  However, it is only my guess.)</p>

I did a little research and as far as I can tell a hash table would be best for this (correct me if I am wrong, I looked into tries as well)</p>

<p>Here's the tricky part: I cannot use any STL's for this project. So as far as I can tell I am going to have to write my own hash table class or find one that pretty much works. I understand how has tables work on a basic level but I am not sure I know enough to write a whole one by myself. </p>

<p>I looked around Google and I could not find any suitable sample code. </p>

<p>My question is does anyone know how to do this in c++ and/or where I can find some code to start off with. I need 3 basic functions for the table: insert, search, remove.</p>

<p>Things to remember while you think about this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Number 1 Concern is SPEED! this needs to be lighting fast, no concern for system resources. From the reading that I have done, a hash table can do better than O(log n) Consider mutithreading?</li>
<li>Cannot use STL!</li>

Winforms
using RightToLeft properties correctly (I hope)</p>

<p>Let's stick with arabic-egypt for this example.  Region and languages has it set as dd/mm/yyyy, but when I switch to that culture, things such as ""Date Modified"" show up as yyyy/mm/dd, which I'm told by a localization person here to actually be correct.  Also, Microsoft's date time picker shows yyyy/mm/dd.  But when we show a date in a string inside a label, it comes up dd/mm/yyyy.  This is regardless of setting the currentUICulture to be en-us or ar-eg (which is something you do on an opening screen of our software, not through windows).  The date time picker will show the arabic #'s (0-9) when english is picked, and the hindu numbers when arabic is picked, but always correctly shows yyyy/mm/dd.
But the formatted strings are still wrong.  Basically, we have this</p>

<pre><code> string sdformat = ""Start Date = {0}"";  // this is actually pulled from a localized resource
 label.Text = string.Format(sdformat, startDate.ToShortDateString());
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried this:</p>

<pre><code> string sdformat = ""Start Date = {0:d}"";  // this is actually pulled from a localized resource
 label.Text = string.Format(sdformat, startDate);
</code></pre>

<p>but the text on the label comes up dd/mm/yyyy</p>

<p>I have tried some other code where I pass in CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.  I know it can't be from CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture, since explorer does it right with just the R&amp;L set correctly.</p>

<p>What am I missing?  Why does explorer and the DateTimePicker show it correctly, but the labels do not?</p>

<p>(trust me I have really googled this and found nothing on this specific problem)</p>

<p>Hi I'm trying to make a hover in each checkbox. What I now have is that the hover occurs in each checkbox. When I click around the checkbox then you see a dropdownlist. But when I click away from the dropdownlist. Then the caret arrow should go away, but unfortunately it doesn't. I have also recorded myself to show you more clearly what I actually want:</p>

<p>I have not found one example/tutorial which covers a distributed cache with a shared index, and I consider my google-fu to be great. I have asked on the infinispan community forum but havent gotten any replies there.</p>

<p>The errors I get are all related to the fact that only one node can be able to write to the index (the master node) but the config above, which according some the documentation on Hibernet Search should make one node a master node, does nothing as far as I can se.</p>

<p>For example, in case of carry flag and ADD instruction, I simply check the value after addition, if it exceeds 0xFF then the flag is raised. But this gives incorrect values in some cases.</p>

<pre><code>$('#OnDemandData').change(function () {

       //Select all the HTML elements where ondemand-field CSS class not applied

<p>The idea is once all the elements are selected , I can add the ondemand-field CSS class with ""readonly"" attribute so that the label color get changed.</p>

<p>The problem is how to get my collaborator started. He has an account on github. he set it up with ssh keys and such. In the admin view on github I added him as a collaborator, but we don't know the next step.</p>

"2354524","1","2354583","","2010-03-01 08:15:08","","0","180","<p>So I'm currently working on a project that involves the collection and storing of some huge datasets (as far as what I'm used to working with). The data essentially consists of meta information, and then actual values (where the values are trended over time).</p>

<p>The meta information itself is relatively large, but nothing huge, I would probably say its going to grow the the 10-50 million row size over the next couple of years. This seems manageable to me, and a single beefy SQL Server should be enough to provide quick access to this data if it is decently indexed (and the data is very easy to index, with very defined boundaries)...</p>

<p>However, the trending data is a completely different story. Within a year, we are VERY easily going to be pulling in 40-50 million rows every day, and that could realistically double yearly for the next 3 or 4 years.</p>

<p>This trending data also has very defined boundaries that would split it into MUCH more manageable sized chunks. I'm hoping I can set up some sort of partitioning mechanism that would spread this data across multiple physical database nodes. The data is essentially all contained in a single table. I looked into SQL Server table partitioning, but couldn't find a way to spread the data over multiple servers.</p>

<p>My question is whether there is some ""relatively simple"" way of implementing table partitioning over multiple physical nodes. I've also spent some time looking at Sql Server PDW, but its difficult to find information online, and I don't want to pursue that until I've established that there is not simple way of implementing this sort of solution using features built into SQL Server.</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated...</p>

<p>Resizing is done using PHP's GD, as Imagick is not available.</p>

<p>These images are about 2/4 MB a piece and the client uploads about 30 images in one shot. 
I used HTML5's multiple="""" attribute which all works fine.</p>

<p>In tests all worked fine because I used Windows standard wallpaper images.</p>

<p>I can't find the source of the problem.
When uploading more then 1 image, the script failes debugging tells me it does upload the second image but won't resize.</p>

<p>I checked the memory usage for the images which is aprox <strong>105724352 bytes</strong> each. </p>

<p>My PHP ini settings:</p>

<pre><code>max_execution_time = 300     
max_input_time = 600    
memory_limit = 200M

<p>So you see at the second image the memory reached it limit, making my script stop. Is that correct?</p>

<p>If so, how wise is it to upgrade the memory limit?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>It now seems the GD Function <code>imagecreatefromjpeg</code> cant handle files with a resolution bigger then 3500px wide, my files are bigger then 5000px wide.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a work arround for this?
At this point I am wondering if it is wise to have the client on a shared host at all if he needs so much memory for these images.</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('article.views',
    url(r'^send_article$', 'send_article', name='send_article'),
    url(r'^my_articles$', 'show_my_articles', name='my_articles'),

<pre><code>{% if not deleted %}
Hey, are you sure you want to delete {{ article.title }}?

"22153912","1","","","2014-03-03 18:00:16","","1","51","<p>I'm just starting out with WPF and I want to use custom commands whenever possible as part of the MVVM pattern. The book that I've been using (C# 2010 All-in-One for Dummies) has a sample of a custom command but it uses hard coded information to complete its task and I don't see how to use the Command system to complete <em>my</em> task.</p>

<p><strong>Book Code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public abstract class CommandBase : ICommand
{
    public string Text { get; internal set; }

    public abstract void Execute(object parameter);

    public abstract bool CanExecute(object parameter);

    public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged
    {
        add { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; }
        remove { CommandManager.RequerySuggested -= value; }
    }
}

public class AddCustomerCommand : CommandBase
{
    public AddCustomerCommand()
    {
        Text = “Add Customer”;
    }

    public override void Execute(object parameter)
    {
        var list = parameter as IList&lt;Customer&gt;;
        if (list == null)
        {
            return;
        }
        list.Add(new Customer { ID = 4, Name = “New Customer”} );
    }

    public override bool CanExecute(object parameter)
    {
        return parameter is IList&lt;Customer&gt;;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>Execute</code> works because it is passed an <code>IList&lt;Customer&gt;</code> and can add to it without needing to return anything. This makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p><strong>My Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I have an MVVM app that has a data grid, some text boxes, and some buttons. My view model has <code>IList&lt;Entry&gt; Entries</code>, properties for the text boxes, and of course an instance of my custom command <code>AddEntryCommand</code>. The goal is to be able to enter text, and hit add, and have a new <code>Entry</code> be added to <code>Entries</code> using <code>AddEntryCommand</code>.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is how to go about getting <code>Entries</code> and the new data into the command. Here are the possible solutions I've thought of and what I see wrong with them</p>

<ol>
<li>Pass in the view model so that all its information is available.</li>
<li>Pass in an array of objects.</li>
<li><p>Pass in a <code>Tuple</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Passing thew view model seems excessive, and if I do that then everything on the view model would have to be mutable.</li>
<li>I try and avoid using <code>object</code> whenever possible, and <code>object[]</code> seems even more work to deal with. I'd have to pick it apart like command line arguments.</li>
<li>Tuples... </li>
<li>My idea of a command is that it's supposed to be a method with bells and whistles for making the UI react nicely. Anything that causes the command to be tied to a specific view or view model breaks that.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<p><strong>How do you do work with multiple objects using <code>ICommand</code>?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can you use <code>ICommand</code> to work with immutable objects if it's locked to return <code>void</code>?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is my idea of what a command is for way off base?</strong></p>

<p>(I've tried searching for a better tutorial or resource for this but my Google fu is weak and I can't seem to locate anything that's clear and concise. There are lots of questions on SO about commands in WPF, but they're all for very specific implementations. I'm looking for a general answer regarding manipulating multiple objects in one command.)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I have been looking around the net some more but I still haven't found anything like the sample provided by my book. I have looked at <code>DelegateCommand</code> and that seems like a pretty straightforward and easy to use system. It still leaves me wondering why such a large chunk of the chapter on MVVM would be dedicated to creating a custom command using just <code>ICommand</code> and not one of the other classes that already inherit from it.</p>

<p>So if I for example added 2 elements to dogs and 1 to animals, then looked at how many elements animals has I would see 3.</p>

<p>Alternatively I could put references to the above mentioned 3 elements in each, giving animals 3 elements and dogs 2. I'd still have the two separate, overlapping lists which is desirable, however adding and removing elements could become tricky, in this simple example having to add or remove from both collections in the case of adding and removing dogs.</p>

This is great, however I can't seem to find any documentation on how to output a configured URL as a string without the image tag (to use as the <code>data-medium</code> attribute). I could manually configure the URL, but I was wondering if there was a better way?</p>

<p>Since a 32k texture is hardly accessible for older graphics cards supporting 1k-2k sized textures, and scaling a 32k image to 1k loses a tremendous amount of detail, I've resolved to splitting each source map by projecting each into 6 cube faces to make up a cubemap, so that more detail can be displayed on older cards.</p>

<p>However, I'm having trouble actually displaying these cubemapped spheres with three.js. I can set the <a href=""http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Materials/MeshPhongMaterial.envMap"" rel=""nofollow""><code>MeshPhongMaterial.envMap</code></a> to my cubemap, but of course this makes the sphere mesh reflect the texture instead.</p>

<p>An acceptable result can be produced by using <code>ShaderMaterial</code> along with <a href=""https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib.js#L639"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ShaderLib['cube']</code></a> to ""fake"" a skysphere of some sort. But this drops all ability for lighting, normal mapping and all the other handy (and pretty) things possible with <code>MeshPhongMaterial</code>.</p>

<p>If at all possible, I'd like to not have to write an entire shader from scratch for such a simple tweak (switching one <code>texture2D</code> call to <code>textureCube</code>). Is there a way to coerce three.js to read the diffuse term from a cubemap instead of a 2D texture, or a simple way to edit the shader three.js uses internally?</p>

GarageBand does something like this when you drag to reorder tracks (video here: <a href=""http://www.screencast.com/t/OmUVHcCNSl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.screencast.com/t/OmUVHcCNSl</a>). As far as I can tell, there's no built in support for this in NSTableView. </p>

<p>Has anyone else tried to add this behavior to NSTableView and found a good solution? I've thought of and tried a couple approaches without much success. My first thought was to double the height of the row under the mouse during a drag by sending <code>-noteHeightOfRowsWithIndexesChanged:</code> in my data source's <code>-tableView:validateDrop:...</code> method, then returning twice the normal height in <code>-tableView:heightOfRow:</code>. Unfortunately, best I can tell, NSTableView doesn't update its layout during drag and drop, so despite calling <code>noteHeightOfRowsWithIndexesChanged:</code>, the row height isn't actually updated.</p>

<p>Note that I'm using a view-based NSTableView, but my rows are not so complex that I couldn't move to a cell-based table view if doing so helped accomplish this. I'm aware of the easy, built-in ability to animate a gap for the dropped item after a drag is complete. I'm looking for a way to open a gap while the drag is in progress. Also, this is for an app to be sold in the Mac App Store, so it must not use private API.</p>

<p>EDIT: I've just filed an enhancement request with Apple requesting built in support for this behavior: <a href=""http://openradar.appspot.com/12662624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openradar.appspot.com/12662624</a>. <strike>Dupe if you'd like to see it too.</strike> Update: The enhancement I requested was implemented in OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and this behavior is now available using NSTableView API.

<p>Which causes the following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>The C++ script doesn't accept the self-closing empty tags </li>
<li>The C++script can't deal with the SOAP header</li>
<li>The XML structure I get from my client has another level of elements
(otherchild) which makes it get stuck at just one readout of
otherchild.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any way I can use TinyXML to parse this? The only thing I need are the different properties of the elements. I don't need to write XML. I have had a look at a couple of different XML parsing libraries, but I couldn't find one that provides me with more help and/or examples.. any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

<p>Here is the basic http server code: </p>

<pre><code>var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (request, response) {

response.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
    'Access-Control-Allow-origin': '*' // implementation of CORS
});

response.end(""ok"");
;
}).listen(8080,'0.0.0.0');
</code></pre>

<p>Using the request.on('data') function, I am able to decode JSON from requests and proceed that to make a database call:</p>

<pre><code>request.on('data', function (chunk) {
    var json = JSON.parse(chunk);
    var id = parseInt(json[""id""]);
    response.end(callDatabase(id));
});
</code></pre>

<p>The database function goes something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function callDatabase(id) {
    var result;
    var connection = mysql.createConnection(
        {
            host        :   '192.168.1.14',
            user        :   'root',
            password    :   '',
            database    :   'test'
        }
    );

    connection.connect();
    var queryString = 'SELECT name FROM test WHERE id = 1';

    connection.query(queryString, function(err, rows, fields) {
        if (err) throw err;

        for (var i in rows) {
            result = rows[i].name;
        }
    });
    connection.end();
    return result;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However under testing, this proves that I am doing it wrong. I am aware that I probably want to be using the node asynchronous module, which I have tired. I have also tried using the waterfall method, as well as parallel and many other tutorials online. I feel that the request.on function should be in parallel, then the database call async, so whilst node is waiting for the response from the database server, it is free to get on with any other requests, leaving the queued time to a minimum. </p>

<p>Please inform me if I have miss-understood any of the concepts of node js. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Setting both <code>Nearest</code> filters for minification and magification with increasing <code>paddingX</code> and disabling antialiasing solved issue, but final image become too ugly! Is there way to avoid disabling antialiasing? Because without it, downscale look awful.</p>

<p>The question I have here is what is it about Objective-C that causes the <code>typedef NSString MyString</code> to effectively create a struct that contains one variable of type <code>Class</code> and then uses that where I use <code>MyString</code>. e.g. the struct looks like this (after consulting <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>):</p>

<pre><code>struct NSString {
    Class a;
};
</code></pre>

<p>It sort of makes sense but causes the <code>valueForKey:</code> to fail, presumably because it's a struct now, so it can't return that in the same way as objects. Or more precisely, it falls into the ""throw exception"" part of the search order <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/SearchImplementation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000955-138234-BAJCAJGJ"" rel=""nofollow"">described in the docs</a>.</p>

<p>I'd just like to understand what it is about the language that causes this to happen and why it can't treat my 2 typedefs in the same way.</p>

<p>I have a view that is updating a user's profile. I can retrieve the profile via </p>

<p>and modify it. I then call the save method:</p>

<p>However, I see that the changes are not being saved. My view then redirects the user to another page. In order to verify that this is not happening in the subsequent page load, I reselect the profile, again using get_profile(), and when I call </p>

<pre><code>logging.info(profile.__dict__)

<p>The json should be valid because it is being returned from a service, and I use the same code to create the model in the first place.</p>

<p>There is no custom validation in the model, nothing that I could see that could cause this issue.</p>

<p>The problem is that the <code>event</code> is running async and thus performs the deletion, and not waiting for the user to click OK (calling the callback). </p>

<p>The deleteConfirm takes the following arguments</p>

<p>The content in the pop up consists of:</p>

<pre><code>var bodyContent = '&lt;div class=""vl-info vl-message""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'+titleText+'&lt;/h2&gt;'+

</code></pre>

<p>And the button functions:</p>

<pre><code>A.one('.deleteOK').on('click', function(e){

I then installed the latest version of wamp (I have to use apache because i'm doing wildcard domains, and IIS doesn't support them).  I migrated my sites (files, database records, and DNS entries) over to the new server from the old one.</p>

<p>WAMP runs the sites correctly for anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes and then takes about 30 seconds to load a page.  </p>

<p>After doing some search, I found that it's because Windows Server 2012 is set to use IPv6 by default while apache is set to use IPv4.  The website I've visited have given me several things to do to fix this issue - which includes:</p>

<p>1) commenting out ::1 from the hosts file
2) Disabling IIS (which is on by default in Windows Server 2012
3) Changing my apache.conf file to ""Listen 0.0.0.0:80"" instead of ""Listen 80""
4) Changing my apache.conf file to ""ServerName localhost"" instead of ""ServerName 127.0.0.1""</p>

<p>I can restart all the wamp services and the pages will start to load immediately again, but then after another 5 to 10 minutes, the same issue occurs where the pages take forever to load.</p>

<p>I've made all of these changes mentioned above, but the problem still persists.  Other than starting up a new server that's not running Windows Server 2012, I'm out of ideas.</p>

<p>For instance if we have</p>



<pre class=""lang-ps prettyprint-override""><code>Function Do-Something
{
 Param(
  [HideIfObjectHasPropertyNamed(""NoPath"")]
  [string] $Path
 )    
 ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And if i have two Objects Test1 and Test2</p>

<p>Test1 HAS NoPath as a property
Test2 does not</p>

<p>So when I write out </p>

<pre class=""lang-ps prettyprint-override""><code>Test1 | Do-Something -
</code></pre>

<p>After the dash I expect Path to be completely missing from the intellisense list of possible parameters</p>

<p>But with this</p>

<pre class=""lang-ps prettyprint-override""><code>Test2 | Do-Something -Path
</code></pre>

<p>I expect Path to be an available option</p>

<p>Obviously I know HideIfObjectHasPropertyNamed is not a valid parameter attribute I'm wondering if there is a way with the existing parameter attributes to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>I'm still learning the ins and outs of powershell and all the nuances of Parameters are not known to me</p>

<p>If this just is not possible that's fine It would have just made a cmdlet a little friendlier to pass along to other users</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for the suggestions and help</p>

I will try to simplify my situation. Let's say I have
a company entity, which has 3 fields. </p>

<pre><code>Company {
  protected name;
  protected tags;
  protected images; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Images is array of CompanyImage entities, which serve for
storing image files and tags contains array of Tag entities,
which can be m:n connected with companies.</p>

<p>In the form I use jquery, for adding tags and images dynamically.
(you can create images and add them to the company similar to the
collection type symfony tutorial)</p>

<p>Because  images and tag arrays are created with jquery, I cannot
simply use something like the turorial line below in the functional test of the company form. </p>

<pre><code>$form['images'][0]-&gt;upload('/path/to/image.jpg');
</code></pre>

<p>For the setting
of the form values I use simple a little trick described by sstok here 
(<a href=""https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/4124"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/4124</a>)</p>

<pre><code>public function testCompanyCreation() {
...
  //option1
  $image = new UploadedFile(
    '/path/to/image.jpg',
    'image.jpg',
    'image/jpeg',
     123
  );

 //or option2
//$image = array('tmp_name' =&gt; '/path/to/image.jpg', 'name' =&gt; 'image.jpg', 'type' =&gt; 'image/jpeg', 'size' =&gt; 300, 'error' =&gt; UPLOAD_ERR_OK);

  $companyFormNode = $companyCrawler-&gt;selectButton('Create');
  $companyForm = $companyFormNode-&gt;form();
  $values = array(
      'company' =&gt; array(
          '_token' =&gt; $companyForm['company[_token]']-&gt;getValue(),
          'name' =&gt; 'test company',
          'tags' =&gt; array('1'),
          'images' =&gt; array('0' =&gt; (array('file' =&gt;$image))),
      ),
  );
  $companySubmitCrawler = $client-&gt;request($companyForm-&gt;getMethod(), $companyForm-&gt;getUri(), $values, $companyForm-&gt;getPhpFiles());    
}
</code></pre>

<p>this works perfectly until I try to upload the image file.
With the <strong>option1</strong> I get following exception </p>

<pre><code>Exception: Serialization of 'Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile' is not allowed
</code></pre>

<p>when I use <strong>option2</strong> I get this</p>

<pre><code>Argument 1 passed to Acme\myBundle\Entity\CompanyImage::setFile() must be an instance of Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile, array given, called in ...\PropertyAccess\PropertyAccessor.php on line 347 and defined (500 Internal Server Error)
</code></pre>

<p>I would also like to point out, that the whole form and uploading of the files works without any problems in the browser. I also tried to make the entities serializable, and it didn't help. Do I have a bug somewhere?</p>

spring-rabbit to programmatically setup all my queues, bindings and exchanges.</p>

<p>I'm trying to recreate an queue if it was deleted and found the following in the reference documentation :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>3.14 Listener Container Queues</strong></p>
  
  <p>Version 1.3 introduced a number of improvements for handling multiple queues in a listener container.</p>
  
  <p>The container must be configured to listen on at least one queue; this was the case previously too, but now queues can be added and removed at runtime. <strong>The container will recycle (cancel and re-create)</strong> the consumers when any pre-fetched messages have been processed. See methods addQueues, addQueueNames, removeQueues and removeQueueNames. When removing queues, at least one queue must remain.</p>
  
  <p>A consumer will now start if any of its queues are available - previously the container would stop if any queues were unavailable. Now, this is only the case if none of the queues are available. If not all queues are available, the container will attempt to passively declare (and consume from) the missing queue(s) every 60 seconds.
  ... (source: <a href=""http://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/1.3.4.RELEASE/reference/html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/1.3.4.RELEASE/reference/html</a> was down during the time of writing)</p>

2. How can I handle the binding for a flash object to this cell?</p>

<p>I'm trying to create a c# windows application that would have just a next button that would in turn click the correct button in the security applications. Is there a simple way (I'm pretty new to c, used pascal for 3 years) to do this? I've found something about using autoit, but that requires me to import a dll. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

The first table is master table in which names of sub-tables is recorded, linked with their respective sub-tables and the table name is also defined in the PHP code so there is no problem in entering data into that table. </p>

<p>The problem comes from the second tables. I will show u the code.</p>

<p>The first page, to make entry into master table:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""add.php"" align=""center"" method=""GET""&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter the field: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""name1"" size=""30""/&gt;
&lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submit"" size=""25"" value=""ok""/&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>My second page, add.php, to make entry into master table and creating a new table:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$area=$_GET[""name1""];
mysql_connect(""localhost"", ""root"") or die(mysql_error());
mysql_select_db(""test"") or die(mysql_error());
mysql_query(""INSERT INTO main (item_id) values('$area')""); 
mysql_query(""CREATE TABLE $area (item VARCHAR(30), budget INT, priority INT)""); 
print (""&lt;h3&gt;Now enter the details of&lt;b&gt; $area&lt;/h3&gt;"");
?&gt;
&lt;form action=""field.php"" method=""POST""&gt;
&lt;b&gt; enter the field:- &lt;/b&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" name=""name"" size=""30""/&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Amount &lt;/b&gt; &lt;input type=""integer"" name=""value1"" size=""10""/&gt;
&lt;b&gt; priority &lt;/b&gt; &lt;input type=""integer"" name=""value"" size=""10""/&gt;
&lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submit"" size=""25"" value=""submit""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now third page, field.php, here error shows up. The value of <code>$area</code> (which is coming from first page) in second page goes of as i click submit button in second page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$feild=$_GET[""name""];
$amount=$_GET[""value1""];
$priority=$_GET[""value""];
mysql_connect(""localhost"", ""root"") or die(mysql_error());
mysql_select_db(""test"") or die(mysql_error());
mysql_query(""INSERT INTO $area (item, budget, priority) values('$feild',
            '$amount','$priority')"");
print (""&lt;h3&gt;Now enter the details of&lt;b&gt; $area&lt;/h3&gt;"");
?&gt;
&lt;form action=""&lt;?php print $_SERVER[""PHP_SELF""]; ?&gt;"" method=""POST""&gt;
&lt;b&gt; enter the feild:- &lt;/b&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" name=""name"" size=""30""/&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Amount &lt;/b&gt; &lt;input type=""integer"" name=""value1"" size=""10""/&gt;
&lt;b&gt; priority &lt;/b&gt; &lt;input type=""integer"" name=""value"" size=""10""/&gt;
&lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submit"" size=""25"" value=""submit""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and in the third page as I click the submit button page reloads and all the previous data vanishes which comes from the back pages.</p>

<p>Please let me know the fault. How I can solve this problem please help me out.</p>

I'm using a public code and I was curious to look at one of their ""grow array"" template, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  template &lt;typename TYPE&gt;
    TYPE *grow(TYPE *&amp;array, int n, const char *name)
    {
      if (array == NULL) return create(array,n,name);

      bigint nbytes = ((bigint) sizeof(TYPE)) * n;
      array = (TYPE *) srealloc(array,nbytes,name);
      return array;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and the function <strong>srealloc</strong> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>void *Memory::srealloc(void *ptr, bigint nbytes, const char *name)
{
  if (nbytes == 0) {
    destroy(ptr);
    return NULL;
  }

  ptr = realloc(ptr,nbytes);
  if (ptr == NULL) {
error();
  }
  return ptr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please disregard the <strong>create</strong> function for now. My main question is why do they pointer-cast and dereference <code>array</code> in the template? What's the advantage of that? What if they just didn't have <code>*&amp;</code> at all?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Description of the problem:</p>
  
  <p>Floor in a room the size of M × N paved with parquet. However, some
  tile flooring were broken. Peter decided to redecorate the room by
  replacing the damaged cells. He found that the parquet tiles come in
  two types - the size of 1 × 2, which cost A coins (a little thought,
  Peter realized that the 1 × 2 tiles can be rotated 90 degrees, thereby
  producing tiles 2 × 1) and size 1 × 1, which are B coins. Peter cannot
  divide double tiles by two.</p>
  
  <p>Find the minimum cost to repair floor.</p>
  
  <p>Specifications: Input: The first line contains the four numbers: N, M,
  A, B ( 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 300 , A, B - integers modulo not exceeding 1000).
  Each of the next N lines contains M characters: ""."" (dot) represents
  unspoiled tile flooring, and the symbol ""*"" (asterisk) - damaged. At
  the end of the rows can go insignificant spaces. At the end of the
  file may be empty strings.</p>
  
  <p>Output: a single number - the minimum amount of money to repair.</p>

<p>When I package the CloudService project in VS2015, the package creates fine with both WebRoles built and within the package as expected. It uploads to Azure and both WebRoles are active and error free.</p>

<p>However, if I build with MSBuild through the command line :</p>

<pre>
msbuild /t:corepublish;package /p:visualstudioversion=14.0;targetframeworkversion=4.5;roletargetframework=4.5;config
uration=debug
</pre>

<p>I receive the following error during CorePublish :</p>

<p>As you can see, MSBuild is looking for WebRole1 here : <code>c:\mywork\WebRole1</code> whereas it should be looking here : <code>c:\mywork\myproject\WebRole1</code>.</p>

<p>So why is packaging the cloud service working inside VS2015, yet not with MSBuild ?</p>

<p>Lets explain this with an example.</p>

<p>There is a web application WAR_FILE.
There is a rest client named REST_CLIENT.
There is a jar file that has api methods for client REST_CLIENT named as MY_JAR.</p>

<p><strong>Now WAR_FILE will be using MY_JAR to post data to REST_CLIENT.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But WAR_FILE does not want to wait for its response.Its like post data and do not care for response.</strong>
MY_JAR will take all inputs from WAR_FILE and store it in a queue as cache.I am using redis to maintain this queue as cache.</p>

<p>The main problem is MY_JAR has to check every time that if there is any request in that queue to act upon.</p>

<p><strong>Sol 1:</strong> use quartz in MY_JAR to check after every n seconds,if there is any new request to act upon.</p>

<p>problem1 : The WAR_FILE may itself be using some quartz.</p>

<p>problem2 : If one thread is executing a list of tasks from queue and other thread comes and start executing the same request.</p>

<p>I want to modify the matplotlib toolbar to add another checkable button which sets a mode for selecting data points in response to a pick event.  It almost all works, except that the pick event is not sent when the zoom or pan navigation buttons are selected.  </p>

<p>What I am looking for is a way to programmatically turn off pan and zoom modes.  I thought I would be able to do this by setting the checked state of the toolbar pan and zoom buttons to False.  This appears to work (for example if the zoom button is checked, setting to false makes it appear to be unchecked).  However it does not change the mode of the canvas - the cursor is still the zoom cursor, and the pick event doesn't fire.  </p>

I have api key and can receive fields from Standard view.</p>

<p>Here is example:</p>

<p>Firstly, initialization (api, searching query and headers)</p>

<pre><code>import json
import requests

api_resource = ""https://api.elsevier.com/content/search/scopus?""
search_param = 'query=title-abs-key(big data)'  # for example

# headers
headers = dict()
headers['X-ELS-APIKey'] = api_key
headers['X-ELS-ResourceVersion'] = 'XOCS'
headers['Accept'] = 'application/json'
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can receive article json (for example, first article from first page):</p>

<pre><code># request with first searching page
page_request = requests.get(api_resource + search_param, headers=headers)
# response to json
page = json.loads(page_request.content.decode(""utf-8""))
# List of articles from this page
articles_list = page['search-results']['entry']

article = articles_list[0]
</code></pre>

<p>I can easily get some main fields from standard view:</p>

<pre><code>title = article['dc:title']
cit_count = article['citedby-count']
authors = article['dc:creator']
date = article['prism:coverDate']
</code></pre>

<p>However, I need keywords and citations of this article.
I solved problem with keywords with additional request to article's url:</p>

<pre><code>article_url = article['prism:url']
# something like this:
# 'http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84909993848'
</code></pre>

<p>with field=authkeywords</p>

<pre><code>article_request = requests.get(article_url + ""?field=authkeywords"", headers=headers)
article_keywords = json.loads(article_request.content.decode(""utf-8""))
keywords = [keyword['$'] for keyword in article_keywords['abstracts-retrieval-response']['authkeywords']['author-keyword']]
</code></pre>

<p>This method works, but sometimes keywords are missing. Also, scopus api-key has limit of requests (10000 per week), and this way not optimal.</p>

<p><strong>Can I make it easier?</strong></p>

<p>Next question about citations. To find citations of articles, I'm send one more request again, by use article['eid'] field:</p>

<pre><code>citations_response = requests.get(api_resource + 'query=refeid(' + str(article['eid']) + ')', headers=headers)
citations_result = json.loads(citations_response.content.decode(""utf-8""))
citations = citations_result['search-results']['entry']  # list of citations
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So, can I get citations, without additional request?</strong></p>

<p>In the mentioned app's <a href=""https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server#available-options"" rel=""nofollow"">execution options</a>, it is listed as ""Display autoIndex"", discrete from another option ""Show directory listings"". I understand the latter (Show directory listings) to mean that the app will, in the event of a user's navigating to a directory missing a file with the default extension, construct a web page displaying a list of links to the files and subfolders within that directory. However, I do not understand what <strong>autoIndex</strong> means, as I cannot find an authoritative definition of it online.

The files are on file system, however references are in the database, as I'm using PAPERCLIP.  Using AUTHLOGIC for authentication.  I'm finding the response times are quite bad, as each request for HTML/image etc have to go through the Rails layers I guess of AUTHLOGIC, PAPERCLIP then stream back.  </p>

<p><strong>Q1 - How can I get benchmark times that start right from the first point the HTTP request hits the rails app, through to when it's ready to start streaming back the request (i.e. to avoid network traffic variations)?</strong>  </p>

<p>I'm using ""benchmark"" in my controller however I'm pretty sure I'm missing other delays like: authentication via AuthLogic, etc...  For example I'm roughly doing</p>

<pre><code>  def find
    self.class.benchmark(""BENCHMARK REPORT"") do
      search_path = params[:path] * ""/""
      webfile = Webfile.find_by_path( search_path )
      if webfile
        send_file webfile.file.path , :type =&gt; webfile.file_content_type, :disposition =&gt; 'inline'
      else
        render :text =&gt; ""COULD NOT FIND YOUR FILE WITH PATH = #{params [:path]}""
      end
    end
  end

<p><strong>Q2 - Given I want users to authenticate for HTML &amp; associated files (CSS, images) then page needs, is there any obvious way to get an order of magnitude improvement?</strong> I guess I could save in session state the list of children files a HTML page needs &amp; get its file location path, until the subsequent requests come, and that would some a database lookup (at the expense of using session state)?</p>

<p>I have read the best practices so directories are organized as per best practice, with just one bundle named AppBundle, and I'm using annotations.</p>

<p>I have an issue with business logic. I've read that I should not put business logic inside controllers. As the vast majority of my code was not meant to be reused I put the logic inside the controllers. Yesterday I read <a href=""http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/question-answer-day/model-organization"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that ""logic should live in the controller unless you’re going to unit test it or until you need to re-use it"" and this made me faint: am I not going to unit test if I put my logic inside controllers?</p>

<p>I understand that ""controllers should be as lean as possible, with few lines of code to glue stuff together"". But what about forms? A form often has a logic like ""display the form, if it's valid do something and display another page"". Now if I'm going to put the form creation and logic inside a service (or a model?) I'd have to put the page render command inside that, so basically the controller would be 1 line, with all the rest inside the service, and the actual decision of which page to display would be done inside the service, not the controller itself...so what's the point of a controller, just the routing?</p>

<p>I really need to understand this before proceeding (i've already developed 3 months on this and I'd have to rework a lot, but better now than never)...</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>EDIT: some additional considerations to address some of the comments below.</p>

<p>I have a clear understanding of how forms work in Symfony, with the creation of the form and it's management with the ""isValid()"" in the same place.</p>

<p>Let's imagine the following controller which performs the following operations:</p>

<pre><code>get the current customer from security context
queries the DB to get the field $user-&gt;getIsBillable()
if the user is not billable
    queries the DB to find if someone else is paying for him
else //the user is billable
    create and manage form1
if the user is not billable but there is someone who is paying for him
    check if the license is active (I have to call an external API)
    if the license is not ok
        redirect to a page to update credit card info
if the user is not billable
    create and manage form2
else
    create and manage form3
render the license management page with all the necessary forms created  
</code></pre>

<p>What would be supposed to do? Put all this stuff into a service which would return the forms (or null if a form is not created)? Consider that in the ""is valid"" of some of the forms I render the same page with simply updated info. Or should I create a service foreach of the forms creation and keep the logic in the controller? </p>

<p>The alerts are working perfectly but the ajax isnt passing those ID's into the controller, the controller is just receiving nulls.</p>

<pre><code> public decimal GetBrandCost(string idp, string id)
    {
        decimal costp = 0;
        decimal cost = 0;
        if (id == """" || id == null || idp == """" || idp == null)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        ShockBrand brandp = db.ShockBrands.Find(idp);
        costp = brandp.Cost;
        ShockBrand brand = db.ShockBrands.Find(id);
        cost = brand.Cost;
        cost = cost - costp;
        return cost;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Since they are null I am hitting my if statement and just returning zero inside the success. Most of the things I read were to add the content type but that didnt seem to help in my case, Im sure it is something little.</p>

<pre><code>describe 'sabah', →
    beforeEach →
        @sabahStrategy = _.filter(@strats, { name: 'sabah2' })[0]
            .strat

    it 'article list should be populated', (done) →
        @timeout 10000

        articles.take(2).toArray( (result)→
            _.each(result, (articleList) →

                // I make the assertions here
                // assert(false)
                assert(articleList.length &gt; 1)
            )
            done()
        )
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, whenever I do <code>assert(false)</code>, the test hangs until the timeout, instead of giving an assertion error, why?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>For example if I have these two tests</p>

<pre><code>    it 'assert false', (done) →
        assert(false)
        done()

    it 'article link stream should be populated', (done) →
        @timeout 20000
        articles = @sabahStrategy.articleLinkStream('barlas')
        articles.pull((err, result)→
            console.log('here')
            assert(false)
            console.log('after')
            assert(!err)
            assert(result.length &gt; 1);
            _.each(result, (articleList) →
                assert(articleList.link)
            )
            done()
        )
</code></pre>

<p>The first one, gives the assertion error as expected, the second one, logs <code>here</code>, and hangs at <code>assert(false)</code> so <code>after</code> is never logged. It has something to do with <code>articles</code> being a stream and the assertion is within a <code>pull</code> callback, this is from the <a href=""http://highlandjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">highland.js API</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Solved Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>So according to Paul I fixed the problem with this code:</p>

<pre><code>    it 'article stream should be populated', (done) →
        @timeout 30000
        articles = @sabahStrategy.articleStream('barlas')

        articles.pull((err, result) →
            try
                # assert false properly throws now.
                assert(false)
                assert(!err)
                assert(result.length == 1)
                assert(result[0].body)
                assert(result[0].title || result[0].title2)
                done()
            catch e
                done(e)
        )
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit2</strong>:</p>

<p>I've produced a simplified version of the problem:</p>

<pre><code>h = require('highland')
Q = require('q')

describe 'testasynchigh', →
    beforeEach →
        @deferred = Q.defer()
        setTimeout((→
            @deferred.resolve(1)
        ).bind(this), 50)


    it 'should throw', (done) →
        s = h(@deferred.promise);
        s.pull((err, result) →
            console.log result
            assert false
            done()
        )
</code></pre>

<p>I see your version does indeed work @Louis, but if you involve promises into the mix, mocha can't handle the problem, so it will hang in this example. Also try commenting out the <code>assert false</code> and see it passes. </p>

<p>So Louis I hope I got your attention, could you explain the problem, and <code>try catch</code> looks ugly indeed and I hope you find a reasonable solution to this.</p>

I've obtained an API key and an API secret from Flickr.  Additionally I am retrieving an authToken using the AuthGetFrob method from the FlickrNet library.  </p>

<p><strong>My Using Statements are as Follows</strong></p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using FlickrNet;
</code></pre>

<p>I have created two methods to accomplish this task. </p>

<p><strong>One which gets and returns the AuthToken</strong> </p>

<pre><code>private string GetAuthenticateToken()
{
    Flickr flickr = new Flickr(FLICKR_API_KEY, FLICKR_API_SECRET);

    string frob = flickr.AuthGetFrob();

    return flickr.AuthCalcUrl(frob, AuthLevel.Write);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And One the Uploads the File Using that AuthToken</strong></p>

<pre><code>public void UploadFile(string fileName, string title, string description)
{
    try
    {

        string authToken = GetAuthenticateToken();

        Flickr flickr = new Flickr(FLICKR_API_KEY, FLICKR_API_SECRET, authToken);


        string photoId = flickr.UploadPicture(fileName, title, description, """", true, false, false);
        }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        throw ex;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I make the call to 'UploadPicture' the following exception is thrown. 'Invalid auth token (98)'.  </p>

<p>The contents of the AuthRequest Http request looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;rsp stat=""ok""&gt;
&lt;frob&gt;72157627073829842-9d8e31b9dcf41ea1-162888&lt;/frob&gt;
&lt;/rsp&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the content of the Upload methods Http request looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;rsp stat=""fail""&gt;
    &lt;err code=""98"" msg=""Invalid auth token"" /&gt;
&lt;/rsp&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I saw a similar post on the flickr forums <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157623839999993/"">here</a> but based on my understanding, it appears that I am doing everything right yet still cannot figure what I am doing wrong.  </p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.  </p>

<p>I'm experimenting with exception handling / error trapping and was wondering why the below code doesn't work. I'm using python 2.7. I understand the difference between <code>input()</code> and <code>raw_input()</code> and understand that <code>raw_input()</code> has been renamed to <code>input()</code> in Python 3.0. If I enter an integer then the code keeps looping until I enter a string. I get the below error message when entering a string. Is there a way around this or is this just one of those python quirks?</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>  File ""&lt;some_directory_path_goes_here&gt;"", line 30, in &lt;module&gt;

NameError: name '&lt;user_entered_string_goes_here&gt;' is not defined

<p>In python 2.7 it would seem to me that the code should still work.</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from types import IntType

    enterAge = input('Enter your age as an integer: ')

            age = age + num

The requirement is that the users will access the <strong>PUBLIC</strong> domain and get the content from the <strong>PRIVATE</strong> domain. The <strong>PUBLIC</strong> domain should be empty and contain only the .htaccess file used for users authentication.
All the requests will come to <code>http://public.com:60001/</code> and get rewritten by apache to <code>http://private:60001/</code>. Users cannot access <strong>PRIVATE</strong> domain directly, but the server where <strong>PUBLIC</strong> domain is hosted has connection to it.</p>

<p>To achive this, I updated the virtual host of the <strong>PUBLIC</strong> domain to include this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory ""/wwwroot/public.com""&gt;
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://private:60001/$1 [P]
    ProxyPassReverse http://private:60001/
&lt;/Directory&gt;

<ol>
<li>All the links in html code of the pages of the website will be in the form of <code>http://private:60001/</code> so when the user is clicking on the links they get a 404 error (since they don't have connection to that). Is there a way for apache to rewrite those links to <code>http://public.com:60001/</code>?</li>
<li>Ajax calls don't work - a 404 error is generated. I think that maybe is because of the same issue as at point 1.</li>

Simple right? I'm trying to use the following rawQuery() to load 4 answers, all of them must be random, except the right answer that has to appear.</p>

<p><strong>SQLite:</strong></p>

<pre><code>myCursor = db.rawQuery(""SELECT * FROM Answers WHERE QuestionID = 3 ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 4"", null);
</code></pre>

<p>So, QuestionID is the field that is specifying which question is being displayed to load the proper answers. I'll need to have a lot of answers so that the player can't memorise them. Is something like this pseudo-code possible?</p>

<pre><code>myCursor = db.rawQuery(""SELECT * FROM Answers WHERE QuestionID = 3 ORDER BY RANDOM('WHERE RightWrong = 1 LIMIT 1') LIMIT 4"", null);
</code></pre>

<p>RightWrong is the field that tells if it's the right answer or not (inside the DB), it's an INT, if it is set to 1 then it is the correct answer.</p>

Usually, I've been working with relational databases and because I am new to couchbase I am having trouble finding the ""correct"" architecture. I do understand the core concepts I think, but all the samples and guides seem to stick to some kind of easy setup where they access the database right in the Activities.</p>

<p>I am more used to having some database abstraction where the business logic only get's to see POJO DTO's that are delivered through a database interface or some DAO or something. So I've now annotated my model classes and started writing a simple OR mapper, but with different types of data, foreign keys etc. this is getting quite time consuming quite fast.</p>

<p>Am I completely missing the point here somehow? I can't imagine everyone doing it this way? I everyone writing methods that convert Documents to POJO model classes for each class seperately? Or using a json parser to do that (But that won't work for foreign keys if I wan't to load them too, does it)?</p>

<p>Sorry for the load of questions, but I feel I am missing something obvious here. Thanks!</p>

<br/>I'm searching for ways of making transparent the migration for pieces of code already ported to Laravel, while mantaining functional older plain PHP code.
<br/><br/>For example, Laravel ""overwrites"" superglobals ($_GET, $_POST, etc.) using classes and methods, (ex. Input::get()). My plain PHP project of course makes direct use of superglobals. How can I overcome these ""uncompatibilities"" under Laravel without having to rewrite instantly all my PHP code?<br/><br/>Otherwise, if you think this task being too difficult, is there any PHP framework that, thanks to its internal structure, would make this task easier?</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE:</em></strong><br/>
The use of superglobals is still possible in laravel. I was getting a sneaky error: Laravel internally sets error_reporting to E_ALL and shows a custom error stack trace page even for PHP E_NOTICE, but <b>without explicitly specifying the error level</b> (that it is a NOTICE error), even if this was done by default by PHP error reporting message engine.<br/><br/>Let me say, for Laravel core developers, that I consider this ""partially silent"" behaviour as generally misleading for any PHP developer trying to port his code on to their framework.</p>

<p>This solution produces a single markdown document with a subdocument (at heading level 2) for each level of cylinder. However, I am trying to create a report that fetches a .csv and then creates and modifies a dataframe and produces content for each row of another dataframe.</p>

<p>What I think I am stuck on is how to use the value in {{ncyl}} to programmatically refer to rows of a database. I would like to be able to use the levels of {{ncyl}} to go and do stuff with the related rows in the dataframe mtcars (assuming that it only had rows == levels{{ncyl}} for this example).</p>

<p>While <code>data(mtcars)</code>, does have more rows than levels of cylyinder, R stores the value of {{ncyl}} as an integer. So, you can call <code>mtcars$gear[[{{ncyl}}]]</code> and get the value of gear for the {{ncyl}} row. </p>

<p>Why then, when we add that into our template.Rmd, it fails?</p>

<p>Forgive me, it doesn't fail, it will give us <code>gear &lt;- mtcars$gear[[{{ncyl}}]]</code> but we cannot then create a chunk of gear, like <code>```{r this-gear-{{gear}}}</code>.</p>

<p>This works</p>

<pre><code>```{r}
gear &lt;- mtcars$gear[[{{ncyl}}]]
gear
```

```{r, results='asis'}
cat(""### {{ncyl}} cylinders"")
```

```{r mpg-histogram-{{ncyl}}cyl}
hist(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == {{ncyl}}], 
  main = paste({{ncyl}}, ""cylinders""))
```

```{r weight-histogam-{{ncyl}}cyl}
hist(mtcars$wt[mtcars$cyl == {{ncyl}}], 
  main = paste({{ncyl}}, ""cylinders""))
```
</code></pre>

<p>This does not work</p>

<pre><code>```{r}
gear &lt;- mtcars$gear[[{{ncyl}}]]
gear
```

```{r, results='asis'}
cat(""### {{ncyl}} cylinders"")
```

```{r mpg-histogram-{{ncyl}}cyl}
hist(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == {{ncyl}}], 
  main = paste({{ncyl}}, ""cylinders""))
```

```{r weight-histogam-{{ncyl}}cyl}
hist(mtcars$wt[mtcars$cyl == {{ncyl}}], 
  main = paste({{ncyl}}, ""cylinders""))
```
```{r {{gear}}}
gear
```
</code></pre>

<p>Giving the error</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I think I am approaching the main problem ""How do I create a markdown document for each row of a dataframe?"" wrong with the knit-expand feature. </p>

<p>Can someone help me understand:
1. How to solve the main problem
2. Why the {{gear}} does not work within template.Rmd?</p>

<p>So, I still don't understand (2), but I think that @daroczig has gotten me close to understanding one way to solve the main problem. I don't think this is too unique of a problem, and I assume that there is a way to solve it without <code>brew</code> or <code>pander</code> or <code>rapport</code>.  In any case, I took the brew approach and do something with a few lines of a dataframe. It throws an error. Note I am not doing anything sensible with this code, just limiting the <code>mtcars</code> to 3 rows so I don't get too much output, and then creating another, lame, dataframe within the <code> for </code> loop. </p>

<pre><code># My report

&lt;%
mtcars1 &lt;- mtcars[1:3,]
mtcars1$type &lt;- c('red','blue','green')
t.levels &lt;- unique(mtcars1$type)
for (ty in t.levels) {
p &lt;- subset(mtcars1,type == ty) 
x &lt;- rep(p, 4)
short &lt;- paste0(p$gear, p$mpg)
%&gt;

### &lt;%= short %&gt; blah

&lt;%=
hist(x$mpg, main = paste(short, ""blah""))
%&gt;

&lt;% } %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is just a little lame modification of the solution proposed below by @daroczig. It works if we name it <code>demo.brew</code> and call it from <code> Pandoc.brew('demo.brew', output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')</code>. Making one silly example. </p>

<p>(3) Is there an example of how to do this without brew? I'm curious.  </p>

<p>Answer to (3) Yes. This works with a for loop that calls the variable instead of row num</p>

<pre><code>varlist &lt;- unique(df$variable)
for (var in varlist) {
    try(knit2html(input= '/Users/path/template.Rmd',
                  output=paste0('/Users/path/template',var,'.html'))) 
</code></pre>

<p>Works where the loop from 1:nrow() did not. </p>

The data layer is Mongo-powered, served through a RESTful API, and the client app will be coded in Ember.js. We want all data to be exchanged through the API, since we also have some mobile apps in the back burner that will hook to the same API.</p>

<p>I'm debating on whether write the API (using Express.js or other server-side MVC framework), or just serve the API use Deployd and not using a server-side framework at all, besides Deployd. I'll provide some hints about the project characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main feature is basically a dashboard that shows aggregated stats that are already computed and stored in the Mongo database. </li>
<li>User interaction is minimal, enough only to allow users to customize their dashboards, but users never upload data (other that customization preferences).</li>
<li>Most of the app is a lot of d3.js to create and render a bunch of graphs, which can customized in many ways.</li>
<li>It requires a very rich and responsive user interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>I proposed skipping completely the server-side framework, and simply go with a bunch of static HTML+CSS and do all the heavy lifting with a client-side MVC such as Ember.js. Since all data download and upload can be handled by Deployd, a pure static site would load much faster and is also easier to scale. Also, (I think) all user-related data and validation can be done with Deployd itself. </p>

<p>The thing is, some of my colleagues had a heart-stroke when I mentioned this idea. So I'd like a reality check: do I really need a server-side framework besides Deployd to cope with problems I cannot foresee yet? Are the benefits of having a pure static site a good enough tradeoff versus having, say, Express.js <em>just in case</em>? </p>

<p>I really don't need the bitmap to be rendered in 8bits per color channel. How can I change the code to have it rendered in grayscale or less bits per channel?</p>

<p>I would also be fine with a solution where the bitmap is rendered in a maximum resolution of x/y and then the resulting image is zoomed to the requested size. The PDF will be rendered in detail afterwards by a <code>CATiledLayer</code> anyway.</p>

<p>Also according to Apple's documentation, <code>CGBitmapContextCreate()</code> returns NIL if the context cannot be created (because of memory). But in MonoTouch there is only the constructor to create a context, hence I'm unable to check if creation failed or not.
If I was able to, I could just skip the pretender image.</p>

    oContext.SetFillColor(1f, 1f, 1f, 1f);

    // Calculate the rectangle to fit the page into. 
    RectangleF oCaptureRect = new RectangleF(0, 0, oTargetRect.Size.Width / fScaleToApply, oTargetRect.Size.Height / fScaleToApply);
    // GetDrawingTransform() doesn't scale up, that's why why let it calculate the transformation for a smaller area
    // if the current page is smaller than the area we have available (fScaleToApply &gt; 1). Afterwards we scale up again.
    CGAffineTransform oDrawingTransform = oPdfPage.GetDrawingTransform(CGPDFBox.Media, oCaptureRect, 0, true);

    // Now scale context up to final size.

<pre><code>var attachments = document.getElementById('files');

    file.append('file[]', attachments.files[i]);

console.log(file);
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('POST','php/upload.php', true);
request.setRequestHeader('cache-control', 'no-cache');
request.send(file);

<p>The HTML is like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="""" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data""&gt;
&lt;input type=""file"" id=""files"" name=""file[]"" multiple=""multiple""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

<pre><code>if (isset($_FILES['file'])&amp;&amp;!empty($_FILES['file'])){

}

Sounds simple enough right? I created the UserControl, let's call the Class My.Project.Controls.Tool, which I then tried to call to another View with the namespace <code>xmlns:Controls=""clr-namespace:My.Project.Controls;assembly=My.Project.GlobalUserControlDump""</code> and then set it in the view via  easily selected from the handy dandy intellisense.</p>

<p>This does as is expected, my UserControl appears on the separate view in the designer just fine. So I take the next normal step and build it....as soon as the build completes (which it does just fine with no errors reported as expected) the little bugger disappears! The xaml is still on the View of course, but it's disappeared from the designer AND it doesnt appear on the built solution?</p>

<p>Confused I go back, make a quick change to the UserControl and it appears back in the designer. Ok, I think it must be some fluke so I build it again....and again it disappears from the designer AND the built solution?</p>

<p>Now I can continue to reliably reproduce this scenario. Make a little change to the UserControl, it re-appears in the designer.....then build it and it disappears again!</p>

<p>Could someone pretty please shed some light on this quandry? Running in SL (both in and out of browser but built in browser) with Caliburn Micro. Any insight to this mystery is of course greatly appreciated, hoping another pair of eyes can catch my folly. Cheers!</p>

The constructor of my repository class creates the data context so that for the life of the page load, only one data context is used.</p>

<p>In my destructor of the repository class I explicitly call the dispose of the DataContext though I do not believe this is necessary.</p>

<p>Using performance monitor, if I watch my User Connections count and repeatedly load a page, the number increases once per page load. Connections do not get closed or reused (for about 20 minutes).</p>

<p>I tried putting Pooling=false in my config to see if this had any effect but it did not. In any case with pooling I wouldn't expect a new connection for every load, I would expect it to reuse connections.</p>

<p>I've tried putting a break point in the destructor to make sure the dispose is being hit and sure enough it is. So what's happening?</p>

<p>Some code to illustrate what I said above:</p>

<p>The controller:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyController : Controller
{
    protected MyRepository rep;

    public MyController ()
    {
        rep = new MyRepository();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The repository:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyRepository
{
    protected MyDataContext dc;

    public MyRepository()
    {
        dc = getDC();
    }

    ~MyRepository()
    {
        if (dc != null)
        {
            //if (dc.Connection.State != System.Data.ConnectionState.Closed)
            //{
            //    dc.Connection.Close();
            //}
            dc.Dispose();
        }
    }

    // etc
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I add a number of hints and context information to the DC for auditing purposes. This is essentially why I want one connection per page load</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
After having implemented IDisposable on my repository and on my controller class I couldn't find a way to specifically call the Dispose method on my controller as the controller is created and destroyed behind the scenes by the MvcHandler. However I did find that my connections were being closed anyway. I wasn't comfortable knowing that this was working but not knowing why so I did some digging and found an MSDN quote that made me happy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When execution is complete, the MvcHandler will check if the controller implements the IDisposable interface, and if so, will invoke Dispose on the controller to clean up unmanaged resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Final Update:</strong>
After a month or so with working this I've now removed all this code and gone down the MS advised route of wrapping a ""using"" statement around the code in my public repository methods and passing this DC into the private methods. This seems a little wasteful and repetitive as well as resulting in a few more connections being opened and closed. But I was getting linq to sql caching that I could only resolve by resetting the DC.  </p>

Thus, it is completely possible to store multiple dataframes under a single directory, similar to how one could keep multiple dataframes in a single Panel.</p>

<p>When should one use a Panel vs. nested directories in an HDF5?</p>

<p>I'm writing and reading many small tables/dataframes of the same size, generated with different set of parameters. I have been organizing them with Panels and Panel4Ds, then saving the whole Panel to a table in an HDF5 file. When reading back the data, I generally want to eventually use all of the dataframes, but at any one time I'm actually only using one of the dataframes. For my current purposes it seems none of this matters; the dataframes are small, so reading in the whole Panel is not troublesome. But if anyone else who doesn't use pandas tries to read the HDF5 file, they will have more trouble accessing and understanding the data. <em>What other factors should I be considering?</em></p>

So fot the model I have a validation rule that states:</p>

<pre><code>RuleFor(x =&gt; x.Email).EmailAddress().WithMessage(localizationService.GetResource(""Common.WrongEmail""));
</code></pre>

<p>The problem now is that I have a demand that states that based on a setting we want to restirct this to a email with specific domain.</p>

<p>I did this simply by doing a regex validation</p>

<pre><code>RuleFor(x =&gt; x.Email).Matches(customerSettings.RestrictLoginPattern).WithMessage(localizationService.GetResource(""Customer.Fields.Email.EnteredPasswordWrongFormat""));
</code></pre>

<p>So if the email does not match a regex then a errormessage is displayed. So far so good.</p>

<p>The second specification is that the user should be able to not submit the domain. So for <em>user.name@test.com</em> the user should be able to write just <em>user.name</em></p>

<p>I did this by doing a get/set for the email property</p>

<pre><code>    public string Email { 
        set
        {
            _email = value;
        }

        get
        {
            if (_email == null)
                return null;

            if(!_email.EndsWith(LoginSuffix))
            {

            }
            return _email;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>So if i write something that does not ends with <em>test.com</em> it's added.
The problem now is that this does not happend on the client-side so the validation displays an error that the email is not well formated.</p>

<p>I tried to remove the get feature from Email and added a property FormatedEmail that I did validate. Since FormatedEmail is not on form clientside works fine, but when it not validates I can't get the error to <em>hook</em> to email field, just as a summary error</p>

<p>I see multiple solution </p>

<p>I can disable the clientside validation for just that field. But based on searches I find that that's probably not possible?</p>

<p>I can write a custom clientside validation, but that feels like quite complex for such a ""small"" matter.</p>

<p>There is a way to bind an error to a field somehow?</p>

<p>These are essentially images that I would like to loop through on a .each statement and get the url. I frankly don't know what all that Proto stuff is? But I'm not really interested in outputting any of it.</p>

<p>This is what I'm doing:</p>

<pre><code>$(data.images).each(function(index, value) {

console.log(this.url); // This is what is outputting the array you see above 

});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm getting the URL but I'm also getting ""undefined"" which is breaking the image if I try to do this in the .each loop...</p>

<pre><code>$(data.images).each(function(index, value) {
$('#myContainer').append(""&lt;img src='"" + this.url + ""'&gt;"");
});

<p>Thanks in advance for suggestions and help.</p>

<p>EDIT - I was asked to post the entire string. If I console.log(data) this is what I get. It's a huge array of... well, stuff. I did not expand open every object but I believe this will give you an idea of the structure of the entire object. Before I was trying to pair it down to just where I was having trouble but if you believe the entire string will help, here it is.</p>

<p>Apologies if it wasn't totally clear before, I really do appreciate the assistance here. I've been banging my head on this one for about 2 days on and off.</p>

<p>One more edit...
One answer on here did click into something I didn't consider with the absence of a return on a function. To expand further on how I'm pulling on this data is using functions because I'm checking first that the product I'm referencing is legit. This is Shopatron API FWIW, the documentation has been, lacking, would be a nice way to put it... so anyway you'll see reference to that at the top of script like so:</p>

<pre><code>var partNumber = '&lt;?php echo $productID; ?&gt;';
    $(document).ready(function() {
        Shopatron.getProduct({
            partNumber: partNumber
        },{
            success: function(p) {
                outputProductName(p);
                outputProductImage(p);
                outputProductAdditionalImages(p);
                outputProductPrice(p);
                outputDescription(p);
                outputSpecs(p);
            },
            templateFriendly : false                                
        }
    );
</code></pre>

<p>Now my function down below follows:</p>

<pre><code>function outputProductAdditionalImages(data) {
    $('#myContainer').append(""&lt;img src='"" + this.url + ""'&gt;"");
});

I know this has been asked, but the previous solutions don't seem to apply to my situation.</p>

<p>I have a simple table with a number of records in each row, with the final column being a delete hyperlink. I'm trying to use the dialog to pop up and confirm delete. This works perfectly if I use explicit names of the div where the dialog is (I position it exactly one div above the div where the table is). I use a destroy first which seems to solve the ""only opens once"" problem, as long as as I name the dialog div. I'm trying to universalize the code, so I'd rather get away from explicitly naming the div where the dialog will live, but rather refer to the prev div. This works the first time, but subsequent clicks do not:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;
   $("".deleteLinkDiag a"").livequery('click',function() {

	var myParent = $(this).parents(""div:eq(0)""); //container div to be replaced
	var myDiag   = $(myParent).prev(""div""); 	//one div before container div
	var urlLoad = $(this).attr(""href"");
	$(myDiag).dialog('destroy');
    $(myDiag).dialog({ 
        	bgiframe: true,
			resizable: false,
			height:140,
			modal: true,
			autoOpen: false,
			overlay: {
				backgroundColor: '#000',

<p>Then I notice that the underscore ""_"" sorts before the capital letter ""A"". This was in contrast to a third party package that was sorting the same text and sorted _ after A.</p>

<p>According to the ANSI character set, A-Z are characters 65 - 90 and _ is 95. So it looks like the 3rd party package is using that order and TStringList.Sort isn't.</p>

<p>I drilled down into guts of TStringList.Sort and it is sorting using AnsiCompareStr (Case Sensitive) or AnsiCompareText (Case Insensitive).  I tried it both ways, setting my StringList's CaseSensitive value to true and then false. But in both cases, the ""_"" sorts first.</p>

<p>I just can't imagine that this is a bug in TStringList. So there must be something else here that I am not seeing. What might that be?</p>

<p>What I really need to know is how can I get my TStringList to sort so that it is in the same order as the other package.</p>

<p>For reference, I am using Delphi 2009 and I'm using Unicode strings in my program.</p>

<hr>

<p>So the final answer here is to override the Ansi compares with whatever you want (e.g. non-ansi compares) as follows:</p>

<pre><code>type
  TMyStringList = class(TStringList)
  protected
    function CompareStrings(const S1, S2: string): Integer; override;
  end;

function TMyStringList.CompareStrings(const S1, S2: string): Integer;
begin
  if CaseSensitive then
    Result := CompareStr(S1, S2)
  else
    Result := CompareText(S1, S2);
end;

<p>I find that when I write CSS, I deliberately make my selectors more specific than necessary to avoid conflicts and for quasi-documentation.</p>

<p>It would be great if there were a tool that could analyze a given group of rules, determine their ""uniqueness"" in terms of overlap with other rules, and then strip away any unnecessary specificity.</p>

<p>I can't even begin to imagine how a tool developer would approach all of the scenarios this would require, but I've been blown away by others' ingenuities in this area before and figured it was worth asking.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I've added a bounty to this question, and the more I think about it, the more I realize how valuable a <strong>CSS Specificity Filter</strong> would be.</p>

<p>For example, when working with Nested Rules/Selectors in <a href=""http://sass-lang.com/#nesting"">Sass</a> and <a href=""http://lesscss.org/#-nested-rules"">LESS</a>, <strong>excessive nesting</strong> is a <a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3003-css-taking-control-of-the-cascade"">common</a> and <a href=""http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule"">well-known</a> antipattern that can easily lead to overly specific selectors.</p>

<p>There's a good illustration of this in the excellent TutsPlus course <a href=""https://tutsplus.com/course/maintainable-css-with-sass/"">Maintainable CSS with Sass and Compass</a>:</p>

<pre><code>body {
    div.container {
        p {
            a {
                color: purple;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sass will follow these nesting instructions and produce the following CSS output, raising no objection to any unneeded specificity:</p>

<pre><code>body div.container p a {
    color: purple;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If a Specificity Filter did/does exist, however, it would create potential benefits for CSS developers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You could organize your stylesheets as a 1:1 mapping of the DOM, similar to what you see when you examine style rules in Firebug and Chrome Dev Tools. A smart editor/IDE could auto-populate styles for DOM elements with shared styles/classes. That redundancy would then, of course, be filtered out by the Specificity Filter/Optimizer.</p></li>
<li><p>Stylesheets could have their structure pre-populated by a tool that scans the DOM and translates it to CSS selectors/rules. This means a developer would only need to update the HTML; the CSS ""tree"" would be kept in sync to reflect the current state of the DOM. A smart editor would let you jump to the CSS definition for an element/class for styling -- or even make its style rules visible in a separate panel.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In a way, this almost seems like a step backward - like a feature you'd find in Dreamweaver or WebAssist to help newbs learn CSS. But the basic idea of a CSS selector optimization tool seems like a no brainer, and the type of workflow automation I've described would be the logical next step -- and the catalyst would be the Specificity Filter.</p>

<p>I looked into some of the better-known CSS editors and web IDEs, but haven't found anything offering this type of functionality beyond targeting a single element and generating a selector for it.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2: CSS Selector Performance</strong></p>

<p>In response to Spliff's comment, here are two great articles on CSS selector performance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/03/10/performance-impact-of-css-selectors/"">Performance Impact of CSS Selectors</a> by Steve Souders</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://css-tricks.com/efficiently-rendering-css/"">Efficiently Rendering CSS</a> by Chris Coyier</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both agree that micro-optimizing CSS isn't worth the effort, but that over-qualified descendant selectors are ""an efficiency disaster."" I haven't benchmarked yet myself, but suspect that the kind of ""DOM Mapping"" approach I'm suggesting would cause a performance hit without an optimization step, either manual or automated.</p>

I'm connecting to an API which supplies me with a auth-token, if sometime time during the calls i get a INVALID_AUTH i need to re-authenticate. 
So for the naive implementation i did this</p>

<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"")
@Override
public Observable&lt;User&gt; getUsers() {
    return runCommandAndrefreshAuthIfNecessary(new RequestCommand() {
        @Override
        public Observable create() {
            return createService(UsersApi.class).getUsers();
        }
    });
}
private Observable runCommandAndrefreshAuthIfNecessary(final RequestCommand command) {
    return command.create()
          .onErrorResumeNext(new Func1&lt;Throwable, Observable&lt;?&gt;&gt;() {
        @Override
        public Observable&lt;?&gt; call(Throwable throwable) {
            return handleRefreshToken(command);
        }
    });
}
private Observable&lt;?&gt; handleRefreshToken(final RequestCommand command) {
    return refreshToken().flatMap(new Func1&lt;Boolean, Observable&lt;?&gt;&gt;() {
        @Override
        public Observable&lt;?&gt; call(Boolean aBoolean) {
            return command.create();
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see i'm just wrapping the retrofit command, if i get an error i run refreshToken(), the token refreshes and i run the retrofit command again, so finally the Observable is passed back to the subscriber. Works as expected.
The thing i'm struggling with, is what happens i a multiple calls are made, for example, i'm calling getUsers and getFlags one after another. both of them get the INVALID_AUTH, currently both of the fire refreshToken(), which is bad.
i'm looking for a rx-java way to manage the calls, meaning after the first call of getUsers fires refreshToken, any call after that needs to wait for the refreshToken to end, only then fire the retrofit command.</p>

<p>Any suggestion will be appreciated.</p>

<p>I can write an equivalent statement directly in SQL and it runs much faster.  Can someone tell me if there is a more efficient way to write the linq query?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thanks for all the replies so far here is some more information. The generated sql from the above linq query comes out like so:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
[Extent1].[ID] AS [ID], 
[Extent1].[Active] AS [Active], 
[Extent1].[IsCategory] AS [IsCategory], 
[Extent1].[Name] AS [Name], 
[Extent7].[Value1] AS [Value1], 
[Extent2].[Value1] AS [Value11], 
[Extent7].[PicklistCode] + N'-' + [Extent8].[PicklistCode] AS [C1]
FROM    [dbo].[ProductItem] AS [Extent1]
INNER JOIN [dbo].[PicklistDetails] AS [Extent2] ON  EXISTS (SELECT 
    1 AS [C1]
    FROM      ( SELECT 1 AS X ) AS [SingleRowTable1]
    LEFT OUTER JOIN  (SELECT 
        [Extent3].[ID] AS [ID], 
        [Extent3].[PicklistCode] AS [PicklistCode]
        FROM [dbo].[PicklistDetails] AS [Extent3]
        WHERE [Extent1].[DiameterID] = [Extent3].[ID] ) AS [Project1] ON 1 = 1
    LEFT OUTER JOIN  (SELECT 
        [Extent4].[ID] AS [ID], 
        [Extent4].[PicklistCode] AS [PicklistCode]
        FROM [dbo].[PicklistDetails] AS [Extent4]
        WHERE [Extent1].[ScheduleID] = [Extent4].[ID] ) AS [Project2] ON 1 = 1
    LEFT OUTER JOIN  (SELECT 
        [Extent5].[ID] AS [ID], 
        [Extent5].[PicklistCode] AS [PicklistCode]
        FROM [dbo].[PicklistDetails] AS [Extent5]
        WHERE [Extent1].[DiameterID] = [Extent5].[ID] ) AS [Project3] ON 1 = 1
    LEFT OUTER JOIN  (SELECT 
        [Extent6].[ID] AS [ID], 
        [Extent6].[PicklistCode] AS [PicklistCode]
        FROM [dbo].[PicklistDetails] AS [Extent6]
        WHERE [Extent1].[ScheduleID] = [Extent6].[ID] ) AS [Project4] ON 1 = 1
    WHERE (([Project1].[PicklistCode] + N'-' + [Project2].[PicklistCode]) = [Extent2].[PicklistCode]) OR (([Project3].[PicklistCode] + N'-' + [Project4].[PicklistCode] IS NULL) AND ([Extent2].[PicklistCode] IS NULL))
)
LEFT OUTER JOIN [dbo].[PicklistDetails] AS [Extent7] ON [Extent1].[DiameterID] = [Extent7].[ID]
LEFT OUTER JOIN [dbo].[PicklistDetails] AS [Extent8] ON [Extent1].[ScheduleID] = [Extent8].[ID]
WHERE [Extent1].[Active] = 1
</code></pre>

<p>I can get the same result in sql much faster using this query:</p>

<pre><code>select pi.Active, pi.id, pi.IsCategory, pi.Name, diameter.Value1 as diameter, nt.Value1 as thickness, diameter.PicklistCode + '-' + schedule.PicklistCode as thicknesscode
from ProductItem pi
    inner join PicklistDetails diameter on diameter.id = pi.DiameterID
    inner join PicklistDetails schedule on schedule.id = pi.ScheduleID
    inner join PicklistDetails nt on nt.PicklistCode = diameter.PicklistCode + '-' + schedule.PicklistCode
where pi.Active = 1
</code></pre>

<p>I am aware that I can run this sql query directly but I would like to see if I can get the linq query to run faster.  As I mentioned the linq query runs for about 3 secs and the sql query runs with sub 1 sec times.</p>

<p>I checked the execution plan and the two major items are as follows
41% Sort ([ProductItem].DiameterID Ascending, [ProductItem].ScheduleID Ascending, [PicklistDetails].PicklistCode Ascending)
49% Row Count Spool (Lazy Spool) I'm not entirely sure what this one is.</p>

<p>The goal of this script is to run 5 tests on one string, detecting the string length of each string, while giving the string a parameter (Minimum characters to input, and max)
string in question is <strong>str[]</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define SIZE 11
#define MIN_SIZE 5

void String_Insert_Recursion(char str[]);

{
   char str[SIZE];
   int i, str_lenght;

   printf(""Enter a string of %i to %i characters:\n"", MIN_SIZE, SIZE-1);
   for (i=0; i&lt;5 ; i++)
   {
      String_Insert_Recursion(str);  
      str_lenght = strlen(str);
      printf(""This string is %i long\n"", str_lenght-1);
   }


   system(""PAUSE"");

{
   int i=0;
   while ((str[i] = getchar()) != '\n')
      i++;

   if (i&gt;SIZE-1 || i&lt;MIN_SIZE)
      {
      //SIZE-1 so that there's still ONE spot on the string for a null value.
      printf(""Incorrect number of characters. Please Reenter\n"");
      String_Insert_Recursion(str);
      }

   str[i+1]='\0';
   //This sets the null value at the end of the string
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works 100% fine, <strong>if</strong> you don't go over the Max or Min setup. The program will stop you and ask you to re-input your string if you do (As it should) but there's <strong>something</strong> that carries over. </p>

<ul>
<li>For example, if you write ""<strong>End</strong>"" as the string, it will ask you to
re-put that since it's only 3 characters.  </li>
<li>If you write your next character as ""<strong>The End</strong>"" it will give you 3 characters (Which is
incorrect, it should be 7 characters; Space included.)</li>
<li>Writing ""<strong>The End</strong>"" again will give you the correct number of characters now. </li>
<li>Tested to see if it's really reading the previous ""<strong>The End</strong>"" that you wrote, but it's not. So I have to assume the problem's going to be in some logic loop oversight on the recursion. </li>
</ul>

<p>It feels like the program is mucking up at the <strong>if statement</strong> in the recursion (That's as far as I could narrow down the problem), I can't understand for the life in me why @__@ So far, I've tried clearing the string out using </p>

<pre><code>str[0]='\0';
</code></pre>

<p>And planking that practically everywhere, to no avail however :(
Would really appreciate help! It's interesting to learn, but frustrating when you don't have any way to get a clue on what's really going wrong.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: 
Moved <code>str[i+1]='\0';</code> under the <code>i++;</code> which will set a null value ahead of the string for every attempt. Turns out the problem was that it would set a null value to both working and unworking strings since it was placed in a bad spot. Thank you to <strong>Dave</strong> for this!</p>

<p>If you've got some interesting insight or another answer to add, I will definitely read it however! :)</p>

<p>After some research, I added the following line to my php.ini(under the extensions part)</p>

<p>extension=openssl.so</p>

<p>However When I reestart my Apache server I get this Warning:</p>

<p>[15-Jul-2009 16:30:39] PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20050922/openssl.so' - (null) in Unknown on line 0</p>

<p>I checked and in fact there is no openssl.so in that folder, am I missing something?. Do I need to recompile php for it to show?. How can i accomplish that?.
Any help will be greatly aprecciated.</p>

I recently chose the sounds from freesound.org and placed them by employing <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/SoundPool.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SoundPool</a> class. Everything was fine. But now I see that my game freezes on Samsung Galaxy S2 (SGS2).</p>

<p>By looking at <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17623"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, I found out that SGS2 has a problem with SoundPool.</p>

<p>As far as I read in the blogs, Android update 2.3.5 fixed this freeze. But there are numerous SGS2 under V2.3.5. For example, my SGS2 cell phone has 2.3.3 version.</p>

<p>I found only solution is <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/opensl-soundpool/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/opensl-soundpool/</a> which offers an OpenSL ES method. But it is a bit complicated for me.</p>

<p>What's interesting is that I haven't had almost any difficulty when I play game from Google Play with my old version (2.3.3) SGS2. Can it be posssible that almost all the game developers use OpenSL ES instead of SoundPool?</p>

<p>Is there any other simpler solution?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span id=""_userExists"" runat=""server"" visible=""false"" class=""invalid""&gt;

<p>This is in the markup and the required class is applied after validation takes place. I am not really sure how this affects the jquery animation due to it running server side and the made visible upon a validation error.</p>

<p>Jquery:</p>

<pre><code>$(""input[type=submit]"").live('click', function(){
 console.log('clicked');
 $('html, body').animate({
   scrollTop: $('.required').first().offset().top
 }, 600);
});

<p>I am testing a client-side javascript library. Unit tests work great with Karma, Mocha, and Grunt. The unit-tests can be run locally, or via SauceLabs. The unit tests are able to test basically everything up to the part where a file is actually submitted. This part requires browser automation, and/or manual interaction, and this is what I'm struggling with.</p>

<p>The library in question is a Javascript file-upload library. It has features like chunking, auto-resuming, and much more. It does not require jQuery, and it works on a variety of browsers (IE7-10, FF, Safari (Mac &amp; iOS), Chrome, Android stock browser). So, there are a lot of cases and exceptions to be covered in these tests.</p>

<p>Basically, I need to use Selenium to set up the page. Since I'm testing a client-side JS file-upload library I need to use Selenium to programmatically submit a file so it can actually be uploaded. Once this file has been submitted (the equivalent of selecting a file from the dialog window that appears when you try to upload a file or files online) <em>then</em> client-side tests can be run to ensure the UI has been drawn properly, the file has been found, etc.</p>

<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around how I can test this properly, and how I can set up my test suite to be extensible for the future, robust, and simple/easy to use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should I inject JS code to be run client-side with Selenium?</p>

<p>One idea is to inject the client-side JS code at opportune times with Selenium. Here's some pseudo-code of what I'm thinking:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>describe(""A Test"", function () {

   it(""injects some JS"", function (done) {
        // Assume `getClientSideScript` loads some .js file from the filesystem,
        // reads its contents, and returns the contents as a string (to be executed).
        browser.safeExecute(getClientSideScript('initialize'), function (err, result) {
            // At this point, the client-side library is initialized on the page.

            // Assume that `uploadFile` will submit a file to the `&lt;input type='file'&gt;`
            // element
            utils.uploadFile('file.jpg', function (file) {

                browser.safeExecute(getClientSideScript('test_file_submission'), function (err, result) {
                    assert.ok(/* something about the result */);
                });

            });

        }); 
   });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This, to me, would work, but seems like a giant PITA. I would have to come up with some convention for storing and loading the client-side scripts that are loaded. Also, two different test would have two different injected scripts so we'd have a huge collection of one-time-use scripts chillin' out in our repo. I'm also afraid of going down this road and finding out that it is a bad decision or impossible. </p>

<p>Anyone have any experience with this?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mock server...I'm going to need one.</p>

<p>I could use <a href=""http://sinonjs.org/docs/#fakeServer"">Sinon.js</a> to make mock servers client-side, or <a href=""https://github.com/flatiron/nock"">nock</a> to have a separate server-side mock server. The server is <strong>super</strong> simple, but I believe I need to able to assert client-side that the response from the server was what was expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Intercepting client-side test results</p>

<p>Similar to the above, how would I be able to intercept <code>asserts</code> within the client-side code when using Selenium to automate the browser. For example, let's say I wanted to test a request-response cycle between my library and a mock server and I wanted to verify that if my library sends request A to the server it will expect response A. Selenium can't test that. I need to be able to have <code>asserts</code> captured client-side and outputted through Selenium.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Been bangin' my head on the wall trying to figure out the best method to do this. If anyone has any experience with anything similar, please, chime in!</p>

I have been simply adding in the text content as it appears (capitalized), but the other designer on the project insists on using lower case text in his HTML and capitalizing it with an applied style:</p>

<pre><code>.tedious {text-transform:uppercase;}
</code></pre>

<p>I understand the argument of separation of style from content, but in this case it really doesn't matter because I personally will not maintain the site, nor do I ever imagine that the client will need to un-capitalize all of this text. The question is: 1. will search engines pay any attention at all to capitalization of text in a document and 2. would a crawler go so far as to read my style sheet and look for such things (me thinks not). I know that BOLD, STRONG, EM, etc have a (diminishing) effect on SEO so I can imagine a scenario where CAPS would, but have never heard of anyone actually claiming, let alone confirming this.</p>

<p>Now, i want to take the user to another page, eg. the home page, after submitting a block-administration form. There are several ways to achieve this, but drupal recommends using the hook_alter_form method as described <a href=""http://drupal.org/node/134000"">here</a></p>

<p>I've written a .module file called 'formdest' containing the following:</p>

<pre><code>function formdest_form_alter(&amp;$form, $form_state, $form_id) {
switch ($form_id) {
case 'block-admin-configure':
    $form_state['redirect'] = '/home';
  break;
}
}

<p>and the .info file to accompany it:</p>

<pre><code>; $Id: custom.info,v 1.0 2011/01/01 21:55:00 author Exp $
name = formdest
description = form destination
package = Other
core = 6.x

version = ""6.x""
project = ""custom""
datestamp = ""1229018427""
</code></pre>

<p>My custom module shows up in the module list and I can enable it, thus activiting the redirect. But when I test it, drupal still takes me to the block admin page instead of to the homepage..</p>

<p>There are no error messages in neither firebug or system log, so I'm a bit clueless. Any of you coding gods has any ideas?</p>

<p>I am trying to develop a website that will be used for our lockout/tagout database at work. It will eventually have the ability to automatically generate reports/tags, but I have not gotten that far as of yet. What I would like to be able to do, is provide two dropdownlists, one for the complex, and another for machines (these will be used to sort the given devices). When the user selects a specific complex, I would like the machine dropdownlist to be limited to the machines specific to that complex. For example, my SQL query would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM machine WHERE complex_id = complex.complex_id ORDER BY machine_name;
</code></pre>

<p>In order to compare machine.complex_id and complex.complex_id, I figured that the use of a parameter was the correct approach to take.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM machine WHERE complex_id = @compid ORDER BY machine_name;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I am getting hung up with the use of parameters in the SQL statements. Having looked over the following page: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z72eefad.ASPx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a>, I was able to figure out how one would use a parameter in an SQL statement. However, it was not clear to me as to how one would actually create the parameter. Even after much googling, I haven't found anything that really stood out as the correct approach for what it is I am trying to accomplish.</p>

hence, i wrote two basic examples to extract prime numbers from a list of random numbers.</p>

<p>Example 1: Using multiprocessing</p>

<pre><code>from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
from random import randrange
import time

def randomList(q, size, nmax):
    l = []
    r = randrange(2, nmax)
    for i in range(size):
        while r in l: # avoid replicating numbers
            r = randrange(2, nmax)
        l.append(r)
        q.put(r)

def checkPrime(numbers, prime):
    if numbers.qsize():
        n = numbers.get()
        count = 0 # divisors counter
        d = 2 # divisor
        while not count and d&lt;=n/2:
            if n%d:
                d+=1
            else:
                count+=1
        if not count:
            prime.put(n)

if __name__==""__main__"":
    numbers = Queue()
    prime = Queue()
    randomList(numbers, 50, 1000) # 50 number | 100 max value
    t1 = time.time()
    while numbers.qsize():
        for i in range(10): # Running 10 processes 
            p=Process(target=checkPrime, args=(numbers, prime))
            p.start()
            p.join()
    t2 = time.time()
    primes = []
    for i in range(prime.qsize()):
        primes.append(prime.get())
    print(""[+] Prime numbers:"")
    print(primes)
    print(""[+] Time elapsed:""+str(t2-t1))
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>[+] Prime numbers:
[17, 227, 389, 593, 953, 757]
[+] Time elapsed:9.41699981689
</code></pre>

<p>Exemple 2: the same example 1 but without multiprocessing</p>

<pre><code>[...]
    while numbers.qsize():
        checkPrime(numbers, prime)
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>[+] Prime numbers:

[+] Time elapsed:0.00999999046326

<p>So, multiprocessing makes this program (specifically maybe) hugely slower than without using it.
Any explanation? am I using it the wrong way?</p>

Please see the end of this question for a definition of ""function try block"".</p>

<p><strong>Question: If a function try block does not ""handle"" the exception raised in the constructor, why do we need them after all? Could you give an example taking advantage of function try block?</strong></p>

<p>Considering the following code.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;new&gt;  
#include &lt;exception&gt;
using namespace std;

struct X {
  int *p;
  X() try : p(new int[10000000000]) {}
  catch (bad_alloc &amp;e) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; ""exception caught in the constructor: "" &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};

int main() {
  try {
    X x;
  }
  catch (exception &amp;e){
    cerr &lt;&lt; ""exception caught outside the constructor: "" &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output is</p>

<p><code>exception caught in the constructor: std::bad_alloc
exception caught outside the constructor: std::bad_alloc</code></p>

<p>It seems to me that, no matter what I do in the function try block, the exception is always going to be thrown to the outer scope which calls the constructor, e.g. the <code>X x;</code> in the above code.</p>

<p>Definition of ""function try block"", excerpted from ""C++ Primer 5th.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To handle an exception from a constructor initializer, we must write the constructor as a function try block. A function try block lets us associate a group of catch clauses with the initialization phase of a constructor (or the destruction phase of a destructor) as well as with the constructor’s (or destructor’s) function body.</p>

<p>I attach old post here which i try but still same problem I have.</p>

<p>I think I've got a better solution that doesn't involve closing the window first. The issue is that IE won't override a window (PDF or otherwise) if you attempt to open it again with an empty URL (i.e., ''). It will override a PDF with a non-empty URL, however. That could be a file, but about:blank works even better (which is what an empty URL does normally).</p>

<p>Depending on how your code is written, you may still want the try/catch, but this should eliminate the need:</p>

<pre><code>windowHandle = window.open('about:blank',name,attributes);
windowHandle.document.location.href = url;
windowHandle.focus();
</code></pre>

<p>about:blank will force the PDF out of the child window and allow you to do what you need to do. It might not be a bad idea to place the setting of the URL and focus() in a windowHandle.onload() handler, so there aren't any timing issues with disposing of the PDF. I.e.:</p>

<pre><code>windowHandle.onload=function(){
    windowHandle.document.location.href = url;
    windowHandle.focus();
};
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>My main problem is calling windowHandle.focus(); which generate error with pdf.</p>

<pre><code>nav nav-tabs ult_tablinks

<p>There is an issue of the main bullet styles that are in my custom css file which is:
Code:</p>

.archive-page ul li,.entry-content ul li{list-style:squareoutsidenone;color:#421C52;}
/* Bullets End */
</code></pre>

<p>I like the way this setting styles the bullets throughout the site. Although, it is a problem in some areas like the styling in shortcode such as the tabs above because it is placing the bullets inside the tabbed menu.
The nav nav-tabs ult tablinks is inheriting the code below:
Code:</p>

<pre><code>.archive-page ul li, .entry-content ul li {
list-style: square outside none;}
li {line-height: 20px;}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway that I can still use the general bullet styling and just eliminate them from this shortcode area?</p>

<p>Here is the link to beta site where you can see what I am talking about. I would like the tabs to not reference a list-style.</p>

<p>I am able to remove the bullets by deleting the <strong>/* Bullets */</strong> css above but then I don't have the nice bullet style throughout the site.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how I could fix this or better yet a solution would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>How can I edit to ensure that the images are a maximum height of let's say 400px and width is in proportion? I can't simply upload the images in lower dimensions as they are user uploaded images, so I need to do this script/server side.</p>

Is there a simple way for me to exclude a specific ID or class from the jQuery targeting that I can then add to the print link to avoid this conflict?  Or should i be adjusting the jQuery targeting to look for an <a href=""http://www.domainname.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domainname.com</a> at the start of links to avoid treating anything else as an external link?</p>

<pre><code>class BlogPost(models.Model):  # This class doesn't really matter
    author = models.ForeignKey(myUser)
    text = models.TextField()
</code></pre>

<p>It happens that I log visits on each blog post using another model:</p>

<pre><code>class Activity(models.Model):
    user_id = models.CharField()
    # I log different types of activities, hence the choice
    action_id = models.IntegerField(choices=ACTIVITY_ACTIONS)
    object_id = models.CharField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField()
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is to get the most visitied blog posts since a precise date, ordered by their number of views. What I'm doing right now (in the activity manager):</p>

<pre><code>def get_blogposts_most_viewed_since(self, date):
    # I get all related activities (blog posts views since date)
    activities = Activity.objects.since(date).filter(action_id=BLOGPOST_VIEW)

    # I get all blogposts' ids
    blogpost_ids = events.values('object_id')

    # I get all blogposts ordered by their number of views:
    blogposts = BlogPost.objects.filter(id__in=blogpost_ids)\
                 .annotate(nb_views=Count('id')).order_by('-nb_views')
    return blogposts
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work. I made some tests: I create three blog posts, blogpost_a is viewed twice, blogpost_b is viewed once and blogpost_c doesn't get any views. When I call the <code>get_blogposts_most_viewed_since</code> I do get blogpost_a and blogpost_b but in what seems to be a random_order.</p>

<p>I tried to do some debugging with:</p>

<pre><code>for blogpost in blogposts:
    print blogpost.nb_views
</code></pre>

<p>Both blogposts (a and b) have <code>nb_views == 1</code>.</p>

    public static function log($message)
    {
        @error_log($message, 0);
    }

}

<p>I have db with a single table Customer, I run sqlmetal and it generates an ORM class for me.</p>

<p>I'd like to apply certain rules in the constructor of Customer, maybe something like the 
firstName, lastName members of Customer have to be supplied. </p>

<p>I created a new constructor in the sqlmetal generated Customer class to
take 2 parameters firstName, secondName and then marked the default parameterless
constructor as internal as I don't want to expose that to whatever consumes this
assembly.</p>

<p>My code began to complain when I tried  to SubmitChanges() because of the new protection level of the parameterless constructor from public to internal.</p>

customerList = dbInstance.Customer.ToList();
Customer customerToDelete = customerList.Where(c =&gt; c.Customer_id == 100).First();

dbInstance.SubmitChanges(); &lt;-- error thrown

I want to show the progress of various inserts/updates made on a database, using a <code>&lt;h:inputTextArea value=""bean.status"" disabled=""true""/&gt;</code> in my view (using richfaces). The <code>Bean</code> is a backing bean with a <code>status</code> attribute and a method to add status messages it:</p>

<pre><code>public void addMessage(String message) {
    status = status.concat(message + ""\n"");
}

<p>There is a ""migrate"" button that starts the process. My problem is that the text area is update only at the end of the migrator method. What I need is that everytime the <code>status</code> is updated, the input text area gets updated too. So...</p>

<p>1 - How to do it?</p>

<p>2 - Is there a better way to implement this?</p>

<hr>

<p>According to the RichFaces Component References it's needed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Setup Push</p></li>
<li><p>Use a server-side or client-side approach</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a message producer</p></li>
<li><p>Handle push messages</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I did:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Install runtime dependencies (Atmosphere):
-- Added atmosphere-runtime-1.0.0.beta4 dependency with Maven</p></li>
<li><p>Registering Push Servlet
-- Not needed for Servlet 3.0, but added the manual configuration in web.xml:</p>

<p>
    Push Servlet
    org.richfaces.webapp.PushServlet
    1
    true
</p></li>
<li><p>Chose server-side approach with Push CDI Event mechanism to fire messages. Updated my Status.java to be a message producer:</p>

<p>import java.io.Serializable;
import javax.enterprise.context.SessionScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Event;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;
import org.richfaces.cdi.push.Push;</p>

<p>@Named
@SessionScoped
public class Status implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>@Inject
@Push(topic = ""statusPush"")
Event&lt;String&gt; pushEvent;
private String status;

public void addMessage(String message) {
    //Everytime the status is updated...
    status = status.concat(message + ""\n"");
    //... the message is sent to the topic
    sendMessage(message);
}

public void sendMessage(String message) {
    pushEvent.fire(message);
}


public String getStatus() {
    return status;
}

public void setStatus(String status) {
    this.status = status;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p></li>
<li><p>Handling messages on the view:</p>

<p></p>

<pre><code>&lt;a4j:push address=""statusPush""
    onerror=""alert(event.rf.data)""&gt;
    &lt;a4j:ajax event=""dataavailable"" render=""statusOutput"" /&gt;
&lt;/a4j:push&gt;


&lt;h:inputTextarea id=""statusOutput"" value=""#{status.status}"" cols=""80"" rows=""20"" disabled=""true""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Seems that it's all set but when I click the button that starts the migration process, I get the following stacktrace:</p>

When I try to print out the length of the StringWriter (<code>StringWriter.toString().length()</code>) it turns out to be 500, but as far as I can see the XML-content is longer than that. Is the StringWriter limited to a length of 500?

The phone is in the hand in a fixed orientation which does not change. For Example, I am holding the phone in my stretched hand and as it moves to the right or left, my music volume changes dynamically; If I move up and down the speed of playing changes and moving at some intermediate angle changes both speed and volume accordingly. I charted the accelerometer data while doing these motions and there seems to be some pattern but I am not sure how to filter those. I have looked at a lot of posts - High Pass/Low Pass filters, Kalman Filters, Gesture Recognizers but it is difficult to understand what is the appropriate method. Most of the posts don't seem to detect dynamically - but only when a certain gesture is finished. I only need to use accelerometer and not gyroscope and any other sensor.

<p>There are lots of different ways of comparing dates and times in java/android.  There is the <code>Time</code> class, <code>Date</code> class and <code>Calendar</code> class.  There's even a <code>compareTo</code> method and a method to check if a date is before or after the other, but I can't find a solution to my problem.</p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p>If I have a Time1, 12:30, and Time2 , 12:10, and I want to check if they are withing 15 minutes of each other. I can compare the difference of the difference of the minutes. 30 - 10 = 20.  20 is clearly not less than 15.  </p>

<p>However, is Time1 was 12:56 and Time2 was 13:02, this method wouldn't work.  2 - 56 = -54, but the actual difference is 6.  One solution is that if you know which time is later, check if the later minute is less greater than the earlier minute. If it isn't, then add 60 to the earlier minute.</p>

<p>Is this a good method of comparing?  This will add lots of complexity to my code, especially as I need to check the hours and date as well. Is there a simpler solution or api that is available?</p>

"31367166","1","31367499","","2015-07-12 11:14:35","","-4","45","<p>I am extending on an existing library that has an abstract class (let’s call it ‘A’) with an abstract method (let’s call it ‘A.a()’) that returns an instance of another class (‘B’). <strong>I seek to have information on which instances of B ‘belong’ (were created by) which instances of A.</strong> The way that I was thinking about doing this was to use the returned instance of B from A.a() as a class variable for A. The problem is that, in the library, A has already been implemented over fifty times and is called many more times than this.</p>

<p>Some further background on the library, the classes A and B are part of a larger recursive pattern where an instance of A contains children (other instances of A) developing a hierarchy. <strong>The hierarchy of A is developed first then A.a() is used to develop the hierarchy of B (by creating instances of B also with children) however neither ‘know’ anything about the other which is what I am trying to change.</strong></p>

<p>Currently, I have designed a new method in A ('A.c()') that can be called at the return statement of each of the implementations of a() in the subclasses. The A.c() simply takes the instance of B that was being returned, sets a variable to that instance and then returns that instance of B to the return statement of A.a(). </p>

<p>The classes and methods that A and B relate to in the actual library are: Atom (A), Box (B) and createBox (A.a()). A.b and A.c() I have included as they are used in my current solution (see previous paragraph).</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Atom {

    private Box b = null;

    public abstract Box createBox()

    protected Box setB(Box box){
        this.b = box;
        return box;
    }
}

public class Alpha extends Atom {

    ...

    public Box createBox(){
        ...
        Box box = new Box();
        ...
        return setB(box);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I feel this is not a neat nor manageable solution. Ideally I’d like to just be able to write the code such that whatever A.a() returns, a variable in A is set to this. Does anyone know a way of achieving this or could perhaps suggest a broader strategy that I should look at employing to tackle the problem at a different level?</p>

<p>Any help particularly guidance rewording the question or requests for more info would be appreciated! I've been battling this one for a couple of days now and am sure I'm missing something.</p>

<p>I am using the same Java compiler (openjdk 1.6) and I think everything is with the same configuration. The file struts-config.xml hasn't been changed, and in my other laptop is working.
Permissions in all the files and directories are also the same.</p>

<p>Where is the problem? What else can I check?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I have a bytearray that I need to do an XOR on to get a checksum value.  The starting checksum has to be 5A before the XOR.  This needs to be appended to the end of the array and sent to my external device.</p>

<p>I 'THINK' I am doing this right, but I am not getting a response from the device.  I have checked the device and it is working correctly, so I am assuming it is my code.</p>

<p>So with that I have put up the code below.  Any help forming the packet to send out would be very helpful as I have been knocking my head against the wall.  I am not a very experienced python programmer but I can usually figure things out when they are explained or examples given.</p>

I have an application that I want to use with the Split View Navigation. So when the App is in Landscape the menu will be on the left of the split screen and when in portrait it will appear as a button at the top.</p>

<p>I have gone through the exact steps as I know them on how to achieve this. Below is what I have in my Default Package File:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;s:states&gt;
        &lt;s:State name=""portrait""/&gt;
        &lt;s:State name=""landscape""/&gt;
    &lt;/s:states&gt; 

    &lt;s:SplitViewNavigator id=""svn"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" autoHideFirstViewNavigator=""true""&gt;
        &lt;s:ViewNavigator id=""leftNav"" width=""310"" height=""100%"" firstView=""views.Menu""/&gt;
        &lt;s:ViewNavigator id=""rightNav"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" firstView=""views.Home""&gt;
            &lt;s:actionContent.portrait&gt;
            &lt;s:Button id=""NavButton"" label=""Menu"" fontSize=""15"" click=""svn.showFirstViewNavigatorInPopUp(NavButton)""/&gt;
            &lt;/s:actionContent.portrait&gt;         
        &lt;/s:ViewNavigator&gt;
    &lt;/s:SplitViewNavigator&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>however when I use this code and the app is in landscape I can still see the menu button in the right pane at the top, whats even stranger is if I click this button when in landscape the right hand section will expand to fill the screen and the menu will go into the pop-out box.</p>

<p>Is there something I am missing here or something else I have to set as have tried about 20 different approaches with no luck and its sooooo frustrating? Thanks in advance :-)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>when we fetch data for a node in Firebase, we also retrieve all of its child nodes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this in mind, is it still efficient to nest deeply if the data is still denormalized properly?</p>

<p>For example, here is a possible Firebase structure for an app with geotagged posts and <a href=""https://github.com/firebase/geofire/"" rel=""nofollow"">geo-indexes</a> by post language:</p>

<pre><code>posts/{postId}
indexes/
        languages/
                  en/geohashes/{geohash}
                  es/geohashes/{geohash}
                  de/geohashes/{geohash}
</code></pre>

<p>Compare this to a completely flat structure:</p>

<pre><code>posts/{postId}
index_en_geohashes/{geohash}
index_es_geohashes/{geohash}
index_de_geohashes/{geohash}
</code></pre>

<p>I find the first nested structure clean and self-documenting. Is this just as efficient as the flat structure? (Let's say the most common use-case is 'query language x geohashes')</p>

<p>I believe I have follwed all the guidelines in the doc.
The dialog shows up as it should, but the 'dialogReturn'-event does not seem to fire (or get caught). 
At least I do not get any activity in my listener-routine specified in the html-file</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p:commandLink title=""Remove user"" actionListener=""#{ctrlUsersBean.pbDeleteUserPrepare(user)}""

&lt;/p:commandLink&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the Dialog I only have a couple of commandButtons.
In the actionListener which I trigger (and I actually get there) from the Dialog, I do a CloseDialog call:</p>

<pre><code>    MyObject w = new MyObject(1);
    RequestContext.getCurrentInstance().closeDialog(w);
</code></pre>

<p>where I pass an object back to the parent page, and I expect to pick it up in my listener-routine</p>

<pre><code>    public void pbDeleteUser(SelectEvent ev) {
        MyObject w =(MyObject)ev.getObject();
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>but I never get to this code.</p>

<p>I am using a SessionBean to run all the code involved.</p>

<p>I am running the Primefaces version 5.2</p>

<p>I have include the specified 3 lines in the 'application'-section in
   the faces-config.xml file.</p>

<p>As a start I am only running it in Netbeans (v. 7.4),
   but I think that should work ok.</p>

<p>If anybody have a tip about where I went wrong, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>The RegAsm command I used was ""RegAsm.exe MyVBALib.dll /tlb:MyVBALib.tlb /codebase  following advice found in the last post <a href=""http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/654801-dll-entry-point-error.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

I am using <a href=""http://www.plupload.com"" rel=""nofollow"">PlUpload</a> which lets you upload files using Ajax while providing you back events like percentage, completion, etc. You instantiate the object, then call the ""init"" (telling it on which ID to ""link to"") and then add all the event listeners. Since the page which needs the object is created at run time and cannot include JS, I simply created a DIV (which I will make invisible when everything works...) in the main page with the links inside.</p>

<p>This is the link:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id=""browse"" href=""javascript:;""&gt;Browse&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I click it directly, it works.</p>

<p>When I create the new subpage in real-time, I want the link to be called when the user clicks on an image, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img onclick=""document.getElementById('browse').click(); return false;"" src=""whatever.jpg""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't seem to be working. If I use any other ""clickable link"" rather than the ""browse"", it works, so there is no apparent error in the syntax.</p>

<p>Please note that if I modify the link like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id=""browse"" onclick=""alert('Hello'); return false;"" href=""javascript:;""&gt;Browse&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can see the ""Hello"" popup when I click on the image.</p>

<p>I am a beginner in JS/HTML, so if this is an obvious problem... Sorry ;)
Or if you know of a better solution to the general problem (without jQuery please), I would be grateful :)</p>

<p>This is the init part of the PlUpload:</p>

<pre><code>var uploader = new plupload.Uploader({
  browse_button: 'browse', 
  url: 'newupload.php',
});

uploader.init();

<p>I know that this is a duplicate question sort of, but i couldn't quite figure out how to implement the 10+ suggestions into my current script. I just can't seem to include the regex argument, without the script from breaking. I tried to add it within the for loop.</p>

<p>Blame that on me still being a n00b, and blame that on my ADD. I suppose I just don't know where I need to add .replace(/\""/g, """") as this code seems to be working for others.</p>

<ul>
<li>PersonID=1 can edit their profile by going to <a href=""http://localhost/person/edit/1"">http://localhost/person/edit/1</a></li>
<li>PersonID=2 can edit their profile by going to <a href=""http://localhost/person/edit/2"">http://localhost/person/edit/2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing particularly exciting there...</p>

<p>However, I have run into a bit of trouble with the Authorization scheme.  There are only two roles in the system right now, ""Administrator"" and ""DefaultUser"", but there will likely be more in the future.</p>

<p>I can't use the regular Authorize attribute to specify Authorization because both users are in the same role (i.e., ""DefaultUser"").</p>

<p>So, if I specify the Authorize Filter like so:</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize(Roles = ""DefaultUser"")]
</code></pre>

<p>then there is no effect.  PersonID=1 can go in and edit their own profile (as they should be able to), but they can also just change the URL to <a href=""http://localhost/person/edit/2"">http://localhost/person/edit/2</a> and they have full access to edit PersonID=2's profile as well (which they should not be able to do).</p>

<p>Does this mean that I have to create my own Authorization filter that checks if the action  the user is requesting ""belongs"" to them before allowing them access?  That is, if the edit action, with parameter = 1 is being requested by the currently logged in person, do I need to do a custom check to make sure that the currently logged in person is PersonID=1, and if so, authorize them, and if not, deny access?</p>

<p>Feels like I'm missing something obvious here, so any guidance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>However, I'm not sure if this is the way to do it (although it works so far). So here is an example:</p>

<p>The <code>Position</code> class should act like a simple <code>numpy.array</code>, but it should map the attributes <code>.x</code>, <code>.y</code> and <code>.z</code> to the three array components. I overwrote the <code>__new__</code> method which returns an <code>ndarray</code> with the initial array. To allow access and modification of the array, I defined properties along with setters for each one.</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np


class Position(np.ndarray):
    """"""Represents a point in a 3D space

    Adds setters and getters for x, y and z to the ndarray.

    """"""
    def __new__(cls, input_array=(np.nan, np.nan, np.nan)):
        obj = np.asarray(input_array).view(cls)
        return obj

    @property
    def x(self):
        return self[0]

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value):
        self[0] = value

    @property
    def y(self):
        return self[1]

    @y.setter
    def y(self, value):
        self[1] = value

    @property
    def z(self):
        return self[2]

    @z.setter
    def z(self, value):
        self[2] = value
</code></pre>

<p>This seems however a bit too much code for such a basic logic and I'm wondering if I do it the ""correct"" way. I also need bunch of other classes like <code>Direction</code> which will have quite a few other functionalities (auto-norm on change etc.) and before I start integrating numpy, I thought I ask you…</p>

<p>Rotating the cube is done with dragging the mouse while holding the right mouse button. This works using the example of a arcball from NeHe Tutorials(<a href=""http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/arcball_rotation/19003/"" rel=""nofollow"">NeHe Arcball</a>)</p>

<p>I have the class singleCubes which represents one cube via 6 actual quads, stored in a display list that can be used in it´s draw method. 
Class ComplexCube has an array of 3x3x3 singleCubes and is used as interface when interacting with the complete rubiks cube.</p>

<p>Now i want to rotate each specific face according to the mousedragging with left mouse button down. I use picking to get the id of the corresponding side of the single cube the user clicked on. This works also. So i click on a side of one cube on a face and depending on the direction of the dragging i set a rotation and offset factor of the cubes that get affected. (i also want to implement that u actually see the face rotate instead of just changing the color) </p>

<p>Now my Problem is that when i rotate the rubiks cube in any direction with right mouse dragging, it becomes upside down for example. So when i click on a side and want to rotate the face to the right, it´s going the wrong direction because i can´t keep track if the cube is upside down or whatever. Due to the use of the arcball rotation i dont have a x- or y-rotation angle which i could use to determine this. </p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> How can i keep track or later on get the information if the cube is upside down, tilted etc in order to translate the mouse dragging information(when rotating one face) when using the arcball example linked above?</p>

<pre><code>// In render function
glPushMatrix();
{
    glMultMatrixf(Transform.M); // Rotation applied by arcball object

                &lt;!--{% crispy form %}--&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

<p>and then I've my forms which contains the AbstracUser model as follow:</p>

<p>class AdminLoginForm(forms.ModelForm):</p>

<pre><code>class Meta:
    model = models.AdminWebsite
    exclude = []
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve is to have my form make use of the crispy-forms and style it from the django-forms by making use of the crispy-forms layout. The navigation bar will look exactly as in this website: <a href=""http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/horizontal-login-form-in-navbar-with-prepend"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/horizontal-login-form-in-navbar-with-prepend</a>.

<p>class AdminLoginForm(forms.ModelForm):</p>

<pre><code>class Meta:
    model = models.AdminWebsite
    exclude = []

helper = FormHelper()
helper.form_action = 'POST'
helper.form_action = 'login-view'
helper.form_class = 'form-horizontal'
helper.label_class = 'col-md-5'
helper.field_class = 'col-md-6'
helper.layout = Layout(

    HTML(
        'div class=""form-group navbar-form navbar-right"" role=form""&gt;'
        # '&lt;div class=""input-group""&gt;'
        '&lt;span class=""input-group-addon""&gt;&lt;i class=""glyphicon glyphicon-user""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'
    ),
    HTML('&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'),
)
</code></pre>

<p>and in my template I've this : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""collapse navbar-collapse""&gt;
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}
{% crispy form %}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I just make use of the normal css-styling, the page is displayed as I want, but if I try to style it from my forms with crispy-forms, then the result is very different.</p>

<p>any help will be really appreciated.</p>

Well, I know this question has a good chance of being closed within the first 10 minutes, but I am going to ask it anyways for I have spent almost day and an half trying to find a solution. Still, I can't figure this one out. There is not much info on this on the Internet not even on the HASP (safenet) website although they have demos.</p>

<p>I have a HASP HL USB dongle. I try to convert their demo and test run it but for the life of me I simply can't get it to login even. It keeps raising <strong>Aladdin.HASP.HaspStatus.HaspDotNetDllBroken</strong> exception.</p>

<p>However, if I run the C version of their demo, it works perfectly. </p>

<p>Here is the Csharp version of my code:</p>

<pre><code>Aladdin.HASP;
HASP myHasp = new HASP();
var thestatus = myHasp.Login(vender_code);
myHasp.Logout;

<p>I would like to login to USB HASP and get its HaspID and the settings in its memory.</p>

However, when I call <code>fadeOut</code> on the enlarged <code>div</code> the smaller one also disappears because <code>fadeOut</code> sets <code>display: none</code> upon completion.  Is there a way to <code>fadeIn</code> and <code>fadeOut</code> a copy of a div without affecting the original?  Keep in mind that this <code>div</code> does not contain an image, rather it holds a large set of other <code>divs</code> and text.</p>

    $(""#inner-box"").fadeOut(600);

<p>I implemented in the following way but confusion arise in various cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to implement Class Student use the interface Search.</li>
<li>How to implement Class Librarian use the interfaces Search and Manage.</li>
<li>Why we are not use association instead of usage dependency.</li>
<li>How to implement that Enumeration data type in this case with usage dependency [I have just considered AccountState as a class, i the it is a wrong implementation].</li>
<li>How to use AccountState in the Account [I have just created a object of AccountState].</li>
<li>After read many blogs still unable to implement Aggregation and Composition confidently. <strong>Note:</strong> In this diagram 3 Aggregations and 1 Composition Exist. Those are:<br/>
(a) Library consists of many Account. {Aggregation}<br/>
(b) Many Book Item is the part of Library. {Aggregation}<br/>
(c) An Account is the part of a Student. {Aggregation}<br/>
(d) Library must have a Catalog. {Composition}<br/>
Please give your valuable advice so i can learn it well. Thanking you.</li>

<pre><code>$('.parent  div').hide();
$('.parent  div.a').show();

$('#mini-nav img').click(function () {
    console.log($(this).index('img'));
    var $div = $('.parent &gt; div').eq($(this).index('#mini-nav img'));
    $div.show();
    $('.parent &gt; div').not($div).hide();

The thing is that I need to create the distribution of functions which cannot be integrated or that the integral is seriously complex or messy.</p>

<p>One example would be to generate random numbers that would follow a distribution of the function: </p>

<pre><code>f(x) = (cos(x))^1.5
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any math library in Java where you can define a function and it returns random numbers?
Any recommendations?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Is there a standard tapestry-3 technique to Internationalize strings that appear as Javascript literals?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input jwcid=""submitBtn"" type=""submit"" accesskey=""U"" value=""Update"" class=""actionBtn"" onclick=""return confirm('Are you sure that you want to do that?');""/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Can I simply replace the question with a tapestry  tag in this and any other context?  Say something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input jwcid=""submitBtn"" type=""submit"" accesskey=""U"" value=""Update"" class=""actionBtn"" onclick=""return confirm('&lt;span key=""AreYouSure""&gt;Are you sure that you want to do that?&lt;/span&gt;');""/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the source file contains an element inside an attribute which would be fine inside a JSP.  Does tapestry-3 handle this? If not, is there a way to do this in tapestry-3?</p>

<p>I have a few questions:</p>

<p>1) What is the best, or most widely used pattern to develop MVC apps in? Repository, DDD, UOW?</p>

<p>2) I am using the Entity Framework 4, so could some please explain to me or point me to a good source that will explain the Repository Pattern w/EF4? Doesn't EF4 take place as the business layer and the data access layer? Does the Repository Pattern even provide a benefit?</p>

<p>3) Also, one last question, could someone explain the whole relationship between the Controller, the Model and the View? I get the basics, but maybe a little more in depth of the correct way to use it. View Models - Say I have a view that displays customer info, and one that edits it, should I have a view model and an edit model, or can the be passed around?</p>

<p>Using JRE7, this works fine.  Using JRE8, it doesn't work.</p>

<p>The difference appears to be that 7 is encoding the XML as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;my thing=""firstline&amp;#xD;&amp;#xA;secondline"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>whereas 8 is generating:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;my thing=""firstline
secondline"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The default behaviour in .Net is to strip ""extraneous"" whitespace in the XML, so from Java 7 the value arrives correctly (because the escaped characters don't become whitespace until they're unescaped, so don't get stripped), whereas from Java 8, the value arrives in the .Net object property as:</p>

<pre><code>""firstline secondline""
</code></pre>

<p>with the line-break replaced with a space.</p>

<p>I need either to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>get J8 to encode the XML as per J7, escaping the line-break in the attribute value (which is the solution I'm currently favouring), or</p></li>
<li><p>get .Net parser to preserve whitespace - this is easy enough if I'm writing code to parse XML, but unfortunately this is happening inside the webservice wrapper and I don't appear to have much control over it.  This solution also has a broader impact (there are multiple clients for the same web-service, not all of which are Java and not all of which are in my control) so means a lot more testing to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far, no idea how to do either of these.  Found a post suggesting that changing the encoding to ""UTF-8"" on the (Java) Marshaller instance might solve it, but it didn't mention how I actually get this object when all I have is a Service object.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Adding a pass to a compiler means revisiting the tree to perform some optimizations or some analysis. I would like to emulate the behavior of __cyg_profile_func_exit but only for some functions and be able to access the original return value.</p>

<p>So I'm going to try to enhance my question. I would like to emulate really basic AOSD-like behavior. AOSD or Aspect oriented programming enables to add crosscutting concerns (debugging is a cross-cutting concern).</p>

<p>I would like to be able to say, I'd like to trigger the dbg function after function foo has been executed. The problem is how to tell the compiler to modify the control flow and execute dbg. dbg should be executed between return and foo(argc) ...</p>

<p>That's really like __cyg_profile_function_exit but only in some cases (and the problem in __cyg_profile_function_exit is that you cannot easily see and modify the returned value).</p>

  <p>It is called a literal because it is literal - you use its value
  literally. The number 2 always represents itself and nothing else - it
  is a constant because its value cannot be changed. Hence, all these
  are referred to as literal constants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where it says,""it is called literal because it is literal-you use the it's value literally"",i just don't get this part.What is the book trying to say that we use the value literally?the another vague point is that the number 2 is a constant because it's value cannot be changed.How is it possible?we can change it,like:</p>

<p>Stack = 2</p>

<p>Stack = 3</p>

<p>First,i assigned the number 2 to the Stack then i changed the value of the Stack(Which is that number 2 that the book is claiming it is a constant so it cannot be changed)and assigned the number 3 to it.So i easily changed the value of the number 2.I am really confused,if you didn't get my point,please tell me so i can give more examples.Thank you for giving your time guys.</p>

<pre><code>myselect.scrollTop = myselect.scrollHeight;

<p>Although <code>scrollHeight</code> is out of bounds, the browsers figure that out and limit it appropriately.  Except in Google Chrome.  I could file a bug report, but that doesn't help me with my immediate problem.  So I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>myselect.scrollTop = myselect.scrollHeight - myselect.clientHeight;

<p>But that subtracted too much -- there were items below the bottom of the element.  I also tried subtracting <code>offsetHeight</code>, but that was slightly worse.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a browser-agnostic way to properly calculate the <code>scrollTop</code> that is properly in-bounds so it'll work with Chrome?</p>

<p>BTW, I found this question on stackoverflow:  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6333028/cross-browser-method-for-setting-scrolltop-of-an-element"">Cross-Browser method for setting ScrollTop of an element?</a>.

<p>I created a function called <code>tmplReplaceContent</code> that accepts 3 parameters <code>template</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>target</code></p>

<p>I've worked it out in <a href=""http://mustache.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">mustache.js</a> too, which I think I got bugs on, took me about 10 hours, but still no luck in debugging what is wrong. So I decided to shift to <em>dust</em> , but also because of its good feats. </p>

<p>Now, for the question again, I want to check whether the <code>template</code> is a path or <strong>dust template</strong>, if it is a path, then <code>$.get</code> it, if it is a template, then just use it, same goes for the <code>json</code>, if it is a path do <code>$.getJSON</code> else use it as it is.</p>

<p>Here is my <em>mustache</em> implementation, as you can see, the regex only checks for single <code>{{template}}</code> and will not work if I have complex template, if it is troublesome to do a complex check, I will be just fetching all the templates from a file. </p>

<pre><code>tmplReplaceContent : function(json, tmpl, target) {
    var regex = new RegExp(""\{{[a-zA-Z\.\_]*\}}""),
    view = '';
    function setOutput(template) {
        var content = Mustache.render(template, view);
        $(target).html(content).hide().fadeIn();
    }
    function doJSON(json) {
        view = json;
        if(!regex.test(tmpl)){
            /* get mustache tmpl from the path */
            $.get(msi.vars.tmpl_url + tmpl + '.mustache', setOutput);
        } else {
            setOutput(tmpl);

    }
    /* json -&gt; check if object */
    if (typeof json === 'object') {

    } else {
        /* getJSON from the path */
        $.getJSON(msi.vars.base_url + json, doJSON);

</blockquote>

<p>I have visited the url endpoint provided by ssocircle and the metadata is exposed.</p>

<p>If I visit the <code>/saml/metadata</code> endpoint of the service provider and get some helpful information: an <code>org.opensaml.saml2.metadata.provider.MetadataProviderException</code> exception. The description if which is ""No IDP was configured, please update included metadata with at least one IDP""; however, the source of this may be the above described error. </p>

<h3>QUESTION</h3>

<p>Am I missing something that is readily apparent to start the example application? In other words, what does this error tell me that I need to be investigating? Or, as it is ""non-breaking"", do I ignore it?</p>

<h3>WHY I'M ASKING</h3>

<p>The documentation surrounding the deployment of the Sample Java Configuration application is minimal (as in ""non-existant""). The self-documentation only provides ""hints"", such as the following:</p>

<pre><code> // IDP Metadata configuration - paths to metadata of IDPs in circle of trust is here
 // Do no forget to call initialize method on providers
 @Bean
 @Qualifier(""metadata"")
 public CachingMetadataManager metadata() throws MetadataProviderException {
      List&lt;MetadataProvider&gt; providers = new ArrayList&lt;MetadataProvider&gt;();
      providers.add(ssoCircleExtendedMetadataProvider());
      return new CachingMetadataManager(providers);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>I am certain there is something I am not doing, particularly since I have not done anything in the deployment of the application except for the run of the <code>mvn package</code>, described above. </p>

<p>The code:</p>

<pre><code>__xdata __at (0x0F00) volatile static unsigned char Programmed; /*!&lt; an indicator if     the board is programmed or not, during init copied from flash to xram*/

/*!

void main(void){
    unsigned short int TempUSInt;

<p>Note about the code: the code is written for the <a href=""http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">SDCC compiler</a> for a 8051 microcontroller.
The <code>__xdata __at ()</code> directive is a special instruction so the compiler knows that it has to place the data in a separate memory segment (called XDATA) at a predetermined location (address 0x0F00).</p>

<p>My probem is that doxygen recognizes the <code>__at()</code> as a function instead of a variable and thus overwrites the <code>main()</code> function.</p>

<p>Although there are ways to make doxygen ignore the <code>__xdata __at () char Programmed</code> statement this has as downside that the variable is ignored and thus not documented.</p>

<p>So is there anyone who knows how to get doxygen to recognize the <code>__xdata __at () char Programmed</code> as a variable instead of a function?</p>

<p>There is one method missing here, it's the readFile. It returns an array[][][], number of rows, columns and the rgb values respectifully. Any ideia on how I can fix this?</p>

I'm using SQLAlchemy and Geoalchemy and the particular block of code that triggers Eclipse and Aptana to start pegging the cpu while simply editing the file is:</p>

<pre><code>obsRecs = db.session.query(multi_obs)\
.join(sensor,sensor.row_id == multi_obs.sensor_id)\
.join(platform,platform.row_id == sensor.platform_id)\
.join(m_type,m_type.row_id == multi_obs.m_type_id)\
.join(m_scalar_type,m_scalar_type.row_id == m_type.m_scalar_type_id)\
.join(obs_type,obs_type.row_id == m_scalar_type.obs_type_id)\
.join(uom_type,uom_type.row_id == m_scalar_type.uom_type_id)\
.filter(multi_obs.m_date &gt; dateOffset)\
.filter(multi_obs.m_type_id.in_(mTypes))\
.filter(multi_obs.d_top_of_hour == 1)\
.filter(platform.active &lt; 3)\
.filter(platform.the_geom.within(WKTSpatialElement(bboxPoly, -1)))\
.order_by(platform.row_id)\
.all()
</code></pre>

<p>As soon as I start editing anything in that block, the issue occurs. I've cut out that bit of code and edited other areas in the file, and I have no problems. I've edited other python files with no problems as well. At first I thought there was some issue with code completion, so I turned that off and still get the issue.</p>

<p>I was using Eclipse Indigo and if I did not Force Quit the app, an out of memory Java error would get thrown. In Aptana the cpu spikes, then will go back to an idle usage, then spike again if I started editing again.</p>

<p>My setup:
OS X Lion
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_31-b04-415-11M3646)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.6-b01-415, mixed mode)
i7 Quad core, 8Gb RAM</p>

<p>I thought the issue may have been triggered by the latest java update from Apple, so I rolled back the entire machine via Time Machine to a pre-update state and still have the issue. </p>

<p>I'd appreciate any pointers, I am at the point of trying to find a non-PyDev based solution.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Allowing Eclipse to run until erroring out, Console.App does show the following:</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>Grabbed the Oracle JDK, set the system to use it. Same issue.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>Similar problem is still occurring after a restore from backups. This issue must have been lurking and the code block managed to be just right to trigger it. Code completion engine is still prime suspect.</p>

<p>The code works, users invoke the code using <code>./scriptname file &gt; newfile</code></p>

<p>However, I am trying to expand the code to give users an error message if they invoke the script incorrectly. </p>

<p>For the error messange, I'm thinking of echoing something back like <code>scriptname file_to_process &gt; output_file</code>. </p>

<p>However I have had little luck. The code runs but does nothing if I invoke with just the script name. Also, if I invoke the script with just the scriptname and the input file, it will output the results instead of exiting with the error message.</p>

<p>Other ones I have tried are</p>

<pre><code>if [ ! -n $1 ]; then

  echo 'Usage: '
  echo 
  echo './Scriptname inputfile &gt; outputfile'

if [ ! -f ""$1"" ]; then

  echo 'Usage: '
  echo 
  echo './Scriptname inputfile &gt; outputfile'
  exit 0

Everything works fine when I'm doing it on the first level. However, when try to implement a nested collection meaning a BeginCollectionItem in another BeginCollectionItem, it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>My models are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class Order
{

        [Key]
        [HiddenInput]
        public int id { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = ""Order number"")]

public class PaymentMethod
{

        public CC cc { get; set; }
        public CASH cash { get; set; }
        public TT tt { get; set; }
}

public class TT
{
        [Key]
        public int id { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = ""Total amount"")]
        public double? total_value { get; set; }

        ...

        [Display(Name = ""Transfers"")]
        public List&lt;Transfer&gt; transfers { get; set; }
}

public class Transfer
{
        [Key]
        public int id { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = ""Payment"")]
        public int payment_id { get; set; }

        [Required(ErrorMessage = ""{0} is required."")]
        [Display(Name = ""SWIFT"")]
        public string swift { get; set; }

        [Required(ErrorMessage = ""{0} is required."")]
        [Display(Name = ""Amount transferred"")]
        public double? transfer_amount { get; set; }

        [Required(ErrorMessage = ""{0} is required."")]
        [Display(Name = ""Date transferred"")]
        public DateTime transfer_date { get; set; }

        ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now what i have is an Order which could have several payment methods, and if one of the payment methods is a TT (telex transfer) it could have several transfers involved.
Implementing several payment methods in one Order as a collection works, but when I try to implement several transfers within a TT, nothing of these transfers gets passed to the controller.</p>

<p>Here's what my view looks like:</p>

<pre><code>@model prj.Models.Model.Order

@using (Html.BeginForm(""Create"")){
@Html.ValidationSummary(true, ""Creation was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again."")

...

@Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.number, new { id = ""txtnumber"" })

...


&lt;div id=""editorPaymentRows""&gt;
    @foreach (var payment in Model.payment_methods)
    {
        @Html.Partial(""_NewPayment"", payment)
    }
&lt;/div&gt;

}
</code></pre>

<p>In the _NewPayment partial:</p>

<pre><code>@using prj.Helpers 
@model prj.Models.Model.PaymentMethod

&lt;div class=""editPaymentRow""&gt;

@using (Html.BeginCollectionItem(""payment_methods""))
{
...

&lt;div class=""editor-label""&gt;
    @Html.LabelFor(m =&gt; m.tt.total_value)&lt;req&gt;*&lt;/req&gt;      
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""editor-field""&gt;
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.tt.total_value)
&lt;/div&gt;

...


&lt;div id=""editorTransferRows""&gt;
   @if (Model.tt != null)
{
    foreach (var transfer in Model.tt.transfers)
    {
         @Html.Partial(""_NewTransfer"", transfer)
    }
}
...
&lt;/div&gt;



}

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and finally in the _NewTransfer partial:</p>

<pre><code>@using prj.Helpers 
@model prj.Models.Model.Transfer
...

&lt;div class=""editTransferRow""&gt;
//using (Html.BeginCollectionItem(""transfers""))
@using (Html.BeginCollectionItem(""tt.transfers""))
{
...

&lt;div class=""editor-label""&gt;
    @Html.LabelFor(m =&gt; m.swift)&lt;req&gt;*&lt;/req&gt;      
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""editor-field""&gt;
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.swift, new { @class = ""t_swift"" })
&lt;/div&gt;

...

&lt;div class=""editor-label""&gt;
    @Html.LabelFor(m =&gt; m.transfer_amount)&lt;req&gt;*&lt;/req&gt;      
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""editor-field""&gt;
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.transfer_amount, new { @class = ""t_transfer_amount"" })
&lt;/div&gt;

...
}

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So everything works, except in the controller the List transfers which is in TT property of the PaymentMethods is always null. It's not being passed to the controller properly. Is there something i'm missing?</p>

<p>Does nested BeginCollectionItem not work? is there an extra step I must do?
Please shed some light.
Thanks</p>

The problem seems to be that the Silent page only captures the information through POST if the Silent page loads (i.e., click button on Silent_Test user redirected to Silent and page loads).

<p>FYI: I am using VS2005, .net 2.0.</p>

<p>I have a GridView control that exists in the FormView EditItemTemplate. Unfortunately, the GridView misbehaves in that setup, its DataKeys collection is empty when the page posts back and the select command of the gridview fires.</p>

<p>Here is the sequence of events:</p>

<ol>
<li>User browses to the page</li>
<li>User clicks 'edit' (FormView renders EditItemTemplate where the GridView is)</li>
<li>The user clicks search which postbacks again and populates the GridView located in the EditItemTemplate (at this point the GridView has DataKeys)</li>
<li>User selects item from GridView which raises row selected event</li>
<li>On postback, the GridView RowCommand fires,- I check that the CommandName = ""select"" and run my code which throws exception because the DataKeys collection is empty at this point!</li>
</ol>

<p>One more additional detail: The GridView lives in a user control that resides in the EditItemTemplate of the FormView.</p>

<p>NOTE:</p>

<p>I was able to resolve this problem when I move my GridView out of the EditItemTemplate of the FormView,- now DataKeys collection is NOT empty. Unfortunately, the GridView has to be in the EditItemTemplate for the user to select clients he searched for.</p>

<p>Any insight would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Event handling code:</p>

<pre><code>protected void ctlSearchResults_RowCommand(object sender, GridViewCommandEventArgs e)
{
    // user has selected the client from the keyword search result list
    if (e.CommandName == ""select"")
    {

        int selectedRowIndex = int.Parse((string)e.CommandArgument);

I've been stuck on this for a while now, and I just can't seem to figure it out...</p>

<p>(edit: I can't just put someBoolean = false after the function, because the function is actually an __index function on a proxy table)</p>

I've seen that in Xcode you can click on a AppViewController.xib interface file and click on the <em>+</em> in the Localization section of the inspector window to add another language along with the default English one (I add Italian for example)... This allows me to translate the interface in Italian... but then how do you maintain future evolution of the App? If you need to add a button, for example, you have to add it <em>by hand</em> to all the localized versions of your interface NIB file? Documentation says also</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Objects in a nib file typically have connections between them that should not be broken. Make sure you lock all connections before handing your nibs off to translation. For information on how to lock down your nib file, see “Localization” in Interface Builder User Guide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you explain me this concept? I've seen the Localization Locking section within the inspector which allows you to lock <em>Properties</em>, <em>Localizable Properties</em> or <em>Un-localizable Properties</em>, but I don't understand very well what it does.</p>

<p>So, to sum up a bit, I'd like you to suggest me what is the workflow to design localized versions of your interface and maintain the multiple NIB files when the interface evolves.</p>

<p>The SQL table schema is this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Perfmon_MBX]
(
    [ID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [Server] [varchar](50) NULL,
    [ObjectName] [varchar](100) NULL,
    [CounterName] [varchar](100) NULL,
    [InstanceName] [varchar](100) NULL,
    [Value] [decimal](18, 3) NULL,
    [DateTime] [datetime] NULL
)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a typical query I am running to pull back data:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
Server,
ObjectName,
CounterName,
InstanceName,
Value,
DateTime
FROM Perfmon_MBX
WHERE ObjectName = 'logicaldisk'
AND CounterName = 'avg. disk sec/read'
AND InstanceName LIKE 'd:\databasefolder\dag1%'
AND Server = 'mailboxserver.domain.com'
AND DateTime &gt; '2012-10-04 09:00:00'
AND DateTime &lt; '2012-10-04 09:20:00'
ORDER BY InstanceName, DateTime
</code></pre>

<p>The data comes out like in this .csv file I've uploaded here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://ge.tt/1M7utuO/v/0?c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ge.tt/1M7utuO/v/0?c</a></p>

<p>The problem I am having, is that each database (in the InstanceName column) needs to have a different series or line on the graph.</p>

<p>I can't see an easy way to do this without manually adding all of the 10 series, which is a bit of waste of time, and this example is a cut down/simple one compared to reality.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me graph this data more easily using Excel?</p>

<p>Do I need to adjust my SQL query somehow, or is there an easy to do this in Excel that I am just totally missing?</p>

<p>If you need any more info please ask</p>

<p>I have two divs: mainbody and rightpanel. I would like the rightpanel to be a fixed size (210px), and to sit to the right of the mainbody div which fills up all the remaining space of the window.</p>

<p>So it would resize like this:</p>

<p>My current solution below sort of works, but if the window is resized to below about 900px the right bar gets pushed to the bottom as the 25% remaining space gets too small for it to fit into, so I force the window to horizontally scroll at this width.</p>

<pre><code>#wrap {
    width:97%;
    margin:0 auto;
}

#mainbody {
    float:left;
    width: 75%;
    margin-right: 10px;
    margin-left: 10px;
}

#rightpanel  {
    float:right;
    width: 22%;
    min-width: 210px;
    max-width: 210px;
}

<p>We can do it by convolution image with a mask.

I have already assign user roles and programatically assigned them based upon a few selections during registration.  I have added a page that uses the CreateUserWizard form, with an added step to collect some more information from the customer (specifically the company name so we know which parts to allow them to order).  The problem is that once someone fills out the first registration process and clicks ""Create User"", the user is created there and directs them to the next step where I collect the company information.  If the user aborts the process, the user account is still created, and they are not assigned to a usergroup.  The last page (step) of the CreateUserWizard has a finish button where it assigns them to the user group based upon a few selections from the second step.  How can I keep the user from being added until the registration process is actually completed?  Here is the code I have so far behind the scenes.</p>

<p>this line <code>if (this.numAnswer &lt; 4)</code> is where I think the problem lies, as after the final loop it is going straight to the function <code>showScore()</code>, I could be wrong, but if I change the loop to <code>(this.numAnswer &lt;= 4)</code> the final question needs to be selected again, and then the score is correct.</p>

I tried to repro the issue with the new VS 2012 Web Application project template, removed unnecessary content and couldn't repro this issue.  </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>I want to load a list of elements in a node. I have the node's ID. The 2 ways I can fetch the elements are the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>send a single request with the node ID and get all the information about the n first elements in the node in a single response ;</li>
<li>send a first request with the node ID to get the IDs of the n first elements in the node, then for each one send another request to have one response per element.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm balanced between about that.</p>

<ul>
<li>the heavyweight single response may cause more lag and timeouts because of the very unstable and slow mobile internet connection ;</li>
<li>the phone may have trouble handling too many responses at the same time.</li>

<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/fatgamer85/677U8/7/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/fatgamer85/677U8/7/</a></p>

<p>I have a fixed sidebar div with a list of menu items which would popup out sub-menus or divs. I am using a jquery library called SlimScroller to create a facebook-styled scroller for the fixed sidebar div. I have another div on the side with a map in it and a div on the bottom which is a fixed footer.</p>

<p>The page is laid out in such a way that the side bar takes 15% of the screen and the rest is occupied by the map area.</p>

<p>When I hover over the list item in the sidebar, I wish to see the sub-menu pop out on hover. Due to overflow being hidden, this doesn't happen as shown in the image:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/oKdXC.png"" alt=""overflow hidden""></p>

<pre><code>.page-sidebar {
    overflow: hidden;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But when I force the overflow of sidebar to be visible using '!important' keyword I can see my sub-menu pop up on hover:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/V0VEo.png"" alt=""overflow forced to be visible""></p>

<pre><code>.page-sidebar {
    z-index: 1000 !important;
    overflow: visible !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried to change the CSS on hover using JavaScript, but that doesn't work for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Is there a solution to make sure that the Sidebar Scrolls as well as I can get the pop over with or without using JavaScript?</p>

<p>I currently have added the class .page-sidebar to make the popup appear. By doing so, the Sidebar doesn't scroll. If I remove the class .page-sidebar, the Sidebar Scrolls again, but this time the popup doesn't appear.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Probably answering my own question, 2.5.0 Aplha 4 doesnt have RequiresSTAAttribute, hence the runner is not honouring my Attribute...</p>

<p>I'd rather avoid having:</p>

1. Draw the Labels 1 time, but next time just reuse them, reuse the matrix or the textures, if there is any possibility (sorry I am a newbie, I may write some not adequate stuff);
2. When cleaning the buffer (glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)) clean just a part of the screen, not the whole Rendering scene, I would also be very happy to know if there is any possibility to clear not the whole screen but the drawn objects (for example in the Column chart, to clear just the columns, not the background and not the Labels, or lengend).

"12345131","1","12345390","","2012-09-10 03:51:15","","1","2055","<p>I have a question regarding the code found in the Apple documentation <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Moving content located under the keyboard</a>. I have researched this, but I'm looking for clarification on the concepts I am fuzzy on here before I start getting fancy with alternate solutions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as soon as the keyboard animation finishes moving the keyboard up, the view moves down and completely out of site. This happens whether the text field is actually the one that gets covered by the keyboard or not. So now I'm back to trying to understand the code provided in the documentation and after attempts changing a variety of parameters I've been unable to get it to work properly.</p>

<p>The pertinent code provided by Apple is:</p>

<pre><code> - (void)keyboardWasShown:(NSNotification*)aNotification

NSLog(@""keyboardWasShown"");
NSDictionary* info = [aNotification userInfo];
CGSize kbSize = [[info objectForKey:UIKeyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey] CGRectValue].size;

UIEdgeInsets contentInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(0.0, 0.0, kbSize.height, 0.0);
scrollView.contentInset = contentInsets;
scrollView.scrollIndicatorInsets = contentInsets;

// If active text field is hidden by keyboard, scroll it so it's visible
// Your application might not need or want this behavior.
CGRect aRect = self.view.frame;
aRect.size.height -= kbSize.height;
if (!CGRectContainsPoint(aRect, activeField.frame.origin) ) {
    NSLog(@""if"");
    CGPoint scrollPoint = CGPointMake(0.0, activeField.frame.origin.y-kbSize.height);
    NSLog(@""scrollPoint is %@"", NSStringFromCGPoint(scrollPoint));
    [scrollView setContentOffset:scrollPoint animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, before I change anything as described below, here's what I get:</p>

<pre><code>GO[4614:c07] keyboardWasShown
2012-09-08 22:58:23.892 DRO GO[4614:c07] if
2012-09-08 22:58:23.892 DRO GO[4614:c07] scrollPoint is {0, -281}
</code></pre>

<p>So, breaking it down:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>NSLog just info for me indicating the method was called</p></li>
<li><p>NSDictionary - contains info about the keyboard, including its dimensions, such that different keyboard sizes in different devices or orientations will be automatically accounted for.</p></li>
<li><p>CGSize - obtaining the actual size from the dictionary</p></li>
<li><p>UIEdgeInsets - found reference in UIKit Function Reference - creates an edge inset for button or view where an inset is a margin around the drawing rectangle where each side (left, right, top, and bottom) can have a different value. In this case, setting the bottom edge at the height of the keyboard. Since my view is moving down instead of up, I tried reversing the 'top' and 'bottom' values, thinking maybe they are inverted. Instead of the view scrolling smoothly down with animation, now it just blinks out of sight when the keyboard pops up and I get this:</p>

<p>GO[4829:c07] if
2012-09-08 23:06:57.146 DRO GO[4829:c07] scrollPoint is {0, -281}</p></li>
<li><p>scrollView.contentInset: the distance that the content view is inset from the enclosing scroll view.
Use this property to add to the scrolling area around the content. The unit of size is points. The default value isUIEdgeInsetsZero
Seems like this should be adding area to the bottom of the scroll view to allow it to move up along with the keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p>scrollView.scrollIndicatorInset - telling the scroll indicator to move proportionally to the view movement in response to the keyboard</p></li>
<li><p>CGRect - creating an aRect object with the view dimensions.</p></li>
<li><p>aRect - the height value of the CGRect, reduced by the height of the keyboard. I'm super fuzzy here - Should be the area of the view not covered by the keyboard. </p></li>
<li><p>if - if the CGpoint is not (in the rectangle that lies under the keyboard, at a point within the active text field) - which doesn't make sense; the logic here escapes me</p></li>
<li><p>NSLog - telling me we got this far</p></li>
<li><p>CGScrollPoint - defining the point the view should be scrolling to. Since view origin is upper left corner, subtracting the keyboard height should have it scroll up the distance of the keyboard height, keeping the textfield in view. Just for kicks, when I tried changing it to +kbSizeHeight I got the view disappearing swiftly and: GO[4682:c07] if
2012-09-08 23:02:48.078 DRO GO[4682:c07] scrollPoint is {0, 679}</p></li>
<li><p>NSLog - telling me what scroll point the view is to be moved to</p></li>
<li><p>[scrollView - telling the scrollView to adjust to the new scrollPoing using animation</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When I do a slightly more complicated command (e.g., <code>aws s3 mb s3://newbucketname</code>) it outputs: <code>__init__() keywords must be strings</code>.  </p>

<p>Based on some research I suspected the cause is that Python 2.6.1 is installed by default, so I downloaded v3.3.2, installed it, and used the 'Update Shell Profile.command' feature to set the correct PATH variable.</p>

<p>Now with the new version of Python installed and configured I still get the same results.  The Terminal still appears to be using the old version of Python, despite the $PATH variable pointing to the new version (v3.3.2).</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I'm guessing that it has to do with the Terminal not using the new version of Python and thus the AWS CLI functionality doesn't work, but there may be a different cause that I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>I am trying to effectively determine which approach is better: </p>

<p>Currently, I have a singleton instance that exposes entities that are loaded in lazy load fashion. I have listed three approaches which each of which has some advantages. The first approach relies solely on double lock pattern to ensure thread safety. The second approach doesn't use locking but it has the potential of double Load in case of a race. The third approach really uses a solution that I am becoming very fond of. (System.Lazy). </p>

<p>For some reason, I feel there is something wrong with the second approach (System.Thread.InterLocked), yet i can't pin point it. Is there a reason to favor one approach over the other? I did cover this in a previous post where I felt the third option is the way to go from now on.</p>

I don't wanna show the picture on top until the animation starts. The sequence is like this, one stretched picture on the screen, then another picture of the same dimensions slides in on top of the previous picture. The new picture will have a higher Z-index compared to the old picture. I've set up a storyboard, and visibility of the new picture to hidden. So when do I make the new picture visible? Is it right before calling <code>StoryBoard.Begin(MyNewPicture)</code>? So it becomes</p>

<pre><code>    //create picture object 
    //...
    MyNewPicture.Visibility = Visiblity.Hidden;
    //do some intialisation, and create StoryBoard
    //...
    MyNewPicture.Visibility = Visibility.Visible;
    MyStoryBoard.Begin(MyNewPicture);`
</code></pre>

<p>This works on my fast computer, but I wonder, if I run it on a slow computer, and if there is some kind of performance slow down / screen lag etc, will it make the new picture appear to cover the picture below it when it becomes visible, just before the animation starts? This will create a flicker on the screen which is not desirable. </p>

<p>Or should I put the visibility as part of the animation? Please take a look at this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/5495505"">answer</a> to a previous slightly similar question by someone else. Should I use ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames in the Xaml instead? Please note that once the animation starts, the new picture should be visible (forever), there's no need to toggle visibility in my case. I just want the New Picture to be visible right when the animation starts and not before the animation(or else it will block the previous picture). </p>

<p>I use the NATIVE Sandbox mode in Google Apps Script to ensure speed and compatibility with latest css and jquery functions.</p>

<p>Since Chrome 29 (and 30 via the dev channel), Chrome seems unable to support the NATIVE Sandbox mode and will only use the EMULATED mode.</p>

<p>This means several features of my site breaks (datepicker won't insert dates etc.) and it's a lot slower.</p>

<p><strong>Is anyone seeing the same? How should I contact Google about this? (Will they even want to fix it?)</strong></p>

<p>To make sure that it's not something in my scripts making Chrome incompatible, I've run an extremely simple page and asked it to be run in NATIVE sandbox mode. It doesn't work in Chrome 29+.</p>

<p>I've installed Chrome 28 via a portableapps package, and it does support NATIVE mode.</p>

"3380185","1","3380213","","2010-07-31 23:31:07","","0","778","<p>I have a database of song titles. Each song title has an assigned integer score. The higher the score the higher it ranks on my website.</p>

<p>So if ""Lady Gaga - Poker Face"" has a score of 23039, and ""Eminem - Not Afraid"" has a score of 13400, Lady Gaga will be above Eminem.</p>

<p>This is of course accomplished by a simple ORDER BY score DESC</p>

<p>However, my website also has a search function where people may input a keyword phrase to return a list of song titles. I do this with a MATCH() AGAINST() query like so:</p>

<p><strong>Method #1</strong></p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM links MATCH(songtitle) AGAINST({the keyword}) LIMIT 5';
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but I want to display these 5 results in order of their score. However, if I perform this query instead:</p>

<p><strong>Method #2</strong></p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM links MATCH(songtitle) AGAINST({the keyword}) ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 5';
</code></pre>

<p>Then the order of relevancy is completely lost. I'm wanting to order the returned results both by score AND by relevance.</p>

<p>Take this example dataset and scenarios:</p>

<p><strong>Data Set:</strong></p>

<pre><code>song title                  |       score
pink - sober                |        2002
pink - funhouse             |        2001
pink floyd - high hopes     |        2000
pink floyd - on the run     |        1999
pink floyd - brain damage   |        1998
pink floyd - money          |        1997
pink floyd - time           |        1996
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Scenarios:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you search for ""Pink Floyd"" using the <strong>first</strong>  method above, you receive 5 Pink Floyd songs in seemingly random order. This is great, <strong>but</strong>, I want the songs that are returned to be ordered by their score in descending order. So you add ""ORDER BY score DESC"" to the first method and that gives you the second method above...</p></li>
<li><p>When you search for ""Pink Floyd"" using the <strong>second</strong> method above, you receive Pink Floyd songs in the proper order (ordered by score DESC), but now you also receive two songs by pop artist ""Pink"", because there are 2 songs in the database by Pink with a higher score than any of the Pink Floyd songs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Desired results:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Searching for ""Pink Floyd"" returns all 5 pink floyd songs, ordered by their assigned score in descending order.</p></li>
<li><p>Searching for ""Pink"" returns the two songs by Pink in the descending order of their assigned score. If Pink Floyd songs showed up after both of the Pink songs, that'd be fine too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>See what I mean? Let me know if you need any clarification!</p>

<p>From the <code>FirstViewController</code> I call the second to appear. When I call it I want to pass data via a delegate.
The delegate protocol is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>protocol CalculationDelegate{
    func calculations(calculation: [Double])
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically it is passing an array of doubles. When A button is clicked on <code>FirstViewController</code> I use  <code>prepareForSegue</code> to get ready for the transition and set up the delegate. </p>

<pre><code>override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
    var secondVC = SecondViewController()
    secondVC = segue.destinationViewController as SecondViewController

    // Set up the delegation, so data is passed to SecondViewController
    self.delegate = SecondViewController()
    self.delegate?.calculations(wage.allCalculations)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now in the <code>SecondViewController</code> I want to access the data I have just passed to be loaded on the <code>UITableView</code>.
Here is the full class declaration of <code>SecondViewController</code></p>

<pre><code>class SecondViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource, CalculationDelegate {

    @IBOutlet
    var tableView: UITableView!
    var calculations: [Double] = []

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.tableView.registerClass(UITableViewCell.self, forCellReuseIdentifier: ""cell"")
    }

    // Conform to CalculationsDelegate by implementing this method
    func calculations(calculation: [Double]) {
        self.calculations = calculation

    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
    }

    func tableView(tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {
        return self.calculations.count
    }

    func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {
        var cell:UITableViewCell = self.tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(""cell"") as UITableViewCell

        cell.textLabel?.text = NSString(format: ""%.2f"", self.calculations[indexPath.row])
        return cell
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I am trying to assign <code>self.calculations = calculation</code> in the delegates method. Then use that as the data to load the <code>UITableView</code> with, however, the data will not load. I have error checked and the data is being passed from the delegate. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I thought it would be a lot better to use ajax to submit the form.</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""com-form"" method=""post""&gt;
    &lt;textarea type=""text"" name=""text"" required=""""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Post""/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id=""com-refresh""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>jQuery</strong>      </p>

<pre><code>$(""#com-form"").on('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    var form      = $(this),
        form_data = form.serialize();
    $.post('/php/comments/add.php', form_data, function(data) {
        $(""#com-refresh"").append(data);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>PHP</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
session_start();
require_once 'comment.class.php';           //require a class with methods
$text = $_POST['text'];
if($_SESSION['status'] == 'loggedin') {
    if(isset($text)) {
        $comment = new Comment();           //initialize the Comment object
        echo $comment-&gt;add_comment($text);  //safe the comment in the database and output it
    } else echo ""Your comment is empty."";
} else echo ""Please log in to post comments."";
</code></pre>

<p>I hope the code is understandable.</p>

<p>Do you think it is smart or a bad practice to use ajax to not refresh the page after submitting a form?</p>

<p>How should it be done? Do you have a better idea, a cleaner solution?</p>

<p>In this code result will be empty because main function calls print method of person class.
What i need is to use polymorphism to call method print of worker.</p>

<p>I could use this:</p>

<p>Code above calls the right method but there is no number attribute in person class. So this wont work either.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me how to properly design my program ? I need to call print function on ancestor class so it would redirect call to right class. This is very simplified example, there are more child-classes so it needs to stay in relation person > worker .</p>

company = Company.create!(params[""company""])
company.workers.each do |worker|
  puts ""worker = #{worker.attributes}""
end

<p>This outputs the following:</p>

<pre><code>worker = {""_id""=&gt;BSON::ObjectId('4e8c126b1d41c85333000002'), ""hours""=&gt;50, ""_type""=&gt;""Manager"", ""workable_id""=&gt;BSON::ObjectId('4e8c126b1d41c85333000001'), ""workable_type""=&gt;""Company""}

<pre><code>attr_accessible :order

<p>is commented in I instead get the following:</p>

<p>Notice how the hours value is not updated from the default.</p>

The legend can have between 1 and 40 items whose length will be between 4 and 32 characters. My goal is to center the plot and the legend as if it was one object on the matplotlib ""sheet"" (or rather empty whitespace).</p>

<p>I found the following and adjusted it to my needs:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(10)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.subplot(111, polar=True)

for ap in aps:
    ax.plot(angles, ap, label=""----------32-Characters---------"")

# Shrink current axis by 20%
box = ax.get_position()
ax.set_position([box.x0, box.y0, box.width * 0.8, box.height])

# Put a legend to the right of the current axis
ax.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))

plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is it doesn't adjust for the length of the labels. Everything perfectly fits when the labels are 4-8 characters long but as it does just shrink the plot by 20 % as soon as 32 character long string appear, they are cut off!</p>

<p><strong>What I want</strong> is the plot + legend as one object centered on the sheet/page/empty whitespace, so that when there is a long label the plot is just offset a little bit more to the left in order to compensate for it.
I hope you got my point of what I am trying to do :)</p>

As far as I know  (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2899073/basicoptional-false-vs-columnnullable-false-in-jpa"">@Basic(optional = false) vs @Column(nullable = false) in JPA</a>)  @Basic(optional=false) should be checked at runtime and @Column(nullable=false) should be used to make column nonnullable in the database.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a method to display violations with out catching ConstraintViolations everywhere.</p>

<p>openshift.com provides me a WSGI, so I embed my <code>cherrypy</code> to it, so that my <code>wsgi.py</code>script define an <code>application</code> object.
Also, <code>cherrypy</code> has a websocket tool, as defined by <code>ws4py</code>.</p>

<p>This is a minimal cherrypy application that works under WSGI in OpenShift, and that <em>should</em> use websockets too!</p>

<pre><code>import cherrypy
from ws4py.server.cherrypyserver import WebSocketPlugin, WebSocketTool
from ws4py.websocket import EchoWebSocket
import atexit
import logging

# see http://tools.cherrypy.org/wiki/ModWSGI
cherrypy.config.update({'environment': 'embedded'}) 
if cherrypy.__version__.startswith('3.0') and cherrypy.engine.state == 0:
    cherrypy.engine.start(blocking=False)
    atexit.register(cherrypy.engine.stop)

class Root(object):
    def index(self): return 'I work!'
    def ws(self): print('THIS IS NEVER PRINTED :(')
    index.exposed=True
    ws.exposed=True

# registering the websocket
conf={'/ws':{'tools.websocket.on': True,'tools.websocket.handler_cls': EchoWebSocket}}
WebSocketPlugin(cherrypy.engine).subscribe()
cherrypy.tools.websocket = WebSocketTool()  

#show stacktraces in console (for some reason this is not default in cherrypy+WSGI)
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
stream = logging.StreamHandler()
stream.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.addHandler(stream)

application = cherrypy.Application(Root(), script_name='', config=conf)
</code></pre>

<p>Everything work wonderfully, except when I create a websocket ( connecting to <code>ws://myserver:8000/ws</code> ), this is the stacktrace I get:</p>

<pre><code> cherrypy/_cplogging.py, 214, HTTP Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>(I manually deleted the absolute path from the filenames)
PS: I use <code>python3.3</code>, <code>cherrypy==3.5.0</code>, <code>ws4py==0.3.4</code>.</p>

<p>It is not clear to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>if this is a lack of compatibility between cherrypy and ws4py when in an WSGI environment.</li>
<li>if it is a problem of ws4py when in a WSGI environment</li>
<li>if it is because Openshift websockets have a different port than the http one</li>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4775618/httpclient-4-0-1-how-to-release-connection"">This article</a> seems the most relevant, as it talks about consuming (closing) connections, which ties in the response. That article is also out of date, as consumeContent is deprecated. It seems that response.close() is the proper way, but that closes the connection and a new response creates a new connection.</p>

<p>It seems that I need to somehow create one response to the serer daemon and then change action (get, post, put, or delete).</p>

Because I want my Publisher to notify its subscribers with events that are different (e.g. not just a string, but a specific class), I have decided to use templates. My code is compiling fine, except that part that I don't know where to store all these Observers. If I use and std::list or std::vector, they will not allow to store specialized data, because their elements have to be the same. So my question is, how do I store all those observers in my Publisher class. Here is my code:</p>

template &lt;class T&gt;
class Observer
{
    protected:

};

    void NotifyObservers();

    template &lt;class T&gt;

    template &lt;class T&gt;

But that is because I'm unfamiliar with cutting edge ASP.net and even less with this behemoth called Sharepoint. So please bear with me..</p>

<ul>
<li>First off is it possible to take functional custom WPF controls which contain certain unmanaged subcomponents that do DirectX rendering (for performance reasons) and drop it into ASP.Net? as an example consider a specialized chart control</li>
<li>Does Sharepoint add anything that makes this possible ? </li>
</ul>

<p>The use-case is to take certain panes or areas from a thick WPF client and slot it into an existing Sharepoint based solution.</p>

<p>Is this possible or are they (WPF Controls and Web Controls) as different as chalk and cheese? (Assume that the current control interface can be freely changed.) Would it wise to develop web-aware stripped down version of these controls than to attempt to hammer the current controls in somehow... </p>

<p>On a fundamental level, can a web-page contain a control which takes over the rendering for its client-area/rectange ? Or does everything have to broken down into plain html by the time it hits the browser.</p>

<p>I found a few unanswered queries online. But other than that its unexplored (or forbidden).. in either case I'd like to know. Thanks for reading..</p>
