<p>I installed the VS11 beta last night, and am using that to work on the web site today. I did NOT change the web site to be .NET 4.5, it is still 4.0. </p>

<p>I have a number of custom libraries which I've written, and use in most of my projects (db access, LINQ extensions, etc.). I have them all <code>&lt;system.web&gt;&lt;pages&gt;&lt;namespaces&gt;&lt;add/&gt;</code>ed in the <code>web.config</code> of my project so that I don't need to put an <code>Import</code> line at the top of every file where I want to use things from them.</p>

<p>This all works fine and as expected in VS2010, and in VS11 it all works fine, ... <strong><em>EXCEPT</em></strong> for one single exception. ONE and ONLY one of my custom libraries, when I have it included in the <code>web.config</code>, the design-time compiler outputs an error message to the Error List window stating: </p>

<p><code>Error: The namespace 'MyLibraries.LIB' is not a valid identifier.</code></p>

<p>All my other libraries continue to work fine, just as they did in VS2010. I thought maybe there was an invisible character embedded in the file or something, so took out the whole <code>&lt;add/&gt;</code> line for that namespace and retyped it from scratch. No joy. I've also tried removing the DLL (and associated files) from the <code>bin</code> directory and re-adding them, also with no change. </p>

<p>HINT:  No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.</p>

<p>I had looked for info at this forum and others and tryed solutions like adding casts :: character varying or giving solutions like:</p>

<p>I have a list that has 1 checkbox for each item on the list. Once i select multiple items for deletion, i will allow users to press a button called DELETE SELECTION.

<p>So how should i cater for deleting multiple items in a RESTFUL way?</p>

<p>NOTE, currently for DELETE in a webpage, what i do is i use FORM tag with POST as action but include a _method with the value DELETE since <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2391792/is-restful-meant-for-web-services-only-or-for-both-web-services-and-web-pages"">this is what was indicated by others in SO on how to do RESTful delete for webpage</a>.</p>

<p>I use the value from the <code>MediaStore.Audio.Media.DATA</code> column if it starts with <code>content://</code>, otherwise I call <code>MediaStore.Audio.Media.getContentUriForPath(c.getString(MediaStore.Audio.Media.DATA))</code> and if the result from that begins with <code>content://</code> I use that value.</p>

<p>The collection in question is <code>List&lt;ItemBase&gt;</code> which can contain <code>FlightItem</code> or <code>CarHireItem</code> objects.</p>

<p>This is my version of the Create() method for JSON.NET:</p>

<pre><code>protected override ItemBase Create(Type objectType, JObject jsonObject)
        {
            var itemType = jsonObject[""Type""].ToString();
            switch (itemType)
            {
                case ""flight"":
                    return new FlightItem();
                case ""carhire"":
                    return new CarHireItem();
                default: 
                    return null;
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Is that possible with ServiceStack?</p>

<p>Serialization and deserialization in ServiceStack for polymorphic collections works, however, it appends the object type to the JSON output, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>""__type"" : ""TestProject.Model.FlightItem, TestProject""
</code></pre>

<p>This means that I need to supply the type when posting JSON and I'm not too keen on having the .NET type visible for anyone within the API calls.</p>

<p>Any suggestions? If it's possible to do this in a different way, can you point me to some examples?</p>

<p>I'm using PAPI v4.1.3.0 which uses the AMD native events CPU_CLK_UNHALTED for PAPI_TOT_CYC(counting total cycles) and DATA_CACHE_ACCESSES for PAPI_L1_DCA (counting L1 data cache accesses).</p>

<p>The problems I've been experiencing is that the number of cache accesses have been higher than the total number of cycles in some cases. A cache access does not halt the cpu, to my understanding, so it should fit within the total cycles. Also when dividing the total cycles by the clock frequency of the Opteron 6172 I get a pretty accurate estimate of the execution time, which makes me think that the total cycles is ok and the problem has to be with the counting of the data cache accesses.</p>

<p>I've initiated everything according to the papi examples and dont get any errors what so ever. Any help or reason to why this can occur is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I would like to retrieve an item from a .NET <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb359438.aspx""><code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. I'm looking for a method that would have this signature:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Determines if this set contains an item equal to &lt;paramref name=""item""/&gt;, 
/// according to the comparison mechanism that was used when the set was created. 
/// The set is not changed. If the set does contain an item equal to 
/// &lt;paramref name=""item""/&gt;, then the item from the set is returned.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
bool TryGetItem&lt;T&gt;(T item, out T foundItem);

<p>Searching the set for an item with such a method would be O(1). The only way to retrieve an item from a <code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code> is to enumerate all items which is O(n).</p>

<p>I haven't find any workaround to this problem other then making my own <code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code> or use a <code>Dictionary&lt;K, V&gt;</code>. Any other idea?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
I don't want to check if the <code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code> contains the item. I want to get the reference to the item that is stored in the <code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code> because I need to update it (without replacing it by another instance). The item I would pass to the <code>TryGetItem</code> would be equal (according to the comparison mechanism that I've passed to the constructor) but it would not be the same reference.</p>

<p>I am new to GTK+ programming and am having difficulty understanding why the following does not block. </p>

<pre><code>if self.journal:
    # Pump GTK messages.
    while gtk.events_pending(): gtk.main_iteration()
</code></pre>

<p>According to the PyGtk reference on <code>gtk.main_iteration()</code>, the default value for <code>block</code> is <code>True</code>, which should, seemingly, prevent the local code from running until events have been processed.</p>

<p>Yet, I don't see this happening.  Perhaps, a clue is in the <code># Pump GTK messages.</code> comment.  But I don't understand what the comment is trying to convey to me.</p>

<p><strong>My Question</strong></p>

<p>So, my question is <strong><em>What does it mean to ""Pump GTK messages?""</em></strong>  Please be as low-level as possible.  I understand that GTK is my widget toolkit and is designed to handle events.</p>

Basically, I have a class that has two ways that it can be compared depending on how you interpret it so I created a new class that derives from the base class and only has new constructors (that just delegate to the base class) and a new <code>operator==</code>.  What I'd like to do is overload the <code>operator Base&amp;()</code> in the Derived class so in cases where I need to interpret it as the Base. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Base
{
  Base(stuff);
  Base(const Base&amp; that);
  bool operator==(Base&amp; rhs); //typical equality test
};

class Derived : public Base
{
  Derived(stuff) : Base(stuff) {};
  Derived(const Base&amp; that) : Base(that) {};
  Derived(const Derived&amp; that) : Base(that) {};
  bool operator==(Derived&amp; rhs); //special case equality test
  operator Base&amp;()
  {
    return (Base&amp;)*this;  //Is this OK?  It seems wrong to me.
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>If you want a simple example of what I'm trying to do, pretend I had a String class and <code>String==String</code> is the typical character by character comparison.  But I created a new class <code>CaseInsensitiveString</code> that did a case insensitive compare on <code>CaseInsensitiveString==CaseInsensitiveString</code> but in all other cases just behaved like a String.  it doesn't even have any new data members, just an overloaded <code>operator==</code>.  (Please, don't tell me to use std::string, this is just an example!)</p>

<p>Am I going about this right?  Something seems fishy, but I can't put my finger on it.</p>

I do not know what is the difference between below two sentences in the view:</p>

<pre><code>@model MyProject.SampleModel.CustomModels
@using MyProject.SampleModel;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My model:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Namespace MyProject.SampleModel
{
     public class ViewModelExample {

   }

   public class SecondModel
   {
     public string FirstName { get; set; }
     public string LastName { get; set; }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Second, I have a problem when checking one of the checkboxes of the view: it seems like the model it's not being updated correctly or is updated and value overwritten in some point because i have a javascript function that checks the state of this checkbox once I press a button of the view and it does some stuff depending on whether it is checked or not. WHen I get this value from the javascript function it is always false even if i have checked it. I do not know what is happening, maybe I am not initializing my model in the correct way, etc.</p>

There are only two tables.  I need values for all rows from Table1, regardless of matches in Table2, but the WHERE clause uses fields from Table2.  In SQL, the two parameters would be Table2WhereColumn1 and Table2WhereColumn2, and the query (which works) looks like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT t1.Table1Id,
    t1.FieldDescription,

WHERE (t2.Table2WhereColumn1 = @someId OR t2.Table2WhereColumn1 IS NULL)
AND (t2.Table2WhereColumn2 = @someOtherId OR t2.Table2WhereColumn2 IS NULL)
ORDER BY t1.OrderByColumn

<p>I've tried using <code>Group Join</code> with <code>DefaultIfEmpty()</code>, as well as an implicit join (without the actual <code>Join</code> keyword), and I only get rows for items that have values in Table2.

<p>The identifier value is held in a <code>NSMutableArray</code> serving as a registry. This is how I implement the registry.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)addOperation:(NSOperation *)operation withID:(NSString*)operationID 
{
    @synchronized(self.queueReference) 
    {
        [self.queueReference addObject:operationID]; // &lt;-- just a mutable array

            [self.queueReference removeObject:operationID];
        }
    }];

    [self addOperation:operation];  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I am adding a completion block which is cleaning the registry when that particular operation has finished.</p>

<p>However, while this works, I am in need to add more granularity to the queue.</p>

<p>I only use the queue with block operation, and during the execution of the block I may send different <code>NSNotification</code> to the listener depending how the execution went. </p>

<p>What I was trying to achieve:</p>

<p>A caller try to add a particular <code>NSBlockOperation</code> with identifier to queue. If queue already has such identifier just don't add block, and the calling class set itself as listener.</p>

<p>What is missing ? Checking for the identifier is not enough, there may be case when the <code>NSBlockOperation</code> already dispatched the <code>NSNotification</code> but the completion block has not yet being called. </p>

<p>So the caller class ask the queue, which is saying the identifier exists in registry, and caller wrongly set itself for listening to a notification that will never arrive because it's already being sent.</p>

<p>The scenario would be instead: caller ask the queue, which is saying 'identifier is in registry' but <code>NSNotification</code> is sent. And the caller put <code>NSBlockOperation</code> to queue.</p>

<p>The check of registry is made by means of a simple method:</p>

<pre><code>-(BOOL)hasOperationWithID:(NSString*)operationID 
{
    @synchronized(self.queueReference) 
    {
        return [self.queueReference containsObject:operationID];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but at this point I have not much idea on how to extend such method. The code I am working on is kind of 'academic', it does not serve any particular purpose, it is just me trying to experiment. Therefore I have great flexibility within the code. But this is quite new subject to me, so please be as much specific as possible of any downside of suggested implementation.</p>

 1. I need to keep the communication channel open while the client is consuming the video due to manage client disconnection to stop the streaming.

<p>This can be culminated in two ways :
1) At the third level I provide a link to search results page (the same a end user would see) 
2) I simple list  links of listed entities  in the sitemap itself along with relevant info( which would be additional content for the bot to determine the links relevance) </p>

I'm at the stage now where they need to see a programming example, and they gave me the task of implementing a random number generator service in Java, with two different implementations (one using the built-in stuff and another of my choice). The code is the easy part, but one part of the task is confusing me... here it is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the evaluator, I should be able to do the following:
  Compile my own project with the candidates jar file.
  Register my solution with the candidates executable jar.
  Run the candidates executable jar, somehow telling it to run my implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically I'm making my code into an executable .jar, and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>evaluators should be able to use the code and compiled classes developed by the candidate to plug in their own random number generator implementation without recompiling the candidate’s code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the heck does that mean? Maybe I'm just missing something obvious? I'm not sure how to allow them to just throw in their own implementation without having to recompile everything... hopefully it's not too big of a task, as I haven't heard of something like that (I think) at my University.</p>

<p>Any help/insight is really appreciated!</p>

<p>Unless I'm missing something (certainly possibly as I'm new to Laravel!) I can do this using getCurrentRoute()->getPath(). But I have to do this from the form, because when I try to do it in a Controller it does not have the old route any more. So, I created a hidden field on my form like so:</p>

<pre><code>{{ Form::hidden('route', '{{{Route::getCurrentRoute()-&gt;getPath()}}}') }};

<p>However, the ""getCurrentRoute()->getPath()"" is never evaluated properly. The form field literally prints it out:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know a way to get this to work, or is there a better way to do this that I'm totally missing? Again, I can't insert this into a controller like normal because at that point the route has been sent to </p>

<pre><code>// Search
Route::post('search', array('as' =&gt; 'search', 'uses' =&gt; 'SearchController@postSearch'), function(){

<p>I'm not sure how I should load the bitmaps and binding the textures. For example, I could load them in the <code>onSurfaceCreated()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>public void onSurfaceCreated(GL10 gl, EGLConfig config){    
     ...
     Bitmap background = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(mContext.getResources(), R.drawable.background, null);
     gl.glGenTextures(1, backgroundTextureArray, 0);
     gl.glBindTexture(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_2D, backgroundTextureArray[0]);
     gl.glTexParameterf(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL10.GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL10.GL_LINEAR);
     gl.glTexParameterf(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL10.GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL10.GL_LINEAR);
     GLUtils.texImage2D(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_2D,0, background,0);
}

<p>However, I believe this would mean that every time the wallpaper become visible, it would have to load the images into memory again. This doesn't seem like a good idea in general considering the wallpaper will go in and out of view often.</p>

<p>Is there another way to setup the textures? I'm not sure what happens when a program is running and needs extra memory. If the LWP can be killed, then maybe I can store the bitmaps permanently whilst the wallpaper service is alive?</p>

<p>Let me be more specific. The Credential parameter in almost all cmdlets is a PSCredential Object. But, the argument can be either a PSCredential Object or, a String Object with the username.</p>

<pre><code>[CmdletBinding()]
param ([Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
       [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]
       $Credential)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem comes when passing a string. Of course, an argument transformation on the parameter cannot be done. Cannot convert the type ""System.String"" into a type PSCrendential.</p>

<p>Please, could anyone assist me on this.</p>

I wanted it to be something that (I thought would be simple) that had a login box, and when you logged in, if you used either my login or my teacher's login in it would work, and it would either create the buttons or redirect to another page that had the buttons on them, but for some reason the if else statement I am using for the login(since it there are only two instances in which it would be true is not wanting to work. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I am still learning Javascript and only understand enough of it to teach some of the very basic parts of it. (which is all that I need to atm) All I am trying to do is make the buttons appear so that I can then use them to call the functions that create the information that is written out when they are clicked. So for example, to create the buttons when the correct login information is given and then when the buttons that appear show up, you could click the first one and the paragraph about the script tag would appear. </p>

<p><strong>There is not much trouble with the password and name check functions working, when I make them both alerts, the first being eeyup if it is right and nnope if the info given is wrong, both of them work. It is only when I try to use document.write that I run into issues</strong></p>

<p>*<em>At the moment, what it does is the buttons flash up on the screen for a split second then disappears and the login boxes/screen reappears. *</em> </p>

<p>The login function I am using is:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
function validator(){
    var name = document.KageForm.User.value;
    var password= document.KageForm.pass.value;
    if(password==""mypassword"" &amp;&amp; name==""myusername""|| password==""myteacherspassword"" &amp;&amp;name==""myteachersname"" ){
  document.write(showbuttons());
} else {
    document.write(""This is not meant for you to see."");
}}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The function to show the buttons, showbuttons, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function showbuttons(){
    document.write(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;input type=\""button\"" value=\""Starting Your Script\"" onclick=\""FirstThingsFirst()\""/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=\""button\"" value=\""Learn about document.write\"" onclick=\""writing()\"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input  type=\""button\"" value=\""Variables\""onclick=\""settingVariables()\"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=\""button\"" value=\""Using Functions\"" onclick=\""usingFunctions()\"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=\""button\"" value=\""If Statements\"" onclick=\""usingIfStatements()\"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=\""button\"" value=\""Else Statements\"" onclick=\""usingElseStatements()\"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=\""button\"" value=\""Return to Login\"" onclick=\""homepage()\"" /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"")

Name your button something like, 'start trolling' or something like that. So, your code for your input should look something like &lt;i&gt;&lt;-input type=\""button\"" value=\""Starting Your Script\"" onclick=\""FirstThingsFirst()\""/&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br/&gt; obviously minus the dash at the start of the tag.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;input type=\""button\"" value=\""Commence Trolling\"" onclick=\""troll()\""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;input type=\""button\"" value=\""Return to Home\"" onclick=\""homepage()\"" /&gt;"");

I have a quite complex MVC driven application. </p>

<p>Here how it works:</p>

<li>/mvc2 - (/mvc2/dispatcher.php as mvc2 app bootstrap)</li>
<li>/mvc3 - (/mvc3/dispatcher.php as mvc3 app bootstrap)</li>
</ol>

<p>all 3 are accesible under one domain example.com then </p>

<ol>
<li>example.com/ - is 1st MVC application</li>
<li>example.com/mvc2 - is 2nd application </li>
<li>example.com/mvc3 is a 3rd application.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far everything is working nicely on .htaccess files (in each mvc folder) which have following code inside:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule !\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css|htc|swf|html|xml)$ dispatcher.php
</code></pre>

<p>code is correct my problem is that I would like to move it into vhost.conf file or httpd.conf which is loaded into memory at Apache startup and get rid of all .httaccess to boost up Apache performance.</p>

<p>the current solutions its working correctly because each .htaccess is overwritting its parent directory one, which I can't have to working in vhost.conf</p>

<p>So far I have tried to move it into  directive but without success. Any ideas ?</p>

<p>many thanks for help.</p>

<p>The bug is that the form is just working with the enter key when I'm using this code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""submit""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""submit"" class=""submit"" value=""Submit""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which I would like to use because this is the code for a button and the other is just for the enter key.</p>

<p>Is something wrong with the connected script? I'm new to JavaScript.</p>

Doing that gave me a handy URL having all the collected data in a JSON, through which I could dynamically load latest collected survey data in my application. See screenshot.
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/35lL4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/35lL4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As an example, all entries <a href=""https://fddmk.enketo.formhub.org/webform"" rel=""nofollow"">submitted on this form</a> (and its ODK Collect counterpart), were collecting <strong><a href=""http://bamboo.io/datasets/f3facf491ae649d3a6c4162c16a89304"" rel=""nofollow"">at this URL in JSON format</a></strong> which I could then import into my javascript and do mapping, data visualization, etc.</p>

<p>I'm using formhub's successor, <strong>ona.io</strong> now because formhub.org isn't loading half the time, and I read in some article that they don't intend to keep it up and one should go to ona.io now to do the same thing. It's the same thing (at much better speed, I can see that formhub.org was having server problems), But it's <em>missing the easy bamboo.io integration</em>. There is a ""REST Services"" tab mentioned below in the form's dashboard..</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ODSTK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ODSTK.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>..that I can't make sense out of. What am I supposed to enter as ""service URL"" ? </p>

<p>I tried looking up ona.io's documentation but it's all for API and involved CURL commands etc. I'm checking out bamboo.io and even there I'm not getting any help. Everywhere they're going into advanced usage of custom servers, API's CURL GET etc. But I just want the simple live JSON data through a simple link <a href=""http://bamboo.io/datasets/f3facf491ae649d3a6c4162c16a89304"" rel=""nofollow"">that I was getting in formhub</a>.</p>

<p>I'm open to any other methods if available.. the end goal is to have a URL that carries all the accumulated data submitted by the form in JSON or CSV format. I want to import JSON (or CSV) from this set URL in my javascript on a web page hosted on my own server. </p>

<p>Note that it's not possible for me to self-host an ODK Aggregate instance. Ona.io is doing that for me.</p>

<p>In the traditional way of exporting data at ona.io (and formhub before it), the system creates a new file each time you export, with a timestamped file name. It doesn't auto-generate any single URL having latest data.. one has to go there and generate manually. That won't do... need a fixed URL which will have all latest data JSON or CSV.</p>

<p>I want to serialize/deserialize this to a slightly simpler, flattened format:</p>

<p>That works fine when <em>reading</em> the data, but when writing only the last ""data"" value (<code>bar</code>) exists in the output JSON, presumably because the <code>data</code> object is being overwritten for each subsequent value:</p>

<pre><code>{
   ""id"" : ""id-1"",
   ""data"":{
     ""bar"":""teststr2""
   }
 }

<p>Is there a correct way to do this flattening and unflattening, without resorting to separate <code>Reads</code> and <code>Writes</code> objects? My actual data structures are quite large (although not too complex) so conciseness is good.</p>

<p>I have a project which consists of a client and a server.  The server connects to a database and the client can call the methods in the server through the wsdl file.  This works fine, but the server can only return simple types and lists.  I looked up how to handle custom types, and I was directed to JaxB, which seems to be exactly what I'm looking for.  Unfortunately I'm a little confused as to how I'm supposed to use it.  I'm using the NetBeans IDE (6.9.1), which makes it easier to deal with the wsdl files, although I have read that passing complex classes is fairly trivial from the command line, once you've got the wsdl end of things working properly?</p>

<p>What I want to do is to have the server return a class - it'll just contain data - that the client can read and use.</p>

<p>I've done the following, but obviously I'm going wrong somewhere!</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a class, called Customer on the server side which is constructed and returned when a particular method is called by the client.</li>
<li>The client obviously cannot interpret this class correctly.</li>
<li>I've used schemagen to create an XML schema from the Customer class.  I then use the netbeans wizard to bind the schema to a class in the client.</li>
<li>I suppose this is where I'm confused.  I want to unmarshall the xml response from the server and use it to create a new object on the client.  I'm using the ""jaxbu"" netbeans shortcut which expands into some code, but I'm unsure of how to put the returning object into the unmarshaller.  If that makes any sense?</li>
</ul>

<p>The code generated by ""jaxbu"" is similar to below, inside a try block:</p>

<pre><code>javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext jaxbCtx = javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext.newInstance(c.getClass().getPackage().getName());
javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jaxbCtx.createUnmarshaller();
c = (CustomerInfo) unmarshaller.unmarshal(new java.io.File(""File path""));

Most scripts work fine for us, but as soon as we try to use System.Numerics, we get ""error CS0234: The type or namespace name `Numerics' does not exist in the namespace System.""</p>

<p>This isn't too surprising, and should be fixable with an appropriate command-line option to mcs, plus properly set up PKG_CONFIG_PATH... but this is where we get stumped.  First, here's the script so you can follow along at home:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Numerics;

public static class MainProgram {
    public static void Main(string[] args) {
        Console.WriteLine(""Hello world!"");
    }
}

<p>So next we tried ""mcs -r:System.Numerics Test.cs"".  This produces ""error CS0006: Metadata file `System.Numerics' could not be found"".</p>

<p>""man mcs"" suggests that we can get the other system packages by adding ""-pkg:dotnet"" to the command line.  But that produces:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Package dotnet was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps
  you should add the directory containing `dotnet.pc' to the
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable No package 'dotnet' found error
  CS8027: Error running pkg-config. Check the above output.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK then, we had no PKG_CONFIG_PATH, so we tried defining one:</p>

<pre><code>export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/pkgconfig/
</code></pre>

<p>This fixes the CS8027; but we still get the CS0234 we started with.  And if I combine the -pkg and the -r, e.g. ""mcs -pkg:dotnet -r:System.Numerics Test.cs"", I get ""error CS0006: Metadata file `System.Numerics' could not be found"".</p>

<p>Games need to have an ""Update"" function that updates the state of the world -- physics, processing of input and more. The point is, the gtk main loop is blocking - I can't override it. But I can connect a timer signal (using signal_timeout) and set it to repeat every 0 milliseconds with max priority -- this is for my Update method.
This is what I'm talking about: <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/glibmm/stable/classGlib_1_1SignalTimeout.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.gnome.org/glibmm/stable/classGlib_1_1SignalTimeout.html</a></p>

<p>Is this an acceptable way to do this? Any other better way? Or isn't gtk supposed to be used like this?</p>

<p>Another way I had in mind was to have a separate thread to run the Update function. But then I will need to synchronize the threads using a mutex which adds overhead and possibly unnecessary complexity.</p>

<p>1, I created the InputChannel and OutputChannel and let the TransportBindingElement return them.</p>

<p>2, I created a contract interface, which has two methods. One has the attribute said IsOneWay = true, let's say it's Method1; the other was not which named Method2.</p>

<p>3, If I invoked Method1, I can see that it gave me a RequestChannel and ReplyChannel instead of InputChannel and OutputChannel. And the reply channel can receive the WCF message and return the RequestContext back. But the service code was not invoked.</p>

<p>4, If I set IsOneWay = false on Method1, it works well.</p>

<p>4, If I invoked Method2, it works well.</p>

<p>5, I created another service contract which have only one method with IsOneWay = true. If I invoked this method WCF gave me InputChannel and OutputChannel, and it works well (service code executed).</p>

<p>So my question is:
1, If I have a service with IsOneWay = true methods and IsOneWay = false methods, the WCF will give me request-reply channel, is that correct?</p>

<p>2, How can I handle the service invoke, which the method was IsOneWay = true, but also has IsOneWay = false methods in the same service contract?</p>

<p>BTW, I noticed that for the request messages to the IsOneWay = true method, the MessageID was NULL. I set a new ID to the request message but no luck, the service code still wasn't invoked.</p>

Since my web version uses CSS, I was able to customize the color palette, even though the UI was designed to imitate a native iPhone UI.  I'd like to use a similar color scheme for my native app, but it doesn't seem so easy out of the box.  I've gone through a couple tutorials and played around a bit with <strong>Interface Builder</strong>, inspecting the individual settings available for each control.  My biggest questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it possible to (or how do I) change the color of a <strong>Round Rect Button</strong>?</li>
<li>Is it possible to (or how do I) change the color of cells in a <strong>Table View</strong>?</li>

- Mock out required modules
- Accessing private variables and functions</p>

<p>I was able to use the technique described here (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9563983/testing-node-js-mock-out-and-test-a-module-that-has-been-required"">Testing Node.js, mock out and test a module that has been required?</a>) and here (<a href=""http://howtonode.org/testing-private-state-and-mocking-deps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://howtonode.org/testing-private-state-and-mocking-deps</a>) to resolve those 2 issues above.</p>

<p>However, I am facing another one :
- I need to be able to mock out properties or functions with my own custom implementations. How do I go about doing that ?</p>

<p>For example :</p>

<p><strong>platform.js :</strong></p>

<pre><code>    function add(hooksRunner, projectRoot, targets, opts) {
        var msg;
        if ( !targets || !targets.length ) {
            msg = 'No platform specified. Please specify a platform to add. ' +
                  'See `' + cordova_util.binname + ' platform list`.';
            return Q.reject(new CordovaError(msg));
        }

        for(var i= 0 ; i&lt; targets.length; i++){
            if ( !hostSupports(targets[i]) ) {
                msg = 'Applications for platform ' + targets[i] +
                      ' can not be built on this OS - ' + process.platform + '.';
                return Q.reject( new CordovaError(msg));
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>platform.spec.js :</strong></p>

<pre><code>    it('throws if target incompatible with os', function (done) {
            // Arrange
            var loadModule = require('./module_loader).loadModule;
            targets = ['android', 'ios'];
            opts = {};
            var projectRoot = ''; 
            var hooksRunner = undefined; 

            platform = loadModule('./platform.js'); // Code under test

            platform.process = { platform: 'linux' };

            hostSupports = function (plat) {
                return (plat === 'android') ? true : false;
            }
            debugger;

            // Act
            var promise = platform.add(hooksRunner, projectRoot, targets, opts);

            // Assert
            promise.fail(function (error) {
                expect(error.message).toBe(""Applications for platform ios can not be built on this OS - win32."");
                done();
            });
        })
</code></pre>

<p>What happens when stepping through the code is that inside platform.js, there are two versions of the function ""hostSupports"" : one in the global scope and another one in the 'this' scope.
and the function add uses the one in the global scope. </p>

<p>How do I make the add code use my custom ""hostSupports"" ?</p>

"15902898","1","15930036","","2013-04-09 13:12:28","","6","5565","<p>I have a C++ server and two clients (ruby and java).
Everything is running on a 64-bit linux-machine (java 1.7.0_17)
The ruby client is fully working, but the java version makes problems.</p>

<p>In Java I tried to send a String from the client to the server. Actually the Server received the entire String, but the server thinks there is still something more to receive.</p>

<p>The ruby client looks a little bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>socket = TCPSocket.open(@options[:host],@options[:port])
test = ""Hello, World""
socket.puts test
socket.shutdown 1
response = socket.gets
</code></pre>

<p>Everything here is working fine. The ruby client sends a string. The server receives that string and sends a reply.</p>

<p>The Java Version looks like:</p>

<pre><code>String ip = ""127.0.0.1"";
int port = 6686;
java.net.Socket socket = new java.net.Socket(ip,port);
OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());

String msg = ""Hello, world!"";

//send
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(out, true);
pw.print(msg);
pw.flush();
// I also tried: out.write(msg); out.flush(); nothing changed

//receive the reply
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(in);
char[] buffer = new char[300];
int count = br.read(buffer, 0, 300);
String reply = new String(buffer, 0, count);
System.out.println(reply);

socket.close();
</code></pre>

<p>On the other side there is a C++ Server:</p>

<pre><code>string receive(int SocketFD) {
   char buffer[SOCKET_BUFFER_SIZE];
   int recv_count;

   // empty messagestring
   string message = """";

   // empty buffer
   memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));

   while ((recv_count = recv(SocketFD, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0)) &gt; 0) {
      /*if (recv_count == -1) {
         cout &lt;&lt; ""failed."" &lt;&lt; endl;
         break;
      }*/
      cout &lt;&lt; recv_count &lt;&lt; endl;
      if (ECHO_SOCKETS) cout &lt;&lt; ""received: "" &lt;&lt; buffer &lt;&lt; endl;

      message.append(buffer);
      memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));

      if (ECHO_SOCKETS) cout &lt;&lt; ""message is now: "" &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt; endl;

   }
   return message;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The server output from the Java-message is:</p>

<pre><code>13
received: Hello, world!
message is now: Hello, world!
</code></pre>

<p>and then nothing happens.
The problem is that:</p>

<pre><code>recv(SocketFD, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>is catched in an endless loop (or something like that).
If I kill the Java-client process or I type something like:</p>

<pre><code>pw.print(msg);
out.close();
</code></pre>

<p>the output on the server side is:</p>

<pre><code>_sending reply: ""Request unrecognized/invalid"" request=""Hello, world!""
send reply success
now close connection
</code></pre>

<p>This output is right (except ""send reply success""), but in case of adding:</p>

<pre><code>out.close();
</code></pre>

<p>the client can't receive the reply of the server. Because the Socket is closed.</p>

<pre><code>java.net.SocketException: Socket is closed
at java.net.Socket.getInputStream(Socket.java:864)
at MyServer.writeMessage(MyServer.java:56)
at MyServer.test(MyServer.java:42)
at MyServer.main(MyServer.java:30)
</code></pre>

<h1><strong>Edit</strong></h1>

<p>I tried to call pw.flush(); and different delimiters like ""\n"", ""\r"", ""\r\n"" and ""\n\r"" but the server still thinks there is still something to read. I also tried to use DatagramSockets:</p>

<pre><code>java.net.DatagramSocket dSocket = new java.net.DatagramSocket();
InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName(""localhost"");
String msg = ""Hello, world!"";
byte[] buf = msg.getBytes();
java.net.DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length, address, 6686);
</code></pre>

<p>But the server can't accept the packet.</p>

<h1><strong>Solution</strong></h1>

<p>The ruby-client does something like a socket.shutdownOutput(); (ruby: socket.shutdown 1) after the call of puts. I changed the java-client-code:</p>

<pre><code>out.write(msg);
socket.shutdownOutput();
</code></pre>

<p>and it works!</p>

<p>As @Charly said: I have to define a ""protocol"". In my case I'm not allowed to change any communication related code (in the server and the ruby-client) because this functionality is used by a another group of researchers. So I've to modify my java-client in that way, that it does the <strong>exact</strong> same things at the <strong>exact</strong> same time as the ruby-client (something like a protocol).</p>

My problem is that there seems to be a delay before the output is read by my program.  If I run the executable on the command line, there is output immediately when it starts running.  But when I run it using my code the ReadOutput event handler isn't called until the Process exits.  I want to use this to provide a real-time view of the process's output, so I don't want to wait (several minutes) until the process exits.</p>

            transform: 'translate(' + (-100 * (current - 1)) + '%, 0)',
            WebkitTransform: 'translate(' + (-100 * (current - 1)) + '%, 0)',
</code></pre>

<p>In the first example (example 1) the jQuery is being used like this:</p>

<pre><code>.css(""transform"",""translateX(""+$(this).index() * -450+""px)"");
</code></pre>

<p>What is the difference between the two and why doesn't the one that works use <code>translateX</code></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

The examples on their website are using and ID as the selector, but that's not possible for me because there are going to be several similar objects that need the ToolTip.</p>

<p><a href=""http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tooltip/any-html.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tooltip/any-html.html</a></p>

<p>The thing is, I need HTML within the ToolTip... I can't just use the ""title"" attribute.</p>

<p>Here is code I'm dealing with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""mycarousel"" class=""jcarousel-skin-tango""&gt;
    &lt;?php $loop = new WP_Query( array( 'post_type' =&gt; 'staff', 'order' =&gt; 'ASC') ); ?&gt;

For one set of data there are two files that contain information about that data, each with the same name. When a file is received, the server sends a message out to my queue containing the file path, file name, ID of the client, and the ""type"" of file it is (all have same file extension but there are two ""types,"" call them A and B).</p>

<p>The two files for one set of data have the same file name. As soon as the server has received both of the files I need to start a program that combines the two. Currently I have something that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>from(""jms:queue.name"").aggregate(header(""CamelFileName"")).completionSize(2).to(""exec://FILEPATH?args="");
</code></pre>

<p>Where I am stuck is the header(""CamelFileName""), and more specifically how the aggregator works.</p>

<p>With the completionSize set to 2 does it just suck up all the messages and store them in some data structure until a second message that matches the first comes through? Also, does the header() expect a specific value? I have multiple clients so I was thinking of having the client ID and the file name in the header, but then again I don't know if I have to give a specific value. I also don't know if I can use a regex or not.</p>

<p>Any ideas or tips would be super helpful.

<p>Now I want to set up the possibility for finding only certain contacts based on the contact's lastName, so I followed the <a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/query-params/"" rel=""nofollow"">official docs for specifying query params</a>.</p>

<p>I've modified my <code>app/routes/contacts/index.js</code> route so that it now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  queryParams: {
    lastName: {
      refreshModel: true
    }
  },
  model: function(params) {
    return this.store.findQuery('contact', params);
  }
});

<p>and <code>app/controllers/contacts.js</code></p>

<pre><code>import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.ArrayController.extend({

  queryParams: ['lastName'],
  lastName: null,

});
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>params</code> isn't filled, even when I specify a query param in the browser. More precisely, the <code>params</code> object looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jloWZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>which doesn't seem to contain anything interesting to me.</p>

<p>Yet, the query params information <em>is</em> somehow propagated to the view, so I feel slightly baffled. How can I have <code>params</code> be filled for the model hook in my route?</p>

<p>It was loaded with those values when I tested couple of days ago, but not working today. When I do <code>rpts.get(i).build.release</code> , it gives <code>nullPointerException</code> because build is null here. This code has not been changed in recent days. Wondering why this is happening. Can someone suggest me whether there is any other setting file (like application.conf) that does this lazy loading. Please help.</p>

Debugging line by line, i noticed that it occurs while i append a String Value to an Array of Doubles. To do that i convert the double using an extension:</p>

<pre><code>extension String {
func toDouble() -&gt; Double? {
    return NSNumberFormatter().numberFromString(self)?.doubleValue
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the crashing line is:</p>

<pre><code>litros.append(temp_litros.toDouble()!) //litros is my array and temp_litros my string

<p>the error:</p>

<pre><code>fatal error: unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value

<li>""why are they asking me to create a new table instead of creating a new column(in User table) which will store a flag(true If user is deleted, else not deleted)</li>
<li>""Is join not time consuming?""</li>
<li>(creating a new column in the current ""User"" table will help in keeping the detail intact with the User.But creating a new table - where this will help?)</li>
</ul>

<p>When I asked this question to my team member, he replied <em>""If you create a new column, the value can be empty for a lot of rows, and space wastage""</em> (what he said is right too.)
<br/><br/>
This states that he is caring about the space more and less on query time.
<br/>
Nowadays we can get any amount of space with money, But speed is more important right. If the speed is less, then what is the use of anything which saves our disk space.
<br/>
Shouldn't we care about time more and space less?.
<br/><br/>
I would like to know what you think about this. What is more important to you and why?.
<br/>
I know this question can be down-voted But I wanted to know what most developers think in such case. What they care about more is it space or time?<br/>
Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Is it possible to draw a line over a layout?</p>

<p>I have an <code>XML file(activity_main)</code> and it contains a layout which is <code>ImageLayout</code> that I took from github. The layout contains an image and several buttons.</p>

<p>What I want to do is to draw a line between two points on the layout. In order to draw a line, people usually create a <code>Draw class</code> and extends <code>View</code>. On the <code>MainActivity</code>, they would <code>setContent</code> the <code>Draw class</code>. I have already <code>setContent</code> my XML file. How would I draw a line from this point?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I heard about the class <code>Path</code>, I think it is better than using onDraw because I would be connecting(drawing lines between) several points in my layout.</p>

<p>Enlighten me about it if you could</p>

<p>I already have the custom view, making the background and borders, but if I make ""width: fill_parent"" and ""height: wrap_content"", it will appear on the top of the screen, and if I put height to fill_parent, the entire screen will be filled with the background (which I kinda knew it would happen).</p>

<p>One of the <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/3060/104"">answers</a> to my question explained the concept of interpolation using linear spline smoothing on the cumulative sum to overcome hiccoughs in binning. I am intrigued by it and want to implement it in R but cannot find any examples online. I do not just want to print plots. I want to get the instantaneous slope at each and every time point (maybe each day) but that slope should be derived from a spline that inputs points from a few days (or perhaps a few weeks or a few months) before to a few days after the time point. In other words, at the end of the day <strong>I want to get something such as a data frame in which one column is money per day</strong> or patients per week but that is not subject to vagaries such as whether I paid a few days late or whether there happened to be 5 operative days in the month (as opposed to the usual 4).</p>

<p>Here is some simplified simulation and plotting to show what I am up against. </p>

<pre><code>library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
dates &lt;- seq(as.Date(""2010-02-01""), length=24, by=""1 month"") - 1
dates[5] &lt;- dates[5]+3 #we are making one payment date that is 3 days late
dates#look how the payment date is the last day of every month except for
#2010-05 where it takes place on 2010-06-03 - naughty boy!
amounts &lt;- rep(50,each=24)# pay $50 every month
register &lt;- data.frame(dates,amounts)#this is the starting register or ledger
ggplot(data=register,aes(dates,amounts))+geom_point()#look carefully and you will see that 2010-05 has no dots in it and 2010-06 has two dots
register.by.month &lt;- ddply(register,.(y=year(dates),month=month(dates)),summarise,month.tot=sum(amounts))#create a summary of totals by month but it lands up omiting a month in which nothing happened. Further badness is that it creates a new dataframe where one is not needed. Instead I created a new variable that allocates each date into a particular ""zone"" such as month or 
register$cutmonth &lt;- as.Date(cut(register$dates, breaks = ""month""))#until recently I did not know that the cut function can handle dates
table(register$cutmonth)#see how there are two payments in the month of 2010-06
#now lets look at what we paid each month. What is the total for each month
ggplot(register, aes(cutmonth, amounts))+ stat_summary(fun.y = sum, geom = ""bar"")#that is the truth but it is a useless truth
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IXY3B.png"" alt=""When one is late with a payment by a couple of days it appears as if the expense was zero in one month and double in the next. That is spurious""></p>

<pre><code>#so lets use cummulated expense over time
register$cumamount &lt;- cumsum(register$amounts)
cum &lt;- ggplot(data=register,aes(dates,cumamount))+geom_point()
cum+stat_smooth()
</code></pre>

amounts.up &lt;- round(amounts*increase,digits=2)#this is the monthly amount with a growth of amount in each month of the second year
register &lt;- cbind(register,amounts.up)#add the variable to the data frarme
register$cumamount.up &lt;- cumsum(register$amounts.up) #work out th cumulative sum for the new scenario

   geom_point(aes(y=amounts, colour=""amounts"",shape=""amounts""))+
   geom_point(aes(y=amounts.up, colour=""amounts.up"",shape=""amounts.up""))# the plot of amount by date
#I am now going to plot the cumulative amount over time but now that I have two scenarios it is easier to deal with the data frame in long format (melted) rather than wide format (casted)
#before I can melt, the reshape2 package unforutnately can't handle date class so will have to turn them int o characters and then back again.
register[,c(""dates"",""cutmonth"")] &lt;- lapply(register[,c(""dates"",""cutmonth"")],as.character)
register.long &lt;- melt.data.frame(register,measure.vars=c(""amounts"",""amounts.up""))

cum &lt;- ggplot(data=register,aes(dates,cumamount))+geom_point()
#that is the truth but it is a useless truth. Furthermore it appears as if 2010-06 is similar to what is going on in 2011-12
#that is patently absurd. All that happened was that the 2010-05 payment was delayed by 3 days.
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pCL0j.png"" alt=""two scenarios but showing the amount of money paid in each month""></p>

<pre><code>#so lets use cummulated expense over time    
ggplot(data=register.long,aes(dates,c(cumamount,cumamount.up)))+geom_point() + scale_y_continuous(name='cumulative sum of amounts ($)')
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/uneIQ.png"" alt=""Here we see the cumulative sum data for the two scenarios""></p>

<p>So for the simple plot the variable interpolate.daily would be about $50/30.4 = $1.64 per day for every day of the year. For the second plot where the amount being paid every month starts to go up every month in the second year would be showing a daily rate of $1.64 per day for every day in the first year and for dates in the second year one would see daily rates gradually increasing from $1.64 per day to about $3.12 per day.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for reading this all the way to the end. You must have been as intrigued as I was!</p>

What is the best way to create, organize, and maintain them?</p>

<p>i.e. All the products essentially consist of the same core functionality customized by graphics, strings, and other resource data to form each product.  <em>Imagine you are creating a set of products like ""Excel for Bankers"", Excel for Gardeners"", ""Excel for CEOs"", etc. Each product has the the same functionality, but differs in name, graphics, help files, included templates etc.</em></p>

<p>The environment in which these are being built is: vanilla Windows.Forms / Visual Studio 2008 / C# / .Net.</p>

<p>The ideal solution would be easy to maintain. e.g. If I introduce a new string / new resource projects I haven't added the resource to should fail at compile time, not run time. (And subsequent localization of the products should also be feasible).</p>

<p>Hopefully I've missed the blindingly-obvious and easy way of doing all this. What is it?</p>

<p><strong>============ Clarification(s) ================</strong></p>

<p>By ""product"" I mean the package of software that gets installed by the installer and sold to the end user. </p>

<p>Currently I have one solution, consisting of multiple projects, (including a Setup project), which builds a set of assemblies and create a single installer.</p>

<p><strong>What I need to produce are multiple products/installers, all with similar functionality, which are built from the same set of assemblies but differ in the set of resources used by one of the assemblies. What's the best way of doing this?</strong> </p>

<p>------------ The 95% Solution -----------------</p>

<p>Based upon Daminen_the_unbeliever's answer, a resource file per configuration can be achieved as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a class library project  (""Satellite""). </li>
<li>Delete the default .cs file and add a folder (""Default"")</li>
<li>Create a resource file in the folder ""MyResources""</li>
<li>Properties - set CustomToolNamespace to something
appropriate (e.g. ""XXX"")</li>
<li>Make sure the access modifier for the resources is ""Public"".     Add
the resources. Edit the source code.
Refer to the resources in your code
as XXX.MyResources.ResourceName)</li>
<li>Create Configurations for each product variant (""ConfigN"")</li>
<li>For each product variant, create a folder (""VariantN"")</li>
<li>Copy and Paste the MyResources file into each VariantN folder</li>
<li>Unload the ""Satellite"" project, and edit the .csproj file</li>
<li>For each ""VariantN/MyResources"" <code>&lt;Compile&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;EmbeddedResource&gt;</code> tag,
add  a  <code>Condition=""'$(Configuration)' == 'ConfigN'""</code>  attribute.</li>
<li>Save, Reload the .csproj, and you're done...</li>
</ol>

<p>This creates a per-configuration resource file, which can (presumably) be further localized. Compile error messages are produced for any configuration that where a a resource is missing. The resource files can be localized using the standard method (create a second resources file (MyResources.fr.resx) and edit .csproj as before).</p>

<p>The reason this is a 95% solution is that resources used to initialize forms (e.g. Form Titles, button texts) can't be easily handled in the same manner - the easiest approach seems to be to overwrite these with values from the satellite assembly. </p>

<p>This strikes me as very odd.
Why do I even bother passing something as a reference if it gets copied twice anyway?
Why does the v1.operator=(other) not destroy the elements it contains?
It would fit nicely with the behaviour of shared_ptr.
Can someone tell me why?</p>

<p><strong>ADDITION</strong>
I put this in an endless loop and checked the mem usage, it doesn't seem to produce
a mem leak at least.</p>

<p><strong>ADDITION</strong>
Ok, the mem is not an issue because it uses operator= rather than the copy ctor, ok thanks.
When I add</p>

<pre><code>v1.reserve(10);
v2.reserve(10);
</code></pre>

<p>the logical number of copies takes place. without that it reallocates and copies the whole vector for every single push_back, (which I find quite retarded even for small vectors).
Looking at this I will consider using .reserve more and optimize my assignment operators Like hell :)</p>

<p><strong>ADDITION: SUMMARY</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>All these issues seem specific to VC++2005.</li>
<li>If the size of the two containers match, my implementation uses operator= on the
elements instead of destroying the old ones and copying the new ones, which seems
sound practice. IF the sizes differ, normal destruction and copying are used.</li>
<li>With the 2005 Implementation, one has to use reserve! Otherwise abysmal and not std compliant performance.</li>
<li>These black boxes are much blacker than I thought.</li>

<p>The query I tried was (Forgive me if I missed a bracket here, that's not the issue):</p>

<pre><code>find( { $or : [ 
            { start : { $gte : ""050600"", $lt : ""052100"" } }, 
            { end : { $lt : ""052100"", $gt : ""050600"" } } 
        ] } )
</code></pre>

<p>Which only returned one of the three results. Switching the order of the $or parts ( querying against the end times before the start times) gives me two results but not all three. I seem to remember reading that for compound queries mongo throws away results that don't match the first part, before applying the second part of the query, but I thought the $or operator would handle that.
Any ideas? Is my query incorrect, is this a limitation of querying in mongo?</p>

Here's the rendered disabled button:</p>

<p>Of course I can check the condition on the server after clicking the Update button, but that's the last resort. It would be nice if I could completely disable the button generated by JSF only from javascript without call to the server.</p>

Thus, I'm using the SFML to record 10 sound records every 100 ms, and then encoding each record using libvorbis via libavcodec, and finally send them through the network.</p>

<p>So far, I worked thanks to libavcodec's examples included with the latest build, but i'm not sure to properly understand how libvorbis works, then I'm unable to get something working.</p>

<p>First, a simple detail, the SFML allows to get the samples as an array of short int (2 bytes). When I tried to initialize libvorbis encoder, it appears that the lib only accept samples as float. Thus, I attempt to convert my samples like this :</p>

<pre><code>float * SamplesFlt = new float [SamplesQuantity];
for (register int i = 0; i &lt; SamplesQuantity; i++)
{
    SamplesFlt[i] = (float) SamplesInt[i];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is this trick correct ?</p>

<p>In a second time, as I've understood so far, encoder is working using frames of a specifig length fixed by itself. In the example I studied, there were two informations :</p>

<ul>
<li>Frame size obtained using   CodecContext->frame_size  (64 for libvorbis)</li>
<li>Buffer size obtained using av_samples_get_buffer_size (256 for libvorbis)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I've set this :</p>

<pre><code>int FramesNb = SamplesQuantity / BufferSize;
</code></pre>

<p>Filling the frame :</p>

<pre><code>float * CurrentFrameSample = SamplesFlt;
int FillResult = avcodec_fill_audio_frame(InputFrame, CodecContext-&gt;channels, CodecContext-&gt;sample_fmt, (const uint8_t*) CurrentFrameSample, BufferSize, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>And I'm encoding my record like this :</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; FramesNb; i++)
{
    //Packet for output
    av_init_packet(&amp;OutputPacket);
    OutputPacket.data = NULL;
    OutputPacket.size = 0;

    //Updating Frame Data
    CurrentFrameSample = SamplesFlt + i * BufferSize * sizeof(float);

    //Encoding
    int EncodingOutput = 0;
    int EncodingReturn = avcodec_encode_audio2(EncCodecContext, &amp;OutputPacket, InputFrame, &amp;EncodingOutput);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far, I haven't understand yet what Buffer size is...</p>

<p>At last, according to the example, I'm collecting delayed frames at the end of the loop.</p>

<p>But my code doesn't work : I'm collecting encoded packets at each iteration of the loop, and their size. But if the first record outputs a packet of average 700 bytes, all following records outputs empty packets after encoding (size is equal to 0).</p>

<p>So I think that I'm using the encoder the wrong way. Somebody can explain me what I missed ? Thanks for your help.,</p>

<p>Here is the setUp.</p>

<p>1) 2 nib files, one ""MainMenu"" , the other an ""ActivityView"" nib.  In this case, the ""MainMenu"" nib contains the Window and the contentView. The ""ActivityView"" contains a view, whose file's Owner is a subclassed NSViewController, which is instantiated in the ""MainMenu"" nib.
The other thing is that the AppDelegate contains an IBOutlet to the ""ActivityView"" object in the MainMenu nib file.
So, programmatically, in the ""applicationDidFinishLaunching"" (of the AppDelegate), the code that is used, and works is:</p>

<pre><code>    self.window.contentView=ac.view // where ac is an NSViewController Subclass
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to understand how to do this in the IB, but have been unable to do so. The closest was a suggestion to copy and paste the view from the 2nd nib, ( which works) but does not seem elegant, or perhaps this is the way it is done. Connecting the view outlet of the ActivityController ( i.e. the owner of the ActivityView's nib) in the MainMenu nib to the view of the window, does not work.  There is a good chance I am not asking the correct question, so would appreciate some insights into what the issue is that I am missing.</p>

The author, like myself, disliked the standard implementation of ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlock because of various reasons (like MSFT insistance of having a FORM runat=server tag) and built a better mousetrap.</p>

"18392507","1","18392704","","2013-08-22 23:45:41","","1","339","<p>I've been trying to write some code to generate a maze of any given size (made up of 32x32 tiles), but have run into an odd issue with the rendering code, in that only square mazes will be textured correctly.</p>

<p>I have a single .png file with all possible wall textures, and the floor texture, and dependent on the placement of walls around the currently selected wall during the texturing methods, the correct part of this .png should be selected to make walls blend together nicely. However, as mentioned before, this only works with square mazes (note, rendering is being done with vertex buffer objexts).</p>

<p>Here's the code for generating the maze (currently, it just randomly fills the space with walls, I plan to adjust this part to actually generate a solvable maze once I fix this issue):</p>

<pre><code>public void run() { // The maze is part of a thread called World, which runs alongside a Renderer thread
    mazeWidth = 20;
    mazeHeight = 15;
    maze = new byte[mazeWidth][mazeHeight];
}

public static void setUpMaze() {
    for (int x = 0; x &lt; mazeWidth; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y &lt; mazeHeight; y++) {
            // TODO Make proper maze generation code
            maze[x][y] = (byte) mazeGenerator.nextInt(2);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code to generate the vertices for the triangles to be drawn:</p>

<pre><code>private float[] getMazeGrid() { // The 12 comes from the number of coordinates needed to define a square/single tile - 2 triangles, 6 vertices, 2 coordinates per vertex
    float[] mazeGrid = new float[12 * World.mazeWidth * World.mazeHeight];
    int yOffset = 0;
    int xOffset = 0;
        // The if statements adjust the minimum x/y coordinates for each tile, the for iterates through the tiles
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; World.mazeWidth * World.mazeHeight; i++) {
            if (i % World.mazeWidth == 0) {
                xOffset = 0;
            } else {
                xOffset += 32;
            }
            if (i % World.mazeWidth == 0 &amp;&amp; i != 0) {
                yOffset += 32;
            }
            // The code below defines one square of the grid
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 0] = xOffset;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 1] = yOffset;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 2] = xOffset;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 3] = yOffset + 32;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 4] = xOffset + 32;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 5] = yOffset + 32;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 6] = xOffset + 32;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 7] = yOffset + 32;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 8] = xOffset + 32;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 9] = yOffset;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 10] = xOffset;
            mazeGrid[12 * i + 11] = yOffset;                
        }
    return mazeGrid;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the code for determining which part of the texture should be used:</p>

<pre><code>private float[] getTexCoords(int x, int y) {
    texNumKey = 0;
    if (World.maze[x][y] == 1) {
        if (y &gt; 0) {
            if (World.maze[x][y - 1] == 1) texNumKey += 1;
        }
        if (x &gt; 0) {
            if (World.maze[x - 1][y] == 1) texNumKey += 2;
        }
        if (x &lt; World.mazeWidth - 1) {
            if (World.maze[x + 1][y] == 1) texNumKey += 4;
        }
        if (y &lt; World.mazeHeight - 1) {
            if (World.maze[x][y + 1] == 1) texNumKey += 8;
        }
    } else if (World.maze[x][y] == 0) {
        texNumKey = 16;
    }
    return texMap.get(texNumKey);
}
</code></pre>

<p>NB: texMap is a HashMap which contains float arrays with texture coordinates to be used by the texture coordinate buffer, keyed with a number from 0-16. The code above iterates through the grid and checks the spaces around the current tile, and selects the correct texture coordinates for that wall type.</p>

<p>Finally, the vertex buffer object code - setting up the VBOs:</p>

<pre><code>public void setUp() {
    initialiseTextureMap();

    vertexData = BufferUtils.createFloatBuffer(12 * World.mazeWidth * World.mazeHeight);
    vertexData.put(getMazeGrid());
    vertexData.flip();

    textureData = BufferUtils.createFloatBuffer(12 * World.mazeWidth * World.mazeHeight);
    for (int x = 0; x &lt; World.mazeWidth; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y &lt; World.mazeHeight; y++) {
            textureData.put(getTexCoords(x, y));
        }
    }
    textureData.flip();

    vboVertexHandle = glGenBuffers();
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vboVertexHandle);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexData, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);

    vboTextureCoordHandle = glGenBuffers();
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vboTextureCoordHandle);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, textureData, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And drawing the VBOs:</p>

<pre><code>public void draw() {            // Draws the entity
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, loadTexture(this.textureKey).getTextureID());

    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.vboVertexHandle);
    glVertexPointer(2, GL_FLOAT, 0, 0);

    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.vboTextureCoordHandle);
    glTexCoordPointer(2, GL_FLOAT, 0, 0);

    glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
    glEnableClientState(GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY);
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 12 * World.mazeWidth * World.mazeHeight);
    glDisableClientState(GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY);
    glDisableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);

    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Most unexplained variable names should be fairly self explanatory, they are defined in the abstract superclass, or in the ""Maze"" class constructor.</p>

<p>So, for clarity, the above code works perfectly when I set the values of mazeWidth, and mazeHeight to the same value as one another, but if they are different, then textures are not assigned to tiles correctly - here is are examples of the code working, and failing, the top is a 10 x 10 maze, and the bottom 10 x 11: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/uZ6mb"" rel=""nofollow"">Maze Examples</a></p>

<p>EDIT: After switching the x and y for loops in the texture coordinate buffer setup:

<p><strong>AS A BONUS:</strong> I'd like to mark the SD regions (up to 3 SD) on the density curve as well. How can I do this? I tried <code>abline</code>, but the line extends to the top of the graph and looks ugly.</p>

<p>Using this web.config</p>

<pre><code>&lt;customErrors mode=""On""&gt;
    &lt;error statusCode=""401"" redirect=""/Errors/Http401"" /&gt;
&lt;/customErrors&gt;

<p>with the following code</p>

<pre><code>namespace MvcApplication1.Controllers
{
    [HandleError]
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            // Force a 401 exception for testing
            throw new HttpException(401, ""Unauthorized"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't result in what I was hoping for.  Instead I get the generic ASP.NET error page telling me to modify my web.config to see the actual error information.  However, if instead of throwing an exception I return an invalid View, I get the /Shared/Views/Error.aspx page:</p>

<pre><code>return View(""DoesNotExist"");
</code></pre>

<p>Throwing exceptions within a controller like I've done above seems to bypass all of the <code>HandleError</code> functionality, so what's the right way to create error pages and how do I play nice with the MVC infrastructure?</p>

This process may involve running a combiner and compressing data while writing to the disk.</p>

<p>So, I was thinking if instead we could configure to compress the data in memory and store in memory, so that maybe at the end of the mapper it does not have overflown its circular memory and hence only need to spill once to the disk. Is this possible? And/or useful? </p>

A few people want to query these logs at any time they want. System writes avg 5000 rows per second (1000 bulk inserts) and primary key doesn't exist but there are 6 indexes for different columns. By the way, table has 20 columns and there is not any foreign key.</p>

<p>Because of huge disk sizes necessity, i don't want to use innodb tables. As you know MyISAM table sizes are about three (or more) times smaller than same innodb tables. I plan to use different tables per month and compress tables that are older than this month. Compressing is more easy for myisam tables than innodb using myisampack utility. For these reasons, i want to use myisam tables. </p>

<p>But we know myisam is not safe for corruption. I don't want to lose myisam tables if they are corrupted. It directed me to use innodb for real time logs. After a short period (5 minutes or 1 hour or at the midnight) i want to put my records to myisam tables. But converting table using ""alter table ... engine=myisam"" command takes much time for huge data. </p>

<p>I can use different databases and replicate innodb data to myisam table, this is one alternative. But i had some problems for replication before and i am not sure to use it. Other option i think is writing records double (both innodb and myisam tables at the same time). But it will be slow down both query and disk performances. </p>

<p>What do you suggest me about this situation? It can be engine conversion suggestions or fully new architecture suggestions. </p>

<p><strong><code>0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1</code></strong>  (2 bytes)  </p>

<p>I might need to get data from range bit 3 to 9. In other words I would be interested in: </p>

<p><strong>0 1 0 1 1 0 <code>1 1 1 1 0 1 0</code> 1 1 1</strong></p>

<p>so in short I will like to construct the method:</p>

<pre><code> byte[] Read(byte[] data, int left, int right){ 

     // implementation
 }
</code></pre>

<p>so that if I pass the data <code>new byte[]{91,215}, 3, 9</code>  I will get <code>byte[]{122}</code>  (note byte 91 and 215 = <code>0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1</code> and byte 122 = <code>1 1 1 1 0 1 0</code> same binary data as the example.</p>

<p>It would be nice if I could use the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator on byte arrays such as doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>  byte[] myArray = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 };
  var shift = myArray &lt;&lt; 2;

<p>I am creating a project on a board and often need to read and write values to the memory. The cdf, sfr, or ddf (refereed to as chip definition file) contains information about a particular chip. That file may look like:</p>

sfr = ""SPI0_CONTROL""              , ""Memory"", 0x40001000,        4, base=16
sfr = ""SPI0_CONTROL.SPH""          , ""Memory"", 0x40001000,        4, base=16,    bitRange=25-25
sfr = ""SPI0_CONTROL.SPO""          , ""Memory"", 0x40001000,        4, base=16,    bitRange=24-24

<p>Since I am reading a lot of variables (sometimes 80 times per second) I will like to have an efficient algorithm. I guess my approach would be that if the bytesize is 8 then I will create a long from those 8 bytes then use the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operators in order to get what I need. if the bytesize if 4 then I will create an int and use the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operators but How will I do it if I need to read 16 bytes though? <strong>I guess my question should been how to implement the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operators on custom struct types.</strong></p>

<p>I've looked at the updateMembersLists_jsp.java, and here is the section where the null pointer is occurring:</p>

<pre><code>//create a file to write to the output
PrintWriter outputFile2 = null;
try
    {
    outputFile2 = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(basePathName + ""programAll.txt"", false));
//  outputFile2 = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(""programAll.txt"", false));
    }
    catch (FileNotFoundException e)
        {
        out.write(""&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color='red'&gt;Error Saving&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"");
        }
outputFile2.print(output);  // THIS IS LINE 1492 -- NULL POINTER
outputFile2.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Also: We are now running Tomcat off of the root directory instead of Program Files. I have checked the basePathName and it is being calculated correctly.</p>

<p>Now I figured out that Tomcat's policy settings might need to be adjusted. I added the following lines to catalina.policy hoping it would set things right:</p>

<pre><code>// The permissions granted to the pubmed webapp
grant codeBase ""file:${catalina.home}/webapps/pubmed/-"" {
        permission java.io.FilePermission ""${catalina.home}/webapps/pubmed/-"", ""read, write"";
        permission java.io.FilePermission ""${catalina.home}/webapps/pubmed/*"", ""read, write"";
};
</code></pre>

<p>This didn't seem to have any effect. The Windows user that tomcat is running under has read/write permissions on the pubmed directory. Aside from the fact that it seems questionable for this webapp to be writing files to its own directory, what am I missing?</p>

<p>At the moment I'm using the following to HIDE the markers. <strong>This works 100%.</strong> It sets the visible value of the marker to false in the DOM tab of firebug and the marker icons disappear.</p>

<pre><code>  function clearMarkers() {

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; markers.length; i++) {
      markers[i].setVisible(false);
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, my issue is I cannot SHOW OR unhide the markers. This is my current function. I can still click on my listing of stores and it pops up the markers infoWindow, BUT the marker just doesn't appear once its been hidden. <strong>Can anyone help me in unhiding the marker ICON in this restoreMarkers function?</strong> </p>

<pre><code>  function restoreMarkers() {
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; markers.length; i++) {
      markers[i].setVisible(true);
    }
    markers.setMap(map);
  }

<hr>

<p>Generate keystore from PEM (PEM -> PKCS#12 keystore -> JKS keystore)</p>

<p>Create PKCS12 keystore from private key and public certificate:</p>

<pre><code>sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -name myservercert -in selfsigned.crt -inkey server.key -out keystore.p12
</code></pre>

<p>Convert PKCS12 keystore into a JKS keystore:</p>

<pre><code>sudo keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore mykeystore.jks -srckeystore keystore.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -alias myservercert
</code></pre>

<p>List the contents of the JKS keystore:</p>

<pre><code>sudo keytool -list -v -keystore mykeystore.jks
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Your local JVM should trust the server Certificate. If its self-signed, add it to the cacerts (trusted certificates list; its default password is 'changeit'):</p>

<pre><code>sudo keytool -import -alias alias_serv_cert -file /var/tmp/CERT_SERVER.cert -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.25.x86_64/jre/lib/security/cacerts
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Java code to generate the client and do the POST:</p>

<pre><code>char[] keystorePass = ""MY PASSWORD"".toCharArray();

FileInputStream fis = null;

//Loading KEYSTORE in JKS format
KeyStore keyStorePci = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
try {
fis = new FileInputStream(keystoreDirectory + keystoreFilename);
keyStorePci.load(fis, keystorePass);
} catch (Exception e) {
LOG.error(""Error loading keystore: "" + keystoreDirectory+ keystoreFilename);
} finally {
if (fis != null) {
fis.close();
}
}

//Setting JKS keystore in SSL Context (I do not reccomend pass a 3rd argument PrivateKeyStrategy!)
SSLContext sslcontext = SSLContexts.custom().loadKeyMaterial(keyStorePci, keystorePass).build();

//Creating Async HTTP client with SSL
CloseableHttpAsyncClient httpclient = HttpAsyncClients.custom().setSSLContext(sslcontext).build();

//Executing POST method
try {

httpclient.start();
future = httpclient.execute(httppost, new MyCustomAsyncResultManager(transactionId, transactionToken));
HttpResponse response = future.get();
LOG.info(""result: "" + response.getStatusLine());

} finally {httpclient.close();}

It could be that though the user has permission for locations, he may not have permissions for holidays. Is there anyway that I could still use the extend() method to retrieve the holidays, at the same time considering permissions? Or else, do I have to expose a separate method in the controller to retrieve holidays, after checking permissions?</p>

<p>In the last few days i have been interesting in how Javascript framework have they own workspace , what i mean is how they can call a variable at any name they want and work with it without involving local variables.</p>

<p>I'm writing now an API and i'm facing the problem of the local variables / function local names , if they already exist.</p>

<p>So , what i have done is looking into how framework works and i saw they use namespace functions like this :</p>

<pre><code>(function(){ .... })()
</code></pre>

<p>so i tried to do something alike</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
      (function() {
        function f(toAlert) {  alert(toAlert);  }
      })();
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;

    &lt;script&gt;
      toAlert(""hi"");
    &lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but it's not working..</p>

<p>so i have few questions :</p>

<p>DaveRandom was correct.  I was initially using 'Parse_STR' and then 'Var_Dump' to view my results and for some reason this was removing the values that I was looking for, but once I just did an 'echo $results' to view everything I was able to see what I was looking for.   </p>

I followed the instructions on htmldoc website but it does not work, I think I missed something that is obvious and therefore not said in the doc. </p>

<p>I followed these instructions : <a href=""http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/docfiles/5-cgi.html#6_3_3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/docfiles/5-cgi.html#6_3_3</a></p>

<p>That's what I did : downloaded htmldoc executable (msi) and installed it in C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.2.17\cgi-bin. As I'm on windows, I don't think I can do symlink so I put it directly here. I executed htmldoc.exe, which opened briefly a windows and closed it (I supposed it wrote the keys in the registry).</p>

<p>Then I opened httpd.conf and added AcceptPathInfo On anywhere (actually just after LoadModule part). I'm quite sure it's not necessary, but I added AddHandler cgi-script .cgi too, and in my alias, I added Options +ExecCGI.</p>

<p>Then I restarted Wamp.</p>

<p>When I execute my php code, the pdf is created but it is empty. I had the same thing before I tried to install htmldoc.</p>

<p>I'm quite sure the php code works because it works on another (linux) server.</p>

<p>Is there something I have to install ? (cgi, pear maybe ?) Has anyone found a solution to this problem ? </p>

the command used is :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>use integer/char to store gender column:</p>

<pre><code>gender tinyint(1) not null;

<p>in this case, I have to write these in my Java code:</p>

<pre><code>public class StaticData {
    public static final short MALE = 0;
    public static final short FEMALE = 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>if so, my database will depend on my Java code to limit the value range and explain what 0/1 represents (low level depends on high level). I think that's not a good idea.</p></li>
<li><p>use enum to store gender column:</p>

<pre><code>gender enum(""MALE"", ""FEMALE"") not null
</code></pre>

<p>and in this case, my Java code will depend on the enum's value. There are 2 ways to get these values:</p>

<p>1) public enum Gender { MALE, FEMALE }, it's nearly the same with method 1.</p>

<p>2) retrieve these values from MySQL, such as ""SHOW COLUMNS FROM user LIKE \""gender\"""" and then use a regular expression to split the string. But this is a verbose method. And have to query from db everytime I load a JSP. I think it would be expensive.</p></li>

</code></pre>

<p>This is driving me nuts.  Normally, one would get this if the various projects that are a part of their solution do not agree on which CRT to use (single threaded, multi-threaded, release or debug).  However, I have been over this thing about 500 times now, and they all agree.</p>

<p>Background: this is a VS 2010 project just converted from VS 2008.  </p>

<p>MFC Toolbox Library.lib is set to compile as a static library, using /MTd, as is the target .exe I am trying to compile in this solution.  Further, the solution that this is being converted from (VS 2008) already compiles &amp; links properly!!!  So it's not like that there is a disagreement between the two .vcproj's - or at least there wasn't before the conversion.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the MFC Toolbox Library is used by about 25 other projects in another solution - and in that solution (Master Build English) it compiles &amp; links against those other projects without complaint in both debug and release targets.</p>

<p>I have just spent the last hour going over every single project property for this target project (Cimex Header Viewer) vs. several different target exe projects in Master Build English solution - and I cannot find a difference.  They appear to be identical, excepting that they're different names.</p>

<p>I've tried doing a clean &amp; build all.  I'm simply out of ideas.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a thought on what else I might investigate???</p>

<p>I think I'm ready to start chewing glass.  :(</p>

<p>I have a string representing some polylines encoded using <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Google's Encoded Polyline Algorithm Format</a> and I need to decode them to obtain the latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>There are 11 steps in the encoding scheme and I presume that to decode, I would work them backwards (I'm working with the example string <code>`~oia@</code>):</p>

<p>Step 11. Convert each char to its ASCII equivalent = <strong>96 126 111 105 97 64</strong></p>

<p>Step 10. Minus 63 to each value = <strong>33 63 48 42 34 1</strong></p>

<p>Step 9. Convert to chunks of 6-bits = <strong>100001 111111 110000 101010 100010 000001</strong></p>

<p>Step 8. Remove the sixth bit counting from the right = <strong>00001 11111 10000 01010 00010 00001</strong></p>

<p>Step 7. Reverse their order = <strong>00001 00010 01010 10000 11111 00001</strong></p>

<p>Step 6. Align them into chunks of 8 = <strong>00000010 00100101 01000011 11100001</strong></p>

<p>Step 5. If the original decimal value is negative, invert the bits...</p>

<p>But without knowledge of the original decimal value, how do we know if the original decimal value is positive/negative?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$file['info']['files']</code> array can contain any number of elements. The <code>path</code> array contained in each <code>$file['info']['files']</code> array is where I am having trouble.</p>

<p>It contains information about a file structure. If just 1 element exists then it is a file. If more than one element exists then each element starting from the top is a parent folder of the next element and the last element is the file in the last folder. Taking the example above would be a file structure of</p>

<pre><code>FILE file1.txt
FOLDER directory one
     FILE file2.txt
     FOLDER directory two
          FILE {file3.txt}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to extract this data into my own array structure which is to be as follows,</p>

<pre><code> $sortedFiles = array(
     'file1.txt' =&gt; (int),
     'directory one' =&gt; array(
         'file2.txt' =&gt; (int),
         'directory two' =&gt; array(
              'file3.txt' =&gt; (int),
         ),
     ),
 );
</code></pre>

<p>I have this code so far,</p>

<pre><code>foreach($file['info']['files'] as $file) {
    // LENGTH AND PATH ARE SET
    if(isset($file['length'], $file['path'])) {
        // GET COUNT OF FILE PATH ARRAY
        $count = count($file['path']);
        // SINGLE FILE
        if($count == 1) {
            $sortedFiles[$file['path'][0]] = $file['length'];
        // FILES IN DIRECTORY
        } else {
            // BUILD ARRAY STRUCTURE FOR DIRECTORIES
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am having trouble when it comes to adding directories to the array. I could do it manually and only go so many directories down each time checking if the array for the directory exists and if not create it, and if it does exist then add to it. I tried this with the code below but it only goes one directory deep (the code went where it says <code>// BUILD ARRAY STRUCTURE</code> above).</p>

<pre><code>// FOLDER NOT SET
if(!isset($files[$file['path'][0]])) {
    $sortedFiles[$file['path'][0]] = array($file['path'][1] =&gt; $file['length'],);
// FOLDER SET
} else {
    $sortedFiles[$file['path'][0]][$file['path'][1]] = $file['length'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I dynamically create arrays for each directory that exists and add the information that is needed bearing in mind that the directory structure could be any amount of levels deep?</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read my rather long question and I appreciate any help that anyone gives to me.</p>

 - Scripts placed before the parsing error still run. (Of course.)
 - Timeouts and intervals that were set in these scripts will still execute after the parsing error.
 - In Firefox, the DOM is a <code>&lt;parsererror&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;sourcetext&gt;</code> inside it. I can detect this if I query <code>document.firstChild.tagName</code>.</p>

<p>If I use a TemplateColumn and put a Button control inside, that works fine.</p>

<p>Looking at the HTML that gets rendered for the DataGrid, I can see that ASP.NET isn't outputting an onclick for the ButtonColumn, where it does do so for a Button inside a TemplateColumn:</p>

<p><b>ButtonColumn:</b></p>

<pre>
&lt;input type=""submit""
  name=""ctl00$placeholderContent$dgCommittees$ctl03$ctl00""

  value=""Delete""
  onclick=""return confirm('Are you sure you wish to delete this committee?');

  id=""ctl00_placeholderContent_dgCommittees_ctl03_cmdDelete"" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>Obviously the answer to ""how do I make this work?"" is to simply replace all my ButtonColumns with Buttons in TemplateColumns.</p>

<p>I'm curious if anyone knows <i>why</i> ASP.NET renders ButtonColumns this way though, and if there's some way to get it to render them the same as Buttons.</p>

<p>If I link the above proxy to an HTTP response (also in XML) instead, the result would then work as expected, without the need to change the above proxy configuration.</p>

I'm trying to create my own Button subclass that would have its on animations for mouse enter and mouse exit. The animation I'm trying to achieve is a simple ""darken"" or ""dim"" transition that would darken the color of the button background when user hovers over the button , and would animate back to normal state when the mouse exits the button. </p>

<p>First I thought I can achieve this with FillTransition, but for that I would need the specific darker color of the button, that depends on the button color.
So now I'm trying to basically fade in and fade out a low-opacity black rectangle on top of the button, but the rectangle doesn't seem to appear at all.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

    private Rectangle dimRectangle;

    private Color dimColor = new Color(0,0,0,0.11);

    public FlatButton(String text) {
        super(text);

        getStyleClass().addAll(""flat-button-style"");
        createEffect();
    }

    private void createEffect() 
    {
        dimRectangle = new Rectangle(this.getWidth(), this.getHeight(), dimColor);
        dimRectangle.setOpacity(1.0);
        dimRectangle.setX(this.get);


        FadeTransition enterTransition = new FadeTransition(dimDuration, this);
        enterTransition.setInterpolator(Interpolator.EASE_OUT);
        enterTransition.setFromValue(0.0);
        enterTransition.setToValue(1.0);

        FadeTransition exitTransition = new FadeTransition(dimDuration, this);
        exitTransition.setInterpolator(Interpolator.EASE_OUT);
        exitTransition.setFromValue(1.0);
        exitTransition.setToValue(0.0);


        this.setOnMouseEntered(new EventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt;(){

            public void handle(MouseEvent mouseEvent){
                enterTransition.play();
            }
        });

            }
        });
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The part in the code ""new FadeTransition(dimDuration, this);"" should be ""new FadeTransition(dimDuration, dimRectangle);"". It's just something I was testing.</p>

<p>The problem is, i don't know how to ignore this characters and how to break down the reading of the file so that i can call the functions to modify de tree.</p>

<p>I'd be most grateful if anyone could help me with this.</p>

<pre><code>err = AudioQueueStart(audioQueue, NULL);
if (err)
{
    [self failWithErrorCode:AS_AUDIO_QUEUE_START_FAILED];
    return;

</code></pre>

<p>the error code is: <a href=""http://darcs.brianweb.net/vendor/powerpc-apple-darwin/include/CoreAudio/AudioHardware.h"" rel=""nofollow"">kAudioDeviceUnsupportedFormatError</a>.. this guy is defined in CoreAudio/AudioHardware.h, which seems to be a hardware related problem. I couldn't find much useful information about this error on the web. </p>

<p>The interesting part is that earlier on I faced a similar problem while attempting this:</p>

<pre><code>// create the audio 
err = AudioQueueNewOutput(&amp;asbd, MyAudioQueueOutputCallback, self, NULL, NULL, 0, &amp;
    if (err)
{
    [self failWithErrorCode:AS_AUDIO_QUEUE_CREATION_FAILED];
    return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(the same problem faced in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1459689/audioqueuestart-reporting-unsupported-format"">this</a> post, but the author of the post mistakenly attributed their error code to <em>AudioQueueStart</em> rather than <em>AudioQueueNewOutput</em>)</p>

<p>I got this error code: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/AudioQueueReference/Reference/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">kAudioFormatUnsupportedDataFormatError</a>.. and my remedy was manually adding this code:</p>

<pre><code>asbd.mFormatID = kAudioFormatMPEGLayer3;
</code></pre>

<p>since I discovered that calling </p>

<pre><code>AudioFileStreamGetProperty(inAudioFileStream, kAudioFileStreamProperty_DataFormat, &amp;asbdSize, &amp;asbd);
</code></pre>

<p>initially gave me <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/CoreAudioDataTypesRef/Reference/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">kAudioFormatMPEGLayer1</a> as the mFormatID rather than <a href=""http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scikits/branches/audiolab-0.10.x/scikits/audiolab/soundio/macosx/AudioHardware.pxd"" rel=""nofollow"">kAudioFormatMPEGLayer3</a>, which is .mp3 which is what the audio file i'm playing actually is.</p>

<p>Finally.. probably the first time I noticed something was wrong was when I initially called this function: </p>

<pre><code>AudioFileStreamOpen((__bridge void*)streamer, ASPropertyListenerProc, ASPacketsProc, 
                                        0, &amp;(streamer-&gt;audioFileStream));
</code></pre>

<p>the first time I didn't provide the inFileTypeHint to the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/AudioStreamReference/Reference/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">function</a> it resulted in the </p>

<pre><code>AudioFileStreamParseBytes(streamer-&gt;audioFileStream, inDataByteSize, inData, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>call to fail to parse the bytes.. (specifically.. I got the <em>Parse bytes failed. err: typ? 1954115647</em> error message, which is kAudioFileUnsupportedFileTypeError).. </p>

<p>the way I got around that was by (you guessed it) manually adding the file type hint:</p>

<pre><code>    streamer-&gt;err = AudioFileStreamOpen((__bridge void*)streamer, ASPropertyListenerProc, ASPacketsProc, 
                                        kAudioFileMP3Type, &amp;(streamer-&gt;audioFileStream));
</code></pre>

<p>so you can see.. a problem i've pushed under the rug is finally coming around to bite me.. but i'm not sure why the parser is failing to recognize my audio file type manually.. and why I have to keep on hardcoding that value.. only to have it fail at the end.</p>

// It seems, that the following three lines have no effect without explisit setting of the ""hls_time"" property
codec_ctx-&gt;keyint_min = gopSize;       // in FFMpeg application, the corresponding option is ""-keyint_min 3""
codec_ctx-&gt;scenechange_threshold = 0;  // in FFMpeg application, the corresponding option is ""-sc_threshold 0""
codec_ctx-&gt;gop_size = gopSize;         // in FFMpeg application, the corresponding option is ""-g 3""

ret = av_opt_set_double(ofmt_ctx, ""hls_time"", 3.0, AV_OPT_SEARCH_CHILDREN);

ret = av_opt_set(codec_ctx-&gt;priv_data, ""profile"", ""main"", AV_OPT_SEARCH_CHILDREN);
ret = av_opt_set(codec_ctx-&gt;priv_data, ""preset"", ""ultrafast"", AV_OPT_SEARCH_CHILDREN);

<p>The scope property ""filter.option"" does not get reset when changing the scope property ""filter.general"", but the drop-down does.</p>

<p>Mandatory code of the array:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.filterData = [
{""name"" : ""Users"", ""options"" : []},
{""name"" : ""Data calls"", ""options"" : [{""title"": ""Collection""}, {""title"": ""User""}]},
{""name"" : ""Msg Pub"", ""options"" : [{""title"": ""Topic""}, {""title"": ""User""}]},
{""name"" : ""Msg Sub"", ""options"" : [{""title"": ""Topic""}, {""title"": ""User""}]}
];
</code></pre>

<p>I came up with a hack using ng-change that wipes ""filter.option"" to get the desired behavior. Fiddle <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/ADukg/4639/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>Does anyone know why this is happening? It seems to be because the ""filter.option"" model is not bound to the ""filter.general"" model and therefore does not reflect any changes to the latter. Is there a way to build the second model off of the first one? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Also I keep getting an error, whenever I try to create a function that does anything, telling me my function doesn't exist and acting like it isn't there. Why is this?</p>

<p>To summarize, I'm just trying to set up a class that will allow me to enter my multidimensional array, and then set it up so that I can add functions/methods to get year, model, trim-level, transmission, and colors. Is this even possible? Please be kind if this is a simple solution, I am new to PHP, new to programming, and am trying to create my very first object/class.</p>

<p>As I see, there is no way to inject the logger by default or access it via a static registry in Symfony 2, so my approach is as follows:</p>

<p>I added a static method and property to the base class of my models and set the Logger there.
I also added a getter, that is then available in my models.</p>

<p>I set the logger in there via the request kernel event, so the logger is only available after this event.</p>

<p>This solution works but it seems rather hacky to me. Anyone got a better idea how to approach this? A setup method that does not rely on the request kernel event would be nice. A method that does not rely on static properties would be even nicer!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>--- <strong>Edit</strong> ---</p>

<p>The same question is valid if no proxy is involved but when RegisterType cannot be used. Eg...</p>

<pre><code>builder.Register(c =&gt;
{
  [...]
  if(something)
   return new SomeType(dep1, dep2, dep3);
  else
   return new SomeOtherType(dep1, dep4, dep2, dep5);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I also would like to reuse Autofac's ""find ctor logic"" if possible.</p>

<p>--- <strong>End edit</strong> ---</p>

<p>It works fine but, if possible, I would like to use autofac's logic to find the ctor dependencies for me. I want to write something like</p>

<pre><code>builder.Register(c =&gt;
{
  object[] ctorDependencies = letAutofacDoTheSimilarWorkAsInRegisterType(typeof(MyType));
  return someProxyFactory.Create&lt;MyType&gt;(ctorDependencies);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is this possible or do I have to write my own logic for this? Or is some completely different approach available for this scenario?</p>

<p>The way I use it is like this:</p>

<p>where <code>$recipients</code> is a commaseparated array of emails (built with <code>explode()</code> from a mySQL query)..</p>

<p>I have no idea which part of the above code that generates the script-timeout, and since I use it for a newsletter function, it is rather difficult for me to test or debug it, so I would be really thankful for anyone coming up with a (near) bulletproof solution to this problem :) </p>

Each node should be 'movable' (draggable to an appropriate place manually or their best location computed algorithmically).  I should be able to zoom into the network graph (say if there are many clusters of nodes and I want to concentrate on a particular cluster of nodes).  I should be able to right-click any node or link and get a context menu (e.g., 'show routing table', 'show interfaces', 'show bandwidth utilization graph' etc.).  </p>

<p>The data for this network topology will be fetched by making calls to an apache based webserver where the backend scripts in python will fetch the appropriate data and send it via JSON to the web client. </p>

I can't remove body height:100% as this is needed to make the .header class 50% of the page. Firefox is not effected by this issue at all. I've looked at other similar questions but non help.</p>

<p>I've written up a test here: <a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bIHxc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bIHxc</a>. </p>

<p>.</p>

<p>I've tried these things to get it to work in chrome but each one stops something else from working:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Current <a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bIHxc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bIHxc</a></strong> - 
Header is 50% of page (good) but scrolling fails to work in Chrome (bad)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>tried min-height:100% instead of height:100% in body css</strong> - 
This allows scrolling to work in chrome (good) but collapses the header (bad) </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change #mainContainer css from position: relative; to absolute</strong> - 
Both header and scrolling work (good) until you expand the #sidebar (click the Open button top left). The #mainContainer can now be moved freely especially noticeable on mobile or with a mac trackpad (very bad!). It looks as if overflow-x isn't working or something. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm trying to do this without javascript. Am I trying to do something impossible?</p>

The loan application (upon submit) redirects to the client's Home Page, but unfortunately, it stays within the frame rather than going to the main Home Page window.  I had inquired here about how to remedy this, and was told that the Target attribute target=""_top"" would do the trick.</p>

<p>""The thank you page after the application and before the redirect URL has a unique URL.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to code your iframe to recognize this URL and redirect the full site to your home page rather than depending on the vLender redirect within the iframe?</strong></p>

<p>I am including the unique thank you page URL from Lori's website below, the ref_ID attribute is the unique application ID number assigned to my test application (the application ID's are generated using the first 3 letters of the applicant's first name [LYN for Lynsee] and the first 3 letters of the applicant's last name [TES for Testing] followed by the numeric sequence) but you should be able to remove that and have your custom site's code recognize the .php url which would trigger a redirect within your site's code that would take place before our system enacts its redirect to the home page within the iframe.</p>

Probably, I don't understand that query they're using.</p>

<p>The part that interests me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first vulnerability affects the mysql_real_escape_string()
  function family which does not reject invalid multi-byte characters.
  For example, in UTF-8, the ""0xC8 ' ' attackersql"" or ""0xC8 \ '
  attackersql"" string is converted to ""one_character ' attackersql""
  (ignore spaces). So, the query:</p>
  
  <p>SELECT ... WHERE v = ' mysql_real_escape_string(""0xC8 ' attackersql"") '</p>
  
  <p>become :</p>
  
  <p>SELECT ... WHERE v = ' 0xC8 ' ' attackersql '</p>
  
  <p>SELECT ... WHERE v = 'one_character ' attackersql'</p>
  
  <p>An attacker can therefore inject the attackersql command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question sounds pretty lame, but <strong>how can I make this injection work?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note (edited):</strong> I'm using PHP 5.2.6, MySQL 5.0.51a (correction) and charset 'utf8' is set on DB connection.</p>

<ul>
<li>does include ""Let users have additional addresses""</li>
<li>does not include ""Fixed the bug where addresses were overwritten due to X""  </li>

<p>Today, we're using <em>flags in commit messages</em> such as</p>

<p><code>Add|Ref|Rem|Fix: &lt;msg&gt;</code> for the usual commit.</p>

<p>As such, my first stab at this would be to add another tier to those flags, for example</p>

<p><code>CL-Add: feature X</code> (CL = changelog) and then parse all commit messages for <code>^CL-(Add|Ref|Rem|Fix)</code> to add to the changelog.</p>

<p>But then, how would you approach the possibility of having commit messages written just for changelogs (i.e. too high level); or multiple messages concerning the same changelog issue. Perhaps the changelog messages should rather be extracted when feature-branches are merged? Are there features of SCM:s (for example git) that handles this issue for you?</p>

<p>Simply put: <strong>is there an industry standard strategy, or tool, for extracting useful commit messages into changelogs with ease?</strong></p>

<p>I've discovered that this <code>JS Knockout</code> code is what makes the change. But this code should not be triggered until I add a brand. So why is this affecting my <code>&amp;</code>s?</p>

<pre><code>(simplified)
...service/rest-api/trunk/project1
...service/common/trunk/project2
...service/common/trunk/parent-aggregator
</code></pre>

<p>The last one (parent-aggregator) is a maven pom project that contains the shared dependencies and the multi-module configuration.</p>

<p>So as I am using Eclipse svn (subclipse) client, it allows me to import all those projects into my eclipse workspace, having all the projects in the same directory, therefore the configuration I created can use the relative paths:</p>

<p>parent-aggregator pom.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;modules&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;../project1&lt;/module&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;../project2&lt;/module&gt;
&lt;/modules&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The issue came when one of my colleagues got the projects using tortoise svn client and then imported the projects to eclipse, tortoise is replicating the svn directory structure in his local file system.</p>

<p>So whenever he tries to do a mvn clean install to the parent-aggregator, it fails due to project1 not being reachable. Which makes sense as in his machine the projects are not in the same directory.</p>

<p>Is there a way to reference modules so both structures can work?</p>

<p>I tried so far to use the artifactId:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module&gt;artifactId&lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Also tried adding project name, by first defining a:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;name&gt;project1&lt;/name&gt;

<p>inside project1 pom.xml</p>

<p>And then referencing it in module:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module&gt;project1&lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But it keeps telling me that it cannot find the child module.</p>

<p>The temporary solution that we are using is having different relative path in his local machine:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;modules&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;../../../rest-api/trunk/project1&lt;/module&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;../project2&lt;/module&gt;

From the scraps of <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/flux/raw/master/docs/img/flux-diagram-white-background.png"" rel=""nofollow"">info</a> I've found online it seems correct to separate the API logic from the stores.</p>

<p>Starting there, I've created a client API that makes requests to the server. Now I want these functions them listen to my actions, then make a request, and upon success to trigger other actions that subsequently update the stores with the new data from the server.</p>

<p>How can go about having something similar to the reflux createStore method for my API? Or, is there some other clean way for my server calls to listen to actions?</p>

<p>Then i tried to install a custom portlet. For some reason the installation failed and i removed the portlet from the ""deploy"" folder and i even restarted the server. This portlet don´t do anything very special, it just runs some custom queries against Liferay´s Lucene search engine.</p>

</ol>

<p>If I have left any possibilities out, please let me know.</p>

<p>Also, I couldn't find a good book on Solr on Amazon. There is a good one on Lucene, though (the In Action series). Unfortunately, it only briefly mentions Solr. Is it worthwhile reading a good book on Lucene in order to understand how to use Solr better, or would I be wasting my time/money?

<p>I'm currently creating a form. This form is made in HTML and controlled by jQuery.</p>

<p>The form code is as following;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""form""&gt;
        &lt;form&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;ID :&lt;/label&gt;

            &lt;label id=""response""&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this form picks up user data, and gets processed by the following jQuery script;</p>

<pre><code>// Start jQuery script
// jQuery for dynamic adding without complete page reloads
//Wait for document readiness

$('document').ready(function() {
    // Define submit button and action
    $('#button').click(function() {

        // Assign variable

            alert(""Enter Client ID"");
            return false;
        } else {
            var clientid = $('#name').val();
        }

        // Assign variable
        if ($('#name').val() == """"){
            alert(""Enter Client full name"");
            return false;
        } else {
            var name =$('#name').val();                        
        }

        // Assign variable
        if ($('#ipaddress').val() == """") {
            alert(""Enter Client owned IP address"");
            return false;
        } else {
            var ipaddress = $('#ipaddress').val();
        }

        // Assign variable
        if ($('#status').val() == """") {
            alert(""Enter client status"");
            return false;
        } else {
            var status = $('#status').val();
        }

        // When variables are known, continue processing and POST'ing
        // Posting to seperate PHP file to complete
        jQuery.post(""processing/addC.php"", {
            clientid: clientid,
            name: name,
            ipaddress: ipaddress,
            status: status
        },

        function(data, textStatus) {
            if (data == 1) {
                $('#response').html(""Insert successful!"");
                $('#response').css('color', 'green');
            } else {
                $('#response').html(""Insertion failure. Please try again or restart."");
                $('#response').css('color', 'red');
            }
        });
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This code obviously passes the variables through a POST to addC.php.</p>

<p>addC.php contains the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

// Get current connection
include 'dbconnect.php';

$clientid = $_POST['clientid'];
$name = $_POST['name'];
$ipaddress = $_POST['ipaddress'];
$status = $_POST['status'];

$query = pg_query_params(
  $dbconnection,
  'INSERT INTO clients(clientid, name, ipaddress,status) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4);', 
   array($clientid, $name, $ipaddress, $status)
);                         

if(pg_affected_rows($query)&gt;0){
    echo ""1"";
}else{
    echo ""2"";
}

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The desired result of this code is the if-statement returning a 1, so the jQuery can create a nice green message saying the database insertion went correct.</p>

<p>Now, as I validated the pg_query(); syntax to be correct, there must be something wrong in this code itself. What seems to be the problem here? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p><em>Following error;</em>

<p>Now for the software side. Libftdi v1.0 is installed under Linux Mint 17 by following instruction:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19568575/pylibftdi-library-not-working-serial-mode-um232h"">Pylibftdi library not working (serial mode, UM232H)</a></p>

<p>and pylibftdi is installed via pip:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo -H env PATH=$PATH pip install pylibftdi
</code></pre>

<p>It can echo the correct version of libftdi:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -m pylibftdi.examples.info

pylibftdi version     : 0.15.0
libftdi version       : libftdi_version(major=1, minor=0, micro=0, version_str='1.0', snapshot_str='v1.0')
libftdi library name  : libftdi1.so.2

OS platform           : Linux-3.13.0-37-generic-x86_64-with-debian-jessie-sid

<p>However, it won't list any connected FTDI devices, even with <code>sudo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo python -m pylibftdi.examples.list_devices
$ (nothing printed)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to test libftdi and pylibftdi individually? Or, do we already have enough information to get this work? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I have a UINavigationController and a UITabBarController.  The application first opens to a UICollectionView.</p>

<p>When the user makes a selection, it brings up a ScrollView run by a custom UIViewController (""ScrollViewController"").  The ScrollViewController makes four TableViewControllers and puts their TableViews in the ScrollView side by side with paging enabled, and has a floating UIPageControl as well.</p>

<p>Tapping the top bar scrolls the CollectionView to the top, but once I bring up the ScrollView, I can't scroll up from anywhere.  I have tried setting all the TableViews' scrollsToTop to NO, no change.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

I have a web app that I originally wrote for the Blackberry Playbook.  The app works fine on the Playbook and in Chrome and Safari.  However, when I try and run it through XCode with PhoneGap, the app displays on the simulator but does not seem to properly run the database coding (at least I think that is the problem).  I do not get any build errors.</p>

<p>From the documentation, NimbleKit seems to just support its own internal SQLite, but PhoneGap seems to support WebDB, which is what my database is written in.</p>

<p>Finally, the simulator doesn't seem to run some global variables I have (I know, I know, don't use global variables) although that could be because they appear just after my DB initialization at the beginning of my javascript file.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or points in the right direction would be very helpful.  Even if it is to some documentation which can help me debug the app in the iOS sim.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>session_write_close(): Failed to write session data (memcached). Please verify that the current setting of session.save_path is correct (127.0.0.1:11211)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does no happens always, but only for certain users. And this happens on three different servers that have PHP ~5.6 &amp; Memcached on latest Debian. I have tried switching Memcached extension to Memcache (of course with changing save_handler in php.ini), and the problem still persisted. I have also tried disabling session lock in php.ini. The problem is definitely related to PHP, because I have tested Memcached daemon itself with a Perl script, and there was not a single connection error.</p>

<p>Everything was working perfect for a very long time, and I started having this problem right after PHP upgrade, so it's not related with memcached config, or something like this. Maybe I am missing something? Maybe 5.6 requires some additional configs in its ini file? I just cant figure it out. </p>

<p>At the moment I am kind of stuck, and I hope anyone can help me with advice. I can try switching back to 5.4, or to 5.5, but that's not really an option, I would really like to stick to 5.6.</p>

<p>When I run this, I get:</p>

<p>I feel like I shouldn't be attempted to access a deleted row, because I only delete the row after I'm done looking at its values (the <code>parentID</code> and <code>ID</code> column). Does this behave differently than I am understanding? Any ideas why this is happening? If this code should work, maybe the error is somewhere else, but I haven't changed anything else so I would be surprised (I'm trying to add this deleting behavior).</p>

<p>So far my solution involves reading the source of the script tag by loading it with XmlHttpRequest. My problem is that Firefox will not load from cache and always calls out to the server (chrome uses the cache and I haven't started in IE yet). Since my project has thousands of lines of code, making a second request to the server takes unwanted time.</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of a way to make Firefox check the cache? Barring that, is there a way to read the script source directly from the script tag? Is there some other way to get the source that I haven't thought of?</p>

<p>I'm on a phone browser right now, so excuse me if I don't post full html examples, but here is the gist of common scenarios that I'm trying to have a technique to resolve:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a&gt;nav element&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;lots of text in this nav element&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 ... another set of links wwith different text here ... 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
... and another ...
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All told, the above layout would take up exactly three lines all the way across the screen on any screensize or window size.</p>

<p>A simpler example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Wherein not only would the h1 have a width of 100% of the screen (easy) but the text content itself would grow in font-size to fit 100% of the screen.</p>

<p>Similar techniques that I am aware of:</p>

<p>Font-stretch // except it just squashes/stretches text without regard for the text containers</p>

<p>Font-size:5%; // except this deals with the vertical scale of each letter.</p>

<p>text-align:justify; // except it just adds space instead of scaling up the font.</p>

<li>Enums to strings</li>
<li>java.util.Calendar</li>

<p>I have encountered a few different approaches for creating my custom converters:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As described <a href=""http://magicmonster.com/kb/prg/java/spring/webmvc/jackson_custom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> more or less, create a custom ObjectMapper:</p>

<p>public class CustomObjectMapper extends ObjectMapper...</p></li>

<p>Then adding MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter to my servlet-context and register it with my custom ObjectMapper:</p>

<p>
      
          
              
          
      
  </p>

<p>Then i guess I need to have some specific implementations in my custom objectMapper (how should it look like?).</p>

<li>A second approach talks about extending FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean and create my own converters (a class that implements org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter) as described <a href=""http://jpgmr.wordpress.com/tag/conversion-service/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>UPDATE 1:
Another approach I have seen is to subcalss MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter and override getJavaType method, as described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/6173511/887343"">here</a>. To do this I will have to add my custom converter to the list of converters:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean class=""org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter""&gt;
&lt;property name=""messageConverters""&gt;
    &lt;list&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;

<p>Which approach is the recommended one? Are these the only ones, is there a better way of doing it?</p>

<p>I still don't get it. In practice, suppose I have class A and class B.</p>

<p>1) Create a new VB ActiveX DLL project. Left all options as default apart from turning on binary compatibility. Added a class with a simple method called ""SayHello"".<br />
2) Create a new c# Console app in Vs.NET 2008 (SP1). Set the CPU to x86, and added a reference to my COM DLL.<br />

4) Call my SayHello method from the c# console app - all works.<br />
5) Manually un-register the COM dll with regsvr32 /u<br />
6) Try running the console app again. The app fails with a COM error because it can't find the COM registration information. I can confirm that the manifest is present (pasted below)    </p>

<p>I have tried to put a transparent button in that section and add it as a subview to the search bar. However the button is underneath the tabl view area, so when the table view is clicked, the search bar loses focus and the uibutton is only then accessible. </p>

<p>It is pretty the same situation, a huge deployed database and it is not possible to normalise it due to old legacy applications. New rows are constantly added and old ones are removed fulfiling certain criterias.
I have tried the suggestion by using CTE and I see no performance gain here, 
pretty the same execution time as for the original </p>

<pre><code>select distinct [somecolumn] 
from bigtable
</code></pre>

<p>Same applies for the suggestion to use <code>Group by</code>.</p>

<p>What seems to work best is the suggestion to create a view and query the view instead. (the cache has been reseted between queries)</p>

<p>I need some advice here on this because I do not really understand why this results in better performance.</p>

<pre><code>create view [dbo].[vwDistinct]
with schemabinding
as 
   select 
      [somecolumn], count_big(*) as TableCount
   from 
      dbo.BigTable 
   where
      somecolumn IS NOT NULL
   group by 
      somecolumn;

select distinct somecolumn 
from vwDistinct
</code></pre>

<p>The application uses a stored procedure for the call. The database is on SQL Server 2008 R2 but if there is good reason, it can be moved to SQL Server 2014.</p>

<pre><code>// FILL IN isPressed FOR THOSE PRESSED

{

</code></pre>

<p>One problem I noticed today is that it doesn't work on certain key conbinations, For example, I have right arrow key for moving right, Z for boosting speed, and X for junping. So one could press the VK_RIGHT to move forward, while pressing Z when X is held down will boost the speed (Z+RIGHT) and pressing X along with the held down of Z and RIGHT will make a boost jump (Z+X+RIGHT). </p>

<p>But the problem is this combination doesn't work, once RIGHT and Z keys are held down X no longer works, in fact it doesn't work with many other keys, from my test only Alt key works for this situation. </p>

<p>I then did some research, I found that while the game is not working with this conbination, it works for LEFT+Z+X. And if I change key Z to S, it now works for conbination RIGHT+S+X but not LEFT+S+X, just the very opposite of my first conbination. So I start to doubt there are some underlying stuff affecting different combinations.</p>

<p>I have also read that some keyboards use a matrix decoder and certain combinations of keys 
cause ambiguous results because of shared lines, which may be indicated by the beep warning, but this clearly shouldn't be my case. But I have no idea why this happen and how to solve it. Please help. I'm on WIN8 with alienwareM17x keyboard.</p>

<p>However the callback is always false regardless of if the passwords match or not. Does anyone have any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="""" onclick=""event.preventDefault()""&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=""anchor""&gt;
    Anchor
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the page is loaded with no # fragment in the URL, clicking the link executes the onclick javascript, which suppresses the action of the link, and (as expected) nothing happens.</p>

<p>However, if the page is loaded with a valid URL fragment, #anchor in the above example, then clicking on the link causes the page to jump to the paragraph with id 'anchor' (like when the page was initially loaded).</p>

<p>I cannot find a way round this; any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

"1765766","1","1773574","","2009-11-19 19:07:13","","3","5501","<p>Consider the following simple RESTEasy (JAX-RS) service:</p>

<pre><code>@Path(""/example-service"")
public interface ExampleService {

    @Path(""/ping"")
    @GET
    public String ping(String message);

}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to define JAXRS specifics on the interface rather than the class so I can use the nice client framework, ie:</p>

<pre><code>ExampleService client = ProxyFactory.create(ExampleService.class, ""http://localhost:8080"");
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works well, except for when I want to introduce some of RESTEasy's context injections, ie: @Context.  Naively, consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>@Path(""/example-service"")
public interface ExampleService {

    @Path(""/ping"")
    @GET
    public String ping(@Context HttpServletRequest request, String message);

}
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously doesn't make sense because this @Context injection is orthogonal and doesn't belong on the interface (furthermore, even if I can get past the ugliness of this interface from the client perspective and pass null, there is currently a bug preventing this from working: <a href=""https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/RESTEASY-311"" rel=""nofollow"">RESTEASY-311</a>)</p>

<p>How can I use interface JAXRS markup (and therefore leverage the nice RESTEasy client framework) and access orthogonal @Context injections at the same time?</p>

"26304864","1","26307937","","2014-10-10 17:25:33","","0","376","<p>Best way to describe the problem I'm trying to solve is to talk in code. I see a lot of __arglist questions on this forum, but not a lot of helpful answers. I know _arglist should be avoided so I'm open to alternative methods</p>

<p>In one C++ module I have something like the following</p>

<pre><code>void SomeFunction(LPCWSTR pszFormat, va_args args)
{
    // this function is not exported...
    // it is designed to take a format specifier and a list of variable 
    // arguments and ""printf"" it into a buffer. This code 
    // allocates buffer and uses _vsnwprintf_s to format the 
    // string. 
    // I really do not have much flexibility to rewrite this function
    // so please steer away from scrutinizing this. it is what is 
    // and I need to call it from C#.

    ::_vsnwprintf_s(somebuff, buffsize, _TRUNCATE, pszFormat, args)
}

__declspec(dllexport) void __cdecl ExportedSomeFunction(LPCWSTR pszFormat, ...)
{
    // the purpose of this method is to export SomeFunction to C# code.
    // it handles any marshaling. I can change this however it makes sense
    va_list args ;
    va_start(args, pszFormat) ;
    SomeFunction(pszFormat, args) ;
    va_end(args) ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>in another C# module I have code that handles all marshalling to the C++ DLL.
The intent is to hide all complexity of Native APIs and marshalling from user code. 
The ultimate goal being a C++ developer or C# developer make the SAME API calls, but the code is written once and exported to both </p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""mymodule.dll"", CallingConvention=CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
private static extern void ExportedSomeFunction(
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)] out string strPath, 
        /* ? what goes here ? */);
void SomeFunction(string strFormat, /*? what goes here ?*/ )
{
    // handles marshalling incoming data to what ever is needed by exported C function
    ExportedSomeFunction(strFormat, /*? something ?*/ ) ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the user code in some other module should look like this...</p>

<pre><code>SomeFunction(""my format: %ld, %s"", 5, ""Some Useless string"") ;
</code></pre>

<p>That would be ideal, but am prepared to live with</p>

<pre><code>SomeFunction(""my format: %ld, %s"", __arglist(5, ""Some Useless string"")) ;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't care how the data gets marshaled. If I use __arglist or some array, I don't care as long as I end up with a va_args</p>

<p>__arglist looks like the solution, and I can successfully call</p>

<pre><code>ExportedSomeFunction(strFormat, __arglist(5, ""Some Useless string"")) ;
</code></pre>

<p>But I cannot figure out how to call the C# SomeFunction with variable arguments and pass a __arglist to the  exported function.</p>

<pre><code>SomeFunction(""my format: %ld, %s"", __arglist(5, ""Some Useless string"")) ;
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot get this to work....</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""mymodule.dll"", CallingConvention=CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
private static extern void ExportedSomeFunction(
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)] out string strPath, 
         __arglist);
void SomeFunction(string strFormat, __arglist )
{
    ExportedSomeFunction(strFormat,  __arglist) ;  // error cannot convert from RuntimeArgumentHandle to __arglist
}
</code></pre>

<p>This compiles, but doesn't produce the desired results. The argument list received in C++ is wrong.</p>

<pre><code>private static extern void ExportedSomeFunction(
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)] out string strPath, 
         RuntimeArgumentHandle args);

The main idea of the application is to have a grid of flat colored tiles that individually can be flipped. The problem that im having is that I can't really figure out how to do the flip rotation around the tiles individual central axis.</p>

<p>The thing that is happening now is that the tiles rotates around the worlds axis instead of its own.</p>

<p>Each tile consists of an array of vertices that creates a two-dimensional square in the 3D-world.</p>

<p>I'm pretty certain that the problem has to do with me messing up with the matrices.</p>

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; vertices.Length; i++)
            vertices[i].Position = position;

        vertices[0].Position += new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
        vertices[0].Color = Color.Pink;
        vertices[1].Position += new Vector3(0, size, 0);
        vertices[1].Color = Color.Yellow;
        vertices[2].Position += new Vector3(0, size, size);
        vertices[2].Color = Color.Green;

        vertices[3].Position += new Vector3(0, size, size);
        vertices[3].Color = Color.Green;
        vertices[4].Position += new Vector3(0, 0f, size);
        vertices[4].Color = Color.Blue;
        vertices[5].Position += new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
        vertices[5].Color = Color.Blue;
    }

    public VertexPositionColor[] Vertices
    {
        get{ return Functions.TransformVertices((VertexPositionColor[])vertices.Clone(), GetMatrix()); }
    }

    private Matrix GetMatrix()
    {
        return Matrix.CreateRotationZ(rot);
    }


    private void TransformVertices(Matrix matrix)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; vertices.Length; i++)

Thatswhy I stumbled over an effect, I cannot explain. I thought, Windsor is tracking every resolved component by default (<code>LifecycledComponentsReleasePolicy</code>), but when I look at the debugger output, this doesn't always seem to be the case.</p>

<p>There are, for example, two classes (out of a bunch), like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ViewOne : UserControl, ITabPageView
{...}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>public class ViewSecond : TabPageBase, ITabPageView&lt;A&gt;, ITabPageView
{...}
</code></pre>

<p>where:</p>

<pre><code>public class TabPageBase : UserControl, ITabPageView
{...}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>public interface ITabPageView&lt;T&gt; : ITabPageView
{...}
</code></pre>

<p>Both of the View-classes are registered via the same component registration (by convention), like this:</p>

<pre><code>Container.Register( 
  Classes.FromThisAssembly()
    .BasedOn&lt;ITabPageView&gt;()
    .WithServices(typeof(ITabPageView)
    .Configure(...setting the name of the component...)
    .LifestyleTransient()
</code></pre>

<p>So, when I now resolve an instance of the first class</p>

<pre><code>_container.Resolve&lt;ITabPageView&gt;(""ViewOne"");  // this is for explanation purposes only, not intended for production
</code></pre>

<p>I get an instance and a look into the debugger-out put of the container shows, that right this instance is 'tracked by release policy'.</p>

<p>When I now do the exact same thing with the name of the second class (ViewSecond), I also get a correct instance for class ViewSecond, but this doesn't show up in 'tracked by release policy'. More strange is, that some dependencies of ViewSecond are obviously tracked, but again not all of them. Some digging through the code of Windsor revealed, that instances are tracked, when their <code>Burden</code> is created with <code>requiresDecommission=true</code> and <code>trackedExternally=false</code> but I could not find a case, where <code>requiresDecommission</code> would be <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Could anyone give me a hint, if there is something wrong or where I may continue my search for enabling tracking for ALL of my components? Or is the debugger output just plain wrong?</p>

<p>I am deliberating trying not to use KeyCode.NUMBER_PAD_X to detect number pad key presses, because that is only a feature of API 11 and up, and I seek higher compatibility with similar features. Similarly, detecting special characters like ( ) + - / # , . is a built in function of API 11 and up.</p>

<p>On some Android phones below Android 3.0/API 11 , the numeric keypad/phone pad also has special characters on it, that the API simply won't ignore. On the G2, only some special characters are ignored, but it allows for ( ) + - / # to be input into the EditText field, my character catcher does not notice these inputs even though they are outside of the range for that condition, and I can't use the API 11 level KeyCodes to explicitly detect them</p>

<p>Any solutions on how to detect them? </p>

<p>It is problematic that the user can input them and that they appear in the text field, yet none of my code detects them nor do they register in the debugger. It messes with my other error handling conditions which currently check to see how long a string is, the user may be able to overflow the strings with these characters</p>

<p>I managed to extract the mandatory parameters common to all strings, but I have trouble with optional parameters not necessarily present for all strings. As far as I found out, Bash doesn't support Non-capturing parentheses which I would use for this purpose.</p>

<p>Here is what I achieved thus far:</p>

<pre><code>CATEGORY_REGEX='Category:\s*([^;]*);scheme=""([^""]*)"";class=""([^""]*)"";'
category_string='Category: entity;scheme=""http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core#"";class=""kind"";title=""Entity"";attributes=""occi.core.id occi.core.title"";'

<p>The (cloudy, no pun intended) answer seems to be that 4.5.2 should be supported as of many months ago (though <a href=""https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/9eab0cd9-c312-4901-95e6-5df2a29f7135/how-to-build-and-deploy-web-or-worker-roles-using-net-452?forum=windowsazuredevelopment"" rel=""nofollow"">other sources</a> say only 4.5.1 is supported), but my Cloud Deployment Projects don't build (using SDK 2.5) and I hear others complaining of similar issues, but I can't find mention of anyone who has successfully made a 4.5.2 deployment work.</p>

<p>I can not understand what 'singular' means. According to this <a href=""http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/solve"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>, it is said that if <code>solve</code> does not have second parameter, it inverts first parameter. </p>

<p>I've been trying hard to find the right syntax to correctly create a java string array in C (i.e., an array of jstring objects, i.e. an object which represents an array of jstring objects). I've been using the following resources and from them I've constructed code which compiles. I'm not sure if the error which occurs afterwards is due to the syntax being incorrect or because of a completely separate reason. Since the code is mostly in isolation I'm assuming the syntax is incorrect.</p>

<p>(<a href=""http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Programming/JDCBook/jnistring.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Suns Native Programming Documentation</a> &amp; <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jni/html/objtypes.html#30918"" rel=""nofollow"">Suns JNI documentation</a>) </p>

<p>The code compiles but after passing the ""FindClass"" line of code a SIGSEGV signal is sent which kills the C process:</p>

<pre><code>jint size = 5;
jclass StringObject = (*env)-&gt;FindClass(env, ""java/lang/String"");
jobjectArray sampleMessage = (*env)-&gt;NewObjectArray(env, size, StringObject, NULL);
jobjectArray returnArray = (jobjectArray) (*env)-&gt;NewObjectArray(env, messageCount, &amp;sampleMessage, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Could anyone point me to a useful resource for this? Or confirm the syntax is correct.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I large part of my problem was that debugging this code caused the problem. I don't have time to narrow down the reproducing factor but stepping over JNI code in a gdb-client through eclipse DOESN'T work.</p>

<p>It works fine so far. I can use the endpoint to login/register on any site. If I am not logged in on the SMF, it will ask for my login and if that SMF login is successful, it accepts it.</p>

<p>However, it seems that it doesn't differ between different SMF logins. I.e. another user reported that he tried to use the endpoint on site X, logged in with his SMF account and landed on my user account on site X (I have registered the OpenID endpoint earlier on that site).</p>

<p>I guess I must send somehow the SMF login or make it somehow unique per SMF login. As it is probably trivial what I have to do, I thought I'd ask here on SO -- maybe there are also more things I need to fix.</p>

<p>The code (just PHP), if you want to take a look, is here:
<a href=""http://github.com/albertz/smf-openid-server"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/albertz/smf-openid-server</a></p>

<p>Or maybe just describe what I need to do to make it unique for each SMF login.</p>

<p>Another project I am planning is an OpenID client in a multiplayer C++ game. The hoster will have the option to allow only logins from people who can authenticate via OpenID. Also I want to make it possible to allow only certain people to login. What is a common way to get a unique string based on an OpenID login? In this case, I thought of something like <code>http://{smf-openid-endpoint}/{smf-user}</code> or <code>http://www.google.de/profiles/{google-user}</code>. What is a canonical way to get such a string?</p>

<p>I think this other question may be related to my main question, that is why I am putting it also here.</p>

<p>Now my intial guess is... no chance in VB6.</p>

<p>So my thoughts turned to a VB.net interop dll. Could I do it in here, and then call the interop dll from the VB?</p>

<p>Again, my guess would be no.... but I'd be happy if someone knew differently.</p>

<p>The only thing that I think would actually work would be DI in .Net, but I'm limited to .net 2, or 3.5 at a big push, so I dont know if that is possible.</p>

<p><strong>So for the background....</strong></p>

<p>I have a dll that a specific site uses, but we dont want to ship that out to everyone. Instead, we want to build a clone dll which just has the interfaces setup so that the VB6 build will complete.
When it gets to the site that needs it, they want to replace the dummy dll, and drop in their version instead.</p>

<p>Note: We do use RegFreeCOM when its gets installed, so I do have the manifest files that I could play around with if needed.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be much appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>class SessionConnection
{

private:
    SessionHandle sessionHandle;
    RemoteSessionHandle remoteSessionHandle;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Its ctor is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SessionConnection::SessionConnection(whatever) :
..., sessionHandle{some_more_whatever}, remoteSessionHandle{sessionHandle}, ...
{
...
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>RemoteSessionHandle</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class RemoteSessionHandle
{
...
private:
    SessionHandle* sessionHandle;
};

RemoteSessionHandle::RemoteSessionHandle(SessionHandle const&amp; pSessionHandle) :
..., sessionHandle{&amp;pSessionHandle}
{
...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These classes have more members, but I'm trying to stick to the point.</p>

<p>Upon construction, <code>SessionConnection</code> injects <code>sessionHandle</code> into <code>remoteSessionHandle</code>, which keeps a pointer to it.</p>

<p>However, I then have a problem with the move constructor. Before a move, I have this:</p>

<pre><code>movedFromSessionConnection           movedToSessionConnection
+------------------------------+     +----------------------------+
| movedFromSessionHandle       |     | movedToSessionHandle       |
|            ^                 |     |            ^               |
|            |                 |     |            |               |
| movedFromRemoteSessionHandle |     | movedToRemoteSessionHandle |
+------------------------------+     +----------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Each RemoteSessionHandle points to its SessionHandle. After a move, I get this:</p>

<pre><code>movedFromSessionConnection --- mv ---&gt; movedToSessionConnection
+------------------------------+     +----------------------------+
| movedFromSessionHandle ---- mv ----&gt; movedToSessionHandle       |
|            ^ -----------------------------------+               |
|                                                 |               |
| movedFromRemoteSessionHandle - mv -&gt; movedToRemoteSessionHandle |
+------------------------------+     +----------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>The contents of <code>movedFromRemoteSessionHandle</code> are moved to <code>movedToRemoteSessionHandle</code>, so it now points to <code>movedFromSessionHandle</code>. Which is in an unknown state, after being moved to <code>movedToSessionHandle</code>.</p>

<p>I've considered the following solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Exclude the pointer from RemoteSessionHandle's move ctor. I find this a bit ""smelly"", since I've yet to find an example of a move ctor that doesn't move - or act upon - all data members.</li>
<li>Remove SessionHandle from SessionConnection, and make it a member of
RemoteSessionHandle, instead.</li>
<li>Implement a ""regular"" move ctor in RemoteSessionHandle (""regular""
meaning moving all the data members), and have SessionConnection's move ctor
reseat the pointer in RemoteSessionHandle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Options 2 and 3 are possible in this context, because these classes are strongly coupled by design. However, I've then considered what could I do if that weren't the case.</p>

<p>I've looked all over the web, and I found no one else with this problem, so my first instinct would be to believe I'm overlooking something pretty obvious (or I lack the google-fu for this particular search).</p>

<p>Am I overlooking anything obvious? Is this a non-problem, easily solved by whatever I may be overlooking?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Following Igor's comment, I've decided to add some more context. I'm using these classes to create a libssh2 session using boost.asio. The creation of a libssh2 session goes through several states, and setup and shutdown are symmetric enough that I can use RAII to manage it (I detailed it <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13287601/constructor-destructor-order-dependencies-between-data-members"" title=""here"">here</a>).</p>

<p>RemoteSessionHandle needs SessionHandle because the latter owns the <code>LIBSSH2_SESSION*</code> that will be required by the former to operate, hence the dependency.</p>

$cylinder-&gt;serie     = ??;
$cylinder-&gt;seriesap  = ??;
$cylinder-&gt;type      = ??;
$cylinder-&gt;admission = ??;
$cylinder-&gt;invoice   = ??;
$cylinder-&gt;save
</code></pre>

<p>How can i accomplish this task and save all the cylinders?</p>

<p>I have tried all the foreach's that i could think of nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>/<em>edit</em>/</p>

<p>This is what Im doing so far:</p>

<pre><code>$cyldata = $_POST['cylinder']; //this is the post from top.

$num_elements = 0;

while($num_elements &lt; count($cyldata['serie'])){
    $cylinder = new Cylinder();
    $cylinder-&gt;serie     = $cyldata['serie'][$num_elements];
    $cylinder-&gt;type      = $cyldata['type'][$num_elements];
    $cylinder-&gt;admission = $cyldata['admission'][$num_elements];
    $cylinder-&gt;seriesap  = $cyldata['seriesap'][$num_elements];         
    $cylinder-&gt;save
    $num_elements++;

}
</code></pre>

<p>But it feels ugly, all those saves doesnt feel right. Dirty solution if you ask me.</p>

<p>Currently I'm stuck at how can I determine which of the PCI function's BAR(Base address registers) contain the base address(ie data port address) for that parallel port? :?</p>

<p>Precisely, is there a industry convention or standard or de-facto standard that a particular BAR will always contain the base address for that parallel port ?</p>

<p>If not, then how can I determine the base address for that PCI parallel port(whether on pci expansion card or integrated on mobo)?</p>

<p>Actually I'm concerned with parallel ports on <em>PCI expansion cards</em>. AFAIK, BIOS doesn't know about these. BIOS will only allocate resources to the pci card(s) and that's it. So, there might not be the entries for such parallel ports in BDA, as BIOS manufacturer knows only about ALL the devices their mobo has.</p>

<p>For eg, say on a PC, I installed 4 parallel ports on pci expansion card(s) , and there is 1 parallel port integrated\embedded on mobo. Now where does the entry for other 2 parallel ports go?</p>

<p>That's why it seems that the BIOS has entries only for <em>three</em> parallel ports integrated \ embedded on chipset or motherboard. So, I think we must read PCI BARs to get the base address for any parallel port on pci expansion card installed on mobo.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><code>index.php</code> here is the router, as is apparently cool to do nowadays.</p>

<p>Whenever the user requests a page like <code>example.com/test/stylesheet.css</code>, I want to check to see if <code>assets/</code> has that file, and if so, serve that file instead of giving the URL to <code>index.php</code>. Ideally, the following would work:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond assets/%{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule ^(.+)$ assets/$1
</code></pre>

<p>But since <code>%{REQUEST_FILENAME}</code> is an absolute path, <code>assets/%{REQUEST_FILENAME}</code> turns out to be something like <code>assets/home/public/test/stylesheet.css</code>. <code>%{REQUEST_URI}</code> is no better: it turns into <code>assets/test/stylesheet.css</code>.

<p>Is there any way, without resorting to PHP, to do this? (If not, I'll just use PHP's <code>readfile</code>, but I don't want to worry about LFI or anything.)</p>

<p>&lt;Edit&gt;I've added simple code at the base of this question which demonstrates the issue, without any slashes&lt;/Edit&gt;</p>

<p>I'm working within a system which is relatively fixed and which provides xpath as a query language.  The system is based on .net 4.5.</p>

<p>I'm attempting to join two sets of data.  The first set of data is in the form:</p>

<pre><code>Aa1
Aa2
Aa3
etc
</code></pre>

<p>The second set of data is in the form:</p>

<pre><code>Ab1
Ab2
Ab3
etc
</code></pre>

<p>I've attempted to manipulate the first dataset I've got back by doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>someContextNode.SelectSingleNode(""../translate(@reference,'a','b')"")
</code></pre>

<p>...but I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>XPathException: '../translate(@reference,'a','b')' has invalid token.
</code></pre>

<p>Fine, fine: so, as I'm only after a single result, I tried:</p>

<pre><code>someContextNode.SelectSingleNode(""translate(../@reference,'a','b')"")
</code></pre>

<p>... but I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>XPathException: Expression must evaluate to a node-set.
</code></pre>

<p>Reading up, this seems to be a limitation of Xpath 1.0; If I has xpath 2, I could tokenize.</p>

<p>My question is: Is there a dodge for this (being able to manipulate outputs) I've not found, as it seems to be quite a fundamental weakness in Xpath 1.0.</p>

<p>Example code which reproduces the issue:</p>

<pre><code>    Dim doc As New System.Xml.XmlDocument
    doc.LoadXml(""&lt;Data reference=""""Aa1""""&gt;&lt;Subnode /&gt;&lt;/Data&gt;"")

    Dim startNode As System.Xml.XmlNode = doc.ChildNodes(0).SelectSingleNode(""Subnode"")

    Dim trans1ex As System.Exception = Nothing
    Try
        Dim trans1 As System.Xml.XmlNode = startNode.SelectSingleNode(""translate(../@reference,'a','b')"")
    Catch ex As Exception
        trans1ex = ex
    End Try
    Dim trans2ex As System.Exception = Nothing
    Try
        Dim trans2 As System.Xml.XmlNode = startNode.SelectSingleNode(""../translate(@reference,'a','b')"")
    Catch ex As Exception
        trans2ex = ex
    End Try

    Dim trans3 As System.Xml.XmlNode = startNode.SelectSingleNode(""../@reference"")

    Stop
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of executing this code, the two local exception objects will contain objects which are as described above.  The local trans3 object will successfully point to an attribute node.  I believe that the issue with both exceptions is that SelectSingleNode isn't expecting a function, it's expecting a node.  My question is (assuming I'm not doing anything stupid), is it possible using .net and xpath 1 to dodge this in some way by using a different xpath expression?</p>

The effect is if you are writing very simplistic examples it works fine but in the real world,  you would like to reference that bound object in other objects.  This is undesirable.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>    var myComplexObject = {}:

    var fbUrl = new Firebase(url);
    $scope.items = $firebase(fbUrl);
    $scope.items.$on(""loaded"", function() {
        $scope.items.$bind($scope, ""remoteItems"").then( function(unbind){
           myComplexObject.myData = $scope.remoteItems;
        });
</code></pre>

<p>Initial state:  myComplextObject.myData === $scope.remoteItems evals to: true;</p>

<p>This pseudo code will work ( 3way binding functionality ) up until there is a 'change' event ( which could be trigger by remote change ).  Once the change occurrs,  $scope.remoteItems will be populated but now the connection to myComplexObjext is broken.  Hence: 
Post change state: myComplextObject.myData === $scope.remoteItems evals to: false;</p>

<p>Any thoughts here?  Is this a function of javascript?  In C it would easier to implement with pointers,  maybe this is not possible in javascript.  I know that I could add a watch and re-assign but this is undesirable and unmanageable.  As I have created a service that frontends all connectivity to firebase.  </p>

<p>If I have missed something conceptually let me know.</p>

It toggles open and toggles closed the divs. The problem is that in the default Android browser when you open the menu for the first time it moves left and exposes a large gap on the right side of the menu. It is like the menu is shrinking in width. If I close and re-open the menu the menu will have the 100% width like it is supposed to. It does not do this in Firefox Android browser. Just the default browser. Aside from the width being smaller everything else is fine</p>

<p>The second is a custom app that I've written that I would like to somehow subscribe to the ""OnEmailSent"" even of the first application.</p>

<p>Is there any way that I could somehow attach the second application to an instance of the first application to listen for ""OnEmailSent"" event?</p>

<hr>

<p>So for further clarification, my specific scenario is that we have a custom third party application written in c# that raises an ""OnEmailSent"" event. We can see the event exists using reflector.</p>

<p>What we want to do is have some other actions take place when this component sends an email.</p>

<p>The most efficient way we can think of would be to be able to use some form of IPC as anders has suggested and listen for the OnEmailSent event being raised by the third party component.</p>

<p>Because the component is written in C# we are toying with the idea of writing another C# application that can attach itself to the executing process and when it detect the OnEmailSent event has been raise it will execute it's own event handling code.</p>

<hr>

<p>I might be missing something, but from what I understand of how remoting works is that there would need to be a server defining some sort of contract that the client can subscribe to.</p>

<p>I was more thinking about a scenario where someone has written a standalone application like outlook for example, that exposes events that I would like to subscribe to from another application.</p>

<p>I guess the scenario I'm thinking of is the .net debugger and how it can attach to executing assemblies to inspect the code whilst it's running.</p>

In the past, this has been a simple implementation; I would simply call the source command using RPy2 from python and the tcltk gui would load.</p>

<p>However, it now seems this is not the case. I realize that tkinter is not multithreaded and this is the reason <em>my GUI now freezes.</em></p>

<p>To combat this, I have attempted to create another thread in python (containing the ""source"" command) which acts as another thread and uses the queue function. Now, the tcltk gui from the R source command runs and is not frozen (since it has the ability to update or refresh, if you will); however, the source command is called in an infinite loop resulting in multiple instances of the R Gui being started. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a way I can call the source command only once, but have the GUI maintain its ability to accept input?</strong></p>

<p>Here is the code so far which was adapted from an example I found:</p>

<ol>
<li>Making a remote database connection using the JDBC driver.</li>
<li>Using a server side script to update the database and call it using a GET or POST.</li>
</ol>

<p>Q1. I think 1st option may be a high security risk and there is a possibility of endangering the whole database. Am I right?</p>

<p>Q2. Is the 2nd way better for the task or are there other ways around.</p>

<p>The overallWrap is a div that is the total srceen size i want to display. The inside will be whit and the outside black so it will look like a big white rectangle in the middle of a black screen. Then ive made a smaller backgroundWrap div to fit inside the overallWrap with margin borders on the top of 12px and the left 10px. My problem is when I look at it in the browser or live view the code in the backgroundWrap for margin top does nothing so i cant see a 12px white strip if that makes sense. aarrgh its driving me made. Any help would be great thanks.  </p>

<p>The parameters are such: </p>

<ul>
<li>The combo-box is unbound, has 2 columns, one with IDs and one with Names.</li>
<li>The text-box is bound to a foreign key of IDs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I've searched the web and found that most people want to either populate text-boxed based on combo-box selection, or populate a combo-box based on another combo-box or a text-box. Nothing on SELECTING a certain value in a combo-box based on a text-box.</p>

<p>The reason I want this is so that the user is able to either select customer by name (using combo-box and the text-box will automatically update with his ID, I already did that using the After Update event). Or directly enter customer's ID in text-box, and the combo-box will automatically display customer's name.</p>

<p>How should I go about this? Is there a better approach to achieve the result I am looking for? I want the combo-box to display the name immediately as the number is typed, so also please advise where I should place the code (text-box On Change event, perhaps?).</p>

<p>I have an idea for possibly making it real-time by limiting combo-box rows as the user types the ID, AND select the first value of those limited rows. So for example, as the user types ""12"" in the text-box, the combo-box rows are limited using SELECT query to only those names whose IDs begin with 12, AND the name with ID ""12"" is automatically selected.</p>

<p>My service method to insert/update looks something like this (the repository is injected in the service constructor via IoC):</p>

<pre><code>public void UpdateData(Guid id, int newValue)
{
    MyPoco poco = _repository.FirstOrDefault(p =&gt; p.Id = id);

    if (poco == null)
    {
        poco = new Poco 
        {
            //set properties
        };

        _repository.Add(poco);
    }

    poco.SomeFieldToUpdate = newValue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my changes get persisted via my UnitOfWork on a UseUnitOfWorkAttribute action filter on my controller:</p>

<pre><code>void IResultFilter.OnResultExecuted(ResultExecutedContext filterContext)
{
    var unitOfWork = IoCFactory.Instance.CurrentContainer.Resolve&lt;IUnitOfWork&gt;();
    unitOfWork.Commit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this works fine if this is ever hit just once, for existing or new data.  And it works fine on multiple passes if it already exists.  </p>

<p>But if the Guid value doesn't exist in the table, then it tries to do multiple inserts if this is called multiple times.</p>

<p>So that's my dilemma. I understand why this doesn't work, I'm just not sure the proper way to fix it.  Basically, I need to somehow get a reference to the existing POCO in the UnitOfWork, and somehow update it.  But the UnitOfWork is not available in my service (by design) -- and I'm not even sure I know how to pull an entity out of the UoW and update it anyway.</p>

<p>Am I going about this wrong or am I overlooking something simple here?  Or do I have a fundamental flaw in how I've designed this? I have a feeling I may be making this harder than it should be.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<pre><code>gcc -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include -g -O2 -o test test-test.o -lglib-2.0
</code></pre>

<p>The challenge is that I can't figure out how to force Autotools to generate the command line in the right order. For the sake of clarity, I've reproduced the simple test case here. First up is <code>configure.ac</code>:</p>

<pre><code>dnl Process this file with autoconf to produce a configure script.

AC_PREREQ(2.59)
AC_INIT(glib-test, 1.0)

AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE()

AC_PROG_CC
AM_PROG_CC_C_O
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(GLIB, glib-2.0 &gt; 2.0)
AC_CONFIG_FILES(Makefile)
AC_OUTPUT
</code></pre>

<p>Next is the simple <code>Makefile.am</code>:</p>

<pre><code>CFLAGS=-Wall
bin_PROGRAMS=test
test_CFLAGS=$(GLIB_CFLAGS)
test_LDFLAGS=$(GLIB_LIBS)
test_SOURCES=test.c
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, the source code to this minimal test case, <code>test.c</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;glib.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    gchar *foo = g_malloc(100);
    g_free(foo);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compilation is then achieved using the following series of commands:</p>

<pre><code>touch NEWS README AUTHORS ChangeLog
aclocal
autoconf
automake --add-missing
./configure
make
</code></pre>

<p>I should be clear, I understand why my code won't compile, I'm just wondering how to get <code>automake</code> to put the libraries at the end of the command line so <code>gcc</code> will execute and link properly. It should be noted that <code>gcc</code> on Mac OS X Lion doesn't seem to have this problem.</p>

In the application I am using a Sql Server localdb connection to a database to store information.  This is working fine on several computers, all of which have Visual Studio installed.</p>

<p>I would like to deploy a program that only has to install the Sql Server Express LocalDB, and not the larger Sql Server Express.  However, my application is not running on the target computers.  I have installed Sql Server Express LocalDB 2014 on a target computer.  I can, using a command line, run commands using sqllocaldb to verify that it is installed and running.</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\someuser\Desktop\Debug&gt;sqllocaldb v
Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (12.0.2000.8)`
</code></pre>

<p>When I run my application on that same target computer, however, I get the following error.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The following is the beginning of my config.app file, where I am defining the connection string.  I have tried putting in the direct file path to the LM file, but that didn't fix the issue.  That was to be expected, however, as the program works from any directory on the computers with Visual Studio installed.</p>

I'm trying to have a draggable rectangle to show the user an area that they've selected in my screenshot program.  The reason I want this is for users to be able to select a portion of the screen that they want to take a screenshot of.  I have tried the following method with little success:</p>

<pre><code>void drawRect(){
HDC screenDC = ::GetDC(0);
::Rectangle(screenDC, 200, 200, 300, 300);
::ReleaseDC(0, screenDC);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to give this method due credit, it does draw a rectangle to the screen in a way that I'd expect however once the dragging has stopped the rectangle persists.  I've looked at ways of getting rid of this such as updating the windows where the rectangle continues to be shown however I haven't managed to remove it.  Further to this problem since you must redraw the rectangle every monitor refresh and the rectangles persist, I am left with lots of rectangles being drawn all over the screen and I then have to mouse over or click on any windows these are drawn over to remove them.</p>

I'm using <code>preg_replace_callback</code> to grab the ::identifiers and :identifiers from the query string, and then sending it to a sanitization function. The problem is, I also need to send the values array, so that the function can take the match from the regexp, get the item in the values array with that key, escape the value, wrap it in the right quotes and then return it.</p>

<p>But I can't pass any extra information to the callback. I could use a private static variable but this is very <em>hacky</em>.</p>

<p>Given the following markup and CSS:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class=""constrained""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""content""&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>* { box-sizing: border-box; }
.constrained {
    border: 1px solid blue;
    min-height: 300px;
    padding: 10px;
    overflow-x: auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>div.constrained</code> renders appropriately at 300px height (278px inner height) when the page loads. When new content is injected into <code>div.content</code> via JavaScript, the <code>div.constrained</code> container grows to 322px height, as if the box-sizing were no longer applied.</p>

<p>JSFiddle demonstration:
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/eafztwb2/16/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/eafztwb2/16/</a></p>

<p>This only occurs with overflow values of <code>auto</code>, <code>visible</code> or <code>scroll</code>. Setting the <code>overflow-x</code> to <code>hidden</code>, or <code>inherit</code> (so long as inherit doesn't end up evaluating to one of the former) does not show the problem.</p>

<p>This isn't a question so much as knowledge-sharing, but I'd be interested in solutions that work around this while still allowing <code>overflow-x: auto</code>.</p>

The best way so far is <code>!dumpheap -stat</code>, but it only lists types for which there are instances.
However, when a ValueType is never boxed, that type will not show up on <code>!dumpheap -stat</code>. (Which isn't surprising, as they aren't allocated on the heap.)</p>

<p>So my question is:
Are there any efficient ways to figure out which additional ValueTypes currently exist?
I mean, I could load them on-demand when inspecting individual heap objects (something like <code>!dumpvc &lt;mt&gt; &lt;address&gt;</code> based on <code>!do &lt;address&gt;</code> output), but for displayed statistics it would be nice to find the types through some simpler means than looking at (instances/class definitions of) all known classes to figure out whether they use any additional ValueTypes.</p>

<pre><code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: Monad m =&gt; m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
</code></pre>

<p>To simplify, let's substitute <code>Maybe</code> for <code>m</code>: </p>

<pre><code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
</code></pre>

<p>However, note that the definition <em>could</em> have been written in three different ways:</p>

<pre><code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (      a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (      a -&gt;       b) -&gt; Maybe b
</code></pre>

<p>Of the three the one in the centre is the most asymmetric. However, I understand that the first one is kinda meaningless if we want to avoid (what LYAH calls <em>boilerplate code</em>). However, of the next two, I would prefer the last one. For <code>Maybe</code>, this would look like:</p>

<p>When this is defined as: </p>

<pre><code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe b

instance Monad Maybe where
   Nothing  &gt;&gt;= f = Nothing
   (Just x) &gt;&gt;= f = return $ f x
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>a -&gt; b</code> is an ordinary function. Also, I don't immediately see anything unsafe, because <code>Nothing</code> catches the exception <em>before</em> the function application, so the <code>a -&gt; b</code> function will not be called unless a <code>Just a</code> is obtained. </p>

<p>So maybe there is something that isn't apparent to me which has caused the <code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b</code> definition to be preferred over the much simpler <code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe b</code> definition? Is there some inherent problem associated with the (what I think is a) simpler definition?</p>

My need is to invoke the python modules pertaining to this graph library from Java code. It goes like this, the core of library is in c. This core has been imported into Python and interfaces to the functions embedded in core are available in Python. My project's rest of the code is in Java and hence I would like to call the graph functions by Java as well.
Jython - which lets you invoke python modules with in Java was an option.I went on trying Jython to discover that it will not work in my case as the core code is in C and Jython wont support anything that is imported as a c dll in python code.I also thought of opting for the approach of calling graph routines directly in c. That is without passing through Python code. I am assuming there must be something which lets you call c code from Java, how ever I am not good in C hence I did not go for it.
My last resort seems to execute Python interpreter from command line using Java. But that is a dirty and shameless. Also to deal with the results produced by Python code I will have to write the results in a file and read it back in java. Again dirty way. 
Is there something that any one can suggest me? Thanks to every one giving time.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Igal for answering. I had a look at it. At first glance it appears as if it is simply calling the python script. </p>

<pre><code>Jep jep = new Jep(false, SCRIPT_PATH, cl);
jep.set(""query"", query);
jep.runScript(SCRIPT_PATH + file);
jep.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Isnt it very similar to what we would do if called the python interpreter from command line through a Java code.</p>

<pre><code>Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
Process proc = runtime.exec(""python test.py"");
</code></pre>

<p>Concern is how do I use the results generated by Python script. The naive way is to write them to file and read it back in Java. I am searching for a smarter approach.Thanks for suggestion anyway.</p>

Ideally there would be a function that gives <em>all</em> the coordinates (imagine a very curvy set of functions with multiple solutions). </p>

<p>So, I have something that works, but it's very crude. What I've done is put each function into a matrix so <code>M[h,0]</code> contains the x-values, <code>M[h,1]</code> is function1 y values, <code>M[h,2]</code> is function2 y values. I then find the derivative and place this in a new matrix <code>D[h,1]</code> and <code>D[h,2]</code> (span is one less than <code>M[h,:]</code>. My idea was to essentially ""plot"" the slopes on the x-axis, and the intercepts on the y-axis, and search all these points for the closest pair, then give the values. </p>

<p>Two problems here: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>program doesn't know if the closest pair is a solution or not and </p></li>
<li><p>it's painfully slow (numb_of_points^2 search). I realize some optimization libraries may help out, but I worry they will hone in on one solution and ignore the rest. </p></li>

<p>Like u can see, i want to rotate the canvas. Its a kind of Compass for a FXOS-App.
I know how to rotate an image, but i dont get it to work with this drawing.
The ""Compass"" Variable is the Deviceorientation un Degrees.
So if you point the device to east, the Compass must be rotated 90degrees to the left...</p>

<p>Maybe some of you has got an idea.</p>

<p>The data from the event table has to be displayed in a grid. In my previous question I learned how to properly query and display the data while only displaying the last record per ApplicationId (aka... grouping it and displaying the last record for each group). (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6201253/how-to-get-the-last-record-per-group-in-sql) Thank you @Anthony Faull, @Damien_The_Unbeliever, and all others who contributed to that answer.</p>

<p>Unfortunatelly a new requirement has been thrown at me and it involves the SourceId and EventType fields of this table.</p>

<p>Basically the new requirement states that for a specific value of in the EventType ('APP_CLOSE' and 'APP_START') column grab the Name of the source. For everything else display 'NULL' or some other predefined value.</p>

<p>I am trying to create a view that will accommodate this request and attempted using a LEFT OUTER JOIN. The problem is that some records in the Event table have values in the SourceId and I don't the data brought by the JOIN for these records unless the EventType field is 'APP_CLOSE' or 'APP_START'. </p>

<p>Any ideas on how to do this?</p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT</em>*</strong></p>

<p>Since someone pointed out that I suck at explaining what the issue is I decided to do a follow up:</p>

<p>Event:</p>

<pre><code>| Id | ApplicationId  | Name  | Description | Date       |Time     | EventType | SourceId |
+----+----------------+-------+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+----------+
|1   |2202            |XYZ    | Test        | 05/31/2011 |10:30:55 | APP_CLOSE | 2        |

|2   |2709            |zyx    | Test        | 05/31/2011 |11:27:55 | APP_START | 4        |
+----+----------------+-------+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+----------+
|3   |2709            |zyx    | Test        | 05/31/2011 |17:09:55 | APP_PAUSE | 1        |
</code></pre>

<p>Source Table:</p>

<pre><code>| Id | Name              | Description |
+----+-------------------+-------------+
| 2  | Process Watcher   |             |
+----+-------------------+-------------+
| 4  | Interrupt Handler |             |
+----+-------------------+-------------+
| 1  | User Input        |             |
+----+-------------------+-------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Result (Query or View):</p>

<pre><code>| Id | ApplicationId  | Name  | Description | Date       |Time     | EventType | Source Name          |
+----+----------------+-------+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+----------------------+
|1   |2202            |XYZ    | Test        | 05/31/2011 |10:30:55 | APP_CLOSE | Process Watcher      |

</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that even though a user can pause the app, the user is not a tangible piece of the software. Therefore when reporting on Events that have occurred I can only report on events that are caused by the components of the software. In other words I only need to bring in the Source Name based on the specific event types (APP_CLOSE and APP_START) for now. </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Basically, I have a memory buffer that stores raw RGB for a 256x192 pixel image.  This image will be written to regularly and I wish to display this to a 768x576 pixel area on the screen on an update call.  I would like this to be relatively quick and maybe optimise it by only processing the areas of the image that actually change.</p>

<p>How would I go about doing this?  My initial thought is to create a CGBitmapContext to manage the 256x192 image, then create a CGImage from this, then create a UIImage from this and change the image property of a UIImageView instance.  This sounds like a rather slow process.</p>

<p>Am I on the right lines or should I be looking at something different.  Another note is that this image must co-exists with other UIKit views on the screen.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>

<p>I need those keywords to have their color changed, even when opening a file. Right now I don't have a method to search for the words after the file is opened, but I'm worrying about having the color change as the user types in an opened document. If anyone could give me a hint on how to search for the words and change the color after the file is opened, that would be great also. :)</p>

I'd like to give the user the ability to either pass this in as a Makefile variable using <code>make PASSWORD=password</code> or if the user does not pass it in, then prompt the user for it and store their response in said Makefile variable.</p>

<p>At the moment, I'm able to check the Makefile variable, and then as part of my target specific rules, write shell commands that prompt the user for the password and store it in a shell variable.  However, this variable is only available to that specific shell and not any others.</p>

<p>How do I read something from the user and store it in a variable?</p>

<p>I've tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>PASSWORD ?= $(shell read -s -p ""Password: "" pwd; echo $pwd)
</code></pre>

<p>but the prompt is never printed.  I've also tried <code>echo ""Password: ""</code> inside shell, but that isn't printed either.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>To clarify, the password needs to be set for a specific target, so I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>PASSWORD := 

my-target: PASSWORD ?= $(shell read -s -p ""Password: "" pwd; echo $$pwd)

my-target:
    # rules for mytarget that use $(PASSWORD)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>

<p>I found the problem.  When I set <code>PASSWORD :=</code> at the top of the script, it sets <code>PASSWORD</code> to an empty string, and this in turn causes the <code>?=</code> to be skipped (since <code>PASSWORD</code>) is already set.</p>

<p>The ""outer"" carousel changes slides when the user clicks on a thumbnail</p>

<p>Each slide consist in an ""inner"" carousel that is manipulated with left and right arrows.</p>

<p>I have a problem with this though, because when I slide the ""outer"" carousel, the first ""item"" of the ""inner"" carousel should be assigned the ""active"" class.</p>

<p>The good news is: twitter bootstrop provides a ""slid"" event when changing slides.</p>

<p>so I could set the class of the first ""item"" in the correct ""inner"" carousel.</p>

<pre><code>    $('#outer-carousel').on('slid', function(e) {    
    // insert class assignment here
});
</code></pre>

<p>see all this in action here:
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/4hgcY/29/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/4hgcY/29/</a></p>

<p>My problem, however, is that I want do do this ONLY when the ""outer"" carousel is slid. But as you can see in the jsfiddle, the ""slid"" event fired by sliding an inner carousel causes the above Jquery to call the function as well...</p>

<p>what should I do? I've tried using selectors</p>

<pre><code>    $('#outer-carousel').on('slid', '#outer-carousel"",function(e) {    
    // insert class assignment here
});
</code></pre>

<p>But it dosn't work</p>

"4829547","1","4830238","","2011-01-28 14:52:29","","3","510","<p>in a C++ program I need some helper constant objects that would be instantiated once, preferably when the program starts. Those objects would mostly be used within the same translation unit, so the simplest way to do this would be to make them static:</p>

<pre><code>static const Helper h(params);
</code></pre>

<p>But then there is this <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/ctors.html#faq-10.14"" rel=""nofollow"">static initialization order</a> problem, so if <code>Helper</code> refers to some other statics (via <code>params</code>), this might lead to UB.</p>

<p>Another point is that I might eventually need to share this object between several units. If I just leave it <code>static</code> and put in a .h file, that would lead to multiple objects. I could avoid that by bothering with <code>extern</code> etc, but this can finally provoke the same initialization order issues (and not to say it looks very C-ish).</p>

<p>I thought about singletons, but that would be overkill due to the boilerplate code and inconvenient syntax (e.g. <code>MySingleton::GetInstance().MyVar</code>) - those objects are helpers, so they are supposed to simplify things, not to complicate them...</p>

<p>The same C++ FAQ <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/ctors.html#faq-10.15"" rel=""nofollow"">mentions</a> this option:</p>

<pre><code> Fred&amp; x()
 {
   static Fred* ans = new Fred();
   return *ans;
 } 
</code></pre>

<p>Is this really used and considered a good thing? Should I do it this way, or would you suggest other alternatives? Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT: I should have clarified why I actually need that helpers: they are very like normal constants, and could have been pre-calculated, but it is more convenient to do that at runtime. I would prefer to instantiate them before main, as it automatically resolves multi-threading issues (which local statics are not protected against in C++03). Also, as I said, they would often be limited to a translation unit, so it does not make sense to export them and initialize in main(). You can think of them as just constants but only known at runtime.</p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1950361/deep-mutable-copy-of-a-nsmutabledictionary"">deep mutable copy of a NSMutableDictionary</a> 
but it didn't solve my problem.</p>

<p>I have a NSMutableDictionary as a template.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary *mutableDictionaryTemplate = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @""obj1, @""key1"",@""obj2, @""key2"",nil];
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to copy this dictionary, then change some parts and later save it in a NSMutable Array.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *savedIterations = [NSMutableArray new];

//some loop that normally would change the objects added
int i=0;
for (i &lt; 5){

    NSMutableDictionary *copiedDictionary = [mutableDictionaryTemplate copy];
    [copiedDictionary setObject:@""obj3"" forKey:@""key3""];
    [savedIterations addObject:copiedDictionary];

    i++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that once I copy the NSMutableDictionary ""mutableDictionaryTemplate"" it no longer is mutable. But I need to copy it because otherwise I will have the same NSMutableDictionary at every index of my NSMutableArray ""savedIterations"" (at least I think so). I tried mutable copy as well but there I change the ""mutableDictionaryTemplate"" when I change ""copiedDictionary"". I think I have something messed up with what I have to copy and what not and how to copy it correctly.
It would be great if someone could point me into the right direction.</p>

 I would like to create an simple workable TCP adapter, which uses an own encoder and decoder. At first I check out above example ( it uses a simple String encoder and decoder ) this way :</p>

<pre><code>CamelContext ccontext = new DefaultCamelContext();

        try {
            ccontext.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
                @Override
                public void configure() throws Exception {
                    from(""netty:tcp://localhost:7000?sync=true&amp;keepAlive=true&amp;allowDefaultCodec=false&amp;encoder=#stringEncoder&amp;decoder=#stringDecoder"").to(""bean:sayHello"");
                }
            });

            ccontext.start();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>And there are two beans, according the above example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- ChannelBuffer/ByteBuf to String --&gt;
       &lt;bean id=""stringDecoder"" class=""org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.string.StringDecoder""/&gt;

       &lt;!-- String to ChannelBuffer/ByteBuf --&gt;
       &lt;bean id=""stringEncoder"" class=""org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.string.StringEncoder""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to start my implementation, i always get the this exception :</p>

<pre><code>org.apache.camel.FailedToCreateRouteException: Failed to create route route1: Route(route1)[[From[netty:tcp://localhost:7000?sync=true&amp;kee... because of Failed to resolve endpoint: netty://tcp://localhost:7000?allowDefaultCodec=false&amp;decoder=%23stringDecoder&amp;encoder=%23stringEncoder&amp;keepAlive=true&amp;sync=true due to: Could not find a suitable setter for property: decoder as there isn't a setter method with same type: java.lang.String nor type conversion possible: No type converter available to convert from type: java.lang.String to the required type: org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelHandler with value #stringDecoder

<blockquote>
  <p>I've been asked prior to a job interview to understand how an
  anti-aliased line is drawn in a framebuffer, using C or C++. I haven't
  used C, and it's been a few years for me since last using C++. I am a
  complete beginner when it comes to graphics. My C++ experience has
  mostly been in simple command-line programs and sorting methods. The
  company does not care if I grab the code online, they want me to
  understand it but still have a working executable.</p>
  
  <p>I've used <a href=""http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/windows/msvsnet2010e/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a> to set up SDL libraries in MS VC++ 2012
  Express, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3aXiaolin_Wu%27s_line_algorithm#Using_Wu.27s_line_algorithm_in_SDL"" rel=""nofollow"">this algorithm</a> for the actual anti-aliasing. I have
  a good understanding of the algorithm, though I'm currently having
  trouble getting it to compile. I just want a line to be drawn, and
  then I can go forward with setting the code up to the skeleton class
  definitions I was given. This is what I have included aside from what
  is on that page with the algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include ""conio.h""
#include ""stdlib.h""
#include ""stdio.h""
#include ""SDL.h""

const double HEIGHT = 240;
const double WIDTH = 320;
const double X0 = 25.6;
const double X1 = 64.7;
const double Y0 = 30;
const double Y1 = 42;

int round(double number)
{
    return number &lt; 0.0 ? ceil(number - 0.5) : floor(number + 0.5);
}

void main()
{
  Uint32 pixelColor = 00000000000000000000000000000000;

  SDL_Surface* myScreen = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE,WIDTH,HEIGHT,32, 0x000000FF,

  <p>0x0000FF00, 0x00FF0000, 0xFF000000);</p>

<pre><code>  WULinesAlpha(X0, X1, Y0, Y1,pixelColor,myScreen);

  return;
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>I'm getting the following errors:</p>
  
  <p>Error 21  error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _SDL_main
  referenced in function _main Error    22  error LNK1120: 1 unresolved
  externals</p>
  
  <p>I've seen a few code examples saying the main function has to look
  like this:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Again, graphics stuff is unfamiliar to me so I know my main function
  is likely very wrong; I'm anticipating some shaking heads. Can someone
  explain what is happening/what I need to do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New:</p>

<p>I have now replaced my main function with the following code, based on NomNomNom069's YouTube video: ""C++ SDL Tutorial 2 Creating a Screen and Handling Basic Input""</p>

<pre><code>#include ""SDL.h""

int main(int argc, char * args[])
{
    bool running = true;
    //initialize SDL
    if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) == -1)
    {
        running = false;
    }

    //set up screen
    SDL_Surface *screen;

    screen = SDL_SetVideoMode(WIDTH, HEIGHT, 32, SDL_HWSURFACE);

    if (screen == NULL)
    {
        running = false;
    }

    SDL_Event occur;

    //main application loop
    while (running)
    {
        SDL_PollEvent(&amp;occur);

        if (occur.type == SDL_QUIT)
        {
            running = false;
        }

        //drawing occurs here
        SDL_FillRect(screen, NULL, 0);
        SDL_Flip(screen);
    }

    //quit SDL
    SDL_Quit();

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>No errors, and I get a window to pop up. Awesome.</p>

<p>My question now is regarding how/where to call <code>WuLinesAlpha</code>. This function calls for 4 <code>double</code>s, a <code>Uint32</code> variable, and an <code>SDL_Surface*</code>. I have my <code>double</code>s, I set the <code>Uint32</code> to <code>0x000000FF</code>, and I assume that the <code>SDL_Surface</code> I have set up as <code>screen</code> is the one passed in.</p>

<p>I've toyed around with where the <code>WuLinesAlpha</code> function call goes and I keep getting the black screen. I thought, as explained in the video, it would go in the loop but nothing has happened. Are there any more SDL commands I should be calling?</p>

<p>When we regenerate the project using SubCommander\sonic.exe and try to compile we get some errors reporting missing members (which should have been automatically generated based on the stored procedures we have).</p>

<p>On closer inspection it looks like my StoredProcedures.cs file is missing some (not all) automatically generated methods for my classes.</p>

<p>As an example, I have 2 procs:
[dbo]._ClassA_Func1
[dbo]._ClassA_Func2</p>

<p>Only one of these is being generated in the StoredProcedures.cs file.</p>

<p>These methods generate fine using the SubSonic Tools plugin.
We have tried now with versions 2.1 and 2.2 of SubSonic with the same issue.
We are still on .NET 2.0 so cannot use SubSonic 3.0.</p>

<p>I have checked the permissions of both procs using fn_my_permissions and they seem identical.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas on what I can check?</p>

<p>Thanks -- Mark</p>

<p>In the data set properties for this ID field, I have AutoIncrement = true,  AutoIncrement Seed = -1 (default) and AutoIncrementStep = -1 (default)</p>

<p>I cannot save a new row to the database. </p>

<p>If I add a new record using the tool strip, clear the ID field, then click the save icon I get this exception:  “Cannot insert explicit value for identity column in table xxxx  when IDENTITY INSERT is set to off”.   If I leave the auto generated value of “-1” in the field, I get the same exception.</p>

<p>The code attached to the save button:</p>

<pre><code>private void tblClassificationBindingNavigatorSaveItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {         
        this.Validate();
        this.tblClassificationBindingSource.EndEdit();
        this.tableAdapterManager.UpdateAll(this.exportComplianceSISVTDataSet);
    }

<p>Executing the last step results in the exception. </p>

<p>Some forum respondents recommend setting IDENTITY INSERT to “ON” as a workaround but many advise against this.  </p>

<p>I was wondering if it is possible to make it so that if the main content section expands (with for example a blog), I can make the footer move down and the left content section to stay where it is (using slices)?</p>

"30714013","1","","","2015-06-08 16:02:41","","0","64","<p>The project I'm working on uses Entity Framework 6.0 Code-First.</p>

<p>One of my co-workers, due to his lack of experience with EF, manually changed the field type of a field on the database to being <code>decimal(28,10)</code>, instead of doing it the correct way in the <code>OnModelCreating</code> method of <code>DbContext</code>. Entity Framework allowed him to do so, never throwing an error upon any future migrations.</p>

<p>Last week, another co-worker was running into a problem with a process that clones records from that table, where the decimal values in the new records were being truncated to 2 decimal places (with no rounding occurring). </p>

<p>The code for that cloning resembles the following (using the Repository pattern on top of EF):</p>

<pre><code>public void CloneAccounts(List&lt;Account&gt; accounts, int newQuarterID)
{
    var newAccounts = new List&lt;Account&gt;();
    accounts.ForEach(account =&gt;
    {
        var clonedAccount = new Account
        {
            QuarterID = newQuarterID
            AccountName = account.AccountName,
            AccountNumber = account.AccountNumber,
            Amount = account.Amount
        };

        newAccounts.Add(clonedAccount);
    });

    AccountRepository.AddMany(newAccounts);
    AccountRepository.Save();
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I pointed out, as a side-point, that the declaration of the <code>Amount</code> field being <code>decimal(28,10)</code> should really be in <code>OnModelCreating</code>, he went ahead and did that, and added a migration. Doing that, interestingly enough, ended up solving the issue with the code above. </p>

<p>My question is two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why did that issue not affect the creation of the original records as well, and only upon cloning?</li>
<li>Why did adding that line in <code>OnModelCreating</code> fix it?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>According to Google's <a href=""http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/responsive-interaction.html#responsive-interaction-surface-response"" rel=""nofollow"">Surface Response animation guide</a> one should eg when tapping an object elevate it for a certain time, along with the ripple effect. Reading the <a href=""http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html#paper-shadow"" rel=""nofollow"">Paper-shadow docs</a> I found the <code>animated</code> parameter can be set to true to animate changes in the z value (depth) of the element.</p>

<p>However, how do I change it back to the initial value? I can set a timer and reapply the initial value, but that doesn't seem like an efficient way to solve this issue. Since it is advised behavior to add this functionality, I think it should be implemented somehow (or maybe it's on its way?)</p>

<p>The program is working very well,BUT the problem is :</p>

<p>when i try to parse a file from the ip adress <code>192.168.1.1</code>(i change the <code>google.com</code> to <code>192.168.1.1</code> which is the adress of the router):</p>

<pre><code>        doc = Jsoup.connect(""http://192.168.1.1/"").get();

<p>it does not work and shows me the error below :</p>

<p>first i think that the problem is related to ""ussername and the password"" so i change the address <code>192.168.1.1</code> to <code>Username:Password@192.168.1.1</code> :</p>

<pre><code>        doc = Jsoup.connect(""http://username:password@192.168.1.1/"").get();

<p>but it does not work , the program read the entire line as an adress.</p>

The idea was that you controlled a little dot with the arrow keys (or awsd or i don't care what) within a box on the screen.  Little rectangles would then randomly spawn on all edges of the box and progress across it.  you have to avoid contact with them.  The project turned out to be harder than I expected and I couldn't get the movement to work right.  If you could help me with that that would be great.  also, feel free to take the concept and what little I have done so far and do whatever you want with it.  I would be interested to see your results.  Below is the code I used for the spawns without any of the movement scripts.  I was using the basic idea of this code to do the movement:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 5; //Starting Location - left
var y = 5; //Starting Location - top
var dest_x = 300;  //Ending Location - left
var dest_y = 300;  //Ending Location - top
var interval = 2; //Move 2px every initialization

function moveImage() {
    //Keep on moving the image till the target is achieved
    if(x&lt;dest_x) x = x + interval; 
    if(y&lt;dest_y) y = y + interval;

    //Move the image to the new location
    document.getElementById(""ufo"").style.top  = y+'px';
    document.getElementById(""ufo"").style.left = x+'px';

    if ((x+interval &lt; dest_x) &amp;&amp; (y+interval &lt; dest_y)) {
        //Keep on calling this function every 100 microsecond 
        //  till the target location is reached
        window.setTimeout('moveImage()',100);

databases.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Info about the application:</strong></p>

<p>The application is an EJB running on a Sun Java Application Server 9.1</p>

<p>I use something like the following spring context to set up the hibernate session factories:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""dbADatasource"" class=""org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""jndiName"" value=""jdbc/dbA""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean id=""dbASessionFactory"" class=""org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""dataSource"" ref=""dbADatasource"" /&gt;
    &lt;property name=""hibernateProperties""&gt;
        hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle9Dialect
        hibernate.default_schema=schemaA
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""mappingResources""&gt;
        [mapping resources...]
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean id=""dbBDatasource"" class=""org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""jndiName"" value=""jdbc/dbB""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean id=""dbBSessionFactory"" class=""org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""dataSource"" ref=""dbBDatasource"" /&gt;
    &lt;property name=""hibernateProperties""&gt;
        hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle9Dialect
        hibernate.default_schema=schemaB
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""mappingResources""&gt;
        [mapping resources...]
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Both of the JNDI resources are javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDatasoure's. They actually both point to the same connection pool, but we have two different JNDI resources because there's the possibility that the two, completely separate, groups of tables will move to different databases in the future.</p>

<p>Then in code, I do:</p>

<pre><code>sessionA = dbASessionFactory.openSession();
sessionB = dbBSessionFactory.openSession();
sessionA.beginTransaction();
sessionB.beginTransaction();
</code></pre>

<p>The sessionB.beginTransaction() line produces the error in the title of this post - sometimes. I ran the app on two different sun application servers. On one runs it fine, the other throws the error. I don't see any difference in how the two servers are configured although they do connect to different, but equivalent databases.</p>

<p><strong>So the question is</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Why doesn't the above code start
completely independent transactions?</li>
<li>How can I force it to start
independent transactions rather than
a distributed transaction?</li>
<li>What configuration could cause the difference in
behavior between the two application
servers?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>P.S. the stack trace is:</p>

<p>The problem I am running into is when I do a console.log($scope.speakers); it does a resource and then the arrays are under faculty. If I put the above json directly into my controller in place of FacultyListFactory.query(); I can run  $scope.groups = _.groupBy($scope.speakers['faculty'], ""lastNameStartsWith""); successfully. But I can't put it directly into my controller because there are hundreds of them and they are coming from the server. If I run $scope.groups = <em>.groupBy($scope.speakers['faculty'], ""lastNameStartsWith""); trying to access the server I get an object in the console log but it appears to be empty, I ran console.log(</em>.groupBy($scope.speakers['faculty'], ""lastNameStartsWith""));</p>

<p>If I run $scope.groups = _.groupBy($scope.speakers, ""lastNameStartsWith""); I get undefined because the data is under {""faculty"":[...]} </p>

<p>I'm not sure how I can access the nested array under the key value from data coming from a GET call. I need to group by last name letter for this list and I've been trying to get it to work for hours. I'm not sure why 'faculty' isn't working. Please help! Thanks</p>

mat1 &lt;- data.frame(MTM,FI,MCLI)
mat1 &lt;- as.matrix(mat1)
</code></pre>

<p>Where ""MTM"", ""FI"" and ""MCLI"" are the ""fields of interest"" and every row is a different project that has some/any/none of the fields in common. 
How could I transform these data to look like this? </p>

<pre><code>matx:   
       MTM   FI   MCLI
MTM     10    0   1
FI       0    1   1
MCLI    10    1   17
</code></pre>

<p>I am interested in representing -in a network graph- the fields as ""nodes"", and the connections as ""edges"". This could be helpful in representing the most ""popular"" and interconnected fields. Is it possible with these data? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>EDIT: I came across <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1894190/basic-sna-in-r-how-to-load-network-data"">this</a> solution, which could be OK for what I want:</p>

<p>I know that Lucene supports fuzzy searches (FIRST_NAME:john~) and takes a number between 0 and 1 to control the fuzziness. The problem (for me) is this number does not directly translate to an edit distance. And when the values in the documents are short strings (less than 3 characters) the fuzzy search has difficulty finding them. For example if there is a document with FIRST_NAME 'J' and I search for FIRST_NAME:I~0.0 I don't get anything back. </p>

<p>I'm doing this on a nginx/unicorn/django setup as well as a nginx/unicorn/rails setup for a separate server.</p>

<p>My strategy is to set <code>preload_app=true</code> in my <code>guincorn.py</code>/<code>unicorn.rb</code> file, then reload by sending a USR2 signal to the PID running the server.  This forks the process and it's children and a <code>pre_fork</code>/<code>before_fork</code> can pick up on this and send a subsequent QUIT signal.  </p>

<p>Here's an example of what my pre_fork is doing in the guincorn version:</p>

<pre><code># ...

pidfile='/opt/run/my-website/my-website.pid'

# socket doesn't come back after QUIT
bind='unix:/opt/run/my-website/my-website.socket'

# works, but I'd prefer the socket for security
# bind='localhost:8333'

# ...

def pre_fork(server, worker):
    old_pid_file = '/opt/run/my-website/my-website.pid.oldbin'

    if os.path.isfile(old_pid_file):
        with open(old_pid_file, 'r') as pid_contents:
            try:
                old_pid = int(pid_contents.read())
                if old_pid != server.pid:
                    os.kill(old_pid, signal.SIGQUIT)
            except Exception as err:
                pass

pre_fork=pre_fork
</code></pre>

<p>And here's a selection from my sysv script which performs the reload:</p>

<pre><code>DESC=""my website""
SITE_PATH=""/opt/python/my-website""
ENV_PATH=""/opt/env/my-website""
RUN_AS=""myuser""

SETTINGS=""my.settings""

}

run () {
  if [ ""$(id -un)"" = ""$RUN_AS"" ]; then
    eval $1
  else
    su -c ""$1"" - $RUN_AS
  fi
}

  echo ""Reloading $DESC""

<p>I chose preload_app=true, for the zero-downtime appeal.  Since the workers have the app preloaded into memory, then as long as I switch processes correctly, it should simulate a zero downtime result.  That's the thinking anyway.</p>

<p>This works where I'm listening to through a port but I haven't been able to get it work over a socket.</p>

<p>My questions are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this how the rest of you are doing this?</li>
<li>Is there a better way, for example with HUP somehow?  My understanding is you can't use <code>preload_app=true</code> with HUP though.</li>
<li>Is it possible to do this using a socket?  My socket keeps going away on the QUIT and never coming back.  My thinking is that a socket is more secure because you have to have access to the filesystem.</li>
<li>Is anyone doing this with <code>upstart</code> rather than <code>sysv</code>?  I'd ideally like to do that and I saw <a href=""https://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/03/26/tip-seamless-restarts-with-unicorn-and-upstart/"" rel=""nofollow"">an interesting way of accomplishing that</a> by flocking the PID.  It's a challenge with upstart because once the exec-fork from gunicorn/unicorn takes over, upstart is no longer monitoring the process it was originally managing and needs to be re-established somehow.</li>

Here are the problems I have and I can´t solve after trying it for 8 days -.- .
1.Deactivate Drag option after once dropped:
So once an item was dropped it shouldn´t be draggable anymore , so how is it possible to do this?
2.I can´t drop my items in the e.g. 6. or 7. row.
3.Everytime I try to add instead of a text in the header an image it won´t appear.
4.Also my footer doesn´t appear.</p>

Initially, theere will be no work orders. So the Threads should just wait.

    t1.start();
    t2.start();

    try{

    }

        System.out.println(t1.getState() + "" - "" + t1.getName());

        System.out.println(""notify"");
        workOrders.notify();

        System.out.println(t1.getState() + "" - "" + t1.getName());
        System.out.println(t2.getState() + "" - "" + t2.getName());

    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The AnotherRunnable class:</p>

<pre><code>public class AnotherRunnable implements Runnable {

public void run()
{
    System.out.println(""AnotherRunnable"");

}
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the Tread class:</p>

<p>public class T1 extends Thread {</p>

<pre><code> AnotherRunnable anotherRunnable;
ArrayList&lt;ATMRunnable&gt; workOrders;

ATMThread(AnotherRunnable anotherRunnable, ArrayList&lt;ATMRunnable&gt; workOrders)
{
    this.anotherRunnable = anotherRunnable;
    this.workOrders = workOrders;
}

public void run()
{
    System.out.println(""Run Thread"");

    synchronized (workOrders){
        try{
            System.out.println(""wait Thread"");
            workOrders.wait();
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e){}
    }

}

<p>}</p>

<p>This is the output of the program:</p>

<p>$authWithOAuthPopup, when used on Android (via 'ionic run', i.e. installed as apk) results in browser getting stuck in auth.firebase.com/blank/page.html.</p>

<ul>
<li>All is working fine in html (via 'ionic serve') so I assume, that firebase and google configuration are fine. cordova.js is included properly.</li>
<li>The cordova inapp browser is installed and can open other urls. I have whitelisted firebase(io) and google domains and also allowed everything else. I am using <em>cordova-plugin-inappbrowser 1.0.2-dev ""InAppBrowser""</em> and
<em>cordova-plugin-whitelist 1.0.0 ""Whitelist""</em>. I have tried older versions of the inappbrowser as well.</li>
<li>I am not using ionic livereload to avoid any potential cross-domain/proxy issues</li>
<li>When remote debugging, no errors are being reported: after $authWithOAuthPopup control gets lost somewhere deep in the minified firebase.js code and never returns to angularfire level</li>
<li>The following traffic is generated (detailed urls below):
1) firebase code calls auth.firebase.com/v2//auth/google, 2) accounts.google.com returns to 3)auth.firebase.com/v2.... which transfers to 4) auth.firebase.com/blank/page.html.</li>

<p>OS: Ubuntu Linux 2.6.24-24-server #1 SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux
Java: 1.6.0_21
Tomcat: 6.0.28
JRuby: 1.5.0
Rails: 2.3.7</p>

<p>We're currently getting crawled by Google, Yahoo and Baidu, so site usage is up. I've been monitoring Tomcat with JConsole and we're definitely seeing a problem with an excessive number of classes. When tomcat launches, we have about 12,000 classes loaded. After 8 hours, we have almost 75,000 classes loaded. PermGen goes from 100MB to 460MB in the same time.</p>

<p>Class unloading is working, but it only unloaded ~500 classes over that same 8 hour period. PermGen never seems to get collected.</p>

<p>We're running with the following VM options for Tomcat:</p>

<pre><code>-Xms2048m -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:PermSize=128m \
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 \
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously there's some kind of leak. The question is how where? Any advice on how to track down who and what is responsible for this? I'm hoping it's some really silly mistake on our part, but I'm not sure where to begin.</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>It looks like we're seeing one new class created for every single incoming request.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>It's definitely related to JRuby. Using JConsole, I enabled Verbose mode for the class loader. Here's a sample from catalina.out:</p>

<pre><code>[Loaded anon_class1275113147_895127379 from file:/opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.28/webapps/notes/WEB-INF/lib/jruby-core-1.5.0.jar]
[Loaded anon_class1354333392_895127376 from file:/opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.28/webapps/notes/WEB-INF/lib/jruby-core-1.5.0.jar]
[Loaded anon_class1402528430_895127373 from file:/opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.28/webapps/notes/WEB-INF/lib/jruby-core-1.5.0.jar]
</code></pre>

<p>So the question becomes how do I track down the party responsible for creating those extra classes?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>Not sure if this the problem, but somehow we're ending up with an insane number of class loaders. Ran <code>jmap -permstat PID</code> and got:</p>

<pre><code>class_loader  classes bytes       parent_loader   alive?              type
total = 1320  135748  947431296   N/A             alive=1, dead=1319  N/A
</code></pre>

<p>That seems a little excessive. The majority are one of three kinds of classloaders: <code>sun.reflect.DelegatingClassLoader</code>, <code>org.jruby.util.JRubyClassLoader</code> or <code>org.jruby.util.ClassCache$OneShotClassLoader</code>. Again, sample output from <code>jmap -permstat</code>:</p>

<p>I've been working with some PLCs and variable frequency drives lately and thought it was about time I finally found out what cyclic and non-cyclic communication is.</p>

<p>So correct me if I'm wrong, but when I think of cyclic data, I think of data that is continuously being updated and is able to be sent/sampled to other devices. With relation to what I'm doing, I'm thinking that the variable frequency drive is able to update information such as speed and frequency that can be sampled/read from a PLC. This is what I would consider cyclic communication, something that is always updating a certain type of information that can be sent as data. </p>

<p>So I might be completely wrong with this assumption, and that leaves me with the question of what exactly would be considered non-cyclic or acyclic communication.</p>

The code is part of a program that I am writing that populates an array list with virtual gas station objects containing several explicit parameters; one of which is a ""description"" that is a String parameter being the name of the gas station. The method in question, findStation(), takes an explicit parameter that is set to the name of a gas station. Then, using this I search through my array list looking for a gas station description(using a previously declared getDescription() method that I know functions correctly) that matches my toMatch explicit parameter. If a match is found, the integer position in which it is found is returned. </p>

<p>Well, I feel as if I have properly written the code, but when I attempt to do a Junit test on it, I get the error ""Expected &lt;6>, but returned &lt;-1>"". Does anyone see anything immediately wrong with either my method syntax or the way I am testing the method? Thanks in advance for all the help from you wonderful people!</p>

<p>By the way, I have tried to include everything that pertains to figuring out the specific method in question. Let me know if something else is needed!</p>

<p><strong>Method in question: I create a temporary Station object to hold the information found at the ""i"" position in the list. Then, I create a temporary String to hold my description from the object I just retrieved. If the description matches the explicit parameter that is input, then I want it to return the index number at which it is found. My constant variable NO_MATCH is set equal to ""-1"", so my test is telling me that the gas station description does not exist when it clearly does.</strong></p>

<pre><code>public int findStation(String toMatch)
{ 
    //returns the index where a match is found
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; stations.size(); i++)
    {
        Station tmpStation = stations.get(i);
        String tmpDescription = tmpStation.getDescription();
        if (tmpDescription.equals(toMatch))
        {
            return i;

<p>First, take a look at the game <a href=""http://cssdeck.com/t/egkk1kra/7"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.
The problem is, when the ball hits the paddle, I want a burst of n particles at the point of contact but that doesn't came right. Even if I set the particles number to 1, they just keep coming from the point of contact and then hides automatically after some time. </p>

<p>Also, I want to have the burst on every collision but it occurs on first collision only. I am pasting the code here:</p>

<pre><code>//Initialize canvas

</code></pre>

<p>Now, my function for emitting particles is on line 156, and I have called this function on line 151. The problem here can be because of I am not resetting the <code>flag</code> variable but I tried doing that and got more weird results. You can check that out <a href=""http://cssdeck.com/t/egkk1kra/8"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>By resetting the <code>flag</code> variable, the problem of infinite particles gets resolved but now they only animate and appear when the ball collides with the paddles. So, I am now out of any solution.</p>

I used following code in program:</p>

<pre><code> if (datagrid1.Items.Count &gt; 0)
            {
                var border = VisualTreeHelper.GetChild(datagrid1, 0) as Decorator;

                    }

<p>the code of the event is:</p>

<pre><code>public Boolean AutoScroll=true;

    {
           var border = VisualTreeHelper.GetChild(datagrid1, 0) as Decorator;
           if (border != null)
           {
               var scroll = border.Child as ScrollViewer;




        // User scroll event : set or unset autoscroll mode
             if (e.ExtentHeightChange == 0)
                 {     // Content unchanged : user scroll event
            if (scroll.VerticalOffset == scroll.ScrollableHeight)
                     {   // Scroll bar is in bottom
                // Set autoscroll mode
                AutoScroll = true;

<p>it is working like my requirement. but following things are happening:</p>

<p>1) if a keep some thread.sleep(50) in background worker, the UI and datagrid is working till 1,50,000 rows, after this UI is not responding</p>

<p>2) if I keep thread.sleep(1) in background worker, the UI and datagrid is working till 13000 rows, after this UI is not responding</p>

<p>in both the cases the datagrid view is being loaded by background worker continuously.....</p>

<p>3) if I don't use above autoscroll logic the datagrid is working fine and UI is working fine..</p>

<p>I am not understanding why it is happening?</p>

<p>could u suggest me a solution...</p>

<p>(My requirement is UI similar to Antivirus software listing the infections while scanning.. along with click event on each row)</p>

These two classes are connected by <em>observes</em> property:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YYxJq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>and the related ontology portion is as:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;owl:Class rdf:about=""http://www.iiitd.edu.in/~haroonr/ontologies/DGO#TemperatureSensor_Livingroom""&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=""http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn#SensingDevice""/&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:subClassOf&gt;
    &lt;owl:Restriction&gt;
      &lt;owl:onProperty rdf:resource=""http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn#observes""/&gt;
      &lt;owl:allValuesFrom rdf:resource=""http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/qu/dim#Temperature""/&gt;
    &lt;/owl:Restriction&gt;
  &lt;/rdfs:subClassOf&gt;
&lt;/owl:Class&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, using SPARQL query I want to know which property is observed by <em>TemperatureSensor_Livingroom</em> class, which is a subclass of <em>SensingDevice</em>. For the same I am using following query:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT ?y 
WHERE {
    dgo:TemperatureSensor_Livingroom rdfs:subClassOf  ?p .
    ?p owl:allValuesFrom ?y .
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this query  I do get required result, but I do not understand that without using <em>observes</em> property how I am getting results? I tried to formulate different queries using <em>observes</em> property, but none of them results in required answer. I think in this case I am getting results with some trick, but I want to know the correct query for this case. I might be wrong, but I think restrictions are doing something in background that I am not able to get. Do these restrictions affect the way we should query? </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
From the answers of Artemis and Chris, I found that in this case there is no good reason to use <em>observes</em> property directly in the SPARQL query becuase of the valid reasons provided in the mentioned answers. With this I found another related use case as:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HW37U.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Ontology is same (dgo.owl), only I have added some classes as depicted above.Now if I query for the same thing as mentioned in the previous case, i.e,</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ?y 
WHERE {
dgo:TemperatureSensor_Livingroom rdfs:subClassOf  ?p .
?p owl:allValuesFrom ?y .}
</code></pre>

<p>As predicted it produces output as:</p>

<pre><code>----------------------------------------------------------
| x | y                                                  |

|   | &lt;http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/qu/dim#Temperature&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it produces output related to two properties,i.e, <em>observes</em> and <em>detects</em>. In such a scenario, how can I get output related to <em>observes</em> property only. </p>

It is a game in which you visit a website and the user jumps around links on one website and tries to make it to another target webpage while player stats such as the webpages jumped/number of clicks is updated on a status bar as the game is played. 
In order to implement this game, the django app needs to be running along side a normal web browser process similar to WikiGame. This could be analogous to implementing UIWebView if this was a mobile app in ObjC. Does Django have any packages that do similar things? </p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like an app which when visiting myapp.com will start a browser inside that window and take the user to google.com for example and the url will be myapp.com/<a href=""http://google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/</a> (perahps the slashes would be decoded out) My url.py looks like this which should allow me to pass any website URL into it and then pass this argument into whatever django webview approaches you guys can suggest to me. Thanks for any input. Basically right now, I just want to get something working where if I enter into the URL: myapp.com/<a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com</a> it should show google inside my application tab.

<p>but it throws an error

<p>the problem what i find till now is that the data.php is taking time to send response </p>

<p>if(xmlHttp.readyState == 4) is taking time to execute.</p>

<p>because when i add alert statements in between code it works fine.</p>

<p>what i tried till now:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>i tried to add while loop outside if condition but broweser gives a warning : 
<strong>script is making your webpage slow</strong></p></li>
<li><p>i tried to put the code(the code for adding repose to drop down list) in if(xmlHttp.readyState == 4) condition but it did not gave any response.</p></li>

<p>And here is the associated Python code I'm trying, with 2 attempts.  The first I was trying to set the text field of the Error dialog, and the second I'd added a label and tried to first get and set that.</p>

<pre><code>dError = self.builder_.get_object(""dError"") # get dialog

# Attempt 1 - setting the text field of the error dialog
# dError.set_text(""Attempt 1"")  
    #-- AttributeError: 'gtk.MessageDialog' object has no attribute 'set_text'

# Attempt 2 -setting an added label
# dLbl = dError.get_object(""lblError"")
    #-- AttributeError: 'gtk.MessageDialog' object has no attribute 'get_object'
# dlbl.set_text(""Attempt 2"")  

dError.show()
return True

<p>Where is my mistake?  Am I using the JQuery framework incorrectly?  Can you not use an &lt; li> to access a Servlet?  I don't believe that I can use the submit() function, as I need to pass the arguments.</p>

Part of my code will precompute large arrays, which I write out, and then use in a later runs to speed up computation. I write out attributes to the HDF file that I check to make sure that it is the correct file to use in those later computations.</p>

<p>When I use the high-level API ""H5LT"" to write out these attributes, I can not select the datatype and it defaults to the NATIVE type on the machine. For example to write out an integer array I use:</p>

<pre><code>attr_data[0] = 100; attr_data[1] = 200;
attr_size = 2;
status = H5LTset_attribute_int(file_id, ""/MyGroup"", ""attr1"", attr_data, attr_size);
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, my local machine will select little-endian. </p>

<p>Now if I using the low-level routines:</p>

<pre><code>attr_data[0] = 100; attr_data[1] = 200;
attr_dims[0] = 2;
attr_space_id = H5Screate_simple(1, attr_dims, NULL);
attr_id = H5Acreate(group_id, ""attr1"", H5T_STD_I32BE, attr_space_id, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
status = H5Awrite(attr_id, H5T_NATIVE_INT, attr_data);
status = H5Aclose(attr_id); 
status = H5Sclose(attr_space_id);
</code></pre>

<p>This will write out the attribute array in big-endian. </p>

<p>My concern is this code may be run on many different types of machines, which may have different endianness, and I want to ensure that these large files that I write out can be machine independent. </p>

<p>(For the data, I use the low level routines as I read/write in chunks and speed is important, so I can control the endianness here. I prefer the high-level API since it is more readable (in my opinion), and I only have to check the status for run-time errors once, whereas I would check the status 3 times in the low-level case.)</p>

<p>I am a bit confused on the logic. I know the point is to decouple the system, but I am a little confused.</p>

<p>So the MVC Controllers call on the Services to fill the View Models. So is it safe to say the MVC App is coupled to the Service Layer?</p>

<p>Then the Service Layer calls on the Repository to get and persist objects. Is then safe to say the Service Layer is dependent to the Repository?</p>

<p>The Repository the utilizes EF4 to get and persist data to SQL server, so I would assume the Repository depends on EF4 which in turn depends on SQL Server.</p>

<p>Where does the unit of work all fit in.</p>

<p>Any examples please?

<p>The other box is not visible on form load, when you make a selection from the optionset dropdown, it appears on the form and allows you to enter data.

<p>I will try to outline why I am doing this in as simply as possible. I have 3 NSObject Classes and an appDelegate.</p>

<ol>
<li>AppDelegate</li>
<li>RemoteSites</li>
<li>EngineRequest</li>
<li>EngineReasponse</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the logical flow of the app as it stands</p>

<pre><code>Appdelegate.m
calls RemoteSites method ""GetRemoteSites"" this method reutrns a BOOL for confirmation

RemoteSites.m
-(BOOL)GetRemoteSites {

EngineRequests *engineRequests = [[EngineRequests alloc] init];
[engineRequests GetRemoteSites:self];

//..
}

EngineRequests.m

- (void)GetRemoteSites:(NSObject *)myObjectClass {
 // get everything ready to send off request
}

send off request then return recived data + NSObject refrence to EngineReasponse

EngineReasponse.m
- (void)GetRemoteSites:(NSData *)receivedData Object:(NSObject *)requestingClass
{
// pass requestingClass to a NSObject var that will later be used to pass the data back to the original class that started the request
 requestingClassObject = requestingClass

  <p>If it is the former, just check again and see if you get a more solid confirmation.</p>
  
  <p>If it is the latter, perhaps one of the following is happening:</p>
  
  <p>That url is excluded from the cache on purpose in the Varnish vcl file (in which case, yay! It's working.)
  The application is sending cache headers that are telling Varnish not to serve that content from cache. This means you'll have to fix the cache headers the application is sending to Varnish. A lot of the time those headers are Cache-Control and/or Expires.
  The application is setting a session cookie, which can prevent Varnish from serving content from cache. This means you'll have to update the application and make it not send a session cookie for anonymous traffic.

<p>I have a normal App.js that is used to set up the main window etc.. Then the html pages will use a main.min.js file that is basically made up with all my ES6 classes compiled into one file:</p>

<p>loader.es6 file</p>

<pre><code>import Main from  './pages/Main.es6'

<p>Main.es6 file</p>

<pre><code> import Vue from 'vue';

export default class Main extends Vue{
   constructor() {...}
   .....
}
</code></pre>

<p>When compiled and run this all works fine and all is good... But as i thought if i want to implement the 'IPC', 'Remote' modules, i am having issues with compiling as they cannot find those modules, either through the <code>require()</code> or  <code>import..</code> methods within my classes.</p>

<p>so doing the following fails:</p>

<pre><code> import Remote from 'remote'
 import Main from  './pages/Main.es6'

 new Main()
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>var Remote = require('remote')
import Main from  './pages/Main.es6'

new Main()

<p>Is this possible to do or achieve, or nope needs more thought and going back to normal js please.</p>

<p>Also: Would it be possible to add a linebreak in the items added to the TileGroup?
In my XML file I've defined a group attribute, so that I'm able to devide the images into groups. If I click a image from one group, I can skip next/prev within that group, but not to the next group. Is there any way for me to insert a linebreak to my TileGroup, so that I can listen for when the prevGroup != curGroup, and then add in some sort of spacing before continuing adding the next thumbs? All I need is a way to skip a line in the tileGroup :)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Then I opened up a terminal on my mac and found that I had python 2.6.8 and 2.7.5 and 3.3.3 installed. Sorry for the long story.

<p>EDIT: Also the record only contains 4 bytes aswell. Which define just an integer number.
The LINE_SEPERATOR = byte { '\r', '\n' } </p>

<p>My problem is that each time I add a new record (append) I need to overwrite the header (not appending) becouse the record count should be increased by one. However the program refuses to switch between them and it just sticks with the non append mode.</p>

<p>addRecord code:</p>

<pre><code>public void addRecord(ISaveable record)
        throws IllegalArgumentException, FileNotFoundException, IOException
{
    if(record == null)
    {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""The given record may not be null"");
    }

    this.header.increaseRecordCount();

    writeHeader();

    FileOutputStream oStream = null;
    try
    {
        oStream = new FileOutputStream(DEFAULT_DIR, true);

        long offset = calculateOffset(this.header.getRecordCount() - 1, record.getSize());

        System.out.println(""writing record @ "" + offset);
        oStream.getChannel().position(offset);

        PacketOutputStream pOut = new PacketOutputStream();
        record.Save(pOut);
        pOut.writeBytes(END_LINE);
        oStream.write(pOut.Seal());
    }
    catch(FileNotFoundException ex)
    {
        throw ex;
    }
    catch(IOException ex)
    {
        throw ex;
    }
    finally
    {
        if(oStream != null)
        {
            oStream.flush();
            oStream.close();
        }
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The writeHeader code:</p>

<pre><code>private void writeHeader()
        throws IOException
{
    FileOutputStream oStream = null;
    try
    {
        oStream = new FileOutputStream(DEFAULT_DIR, false);

        oStream.getChannel().position(0);

        PacketOutputStream pOut = new PacketOutputStream();

        this.header.Save(pOut);
        pOut.writeBytes(END_LINE);

        oStream.write(pOut.Seal());
    }
    catch(IOException ex)
    {
        throw ex;
    }
    finally
    {
        if(oStream != null)
        {
            oStream.flush();
            oStream.close();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I am using the booleans in the constructor of FileOutputStream correctly. Giving the writeHeader a false (becouse I want to overwrite the existing header) and the record a true (becouse it should be added to the end of the file). Please ignore the fact that setting append to true that it will automaticly seek to the end. The calculateOffset method is for future implementations.</p>

<p>I have done experiments where I only write the header everytime. It works perfectly when set to not append. And as expected when it's set to append it will add multiple headers. </p>

<p>The result I'm getting from my file right now after trying to add 4 records is only 2 lines. The header is perfect, there's nothing wrong with it. However all 4 records are written on the next line overwriting eachother.</p>

<p>The resulting debug text:</p>

<ol>
<li>writing record @ 6</li>
<li>writing record @ 12</li>
<li>writing record @ 18</li>
<li>writing record @ 24</li>
<li>reading record @ 6</li>
<li>3457</li>
</ol>

<p>All record positions are correct, however the '3457' is the result of all 4 records overwritten on the same line.</p>

<p>As you can see, the location value I got from the code is different from IE. The only difference I can see from Fiddler is the cookies are not been send by the request. However, where are those cookies coming from and how can I set them?</p>

<pre><code>Sophia Candappa     F 23 00011  
</code></pre>

<p>As per my lecturer's instructions, I have stored this information in a class called Client (although I know an ArrayList would be better I can't use it).<br>
The code below is a method that is used to compare all the clients to one another and determine if they are a match. They are a match if they are all of the following:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Opposite sex    </li>
<li>Age within five years of one another    </li>
<li>They have three interests in common     </li>
</ol>

<p>The latter is determined by the string ""00011"" in the example above. If the clients share the number ""1"" at the same place in the string on three or more occasions, then the third condition is satisfied.</p>

<p>My code works perfectly and outputs the desired result. However, I want to ask two questions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is it as efficient as it could be (without ArrayLists)? I had considered separating out all the if/else statements into separate methods, but decided against it as I thought it wouldn't reduce any of the actual loops.    </p></li>
<li><p>How can I change the output slightly. Currently, if a client is matched it displays ""[Client Name] is compatible with"" then it takes a new line and outputs all the clients who are matched. I would like to change it so that if the client has just one match, it says ""Client Name is compatible with""..., but if the client has two or more clients it says ""Client Name is compatible with the following [two/three/four] clients...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried doing the latter, but I always mess up the formatting. Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered.</p>

<pre><code>public static void matchClients(Client[] clientDetails)
{
    boolean anyMatch;
    int count;
    for (int b = 0; b &lt; numberOfClients; b++)
    {
        anyMatch = false;
        count = 0;
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; numberOfClients; c++)
        {
            if (clientDetails[b].getClientGender()!=clientDetails[c].getClientGender())
            {
                if (Math.abs(clientDetails[b].getClientAge() - clientDetails[c].getClientAge()) &lt;= 5)

I've worked on a number of php apps in the past, but I don't really remember much.  As a favor for a friend I'm trying to help them trace a problem in a php app.  I got it set up on my machine (osx.6) php Entropy 5.3.3 apache.</p>

<p>It seems to run for the most part, but I'm having problems with the admin login...noticed that it wasn't logging in, giving an error or anything.</p>

<p>Anyway, my specific question deals with a line I am looking at where login errors are dumped to the view:</p>

<p></p>

<p>This outputs nothing, even when I set the value explicity Eg:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php $problem=""There is a problem.""?&gt;
&lt;?= $problem ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However it does work if I say:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php $problem=""There is a problem.""?&gt;
&lt;?php echo ($problem); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This makes me wonder if the problems I'm having testing the app locally are due to some mods not being loaded, or a php version issue?  </p>

<p>What's the diff between these syntaxes, and why would one work and the other not?</p>

<p>I found different approaches to the font size in html:</p>

<pre><code>html { font-size: 100%;  }  // uses the default browser font-size
html { font-size: 62.5%; }  // 62.5% = 10px to facilitate rem calculation
html { font-size: 16px;  }  // uses 16px
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that I would take the <a href=""http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem"" rel=""nofollow"">62.5%-approach suggested by Jonathan Snook</a>, I could then assign my headings and paragraph quiet easily using <a href=""http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/less-mixin-for-rem-font-sizing/"" rel=""nofollow"">a mixin for px-fallbacks:</a></p>

<pre><code>@mixin font-size($sizeValue: 1.6) {
    font-size: ($sizeValue * 10) + px;
    font-size: $sizeValue + rem;
}

h1 { @include font-size(3.2); }         // 32px
h2 { @include font-size(2.6); }         // 26px
h3 { @include font-size(2.2); }         // 22px
h4 { @include font-size(1.8); }         // 18px
h5 { @include font-size(1.6); }         // 16px
h6 { @include font-size(1.4); }         // 14px
</code></pre>

<p>I could then apply media queries to the html font-sizes to scale the typography at different resolutions , something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@media (min-width: 768px) { html { font-size: 56.3%; } } // 56.3% = 9px
@media (min-width: 992px) { html { font-size: 62.5%; } } // 62.5% = 10px
@media (min-width: 1200px) { html { font-size: 68.8%; } } // 68.8% = 11px
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. What is the best approach to the font-size baseline (px vs 100% vs 62.5%)?</strong></p>

<p>As we all know in Automapper we can perform convention based mappings...</p>

<p><strong>My Question</strong></p>

<p>Is it possible to access extension methods (LINQ.First()) on objects in a collection, to go ""n"" levels deep?
See example below</p>

<p><strong>My Entities</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class Store
{
    public IList&lt; Departments &gt; Departments {get;set;}
}

public class Departments
{
    public bool Open {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What I want to be able to do</strong></p>

<pre><code>Mapper.Map&lt; Store, StoreEditModel &gt;();

public class StoreEditModel
{
    public bool DepartmentsFirstOpen {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Applicable Use (So you don't think I'm stupid)</strong></p>

<p>The applicable use is to assume that all items in the collection should be in the same (Open)state.</p>

<p>So when my edit model comes back to be processed, I can open or close all Departments in the Store respectively.</p>

<ul>
<li>search returns a $resource object that exposes the API verbs when in staging or production environments, and works as expected</li>
<li>searchMock exposes $httpBackend which, in turn, responds with mock JSON objects, and works as expected by itself</li>
</ul>

<p>I have another service, APIInjector, that determines what the current environment is based on a config file that's included dynamically by Grunt when the app is built and injects either search or searchMock accordingly.</p>

<p>My problem is, as far as I can tell from searching high and low, $httpBackend needs to be set-up within a module's run method. The problem with this is I can't inject the run method within my APIInjector's conditional logic.</p>

<p>How can I expose $httpBackend if the dev environment condition is met, and my $resource service otherwise? Note that I didn't include the calling controller's or the searchService's code, but I can if needed for clarification.</p>

<p><strong>searchMock:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var searchMockService = angular.module('searchMockService', []);

searchMockService.run([
  '$httpBackend', 
  function($httpBackend) {
    results = [{name: 'John'}, {name: 'Jane'}];
    $httpBackend.whenGET('/search').respond(results);
}]);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>APIInjector:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var APIInjectorService = angular.module('APIInjectorService', [
  'searchService', 
  'searchMockService'
]);

APIInjectorService.factory('APIInjector', [
  '$injector',
  'ENV_CONF',
  function($injector, ENV_CONF) {
    var isDevelopment = ENV_CONF.IS_DEVELOPMENT;

    // Check to see if we're in dev and, if so, inject the local API services
    if (isDevelopment) {
      return {
        Search: // Not sure what to do here to expose searchMock's run method???
      };
    } else {
      return {
        Search: $injector.get('Search') // This returns $resource from the search service, as expected
    };
  }

I <strong>don't want to place the POI jars inside a /lib folder</strong>, instead I want to use a working POI OSGI bundle from my target definition.</p>

<p>All my attempts so far have failed to create a <em>working</em> OSGI bundle of <a href=""http://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-3.8beta4"" rel=""nofollow"">POI 3.8</a>. What I did so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I merged all relevant JAR files with the Ant <strong>zip</strong> task:</p>

<ul>
<li>poi-3.8-beta3-20110606.jar</li>
<li>poi-ooxml-3.8-beta3-20110606.jar</li>
<li>poi-ooxml-schemas-3.8-beta3-20110606.jar</li>
<li>poi-scratchpad-3.8-beta3-20110606.jar</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I ran the <strong>bnd</strong> tool with the <em>wrap</em> parameter: <code>java -jar biz.aQute.bnd.jar wrap ./poi-3.8-beta3-20110606-merged.jar</code></p></li>
<li><p>I had to bundle the jars in the /ooxml-lib folder separately, with bnd:</p>

<ul>
<li>xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar</li>
<li>stax-api-1.0.1.jar</li>
<li>dom4j-1.6.1.jar</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This leads to ClassNotFoundExceptions for <code>org.w3c.dom.Node</code> because xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar exports four classes from this package <code>org.w3c.dom</code>. Normally the JavaSE-RuntimeEnvironment would export these.</p></li>
<li><p>I deleted the <code>org/w3c/dom</code> folder from xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar and rebundled the jar but I got other ClassNotFoundExceptions. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I want - if the first checkbox is selected, the user will fill in the <code>sampleSize</code> text input field, and that value will be bounded to the form, while the <code>misSampleSize</code> field will be blank/zero/whatever (in this case I'm not using it anyway). And vice versa.</p>

<p>The problem - when I check the checkbox and fill in the <code>sample</code> text input, it binds the value 0 to the form.</p>

<p>I've tried setting the <code>value</code> in the <code>input</code> tag to null, removing it completely and using the template helper (I prefer to avoid it because it's not as flexible). I can't understand why the number I enter into the text field is ignored, and my programs considers it to be 0.</p>

<p>So <strong>question 1</strong>: How do I stop the 0 value being populated?</p>

<p><strong>question 2</strong> How can I send a value for one of the text fields (<code>sampleSize</code> or <code>misSampleSize</code>), and leave the other one empty, without getting form errors?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"28246488","1","28315348","","2015-01-30 23:47:38","","0","38","<p>I have two relevant tables here:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class List
{...
        public int RegionId { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey(""RegionId"")]
        public virtual Region Region { get; set; }
...}

public partial class Region
{
    public Region()
    {
        Lists = new HashSet&lt;List&gt;();
    }

    public int RegionId { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [StringLength(255)]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public DateTime Added { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection&lt;List&gt; Lists { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the contents of the Regions table:</p>

<pre><code>RegionId    Name
1   Global
2   China
3   USA
4   UK
8   Canada
9   Spain
10  France
</code></pre>

<p>On the breeze side of things, I pull down the Regions:</p>

<pre><code>var query = new breeze.EntityQuery().from(""Regions"").select(""RegionId,Name"").orderBy(""RegionId"");
    return $rootScope.breezeManager.executeQuery(query).then(function (data) {
        service.regions = data.results;
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to work:</p>

<pre><code>service.regions[2]; // Name: ""USA"", RegionId: 3
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to create a new entity:</p>

<pre><code>var newList = $rootScope.breezeManager.createEntity('List', listValues);
</code></pre>

<p>And in listValues, I specify <code>{ RegionId: 3, ...}</code>:</p>

<pre><code>newList.RegionId // 3
newList.Region   // null
</code></pre>

<p>That would be strange already perhaps, but the <strong>really</strong> frustrating thing is, if I specify another value, like 1, it works. Same for 2, and 4:</p>

<pre><code>newList.RegionId     // 1
newList.Region.Name  // ""Global""
</code></pre>

<p>I've been poring through the code (and the internet) for hours trying to figure this out, but it's eluded me, and thus qualifies for my <em>first ever SO question!</em></p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I'm now even more confused. I planned to workaround this by manually setting the Region after the <code>createEntity</code> call, so I added this line of code right above <code>createEntity</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var region = Enumerable.From(service.regions).Single(""$.RegionId == "" + listValues.RegionId);
</code></pre>

<p>However, after doing so, and with no other changes, <code>newList</code> now correctly gets a populated <code>Region</code>, even for 3 (USA)! I then commented out that line and tried again, and it still worked. Tried a few other times, various combinations of things, and now it's not working again, even with that line. Not sure if that helps. I'll keep experimenting.</p>

<p>Finally, thank you to anyone who gives any sort of suggestion or advice or actual help in any way shape or form. I know people get angry when they see homework questions for some reason because they think the student is asking them to ""do their homework for me"", but that's not what I'm doing. I'd simply like any advice or tips, I'm not asking you to just fill in the blanks for me and fix everything (not that I'd be opposed to it :P). Thanks.</p>

<p>I want to save each row from table in a separate text file with the title from the title column. Or, when user click on post a creation to not send it to database but to send it directly to a text file with the title that they add. </p>

<hr>

<p>This is postcreations.php</p>

Speed is a great concern as I plan to offload major parts of the gameplay to scripts.
As a result I choose to use C# for scripting ingame events and stuff.
Users should also be able to write scripts and addons for the game in C#.
(I know that C# is NOT a scripting language btw.)</p>

<p>I will provide the users with a (static) class that contains all the functions needed to interact with the game.
The users will also be able to provide the code as source (the game will compile it in that case).
<strong><em>Compiled</em></strong> user ""scripts"" can / will also be transmitted to other players in some cases.
For example a user can build in scripted traps in his home or whatever.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Security</p>

<p>How can I ensure that the provided code is forced to ONLY call stuff of the provided API (class) ? To prevent cheating with scripts, malicious activities...</p>

<p>Is there a way to maybe run the compiled code(s) in a sort of VM or low-trust environment ??</p></li>
<li><p>Speed</p>

<p>Will this approach be fast enough ? (Calling functions from up to 100 custom assemblys every or every second frame).
Any tips on this?</p>

<p>Maybe it's possible to get a speed advantage by compiling all user content into one big assembly or whatever ??</p></li>
<li><p>Size</p>

<p>How can I make the compiled code small in size (besides compressing it) ?
Because players might need to download tens of scripts...</p>

<p>Is there a way to strip stuff that isn't absolute necessary ? Like debug information or classnames and the likes...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Runtime compilation is fairly new to me (That's why I ask here). So it would be nice to have some major beginner mistakes and / or security concerns pointed out.</p>

<h1>Edit:</h1>

<p>Just for clarification:
A user plugin/script or whatever you would like to call it will be a class (also written in C#) that has to implement specific functions like ""GetAddonInfo"", ""Init"", ""Update"" ...
Just like a normal C# class that is derived from my abstract ""Addon"" class.</p>

<p>Given ClassA and ClassB:</p>

<pre><code>class ClassA
{
public:

    ClassA() { cout &lt;&lt; ""ClassA ctor\n""; }

    ClassA(const ClassA &amp;other) { cout &lt;&lt; ""ClassA copy ctor\n""; }

    ClassA&amp; operator=(ClassA other) {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""ClassA assignment\n"";
        return *this;
    }

    ~ClassA() { cout &lt;&lt; ""ClassA destructor\n""; }
};

class ClassB {
    ClassA mA;
public:

    ClassB(ClassA a) : mA(a) {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""ClassB ctor\n"";
    }

    ~ClassB() { cout &lt;&lt; ""ClassB destructor\n""; }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Can somebody explain if there is a way why this code works:</p>

<pre><code>void test3(ClassA pA) { cout &lt;&lt; ""Test3\n""; }
...
test3(ClassA());
</code></pre>

<p>producing the output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ClassA ctor </p>
  
  <p>Test3</p>
  
  <p>ClassA destructor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this code doesn't:</p>

<pre><code>ClassB b(ClassA());
</code></pre>

<p>ClassB constructor is not even being executed in this case (although no error is thrown either).</p>

<p>Is there a way to avoid copy ctor when passing argument by value to a ctor?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So the code on line 64 in the LISTING_PAGE.PHP file is:</p>

<pre><code>echo $categoryinfo-&gt;name;

<p>The LISTING_PAGE.PHP is a view which is loaded by the code in the B class, specifically this line:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;load-&gt;view(""listing_page"", $data);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the strange thing is, if I change the routing rule in routes.php to:</p>

<pre><code>$route['tools/id/(:any)'] = ""b/view/$1""; //I added an id 'section'
</code></pre>

<p>Then the code works without error.</p>

<p>The code also works perfectly if I access <a href=""http://mywebsite.com/b/view/toolid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mywebsite.com/b/view/toolid</a>.</p>

<p>So it appears that if there is more than one 'section' (tools/id) then the code works perfectly, if there is only one 'section'(tools/) then there is that non-object error.</p>

<p>So this works just fine (I want the object looking like that), however I'm wondering if there is a way to do this without using so many variables to do it? I am using underscore if this makes it easier. It would be cool if there was a much more elegant (and hopefully) simple way to achieve this. I mean, this method works fine for me, however I am trying to improve my javascript skills, and use less code when possible :). Thanks!</p>

I would like to display a specific control for each data type, e.g. when the data type is DateTime, I want to display my custom edit control that allows typing a date in or popping up a calendar.</p>

<p>The data looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Name   DataType   DateValue   StringValue   BooleanValue     
---------------------------------------------------------
A      Date       1/1/2007 
B      String                 asdf
C      Boolean                              True
</code></pre>

<p>...and in the db, this table has a column for each possible type of value. So, there is a <code>BooleanValue</code> column, <code>DateValue</code>, etc.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is display a single 'Value' column in the grid that displays the appropriate edit control depending on what the 'DataType' is for that row. So, the grid should look like :</p>

<pre><code>Name   DataType   Value     
---------------------------
A      Date       1/1/2007 
B      String     asdf
C      Boolean    True
</code></pre>

<p>It seems I will need to display a different edit control (to allow the user to edit the <code>Value</code> column) for each row dynamically based on the value of the <code>DataType</code> column. I know there are more advanced grids out there that handle this sort of problem, but the powers that be will not allow anything but what is available out-of-the-box with Delphi.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to make something like this work?</p>

<p>Here is all of my code, then I'll explain what it's doing:</p>

<p><em><strong>messages/index.html.erb</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""chat""&gt;
  &lt;%= render @messages %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;%= form_for Message.new, :remote =&gt; true do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :content %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.submit ""Send"" %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>*<strong>messages/_message.html.erb*</strong> (I'm using content tags vs. pure html)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= content_tag :li do %&gt;
  &lt;%= content_tag :span, :class =&gt; ""created_at"" do %&gt;
    &lt;%= message.created_at.strftime(""%H:%M"") %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
  &lt;%= message.content %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>* messages/create.js.erb *</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;% broadcast ""/messages/new"" do %&gt;
  $(""#chat"").append(""&lt;%= escape_javascript render(@message) %&gt;"");
&lt;% end %&gt;

$(""#new_message"")[0].reset();
</code></pre>

<p>I think that's all of the relevant code. My problem is that when I click 'Send', it's adding the pure html to my 'chat'. But if I refresh the page, that html is no longer there until I submit a new message.</p>

<p><strong>* Before Refresh *</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sNlDv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Just from looking at this, it looks like the html is completely incorrect, the ending tag for span and li aren't right. Why would this be happening? But when I refresh, it looks pretty much fine.</p>

<p><strong>* After Refresh *</strong></p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    modelBuilder.Entity&lt;UserProfile&gt;()
        .HasMany(x =&gt; x.TeamLeaders)
        .WithMany()
        .Map(m =&gt; m.MapLeftKey(""UserId"")
        .MapRightKey(""TeamLeaderId"")
        .ToTable(""UserTeamLeaders""));
}
</code></pre>

<p>TeamLeaders is an ICollection of Users i.e. it is a self referencing many-many relationship.</p>

<p>In plain English, a user can have more than one team leader. This configuration appears to be correct, as it creates the duel FK/PK link table as I would expect.</p>

<p>I have an MVC4 application that allows editing, adding and removal of team leaders from the collection.</p>

<p>In my controller, I originally had the following:</p>

<pre><code>    var original = context.UserProfiles
        .Include(""TeamLeaders"")
        .Single(x =&gt; x.UserId == model.UserId);

    context.Entry(original).CurrentValues.SetValues(model);
</code></pre>

<p>However, that last line was failing to mark the TeamLeaders collection as updated, and when I called SaveChanges(), no changes were recorded.</p>

<p>Instead I wrote a simple CopyProperties method on my User class, which uses reflection to manually copy the properties across, so in my controller I now have:</p>

<pre><code>    var original = context.UserProfiles
        .Include(""TeamLeaders"")
        .Single(x =&gt; x.UserId == model.UserId);

    //context.Entry(original).CurrentValues.SetValues(model);

    original.CopyProperties(model);
</code></pre>

<p>However, this goes too far, and SaveChanges attempts to add a new user to the system matching the profile of the selected team leader.</p>

<p>Can anyone advise as to which part of this I am doing wrong? I am not sure whether I need to update the mappings, or change the way I copy properties from the view model to the model</p>

<p>BOSH spec: <a href=""http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the client needs to send some data to the connection manager then
  it simply sends a second request containing the data. <strong>Unfortunately
  most constrained clients do not support HTTP Pipelining</strong> (concurrent
  requests over a single connection), so the client typically needs to
  send the data over a second HTTP connection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in this specification is many info about HTTP pipelining, but from 
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Non-idempotent methods like POST should not be pipelined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in BOSH spec: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All information is encoded in the body of standard HTTP POST requests
  and responses. Each HTTP body contains a single  wrapper which
  encapsulates the XML elements being transferred (see  Wrapper
  Element).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how can be HTTP pipelining used with HTTP BOSH??</p>

</code></pre>

<p>iso is the foreign key which references the iso-3166 coding for countries.</p>

<p>I inserted a number of countries with english spelling, but also in other languages ONLY when the spelling is different from english, in order to save some space in the database (for example ""Germany"" in german is ""Deutschland"", so the iso for 'DE' appears twice in the table, with 2 different names).</p>

<p>What I need is to select all the countries in some specific language (like german, or spanish), then all countries with english names from the same column. Where there is no corresponding name in the foreign language, then the english name should fill the empty field, so that I get a mixture of english + foreign language. The mixture should be equal to the sum of countries with english spelling, like this (nulls are where the english names should fill the missing spanish names, like Congo, Chile, China, Colombia):</p>

<pre><code>'CA', 'ES', 'Canadá'
'CC', 'ES', 'Islas Cocos'
'CD', 'ES', 'República Democrática del Congo'

<p>I was hoping to avoid including all the javascript in the question, but I think it's best that I do. The only other piece is that when I ""view source"" in chrome I see the two variables are indeed getting populated with data:</p>

<pre><code>var artist_names = [[""'Bubonic Bear', ""]];
var venue_names = [[""'Electric Factory', ""]];
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>If I hardcode a list for the ""headliner"" field's autocomplete function, the autocomplete works. </p>

<pre><code>$(""#headliner"").autocomplete({
            //source: artist_names,
            source: [""band1"", ""band2"", ""band3""],
            select: function(event, ui) { 
                submitForm($('#datepicker').val(), ui.item.value, $('#venue').val()); 
                $('#add-artist').empty();
                }
        });
</code></pre>

<p>I'm still not sure of the solution, it seems odd that a variable would be accessible in a local instance of the app and not on heroku. Anyway, I will add more if I figure out more.</p>

I'm currently using a thread to search files and trigger an event to its calling (main VCL) thread to report each and every search result. If you've ever used the <code>FindFirst</code> / <code>FindNext</code>, or done any large loop for that matter which performs very fast and rapid iterations, then you would know that updating the GUI on every little iteration is extremely heavy, and nearly defeats the purpose of a thread, because the thread then becomes dependent on how fast the GUI can update (on each and every iteration inside the thread).</p>

<p>What I'm doing upon every event from the thread (there could be 100 events in 1 millisecond), is simply incrementing a global integer, to count the number of iterations. Then, I am displaying that number in a label on the main form. As you can imagine, rapid updates from the thread will cause this to flicker beyond control.</p>

<p>So what I would like to know is how to avoid this rapid flicker in the GUI when a thread is feeding events to it faster than it's able to update?</p>

<p>NOTE: I am using VCL Styles, so the flicker becomes even worse.</p>

<p>When the execution hits <code>findContours()</code>, I get a StackOverflow as ""<strong>Unhandled exception at 0x100a9985 (opencv_core246d.dll) in SARA.exe: 0xC00000FD: Stack overflow.</strong>""</p>

<p>So I to <strong>Configuration Properties > Linker > System > Stack Reserve Size</strong> and change it to ""<strong>100000000</strong>"" (100MB)</p>

<p>This time the error changes... <code>cvtColor()</code> crashes with the error ""<strong>Unhandled exception at 0x774fc41f in SARA.exe: Microsoft C++ exception: Concurrency::scheduler_resource_allocation_error at memory location 0x1f63ad64..</strong>"" at concrt.h and if I remove <code>cvtColor()</code>, <code>Threshold()</code> crashes the same way.</p>

<p>I am compiling it as /MDd (Multi-Threaded Debug DLL) and I have also run CMake on OpenCV to clear the option ""BUILD_WITH_STATIC_CRT"", and I compiled openCV again, and the projects that I saw all had the /MDd  as well.</p>

<p>Does anyone has a guess about what is going on?</p>

<p>EDIT: 
Just to make it clear, I have enough free memory in my system to run the program.</p>

<p>Is it possible to tell EF to use a class that subclasses EntityObject, like the one below, as the base class of generated entity classes?</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class CustomEntityObject : EntityObject
{
    &lt;additional functionality&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I'm asking is I want to stop adding interfaces and implementing them on all entity types in separate partial class files. By sub-classing EntityObject I could implement the additional functionality once only.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>EF implicitly uses a .tt file to generate entity classes. By implicitly I mean you don't see  the .tt file in your project. The solution is to add the template explictly (right-click on the .edmx designer and click ""Add Code Generation Item..."", then add ""ADO.NET EntityObject Generator""). You then change a single value in the .tt:</p>

<pre><code>string BaseTypeName(EntityType entity, CodeGenerationTools code)
{
    return entity.BaseType == null ? ""EntityObject"" : MultiSchemaEscape((StructuralType)entity.BaseType, code);
}
</code></pre>

<p>changes to:</p>

    return entity.BaseType == null ? ""CustomEntityObject"" : MultiSchemaEscape((StructuralType)entity.BaseType, code);

<p>In editing the question I have spotted my own mistake (invalid cast to a <code>string</code>.)</p>

<p>Many thanks to all, all suggestions most helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Original Question</strong></p>

<p>I have an <code>.aspx</code> page with a <code>GridView</code>, databound to an <code>ObjectDataSource</code> which is filled with a <code>DataSet</code> containing a <code>DataTable</code>.</p>

<p>When handling the <code>RowDataBound</code> callback on the <code>GridView</code> however, I am unable to reference columns in the underlying dataset by column name, they just return an object of type <code>DBNull</code>. So:</p>

<pre><code>    protected void accountsGV_RowDataBound(object sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow)
        {
            // One way:
            // This works, but uses a hard coded column index which
            // I want to replace.
            if (e.Row.Cells[11].Text != ""&amp;nbsp;"")
            {
                // Apply certain styles to the row depending on
                // the contents of the cell.
            }


            // Another way. This doesn't work - ""date"" is always DBNull.
            DataRow row = (e.Row.DataItem as DataRowView).Row;
            DateTime date;

            if(!Convert.IsDBNull(row[""date""]))
            {
                date = (DateTime)row[""date""]);

                if (date &lt; SomeConstantDate)
                {
                    // Apply certain styles to the row depending on
                    // the contents of the cell.
                }
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>row[""date""]</code> returns an object of type <code>DBNull</code>.</li>
<li><code>row[11]</code> returns a <code>DateTime</code>.</li>
<li><code>row.Table.Columns[""date""]</code> returns a valid <code>DataColumn</code></li>
<li><code>row[row.Table.Columns[""date""]]</code> returns an object of type <code>DBNull</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone suggest why this might be happening?</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:GridView ID=""GV"" runat=""server"" DataSourceID=""ODS""
    AutoGenerateColumns=""false""
    ... snip ...

<p>I have a custom template container class put together from a map and vector. The map resolves a string to an ordinal, and the vector resolves an ordinal (only an initial string to ordinal lookup is done, future references are to the vector) to the entry. The entries are modified intrusively to contain a a <code>bool</code> ""assigned"" and an iterator_type which is a const_iterator to the container class's map.</p>

<p>My container class will use <a href=""http://deltavsoft.com/w/"" rel=""nofollow"">RCF</a>'s serialization code (which models boost::serialization) to serialize my container classes to nodes in a network. Serializing iterator's is not possible, or a can of worms, and I can easily regenerate them onces the vectors and maps are serialized on the remote site.</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p>I need to default initialize, and be able to test that the iterator has not been assigned to (if it is assigned it is valid, if not it is invalid). Since  map iterators are not invalidated upon operations performed on it (unless of course items are removed :D) am I to assume that <code>map&lt;x,y&gt;::end()</code> is a valid sentinel (regardless of the state of the map -- i.e., it could be empty) to initialize to ? </p>

<p>I will always have access to the parent map, I'm just unsure wheather <code>end()</code> is the same as the map contents change.</p>

<p>I don't want to use another level of indirection (--i.e., boost::optional) to achieve my goal, I'd rather forego compiler checks to correct logic, but it would be nice if I didn't need to.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/469849/using-an-stl-iterator-without-initialising-it"">This question exists</a>, but most of its content seems non-sense. Assigning a NULL to an iterator is invalid according to g++ and clang++.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/824157/how-to-check-whether-stl-iterator-points-at-anything"">This is another</a> similar question, but it focuses on the common use-cases of iterators, which generally tends to be using the iterator to iterate, ofcourse in this use-case the state of the container isn't meant to change whilst iteration is going on. </p>

I choose an EXT3 filesystem, but the same behaviour was observed with an EXT2 filesystem.</p>

<p>My writing loop looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>get_image()
fwrite()
fsync()
</code></pre>

<p>Or like this :</p>

<pre><code>get_image()
fopen() 
fwrite()
fsync()
fclose()
</code></pre>

<p>I also display some timing statistics, and I can see my program is sometime blocked for several seconds.
The average rate is still good, because if I keep the incoming images into a fifo, then I will write many image in a short period of time after such a stall. Do you know if it is a problem with the OS or if it is related to the SD card itself ?
How could I move closer to realtime ? I don't need strong realtime, but being stalled for several seconds is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Some precision :
Yes it is necessary to fsync after every file, because I want the image to be on disk, not in some user or kernel buffer. Without fsyncing, I have much better throughoutput,
but still unacceptable stall. I don't think it is a buffer problem, since the first stall happens after 50 Mbytes have been written. And according to the man page, fsync is here precisely to ensure there is no data buffered.</p>

<p>Precision regarding the average write rate :
I am writing at a rate that is sustainable by the card I am using. If I pile incoming image while waiting for an fsync to complete, then after this stall the write transfer rate will increase and I will quickly go back to the average rate.
The average transfer rate is around 1.4 MBytes /s.</p>

<p>Suppose we were interested in the most often-occurring time zones in the data set (the tz field). There are many ways we could do this. First, let’s extract a list of time zones again using a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>In [26]: time_zones = [rec['tz'] for rec in records if 'tz' in rec]
In [27]: time_zones[:10]
Out[27]: [u'America/New_York', u'America/Denver', u'America/New_York', u'America/Sao_Paulo', u'America/New_York', u'America/New_York', u'Europe/Warsaw', u'', u'', u'']
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to produce counts by time zone:</p>

<pre><code>def get_counts(sequence): 
   counts = {}
   for x in sequence: 
      if x in counts:
          counts[x] += 1 
      else:
          counts[x] = 1 
   return counts
</code></pre>

<h1>”</h1>

<p>This is an excerpt from a textbook, I do not quite understand the loop used to find the number of occurences of a certain timezone. Can someone please break it down intuitively for me, I'm a beginner.</p>

<p><strong>Follow up question:</strong></p>

<h1>“</h1>

<p>If we wanted the top 10 time zones and their counts, we have to do a little bit of dic- tionary acrobatics:</p>

<pre><code>def top_counts(count_dict, n=10):
    value_key_pairs = [(count, tz) for tz, count in count_dict.items()]
    value_key_pairs.sort()
    return value_key_pairs[-n:]
</code></pre>

<p>The quotations mark the excerpt. Could someone please explain what goes on in the function top_counts?</p>

<p>I'm using <code>asp:panel</code> to show hide the notification text and it works just fine, but for some reason I can't figure out why the <code>Compare</code> method I'm using isn't returning the expected result.</p>

<p>For example, when I set the user login to <code>01/05/2013</code> and the most recent date in the database is <code>01/04/2013</code>, I expect the result to be a greater than zero int and escape the if condition. That, unfortunately, doesn't happen and the method always goes into the if condition.</p>

<p>Sounds simple enough but i have a couple of queries about this. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>i will need to have two jdbc drivers, i.e. one for connecting to the Oracle database and the other for connecting to the sql server database. The sql server jdbc driver is the jtds jdbc driver (http://jtds.sourceforge.net/) and for Oracle i will be using the standard oracle jdbc driver. Am i likely to come across any problems with both drivers available in the classpath together? </p></li>
<li><p>My guess is that all i need is a ConnectionManager class to manage the connections and a client DAO class that would call the relevant method to get the connection it needs depending on whether it is reading from Oracle or writing to SQL Server. Is this a reasonable approach or is there a better design/pattern for this? </p></li>

<li>InvoiceBD get a SQL Server connection from the factory class and calls InvoiceUploadDAO.writeData passing it the SQL Server connection object. </li>
<li>InvoiceBD reuses the Oracle connection to call InvoiceUploadDAO.update status to 'Complete' set status on the Oracle database.</li>

<p>InvoiceBD commits the Oracle connection. 
InvoiceBD commits the SQL Server connection. </p>

<p>Or if something goes wrong both connection objects are rolled back. </p>

<p>Does that sound about right? </p>

I need your help again. Please bear with me because I am very new to this. Hoping for your understanding. So, I am having a project on oop and pdo. I am having quite hard time converting this into pdo.. Here is my code..</p>

<p>bookReserve.php</p>

<pre><code>    while($row=mysql_fetch_array($sql))
    {
     $oldstock=$row['quantity'];
    }

    $newstock = $oldstock-$quantity;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what i've done</p>

<pre><code>    while($row = $code-&gt;fetchAll())
    {
      $oldstock=$row['quantity'];
    }

    $newstock = $oldstock-$quantity;
</code></pre>

<p>Is that even correct?
And for the oop part, after this while loop I have a query to execute.</p>

<pre><code>    $sql=""update books set no_copies = '$newstock' where book_title = '$book_title'"";
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what I've done trying to convert it into pdo</p>

<pre><code>public function bookreserve2($q)
{
  $q = ""UPDATE books SET quantity WHERE = $newstock where book_title = '$book_title'""; 
  $stmt = $this-&gt;con-&gt;prepare($q);
  $stmt-&gt;execute(array(':newstock'=&gt;$newstock));
  $result = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
  return $result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, Is that even the correct converted query? 
and how would I call $newstock? </p>

<p>P.S. my oop class and pdo is placed in a separate file. Thought this might help.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

For example:
 Value in A1 check against all values in column H and if same value found move that value to B1, then again value in A1 check against values left in H column if same found  move to C1, every time finds A1 same as value in H column moves that value to new column D1, E1 .....continue until all values in H column have been checked and matching ones moved. After this value in A2 checked against all values in H column and all matching values moved to B2,C2,E2 etc. Continue until all values have been moved from column H.

<p>I have a domain class ""Word"" which basically looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@NodeEntity
public class Word {

@GraphId
Long graphId;

@Indexed(indexType = IndexType.SIMPLE, indexName = ""Word_wordString"")
private String wordString;

@RelatedTo(direction = Direction.INCOMING, elementClass = Sentence.class, type = ""HAS"")
private Set&lt;Sentence&gt; sentences;

public Word() {
}

public Word(String wordString) {
    setWordString(wordString);
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am persisting words with this method:</p>

<pre><code>private void persistWord(Sentence sentence, Word word) {
System.out.println(""checking index for wordString: ""
                + word.getWordString());
Word existingWord = wordRepository.findByPropertyValue(
                ""wordString"", word.getWordString());
if (existingWord != null) {
    existingWord.addSentence(sentence);
    existingWord.persist();
    System.out.println(""persisted already existing word ""
                    + existingWord);
} else {
    word.persist();
    System.out.println(""persisted word "" + word);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's supposed to check if the word is already in the graph, if so i change some attributes on the object returned by the wordRepository, then persist the changes (-> if (existingWord != null)). If the word is not in the graph yet it is just persisted (-> else).</p>

<p>This however always creates a new node for every word, even when it exists in the graph. So to speak, persist() always creates a new node.
After there are two words with the same wordString in the graph, the repository method throws:</p>

<pre><code>More than one element in org.neo4j.index.impl.lucene.LuceneIndex$1@1181df3. First element is 'Node[45]' and the second element is 'Node[83]'
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on?</p>

<p>I am also wondering what the difference between IndexType.SIMPLE,IndexType.POINT and IndexType.FULLTEXT is. (It's not in the API or the Good Relations guide)</p>

<pre><code>branch (branch_name, branch_city, assets)
customer (customer_name, customer_street, customer_city)
account (account_number, branch_name, balance)
loan (loan_number, branch_name, amount)
depositor (customer_name, account_number)
borrower (customer_name, loan_number)

<p>The question I am curious about is:
""Find the names of all customers who have a loan of more than £5000 but no account with a balance of more than £500.""</p>

<p>Original code:</p>

<pre><code>π customer_name
  (σ amount &gt; 5,000 ^ balance &lt; 500 
    (borrower ⋈ loan ⋈ depositor ⋈ account))
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Having looked at Erwin Smout's advice, I've amended my code to the following:</p>

<pre><code>π customer_name
  (σ amount &gt; 5,000 (borrower ⋈ loan))
-
π customer_name
  (σ balance &lt; 500 (depositor ⋈ account))

 I think there is something wrong with the implementation. How can a node push back the excess flow to the node when it is saturated. For instance:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IBZVA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>While finding the max flow from 1 to 3, at one stage I'll need to push back the flow from 2 to 1(since 2 has no outgoing edges). But in the code implementation of the First-in First-out algorithm, the loop at line number <strong>16</strong> runs from <code>0 to G[u].size()</code>.  Since 2 doesn't have any edge from 2 to 1, how can it push the flow back to 1?</p>

<pre><code>@public

def welcome():
    return render_template('/welcome.html')

<p>Elsewhere, here's what I was thinking the decorator and check would look like:</p>

<pre><code>_public_urls = set()

    # add route_function's url to _public_urls
    # _public_urls.add(route_function ...?.url_rule)

<p>I'm a bit stumped because I don't know how to get the url rule for a given function in the <code>public</code> decorator.</p>

<p>Perhaps this isn't the best design choice for Flask, but I'd expect there's another simple &amp; elegant way to achieve this. </p>

"7820175","1","7820284","","2011-10-19 10:52:31","","2","691","<p>Some trouble comes up for me while trying to port some code from java to c#.</p>

<p>At first, some explanation of the key concept behind the java code:
The key concept of the existing code is a class importing/using methods in an external library. This class implements an interface, which declares most of the methods from the external library. The benefit is the ability to create instances like</p>

<p>Interface1 instance = new classImplementingInterface1();</p>

<p>I'm trying to port code which implements an interface and imports methods from a external library. Actually I had to translate that interface to an abstract class because the java interface makes use of fields containing pre defined values, which is not supported in .NET interfaces acutally.</p>

<p>That may be my staring point:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class abstractClassA
{
    public abstract int abstractMethodA(int parameter);
}

public class usualClass : abstractClassA
{
    [DllImort(""ExternalLib.dll"")]
    public static extern abstractMethodA(int parameter);
}
</code></pre>

<p>An abstract class is used to be able to create instances from classes implementing that abstract class just by typing</p>

<pre><code>abstractClassA instance = new usualClass();
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, thats what I want to do, but I figured out that this won't work, while I inherit form an abstract class, i'll have to use the override statement for methods I want to implement like</p>

<pre><code>public class usualClass : abstractClassA
{
    public extern override abstractMethodA(int parameter);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will not work combined with the DllImport statement because it's telling me that methods using that statement shall declare both: extern and static. Adding the override keyword to implement the abstract class is not possible because a static member can't be declared as override. So I guess I'm traped some how :/</p>

<p>But actually I want to create a class naming the entry point from an external library. But I want this class to implement an interface / abstract class to have the ability to create instances of classes implementing this interface / abstract class just by typing</p>

<pre><code>abstractClassA instance = new usualClass();
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried this stuff using an interface (but without annoying static pre defined fields) and I found out that interface implementation does not work combined with the DllImport statement too, the compiler says that the named method is static and therefore can not implement an interface method. That actually makes sense, but is no suiteable solution to my problem.</p>

<p>Do you have experiences with that or furhter ideas?</p>

<p>And client class uses it the following way:</p>

<pre><code>ListIterator&lt;ParentClass&gt; lstParent = getLstIterator(0); //assign ListIterators

<p>So, the question:
What does the program do while assigning ListIterators:</p>

<p>1) it creates a new list and copies there elements from source list, casting them to ParentClass;</p>

<p>2) it simply creates a link to lstSub and from this time this list is interpreted as List for ListIterator?</p>

<p>Or it does something else?

The device I am working on is a custom framework where D3D is not an option though I do have information from the board manufacturer that DirectDraw is supported and 2d hardware acceleration is available, so that shouldn't be an issue.</p>

<p>1) Why is the second file working while the first is not?</p>

<p>2) Is there a way to fix this? </p>

<p>3) If the answer is no: can I automate deleting the attributes in R?</p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated!</p>

<pre><code>import os
pathname = os.path.abspath(""some/relative/directory"")
print pathname
</code></pre>

<p>this problem is that whenever i do something like this, it simply returns whatever relative directory i gave it preceded by my python directory.  for example:</p>

<p>C:\Python27\some\relative\directory</p>

<p>which is not even an existing directory on my computer.  i understand that the python interpreter searches the working directory by default, but what i'd like to do is have it search my entire computer for an absolute path that contains the partial directory i specify.  </p>

<p>the purpose of this is for me to create an exe (using py2exe) that can search for an arbitrary directory on any computer.  is there a method for doing this in the standard library or through some available module - or would i have to implement the algorithm myself?</p>

<p>I am using <code>Dapper</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (var connection = new SqlConnection(GetConnectionString()))

            }
</code></pre>

<p>where my <code>ModelClass</code> is</p>

<pre><code>class ModelClass
{
  string result {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>But getting <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Any ideas what am I missing here ? (or is there any other method to call this ?)</p>

As expected, when I animate the frame of the UIView to be smaller than the original size, the label 'jumps' to the final frame without animating nicely. </p>

<p>As far as I can see, UIContentModeRedraw does not force 'drawRect' to be called on every 'animated frame'. I've tried using a custom CALayer as well but can't seem to cause the frame to resize smoothly. </p>

<p>Is there any way to do this? The animation as it stands is extremely glitchy. UIContentModes are not useful and I can't use a frame for contentStretch as well as none of the edges of the label can be stretched. What I really need is a 'refresh' of the label every time the parent view resizes.</p>

On the parent window, I have an add button that opens a opens a Modal Window (form2.ShowDialog(), I think this is a Modal window).</p>

<p>In the child window I have a few text fields and an add button, the user enters data for a new record and clicks the Add button and the XML file is updated with the new record.</p>

<p>What I am seeking to do is when the child window is closed that the ListView in the parent window is refreshed to show the new record.</p>

<p>When I am updating the XML file from the child window, I am doing this directly to the XML file, should I be adding the data to the file in some other manner which would raise an event on the ObservableCollection?</p>

<p>I was heading down the path of adding an event handler to the add button on the parent window and attempt to force a re-read of the XML file, but I cannot figure out how to achieve this, below is what I have done so far.</p>

<p>I cannot workout what should go into the refresh_EmContacts sub, do I need to call some kind of ObservableCollection event handler to notify it that it has been updated and to do the re-read?</p>

Now, to make it work on IE and Safari on OSX, I used AdapterJS for Temasys, which asks the user to install the Temasys plugin, when their browser is not WebRTC compatible (excluding iOS).</p>

<p>Now, if I open the chat page in IE, it shows the plugin install prompt correctly. But, if I install the plugin, restart IE and open the page again, the page keeps loading, but never completes loading, and sort of unresponsive. If now I disable the Temasys addon from IE settings, the page loads fine and again asks for installing the plugin. 
If I enable the plugin, and remove the PeerJS <code>script</code> tag from the page, then also the page is loaded fine, but obviously the audio chat functionality is gone. 
The exact same thing is happening for Safari on Windows and Safari on Mac OSX.</p>

<p>I tried to console log at various points in AdapterJS, and it seems when the plugin is installed, and PeerJS is also included on the page, the pluginready variable is never set to ready and hence it keeps on loading.</p>

<p>Please help me solve this issue.</p>

""contacts"" (a list of each person, unique IDs), contact_phones (multiple telephone numbers for each contact, joins on contact_id), and contact_communication (each time we've spoken to this contact, joins on contact_id), and schools (a list of schools, joins schools.school_id = contacts.contact_id). </p>

<p>What I need: I need to look up an individual school. For that school, I need a list of each person that goes there, their main telephone number, and the last communication we had with them (if any). </p>

<p>The problem is, if we have had NO communication with them, they don't show up in the list. If I take out the ""AND"" statement in the ""WHERE"" clause, then I get more than one communication record. I only want the latest communication record, but I want all the contacts. Some contacts don't have a communication record though. </p>

<p>This is my query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT c.id,
            c.f_name,
            c.l_name,
            c.address1,

                cc.caller
                FROM contacts AS c
                LEFT OUTER JOIN contact_phones AS ct ON c.id = ct.contact_id
                LEFT OUTER JOIN contact_communication AS cc ON c.id = cc.contact_id 
            WHERE school_id = '$schoolId' AND

                ORDER BY cc.date DESC
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, this query gives me only the latest communication (which is all I want) but won't list contacts that have no communication.</p>

<p>I've been at this for 3 days. Any tips?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>DataContractSerializer - uses new attributes OR old [Serializable] attributes, but the serializer itself does not implement IFormatter where some of the other WCF serializers do. Opt IN.</p></li>
<li><p>NetDataContractSerializer - uses new attributes OR old, serializer implements IFormatter, is compatible with WCF, and is Opt IN. Seems like the ideal solution!</p></li>
<li><p>XmlSerializer - totally independant set of attributes, but is legacy so can forgive this.</p></li>
<li><p>BinaryFormatter - implements IFormatter and uses the [Serializable] attributes. Opt OUT.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So my question is, why does DataContractSerializer not stay at least fairly interchangable with BinaryFormatter? </p>

<p>I really wish they'd settled on a nice clean interface for this from the start, its a shame really in the expanse of the .NET framework which is usually so ordered!</p>

<p>I find that when I add the emitter it doesn't behave like it was just ""turned on"". That is, particles appear with full alpha far from the spawn point (as if they've been alive for a while). It is as if the emitter has been running it was suddenly shown.</p>

<p>What I'm after is tap -> add node-> start emitting from point -> emit for a while -> shut off -> remove node. </p>

<p>I've tried adjusting the particleBirthRate using GCD:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{
    if(self.burstEmitter.parent){
        return;
    }

    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint point = [touch locationInNode:self];
    self.burstEmitter.position = point;
    self.burstEmitter.particleBirthRate = 0;
    [self addChild:self.burstEmitter];


    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(0.5 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        self.burstEmitter.particleBirthRate = 10;
        dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(1.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            self.burstEmitter.particleBirthRate = 0;

            dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(3.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                [self removeAllChildren];
            });
        });
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I though SKAction might be the right tool (it probably is...)</p>

<pre><code>-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{
    if(self.burstEmitter.parent){
        return;
    }

    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint point = [touch locationInNode:self];
    self.burstEmitter.position = point;
    self.burstEmitter.particleBirthRate = 10;
    [self addChild:self.burstEmitter];


    [self.burstEmitter runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[
                                                      [SKAction fadeInWithDuration:1],
                                                      [SKAction waitForDuration:2],
                                                      [SKAction fadeOutWithDuration:1],
                                                      [SKAction removeFromParent]
                                                      ]]];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously fades the emitter node out, not ""shut it off"", </p>

<p>I'm open to using CAEmitterLayer. I tried that as well but ran into the same issue. </p>

<hr>

<p>Update: I found one solution: resetSimulation. </p>

<pre><code>-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{
    if(self.burstEmitter.parent){
        return;
    }

    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint point = [touch locationInNode:self];
    self.burstEmitter.position = point;
    self.burstEmitter.particleBirthRate = 10;
    [self.burstEmitter resetSimulation];
    [self addChild:self.burstEmitter];

    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(1.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        self.burstEmitter.particleBirthRate = 0;

        dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(3.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            [self removeAllChildren];
        });
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>This accomplishes what I was after. I'm still curious to use SKAction for this if possible. </p>

<p>In my application i've a cart with some line_items refernced to a product model.</p>

<p>line items have a quantity field, and i cant destroy a line item if the quantity is > 1.</p>

<p>in line_items_controller on the action ""destroy"" I've write this if controller:</p>

<pre><code>  def destroy
    quantity = @line_item.quantity

    if quantity &gt; 1
      quantity -= 1
      @line_item.quantity = quantity
      @line_item.save!
    else
      @line_item.destroy
    end

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { redirect_to @line_item.cart, notice: 'Line item was successfully destroyed.' }
      format.json { head :no_content }
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>the code works but for have some proofs that it will in the future i've build some tests; and here comes the troubles.</p>

<p>for first i've update the test ""should destroy line_item"" set the quantity of the record @line_item to 1.</p>

<pre><code>#Setup a line item from the fixture
setup do
    @line_item = line_items(:one)
end

# Can i destroy a line item?
test ""should destroy line_item"" do
    @line_item.quantity = 1
    assert_difference('LineItem.count', -1) do
      delete :destroy, id: @line_item
    end

    assert_redirected_to(controller: ""store"", action: ""index"")
  end
</code></pre>

<p>the fixtures for the @line_item are blank:</p>

<pre><code>one:
  product_id: 
  cart_id: 

two:
  product_id: 
  cart_id: 
</code></pre>

<p>launching the test i've got this error.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Error: CartsControllerTest#test_should_destroy_cart: ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)
      test/controllers/carts_controller_test.rb:44:in <code>block (2 levels) in &lt;class:CartsControllerTest&gt;'
      test/controllers/carts_controller_test.rb:43:in</code>block in '</p>
  
  <p>2) Error: LineItemsControllerTest#test_should_destroy_line_item:

      test/controllers/line_items_controller_test.rb:44:in</code>block in '</p>
</blockquote>

<p>also this is the carts_controller_test for the action destroy:</p>

<pre><code> test ""should destroy cart"" do
    assert_difference('Cart.count', -1) do
      session[:cart_id] = @cart.id delete :destroy, id: @cart
    end

    assert_redirected_to store_path
  end
</code></pre>

<p>and than for final this is my test for the model of line_item: </p>

<pre><code>require 'test_helper'

class LineItemTest &lt; ActiveSupport::TestCase

    test ""can't delete a line item if this have a quantity superior of 1"" do
        line_item = LineItem.new(product_id: products(:one).id, 
                                 cart_id:carts(:one).id)

        line_item.quantity = 2
        assert_not line_item.destroy!

        line_item.quantity = 1
        assert line_item.destroy!

    end


end
</code></pre>

<p>this one produce this error in console during <code>rake test:models</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Failure:

  Expected # to be nil or false</p>
</blockquote>

<p>how can corrects these issues for the tests for controllers and the model of line_item?
Thank you for all the help.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:graphicImage id=""zoomImage"" value=""http://localhost:8080/ClothesJSF/image?id=#
{goods.id}"" style=""cursor:pointer"" width=""70"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It will work, but if i will use #{request.contextPath}/ this won't work. Maybe I need made some preference changes if I want #{request.contextPath}/image?id=# would work.</p>

<p>I have a user control which has a public property which is an enum type. In my aspx page I'm setting it's value declaratively. In the ascx I'm outputting the value to the page using <code>&lt;%= %&gt;</code> syntax. The value that is output by the echo syntax is always zero <code>0</code>. The enum does nopt have a zero value. </p>

<p>My question therefore is, is echo <code>&lt;%= %&gt;</code> syntax evaluated before the declared value is bound to the property?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>public enum Foo
{
    Bar = 1,
    Bahh = 2,
    BlackSheep = 3
}

// MyUserControl.cs
public class MyUserControl : UserControl
{
   public Foo Fizz { get; set; }
}

// MyUserControl.ascx
&lt;a href=""foo.aspx?foo=&lt;%= this.Fizz %&gt;""&gt;Foo&lt;/a&gt;

// MyPage.aspx
&lt;foo:MyUserControl runat=""server"" ID=""foo:MyUserControl1"" Fizz=""Bar"" /&gt;
&lt;foo:MyUserControl runat=""server"" ID=""foo:MyUserControl2"" Fizz=""Bahh"" /&gt;
&lt;foo:MyUserControl runat=""server"" ID=""foo:MyUserControl3"" Fizz=""BlackSheep"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The output is :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""foo.aspx?foo=0""&gt;Foo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""foo.aspx?foo=0""&gt;Foo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""foo.aspx?foo=0""&gt;Foo&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to assume that zero is the ""unset"" value for any enum member and therefore assume that <code>&lt;%=</code> is executed before the value is bound to the property.</p>

I don’t want to print the whole blog posts but only a set number of characters with a Read More link. Every post is saved as html in database from where it gets loaded. I currently strip all the html tags off from the post and display the set number of characters (e.g first 300) but I eventually lose all the styling. If I don’t strip the tags off then the truncated post gets various unclosed html tags which break the page especially on IE. The blog posts are entered through a different system of which I don’t have any control over. To overcome this issue, I have written a method that takes the html in a string adds all opening tags to an array list and as soon as a tag is closed removes it from the end of the array list so at the end the array list is only left with opening tags that have not closed. I check for those tags and replace each tag with its closing tag. Then I add all these closing tags to a string and append the string to the actual html string. When adding opening tags to the string I ignore all tags that include /> to avoid self closing tags. This is doing the job for me but my method is prone to bugs as html string is not predictable. Is there a better way around this issue ?</p>

The prefix is important for the calculation of the logical address. I read too, that default is ""ds"" and as soon as you use the ebp register to calculate an address, ""ss"" is used. For code ""cs"" is default. That all makes sense.
Now I have the following in c:</p>

<pre><code>int x; // some static var in ds

void test(int *p){
...
*p =5;

}

... main(){

test(&amp;x);
//now x is 5
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you now think about the implemention of test-function... you get the pointer to x on the stack. If you want to dereference the pointer, you first get the pointer-value(address of x) from the stack and save it in eax for example. Then you can dereference eax to change the value of x. But how does the c-compiler know if the given pointer(address) references memory on the stack (for example if i call test from another function and push the address of a localvariable as parameter for test) or the data segment? How is the full logical address calculated? The function cannot know which segment the given address offset relates to..?!</p>

<p>From what is said in the book, each memory address has one byte, and each byte has a memory address. </p>

<p>From what I'm reading about the EIP register, it points to the next set of instructions for the processor to do. While using debugging tools (GDB) to follow along in the book, if you were to examine memory at a particular location, say:</p>

<p>x/8xb it allegedly lets you examine the first 8 bytes at the memory address. But if each memory address has only 1 byte, I don't understand. Can someone help me understand this? I have looked for thorough explanations of how this register works and functions but I can't really find anything</p>

In other words, all the picture data for a intra frame (key frame) is stored in its entirety for that frame.  It's the following inter frames (P and B frames in H.264, I think) that depend on the data in other frames to be ""drawn.""</p>

<p>If these intra frames are completely independent, why isn't encoding an embarrassingly parallel problem?  If you had N processors and X I-frames, you could just give X/N chunks of the source to each processor to encode independently, then patch them all together at the end, right?  But it seems that this isn't the case--or at least, I haven't seen any encoders that have the kind of parallelization that being able to do this would give.  What am I not understanding?</p>

<p>If you click on the element and check the console it will only fire the focus, if you re-click it then fires the click. Ideally I want to fire both at the same time or just the click.</p>

  .To&lt;MembershipService&gt;()
  .WithConstructorArgument(""provider"", System.Web.Security.Membership.Provider));
</code></pre>

<p>I'm instantiating my Ninject module using the standard MVC3 pattern in the App_Start, specifically I am invoking the static Start() method using the WebActivator</p>

<pre><code>[assembly: WebActivator.PreApplicationStartMethod(typeof(MyProject.App_Start.NinjectMVC3), ""Start"")]

public static void Start()
{
    DynamicModuleUtility.RegisterModule(typeof(OnePerRequestModule));

}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I have is that at this point, the default System.Web.Security.Membership.Provider as not been established and the application errors on start-up.</p>

<p>To get over this problem, I have restructured the code by adding a WebActivator.PostApplicationStartMethod:</p>

<pre><code>[assembly: WebActivator.PreApplicationStartMethod(typeof(MyProject.App_Start.NinjectMVC3), ""Start"")]
[assembly: WebActivator.PostApplicationStartMethod(typeof(MyProject.App_Start.NinjectMVC3), ""PostStart"")]

public static void Start()
{
    DynamicModuleUtility.RegisterModule(typeof(OnePerRequestModule));

<p>and moving the bootstrapperInitialze() call into a PostStart() method:</p>

<pre><code>public static void PostStart()
{
    bootstrapper.Initialize(CreateKernel);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This resolves the problem, but I was wondering if a) this is likely to introduce other problems, or b) if there was an alternative approach?</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL DETAILS:
I have tried modifying the bindings as suggested, but I get the following compilation error:</p>

<p>'Ninject.Syntax.BindingRoot.Bind()' is a 'method', which is not valid in the given context</p>

<p>For information, here is the listing for my MembershipModule:</p>

<pre><code>public class MembershipModule : NinjectModule

<p>But the problem here is that its not showing modal popup when called from ajax error callback.<br>
I have checked google chrome no error are there. Also I tried calling modal('show') console it does display the popup. Also I tried calling popup on document load then also modal popup works.</p>

<p><br>
but only when called from ajax error callback it gives problem
<br>
<br>
<br>
More findings:<br>
1. This problem happens only when rails server is started in production mode<br>
2. Only backdrop is displayed but no modal. Modal is displayed after I click anywhere on backdrop. That time backdrop gets closed and modal popup is displayed.<br>
3. This problem happens only on safari.<br>
4. This problem happens only when safari tab is out of focus. If I am on the same tab and popup gets displayed. But If I am on the lets say 2nd tab and popup is being displayed on 1st tab. If I switch back to 1st tab then I only see backdrop.</p>

<p><br>
Here is the JSFiddle code
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/5y7725v5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/5y7725v5/</a>
RUn the code and quickly switch to other tab. Wait for some time then switch back to original tab. See no popup. Now run the code and stay on same tab whola!! popup is displayed</p>

If I find it I assign a high weight, otherwise I try to find it in the parent nodes (the list that holds x,y) and give it a moderate weight else I search in the root node and assign a minimum weight. The structure described is simply the relationship between the terms that I have categorized.</p>

Each ajax link loads 10 reviews and replaces the 10 previous ones. There is no url change or page refresh, just a simple content replacement. I also don't have a no-javascript fall back because Magento literally cannot function without it so it's a moot point.</p>

<p>I have researched ways to let search engines know to index this content, but all I can find is methods for full page indexing using Google's rel=""prev/next/canonical"" methods: <a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/09/pagination-with-relnext-and-relprev.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/09/pagination-with-relnext-and-relprev.html</a> and <a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/09/view-all-in-search-results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/09/view-all-in-search-results.html</a>.</p>

<p>These solutions don't seem to be relevant in my case because I'm not paginating the whole product page, but instead a portion of it. Using these methods search engines would see the product information (descriptions, titles, specs) on every page (product.html?reviewpage=2, for example) and flag for duplicate content. The view all solution would be far too cumbersome with as many reviews as we are getting.</p>

<p>Should I reconsider the way I'm displaying reviews? Can I direct search engines to a separate reviews page?</p>

I have a server and a client (operating through localhost). Server creates a clientthread for each connection. this new thread blocks on read waiting for messages from client. At will, i can deactivate the server through the GUI, which sends (from a main thread) ""disconnect"" to the client, and then closes the output stream, to wake up the blocked clientthread, which in turn finishes up by closing the socket (I believe this closing is unnecessary after closing outputstream but anyway).</p>

<p>Client side:
After connection request, it sleeps 10 seconds, writes a disconnect message and reads the answer char by char.</p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>After deactivating the server within that 10 second client sleep time, client reads the ""disconnect"" message correctly from the server. However, If I just add a dummy print for each char read (inside the while loop), the result of the final read is varying.
Sometimes it will read the server's ""disconnect"" correctly, sometimes it will read ""disco"", or a similar variation, and throw this exception:</p>

<p>""Java exception : ""Software caused connection abort: recv failed""</p>

<p>Any suggestions as to why adding a few prints creates this result? I would assume having a closed socket on the other end wouldn't have an effect on reading the message.
The other threads I found about recv errors mentioned timeouts, which I'm guessing shouldn't really be happening when using localhost?</p>

Here's my JavaScript at the moment:</p>

  }
  else if (fieldtype == 'select') {
    alert(selectoptions);
    newdiv.innerHTML = '&lt;div class=""form-item""&gt;&lt;label for=""' + cleanlabel + '_' + window[inputCounter] + '""&gt;' + fieldlabel + ' #' + window[inputCounter] + '&lt;/label&gt;&lt;select name=""' + cleanlabel + '_' + window[inputCounter] + '"" id=""' + cleanlabel + '_' + window[inputCounter] + '"" class=""' + inputclasses + '""&gt;

  }
  document.getElementById(cleanlabel + ""_additions"").appendChild(newdiv);
  document.getElementById(cleanlabel + ""_count"").value = window[inputCounter];
}
function removeInput(fieldlabel, inputCounter, fieldID){
  var element = document.getElementById(fieldlabel + fieldID);
  document.getElementById(fieldlabel + ""_additions"").removeChild(element);
  window[inputCounter]--;
  document.getElementById(fieldlabel + ""_count"").value = window[inputCounter];
}
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I'm calling the function in HTML like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""assignee_additions""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""javascript:addInput('Assignee','required-text', 'assigneeCounter', 'select', '&lt;?php print json_encode($assignto); ?&gt;');""&gt;Add Another Assignee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I set the value of ""fieldtype"" to input it works great and creates another input field as expected.  The remove function does its job too.  But what I really need is a select field, not an input field and that's where my lack of JavaScript knowledge is killing me.</p>

<p>Also, if anyone seems to think that jQuery is a better option here, I'm certainly open to that as well but I don't know that any better than I do traditional JavaScript.</p>

<p>As title says, i'm stuck on finding a way to get the first and last date of the current month with javascript or jquery, and format it as:</p>

<p>For example, for november it should be :</p>

<pre><code>var firstdate = '11/01/2012';
var lastdate = '11/30/2012';
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Once I refresh my page, the error disappears. 
I don't understand this error. In many forums, it was about the <code>System.Windows.Forms</code> assembly as the source of this error. This assembly was referenced in my WebSite project, but I removed it and the error still occurs. </p>

<p>But, as I said, the reported issue shown by the stack trace and the provided topics is from assemblies (its ""TypeLibraryTimeStampAttribute"" attribute to be more specific). But, my point, how can I know which assembly is it about ?</p>

<p>Moreover, I've deleted the reference to System.Windows.Form in my project, as suggested in the topics, but no result.</p>

<h3>EDIT 3</h3>

<p>A colleague opened the project on his computer, built it and ran it, without any error. Everything works fine with him. So, definitively, this issue in extern of code. 
I'm like John Locke on his island: Lost.</p>

<p>So I only have the problem when I enter in the page for the first time but if I delete the autofill text I see the background correctly.</p>

input.password {background: $crema url(""/assets/profile_password.png"") left no-repeat; background-size: 40px 40px;}

But when they run on TFS Build, some tests run significantly slower than others. 3 of them run in about 1-2 minutes, other 4 in 5-30 seconds, and the others in fractions of a second. I've noticed that all those slower tests use fakes from Microsoft Fakes, and each one of them is the first to run in it's class. But a lot of the other tests also use fakes (some more intensively) and run in regular time. I would like to know what may be causing that slowdown and how can I fix it.</p>

<p>Edit: I've noticed that every slower test runs after a mockless test. Maybe that slowdown is caused by the initialization of the ShimsContext. In my test classes, the ShimsContext is created and disposed on TestInitialize and TestCleanup methods. Does that affects significantly the performance?</p>

**ruby 2.1.0p0 (2013-12-25 revision 44422) [i686-linux]**

user@linux:/home/user/project$ ruby login.rb
===========
Gmail login
===========
please give your username (without @gmail.com) and password 
(they will not be show, so please type first, press RET, type password)
username: # waiting for username...
password: # waiting for password...
</code></pre>

<p>The Question is: using <code>gets.chomp</code>, the prompt display it username/password strings. I don't want this; I desire a functionality similar to UNIX-systems account login, i.e., prompt waiting for inputs, but without displaying them as user typing.</p>

<p>4 some refs, i put the used code:</p>

<pre><code>def respond_to(&amp;block)
  puts ""===========""
  puts ""Gmail login""
  puts ""===========""

  puts ""please give your username (without @gmail.com) and password (they will not be show, so please type first, press RET, type password)""

  Gmail.connect(""#{gets.chomp}@gmail.com"", ""#{gets.chomp}"") do |client|
    if client.logged_in?
      puts ""\n#{client.username} sucessfully logged in!\n""
      yield(false, client)
    else
      true
    end
  end

end
</code></pre>

A script runs periodically as a cron job to read the data from table and dispatch the emails via the SMTP server. I am using PHPMailer for the work here. The script runs a loop for sending emails until all the emails in the table have been sent.</p>

<p>The problem is that most consecutive emails being sent have a common subject. So when the loop runs, somehow all the emails that get sent have a long 'to' list. So basically if 5 email entries (with different <strong>to</strong> addresses) have the same subject and same content, then it ends up sending only 1 email with 5 addresses (one of each email entry) in the 'to' field. This reveals the email address of every person to everyone else on the list. This is undesirable and the emails must be sent to only that one person for whom it is meant. </p>

We can pass the DKIM verification check on Port25's tester if we enable <strong>""FixCRLF yes""</strong> in the opendkim config.  However, this still <strong>FAILS</strong> Gmail DKIM verification.</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li><p>The client should
save the file in the ""client""
subdirectory of the home directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Test your program. Be sure it works
with binary files, not just text
files. Be sure it works when both
programs are on the same machine as
well as when they are separated over
the network.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Thus far when I start the server it asks what port I want to use.  Then I start the client and it asks what IP and port to use.  The the server immediately sends a list of the files in the home directory ""server"" folder.  I then respond with the client with the file number I wish to download.  This is where I get stuck.  I can't seem to find any information about how to do this.  So as you can see in my code posted below, I am trying to use a FileInputReader to convert the file to an array of bytes.  Then I am sending that to the client.  I am then trying to FileOutputReader the recieved array of bytes to a file.  But I can't seem to find the correct methods to do that, or even if I am doing that correctly.</p>

<p><strong>CLIENT</strong></p>

<pre><code>        int i = 0;
        while(i &lt; 1000){
        String modifiedSentence = inFromServer.readLine();
        System.out.println(""From Server: "" + modifiedSentence);
        i++;
        }

        while(j &lt; 1000) {
        int byteString = inFromServer.read();
        ArrayList&lt;byte[]&gt; bytes = new ArrayList&lt;byte[]&gt;();
        bytes.add(byteString);
        }
        Integer byteInt = new Integer(byteString);
        FileOutputStream fo = new FileOutputStream(System.getProperty(""user.home"")+ ""/client/text.txt"");
        fo.write(byteInt.byteValue());

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>SERVER</strong></p>

<pre><code>            byte[] bytes = new byte[1024];
            FileInputStream fi = new FileInputStream(file.toString() + fileArray[userChoiceInt]);
            fi.read(bytes, 0, 1024);
            outToClient.write(bytes, 0, 1024);

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If anyone could offer any advice or the correct classes or methods to use I would appreciate it. </p>

<p>}</p>

<p>That's the gist anyway. The problem is that while the background color is being set correctly, anytime I scroll the table view, the custom UILabel I insert disappears. Maybe this stems from a misunderstanding of  dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier but regardless, I would think that the label would be reinserted.</p>

<p>I use twitter bootstrap and will_paginate (enhanced to endless pagination) with my current project and the goal is to use a fluid layout to display all items in a 4 column format. However, after the second page is loaded, the endless page breaks and will_paginate is displayed instead.</p>

<p>This is how the page loads when accessing for the first time
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XYmjS.png"" alt=""page1""></p>

<p>It follows correctly the fluid nesting as described in <a href=""http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#fluidGridSystem"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter bootsrap page</a> and generally looks good except for the misalignment.</p>

<p>After the second page loads, the page looks like this:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pzBuX.png"" alt=""page2""></p>

<p>and the layout is really messed up. Instead of each element from column 1 being in a ""span3"" class of it's own, the whole column is a""span3"" containing other ""span3"" elements. </p>

<p>Ok , here's the code:</p>

<p>_kindergarten.html.erb</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""span3"" id=""kindergartens""&gt;
    &lt;%= link_to kindergarten.name, kindergarten %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>index.html.erb</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""row-fluid""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""span12""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""row-fluid""&gt;
            &lt;%= render @kindergartens %&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=""pull-right""&gt;
            &lt;%= will_paginate %&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the following code is used for endless pagination (<a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/114-endless-page-revised"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>):</p>

<p>kindergartens.js.coffee</p>

<pre><code>jQuery -&gt;
  if $('.pagination').length
    $(window).scroll -&gt;
      url = $('.pagination .next_page').attr('href')
      if url &amp;&amp; $(window).scrollTop() &gt; $(document).height() - $(window).height() - 50
        $('.pagination').html('&lt;img src=""assets/spinner.gif"" /&gt;')
        $.getScript(url)
    $(window).scroll()
</code></pre>

<p>index.js.erb</p>

<pre><code>$('#kindergartens').append('&lt;%= escape_javascript(render(@kindergartens)) %&gt;');
&lt;% if @kindergartens.next_page %&gt;
  $('.pagination').replaceWith('&lt;%= escape_javascript(will_paginate(@kindergartens)) %&gt;');
&lt;% else %&gt;
  $('.pagination').remove();
&lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% sleep 1 %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately my js skills are zero so I can't provide any support except for what I've learnt in that tutorial.</p>

<p>So, in the end, my question is this: How do I display these kindergartens in four columns using bootstrap's fluid grid and endless pagination? </p>

<p>I need to keep original photo resolution even though frame or screen does not allow more than 320 by 480 pixels (2:3) and insert frame and then text. I do not care much about text as long as I can preserve image within frame.</p>

<p>All I need is advice on how to approach this issue: I need framework classes and perhaps hints into methods (functions, messages) that I can use either to work the image as a bitmap or as a jpeg or png.</p>

<p><strong>Cannot do:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>My project manager's idea: send it into a converter webpage (I cannot remember http address) in God knows which format and God knows how to indicate webpage to merge all views and then wait for it to get back to the phone and save it. POstcard creation must be done locally in case Ipad users want to create them and then save them into PC or something (personally, I would like to exhaust all resources from iPhone development framework has to offer).</p></li>
<li><p>Get the current context which merges all three UIViews classes/subclasses. Great for 320 by 480 but not for larger resolutions.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Yeah, thanks a lot for your answer-- that is my approach. I thought there was a better way like handling the image and the text as bitmap data, raw data or something else to preserve original information better.</p>

<p>But I still have one little issue which bugs me a little: The image (inside the frame) must be selected from the image library or the camera controller, but hey, it brings you one object (the image in size to fit the screen) and a dictionary which amazingly brings the original image too. Now, there are two objects. But the postcard must be generated in 4 different resolutions and bringing the four ""versions"" of the image would create a huge memory overhead.</p>

<p>How can I avoid this? Should I use the reference to the following dictionary elements to bring them from memory, create postcard, send it over network and then destroy them?                </p>

<pre><code>NSString *const UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL;

NSString *const UIImagePickerControllerReferenceURL; 
</code></pre>

<p>in the obj-c doc are objects that point to original info... I just want to reduce the overhead by alloc and dealloc when needed.</p>

<p>So, my actual situation is, for example, a simple user's table:</p>

<pre><code>id | name | surname | nickname | email       | phone
1  | foo  | bar     | foobar   | foo@bar.com | 99999
</code></pre>

<p>Thats it.</p>

<p>But, lets say that one of my customer would like to have 2 email addresses, or phone numbers, for one specific user.</p>

<p>Untill now, i used to solve that problem simply adding columns in the users table:</p>

<pre><code>id | name | surname | nickname | email       | phone | email_two    | phone_two
1  | foo  | bar     | foobar   | foo@bar.com | 99999 | foo@bar.net  | 999998
</code></pre>

<p>But i cant use that way with the new application's version.. i'll like to be drinking mojito after that, dont like costumer's call to edit the structure :)</p>

<p>So, i thought a solution where people can define customs field, simply with another table:</p>

<pre><code>id | table_refer | type_field | id_object | value
1  | users       | phone      | 1         | 999998
2  | users       | email      | 1         | foo@bar.net
</code></pre>

<p>keeping the users table unaltered.</p>

<p>But this way have 2 problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>For what i know, there is no possibility to use foreigns key in that way, that if i delete 1 user automatically the foreign key delete in cascade all the row in the second table that have the 'table_refer' value=users and the id_object=users.id. Sure, i'll can use some triggers function, but i'll lose some of the reliability.</li>
<li>When i'll need to query the database, fore retrieve the users that match 'foo@bar.net', i'll have to check all the... hem.. option_table as well, and that will make my code complex and less-reliable and messy with many joins.. assuming that the users table wont be the only one 'extended' by the 'option_table', seem to be a gray view.</li>
</ol>

<p>My goal is to let my customers adding as many custom fields as they need, for almost all the object in the application (users, items, invoices, print views, photos, news, etc...), assuming that most of those table would be partitioned (splitted in 2 table, with a 3 table and inheritance gerarchy).</p>

<p>You think my way can be good, do you know some other better, or am i in a big mistake?
Please, every suggest is gold now!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: </p>

<p>What i'm lookin for could be simplifyed ith the 'articles-custom-fields' in wordpress blogs.
My goal is to let the user to define new fields that he needs, for example, if my users table is the one above, and a customer need a field that i havent prevent, like the web-site url, he must be able to add it dinamically, without edit the database structure, but just the data.</p>

<p>I think that the 2° table (maibe 1 for each object) can be a good solution, but i am still waiting for better ways!</p>

<pre><code>collection.find({""myField.""+variable : {$exists: true})

<p>But obviously that doesn't work because the collections doesn't take strings. Instead, I tried building a a fully query string in JSON but that won't parse correctly because I'm just searching for a field name and not an entire object</p>

<pre><code>var qry = '{""myField.'+variable+'""}'; //no go

<p>I've also tried the meteor collection fields logic </p>

<pre><code>var qry = 'myField.'+variable; 
collection.find({}, {fields: {qry: 1}})

<p>to no avail. I know that a query can take a JSON object but I'm not sure how to write this up.</p>

<p>To achieve the method of showing different fields I am attempting to create a HTMLHelper extension which accepts a <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;TModel,TProperty&gt;&gt;</code> as a parameter, which would contain the properties of a class required for display in the control. For example:</p>

<p>The view:</p>

<pre><code>@model Project.Core.Page
@Html.MyHelper(p =&gt; new { p.Author.Name, p.Author.Location, p.Author.Age });
</code></pre>

<p>It's the extension I'm having problems with - how can I iterate over the provided params in the lambda to provide each with a <code>TextBoxFor()</code>, or even manually create a <code>input</code> element and populate it with the <code>value</code> and <code>name</code> of the lambda parameter?</p>

<p>The extention in psuedo:</p>

<pre><code>public static MvcHtmlString MyHelper&lt;TModel,TProperty&gt;(
    this HtmlHelper&lt;TModel&gt; helper, 
    Expression&lt;Func&lt;TModel,TProperty&gt;&gt; expression) {
    foreach (var parameter in expression.???) {
        // helper.TextBoxFor(???) 
        // TagBuilder(""input"").Attributes(""name"", expression.???)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I feel like I've been staring at this for far too long, and I'm also feeling there's a more simple way I'm overlooking of achieving this.</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated. If you need further details, or I've missed something important, let me know.</p>
