<p>This should be an attribute <em>I think</em> and I want to include it in my export. I tried the obvious ""serverName"" but am pretty sure this is incorrect since the field does not return a value.

Many of the validations will be common like Request object should not be null and employee id/customer ID (in the request message) should not be 0 and things like that. I am guessing that since the Request objects themselves are separate objects, passing them into a static method should not cause any thread-safety issues.

The way I am doing the association is to use a database table to correlate each <code>tagId</code> with the <code>postId</code>. Each Post can have multiple tags.</p>

<p>After I retrieve an array of <code>{tagId : 'tagId, postId: 'postId'}</code> objects, I need to retrieve the tag names for each <code>tagId</code>. I am using the <code>async</code> library, but the array of tag names (String) returns an empty one, from the logging info, I can see that the return happens before the completion of the iterator function. My code is following:</p>

<pre><code>var tagIdPostIds = [
{tagId : 'abcx', postId: 1},
{tagId : 'abce', postId: 1},
{tagId : 'abcd', postId: 1},
];

if (tagIdPostIds) {
        var tagsArr = []; //container of tag names

        var findTagById = function(tagIdPostIdObj, cb) {
          var tagId = tagIdPostIdObj.tagId;

          Tag.findOneById(tagId, function (err, foundTag) {
            if (err) return sendErrorMsgCode(res, ""error in retrieving a tag"", 401);

            if (foundTag) {
              sails.log.info('pushing in tag: ' + foundTag.tagName);
              tagsArr.push(foundTag.tagName);
            }
          });

          cb(); //without this, the program just hangs, but why??

        }; //findTagById


        var retTagNames = function(err) {
          if (err) return sendErrorMsgCode(res, ""error in assembling tag names"", 401);
          sails.log.info('returning tagsArr: ' + JSON.stringify(tagsArr));
          return res.json(tagsArr);
        }; //retTagNames

        async.eachSeries(tagIdPostIds, findTagById, retTagNames);
      }
</code></pre>

<p>After reading the documentation of <code>async</code>, I think <code>async.map()</code> may be what I need to assemble all tags for a given <code>postId</code>. Or my way of using <code>async.eachSeries()</code> is wrong? </p>

<p>As you can see, I'm getting a specific position in multiple lists, which works quite well. </p>

<p>The problem I'm trying to solve: These lists have up to 16 positions, which I have to render. I could of course copy/paste the above <code>&lt;tr&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;</code> block 16 times into the template, and edit the line positions, but I'm quite sure that there is a better, more automated, way; however, I wasn't able to find this out on my own up until now.</p>

<p>Could anyone point me into the correct direction? </p>

<p>I have <strong>sidebar</strong> which contains a list of tags, when you click on a tag I use the <code>TagDetailsFactory</code> to send a tag into the scope of the <strong>view</strong> controller.</p>

<p>Everything works great except for when you hover over a tag in the TagDetailsFactory scope.</p>

<p>The <code>tagDetails</code> template does not show up, however if you hover over the same tag in the sidebar scope, the <code>tagDetails</code> shows up in both. This is wrong.</p>

<p>Hovering over a tag in the sidebar should only show the tag details for that tag and the same for the tags inside the view scope.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hovering over a tag in the view scope, doesn't display it's details <br/>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WmmsN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Hovering over a tag inside of the sidebar scope, should only show details for it's tag, and not the tag in the view scope, like it does here:<br/>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong><br/>
- The first tags Array is in the cnt controller
- When you click on a tag, it gets stored in the TagDetailsFactory service
- I then broadcast an event to the view controller to then call the getTagDetails function in TagDetailsFactory to retrieve the saved tags and store them into the viewTags array in the view controller.</p>

In C++, when an object is thrown it is first copied to a temporary object, and the temporary object is then passed to the catching code. The copy involves the use of the object's class copy constructor. AFAIK, this means that if a class has a private copy constructor, it can't be used as an exception. However, in VS2010, the following code compiles and runs:</p>

<pre><code>class Except
{
    Except(const Except&amp; other) { i = 2; }
public:
    int i;
    Except() : i(1) {}
};

int main()

    try

<p>The CSS snippet <code>@media print{@page {size: landscape}}</code> works fine, but I'm not sure how to make it work from javascript/jquery. The reason I'm trying to do this through javascript is because I want 2 buttons for printing. One normal print button which will print the content like it's displayed, and a second button which changes the page a bit and prints it landscape mode.</p>

<p>So in short:
I want to change the page orientation (or size as it's called in CSS) to landscape in javascript but the javascript rotation won't do because it also rotates the text on the page. Is there a way to achieve what I'm trying to do without making a separate page using a different layout/CSS?</p>

"12845881","1","12845964","","2012-10-11 18:07:51","","7","5293","<p>I am posed with the following problem: I need to split work across multiple threads for perfomance reasons, but I am not sure what approach to take.</p>

<p>Firstly, the task I would be supplying should return a value and take a parameter. Additionally, the main method (doing the main bit of work, not <code>static main()</code> ) is already running on separate thread and is invoked periodically. Also, this method must at some point WAIT for all threads to finish and then proceed.</p>

<p>One approach (most obvious to me) is to schedule each job on a separate thread and store results in class vars:</p>

<pre><code>public Object result1, result2;

public void mainMethod() throws InterruptedException {
    final Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            result1 = expensiveMethod(""param1"");
        }
    });

    final Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            result2 = expensiveMethod(""param2"");
        }
    });

    thread1.join();
    thread.join();

    //Do rest of work
}

private Object expensiveMethod(Object param){
    // Do work and return result
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit ugly and not ideal, since as I said, mainMethod is invoked many times, and I do not want any race conditions on setting the result variables. Ideally, I would like to make them local variables, but I cannot make them accessible from within the run method, unless they are final, and then I cannot assign values to them...</p>

<p>ANother approach i though about doing was this:</p>

<pre><code>public void mainMethod() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
    String obj1, obj2;

    final ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(16);
    final Future&lt;String&gt; res1 = executorService.submit(new Callable&lt;String&gt;() {
        @Override
        public String call() throws Exception {
            return expensiveMethod(""param1"");
        }
    });
    final Future&lt;String&gt; res2 = executorService.submit(new Callable&lt;String&gt;() {
        @Override
        public String call() throws Exception {
            return expensiveMethod(""param2"");
        }
    });

    obj1 = res1.get();
    obj2 = res2.get();

}

private String expensiveMethod(String param) {
    // Do work and return result
}
</code></pre>

<p>This automatically waits on these two computations from main method and allows me to store the results locally. What to you guys think? Any other approaches?</p>

<p>Should I write it in Python? I'm worried about performance here. Also, I've written large Python apps before, and I found that Python scales poorly to large code bases, because of the lack of static analysis.</p>

<p>What do you write yours in?</p>

  private:
    QFile file;
    QDataStream read;
    double bufferFloat;
    quint32 bufferInteger
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is now that when init() is called, the a file should be opened and navigated into a location where the data starts. Now, every time getData() is called, a chunk of bytes should be read from the file.</p>

<p>Pseudo-code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>void ReadFile::init()
{
  file.setFileName(""..."");
  file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);
  QDataStream read(&amp;file);

  // This chunk does some magic to find correct location by applying
  // a readout (read &gt;&gt; bufferInteger) and check the result

  // I can verify that at this point, if doing a readout (read &gt;&gt; bufferFloat)
  // I get good data (i.e. corresponding to the file).
}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>QList&lt;double&gt; ReadFile::getData()
{
  // Doing a (read &gt;&gt; bufferFloat) at this point will result in zeros.
}
</code></pre>

<p>I understand why this happens, since the <code>read</code> in <code>init</code> is declared locally. But how should I allocate the data stream so <code>getData</code> can pick up where <code>init</code> left off? And the next <code>getData</code> can pick up where the previous left off. A call sequence would look like:</p>

<pre><code>ReadFile file();
file.init();
file.readData();
file.readData();
file.readData();
file.readData();
//etc...

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: How is stand-alone function loading commonly handled:</p>

<p>If I add an index to a table, create a fk relationship, there's a good chance that the designer will show a 'object null reference exception' when I try do do anything with the database afterwards.

"28507898","1","","","2015-02-13 20:07:38","","0","89","<p><strong>Question (Formally)</strong></p>

<p>I have a flat table <em>df</em> with columns <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>e</em> where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are one-to-many, as are (<em>b</em> and <em>c</em>) and (<em>c</em> and <em>d</em>).  <em>d</em> is a unique index, and <em>e</em> is an arbitrary integer.  </p>

<p>Let <em>grouped = df.groupby(by=['a','b','c'])</em>.  Each group will then essentially consist of its label and a set of key-value pairs <em>{d</em>:<em>e}</em>.  I want to keep all rows in some group <em>x</em> if there is no other group <em>y</em> in <em>grouped</em> such that</p>

<ul>
<li><em>x.a == y.a</em></li>
<li><em>x.b != y.b</em></li>
<li>for any value <em>p</em> in <em>x.e</em>, and any value <em>u</em> in <em>y.e</em> , <em>abs(p - u) &lt; 100</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If any group <em>y</em> meets these conditions, then no rows from <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> should be in the final result.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Same question, applied</strong></p>

<p>I am using this in the context of bioinformatics.  Specifically, <em>(a,b,c,d,e) = (chromosome, strand, gene_id, transcript_id, transcription_start_site)</em>.  Every gene is on exactly one strand ('+' or '-', corresponding to the two strands of the DNA double helix) of exactly one chromosome, and every gene has at least one transcript.  Each transcript has a transcription start site (TSS), which is the integer position of the transcript on its chromosome measured in nucleotide base pairs (bp).  Two transcripts of the same gene may or many not share a TSS.  </p>

<p>In biological terms, I want to find genes that do not have bi-direction promoters.  This means I want to find all genes that have no transcripts with start sites within some <em>n</em> of any transcription start site of a gene on the <em>opposite</em> strand.  As a side-note, for ease of example I chose <em>n=100</em>, but a more biologically accurate <em>n</em> would likely be in the range of 150 to 1000.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Example data</strong></p>

<pre><code>a = chromosome    b = strand    c = gene_id    d = transcript_id    e = tss
  chr1              +             ENSG001        ENST001             11865
  chr1              +             ENSG001        ENST002             11868
  chr1              +             ENSG001        ENST003             12006
  chr1              -             ENSG002        ENST004             29370
  chr1              -             ENSG002        ENST005             24886
  chr1              +             ENSG003        ENST006             29550
</code></pre>

<p>If this was the complete list of data and <em>n=100</em>, all rows would be included in the answer.  However, if <em>n=1000</em>, only the first three rows where gene_id=ENSG001 should be included.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>

<p>The table is huge, so doing a giant cartesian, paring it to down, etc. isn't feasible (and also would be ugly).  Which pandas/numpy methods could I use to select rows fitting my criteria cleanly and efficiently?  Should I be using something other than groupby, or hierarchal indexing or something?  I'm not particularly familiar with pandas syntax, so explicit examples would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>In here, <code>class Unit</code> inherits the three classes above it, what I want to know is, how much should be limited when inheriting things? As in, <code>class Object : class, class, class... etc</code>.  Should the number of inherited classes be limited to a smaller amount and have classes made in-between that have already inherited some of the abstract base classes? I know this question is kind of meh, but I desire to keep good habits and I thank you for helping me if you can.</p>

<p>Also, any other advice for good habits in OOP and such would also be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Let's take the following code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-ruby prettyprint-override""><code># app/models/category.rb
class Category &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  before_validation :set_order

  # Associations ------------------
  belongs_to :company

  # Validations -------------------
  validates :name, :order, :presence =&gt; true
  validates :order, :uniqueness =&gt; { :scope =&gt; :company, :message =&gt; ""order should be unique"" }

  def set_order
    return unless self.order.nil? || self.order.blank?

    company_categories = self.template &amp;&amp; self.company.categories.template || self.company.categories.non_template
    self.order = (company_categories.empty? &amp;&amp; 1) || (company_categories.map(&amp;:order).sort.last + 1)
  end
end

# spec/factories/companies.rb
Fabricator :company do
  Fabricate.sequence(:name) { |n| ""Company #{n}"" }
  creation_date Date.today
  template false
end


# spec/factories/categories.rb
Fabricator :category do
  name [""Business"", ""Finance"", ""Analytics""][Random.rand(3)]
  template false
  company
end


# spec/models/category_spec.rb
require 'spec_helper'

describe Category do
  let(:category) { Fabricate(:category) }

  it ""has a valid factory"" do
    category.should be_valid
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Every time I run the spec, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>1) Category has a valid factory
   Failure/Error: let(:category) { Fabricate(:category) }
   ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid:
     PG::Error: ERROR:  column categories.company does not exist

   # ./spec/models/category_spec.rb:7:in `block (2 levels) in &lt;top (required)&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the association is not set properly. To sql query is ""categories"".""company"" and not ""categories"".""company_id"". It is super weird.</p>

I don't know much about C# so therefore I have used online C# to VB.NET-converters. Now I am stuck with some code which I believe the online-converter was not able to ""translate"" properly.</p>

<p>When running the code I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>System.IndexOutOfRangeException was unhandled
  Message=""IndexOutOfRangeException""
  StackTrace:
    at System.String.get_Chars()
.........
</code></pre>

<p>I really don't understand the reason for this error. I believe this error might be due either:
- to the fact that C# is able to automatically convert an integer variable into a string (while VB.NET needs the ""toString-method"") 
- or due to the fact C# is using an incremental operator which is not supported by VB.NET.</p>

<p>Here is the original code-snippet in C# where ""m_primaryKey"" is a StringBuilder-object:</p>

<pre><code>private void addMetaphoneCharacter(String primaryCharacter, String alternateCharacter)
        {
            //Is the primary character valid?
            if (primaryCharacter.Length &gt; 0)
            {
                int idx = 0;
                while (idx &lt; primaryCharacter.Length)
                {
                    m_primaryKey.Length++;
                    m_primaryKey[m_primaryKeyLength++] = primaryCharacter[idx++];
                }
            }
            //other code deleted
</code></pre>

<p>This original code works when using a class-library created in C#.</p>

<p>Here is the converted code in VB.NET which gives me the error mentioned earlier:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub addMetaphoneCharacter(ByVal primaryCharacter As String, ByVal alternateCharacter As String)
            'Is the primary character valid? 
            If primaryCharacter.Length &gt; 0 Then
                Dim idx As Integer = 0
                While idx &lt; primaryCharacter.Length
                    m_primaryKey.Length += 1
                    m_primaryKey(System.Math.Max(System.Threading.Interlocked.Increment(m_primaryKeyLength), _
                        m_primaryKeyLength - 1)) = primaryCharacter _
                        (System.Math.Max(System.Threading.Interlocked.Increment(idx), idx - 1))

<p>The original code may be found <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/dmetaphone5.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""here"">here.</a></p>

<p>I should say that the code in the class is quite advanced for me (I'm a hobby programmer but learning every day) so maybe I don't see obvious things but this is the reason why I am asking you.</p>

<p>Can you please give me any hints to sort out this problem? </p>

The scope.$watch doesn't fire when the backing data changes.</p>

<p>Why not just use the one with isolate scope, you ask?  Well, my understanding is that you should ONLY use isolate scope if your directive has a template.</p>

<p>The only differences in the directives is:</p>

<pre><code>// works
app.directive('doesFocus', function ($timeout) {
    return {
        scope: { trigger: '@doesFocus' },
        link: function (scope, element) {

              // sets focus
            }
            ...

// does not work, and in fact when I inspect attrs.doesNotFocus it is undefined
app.directive('doesNotFocus', function ($timeout) {
    return {
        scope: false,

<p>I'm on week 3 of using Angular, so I must be missing some silly semantic issue.</p>

<p>Here is a fiddle illustrating my issue.

<p><hr><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>My actual problem was that my real code was like this (hazard of mocking the problem, you sometimes mask the real problem):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input should-focus=""{{isDrawerOpen()}"" ... &gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but because I was using a function, not a property, I was missing the required ticks</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input should-focus=""{{'isDrawerOpen()'}}"" ... &gt;&lt;/input&gt;

<p>Making this change fixed the problem and my directive can still be like this:</p>

<pre><code>scope.$watch(attrs.shouldFocus, focusCallback(newValue));

<p>So I have the following running in an index.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php  

    if(isset($_COOKIE['language'])) {
        if (($_COOKIE['language']) == 'en')
            print ""&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=\""JavaScript\""&gt;window.location=\""URLGOESHERE\""&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;"";  
        elseif (($_COOKIE['language']) == 'fr') 
            print ""&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=\""JavaScript\""&gt;window.location=\""URLGOESHERE\""&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;"";
    }
    else {
        print ""&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=\""JavaScript\""&gt;window.location=\""URL-FOR-COOKIE-SETTING-PAGE\""&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;"";
    }
    ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The ""else"" statement redirect goes to the page where the user sets their language preference, and once they do so, that page sets a cookie then sends them to the proper version of the site. However, when the user goes back to this main index.php, it cannot seem to find the cookie and skips right to the ""else"" statement. The redirects used to be used done with PHP using 'header,' and it didn't work then either. I had read elsewhere that that could pose some troubles, so I switched it to try printing Javascript.</p>

<p>The weird thing is that I can find the cookie as soon as it is set, exactly where it should be, with the correct name and variable all present. I've done it exactly like the books tell me to (to my knowledge). I've tried this both in Firefox and Safari with no luck.</p>

<p>What did I miss?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Here's the script that actually sets the cookie. The parameter is sent from the link via a url encode like this: <code>&lt;a href=""setlang.php?lang=en""&gt;</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 

$lang = urlencode($_GET[""lang""]);

setcookie(""language"", $lang, time()+60*60*24*90, "".URL"");

switch ($lang) {

case 'en':
header('Location:  URLGOESHERE');
break;

case 'fr':
header('Location:  URLGOESHERE');
break;
}

<p>With normal interface default ACL, which is ""permit ip any any"" on inside interface (Level 100), ""deny ip any any"" on outside interface (level 0). NFS server is connected to outside interface. Everything works great. By look at the the packets go through, I can see inside PC call NFS server's 111 port, negotiate  a port using portmap. Finished this TCP connection. Then NFS server (outside PC) use the negotiated port to connect to inside PC and transfers data. Cisco ASA firewall keep TCP states very well and ""remembered"" the negotiated port, thus let outside PC using this port to talk to inside PC even the outside ACL is ""deny ip any any"". The firewall is fully stateful, every thing is great so far.</p>

<p>However, as long as I connected the NFS server (outside PC) to Cisco ASA firewall using VPN. Everything changed. By look at the packets, NFS can still go through firewall and negotiate a port by portmap. While after this TCP session is over. Firewall FORGET the negotiated port and block the outside PC using negotiated port to talk back to inside PC.</p>

<p>With or without VPN is the only change. There is just one ACL, on inside interface, permit ip any any. The NFS server is set to can be access from any subnet. There is no NAT and no service-policies setup on this firewall.</p>

<p>Can anyone please explain why Cisco Firewall rules is not ""stateful"" anymore over VPN? Is it designed to be? What is the best way to let NFS working over VPN without open a range of dynamical ports on outside interface?</p>

"2609739","1","2618489","","2010-04-09 18:05:58","","0","106","<p>I need to decide on a method for storing a subset of the content in a SharePoint site, so that when I delete and recreate certain lists as part of a feature activation, I can re-insert all of this content back where it should belong.  I have an idea myself, but I don't know if it's the only method and more importantly, the right method.</p>

<p>My client has me creating a SharePoint system for them to communicate with <em>their</em> clients. The business process has maybe 5 stages in it (maybe it's more, I don't even know because they don't tell me everything), and the current system I've written over the past months is maybe 2 stages through. This meets our deadline of completing those systems by Monday next week... but at that point my client is planning on making the site live from that point. </p>

<p>In effect, their work with their clients will be running parallel with my work for them. As I complete my own work on a separate test server, I'll push each following stage of the process onto the live server. Scheduled downtimes during non-business times (like a weekend) will be available for me to perform these pushes. Keeping pace so that my development is faster than the actual business process is my own problem and off-topic... so let's get back to the problem I stated at the start of this post.</p>

<p>In this system, we have sets of features which will create lists for their associated content types and field types when activated, and delete these lists when the feature is deactivated. Most updates don't need to deactivate and reactivate these features, such as workflow changes, custom actions, custom forms, and similar ilk. But there are some parts which do require this. On my test server, it's okay for me to obliterate lists, but once the site is live and there's real correspondence data, it's absolutely unacceptable to do this. So when I need to implement a new change in functionality, I need to be able to store the currently present data in several lists, deactivate the feature, reactivate the feature, and restore all of this data.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have hoist myself by my own petard with the feature system I implemented. Unfortunately, the necessity to later on make several of these ""project sites"" meant I had to do a lot of my code with the concept of ""Can be deployed repeatedly"" in mind.</p>

<p>My current plan is to run through lists and libraries which will be affected by the particular feature that is to be reset. Files and all of their versions will be saved in a directory on the server. Then, a set of text files will be used to store all of the important field values for the items. This includes a lot of cross-list reference lookups that will need to be maintained, but that's simple enough. Then, I deactivate the feature, deploy the new solution, and reactivate the feature. We upload all of the files in the order specified by their versions and update them with the stored fields for those versions, so that we retain the version structure. As each one is first uploaded, the new ID is picked out, and all relevant lookups in the rest of the files are updated (in some manner that I make sure I don't re-update it later with an incorrect value, of course). After that, we run through all the rest of the items in the order most conducive to keeping the relational data correct. This roughly summarizes what my current plan is. To my advantage, there are no long running workflows in the system that will be affected by this, so there's nothing I will have to worry about making sure nothing is ""still running"" when I do this stuff.</p>

<p>I don't really know all the cons of this approach... I can imagine they're quite hefty. But I'm unsure what other choices I even have, and my searches haven't turned up anything. Is there anyone who can think of a better idea? Or will anyone just tell me that I really have no other choice? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I cloned the official selenium git repo, changed the code a bit (need to dump the page into some specified dirs), and tried to rebuilt it:</p>

<pre><code>./go //java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server:server:uber //java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium:client-combined:uber
</code></pre>

<p>It was successful but when I tried to execute it I got this:</p>

<pre><code>$ java -jar build/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/server-standalone.jar 
Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from
build/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/server-standalone.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Tried to check classpath, CLASS_PATH and CLASSPATH env variables (as a friend of mine suggested) - I simply don't have any.</p>

<p>At the same time, the pre-compiled standalone server from the official downloads works out of the box.</p>

<p>The official docs didn't help. There's nothing about it there.</p>

<p>So - I need a quick advice how to compile it? Thanks.</p>

<p>P.S. JDK 8 (latest), Mac OS 10.7</p>

<p>P.P.S. That friend of mine tried to build it by himself and he was lucky - he got a new build/dist folder where the target big file was. But in my case, the build folder is created, but there's not 'dist' folder in it.</p>

(
    [GreekWord] =&gt; ανθρωπομήνας
    [selectedRes] =&gt; 1
)
</code></pre>

<p>so the exception in the .dll occurs for the given parameters. I tested it myself in the app by entering the specific word and the error did not occur. Then I tested to see by entering the encoded URL directly in the address bar and the error was reproduced. So in order to see if there is something wrong with the encoding, i did in javascript</p>

<pre><code>encodeURIcomponent(""ανθρωπομήνας"")
</code></pre>

<p>and the result is :</p>

<pre><code>%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B8%CF%81%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%AE%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%82
</code></pre>

<p>which is very different from the GET parameter above in the php log. Then i tried to decode the url get parameter as seen in the php file with :</p>

<pre><code>decodeURIcomponent(""%E1%ED%E8%F1%F9%F0%EF%EC%DE%ED%E1%F2"")
</code></pre>

<p>and javascript says : <strong>malformed URI sequence</strong>. Why is this happening ? Obviously the application crashes because the particular URL parameter is malformed, not a proper one.</p>

<p>Now, my problem is, how can I see if the encoded string is a proper one or a corrupted one ? ( Though I'm not sure why php seems to decode it kind of correctly in the logs, when javascript says it's malformed ).</p>

"15378493","1","15454686","","2013-03-13 06:31:08","","2","1889","<p>I am currently having trouble with drawing to a custom <code>SurfaceView</code> from a thread that is not on my main UI. This <code>SurfaceView</code> takes up the entirety of the screen (Galaxy S3 in full screen) and must be updated from several sources. </p>

<p>The problem is that the custom <code>SurfaceView</code> will not save changes between updates to UI.</p>

<p>The custom <code>SurfaceView</code> class is defined within the activity that uses it, and the thread (let's call it <code>DrawingThread</code>) that runs periodic checks for updates is defined within the custom <code>SurfaceView</code> class. I have done this similar to <a href=""http://danielnadeau.blogspot.com/2012/01/android-canvas-beginners-tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Another external thread is updating a list of changes that must be made to the UI. <code>DrawingThread</code> checks this list every 50ms or so, and if the list is not empty, calculates a rectangle that must be redrawn.</p>

<pre><code>// Thread waits for change request to UI or kill order
// Build Rect at point of Touch
try {
    Canvas = _surfaceHolder.lockCanvas(Rect); 
    synchronized (_surfaceHolder) {
        postInvalidate(); //Calls custom SurfaceView's onDraw() with the correct Canvas
    }
} finally {
    if (Canvas != null) {
        _surfaceHolder.unlockCanvasAndPost(Canvas);
    }
}
// Loop
</code></pre>

<p>My <code>onDraw()</code> method for the custom <code>SurfaceView</code> is below:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
    // Initialize vars for rectangle
    Paint.setStyle(Style.FILL);

    for (MapChanges change : ExternalClass.getMapChanges()) {
        // Build Rect at point of Touch
        // Select Color for Paint   
        canvas.drawRect(Rect, Paint);
        ExternalClass.removeMapChange(change); //Thread safe
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works flawlessly except for the fact that it is forgetting changes from any previous <code>onDraw()</code> call. I am currently testing this by using an <code>OnTouchListener</code>.</p>

<p>Code procedure as I understand it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Touch adds a change request for the UI to the list in the <code>ExternalClass</code>.</li>
<li><code>DrawingThread</code> sees the list is no longer empty, safely grabs the Canvas, and <code>postInvalidates()</code> to call custom <code>SurfaceView</code>'s <code>onDraw()</code>.</li>
<li><code>onDraw()</code> updates the UI and removes the change request from <code>ExternalClass</code>.</li>
<li><code>DrawingThread</code> posts the <code>Canvas</code> and goes back to waiting.</li>
</ul>

<p>My expected behavior is that I will accumulate dots on my screen with successive touches.  Instead, each touch clears the screen, leaving me with the background and exactly one dot where I last touched the screen.</p>

<p>I find this vastly confusing as <code>lockCanvas(Rect)</code> specifically mentions that it will save changes between locks by designating a ""dirty"" section. Google searches have lead me to believe that most users find the opposite problem: that they want the <code>View</code> redrawn but must do so every update manually.</p>

<p>Why is the program drawing a clean <code>SurfaceView</code> from scratch each UI update despite my designation of a ""dirty"" section to redraw?</p>

<p>No doubt someone will reference me to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2949036/android-how-to-get-a-custom-view-to-redraw-partially"">this previously answered question</a> where the programmer was advised to use bitmaps. I am trying to avoid this due to how new I am to this and my desire to not work with large amounts of memory (updating the UI is a tiny portion of my code). Working with simple shapes directly on a <code>View</code> would be ideal for me. Additionally it is presented as a workaround. Is this a flaw in the Android API?</p>

<p>Have been searching here and Google for several hours now. Hope I have not missed anything blatantly obvious.</p>

I'm having difficulty delimiting the string with a double quote. For my string I have:</p>

<p>The problem with this is that rather than accept a string like ""hello"", it accepts \""hello\"".
I'm trying to escape the "" character by using \"" but it's just interpreting it literally as \"". I've looked online and every example I've seen delimits a quote using ""\"""" the same I have and I can't find any other way to escape the character. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to get the parser to accept a string delimited by double quotes.</p>

<p>EDIT: I added JAVA_UNICODE_ESCAPE = true; to the start of my grammar file and it did absolutely nothing. The ONLY string the parser will accept is \""\"". If I try to put anything in between those symbols like \""hi\"" then I get an exception and something like ""hi"" just isn't accepted by the parser.</p>

<li><p>If I add a contact to a google contacts group using the user interface and then get their contact using <code>self.gd_client.GetContact</code>, looking at their gData there is no    <code>&lt;gContact:groupMembershipInfo&gt;</code> tag.</p></li>

More specifically, when using those keys one may go over several states before settling on the one they need, especially if they type too fast and skip a desired state. Unfortunately, Org-mode will happily log <em>every single one</em> of those state changes, despite the fact that they happened within a few seconds and cannot correspond to what happened with an actual real-life task.</p>

<p>Is there a way to have Org-mode filter the generated log entries, so that those intermediate state changes are not inadvertently logged? E.g. a setting that would <em>merge</em> state changes when they happen in less than X seconds?</p>

But I haven't managed to find how to get an specific value of an attribute inside a Script using Java. The goal is read a file (script) line by line, and extract the value of an attribute ""src"". </p>

<p>For instance, the file has many lines containing this structure:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""js/vendor/modernizr-2.6.2.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script data-main=""js/"" src=""js/require.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script data-main=""js/"" src=""js/require.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>So, using Java I read the file this way using <code>BufferedReader</code> class, I want to get for each line the value of ""src"", for example, for the first line, I want to get: <code>js/vendor/modernizr-2.6.2.min.js</code>, for the second line, I want to get <code>js/require.min.js</code> and so on, I saw some suggestions like using regex, but I don't know if it is the most effective in this cases:</p>

<pre><code>public Helper(String scriptPath) {
        File scriptFile = null;
        try {
            scriptFile = new File(scriptPath);
            String relativePath = scriptFile.getParent();
            System.out.println(relativePath);
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(scriptFile));
            String readLine;

            while ((readLine = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                // How to match the src?
            }

            reader.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {

<p>When I use com.android.support:design:22.2.0 everything works fine, that is, scrolling vertically in Recyclerview1, Recyclerview2 or Recyclerview3 makes the toolbar scroll automatically. </p>

<p>So the fact that Recyclerview2 and Recyclerview3 are nested in tab2 and not direct siblings of tab2 does not affect the toolbar scrolling behaviour. Exactly what I need.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the new release of the library, com.android.support:design:22.2.1 , breaks this behaviour.
In the 22.2.1 release, only Recyclerview1 makes the toolbar scroll. Nested Recyclerview2 and Recyclerview3 do not any more.</p>

<p>What is this lib supposed to do exactly in this case ? Is it a new bug in 22.2.1 or a 22.2.0 bug fixed in 22.2.1 ?</p>

<p>The outer while loop will terminate independently from where _array points to. My question is about the <code>if (_array)</code> condition and the incrementation within that clause.</p>

<p>I first thought that it should check if the pointer ""ran out of"" the array, but  that does not seem to be case. I tested it with this simple snippet:</p>

<pre><code>float *p = new float[5];
int i = 0;
for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    if (p) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""ok\n"";
    } else {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""no\n"";
    }
    p += 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will print 10 times ""ok"". So <code>if (pointer)</code> evaluates to <code>true</code> even if the pointer exceeded the defined array length.</p>

"25393392","1","25552757","","2014-08-19 21:36:33","","1","199","<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>

<p>I'm looking for a way to decrease the 40-50 second wait every time our SASS needs to compile into main.css. I've already gotten it down from over a minute by switching from using Compass for compiling to using grunt-contrib-sass. I need to get it down to 5-10 seconds, or as close to that as possible.</p>

<h3>CAN'T USE LIBSASS</h3>

<p>I'm a little bit stuck using SASS 3.3 and Compass unless we absolutely have to switch for the performance. We do use bootstrap-sass so it would be hard to get rid of Compass entirely. This means we can't easily switch to libsass. But any code in Compass can also be copied from their repository directly into our _mixins partial so anything is possible with enough effort.</p>

<h3>USER THEMES</h3>

<p>The worst thing for our speed by far is that we have different usergroups, each with their own set of variables used to compile the SASS with a custom theme. So our SASS needs to compile once for the main theme, main.css, and then once more for each usergroup in the system to make their theme.css. As we add users the compile time that results when any of our main partials are changed increases linearly. Any suggestions to speed this up are also welcome.</p>

<h3>REPLACE @IMPORT WITH REQUIRE?</h3>

<p>I read on the TreeHouse blog that @import slows things down a lot when using the stock Ruby SASS compiler. We do have a lot of partials, and the user themes as well, and we have bootstrap-sass rigged to compile using our variables instead of bootstrap's default ones. So there are a lot of @import statements. TreeHouse used Sprockets in their Rails project, replacing @import with //=require, to speed up their ~1min SASS compilation to something like 3 seconds. Django has a port of Sprockets called django-gears, could implementing that have the same effect on our SASS? Can we use django-gears together with grunt? There doesn't seem to be much mention of using the technologies together in the Google-sphere.
(edit: found the article I was talking about, updated this section. <a href=""http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/tale-front-end-sanity-beware-sass-import"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/tale-front-end-sanity-beware-sass-import</a>)</p>

<p>Edit 2: No, Grunt and django-gears don't really work together. I don't think we need to use Gears to achieve this effect though. I'm going to  try using some sort of Grunt file concatenation plugin to replace the Sass @import statements, I'll report back here about what it does to our compilation time.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Anyway, that's all the research I've done so far, pretty much. We could rewrite our SASS to work with libsass, which would be tough and take a decent amount of time. We can implement django-gears to possibly-maybe speed things up using require. Or, not mentioned yet, we can replace Grunt with Gulp. Gulp seems to have a slightly faster version of grunt-contrib-sass but might cause trouble if we need a plugin later down the line that doesn't exist for Gulp (since Gulp is smaller/not as well-supported as Grunt).</p>

<p>Is there anything that I've missed so far in my research? Any further suggestions? I'm not terribly experienced so any sage advice Stackoverflow has to offer would be greatly appreciated. :)</p>

This API is to be written in Node.JS/Express/MongoDB/Mongoose with a Backbone Marionette/Backbone-Relational frontend.</p>

<p>I do not need to ever deal with the typical <code>_id</code> directly, as I aim for my endpoints to be something like <code>/api/articles/some-article-title</code>.</p>

<p>I was originally thinking actually using both <code>_ids</code> and <code>slugs</code> with something like this, getting it to dynamically return an new <code>id</code> field.</p>

<pre><code>// Inside my controller

var slugQuery = function(slug){
    var query = {$or: [{slug: slug}]};
    if (slug.match(/^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$/)) {
        query.$or.push({_id: slug});
    }
    return query;
}

exports.getProfile = function (req, res) {
    var slug = req.params.slug;

    Profile.findOne( slugQuery(slug), function(err, profile){
        if(err){
            // DB Error
            res.status(400);
            res.end();
        }else if(!profile){
            res.status(404);
            res.end();
        }else{
            res.json( profile.withId() );
        }
    });
};


// Method added to the model

ProfileSchema.methods.withId = function() {
    var json = this.toObject();

    // Use the slug or id
    json.id = json.slug || json._id;

    return json;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This seems hacky to me, especially as there are quite a few endpoints/models that would need to function like this. It gets even more complex when I'm wanting to do fairly deep document linking utilising Mongooses <code>populate</code> functionality.</p>

<p>I know theoretically you 'can' literally do away with the <code>ObjectID</code> and store the <code>slug</code> directly inside the _id field, but you cannot update the <code>_id</code> field once its been inserted, and also you would need to update all related links to the document if it did indeed change.</p>

<p>To me, this seems like quite a common need, an REST compliant endpoint with <code>slug</code> based identifiers.</p>

<p>Has anybody had to build something like this before? Any best practices on this?</p>

<p>Please help! If you need any more information, please let me know. Also, I'm not sure which context.xml ought to be modified, there are 2 in the Tomcat directories, one in the /conf folder, and one in the webapps/appname/META-INF folder. Sorry if it sounds like I'm a bit of a rookie, that's because I am!</p>

<p>Also, I've seen many different examples of the url=""..."" part of the context.xml, some including port numbers. I have tried several things out online, but nothing seems to work (doesn't help nothing online is my exact data environment, also I suppose it's challenging that this app queries two different DBs at given times).</p>

<pre><code>CancellationTokenSource cts0 = new CancellationTokenSource(), cts1 = new CancellationTokenSource();
try

    var task = Task.Run(() =&gt; { throw new OperationCanceledException(""123"", cts0.Token); }, cts1.Token);
    task.Wait();

</code></pre>

<p>Due to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997396%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"">MSDN</a> task should be in <code>Faulted</code> state because it's token does not match exception's token (and also <code>IsCancellationRequested</code> is <code>false</code>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the token's IsCancellationRequested property returns false or if the exception's token does not match the Task's token, the OperationCanceledException is treated like a normal exception, causing the Task to transition to the Faulted state. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I launch this code in console app using .NET 4.5.2 I get task in <code>Canceled</code> state (aggregate exception contains unknown <code>TaskCanceledExeption</code>, not the original). And all information of original exception is lost (message, inner exception, custom data).</p>

<p>I also noticed that behavior of <code>Task.Wait</code> differs from <code>await task</code> in case of <code>OperationCanceledException</code>.</p>

<pre><code>try { Task.Run(() =&gt; { throw new InvalidOperationException(""123""); }).Wait(); } // 1
catch (AggregateException ae) { Console.WriteLine(ae.InnerException); }

try { await Task.Run(() =&gt; { throw new InvalidOperationException(""123""); }); } // 2
catch (InvalidOperationException ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex); }

try { Task.Run(() =&gt; { throw new OperationCanceledException(""123""); }).Wait(); } // 3 
catch (AggregateException ae) { Console.WriteLine(ae.InnerException); }

try { await Task.Run(() =&gt; { throw new OperationCanceledException(""123""); }); } // 4
catch (OperationCanceledException ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex); }
</code></pre>

<p>Cases <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> produce almost identical result (differ only in <code>StackTrace</code>), but when I change exception to <code>OperationCanceledException</code>, then I get very different results: an unknown <code>TaskCanceledException</code> in case <code>3</code> without original data, and expected <code>OpeartionCanceledException</code> in case <code>4</code> with all original data (message, etc.).</p>

<p>So the question is: Does MSDN contain incorrect information? Or is it a bug in .NET? Or maybe it's just I don't understand something?</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/challenger/m4BZt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/challenger/m4BZt/</a></p>

<p>I have such a template (I'm using <code>Backbone</code> library):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""four columns productView""&gt;
    &lt;dl class=""tabs""&gt;
        &lt;dd class=""active""&gt;&lt;a href=""#&lt;%= Id %&gt;-tab1""&gt;Purchase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

    &lt;ul class=""tabs-content""&gt;
        &lt;li class=""active"" id=""&lt;%= Id %&gt;-tab1""&gt;
            &lt;img src=""http://placehold.it/400x300&amp;amp;text=[img]""&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;%= Title %&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;a href=""#"" class=""blue small nice button radius""&gt;Add to Cart »&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= Description %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;a href=""#"" class=""blue small nice button radius""&gt;Add to Cart »&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this breaks. Somehow It <code>doesn't show me second tab content</code> despite it <code>changes tab visually</code> and adds hash sign and model <code>Id with -tab[1|2] postfix</code> to the <code>url bar</code>.</p>

<p>Maybe I missed something? How do I do that?
Thanks!</p>

Same with DirectShow but then Microsoft says its extinct tech don't use it.
the client should be able to work on WinXP and onwards targets.

<p>now, I want to consider ""if the user click open or new again, after he click either before.""</p>

<p>so for the window classes, I could call the <code>self.viewwindow.Destroy()</code> to destry the windows. what about the data model object? If I first call new: <code>self.data=DataModel()</code>, then call open and re-assign <code>self.data=DataModel.from_file(...)</code>, what about the old instance? Do I need destruct it myself or python will manage this destruction?     </p>

<ul>
<li>i'd like to add a few images next to each other in one div. they need to have no spacing in between</li>
<li>the div has a percentage width set so as it reaches some point i'd like those images to start to get smaller. What happens now is the images simply fall down vertically when the div can't contain them any longer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The trick to get the images to scale down is by adding img { max-width: 100%; } in the css file, but that wouldn't work in this case. I'd like to ask if anyone knows an easy solution for this problem? I could try to set max-width for each image to a different number depending on their widths but i'm affraid the calculations will be off in some browsers (we all know how some browsers treat percentages with decimal places).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Non-working example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""width:40%""&gt;&lt;img src=""img1.jpg"" /&gt;&lt;img src=""img2.jpg"" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
CSS: img { max-width: 100%; }

<p>Comments: This is perfect for a single image so i'm looking for something as simple for multiple images.</p>

<p>I've spent hours trying to figure this out, but nothing works! I'm positive everything is linked correctly. My only other option may be to delete the entire storyboard file and start from scratch because it might be corrupted somehow.</p>

But I have already benefitted greatly from answers to many other questions on the site, so before I go further I would like to <strong>thank the community</strong> that contributes to the site.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>I am using R, with RStudio, and packages <code>devtools</code> and <code>roxygen2</code> on a Windows 7 machine (full <code>session_info</code> at the end of the question)</p>

<p>I am trying to write a package of my own, which defines subclasses of the S4 class <code>SpatialLines</code> from the package <code>sp</code>, and also uses the package <code>rgeos</code>.  My problem relates to warning messages that I do not really understand, and cannot fully resolve, when I used devtools to <code>document</code> and 
<code>load_all</code> my package.</p>

<h2>Warning messages</h2>

<p>The first message is</p>

<pre><code>class ""Spatial"" is defined (with package slot ‘sp’) but no metadata object found to revise subclass information---not exported?  Making a copy in package ‘minweSpatialNULL’ 
</code></pre>

<p>When I resolve this, by adding an entry in the NAMESPACE file (without fully understanding why it is necessary), and then make one further change to the DESCRIPTION file I get a second message which has me beaten, thus far.</p>

<pre><code>d&gt; devtools::document()
Updating minweSpatialNULL documentation
Loading minweSpatialNULL
Error: class ""SpatialLinesNULL"" is not exported by 'namespace:rgeos'
</code></pre>

<h2>What I have tried, and the questions I am left with</h2>

<p>I have googled and searched several sites looking for hints, but the closest I found was a brief thread from Dec 2011 asking where SpatialLinesNULL came from --- to which 
the answer was <code>rgeos</code>.
<a href=""http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/rspatial-devel/2011-December/000033.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/rspatial-devel/2011-December/000033.html</a></p>

<p>I have tried experimenting to understand what is wrong myself, and stepped
through code in the debugger till I got lost, way deeper than I could follow
well enough to figure out what was supposed to be happening.  In the process
have produced a small (not) working example of the issue, which is shown below.</p>

<p>I have 3 questions. They are summarised here, but really only make sense in the context of my (not) working toy example below :</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong> (after test1) Why does R need the (virtual?) superclass <code>Spatial</code> anyway, and why only when I have the <em>2nd generation</em> <code>MyClass2</code> defined in my code?<br>
<em>Clarification added</em> I had thought that the R packaging namespace mechanism would have taken care of any need to find and access antecedents /  superclasses once I had <code>@importClassesFrom</code>ed the class I actually use.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong> (after test3) I am presuming that whatever the reason is for my first warning message, is also the reason for this similar message.<br>
Am I on the right track?</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong> (after test4) Is the warning from test3 and this 
subsequent error something I can resolve myself (if so how)? 
or do I need to ask the maintainer of the <code>rgeos</code> package
for help (eg ask them to export <code>SpatialLinesNULL</code>)?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Code example</h1>

<p>The r code for my toy working example (stripped only of roxygen comments to save
space) is :</p>

<pre><code>MyClass1 &lt;- setClass('MyClass1', contains = c('SpatialLines'))
MyClass2 &lt;- setClass('MyClass2', contains = c('MyClass1'))
</code></pre>

<p>The MyClass2 2nd generation subclass seems to be significant (without it the warnings go away).  I do not understand why.</p>

<p>I have run a sequence of tests on this code, using <code>devtools</code> and 
<code>roxygen2</code>.  The tests vary by what is in the NAMESPACE file, and what is
in the Imports directive in the DESCRIPTION file.  Executing the test consists of running <code>devtools::load_all()</code> (or <code>devtools::document()</code> which calls <code>load_all()</code> along the way) in RStudio.  The warning messages which occur have been posted above. I restart my R session in a clean global environment between each test (the warnings only occur the first time I run <code>load_all</code> or <code>document</code>).</p>

<p><strong>While following up an answer given below I have realised I should also have tried to build and install my toy package using R from a shell command line.</strong></p>

<h2>test1</h2>

<p>test1 has DESCRIPTION file entry (see the end of this question for the complete DESCRIPTION file):</p>

<pre><code>Imports:
    methods,
    sp
</code></pre>

<p>and the complete NAMESPACE file (generated from roxygen comments omitted above) is :  </p>

<pre><code># Generated by roxygen2 (4.1.0.9001): do not edit by hand

importClassesFrom(sp,SpatialLines)
importFrom(sp,SpatialLines)
</code></pre>

<p>Trying to run <code>devtools::load_all()</code> (or <code>devtools::document()</code>) in a 
restarted R session generates the first warning (shown above).</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong> Why does R need the ~~(virtual?)~~ superclass <code>Spatial</code> anyway, and why only when I have the 2nd generation <code>MyClass2</code> defined in my code?   <em>Clarification added</em> I had thought that the R packaging namespace mechanism would have taken care of any need to find and access antecedents /  superclasses once I had <code>@importClassesFrom</code>ed the class I actually use.</p>

<h2>test2</h2>

<p>test2 <em>resolves</em> the problem by updating the NAMESPACE file as indicated by
the warning message. No other changes were made.</p>

<p>The warning goes away when the complete NAMESPACE file is :</p>

<pre><code># Generated by roxygen2 (4.1.0.9001): do not edit by hand

importClassesFrom(sp,Spatial)
importClassesFrom(sp,SpatialLines)
importFrom(sp,SpatialLines)
</code></pre>

<h2>test3</h2>

<p>An apparently similar problem recurs though, when I made one small change to 
the Imports directive in the DESCRIPTION file, namely add in <code>rgeos</code>.  This is the only change made to create the test3 scenario from test2.</p>

<pre><code>Imports:
    methods,
    sp,
    rgeos
</code></pre>

<p>Now I get a warning that looks like the problem from test1, viz :</p>

<pre><code>class ""SpatialLinesNULL"" is defined (with package slot ‘rgeos’) but no metadata object found to revise subclass information---not exported?  Making a copy in package ‘minweSpatialNULL
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I have been able to figure out, <code>SpatialLinesNULL</code> is a new
superclass of <code>Spatial</code>, defined in <code>rgeos</code> so it can provide some
generic functions and methods.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong> I am presuming that whatever the reason is for my first warning message, is also the reason for this similar message.<br>
Am I on the right track?</p>

<h2>test4</h2>

<p>In test4 I try to apply the same solution as <em>worked</em> in test2, namely add the <em>missing</em> entry to the NAMESPACE file.  This is the complete NAMESPACE file for test4.</p>

<pre><code># Generated by roxygen2 (4.1.0.9001): do not edit by hand

importClassesFrom(rgeos,SpatialLinesNULL)
importClassesFrom(sp,Spatial)
importClassesFrom(sp,SpatialLines)
importFrom(sp,SpatialLines)
</code></pre>

<p>at which stage I get my final error message :</p>

<pre><code>d&gt; devtools::document()
Updating minweSpatialNULL documentation
Loading minweSpatialNULL
Error: class ""SpatialLinesNULL"" is not exported by 'namespace:rgeos
</code></pre>

<p>At this stage I am stuck.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong> Is the warning from test3 and this 
subsequent error something I can resolve myself (if so how)? 
or do I need to ask the maintainer of the <code>rgeos</code> package
for help (eg ask them to export <code>SpatialLinesNULL</code>)?</p>

    <strong>SAXParseException: No Content allowed in Prolog.</strong>
I am aware that the issue is probably related to the xml files but all the related xmls are read and validated correctly. The spring files are parsed correctly and beans are created but the entitymanager creation fails and the root exception is this content not allowed in prolog error. I am not sure which are the relevant sections to post here. If required I can post the full contents of the files. I have further isolated that this problem comes up after I am adding a class tag entry to persistence.xml. Can anyone please help me on this? I am posting the fuul stacktrace:</p>

<p>When I simply passed the boost::regex(""MIME-Version:\s*1.0\s*\r\n"", boost::regex::icase) into the async_read_until (third overload) there was no problems, but I wanted to customize the match condition of the async_read_until (fourth overload) and I ran into problems when I made the match condition an member function.  I need match_version to be a member function since there is no way to signal the handler why its returning (size or match found).  So I know the problem is with the boost::bind(&amp;TcpMimeConnection::match_version, shared_from_this(), _1, _2),
line of code but I don't know how to fix it.</p>

(FRSt8ios_baseS0_E) ff
</code></pre>

<p>I presume clang and gcc are correct, because they have better reputations than bcc32. </p>

<p>If I enable the commented-out function, then bcc32 outputs:</p>

<pre><code>ff
.ff
(std::ios_base &amp; (*)(std::ios_base &amp;)) ff
</code></pre>

<p>What exactly is going wrong with the first version? It's presumably a compiler bug to do with overload resolution, but I can't figure out what bcc32 is doing, or what the <code>const</code> is on the end of the <code>typeid</code> output.</p>

<p>I am using ICEFaces 1.8 components in a Java EE web application. My goal is to render a bunch of ice:commandButtons on the page based on a query to my database. I want these buttons to be able to toggle selections that I will later use for parameters to another query to the database (basically a query front end of sorts for a set of users). I would like the output to look like so:</p>

<p><img src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/%5Fn%5FtMTNWlgdQ/SniHmmjWalI/AAAAAAAAAA4/xQDtx0y4P-Y/s320/deselected.PNG"" alt=""Deselected"" /></p>

<p>When I click on a button, I would like the following update to my page:</p>

<p><img src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/%5Fn%5FtMTNWlgdQ/SniHmRVhK2I/AAAAAAAAAAw/SSoOLEugUjc/s320/selected.PNG"" alt=""Selected"" /></p>

<p>When I created the buttons on my page statically, as such:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ice:commandButton id=""seasonSEP09"" style=""background-color: #FFFFFF;"" partialSubmit=""true"" actionListener=""#{bean.updateSeasons}"" value=""2009-2010"" /&gt;
&lt;ice:commandButton id=""seasonSEP08"" style=""background-color: #FFFFFF;"" partialSubmit=""true"" actionListener=""#{bean.updateSeasons}"" value=""2008-2009"" /&gt;
&lt;ice:commandButton id=""seasonSEP07"" style=""background-color: #FFFFFF;"" partialSubmit=""true"" actionListener=""#{bean.updateSeasons}"" value=""2007-2008"" /&gt;
&lt;ice:commandButton id=""seasonSEP06"" style=""background-color: #FFFFFF;"" partialSubmit=""true"" actionListener=""#{bean.updateSeasons}"" value=""2006-2007"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this works great, and each button works individually as I would expect. My backing bean is updated, the parameters are correctly added in updateSeasons() method, and my output at the end yields the correct records.</p>

<p>However, I know this is not what I want. I don't want to update these anytime another season is entered in the system. Maintainance nightmare, right?</p>

<p>So what I want to do is dynamically generate these ice:commandButton components based on my database table full of Season objects. Here is the Season class I am using:</p>

<pre><code>public class Season
{
    String StartMonth;
    String Season;

    public String getStartMonth()
    {
        return StartMonth;
    }
    public void setStartMonth(String startMonth)
    {
        StartMonth = sweep;
    }    
    public void setSeason(String season)
    {
        Season = season;
    }
    public String getSeason()
    {
        return Season;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Very straightforward. Two properties, which I'm guaranteed to be unique in the database. </p>

<p>Here is the backing bean I am using:</p>

<pre><code>public class Bean
{
    public Bean()
    {
        defineSeasonsList();
    }

    public List&lt;HtmlCommandButton&gt; seasonsList;

    // seasonsList getter &amp; setter omitted

    public List&lt;String&gt; selectedSeasons;

    // selectedSeasons getter &amp; setter omitted

    private void defineSeasonsList()
    {
        seasonsList = new ArrayList&lt;HtmlCommandButton&gt;();
        selectedSeasons = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        try
        {
            hibernate.openTransaction();

            for(Season season:defineSeasonsListFromDataSource()))
            {
                HtmlCommandButton button = new HtmlCommandButton();

                button.setId(""season"" + season.getStartMonth());
                button.setValue(season.getSeason);
                button.setStyle(""background-color: #FFFFFF;"");
                button.setPartialSubmit(true);

                seasonsList.add(button);
            }                         
        } 
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println(""Error defining seasons list: "" + e.getMessage());
        }
        finally
        {
            hibernate.commitTransaction();
        }               
    }

    public void updateSeasons(ActionEvent ae)
    {
        HtmlCommandButton selected = (HtmlCommandButton) ae.getComponent();

        if(selectedSeasons.contains(selected.getValue().toString()))
        {
            selectedSeasons.remove(selected.getValue().toString());   
            selected.setStyle(""background: #FFFFFF;"");
        }
        else
        {
            selectedSeasons.add(selected.getValue().toString());
            selected.setStyle(""background: #009DD9; color: #FFFFFF;"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>OK, so here comes my dilemma(s).</p>

<p>First, I tried to render this markup: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;ice:panelGroup&gt;
        &lt;ice:panelSeries id=""seasonsList"" value=""#{bean.seasonsList}"" var=""season""&gt;
                &lt;ice:commandButton binding=""#{season}""/&gt;                                        
        &lt;/ice:panelSeries&gt;
    &lt;/ice:panelGroup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I get this output:</p>

<p><img src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/%5Fn%5FtMTNWlgdQ/SniLF7r4QbI/AAAAAAAAABA/pS7hhW-kB-I/s320/badButtons.PNG"" alt=""Bad Buttons"" /></p>

<p>So, being frustrated and adventurous, I tried to render this markup to achieve my goal:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;ice:panelGroup&gt;
        &lt;ice:panelSeries id=""seasonsList"" value=""#{bean.seasonsList}"" var=""season""&gt;
                &lt;ice:commandButton id=""#{season.id}"" partialSubmit=""true"" style=""background-color: #FFFFFF"" value=""#{season.value}"" actionListener=""#{bean.updateSeasons}""/&gt;                                        
        &lt;/ice:panelSeries&gt;
    &lt;/ice:panelGroup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which yielded the following stacktrace:</p>

<p>Am I trying to do something that I shouldn't be doing?</p>

<p>Is there a better way to accomplish this goal?</p>

<p>If more information is necessary I'd be happy to provide it.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance, my friends.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p>So I tried changing the seasonsList collection from List to List and rendering some different markup, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;ice:panelGroup&gt;
        &lt;ice:panelSeries value=""#{bean.seasonsList}"" var=""season""&gt;
                &lt;ice:commandButton partialSubmit=""true"" style=""background-color: #FFFFFF"" value=""#{season}"" actionListener=""#{Phase1EventBean.updateSeasons}""/&gt;                                        
        &lt;/ice:panelSeries&gt;
    &lt;/ice:panelGroup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And changing the defineSeasonsList() method to:</p>

<pre><code>public void defineNationalSeasonsList()
{
    try
    {
        seasonsList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
        selectedSeasonsList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        hibernate.openTransaction();

        for(UedaNationalDates season:hibernate.getList(new UedaNationalDates(), QueryFactory.getUedaNationalSeasons(hibernate.getHibSession())))
        { 
            nationalSeasonsList.add(season.getSeason());
        }       
    } 
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        System.out.println(""Error defining nationalMeasurementPeriods: "" + e.getMessage());
    }
    finally
    {
        hibernate.commitTransaction();
    }               
}
</code></pre>

<p>This actually renders all the buttons I would like to see, and adds them correctly to the selectedSeasonsList in my backing bean when I click on them, and removes them from it when I click again.</p>

<p>However, on the UI, <strong>every</strong> button appears to be toggled when I click just the one button. For example, when I click on 2009-2010, this is what I see:</p>

<p>In previously, I shut down transaction when update from svn, cause some file was so big,</p>

<p>so I was shut down downloading for delete big files first, but after that, I got message </p>

<p>about 'txn-current', </p>

<p>does anybody can help me to solve this? </p>

<p>thank you for regarding this</p>

<p>Because I have enabled TransactionMiddleware in the main settings, I wanted (and was expecting) the failure of the request to roll back any database update that I had made as a result of this request.</p>

<p>My code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def submit(request):
    form1 = Form1(request.POST)
    form2 = Form2(request.POST)

    obj1 = form1.save()

    # simulate an error
    raise Exception('spam', 'eggs')

    obj2 = form2.save(commit=False)
    obj2.obj1 = obj1
    form2.save()

<p>When I subsequently query the database, obj1 is present.  How do I get it to rollback the obj1 transaction as a result of the failure?</p>

<p>(I've also tried putting the decorator @transaction.commit_on_success, but obj1 is still stored in the database).</p>

<p>The first problem i'm having is when validated as required, only the ""Yes"" label is highlighted.<br>
The second problem is if I don't resolve the validation issue and cancel out of the jQueryUI dialog, then come back into the dialog, the ""Yes"" label disappears completely.</p>

<p>To resolve the first issue, what i want to do is highlight both the ""Yes"" and ""No"" labels.  So, working on the highlight code, i would need to get the name of the input (""chooseMe"") from the element id, then from that name, for all the id's associated with that name (""radio_yes"" and ""radio_no""), highlight all the labels.  Of course, then there's the converse for the unhighlight code.</p>

<p>Since i have several radio button sets in the form, i need this to be generic (no hardcoding ""chooseMe"", etc.)</p>

<p>Does that sound reasonable?  If so, the only problem is i don't know how to do that :)</p>

<p>What type of algorithm should I look into researching about? I imagine this is some application of graph theory with each player being a node and each request being an edge..but thats about the extent of my graph knowledge.</p>

This seems a little repetitive.  Is there a way to assign them all into the global namespace and cut out the assignment step; or as is often the case when some python behavior seems counter-intuitive to me, can some wise, python expert point out that there a good reason I should not do this or want to do this?</p>

<p>What I have now is this:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument(""--db"",type=str, dest='db', nargs='?', default=""test"")
    parser.add_argument(""--collection"",type=str, dest='collection', nargs='?', help=""Collection, default is test"", default=""test"")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    db = args.db                   # gross! 
    collection = args.collection   # yuck!
    print(db)
    print(collection)

    parser.add_argument(""--collection"",type=str, dest='collection', nargs='?', help=""Collection, default is test"", default=""test"")
    parser.SUPER_parse_args() # now, db and collection are already in the namespace!
    print(db)
    print(collection)
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't seem like much when I only have 2 arguments, but if I have 10 or so, doubling the  assign steps, where I rename into the global namespace the attributes that already exist in the args object, starts to bug me.</p>

<p>Here, my id for drop down list in each row is different.It is generated automatically as the loop continues. All I need is that, when the user changes  a product's quantity corresponding price has to be changed. The thing is that, when the user changes the quantity, jquery has to be invoked.It should pass the select id. But my select id is different for each product. So how I achieve it? Please help me.</p>

The Rooms page has an edit NavItem button, which when pressed enables an add NavItem button. You can delete and add rooms from here. Added rooms simply appear with a default ""New Room"" name in the table. The second view is a list of Scenes in the selected room. Same deal here, you can delete and add Scenes, and added Scenes simply appear in the table with the name ""New Scene"". Nothing special really.</p>

<p>I'm using a <code>FetchedResultsController</code> in both view controllers, with the Scenes one having an <code>NSPredicate</code> to return only scenes from the selected room. I'm also using the <code>controllerWillChangeContent</code>, <code>controllerDidChangeContent</code> etc. delegate methods for the table view updates.</p>

<p>This all works fine at first, but usually after navigating around rooms and scenes then trying to delete a scene it will crash. It will inevitably crash if you play around with it long enough. It only happens when deleting a scene. If you press the edit button and delete a scene and it works, then all the following deletes in that edit session will always work. It will only ever crash on the first delete of the edit session.</p>

<p>The error I get is a strange one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Terminating app due to uncaught exception
  'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSCFType
  controllerWillChangeContent:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance
  0x5e02d70'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first part of this error sometimes changes. Sometimes it's <code>__NSCFType</code>, sometimes it's <code>CALayer</code>. This error only happens when deleting Scenes. Adding Scenes is fine 100%.</p>

<p>I've read another post on stackoverflow that suggests these sorts of errors can come from memory management issues. I've double checked the code, and also run it through Instruments with the leak instrument. There are no leaks.</p>

<p>Apparently the compiler is expecting a qualified name after typename but I don't see how there can be one for the template type.</p>

<p>I dont understand the difference between ElementType1 and ElementType2 in this context.</p>

<p>I looked at many questions on stack overflow but most seemed to refer to only the kind of declaration like iterator_type in my example.</p>

<p>This code builds the form and send the user to the custom submitted query link after entry, however, I would like the custom query to stick all pages they visit. In this code the query is only valid for the initial page after entry.
Need the query stay attached to child pages thereafter as well: IE: <a href=""http://example.com/blob/?id=44553355"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/blob/?id=44553355</a> as well as <a href=""http://example.com/blog/article/?id=44553355"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/blog/article/?id=44553355</a></p>

I have a class, called <code>CASM</code>, that has a <code>List&lt;Action&gt;</code>. I want to serialize this class (using the <code>BinaryFormatter</code> or something similar). This class and all classes referenced in the <code>Action</code>s have got correct <code>[Serializable]</code> and <code>[NonSerializable]</code> attributes.</p>

<p>The problem comes when serialization is attempted - it gives this error:</p>

<pre><code>Type 'CASM.CASM+&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass2c' in Assembly 'CASM, Version=1.0.0.0,
Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' is not marked as serializable.
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass2c</code> is an autogenerated internal class that holds the different types of anonymous delegate I am using in my application. However, as we can see from the below image, it is not <code>[Serializable]</code>:</p>

<p><img src=""http://bayimg.com/image/maebbaacj.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>What would be the best way to change my application so this does work? Make my own <code>&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass2c</code>-type class and make it serializable? Or is there a better way?</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b> In the end I just made my own class, instead of the autogenerated one. I helps with debugging as well, actually having a descriptive name rather than just <code>b__12()</code>.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/548225/anubhava"">anubhava</a>! <br/><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/8803309/1140748"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/8803309/1140748</a></p>

<p>[NEW PB]
Using <br/> <code>
    Matcher m = Pattern.compile(""(MOVE(?!.*?MOVE).*?\\s+TO\\s+[^\\.]*""+""dest5""+""(\\s+|\\.|$))"", Pattern.DOTALL).matcher(paragraphePart);</code> <br/>
I can get MOVE src5 TO dest5. But if I try using ""dest4"" to get this line ""MOVE src4 TO dest4"" it doesn't work anymore. Have you an idea?</p>

<pre><code>Matcher m = Pattern.compile(""(MOVE(?!.*?MOVE.*?""+fieldName+"").*?\\s+\\w+\\s+TO\\s+[^\\.]*""+fieldName+""(\\s+|\\.|$))"", Pattern.DOTALL).matcher(paragraphePart);

<li><code>'L'</code> - Long</li>
<li><code>'P'</code> - Pointer</li>
<li><code>'I'</code> - Integer</li>
<li><code>'V'</code> - Void</li>

<p>My problem is that I can't pass a null pointer when I perform an API call. E.g.: <code>['L', 'P', 'L'] -&gt; api.call(0, nil, 0) :: ArgumentError: Null pointer given</code>. My question is: Are there more parameter types that I don't know about and what should I do to pass a null pointer as a method parameter?</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I have been searching the internet for native Ruby programming examples of WinForms-based applications. I have considered the .NET addition to Ruby known as IronRuby for simplicity in coding (trying to avoid wxRuby, and also a .NET fan), but I first want to be able to code explicitly in pure Ruby first.</p>

<p>Now, I have successfully been able to implement most addresses I've tested in the user32.dll object such as:</p>

<pre><code>api = Win32API.new('user32', 'MessageBox', ['L', 'P', 'P', 'L'], 'I')
# or
api = Win32API.new('user32', 'MessageBeep', ['L'], 'I')
</code></pre>

<p>..but I cannot perform a <code>CreateWindow</code> Or <code>CreateWindowEx</code> without null parameters. 
If it would be of any help, I have found how to do this in Python <a href=""http://ginstrom.com/scribbles/2008/02/26/python-gui-programming-platforms-for-windows/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (under WinAPI).</p>

<p>Using Win32API: msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff381397(v=VS.85).aspx</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong><br>
Well, I think I may have just solved my own problem with this link
<em>(warning: may contain inappropriate content)</em>: <a href=""http://ginstrom.com/scribbles/2008/02/26/python-gui-programming-platforms-for-windows/"" rel=""nofollow"">[link]</a></p>

<p>I more used that forum as reference and did a bit of fiddling around my self:<br>
<code>createwindow = Win32API.new(""user32"",""CreateWindowEx"",'lpplllllllll','l')</code><br>
<code>showwindow   = Win32API.new('user32','ShowWindow',%w(l l),'l')</code></p>

<p><code>hWND = createwindow.call((0x00000100|0x00000200),""static"", ""Window Title"",((0x4000000|0x80000000|0)|0x02000000),0,0,600,400,0,0,0,0)</code><br>
<code>showwindow(hWND, 1)</code></p>

<p>The only thing that happens after the 'window' is displayed is crash... and that may have been because of some incorrect handling, but, I am happy that I got it to work(for a little bit)! Just need to figure out the rest...</p>

<p>This is my class that is used for inheritance on the shapes. Depending on the shape, one of the classes will be called.</p>

<hr>

<p>Drawing ovals works fine. Same goes for drawing lines. However, there is a bug when it comes to drawing rectangles. If I put my mouse and drag and let go from left up to bottom right, this will work. However, if I go another direction it is invisible on the form but the <code>shapes.Count()</code> still adds towards the list of <code>shapes</code>.</p>

<p>What caused this bug?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Write a program to tally the number of A's, B's, C's, D's and F's based upon a list of scores entered by a user.</p></li>
<li><p>After all the scores are entered, the program must display a
horizontal bar graph of the number tallied for each grade like that shown in the Operation section.</p></li>
<li><p>The tally graph must display a single '*' for each unit tallied.</p></li>
<li><p>When a user enters a -1, the program must display the final graph and
exit.</p></li>
<li><p>The output of your program must display prompts and a tally graph
like that shown in the Operation section above.</p></li>
<li><p>You may assume that a user will enter numbers only.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Operation:</p>

<p>The program starts and prompts you to either enter a test score or end
the program by entering a -1. Like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Number of A's: 0
Number of B's: 0
Number of C's: 0
Number of D's: 0
Number of F's: 0
Enter a score (%) or -1 to end: 90
</code></pre>

<p>As you enter each score, the application decides whether the score is
an A, B, C, D or F and adds one to the letter-grade tally. Like the
following:</p>

<pre><code>Number of A's: 1
Number of B's: 0
Number of C's: 0
Number of D's: 0
Number of F's: 0
Enter a score (%) or -1 to end: 95
</code></pre>

<p>Each time you enter a score, the program updates the tally. Like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Number of A's: 2
Number of B's: 0
Number of C's: 0
Number of D's: 0
Number of F's: 0
Enter a score (%) or -1 to end: -1
</code></pre>

<p>When you are done entering scores, the program displays a horizontal
bar graph of the tally for A's, B's, C's, D's and F's. Like the
following:</p>

<pre><code>A's: **
B's:
C's:
D's:
F's:
</code></pre>

<p>Specifications:</p>

<p>Numerical Grade                             Letter Grade </p>

<p>greater than or equal to 90                      A </p>

<p>less than 90 but greater than or equal to 80     B </p>

<p>less than 80 but greater than or equal to 70     C </p>

<p>less than 70 but greater than or equal to 60     D </p>

<p>less than 60                                     F </p>

<p>When the program ends, display the number of scores, average score, and best score.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Number of scores:  2</p>

<p>Average score: 92.5</p>

<p>Best score: 95.0</p>

<p>We have also been instructed to code in at least two methods : one that has a void and one that returns something.</p>

<p>So far I have only been able to tally up the scores entered, but I don't seem to be able to wrap my head around <em>recording all the inputs</em> and <em>calculating the average</em> and <em>picking out the best score</em></p>

<p>This is what I have so far :</p>

<p>Below is a small, self-contained, simple 40-line program that calculates partial sums of a bunch of numbers and routinely (but stochastically) crashes nodes on a distributed memory cluster that I'm using.  If I spawn 50 PBS jobs that run this code, between 0 and 4 of them will crash their nodes.  It will happen on a different repeat of the main loop each time and on different nodes each time, there is no discernible pattern.  The nodes just go ""down"" on the ganglia report and I can't ssh to them (""no route to host"").  If instead of submitting jobs I ssh onto one of the nodes and run my program there, if I'm unlucky and it crashes then I just stop seeing text and then see that that node is dead on ganglia.</p>

<p>The program is threaded with openmp and the crashes only happen when a large number of threads are spawned (like 12).  </p>

<p>The cluster it's killing is a RHEL 5 cluster with nodes that have 2 6-core x5650 processors:</p>

<p>Some Notes:<br>
 1. On osx lion with gcc 4.7, this code will throw a SIGABRT, similar to this question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9351501/why-is-this-code-giving-sigabrt-with-openmp"">Why is this code giving SIGABRT with openMP?</a>.  Using gcc 4.8 seems to fix the issue on OSX.  However, using gcc 4.8 on the RHEL5 machine does not fix it.  The RHEL5 machine has GLIBC version 2.5, and it seems that yum doesn't provide a later one, so the admins are sticking with 2.5.<br>
 2. If I define a SIGABRT signal handler, it doesn't catch the problem on the RHEL5 machine, but it does catch it on OSX with gcc47.<br>
 3. I believe that no variables should need to be shared in the omp clause because they can all have private copies, but adding them as shared does not change the behavior.<br>
 4. The killing of nodes occurs regardless of the level of optimization used.<br>
 5. The killing of nodes occurs even if I run the program from within gdb (i.e. put ""gdb -batch -x gdbCommands Killer"" in the pbs file) where ""gdbCommands"" is a file with one line: ""run""<br>
 6. This example spawns threads on every repeat.  One strategy would be to make a parallel block that contains the repeats loop in order to prevent this.  However, that does not help me - this example is only representative of a much larger research code in which I cannot use that strategy.   </p>

<p>I'm all out of ideas, at my last straw, at my wit's end, ready to pull my hair out, etc with this.  Does anyone have suggestions or ideas?</p>

<pre><code>(([^\|])*\|)*([^\|]*)
</code></pre>

<p>This matches <strong>repetitive string patterns</strong> of the type</p>

<pre><code>(""whatever except |"" |) {0 to any times} (""whatever except |"" |) {1 time}
</code></pre>

<p>So it should match the following String, which has 17 substrings (16 repeated, plus ""  z"" as the last one).</p>

<pre><code>""abcd  | e | fg | hijk | lmnop | |   | qrs |   t| uv| w |||||x   y|  z""
</code></pre>

<p>Indeed, <a href=""http://regexpal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">RegexPal</a> verifies that the given regex does match the above string.</p>

<p>Now, I want to get each of the substrings (i.e., ""abcd  |"", ""e |"", ""fg |"", etc.), for which there is no prior knowledge about their number, length etc.</p>

<p>According to a similarly-titled <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6340364/java-repetitive-pattern-matching"">previous StackOverflow post</a> and the documentation of the <code>Matcher</code> class <code>find()</code> method, I just need to do something like</p>

<pre><code>Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex); // regex is the above regex
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input); // input is the above string

while (matcher.find())
{
   System.out.println(matcher.group(1));
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I do this I just get 2 strings printed out: the last repeated substring (""x   y|"") and a null value; definitely not the 16 substrings I expect.</p>

<p>A nice thing would also be to <strong>check that a match has actually happened</strong>, before running the <code>find()</code> loop, but I am not sure whether <code>matches()</code>, <code>groupCount() &gt; 0</code>, or some other condition should be used, without doing twice the matching work, given that <code>find()</code> also does matching.</p>

<p>So, <strong>questions</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I get all the 16 repeated substrings?</li>
<li>How can I get the last substring?</li>
<li>How do I check that the string matched?</li>
</ol>

Know this isn't something Javascript supports natively so wondered if there would be any complications around conversion to Javascript? As I believe not everything (such as the reflection/mirrors library) can translate.</p>

<p>In the case of an infix operator, I'm assuming it will just attached the function to the first variable and have the second variable passed as the function argument? I.e. instead of object + object, it will be object.plus(object)?</p>

<pre><code>Files Owner
First Responder
My App App Delegate
Window

    +TabBar
    +Nav Controller Subclass (a custom class)
        +Navigation Bar
        +Table View Contoller Subclass (custom class)
        +Tab Bar Item
    +Second View Controller (not yet hooked up)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to display a xib file when an item is clicked in the TableView. This xib file has a TabBarController as it's main view, but when the view displays, the tab bar and navigation bar are both invisible. The code I'm using to display it is:</p>

<pre><code>MyAppAppDelegate *delegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
[delegate.customNavController presentModalViewController:customDetailEditViewController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>If I use the code below to push the view controller onto the stack, I see the correct navigation bar, but the TabBar from the root view controller is shown instead of the one from the view which has been pushed.</p>

<pre><code>[delegate.customNavController pushViewController:customDetailEditViewController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>I even tried removing the TabBarController and manually implementing my own TabBar delegates but the same effect occurs (either no NavigationBar or TabBar, or the NavigationBar/TabBar from the root ViewController).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've uploaded the source to <a href=""http://mi6.nu/tabcontroller.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mi6.nu/tabcontroller.zip</a> . I'd really appreciate it if someone with a bt more experience with iOS could take a look.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>: The closest I've come so far is presenting a modal view controller inside the first tabbar, so my view looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>NavigationBar  
[          ]
[          ] 
[---View---]
[          ] 
[          ] 
TabBar from the pushed view 
TabBar from the root view
</code></pre>

<p>To achieve this, I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>UITabBarController *tabBarController = [[UITabBarController alloc] init];

    UIViewController *directionsView = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
    txtDirections = [[UITextView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height)]; 
    [directionsView.view addSubview:txtDirections];

    IconPickerViewController *iconPicker = [[IconPickerViewController alloc]init];
    tabBarController.viewControllers = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:recipeDetailEditViewController,directionsView,iconPicker, nil];
    [directionsView release];
    [iconPicker release];

    MyAppAppDelegate *delegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
    [delegate.rootNavController presentModalViewController:recipeDetailEditViewController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>This just complicates everything though, since a) It's not ideal as I have two tabbars and b) all controls (all of the editing controls) need to be in the TableViewController so their values can be loaded/saved to edit items. It would be much easier if the pushed view could handle loading/saving and appear on top of the root tabs.</p>

<p>Surely this must be possible?</p>

It is the same form I use on all mobile website and after not working for 5 hours I pulled the code straight from a working site I built and it still doesn't work properly. </p>

<p>The issue is when you go to the contact page it shows the contact form, but with the labels centered and the submit button image isn't showing up. I must refresh for it to bring up the correct CSS file to align the text left and show the submit button. Initially I thought it was from a CSS/JS conflict with my menu at the top so I pulled that and it still causes the same problem. I have cleared the cashe on my phone and web browsers and they all work the same. </p>

<p>Here is the link: www.lpokc.org/mobi/contact.php after going to this page hit refresh and you will see the difference. </p>

<p>My question is, is this a caching issue, is it server side issue, or is it a conflict in my coding. I'm not good with posting the code on this site but if you go to the mobile site from your web browser you can just right click and view source to see my code. I have a boiler plate html core file with boiler plate CSS and custom CSS.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of script I could use to make this page auto refresh one time on page load then not again after the reload? I don't want to use an improper fix like this but I have been working on this issue for a day.</p>

<p>The left side is before refresh. I have pulled the code from the site now but I think it was a js conflict because it was auto loading the css from the menu when the link for any page was clicked.</p>

<p>I'd like to make this a bit more friendly, by redirecting the user back to the correct page and displaying a pop-up javascript alert box telling them not to use the Back button.</p>

<p>I'm already using a function that does a lot of validity checking which returns None if the request is okay, or an HttpResponseRedirect to another page (generally the error page or login page) if the request is invalid.  All of my views have this code at the top:</p>

<pre><code>response = validate(request)
if response:
    return response
</code></pre>

<p>So, since I have this validate() function already, it seems like a good place to add this extra code for detecting out-of-order access.</p>

<p>However, since the out-of-order detection flag has to survive across a redirect, I can't just set a view variable; I have to set the flag in the session data.  But of course I don't want the flag to be set in the session data permanently; I want to remove the flag from the session data after processing the template.</p>

<p>I could add code like this to all of my render calls:</p>

<pre><code>back_button = request.session.get('back_button', False)
response = render(request, 'foo.html', { 'back_button': back_button } )
if back_button:
    del request.session['back_button']
return response
</code></pre>

<p>But this seems a bit messy.  Is there some way to automatically remove the session key after processing the template?  Perhaps a piece of middleware?</p>

<p>I'm using function-based views, not class-based, btw.</p>

<p>That's all fine and inside the control I can grab that data and display it.</p>

<p>When a user changes this preference, I manually save the Uri to a database:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean onPreferenceChange(Preference pref, Object change) {
    String ringtone = change.toString();

    // save it to a db
    ...

    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is, when the user closes and then gets back to the <code>PreferenceScreen</code>, the default Value of the <code>RingtonePreference</code> is always <code>Silence</code>. Of course, I have to set the value manually.</p>

<p>Tried this one in my <code>PreferenceActivity</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    addPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.settings); // the XML above

    String database_ringtone = ... // get the string saved above from db
                                   // and according to some parameters passed
                                   // to the intent

    Preference ringtone = findPreference(""alertringtone"");
    ringtone.setDefaultValue( database_ringtone );

    // also tried:
    ringtone.setDefaultValue( Uri.parse(database_ringtone) );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunatly the preference stays at ""Silence"" (which means empty). I thought, that when the <code>Preference</code> is not <code>persistent</code> the default value will be used.</p>

<p>I cannot make it <code>persistent</code>, because the preference is used for multiple items and the data I get from DB changes according to some extra data passed to the intent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do not want to set the default value, but the current value I get from database. Thought this might be a workaround. So any other way would be good, too.</p>

<p>Double-checked saving and retrieving from DB is working, so that's not the problem.</p>

<p>How can I set the <code>RingtonePreference</code> value from code?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Here's a little explanation what I want to do, maybe there's another way.</p>

<p>I've several menu entries (count varies from user to user), for which the user can select a ringtone for. Selecting the ringtone works with the xml above, the ID of the menu entry is passed with an <code>Intent</code> to the <code>PreferenceActivity</code>. The URI of the ringtone is then stored in the database.</p>

<p>When one of the entries changes, an alarm is played according to the ringtone-selection the user made. So he knows which one changed. No problem so far.</p>

<p>The problem is, when the user wants to change the ringtone for an entry he already defined one for. If the user selected ringtone Foo before, when clicking on the <code>RingtonePreference</code>, the ringtone Foo should be preselected already. This is no serious error (more like a glitch), but still very annoying.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, there is no way to preselect a default <code>RingtonePreference</code> from code? Or am I doing it ""just wrong""?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit 2: Okey, I think there isn't a way to do this. Very weird, the android core. Allows us to use a <code>Preference</code> and get values from it but not to put values back in. Must have been a real hurry. I'm glad they allowed us to check a <code>CheckBoxPreference</code> from code...</p>

<p>I've spent some time ""googling"" but didn't find relevant texts (tutorials) teaching how to manipulate images using R. The closest I found was a package called adimpro and its documentation. </p>

<p>Question is: What functions [packages] people use to manipulate pictures in R? Any tutorial [beside help/manual] of how to use them would be apreciated.</p>

B contains two classes ClassB1 and ClassB2. From ClassB1 I serialize an object of type ClassA, saving it in Folder1. Folder1 belongs to the solution, but not to projects A or B. If I try to deserialize the object from ClassB1 it works fine. Then from ClassB2 I desperately try to deserialize the serialized object. I get an access denied to Folder1 error message. </p>

<p>Any ideas  WHY this error occurs and how can I solve it ?</p>

<p>UPDATE. In project B, I just serialized an object of type ClassB1 from its constructor. I cannot deserialize this one either from ClassB2! All the serialized files are in Folder1 from the main project of the solution, project C. Whenever I deserialize from the same class that serialized an object, it works like a charm. But when trying to deserialize from a different class, it fails, on the same folder Folder1.</p>

AddComment does not have it's own view,  so instead of returning View(), we must return View(""Blog""). We can't use RedirectToAction(""Blog"") because we loose our ModelState errors. The problem is what if the Blog view is bound to a Blog model?!? Let's assume we have an Index() action whose job it is to retrieve the Blog's data and returns View(""Blog"",BlogModel). We would have to copy the contents of Index(), where the BlogModel is retrieved, to our AddComment() action. Else, returning View(""Blog"") from AddComment will give us a null exception when the Blog view is being parsed. Is this the only way to maintain ModelState errors between actions that use the same view? I just started learning MVC and I'm still learning the right way to layout my code so please enlighten me. </p>

What I'm trying to do is bind a Jersey Resource that matches <em>any</em> <code>@Path</code>, such that I can use Jersey to respond with a 404.</p>

<p>I'm looking to do this, since my servlet consists of different components (e.g. a rest API that lives under <code>/api</code>, and a web UI that lives under <code>/</code>.
In Guice terms, that means I have several <code>ServletModule</code>s that each set up one part of the servlet:</p>

<ul>
<li>In my <code>ApiServletModule</code>: <code>serve(""/api"").with(GuiceContainer.class, conf)</code></li>
<li>In my <code>WebUiServletModule</code>: <code>serve(""/"").with(GuiceContainer.class, conf)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In this setup, I want to define what the 404 response body looks like for each part of the webapp (<code>/api</code> or <code>/</code>) from the codebase of each subproject responsible, without having to reimplement Jersey</p>

<hr/>

<p>So far I have tried to bind a resource that match <code>@Path(""/"")</code>, <code>@Path(""*"")</code> and <code>@Path(""/*"")</code>, but none of these seem to be picked up when I request <code>/some/path/that/doesnt/exist</code></p>

"22046772","1","26806211","","2014-02-26 16:03:50","","12","4162","<p>I am developing a mobile app targeting the iOS and Android platforms.  The app will consist of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A relatively simple 'user login/signup and listing of database items' type of interface, powered by an already built webservice from and existing web application.</p></li>
<li><p>A video capture and upload feature using native plugins.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have done extensive research on PhoneGap for the last week, and have determined that even considering the well documented issues and limitations of PhoneGap, it is well suited for the 1st part of my app.</p>

<p>However, given the limitations of the PhoneGap Capture API ( org.apache.cordova.media-capture ), it is not appropriate for capturing video for upload, mostly due to the lack of control over video specs.  (On most devices, video captures will be enormous HD files that are not suitable for upload, even on Wifi, and certainly not over 3g/4g.)</p>

<p>Given my resources and timeline, I've determined that building native apps in both Java and ObjC are impractical, at least for now. I have very little ObjC and Java experience, but I am fairly confident and eager to learn these languages if need be.</p>

<p>That said, I am considering 2 options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first, and probably most rational, is that I pick the platform with the greater market share of my existing user base (iOS), suck it up, and go native.</p></li>
<li><p>The second, and perhaps lofty option, is that I develop a hybrid app in PhoneGap, targeting both platforms, and circumvent the limitations of my video capture ability by building native plugins for Java and ObjC using PhoneGap's plugin API, thus reducing development time on the rest of the app, and using native code only where it's needed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The requirements of my video capture plugin would be as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have complete control over the specs of the recorded video, most importantly resolution and bitrate. (Presumably with AVFoundation, and the like in Adroid SDK).</p></li>
<li><p>Control the user interface of the video capture functionality.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, I am aware that these tasks are very possible on both platforms when developing in the native api's as is evident by existing apps in the market. (Vine, etc..).</p>

<p>My real question, is <strong>what are the limitations, and issues with extending native functionality via PhoneGap's Plugin API?</strong>  There are almost no examples of work done in PhoneGap with this level of native implementation of video capture.  The one example I've found is this plugin, <a href=""https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/VideoCapturePlus-PhoneGap-Plugin/tree/1dabebe06cc5482a4574b800508a91230e25591b"">VideoCapturePlus</a>, which although I haven't been able to get to work, seems promising.</p>

<p><strong>I am especially interested to find out if anyone out there has successfully implemented native plugins in PhoneGap with this level of complexity, or if it is a rabbit hole I will wish I hadn't gone down.</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;
{{form.effort.help_text}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size=1 color=red&gt;
    {% for error in form.effort.errors %}
        {{error}}

    &lt;button onclick=""resetEffort();""&gt;reset&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>code for resetEffort() function is - </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=text/javascript&gt;
function resetEffort()
{
    $('input[name=""effort""]').prop('checked', false);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but when I click this reset button, It reset the radio buttons but at the same time tries to submit the form. It shows error warnings for the fields which are not filled and are mandatory. Focus reaches at the top of page.</p>

<p>Save button in form- </p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""{% url 'kaizen:addkaizen'%}"" method=""post""&gt;
 &lt;!-- other fields of form here --&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Save"" name=""save""/&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Error shown when clicking reset radio button (Or when submitting form without filling any value)</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/OD7c6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How can that be corrected so that clicking the reset button resets the radio button silently and do not try to submit the form.</p>

<p>PS - I don not want to reset whole form. I just want to reset one field i.e. radio button group. I already have reset button for whole form.</p>

<p>-Their header logo is larger than the rest of the content, with the bottom two edges angled in.

<p>This is the style I'm trying to do, but I was curious about the best way to do this.</p>

<p>The Updates, Snow Report, and Navigation (to make the header look 3d) have the effect built into the image.</p>

<p>But I've also seen the effect diagonally and it didn't interfere with functionality. I guess I'm just asking if there is another way to do this other than build it into the image itself.</p>

<p>Any Ideas?</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd

d = {'L':  ['left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right'],
     'R': ['right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left'],
     'VALUE': [-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1]}
df = pd.DataFrame(d)

idx = (df['VALUE'] == 1)
</code></pre>

<p>results in a data frame which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>       L      R  VALUE
0   left  right     -1
1  right   left      1
2   left  right     -1
3  right   left      1
4   left  right     -1
5  right   left      1
</code></pre>

<p>For rows where <code>VALUE == 1</code>, I would like to swap the contents of the left and right columns, so that all of the ""left"" values will end up under the ""L"" column, and the ""right"" values end up under the ""R"" column.</p>

<p>Having already defined the <code>idx</code> variable above, I can easily do this in just three more lines, by using a temporary variable as follows:</p>

<pre><code>tmp = df.loc[idx,'L']
df.loc[idx,'L'] = df.loc[idx,'R']
df.loc[idx,'R'] = tmp
</code></pre>

<p>however this seems like really clunky and inelegant syntax to me; surely pandas supports something more succinct?  I've noticed that if I swap the column order in the input to the data frame <code>.loc</code> attribute, then I get the following swapped output:</p>

<pre><code>In [2]: print(df.loc[idx,['R','L']])
      R      L
1  left  right
3  left  right
5  left  right
</code></pre>

<p>This suggests to me that I should be able to implement the same swap as above, by using just the following single line:</p>

<pre><code>df.loc[idx,['L','R']] = df.loc[idx,['R','L']]
</code></pre>

<p>However when I actually try this, nothing happens--the columns remain unswapped.  It's as if pandas automatically recognizes that I've put the columns in the wrong order on the right hand side of the assignment statement, and it automatically corrects for the problem.  Is there a way that I can disable this ""column order autocorrection"" in pandas assignment statements, in order to implement the swap without creating unnecessary temporary variables?</p>

    &lt;body id=""bodyID""&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

<p>I am trying to write a linq query that will retrieve all the ID's from any asp tag. Also, the query needs to group everything together alphabetically. So for the example above, the linq query should return ""lbl1"", followed by ""lbl2"", followed by ""txt1"", and finally ""txt2"". Notice it did not grab the ""bodyID"" because it was not part of an ASP.NET tag.  Is there an easy way to do this? I am using C#, by the way.</p>

<p>Recently, my script periodically hangs up when starting a session when run in debugger mode.  To troubleshoot it, I cancelled the script, and ran the following script which is located directly in <code>/var/www/html/main/testing</code>, and it just hangs when it gets to <code>session_start();</code>.  My PHP and Apache error log files show nothing.  Restarting Apache temporarily fixes it until I try to run the main script again in debug mode.  I've rebooted the client and server, and ran the PhpED project setup script, but the problem persists.  Changing the name of the session cookie allows it not to hang, but obviously this is not a solution.  <code>session_get_cookie_params()</code> shows it as being a normal non-secure cookie.</p>

<p>What might be causing this, and what are the recommended troubleshooting steps?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$cookie=print_r($_COOKIE,1);;
session_name('BACKSESSID');
$params=session_get_cookie_params();

<p>It is working as expected for normal images. However, it fails when I try to give it a png-8 image. I know it as a png-8 image from typing file image.png in the command line.

<p>The error message in the console is colorspace not supported. </p>

<p>After some googling, I realized that ""indexed color spaces are not supported for bitmap graphics contexts.""</p>

<p>Following some advice, instead of using the original colorspace, I changed it to </p>

<pre><code>colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();

<p>Now I am getting this new error: </p>

However we need to handle the case where the user leaves the page through other links... my first attempt is to use jQuery to fire a synchronous <code>$.ajax()</code> call on <code>$(window).unload</code>.  This does work, however on the next page the user sees, the entry appears to be locked (assuming they return to the page listing all the entries, perhaps via the back button).  A simple refresh of that page shows the entry is ready for editing again.</p>

<p>My guess here would be that for whatever reason the browser is fetching the next page before the ajax request has been completely processed.  The question is whether there is a way to ensure things happen in the correct order.</p>

I'm trying to figorue out how to prevent the user from pulling the js files directly (forcing them to pull only a bundle), in order to prevent viewing comments. Is there a way to implement a black list of files that can't be downloaded? If not, I was thinking of adding a series of random characters to the name of each js file.

<p>Now in my database I want to let users update data about each Hurricane, so I have one copy of the data that is set by the admin and each user has access to this data. When each user wants to update data about the Hurricane, I create a new copy of the admin created record and scope it so that each user sees only the newly created record that they modified. And each new record stores and 'original_id' attribute that stores the id of the model it was cloned from. However, each Problem model will still point to the original Hurricane record (created by the admin). I should also mention that each problem is <code>belongs_to</code> a <code>User</code></p>

<p>For a given user, when listing all the problems, I'd like to eagerly load all the associated Hurricanes, and instead of displaying the Hurricanes that they point to, I'd like to eagerly load the ones that they modified</p>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<p>In my <code>app/models/problem.rb</code></p>

<pre><code>class Problem &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :hurricane
  belongs_to :user_hurricane, -&gt; (problem) { where ""original_id = ? AND user_id = ?"", problem.hurricane_id, problem.user_id }, class_name: 'Hurricane'
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then I call some think like the following</p>

<pre><code>problems = Problem.includes(:user_hurricanes).where(user_id: current_user.id)
problems.each do |problem|
  puts problem.user_hurricane
end
# &gt;&gt; always returns nil
</code></pre>

<p>But the user_hurricane is always nil, so it doesn't successfully eagerly load the user specific Hurricane records. How would I do that?</p>

<pre><code>Marionette.Layout.extend({
        subCollection1: new SubCollection(),
        subCollection2: new SubCollection(),
        subCollection3: new SubCollection(),

        initialize: function () {

            });
            this.subView2 = new subView ({
                collection: this.subCollection2)
            });
            this.subView1 = new subView ({
                collection: this.subCollection3)
            });
        },

        onRender: function() {
            this.Reg1.show(this.subView1);
            this.Reg2.show(this.subView2);
            this.Reg3.show(this.subView3);
        },

        fetchColletions: function () {
            this.subCollection1.fetch({ data: { /* some data for webserver */ } });
            this.subCollection2.fetch({ data: { /* some data for webserver */ } });
            this.subCollection3.fetch({ data: { /* some data for webserver */ } });
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my subLayout I'm binding function to collection request in initialize function like this:</p>

<pre><code>Marionette.Layout.extend({
        onCollectionRequest: function () {
            console.log('summary.onCollectionRequest ' + this.cid);
            //debugger;
        },

        initialize: function () {
            this.listenTo(this.collection, 'request', this.onCollectionRequest);

        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, calling fetch on any of those collections triggers request events in all three collections so i get log like this:</p>

<p>fetchcollections</p>

<p>GET /* Server url */ 200 OK 157ms</p>

<p>onCollectionRequest view15</p>

<p>onCollectionRequest view24</p>

<p>onCollectionRequest view33</p>

<p>GET /* Server url */ 200 OK 332ms</p>

<p>onCollectionRequest view15</p>

<p>onCollectionRequest view24</p>

<p>onCollectionRequest view33</p>

<p>/* And so on for the third one */</p>

<p>Am I missing something? I always thought that event binding is per instance not per class. How should I adress this?</p>

<p>P.S. My code is additionaly wrapped in require.js define() but I think it's irrelevant for my problem so I omitted it in code fragments.</p>

"6515745","1","6515988","","2011-06-29 04:26:55","","0","291","<p>I've started using Django and am going right to generic views. Great architecture! Well, the documents are great, but for the absolute beginner it is a bit like unix docs, where they make the most sense when you already know what you're doing.  I've looked about and cannot find this specifically, which is, how do you set up an object_list template so that you can click on an entry in the rendered screen and get the object_detail?</p>

<p>The following is working. The reason I'm asking is to see if I am taking a reasonable route or is there some better, more Djangoish way to do this?</p>

<p>I've got a model which has a <strong>unicode</strong> defined so that I can identify my database entries in a human readable form. I want to click on a link in the object_list generated page to get to the object_detail page.  I understand that a good way to do this is to create a system where the url for the detail looks like <a href=""http://www.example.com/xxx/5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/xxx/5/</a> which would call up the detail page for row 5 in the database.  So, I just came up with the following, and my question is am I on the right track?</p>

<p>I made a template page for the list view that contains the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
{% for aninpatient in object_list %}
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='/inpatient-detail/{{ aninpatient.id }}/'&gt;{{ aninpatient }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, object_list comes from the list_detail.object_list generic view. The for loop steps through the object list object_list. In each line I create an anchor in html that references the desired href, ""/inpatient-detail/nn/"", where nn is the id field of each of the rows in the database table. The displayed link is the <strong>unicode</strong> string which is therefore a clickable link.  I've set up templates and this works just fine.  </p>

<p>So, am I going in the right direction? It looks like it will be straightforward to extend this to be able to put edit and delete links in the template as well.</p>

<p>Is there a generic view that takes advantage of the model to create the detail page? I used ModelForm helper from django.forms to make the form object, which was great for creating the input form (with automatic validation! wow that was cool!), so is there something like that for creating the detail view page?</p>

My question is about the following method below.</p>

NSLog(@""eja: DetailViewController/ formatDate()"");

NSDateFormatter *dateFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[dateFormatter setDateFormat:@""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.S""];
[dateFormatter release];


return [dateFormatter dateFromString:value];


}
</code></pre>

<p>It is returning an error reading ""<strong>Referenced-counted object is use after it is released</strong>"". I see that dateFormatter is being freed before it is returned/used. The issue is of course that if you put the release after the return statement you get a 'Potential leak of an object' error associated with dateFormatter var declaration. </p>

<p>I also tried ""autorelease""</p>

<pre><code>return [[dateFormatter dateFromString:value] autorelease];
</code></pre>

<p>But I then get the error '<strong>Object sent - autorelease too many times</strong>'.</p>

<p>I already tried to optimize the app by preloading the icons and images into variables and assigning those to the appropriate properties, however this didn't solve my problem.</p>

<p>Also, note that I managed to hide my main window by doing this (in Program.cs):</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace Tray
{
    static class Program
    {
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// The main entry point for the application.
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        [STAThread]
        static void Main()
        {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            Main mForm = new Main();
            Application.Run();
        }
    }
}

<h2><strong>UPDATE</strong></h2>

<p>I just noticed that the memory usage climbs up to 50MB and drops to 20MB afterwards (and goes up again). Is this something I can possibly address or is it a windows ""issue""?</p>

<pre><code>p {

<p>And this paragraph is an instance of Animation class:</p>

<p>With this code, i'm trying to apply the .active class in the paragraph if the page scroll more them 100, but is not working at all, not happens.</p>

<p>I think maybe it's because I'm trying to 'hear' the scroll inside the prototype , it is not possible? How can I make my instance hear the scroll and apply the class when the page scroll over 100 ??</p>

<p>If i do this:</p>

<pre><code>  $(window).scroll(function() {
    if ($(this).scrollTop() &gt; 100) {
      console.log('test');
    }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>The test will appear in my console, so, the window.scroll code is not wrong.</p>

<p>I have tried triggers, but they didn't work..</p>

<p>When i press btnSave this is the code that's executed:</p>

<pre><code>    protected void btnSave_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

        lblTitleError.Text = ""BUTTON PRESSED"";

    }
</code></pre>

<p>When i set a breakpoint, it runs the code. But the label text isn't set :S</p>

<p>Hope someone can help?</p>

<p>Thnx!</p>

<p>EDIT:  </p>

<p>I also tried this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""DocBtnBox""&gt;

<p>The result output puts a checkbox next to each line item, that you can use to delete items by line.  I want to be able to select multiple elements using the checkbox, and copy those form inputs,with the user entered data to ""x"" amount of rows depending on what is selected.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to combine .clone() with .val() in jQuery to grab the input values, and copy them to new rows?  I have experimented with different ideas, and have not come up with anything that works yet... but then again, I am not well versed with jQuery.</p>

"20377990","1","20456166","","2013-12-04 14:30:08","","4","3244","<p>I recently came across an odd behaviour in Webkit browsers (under OSX at least) which took far longer to resolve than I would like!</p>

<p>Essentially: setting <code>filter: blur(0)</code> (or the vendor-specific <code>-webkit-filter</code>) on an element should mean that no form of blur is applied to the element.</p>

<p>However Webkit still blurs the element when either <code>blur(0)</code> or zeroing with a unit specified (ie: <code>blur(0px)</code>) is assigned to it.</p>

<p>I've knocked together a quick Fiddle here to demonstrate: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/f9rBE/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/f9rBE/</a></p>

<p>This shows three identical divs containing text (no custom fonts):</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class=""no-blur""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This has absolutely nothing assigned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam facilisis orci in quam venenatis, in tempus ipsum sagittis. Suspendisse potenti. Donec ullamcorper lacus vel odio accumsan, vel aliquam libero tempor. Praesent nec libero venenatis, ultrices arcu non, luctus quam. Morbi scelerisque sit amet turpis sit amet tincidunt. Praesent semper erat non purus pretium consequat. Aenean et iaculis turpis. Curabitur diam tellus, consectetur non massa et, commodo venenatis metus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>One has no style at all assigned to it whilst the other two have <code>blur(0)</code> and <code>blur(0px)</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>.no-blur{}
.zero-px-blur{
    -webkit-filter: blur(0px);
    -moz-filter: blur(0px);
    -o-filter: blur(0px);
    -ms-filter: blur(0px);
    filter: blur(0px);
}

.zero-blur{
    -webkit-filter: blur(0);
    -moz-filter: blur(0);
    -o-filter: blur(0);
    -ms-filter: blur(0);
    filter: blur(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you take a look in Safari or Chrome, the bottom two are blurred:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yh58U.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A few things worth noting:</p>

<ul>
<li>This unintentional blurring also occurs in Safari on iOS7 devices (both iPhones and iPads);</li>
<li>It also occurs on Chrome and Safari under OSX;</li>
<li>It doesn't appear to occur under Chrome and Safari on non-retina Apple hardware;</li>
<li>It doesn't happen under FireFox in OSX.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, <code>filter: blur</code> isn't supported at all in Firefox just yet so it's hard to tell whether the behaviour I'm seeing is intentional/expected behaviour, or whether this is a bug in Webkit?</p>

<p>I eventually came to the conclusion that using <code>blur(none)</code> instead had the desired effect (ie: removed all blur effects), but I'm confused as to why using zero doesn't have the same effect given that in other filter examples (eg: <code>filter: grayscale</code>) can be reset simply using zero rather than the none keyword.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Dropping the <code>Meteor.bindEnvironment</code> wrapper fixes the problem, but i need it in order to be able to use Collections inside the callbacks</p>

<p>So what am i missing here? is it just not possible to use Promises + Meteor this way or is there a bug?</p>

<p>What i'm actually trying to accomplish is parallel pipelines that have important partial results but need a synchronized ending. Something like this.</p>

<pre><code>if (Meteor.isServer) {
  Meteor.startup(function () {
    // code to run on server at startup


    promises = [];

     step1 = function(input){
        return new Promise(function(res, rej){
          console.log(input + "":Step 1"");
          res(input);
        });
      };
      step2 = function(input){
        return new Promise(function(res, rej){
          console.log(input + "":Step 2"");
          res(input);
        });
      };
      step3 = function(input){
        return new Promise(function(res, rej){
          console.log(input + "":Step 3"");
          res(input);
        });
      };
      slowIO = function(input){
        var inp = input;
        return new Promise( function(res,rej){
          setTimeout(function(){
            console.log(inp + "":SlowIO"");
            res(inp);
          },Math.random()*20000);
        });
      };
      end = function(input){
        return new Promise(function(res,rej){
          console.log(input + "": done, commiting to database"");
          res()
        });
      };

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; ++i) {
      promises.push(step1(""pipeline-"" + i).then(step2).then(slowIO).then(step3).then(end));
    };

    Promise.all(promises).then(function(){
      console.log(""All complete"")
    });



  });

<p>Well, here's my question, I remember we used to do asynchronous JS function calls using XmlHttlRequests.  I remember the we used to write explicit functions by listening to states like =4 and so on.  In hindsight, seems like very low-level JS compared to some of the stuff I'm seeing nowadays.  </p>

<p>Current problem, I'm consuming a JS function from a 3rd party API that is synchronous.  Is there any way I can make it asynchronous, if it doesn't have a ""callback"" parameter, w/o the original API author changing?  Any wrapper, pattern, or any of these new libraries could do this?</p>

<p>I have an html layout, summarized with the relevant code below. Basically I have the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> acting as the main content, and the right handed content. I am trying to make sure they will always behave in this manner, regardless of any kind of funky boundaries caused by borders, margins, padding, etc. The solution seemed to be simply setting them to have absolute and relative positioning. </p>

Since the height is not always determinable at code-time, giving it a set height is not an option. My intended goal is that the underlying <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> background will stretch to accommodate no matter how high either of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> panes become.

<p>passport.js is being used for authentication and sessions.  I would expect connect.sid above to be constant for both requests, but it looks like a new session is being created on each call so the agent isn't logged in on the second call and no user object is returned.</p>

<p>When I test my app manually in a browser connect.sid remains constant after login and the functionality I'm testing does work.</p>

<p>I must be doing something wrong with agent, and I'm hoping someone can spot it.  Otherwise, suggestions on how I could debug the issue would be much appreciated.</p>

I want to do this to avoid getting a big class with tens of instance variables.</p>

<p>My problem is that these sub-grammars have a cyclic dependency: the structure grammar references the 'statement' rule of the statement grammar, which references the 'expression' rule of the expression grammar, which references the 'subroutineName' of the structure grammar (closing the dependency cicle). I tried the simple approach to have, e.g., a #subroutineName method in the expression grammar which looks like:</p>

<pre><code>MyExpressionGrammar&gt;&gt;subroutineName
  ^ N2TJStructureParser newStartingAt: #subroutineName
</code></pre>

<p>but that fails at initialization because of an infinite recursion (obviously).</p>

<p>To solve this problem, I created a PPDeferedParser:</p>

<pre><code>PPParser subclass: #PPDeferedParser
    instanceVariableNames: 'creationBlock'
    classVariableNames: ''
    poolDictionaries: ''
    category: 'PetitParser-Tools'

PPDeferedParser&gt;&gt;parseOn: aStream
    ^ creationBlock value parseOn: aStream
</code></pre>

<p>which makes the previous #subroutineName looks like:</p>

<pre><code>MyExpressionGrammar&gt;&gt;subroutineName
  ^ PPDederedParser creationBlock: [N2TJStructureParser newStartingAt: #subroutineName]
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work but I wonder if there is any other solution.</p>

<p>I know I'm not supposed to put huge chunks of code on stackoverflow, but I feel like the other parts could lead to the solution. So my problem is, When I get to level 3 (check comments) and to the print statement where it says ""Tell me a quote"", I'm not able to take the input for the line after. So the input for the String quote acts as if I had hit the enter key even if I didn't. So, it's taking the value before I'm even able to type anything. Please help me... If you need more explaining, let me know.</p>

<p>The problem I've encountered is that almost all the files (PDF being the only one not) are shown as corrupt files when the upload is done. This is most likely due to the fact SharePoint requires that the file being uploaded is sent as an <strong>ArrayBuffer</strong>. <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn769086%28v=office.15%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN Source</a></p>

<p>Using a regular Ajax POST and the method above to convert the file to an arraybuffer, I've successfully uploaded content to the SharePoint document library, without them getting corrupt. Now, I would like to do the same but without having to omit the use of Dropzone.js, that adds a very nice touch to the interface of the functionality.</p>

<p>I've looked into modifying the <code>uploadFiles()</code>-method in <code>dropzone.js</code>, but that seems drastic. I've also tried to figure out whether or not I can use the <code>accept</code> option in <code>options</code> but that seems like a dead end.</p>

<p>The two most similar problems with solutions are the ones linked below, where the first seems to be applicable in my case, but at the same time looks less ""clean"" than I would want to use.</p>

<p>The second one is for uploading images with a <code>Base64</code> encoding.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/27837178/1447173"">1 - Simulating XHR to get ArrayBuffer</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/22832623/1447173"">2 - Upload image as Base64 with Dropzone.js</a></p>

<p>So my question in a few less words is, when a file is added, how do I intercept this, convert the data to an arraybuffer, and then POST it using Dropzone.js?</p>

This function gets a pointer to password structure, into which 
I have to update details.</p>

<p>I get a <code>struct passwd*</code> to a function as an argument and my requirement is to update it's members to someother user's(user2) information and caller of this function should have all these updated details.</p>

<p>I tried following, can you please help me by suggesting what is an ideal way to do it.</p>

<p>My function is like this: </p>

<pre><code>struct passwd* myfunc(struct passwd *pw)
</code></pre>

<p>To this <code>pw</code>, I have to update details.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try1:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using <code>getpwnam()</code> get details of user2 into passed <code>struct passwd *pw</code>.</p>

<pre><code>pw = getpwnam(""user2"");
return pw;
</code></pre>

<p>Does not work, as we are not updating pw members rather we are just pointing <code>pw</code> to some other struct, pointer members of <code>pw</code>, still point to older data. 
And thus parent of <code>myfunc()</code> does not get updated details.</p>

<p>We have to write into members.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try2:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using <code>getpwnam()</code> get details of user2 into a temp <code>struct passwd*</code>.
Do a <code>memcpy(pw, temppasswd, sizeof(struct passwd))</code></p>

<p>Does not work as <code>memcpy</code> is a shallow copy and consequent <code>getpwnam()</code> (although the return is not given to <code>temppasswd</code>) will over write static buffer area, and <code>pw</code> may have different values.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try3:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tried <code>getpwnam_r()</code> which writes details into buffer passed as an argument to it rather than into a static data area (like <code>getpwnam</code>).</p>

<p>Can not use this, as I don't have <code>pw</code>, I have <code>*pw</code>.
So, I can not pass address of memory allocated to <code>pw</code> to <code>getpwnam_r</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try 4:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can do member by member copy in Try2, but it can result in memory leaks if I don't free <code>pw</code> structure pointer members before copying data into them.</p>

<p>Is there any other way to copy details to passed <code>pw*</code> without free-ing all struct <code>pw*</code> pointer members.</p>

<p>It is a bit confusing, I hope I make sense to someone.</p>

<p><em>""Use the Javadoc @throws tag to document each unchecked exception that
a method can throw, but do not use the throws keyword to include unchecked
exceptions in the method declaration. ""</em></p>

<p>Well that sounds reasonable indeed, but how to find out, what unchecked exception can my method throw?</p>

<p>Let's think of a following class :</p>

<pre><code>public class FooClass {

    private MyClass[] myClass;

    /**
     * Creates new FooClass
     */
    public FooClass() { 
        // code omitted
        // do something with myClass
    }

    /**
     * Performs foo operation.&lt;br /&gt;
     * Whatever is calculated.
     * @param index Index of a desired element
     * @throws HorribleException When something horrible happens during computation
     */
    public void foo(int index) {
        try {
            myClass[index].doComputation();

            throw new HorribleException(e);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I documented HorribleException, but it is quite obvious, that foo method can also throw unchecked <strong>java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</strong>. The more complex the code gets, it's harder to think of all unchecked exceptions that method can throw. My IDE doesn't help me much there and nor does any tool. Since I don't know any tool for this ...</p>

I've been using the Form Object pattern (or Decorator, or whatever you want to call it) to power these forms, particularly when there is specific validations that need to happen that don't match to a relevant model validation.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>class ProfileClaimRequestForm
  extend ActiveModel::Naming
  include ActiveModel::Conversion
  include ActiveModel::Validations

  attr_accessor :email, :profile
  delegate :persisted?, :id, to: :profile #??

  validate :matching_emails

  def initialize profile, email = nil
    self.profile = profile
    self.email = email
  end

  private

  def matching_emails
    errors.add(:email, 'The email address entered does not match our records') unless self.email == self.profile.profile.email
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>To invoke this I've been using <code>form_for @form_obj, profile_claim_path(@form_obj.profile.id)</code> which works fine, however I'm hoping I can DRY up that path declaration. I'm wondering if there is some magic method I can have my form object respond to to define the path or something similar. Ideally I could get it down to <code>form_for @form_obj</code></p>

since I added a third party iframe into the website the analytics referrals are going nuts, first they were adding fake visits, but this got solved with adding filters. but the referrals still not registing which page refers to the site like it did before... </p>

<p>the google analytics code it is just standar one:</p>

<pre><code>var _gaq = _gaq || [];
  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-xxxxxxxx-1']);
  _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'xxxxxxx.xxx']);
  _gaq.push(['_setAllowLinker', true]);
  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

  (function() {
    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);
  })(); 
</code></pre>

<p>and there is another push events for tracking clicks or functions calls, and the analytics inside the iframe is this one:</p>

<pre><code>var _gaq = _gaq || [];
_gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-xxxxxxxx-3']);
_gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'b.xxxxxxxxxx.com']);
_gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);
_gaq.push(['external._setAccount', 'UA-xxxxxxxx-1']); //this is my domain ga number
_gaq.push(['external._trackPageview']);
(function() {
var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);
})();
</code></pre>

<p>and they also have this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
/* &lt;![CDATA[ */
var google_conversion_id = 979036530;
var google_conversion_language = ""da"";

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion.js""&gt;

So far it only plays when the user hits the button.  I know there may be multiple ways to get the startup beep to play, but in order to work with initialization code I want to do it by calling my beep method from within the applicationDidFinishLaunching method of the AppDelegate.m file.  </p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<p>Log.h</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;


@interface Log : NSObject {

    IBOutlet id button;

}
-(void)beepAndLog;
-(IBAction)buttonPressed:(id)sender;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Log.m</p>

<pre><code>#import ""Log.h""


@implementation Log

-(void)beepAndLog {

    NSLog(@""The Method Was Called!"");
    NSBeep();

}

-(IBAction)buttonPressed:(id)sender {

    [self beepAndLog];
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>And the applicationDidFinishLaunching method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification {
    // Insert code here to initialize your application
    [Log beepAndLog];

}
</code></pre>

<p>In the applicationDidFinishLaunching method, however, XCode warns me that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Log' may not respond to '+beepAndLog'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and indeed, there is no beep and the log reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MethodResponse[11401:a0f] +[Log
  beepAndLog]: unrecognized selector
  sent to class 0x100002100</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(""MethodResponse"" is the name of my project, btw)</p>

<p>I'm unsure why Log wouldn't respond to beepAndLog, seeing as that's one of its methods. Am I calling it incorrectly?  I have a feeling this will be painfully obvious to you more experienced people.  I'm a newbie.  Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!</p>

Once again this works, you can inspect the html code in my browser and I see that the frames are added. But when I try to print out each text file nothing happens.

I'm able to write a text file to a directory on the sdcard (android 4), but no way to read it back again, using this code:</p>

<pre><code>function get_file () {  
window.requestFileSystem(LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT, 0, getFilesystem, fail);
}   
function getFilesystem(fs) {
alert(""getFilesystem -&gt; backup.txt"");  // OK !
// alert(""filesystem.name: ""+fileSystem.name);  // = persistent
// alert(""filesystem.root.name: ""+fileSystem.root.name);  // = long number
    // 
fs.root.getFile(""../../../../../../sdcard/test/backup.txt"", {create: false, exclusive: false}, 
    function(fileEntry) {
      alert(fileEntry.fullPath); // shows that my path is appended to ""data/..""
      fileEntry.file(function(file) {
      var reader = new FileReader();
      reader.onloadend = function(evt) {
        alert(+evt.target.result);  // NOT SHOWING !        
          };
        reader.readAsText(file);
    }, fail);
}, fail);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote the file using the writer function into the directory sdcard/test using this sequence of ../ - this is an ugly code but working !</p>

<p>But <code>fs.root.getFile</code> does not work in the same way - the fullPath information it returns shows that my path given is APPENDED to ""/data/data/com.appname/files"" but does not replace it ! </p>

<p>The onloadend function obviously isn't working since i never got the alert message, neither did I get an error message.
Change of path to ""file:///sdcard/test"" or ""sdcard/test"" has no effect either.</p>

<h2>Current architecture in ColdFusion 8 for .NET and CF integration:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Session is set when user logs in to the app (In CF). (We are using J2EE sessions.)</li>
<li><p>When a user clicks on a .NET link, <code>Jsessionid,CFID</code> and <code>CFTOKEN</code> are passed to .net page via url.  Inside .net code the following steps are done to check session:</p>

<p>2a. Call a common function which will do a ColdFusion file request (chkSession.cfm) with <code>jsessionid</code> in url.</p>

<p>2b. chkSession.cfm will return <code>session.UID</code> if available else will return -1. <code>Session.UID</code> will be available if the <code>jsessionid</code> in url is valid.</p>

<p>2c. .NET page will be loaded if a valid UID is returned. User will be redirected to login page if -1 is returned. </p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Issue in CF 10:</h2>

<p>In CF 10 , always we are getting -1. I read that as part of security enhancement in CF 10, we will not be able to recreate a ColdFusion session by passing <code>cfide</code>, <code>cftoken</code>, <code>jsessionid</code> in the url. </p>

<p>I would like to get your advice on what is the best way to make our .NET functionalties work in ColdFusion 10. Is there any better way to check ColdFusion session from .NET ? 
One option I can think of is using a database. I looking forward to a solution that can be implemented quickly and is robust.</p>

So the number inside 'SomethingElse' and 'SomethingMore' could be replaced to a new value, but any bracketed value to the right side of the term 'Field' would not be touched.  Note, the word ""Field"" will always stay the same, so it can be referenced as a magic string in the regex.</p>

The due date is optional. Right now I have a list of notifications, some have a due date and some don't. They all have a timestamp. What I'm trying to do is to sort them in a list using due date for the notifications that have that field and the timestamp for the notifications that don't have that optional field. As you can see, it's kind of weird that I'm using two fields as the key, however they are both datetime fields. So I think they should be able to compare.</p>

It works fine for stretching all the content of a particular column, but I would like to make a nested grid where only the last row is stretched.</p>

<p>To be more specific, this is my design:</p>

<p>This is a two column divided grid with on the right a nested grid. I would like to bottom align the buttons, and keep the info on top. I suspect that I will not be able to do this with only Semantic UI. This is what happens when I add the <code>stretched</code> class to the outer grid:</p>

<p>Which is almost but not quite what I want. What I need is a way to:</p>

<li>Make sure the nested grid takes on the height of its container (the outer grid's mutual column height).</li>
<li>Make sure the last row gets stretched and bottom align the contents.</li>

<p>I have a scatter plot (SVG image created with RSVGTipsDevice) with a thousand points and I want to reduce the size of each data point if a user zooms in, so that the separation between data points increases when zoomed in. </p>

<p>Example SVG scatter plot <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/bnpfk7o"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""here"">here</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT : Code used for creating above SVG scatter plot</p>

<pre><code>library(scatterplot3d)
library(RSVGTipsDevice)
devSVGTips(file=""Test.svg"", toolTipMode=1, onefile=FALSE, title=""plot"")
s3d&lt;-scatterplot3d(""x"",""y"",""z"", xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,10), zlim=c(0,10))

<p>Here is the idea of his code:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IAccountRepository
{
  Account GetAcountByID(int acId);
  void SaveAccount(Account account);
  List&lt;Account&gt; GetAllAccounts();      
}

public class AccountRepositoryLINQ : IAccountRepository

  void SaveAccount(Account account){
    ..... LINQ ..... 
  }
  List&lt;Account&gt; GetAllAccounts(){
    ..... LINQ query ..... 
    ...... return.....
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The class ""Account"" is the one generated automatically on the ""LINQ to SQL Classes"".</p>

<p><strong>Some of the problems I see:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1º</strong>
I code my business layer, GUI, etc... and later in time the  table Accounts in the database is changed (example: change the name of one column), then I need to rebuild the ""LINQ to SQL Classes"" and all my code layers will need to be recoded because my ""Account"" object changed.</p>

<p><strong>2º</strong>
If I need to have other repositories (MySQL, Oracle, XML, other), what ""Account"" class will I use?</p>

<p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Shouldn't I use a custom Account class? This will be used in all application layers.</li>
<li>How do the mapping from LINQ to my custom Account class?<br />
<ul>
<li>Using simple ""myClass.Name = linqClass.Name;"" ??? 
<ul>
<li>Isn't this consuming machine resources if I need to ""map"" all the classes? </li>
<li>There isn't a easiest/lightest way to do it? </li>
<li>Is this the correct approach? Is there other ways?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

Using Storyboard, I created a custom cell in my iPhone table view. The custom cell contains 3 labels and 1 image. 
In StoryBoard, this table view datasource and delegate is set to the MasterViewController class. 
My custom table view cell has 'User Interaction Enabled' in the View section of the attribute inspector.
In my MasterViewController class, the UITableViewDataSource methods such as 'numberOfSectionsInTableView' are working fine.
I have a seque defined between the table view and a detailed view. 
When I run the application and select a cell in the table view, the didSelectRowAtIndexPath is not called for the iPhone. My prepareForSegue method executes and the segue occurs.</p>

<p>I have read quite a number of posts on didSelectRowAtIndexPath not being executed, but I have not been able to solve my problem.</p>

<p>Any hints would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>My custom cell identifier is ConversationCell. The segue identifier is ShowConversationDetails.
I debug with a breakpoint on the first line of numberOfRowsInSection and this method is never entered.</p>

<p>The segue works and the detail view displays my label with 'Hello' text.</p>

<p><strong>Some Code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section
{

id &lt;NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo&gt; sectionInfo = [self.fetchedResultsController sections][section];

//NSLog(@""Rows %lu"",(unsigned long)[sectionInfo numberOfObjects]);
return [sectionInfo numberOfObjects];

}

- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{

static NSString *CellIdentifier = @""ConversationCell"";

UITableViewCell *cell =
[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];

[self configureCell:cell atIndexPath:indexPath];

return cell;

}

- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{

if ([[UIDevice currentDevice] userInterfaceIdiom] == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad) {


   [[self.fetchedResultsController sections] count]);


   NSManagedObject *object = [[self fetchedResultsController] objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];
    self.detailViewController.detailItem = object;
}
}

- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
{
if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@""ShowConversationDetails""]) {

    NSIndexPath *selectedIndex = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow];

    Event *e = nil;

    e = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:selectedIndex];

    UIViewController *destinationViewController = [segue destinationViewController];
    [segue.destinationViewController setLabel:@""Hello""];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>MASTERVIEWCONTROLLER:
Here is my interface for above;</p>

<pre><code>@interface MasterViewController : UITableViewController     &lt;NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate,ASIHTTPRequestDelegate,UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource&gt;
{
NSMutableArray *eventsArray;

}
</code></pre>

<p>This may be a clue to my problem. When I add the following code to prepareForSeque</p>

<pre><code>NSIndexPath *selectedIndex = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow];
    NSManagedObject *object = [[self fetchedResultsController] objectAtIndexPath:selectedIndex];
    NSString *messageTableID = [[object valueForKey:@""messagetableid""] description];
</code></pre>

<p>selectedIndex is empty as if a row is no longer selected when prepareForSeque is executing.</p>

<p>By the way, just to be safe, I removed the app from the simulator and then did a Clean on the project and nothing changed.</p>

I appreciate any information that will lead me to fully understand this issue regarding low performances of communicating web services hosted on the same machine.</em></p>

<p>I am currently developing a system with several WCF Web Services that communicate intensively.
They are running under IIS7, on the same machine, each service being in a different Application Pool, with multiple workers in the Web Garden.</p>

<p>During the individual evaluation of each Web Service, I can serve 10000-20000 requests per minute, quickly and without any issues for the resource consumption (processor and memory).</p>

<p>When I test the whole system or just a subsystem formed by two Web Services I can't serve more than 2000 requests/minute. 
I also observed that communication time between Web Service is a big issue (sometimes more than 10 seconds). But when testing with only 1000 requests per minute everything goes smoothly (connection time of no more than 60 ms).
I have tested the system both with SOAPUI and JMETER, but the times were computed based on system logs, not from the testing tools.
Memory and network aren't an issue (they are used very little).</p>

<p>Later on, I have tested the performance of 2 communicating WCF web services, hosted on two server and on the same server. It again seems that there is a bottleneck when the services are on the same machine, lowering the number of connection with from ten thousands to thousands; again, no memory or processor limiting.</p>

<p>As a note, I am working with quite big data in some cases and some of the operations needed are long ones.</p>

<p>I used perf.mon to see what's going on, for memory, processes, webservice, aspnet, etc. but I didn't see anything that could indicate what it's going wrong.
I also tried all the performance settings and tuning options I could find on the Internet.</p>

<p>Does someone know what can be wrong? Why the communication between Web Services could last so long? Why the Web Service which serves as an entry point in the system can accept 10000 requests/minute when is tested alone, but when communicating with another Web Service barely accepts 2000?
It's an IIS7 problem? Could my system perform better if each Web Service will be deployed on a different server?</p>

<p>I want to understand better how things internally function (IIS and WCF services) to improve performances for current and future systems.</p>

    &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Item 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul id=""list2""&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hover me over the items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=""status""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>List1 exists of drop targets. It's set to a maximum height and its overflow is hidden. List2 has just one draggable item.</p>

<pre><code>$(""#list1 li"").droppable({
    greedy: true,
    tolerance: ""pointer"",
    over: function(event, ui) {
        $(""#status"").text(
            ""Hovering over: "".concat($(this).text())
        );
    }
});

$(""#list2 li"").draggable();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when dragging the item from list2 over the list of droppables (list1), the 'over' event for each target is activated. This even occurs for the invisible items that are not displayed because of the fixed height. The 'drop' event is triggered for these items as well, so it's in fact possible to drop the item on an invisible target!</p>

<p>Any elegant ways to prevent this? Thanks.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For now I would like to put the first level of <code>div</code> ""element"" (sorry I don't know the proper terminology) in an array.
So I have tried to do it by simply giving <code>/div</code> as the xPath to the <code>searchWithXPathQuery</code> methods but it simply doesn't find anything.</p>

<p>My second solution was to try using a path of this kind : <code>//div[@class=\""head\""]</code> but also allowing <code>[@class=\""\""]</code> but I don't even know if it is possible. 
(I would like to do so because I need the elements to be in the same order in the array as they are in the data)</p>

<p>So here is my question, is there a particular reason why TFHpple wouldn't work with <code>/div</code>? 
And if there is noway to just take the first level of <code>div</code>, then is it possible to make a predicate on the value of an attribute with xPath (here the attribute <code>class</code>) ? (And how ? I have looked quite a lot now and couldn't find anything)</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>PS : If it helps, here is the code I use to try and parse the data, it is first contained in the string <code>self.material.Text</code> : </p>

<pre><code>NSData * data = [self.material.Text dataUsingEncoding:NSUnicodeStringEncoding];
TFHpple * tableParser = [TFHpple hppleWithHTMLData:data];
NSString * firstXPath = @""/div"";
NSArray&lt;TFHppleElement *&gt; * tableHeader = [tableParser searchWithXPathQuery:firstXPath];
NSLog(@""We found : %d"", tableHeader.count);

<p><code>plugin1, plugin2 and executable</code> all use both <code>common.a</code> and <code>libACE.a</code>
Follow the tutorial here: <a href=""http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html</a>.</p>

<p>The point is, when I use dlopen to open those two plugins, one succeeds and one fails
The successful one use more ACE functions and the error is complaining undefined symbol as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>[CModuleMgr] loadCModule(): Errors occurred when opening the module. nCModuleId[1] pLibHandle[(nil)] sCModulePath[/opt/acs/adapter/libadapter_d.so] sError[/opt/acs/adapter/libadapter_d.so: undefined symbol: _ZN17ACE_Event_Handler10set_handleEi]

<pre><code>bool bSuccess = LongFunction();
assert(bSuccess);
</code></pre>

<p>Here I got an assert when debugging, and I know there is something wrong with LongFunction, so I need to find where the function meet problems and returns:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I could probably debug it step by step, it works but is time-consuming, we don't what to do it this way.</p></li>
<li><p>I could search the keyword ""return"" (or even more refined search use RegExp), and set breakpoint at those returns, it should be faster, but it is still tedious manual work which can't be automated.</p></li>
<li><p>#define return TRACE(<strong>LINE</strong>); return</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It works but have following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>It will print too much redundant information as return is frequently used.(Or we could use some EnvVar to switch it on or off)</li>
<li>Does't work for following case: if(bOK) return true;</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you have any other creative ideas on how to pinpoint the problem?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> 
Here are some details to let us focus on the problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is about C++, and not platform specfic.</p></li>
<li><p>We don't want to refactoring the functions(Yea, I know we should), we even don't want to change any code - at this point we just want to provide some facility to make our application debugging easier. I also believe this should be a common requirement, don't you ever run into this?</p></li>
<li><p>The LongFunction() have multiple exit point, and the return type is not necessay bool(HRESULT, user defined errorcode...)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: A summary of current discussions:<br />
We have some controversies:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You should refactor the function.<br />
Yea, everyone know that we should, but that is not the point.If I had make the call to refactor the function, I won't be here to ask the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Find where the LongFunction() returns failure doesn't help.<br />
It is always the first thing I do to locate where the error occurs to know what happened, I am curious why this doesn't help, what did you do in this situation? (Assume I am already familiar with how the function works)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And we have 2 reasonable solutions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>ReturnMarker from Crashworks, a stack object in the function will destruct when function returns, set the breakpoint at the destructor will show you where it returns in debuger</p></li>
<li><p>CMyBool(x) from Binary &amp; Sadsido, change the return type of LongFunction to CMyBool which can contruct from a bool, return from LongFunction will contruct that object, so just set a breakpoint at the constructor will work.</p></li>

<p>I am simply trying to send the json object out (or bits of it) with this factory. I can console.log inside the http get and it seems to be grabbing the json just fine. I seem to have hit a wall, any help would be much appreciated. I would just like the all ad first functions to be working. thanks!</p>

<p>I first had success by hard coding the levelsHere above it with the json string like var levelsHere = [{""stuff in here""}], but when i moved it over to an $http it doesn't work. </p>

<p>In my main.php routing:</p>

<pre><code>'&lt;language\w+&gt;/profile/&lt;slug:[\w\-]+&gt;'  =&gt; 'profile/index',
'&lt;language\w+&gt;/&lt;action:\w+&gt;'            =&gt; 'site/index',

<p>Which outputs to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/domainname/nl/profile/calendar"" method=""post""&gt;

<p>Note: domainname is there because I'm testing this on localhost.</p>

<p>However, when pressing the submit button it forwards me to the home instead of  the correct page. Simply visiting <code>/domainname/nl/profile/calendar</code> in the browser <strong>does</strong> work and gives me the correct controller. I don't know why it isn't working in the form.</p>

<p>In a different form on the same website, I have the following, which again <em>does</em> work fine for the routing:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/domainname/nl/profile/info"" method=""post""&gt;

<p>The difference between these 2 forms is that the last one is created through CActiveForm widget and the first one isn't.</p>

<pre><code>   static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        const int count = 10000000;

        var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

        const int repeat = 20;

        double indeces = 0;
        double forEach = 0;

        for (int iteration = 0; iteration &lt; repeat; iteration++)
        {
            stopwatch.Restart();
            long tmp = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
            {                    
                tmp += list[i];
            }

            indeces += stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;
            stopwatch.Restart();
            foreach (var integer in list)
            {            
                tmp += integer;
            }

            forEach += stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;
        }

        Console.WriteLine(indeces /repeat);
        Console.WriteLine(forEach /repeat);

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, it just accesses the elements.</p>

<p>As I expected, index access was faster. This are the results of Release build on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>    0.0347//index access
    0.0737//enumerating
</code></pre>

<p>However, I decided to change test a little:</p>

<pre><code>        //the same as before
        ...
        IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; listAsEnumerable = list;
        //the same as before
        ...
        foreach (var integer in listAsEnumerable)
        {                
            tmp += integer;
        }
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>And now output was following:</p>

<pre><code>    0.0321//index access
    0.1246//enumerating (2x slower!)
</code></pre>

<p>If we are enumerating the same list via interface, the performance is  <strong>2 times</strong> slower! </p>

<h2>Why does this* happening?</h2>

<p><strong>this</strong> means ""enumerating via interface 2 times slower than enumerating the actual list"".</p>

<p>My guess is that runtime is using different <code>Enumerator</code>s: the list's in first test and a generic one in the second test. </p>

<p>According to Apple's <strong>CollectionViewTransition</strong> sample application and Session 218 of WWDC 2013, <code>UICollectionViewController</code> has a property called <code>useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions</code> that basically handles navigation transitions by interpolating 'from' and 'to' collection view's layouts.</p>

<p>Let's assume that I have two <code>UICollectionViewControllers</code> called <strong><em>MasterCollectionViewController</em></strong> and <strong><em>DetailCollectionViewController</em></strong>. When I push <strong><em>DetailCollectionViewController</em></strong> from <strong><em>MasterCollectionViewController</em></strong>, layout is properly changed, but collection view still uses the data source declared in <strong><em>MasterCollectionViewController</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This is a problem for me, because in each of <code>UICollectionViewController</code>s, I need to rearrange section/item configurations. A good example of what I am trying to do is Photos application on iOS 7. The first tab of this application has three view controllers: years, collections, and moments. These view controller all show the same contents: photos. What's different between each view controller is how photos are grouped in section. And section grouping is the responsibility of <code>UICollectionViewDataSource</code> which is an issue here.</p>

<p>If the behavior of <code>useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions</code> property that I am experiencing is a normal behavior, is there a way to achieve my goal in different approach?</p>

<p>Any help or comment would be appreciated.</p>

<p>In order to project population through time, I have to first make the calculations with the women so that I may calculate the percentage of new born men and women based on a statistical constant of masculinity birth rate.</p>

<p>That said, I have a first matrix which contains both men and women population per year of age.</p>

<pre><code>// Where 1 is the evaluation Id and 2009 the year I want the 
// initial population information for.
IList&lt;AnnualPopulation&gt; initialPopulation = 
    LoadMatrix&lt;AnnualPopulation&gt;(1, 2009);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in order to project the women's population first, I use the following:</p>

<pre><code>IList&lt;AnnualPopulation&gt; initialWomenPopulation = (
        from w in initialPopulation
        where String.Equals(""F"", w.Gender)
        select w
    ).FirstOrDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>And I have to consider mortality rates for both the current (initial year (2009)) and the year for which I wish to project, from which I already have mortality rates for each year of age.</p>

<pre><code>IList&lt;AnnualDeathRate&gt; deathRates = LoadMatrix&lt;AnnualDeathRate&gt;(1, 2009)
</code></pre>

<p>This loads the deather rates from 2009 and later for each year of age. Hence, in order to only consider 2009 and 2010, let's say, I used the following Linq code.</p>

<pre><code>AnnualDeathRate[] femaleDeathRates = (
        from fdr in deathRates
        where (string.Equals(""F"", fdr.Gender))
        select fdr
    ).TakeWhile(dr =&gt;

<p>Here are four of the ways I tried:</p>

VALUES (425020, 547538, 548029, 548853, 552373);

<p>Since I am submitting this via an ASP page I am trying to avoid writing an insert line for every value. I have had over 20,000 values before.</p>

<p>Obviously the above code failed because in the first and third insert each comma indicates a column to SQL. In the second and fourth insert it is incorrect syntax near "",""</p>

<p>I have built much more complicated queries and yet for some reason I can't figure out this simple insert.</p>

<p>I am not trying to insert the entire string into a single field. I am trying to take a string that has FIVE numbers and put them into 5 rows. So <code>425020,547538,548029,548853,552373</code> should go into the table as:</p>

First I thought that it's just a ""Clean/Update Project/Maven Rebuild"" issue or maybe the order of the includes of the libraries didn't fit anymore (for example, Maven dependencies are not on top or something similar), but I was able to build by Maven, so no project or Maven problems, but an Eclipse problem. To get it working again I had to add Hamcrest, Junit and Mockito from the Maven repo to the build path manually. I didn't had to do that before in this project (except android-4.1.1.4.jar).

<p>I'm making a JQuery navigation menu that uses sprites as the buttons.  What I'm aiming for is a row of paint tubes that roll out when you hover over them, and get squeezed when you click them.  I've gotten everything set up except I'm running into problems when someone presses one, then drags (The button animates from the bottom right of the sprite to the top left instead of moving only left).  I'm not sure how to animate something only using the x axis, and making the sprite animate to the top with a time of 0 makes the animation mess up.</p>

<p>Here's my javascript.  The ids #home, #about etc. are the individual buttons,and the #NavBar is the div that contains them.  </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $(""#home, #about, #members, #gallery, #press, #campaign, #calendar, #network, #join, #request, #contact"").hover(function () {
        $(this)

        .animate({backgroundPosition:""(-35px 0px)""}, 300)
        .animate({width:""105""}, 300)
    });

<p>Now I have registered the tlb/dll files on my computer and I am able to create an instance of the class in vb6 with </p>

<p>Is this possible what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
After searching through the registry I am only able to find a CLSID which references Advantage.Dealer.Email.CoreClassLibrary.</p>

<p>I had another look in the registry and found a Guid called </p>

<p>which referenced the library, when I used the code</p>

<pre><code>CreateObject(""CoreClassInterface"")

<p>the vb6 program worked.</p>

<p>For anyone that comes across this post in the future it was because I had set the ProgID in the vb.net class when setting up the class with an interface for the Com Interop.</p>

<p>After removing the ProgID for the class and rebuilding/registering the library on my computer I found </p>

The navigation however don't work. I don't see what im doing wrong, list.php does it jobs when run normaly:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
      $(function() {
          function plusMinTen(from){
              $.get(
                  ""list.php""
                  {
                      from: from,
                  },
                  function(list){
                      $('#formin').html(list);
                  }
              );
          }

          function takeIn(into){
              alert(""in""+into);
          }
          function takeOut(out){
              alert(""out""+out);
          }
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The functions takeIn and takeOut should add or remove the values temporary to SESSSION array and I have good idea how to do it, but I need to fix this AJAX-Problem first. Another thing I used alert to test if my JS works and it does, but I noticed something strange:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""checkbox"" onclick=""javascript: this.checked ? alert('in'+this.value) : alert('out'+this.value) ;"" id=""filter"" value=""14"" name=""filter""&gt;value14&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Value should be taken in when I check the box and out when I uncheck it but in this way it seems visa versa. Because I suspeceted something along this lines:</p>

<pre><code>if(this.checked){
      takeOut(this.value);
}else{
     takeIn(this.value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>but obviously it works the other way round can someone explain?</p>

<ul>
<li>a 'toy' version of the authentication in a dummy page with no js/img/css/png assets</li>
<li>URL mapping in the controller. So: <code>http://myhost/myapp/login</code> and <code>http://myhost/myapp/homepage/*</code> all serve up a page</li>
<li>Hibernate/JPA integration</li>
<li>in short, everything EXCEPT that, in the full-fat login page with assets, even when I put in the correct username/pass combination, the authentication is rejected &amp; redirects to the authentication failure URL.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Spring 3.2, Spring Security 3.1.3. I am using XML-based authentication for now - see below - so nothing to do with the Hibernate/JPA piece, I think it's exclusively an issue with how I've set up Spring) </p>

<p>My questions, then are two:</p>

<ul>
<li>is the .png file triggering an authentication call as it's being processed by the servlet? In which case, how do I filter it out? (.jpg .js .css is ignored by default as 'Public Object' and so not security-screened?</li>
<li>Is there something odd with the configuration files (reproduced below) now security has been bolted on?</li>

<p>The shell strips off the quotes around ""param with spaces"", and because popen4 only accepts strings, there is no way to add these back on without doing some regexp work that I worry will introduce bugs.</p>

<p>Is there a way to access the 'shell bypassing' feature that popen uses and pass that object to popen4?  </p>

<p>Or, is there a way to take the array of strings, and format it with encased quotes where appropriate so that params that include spaces are recognized as one argument? I could then pass this string to popen4.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    int x=3, y=4, z=6;

    if (x &lt; y &lt; z) {
        z = z+1;
        printf(""This if statement got hit. Value of z is %d\n"", z);

        z = z+2;
    }

    printf(""Values: x=%d y=%d z=%d\n"", x, y, z);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first if statement evaluates to true, as I expect. <code>z</code> is incremented. However, the second if statement does not evaluate to be true. It seems to me that the logic is reversed and that the condition should also be evaluated to true. The final printf outputs <code>Values: x=3 y=4 z=7</code>. I was expecting <code>Values: x=3 y=4 z=9</code>.</p>

<p>Is anyone able to shed some light on why this is so?</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

The game itself is very simple, but as it is not for entertainment, but for a biological experiment, so it has some specific features:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We will project the graphics to a spherical screen with 3 projectors, so the graphics should be in a <strong>fisheye trasformation</strong>, and be <strong>easily further transformable</strong> (to deal with the merging between projectors).</p></li>
<li><p>There should be a functionality to <strong>record data</strong>, like the path of the player, and the time points when the monster appears etc. All the events should be recordable.</p></li>
<li><p>The game program could <strong>interact with external devices</strong> via USB. For example, whenever the player press a certain key, the program will tell an Arduino board to do something.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As my invesigation, I found three candidates of tool chain to develop such a game:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Develop <strong>a MOD on Quake3 engine</strong> + <a href=""http://strlen.com/gfxengine/fisheyequake/"" rel=""nofollow"">Fisheye Quake</a>. The problem I think would be that the Quake3 runs with a virtual machine, so that is it possible to implement the feature 2 and 3 above? </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Panda3D</strong> + <a href=""https://www.panda3d.org/apiref.php?page=FisheyeLens"" rel=""nofollow"">FisheyeLens API</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>PyOpenGL</strong>. This is the most flexible way, but with the greatest workload I think.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm quite familiar with C/C++/Python, but this is my first time to develop a 3D game. My question is which tool chain is fittest for this project (or any other good options) ? What problem would I encounter?</p>

there was a problem, <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=7"" rel=""nofollow"">problem 3</a>, you can go to that link and see what it requires. 
To solve it, i just wrote a function to find if that number is prime or not. Simple.</p>

<p>But, problem 10 requires sum of all prime number under 2 million(2000000), I solve this by simply checking all numbers until 2m and see if its prime then add it to some variable.(if its prime)</p>

<p>However, doing that takes so much time. and with so much time i mean hours. lots of hours. so I dont think my answer was right :)</p>

<p>I googled the question before asking here, but I found no c#. closest one i can found was java and fortran, which i cant seem to realize the algorithm.</p>

<p>Here I am, asking this. how you could do this ? checking every number till 2m and notice it if its prime is not fast way.(also this questions supposed to be calculated under 1 minute(by problem i mean, not by you lol) afaik)</p>

<p>Okay, I have to write a program that takes in user inputs until the user types ""x"", at which time my code is supposed to evaluate three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>if number of inputs (n) is square</li>
<li>if inputs are unique &amp; contain numbers 1-n</li>
<li>if the order in which the inputs were put in generates a magic square.</li>
</ol>

<p>As always, any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>SOLUTION:</p>

<p>Thanks, everyone.  I've all but got it now.  I really appreciate your help.</p>

<p>I used</p>

<pre><code>    private ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList();
</code></pre>

<p>in the top declarations along with </p>

<pre><code>    private int [][] square;
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>    double dubble = Math.sqrt(numbers.size());
    int squareSize = (int)dubble;

    square = new int[squareSize][squareSize];
</code></pre>

<p>in the AddToSquare() method, which I called directly after my while loop in the test class.  </p>

<p>I hope this helps anyone looking for the answer in the future.</p>

Problem occurs when multiple user logs in at the same time and they can see each others data as DbContext keeps on switching between different users.</p>

<p>I am using EF 5.0 and Autofac IOC mainly. Whats the best way to manage this? </p>

<p>How can I have my DbContext maintain its data for that specific user and will not change even though other users logged in and will have different database contexts for them?</p>

            return new CustomerDataContext(ConnectionString);

        .As&lt;ICustomerDataContext&gt;()

The method <code>window.webkitNotifications.requestPermission</code> can only be called from a user action (click, etc.). Call it anywhere else will have no effect and will not throw any error. </p>

<p>For some reasons I need to run it later on another event, originally generated by a real click.</p>

<p>I tried to run this method by generating a click like this:</p>

<pre><code>var a = document.createElement('a');
a.addEventListener('click', function () {
  window.webkitNotifications.requestPermission()
});
var evt = document.createEvent(""MouseEvents"");
evt.initMouseEvent(""click"", true, true, window, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,
false, false, false, false, 0, null);
a.dispatchEvent(evt);

<p>But as expected the method has no effect.
Which leads me to wonder how Chrome really detects user actions? 
What's the difference between a generated event and one generated by a real user action?</p>

<p>I've also tried to keep a reference to the original click event and pass it back when I need to call this method, but it does not work.</p>

<p>Running the debugger finds that numberOfItemsInSection is returns the CORRECT count of the items and the number of passes through the dequeue loop is correct, but the last item added (which should always be the last cell in the cv, as the items are unsorted) is not displayed.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find any articles mentioning anything quite like this so I'm guessing I have a bug somewhere, but it is elusive.</p>

I want all of these models to have validation that makes sure that the warehouse entered is a valid warehouse.  It seemed like the easiest way to do this was to use a custom ValidationAttribute class.  Then the validation code would be centralized, and I could just add the attribute to the property in each of the models.</p>

<p>I need to call a service to make sure that the warehouse is a valid warehouse.  I have a interface that represents this service and I am using Ninject to do dependency injection in my applications where this service is used.  That way I can use mocking and easily do unit testing on the application.</p>

<p>I want my custom ValidationAttribute class to use dependency injection when using this service.  Here is the class that I have created:</p>

<pre><code>public class MustBeValidWarehouse : ValidationAttribute
{
  public override bool IsValid(object value)
  {
    if (value is string)
    {
      string warehouse = value.ToString();
      NinjectDependencyResolver depres = new NinjectDependencyResolver();
      Type inventServiceType = typeof(IInventService);
      IInventService inventserv = depres.GetService(inventServiceType) as IInventService;
      return (inventserv.GetWarehouses().Where(m =&gt; m.WarehouseId == warehouse).Count() != 0);

    }
    else
    {
      return false;
    }
  }
}


public class NinjectDependencyResolver : IDependencyResolver
{
    private IKernel kernel;
    public NinjectDependencyResolver()
    {
        kernel = new StandardKernel();
        AddBindings();
    }

    public object GetService(Type serviceType)
    {
        return kernel.TryGet(serviceType);
    }

    public IEnumerable&lt;object&gt; GetServices(Type serviceType)
    {
        return kernel.GetAll(serviceType);
    }

    private void AddBindings()
    {
        kernel.Bind&lt;IInventService&gt;().To&lt;InventService&gt;();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dependency injection works correctly, however it is not easy to test.  There is no way to inject a mock IInventService into the class in a unit test.  Normally in order to resolve this I would have the class constructor take a IInventService parameter so that I could pass in a mock object in my unit test.  However I don't think that I can have this class constructor take a IInventService class as a parameter because then I believe that I would have to pass in that parameter when I added this attribute in my class.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make this code more testable?  If not then is there a better way to approach this?</p>

<p>My main question is what language I should write it in -- it'll be relatively simple graphics, more like Terraria than Minecraft. I know Java relatively well and Minecraft is written in it, but C++ seems like the industry standard for game development. However, I know next to no C++. I'm willing to learn but am worried how it will turn out for my first real project in the language.  </p>

<p>In addition to that, I'd also like suggestions on a good game engine for the language that you suggest. I'd like it to run on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows for sure</li>
<li>Linux for sure</li>
<li>Mac for sure</li>
<li>Android would be really nice</li>
<li>iOS is optional</li>

<p>in the currently used FLUIDTEMPLATE on a multilingual page.</p>

_PAGES_OVERLAY_LANGUAGE =&gt; 1 (integer)

<p>Some Information about the system:</p>

<ul>
<li>Typo3 6.2.4</li>
<li>Fluid 6.2.0 (Sys Standard)</li>
<li>Extbase 6.2.0 (Sys Standard)</li>
</ul>

<p>If it's relevant I want this to use direktly in the FLUIDTEMPLATE file, not in an Extbase Extension Fluid Template. So I don't have a Controller to do some custom queries and forward them to my the view.</p>

<p>Typoscript language configuration is simple two language standard and works otherwise</p>

<p>P.S. I'm just using the title in my question, because its available out of the box. My actual usecase is for several custom fields added to page and page_language_overlay by my own extenision. But as for this question you can ignore that fact.</p>

<p>Here's the configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Guest OS is Cent OS 6.3 running on Virtualbox.</p></li>
<li><p>Apache 2.4 is installed and running on guest with host port 4000
being forwarded to guest port 80.</p></li>
<li><p>Tomcat 7 is installed and running on guest with host port 4040 being
forwarded to guest port 8000 (for JPDA debugger).</p></li>
<li><p>mod_jk is installed to forward requests from Apache to Tomcat.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the most part, it works. I have one webapp deployed at /mywebapp, which I can access by entering <a href=""http://localhost:4000/mywebapp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:4000/mywebapp</a> into my <strong>host</strong> browser. The problem occurs when the mywebapp application does a credentials check, and issues a redirect if there is no logged in user.</p>

<p>What happens at this point is that my <strong>host</strong> browser URL is changed to <strong><a href=""https://localhost"" rel=""nofollow"">https://localhost</a></strong>/mywebapp/login.jsp instead of <strong><a href=""https://localhost:4000"" rel=""nofollow"">https://localhost:4000</a></strong>/mywebapp/login.jsp, which causes me to get an error since I don't have Apache running on my host machine.</p>

<p>I know that mod_jk is working, because I can debug the mywebapp application and follow it to the point where the forward actually happens, so I know that the request is successfully being forwarded <strong>to</strong> Tomcat. Because of this I believe the problem lies with Tomcat and not Apache.</p>

<pre><code>sc = new MyServiceSoapClient() 
</code></pre>

<p>and this contructor reads
EndpointAddress and Binding and Behavior from Winword.exe.config
(this is because out software is a winword Addin)</p>

<p>But the customer demands that we dont touch the Winword.exe.config file.</p>

<p>So we changed our strategy to create a channel from a ChannelFactory
because in this case we can use any "".config"" file we like.</p>

<p>unfortunatedly the channel we get from the ChannelFactory is a ""MyServiceSoap"" but it is not a ""MyServiceSoapClient"".</p>

<p>We dont want to do each WebService call via the created channel 
because this would imply that we re-implemented very many calls like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>creating a request object</p>
      
      <p>calling the WebService Method</p>
      
      <p>reading the result from the response object.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>so we tried to instanciate the MyServiceSoapClient this way:</p>

<pre><code>sc = new MyServiceSoapClient(chfact.Endpoint.Binding, chfact.Endpoint.Address)
</code></pre>

<p>this worked fine, we finally got our SoapClient out of any "".config"" file and we were not depending on the Winword.exe.config file.</p>

<p>but then the customer added some Behavior to the config file because of security reasons.</p>

<p>well, the channelFactory certainly reads the Behavior from the config file but there is no constructor like this:</p>

<pre><code>sc = new MyServiceSoapClient(Binding, Address, Behavior)
</code></pre>

<p>so we cannot create a FULLY VALID MyServiceSoapClient from an existing MyServiceSoap-channel.</p>

<p>The Behavior works fine if we created the MyServiceSoapClient with it's default constructor - but then the customer would need to configure the Winword.exe.config what he denies to do.</p>

<p>It is also impossible to typecast like this:</p>

<pre><code>sc=(MyServiceSoapClient)channel;
</code></pre>

<p>because channel is a MyServiceSoap interface.</p>

<p>QUESTION:</p>

<p>Is there any way to create a MyServiceSoapClient from a MyServiceSoap-channel or from a channelFactory ?</p>

<p>Or can it be done with some sophisticated Type-Casting? </p>

<p>While I've got <code>GameKit</code> set up and are able to send small messages across, I now would like to expand and send across whole files.</p>

<p>I've been reading that you have to split large files up into packets before sending them across individually.</p>

<p>So I decided to create a <code>struct</code> to make it easier to decode the packets when they're received at the other end:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
    const char *fileName;
    NSData *contents;
    int fileType;
 int packetnumber;
 int totalpackets;
} file_packet; 
</code></pre>

<p>However, for small files (8KB and less) I thought one packet will be enough.</p>

<p>So for one packet, I thought I would be able to create a file_packet, set its properties, and send it via -sendDataToAllPeers:withDataMode:error:</p>

<pre><code>NSData *fileData;
file_packet *packet = (file_packet *)malloc(sizeof(file_packet));
packet-&gt;fileName = [filename cStringUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
packet-&gt;contents = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:selectedFilePath];
packet-&gt;packetnumber = 1;
packet-&gt;totalpackets = 1;
packet-&gt;fileType = 56; //txt document
fileData = [NSData dataWithBytes:(const void *)packet length:sizeof(file_packet)];
free(packet);

NSError *error = nil;
[self.connectionSession sendDataToAllPeers:fileData withDataMode:GKSendDataReliable error:&amp;error];
if (error) {
 NSLog(@""An error occurred: %@"", [error localizedDescription]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I don't think something's right setting fileData - and <code>error</code> displays nothing.</p>

<p>When a file's received, I do the following: </p>

<pre><code>file_packet *recievedPacket = (file_packet *)malloc(sizeof(file_packet));
recievedPacket = (file_packet *)[data bytes];
NSLog(@""packetNumber = %d"", recievedPacket-&gt;packetnumber);
...
</code></pre>

<p>However, the output on the console is <code>packetNumber = 0</code>, even when I set packetNumber to 1.</p>

<p>Am I missing the obvious?
I don't know much about <code>NSData</code> or <code>GameKit</code>.</p>

<p>So my question is - Can I add a <code>file_packet</code> in <code>NSData</code>, and if so, How do I do it successfully - and How do you split files up into multiple packets?</p>

<p>Let's try again.  I am using Xcode's Visual Storyboard.  I'm using a Navigation Controller Scene, which is linked to a View Controller Scene, which is then linked to 3 separate View Controller Scenes via buttons.  </p>

<p>When I highlight the first View Controller Scene and enable the Assistant Editor, I am able to make changes to ViewController.h or .m in the adjacent window.  </p>

<p><strong>Heart of the Problem:</strong>
When I select any one of the 3 separate View Controller Scenes, my Assistant Editor shows ""@interface UIViewController.h"" when I was expecting ViewController.h or .m .  What's more, I can't make any changes as an error pops up ""This content is locked for editing"".  </p>

<p>Be gentle, I'm new.  I'm sure I'm just missing something small.</p>

<p>I've tried a little experiment this weekend to see how hard it would be to do it and had following problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>I've added one class System.Static to my version of mscorlib but had TypeLoadException with message that it can't load type 'System.Static`1' from 'mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089. So it seems that somehow it's still loading MS library. How to avoid that (I'm using /nostdlib switch already)?.</li>
<li>When I named my mscorlib 'mycorlib' I had errors that System.Object must have a parent class</li>
<li>If I have generic type T and I'm doing <code>new T()</code> it's translated by c# compilator to <code>Activator.CrateInstance&lt;T&gt;()</code> which in MS implementation calls <code>RuntimeTypeHandle.CreateInstance(...)</code> which is native method. Can I call it from my mscorlib or is it included in mscorlib provided by MS?</li>
</ol>

<p>My goal was to test the possibility of writing my versions of int, double, string and other standard types. I want to use MS CLR, but just provide my managed code classes.</p>

<p>Is it possible?</p>

<p>I like to try to keep my commits clean so I want to be loudly warned in the commit message when there are automatic changes being staged/committed. Here are my <code>pre-commit</code> and <code>pre-commit-msg</code> hooks:</p>

<p>.git/hooks/pre-commit
</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/sh

# Save user changes to db/ (if any)
git diff --quiet db/
user_dirty=$?
[[ $user_dirty &gt; 0 ]] &amp;&amp; git stash save --keep-index

# Regenerate db/ automatically
db/save_schema_and_meta_tables.sh

# Were any automatic changes made? If so, commit them but warn about it
git diff --quiet db/
auto_dirty=$?
if [[ $auto_dirty &gt; 0 ]]; then
    git add db/
    echo ""WARNING: automatic changes to db/ added to commit"" | tee .git/COMMIT_WARNING
fi

[[ $user_dirty &gt; 0 ]] &amp;&amp; git stash pop
exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/sh
msgf=$1
wf=.git/COMMIT_WARNING
if [ -e $wf ]; then
    msg=$(&lt;$msgf)
    ( cat $wf; echo ""$msg"" ) &gt; $msgf
    rm -f $wf
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Here's how it behaves:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I have made changes to <code>db/</code> but haven't staged them yet, they are kept in the working tree without disturbing the commit, thanks to <code>stash save --keep-index</code> and <code>stash pop</code>. Good!</li>
<li>However, if I have <strong>staged</strong> changes to <code>db/</code> and they are overwritten by the automatic commit, then the user-intended changes are gone after the commit. Bad!</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's what I would <strong>like</strong> to happen: if there are user-staged changes to <code>db/</code> and they don't exactly match the automatic changes, then the whole thing should abort. I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to implement this: how can I save the staged changes made by the user, then see if the automatic changes don't match?</p>

<p>Actually the commands are almost similar. The only difference is that if we try to get the space details of a remote machine, then we need to add the parameter -ComputerName and the remote machine name.</p>

<p>My question is, why is PowerShell showing two different results when I running the command remotely and locally.</p>

<p>The value that it is showing is actually correct.
I've a list of other servers and use this command within a script to find the disk space details of them. Tomorrow, if another drive becomes inaccessible in one of the servers, this command won't help me find it as it would retrieve its details also.</p>

For example, the point (59,79) is inaccessible because 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30, which is greater than 25. The question is: How many points can the ant access if it starts at (1000, 1000), including (1000, 1000) itself?</em></p>

<p>I implemented my solution in 30 lines of <a href=""http://pastebin.com/EzMt466b"">OCaml first</a>, and tried it out:</p>

<pre><code>$ ocamlopt -unsafe -rectypes -inline 1000 -o puzzle ant.ml
$ time ./puzzle

<p>Neat, my result is the same as that of <a href=""http://leonardo-m.livejournal.com/"">leonardo's implementation, in D and C++</a>. Comparing to leonardo's C++ implementation, the OCaml version runs approx 2 times slower than C++. Which is OK, given that leonardo used a queue to remove recursion.</p>

<p>I then <a href=""http://pastebin.com/0Vx5GTBQ"">translated the code to F#</a> ... and here's what I got:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Stack overflow... with both versions of F# I have in my machine...
Out of curiosity, I then took the generated binary (ant.exe) and run it under Arch Linux/Mono:</p>

<pre><code>$ mono -V | head -1
Mono JIT compiler version 2.10.5 (tarball Fri Sep  9 06:34:36 UTC 2011)

$ time mono ./ant.exe
Points: 148848

real    1m24.298s
user    0m0.567s
sys     0m0.027s
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisingly, it runs under Mono 2.10.5 (i.e. no stack overflow) - but it takes 84 seconds, i.e. 587 times slower than OCaml - oops. </p>

<p>So this program...</p>

<ul>
<li>runs fine under OCaml</li>
<li>doesn't work at all under .NET/F#</li>
<li>works, but is very slow, under Mono/F#.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Weirdness continues - Using ""--optimize+ --checked-"" makes the problem disappear,  <strong>but only under ArchLinux/Mono</strong> ; under Windows XP and Windows 7/64bit, even the optimized version of the binary  stack overflows.</p>

<p><strong>Final EDIT</strong>: I found out the answer myself - see below.</p>

<p>The <code>Paragraph</code>, <code>Run</code>, <code>Section</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Table</code>, and so forth all ""appear in my application"" but since they inherit from <code>System.Windows.ContentElement</code> instead of <code>System.Windows.Controls.Control</code> none of them have a <code>Template</code> property that I can use to redefine the visual tree of the control.</p>

<p>Is there any way to change the visual presentation of these elements?  </p>

The report is rendered correctly in Internet Explorer 9 but in all other browsers I use (FF, Opera, Safari, all pretty much up to date), the matrix is much to slim, only stretching just about over half of the page.<br/><br/>
Without the table right to the matrix, everything is rendered fine in all browsers.<br/>

<p>One of the tests that I wanted to do was to see how to make an Activity where I update a control on the GUI via a BackgroundWorker thread - Specifically, I was interested to see how different the Mono syntax would be compared to a regular Windows Forms (C#) syntax.</p>

<p>To test this out, I created an Android Application (again, in VS2010) targeting API Level 17 (Android 4.2). The general functionality of the app will change the text value of an EditText control from within a _DoWork() BackgroundWorker event handler.</p>

<p>Here's the code..</p>

<pre><code>//Xamarin.Android app
[Activity(Label = ""Cross-thread Test"", MainLauncher = true)]
public class Activity1 : Activity
{
    EditText labelDisplay;
    BackgroundWorker bgWorker;
    int counter = 0;

    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
    {
        base.OnCreate(bundle);

        // Set our view from the ""main"" layout resource
        SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main);

        this.bgWorker = new BackgroundWorker();
        this.bgWorker.WorkerSupportsCancellation = true;
        this.bgWorker.DoWork += new DoWorkEventHandler(bgWorker_DoWork);

        Button buttonStart = FindViewById&lt;Button&gt;(Resource.Id.buttonStart);
        buttonStart.Click += new EventHandler(buttonStart_Click);

        Button buttonStop = FindViewById&lt;Button&gt;(Resource.Id.buttonStop);
        buttonStop.Click += new EventHandler(buttonStop_Click);

        labelDisplay = FindViewById&lt;EditText&gt;(Resource.Id.labelDisplay);
        labelDisplay.Text = ""Click Start"";
    }

    void bgWorker_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
    {
        while (true)
        {
            if (this.bgWorker.CancellationPending)
            {
                RunOnUiThread(() =&gt; labelDisplay.Text = ""Click Start"");
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                counter++;

                            // This causes GREF to increase to 2001
                RunOnUiThread(() =&gt; labelDisplay.Text = counter.ToString());

    {
        if (this.bgWorker != null &amp;&amp; !this.bgWorker.IsBusy)

            this.bgWorker.CancelAsync();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For whatever it's worth, I'm attempting to use the <code>RunOnUiThread()</code> in the similar way that I use <code>Invoke()</code> in a regular <code>Windows Forms</code> like this...</p>

<pre><code>//Regular Windows Forms app
void bgWorker_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    while (true)
    {

        else
        {
            counter++;
            //This isn't possible in a Xamarin.Android app, which is why I'm using RunOnUiThread() instead
            this.Invoke((Action)(() =&gt; { this.labelDisplay.Text = counter.ToString(); }));

<p>I read <a href=""http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/android/troubleshooting"" rel=""nofollow"">Xamarin's Troubleshooting page</a> that states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dalvik's JNI layer only supports a limited number of JNI object
  references to be valid at any given point in time. When this limit is
  exceeded, things break.</p>
  
  <p>The GREF (global reference) limit is 2000 references in the emulator,
  and ~52000 references on hardware.</p>
  
  <p>You know you're starting to create too many GREFs when you see
  messages such as this in the Android Debug Log:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll notice in the error log that my code increased the GREF to 2001. </p>

<p>Based on the troubleshooting notes above, I'm assuming that the <code>RunOnUiThread()</code> is creating a JNI object for each iteration of the while loop. If this is the case, why is this occurring and what should I do to write to the GUI from a different thread safely?</p>

I've tried CorePlot, but it is somewhat lacking in speed. It couldn't even graph 30,000 points with any sort of usable rendering speed (less than 1 fps). s7graphview is somewhat similar to CorePlot but with less features. I put together a simple OpenGL ES project and graphed 1,000,000 points and it rendered at around 10 fps, which is a very usable speed for manipulating a graph. My question is this, are there any purely OpenGL ES based graphing libraries for the iPhone? If not, are there any open source OpenGL based ones I could potentially port to the iPhone? I'd rather not resort to writing my own graphing library unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>Ok, since there aren't any takers, would anyone be willing to work together with me to make an Open Source OpenGL ES graphing library?</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>I've finished my OpenGL graphing library. It can graph 1,400,000 points at 10 fps with multiple lines and multiple scales attached to those lines, with dynamic resizing and it is a self contained control that can be dropped onto any window/view. Much better than CorePlot's 10,000 points at 10 fps.</p>

<p>But in this example the svg was created as a <code>new Image('url.svg')</code> object. When you create an SVG that way, it unfortunately doesn't seem to have a contentDocument to manipulate. It only seems to have one when you create it as an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element. </p>

When video play, It should change with real time. I found libraries to implement image blurr effect, but can't find library to apply blur effect to video with realtime.I use mp4 file for blur effect. I tried to use GPUImage framework, but it doesn't run exactly.
How can implement that?
Please help me.
Thanks.</p>

<p>For example, say I have the header file -- <em>outcome.hpp</em>:</p>

<pre><code>// outcome.hpp
namespace sports { namespace outcome {
  class Injury {};
  class Success {};
}}
</code></pre>

<p>In another header file -- <em>api.hpp</em> -- I wish to use <code>sports::outcome::Injury</code> without having <code>sports::outcome::Success</code> accessible to files that include <em>api.hpp</em>. Is that possible? If so, how can I achieve that?</p>

<p>P.S. In the actual code, <em>api.hpp</em> contains templated methods that would call methods of the <code>Injury</code> class so a forward declaration is not sufficient.</p>

<hr>

<h3>My attempts:</h3>

<p>In my ignorance, I tried to achieve this by placing the <code>include</code> within an internal namespace. Here's a <a href=""http://sscce.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SSCCE</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// api.hpp
namespace sports { namespace api {
  namespace internal {
    #include ""outcome.hpp""  // I'm trying to hide symbols within this header
    using sports::outcome::Injury;
  } 

  class Boxing {
    private:
      internal::Injury sustained;
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>I celebrated prematurely when that worked:</p>

<pre><code>// This cpp file compiles file   \o/
#include ""api.hpp""
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  sports::api::Boxing b;  
  // sports::outcome not accessible
}
</code></pre>

<h3>How it fails:</h3>

<p>Things fall apart if a container from the standard library is used as a class member in <em>outcome.hpp</em>. For example, using this version:</p>

<pre><code>// outcome.hpp
#include &lt;vector&gt;
namespace sports { namespace outcome {

  class Injury {
    private:
      std::vector x;
  };

// ...
}}
</code></pre>

<p>Compilation fails with the following errors:</p>

</p>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, for the purpose of the theorem every ""country"" has to be a simply connected region, or contiguous. [...] Because the territory of [non-contiguous countries] must be the same color, four colors may not be sufficient. (wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, <strong>Is there any four color theorem-like implementation/function available for #D3js so we get neighbors polygons with different coloring ?</strong> (so we don't go to use 20 colors since 4-6 are generally enough)</p>

<p>It works well except in situations where I have chunks that contain strings like <code>""Sauté""</code> because <code>soup = BeautifulSoup(html_chunk)</code> causes Sauté to turn into SautÃ© and this is a problem because I have a huge csv file of recipes like the html_chunk and I'm trying to structure all of them nicely and then get the output back into a database. I tried checking it SautÃ© comes out right using this <a href=""http://www.play-hookey.com/htmltest/"" rel=""nofollow"">html previewer</a> and it still comes out as SautÃ©. I don't know what to do about this.</p>

<p>What's stranger is that when I do what BeautifulSoup's documentation shows</p>

<pre><code>BeautifulSoup(""Sacr&amp;eacute; bleu!"")
# &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Sacré bleu!&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

<pre><code>    butonLista.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() 

        {
            public void onClick(View v){

                spinnerLista.performClick();
            }  
        });

<p>This is the spinner:</p>

<pre><code>   spinnerLista = new Spinner(this);
               public void spinnerLista(){
       adapter = new ArrayAdapter&lt;String&gt;(this, 
             android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, masini);
            adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item);
            spinnerLista.setAdapter(adapter);
            spinnerLista.setOnItemSelectedListener(new listaOnClickListener());
   }
</code></pre>

<p>In the listaOnClickListener i have a log:</p>

<pre><code>        public class listaOnClickListener implements OnItemSelectedListener{
    @Override
    public void onItemSelected(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view, int pos,
            long arg3) {     

        String nrInmat = String.valueOf(spinnerLista.getItemAtPosition(pos));

        txtNrInmat.setText(nrInmat);

    public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>After i click the button, the spinner list pops up, When i click an item from the list the log doesnt appear, the commands i put in the OnClickListener arent called, what can i do?</p>

<p>I finally want to set an EditText to spinnerLista.getItemAtPosition(pos);</p>

<p>So I came up with this:</p>

<p>// global aspx.</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_Start()
{
    // Hook our DI stuff when application starts
    IKernel kernel = SetupDependencyInjection();

    // get the reminder service

    RemindersController.iScheduledReminedrService = scheduledRemindersService;
    RemindersController.StartScheduler();
}
</code></pre>

<p>// Reminder Controller</p>

<pre><code>private static HttpContext httpContext;
public static void StartScheduler()
{
    // needed for action mailer
    httpContext = System.Web.HttpContext.Current;
    iScheduledReminedrService.StartAppointmentRemindersSchedule();
}
</code></pre>

<p>// Scheduler Service</p>

<pre><code>public void StartAppointmentRemindersSchedule()
{
    // get a scheduler and start it.
    IScheduler scheduler = GetScheduler();
    scheduler.Start();

    // setup a job
    JobDetail jobDetail = SetupJob(""AppointmentRemindersJob"", typeof(AppointmentRemindersJob));

    //setup a trigger
    SimpleTrigger trigger = SetupSimpleTrigger(""AppointmentRemindersTrigger"");

    // schedule the job
    scheduler.ScheduleJob(jobDetail, trigger);
}
</code></pre>

<p>//Appointment Job</p>

<pre><code>public void Execute(JobExecutionContext context)
{
    // code above to get CalendarAppointments
    RemindersController.CalendarAppointmentsReminders(calendarAppointments);
}
</code></pre>

<p>//Reminder Controller</p>

<pre><code>[NonAction]
public static void CalendarAppointmentsReminders(List&lt;CalendarAppointment&gt; appointments)
{
    // set it to have a http context so we can send out emails through mvc mailer.
    System.Web.HttpContext.Current = httpContext;

    List&lt;CalendarAppointmentReminderVM&gt; vm = Mapper.Map&lt;List&lt;CalendarAppointment&gt;, List&lt;CalendarAppointmentReminderVM&gt;&gt;(appointments);

    foreach (var v in vm)
    {
        new EmailController().SendCalendarAppointmentNotifiation(v).DeliverAsync();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>// email controller</p>

<pre><code>public EmailResult SendCalendarAppointmentNotifiation(CalendarAppointmentReminderVM vm)
{
    To.Add(vm.To);
    Subject = String.Format(""Hi"");
    return Email(""SendCalendarAppointmentEmail"", vm);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Works perfectly the first time I start up the application and run it. After that it crashes on the 2nd time around</p>

<p>So Here menuBar is added to a scene. if i swap the scene and bring an other scene in front ... What will i do. i think I remove menuBar from this scene and add to other or simply add to new one. so every time i have to do this when i change. Is there any way to avoid this??</p>

For the new feature, no problem. We must to choose who will work on it and after pull updates it will be done smoothly because it will be new files for all developers.  </p>

<p>But one of us lets say programmer-1, will only work on some issues inside the code that already exists. So that means he will make changes in his local git and than push to central repository.</p>

<p>Ok, lets say the programmer-1 spent all day and made 100 small changes around 50 files. He added, committed and pushed to the central repository. After that, the programmer-2 will pull all the changes but he will probably have a message like this:</p>

<pre><code>On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
...
...
</code></pre>

<p>So the programmer-2 needs to spent a lot of time to pass through all 50 files and choose the programmer-1 changes. Same to programmer-3 and 4.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to set git to accept all changes during the  <strong>pulling</strong> process without asking us to decide what change should we stay with? We will accept the programmer-1 changes every time.</p>

Unfortunately, for some reasons, the static library only works with C. For C++, the compiler always complains about linker problems. There are several differences between the current version that I use (2.4.0) with the version of Rick Regan. On the other hand, I also followed the readme.txt inside <code>build.vc10</code> folder, but I still couldn't figure out why it was broken. I'm running Windows 7 x64 and using Visual Studio 2010 - Ultimate.
To be more specific:    </p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, I download the source of MPIR version 2.4.0 from <a href=""http://www.mpir.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpir.org/</a>, i.e. <code>Source tarball bz2</code>.</li>
<li>Next, I download <code>yasm</code> from <a href=""http://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html</a>. I download both <code>Win64.exe</code> and <code>Win64 VS2010.zip</code>, and put both of them into my <code>VC\bin</code> directory. I also renamed the <code>yasm-1.1.0-win64.exe</code> to <code>yasm.exe</code>  </li>
<li>I then open the <code>mpir.sln</code> inside <code>build.vc10</code> folder, and build all the <code>lib</code> projects under <code>release</code> mode since I just want to use static libraries. </li>
</ul>

<p>After building those solutions, it generate a folder named <code>Win32</code>, and inside this folder there is another folder named <code>Release</code> in which there are four other library files:</p>

<ul>
<li>mpir.lib</li>
<li>mpirrxx.lib</li>
<li>mpir.pdb</li>
<li>mpirxx.pdb</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vTnJo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Besides, the <code>lib</code> folder inside <code>build.vc10</code> also generates two other folders:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Win32
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JuDPN.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">  </p></li>
<li><p>x64<br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jt2vv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Next, I copied all the library files from <code>build.vc10\lib</code> to my <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include</code> as well as <code>mpir.h</code> and <code>mpirxx.h</code> to my <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include</code>.<br>
After finish all these steps, I create a Win32 Console Application project, and add two <code>Additional Options</code> under <code>Project Properties\Linker\Command Line\</code>. They are: </p>

<ul>
<li>mpir.lib</li>
<li>mpirxx.lib</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I built some examples with C and it worked as expected. However, when I tried this particular example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

#pragma warning(disable: 4800)
#include &lt;mpirxx.h&gt;
#pragma warning(default: 4800)

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    mpz_class aBigPO2;

    aBigPO2 = 1073741824; //2^30
    aBigPO2*=aBigPO2; //2^60
    aBigPO2*=aBigPO2; //2^120
    aBigPO2*=aBigPO2; //2^240
    aBigPO2*=aBigPO2; //2^480
    aBigPO2*=aBigPO2; //2^960
    aBigPO2*=aBigPO2; //2^1920

    cout &lt;&lt; aBigPO2 &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It failed with many errors:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt;main.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ___gmpz_set_si
1&gt;main.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ___gmpz_init
1&gt;main.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ___gmpz_mul
1&gt;main.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ___gmpz_clear
</code></pre>

<p>And I have no idea why this happened. I even tried to copy other alternatives from <code>Win32</code> folder but it still produced the same errors. But I'm not sure how these files are different though. I'm running Windows 7 x64 but I don't think my Visual Studio is x64. I wonder mixing 32bit and 64bit could cause this issue. Any idea? Thank you.</p>

<p>questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>isn't there an easier way to convert all matching elements to GoogleContacts? then adding each 1 via iteration. also it seems that GoogleContact is not really an XElement as in the debugger it shows up as <code>{&lt;entry....&gt;}</code> instead of <code>&lt;entry....&gt;</code> im not sure what these braces mean here, but its odd</li>
<li>why do i need to declare the namespaces again and again? isn't there a way to somehow pass over to GoogleContact all relevant namespaces? the way its now, Google refuses to accept the data back as all namespaces become ""p1""</li>
</ol>

<p>i'd appreciate any advice on the subject</p>

<p>thank you very much</p>

cvHoughLines or a similar approach (PCA with an outlier remover), but in this case the program is not allowed to make ""false-positive"" errors. If the user draws a line and it's not recognized - it's ok, but if the user draws a curcle and it comes out as a square - it's not ok. So I have an upper bound on the error - but if it's a long line and some of the points have a greater distance from the approximated line, it's ok again. Summed up:</p>

<p>-line detection
-no false positives
-bounded, dynamically adjusting error</p>

<p>Oh, and the points are drawn in sequence, just like hand drawing.</p>

<p>I've come upon another—likely related—symptom.  Using my <code>Foo</code> class with its XmlAdapter applied at the class level with <code>@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(FooAdapter.class)</code>, I have discovered that this adapter will be called on the elements of a field of</p>

<pre><code>/* FooAdapter is called. */
private HashSet&lt;Foo&gt; myFoos;
</code></pre>

<p>as I described below.  However, the adapter is never called if the elements are in nested HashSets such as</p>

<pre><code>/* FooAdapter is NOT called. */
private HashSet&lt;HashSet&lt;Foo&gt;&gt; myFoos;
</code></pre>

<p>or if my Foo objects are used as keys or values in a HashMap like</p>

<pre><code>/* FooAdapter is NOT called. */
private HashMap&lt;Foo, Foo&gt; myFoos;
</code></pre>

<p>I am guessing that this is the same issue whose symptoms I was seeing previously.  Basically, the adapter is not being called when the nested structure is deeper.  </p>

<p><strong>Original Question</strong></p>

<p>Just like the user in this question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/818327/jaxb-how-should-i-marshal-complex-nested-data-structures"">JAXB: How should I marshal complex nested data structures</a>, I need to serialize (and deserialize) several complex nested data structures like</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;Set&lt;Foo&gt;, Bar&gt;
Map&lt;Set&lt;Foo&gt;, Map&lt;Foo, Bar&gt;&gt;
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>However, I have the additional requirement not addressed in that question, which is that my non-collection inner elements need to be marshalled and unmarshalled by XmlAdapters.  </p>

<p><strong>The two adapters: XmlAdapter #1</strong></p>

<p>I have created a number of XmlAdapters to transform nested interface versions of maps and collections into a JAXB serializable form.  (For these approaches, I am indebted to the author of the previously linked question.)  I have working XmlAdapters to handle arbitrarily nested <code>Set</code>s and <code>Map</code>s.  However, as a minimum example to demonstrate the issue I am having, consider the following simple XmlAdapter designed to handle a single non-nested subtype of <code>Collection</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class CollectionAdapter&lt;E&gt; extends XmlAdapter&lt;CollectionAdapter.AdaptedCollection&lt;E&gt;, Collection&lt;E&gt;&gt;
{
    @Override
    public AdaptedCollection&lt;E&gt; marshal(Collection&lt;E&gt; collection) throws Exception
    {
        if (collection == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return new AdaptedCollection&lt;E&gt;(new ArrayList&lt;E&gt;(collection), collection.getClass());
    }


    @Override
    public Collection&lt;E&gt; unmarshal(AdaptedCollection&lt;E&gt; adaptedCollection) throws Exception
    {
        if (adaptedCollection == null) {
            return null;
        }
        @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"")
        Collection&lt;E&gt; result = adaptedCollection.clazz.newInstance();
        for (E element : adaptedCollection.list) {
            result.add(element);
        }
        return result;
    }


    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    //                                                                       //
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 


    @XmlRootElement(name = ""collection"")
    public static class AdaptedCollection&lt;E&gt;
    {
        public List&lt;E&gt; list;
        public Class&lt;? extends Collection&gt; clazz;


        public AdaptedCollection() {}


        public AdaptedCollection(List&lt;E&gt; list, Class&lt;? extends Collection&gt; clazz) {
            this.list = list;
            this.clazz = clazz;
        }
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>XmlAdapter #2</strong></p>

<p>Now consider one of my object types that I am storing in these nested collections.  In my code, I have a set of <code>Foo</code> objects.  The class <code>Foo</code> uses its own <strong>XmlAdapter</strong> which looks like</p>

<pre><code>public class FooAdapter extends XmlAdapter&lt;FooAdapter.AdaptedFoo, Foo&gt; 
{
    ...

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    //                                                                       //
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 


    @XmlRootElement(name = ""adapted-foo"")
    public static class AdaptedFoo
    {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This adapter is applied to <code>Foo</code> at the class level</p>

<pre><code>@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(FooAdapter.class)
public class Foo {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>I cannot seem to get these two adapters to work in conjunction, even though each will work individually.  </p>

<p>For example, if I use a concrete collection type (therebye eliminating my need for my CollectionAdapter), I can successfully marshal and unmarshal my set of <code>Foo</code>s.  The following code works fine</p>

<pre><code>private HashSet&lt;Foo&gt; myFoos;
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if I use an element type which doesn't require an adapter, I can do that as well.  For example, the field</p>

<pre><code>@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(CollectionAdapter.class)
private Set&lt;String&gt; myStrings;
</code></pre>

<p>will marshal and unmarshal without incident.</p>

<p>However, when I combine the two, by putting my <code>Foo</code> objects in a <code>Set</code> and applying the <code>CollectionAdapter</code> to that <code>Set</code>, I find that my <code>FooAdapter</code> is never called.  I suspect that this has something to do with moving the objects to to a new data structure.  Perhaps they are then treated as root elements (and thus don't have their adapter called)?</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate any insight on why this might be the case, and/or how to get around it with a different approach to serializing arbitrary nested data-structures while still applying my adapter to the inner elements.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

An example of code is posted <a href=""http://pastebin.com/15g5jcjg"" rel=""nofollow"">on pastebin</a> to avoid cluttering this post. In short, I define a few routes, decorating some so that they can be accessed only by users with the proper role, then try to access them in a test.</p>

<p>In the code pasted, the <code>test_member</code> and <code>test_admin_b</code> both fail, complaining about a <code>PermissionDenied</code>. Obviously, I'm failing to declare the user properly; at least, the info about the user roles is not in the right context.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>String insertion/extraction operators (&lt;&lt; and >>) need to be overloaded within the MyString object. These operators will also need to be capable of cascaded operations (i.e., cout &lt;&lt; String1 &lt;&lt; String2 or cin >> String1 >> String2). The string insertion operator (>>) will read an entire line of characters that is either terminated by an end-of-line character (\n) or 256 characters long. An input line that exceeds 256 characters will be limited to only the first 256 characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that, this is the code I've gotten thus far:</p>

<p>in my .cpp file:</p>

<pre><code> istream&amp; MyString::operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp; input, MyString&amp; rhs)
{

    char* temp;
    int size(256);
    temp = new char[size];
    input.get(temp,size);
    rhs = MyString(temp);
    delete [] temp;

    return input;

 }
</code></pre>

<p>in my .h file:</p>

<p>istream&amp; operator>>(istream&amp; input, MyString&amp; rhs);</p>

<p>call from main.cpp file:</p>

<pre><code>   MyString String1;
  const MyString ConstString(""Target string"");          //Test of alternate constructor
  MyString SearchString;        //Test of default constructor that should set ""Hello World""
  MyString TargetString (String1); //Test of copy constructor

  cout &lt;&lt; ""Please enter two strings. "";
  cout &lt;&lt; ""Each string needs to be shorter than 256 characters or terminated by
  /.\n"" &lt;&lt; endl;
 cout &lt;&lt; ""The first string will be searched to see whether it contains exactly the second string. "" &lt;&lt; endl;


 cin &gt;&gt; SearchString &gt;&gt; TargetString; // Test of cascaded string-extraction operator&lt;&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>The error that I get is: istream&amp; MyString::operator>>(std::istream&amp;, MyString&amp;)â must take exactly one argument</p>

<p>How can I correct this? I am super confused on how to do this without BOTH the rhs and input</p>

<p>Whenever I attach the debugger to either app I learn nothing useful. The UI thread is blocked in the frozen app on the Application.Run method. All other threads are either sleeping, or blocked on Invokes onto the UI thread. </p>

<p>Also mysteriously another running application like Photoshop will behave strangely whilst this deadlock is in place. Quitting the tray app sorts this too.</p>

<p>All I can deduce is that something is going wrong with the main Windows-level message pump, but I don't really understand how I can debug further into this. I've installed the framework source code and can see the deadlocked app is stuck in a while loop in  :    </p>

<p><em>Application.UnsafeNativeMethods.IMsoComponentManager.FPushMessageLoop</em></p>

<p>but don't really understand enough to do anything with this information.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice at all on where to look further? I've been chasing this random deadlock bug for months.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, but I didn't found any information which types of PDF the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1630/_index.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>UIWebView</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Reference/QLPreviewController_Class/index.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>QLPreviewController</code></a> support.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Now I created a Word 2007 document with a single text line and saved it as normal PDF (with Adobe Plugin). Then I openend the PDF and converted it to the different available standards with the Preflight tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>PDF/A-1a</li>
<li>PDF/A-1b</li>
<li>PDF/A-2a</li>
<li>PDF/A-2b</li>
<li>PDF/A-2u</li>
</ul>

<p>I also checked if it is really supporting this standard with the Preflight tool. Then I displayed the PDF/A on my <code>UIWebView</code> and the text got displayed and I didn't get an error in the console.</p>

<p>Then I got it managed to get access to the problematic PDF and I also checked it with the Preflight tool. The summary for PDF/A-1a and PDF/A-1b was:</p>

<ul>
<li>File header is not compatible with PDF/A</li>
<li>Syntax problem: PDF file contains data after end of file</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn't meet any of the standards available in the Preflight tool. So yes iOS does support PDF/A, but you have to check if your PDF is valid.</p>

Although the slider works and also the sticky sidebar there is a small bug which is only present if the slider and the sticky sidebar are used on the same page.
I notice when I scroll to the bottom of my page, some elements of the sidebar start moving behind eachother. 
This issue is fixed if I remove the u=""slides"" from the html. But obviously that is not a solution as than the slider no longer works.</p>

<p>So, I have been going through the scripts and found 2 lines in jssor.slider.js: </p>

<pre><code>Line 2733: var _SlidesContainer = $Jssor$.$FindChild(elmt, ""slides"", _UISearchNoDeep); 
Line 3639: _SlidesContainer = $Jssor$.$FindChild(elmt, ""slides"", false);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course ""slides"" is also present in my html: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div u=""slides"" style=""cursor: move; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 530px; height: 300px; overflow: hidden;""&gt;

         &lt;div&gt;&lt;a u=""image"" href=""{PAGE_ROW_URL}""&gt;&lt;img src=""{PAGE_ROW_MYSITE_LARGE_PAVATAR}"" width=""530"" height=""300"" title=""{PAGE_ROW_CATDESC}"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
         &lt;div u=""thumb""&gt; 
              &lt;img class=""i"" src=""{PAGE_ROW_MYSITE_THUMB_PAVATAR}""&gt; 
                  &lt;div class=""t""&gt;{PAGE_ROW_SHORTTITLE}&lt;/div&gt; 
                  &lt;div class=""c""&gt;&lt;a href=""{PAGE_ROW_CATURL}""&gt;{PAGE_ROW_CATTITLE}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
         &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;!-- END: PAGE_ROW --&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, I checked the theia-sticky-sidebar.js to see if any values from lines 2733 and 3639 match, which could cause a conflict, but as far as I can tell there is nothing which is the same causing a conflict. So, I decided to post here and see if you have maybe an idea how I can solve this?</p>

<p>The sticky sidebar works without issues on pages of the website where the slider is not used. </p>

<p>Now, this works... Kinda.</p>

<p>If I view this file directly in a browser (local AMPSS server), it shows the image. But, it takes a long time to display/server (5+ seconds) compared to a similar 1k PNG image. And Chrome console says it failed (although I can see the image)</p>

<p><strong>I think the browser is expecting something else that I'm not sending?</strong></p>

<p>The real problem materialized when I use this image in JQuery and the OnLoad event. Things then became ...strange... for want of a better word. I appear to have events (not mine) fire that clear the image many seconds after it has been loaded &amp; displayed. </p>

<p>The Chrome Console says that the GET fails when retrieving the image (although it does display the image, at least until something in JS makes it vanish again!)</p>

<p>Interestingly, this issue doesn't seem to appear in latest Firefox.
The loading time is exaggerated in the latest Opera, but the JS doesn't glitch the image. The same in IE8</p>

<p>To confuse things even more, I have two Windows XP (32-bit) dev machines. The JS glitching doesn't happen on one of the them. And Chrome Console doesn't list any faults!</p>

<p>I've put a demo on the image file online here: <a href=""http://thebucketchallenge.com/debug.py"" rel=""nofollow"">LINKY</a>
And my in development page that uses this file here: <a href=""http://thebucketchallenge.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">LINKY</a>
The Jquery/JS will activate if you click around the white  image-holders.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this will work on your setup or not. I'm just linking here for completeness.</p>

<p>Any ideas on what I'm missing?</p>

It will contain a catalog with goods, which are divided into a few categories. The idea is to have a way to add additional fields, specific for each category, and these fields should be fillable for each good in a category.</p>

<p>For example, if I have a category 'wallpapers', they should have additional fields 'color', 'footage', 'facture' etc. An of course these fields must be filled differently for each wallpaper item.</p>

<p>I created a database with 4 tables for it: <em>items</em> (which contains items, obviously), <em>items_categories</em> (with categories for therm), <em>items_fields</em> (contains additional fields) and <em>items_fields_values</em> (a support table for many-to-many relationship which also contains a values of related fields).</p>

<p><a href=""http://rghost.net/8K2lt2PCB/image.png"" rel=""nofollow"">My database schema diagram</a> <em>(you need to have at least 10 reputation to attach images)</em>.</p>

<p>I'm using Yii Framework, and relationships in models described in a such way:</p>

<p>Item model:</p>

<pre><code>return array(
        'category' =&gt; array(self::BELONGS_TO, 'ItemCategory', 'category_id'),
        'fields' =&gt; array(self::MANY_MANY, 'ItemField', 'items_fields_values(item_id, field_id)'),
    );
</code></pre>

<p>ItemField model:</p>

<pre><code>return array(
            'itemCategory' =&gt; array(self::BELONGS_TO, 'ItemCategory', 'item_category_id'),
            'items' =&gt; array(self::MANY_MANY, 'Item', 'items_fields_values(field_id, item_id)'),
        );
</code></pre>

<p>ItemCategory model:</p>

<pre><code>return array(
            'items' =&gt; array(self::HAS_MANY, 'Item', 'category_id'),
            'itemsFields' =&gt; array(self::HAS_MANY, 'ItemField', 'item_category_id'),
        );

<p>How should I define these relationships to have a way to output, add and edit fields to category and their values to specific items?</p>

my character seems to jump one time.. and then gets stuck a short distance above the ground</p>

<p>This is the function where i load my platforms from txt (by calling setupworld)
in my txt i define xstart (where the platform starts) xend (end of platform) ystart (bottom of platform) 2 unnused variables and the texture filter (0-4 atm)</p>

<p>each platform is then created by repeating 2x2 tiles in x direction
numblocks= number of platforms (sry for the bad variable name ^^)
number of blocks is calculated by taking the end coordinate of the platform - start coordinate and dividing by 2.0 (my platforms always have coordinates dividable by 2.. like.. 0 - 16.. or.. 8 - 16.. )</p>

<p>as u see.. the structure block is where all the data is saved to in setupworld() and it has nothing to do with the number of tiles displayed.. sry again for my weird names</p>

<p>THANKS :)
well i just edited the code for x movement and collision.. so it works properly.. (despite the flickering (but idc atm :) ).. i'm wondering why jumping doesn't work at all anymore.. it's just increasing till i'm stuck.. can't even get up once anymore :/
i put my detectCollision() in front of they key section.. which works for x AND y now (hopefully)..
 and i also edited something in DetectCollision()
i had ystart+0.2 instead of ystart+2.0 which is the correct coordinate for the platforms top</p>

<p>but looks like it just got worse at y
i'm still totally confused..</p>

<p>oh and talking about those predefined api's and stuff.. since somebody first showed me some things with glut i tried to make the next step and initialize everything myself.. i guess detection is much easier using predefined stuff.. but i want to learn it and not just get one game to work :)
if u have any more suggestions for my code i would be really grateful.. and if u know any good books for starters till advanced lvl i would really appreciate</p>

<p>and yes.. i know.. display lists are deprecated since opengl 3.0 ^^</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> a stackoverflow member and his/her stackoverflow user account categorized as a composition relationship or an aggregation relationship? At first I thought it was an association because this member ""has a"" account. However on second thought, I am thinking its composition because each ""part"" (user account) belongs to only one whole (user) at a time, meaning for as long as I am logged into stackoverflow, I have to use this one and only account until I log off. If I log back onto stackoverflow with a different account then its composition again. Do you agree?</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> a database and a person's user account an aggregation relationship? I think so because 1 database (the whole) can store 0...* number of user accounts (the parts) but another database can store the same user accounts.</p>

My feeling is that it is very hard to get a feel for how all the CSS will work together and indeed what CSS is affecting parent and sibling elements in the HTML.</p>

<p>So, my question is ""what are the best-practices around re-skinning an existing web-site by replacing the CSS only and not modifying the existing HTML?"" I can't change the classes, ids, node hierarchy, etc.</p>

<p>An example of the particular site that I am trying to re-skin is <a href=""http://demo.nopcommerce.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.nopcommerce.com/</a>.</p>

<p>The existing CSS can be as complicated/detailed as this extract from the main CSS file:</p>

See, I've used a lot of Linux command-line utilities. And there are some obvious patterns; '-' precedes a single letter for short options, multiple options that don't take arguments can be combined, '--' precedes long versions of options, and so on.</p>

<p>However, in some cases, capitalization is used to <em>invert</em> an option. So, '-d' might mean to run as a daemon, but '-D' would be to <em>not</em> run as a daemon. (Why not just omit the option if you don't want it? That's never been clear, but it's actually rather common, so I figure there must be some reason.) But in some programs, a capital is a completely unrelated option; if '-d' is run as daemon, '-D' might be to enable debug mode. Is there some kind of overarching principal behind this, and which is the best to choose? Or are we just dealing with ""whatever works""?</p>

<p>There are also some commands that, in addition to (or instead of) options with arguments, just take lone arguments. cp is a good example of this; aside from a couple rarely used toggles, the last argument it receives is presumed to be the destination, and any arguments between the option list and the destination are presumed to be sources. Is there a rule of thumb when it's ""okay"" to rely on order like that, instead of using explicit option flags with arguments?</p>

<p>I'd recently taken images for an important experiment using MicroManager (a recent version, though I cannot recall the exact number). The IT services at my institution have recently been having some networking problems and my saved preferences for the software had been erased. I'd got half way through my experiment when I realised that I'd saved my images as separate image files (three greyscale TIFFs plus metadata text files) instead of OME-TIFF iamge stacks.</p>

<p>All of my ImageJ macros for image processing rely on having a multiple channel image stack, so this is a bit of a problem. Is there any easy way in MicroManager (or ImageJ) to bulk convert these single channel greyscale images into the OME-TIFF image stack after the images have already been taken?</p>

<p><strong>Content Converter Binding:</strong><br>
The items in the ListBox need to be passed to a converter that converts the items to a text format.</p>

<p><strong>Display items in a way that lets users select and copy text from ListBox items</strong><br>
I need the text of each ListBox item to be selectable. Users want to use their mouse to drag-to-select parts of the elements so they can copy the text to their clipboard.</p>

<p>I implemented [this copy/paste solution][1] but it does not let a user select parts of the ListBox item text, rather it supports copying the entire text.</p>

<p>I'm able to create a ListBox using the converter, but I can not figure out how to put the converted text into a control that lets users select the displayed text. Here is what I have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox Name=""FinishedTestErrorsListBox""
         FontSize=""12""
         ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=SelectedComparisonResult.TestFailItems}""&gt;

    &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;ContentControl Content=""{Binding Converter={StaticResource testFailItemConverter}}""/&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
&lt;/ListBox&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried adding a TextBox to the DataTemplate as shown below... </p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Converter={StaticResource testFailItemConverter}}""/&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>... but this creates a runtime error caused by sending the wrong type of object to the converter. I know here I'm not setting up the converter binding properly, though I don't have a good grasp on how I should setup the binding here or why this causes errors.   </p>

<p>So, my question is:</p>

<p><strong>What content container can I use to let users select text from the individual ListBox items?</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for any help,<br>
Charlie</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Here's the converter code...  </p>

<pre><code>public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
{
     ITestFailItem i = (ITestFailItem)value;
     return i.Itemize();
}  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>The following runtime error is throw when the ListBox is first initialized:</p>

<pre><code>An unhandled exception of type 'System.Windows.Markup.XamlParseException' occurred in PresentationFramework.dll 

Additional information: Provide value on 'System.Windows.Baml2006.TypeConverterMarkupExtension' threw an exception
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>The culprit is a line of code I'd omitted from the original snippet as I thought it was irrelevant - I've learned a good lesson along the way!</p>

<p><strong>Extension Question</strong></p>

<p>Why does the following snippet cause an error? How can I achieve the desired affect of making the textbox span the entire containing grid?</p>

The data, however, is horizontal (and has to be kept that way), so I need to use the Cells() function to select the data for the chart.</p>

<p>However, it doesn't seem to be working, and I can't really find out why. I keep getting the error ""Application-Defined or Object-Defined error"" on any line that uses the Cells() function to define a range. However, if Cells() is used to reference a single cell, it works fine.</p>

<p>Can Range(Cells(x, y), Cells(z, w)) not be used in this case?</p>

The short version of the question is: Is it possible to generate a long, deterministic and non-uniformly distributed string/sequence of numbers from a small seed?</p>

<p>Long(er) version: I was thinking to encrypt a text by changing encoding. The new encoding would be generated via Huffman algorithm. To work well, the Huffman algorithm would need a fairly long text with non uniform distribution. Then characters can have different bit-lengths which would be the primary strength of this encryption. The problem is that its impractical to enter in/remember a long text each time you want to decrypt the text. So I was wondering if it was possible to generate a text from password seed?</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what the text is, as long as it has non uniform distribution of characters and that the exact same sequence can be recreated each time you give it the same seed. Preferably, are there any functions/extensions in Python that can do this?</p>

<p>EDIT:
To expand on the ""strength"" of varying bit length:
if I have a string ""test"", ASCII values 116, 101, 115, 116, which gives bit values of 
1110100 1100101 1110011 1110100</p>

<p>Then, say my Huffman algorithm generates encoding like 
    t = 101
    e = 1100111
    s = 10001</p>

<p>The final string is
101 1100111 10001 101, if we encode this back to ASCII, we get 1011100 1111000 1101000, which is 3 entirely different characters, its ""\xh"". Obviously its impossible to perform any kind of frequency analysis or something like that on this.</p>

<p>looking if it is possible to use the return value of one helper as a parameter to another directly in dust.js (<a href=""https://github.com/linkedin"" rel=""nofollow"">linkedin's</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/akdubya/dustjs"" rel=""nofollow"">original flavor</a>) e.g.</p>

<pre><code>you have {@math key=""{@size key=list/}"" method=""add"" operand=""4""/} new messages
</code></pre>

<p>assuming that <code>@size</code> will return some scalar value like <code>3</code> if list is:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""list"": [""msg1"", ""msg2"", ""msg3""]
}
</code></pre>

<p>so far it seems to not be possible, getting an <code>SyntaxError: Expected buffer, comment, end of input, partial, raw, reference, section or special but ""{"" found. At line : 1, column : 10</code> error.</p>

<p>i assume that i can create/use a helper that could set a value in the context from the return value of the first <code>size</code> helper and then reuse that value (in essence a temporary variable) in the second <code>math</code> helper.  for example, this <a href=""https://github.com/rragan/dust-motes/tree/master/src/helpers/data/provide"" rel=""nofollow"">provide helper</a> seems to do just that:</p>

<pre><code>{@provide}
  {@math key=len method=""add"" operand=""4""/}
{:len}
  {@size key=list/}
{/provide}
</code></pre>

<p>however, i was hoping to avoid these extra steps with something like subexpressions supported Handlebars: see section on Subexpressions <a href=""http://handlebarsjs.com/expressions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">on this page</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/pull/690"" rel=""nofollow"">this pull request which added the feature</a>.  subexpressions allow the one helper to be embedded as a parameter value of the second helper, as i have illustrated in my first example.</p>

<p>perhaps i am missing a more <em>dust-way</em> to handle this?  thus any pointers appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>class sort_of_vector
{
   // Some data here. Much data.
   size_t size;

   double property1(unsigned int index)
   {
      // Do some computation on the index and data.
   }

   double property2(unsigned int index)
   {
      // Do some computation on the index and data.
   }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>sort_of_vector</code> is, indeed, a sort of vector, or <em>looks</em> like it is some sort of vector. It represents a collection of numbered elements, each of which has two (say double) properties. As you can see, those properties are however accessible only through getter methods, because some complicated computation needs to be carried out before returning the actual value.</p>

<p>Now, what I would like to do is to make <code>sort_of_vector</code> more similar, in terms of interfaces, to an actual vector. I would like a <code>[] operator</code> to be callable on that, so I could then call a getter for <code>property1</code> and <code>property2</code> on something returned via the <code>[] operator</code>.</p>

<p>There is a trivial way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>class sort_of_vector
{
   // Same as before

   sort_of_vector_proxy operator [] (unsigned int index)
   {
      return sort_of_vector_proxy(this, index);
   }
};

class sort_of_vector_proxy
{
   sort_of_vector * vector;
   unsigned int index;

   sort_of_vector_proxy(sort_of_vector * vector, unsigned int index)
   {
      this-&gt;vector = vector;
      this-&gt;index = index;
   }

   double property1()
   {
      return this-&gt;vector-&gt;property1(this-&gt;index);
   }

   double property2()
   {
      return this-&gt;vector-&gt;property1(this-&gt;index);
   }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously works, but it has some issues in terms of performance. In principle, accessing the <code>property1</code> or <code>property2</code> of some item would mean make a whole new <code>sort_of_vector_proxy</code> set its properties, call the actual getter through it and delete it.</p>

<p>So I was wondering if there were more performing solutions that can make my <code>sort_of_vector</code> more similar to a vector in this kind of fashion (<code>my_sort_of_vector[33].property1()</code>) but without having any performance downside.</p>

But I found that my tool did not work correctly on enum declaration node which appeared in Java code. In my AST which created by jdt, keyword enum was regarded as a typename  instead of an enum declaration. So I want to know how I should be can ensure that my tool can deal the enum declaration correctly.</p>

<p>The jdt package that I used is ""org.eclipse.jdt.core_3.8.3.v20130121-145325.jar"".
The createAST code is:</p>

<pre><code>char[] javaprogram=getJavaFile(javaFileName);
ASTParser parser = ASTParser.newParser(AST.JLS4);
parser.setSource(javaprogram);
parser.setKind(ASTParser.K_COMPILATION_UNIT);
final CompilationUnit cu = (CompilationUnit) parser.createAST(null);
</code></pre>

<p>the java input is like below:</p>

<pre><code>package test;

enum Color
{
  RED(255, 0, 0),  BLUE(0, 0, 255),  BLACK(0, 0, 0),    YELLOW(255, 255, 0),  GREEN(0, 255, 0);

  private int redValue;
  private int greenValue;
  private int blueValue;

  private Color(int rv, int gv, int bv)
  {
    this.redValue = rv;
    this.greenValue = gv;
    this.blueValue = bv;
  }

  public String toString()
  {
    return super.toString() + ""("" + this.redValue + "","" + this.greenValue + "","" + this.blueValue + "")"";
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But using astparser.createAST() to get CompilationUnit node just got the code which is just contained the package code:</p>

<pre><code>package test;

<p>The problem is solved by adding the CompilerOptions which code is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>Map options = JavaCore.getOptions();

I know there are severals question/asnwsers on this subject, and believe me I read a lot of them, even some about python import.</p>

<p>Here is my project tree (i'll put real folders name):</p>

<pre><code>was/ # full path from my computer /home/user/project/was
....was/ #django project created by django-admin startproject 'was'
    ....manage.py
    ....artists/ #first app
        ....migrations/
        ....templates/
        ....__init__.py 
        ....other_python_files.py
    ....crew/ #second app    
        ....migrations/
        ....templates/
        ....__init__.py
        ....some_files.py
    ....was/ # folder containing settings.py, main urls.py
        ....__init__.py
</code></pre>

<p>My first was project (/home/user/project/was) contains the virtualenv generates folders (python3.4).</p>

<p>I checked on my python path <code>sys.path</code> and my project structure in Pycharm and there is /home/user/project/was.</p>

<p>When I do this in PyCharm, I have the autocompletion working fine :</p>

<pre><code>from ..crew.models import MyClass #here i'm in a artists app file
</code></pre>

<p>But I get an <code>ValueError :attempted relative import beyond top-level package when import app</code></p>

<p>And now, same scenario, importing a crew class in artists app but :</p>

<pre><code>from was.crew.models import MyClass
</code></pre>

<p>Autocompletion works fine in pycharm but this time I got the classic ImportError : <code>no name was.crew</code>.</p>

<p>I find a solution doing it by adding this line in my settings.py :</p>

<pre><code>BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(BASE_DIR)) # add this line
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>BASE_DIR</code> already exist in settings.
And now I can do this :</p>

<pre><code>from crew.models import MyClass
</code></pre>

<p>And here I got no error (change some settings in Pycharm to have the autocompletion works).</p>

<p>This works, but I really wonder why I have to add this line and why my two first attempt don't work.</p>

<p>I'm a bit lost with package, pythonpath etc (that's why I specified in my schema all <code>__init__.py</code> files).</p>

<p>Shouldn't <code>from ..anotherapp.models import Class</code> works fine without pimping anything in settings.py ?</p>

<p>Whatever, should I keep my solution or is it not a good thing? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any response.</p>

<p>So, here is the problem. Client will make a request. Json is in use for sending objects and validating against the schema. The request MUST HAVE it's name and MAY contain args. Args are like associative array (key => value).</p>

<p>Server will give a response. Response MAY contain args, objects, array of objects. For example, client sends a request like:</p>

<pre><code>    {
    ""name"": ""AuthenticationRequest"",
    ""username"": ""root"",
    ""password"": ""password"",
    ""etc"": ""etc""
    }
</code></pre>

<p>For this, server will reply with an AuthSuccess or AuthFailed response like:</p>

<pre><code>    {
    ""name"": ""AuthFailed"",
    ""args"": [
        {
        ""reason"": ""Reason text""
        }]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If response is AuthSuccess, client will send a requst of who is online. Server must send an array of users. </p>

<p>And so on. So the problem is, how to store those responses on a client side. I mean, the way of creating a new object for each response type is insane. They will be hundreds of request types, and each of them requires it's own response. And any changing in structure of request will be very very hard...</p>

<p>Need some kind of pattern or trick. I know it's kind of a noob way... But if anyone has a better idea of implementing request/response structure, please tell it.</p>

Is it posible to do it? to deactivate collisions of a physic body without deactivating its capabilities to detect collisions?? Sounds a bit contradictory I know... Because, the other way would be to create only a SKSpriteNode without physic body, then there wouldn't being collisions,  but the way to ""detect"" collisions would be hand made and much more harder, because i would need to set a coordinate system detection in my hero, that when he will be in those specifics coordinates (over the item) then i'll make the item disappears.

<p>Unfortunately this inner double sum is fairly slow, and is causing the running time to spiral out of control on large datasets.  Right now I'm just using for loops to do this.  Is there some pythonic way to speed up this inner operation?  I have been trying to think one up and having no luck.</p>

<p>To clarify, for each of the <code>n</code> examples, there's a matrix <code>Xi</code> with dimensions <code>ai x b</code> where <code>ai</code> is different for each example.  For each pair <code>(Xi, Xj)</code> I want to go through all the <code>O(ai * bi)</code> pairs of rows between the two matrices and find <code>Xiu - Xjv</code>, take the outer product of that with itself <code>np.outer(Xiu - Xjv, Xiu - Xjv)</code>, and finally sum all those outer products.</p>

<p>For instance:  Suppose D is <code>[[1,2],[3,4]]</code> and we're just working with that for both matrices.</p>

<p>Then i.e. one step might be <code>np.outer(D[0] - D[1], D[0] - D[1])</code> which would be the matrix <code>[4,4],[4,4]</code>.</p>

<p>Simply enough, (0,0) and (1,1) are just 0 matrices, and (0,1) and (1,0) are both 4 matrices, so the final sum of all four outer products of pairs would be <code>[[8,8],[8,8]]</code>.</p>

The two fields i am concerned with our two image uploaders that i have in the form.  I have been doing this successfully when i have only one image uploader on the page, but can't wrap my head around the conditional syntax when i add the second one.  Below is the code that i am using for the forms that have only one image uploader.  It looks to see if that submitted element is empty.  If so, it runs an update statement and leaves out the image variable.  If the image variable is not empty it runs an update statement with that field added to the statement.</p>

<p>How would i write my update statement to include another image field.  The variable would be <code>$imgProfileThumb</code>.  Basically i want to update the two image columns in the database if, and only if, they are NOT empty.  This is because the way the form is built, the image field is technically always empty unless an image actually gets uploaded.  Any thoughts?  Thanks!!</p>

<pre><code>$squery = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM wp_postmeta WHERE wp_postmeta.post_id AND wp_postmeta.meta_key = 'state'"");
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my output:</p>

  &lt;option value=""&lt;?php if(isset( $state_name['meta_value'] )) { echo state_name['meta_value']; } ?&gt;""&gt;

<p>Under General Settings for my project, I have only Landscape Left checked for Orientation.  The app is an iPad only app, using MainWindow.xib and no storyboards.  All the ViewControllers are inside the MainWindow.xib, none of the classes have their own .xib file.  When I AirPlay it or use the Simulator External Display, the iPad and External Display screens look like this:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rq8gF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FUlfX.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
As you can see, it appears that the External Display mirroring works, as it shows the same color purple the navigation bar has, but maybe orientation is just wrong?  I don't allow autorotation in any view controllers, and haven't changed any settings.  What am I doing wrong?</p>

For this it makes sense to have an overloaded array <code>[]</code> operator, but I don't want to have any branching since the particular specification of the struct allows for a theoretical workaround. </p>

<p>Currently, the struct looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct f32x4
{
    float fLow[2];
    float fHigh[2];

    f32x4(float a, float b, float c, float d)
    {
        fLow[0] = a; 
        fLow[1] = b;
        fHigh[0] = c;
        fHigh[1] = d;
    }

    // template with an int here?
    inline float&amp; operator[] (int x) {
        if (x &lt; 2)
            return fLow[x];
        else
            return fHigh[x - 2];
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>What could I/should I do to avoid the branch? My idea is to use a template with an integer parameter and define specializations, but it's not clear whether it does make sense and what the syntax of that monster could look like.</p>

<p>I explicitly, under no circumstances, can make use of a <code>float[4]</code> array to merge the two (also, no union tricks). If you need a good reason for that, it's because the <code>float[2]</code> are actually resembling a platform specific PowerPC paired singles. A normal windows compiler won't work with paired singles, that's why I replaced the code with <code>float[2]</code>s.</p>

<p>Using the GreenHills compiler I get this assembly output (which suggests branching does occur):</p>

<p>My idea is to communicate with an Atmega uC later on, but first I wanted to test the serial communication by setting up a virtual serial bridge with the help of soccat and controlling the output serial port with gtkterm. The problem is that I'm just receiving useless things in gtkterm... (see screenshots)</p>

<p>soccat command:</p>

<pre><code>socat -d -d PTY: PTY:
</code></pre>

<p>The soccat virtual serial port bridge seems to be ok, because I can send data from one serial terminal to another...</p>

<p>gtkterm port preferences:</p>

<pre><code>Port: /dev/pts/6
Baudrate: 9600
Parity: none
Bits: 8
Stopbits: 1
Flow control: none
</code></pre>

<p>My little GUI compiles and runs fine, with the input path ""/dev/pts/6"" and the input baudrate 9600. The programm seems to run fine, but in gtkterm are just question marks and quadangles with symbols in every corner coming up. Let's say its not interpretable and independent by the signs as input, BUT the lengths of the output in gtkterm changes by the length of the input (the amount of signs I type in).</p>

<p>I made an applet that views data from tables in a MySQL database and lets just say it outputs it. It's a lot more complicated than that but the point is that the applet runs perfectly in Eclipse when I run it. I had to set the MySQL-connector-java-5.1.15-bin.jar file as an external library for it, but after doing that it runs perfectly.</p>

<p>The problem is whenever I put the code on my Xampp server, it doesn't work right. The applet start and everything works until the applet tries to connect to the MySQL database (Xampp) using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>String connectionURL = ""jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/"";  
Connection connection = null;  
 try{  
 connection = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionURL, ""root"", ""mypassword"");  
}catch(Exception e){  
  System.out.println(""Error: ""+e);   
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the applet I didn't use System.out.println(), but I did manage to find out the I was getting was:</p>

<pre><code>java.SQL.Exception: No suitable driver found on jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/
</code></pre>

<p>I'm wondering what I need to do to get around this error. Where do I need to put the .jar connector or how do I need to configure it with my Xampp server to get this to work? </p>

<p>EDIT: To me it seems that the Controller is not even loaded ever. If I put garbage in that controller nothing happens, still the same 404 error</p>

<p>**EDIT 2:**I believe it has to do with my webserver 2.4 and php-fpm. I am using a fresh install of arch linux, which has apache 2.4. With this version of apache, php needs to be loaded (as an option) with php-fpm via fcgi. So I have a ProxyPassMatch ^/(.<em>.php(/.</em>)?)$ fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000/var/www/html/$1 rule. Maybe this is conflicting with the rest api controller? Because how will the /usuarios URL be routed to the symfony framework...</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.*;

class WeirdJava
{
    public static void main (String[] args) 
    {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        String input = br.readLine();
        HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer,Integer&gt;();
        System.out.println(""Weird Java"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that in the above program, there are two errors:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have not handled exceptions which might be thrown by <code>BufferedReader</code>.</li>
<li>I have not imported standard <code>util</code> library which contains <code>HashMap</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, when I try to compile the above program, the java compiler gives the error that it cannot find symbol <code>HashMap</code>. Note that the declaration involving <code>HashMap</code> comes after <code>BufferedReader</code>. Next, I add the following import statement to the program:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.HashMap;
</code></pre>

<p>When I compile the program again, this time the compiler shows error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unreported exception IOException; must be caught or declared to be
  thrown</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why is this error not thrown in the previous compilation attempt? </li>
<li>The order in which compilation error comes does not seem natural. What are the compiler design principles which come into play during this routine? </li>

<p>However, the line: <code>img = UIImage(data: data</code>) which references the img variable directly gets updated.</p>

<ol>
<li>I am using <strong>Facebooks API</strong> to retrieve pictures from a specific Album.</li>
<li>Using <strong>JCarousel</strong> (<a href=""http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/</a>), I would like to <strong>dynamically add the pictures</strong> from Facebook into the Carousel.</li>
<li>The problem is, that because the <strong>Facebook API is Asynchronous</strong>, the portion of code which executes the Carousel requires information (picture URLs) which is not yet available.</li>
</ol>

<p>A workaround of some sort is to use an <strong>alert box</strong> to force a delay, this allows the Facebook API query to ""<strong>catch up</strong>"" when you confirm the alert, lo and behold, the images appear inside the carousel!</p>

<p>Is there anyway at all to solve this isuse. After research, I have seen similair problems addressed using a ""<strong>Callback</strong>"" function.</p>

<p>I am a rank novice with coding, so any help would be hugely appreciated.</p>

<p>I am trying to modify this page to stream facebook images:
<a href=""http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/dynamic_javascript.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/dynamic_javascript.html</a></p>

<p>Also in order to make this work you will also need the facebook Javascript SDK script</p>

<pre><code> &lt;script src=""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You will also need Jquery.</p>

<p>Finally, below is a sample of my code, the portion that is not working:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
//the below is an Asynchronous request to facebook

FB.api('/232137976851458' + '/photos', function(response) {
for (i=0;i&lt;=response.data.length;i++)
    {
    mycarousel_itemList[i] =  {url: response.data[i].picture, title: ""2""};
    }
});

//the alert below is used as a forced break to allow the api to stream the required information, if we remove this alert, the images refuse to load into the carousel

alert(""test"");

//after the pictures are retrieved from the facebook API, the mycarousel_itemList array will be used to dynamically add the pictures into a carousel.....the code to instantiate the carousel is below

jQuery('#mycarousel').jcarousel({
    size: mycarousel_itemList.length,
    wrap: ""circular"",

<p>There are a large number of different methods beginning with assert defined in Junit's Assert class. Each of these methods has slightly different arguments and semantics about what they are asserting. </p>

<p>The following shows some irregular uses of assertTrue:</p>

<pre><code>assertTrue(""Objects must be the same"", expected == actual);
assertTrue(""Objects must be equal"", expected.equals(actual));
assertTrue(""Object must be null"", actual == null);
assertTrue(""Object must not be null"", actual != null);
</code></pre>

<p>Some unit testing experts pointed out that the above code could be better written as:</p>

<pre><code>assertSame(""Objects must be the same"", expected, actual);
assertEquals(""Objects must be equal"", expected, actual);
assertNull(""Object must be null"", actual);
assertNotNull(""Object must not be null"", actual);
</code></pre>

<p>One of the advantage of using the appropriate 'assertXXX()' will increase the readability of the unit test. Can anyone point out what other benefit of using the appropriate 'assertXXX()' ? </p>

<p>The problem is Spring seems find a bean class under a false package <code>com.company.productline.i18n.someServiceClass</code> without the <code>product</code> in the middle, but here are what I can confirm:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is not a class/classpath under the package <code>com.company.productline.i18n.someServiceClass</code>, but there is a class under <code>com.company.productline.product.i18n.someServiceClass</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The class <code>someServiceClass</code> does have a @Component annotation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But if I take one level down of the classpath in <code>base-package</code>, the error is gone:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;context:component-scan base-package=""com.company.productline.product""&gt;
        &lt;context:exclude-filter expression="".*_Roo_.*"" type=""regex""/&gt;

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5&lt;/li&gt;
  .
  .
&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>Here I want to reorder and I think about some logic with this function, for each <code>li</code> element remove it and place it at the bottom.</p>

<pre><code>$('li').each(function(){
    $(this).parent().append(this);
    reorder ($(this));
})
</code></pre>

<p>Then with this another function evaluate the value of the previous element<sub>var prev</sub> and if <code>prev</code> is lower then place the element above that one.</p>

<pre><code>function reorder(p) {
    var val = parseInt(p.text()),
        prev = parseInt(p.prev().text());
    if (val &gt; prev) {
        p.prev().before(p);
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the question is I need if the statement is true reevaluate the values with the new <code>prev</code> element to consider the new position. Some this way:</p>

<pre><code> if (val &gt; prev) {
    p.prev().before(p);
    // And Run again the function to compare with the new prev element
 }

<p>In the past year, I have been working with a lot of JavaScript and the CSS based selectors used in jQuery pushed me to learn more about how they work.  I have been through the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/"" rel=""nofollow"">W3 CSS3 selectors document</a> a few times, and that has helped me understand how to better use CSS selectors in jQuery, but it has not really helped me understand when one CSS rule will be applied over another.</p>

<p>I will show you an example of what I do not understand.</p>

<p>I have the following the HTML:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class='item'&gt;
    &lt;a&gt;Link 1&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a class='special'&gt;Link 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.item a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: black;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 1em;    }

.special {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: red;
    font-weight: normal;
    font-size: 2em;    }
</code></pre>

<p>Given the above, both Link 1 and Link 2 will be styled the same, as determined by the <code>.item a</code> CSS.  Why does the style associated with <code>.special</code> not take precedence for Link 2?</p>

<p>Obviously, I can get around it like this:</p>

<pre><code>.special {
    text-decoration: underline !important;
    color: red !important;
    font-weight: normal !important;
    font-size: 1em !important;    }
</code></pre>

<p>But, I feel like that is a hack that I have to sprinkle in due to my lack of understanding.  When I use <code>!important</code> I feel a little bit like an addict slipping some small amount of a forbidden substance, telling himself it's ok to indulge ""one-last-time"" before quitting for good.</p>

<p>Additionally, if I wanted to <strong>really</strong> learn CSS, are there any excellent books to recommend?</p>

<p>The model supports various forms of change which all work OK.  The two of relevance are:</p>

<p>1) Some data in a small number of related rows changes</p>

<p>2) A visualisation change means that the majority of rows should change their formatting - in particular they have a change of background highlighting.  Their <code>DisplayRole</code> data does not change.</p>

<p>The current design deals with both of these in the same way: for every row that has any change the model emits <code>dataChanged(start_of_row_index,end_of_row_index)</code>.  I emit the signal for both parent rows that change and for any of their children that have changed.</p>

<p>However, this performs badly in case 2 as the model gets big: a very large number of <code>dataChanged</code> signals are emitted.</p>

<p>I have changed the code so that in case 2 the model emits <code>dataChanged</code> only for the (single) row that is the parent of the entire tree.</p>

<p>This still appears to work correctly but does not accord with my understanding of the responsibilities of the model.  But I suspect I may be wrong.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am misunderstanding the <code>dataChanged</code> signal?  Does it actually cause the view to update all children as well as the specified range?  Or can I avoid emitting <code>dataChanged</code> when it is not the <code>DisplayRole</code> that is changing?</p>

<h2>Edited with my progress so far</h2>

<p>As Jan points out, I ought to emit <code>dataChanged</code> either for most or all of the rows in case 2.</p>

<p>My code originally did this by emitting <code>dataChanged</code> for every changed row but this is too expensive - the view takes too long to process all these signals.</p>

<p>A possible solution could be to aggregate the <code>dataChanged</code> signal for any contiguous blocks of changed rows but this will still not perform well when, for example, every other row has changed - it would still emit too many signals.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to just tell the view to consider all data as potentially changed (but all indexes still valid - the layout unchanged).  This does not seem to be possible with a single signal.</p>

<p>Because of a quirk of the <code>QTreeView</code> class, it is possible (though incorrect according to the spec) to emit only one <code>dataChanged(tl,br</code>) as long as <code>tl != br</code>.  I had this working and it passed our testing but left me nervous.</p>

<p>I have settled for now on a version which traverses the tree and emits a single <code>dataChanged(tl,br)</code> for every parent (with tl,br spanning all the children of that parent).  This conforms to the model/view protocol and for our models it typically reduces the number of signals by about a factor of 10.</p>

<p>It does not seem ideal however.  Any other suggestions anyone?</p>

<p>I'm working on a system that will need to create various X12 files for health care (insurance)  transactions and inquiries (Specifically 270 Eligibility and 837 Claim).</p>

<p>I know there are good tools out there (pyx12 specifically) for converting between XML and X12, and actually I've gone as far as importing some components from pyx12 to actually create/manipulate x12 data.</p>

<p>Even considering that, after researching the formats a bit, I'm starting to believe that I could have an easier time generating these formats using a template language.  I think that it would be a matter of defining <code>for</code> loops for any segments&amp;loops that need to be repeated per portion claim/inquiry, and the header regions are going to be somewhat static besides whatever element values that could be easily updated by my context.</p>

<p>Almost all of my records are coming out from sqlalchemy so it should be easy enough to loop through my records in the database where relations are very well defined and mapped.</p>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I suppose this is less of a question and more of a quest for advice &amp; insight, so feel free to shoot with all of that.  IE, Do you think this is a good idea or a waste of time?</li>
<li>For any die-hard x12 people, what kind of problems have you run into building x12 from scratch? What should I watch out for?</li>
<li>Has this style of implementation been done before? Are there examples of specific X12 format templates available, from any language? (I did look with little success)</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Just a side note:</em></p>

<p>We're already working with python and django, so that template language is available to us.  If we need to do these things as a background process we'll either do the hacky config environment tricks to get django templates to work outside of our django project or else use jinja instead--which is nearly interchangeable.</p>

<pre><code>var img = document.createElement(""img"");
img.src = ""http://mydomain.com/myImageServer?param=blah"";
</code></pre>

<p>In certain cases, some of these images outlive their usefulness before they've finished downloading. At that point, I remove them from the DOM.</p>

<p>The problem is that the browser continues to download those images even <em>after they've been removed from the DOM</em>. That creates a bottleneck, since I have new images waiting to be downloaded, but they have to wait for the old unneeded images to finish downloading first.</p>

<p>I would like to <strong>abort</strong> those unneeded image downloads. The obvious solution <em>seems</em> to be to request the binary image data via AJAX (since AJAX requests can be aborted), and set the img.src once the download is complete:</p>

<pre><code>// Code sample uses jQuery, but jQuery is not a necessity

var img = document.createElement(""img"");

var xhr = $.ajax({
        url: ""http://mydomain.com/myImageServer?param=blah"",
        context: img,
        success: ImageLoadedCallback
    });

function ImageLoadedCallback(data)
{
    this.src = data;
}

function DoSomethingElse()
{
    if (condition)
        xhr.abort();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem is that this line does not work the way I had hoped:</p>

<pre><code>this.src = data;
</code></pre>

<p>I've searched high and low. Is there no way to set an image source to binary image data sent via AJAX?</p>

<p>In the data I have multiple stop segments that are either Pickups (PU) or Drops (DR) and based on how many of each type there are, determines what the value needs to be set to.  I can loop through the stops and get the total number of pickups and drops but setting the values is stumping me. (there are always at least 1 PU and 1 DR)</p>

<p>Logic works like:</p>

<ol>
<li>If there is only 1 PU, then the value should map to CL (complete load).</li>
<li>If there are multiple PU's then the beginning PU's should map to  PL (partial load) and the last PU should be CL (complete load)</li>
<li>If there is only 1 DR, then the value should map to CU (complete unload).</li>
<li>If there are multiple DR's then the beginning DR's should map to PU (partial unload)and the last DR should be CU (complete unload).</li>
</ol>

<p>So a two PU and two DR load should loop through 4 times and the results should look like:</p>

<ul>
<li>PL</li>
<li>CL</li>
<li>PU</li>
<li>CU</li>
</ul>

<p>C# code below gives me the # of pickups/deliveries</p>

int iDrop = 0;

    iPickup++;

STOP_COMPANY_4_LOOP.MoveNext();
</code></pre>

<p>I just can't seem to think my way through how the loops should look to look ahead at the number of pickups and look at the current value and set a value and move to the next record.  Once I have the algorithm, I can write the code (I think) but I'm not coming up with a working solution.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>(EDIT)
This is a 210 positional flat file export that I'm mapping to a X12 EDI format to invoice our trading partner.  I'm using an EDI software package (ACOM's EZConnect) to do the mapping.  I have the entire map done, except for this one element.</p>

<p>(EDIT 2)
Flat file is already created, our billing system creates it automatically.  The mapping software imports and converts the flat file into X12 based on the map I built, and it already writes the existing stop value to that element.  The flat file contains all the stop data within it, but it only uses 2 codes, PU for pickup and DR for drops, and our trading partner requires different codes based on the 4 rules above.  So I'm hoping for some help with the algorithm to look at the current value and look at the number of pickups vs drops and determine what the value should be changed to.</p>

<p>It successfully decrypts the message, but it is many weird characters.</p>

<p>Our scenario is a Java client that is sending messages to a PHP server, but encrypts the data with a private key. PHP knows about the public key, which it should use to decrypt and validate the message.</p>

<p>I've read a lot of posts regarding this issue here on SO, but I've come to realize that this is a bit specific issue, especially if there's different algorithms in use, etc. So sorry if this may be a duplicate.</p>

"20155793","1","20156142","","2013-11-22 22:36:12","","1","350","<p>How do I into recursive loops?
First off, I want to loop out lists of folders and files, of course these files should be inside their respective folders and I'm gonna display the list on the web through HTML and CSS.
I have a <code>List&lt;DirectoryInfo&gt;</code> and a <code>List&lt;FileInfo&gt;</code> for storing my folders and files.</p>

<p>I can do a basic foreach loop in my View like this:</p>

<pre><code>@foreach (DirectoryInfo folder in ViewBag.folders)
    {
        &lt;p&gt;@folder.Name&lt;/p&gt;
        foreach (FileInfo file in ViewBag.files)
        {
            if (folder.FullName == file.DirectoryName)
            { 
                &lt;p class=""file"" data-url=""@file.FullName.Substring(file.DirectoryName.IndexOf(""Content""))"" style=""margin-left:20px;""&gt;@file.Name&lt;/p&gt;
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And this works, it displays all folders and the files in their respective folders.
However the issue that comes here is as you might have already guessed, subfolders.
Currently all folders are in the same list, including subfolders.</p>

<p>I can do something like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ol class=""tree""&gt;
    @{
        int i = 1;
        int subFolderi = 1;
    foreach (DirectoryInfo folder in ViewBag.folders)
    {
        &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;label for=""folder-@i""&gt;@folder.Name&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""folder-@i"" /&gt; 
        &lt;ol&gt;
        @foreach (DirectoryInfo subFolder in ViewBag.folders)
        {
            if (folder.Name == subFolder.Parent.ToString())
            {
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;label for=""subfolder-@subFolderi""&gt;@subFolder.Name&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""subfolder-@subFolderi"" /&gt; 
                &lt;ol&gt;
                @foreach (FileInfo file in ViewBag.files)
                {
                    if (subFolder.FullName == file.DirectoryName)
                    { 
                        &lt;li class=""file"" data-url=""@file.FullName.Substring(file.DirectoryName.IndexOf(""Content""))""&gt;@file.Name&lt;/li&gt;
                    }
                }
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            }
            subFolderi++;
        }
        @foreach (FileInfo file in ViewBag.files)
        {

            if (folder.FullName == file.DirectoryName)
            { 
                &lt;li class=""file"" data-url=""@file.FullName.Substring(file.DirectoryName.IndexOf(""Content""))""&gt;@file.Name&lt;/li&gt;
            }
        }
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        i++;
    }
    }
    &lt;/ol&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And it'll put the subfolders inside their parent folders, however this obviously only works for the first tier of subfolders, not the subfolders inside the subfolders.
And it also display these subfolders twice, once inside their parent folder and one in the main folder list.</p>

<p>The question is then, am I supposed to make a recursive loop to keep getting the subfolders and their files inside the subfolders or should I do some sort of LINQ to combine everything before-hand to make the loop easier?
Or is there a better way to do this?
I prefer a clean way were I still have control over the HTML/CSS, so no jQuery plugins or ASP controls that uses a datasource and then creates everything automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Working solution</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ol class=""tree""&gt;
    @printFolder(ViewBag.contentFolder)
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    @helper printFolder(DirectoryInfo folder)
    {
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;label for=""folder-@folder.Name""&gt;@folder.Name&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""folder-@folder.Name"" /&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                    @foreach(DirectoryInfo subFolder in folder.GetDirectories())
                    {
                        @printFolder(subFolder)
                    }
                    @foreach(FileInfo file in folder.GetFiles())
                    {
                        @printFile(file)
                    }
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    }
    @helper printFile(FileInfo file)
    {
        &lt;li class=""file"" data-url=""@file.FullName.Substring(file.DirectoryName.IndexOf(""Content""))""&gt;@file.Name&lt;/li&gt;

Can I do that via the flat rate option?</p>

<p>I used the code below to add a 10% surcharge to all orders and labeled it as shipping; since woocommerce needs a shipping option, I chose 'free shipping' and hid the free shipping row on the cart and checkout pages so my custom shipping surcharge was visible and the free shipping text was not. My only problem is when customers receive emails there are now two rows; one that says free shipping, and a second that says shipping (10%) and the surcharge.</p>

<p>Alternatively, is there a way to hide the shipping row in the emails? That just seems harder.</p>

<p>It seems to be standard in the Node world to write code with commas first:</p>

<pre><code>var connect = require('connect')
  , HTTPSServer = require('./https')
  , HTTPServer = require('./http')
  , Route = require('./router/route')
</code></pre>

<p>I don't like it and my code editor via JSLint throws countless errors.</p>

<p>My question is: is there a justifiable reason why ""nodesters"" are doing this or is it just a cool new style?</p>

<p>Until now I have been ""correcting"" it by putting the commas back ""where they should be"" to comply with JSLint. </p>

<p>But it occurred to me recently that this approach is not very sustainable, especially if I am going to make use of more community modules.  </p>

"25506749","1","","","2014-08-26 13:13:28","","1","64","<p>I have got a problem with transaction rollback.</p>

<p>I need to first insert a user into the database, and then insert into another table some kind of log of who inserted the user.
If there is an exception when inserting this log-message, the whole transaction should be rolled back (i.e. user needs to be removed again).</p>

<p>The .ear is deployed on Wildfly 8.1, persistence is achieved through Hibernate with MySQL.</p>

<p>My class looks like this</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
@Remote(AdministratorBiznesowyService.class)
@Transactional(rollbackOn = Exception.class)
public class AdministratorBiznesowyServiceBean implements AdministratorBiznesowyService {
</code></pre>

<p>The method looks like this</p>

<pre><code>@Override
@Transactional(rollbackOn = Exception.class)
public void insertUser(String userSessionId, User user) throws AdministratorBiznesowyException {

  checkPermission(userSessionId);
  try {
    userBusiness.insertUser(user);
    log.insertLog(
        authenticationObjectBusiness.getUserIdForSessionId(userSessionId),
        LogEnum.CREATE, user);
  } catch (AuthenticationException e) {
    ServerLogModule.logActionError(Messages
      .getErrorMessage(""server.authorization.noPermission""));
    throw new AdministratorBiznesowyException();
  } catch (Exception e1) {
    ServerLogModule.logActionError(Messages
      .getErrorMessage(""server.exception""));
    throw new AdministratorBiznesowyException();
  }*/
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>The insertUser implementation in userBusiness:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void insertUser(User user) throws   AdministratorBiznesowyException {
try {
  UserEntity userEntity = adminConvertUtils.convertUserToEntity(user);
  userEntityFacade.create(userEntity);
 } catch (Exception e) {
  throw new AdministratorBiznesowyException();
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my log.insertLog currently for test-purposes just throws an exception.</p>

<pre><code>throw new LogException();
</code></pre>

<p>and its implementation is like this:</p>

<pre><code>@ApplicationException(rollback=true)
public class LogException extends RuntimeException {
</code></pre>

<p>AdministratorBiznesowyException:</p>

<pre><code>@ApplicationException(rollback = true)
public class AdministratorBiznesowyException extends CommunicationException {
</code></pre>

<p>CommunicationException:</p>

<pre><code>public class CommunicationException extends Exception {
</code></pre>

<p>So now, when I successfully call insertUser and directly after that get an exception, the new user still gets added to the database (I check through MySQL Workbench).</p>

<p>What else can I do to get this to rollback?
If any other code is needed, please comment, thank you in advance.</p>

"20955534","1","21264445","","2014-01-06 17:21:09","","1","512","<p>I want to setup IntelliJ IDEA to compile Processing sketches. So far I've been following the instructions found here:
<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/eskimoblood/processing-in-intellij"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/eskimoblood/processing-in-intellij</a></p>

<p>These instructions work fine for code completion and basic ""drawing"". But I run into problems once I want to access files – i.e. an image - inside the data folder which is created on slide 19. First the code of my Processing class:</p>

<pre><code>import processing.core.PApplet;
import processing.core.PImage;

public class IntellijTest extends PApplet
{
    private PImage image;

    @Override
    public void setup() {
        size(400, 400);
        println(sketchPath);
        // load image
        image = loadImage(""test.png"");
    }


    @Override
    public void draw() {
        background(0);
        noStroke();
        fill(200);
        rect(100, 100, 200, 200);
        // draw image
        image(image, 110, 100);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This leads to the following error:</p>

<pre><code>/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA 12.app/bin
The file ""test.png"" is missing or inaccessible, make sure the URL is valid or that the file has been added to your sketch and is readable.
Exception in thread ""Animation Thread"" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at processing.core.PGraphics.image(PGraphics.java:3572)
    at processing.core.PApplet.image(PApplet.java:12604)
    at IntellijTest.draw(IntellijTest.java:28)
    at processing.core.PApplet.handleDraw(PApplet.java:2306)
    at processing.core.PGraphicsJava2D.requestDraw(PGraphicsJava2D.java:243)
    at processing.core.PApplet.run(PApplet.java:2177)
    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:744)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the sketchPath is set to ""/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA 12.app/bin"". So the running sketch (Applet) does not find the image. IntelliJ does even warn me about it, but I still haven't figured out how to add the image to the sketch or better how to set the correct sketchPath value so that the sketch finds all files inside the data folder at runtime.</p>

<p>I'ld really appreciate any hints or insights on how to accomplish this.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pwPUw.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pwPUw.jpg"" alt=""Filters and Wine List""></a></p>

<p>Every filter works well if I use each one alone.</p>

<p>If I use two filters at the same time, list is updated according to last selection of filter.</p>

<p>Example: I select Pinot Noir from Grape Filter;
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/R1UwU.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/R1UwU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This works fine for most devices, some Samsungs (Galaxy S5, S3) behave strange though; my method createImageFile creates the following path: </p>

<pre><code> file:///storage/emulated/0/Pictures/JPEG_20150701_131442_-1853613631.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>but the image is saved on the device to the following paths: </p>

<pre><code>/storage/emulated/legacy/Pictures/JPEG_20150701_131442_-1853613631.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>/storage/sdcard0/Pictures/JPEG_20150701_114009_-1853613631.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>Am I doing something basically wrong here? Or is it just Samsung not following a standard?</p>

<p>The action myBean.execute() delegates database access and its signature is <code>public void execute()</code>.</p>

<p>Is this ""onchange"" attribute required in the tag ?

<p>It is clear to me that the problem is due to the impossibility of mongo-jackson-mapper to read from the bank. It cannot instantiate the <code>Book.class</code> once it is an interface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, annotating any of the api interfaces is not an option  otherwise it would broke modularity.  </p>

<p>In previous research trying to solve it, I thought MixIns would be the more suitable option here, however it didn't work at all. I might be doing something wrong. Is there any option to solve this? By the way, the <code>addBook</code> method in <code>BookInventoryMongo</code> works fine.</p>

<p>My solution is to either...</p>

<ul>
<li>A. Let the developer figure out there is a certain way to do it. </li>
<li>B. Ignore <code>$value</code>, forcing you to pass all the elements (which isn't much different than the first option).</li>
<li>or C. (if possible) Find the name of the element that called my validator in the first place and ignore it from the list of <code>$fieldsWithValue</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think there is a way to apply a validator on a form without attaching it to an element, but that would be even better, if it were an option.</p>

<p>How can I solve this problem?</p>

<p>I get the first 10 lines of output, but the java process won't exit until it's done with all of its processing. It's like java doesn't care that stdout (System.out) is gone and the head process is dead and gone.</p>

<p>I setup the site with Turnkey Linux's Magento application and whilst configuring it I was asked to ""Enter the domain to serve Magento."" to which I entered shop.example.com </p>

<p>Now when I first started editing the site I could access it from shop.example.com and the servers IP address. Everything was working fine, until...</p>

<p>I realized that the server need to be upgraded from a micro instance to an m1.medium instance on AWS and also that I would be working from home as well so it would be helpful to move the site to a live testing domain that I already own.</p>

<p>So I upgraded the server and changed the DNS records on the domain to point the subdomain shop. to the servers IP. Now when you try to access the site everything redirects to shop.example.com which is broken.</p>

<p>Not really sure what the next step is or where the problem lies so I shall outline a few things I've looked into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checked my computers hosts file to see if I added some sort of loop and forgot, nothing incriminating there.</li>
<li>Connected to the server via ssh &amp; sftp to check that everything is still there which it is.</li>
<li>Connected to the sites webmin to see if that was still there and it is still alive and well.</li>
<li>Searched google for Magento, Turnkey and Stackoverflow for related problems but haven't found anything similar enough to solve it. </li>
</ul>

<p>Any help/advice is greatly appreciated. I can also provide any other information that might help get a clearer picture.</p>

<p>So I have a header file and a code file.  The class is representation of a View that will be queried from stored proc. For each col. in view there is one data member in class.
Currently in code we have something like this: </p>

{
   m_col1 = reader(""m_col1"");
   m_col2 = reader(""m_col2"");
   ..
}

<p>How can I write a code that will iterate through member variables and give me code like:</p>

<pre><code>Load( Reader reader)
{
   For (each str in ArrayOfMemberVariables)
     variableLValue(str) = reader(str); //  str = m_col1,  m_col2  ...
}

<p>I had a browse around Stack and did some fairly extensive googling but can't find anything written about this. To cut to the chase here is some code demonstrating this odd behavior;</p>

<pre><code>public class Test {

        String what, why, where = ""who knows?"";

        public static void main(String[] args) {

    }

<p>Output;</p>

<pre><code>The 'what' String = null
</code></pre>

<p>This shows the correct output if you declare and instantiate each String separately, but chaining them together like this causes them to be instantiated <code>null</code>. So, the question is why? And if this is standard behavior, then why does the compiler even allow us to instantiate <code>String</code> objects this way?</p>

    return $mainframe;
    }

$mainframe = startJoomla();

jimport('joomla.filesystem.folder');
jimport('joomla.filesystem.file');
</code></pre>

<p>And then, when I wanted to call something up from Joomla, I could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$custom = new CustomController(); // assuming there's a com_custom somewhere
</code></pre>

<p>This worked for 1.5.  But in 2.5, the above doesn't work at all.  I found a revised version of the load script:</p>

<pre><code>function startJoomla() {
    define('_JEXEC', 1);
    define( 'DS', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR );
    $dir = dirname(__FILE__);
    define('JPATH_BASE', $dir); 
    // load joomla libraries
    require_once JPATH_BASE.'/includes/defines.php';
    require_once JPATH_BASE.'/includes/framework.php';
    require_once JPATH_BASE . DS . 'libraries' . DS . 'joomla' . DS . 'factory.php';
    // Instantiate the application.
    $app = JFactory::getApplication('site');
    // Initialise the application.
    return $app-&gt;initialise();          
}
$mainframe = startJoomla();
</code></pre>

<p>This enables things like 'JFactory::getUser();' but will no longer allow me to utilize commands like 'new MycustomcomponentController();'  Gives me 'core' Joomla functionality, but skips everything I installed.  Is there an appropriate new revised compilation of jimport instructions or perhaps a different function of JComponent that allows me to call up my custom functions along with other components and models for use in external php files?  Assume this will be run from a CRON or similar.</p>

<pre><code>dim s as string
s = ddl.SelectedValue
textbox1.text = s  ' this line just for debugging.

<p>(I then go on to clear the ddl and repopulate it with different items based on the value of s - I don't like this functionality, but I want to give things the same look and feel as the old system.)  important - I have gotten the value of s before I change anything with the ddl. (and in fact, for debugging purposes, I've commented out the rest of the dang code.)</p>

<p>The problem is that the selectedvalue always returns a null string instead of the value I set with New Listitem(""x"", ""value-of-x"").  Is there some special trick to getting values when I'm using an asynchpostbacktrigger?</p>

<hr>

<p>thanks for your answers. I found out what my problem was - and it was not what I thought. I didn't realize that the autoupdate would implement a page_load() command. (This seems odd to me, because for some reason I thought the reason for using a panel update was so it didn't have to reload the entire page. I guess page_load() fires whenever any part of a page loads? Not complaining - just wondering aloud.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I found in another post a reference to a function called ispostback(). In my page_load code, I say,</p>

<p>If not ispostback() then initialize</p>

<p>It works now.</p>

<p>I saw it referenced here earlier: DropDownList doesn't postback on SelectedIndexChanged</p>

<p>But at that time I didn't see the relevance to what I was doing - and no reference to page_upload(). Anyway, I'm not sure how to close this out, but I figure I should give my solution which follows below. The values are kinda stupid, as I'm trying to avoid posting my production code.</p>

<p>In front code, after the form tag, I put:</p>

<p>Then later in the front code, I put the object:</p>

<p>

    
    
    
    
   
        
    </p>

<p></p>

<p>In behind code, I have several pieces:</p>

<pre><code>Protected Sub initialize()

    ddlAssign.Items.Clear()
    ddlAssign.Items.Add(New ListItem(""SELECT A CATEGORY"", """"))
    ddlAssign.Items.Add(New ListItem(""option 1"", ""combo1""))
    ddlAssign.Items.Add(New ListItem(""option 2"", ""combo2""))
    ddlAssign.Items.Add(New ListItem(""option 3"", ""combo3""))
    ddlAssign.SelectedIndex = 0

End Sub
Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
If Not IsPostBack Then
  initialize()
End If

End Sub

Protected Sub set_next_menu()

    ddlAssign.Items.Clear()
    ddlAssign.Items.Add(New ListItem(""menu 2"", ""2""))
    ddlAssign.Items.Add(New ListItem(""menu 3"", ""3""))
    ddlAssign.Items.Add(New ListItem(""menu 4"", ""4""))
    ddlAssign.Items.Add(New ListItem(""menu 5"", ""5""))
    ddlAssign.SelectedIndex = 0

End Sub

Protected Sub ddlAssign_SelectedIndexChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles ddlAssign.SelectedIndexChanged Dim s As String

    s = ddlAssign.SelectedValue

  if s = """" then
     initialize
  end if
 if s = ""combo1"" then
   set_next_menu
 end if

end sub

<p>And there's a function I use to render data for drop-down menu:</p>

<pre><code>// I render drop-down menu like this
echo buildMenu(0, $hierarchy)


function buildMenu($parentId, array $menuData) {
    $html = ''; 

    if (isset($menuData['parents'][$parentId])) {

        $html = '&lt;ul&gt;'; 

        foreach ($menuData['parents'][$parentId] as $itemId) { 

            $html .= '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;' . $menuData['items'][$itemId]['name'] . '&lt;/a&gt;'; 

            // find childitems recursively 
            $html .= buildMenu($itemId, $menuData);

        }

        $html .= '&lt;/ul&gt;'; 
    }

    return $html;

<p>This is working as expected. However right now I want to to turn drop down into a selectbox, so that an output would be like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select&gt;

  &lt;option value=""id1""&gt;Parent&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""id2""&gt;- Child 1&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""id2""&gt;-- Sub-Child 1&lt;/option&gt;

&lt;/select&gt;

I have a bunch of text files (.csv, to be precise), around 20000 that differ in character encoding: <code>file -i *.csv</code> gives me <code>charset=us-ascii</code> for most, but some are <code>utf-16le</code>.</p>

<p>The goal:
I want them all to be encoded the same way, us-ascii here. I think of a one-liner that checks for each file in the directory the encoding, and if it is <code>utf-16le</code>, it converts it to <code>us-ascii</code>.</p>

<p>I only started to learn bash programming a few day ago, so this one still escapes me. Is it possible, something like running file -i on each file (did that), capturing the return value, check what encoding is given and if it is not us-ascii, convert it?</p>

"24049069","1","","","2014-06-04 23:08:21","","-2","89","<p>I have two scenes that I made in SpriteBuilder, one is Shop and the other is UpgradesNew. Shop is a CCNode layer and UpgradesNew is a CCNode layer. I have two CCScrollViews in the MainScene that load Shop and UpgradesNew respectively.</p>

<p>When one button in Shop is tapped, the label in UpgradesNew should change colors. I have been trying to implement this using delegates but it's not working.</p>

<p>Here's what I did...</p>

<p>In shop.h I set the protocol:</p>

<pre><code>@protocol changeColorProtocol &lt;NSObject&gt;
@required
     -(void)changeColor;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then I set the id</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, retain) id &lt;changeColorProtocol&gt; delegate;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the button that when clicked, should use changeColor. This is in shop.m</p>

<pre><code>-(void) buyDiggerShibe {
        [self.delegate changeColor];
        [self didLoadFromCCB];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now in UpgradesNew.h I made it adopt the protocol like this</p>

<pre><code>@interface UpgradesNew : CCNode &lt;changeColorProtocol&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in UpgradesNew.m</p>

<p>I set delegate to self in ViewDidLoad.</p>

<pre><code>Shop *shop = [[Shop alloc]init];
shop.delegate = self;
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)changeColor {
    if (hasDigger == YES) {
        shovelRequires.color = [CCColor greenColor];
        NSLog(@""HEY HEY HEY"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I probably have parts of the delegate placed in the wrong area because I was trying to switch them around when it wasn't working, I'm not sure where they are supposed to go. I've watched multiple delegate tutorials and it just seems overly complicated, at least with what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Tried this.</p>

<p>I created a property in UpgradesNew </p>

<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) Shop *shop;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I synthesized it in the implementation and allocated it like this in didLoadFromCCB, instead of creating a new object: </p>

<pre><code>self.shop = [[Shop alloc]init];
shop.delegate = self;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: This is how I am creating objects.</p>

<p>Drag a label into a layer. <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/FtYfYdo.jpg?1?3438"" rel=""nofollow"">Identify it</a> then define it in header as <code>CCLabelTTF *label;</code> That's it, thats all I do to create any object on the layer.</p>

<p>To create a layer like Shop or UpgradesNew, I hit <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ugxYbfh.jpg?2?6409"" rel=""nofollow"">New -> File -> Layer</a>. That creates a new CCNode. Then I set the class of the CCNode, as shown in the picture the CCNode that is highlighted has a class of MainScene. If I want to establish a @property to that CCNode I just type the name in the box right below custom class and set it as doc root var, and then put it in the header as <code>CCNode *MainScene</code>. I don't do anything other than that.</p>

The resulting image looks the same as if only the first fragment shader were run in a single-shader class.</p>

<p>What could be going wrong here? It doesn't help that all the examples I can find in the GPUImage code base that subclass GPUImageTwoPassFilter are simply using the same fragment shader program for each pass (as in GPUImageGaussianBlurFilter).</p>

<pre><code>#import ""BFTwoPassTest.h""

NSString *const kBFTwoPassTestFirstFragmentShaderString = SHADER_STRING
(
 varying highp vec2 textureCoordinate;
 uniform sampler2D inputImageTexture;

 void main()
 {
     lowp vec4 textureColor = texture2D(inputImageTexture, textureCoordinate);
     gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, textureColor.g, textureColor.b, 1.0);
 }
 );


NSString *const kBFTwoPassTestSecondFragmentShaderString = SHADER_STRING
(
 varying highp vec2 textureCoordinate;
 uniform sampler2D inputImageTexture;

 void main()
 {
     This should be an obvious syntax error.
 }
 );


@implementation BFTwoPassTest

    self = [self initWithFirstStageFragmentShaderFromString:kBFTwoPassTestFirstFragmentShaderString secondStageFragmentShaderFromString:kBFTwoPassTestSecondFragmentShaderString];
    if (self) {

    }
    return self;
}

<p>I am using x-code version 3.1.4 and an iphone simulator version 3.1. </p>

<p>Right now I am building a game where a car (portrayed by a UIImageView) moves left and right using two buttons (left and right). That part works fine. However, I am trying to randomly spawn UIImageViews at the top that will go down at a constant rate. I am able to get one UIImageView to move using this:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)moveMeteor{

    iv.center=CGPointMake(iv.center.x, iv.center.y + 1); 
    [self performSelector:@selector(moveMeteor) withObject:iv afterDelay:0.01]; 
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>where iv is a UIImageView and I call this function when I click a button. However, I want to create randomly spawning UIImageViews. So, I did this using this code: </p>

<pre><code>-(void)addViews: (NSTimer *) aTimer {
    UIImageView *iv = [[UIImageView alloc]initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""Meteor.png""]];
    CGRect rect = CGRectMake(arc4random() % (350), arc4random() % (5), 35, 35);
    [iv setFrame:rect];
    [self.view addSubview:iv];
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>I call this function by clicking a start button which does this: </p>

<pre><code>[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:1 target:self selector:@selector(addViews:)    userInfo:nil repeats:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>I thought about using tags by changing the addViews function to :</p>

<pre><code>-(void)addViews: (NSTimer *) aTimer {
    UIImageView *iv = [[UIImageView alloc]initWithImage   [UIImage imageNamed:@""Meteor.png""]];
    CGRect rect = CGRectMake(arc4random() % (350), arc4random() % (5), 35, 35);
    [iv setFrame:rect];
    [self.view addSubview:iv];
    iv.tag=tagStart;  
    [self moveMeteor:tagStart]; 
    tagStart = tagStart+1;
</code></pre>

<p>}
(the initial value of tagStart is 1); </p>

<p>and changing the move function to: </p>

<pre><code>-(void)moveMeteor:(int)tag{
    UIImageView *test= (UIImageView *)[self.view viewWithTag:tagStart];
    test.center=CGPointMake(test.center.x, test.center.y + 1); 
    [self performSelector:@selector(moveMeteor) withObject:tagStart afterDelay:0.01];
    [test release];
</code></pre>

<p>I am very confused on how to resolve this issue. The problem is either that my move function cannot handle so many moving things at a time, my tag system is faulty, my *test is faulty, or that I am calling to many functions at the same time, or something else. Please help and give me a solution to this annoying problem. </p>

I creating a form into which the user enters a specific value (an ID number) which is then passed to by Database class which carries out my database work.</p>

<pre><code>Database newQuery = new Database();     
newQuery.getCust(c_ID);         //uses the GetCust method in my class,
                                //passing it the ID of the customer.
</code></pre>

<p>The getCust() method in my Database class creates the following query:</p>

<pre><code>ResultSet Customer = stat.executeQuery(""SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE Cust_ID=C_ID"");
</code></pre>

<p>I need a way to return the results that are stored in Customer back. Any ideas?</p>

<p>of course bash doesn't escape the wildcards nor the tilde. But if I don't use quotes, the space breaks the row.</p>

ls: impossibile accedere a b\: Nessun file o directory
ls: impossibile accedere a c/*.txt: Nessun file o directory

<p>It works but badly. Video and Audio either take too long for buffering on client side or video is not there but there is some audio which sounds horrible. Now i have a byte array which is used to get udp data. I've tried setting it to shorter and longer size (64KB,128KB,8KB,4KB...) and setting client side byte array also to shorter and longer size (1KB,10KB,100KB...). My guess is that i don't actually get these 2 sizes in right relation so i would like to ask what's recommended size for these 2. And if I'm wrong is there any solution to this.</p>

<p>I don't need it to be perfect or reliable so please avoid answers containing description about TCP vs UDP. I don't care if the client has no picture for few seconds or stream or video gets few frames worng or so i just need it to go fast.</p>

<p>So I've been thinking, is JavaScript/NodeJS (something I've started to like) actually truly parallel? Or is it simply using non-blocking operations to <em>simulate</em> parallel execution (which I think it is)? There are libraries like <a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async"" rel=""nofollow""><code>async</code></a> which gives similar functions to what I've used in OpenMPI: gather, scatter even ""parallel"".

<p>I have a <code>RichTextBox</code> and a 'Save' Button in my View. I want to save the contents of the RichTextBox to a file on the Save button click.</p>

<p>I have written a delegate class which expects a method to return void and have a single object parameter. I did this because I couldn't use the System.Action delegate.</p>

<pre><code>class BtnCommandParameterised : ICommand
{
    public delegate void ActionParameterised(object rtb);

    private ActionParameterised _actionParameterised;
    public object _object;

    {
        _actionParameterised = BtnCommandParameterisedActionParameterised;
    }

    {
        return true;
    }

    public void Execute(object parameter)
    {
        _actionParameterised.Invoke(_object);
    }

    public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my ViewModel I have an <code>InitialiseBtnCommands()</code> method which is called from the constructor. This initializes the command:</p>

<pre><code>  private void InitialiseBtnCommands()
    {
        ReturnTextAsStringCommand = new      BtnCommandParameterised(ReturnTextAsStringCommandAction);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This invokes my method to save the file.</p>

<pre><code> private void ReturnTextAsStringCommandAction(object Document)
    {
        TextRange range;
        FileStream fileStream;

        range = new TextRange(((FlowDocument)Document).ContentStart,
                              ((FlowDocument)Document).ContentEnd);

        fileStream = new FileStream(FileName, FileMode.Create);
        range.Save(fileStream, DataFormats.Text);
        fileStream.Close();
        Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.MessageBox.Show(""Text File Saved"");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, in the View XAML, this is my binding:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;Grid Name=""MainGrid"" DataContext=""{StaticResource EditorViewModel}""&gt;
    &lt;xctk:RichTextBox  SpellCheck.IsEnabled=""True"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center""  Margin=""206,166,206,60"" Name=""richTextBoxArticleBody"" AcceptsTab=""True"" BorderBrush=""Silver"" BorderThickness=""1"" VerticalAlignment=""Center""  Height=""306"" Width=""600"" FontFamily=""Arial""/&gt;

&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The command is being called and my method is invoked but nothing is passed into the <code>ReturnTextAsStringCommandAction</code> method?</p>

<p>My work around for this is to first set the element to <code>display: block; opacity: 0;</code> and then do the transition in the next frame (using <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code>. It is kind of awkward, and I can't find any explanation for this behavior in the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/"" rel=""nofollow"">spec</a>. I know that I could use the <code>visibility</code>-attribute, but I don't want to use it because I don't want to layout the hidden element.</p>

<p>So, the questions are: Is this the correct behavior or a bug? If it is the correct behavior, is there a better way to write the code? Note that I'm not asking if there are any libraries that can do it, I want to know if there is a better way to do it directly on the DOM.</p>

<p>I've tested the 3 methods individually and they all do what they should (get data from server, update db, etc.) but when I uncomment everything and run, the 2nd is starting before the first is done. And I can't figure out how to fix this. I tried <code>NSInvocationOperation</code> for the 3 methods and setting <code>dependencies</code>. didnt work. Tried <code>queue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 1</code>. didnt work.</p>

<p>The first method calls other methods and over the course of it, calls other things that create separate <code>thread</code>s, so is that the issue? When that happens, does it think the operation is done? Is <code>NSOperation</code> too complicated? Is there a simpler way just to say ""do this and dont do this til its done""?</p>

The output is something like this:</p>

<p><code>TYP     HSTNAME CLDB    ZKPR    NFS     WBSVR   FLSVR   JBT     TSKT    HBM</code></p>

<p>So, yes, it is a table that xamp program will take to validate if the server has or hasn't the specified service at the top of this table. But do you know if it is possible with a GUI builded with xamp, to launch a script located on a Linux server?.

I crawl different websites, for various property listings. Hence I get a variety of locations formats from the raw crawled locations</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:
few <strong>Samples</strong> of raw crawled locations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>North Point</strong></li>
<li>8, Java Road, <strong>North Point</strong>, Hong Kong</li>
<li>Hong Kong Island , <strong>North Point</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As can be seen from the above addresses, the same district in hong kong, that is  <strong>North point</strong> can have many forms, few have been listed above. Issue is that this data doesnt make sense unless it is mapped/structured</p>

<p><strong>Requirement</strong>:
I want some elegant solution, to be able to map these raw crawled locations to a pre-defined set of values. One way I can think of is, create a database of locations (I am using mysql), and find out the matching locationId for each crawled raw location.
If the above scheme sounds good, then my database would have fields like the below:</p>

<p>LOCATION_REF, country, state,city, locality, subLocality1, subLocality2, lat, long</p>

<p><strong>Additional information</strong>: I am also using apache solr (lucene) to built this website, so any solr related matching suggestions are also welcome</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: I think there must be some predefined APIs to do things like this, because almost every app I see have location based searching and filtering. Is there a google api to do this? If yes, I would appreciate if anyone could help with good examples</p>

<p>PS: I use Jsoup to parse data from the pages (to extract raw location)</p>

To create a simple illustration lets assume I wanted to change a field on my customer table called LastAccessed and set it with the current DateTime.  Here is what I tried in my Domain Service Class:</p>

<pre><code>    public IQueryable&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomers()
    {            
        foreach (Customer c in this.DataContext.Customers)
        {
            c.LastAccessed = DateTime.Now;
        }
        DataContext.SubmitChanges();

        return this.DataContext.Customers;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This sort of works because it does update the LastAccessed date before the record is returned to the client but it updates ALL Customer records not just the one the client is requesting.  In my client side silverlight application I am applying a query but when using runtime debugging I can see it is updating every customers however because I am using a query only the client side only the requested customer(s) are returned and pushed over the wire.  </p>

<p>If I watch my database with SQL profiler I can see that it is in fact requesting all records and then it is requesting only the queried records.  So where would I intercept those records being returned and update only their LastAccessed times.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell I need to find a way to access only the records that will be ultimately returned and at this point in the code I seem to have the entire table. I know I can pass in a specific Customer ID and query that and then work with those results but I want the flexibility for the query to come from the client so that if they are populating a grid based on some search criteria like "" State == 'NY' "" all the records that are returned to populate the grid results cause the LastAccessed field to update.
 Any help would be appreciated!  Thank You!</p>

<p>I want to test if the origin is outside of the tetrahedron and closest to a particular triangular face.</p>

<p>So far my method was to calculate the normals of a triangular face and do a series of dot product tests to determine whether or not the origin is outside and closest to that face. My method has one main issue: I cannot guarantee my normals are facing outwards. See this figure I made for a better description:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/F2FP2.png"" width=""500""></p>

<p>As you can see the same triangle, depending on the ordering of the vertices requires different cross product 'ordering' to produce normals that face outwards. Is there any way for me to ensure they face outwards? If not, is there a better method for testing these faces? Here's an example of my process:</p>

<pre><code>if (dot(ABC, AO) &gt; 0) {
        if (dot(ACD, AO) &lt;= 0) {
            if (dot(ADB, AO) &lt;= 0) {
                if (dot(DCB, DO) &lt;= 0) {
                    // closest to face of ABC

                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Reference: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABC, ACD, ADB, DCB = triangular face normals (as you can see I'm assuming the 'left' triangle from the picture)</p>
  
  <p>AO = vector from A to origin</p>
  
  <p>DO =  vector from A to origin</p>

I also understand that if I import the file containing the <code>extern</code> variables, I can reference them without a class/file name. But where does one define them and their values?</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is create a class of constants with global constants that I want to use throughout an iOS application's code.</p>

<p>Does one put them inside the interface like this?</p>

<p><strong>Example.h</strong></p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
@interface Constraints : NSObject
{

extern   NSString * const PREFS_NAME;

}

<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

extern   NSString * const PREFS_NAME;    

@interface Constraints : NSObject
{

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the implementation .m file how would one initialise the extern values?</p>

<p>Inside the implementation area like this?</p>

<p><strong>Example.m</strong></p>

<pre><code>#import ""Constraints.h""

@implementation Constraints

/**PRefecences name for the application**/
const  NSString * PREFS_NAME = @""MyApp_Prefs"";

@end

<p>Or do initialise them outside of the implementation area like this:</p>

<p><strong>Example.m</strong></p>

<pre><code>#import ""Constraints.h""

/**PRefecences name for the application**/
const  NSString * PREFS_NAME = @""MyApp_Prefs"";

@implementation Constraints

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Or do I provide them their initial values in a constructor? or some arbitrary a static style method with <code>+</code> in front of it i.e. <code>+(void) setAppConstraints</code>;</p>

<p>I have tried several combinations, but always run into errors, such as ""Redefinition of 'xVariable' with a different type"". Or a something about ""extern does not have an initialise interface"" (or something like that, I forget). So I want to know how to declaire and initialise them properly to form the same role as <code>public static final</code> variables in Java.</p>

<p>Also what are the limits of the <code>extern</code> command? I know I can <code>extern</code> an <code>NSInteger</code> or <code>NSString</code>, but what about <code>NSArray</code>?</p>

<p>I am asking this question because there seems to be to much misleading, or incomplete, information regarding the use of <code>extern</code> in Objective-C. Many of the answers seem speculatory. My hope is for this question to be a good resource not only for me, but to limit further similar questions about the basics of <code>extern</code>.</p>

<p>but the response gives ""Failed to load response data"" message. </p>

<p>I myself tried to call ZeroClipboard without using a controller(without calling the script dynamically), that is to say by putting all code in single file and it works fine. 
Moreover, I tried to use the body of copies() function directly in controller's method, but in that case I have problem with CI's routing, the default controller ('site/') is added to the requested path and I am getting</p>

However, based on a parameter, the array should not include two of the values, but include all the same other values. What's the proper way to approach this? (I could use a list...but I'm hoping there's a better way)</p>

<p>Example code:</p>

<pre><code>bool msettingvalue=false;

//code that goes through settings

<p>What's the proper way to assign the array to settings. All the values will be same, it's that if the msettingvalue is false, it should include certain settings.
(You may change the title if you think of a better one).</p>

<p><strong>Edit1</strong>
Ideally, I'd like to stay with a string[] array vs a dictionary as its faster...and I'm iterating through the array in order so I don't need a key index.</p>

<p>This is one sample of the code, and I have this at least 2 times per page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""car-slide""&gt;
        &lt;li onmouseover=""$('fp1').fade( {duration:.2, from:1, to:0.8 }); return false;"" onmouseout=""$('fp1').appear( {duration:.2}); return false;""&gt;&lt;img src=""{{skin url='myimage1'}}"" id=""fp1""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li onmouseover=""$('fp2').fade( {duration:.2, from:1, to:0.8 }); return false;"" onmouseout=""$('fp2').appear( {duration:.2}); return false;"" style=""border-left:1px solid #000;border-right:1px solid #000;""&gt;&lt;img src=""{{skin url='myimage2'}}"" id=""fp2""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li onmouseover=""$('fp3').fade( {duration:.2, from:1, to:0.8 }); return false;"" onmouseout=""$('fp3').appear( {duration:.2}); return false;""&gt;&lt;img src=""{{skin url='myimage3'}}"" id=""fp3""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<p>So it's 3 times the same in this list, and I have it twice. I don't know how to do the syntax in the js, and how to refer to it in the html.</p>

<p>I prepared a working example, so but the math first.</p>

<p>I have some points and I want to check if they are above or below a curve...
The curve has the function <code>y=1/(x-.5)</code>
So I thought I will set the function to 0 and get <code>0=1/(x-.5)-y</code></p>

<p>Afterwards I will get negative values if the point is on one side of the curve, and positive values on the other side... Hope this is right so far...</p>

<p>I realised a problem, if the x values is smaller then .5, then the part below 1/ gets negative and all my values are also negative...</p>

<p>I added a special point (5) which gives the expected positive value, but how about the other ones, how should I test those?
Thanks for help!</p>

<p>I was thinking about making a table in every module header file with references (\ref and \anchor) to the relevant code lines, a description, etc. The first problem is: I can't use the Doxygen markdown table feature, because then the description has to be in one line, because Doxygen tables don't support line breaking. So I thought about using a simple verbatim table, what do you think?</p>

<p>Or is there a way to generate such a table automatically?</p>

<p>I need to get various hardware information such as RAM serial number, hard drive SN, CPU SN, etc. I am using Visual C++ 2010 and using WMI to query for the information, but it's not giving me what I want. For example, I started trying to get RAM SN, and after querying for it (I used Win32_PhysicalMemory then I get the property ""SerialNumber""), I get </p>

<pre><code>SerialNumber
SerNum0
SerNum1
</code></pre>

<p>which is obviously not it. I also went to the command line for it (wmic memorychip get serialnumber), but I get the same thing. But I know the serial number is there; when I use a 3rd party program CPU-Z, it retrieves the RAM serial numbers flawlessly. </p>

<p>Am I querying the wrong class? Is there anything I'm missing? I have tried the executable I made on multiple other computers, with mixed results of success and failure--but CPU-Z never fails.</p>

<p>I am developing in Visual Studio C++ 2010 on Windows 7 64 bit computer. Thanks.</p>

<p>The question is, am I doing things wrong? What could make it fail? I tried debugging this camera the entire day, and haven't figured out what makes it fail.</p>

<h3>Clarifications</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>This is how I understood <em>rotation</em>: a 3D vector (maybe improperly called vector), where each component means the axis around which the object rotates. For example, the X value would be how much the object rotates around the X axis. Because I am working in OpenGL, rotation values will be in <em>degrees</em> (not radians).</p></li>
<li><p>When rendering the camera, I simply translate the camera position, but with opposite sign. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Same applies for rotation:</p>

<pre><code>glRotatef(-currentCamera-&gt;Rotation().X, 1.0f, 0, 0);
glRotatef(-currentCamera-&gt;Rotation().Y, 0, 1.0f, 0);
glRotatef(-currentCamera-&gt;Rotation().Z, 0, 0, 1.0f);
glTranslatef(-currentCamera-&gt;Position().X, -currentCamera-&gt;Position().Y, -currentCamera-&gt;Position().Z);
</code></pre>

<h3>What I tried (and didn't work):</h3>

<p>I tried using simple geometry and mathematics, using Pythagoras theorem, and simple trigonometry, but it failed miserably, so I stopped trying to get this working. (e.g. NaN result if any of the rotation coordinates was 0).</p>

<h3>What I tried (and did work... almost):</h3>

<p>Using transformation matrices.</p>

<p>When the user presses any of those keys, a 3d vector is generated: </p>

<pre><code>+X = right; -X = left
+Y = top; -Y = bottom
+Z = backward (towards camera); -Z = forward (away from camera)
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I generate a transformation matrix: the identity (4x4 matrix) is multiplied by the rotation matrix 3 times, for each of the 3 coordinates (X then Y then Z). Next, I apply the matrix to the vector I created, and I add the result to the old position of the camera.</p>

<p>However, there seems to be a problem with this approach. At first it works just fine, but after a while, when I press Up it goes sideways instead of the way it should.</p>

<h3>Actual code</h3>

<p>As I stated above, I tried to use as little code as possible. However if this is not helpful enough, here is some actual code. I did my best to select only the most relevant code.</p>

<pre><code>// ... Many headers

// 'Camera' is a class, which, among other things, it has (things relevant here):
// * Position() getter, SetPosition() setter
// * Rotation() getter, SetRotation() setter

// The position and rotation are stored in another class (template), 'Vector3D &lt;typename T&gt;',
// which has X, Y and Z values. It also implements a '+' operator.

float angle; // this is for animating our little cubes
Camera* currentCamera;

// 'Matrix' is a template, which contains a 4x4 array of a generic type, which is public and
// called M. It also implements addition/subtraction operators, and multiplication. The 
// constructor memset's the array to 0.

// Generates a matrix with 1.0 on the main diagonal
Matrix&lt;float&gt; IdentityMatrix()
{
    Matrix&lt;float&gt; res;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)
        res.M[i][i] = 1.0f;

    return res;
}

// I used the OpenGL documentation about glRotate() to write this
Matrix&lt;float&gt; RotationMatrix (float angle, float x, float y, float z)
{
    Matrix&lt;float&gt; res;

    // Normalize; x, y and z must be smaller than 1
    if (abs(x) &gt; 1 || abs(y) &gt; 1 || abs(z) &gt; 1)
    {
        // My own implementation of max which allows 3 parameters
        float M = Math::Max(abs(x), abs(y), abs(z)); 
        x /= M; y /= M; z /= M;
    }

    // Vars
    float s = Math::SinD(angle); // SinD and CosD convert the angle to degrees
    float c = Math::CosD(angle); // before calling the standard library sin and cos

    // Vector
    res.M[0][0] = x * x * (1 - c) + c;
    res.M[0][1] = x * y * (1 - c) - z * s;
    res.M[0][2] = x * z * (1 - c) + y * s;
    res.M[1][0] = y * x * (1 - c) + z * s;
    res.M[1][1] = y * y * (1 - c) + c;
    res.M[1][2] = y * z * (1 - c) - x * s;
    res.M[2][0] = x * z * (1 - c) - y * s;
    res.M[2][1] = y * z * (1 - c) + x * s;
    res.M[2][2] = z * z * (1 - c) + c;
    res.M[3][3] = 1.0f;

    return res;

// Used wikipedia for this one :)

{

<p>Now a trip includes two cities. 
One city witch is allready stored in db (objectId != null)
and an other city witch have to get persist (objectId == null)</p>

<p>Although hibernate now have to know that city1 is already persist an only city2 have to get persist in city- table i get a ""duplicate entity exception"". Hibernate will store the existing city again.
To slove that I overrive the generic save method of my tripDao and handle the city persisting manual. -> just save city if city.getId() == null.
So I get a not stored trip object witch includes two already stored citys. If i try to persist that trip object I get the hibernate message </p>

From the iOS Simular and regular browsers I can reach it well. </p>

<p>From my Android Virtual Device (emulator64-arm, Android 4.2.2, native browser) on the same OSX (Yosemite) host I only get unformatted text and links, no image. - see below.
 cannot inspect elements inside the virtual device so no help there. 
When I load the site using the host name site.dev as stored in etc/hosts on the host (OSX) I get nothing at all. Only by ip at least I can load a broken site.</p>

<p>That is with this Vagrantfile:</p>

<pre><code># -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|

    config.vm.box = ""scotch/box""
    config.vm.network ""private_network"", ip: ""192.168.33.10""
    config.vm.hostname = ""scotchbox""
    config.vm.synced_folder ""."", ""/var/www"", :nfs =&gt; { :mount_options =&gt; [""dmode=777"",""fmode=666""] }

end
</code></pre>

<p>I changed from a private to public network to see if I could load a whole site from my Virtual Device.This is the Vagrantfile after the small tweak:</p>

<pre><code># -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|

    config.vm.box = ""scotch/box""
    config.vm.network ""public_network"", ip: ""192.168.33.10""
    config.vm.hostname = ""scotchbox""
    config.vm.synced_folder ""."", ""/var/www"", :nfs =&gt; { :mount_options =&gt; [""dmode=777"",""fmode=666""] }

end
</code></pre>

<p>When I ran <code>vagrant reload</code> with <code>public_network</code> instead of <code>private_network</code> I see</p>

<pre><code>vagrant@127.0.0.1's password:password

</code></pre>

<p>I picked one being on a wireless network.. Not sure if that was the best choice .. But then I was told:</p>

<pre><code>NFS requires a host-only network to be created.
Please add a host-only network to the machine (with either DHCP or a
static IP) for NFS to work.
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas why I cannot just load the site on my Virtual Device from Android Studio using the <em>initial</em> Vagrantfile setup? Localhost loaded just fine on <code>10.0.2.2</code>. How to fix this issue?</p>

<p>My current approach has the link on the pages and loads via ajax the correct backend page (e.g. System > Configuration > Design). For this approach I created a Controller which extends the Mage_Adminhtml_Controller_Action. This Controller get the params from the ajax request and uses an action (like the editAction of the class Mage_Adminhtml_System_ConfigController) to get the right config page in the backend.</p>

<p>My Problems are:
- showing only the correct Area (I just want the user to edit only the section ""themes"" under System > Configuration > Design) everything else should be not available... so how to remove all the information around this config section?</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;template-&gt;categories = $this-&gt;category-&gt;getSubtree(1);

<p>And because I'm using the Nette Framework, I'm using Latte template engine, such is very similar with Smarty. For render all categories with parents and childrens I have this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;ul class=""tree""&gt;
    {block #categories}
        {foreach $categories as $node}
            &lt;li&gt;

    {/block}
&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>My biggest problem is how to make css style if I want three and more level menu. If is selected some category is his subcategories shown and another categories hide. When is picked some subcategories is showing his subcategories and another subcategories hide and so on. Really thanks for advance and I'm sorry for my english. Hope you know what i mean.</p>

<p>Some of this is borrowed from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/13226043/2948942"">Create a JS class: IIFE vs return prototype</a></p>

    Car.prototype.getColor = function() {

})();

var car1 = new Car();
var car2 = new Car();

<p>car2's color also gets changed to purple.</p>

<pre><code>car1.newColor('purple');

The operation in the code below completes without throwing anything and appears to work - that is, when I requeried the ContactsContract.Contact table, a row came back with the name changed.  However, when I tried running the stock ""people"" app on my tablet, it crashed.  Evidentally I did something wrong.</p>

<p>Here is the code.  Early on, it fetches an id from the aggregate contacts as follows, where <em>key</em> is the lookup_key:</p>

<pre><code>  String[] projection = new String[] {
    Contacts._ID, // 0
    Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME, // 1
  };

  Uri uri = Uri.parse (Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI + ""/"" + key);
  ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
  Cursor cursor = cr.query (uri, projection, null, null, null);
  if (!cursor.moveToNext()) // move to first (and only) row.
    throw new IllegalStateException (""contact no longer exists for key"");
  origId = cursor.getLong(0);
  cursor.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Then, after the user has done his edits, I call this block of code to update the display_name:</p>

<pre><code>  ArrayList&lt;ContentProviderOperation&gt; opers = new ArrayList&lt;ContentProviderOperation&gt;();
  ContentProviderOperation.Builder builder = null;

  String[] args = { Long.toString (origId) };
  builder = ContentProviderOperation.newUpdate (Data.CONTENT_URI);
  builder.withSelection (RawContacts.CONTACT_ID + ""=?"", args);
  builder.withValue(CommonDataKinds.StructuredName.DISPLAY_NAME, name);
  opers.add(builder.build());

  ContentProviderResult[] results = null;
  try {
    results = getContentResolver().applyBatch(ContactsContract.AUTHORITY, opers);
  } catch ...
</code></pre>

<p>I realize I don't need the ContentProviderOperation for this example; that's for later when I have more stuff to update.</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm pretty confused about which ID I'm actually using.   The names aren't that clear to me and I may be using the wrong ID for this operation.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, looking at <em>results</em> after the update I saw a result code of 5.  I can't find any documentation for that, so have no idea if that is significant.  </p>

<p>I'm writing a PHP script that access a users Gmail calendar.  I first wrote it using Zend and it was fantastic, but found that I have to use the Oauth to get to tasks - therefore I rewrote it for Oauth instead.</p>

<p>In order to use Oauth I have to go to my API console and set up the account and then I have access and everything works great.  Here is my problem: I can't ask every single user to go through this somewhat technical step of creating a key and all of that just so my app can work with their Gmail.</p>

<p>Zend was really easy, the user provides me with their name and password and I have access.  Now I don't see any way to change accounts using the Oauth method, all of the credentials are for a SINGLE Gmail account (as far as I can tell).</p>

<p>Is there a way to do what I'm trying to do without making the users go through fifteen hoops to allow me access?  I would like to register my app and get my keys, then be able to point to ANY Gmail account, the user grant me access, and I'm in.  Otherwise each user has to go to the API console in their own Gmail, create branding, create a key and then create a server ID, THEN provide that all to me so I can plug it in and THEN redirect them back to Google so they can say ""yes, I accept this"".  That's a lot of steps to integrate.</p>

<p>I hope this was clear enough :).</p>

<pre><code>// Do some IO stuff on a background thread
Promise&lt;ExtractionResult&gt; extractDataPromise = Akka.future(new Callable&lt;ExtractionResult&gt;(){
    @Override
    public ExtractionResult call() throws Exception {

        return null;
    }
});

// Perform a couple computations based on the result

    new Function&lt;ExtractionResult, MyResult&gt;(){
        public MyResult apply(ExtractionResult er){
            return longRunningComputation();
        }

        public Result apply(ExtractionResult er){
            return longRunningComputation();

    }
)

// Synchronize back up to make the result
Promise.sequence(longRunningComputation1, longRunningComputation2).flatMap(
    // Do something with the results
)

<p>From what I've read in the documentation, you cannot inturrupt an actor in the middle of its execution, that is, I could not cancel the chain above in the middle of performning the IO or in the middle of the longRunningComputation.  Would it be possible to cancel the entire operation <em>between</em> the chained calls?  That is, if the user made a cancel request, could I set a flag that the operations could check to essentially become no-ops and return a null result?  Is there another recommended way to cancel long-running service requests?</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to both Play and the underlying Akka framework, so I'm open to suggestions.  Thanks</p>

When the application is closed via the QMainWindow's close event, or by using QApplication.quit(), the UI disappears and then I get a Windows dialog ""python.exe has stopped working"".</p>

<p>The QApplication hosts a custom QMainWindow class, which contains a custom QWidget (which handles all the UI tasks, with QMainWindow handling messaging between threads - the app records keystrokes and writes output files in background threads). There is also a timer running the the main QWidget that updates a LineEdit with the current position in the video.</p>

<p>The crash happens whether files are being written or not (code commented out).</p>

<p>Do I need to be performing some type of garbage collection, or perhaps disposing of my objects in a specific order? I've tried stopping the timer, setting the MediaPlayer, the Instance, and the frame that hosts the MediaPlayer all to None, and then detroying the frame (self.videoFrame.destroy()), but the app still crashes. </p>

<p>The basic code was based on the example Qt application from vlc's repo <a href=""http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/bindings/python.git;a=blob;f=examples/qtvlc.py;h=34aeedce116e05f575eb0ebffdacf8f06db80402;hb=HEAD"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>, which has no special garbage collection or disposal of objects.</p>

<p>Am I going about this all wrong?  Below is the code.</p>

<p>xml code</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;TextView
        android:id=""@+id/q1Image""

        android:layout_weight="".1""
        android:textSize=""8sp""
        android:gravity=""center_horizontal"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>java code</p>

<pre><code>q1Image.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.red_x);

<p>Those project are built around an existing application server (closed source, binary only). The application server consist of about 300 files / 140 mb. The version of the application server <em>can</em> change 6 times a year (if new features/bugfixes are needed)
The developer needs this application server in order to test(integration tests) the development. </p>

<p>Most of those projects have references to some assemblies of this application server (i.e. in order to make a connection). There are about 15 files, for which we create NuGet packages which are hosted by our self. </p>

<p>Some projects may have references to official nugget packages. </p>

<p>Some projects may have references to 3rth party assemblies which are in a “lib” folder and are part of the solution. The lib folder is also part of the git repository. </p>

<h1>Question:</h1>

<p>Where and how should we put the application server files?</p>

<h2>Version 1:</h2>

<p>Put into an app folder next to the lib folder and add it to the git repository. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pro: Developer can just git checkout and is ready to start the app
server. Developer can work offline.  </li>
<li>Cons: Lot of binary files in git
repository. Will result in a huge git repository.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2:</h2>

<p>Put a robocopy script into post build event, and copy the app server after successful build from a network share or internet. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pro: Developer can just git checkout, build solution and is ready to
start the app server. Git repository will remain lightweight.</li>
<li>Cons: Developer need to be connected to the network/internet,
otherwise the post build event will fail, and therefore the whole
build will fail. It is slow if the developer checkout a lot of
different branches, since it will download the application server for
every checkout.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Should we go with one of the above mentioned versions? 
Are there other possibilities/best practices how such a scenario can be solved?</strong> </p>

First I have admit, however, that I am quite a newbie to data science and building prediction models in R.</p>

<p>My Data:</p>

<ol>
<li>A sparse matrix (dim 237 x 43232) that contains 237 users and if they liked one of the 43232 fb-pages or not (indicated by 1 for liked and 0 for not-liked). The row-names contain user.ids.</li>
<li>A data.frame with columns containing the user.ids, age, gender, and several survey scores, for this example lets take the SOP2 score (optimism-pessimism score).</li>
</ol>

<p>My goal is to predict the SOP2 score with the user likes. Kosinski et al. describe their model building in <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802/F1.expansion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this graphic</a>. So far I have done a SVD using the irlab R package:</p>

<pre><code>Comps.likes &lt;- irlba(Likes.matrix, nu = 100, nv = 100)
</code></pre>

<p>And this is where I am stuck .. how to go on from here?</p>

<p>From what I assume I should get to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>fit &lt;- lm(SOP2 ~ Comps.likes$d, data = someDataFrame)
</code></pre>

<p>or an equivalent using the caret package.</p>

<p>What I am trying to figure out:</p>

<ol>
<li>The step missing is how to get from the Comps.likes (SVD step) to
the regression formula with a coefficient for each Facebook like to
predict SOP2.</li>
<li>The step to actually predict SOP2 from a user vector
with the likes per user.id.</li>
</ol>

<p>So my boss wanted me to create an OpenLDAP Database, and automatically import the Users from the ZimbraLDAP every 6 hours or so and link our Synology to this new OpenLDAP, which would also be a safe enviroment for our inters to work with LDAP.</p>

<p>Before you ask, I cant change the Zimbra OpenLDAP for varanty reasons.</p>

<p>So everything worked splendidly, the User where imported and the Synology could finally see these users. However, the password did not work. After looking over the export files i realized that Zimbra uses SSHA512 to hash the passwords, which isnt recognized by my OpenLDAP. </p>

<p>However, i cant seem to find any way of installing patches for it, since apparently OpenLDAP changed its structure and every information i found was outdated.</p>

<p>Does anybody know of an easy way to teach OpenLDAP SSHA512 with a recent installation?</p>
