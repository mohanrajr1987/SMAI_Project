<p>I have a database on my laptop that I would like my class mate to connect to remotely.  We set up an ad-hoc wireless connection but everytime he tries to test the connection to my database it always fails and we get a ""Failed to connect to MySQL at 192.168.1.2:3307 with user root"".</p>

<p>We tried connecting with root, a user that we created on my mysql, I just don't know anymore. I want to cry now.</p>

<p>Do you know how I can set the VBV buffer size in the code? In fact, when I use ffplay to display the streamed video, ffplay doesn't show anything for short videos but for long videos, it start displaying the video immediately. So, it looks like ffplay needs a buffer to be filled up by some amount so that it can start displaying the stream. Am I right?</p>

Each shape needs to be able to be dragged and dropped within the bounds of the div, independently.  Upon double clicking a shape, that shape needs to rotate 90 degrees.  It may then be dragged and dropped and rotated again.</p>

<p>I've loaded some code onto fiddler: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/QRZMS/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/QRZMS/</a>.  It's basically this:</p>

<pre><code>    window.onload = function () {

        var angle = 0;

        var R = Raphael(""paper"", ""100%"", ""100%""),
            shape1 = R.rect(100, 100, 100, 50).attr({ fill: ""red"", stroke: ""none"" }),
            shape2 = R.rect(200, 200, 100, 50).attr({ fill: ""green"", stroke: ""none"" }),
            shape3 = R.rect(300, 300, 100, 50).attr({ fill: ""blue"", stroke: ""none"" }),
            shape4 = R.rect(400, 400, 100, 50).attr({ fill: ""black"", stroke: ""none"" });
        var start = function () {
            this.ox = this.attr(""x"");
            this.oy = this.attr(""y"");
        },
        move = function (dx, dy) {
            this.attr({ x: this.ox + dx, y: this.oy + dy });
        },
        up = function () {

        };
        R.set(shape1, shape2, shape3, shape4).drag(move, start, up).dblclick(function(){
            angle -= 90;
            shape1.stop().animate({ transform: ""r"" + angle }, 1000, ""&lt;&gt;"");
        });


    }
</code></pre>

<p>The drag and drop is working and also one of the shapes rotates on double click.  However, there are two issues/questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I attach the rotation onto each shape automatically without having to hard-code each item reference into the rotate method?  I.e. I just want to draw the shapes once, then have them all automatically exposed to the same behaviour, so they can each be dragged/dropped/rotated independently without having to explicitly apply that behaviour to each shape.</p></li>
<li><p>After a shape has been rotated, it no longer drags correctly - as if the drag mouse movement relates to the original orientation of the shape rather than updating when the shape is rotated.  How can I get this to work correctly so that shapes can just be dragged and rotated many times, seamlessley?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Many thanks for any pointers!</p>

In a <code>Display</code> attribute we store the key in the <code>Name</code> property and using the custom <code>DataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider</code> we substitute the key for a string value from our custom CMS. The problem is that we now have two sets of values. One for Web views and one for mobile views. At runtime we check if the client is on a mobile device and substitute the values accordingly.</p>

<p>After test running this setup I came across a strange issue. When the <code>AppDomain</code> is first created and the <code>Name</code> properties of the different data annotations are replaced with the string values, everything works fine. In debug, when I enter the custom <code>DataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider</code> for a second time, I see the name properties already populated with the values I had substituted the previous run. This was strange to me, since it was my understanding that data annotation propeties could not be chnaged at runtime. It now seems like there is a model metadata cache happening somewhere. Since I based my custom solution on replacing the values each time the <code>DataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider</code> is called upon, I would like to disable this caching, if possible.</p>

<p>For now I started using the <code>ShortName</code> property as my key storing property and I replace the <code>Name</code> property, and this way I can repopulate the strings on each run. But this was not the initial design and I don't have such a key store property for <code>ValidationAttributes</code>.</p>

<p>So is there a way to disable this cache? I don't need the cache for the sake of caching, since all CMS data is cached in memory in another layer anyway.</p>

Ideally of course, configuring the port to use on the Java client and making sure that it's always going to be the same.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> the Java client uses Maven to set-up the runtime configuration (and port number of the service).  The annoyance here is that the <code>pom.xml</code> file has to be edited before testing.</p>

<p>The question is actually: is there a scheme using MSBuild or some kind of IDE setting that allows for the .NET Web Service, Local Azure Environment, to shutdown when debugging stops in the IDE?</p>

<p>The end state of this configuration would be to be able to Debug the .NET Web Service, run the Java client, and shutdown everything - then be able to repeat this process without having to mess with the taskbar or modify the client's <code>pom.xml</code> file.</p>

I want to ensure that a subsequent execution of <code>a</code> waits until <code>b</code> is completed, which is triggered by the current execution of <code>a</code>. In other words, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are to be executed alternatively. I tried to do this using mutex and condition variable as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def a
  Thread.new do
    $mutex.synchronize do
      puts ""a""
      b
      $cv.wait($mutex)
    end
  end
end

def b
  Thread.new do
    sleep(rand)
    $mutex.synchronize do
      puts ""b""
      $cv.signal
    end
  end
end

$mutex, $cv = Mutex.new, ConditionVariable.new
loop{a; sleep(rand)}
</code></pre>

<p>In this code, <code>$mutex.synchronize do ... end</code> in method <code>a</code> ensures that <code>$cv.signal</code> (also within another <code>$mutex.synchronize do ... end</code>) in method <code>b</code> is not invoked until <code>$cv.wait($mutex)</code> sets <code>$cv</code> into listening mode for signals. This much is given in <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/thread/rdoc/ConditionVariable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the document</a>.</p>

<p>Another function I intended to assign to <code>$mutex.synchronize do ... end</code> in method <code>a</code> is to avoid consecutive execution of method <code>a</code>. My reasoning is that <code>$cv.wait($mutex)</code> in method <code>a</code> should avoid <code>$mutex</code> from being completed and released until <code>$cv.signal</code> in method <code>b</code> is invoked, by which time <code>b</code> should be finished.</p>

<p>I expected that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are executed alternatively, thereby printing <code>""a""</code> and <code>""b""</code> alternatively. But in reality, they are not; each of <code>""a""</code> or <code>""b""</code> can be printed consecutively.</p>

<hr>

<p>After that, I thought that my reasoning above may be wrong in the sense that <code>$mutex</code> is rather completed and released even if <code>$cv</code> (or <code>$mutex</code>) is in waiting mode, once <code>$cv.wait($mutex)</code> has been <strong>called</strong>. So I added some dummy process to <code>a</code>, changing it to:</p>

<pre><code>def a
  Thread.new do
    $mutex.synchronize do
      puts ""a""
      b
      $cv.wait($mutex)
      nil # Dummy process intended to keep `$mutex` locked until `$cv` is released
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>but that did not have effect.</p>

<hr>

<p>How can this be fixed? Or, what am I wrong about this?</p>

<p>I changed height to width again and it deploys properly. File encoding-type is UTF-8 in both cases. Any guesses or solution to this? If you need any further information, I would love to share.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Most of the time, even though you change the file encoding type to URF-8, it doesn't recognize it. Best way is to forcefully ask appcfg.py to treat your file with UTF-8 encoding format. You can do it by changing mime_type of the file format in app.yaml like this:</p>

<pre><code>- url: /(.*\.(css$))
  static_files: \1
  upload: (.*\.(css$))
  mime_type: text/css; charset=UTF-8
</code></pre>

<p>By this way, your file will be treated as UTF-8 and your deployment will not fail.</p>

<p>I`m facing a situation that's really new to me. I'll try to make things simple explaining it 
step by step.</p>

<p>1)In page A (User's form), I'm getting some values from the fields and sending it as jQuery AJAX POST to page B. This is the main piece of code and it's working fine:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() { 

var options = { 
    target:        '#my-container',
    dataType:      'html',   
    beforeSubmit:  showRequest,  // pre-submit callback 
    success:       processOK,  // post-submit callback 
    error:         processError,
    clearForm:     false
}; 

// bind form using 'ajaxForm' 
$('#myForm').ajaxForm(options); 
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>I'm defining ""url action"" and ""method as POST"" directly in the form definition.</p>

<p>2) Page B is receiving the POST values from page A correctly and using it to make another POST to page C, but this time using cURL. At this time, everything still working as desired. I can read the response in page B, and it's fine. Here is the code:</p>

<p>PAGE B CODE:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$cURL = curl_init('http://200.201.194.133/exampleurl/MakeCall.php');
curl_setopt($cURL, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

 $dados = array(
    'type' =&gt; '0',
            'dest' =&gt; $_POST[""dest""],
            'content' =&gt; $_POST[""content""],
            'priority' =&gt; '-1',
    'return' =&gt; '1',
    'answer' =&gt; '40',
    'ringtime' =&gt; '26',
    'psid' =&gt; 'ct1253117',
    'ctid' =&gt; '9'
);

curl_setopt($cURL, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($cURL, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $dados);

$result = curl_exec($cURL);
curl_close($cURL);
echo ""&lt;span class='response'&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;""; 
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>3) Here comes the problem, When page B receives de response from page C, it displays the response in the browser, and I need this response to be sent do page A where a can capture it in de jQuery AJAX callback functions. Page A (User's form) needs to be visible all time.</p>

<p>I've spent all my day trying to solve this problem before ask for help. So, I'll be very glad if anyone can help me with this situation. Alternative solution is welcome too.</p>

<p>EDITED:(Original function - this way it don't work, I don't know why, even adding the line ""return false"").</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() { 

var options = { 
    target:        '#my-container',
    dataType:      'html',   
    beforeSubmit:  showRequest,  // pre-submit callback 
    success:       processOK,  // post-submit callback 
    error:         processError,
    clearForm:     false
}; 

// bind form using 'ajaxForm' 
$('#myForm').ajaxForm(options); 
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>CHANGED TO: (now it works - attention to the line ""return false;"", it's important) </p>

<pre><code>$(""#myForm"").submit(function(e)
{
var formURL = $(this).attr(""action"");
$.ajax(
{
    url : formURL,
    type: ""POST"",
    success:function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) 
    {
        alert(""success"");
        alert(data);
    },
    error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) 
    {
        alert(""fail"");    
    }
});
//STOP default action
return false;
});

<p>I have a light barrier consisting of 2 photo-transistors. I want to detect the peaks of these barriers with the android headphone jack. I need to know the time between these.
I´ve got a amplifier cicuit for it already, so the peaks are pretty steep now.</p>

<p>My approach is to use the AudioRecord class, scan through the buffer, find the rising edge, start a timer and stop it after the second peak.
That´s kinda working already, but only for times around 100ms.
What I need is to measure precisely in the 1-10ms region. The peak is maybe around 0.1ms wide.
I call the peak detect funktion every 0.01ms, but i noticed, that it hast around 3000 values in its buffer to scan through this. I think that it takes too long to scan through these.</p>

<p>Am I stuck on the wrong approach? Is there a more easy way to do this? It just hast to be fast ;-).</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Kgf8a/"" rel=""nofollow"">JS Fiddle of Image #2 (overflow using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>)</a>.</p>

<p>Herein lies my problem: I want <code>#inner</code> (the blue box) to remain fixed at the bottom of <code>#outer</code> (the red box) regardless of scroll -- an effect similar to using <code>position:fixed</code> on a div that has <code>height:100%</code>. But I want to achieve the effect using a div that has a set height that is not 100%.</p>

<p>I feel like there is a very simple solution to this, but I cannot figure it out.</p>

<p>The c:forEach tag provides a var attribute which I want to use inside the tiles:insertAttribute but it turns to be not visible inside the tiles JSP:</p>

<p>But typescript is supposed to more object-oriented, and I was expecting <strong>this</strong> in typescript to point to the class instance. But it does work just as in JS. So I have to use construction</p>

<p>Any clue what i'm doing wrong.
I've been playing around with no foreign keys. making one of the required lists optional.
they all result in different errors.
mostly saying that the relation needs to be a 1:1 relation.
And once it said that it had a non nullable field.</p>

<p>I made that nullable int? and then i got the first error again.</p>

<p>After spending some time Googling i found this: <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/google-web-toolkit@googlegroups.com/msg79537.html"">http://www.mail-archive.com/google-web-toolkit@googlegroups.com/msg79537.html</a></p>

<p>There an interesting hint was given: it occured if you <strong>disconnect your WLAN and connect again</strong> - then the error arises. I tried this on my notebook - then the exception occurs.</p>

<p>Another problem is this exception <strong>arises sometimes</strong> (not really always at the same time or when executing a specific action - so <strong>seemingly random</strong>) <strong>although the network connection is fine</strong>. I don't know why this happens nor what's the correct way to handle it - sure I can catch and ignore it. But the request never goes to the server and the action is not executed - not quite a good error handling.</p>

<p>Some data about this app - maybe this helps narrowing or hopefully solving the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>GWT 2.4 with Sencha GXT 3.0.1</li>
<li>Occurs on all the top browsers in newest version: IE, Chrome, Firefox</li>
<li>Using <a href=""http://www.cloudflare.com"">Cloudflare</a> (<strong>I also tried without it - but it's the same problem. So this seems not to be originated by using this Proxy-Service.</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks a lot for every hint and every idea how to handle/solve this.</p>

<p>So as far as i'm aware, given a single point (P1) and C2's point and radius it is possible to quite easily get 2 possible points of tangency for C2 and P1 to make 2 line equations. But as i don't have P1, only the knowledge that the point will be one of a possible 2 points on C1, i'm not sure how to calculate this.</p>

<p>I assume it will be something along the lines of getting the 2 tangent line equations of C1 that are equal to the same of C2.</p>

<p>Both circles can have any radius, they could be the same or they could be hugely different. They will also never overlap (they can still touch though). And I'm looking for the 2 possible internal tangents.</p>

<p>I have a website(web forms, asp.net 4.5), which i have build-ed to my friend, and i don't know how can i do something, </p>

<p>I need when someone clicks a button then the website read a text file, lets say something like that :</p>

<pre><code>var xml = XDocument.Load(xmlplace + ""\\AppSettings.xml"");
            string place = xml.Element(""Settings"").Element(""App"").Attribute(""Dir"").Value.ToString();
            string temname = Template1.Text;
           HTMLTEXT.Text = File.ReadAllText(place + ""/"" + temname + "".html"");
</code></pre>

<p>HTMLTEXT = a textbox in the website, where all the text file information go. </p>

<p>Now, this function works 100%. its perfect. but then my freind ask me to do something else.. </p>

<p>he gave me this text :</p>

<pre><code>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 

//this arena
Show only this
Show only this
//end Arena

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
</code></pre>

<p>and he wanted me to take all the texts from the file, but show only the //this arena text, where //this arena is the start and // end arena is the end of it. </p>

<p>I really have no idea how to use IO for this, or any other way. Any one have any idea?</p>

<p>BTW, if i didn't expline my self, please tell me so i can changed and try to explain better. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If you can also tell me how can i save the file back with the changes, it will be great, thanks.</p>

The reason for this is that I need to draw them at various different sizes in different places, and, while I could do this with multiple textures, it is impractical to do so.</p>

<p>My problem is that XNA does not seem to antialias these Texture2D objects upon scaling them down. I have set:</p>

<pre><code>graphics.PreferMultiSampling = true;
</code></pre>

<p>and also</p>

<pre><code>spriteBatch.Begin(SpriteBlendMode.AlphaBlend);

<p>But to no avail. I have also tried various things involving the filters in the GraphicsDevice but, to be honest, without really knowing what I was doing.</p>

<p>Obviously, I'm drawing this using a spriteBatch, but aside from that, nothing particularly interesting in the way I'm drawing it.</p>

<p>Here is an (enlarged) example of what's happening, and what I'm trying to make happen:</p>

<h2>The example I understand</h2>

<p>Early in the video, We’re told that there’s a problem with this code:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxdO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The problem with this code: the use of callback on line 11 and 14 won’t work because it’s out of scope — <em>onSuccess</em> exists in the <em>buildCRUD</em> scope, not the <em>create</em> scope. (I'll call this the ""callback example"".)</p>

<p>OK, that makes sense to me. Solutions are considered including using a single class variable (I know this terminology is off because javascript doesn't have classes, but you know what I mean).</p>

<h2>The example I don't understand</h2>

<p>Here's where I'm confused. At the end of the video, we're told that this code for a different part of the function will work. (Notice the <em>""className""</em> variable parameter; I'll call this the ""className example"".)</p>

<p>(Sorry, I cut off the line that says ""var ..."", just trust me that it's up there and <em>createFn</em>, <em>getFn</em>, etc. are all being declared as part of a long ""var"" line.)</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/thVk8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, the implementation of these functions such as <em>createFn</em> do use the <em>className</em> variable, though it wasn't passed into the function as a parameter.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IIVrU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here's my question: <strong>why is <em>className</em> in scope inside <em>createFn</em>?</strong> It seems to me that it’s no more in the <em>forClass</em> scope than <em>onSuccess</em> was in the create scope.</p>

<p>Does this have something to do with...</p>

<ul>
<li>the fact that the function in the callback example is never being assigned as a variable inside the create function context, only called?</li>
<li>the callback example using promises?</li>

<p>I want to be able to pass a callback to a function that performs a slow process in the background, and have it called later when the process is complete. This callback could be a free function, a static function, or a member function. I'd also like to be able to inject some arbitrary arguments in there for context. (ie. Implementing a very poor man's coroutine, in a way.) On top of that, this function will always take a std::string, which is the output of the process. I don't mind if the position of this argument in the final callback parameter list is fixed.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that the answer will involve boost::bind and boost::function but I can't work out the precise invocations that would be necessary in order to create arbitrary callables (while currying them to just take a single string), store them in the background process, and invoke the callable correctly with the string parameter.</p>

<p>I did some research and it seems that Memory mapped files is the fastest available possibility, however I would need to proprietary implement the whole communication stack around it (allocation and management of shared memory, copying messages into it and from it and signaling to consumers that new message is ready to be consumed).
I came across the picture showing architecture of IPC methods on Windows (<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/salvapatuel/archive/2009/06/08/working-with-memory-mapped-files-in-net-4.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/salvapatuel/archive/2009/06/08/working-with-memory-mapped-files-in-net-4.aspx</a>) and it seems that those methods already uses MMF.
So by what I described - wouldn't I actually reinvent the wheel by re-implementing what Named Pipes already does. Or can I actually achieve significantly faster protocol than what named pipes can offer? </p>

<p>Here is what we have.</p>

<p>You start on an HTTP page that when you click a link will open a modal window. The first link from an HTTP page when clicked will repopulate the modal with an iFrame that links to an HTTPS page. Since I can't have the HTTPS talk to the HTTP page I'm using a <code>document.location</code> setting on the HTTPS iframe page to make the success page HTTP. Then the HTTP page talks back to the parent window.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>HTTP (click) -> Opens iFrame in HTTPS -> Login over HTTPS secure on Success <code>document.location</code> -> HTTP success page -> <code>window.parent.success_msg(deferred);</code> calls to the parent window.</p>

<p>It's working great in all browsers so far...haven't tested IE yet, but I wanted to verify this wasn't a really terrible practice before I present it.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was wondering how to set up a created thread to be GC'd. I made a simple multithreaded server to accept connections from the client, but each time a client connects, the memory usage grows by about 80k... understandable. Problem is that I don't know how to come back down from that quick growth after the client and server disconnect.</p>

<p>Here's the main class that sets up the thread:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

   try {
    serverSock= new ServerSocket(9999);
   } catch (IOException e1) {
    // TODO Auto-generated catch block
    e1.printStackTrace();
   }

   while (true){
    try {
     Thread t = new server(serverSock.accept());
     t.start();
     t = null;
    } catch (IOException e) {
     // TODO Auto-generated catch block
     e.printStackTrace();
    }
   }

  }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the basic server thread:</p>

<pre><code> public class server extends Thread {
 private Socket serverSocket = null;
 public static String command = null;

 public server(Socket serverSocket2) {
  super(""server"");
  serverSocket = serverSocket2;
 }


 @Override
 public void run(){
  BufferedReader fromClient = null;
  PrintStream toClient = null;
  String line = null;
  String[] user = new String[2];

  try {
   serverSocket.setSoTimeout(10000);
   fromClient = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(serverSocket.getInputStream()));
   toClient = new PrintStream(serverSocket.getOutputStream());
   System.out.println(""Got connection"");
            System.out.println(""Terminating server"");
   fromClient.close();
   toClient.close();
   serverSocket.close()
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
   // TODO Auto-generated catch block
   e.printStackTrace();
  } catch (IOException e) {
   System.out.println(""Connection established, but timeout on"" +
     "" message recieve may have occured"");
   e.printStackTrace();
  }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how exactly would I allow this thread to just... die and go away, rather than causing the memory leak that is currently occurring?</p>

<p>Also, I'm new to Java - never mind using threads, so if it's obvious, please try to be nice about it. Thanks for any help you can provide!</p>

<p>I've tried commenting out my entire default profile as the warning mentions ""profile"", but that didn't help.  I've also tried commenting out my reporting options and the warning still shows up.  </p>

<p>I've ran maven with the <code>-X</code> flag and the warning shows up immediately after my hamcrest dependency is brought in, but commenting it out doesn't eliminate the warning.</p>

<p>Peter was right about the problem.  The problem stems from not having an <code>id</code> element within a maven profile.  In my case, a pom file was being pulled in because of my miglayout dependency.  </p>

<p>Upon looking through the dependent pom's, I found that miglayout, indeed, does not use <code>id</code>'s in its profiles:</p>

<p>When the column is updated with value 08/01/2014 12:00:00, it is read as 08/01/2014 11:00:00.  If I use a date that does not fall within DST (such as 12/01/2014 12:00:00), it reads the date correctly.  Any ideas on this?  I have been searching all over but have not found any documentation on this issue.  I may have to switch back to the Oracle.DataAccess, but was hoping to avoid it.  Thanks in advance!</p>

The problem we have is that it seems there's no option for use to preauthenticate the calls. Here seems the only option is to have the OAuth flow where the user needs to explicitely give the ok the google request.</p>

<p>For the Directory API we've been able to use this approach <a href=""https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation#create_the_service_account_and_its_credentials"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation#create_the_service_account_and_its_credentials</a> but this does't seem to be available for the Contacts API.</p>

<p>If you run cmder on windows, there is a <a href=""https://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/config/prompt.lua"" rel=""nofollow"">nice lua script</a> to customize your prompt:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>These two scripts do not play very nicely with each other.  <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/clink/wiki/Documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">Clink has an API</a> that seems like I could use to incorporate the change from <code>activate.bat</code>, but I cannot figure out how to call it from a batch file.</p>

<p>My overall goal is to merge these two prompts into the nicer Cmder-style.  My thought is to create an environment variable, change <code>activate.bat</code> to check for the existence of the variable, and, if so, call the Clink API to change the prompt instead of <code>set PROMPT</code>.  At that point I would think I could create a new filter to cleanly merge the value in.  I can't figure out how to call the API from the batch file, though.</p>

<p>Other solutions welcome.</p>

<p>EDIT: Partial, non-working solution</p>

<pre><code>require ""os"" -- added to top of file, rest in filter function
local sub = os.getenv(""CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV"")
if sub == nil then
    sub = """"
end
print(sub)

<p>I added a {conda} in the prompt definition at the very beginning; removed the prompt statement from <code>activate.bat</code>, and added this to <code>git_prompt_filter</code>.  Prior to using activate, everything is fine - the <code>{conda}</code> gets suppressed by the <code>''</code>.  However, if I use activate and switch into a folder with a git repo to trigger the change, I see:</p>

<p><code>{conda}C:\...</code></p>

<p>Does <code>os.getenv</code> not get user set variables?  Don't know what else the problem would be.  I also tried adding a print, it doesn't print out the contents of <code>CONDA...</code> either.</p>

In some functions we have to decide, if the viewer is the owner.</p>

<p>We couldn't use the usual function for this purpose:<br>
<code>return gadgets.util.getUrlParameters().viewer == gadgets.util.getUrlParameters().owner;</code>
so we had to create a workaround and get the information via a DataRequest.</p>

<p>The DataRequest calls a callback function and has no  useable return value.
We tried a quick hack by using global variables to set the corresponding value.</p>

<p>The issue at this point is, that the function does not 'wait' for the callback-function to be finished. We know this is no good code/style at all, but we tried to force a timeout for debug reasons.</p>

<p>Handling all the code within the callback-function (as suggested in the examples of the opensocial docs) is not possible.
We are looking for something like a real 'sleep()' in JavaScript to wait for the callback-function to complete or another alternative to get the owner information about the viewer.</p>

<pre><code>globalWorkaroundIsOwner = false;  

function show_teaser(){  
  if (current_user_is_owner()){  
    // ...  
  }  
  // ...  
}

  req.add(req.newFetchPersonRequest(opensocial.DataRequest.PersonId.VIEWER), 'viewer');  

  // This will set the the correct value  
  req.send( user_is_owner_workaround );  

  // This is an attempt to delay the return of the value.  
  // An alert() at this point delays the return as wanted.  
  window.setTimeout(""empty()"", 2000);  

  // This return seems to be called too early (the variable is false)  
  return globalWorkaroundIsOwner;  
}  

function user_is_owner_workaround(dataResponse) {

I have a hunch that it has something to do with the Yadis document not being found.  My site's realm shoots off a 302 Found status code, so I thought this might be the problem and set it up to have an ""Accept"" request header which can be fed the Yadis document type (""application/xrds+xml"").

No other plugins seem to manipulate that area, and the closest one (Sidebar Link Plugin) adds actions (links) so that does not help me.
Does anyone have any idea?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
I've found out that you would need to use xmlns:l=""/lib/layout"", and should write into ""&lt;l:side-panel&gt;"". However, it does not seem to do anything so far. It does not even throw an exception or any failure in compilation.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>
I've more or less given up on the idea, instead I'll just create a floating JavaScript/CSS window on the left side. This can be achieved easily by using the ""Simple Theme"" plugin, and using JS and CSS files to inject the data you want presented anywhere.
In case you are interested in the CSS and JS, I will post an example.</p>

<p>CSS</p>

<pre><code>.class-name
{
    position:fixed;
    background:#C0C0C0;
    border:1px solid #000000;
    width:20%;
    z-index:1000;
}
class-name h3
{
    display:block;
    margin:0 0.5em;
}
</code></pre>

<p>JS</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function()
{
    window.document.body.onload = CreateTable();
};  

function CreateTable()
{
    var main_table = document.getElementById(""main-table"");
    var row = main_table.insertRow(0);
    var cell = row.insertCell(0);
    cell.innerHTML = '&lt;div class=""class-name""&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example Title&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';
}

<p>Other question regarding the same: I am not using JSON validation, but the normal client side validation. Why it does not work when I remove the                 definition?</p>

<p>I guess it is because maybe jsonValidationWorkflowStack inherits from other validation interceptor. If it is, perhaps it is convenient to define the other one, instead of jsonValidationWorkflowStack.</p>

<p>I'm analyzing biological data with python.</p>

<p>I've written down a code to find matching substrings within a list of lists of long strings.</p>

<p>The substrings are in a list and have length of 7 nucleotides.</p>

<p>So in the list, from AAAAAAA to TTTTTTT, 16384 motifs(substrings) are present, permutating A,C,G,T.</p>

<p>This code has a for loop for the list of substrings and the list of lists of long strings nested inside.</p>

<p>It works ok, but because of the list of lists with 12000lines, the code processes very slowly.</p>

<p>In other words, to give info about AAAAAAA and to the next which is AAAAAAC takes 2 mins.</p>

<p>so it will take 16384 motifs to go through 12000 lines for 2 mins, it will take (16384*2 == 32768 min -> 546 hours -> 22days...)</p>

<p>I'm using scipy and numpy to get Pvalues.</p>

<p>What I want to is counting number of presence and absence of substrings in list of sequences </p>

<p>The list of long strings and the code are like this:</p>

<pre><code>list_of_lists_long  =  [
[BGN,    -0.054,     AGGCAGCTGCAGCCACCGCGGGGCCTCAGTGGGGGTCTCTGG....]

<p>Is there any faster logic to proceed the code much faster??</p>

<p>I need your help!</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>=====================================</p>

<p>Is there any easier method, without implementing any other things?</p>

<p>I think the iteration for pattern match is the problem...</p>

<p>what I'm trying to find is BOTH how many times a length 7 motif occurs in the whole list of sequences AND NOT OCCURS ALSO!!!. So if a motif is present in a string, which is TRUE as bool, then increment a value AND FALSE, then increment an other value.</p>

<p>NOT the number of motifs within a string.</p>

However, sometimes I notice that there's loss of data. The data is not detected by the reader! Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Here's how I am creating the pipes:</p>

<pre><code>void create_pipes(string pipename){

    char * cstr1 = new char [pipename.length()+1];
    strcpy (cstr1, pipename.c_str());

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Creating "" &lt;&lt; pipename &lt;&lt; "" pipe..."" &lt;&lt; endl;
    unlink (cstr1); // Delete pipe
    int result = mkfifo (cstr1, S_IRUSR| S_IWUSR);  // Create Pipe
    if( result == -1 ){
         cout &lt;&lt; ""There was en error creating the pipe! "" &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; endl;
         //return 0;
    }
    else
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Pipe created!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I have a thread that reads the pipe like this:</p>

<pre><code>     int fd = open(cstr1, O_RDONLY);  // Open the pipe


    while( running_threads ){

        if(!read(fd, buf, MAX_BUF))
            continue;
        string line(buf);
        if( buf != """" ){
            //cout &lt;&lt; line;
            pipe_r.DECODE_PIPE_DATA(line);
        }
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Thread terminated"" &lt;&lt; endl;

    close(fd);
</code></pre>

<p>In python I'm simply writing the data to the pipe by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>def write_pipe(file_string):
    while True:
        try:
            pipe.write(file_string)
            pipe.flush()
            break
        except:
            print ""Error while writing to pipe""
            continue
</code></pre>

<p>What could be causing my problem? The python program writes the data into the pipe successfully; But the c++ program sometimes will not read the pipe. Can this be caused by the python process writing data faster than the c++ program before it could actually read it? What should I do?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The problem is that the default library used (stdlibc++) has type_traits defined as 'tr1/type_traits', whereas boost::spirit expects just 'type_traits'. I can of course fix this problem by doing:</p>

<pre><code> clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ &lt;...&gt;

<p>While I would love to use libc++, the practicality of doing so is difficult (many libraries still use and depend on stdlibc++). Thus, I am forced to not use libc++.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? I really wish that either more library maintainers support libc++ or that Apple provided a newer version of stdlibc++. It's been a major frustration to have access to new c++11 features, but not be able to fully use them due to lack of library support.</p>

I've determined that the sf2 event dispatcher/listener system is the best way to handle this, but I've run into something of a snag in trying to configure my listener to handle many different events.</p>

<p>The (now outdated) documentation I've found in my searches seems to indicate that at one point, event listeners could register on multiple events, but the code has been refactored, and now the configuration looks something like this:</p>

<p><code>config.yml:</code></p>

<pre><code>services:
  social.listener:
    class: F\Q\C\N\SocialEventListener
    tags:
      - { name: kernel.listener, event: onSocialShare }
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Easily pass multiple events (something like <code>event: [onSocialShare, onSocialFriend, onSocialCreate]</code> works, but that feels like it will quickly get ugly and unmaintainable, clogging up my config file with potentially dozens of social events</li>
<li>Define the event to which I want to subscribe from code (as was done previously)</li>
<li>Or possibly another, better option that I haven't thought of yet</li>
</ol>

<p>I have an application where the classes flow like so:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AmpAB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I'm currently trying to allow my Client class and Server class to have access to instances of each other that are created in MyApp's main. The issue is that the instances are created in main (thus making them static) and I'm wondering how to properly pass them to the other classes as what I've done doesn't seem like it is the right way.</p>

<p>Here is what I've done:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyApp {
    private static RedClient red_client = null;
    private static BlueClient blue_client = null;
    private static RedServer red_server = null;
    private static BlueServer blue_server = null;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Client myClient = new Client(arg1, arg2);
        red_client = myClient.getRedClient();
        blue_client = myClient.getBlueClient();

        final Server myServer = new Server(arg3, arg4);
        red_server = myServer.getRedServer();
        blue_server = myServer.getBlueServer();
    }

    public static RedClient getRedClient() {
        return red_Client;
    }

    public static BlueClient getBlueClient() {
        return blue_client;
    }

    public static RedServer getRedServer() {
        return red_server;
    }

    public static BlueServer getBlueServer() {
        return blue_server;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I would later make use of the following like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class Client {
    public void SomeMethod {
        MyApp.getBlueServer.doSomething(myObject);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm just unsure if this is a proper way of passing the instance to the other class as Client and Server both communicate with MyApp. (Please ignore the class names as they have nothing to do with functionality of the application, I just used them as names because it was the first thing I could think of).</p>

<p>If you need any clarification let me know, as I'm open to learning and criticisms. If this is the wrong way, can you please explain why it is wrong and then explain the proper way. </p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>Further clarification:</p>

<ul>
<li>MyApp has access to Client &amp; Server </li>
<li>Client has access to RedClient &amp; BlueClient </li>
<li>Server has access to RedServer &amp; BlueServer</li>
</ul>

<p>No other classes have access to each other.</p>

The encrypted value is being passed via the querystring, but I've run a test looping through values 0 to 200 to rule out problems with url encoding.</p>

<p>Encryption and decryption functions:</p>

<p>I've tried keeping the iv value identical across encryption and decryption but this doesn't change the output. I've also tried removing the <code>trim()</code> around <code>trim($decoded)</code> but that didn't change anything either.</p>

<p>Below is what I used to identify the problem. Between 0 and 200 the encryption will produce a value ending on %3D%3D 9 times and result in the decryption failing.</p>

<pre><code>for($i=0;$i&lt;200;$i++) {
    echo encryptValue($i) . ""&lt;br/&gt;"";
    echo decryptValue(encryptValue($i)) . ""&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;"";

I followed all the instructions to implement it but when I try to load the ViewController that came with the code (using a UITableView cell), I get an Apple Mach-o Linker Error when I try to build and/or run the code saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:
    ""_OBJC_CLASS_$_ColorPickerViewController"", referenced from:
        objc-class-ref in ClockSettingsViewController.o
  ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All I'm doing is loading the view into the hierarchy at the point of the crash (the next line is the one that I present the view).  I built every part separately in xcode and found that this line of code is the source of the error:</p>

<pre><code> ColorPickerViewController *colorView = [[ColorPickerViewController alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>And that code is sitting here:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

    if (indexPath.row == 0) {
        ColorPickerViewController *colorView = [[ColorPickerViewController alloc] init];
        [self presentViewController:colorView animated:YES completion:nil];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have used this method for opening views hundreds of times (in fact, it is the only way I've ever used), so I know that it can't be the code itself, and I checked everywhere and I imported everything I needed.  What is wrong and what does the error mean so I can fix it in the future.  Thanks in advanced.</p>

<p>I have recently been involved in a translation project. The goal was to translate the strings of an MVC framework to the Greek language.</p>

<p>70% of the language strings of the framework where translated, however 30% where intentionally left out. The decision was that <em>we will not translate error messages aimed towards the developer of the application</em>.</p>

<p>The reasoning behind this (in short) was:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>are aimed towards designers/programmers.
Programmers ( and even designers :) ) should have a basic
understanding of English, at least enough so
they can search on it on Google if
they do not know what it means. (racist?)</p></li>
<li><p>are aimed towards the developer
and in a perfect world should not be
displayed to the end user of the
application as they concern the
inner workings of the web
application itself. i.e ""You must
set the database name in your
database config file.""</p></li>
<li><p>and perhaps most <strong>importantly</strong>,
they make the life of the developer
harder when he tries to get more
information/help regarding the
error. For example the above error
yields 8 results in Google (in
quotes), whereas its Greek
translation yields exactly 0.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know that this depends on the popularity of the target translation language and the application itself. For example I'm guessing that there are is vast amount of documentation regarding German SAP error messages (i know, i know, SAP IS German, but you get the point), as opposed to Greek Error Messages documentation regarding random application X which has about 500 installations worldwide.</p>

<p>So to summarize: When you develop language translation packs for your applications do you translate error messages? Do you only do for predominant languages like English/Spanish/German/French? Or do you leave them intact? I'm not looking for the ""right"" or ""correct"" answer, I'm looking for a ""best-practices"" answer, or if this problem is defined in any ""official"" standard/policy that you have had experience with. </p>

<p>Thus, I'm essentially doing the same aggregate calculation <code>sum(units_sold)</code> twice in the same query:</p>

<pre><code>select
    store_location,
    sales_date - extract(day from sales_date) + 1 as sales_month,
    sum(units_sold) as monthly_sales,   /* I already calculated this!  How to re-use? */
    case when sum(units_sold) &gt; 10000 then 1 else 0 end as exceeded_10000 

from
    daily_sales

where
    sales_date between '2012-01-01' and '2012-12-31' and
    store_location in (
        select
            store_location
        from (
                select
                    store_location,
                    sales_date - extract(day from sales_date) + 1 as sales_month,
                    case when sum(units_sold) &gt; 10000 then 1 else 0 end as exceeded_10000   /* evaluated per month, per store */
                from
                    daily_sales
                where
                    sales_date between '2012-01-01' and '2012-12-31'
                group by
                    store_location,
                    sales_date - extract(day from sales_date) + 1
        ) a
        group by
            store_location
        having
            sum(exceeded_10000) &gt; 6   /* which stores had 6 months over 10000 ? */ 
    )

group by
    store_location,
    sales_date - extract(day from sales_date) + 1
</code></pre>

<p>This seems inefficient -- I've already computed <code>sum(units_sold)</code> by month in the inner (filtering) query, but I can't figure out a way to re-use those monthly totals.  You'll note that query b does NOT group by month, by necessity, since it is adding up the number of months in which sales exceeded 10,000 -- that's the aggregate of an aggregate I refer to in the title.</p>

<p>Teradata does not support the PIVOT function, and I'd prefer not to use a massive series of CASE WHEN's to emulate a pivot and then check each month on a single row.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make this query more efficient?  To re-use the monthly sales totals I already calculated in the inner query?  Could it be simplified on a different RDBMS platform instead of Teradata?  Thank you.</p>

<pre><code>begin transaction

<p>When multiple processes execute the code above simultaneously(like the client issues a lot of identical requests at a same time), a lot of 'new_data' will be inserted while actually only one is needed. </p>

<p>I think it's a quite typical scenario of concurrency, but still I can't figure out a decent way to avoid it. Things I can think about maybe like having a single worker process to do the select_or_insert job, or maybe set the isolation level to Serializable(unacceptable). But neither is quite satisfactory to me. </p>

<p>I've spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to coax this answer out of Google, and I give up.  There must be some way to run a Qt (4.5 if that matters) application in some other language without switching over my entire locale to get there.</p>

I wrote a test to check accesDenied and it raises an UsernameNotFoundException, which it should, yet it does not follow the exception to the @ControllerAdvice class which returns a JSON.</p>

<p>The code works correctly in execution, returning the Json, and in other test cases like AuthenticationFailed - whcih is also handled by an exception -, the Json is return on running the test. The json is not return in this case, maybe because I have a custom UserDetailsService?</p>

<p>I've seen on the internet, others just test if exception was raised, and call the day. Yet I'd like the test to return same behaviour as execution - the Json. Is it possible? What am I missing?</p>

<p>I tried similar questions' answers but they didn't work, same behaviour was returned.</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated. Thx in advance,

<p>Essentially, I'm looking do an advanced find and replace. The replace I'm sure I can figure out when it comes to it, but right now I can't get the find to work.</p>

<p>In an application, there are a lot of htm files being loaded. The user chooses a file and performs an action with it. After this action is done, I want the system to scan the file one more time to ensure there aren't issues. For example, this string could be present in the htm file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?strange_tag_start 
     name=""var_value"" ?&gt;Name&lt;?strange_tag_end ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And, yes, it could be broken across lines like this. The above isn't a problem unless this happens:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?strange_tag_start 
     name=""var_value"" ?&gt;&lt;?strange_tag_start 
     name=""var_value"" ?&gt;Name&lt;?strange_tag_end ?&gt;&lt;?strange_tag_end ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The line breaks could be different. What I want to do is search the document for strings that contain <code>&lt;?strange_tag</code> then contain <code>&lt;?strange_tag_end ?&gt;</code>. After if it find those, I want to check within the string whether there is either another <code>&lt;?strange_tag_start</code> or another <code>&lt;?strange_tag_end ?&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I initially tried reading the file and getting every index of the specific values then attempting to compare them. However, the following could be present in the file, and these are perfectly ok, but the system finds them and flags them for me:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?strange_tag_start 
     name=""var_value"" ?&gt;Name&lt;?strange_tag_end ?&gt; There is other text here
and some more text on another line. Then this &lt;?strange_tag_start name=""var_value""
             ?&gt;Name&lt;?strange_tag_end ?&gt; is present.

<p>What it boils down to is a system (such as is present in some applications) where the beginning of a string is specified, the end of the string is specified, and then the system checks to see if it contains a string.</p>

<p>If this doesn't make sense or you need more clarification, I can do that.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Let me clarify with this. I have the following multiline string:</p>

<pre><code>I want to preserve&lt;?start_foo  
                bar=""value"" ?&gt; the content  
&lt;?start_baz qux=""value"" ?&gt;Name  
&lt;?end-baz_qux ?&gt;that is between weird tags.
</code></pre>

<p>I want to find <code>&lt;?start_foo bar=""value""</code>
I also want to find <code>&lt;?end-baz_qux ?&gt;</code> (Note: There could be two of these right next to each other.)
After finding those, I want to check if inside that string is another <code>&lt;?start_foo bar=</code> (Note: The ""value"" in that tag could be different as well.)
Then I want to remove the middle content that is not suppose to be there so I end up with:</p>

<pre><code>I want to preserve&lt;?start_foo  
                bar=""value"" ?&gt; the content 
&lt;?end-baz_qux ?&gt;that is between weird tags.
</code></pre>

<p>Here's another example to hopefully make it clearer:</p>

<pre><code>Back &lt;?rh-udv_start name=""ctrl_btn"" ?&gt;&lt;?rh-udv_start name=""ctrl_btn"" 
    ?&gt;button&lt;?rh-udv_end ?&gt;&lt;?rh-udv_end ?&gt; to
</code></pre>

<p>After doing the search, I should end up with this:</p>

<pre><code>Back &lt;?rh-udv_start name=""ctrl_btn"" ?&gt;button&lt;?rh-udv_end ?&gt; to
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, I'm looking for a way to say:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a string that ""begins"" (misleading as the ""begin"" could be in the middle of the string) with VALUE_X.</li>
<li>If found, find VALUE_Y after it (this should always be found if there is a VALUE_X).</li>
<li>Check after the VALUE_Y to see if there is another VALUE_Y.</li>
<li>Check inside the string of VALUE_X through VALUE_Y to see if contains another VALUE_X.</li>
<li>If there is another VALUE_X, delete it. If there is a VALUE_Y <em>immediately</em> after VALUE_Y, delete the second VALUE_Y.</li>
</ol>

<p>This doesn't work in a Karma test since all of the files are broken down into individual units and tested separately.  The <code>$scope.myReferencedObject.someProperty</code> reference is undefined in my ""child"" controller when unit tested because there is no prototypal inheritance.</p>

        list.add(""element3"");
        list.add(""element4"");
    }

    public List&lt;String&gt; getList() {

<p>when I use a4j:commandLink to remove element, it works as its expected, but when I use a4j:jsFunction to invoke actionListener it invokes action against last element :(

contacts. </li>
<li>Each row has 3 horizontal sections: a photo that is constant, content x and content y (this last one is out of the screen and is invisible)</li>
<li>And I wish that when the user swipes a single item
from right to left, the content (with information x) fades out. The
other content (with information Y) slides in from out of the screen,
with right to left orientation, at the same time.</li>
<li>When the user
swipes back (from left to right) the content y swipes out again and
the initial content x fades in.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just can't to this, so I'm asking your help please.

<p>Is it possible to insert something like this:</p>

<p>And then just instantiate and use the types available in M.</p>

NGINX + uWSGI + Flask
on a CentOS 6.x server</p>

<p>but I still have some doubts in terms of configuration:</p>

<p>1) I am running NGINX as a service: service nginx start/stop/restart<br/>
if I type ""ps aux | grep nginx"", I can see 2 processes:<br/>
- (by user root) master process /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf<br/>
- (by user nginx) worker process<br/>
is that OK?</p>

<p>2) I setup a virtualenv for Flask and installed the uWSGI package under such virtualenv.<br/>
Currenty I am starting the uWSGI manually by typing ""uwsgi /somedir/uwsgi.ini"", where uwsgi.ini is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>chdir = /myappdir
uid = pyuser
chmod-socket = 666
socket = /tmp/uwsgi.sock
module = run
callable = app
virtualenv = /myappdir/myvirtualenv
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to start uWSGI as a service, similarly to NGINX (as described at point 1) ? Is such case should the user be root or non-root?</p>

<p>3) When I start the uWSGI, I am currently getting the following warning:</p>

<pre><code>*** Python threads support is disabled. You can enable it with --enable-threads ***
</code></pre>

<p>I realized that in the ""uwsgi.ini"" configuration file you can also configure a number of processes and threads. Considering the server I am running has just 1 core, can I set up multiple processes and threads? and if so, how many?</p>

<p>3b) On the NGINX configuration file ""/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"" it is also possible to specify ""worker_processes"", which by default are 1. Can I increase that, or it can be higher than 1 only for multicore servers?</p>

<p>4) Beside the threads support disabled, when I start the uWSGI I also get these warnings. What do they mean?</p>

<pre><code>*** WARNING: you are running uWSGI without its master process manager ***
*** Operational MODE: single process ***
*** uWSGI is running in multiple interpreter mode ***

<p>I have a slider and I'm trying to use css transitions to slide the items left or right</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""slider""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""el1"" class=""element""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=""el3"" class=""element active""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=""el5"" class=""element""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All <code>.element</code>s are hidden except the <code>.active</code> one. To go to the next slide, I position it <code>left:100%</code> and then use <code>transform: translateX(-100%);</code>together with <code>transition:transform 5s ease</code> to have it slide into place. I do the same with the <code>.active</code> slide. I do all of this by adding separate classes with the appropriate styles with jQuery.</p>

<p>This works fine with the active slide, but the next one just jumps into place, here's the full code:</p>

  $(next).addClass('next move-left');
  active.addClass('move-left');
});
$('#prev').on('click', function() {
  var prev = slider.children().get(active.index() - 1);
  $(prev).addClass('prev move-right');

I can write my own view which behaves like UIActionSheet. But, UIActionSheet by itself has some standard behavior like blocking orientation events. We might not be aware of such things. So, for safety purpose, it is better to have UIActionSheet itself; by replacing all its views with my custom view.</p>

<p>For this I have done the following things:
1. Create UIActionSheet. Call showOnView: on that action sheet.
2. Set the delegate as myController
3. In the delegate method willPresentActionSheet: remove all the subviews and add my custom view as action-sheet's sub-view</p>

<p>The problem is that I cannot get the animation affect of Action Sheet with my custom view, Because,UIActionSheet is animated before calling willPresentActionSheet (in showInView). If I override showInView and add my own animation I might miss the behavior like:
1. Blocking orientation events
2. Some of the views (the argument of showInView:) might no support orientation. I should be able to apply same orientation to my action-sheet in showInView.</p>

<p>Could someone help me out in achieving customization?</p>

<ol>
<li><code>std::bind</code> perfectly forwards both the callable object it wraps and the arguments to that callable object;</li>
<li>the <code>std::bind</code> return object is itself movable and/or copyable, depending on whether the callable object and its arguments are movable and/or copyable;</li>
<li>a <code>std::bind</code> return object may be nested, in which case the outer <code>std::bind</code> return object is movable and/or copyable, just as when binding other callable objects.</li>

<p>Each of the two problem line spews errors without the other. To eliminate all errors, I must comment out both lines.</p>

<p>What's going on? Do I misunderstand <code>std::bind</code>?</p>

<ol>
<li>bind a callable object? and</li>
<li>pass that <code>std::bind</code> return object to a function taking a universal reference? and</li>
<li>nest that <code>std::bind</code> return object in another <code>std::bind</code>?</li>
</ol>

<p>My goal is for the underlying callable object and its arguments to be perfectly forwarded.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To clarify, I want to pass the wrapped callable object and its arguments by value, not by reference, so <code>std::ref</code> won't help—at least, not as a full solution. The reason is that my real code is more complex and involves passing the <code>f</code> <code>std::bind</code> return object across a thread boundary, and both the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> <code>std::bind</code> return objects may go out of scope in the original thread before <code>call_handler</code> calls <code>f()</code>, so <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> need to copy or move into <code>f</code>, not be mere references. That said, my question is specifically about <code>std::bind</code> and perfect forwarding, and for the purpose of asking a good question, I've distilled out everything not needed to reproduce the specific compiler errors I mentioned.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I'm pretty new to Unit Testing so bear with me.</p>

<p>I realize that best best practice is not to auto generate unit tests, however I'd like to use Code Generation to set-up the basic skeleton of the tests.</p>

<p>Now, I know Visual Studio 2008 already has the built in ""create tests"", however, it just creates a flat list of all the classes it's going to test... and it's not for NUnit right?</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like the code generation to follow the folder AND namespace structure of the assembly its generating tests for.</p>

<p>Can you guys recommend any good tools which generate NUnit unit tests for .NET assemblies in Visual Studio 2008?</p>

<p>cheers!</p>

<p>The idea is that the code inside the consumer <em>may</em> throw a checked exception, and if it does so, then it will be converted to a runtime exception.</p>

<p>The interfaces:</p>

<pre><code>@FunctionalInterface

    @Override
    default void accept(final T t) {
        toRuntimeException(() -&gt; wrappingAccept(t));

    void wrappingAccept(final T t) throws Exception;

    static void toRuntimeException(final ExceptionRunnable exceptionRunnable) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(exceptionRunnable);
        try {
            exceptionRunnable.run();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            throw new RuntimeException(ex);
        }
    }
}

@FunctionalInterface
interface ExceptionRunnable {
    abstract void run() throws Exception;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The testing class:</p>

<pre><code>public class WrappingConsumerProject {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WrappingConsumer&lt;Integer&gt; wrappingConsumer = WrappingConsumerProject::test; //Works
        Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; consumer = wrappingConsumer;  //Works

        testConsume(wrappingConsumer);  //Works
        testConsume(consumer);  //Works

        testConsume(WrappingConsumerProject::test); //Fails
        testConsume((Consumer&lt;Integer&gt;)WrappingConsumerProject::test);  //Fails
    }

    private static void test(Integer integer) throws IOException { }

    private static void testConsume(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; consumer) { }

<p>For testing purposes I lowered the gravity.
I believe that nothing is out of scope, nor is there a needed bind, but yet it alludes me to why the particles are not drawing.
In addition, I also added a geometry shader that constructs a quad around each point but it did not solve anything.</p>

<p>Right now, if I add an action message within my action (in a JSON action), I will pick that up in JavaScript and capture the action message and alert the user via JGrowl.  However, I don't want the logic of adding an action message in each action.  I have an underlying service project with a request context that is shared among the request, and I am able to add warning messages there.  What I'd like to do is to transform those warning messages to action messages for use on my front end, but the action will never have to be aware of them.  This is useful because I can insert warnings when accessing databases, or if there are hairy business rules, etc.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, it already works when adding them directly in the action so I know the JSON result works fine and passes along the action messages correctly.  We have an interceptor that is hit every time for managing this request context already, so I'd like to append on the action messages in this interceptor to the action being called.  </p>

<p>However, the problem I'm finding is that I need to call actionInvocation.invoke() first as any warning messages will be generated as a result of that.  After that, I check for the messages and attempt to apply them as action messages.  These action messages never show up in my JSON response, so I'm wondering if it's possible to add those messages into the response in the interceptor AFTER the invoke() call.  Here's the bulk of my intercept method:</p>

<pre><code>    try {           
        // Invoke the action.
        String result = actionInvocation.invoke();

        //add all warning messages as an action message to be displayed on that front end
        if (CollectionUtils.isNotEmpty(context.getWarningMessages())) {

            ActionSupport action = (ActionSupport) actionInvocation.getAction();

            for (String s : context.getWarningMessages()) {
                action.addActionError(s);
            }
        }

        return result;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried adding the logic to add the action messages in the finally block instead of after the call to invoke() to no avail.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/12517519/699305"">this question</a> that asks how to direct stdout+stderr to a file and still get stderr on the terminal; it's close, but I don't want to redirect stdout to a file yet: The program's output will be consumed by other scripts, so I'd like it to remain on stdout (and same for stderr). So, to summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Script produces output in fd 1, errors in fd 2.</li>
<li>I want the calling program to rearrange things so that output+errors appear in fd 1, errors in fd 2. </li>
<li>Also, errors should be interleaved with output (as much as their own buffering allows), not saved and added at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due-diligence notes: Capturing stderr is easy enough with <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code>. Saving and viewing stdout is easy enough by piping through <code>tee</code>. I also know how to divert stdout to a file and direct stderr through a pipe: <code>command 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;fileA | tee fileB.</code> But how do I duplicate stderr and put stdout back in fd 1?</p>

socket.on('message', function(data) {
    console.log('MESSAGE ' + (++messageNumber));

<p>The above code is able to receive messages, as I checked by the following sender code:</p>

<pre><code>var dgram = require('dgram');

var socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
var address = '127.0.0.1';

setInterval(function() {
    socket.send(new Buffer('hello'), 0, 5, 4353, address);
}, 1000);

<p>Now I'm starting another receiver while the first one is still running (using the same code above). I would expect one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The second bind should fail (most probably).</li>
<li>The second bind should succeed and both will receive the messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the following discussion the first option is the correct assuming node.js not using SO_REUSEPORT by default:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4364434/let-two-udp-servers-listen-on-the-same-port"">Let two UDP-servers listen on the same port?</a></p>

<p>However what happens is that it doesn't fail, and only the last receiver gets the sender's messages. If I close the last receiver, the first one starts getting the messages again.</p>

<p>What's going on here?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It seems that there are differences between machines. On Ubuntu machine I got the phenomenon described above. On Windows machine I got that the FIRST receiver gets the sender's messages (and again, when closing that receiver the other one starts receiving the messages). The common for both cases is that only one receiver receives the messages and the other one has no indication about that the port is in use (neither exception nor error - I tried also registering to ""error"" event).</p>

  after the user restarts the browser. The new URL does not need to be 
  absolute; if it's relative, it's resolved relative to the current URL.
  The new URL must be  of the same origin as the current URL; otherwise,
  pushState() will throw an exception.  This parameter is optional; if
  it isn't specified, it's set to the document's current URL.</p>

I got it working without any problems on my laptop but it doesn't work on my pc (windows 7). On both I have the same version of STS, Maven and other plugins like GWT etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that on PC maven has connection problems (Unable to update index for central|<a href=""https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</a>) - that is a massage I saw earlier unfortunately I can not reproduce it now it continoiusly tries to update but nothing happens even after 2 hours of waiting (laptop updates within seconds from eclipse start) Both computers use same router, same network, same connection type wifi. I disabled all firewalls etc. </p>

<p>Second problem is that I want to use GWT-maven-plugin to start project. Eclipse had no problem in  adding the archetype but when I try to actualy set up a maven project with this archetype this error occurs in errorlog:</p>

<p>Error downloading archetype org.codehaus.mojo:gwt-maven-plugin:2.7.0</p>

<p>I get that it would be easier to install software to do this automatically but at the same time it is much more efficient to manipulate what is already installed on ones computers as it saves a significant amount of memory and processing power when compared to getting additional software.

<p>The error message above is written to the console but isn't detectable programmatically:</p>

<p>After running the Enable-SPFeature command, $? is $true, $Error has no errors and $LastExitCode has nothing.</p>

<p>Trying to capture the exception with either try/catch or trap fails.  For the lines below, the error message is still dumped to console but ""Error caught!"" is never displayed:</p>

<p>We are looking into our feature activation code and we do know how to fix this on the server but it's crazy that I can't detect this error programmatically.   The exception is throw by the cmdlet Enable-SPFeature but PowerShell isn't wrapping the exception in an ErrorRecord, isn't writing it to the error pipeline or doing anything useful.  I've been using PowerShell pretty extensively since Monad Beta 2 came out and have seen a lot of funky things but this shakes my confidence in it.

I've a fair understanding of java networking, but all networking I've done up to this point has been send a command-> wait for a response-> repeat. Recently I've been trying something in my spare time that's a bit different.
I'd like to connect to a Mud, and I use a standard mud client. However, I got to thinking and decided I'd see if I could create a server which would then connect to the mud (so, I'd use my client to connect to the intermediate server, which would then connect to the mud proper). Mostly this was just to see if I could at first (a few friends and I wanted to set up outside game chat etc), but I've been encountering a few issues and now want to resolve them for future reference, since they seem fairly important.</p>

<p>So far, I set up a ServerSocket, accept a client connection, generate BufferedReaders/PrintWriters to hold input and output streams (inside a thread for each new connection). I then generate a second thread inside that client thread to connect to the mud, which then constantly loops reading lines and outputting them to the output stream of the client thread. The client thread loops waiting for command input, and processes it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this approach is appropriate (as I mentioned, I've never done Socket programming where input and output had to be handled at the same time). The main problem is that the output simply stops after a few lines, though. The server connects to the mud fine, and it prints about  12 or so lines of a login screen (I can clarify this number if its important, double line spacing makes it questionable).
I looked around and a few mentions in other questions mentioned needing to send a sequence of bytes (telnet negotiation? I'm not familiar with the term) to avoid similar problems, but I couldn't find much concrete information about the issue.</p>

<p>I'm fairly sure its a technicality I'm not aware of, but if anyone could point me to some resources or supply a general solution or such, that'd be great.</p>

I can view the site and a list from a browser, and I've added an API user as a site admin and an O365 admin. I keep getting a 401 error when calling <code>ClientContext.ExecuteQuery()</code>. Any advice is appreciated.</p>

<p>I don't know whether I'm hitting the wrong URL or the user doesn't have rights, or maybe it's something totally different. I've tested the username and password, as it gives me a different error about an invalid user if I use the wrong password.  So, I'm pretty sure that I have the right credentials. The user has been set as an O365 admin and has been granted ""Edit"" rights to the SharePoint site through that console. I've even tried using my own credentials, and I'm the one that created the site.</p>

<p>My goal is to eventually get list items from a particular list.  However, since I can't do this much, I haven't gotten too far.</p>

<p>Here's some sample code from a console app:</p>

<pre><code>ClientContext cc;
SecureString pw;

cc = new ClientContext(""http://XXXX.sharepoint.com"");
pw = new SecureString();
""XXXX"".ToCharArray().ToList().ForEach(c =&gt; pw.AppendChar(c));
cc.Credentials = new SharePointOnlineCredentials(""api@XXXX.onmicrosoft.com"", pw);
cc.Load(cc.Web);
cc.ExecuteQuery();

<p>When I exit the html editor, tinymce messes up my code, ""fixing"" my code using like this:</p>

<pre><code>@foreach (dynamic item in Model.PagamentosEmAtraso) {}

<p>However I have an issue that is unlike most of the problems which come with having to use Outlook as an HTML email editor.</p>

<p>I have an application which outputs HTML, which in turn gets emailed to various people. The HTML formats fine and everything looks dandy. What I need to do is embed a guid into a HTML table so that they are not visible, but survive the paste into Word. Ideally this data would be non visible so it can't be easily discovered in email editor. (Its just a guid, so having users able to find it would just make the mail ugly.)</p>

<p>Word seems to transform the HTML so that there is no CSS, nor any attributes appear to be maintained. (Eg, id="""")</p>

<p>You can do things like set the font-size to 0, which on a browser means it's not rendered, however Word does render it. Also if you copy paste it into Excel its easily seen, even if the foreground colour is set to the background colour.</p>

<p>So does anyone know of a way to get data into HTML in word, with your own metadata intact? (Oh and pasting the guid visibly in the signature or whatever isn't an option, as the HTML table is generally put in larger emails, along with other outputs from the same app.)</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The best I've found so far is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Some text&lt;a href=""http://foobar.com/#--guid--"" style=""font-size:0px; width=0px""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can't see the link at all unless you zoom in a lot, however when pasted to Excel it changes the whole cell into a link with the guid, so far from ideal.</p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>So you can stop Excel from turning the cell into a hyperlink by adding a second link. This might be enough for my purpose, however the elements are still visible if you zoom and who knows what other clients will do with it. So I'm still looking for a 'perfect' solution...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Some text
&lt;a href=""http://foobar.com/#--guid--"" style=""color:white;font-family:times new roman;font-size:0px; width=0px""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""http://foobar.com/"" style=""color:white;font-family:times new roman;font-size:0px; width=0px""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The font family is important, as Word seems to be able to render the font at 0px, while others like Verdana it doesn't seem to be able to so you get a 'dot'.</p>

<p>We have tried this - we use the EF Power Tools extension to auto-generate the precompiled views. Our application was still running afterwards, but I have doubts whether these views are being used at all.</p>

<p>The article above states that SQL Express must be installed. We use DevArt dotConnect with an Oracle database. I wonder how the Microsoft-cooked EF Power Tools should know how the correct SQL for the precompiled views looks like. Does it look at the web.config and find that dotConnect is the provider and retrieve the SQL statements from that provider?</p>

<p>To lead this ad absurdum, I messed up all the strings in the precompiled views file (DataContext.Views.cs) and ran the application - it still worked perfectly.</p>

<p>FRACTIONALMETRICS has the biggest noticeable visual effect on text so getting that to work is what i'm looking to do.</p>

<p>here is a screen shot comparison of what it looks like when I run the app from my IDE (<strong>Left</strong>) which uses Java 6 and when I double click the Jar file its self (<strong>Right</strong>) which uses my systems JRE, Java 7.
(I also temporary added the red border to show that the paint method does work)</p>

<hr>

<p>I used to declare Game1's spriteBatch <strong>static</strong>, and called <code>SpriteBatch.Begin</code> and <code>.Close</code> in every <code>IDrawable.Draw</code>. That didn't work well. Giving each drawable it's own SpriteBatch also didn't work well.</p>

<p><strong>Q1</strong>: I assume it's best to have <strong>one</strong> SpriteBatch instance, and only call begin/close <strong>once</strong>. Is this correct?</p>

<hr>

<p>Currently, my <code>Game1.Draw</code> looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>spriteBatch.Begin();

base.Draw(gameTime); // draws elements of Game.Components

// ...

spriteBatch.End();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Q2</strong>: This way, <code>Begin</code> is called only once. Is this the way to go? How did you guys solve this?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q3</strong>: Also, every component has it's own <code>IGameComponent.LoadContent</code> method. Am I supposed to load my content there? Or is it better to load content at a parent class, such as <code>Game1.LoadContent</code>?</p>

<hr>

<p>I realise that I should never load the same content twice, so I have given my drawable components both a static and a non-static <code>Texture2D</code>, and gave them 2 constructors:</p>

<pre><code>static Texture2D defaultTexture;
public Texture2D MyTexture;

public Enemy()
    : this(defaultTexture) { }

public Enemy(Texture2D texture)
{
    MyTexture = texture;
}

protected override void LoadContent()
{
    if (MyTexture == null)
    {
        if (defaultTexture == null)
        {
            defaultTexture = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(""enemy"");
        }

        MyTexture = defaultTexture;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the default textures of a class are only loaded the first time <code>LoadContent</code> is called on that class. However, when the parameter <code>texture</code> is specified in the constructor, I'll have to load that texture beforehand.</p>

<p><strong>Q4</strong>: I think there should be better ways to do this. I'm thinking of creating a texture dictionary with their asset names as string. What would you suggest?</p>

My need for such a thing comes from this: My project outputs machine code for a selected arch.(which may or may not be the same arch. as the one running the program). So, I would like to support up to 64bit architectures right now(while also supporting existing 32 and 16 bit archs.) My current solution is for new_state's 'base' to just be a uint64_t, and manually casting to 16 and 32 bits as needed. Though, I discovered you can compile unions in a function parameter. So a function as this compiles:</p>

<pre><code>int pcg_new_state(pcg_state *s,int arch,void *mem,int sz,
			 union{
	uint16_t b16;
	uint32_t b32;
	uint64_t b64;
}base ,int self_running);
</code></pre>

<p>Is this kind of thing at all ""legal"" though or supported by any other compilers? And also, I can't figure out how to call this function without also creating a union and then passing this union to new_state.</p>

I'm looking at different setup configurations, and ideally, would like to avoid using separate VM instances to pipe as video sources into Wirecast (as some people propose).</p>

<p>I'm trying to find a way to do this by only using multiple instance of Skype running on one OS. All the proposed solutions I've seen get the Skype video by capturing the window (with Desktop Presenter) or a cropped region of the screen. This seems like such a low tech way of doing this. In addition, none of the tutorials I've seen tackle the question of more than one remote participant.</p>

<p>The logical solution is to capture the video straight from Skype, however this isn't offered out of the box. </p>

<p><strong>If Skype call recording software can grab the raw stream at the source and save it to a file, wouldn't there be a way to pipe that audio/video through a virtual video source to Wirecast or VidBlaster?</strong></p>

<p>1.
In the proposed Java closure spec, would we be able to
create an array or collection of closures?<br>
If so, would this syntax be possible?  </p>

<pre><code>{int x, int y =&gt; boolean b}[] comparisonSwitch = {
  {int i, int j =&gt; return i&gt;j},
  {int i, int j =&gt; return j&lt;i},
  {int i, int j =&gt; return j==i}
}

boolean compare(int acase, int a, int b){
  return comparisonSwitch[acase].invoke(a,b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>2.
Would normal methods be considered as non-anonymous closures?<br>
So would the following syntax be possible?</p>

<pre><code>public class Asdf
{
  public boolean gt(int x, int y){
    return x&gt;y;
  }
  public boolean lt(int x, int y){
    return x&lt;y;
  }
  public boolean eq(int x, int y){
    return x==y;
  }

  {int x, int y =&gt; boolean b} GT = gt;
  {int x, int y =&gt; boolean b}[] comparisonSwitch = {
    gt, lt, eq
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>3.
i.e., are closures and methods interchangeble operationally?<br>
Would the following syntax be allowed?</p>

<pre><code>// declare a method that has a closure type as an argument
void closurator( {String s =&gt; int a} findlen ){
  // do whatever
}
String s = ""hello"";
void useClosurator(){
  // invoke the method by supplying a non-anonymous method
  // of an object
  closurator(s.indexOf(String ss));
}
</code></pre>

<p>4.
How would we be able to specify a closure type in an interface?<br>
Could we do the following, effectively declaring final/constant reference to methods.</p>

<pre><code>interface Closuration
{
  public class Asdf
  {
    static public boolean gt(int x, int y){
      return x&gt;y;
    }
    static public boolean lt(int x, int y){
      return x&lt;y;
    }
    static public boolean eq(int x, int y){
      return x==y;
    }
  }

  {int x, int y =&gt; boolean b}[] comparisonSwitch = {
    Asdf.gt, Asdf.lt, Asdf.eq
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>5.
Since closures would access code space, just as reflection would, would use of closure slow down the performance of a programme? If not, would it mean, that reflection would be sped up by borrowing advances made in ""closure technology""?  </p>

<p>Inserted new question:
Actually, would closure code be part of code space or in the variable heap, because I am predicting that closure code would be susceptible to be wiped off by garbage collection, right?</p>

<p>May I request you to focus on the gist of the questions, not on any syntax errors/typos/missing keywords in the example code. Any typos/errors, please correct them for me. Thank you.</p>

E.g., If Question 2 is in cell A1 and has 3 response options, these are listed below the question in cells A2-C2, A3-C3, etc.  Note: Only one of A2-C2, etc. is filled w/ data for each observation.</p>

<p>It seems clear that I <em>could</em> go through the spreadsheet manually and concatenate A2-C2 using code similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>=CONCATENATE(IF(ISBLANK(A4),"""",A4),IF(ISBLANK(B4),"""",B4),IF(ISBLANK(C4),"""",C4))

<p>But, the above requires manually altering the code (questions have anywhere from 2-6 response options) and copying/pasting it through all observations for each of the 960 variables individually.  Because I'd like to finish this before dying of old age, I'd love to have some way of automating the above process.  </p>

<p>It would be easy enough to go through and insert an identifier column (w/ no data but w/ some obvious 1st row name) after each variable's last response option so the code knows where to begin looking back for data to concatenate. The code would have to know to stop whenever it hits the previously concatenated result, and begin the current concatenation w/ the subsequent column. Once it hits a certain line (say, 60? I only have ~55 observations), it could just look for the next identifier column and repeat the process.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be <em>much</em> appreciated.</p>

<p>I need to check for blanks so as to not have extra spaces in the data (to aid future analysis).</p>

<p>Hopefully the below will clarify the situation further. You're correct in your earlier comment; each question is followed by 55 rows of observations. For example:</p>

<p>If a user opens a link to some sub-page in my website, like index.html#Contact, I would like to add the index.html# token onto the history stack before the index.html#Contact token, so that the user, when clicking the browser's <kbd>back</kbd>-button first ends up on the start-page of my site and then on the next <kbd>back</kbd> actually leaves the page as normal.</p>

<p>I thought I could achieve this very easily with the following javascript that gets executed ""onload"":</p>

<pre><code>var href = window.location.href;
var hashPos = href.indexOf(""#"");
if ((hashPos &gt; 0) &amp; (hashPos+1 &lt; href.length)) {
    window.location.replace(href.substring(0, hashPos+1));
    window.location.assign (href);
}

<p>But for some reason, this doesn't do anything at all...</p>

<p>I got it to work in Firefox like this:</p>

<pre><code>var href = window.location.href;
var hashPos = href.indexOf(""#"");

    window.location.replace(href.substring(0, hashPos+1));
    setTimeout(function() { 
        window.location.assign(href);
    }, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But in IE and Chrome, this doesn't do anything either...</p>

<p>I thought it'd make a LOT of sense if it was declared as such:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Map&lt;K,V&gt; extends Collection&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After all, a <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> is a collection of <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.Entry.html""><code>Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;</code></a>, isn't it?</p>

<p>So is there a good reason why it's not implemented as such?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks to Cletus for a most authoritative answer, but I'm still wondering why, if you can already view a <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> as <code>Set&lt;Map.Entries&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;</code> (via <code>entrySet()</code>), it doesn't just extend that interface instead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a <code>Map</code> is a <code>Collection</code>, what are the elements? The only reasonable answer is ""Key-value pairs""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, <code>interface Map&lt;K,V&gt; extends Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;</code> would be great!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but this provides a very limited (and not particularly useful) <code>Map</code> abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if that's the case then why is <code>entrySet</code> specified by the interface? It must be useful somehow (and I think it's easy to argue for that position!).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can't ask what value a given key maps to, nor can you delete the entry for a given key without knowing what value it maps to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not saying that that's all there is to it to <code>Map</code>! It can and <em>should</em> keep all the other methods (except <code>entrySet</code>, which is redundant now)!</p>

<p>Specifically on Android, and at least on versions Android 5.1.1 and 4.4.4 (and likely on all of them due to Crosswalk), whenever I long-press on an input field, my WebView shrinks in height and shows a weirdly-styled top bar with cut/copy/paste/clipboard buttons, and a ""back"" button which closes the top bar:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HLIUj.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HLIUj.png"" alt=""Android cut/copy/paste top bar""></a></p>

<p>How do I prevent this long-click? I have tried adding an onLongClickListener and calling setLongClickable(false) on the WebView in my app's MainActivity.java, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends CordovaActivity {
    private static final String TAG = MainActivity.class.getSimpleName();

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // Set by &lt;content src=""index.html"" /&gt; in config.xml
        loadUrl(launchUrl);

        // disable the context menu and all long clicks
        super.getView().setOnLongClickListener(new View.OnLongClickListener() {
            public boolean onLongClick(View v) {
            return true;
            }
        });
        super.appView.getView().setLongClickable(false);
        Log.i(TAG, ""setLongClickable false"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't seem to have any effect. I have also added the following CSS rules:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    -webkit-text-size-adjust: none !important;
    -webkit-touch-callout: none !important;
    -webkit-user-select: none !important;
    user-select: none !important;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This also had no effect.</p>

<p>I have also tried the following Javascript, which runs before any view is rendered (using Backbone/Marionette/Handlebars) (#viewport is the first div element inside body):</p>

<pre><code>  function stopEvent(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    return false;
  }

  window.oncontextmenu = function (e) {
    return stopEvent(e);
  };

  window.onselectstart = function(e) {
    return stopEvent(e);
  };
  window.ondragstart = function(e) {
    return stopEvent(e);
  };

  $('#viewport').on('taphold', function(e) {
    console.log(""taphold"");
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();

    return false;
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Again, no effect.</p>

<p>I'm almost certain it's due to the Cordova Crosswalk WebView, since after removing the plugin, the behaviour disappears: nothing happens on a long-press. Is the Crosswalk WebView perhaps ignoring the setLongClickable / setOnLongClickListener method calls? Perhaps there's another ""hidden"" WebView that I need to call these methods on?</p>

<p>How can I disable the top bar? I don't mind editing Cordova or Crosswalk Java sources. Thanks.</p>

This previously was ok - now it displays the English UK spelling. Below is a list of some words that I found .For example if I say <strong>center</strong>  and set the language code as en-US I am getting the result as <strong>centre</strong> which is English UK.</p>

<p>I am using Google api v2 </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/speech-api/v2/recognize?output=json&amp;lang=en-US&amp;key=my_key"">https://www.google.com/speech-api/v2/recognize?output=json&amp;lang=en-US&amp;key=my_key</a>""</p>

<p>WORDS ENDING IN –RE</p>

<p>British English words that end in -re often end in -er in American English:</p>

<p><strong>British</strong>  and   <strong>US</strong> </p>

<pre><code>centre          center 

fibre           fiber 

litre           liter 

theatre         theater or theatre 
</code></pre>

<p>Even though I am giving the language code as en-US the result returned will be in British English.Is this a common issue or US English code is no longer working. Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I just noticed this issue is with ok google also Even though my input is in English us ,the answers I am getting is in English Uk.These are some other words</p>

<p>Words ending in -our</p>

<p>British English words ending in -our usually end in -or in American English:</p>

<pre><code>colour        color

flavour       flavor

humour        humor

labour        labor

</code></pre>

<p><strong>British</strong>      and             <strong>US</strong></p>

<pre><code>apologize or apologise      apologize

<p>I am trying to create a form that will allow the user to create multiple work records without having to re-enter the date, hours, and category information.  (Ex: 10 people worked the same shift at the holiday party.)  The way I plan to do this is to create a temp table, write a complete record to the table for each volunteer selected, then do an INSERT query to select everything from the temp table and insert the records into the real Work_Records table.  <em>(This second portion is not done yet.  I'm debugging as I go, and have gotten stuck with the first part.)</em></p>

<p>The problem is that my records do not appear to actually be getting inserted into the temp table.  I'm guessing that something is wrong with my SQL code.</p>

<p>So when my app get's minimized the service cannot use the camera anymore. Why? When I go back to my app it crashes</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The entire stack trace <a href=""http://dpaste.com/933015/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dpaste.com/933015/</a></p>

<p>So there is an intent <code>android.intent.action.MAIN</code> send by the service but never received by the activity.</p>

<p>I catch the intent like this in my activity:</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
    protected void onResume() {

        super.onResume();

        IntentFilter intentFilter = new IntentFilter(
                ""android.intent.action.MAIN"");

        mBroadcastReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
            @Override
            public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
               //access camera
            }
        };

        this.registerReceiver(mBroadcastReceiver, intentFilter);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So is there a chance to catch the intent and access camera when the app is minimized? How can I do that?</p>

<pre><code>function getPixels(dp) {

alert(460); // 920
alert(Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight); // 1136

<p>I'm using a Media Temple DV server. I wrote a script in PHP to connect to a remote server via FTP. I know the code is correct because on some hosts it connects. However, with SOME servers I get nothing at all, no errors, nothing. I've called tech. support at the remote server and they see no evidence of a connection being made. I also looked at the log files, talked to Media Temple support and we see that the operating times out. I have fast CGI running and they suggested upping the timeout to 90+ seconds, which we did an still not worked.</p>

<p>I then tried connecting to the Media Temple DV via SSH, and then tried to FTP via the command line. Same issue. On some remote FTP servers I can connect but the others just hang and eventually return ""Connection timed out"". Media Temple has no idea what is causing this. At first they said it might be the fact that I am trying this on a DV4. I've tried on a DV5 and still, same issue. </p>

<p>I'm at a total loss here as to why this is happening. When I try my code locally I'm able to connect and also am able to connect via my local terminal.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Thanks so much!</p>

<p>I want to give the project to a person over the Internet. I want they to download only my project without having to download anything else. But my project has one external dependency which I can download myself. </p>

<p>Can I include this dependency (after downloading it myself) into the project and give the project to the person so they'll be able to run it successfully? And how? And how do I make sbt to load it from the project and not from the Internet or anywhere else? </p>

<li>jos_vm_order_items => the items in an order</li>
<li>jos_vm_order => an order</li>
<li>stock_web_brut => the stock of my products</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to get all the informations of a specific product :</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of stock (done)</li>
<li>the informations of the product in the table jos_vm_products (done)</li>
<li>the number of orders which are in « pending » for a specific product (blocked)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the first request I have :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  `product_id` ,  `product_weight` ,  `cdate` ,  `mdate` ,  `product_name` ,  `product_sales` ,  `product_sku` ,  `product_in_stock` , SUM( stock_bloque ) AS  'stock_bloque', SUM( stock_total ) AS  'stock_total', SUM( stock_vente ) AS  'stock_vente', ref
FROM jos_vm_product t1
INNER JOIN  `stock_web_brut` t2 ON t1.product_sku LIKE CONCAT( t2.ref,  '%' ) 
GROUP BY product_id;
</code></pre>

<p>And I think I should do a subrequest like this :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 

     (
        SELECT  COUNT(t5.product_id) 
        FROM jos_vm_product t5 
        INNER JOIN jos_vm_order_item t6 ON  t5.product_id = t6.product_id 
        WHERE order_status = 'P' AND t5.product_id = 12
     ) AS ""nombre_produit_pending"",  
    `product_id` ,  
    `product_weight` ,  
    `cdate` ,  `mdate` ,  
    `product_name` ,  
    `product_sales` ,  
    `product_sku` ,  
    `product_in_stock` , 
    SUM( stock_bloque ) AS  'stock_bloque', 
    SUM( stock_total ) AS  'stock_total', 
    SUM( stock_vente ) AS  'stock_vente', 
    ref
FROM jos_vm_product t1
INNER JOIN  `stock_web_brut` t2 ON t1.product_sku LIKE CONCAT( t2.ref,  '%' ) 
GROUP BY product_id
</code></pre>

<p>And instead of « 12 », I thought I should do something like :</p>

<pre><code>WHERE order_status = 'P' AND t5.product_id = t1.product_id
</code></pre>

<p>But I have a loop</p>

<p>Here are the tables : <a href=""http://kai23.fr/myam.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kai23.fr/myam.svg</a>  (I can't post images)</p>

<p>And for the results, it would be something like that :</p>

<pre><code>`product_id` | [...] | 'number_of_orders_in_pending_for_this_product' |
    12       | [...] |               15
    13       | [...] |               5
    14       | [...] |               3

</code></pre>

<p>The first timestamp is buffer time, the second is reference time (time at which the button was pressed, I am using <code>AudioQueueDeviceGetCurrentTime</code>) and third is the delta between the two. As expected, the buffers slightly lag ""real time"" and catch up after a couple buffer callbacks have been run.</p>

<p>Now when closing and reopening this queue, the story is much different:</p>

<pre><code>2010-01-21 14:03:46.769 [61694:207] 1288755719477798    1288758853485434    -3134007636

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the timestamps (ns I suppose?) are way different the second time around. They don't catch up to real time for several seconds. This behavior is not at all reproducible -- the timestamps are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. They are always wrong the first time I open the queue however.</p>

<ul>
<li>Old scripts added rows to a table without deleting existing rows.</li>
<li>Need to discover ""duplicate"" rows (based on matching two fields).</li>
<li>For each set of duplicate rows, sort by ids and return all but the newest one (highest id).</li>
<li>Each row has an associated external file, so can't simply delete the older rows - need to return a list of all the older rows, which will then be processed by a php script.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>TABLE mytable:

ID  A   B      Filename
 1  10  abc    aa.png
 2  11  dddd   bb.xml
 3  10  abc    cc.png
 4  10  dddd   dd.png
 5  10  abc    ee.xml
 6  11  dddd   ff.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Rows with IDs 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 are duplicates (both A and B match).
Similarly, 2 &amp; 6 are duplicates.  Return list (1, 2, 3) - these are the ""older"" rows that need to be processed.</p>

<p>Even better: return a set of records, containing 'ID' and 'Filename' for those rows.</p>

<p>My primary question is an SQL query that does this, though it would also be useful to me to see how to use the result of that query in php.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are existing stackoverflow posts related to deleting duplicate rows, but the ones I found delete the rows directly. This won't work for me, as I need to have the external php script delete the corresponding external files:</p>

<hr>

<p>IMPORTANT: The other posts which I quote don't bother to distinguish newer from older; they are about removing <em>fully duplicate records</em>, but that is not my situation. I have records which are <em>partially duplicates</em>; that is, several records match the specified criteria, but there is important information in other fields, hence I have to know which is newest (highest id) for each value of criteria; those are the ones to keep.</p>

My scenario is one which I need to load the assets in the background while showing a different view and change to the view showing the AVPlayer when the assets are ready to play. Not before.</p>

<p>I've tried loading async and calling a delegate method to tell ""the assets are ready, you can show the next view"", but if I get a mem warning before that, the views containing the assets in the background get released before they finish loading...so i never get the delegate call. That's why I rather do it synchronously.</p>

<p>I want to make a mapReduce operation where the emitted key is the <em>ID</em> of a <em>DBRef</em>, not it's value. I clearly understand from <a href=""http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.collection.mapReduce/"" rel=""nofollow"">MongoDB documentation</a> that for parallelism reason one mustn't and can't access the DB.</p>

<p>So my collection documents are like that:</p>

<pre><code>{
  _id: ""66f072b8-2422-4022-826b-b20b832a1ee6"",
  _class: ""com.foo.bar"",
  foo_bar: 1,
  user: {
    ""$dbref"": {
      namespace: ""user"",
      oid: ""6cd0dac5-a511-48b1-b437-318ad74061a5""
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>current</em> mapReduce is like that:</p>

<pre><code>db.myCollection.mapReduce(
  function () {
      if (this.foo_bar &gt; 0) {
          emit(this.user, this.foo_bar);
      }
  },
  function (key, values) {
      var sum = 0;
      for (var i = 0; i &lt; values.length; i++) {
          sum += values[i];
      }
      return sum;
  },

  {
    ""out"" : { ""inline"" : 1} 
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>There is a lot of documents and the loading between AWS and MongoHQ is taking a lot of time. I would like to be able to use <em>user$id as a key</em>, instead of the DBRef's document.</p>

<p>I've tested with the following but without success:</p>

<ol>
<li>emit(<strong>this.user.id</strong>, this.foo_bar); </li>
<li>emit(<strong>this.user.oid</strong>, this.foo_bar);</li>
<li>emit(<strong>this.user._id</strong>, this.foo_bar); </li>
<li>emit(<strong>this.user.dbref.id</strong>,this.foo_bar); </li>

<li>emit(<strong>this.user.dbref._id</strong>, this.foo_bar);</li>
<li>emit(<strong>this.user['$dbref'].oid</strong>, this.foo_bar); (as per Sammaye suggestion in comments)</li>

<p>Here fixOrientation and scaleAndRotateImage functions taken from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9324130/iphoneimage-captured-from-camera-rotate-90-degree-automatically"">here</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10071313/image-taken-in-portrait-is-distorted-when-viewed-in-landscape"">here</a> respectively. They works fine and rotate image when I apply them on UIImage but doesn't work if I save image as PNG representation and apply them.</p>

<p>Please refere the following picture after executing above functions:</p>

"17493989","1","","","2013-07-05 17:19:58","","2","174","<p>Has anybody successfully managed to integrate the Janrain Jump.IOS library with Xamarin?</p>

<p>So far I tried downloading the Jump.IOS from GitHub, created a XCode static library and added in all the stuff from the <a href=""https://github.com/janrain/jump.ios/tree/master/Janrain/JREngage/Classes"" rel=""nofollow"">JREngage</a> folder (right now, if I can get sign in working, I'll be happy - sign up can just work through the web site for the time being). After some fiddling and including a few bits from elsewhere in the Jump.IOS project (JRConnectionManager, SFHFKeychainUtils and JSONKit) and including some required frameworks, I was able to get XCode to compile it into a <code>.a</code> file.</p>

<p>From there, I was able to run it through <a href=""http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/binding_objective-c_libraries/objective_sharpie"" rel=""nofollow"">Objective Sharpie</a> and produce a <code>.cs</code> file. Then I created a binding library project in Xamarin Studio, included my <code>.a</code> file and the code from my <code>.cs</code> file and, with a little more fiddling, got that to compile.</p>

<p>Then I created a simple single view app and tried to use the library in the <code>ViewDidLoad</code> method of my main view. This compiles and executes without any errors, but doesn't actually appear to be doing anything! I don't think it's actually calling the Janrain code and contacting their servers.</p>

<p>Without any errors to work with, I'm now stumped. </p>

<p><strong>Some updates:</strong></p>

<p>I dumped all of the code from Janrain's github repository into a new XCode project, removed JRCapture (although it turns out, I think I need it now) and recompiled. With some fiddling, it compiled. A large part of my initial problem was that it wouldn't build a universal binary. I found a script <a href=""https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples/blob/master/BindingSample/src/binding/XMBindingLibrarySample/RunScript.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and added it to the build phases of my xcode project and that seemed to have cracked the problem. I was building ARM binaries before and they (obviously) don't run on the simulator. I don't know why Apple makes it so difficult to make a universal binary!</p>

<p>I ran <code>JRConnectionManager.h</code> and <code>JREngage.h</code> throw Objective Sharpie to create a <code>.cs</code> file and then added it to a binding project. With a little tweaking that would compile. Then I created a simple iPhone project to test. A couple of key points with the iPhone project:</p>

<ol>
<li>Even if you include the <code>.xib</code> files in the xcode project, they are unusable in the xamarin project. You have to add them all again to your iphone project itself (find them in JREngage/Resources/xibs)</li>
<li>The code to fire <code>ShowAuthenticationDialog</code> needs to be in <code>ViewDidAppear</code> rather than <code>ViewDidLoad</code>. Apparently the view is loaded, but because it's not actually shown yet, the Janrain code can't add it's dialog to the view.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that the github repo has all the images nested in <code>Resources\Images</code> and <code>Resources\Images-2x</code>, the code actually expects all the images to be in the root of the application. You can edit the <code>IPhoneResourcePrefix</code> tag in your <code>.csproj</code> with a semicolon delimited list of paths to get it to automatically strip all the paths. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16938250/xamarin-studio-folder-structure-issue-in-ios-project"">See here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I fiddled around with that some, I actually got the thing to work. The authentication dialog appears, it connects with the appropriate providers and comes back with data. Now I just need to figure out what to do with the response!</p>

<li><p>Consider the case of the above hash table where M = 5 (num of rows) and the total length to be 10. How would I know if this is hash table is uniformly hashed or not?</p></li>
<li><p>If one makes a uniform hashing of a set of keys, does that mean the lists inside the chains in a hashtable aka the linked-lists due to collisions have the same length? Or does it mean the average?</p></li>
<li><p>If one makes a uniform hashing of keys, does that mean the find and remove functions of this hashtable are O(1) (amortized) and a pure complexity of O(n/M) where M is the number of chains in total?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the load factor or (N/#ofChains) identify the uniformity of the hashing?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope you can help me with these questions. My professor had put a lot of concepts out in class and I am just basically bending them together here and I am getting confused when I put these concepts together. </p>

<p>I was searching on the web for more to study about this concept and I saw a set of slides as shown below. I would be obliged if you <strong>can explain to me what the equation means in the second slide in relation to uniform hashing of keys</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Also, what does it mean when they say ""the number of keys that map to each slot are equal."" Does go to say that my hashtable that is shown above is NOT uniformily hashed?</strong></p>

<p>My call to register the cors win the WebApiConfig.cs</p>

<pre><code> config.EnableCors();
 config.SetCorsPolicyProviderFactory(new DynamicPolicyProviderFactory(Settings.Default.AllowedDomains));
</code></pre>

<p>And my application settings being passed:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MyApp.Properties.Settings&gt;
  &lt;setting name=""AllowedDomains"" serializeAs=""Xml""&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;
      &lt;ArrayOfString xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;

  &lt;/setting&gt;
&lt;/MyApp.Properties.Settings&gt;

<p></p>

<p>Despite these settings, the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header is not present on my responses if I make a request from <code>http://mg.domain1.com</code> to <code>http://localhost</code>.  I am using Web Api 2.2 and Microsoft.AspNet.Cors 5.2.2.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I have found that if I use the <code>EnableCors</code> attribute on the controller, or enable it globally (<code>config.EnableCors(new EnableCorsAttribute(""*"", ""*"", ""*""));</code>) it works, so it must be something with my dynamic factory.  The frustrating thing is, the DynamicPolicyProvider is copy/pasted from another project I am using that works fine.</p>

<p><strong>edit 2:</strong>   Success!...I enabled <a href=""http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/testing-and-debugging/tracing-in-aspnet-web-api"" rel=""nofollow"">tracing</a> and found the error</p>

<pre><code> The collection of headers 'accept,content-type' is not allowed
</code></pre>

<p>So I just edited the <code>GetPolicyForControllerAndOrigin</code> method to allow them.  Now everything works, accept I am confused because I did not have to jump through this hoop in my other project (the one I copied the DynamicPolicyProviderFactory from)</p>

That is, when it's compiled with dmd. When I try with gdc (and no code modification), it does compile but it won't load the image at runtime.</p>

<p>I believe I did things right :</p>

<p><code>SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)</code></p>

<p>then</p>

<p><code>IMG_Init(IMG_INIT_JPG)</code></p>

<p>and somewhere after that</p>

<p><code>this.data = IMG_LoadTexture(Window.renderer, name.ptr)</code></p>

<p>where <code>Window.renderer</code> is (obviously) the <code>SDL_Renderer*</code> and <code>name.ptr</code> is a <code>char*</code> pointing to the name of the image to load. But when compiling with gdc, <code>IMG_Load</code> and <code>IMG_LoadTexture</code> both return <code>null</code>, while with dmd they return a pointer to the newly created texture...</p>

<p>Did I forget something else (after all, with dmd it worked even without <code>IMG_Init</code>) ? Does Derelict only works with dmd (even if it's only interfacing to C functions) ?</p>

<p>dmd : 2.065</p>

<p>gdc : 4.9.1</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong></p>

<p>Turns out the problem is completely different. <code>IMG_LoadTexture</code> takes a pointer to data for its second argument but <code>name.ptr</code> seems to only work with dmd. However If I try with a hard-coded argument like this :</p>

<p><code>IMG_LoadTexture(renderer, ""../test/res/image.jpg"")</code></p>

<p>Now, the application works correctly when I listed all the inputs one by one like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""checkbox"" ng-model=""Emotions""&gt;Emotions
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" ng-model=""Feelings""&gt;Feelings
</code></pre>

<p>but I wanted to wrap it into an ng-repeat and list the features in the controller scope, since the features I will considered will be more. When I try the code above when I tick on the box the name changes to `true'.</p>

<p>I have read a lot about how to bind models to an ng-repeat inside a input tag but none of the solutions apply to my case.
Can someone please help me?</p>

<p>Deployed application produces (maybe large) PDF to <code>#{Rails.root}/tmp</code> and serves this file using <code>send_file</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that Capistrano uses symlinks to point to currently deployed version of application.

However, the strange thing is, it asks for length of the string buffer that will hold name of the drive in return in its 3<sup>rd</sup> parameter.</p>

<p>As far as I know, a drive letter can be nothing but a two-letter string; a letter followed by a semicolon, like <code>A:</code>, <code>B:</code>, <code>C:</code>, etc. Therefore, it must always be a two-character string under all cases. But if so, just why does <code>_splitpath_s()</code> ask for length of drive letter? Is there any case which drive letter can be in a different format? What problem would had occurred at worst, if it didn't ask for its length and just assumed it to be 2?</p>

The program works fine but once you press the Restart button, I get a NullPointerException error in the console area and the game doesn't restart. I get the NullPointerException error in the line ""if (!drop[i].finished) {"". I've read that it has to do with the constructor not initializing the array, but it already initialized it.

<p><strong>Issue</strong></p>

<p>We have an organization with quite some boards. </p>

<ul>
<li>All boards are organization visible</li>
<li>Some boards also include members who are not member of the organization.</li>
<li>Lists inside a board have specific names, like ""To Do"", ""In Progress"" etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a status screen where we would like to display all cards from a specific list inside the organization. These cards should be sorted by member, even for the members not in our organization.</p>

<p>A lot of this information is dynamic, like members, cards and boards.</p>

<p><strong>What I am doing now</strong></p>

<p>At the moment I have only found a solution where we make a lot of requests to the API, which of course has a <a href=""http://help.trello.com/article/838-api-rate-limits"" rel=""nofollow"">limit</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>At first we are going through all boards inside the organization to get the board id's.</li>
<li>Then we are looping through these id's to get all members inside all boards. This is needed because some board-members are not member of the organization. Duplicates are removed.</li>
<li>When this is done, we found 2 different ways to get the cards. (1) Go through <code>members/[idMember or username]/cards</code>. here we can't get the list name. (2) Go through <code>boards/[board_id]/lists</code>, here we can't get the member name.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because we can't get all information in a single or just a few requests this process is very slow and even unstable because of the limit in the API. </p>

<p>Is there anyone with a good/better solution? In a perfect world I'd like to have a single request like this:</p>

<p><code>GET /1/organizations/[idOrg or name]/boards</code> where we can send in arguments to get all cards, all members and all lists. </p>

<p>I have the need to change from 1 view controller to one of 3 others then always return to my main view controller before choosing the next controller to goto. I have found the using segues seems to reset my choices. Is there a way to navigate between controllers and leave the text fields populated?

I've understood that AppContainers have their own integrity level, that blocks any read and write attempts to assets with a higher integrity level. But why can't those apps then don't access the data of other apps running with in the same integrity level?</p>

<p>And how does the access to objects work when the app got the corresponding capability? I assume for example, that the camera is not tagged with the ""appcontainer"" integrity level. Therefore any access to it by an app running in an appcontainer should be directly blocked. But it's possible to declare the camera capability and the app will be able to access the camera. How is this possible? Can the capabilities that are denoted in the SID somehow ""extend"" the integrity level of an app?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JynUA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So if the user changes the category, the second dropdown needs to be filled with the list of subcategories.</p>

<p>This sounds like a typical job for AutoPostBack.<br>
However, there's a bit of a problem with AutoPostBack: if the list isn't dropped open, and the user uses the keyboard to make the choice, the postback happens right after the first keystroke. This prevents the user from scrolling down the list with the down arrow, or typing the name of the category.</p>

<p>This happens in Chrome and IE and Opera, but not in Firefox. Firefox fires the <code>onchange</code> event only when leaving the control (tabbing to the next control), just like it would when the list was dropped open, and that's what I want the other browsers to do too.</p>

<p>Any solutions how I can achieve this?</p>

<p>I tried to remove the <code>AutoPostBack</code> attribute and use <code>onblur</code>, but apparently the page works differently with AutoPostBack than without, because the browsers start complaining about Javascript errors.</p>

<p>Now since we're all so fond of jsFiddle, <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/MrLister/T3uLL/"" rel=""nofollow"">here's one</a>. It doesn't actually do anything, but it can demonstrate the problem. Click on the first dropdown, then click again to close the list. (This is what happens when you navigate through the form with the tab key: dropdown lists don't open up.) Now type a letter or the down arrow. Firefox changes the current selection and waits for you to do anything else, but Chrome and IE and Opera all attempt to submit the form immediately, with drastic results.</p>

<p>So how can I avoid that? And note that simply changing the fiddle may not be enough, it must be translatable back to an ASP.NET solution.</p>

<p>How do I properly reference this store?  Currently I'm getting a not found error (it's looking in the current c# project url instead of the one that actually contains the store).</p>

<pre><code>&gt; GET

&gt; 404 (Not Found)
</code></pre>

<p>I think it should be looking</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost/Orchard/NCS.Services.PODS/NCS/store/Hierarchies.js?_dc=1405085182757
</code></pre>

<p>Also since it's looking under NCS/store I'm wondering if I need to change the folder layout to match my naming convention.</p>

<p>So I have written a .obj file reader and tried it out in a simple scene, some .obj files rendered good (like a simple cube), some rendered really strangely, and then some didn't render at all. I was hoping someone could point out to me what I did wrong, the following code contains one class, with 2 embedded classed, one of which contains another embedded class. It  may get confusing, so you can copy and paste into a file for easier reading if needed.</p>

<p>The script reads line by line in the file and if it starts with ""v"" (vertex) it splits the line by space, and takes index 1 2 and 3 (x y and z) and stores the integer values in a class called Vertex, and adds it to an array of Vertex objects. a Vertex object acts just like a vector, only it contains two vectors, one for position, and one for the normals.</p>

<p>If the line starts with ""vn"" (Vertex Normal) it splits the line by "" "" and takes the indexes 1 2 and 3 and adds then to a Vertex object, which acts just like a vector so far, and then that Vertex is added to a different Vertex array specifically for normals.</p>

<p>Now here is the interesting part, when the line starts with ""f"" (Face) the line might look like:</p>

<pre><code>f 1//3 5//3 6//1 2//4
</code></pre>

<p>each #1//#2, #1 is the index of the correct vertex, and #2 is the index for the proper normal. So I take each part of the line, splitted by "" "" and split it by ""//"" and took the vertex from the vertices array and the vertex from the normals array, set the vertices normals to the x y and z of the normal, made a Face object, and added it to a list of faces, which faces just hold 3 or 4 Vertex objects.</p>

<p>Hopefully this explaination might make the file not seem as messy.</p>

<p>The two in particular that intrigue me are :</p>

<p>1)</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap.Save(Stream, ImageFormat)
</code></pre>

<p>2)</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap.Save(Stream, ImageCodecInfo, EncoderParameters)
</code></pre>

<p>The scenario is as follows:</p>

<p>I have a method that takes in an image in the format .bmp and after I performed my resize logic I save this new resized bitmap object back to a memory stream in jpg format. I have used both methods and they are both giving me the encoded jpg equivalent. </p>

<p>Logic for method 1)</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap srcBitmap = new Bitmap(m_testImage);
//perform resize
var imageStream = new MemoryStream();
srcBitmap.Save(imageStream, ImageFormat.Jpeg);
imageStream.Position = 0L;
</code></pre>

<p>Logic for method 2)</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap srcBitmap = new Bitmap(m_testImage);
myjpegEncoder = ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders().FirstOrDefault(codec =&gt; codec.FormatID == ImageFormat.Jpeg.Guid);
encoderParams = new EncoderParameters(1);
encoderParams.Param[0] = new EncoderParameter(System.Drawing.Imaging.Encoder.Quality, 80L);
var imageStream = new MemoryStream();
srcBitmap.Save(imageStream, myjpegEncoder, encoderParams);
imageStream.Position = 0L;
</code></pre>

<p>What are the main differences between these two approaches?</p>

This unmanaged application encrypts some data using this RC4 key. There is also a client side unmanaged application that uses this RC4 key to decrypt information. </p>

<p>However, for this client app we're sending a session key -> the RC4 key encrytped using an RSA public key that was generated at the client side(SIMPLEBLOB). The generation of the encrypted session key used to be done using unmanaged code but now that has to be converted to C# because there is a requirement to run this code from a web application under partial trust.</p>

<pre><code>CryptGenKey(hProv, CALG_RC4, KEY_LENGTH | CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &amp;hKey);

<p>It is exported into the file system using</p>

<pre><code>CryptExportKey(hKey, 0, OPAQUEKEYBLOB, 0, lpBuffer, &amp;nSize);

            cspParams.ProviderType = 1;
            cspParams.ProviderName = ""Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0"";

<p>This generates the same size of data as its unmanaged version but it doesn't generate the correct SIMPLEBLOB session key as when diong step 1 and 2 of the unmanaged version. What am I doing wrong in this code?</p>

So Im asking this question which is different because it is simplified. Happy to be scolded if this is not acceptable.</p>

<p>My core problem is that I want to create a dataframe by including outliers only from each column. The dataframe looks like:</p>

<pre><code> chr   leftPos         TBGGT     12_try      324Gtt       AMN2
  1     24352           34         43          19         43
  1     53534           2          1           -1         -9
  2      34            -15         7           -9         -18
  3     3443           -100        -4          4          -9
  3     3445           -100        -1          6          -1
  3     3667            5          -5          9           5
  3     7882           -8          -9          1           3
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to calculate the upper and lower limit of each column (from the third onwards), exclude all rows that fall within the limits so I only keep outliers, and then end up with a dataframe as follows (for each column). This dataframe then gets passed to the next bit of the code (in the loop) but I wont elaborate on this for the sake of simplicity</p>

<pre><code>chr   leftPos         TBGGT
 2      34            -15        
 3     3443           -100       
 3     3445           -100  
</code></pre>

<p>My code so far:</p>

<p>alpha= 1.5 </p>

<pre><code> f1 &lt;- function(df, ZCol){

  # Determine the UL and LL and then generate the Zoutliers
  UL = median(ZCol, na.rm = TRUE) + alpha*IQR(ZCol, na.rm = TRUE)
  LL = median(ZCol, na.rm = TRUE) - alpha*IQR(ZCol, na.rm = TRUE)
  Zoutliers &lt;- which(ZCol &gt; UL | ZCol &lt; LL)}
</code></pre>

<p>but this just gives me the outlier values without the chr and leftPos it is associated with. How do I get this?</p>

The sub-classes <code>__init__</code> functions of the child classes have different signatures.  In brief, is is possible to create an object of the Parent that calls the <code>__init__</code> of each child class?</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Say I have the following python3.2 code</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.ver = ""the ver""
        print(""A::__init__ .... name = %s"" % name)

class B(object):
    def __init__(self,):
        self.name = ""the name""
        print(""B::__init__"")

    def foo(self,):
        print(""B::foo.   The name is &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;"" % self.name)

class C(B,A):
    def  __init__(self,):
        print(""C::__init__"")
        super(B, self).__init__()
        super(A, self).__init__('waaa') 
</code></pre>

<p>I can create an instance of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A('myplace')
A::__init__ .... name = myplace
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = B()
B::__init__
</code></pre>

<p>However creating an instance of <code>C</code> fails.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()
C::__init__
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;console&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ""&lt;console&gt;"", line 4, in __init__
TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
</code></pre>

<p>If I modify the <code>__init__</code> of <code>C</code> to</p>

<pre><code>class C(B,A):
    def  __init__(self,):
      print(""C::__init__"")
      super(B, self).__init__('another')
      super(A, self).__init__('waaa') 
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following when creating an instance of <code>C</code></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; C()
C::__init__
A::__init__ .... name = another
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;console&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ""&lt;console&gt;"", line 5, in __init__
TypeError: object.__init__() takes no parameters
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<h1>My questions</h1>

<p>I read the document of <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/functions.html#super"" rel=""nofollow""><code>super()</code></a> and it wasn't clear if it is possible to call the <code>__init__</code> of each respective child class.</p>

<p>It appears that the <code>super(B, self)__init__('another')</code> is actually calling the <code>__init__</code> of class <code>A</code>, while <code>super(A, self).__init__('waaa')</code> is calling the <code>__init__</code> of class <code>B</code>.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Why is <code>super()</code> not respecting it's <code>type</code> argument?</li>
<li>How can I create an object <code>C</code> that has all the class attributes and methods of both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>?</li>
</ol>

"23264666","1","23384241","","2014-04-24 09:15:21","","1","359","<p>I have a Blender scene containing a bunch of objects. Some of these objects have a bone animation but most don't. I am trying to import the scene into Three.js including the animations on the correct objects. Here is a breakdown of the problem that I am experiencing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bone animation in Three.js only work when using THREE.SkinnedMesh.</li>
<li>Because of the animation data being on all objects, it's hard (if not impossible) to determine what object the animation is linked to, thus making it impossible to load those meshes as THREE.SkinnedMesh instead.</li>
<li>Even if it was possible to determine the object the animation belongs to, THREE.SceneLoader won't make these into skinnedmeshes itself, resulting in having to delete those objects the SceneLoader made and creating them again manually with a skinned mesh.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried to do this by manually exporting the animated meshes seperately from Blender so the bone animation data is only on those objects, but this raises a problem with the positioning of these objects since the position and rotation of the animated objects is only available in the scene.js exported file from Blender.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any possible way to export animated objects in Blender as
SkinnedMeshes right away, while keeping the rest of the scene intact?</li>
<li>Would it be possible to determine whether an object has an animation or not in Three.js?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I realized that since I get the objects with an animation separately anyway, I could loop over the scene geometry to check whether or not there is an animation available on the object, and create a SkinnedMesh for it if that's the case. The positioning problem still exists though: The (0,0,0) position and rotation in Three.js positions the object not at the center of the scene, but rather around some other point. I'm not sure what point this is, it could be the Blender scene center but I thought those two would be the same.</p>

I am running Oracle Linux, and used <code>yum install php</code> + <code>yum install httpd</code> to get my PHP and Apache.  I have scoured the internet and done a couple of things:</p>

<p>Firstly, I have gone into my httpd.conf file and added <code>LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so</code>.  I have chosen to use the one in my php.conf file, which is the exact same one.  Furthermore, I have done <code>AddType application/x-http-php .php</code>, so now my .php files are loading fine.</p>

<p>Secondly, I have tried to run my Apache server, and it works fine.  It displays my index.html file, which I set with DirectoryIndex.  However, when I tried to put php code into it, it got automatically commented out, which I assume is because I haven't set it to properly execute on the server side.</p>

<p>Now, with all that said, I am wondering what else I may be missing.  I have two set-ups, one where I have a .php file, and one where the php is inline with the html.</p>

<p><strong>index.html</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;?php echo ""Hello everybody.""; ?&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p><strong>index.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The index.php file loads fine, but the index.html doesn't run the php code.  How do I get the inlined version of php to work?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have set-up my Mac OS to work fine with .php files, but it is also having trouble with inline php within an Html file.  What am I missing?</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Html files themselves cannot include php.  Instead, the file must be a .php extension, and within a .php file, you can have text, html, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>Is there a way to say 'If you see a DLL request for AR3, send it to this new assembly named AR6'?  I don't believe I can use something like AppDomain.AssemblyResolve event because I don't have access to the code of the converter tool or the message boxes it brings up.</p>

<p>I know that <strong>if</strong> this is possible, it will likely blow up my reports and I'd have to build them new anyway, but my reports are super simple (lines, text boxes, shapes), so hopefully (maybe) if I can get this to work, it won't be AS hard.  No way to know until I try!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>HexIntegerLiteral</em> ::<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>0x</code><em>HexDigit</em><br>

<p>The way I understand it an HIL can look like this:</p>

<p>(HIL (HIL (HIL (HIL (HIL (HIL HD))))))</p>

<p>An HIL can look like <code>0x0</code> (that is <code>0x</code> and a Hex Digit) and an HD can be <code>0</code>, so an HIL can be <code>0x00x00x00x00x00</code></p>

<p>Obviously no implementation works like this, so I'm clearly misunderstanding something. How should I interpret (in my mind) this recursive definition?</p>

The task was to calculate the document frequencies (number of document that contain a certain term) for all the terms (uniquely) inside this huge corpus. Simply starting from the first file and calculating everything in a serialized manner seemed to be a dumb thing to do (I admit I did it just to see how disastrous it is).
I realized that if I do this calculation in a Map-Reduce manner, meaning clustering my data into smaller pieces and in the end aggregating the results, I would get the results much faster.</p>

<p>My PC has 4 cores, so I decided to separate my data into 3 distinct subsets and feeding each subset to a separate thread waiting for all the threads to finish their work and passing their results to a another method to aggregate everything. </p>

<p>I tests it with a very small set of data, worked fined. Before I use the actual data, I tested it with a larger set to I can study its behaviour better. I started jvisualvm and htop to see how the cpu and memory is working. I can see that 3 threads are running and cpu cores are also busy. But the usage of these cores are rarely above 50%. This means that my application is not really using the full power of my PC. is this related to my code, or is this how it is supposed to be. My expectation was that each thread uses as much cpu core resource as possible. </p>

<p>Steps attempted to fix:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checked out fresh copy of source from the repository</li>
<li>Verify other developers do not have this problem (their 2013 installs find tests)</li>
<li>Repair 2013</li>
<li>Remove 2013, reboot, install 2013</li>
<li>Created new WPF project and added test (that test discovered, but problem not solved)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.  My next step is to wipe the system, but that will be painful.</p>

<p>I have nltk installed on my computer(with all modules &amp; corpus from the book). My use case is to explore and contrast some lemmatization and stemming approaches for my dataset (I tried Porter lemmatization, which worked) </p>

<p>I was trying to use the <strong>lemmatization with Wordnet</strong> as described by @Chthonic Project here <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17684186/nltk-words-lemmatizing"">NLTK words lemmatizing</a> .

<pre><code>from nltk import compat
ImportError: cannot import name compat

<p>I googled around for the import error of compat(and it looked like compatibilty?) and here's what I tried on my ubuntu box:-</p>

<p><strong>sudo  find . -name compat*</strong> which returns the files below . I also tried <strong>sudo find  -name ""trac"" -type d</strong> which returns nothing . </p>

<p><em>Questions :</em></p>

<p><strong>1. What am I missing ?</strong> And is this an issue with trac/tests?  </p>

<p><strong>2. Is there a way to be able to use wordnet for lemmatization</strong> (from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn works just fine.

<p>And here is the class I wrote to extract the parameters coming from the Lua script function call.</p>

<pre><code>template&lt; unsigned int i &gt;

                return tUnpackLuaArgs&lt; i-1 &gt;::unpack( ideleg, L, argsVal..., tmpStr);
            }
            else if( t == LUA_TBOOLEAN)
            {
                bool tmpBool = lua_toboolean(L, i+1);
                return tUnpackLuaArgs&lt; i-1 &gt;::unpack( ideleg, L, argsVal..., tmpBool);
            }
            //etc.
        }
};


template&lt;&gt;
class tUnpackLuaArgs&lt;0&gt;
{
public:
    template&lt; class C, class Tr, class... Args, class... ArgsValue &gt;
    static Tr unpack( IDelegate&lt;C,Tr,Args...&gt;* ideleg, lua_State *L, ArgsValue... argsVal)
    {
        //-- Execute the registered method using the LUA arguments
        //-- and returns the returned value
        return (*ideleg)( argsVal... );
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>And here is how I use it:</p>

<pre><code>// Specialized template returning an integer
template &lt;class C, class... Args&gt;
struct LuaCall&lt;int, C, Args...&gt;
{
    static int LuaCallback(lua_State *L)
    {    
        //-- retrieve method ""IDelegate"" from Lua stack etc.
        //-- then call tUnpackLuaArgs with the arguments to push the returned value onto the lua stack
        lua_pushnumber(L, tUnpackLuaArgs&lt; sizeof...(Args) &gt;::unpack(funcPtr,L));
        return 1;
    }
};
</code></pre>

Suppose I add a new record to the program table using the form then my Program table should look like this:

<p>I actually want to get the effect of a combo box bound to a multivalue look-up field. I know we can't have multiple select option in combo box, so I thought of using a list box. But if there is any way I can get the list as a combo box with check boxes associated with each list item, which allows multiple select, that would be great.</p>

<p>Can someone give me some idea about how I can get this done.

<p>edit:
Thinking about it for a while, changing the path is not actually necessary for Launchpad-integration, as it only cares about the *.po files, not the compiled *.mo files.
My question still remains, though, as it would be nice if the application messed around with system directories as little as possible (especially considering that it's a multi-platform app that runs on *nix, Windows and OS X).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>sometimes i had to update the entity found by certain date and sometimes there is more than one. So i would like to see/edit and process a collection of form-blocks for each found entity in one ""big"" form. So i would have only one form with only one submit-button but several ""data-sections"" for each found entity</p>

<p>In order to achive this i tried to followed instructions in above-mentioned page but without success</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>// $data is an instance of Employee, so i can access Timeticks just by $data-&gt;getTimeticks-&gt;toArray()
$data = $this-&gt;getDoctrine()-&gt;getRepository('MyBundle:Employee')-&gt;myCustomFindMethod( $criteria ); 
$form = $this-&gt;createForm(new MyCombinedForm(), $data);
</code></pre>

<p>Each time I get an Exception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The form's view data is expected to be of type scalar, array or an instance of \ArrayAccess, >but is an instance of class MyBundle\Entity\Timetick. You can avoid this error by >setting the ""data_class"" option to ""MyBundle\Entity\Timetick"" or by adding a view >transformer that transforms an instance of class MyBundle\Entity\Timetick to >scalar, array or an instance of \ArrayAccess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I followed the advice and added 'data_class' to ny <code>MyCombinedForm</code> FormType o now it looks like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>class MyCombinedForm extends AbstractType 
{
  public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
  {
    // continas only 'timeticks'
    $builder-&gt;add('timeticks', 'collection', array(
    'type' =&gt; new TimetickType(),
    'data_class' =&gt; 'MyBundle\Entity\Timetick', //ADDED!
    ));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but now i gen another Aception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The form's view data is expected to be an instance of class MyBundle\Entity\Timetick, but is >an instance of class Doctrine\ORM\PersistentCollection. You can avoid this error by setting >the ""data_class"" option to null or by adding a view transformer that transforms an instance >of class Doctrine\ORM\PersistentCollection to an instance of MyBundle\Entity\Timetick.</p>

<p>However, I have since extended my program so that rather than a 'person1' there is an array or people maintained in the AppDelegate.  I figured that I could simply keep the person1 attribute however, and use it to return the first item in the list:</p>

<pre><code>- (Person *)person1{
    return [[self people] objectAtIndex:0];

<p>I have confirmed everything is created correctly (<strong>during runtime</strong>), but I can't get the bound table column to display the first names of person1's kids.</p>

<p>but it is not working. if i clik on any part of the form, nothing happens.</p>

<p>i tried     <code>htmlPanel.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()</code> and     <code>frame.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()</code> both but no help.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>i tried your suggestion, and i choosed BrowsertPanel instead of HtmlPanel, then i tried to get its component as follow:</p>

<pre><code>org.lobobrowser.gui.AddressBarPanel[,0,0,0x0,invalid,layout=javax.swing.BoxLayout,alignmentX=0.0,alignmentY=0.0,border=,flags=9,maximumSize=,minimumSize=,preferredSize=]

org.lobobrowser.gui.StatusBarPanel[,0,0,0x0,invalid,layout=javax.swing.BoxLayout,alignmentX=0.0,alignmentY=0.0,border=javax.swing.border.BevelBorder@c2a132,flags=9,maximumSize=,minimumSize=,preferredSize=]
</code></pre>

<p>also i added a navigationListener and when it navigates, i get the event as follow:</p>

<pre><code>org.lobobrowser.ua.NavigationEvent[source=FramePanel[windowId=BrowserPanel.10481519,hashCode=23491286,parent=org.lobobrowser.gui.FillerComponent[,0,25,584x316,layout=org.lobobrowser.util.gui.WrapperLayout,alignmentX=0.0,alignmentY=0.0,border=,flags=0,maximumSize=java.awt.Dimension[width=32767,height=32767],minimumSize=java.awt.Dimension[width=0,height=0],preferredSize=java.awt.Dimension[width=32767,height=32767]]]]
</code></pre>

<p>but i feel im lost in these components, it seems the <code>FillerComponent</code> or <code>FramePanel</code> are responsible for rendering, even so, i have no idea how to add listener to  them.</p>

<p>also found this <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/xamj/forums/forum/467020/topic/2119642"" rel=""nofollow"">Link</a> that someone described the steps to solve the problem, but seems so complicated to me? is there any pseudocode to distribute?</p>

<p>I got a ""NotSupportedException"" in this line :</p>

<pre><code>bool userValid = db.user.Any(u =&gt; SHA512.VerifyHash(plainPassword, u.salt, u.password) &amp;&amp; u.username_canonical == username);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>LINQ to Entities does not recognize the method 'Boolean VerifyHash(System.String, System.String, System.String)' method, and this method cannot be translated into a store expression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is what in my mind :
VerifyHash returns true if the provided password (uncrypted) matches with the crypted one stored in database (by getting the salt corresponding to the username, in database and re-encrypting the provided password with this salt, then compare the newly encrypted hash with the stored one).
Usernames are uniques.</p>

<p>I understand that it doesn't accept my VerifyHash method inside the ""Any"" one. But I don't know how to do else because I need the corresponding salt and encrypted password (u.salt and u.password) in addition to the matching username to verify the password.</p>

<p>I tried to use the ""Find"" method in the same way but it doesn't work (VS Error, by memory I need the user ID to pass it as a parameter). I'm new with LinQ to Entities.</p>

<p>Any idea ? Forgive my eventual english mistakes.</p>

this question is probably closest to my case:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17941225/using-entity-framework-on-multiple-databases"">Using entity framework on multiple databases</a></p>

<p>The responders mention EF6 having better support for this but despite several days of looking through blogs, posts, and whitepapers I cannot see how to query on multiple databases.</p>

<p>The scenario is like his.  Multitenant database structure with one central database which we want to use for shared resources, common data across all tenants. So  for example our categorization may be stored in the global (Since it is the same for all databases) but the tenant's data would be stored in his specific database.</p>

<p>What I Want to do  is simple and I have been able to do it in linqpad:</p>

<pre><code>var query= (from s in GlobalDatabase.Category
join  TP  in  TenantProduct on s.catid equals  UG.catid
select new { s.catid, TP.Productid}
);
query.Dump(); 
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CBbAy.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CBbAy.png"" alt=""LINQPad Screenshot""></a></p>

<p>Is this possible in  EF6\C# ?<br>
I guess the question is how can I transform this into something that would work as a linq statement in  a project?
Considering  that I used Linqpad's capability of joining 2 connections together is linq pad simply using 2 different contexts?</p>

<p>What I really wanted to end up with was one connection  (one login)  that has access to both databases?</p>

The modules are supposed to use objects which are defined in a DLL imported by all the components of the application. Here is what a sample object would look like:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;boost/system/api_config.hpp&gt;

#if defined BOOST_WINDOWS_API
    #ifdef EXPORT
        #define API    __declspec(dllexport)
    #else
        #define API    __declspec(dllimport)
    #endif
#else
    #define API
#endif

class A
{
public:
    API A();
    API virtual ~A();
};
</code></pre>

<p>All DLLs are built statically (with their own CRT) and with the exact same compilation flags. I know that exchanging objects through DLL boundaries can get hairy, so I use <code>boost::shared_ptr</code>s almost everywhere. There is one difficulty around the object constructors though: if I create the object on the stack (from a different DLL), everything works as expected. But if I use the operator <code>new</code>, the heap gets corrupted whet the object is deleted.</p>

<pre><code>A a; // Works fine, no problem when the object goes out of scope.

A* b = new A();
delete b; // Causes heap corruption!
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way around this? I feel that the code would be less readable if I had to define a method in the object's DLL such as <code>A* A::create() { return new A(); }</code>. In the worst scenario, I'm thinking of making the <code>new</code> operator private, to make sure that the user won't use it.</p>

In the book's sect. 11.2.4, Stroustrup writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ""placement <code>delete</code>"" operators do nothing except possibly inform a garbage collector that the deleted pointer is no longer safely derived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies that sound programming practice will follow an explicit call to a destructor by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/6784035"">a call to placement <code>delete</code></a>.</p>

<p>Fair enough.  However, is there no better syntax to call placement <code>delete</code> than the obscure</p>

<pre><code>::operator delete(p);
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I ask is that Stroustrup's sect. 11.2.4 mentions no such odd syntax.  Indeed, Stroustrup does not dwell on the matter; he mentions no syntax at all.  I vaguely dislike the look of <code>::operator</code>, which interjects the matter of namespace resolution into something that properly has nothing especially to do with namespaces.  Does no more elegant syntax exist?</p>

<p>For reference, here is Stroustrup's quote in fuller context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, operator <code>new</code> creates its object on the free store.  What
  if we wanted the object allocated elsewhere?...  We can place objects
  anywhere by providing an allocator function with extra arguments and
  then supplying such extra arguments when using <code>new</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void* operator new(size_t, void* p) { return p; }

void buf = reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(0xF00F);
X* p2 = new(buf) X;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Because of this usage, the <code>new(buf) X</code> syntax for supplying extra
  arguments to <code>operator new()</code> is known as the <em>placement syntax.</em>
  Note that every <code>operator new()</code> takes a size as its first argument
  and that the size of the object allocated is implicitly supplied.
  The <code>operator new()</code> used by the <code>new</code> operator is chosen by the
  usual argument-matching rules; every <code>operator new()</code> has
  a <code>size_t</code> as its first argument.</p>
  
  <p>The ""placement"" <code>operator new()</code> is the simplest such allocator.  It
  is defined in the standard header <code>&lt;new&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void* operator new (size_t, void* p) noexcept;
void* operator new[](size_t, void* p) noexcept;

void* operator delete (void* p, void*) noexcept; // if (p) make *p invalid
void* operator delete[](void* p, void*) noexcept;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The ""placement <code>delete</code>"" operators do nothing except possibly inform a
  garbage collector that the deleted pointer is no longer safely
  derived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stroustrup then continues to discuss the use of placement <code>new</code> with arenas.  He does not seem to mention placement <code>delete</code> again.</p>

Each database is designed to serve different data set (meaning - we have multiple roles in each database). one user can access as many as all database (1 or 2 or any number upto 15).  Users typically run the workflows which includes access to multiple databases usually 3-4 databases at a time. During peak time multiple users run similar workflows accessing many databases.</p>

<p>Out of 15 databases, we have 5 databases with heavy load, for rest of them it is nominal load. </p>

<p>Recently we started experiencing high CPU and memory issues on this server and we are planing to implement SQL Server Resource governor. </p>

<p>Below is my requirement (and questions) for SQL Server Resource Governor :
1. I like to restrict any single user take more CPU (let say more than 60%) at any time.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I put users in a single resourse group based on database or role - how that will impact other users in the same group. For example - if we have 3 users in a group and user-1 started the process and it max out the CPU for that group and when other users start their own process - what will be the impact?</p></li>
<li><p>Is is better to configure based on :
a. per database 
b. per role
c. per user
d. any other suggestion?</p></li>
<li><p>Can anyone provide a typical approach for the following case:
3 users have access to 3 databases and they all are heavy users and runs jobs at the same time - what is the best way to configure this scenario. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any suggestions are welcome also let me know if you need any other information to answer in better manner.</p>

"5652156","1","5652658","","2011-04-13 16:01:03","","6","4419","<p>I'm doing custom rendering in a Decorator subclass.  Our rendering requires creating complex geometries which only neded to be re-created when the actual rendered size changes.  As such, I have moved the geometry creation into its own function called <code>UpdateGeometry</code> which creates, then freezes the geometry for use in <code>OnRender</code>.  This new function only needs to be called in response to a change in <code>ActualWidth</code> or <code>ActualHeight</code>.</p>

<p>Even better, it looks like we should be able to simply override <code>OnRenderSizeChanged</code>, which according to the documentation states...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""When overridden in a derived class,
  participates in rendering operations
  that are directed by the layout
  system. This method is invoked <strong><em>after
  layout update, and before rendering</em></strong>,
  if the element's RenderSize has
  changed as a result of layout update.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, regardless if I'm using the override or listening to the property change notifications of <code>ActualWidth</code> and <code>ActualHeight</code>, my logging consistently shows <code>OnRender</code> as happening first!  Um... Wha??</p>

<p>To be sure it wasn't something I was doing in my code, I created a bare-bones test decorator subclass and added logging there, both on entry and exit to the overrides.  Here is the entire class...</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Windows.Controls;

public class TestControl : Decorator
{

    protected override void OnRender(System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""OnRender Entered"");

        base.OnRender(drawingContext);

        Console.WriteLine(""OnRender Exited"");
    }

    protected override void OnRenderSizeChanged(System.Windows.SizeChangedInfo sizeInfo)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""OnRenderSizeChanged Entered"");

        base.OnRenderSizeChanged(sizeInfo);

        Console.WriteLine(""OnRenderSizeChanged Exited"");
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And as I feared... here is the output...</p>

<pre><code>OnRender Entered
OnRender Exited
OnRenderSizeChanged Entered
OnRenderSizeChanged Exited
</code></pre>

<p>So what am I missing here?</p>

<p>More importantly, how can I get the <code>ActualWidth</code> and <code>ActualHeight</code> values after the layout subsystem has done its job, but before the control is rendered so I can create the geometry before it's needed in the <code>OnRender</code> override?</p>

<p>My latest implementation overrides <code>ArrangeOverride</code> as the value that's passed in there is a size containing what the <code>ActualWidth</code> and <code>ActualHeight</code> values <strong><em>should</em></strong> be after the core layout system takes into consideration <code>HorizontalAlignment</code> and <code>VerticalAlignment</code> with values of 'Stretch', minimums and maximums, etc, but what they actually are depends on the value that's returned from that override so it's a little more complex than that.</p>

<p>Either way, I'm still wondering why the <code>OnRenderSizeChanged</code> call doesn't happen when it's supposed to.  Thoughts?</p>

<p>Here is where I use the settings: </p>

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it's breaking on the second ""if"" statement of the above code, where I'm calling settings[""firstUser""][""id""], as shown in the error below: </p>

<pre><code>TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstUser' of undefined

<p>Obviously, I understand that the settings property is undefind, or null. What I don't understand is why? Even if I didn't set the $NODE_ENV=production (which I have), it <em>should</em> still fall back to the development settings. Help is appreciated!</p>

<p>So far, I've managed to get routes setup in ASP.NET MVC that match the ActiveResource conventions.  But where I'm having problems is with de-serializing the data that ActiveResource sends to the REST service.</p>

<p>It seems that Rails does xml serialization very different than .NET (but I haven't been able to find these conventions documented anywhere).  For example, with a .NET class like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person
{
  public string first_name { get; set; }
  public string last_name { get; set; }
  public bool active { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some of the differences:</p>

<ol>
<li>.NET serializes the root as &lt;Person> while rails does &lt;person></li>
<li>.NET adds a namespace while rails does not</li>
<li>.NET serializes the properties like &lt;first_name> while rails does &lt;first-name></li>
<li>.NET serializes the bool as &lt;active> while rails does &lt;active type=""boolean""></li>
</ol>

<p>Number 4 doesn't seem to cause any problems, but the other 3 cause .NET to not de-serialize the message.  You can solve these problems by decorating the object with XmlRoot and XmlElement attributes.  But this is error prone and tedious.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a better way to de-serialize XML in .NET which has been serialized by Rails' ActiveResource?</p>

This works because I set the culture in the session.</p>

If it is the default language it should not be showed in the url, only if it is not the default language it should show it in the url.</p>

The first one (initial view) features a play button to start a music stream and image for album cover of currently playing song. This scene has a a navigation controller and a bar button on it that will lead the user to the next view...</p>

<p>A list view populated with hard coded stream's that the user can choose from. Very simple and working fine still.</p>

<p>After choosing one, the user goes to a preview page that tells them about the stream before it begins to play. Still working like a charm until they want to continue from here.</p>

<p>If they user selects the stream from the preview page, the app ""should"" return the user to the initial ViewController and swap out the playing stream for the one selected. At first, I was mistakenly creating a new instance of the initial viewController, and after fixing that mistake, now have a few more questions someone might be able to help me with.</p>

<p>here is the IBAction for the button to select the stream:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)returnHome:(id)sender 
{
    [[self navigationController] popToRootViewControllerAnimated:YES]; // goes back to first view on the stack
}
</code></pre>

<p>Before finding this logic, I was using the prepareForSegue and setting the stream value of the destination to be what was selected. I was also trying to save the state of the first view but was unsure how to pass it down the line (or retain it) since I am moving through 3 ViewControllers and using a modal segue so they can go back if they choose to not pick a new stream.</p>

<p>Any advice will help, but please refrain from simply posting a link to the references. I have been there for 3 days straight and they do not speak a very beginner friendly lingo in the iOS reference docs.</p>

In IE, all the text (except the H2) gets the font-primary style.  In Chrome, the text in the table gets the wrong font-size (or so I think) - it's described like this in rev tools:</p>

<pre><code>color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
display: table-cell;
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif;
font-size: 16px;
font-weight: normal;
height: 76px;
vertical-align: top;
width: 390px;
</code></pre>

<p>That font size should be smaller (in my opinion) and is in IE10.</p>

<p>Here's the html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""step-page font-primary""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""content-panel-0""&gt;
        &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""content-panel-1""&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;PERSONAL SHIPPING&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Descriptions&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;table class=""content-desc""&gt;
                &lt;tbody&gt;
                    &lt;tr&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;Standard&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;Standard transport service&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;/tr&gt;

                    &lt;tr&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;Delivery&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;Residential delivery service&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;/tbody&gt;
            &lt;/table&gt;

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I'm trying to create a library of functions for this database (for an e-cart system) so that the database can be managed by an admin (like a CMS).</p>

<p>I chose InnoDB engine to make use of foreign keys and transactions.</p>

<p>I'm also using PHP PDO objects rather than the standard <code>mysql_</code>-functions to make use of parametrized queries.</p>

<p>This is the SQL creation code for these tables:</p>

<pre><code># TBL_MENU_CATEGORY

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tbl_menu_category;
CREATE TABLE tbl_menu_category(
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    PRIMARY KEY(id),
    name VARCHAR(50)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;

# TBL_PRODUCT_CATEGORY

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tbl_product_category;
CREATE TABLE tbl_product_category(
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    PRIMARY KEY(id),
    name VARCHAR(50)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;


# TBL_MENU_CAT_BASKET

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tbl_menu_cat_basket;
CREATE TABLE tbl_menu_cat_basket(
    menu_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(menu_id) REFERENCES tbl_menu_category(id),
    cat_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(cat_id) REFERENCES tbl_product_category(id)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;


# TBL_PRODUCT_CAT_BASKET

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tbl_product_cat_basket;
CREATE TABLE tbl_product_cat_basket(
    cat_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(cat_id) REFERENCES tbl_product_category(id),
    product_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES tbl_product(id)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a function in the library to add a Submenu to a Menu (Menu > Submenu > Product).</p>

<pre><code>function addSubmenu($menu_id, $sub_name) {
    $success = false;
    if ( dbTransaction() ) {
        $sql = ""INSERT INTO tbl_product_cat(name) VALUES ('?');"";
        dbQuery($sql, array($sub_name));
        $rows = dbRowsAffected();
        if ($rows == 1) {
            $cat_id = dbLastInsertId();
            $sql = ""INSERT INTO tbl_menu_cat_basket(menu_id, cat_id) VALUES ('?','?');"";
            dbQuery($sql, array((int)$menu_id, (int)$cat_id));
            $rows = dbRowsAffected();
            if ($rows == 1) {
                $success = true;
            }
        }
        if ($success)
            dbCommit();
            return ""Add submenu successful."";
        else
            dbRollback();
            return ""Add submenu failed."";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The query is executed like this:</p>

<pre><code>require_once ""pdo.php""; # Creates PDO object '$db'
$query;

function dbQuery($sql, $data) {
    global $db, $query;
    $query = $db-&gt;prepare($sql);
    $query-&gt;execute($data);
}

# other PDO &amp; PDOStatement methods like this
# (rowCount, lastInsertId, fetchAll, transaction-stuff).
</code></pre>

<h1>Problems</h1>

<p>I'm not even sure if this is correct. Am I following the right path or doing things wrongly?</p>

<p>Now I'm stuck on creating similar functions for updating a record which also have foreign keys. I know that InnoDB will throw an error that the record can't be updated because it has references (I think?).</p>

<p>I need to know the correct procedure for updating records and the functions available to me for doing so.</p>

<p>I want to know about ON DELETE and ON UPDATE constraints but I can't seem to find any good, newb-friendly tutorials (the MySQL docs are very unfriendly and don't even highlight syntax).</p>

<h1>What I want to do</h1>

<p>When updating records I want to cascade the update so that all references are updated.</p>

<p>When deleting records I just want to delete the record that was deleted BUT any references to it can be reset instead (if a product category is deleted the products should NOT be deleted; if a product is deleted all orders with that product should NOT be deleted but the product value set to 0 or null)</p>

<p>How can I do this with ON DELETE and ON UPDATE -or- what procedures should I take to achieve what I want to do here?</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>it will come back as video/3gp which my app takes to mean it is of the type ""video"" and tries to make thumbnails and what not (I use the first part of the mime type to determine what type my app categorizes it as).
However it is audio so certain things I expect to work will not work (such as creating a thumbnail for the video). Are there any libraries or anything available by android which would allow me to tell if the file is a video audio only?

<p>Each Objects have overriden equals() and hashCode() methods.</p>

<p>Non of the datastructures will need any removal, as old data will be used for statistics etc.</p>

<p>It is also important that the datastructures contains no duplicates. </p>

<p>Methods that will be used on these datastructures are for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the insurance/claim of a specific personId.</li>
<li>Find all claims/insurances submitted at a given timeframe.</li>
<li>Find a person based on personId or personalNumber</li>
<li>Find all persons with a specific lastName</li>
<li>Find all active insurances to a specific person.</li>
<li>Find all insurances/claims of a specific subclass type (e.g. CarInsurance or HomeInsurance, both are sublcasses to Insurance)</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on till you named it. Any kind of data that fits a comprehensive statistics- and search functionality.</p>

<p>A lot of these methods will be using an advanced for loop with an iterator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As it stands now, the only way to link a Person to its insurances is
  by comparing the uniquePersonId variables to each other. Would it be
  better to also have each Person own a List with object references to
  its Insurances and Claims?</p>
  
  <p>Additionally have each Insurance/Claim have an object reference to its
  parent/owner? Or is this considered bad practice, by the ""seperation
  of concerns""? </p>
  
  <p>It would make methods such as determining boolean totalCustomer(True if you have
  more than 3 active insurances) much easier to place inside the Person
  class. Any suggestions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Anyhow, to the main question.</strong> What Collections would be best suited for each datastructure? (Limited to Java Collections)</p>

<p>Currently/temporarily I have 3 ArrayLists with a if(!list.contains(newElement)) { add(newElement) }; to prevent duplicates.</p>

<p>Isn't ArrayList faster than HashSet or HashMap when iterating through a for loop? But is it substantially fast enough to be of value? </p>

<p>I've been thinking that HashSet would be a better pracitice considering no duplicates are allowed, or is my ""solution to duplicates"" good enough? HashMap could make sense for Persons considering uniquePersonId will be used everytime an Insurance or Claim is searched for. </p>

<p>However I still want the functionality of searching for personalNumber or any other member of person for that matter. Will iterating like this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1066589/iterate-through-a-hashmap/1066607#1066607"">Iterate through a HashMap</a> still be effective enough, and make for good programming design?</p>

<p>I have spent countless hours on stackoverflow and google trying to figure this out. Any suggestions and help would be very much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>edit: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2773824"">Difference between HashSet and HashMap?</a> Was linked as possible duplicate question, however that thread only explains the difference between HashSet and HashMap, with a link to Oracles Collection tutorial. I'm aware of most of the differences. I have also read the Collection tutorial. But because of a wide usage of the structures, I'm still having some difficulties finding the most fitting Collection. My main goal is regarding what would make for the best data-structure design. Sorry if I was being unclear.</p>

<p>Originally, I wanted to bold some dates in the TDateTimePicker dropdown calendar; but I quickly found out that I couldn't - so I'm trying to overlap a TMonthCalendar (with which you can do bold dates) on top of the TDateTimePicker dropdown calendar (simple, right?)</p>

<p>But not so fast: somehow, the TDateTimePicker dropdown calendar always shows up ON TOP of my TMonthCalendar. I would like to have the TMonthCalendar show up on top instead.</p>

<p>Here is what I figured I could do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Position TMonthCalendar under the TDateTimePicker (where its dropdown would usually show)</li>
<li>Make visible the TMonthCalendar on the TDateTimePicker's OnDropDown event</li>
<li>Hide the TMonthCalendar on the TDateTimePicker's OnCloseUp event</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is what is happening:</p>

<ol>
<li>When I click on the dropdown triangle on the TDateTimePicker, the TMonthCalendar becomes visible (yay!)</li>
<li>But the TDateTimePicker dropdown calendar always takes precedent (TMonthCalendar is always underneath the dropdown)</li>
<li>Therefore I can't do anything with the TMonthCalendar until I've picked a date on the TDateTimePicker dropdown (I can't even see the bolded dates because TMonthCalendar is underneath).</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is what I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>TMonthCalendar.Show on the OnDropDown event of the TDateTimePicker (this is supposed to bring whatever is Show-ed to the top). But this does nothing.</li>
<li>Do DateMode: dmDropDown -> DateMode: dmUpDown on TDateTimePicker's OnDropDown (thus disabling the dropdown calendar). But this has problems since clicking anywhere on the MonthCalendar (including the change Month buttons on either side of the top) will render the MonthCalendar to become invisible (I'm doing ""if MonthCalendar.Visible then visible := false"" in MonthCalendarOnClick)</li>
</ul>

<p>I know the solution is probably simple, but I can't think of a way to do this. So far the few ideas that I've come up with aren't working :(
So if you can think of of a way to do what I want, please help me out.</p>

This is the way we designed it, and it works perfectly. However, now we need some of the data to stay. We have included some user-editable fields, and need one of the entities to have some of the old information. I tried to make a fetch-request for the entire entity, store them in an array, and delete the entity, then update to new data, and then push over the old data from the stored array. However, all the data on the array gets wiped when I clear out the Core Data.. We have tried with NSArray, NSMutableArray, and initializing with initWithArray:a copyItems:YES..

<p>In ""Discover"" mode, SnmpB queries by broadcasting 255.255.255.255 (checked with Wireshark) and I receive a GET request with standard OID (sysDescr, sysUpTime, sysContact, sysName and sysLocation). It finds my instance with the information I coded (""My System"", ""Myself"", ...) (note that it also works when I enter the IP address under the ""IP networks"" textboxes, though I don't see any traffic on Wireshark but I receive the GET request):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ss2cQ.png"" alt=""SnmpB discovery""></p>

<p>I did write a very simple MIB file that I imported into SnmpB. I defines a single <code>Integer32</code> data that I want to retrieve using an SNMP GET request from SnmpB.</p>

<p>However, using the <strong>same code</strong> than for the standard sys* OID, SnmpB doesn't seem to receive that data (""Timeout"" in red on the top-right):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KI0o1.png"" alt=""SnmpB timeout""></p>

<p>I did try Wireshark to check network activity and I don't see anything, so I guess it takes place on localhost (which is <a href=""http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/Loopback"" rel=""nofollow"">not accessible with Wireshark on Windows</a>)? But the traces below show it does not (<code>peerAddress=192.168.56.1</code>)...</p>

<p>I'd like to use WCF but it seems that the user needs admin rights in order to launch the service. Would the user need admin rights if the WCF service was running within a managed application (e.g. a Windows Service)? With sockets it seems that admin rights isn't required to open the relevant port.</p>

<p>How would HTTPS security work in WCF? Since this is a LAN program (user talking from client to their own machine), do I need to purchase a certificate and install it on their machines? I'd rather avoid this if possible as the data being transferred isn't sensitive. Would this be the same if I use SSLStream for sockets?</p>

It retrieves pages of articles from a server. We have got >25000 articles; so I have implemented a pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling to travel across the title collection. 
The ones downloaded persist using core data; <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> is used to automatically update the <code>UITableView</code>. </p>

<p>However, I have implemented the infinite scrolling to be in both direction; up and down. Since the user will be allow to scroll down the 25000 article titles, I have to remove the one that the user has already scrolled. If the user scrolls up, I have to re-insert title above the current one. 
Doing  so, I have got a moving window inside the article collection. </p>

<p>I display my articles by date group using the section and header. </p>

<p>The problem is that because the infinite scrolling goes in both direction, I often delete or add article at a higher position in the table.

This third-party source serves as the 'content deliverer' who is untrusted and voluntarily serving the movie. I have checksums of, say, 1MB blocks of data to verify integrity. This makes it possible to have multiple deliverers without worrying about content modification.</p>

<p>The problem is that the videos are ~1-2GB, which makes it difficult to download before watching as that kills the streaming idea. I had tried using libvlc with a locally-running NanoHTTPD server on the device which served as a verification pass of the 1MB blocks. The problem with this is that VLC doesn't seem to support partial content at start. As soon as the request came in, I replied with <code>206 Partial Content</code> and gave a partial response, headers set appropriately. LibVLC played it, and died after 3 seconds because it assumed this was the end of the file and didn't issue another HTTP request.</p>

<p>I have tried the same with ExoPlayer (from Google) and Android's MediaPlayer/VideoView but all had the same problem. Google chrome, however, plays it perfectly fine.</p>

<p>I'm now looking for alternatives to be able to stream from unknown sources while only knowing checksums of blocks (or whatever verification method) without downloading the entire video or hurting the servers. I liked the idea of partial content but it just doesn't work as I hoped.</p>

    where: ""'name' starts with "" + stateCode
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>name being the column with the 4 digit code and stateCode being a variable that has the 2 digit code for the state stored in it.</p>

<p>I also tried:</p>

<pre><code>map.setOptions({
   'query':
      {
      select: 'geometry', 
      from: ftnumber, 
      where: ""'name' like "" + stateCode + ""__""
      }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The second option is preferable (if it's possible) as I could use that syntax to drill even further down if needed.</p>

<p><strong>Final Solution:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Column 'name' is set to number</li>
<li><p>query is </p>

<p>stateCodeHigh = stateCode + 100;
map.setOptions({
   'query':
      {
      select: 'geometry', 
      from: ftnumber, 
      where: ""name >= "" + stateCode + "" AND name &lt; "" + stateCodeHigh
      }
});</p></li>
</ul>

I want to change the collapse behaviour (where it becomes a dropdown menu below a certain screen width) so that my custom Javascript function is run, instead of the drop down menu being created. This is because I'm making more extensive changes to the interface for smaller screens, than just CSS would allow (e.g. I'm moving UI elements around in the DOM etc).</p>

<p>Should I just switch off the collapse behaviour of the navbar, and if so how?</p>

<p>And then I'm thinking on both page load and page resize (using JQuery's resize() event) I check new window width and trigger the mobile UI (via my function) if width is below the collapse point?</p>

<p>Or is there a better way of doing this?</p>

<p>Any thoughts appreciated!

int size = seda.getExchanges().size();
System.out.println(""size [""+size+""]"");

<p>This prints a size of 0 each time.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/wVp8j/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/wVp8j/</a></p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;input type='text' required /&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;check field validity&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JS:</p>

<pre><code>var field = document.querySelector('input[type=text]');
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Validates: '+field.willValidate);
    alert('Value missing: '+field.validity.valueMissing);
}, false);
</code></pre>

<p>If the form is submitted with the field left blank, submission is suppressed, as you'd expect, but the first alert, checking the field's validity state, gives <code>true</code>. <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>To contradict this further, the second alert confirms there's a problem with the field and also gives <code>true</code>, as expected.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p>[Sidenote: MDN <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation#Constraint_validation_process"" rel=""nofollow"">seems to think</a> <code>willValidate</code> is a method, not a property.]</p>

<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>]</p>

<p>As the commenter below points out, <code>willValidate</code> says whether the field is a <strong>candidate</strong> for validation, not, despite its misleading name, whether the field will validate.</p>

<p>Which presumably means the only means of telling whether a field will validate, should the form be submitted, via JS, is to iterate over its <code>validity</code> object and see if any flag is set to true.</p>

<p>[<strong>EDIT 2</strong>]</p>

<p>Turns out you can just check <code>validity.valid</code> on a field, even though the <code>valid</code> flag doesn't show up if you <code>console.log</code> the entire validity object. This would appear to be the way, therefore, to find out whether a field will hypothetically validate.</p>

HOST = raw_input (""Enter the IP Address Of the switch:"")

child = pexpect.spawn ('telnet', [HOST])
child.logfile = open(""/home/tester/scripts/config.txt"", ""w"")

<p>==============================</p>

<p>As you can see if I ran the above script, the output of the commands sent via the script will be saved to the config.txt file. The contents will be erased if a different switch is telnet'd into and contents from the new switch will be saved. So, I would like the script to use the IP address entered by the user and then save the output of the commands in a different file using the IP address as the filename, so that contents of the file do not get over-written.</p>

<p>Code works fine for single files.
With a file zipped using ZipArchive, I can manually unzip using WinRAR, then rezip using WinRAR, and then ZipArchive can successfully unzip that file.
The problem is that ZipArchive won't extract the archive that it directly zipped.
I can also see in Notepad++ that the ZipArchive zip is different from the WinRAR zip, and the file size is different. I can successfully call winrar as a system command in php for the desired functionality, but this seems like a bad idea.
Is there some reason ZipArchive creates zip files that it can't extract?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>So, for example. When I first open the page and select option B and then in my chrome console (and javascript) I type</p>

<pre><code>$('#select_a).val() 
</code></pre>

<p>and this returns 'b'. If I then navigate around the remained of the site and then come back to the same page and change the option to option C and type in the same command 'b' is still returned. The same problem is observed with the text input. i.e. if the input is left blank - after navigating no value is returned. Similarly if a number is left in the input field when navigating blank the input field is empty but a value is returned...</p>

<p>So, the values of these inputs are persisting after navigation and are not changing even when, in the case of the select, the value appears to be changed. Why is this?</p>

<p>So let's say that I had the following code in the past of my manual reference count environment:</p>

<pre><code>// Manual reference count environment (using ""alloc"" prefix as method returns a retained NSArray)
- (NSArray *)allocMyArray {
    NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObject:@""this is just a sample code""];

    return array;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can I change the above method name in a full ARC environment from allocMyArray to myArray?</p>

<p>Is the following code has a valid naming convention and also isn't leaking in ARC environment?</p>

<pre><code>// ARC environment
- (NSArray *)myArray {
    NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObject:@""this is just a sample code""];

    return array;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In general, should I ever use the ""alloc"" or ""new"" method prefix in a full ARC environment or is this naming convention is meaningless in ARC environment and has no effect on the compiler?</p>

This part works fine, as shown below. What I would like to do, though, is change the first column ($item_id into a series of sequential numbers that restart when the original (numeric) value of $item_id changes.</p>

4
1
2
3

1

<p>This could either replace the first column or be a new fourth column.
I understand that I might do this through a series of if-else statements and tried this, but that doesn't seem to play well with the while procedure I've already got working for me. - Thanks, Thom Shepard</p>

It ends up being huge. When the web session times out (four hours after the user has finished using the application) sometimes their database transactions get rolled back. I'm assuming this is because the DB connection is not being closed properly when IIS kills the session.</p>

<p>Anyway, my question is what should be in the session variable? Clearly some things need to be in there. The user selects which plan they want to edit on the main screen, so the plan id goes into the session variable. Is it better to try and reduce the load on the DB by storing all the details about the user (and their manager etc.) and the plan they are editing in the session variable or should I try to minimise the stuff in the session variable and query the DB for everything I need in the Page_Load event?</p>

  For i = 2 To Len(txt) Step 1
    If Asc(Mid(txt, i, 1)) &gt; 96 Then

    Else
      Hold = Hold &amp; "" "" &amp; Mid(txt, i, 1)
    End If
  Next
  SplitCamel = Hold
End Function

WScript.Echo SplitCamel( ""CSDVersion"" ) ' Returns: ""C S D Version""

<p>My belief is that I am replacing my variable with each new number as it is not setup as an array. I started experimenting with map, but I haven't had any luck with it yet. </p>

<p>Suggestions or insight if <code>map</code> is the right way to go or if there is something else that I am just not seeing?</p>

I am having some difficulties with the part regarding the RNG, which I use <code>boost/random</code> for. I am using OpenMP for the multithreading. I can understand that the variate generator of Boost does not support safe multithreading, but I am trying hard to find a way out of this, having had no luck so far. Note that the function <code>norm</code> is used later in my program, but this time on a single thread. I'm mentioning this, since it may rule out some solutions (or maybe not).. </p>

<p><strong>My own approach so far</strong>: I have tried safe-guarding by using <code>#pragma omp critical</code> before generating the number, but in that case multithreading does not yield an increase in computation speed (I have compared by timing...)</p>

<p>I have deliberately posted the simplest version of my problem, so solutions can be illustrated, if desired. Even though I am using OpenMP, I am also willing to switch to Boost.Thread, if it is easier to achieve there such that I get see some progress.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KQRBq.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KQRBq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If I continue to step through, I get this error for a ton of other files.  Some examples:  GoogleWebAuthorizationBroker.cs, GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.cs, etc.  </p>

<p>Eventually if I keep stepping through I get a System.AggregateException:  An unhandled exception of type 'System.AggregateException' occurred in mscorlib.dll</p>

<p>I'm sure it's something silly and simple.  Any advice would be most helpful, thank you!</p>

<p>In this view I have a ""Save All"" Button that save each row in an iteration, triggering jQuery custom events, to serialize the saving operations and prevent the generation an uncontrolled queue of requests.</p>

<p>Each time a row is saved, the program decrement the counter and launch the save of the new row.</p>

<p>Everithing ends when there where no rows to save (counter = 0).</p>

<p>This is a code snippet doing this:</p>

<pre><code>var save_counter = -1;

// Creates a counter and save content header when finished to save rows.
var updCounter = function(evt){

    // Update Counter
    save_counter--;

    // Register updates When there are not rows to skip

};

// Reset Save Counter
save_counter = saveRows.length;

// Iterate through lines
saveRows.each(function(idx){

    // Execute Uptade Counter once
    form.one(update_counter, updCounter);

    // Per each performed save, decrese save counter
    form.trigger('submit');
});

    // ""Trigger"" the row saving, changing the counter value
    $scope.saveAll = function () {

    };

    // Watch the counter and perform the saving
    $scope.$watch('save_counter', function(

Can any one suggest or complete the code (which will be really very great) to bring the colors to my output. If any changes are required in my existing code please suggest too.

This is how to reproduce the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a href=""http://opentox.ntua.gr/vlab/pid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opentox.ntua.gr/vlab/pid/</a> using Opera (version 11.60, build 1185, for Linux)</li>
<li>Don't change any parameters - just click run. Wait a second and you'll get some diagrams. </li>
<li>Now check the checkbox ""Open Loop"" and click Run again. You should get different results but you don't. The images are cached and they are not reloaded.</li>
<li>Force reload of the first image: Right click on the image and click ""Reload Image"". You will notice that the reloaded image and has changed...</li>
</ol>

<p>Now go to Tools > Preferences > Advanced > History. And Set ""Memory Cache"" to ""Off"", ""Check Documents"" to ""Always"" and ""Check Images"" to ""Always"". Click also ""Empty now"" and exit. Then, the problem is resolved. Is there a way to force Opera to reload the images by specifying a proper header of the HTML document rather that having the users change their configurations globally?</p>

<p>Note that the problem does not reproduce with other browsers and the HTML document already includes in its header the following directives:</p>

<strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>The solution is to create a binding file as <em>Paulius Matulionis</em> says. You can give binding file parameter to clientgen as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;clientgen-contact
        wsdl=""${wsdl-url-contact}""
        destFile=""${output-file-contact}""
        packageName=""${packageName}""

        overwrite=""true""  
    &gt;
        &lt;binding file=""${bindingFilePath}""/&gt;
    &lt;/clientgen-contact&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Binding.xml full content:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;jaxb:bindings version=""2.1"" 
xmlns:jaxb=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb"" 
xmlns:xjc=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb/xjc""

2: Authorize access to GA Account
3: Query GA through the google api</p>

<p>After reading OW manuals(<a href=""http://www.openwatcom.org/ftp/manuals/current/cguide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">cguide.pdf</a> and <a href=""http://www.openwatcom.org/ftp/manuals/current/clr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">clr.pdf</a>), I figured out two ways that <em>compiled successfully w/o any warning or error</em>.</p>

<pre><code>    /* Code Snippet #1 */

    #pragma aux old08 aborts ;
    void (__interrupt __far *old08)(void);      // function pointer declaration


    void __interrupt __far new08(void) {

           /* Do some processing here ... */

           (*old08)();  /* OW will now generate a jump inst. instead of call*/
     }
</code></pre>

<p>The other approach that I figured out is:</p>

<pre><code>      /* Code Snippet #2 */

      static void jumpToOld08(void);         
      # pragma aux jumpToOld08 = \
             "".686p""     \       
             ""                DB      0xEA""  \          
             ""off_old08       DD      0""     \               
             ""sel_old08       DW      0""     ;             


      void __interrupt __far new08(void){

               /* Do some processing here ... */

               jumpToOld08();   
      }

      extern unsigned short sel_old08;
      extern unsigned int off_old08;

      sel_old08 = ( __segment )FP_SEG(old08);
      off_old08 = FP_OFF(old08);        
</code></pre>

<p>but with the internal messages its not working fine, i do the conversion for the body but when i receive the mail it is only the text all together like one paragraph without the basic formatting at least the new lines.</p>

<p>i think this is related for not changing the content type in the Message format -(TNEF format), but is it possible to change the content type in the TNEF format? i couldn't find any example about this! there is the TNEF readers and writers but without a helpful example!</p>

<p>there is no MIME Part in the internal messages, just TNEF part. i don't know if it is possible to to convert the TNEF to MIME and do the conversion there? or is there a way to fix how the body will looks like with the basic formatting - maybe changing the content type in TNEF format or in a layer that i don't need to work with the TNEF and MIME formats?</p>

<p>I tried to change in the MIME document direct but i am always getting a null reference on the relay function after the execution of the transport agent!</p>

<p>so if there is another approaches that i need to check it, please advise?</p>

<p>^^The above code works, so long as that filetype isn't associated with a ClickOnce program.</p>

This is a reproducible error.  Build 2 programs. Program 1 is a Clickonce program. Associate it with any filetype.  Program 2 will do a shell execute command to open whatever filetype the clickonce program is associated with.

<p>Is it possible for me to develop an Android app where I can change to a specific track being played no matter the audio player being used? I mean, all of them use the built-in ""media server"" to play audio files, right? Maybe that doesn't mean anything...</p>

<p>I wanted to develop this app where the track would automatically change to another according to some specific dynamic information but I didn't want to develop my own audio player for that, I wanted to use whatever the user's preference is on that field.</p>

<p>Do I have any other choice other than developing an audio player?</p>

I found a way to impersonate a user that is currently logged on, by retrieving the token with <code>OpenProcessToken</code>, duplicating it and calling <code>WindowsIdentity.Impersonate</code>. That way I can access the same network resources as the impersonated user.</p>

<p>However, that means my service will only work if there is a logged on user... So I was thinking that, since the LocalSystem has all privileges on the machine, perhaps it can impersonate a user that is not currently logged on ? Or log on as any (local) user without knowing its password ? Assuming it's possible, how can I do it ?</p>

<p>As you see, I've changed the code to get the <code>dbox.js</code> to work but the <code>require</code> is not defined. How to use the <code>require.js</code> properly?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>.
As I found out, the problem is in the host environment. The QML global space is constant. <code>Node.js</code> requires objects to be present in the space (e.g. iself) and importing into the global space. There is a <a href=""https://github.com/trollixx/node.qml"" rel=""nofollow"">project on github</a> glueing <code>Node.js</code> and QML but it is not finished yet. I propose another solution: make a C++ plugin to run a script in js. The script is run in the <code>Node.js</code> environment to communicate Dropbox account information to the Quick-based application.</p>

<p>In the paint event i'm using mouse down and mouse move events to draw a rectangle(rect variable) and color the pixels inside the drawn rectangle client area in yellow in real time.
The method CloudEnteringAlert.Paint do the coloring.</p>

<p>Then i have a mouse up event:</p>

<pre><code>private void pictureBox1_MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
        {
            DrawIt = false;

<p>The variable pointsAffected is IEnumerable
The variable cloudPoints is List that contain all the pixels coordinates over all the image in the pictureBox1 area.</p>

<p>pointsAffected contain only the pixels coordinates inside the drawn rectangle.</p>

<p>Now what i want to do in the mouse up event is that it will loop over all the images that's the variable trackBar1FileInfo(FileInfo[]) and will scan each image only in the area of the drawn rectange i did on the first image will scan this rectangle area in any image and to compare the pixels coordinates to the first image i drawed the rectangle on.</p>

<p>For example i have a trackBar1 i moved to value 4533 on this image i drawed a rectangle.
Now when it's getting to the mouse up event i want it to loop over from value 4533 to value 0 and to scan each image only the rectangle client area for pixels and compare this pixels coordinates with the pixels coordinates in the image 4533.</p>

<p>** So the image in value 4533 to compare the pixels coordinate in the drawn rectangle client area against all 4532 image in the same area of the rectangle.</p>

I have multiple websites that each use the <code>BasicRedisClientManager.</code> This instance is setup once on app start and set in into the <code>Application[]</code> store. That way it's reusable across all users. The problem I am having is that one site runs on a dedicated server and the other sites run on localhost where the Redis server is running. One is production and the others are test locations for new work/demonstration. The remote client works just fine but the localhost clients will not communicate with the server and seem to be in a locked/dead state. When I run the site I just get a stack overflow and the site recycles itself.  Below is some sample code of the setup I have. I see there is some information on creating locks amongst clients but I'm not sure if this is the route I need to take.</p>

            basicRedisClientManager = (BasicRedisClientManager)Application[""BasicRedisClientManager""];
        }
    }

<p>Within class using the manager.</p>

<pre><code>        if (basicRedisClientManager != null)

I setup a shared folder with my Windows system and this worked fine until I updated PHP to 5.5.12 from 5.3.x.  I used a new source for php as it didn't seem that apt-get was letting me upgrade past 5.3.x.  In the process it upgraded apache2 also.  One difference that I had overlooked initially was that vhost configuration files were no longer default or mysite.  The default is now 000-default.conf. And apache2.conf is only setup to load sites with configuration files that end in .conf.  </p>

<p>The problem is not that I am getting any forbidden errors but instead apache ignores any directives telling it to use a document root elsewhere than the /var/www location.  My shared directory with VirtualBox is /media/sf_sandbox/ - that's the Ubuntu directory.  I disabled the default site 000-default.conf and enabled two others.  Now, sandbox.dev uses files in the var/www directory and not the shared directory.  It ignores the directives in the sandbox.conf file.  </p>

<p>I read somewhere that apache by default will only serve files from the /var/www directory and that I might have to white list other directories.  It didn't say how to do that.  The apache2.conf file does have directives to load *.conf files from the sites-available directory.  Unfortunately, it just ignores the directives telling it where the document root is on my sites.  This happened after upgrading PHP from 5.3.x to 5.5.12, which also upgraded apache2.</p>

<p>How can I white-list other directories and tell apache to serve files from the location specified?</p>

<pre><code>GET /appapi/v1.0/users
POST /appapi/v1.1/users

... ... and so on
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the pattern follows <code>{api_name}/v{major_version}.{minor_version}/{rest_of_the_path}</code>.</p>

<p>I have an additional requirement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If the version is not specified, then the latest version should be used by default</strong> - i.e.,</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>GET /appapi/users</code> should be equivalent to <code>GET /appapi/v1.1/users</code> (assuming 1.1 is the latest version of users).</p>

<p>This is how I have implemented this using JAX RS. </p>

<pre><code>@Path(""/appapi"")
public class AppApiRootResource {

    @Path(""/{version: [v]\\d+[[.]\\d+]?}/"")
    public AppApiSubResource getVersionedSubResource
                            (@PathParam(""version"") String version){
        System.out.println(""Version: ""+version);
        String versionString = version.substring(1); //Discard the leading 'v'
        String majorVersion = """";
        String minorVersion = ""0"";
        if(versionString.contains(""."")){
            String [] splits = versionString.split(""."");
            majorVersion = splits[0];
            minorVersion = splits[1];
        } else {
            majorVersion = versionString;
        }

        return SubResourceFactory.getSubResource(majorVersion, minorVersion);

    }

    public AppApiSubResource getDefaultApiResource(){
        /*
         * Need help defining the regular expression here 
         * so that this is used for anything that doesn't match

         */
        System.out.println(""API version not specified; Using default version"");
        return SubResourceFactory.getLatestVersionSubResource();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My Sub-Resource class is defined as follows. I have sub-classes of this class to deal with multiple versions of the API.
The implementation of <code>SubResourceFactory</code> is not relevant for the purposes of this discussion. It just returns an instance of <code>AppApiSubResource</code> or its sub-class</p>

<pre><code>public class AppApiSubResource {


    /**
     * Create a new user
     */
    @POST
    @Path(""users"")
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)

        URI uri = uriInfo.getAbsolutePathBuilder().path(""10"")).build();       
        return Response.created(uri).build();
    }

    /**

     */
    @GET
    @Path(""users/{id}"")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
    public Response getUser(@PathParam(""id"") String userId
            ) {

        return Response.ok().entity(""&lt;user&gt;&lt;/user&gt;"").build();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Problem statement:</strong> </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If I comment out <code>getDefaultApiResource()</code>, then things work as expected when there is a version specifier in the API. However, if I un-comment <code>getDefaultApiResource()</code>,  it is always being invoked, irrespective of whether I have the v1.0 in the request or not.</li>
  <li>Also, if I un-comment <code>getDefaultApiResource()</code>, I get a 404 when I do a <code>GET /appapi/users</code> (i.e, without the version specifier); but things work fine if I use <code>GET /appapi/v1.0/users</code> (i.e., with a version specifier)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how do I set up my sub-resource locator paths/regexps such that the method is invoked when there is no version specifier in the request?</p>

<p>I'm using Restlet framework, but this question is implementation-agnostic.</p>

<pre><code>Fatal error: Uncaught CurlException: 52: GnuTLS recv error (-12): A TLS fatal alert has been received. thrown in /myURL/facebook-php-sdk-master/src/base_facebook.php on line 1031 
</code></pre>

<p>myURL is the URL of my application's original address (not the apps.facebook.com one).</p>

<p>I can't find the meaning of this error, the only thing I could guess is that it's something about encryptions, hence the TLS. </p>

<p>One possible thing (I'm guessing again) is that the application is running on an HTTPS subdomain, but our main domain is normal HTTP. The console is showing an error every time the app runs:</p>

<pre><code>Refused to connect to 'http://www.someURL.hu/' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: ""connect-src https://*.facebook.com http://*.facebook.com https://*.fbcdn.net http://*.fbcdn.net *.facebook.net *.spotilocal.com:* https://*.akamaihd.net ws://*.facebook.com:* http://*.akamaihd.net https://fb.scanandcleanlocal.com:* *.atlassolutions.com https://*.internet.org http://*.internet.org http://attachment.fbsbx.com https://attachment.fbsbx.com"".
</code></pre>

<p>But this was like this the whole time and Chrome is showing a warning on the HTTPS icon, saying something about 128-bit encryption and TLS (&lt;-- my main hint in guessing).</p>

<p>The correspongin part of the base_facebook.php is the following:</p>

<pre><code>// With dual stacked DNS responses, it's possible for a server to
// have IPv6 enabled but not have IPv6 connectivity.  If this is
// the case, curl will try IPv4 first and if that fails, then it will
// fall back to IPv6 and the error EHOSTUNREACH is returned by the
// operating system.
if ($result === false &amp;&amp; empty($opts[CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE])) {
...

//(AND THE FOLLOWING LINE HERE IS THE ONE THE ERROR IS MENTIONING:
if ($result === false) {
  $e = new FacebookApiException(array(
    'error_code' =&gt; curl_errno($ch),
    'error' =&gt; array(
    'message' =&gt; curl_error($ch),

<p>What can cause this error? What does it mean? I've never seen anything like this. And it seems it occurs totally randomly.</p>

<p>Simply delaying the JS from running in time to capture source code would also work. Is this doable?</p>

<p>For example, the <code>bgcolor</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element should not be used any longer since HTML 4.01. It was deprecated.

<p>Does this mean by the book, the attribute does not exist any longer in HTML 5?</p>

<p>Considering writing a standard conform client, to which reference in the docs should I relate to to have precise and defined dealing for the attribute? Just drop it because it is obsolete?

end.

<p>My test looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>it('traverses over a hierarchical structure over multiple chained calls', function() {

    .then(function(theAggregateResult) {
        // ...is never fulfilled

<p>Other single-call tests will register the callback passed to .then() and execute it as soon as I call .flush().</p>

<p>The code under test looks something like this.</p>

<pre><code>function traverseTheStuff(){

    // This will make a call to $http to fetch some data
    return getRootData()

    // It is fulfilled at the end of the test when I $httpBackend.flush()
    .then(function(rootData){

        // Another call to $http happens AFTER $httpBackend.flush()
        return getNextLevel(rootData.someReference);
    })

    // The second promise is never fulfilled and the test fails
    .then(function(nextLevel){
        return aggregateTheStuff(...);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>For what its worth, each of the single calls is unit tested separately. Here, I want to traverse a tree, aggregate some data and unit test a) that the promise chaining is hooked up correctly and b) the aggregation is accurate. Flattening it out into separate discrete calls is already done.</p>

<p>I'm using TextRenderer.DrawText to render the text to the screen and GetTextExtentPoint32 to measure text so I can position different font styles/sizes on the same line.</p>

<p>In Vista this all works fine.  In XP however, Arial renders differently, certain characters like 'o' and 'b' take up more width than in Vista.  GetTextExtentPoint32 seems to be measuring the string as it would in Vista though, with the smaller widths.  The end result is that every now and then a run of text will overlap the text preceding it because the preceding text gets measured as smaller than it actually is on the screen.</p>

<p>Also, my text rendering code mimics ie's text rendering exactly (for simple formatting and english language only) and ie text rendering seems to be consistent between vista and xp - that's how I noticed the change in size of the different characters.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas about what's going on?  </p>

<p>In short, TextRenderer.DrawText and GetTextExtentPoint32 don't match up in xp for Arial.  DrawText seems to draw certain characters larger and/or smaller than it does in Vista but GetTextExtentPoint32 seems to be measuring the text as it would in Vista (which seems to match the text rendering in ie on both xp and vista).  Hope that makes sense. </p>

<p>Note: unfortunately TextRenderer.MeasureString isn't fast or accurate enough to meet my requirements.  I tried using it and had to rip it out.</p>

here is my code :</p>

<p><strong><em>Server side</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use Socket;

# use port 7890 as default
    my $port = shift || 7890;

# bind to a port, then listen
    bind( SOCKET, pack_sockaddr_in($port, inet_aton($server)))
       or die ""Can't bind to port $port! \n"";

    listen(SOCKET, 5) or die ""listen: $!"";

       print &lt;NEW_SOCKET&gt;;
       print ""Connection recieved from $name\n"";
       close NEW_SOCKET;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>and this is the client side:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

    connect( SOCKET, pack_sockaddr_in($port, inet_aton($server)))

That is, I want to <strong>combine my image</strong> (what I’ve done, a picture made by matplotlib, in latitude and longitude coordinate) <strong>with topography</strong>.</p>

<p>At first I want to use the <strong>Basemap</strong> in the <strong>matplotlib toolkit</strong> to plot the topographic basemap, for I plot the satellite image using matplotlib. I found something that looked like just what I want in the basemap module:</p>

<p>Draw an <strong>etopo</strong> relief image:

(Sorry but I do not have reputation to post an image as a beginner.)</p>

<p>I guess I just need to shift the center. So I just imitated the script in the given example and made a little change to the coordinate:</p>

<pre><code>from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# setup Lambert Conformal basemap.
# set resolution=None to skip processing of boundary datasets.
m = Basemap(projection='cyl',llcrnrlon=-118.5,llcrnrlat=33.15,urcrnrlon=-117.15,urcrnrlat=34.5,\
            resolution='f')
m.shadedrelief()
plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>Then I got an ugly,  blurred picture.</p>

<p>Later I found out the reason by searching online. Default image size is 5400x2700, which makes it slow to plot and vague in small-scale maps. So it seems an incorrect way to do this.</p>

<p>Is that anyway to get a high resolution topographic basemap using matplotlib? Must I begin to learn GMT? Please help me...</p>

"32429034","1","32429203","","2015-09-06 22:49:49","","0","24","<p>I'm working on dynamically generating code in Python.</p>

<p>To aid with this, I wrote a helper method which takes in a string of Python code and dumps out the AST. Here's that method:</p>

<pre><code># I want print treated as a function, not a statement.
import __future__
pfcf = __future__.print_function.compiler_flag

from ast import dump, PyCF_ONLY_AST

def d(s):
    print(dump(compile(s, '&lt;String&gt;', 'exec', pfcf|PyCF_ONLY_AST))
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this function on a simple Hello World, it spits out the following (formatted for easier reading):</p>

<pre><code>d(""print('Hello World!')"")

Module(body=[Expr(value=Call(func=Name(id='print',
                                       ctx=Load()),
                             args=[Str(s='Hello World!')],
                             keywords=[],
                             starargs=None,
                             kwargs=None))])
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to dynamically generate this code and run it - everything was great.</p>

<p>Then I tried to dynamically generate</p>

<pre><code>print(len('Hello World!'))
</code></pre>

<p>Should be pretty easy - just another function call. Here's what my code dynamically generated:</p>

<pre><code>Module(body=[Expr(value=Call(func=Name(id='print',
                                       ctx=Load()),
                             args=[Expr(value=Call(func=Name(id='len',
                                                             ctx=Load()),
                                                   args=[Str(s='Hello World!')],
                                                   keywords=[],
                                                   starargs=None,
                                                   kwargs=None))],
                             keywords=[],
                             starargs=None,
                             kwargs=None))])
</code></pre>

<p>Running it didn't work, though. Instead, I got this message:</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: expected some sort of expr, but got &lt;_ast.Expr object at 0x101812c10&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I ran my helper method previously mentioned to see what it would output:</p>

<pre><code>d(""print(len('Hello World!')"")

Module(body=[Expr(value=Call(func=Name(id='print',
                                       ctx=Load()),
                             args=[Call(func=Name(id='len',
                                                  ctx=Load()),
                                        args=[Str(s='Hello World!')],
                                        keywords=[],
                                        starargs=None,
                                        kwargs=None)],
                             keywords=[],
                             starargs=None,
                             kwargs=None))])
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between what I'm generating (which doesn't work) and what it generates (which works), is that they passed <code>Call</code> directly to args, whereas I wrapped mine in <code>Expr</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is, in the very first line, I needed to wrap <code>Call</code> in an <code>Expr</code>. I'm confused - why is it sometimes necessary to wrap a <code>Call</code> in an <code>Expr</code> but not other times? <code>Expr</code> seems like it should be just an abstract base class which <code>Call</code> inherits from, but it's required at the top level right under the <code>Module</code>. Why? Is there something subtle I'm missing? What are the rules for when <code>Call</code> needs to be wrapped in an <code>Expr</code> and when it can be used directly?</p>

<p>Am I getting in trouble with datatypes? because the array is String type and the database had int Type, String Type, long type .....</p>

<p>thanks in advance</p>

The best solution I found is to use <em>semi_join</em> inside the function as follow:</p>

<pre><code>d1 &lt;- data.frame(model = c(1,1,2,2), x = runif(4) )
d2 &lt;- data.frame(model=c(1,1,1,2,2,2), y = runif(6) )

d1 %&gt;% group_by(model) %&gt;% do(myfun(., d2))

<p>My root VC, MainVC, is a custom container view controller with a logo on the top right (constrained with Auto Layout).<br>
Below the logo there is a fullscreen container view which embeds a Navigation Controller subclass, call it NavVC. This allows the logo to be fixed and always visible while NavVC pushes new controllers.</p>

<p>NavVC has a root VC called MenuVC.</p>

<p>MenuVC pushes DataVC using custom transition.</p>

<p>DataVC presents ModalVC (which is Apple's QLPreviewController) modally.</p>

<p>I need the whole app to be Landscape only, except from the ModalVC which needs to be Portrait only (I guess it could be both but it's displaying a portrait PDF so it doesn't make much sense to have it landscape)</p>

<p>What I have done is:</p>

<p>I enabled all rotations in the project settings.</p>

<p>I added this code to MainVC:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations
{
    return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This locks all the app in Landscape only but for some reason ModalVC is still able to rotate to all orientations, which would be ideal, but unfortunately this causes my problem:</p>

<p>If I rotate the iPad to Portrait while ModalVC is presented (which is what users will do to read the PDF) and then dismiss ModalVC while still in Portrait, the logo which is MainVC shifts 256 points to the left, breaking the constraints (although Xcode gives no errors).
Interestingly 256 is the difference between the width and the height of the iPad... coincidence?</p>

<p>Not sure if useful but when presenting ModalVC I get this warning in Xcode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions for QLRemotePreviewContentController</p>

<p>I'd like to select any child node of a given node so what I'm looking for is SQL that looks like this (for a parent with pk=2):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM ""treeItems""
WHERE ARRAY[2] &lt;@ ""treeItems"".lineage AND ""treeItems"".id != 2
ORDER BY ""treeItems"".lineage</code></pre>

<p>Here is the SqlAlchemy/Python code I use to try to get to the above SQL with little luck:</p>

<pre><code>arrayStr = 'ARRAY[%s]' % ','.join([str(i) for i in self.lineage])
lineageFilter = expr.text('%s &lt;@ %s' % (arrayStr, TreeItem.table.c.lineage))
query = SESSION.query(TreeItem).filter(expr.and_(lineageFilter, TreeItem.table.c.id!=self.id))</code></pre>

<p>But here is the SQL I wind up with (notice the lack of quotes around the treeItems table name in the where clause):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ""treeItems"".id AS ""treeItems_id"", ""treeItems"".type AS ""treeItems_type"", ""treeItems"".""parentId"" AS ""treeItems_parentId"", ""treeItems"".lineage AS ""treeItems_lineage"", ""treeItems"".depth AS ""treeItems_depth""
FROM ""treeItems""
WHERE ARRAY[2] &lt;@ treeItems.lineage AND ""treeItems"".id != %(id_1)s</code></pre>

<p>So, now for the questions:</p>

<p><strong>Is there a better way to do this than to use the text() expression / Is there an operator or expression in SqlAlchemy that can do &lt;@ with PGArray?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can I get the quotes to show up around my table name if I must use the text() expression?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>While I have used Axis2 before, I'm no expert with it and even less so with Rampart. I had an existing Web App that has been extended to introduce a client for a Web Service interaction. I installed Axis2 v1.6.1 and Rampart v1.6.1 as instructed. I built the client-side Java classes using the WSDL2Java script and bundled the generated classes into a jar. I then added the appropriate jars and Axis2 repository to the Web App. The WSDL and XSDs are contained in the wsdl.zip attachment of <a href=""http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/axis-java-user/201112.mbox/%3C4B95BC7335A13A42AD0D23462F91AE6F615D057F41%40echo.geometryit.com%3E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/axis-java-user/201112.mbox/%3C4B95BC7335A13A42AD0D23462F91AE6F615D057F41%40echo.geometryit.com%3E</a>
(Axis2 User Mailing List) The atachments are at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>The section of code that initialises the client-side of the web service is</p>

<pre><code>try
{
  ConfigurationContext context = ConfigurationContextFactory.createConfigurationContextFromFileSystem(this.getWebInfPath() + ""repository"" );

**ablisContentManagementService = new ContentManagementServiceStub( context, ""http://services.ablis.uat.business.gov.au/ContentManagement.svc"" );

  ServiceClient ablisContentManagementServiceClient = ablisContentManagementService._getServiceClient();

  ablisContentManagementServiceClient.engageModule( ""addressing"" );
  ablisContentManagementServiceClient.engageModule( ""rampart"" );

  ablisAxisFault = null;
}
catch ( AxisFault af )
{
  ablisContentManagementService = null;
  ablisAxisFault = af;
  af.printStackTrace();
}
catch ( Throwable t )
{
  t.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know that Rampart is not configured properly but the error is being thrown at the highlighted line (**). This is before where the Rampart configuration would occur, if done.</p>

<p>In debugging, I noticed that the XML, as an OMElement instance, being passed to the SymmetricBindingBuilder.build() (see stacktrace) is (cut down for brevity)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;wsp:Policy&gt;
  &lt;sp:ProtectionToken&gt;
    .
    .
    .
  &lt;/sp:ProtectionToken&gt;
  .
  .
  .
&lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>From the code in SymmetricBindingBuilder.build(), I think the XML should be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sp:SymmetricBinding xmlns:sp=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy""&gt;
  &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;
    &lt;sp:ProtectionToken&gt;
      .
      .
      .
    &lt;/sp:ProtectionToken&gt;
    .
    .
    .
  &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;
&lt;/sp:SymmetricBinding&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A change to the XML being passed would fix the error but how to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I may have made errors or omissions in what I have said or done in order to be brief. If important details are missing, please highlight these. I'm familiar with Axis2 and not at all with Rampart so any help is appreciated. I am happy to answer questions. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

}

public class HostStartup : IHostStartup

<pre><code>// Note: Interfaces are registered via unity container and dependency injection.

    private void HandleHostFault(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        HandleFaultHere.....
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, great, now I have code to handle a <code>ServiceHost.Faulted</code> event. (Of course I have not shown all the other WCF guts that really make my service work...)</p>

<p><strong>My question is</strong>, how to unit test my private HandleHostFault method without cheating and setting it to public (we all want to do that at times).<br>
In other words, is it possible to raise <code>ServiceHost.Faulted</code> event in unit testing environment?</p>

<p>I prefer to use NSubstitute for my unit testing.  I have tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>private IHostStartup _hostStartup;
private IMyService _myService;
private TestHost _testHost;

public void MyTestInitialize()
{
    _hostStartup = Substitute.For&lt;IHostStartup&gt;();
    _myService = Substitute.For&lt;IMyService&gt;();
    _hostStartup.When(x =&gt; x.StartService(Arg.Any&lt;IMyService&gt;())).Do(x =&gt;
                 {
                    _hostStartup.myHost = Substitute.For&lt;ServiceHost&gt;();
                 });
    _testHost  = new TestHost(_hostStartup, _myService);
}

public void HandleHostFault_InitializeHost_ServiceHostStatusOpen()
{
     // Arrange

     // Act
     hostStartup.myHost.Faulted += Raise.Event();


     // Assert
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>hostStartup.myHost.Faulted += Raise.Event()</code> does not raise the faulted event. </p>

<p><strong>Any ideas how to raise this servicehost.faulted event?  Is it possible?</strong> </p>

<p>** UPDATE **</p>

<p>I decided not to test ServiceHost communication object directly. I decided it was ""not testable using NSubstitute"". I now handle the ServiceHost.Faulted event from my HostStartup class.</p>

<pre><code>public class HostStartup : IHostStartup
{
    public event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; OnHostFault;

    public ServiceHost MyHost { get; private set; }

    public void StartService(IMyService instance)
    {
        MyHost = new ServiceHost(instance);
        MyHost.Faulted += HandleFault;
    }

    public void StopService()
    }
        _myHost.Close();
    {

    private void InvokeOnServiceHostFault(EventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; handler = OnHostFault;
        if (handler != null) handler(this, eventArgs);
    }

    private void HandleFault(object sender, EventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        InvokeOnServiceHostFault(eventArgs);
    }
}

// Note: Interfaces are registered via unity container and dependency injection.
// Unity bootstrapper class not shown. 
public class TestHost : ITestHost
{
    private IHostStartup _hostStartup;
    private IMyService _myService

    public TestHost(IHostStartup hostStartup, IMyService myService)
    {
        _hostStartup = hostStartup;
        _myService = myService;
        hostStartup.StartService(_myService);
        hostStartup.OnHostFault += HandleHostFault;
    }

    private void HandleHostFault(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        HandleFaultHere.....
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and finally the unit test action works great:</p>

<pre><code>public void HandleHostFault_InitializeHost_ServiceHostStatusOpen()
{
     // Arrange

     // Act
     hostStartup.OnHostFault += Raise.Event();  // works great!! :)


     // Assert
}

<p>Hello SO,</p>

<p>I'm trying to induce a BSOD somehow inline in my C code. My main background is Java but have been fortunate to have been tutored by some coworkers and am helping out with a simple C utility.</p>

<p>There's two sections:<br>
1) write to a hard drive (I finished this, wasn't too bad)<br>
2) Force a blue screen immediately after sending the last SCSI write command</p>

<p>You can probably tell the intent of the program easily now.</p>

<p>I've tried two things so far:<br>
1) Externally calling pskill.exe (windows utility) to manually crash csrss.exe which forces a blue screen every time since csrss.exe is a required service of windows. This doesn't work because it's not fast enough. The call to the external utility takes too long so we need inline code to compile with the write to disk section in order to crash the computer fast enough.  </p>

<p>2) Use the windows.h API to call TerminateProcess: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686714%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686714%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>
The problem is this function cannot end system related tasks so it can't close csrss.exe</p>

<p>This has left me short on options. I need a clever way to kill csrss.exe in our own native code without an external call or a clever way to force a blue screen in internal code OR I need a very simple driver I can load and call which will blue screen the machine immediately. Could be as short as 1 line calling KeBugCheck <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff551948.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff551948.aspx</a>  </p>

<p>Thanks for your time and input.</p>

<p>However still the same error how can the basedir not exist the build file is contained within it. The basedir within the MDP target is pointing to an absoulet path and tar all the files within that. why would this be giving an error?</p>

On initialize I create a new Country object and store it in a global variable. I have a method that loads another FXML into the content pane when a menu item is clicked:</p>

<p><b>SampleController.java</b></p>

<pre><code>public class SampleController implements Initializable {

@FXML
private Pane pContent;

private Country c;

@FXML
private void handleButtonAction(ActionEvent event) throws IOException {
    System.out.println(c); //this prints Belgium, which is correct

    URL url = getClass().getResource(""Sub1.fxml"");

    FXMLLoader fxmlloader = new FXMLLoader();
    fxmlloader.setLocation(url);
    fxmlloader.setBuilderFactory(new JavaFXBuilderFactory());

    pContent.getChildren().clear();

}

    c = new Country();
    c.setCountry(""Belgium"");
}

public Country getCountryFromSampleController(){
    return c;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I wish to capture the Country object when the Sub1.fxml gets loaded, which means I need to fetch the country object on initialize():</p>

<p><b>Sub1Controller.java</b></p>

<pre><code>public class Sub1Controller implements Initializable {

/**
 * Initializes the controller class.
 */
@Override
public void initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb) {
    SampleController sp = new SampleController(); //I don't know how to fetch the original SampleController object
    System.out.println(sp.getCountryFromSampleController()); 
    //this prints null, which is ofcourse logical because I make a new SampleController object.         
}    
}

My concern is whether my code is correct and that I am actually reading in new data and that the connection is maintained. Initially I had been reading into a buffer and just loaded everything into a file after max size, but figured it would be simpler to read a line, since each entry was being sent delimited by line feeds.</p>

<pre><code>rStream = webrequest.GetResponse().GetResponseStream
rStream = New GZipStream(rStream, CompressionMode.Decompress)
If rStream.CanRead then
   Dim bufferPit(8100) as byte
   Do
      Dim dStream as StreamReader = New StreamReader(rStream)
      While not dStream.EndOfStream
          rData = dStream.ReadLine()
          pTools.appendToFile(rData)
      End While
   .....//some other exception handling
   Loop While rStream.CanRead
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like I am continuously reading and not sure if I am reading redundant data here. Also another question is that if I were to use a thread to appendToFile, would that maintain the connection to the stream?</p>

<p>Firstly, I am wondering if there is a neater way to make this toolbox override the original toolbox, rather than putting all subdirectories and .m files directly in the working directory.
Secondly, if I do override the old toolbox in this way, will this even work, or does MATLAB have some sort of block on using updated toolboxes in older versions?</p>

<p>After creating new project using Interenet application template, I have created two classes:</p>

<p>Student.cs</p>

<pre><code>[Table(""Student"")]
public class Student
{
    [Key]
    [DatabaseGeneratedAttribute(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
    public virtual int StudentId { get; set; }
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual string Surname { get; set; }
    public virtual int UserId { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>UserProfile.cs</p>

<pre><code>[Table(""UserProfile"")]
public class UserProfile
{
    [Key]
    [DatabaseGeneratedAttribute(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public virtual int StudentId { get; set; }
    public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>also, I've deleted the UserProfile definition from AccountModel.cs. My DB context class looks like this:</p>

<p>MvcLoginDb.cs</p>

<pre><code>public class MvcLoginDb : DbContext
{
    public MvcLoginDb()
        : base(""DefaultConnection"")
    {
    }

    public DbSet&lt;UserProfile&gt; UserProfiles { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;Student&gt; Students { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>again, I have deleted db context definition from AccountModel.cs.</p>

<p>Inside Package-Manager-Console I've written:</p>

<pre><code>Enable-Migrations
</code></pre>

<p>and my Configuration.cs looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>internal sealed class Configuration : DbMigrationsConfiguration&lt;MvcLogin.Models.MvcLoginDb&gt;
{
    public Configuration()
    {
        AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = true;
    }

    protected override void Seed(MvcLogin.Models.MvcLoginDb context)
    {
        WebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnection(""DefaultConnection"", ""UserProfile"", ""UserId"", ""UserName"", autoCreateTables: true);

        if (!WebSecurity.UserExists(""banana""))
            WebSecurity.CreateUserAndAccount(
                ""banana"",
                ""password"",
                new
                {
                   Student = new Student { Name = ""Asdf"", Surname = ""Ggjk"" }
                });

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That was the <strong>idea</strong> of adding student data as creating a new class, but this approach is not working because after running <em>Update-Database -Verbose</em> I'm getting the error:
<strong>No mapping exists from object type MvcLogin.Models.Student to a known managed provider native type.</strong></p>

<p>Can anyone expain why I'm getting this error, shoud I use a different approach for storing additional data in different table?</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; ""sessions/manager"" %&gt;</code> part points to a partial which displayes another partial depending on the users login state.</p>

<p>Here's my login form.</p>

    result.text = ""First Text""
    result.backgroundColor = UIColor.blueColor()

    return result
}()
</code></pre>

<p>For this example, I explicitly created a <code>UILabel</code>, but in my actual project I don't know what type of object is created, so I'm just treating the result as <code>AnyObject</code> for this example. The object is just a standard UILabel with text of ""First Text"" on a blue background, default aligned to the left.</p>

<p>In this example case, I know that this object is actually a <code>UILabel</code>, so I know I can change it's properties like this:</p>

<pre><code>(object as UILabel).text = ""Second Text""
</code></pre>

<p>And now I've changed the text. But in my actual project, I don't know that my object is a <code>UILabel</code>, so I can't just do the <code>(object as UILabel)</code> trick, because it's not always a <code>UILabel</code>. My way around that is using <code>setValueForKey</code>. After checking that my object has a member called ""text"" using <code>respondsToSelector</code> (not shown in this example), I can change the text this way:</p>

<pre><code>object.setValue(""Third Text"", forKey: ""text"")
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I wanted to change the <code>textAlignment</code> of the object, after checking that the object does indeed have a member called <code>textAlignment</code>, I'd want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>object.setValue(NSTextAlignment.Center, forKey: ""textAlignment"")
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this results in an error though:</p>

<pre><code>Type 'NSTextAlignment' does not conform to protocol 'AnyObject'
</code></pre>

<p>I ran into something similar while trying this approach with setting the <code>frame</code>, because it didn't like the <code>CGRect</code> type, but I was able to get around it by converting the <code>CGRect</code> to an <code>NSValue</code>. However, I can't find a way to fix it for <code>enum</code> types like <code>NSTextAlignment</code>.</p>

<p>I'm new to AngularJS directive scope and I want to know how AngularJS deals with scope when multiple isolated-scope directives are assigned to teh same element.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>app.controller(""main"", function($scope){
    $scope.data = [
        {
            id:""id_1""
        },
        {
            id:""id_2""
        },
        {
            id:""id_3""
        },
        {
            id:""id_4""
        }
    ];
});

app.directive(""isodir"", function(){
    return {
        restrict:""AE"",
        scope: {},
        controller: function($scope){$scope.d = {id:""isodir_id""} },
        link: function(scope, EL, attrs){}
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML part is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;isodir ng-repeat=""d in data track by $index""&gt;{{d.id}}&lt;/isodir&gt;

&lt;isodir&gt;{{d.id}}&lt;/isodir&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are mainly two questions that confused me so much:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[1] For the html part[1]: the one with ng-repeat, could anyone give me
  some explanation on <strong>how</strong> AngularJS decides whose scope to use, because
  ng-repeat and isodir are both isolated scope(according to the result,
  but it turns out that ng-repeat scope get applied and I want to know why
  not isodir is applied); sometimes if I use two directives both with isolated
  scopes, AngularJS will report error. <strong>But</strong> the ng-repeat does not report
  error.</p>
  
  <p>[2] For the html part[2]: the one without ng-repeat, let us say that I
  just accept the fact about part[1] without any doubt, then it means that
  the d inside ng-repeat scope <strong>gets rendered</strong> to {{d.id}}, but in part[2],
  I define $scope.d inside isodir controller, but <strong>why</strong> this d can <strong>not</strong> be
  useed as value of {{d.id}}</p>

I'm attending a course on software architecture and I have to explain Yesod architecture.
Here's what I understand:
Yesod implement the MVC pattern using Shakespeare as ""View"", Persistent as a ""Model"" and Yesod itself as a Controller. But I don't get where to collocate the Warp server. Can you tell me?</p>

<p>Furthermore, what is the Yesod architecture itself? I read ""The Architecture of Open Source Applications"" book but I don't really get if it uses a layered architecture or a component based architecture, I'm quite confident that it uses a component based architecture (correct me if I'm wrong) but I can't spot which are the component (can you tell me?). </p>

<p>Recap of doubts:
- Role of Web server in the MVC pattern
- Yesod architecture itself.
- Component/Layer of the yesod architecture.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your time.</p>

<p>Here is the piece of the book description about Yesod:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most basic feature of Yesod is routing. It features a declarative syntax and type-safe dispatch. Layered on top of this, Yesod provides many other features: streaming content generation, widgets, i18n, static files, forms and authentication. But the core feature added by Yesod is really routing.</p>
  
  <p>This layered approach makes it simpler for users to swap different components of the system. Some people are not interested in using Persistent. For them, nothing in the core system even mentions Persistent. Likewise, while they are commonly used features, not everyone needs authentication or static file serving.</p>
  
  <p>On the other hand, many users will want to integrate all of these features. And doing so, while enabling all the optimizations available in Yesod, is not always straightforward. To simplify the process, Yesod also provides a scaffolding tool that sets up a basic site with the most commonly used features.</p>

<p>Every time I use the file dialog, after selecting a folder and clicking ok, my program will hang for a few seconds, and then exit without any error messages.</p>

<p>I've attempted to use the webkit flag webkitdirectory, as well, with the same result.</p>

<p>I append the locator to my settings window using jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>settings.append($('&lt;input style=""display:none;"" id=""fileDialog"" nwdirectory type=""file""/&gt;'));
settings.append($('&lt;span class=""saveLoc""&gt;'+ options['savelocation'] +'&lt;/span&gt;'));

<pre><code>function chooseFile(name) {
  var chooser = $(name);
  chooser.change(function(evt) {

  });
  chooser.trigger('click');
}
settings.find('.saveLoc').click(function(){
  chooseFile('#fileDialog');
});

<p>The code works if I remove the nwdirectory flag, but then the user can only select files, not folders.</p>

<p>Am I making a mistake? And if not, is there any way for me to extract information about the cause of the crash?</p>

<p>On one page there is a table of names that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table class=""table"" id=""table""&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th id=""name""&gt;Teacher&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are more entries, but that is a good example. When you click on the name in the table, ""Katherine Crowley"" in this example, a modal opens up, where I would like to have information on the person. Here is the code for the modal:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""modal"" id=""myModal""&gt;
&lt;div class=""modal-dialog""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""modal-content""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""modal-header""&gt;
      &lt;button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""modal"" aria-hidden=""true""&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;h4 class=""modal-title"" href=""#name""&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""container""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""modal-body""&gt;
      Content
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;more content&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""modal-footer""&gt;
      &lt;a href=""#"" data-dismiss=""modal"" class=""btn""&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href=""#"" class=""btn btn-primary""&gt;Save changes&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>The idea is that the title of the modal will be set to the name of the person, and then in the content area, the courses will be listed. </p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can do this??</p>

<p>I am fairly new to all of this, so as much detail as possible would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>    private void startThread()

        Thread t = new Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart(setOutputBinaryWorker));
        t.Start();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine due to the setOutputBinaryWorker being an actual, existing method. However, I'm looking for a way to pass the function name as a variable to the startThread function.</p>

<p>Thanks to my limited C# experience, I suspect it to be possible but cannot seem to figure out how. I can image it should be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// using System.Threading;

    private void startThread(??datatype?? func)
    {            
        Thread t = new Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart(func));
        t.Start();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But I cannot figure out what the datatype should be ( heads the use of questionmarks ).
Now, while debugging, the passed function name pops up as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.Object Void, setOutputBinaryWorker</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which just doesn't give me much to go on. Can these be created? Tried casting the parameter as (object) which doesn't work.</p>

<p>The main idea behind this, is experimenting with a safe gui-thread to write to ui elements in the correct way. 
Now, I've got that part down, using delegated methods it all works just dandy. But when switching to the current approach ( making the method name variable ) I'm just completely lost.
If someone knows an alternative, better, or at least working solution, I'm open to suggestions, big time.</p>

<p>For this reason, I have <code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;</code> in only <strong>one</strong> of the <strong>.cpp</strong> files. No other file includes this <strong>.cpp</strong> files. Therefore, logically, the <code>windows.h</code> header should be invisible to the rest of the solution.</p>

<p>This means that I don't have any name conflicts with declarations in the Windows library in all files but that one <strong>.cpp</strong>, and my project compiles just fine.</p>

<p>However, IntelliSense keeps on insisting that I have name conflicts. When I press <code>Ctrl+Space</code>, IntelliSense suggests identifiers from <code>windows.h</code>. And this is in the scope where <code>windows.h</code> should be invisible!</p>

<p>Is there a setting I can change to stop this annoying behaviour?</p>

<p>I'm 100% positive that the issue is not with the structure of my solution because if I use an identifier already defined in <code>windows.h</code> in another part of my project, the compiler does not recognize it and it doesn't compile...but IntelliSense recognizes it!</p>

<p>Since my data is from Twitter (limited by 140 characters) there are many words shortened, or on this case, <strong>omitted space</strong>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>""Hi, my name is Bob. I m 19yo and 170cm tall""
</code></pre>

<p>Should be tokenized to:</p>

<pre><code>- hi
- my
- name
- bob
- i
- 19
- yo
- 170
- cm
- tall
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>19</code> and <code>yo</code> in <code>19yo</code> have <strong>no space</strong> between them. I use it mostly for extracting numbers with their units. </p>

<p>Simply, what I need is a way to 'explode' each tokens that has number in it by chunk of numbers or letters <strong>without</strong> delimiter. </p>

<p><code>'123abc'</code> will be <code>['123', 'abc']</code></p>

<p><code>'abc123'</code> will be <code>['abc', '123']</code></p>

<p><code>'abc123xyz'</code> will be <code>['abc', '123', 'xyz']</code></p>

<p>and so on.</p>

I followed these steps by adding the codeto a controller but the nothing is shown in the view.</p>

Lets say we have an application <strong>AppA</strong> that uses <strong>libB</strong> and <strong>libC</strong>. <strong>libC</strong> uses <strong>libD</strong>.

We're making a y86 simulator in C and this part of the assignment is supposed to open a file, load it into memory, perform a dump, and exit. The main method is provided to do these things, we're just supposed to create the loader.c and loader.h files to actually do the loading. The load function returns true(1) if the load was successful (input file was free of errors) and false(0) otherwise.

This is the first time I'm working in C, so it's still a rather confusing for me. If needed I can provide more code. So far I've included loader.c, loader.h, memory.c, and memory.h. Bool.h is included, but it's just a typedef for true-false so I figured I could leave it out. I apologize if this is a bit much, but I'm completely stumped and I don't know where else to go.

<p>Note: my experience is largely SQL Server, so I know a bit, just not MySQL specifically.</p>

<p>The task is to delete some rows from 9 tables, but I might have upwards of 5,000 key pairs.</p>

<p>I started out with the easy way of looping through all my keys and submitting a statement for each one against each table, such as:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM Table WHERE Key1 = 123 AND Key2 = 567 -- and 8 more tables
DELETE FROM Table WHERE Key1 = 124 AND Key2 = 568 -- and 8 more tables
DELETE FROM Table WHERE Key1 = 125 AND Key2 = 569 -- and 8 more tables
...
</code></pre>

<p>Except, that comes out to 45,000 separate statements, which as you can imagine is a bit slow.</p>

<p>So, without worrying about the programming language I'm using on the front end, what's a good way to submit the list so that I can JOIN and do the operation all at once or at least in large batches? Here are my ideas so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a <strong>temp table</strong> and insert to it, then join. I'll happily look up the syntax for MySQL to create a temp table, but is that a good route to go?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming I do use a temp table, what's the best <strong>method for populating a temp table</strong>? 5000 <code>INSERT Table VALUES ()</code> statements? <code>SELECT 123, 456 UNION ALL SELECT 124, 457</code>? I just tested that MySql allows this kind of SELECT that is not issued against a table. But SQL Server eventually blows up if the list gets too long, so is this a good way in MySQL? Should I just keep the list to a few hundred at once?</p>

<pre><code>--CREATE Temp Table ( I do not know the syntax in MySql yet)


INSERT INTO TempTable
SELECT 123, 456
UNION ALL SELECT 124, 457
UNION ALL SELECT 125, 458


DELETE T
FROM
   Table T
   INNER JOIN TempTable X ON T.Key1 = X.Key1 AND T.Key2 = X.Key2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>XML</strong>. I see MySQL 5.1 has some XML functions, but from a cursory search it doesn't appear to support turning a chunk of XML text into a rowset to join against. Is that true? It is extremely easy for me to get the values into XML.</p></li>
<li><p>A virtual <strong>split operation</strong>. I presume in MySql that there's some kind of procedural language possible. In SQL Server I could write some custom code that parses a string and turns it into a rowset:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE DoStuff @KeyString varchar(max)
AS
DECLARE @Keys TABLE (
   Key1 int,
   Key2 int,
   PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (Key1, Key2)
)
DECLARE @Pos int
WHILE @Pos &lt; Len(@KeyString) BEGIN
   -- loop to search for delimiting commas in @KeyString
   -- and insert pairs of parsed tokens to table variable @Keys
END


DELETE T
FROM
   Table T
   INNER JOIN @Keys K ON T.Key1 = K.Key1 AND T.Key2 = K.Key2
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Since I'm unfamiliar with MySQL, I really don't know which possibility to investigate first, and I would appreciate some help to save me from making a poor decision and/or learning the hard way.</p>

<p>Store => Store.createCriteria()<br/>
Client => Client.createCriteria()<br/>
and so on.</p>

<p>To avoid code duplication, I have tried to make a generic version of the list method, by creating a generic class :</p>

<pre><code>class QueryUtils&lt;T&gt; {

    def list(params) {
        T.createCriteria()
        [...]
    }

}

<p>This way, each of my services (StoreService, ClientService, etc) can extend QueryUtils :</p>

<pre><code>class StoreService extends QueryUtils&lt;Store&gt;
class ClientService extends QueryUtils&lt;ClientService&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and so on, and inherit the list() method corresponding to its domain class type.</p>

<p>The problem is that during the execution, it doesn't work since the effective type of T is java.lang.Object, instead of the domain class type I have specified : <br/><br/>
groovy.lang.MissingMethodException: No signature of method: static java.lang.Object.createCriteria() is applicable for argument types: () values: []</p>

<p>Do you know how to solve this problem?</p>

<p>So i come to the other idea - let's make (almost) all data non-shared. For example, the physics thread can update all the things as it wishes, without data races, and just post update requests to all other threads.</p>

<p>Implementation, in my opinion, should be global linked list of events, when some thread wants to post something - it appends it at tail. When thread is processing event it is moving it's personal pointer to current node forward. The garbage is collected with something like ref-counting.</p>

<p>So, the questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What do you think about such a system? What are best practices for such tasks? Recommended literature?</li>
<li>I am not experienced in concurrent programming, so it will be very good, if you show some example code for this. (I am uncertain about handling the synchronization well).</li>

<p>I already looked through the web and through SO, and I found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3611542/sql-columns-for-different-categories"">THIS QUESTION</a> that shows me exactly what I need to do, but I think with some modifications... </p>

<p>I tryed to run this query on the database:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT o.order_id, o.prod_code, o.prod_color, o.size, o.quantity,
MAX(CASE WHEN p.currency = 'EUR' THEN p.price END) AS 'EUR',
MAX(CASE WHEN p.currency = 'USD' THEN p.price END) AS 'USD',
MAX(CASE WHEN p.currency = 'YEN' THEN p.price END) AS 'YEN',
MAX(CASE WHEN p.currency = 'RUB' THEN p.price END) AS 'RUB'
FROM products_order o JOIN products_prices p ON o.prod_code = p.prod_code
WHERE o.order_id = 1
GROUP BY o.order_id, o.prod_code, o.prod_color, o.size, o.quantity
</code></pre>

<p>will return in the prices columns, for every row, the MAX value found in the entire column: so both for [product_color = 001] and for [product_color = 995] I have price equals to 20 EURO (when for 001 it's cheaper, only 10 euro!)</p>

<p>I tryed also without MAX, but it gives me one row for each price, leaving lot of cells empty (then I understood what MAX is used for :D).</p>

<p>Do you know a way to do what I'm trying to do? How can I use MAX inside a single prod_color instead through every prod_color?</p>

<p>I hope you can understand what I wrote, thanks in advance, any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>(if you need something explained more clearly, just ask and asap I'll reply.</p>

<p>Thanks again, best regards</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The user select a numbered paragraph and triggers the macro. Macro runs once per trigger and inserts a hidden bookmark with the name like <code>_001_042</code> if the selection begins with ""any_character"".42. The first ""001"" is meant to depict a chapter number (i.e. ""Chapter 1""), but could be any number and is determined by a user input through a message box. This macro works, though with each next numbered paragraph runs slower and slower. When I get to paragraph 1.100 it takes ~5 minutes (!!!) for macro to insert a single bookmark ""_001_100"".</p>

<p>Why does such a long latency happen? Is it possible to optimize the macro to run faster?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

I have done a lot of searches but all of them ended in onTouchEvent() which I used it but it does not work properly or maybe I have done something wrong. 
Actually the view moves but it won't be placed exactly where the user touch, it will go below the touched area in y axis with a distance.</p>

<p>also I heard that ""static calling of non static methods"" are ""deprecated""....what does that exactly mean especially in relation to this scenario? is calling <code>A::B()</code> when B() is not declared static something that I shouldn't be doing? if so, why is that the case?</p>

"30860722","1","","","2015-06-16 06:55:17","","3","106","<p>Moving from <code>Polymer</code> <strong>v0.5</strong> to <strong>v1.0</strong> the registration process of <code>Polymer elements</code> seems to be different. Before <code>Polymer v1.0</code> we could execute JavaScript code from <code>index.html</code> to initialize all needed objects in our <code>Polymer elements</code>. This is a very important detail because the <code>data-binding</code> in <code>Polymer</code> <strong>ONLY</strong> works correct when the bounded objects are initialized <strong>FIRST</strong>. This means the following: </p>

<p>For example if you want to bind an object in your <code>Polymer element</code> with <code>{{ }}</code> or <code>[[ ]]</code>, the object <strong>must</strong> be defined before the <code>Polymer element</code> registration! See:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dom-module id=""my-elem""&gt;
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;This should be my bounded object: &lt;b&gt;{{obj.name}}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    Polymer({
    is: 'my-elem',
    ready: function () {
      // Global initialized object!!!
      // app.obj ==&gt; app.obj = { name: 'Great', info: 'Additional info!!!' };
      this.obj = app.obj;
    }
    ...      
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/dom-module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that if the <code>Polymer element</code> is registered <strong>BEFORE</strong> <code>app.obj</code> is initialized (in the example above <code>this.obj</code> is <code>undefined</code> at the time of <code>Polymer element</code> registration) then <strong>NO</strong> notification will be executed and no update provided even when <code>app.obj</code> is <strong>NOT</strong> <code>undefined</code> later on.</p>

<p>So in cases like that we need to initialize all bounded object first before we can use them with <code>{{ }}</code> or <code>[[ ]]</code>.</p>

<p>Is our approach totally wrong??? Any suggestions???</p>

<p>But the aproaches didn't work for me.</p>

<p>I went through the docs on djangoproject over and over, but I can't find a solution. So please bear with me, I'm sure there is a solution.</p>

<p>I am trying to do this as simple as possible, even left out virtualenv for the sake of Apple's Server.app 
For sure I am missing something here...</p>

<p>This is my setup:
Mac OS X 10.9 with Server App 3
Python 2.7.9 (installed via brew)
django 1.6.10
Apache 2.2.26
mod_wsgi 4.4.8 (express version via pip)</p>

<p>The Project code itself resides in /Users/_dev/MyProject/MyProject</p>

<p>The conf files:
I renamed wsgi.py to MyProject.wsgi, that just listed the MyProject in the Server.app/Advanced settings, but nothing more. Worth to mention: Apples defaut ""hello world python app"" doesn't work either, well I never saw it, but thought its different from the deafult splash screen Apple provided.</p>

<p>httpd_wsgi2.conf in /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/</p>

<p>At least Django and Mezzanine run fine with Development Server 
python manage.py runserver</p>

<p>mod_wsgi seems to be activated in
/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf : LoadModule wsgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_wsgi.so
And mod_wsgi-express start-server works fine, at least for the Malt whyskey splash.</p>

<p>But when I enter mod_wsgi-express start-server MyProject.wsgi
all I get an Internal Server Error
the log at /tmp/mod_wsgi-localhost:8000:507/error_log says:</p>

<pre><code>ImportError: Could not import settings 'MyProject.settings' (Is it on sys.path? Is there an import error in the settings file?): No module named MyProject.settings

The question I have is why not and is it important to use one over the other? Basically the Erlang documentation does not address a detailed explanation of the subject regarding the packet options and Programming Erlang by Joe Armstrong doesn't give any great detail either; he just explains that the packets aren't reassembled in order although I always thought tcp packets are received as they are sent, unlike UDP. One interesting note I have is that the client-server on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15512689/erlang-converting-tcp-sent-string-into-its-proper-form-e-g-somestring-to"">this page</a> has <code>{packet,4}</code> as the option and it works fine and its very similar to this code below.

My MIDL code looks like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-idl prettyprint-override""><code>interface IParser : IUnknown
{
    HRESULT Load([in] IStream* stream, [out, retval] IParsable** pVal);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>IStream</code> and it's base interface <code>ISequentialStream</code> are not defined inside a type library, they get defined in mine. So far so good. However, when I view my type library with OLEView, <code>ISequentialStream</code> only defines the members <code>RemoteRead</code> and <code>RemoteWrite</code>, while I expected <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code>, since they are what I am actually calling. Even more strange is, that the the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380010%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a> lists those two members (additionally to the original ones), but states they are not supported.</p>

<p><strong>The question</strong></p>

<p>So what are those members and how do I use them from a client (e.g. a managed application to create a managed <code>Stream</code> wrapper for <code>IStream</code>)?</p>

<p><strong>The long story</strong></p>

<p>I want to implement a wrapper on the client side, that forwards <code>IStream</code> calls to .NET streams, like <code>System.IO.FileStream</code>. This wrapper could inherit from <code>IStream</code> like so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class Stream : Lib.IStream
{
    public System.IO.Stream BaseStream { get; private set; }

    public Stream(System.IO.Stream stream)
    {
        this.BaseStream = stream;
    }

    // All IStream members in here...
    public void Read(byte[] buffer, int bufferSize, IntPtr bytesReadPtr)
    {
         // further implementation...
         this.BaseStream.Read();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then, I want to call my server with this wrapper:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var wrapper = new Stream(baseStream);
var parsable = parser.Load(wrapper);
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, that <code>Lib.Stream</code> in the previous example only provides <code>RemoteRead</code> and <code>RemoteWrite</code>, so that server calls to <code>stream-&gt;Read()</code> would end up in no mans land. As far as I understood, there is <code>System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream</code> for managed COM servers, but in my example I have a unmanaged COM server and a managed client that should provide <code>IStream</code> instances.</p>

<p>Edit: The marker icon's pin location is the default one, so the center of the bottom side of it

<p>I have upgraded to Delphi 2009 because of unicode support. I have found the anonymous methods a very interesting and useful language feature, I can't say the same about generics. The generics seemed important for me before the upgrade to Delphi 2009, but I have never used them and probably will never use. As for Delphi 2010, I don't need the attributes and I don't like the whole idea of extended RTTI - that is why Delphi 2009 is better for me. Sometimes I hit one or other annoying bug in Delphi 2009 IDE, but they are not critical and I can live with them. I have no plans to develop software for Mac or Linux. Sure sometime I will need 64-bit support, so I think about upgrading to Delphi 2012 (XE2).</p>

<p>Are where any more reasons that can force me to upgrade from Delphi 2009?</p>

Problem is : when someone isn't logged in to facebook or hasn't allowed my application yet, they are prompted to click the ""connect with facebook"" button. But as soon as they click it, the iframe gets destroyed and the top page is replaced with the Facebook login page. Eventually the top page is redireccted to the previous iframe URL, but the former parent page is lost forever.
Is this the intended behaviour of FB connect ?
Is there a way to avoid it or to hack around it ? (maybe using a popup instead of an iframe, but that sounds ugly (uglier than an iframe)).</p>

<p>I have the latest cocos2d version installed.</p>

<p>I made a new mac template and without changing anything I just build it. But I get 26 errors and 7 warnings.</p>

<p>The most important one (I think) is this one:</p>

<blockquote>ld: warning: ignoring file /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/Library/Frameworks//OpenAL.framework/OpenAL, file was built for unsupported file format which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64)

</blockquote>

<p>I get lots of CDSoundEngine and audio stuff errors.</p>

<p>In the warning I copied above...before the ""OpenAL.framework"" is a double backslash..strange.</p>

<p>I tried to re-add the OpenAL framework but I get the same error.</p>

<p>I also tried to make a new one but I get the same errors..
I also reinstalled cocos2d..didn't work either.</p>

<p>This only happens with the mac templates...</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

EVP_CipherUpdate() / EVP_CipherFinal() // cbc_blowfish

<p>These algorithm take a <code>unsigned char *</code> into the ""plain text"".

UTF-8 strings are meant to be endian neutrial. However I'm a bit paranoid about how OpenSSL may perform operations on the data.</p>

<p>My understanding is that encryption algorithms work on 8-bit blocks of data, and if a <code>unsigned char *</code> is used for pointer arithmetic when the operations are performed the algorithms should be endian neutral and I do not need to worry about anything. My uncertainty is compounded by the fact that I am working on a little-endian machine and have never done any real cross-architecture programming. </p>

<p>My beliefs/reasoning are/is based on the following two properties</p>

<ol>
<li>std::string (not wstring) internally uses a 8-bit ptr and a the resulting <code>c_str()</code> ptr will itterate the same way regardless of the CPU architecture.</li>
<li>Encryption algorithms are either by design, or by implementation, endian neutral. </li>
</ol>

<p>I know the best way to get a definitive answer is to use <a href=""http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">QEMU</a> and do some cross-platform unit tests (which I plan to do). <strong>My question is a request for comments on my reasoning, and perhaps will assist other programmers when faced with similar problems.</strong></p>

"32844417","1","","","2015-09-29 12:45:52","","1","46","<p>As part of a personal project to calculate the Jordan normal form of square matrices, it turns out I need to parse polynomials with complex coefficients in order to ease a lot of the code.</p>

<p>(relevant code at the bottom of the post)</p>

<p>The polynomials I wish to parse are of the following form:</p>

<ol>
<li>A coefficient may be real, imaginary or complex.</li>
<li>If the coefficient is complex, it would be wrapped with parentheses. If these parentheses are the leading coefficient, they won't be preceded by a <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>.</li>
<li>If the coefficient is real, imaginary, or complex whose real and\or imaginary components are of magnitude 1, the <code>1</code> won't appear but only the sign.</li>
<li>Parentheses are to be preceded by <code>+</code> only.</li>
<li>The variable <code>x</code> may have a power (<code>&gt;2</code>), may have a power of 1 and then it appears just as <code>x</code>, or may not appear at all.</li>
<li>There are no more rules concerning the text representation of the polynomial, i.e. powers aren't necessarily ordered in ascending\descending order.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some examples of properly formatted polynomials:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>1</code></li>
<li><code>-1</code> </li>
<li><code>-2.1x</code></li>
<li><code>3i</code></li>
<li><code>x^2-1</code>   </li>
<li><code>-x^3+2x+1</code>    </li>
<li><code>(5-5i)x^2-x-1</code>   </li>
<li><code>(-1+i)x-5</code></li>
<li><code>-ix^3-x^2+1</code></li>
</ul>

<p>..and some ill-formatted ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>1x</code> (leading unnecessary <code>1</code>)</li>
<li><code>+(+1-2i)x</code> (parentheses have a leading <code>+</code>, real component has leading <code>+</code>)</li>
<li><code>(5.1i)x^2</code> (no need for parenthesis since coefficient is imaginary)</li>
<li><code>-(i-1)</code> (complex coefficient has leading <code>-</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>After some reading online (SO, Java tutorials, Java API), I quickly came to the conclusion that a regex would be the easiest approach for parsing, considering all the restraints mentioned above.
On the formal side, a regex for this task is possible, since I drew an NFA the accepts only such valid expressions.</p>

<p>I'm doing this TDD (via JUnit 4), and this test fails:</p>

<p><code>assertEquals(""Polynomial parsed incorrectly."", poly07, PolyParser.parse(exp07));</code></p>

<p>where <code>poly07</code> looks like this: <code>(5-5i)x^2-x-1</code>.</p>

<p>This is the exception that's being raised:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: ""5-5""
at sun.misc.FloatingDecimal.readJavaFormatString(FloatingDecimal.java:2043)
at sun.misc.FloatingDecimal.parseDouble(FloatingDecimal.java:110)
at java.lang.Double.parseDouble(Double.java:538)
at PolyParser.parse(PolyParser.java:55)
at PolyParserTest.testParse(PolyParserTest.java:59)
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried debugging, and saw that the regex captures <code>5-5i</code> (and later strips the <code>i</code>). It then tries to invoke <code>Double.parseDouble</code> with the argument string <code>5-5</code>, which causes the exception.</p>

<p>After all the reading, I can't quite figure out what's the required adjustment in the regex in order for this whole show to work.
Also, the regex isn't ordered like the representations constraints mentioned above, because I want to see if the coefficient is complex before trying to parse it as real; also encountered problems that real numbers (i.e. with decimal point) are parsed as integers, so that's why the regex treats real numbers first.</p>

<p>The regex:</p>

<pre><code>public static final String POLYNOMIAL_REGEX =
        ""([+-])?"" +                     // leading plus or minus
        ""(\\()?"" +                      // parenthesis to denote the beginning of a complex number
        ""([+-])?(((\\d+.\\d+)|\\d+)i)?"" +      // component of coefficient, imaginary
        ""(((-)?\\d+.\\d+)|\\d+)?"" +     // component of coefficient, real
        ""(\\))?"" +                      // parenthesis to denote the end of a complex number
        ""(x)?"" +                        // variable
        ""(?:\\^(\\d+))?"";               // power of the variable
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not going to post all of the relevant code here because it would clutter stuff up. All of the code is on <a href=""https://github.com/asafch/Jordan-Form"" rel=""nofollow"">GitHub</a>, just be sure to switch to the branch <code>PolyParser</code>.</p>

        clientProductsContainer.Enqueue(MapProduct(product));
   });
</code></pre>

<p>All these products are different, with different codes and different prices (thats why I have the statement <code>product.PrepareToBulkSave()</code>, because I need to insert the prices at the same time as the products. After mapping the objets to my domain classes, I want to call a method to save them in my SQL Server database. The problem is that not all products are being inserted, but the number o products inserted are equal to 30. I have a virtual machine with 4 cores, and the result of inserted products is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product10 - Inserted 4 times</li>
<li>Product11 - Inserted 4 times</li>
<li>Product12 - Inserted 4 times</li>
<li>Product13 - Inserted 3 times</li>
<li>Product21 - Inserted 4 times</li>
<li>Product22 - Inserted 4 times</li>
<li>Product23 - Inserted 3 times</li>
<li>Product24 - Inserted 4 times</li>
</ul>

<p>With this result, I am missing products 1 to 9, 14 to 20 and 25 to 30. This only happens when I'm using parallel and the machine is at 100% and the memory is at 95% capacity.
Can someone help me understand this problem?</p>

I understand this is normal behaviour for storyboards since a new VC is instantiated and viewDidLoad is called each time. I tried to get around this by storing the VC in an array in the AppDelegate and then going back to the original viewController, this prevented viewDidLoad being called when the original VC is initially re-presented but I still found it get's called randomly when moving between veiwcontroller's, resetting all my properties etc.. On researching, the Apple documentation does say not to assume viewDidLoad will only be called once. </p>

<p>Is this behaviour apparent in UITabBarController when switching tabs as I'm thinking of ditching the SWRevealViewController and using that instead if it's going to be less headache. </p>

<p>Should I be handling this differently, ie. storing the 'state' in NSUserDefaults and restoring on viewDidLoad?</p>

<p>I have found some similar questions, such as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27004792/php-result-of-the-subtraction-of-two-floating-point-numbers"">PHP. result of the subtraction of two floating point numbers</a>, but they didn't really give me what I need.</p>

<p>I realize that because of rounding and floating-point precision, that things like what am I describing will happen.</p>

<p>My question is, how do I solve the problem and get the expected result?</p>

<p>Here is the code in question:</p>

<pre><code>    $a = 5.6;
    $b = .1;
    $c = round($a / $b);
    $d = $c * $b;
    $result = $a - $d;
    print ""a = $a&lt;br&gt;"";
    print ""b = $b&lt;br&gt;"";
    print ""c = $c&lt;br&gt;"";
    print ""d = $d&lt;br&gt;"";
    print ""result (a minus d) = $result&lt;br&gt;"";
    print ""the result I expected is 0"";
    die();
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the output of the program:</p>

<pre><code>a = 5.6 
b = 0.1 
c = 56 
d = 5.6 
result (a minus d) = -8.8817841970013E-16 
the result I expected is 0
</code></pre>

<p>So, 5.6 minus 5.6 equals -8.8817841970013E-16</p>

<p>I realize that this is probably because internally <code>$d</code> is not <em>exactly</em> 5.6.  I just want to know how to get the result I expect.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal I am trying to reach is to create a function that will find the modulo between two floating-point numbers.  My function is shown below, but it doesn't work because of the floating-point math error I described above.</p>

<pre><code>function RoundMod($x, $y) {
    $i = round($x / $y);
    return $x - $i * $y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want <code>RoundMod(5.6, .1)</code> to return <code>0</code></p>

<p>EDIT:
Using the answer in this question, which suggests rounding the result: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3726721/php-math-precision"">PHP Math Precision</a>, the function seems to work now.  Here is the updated method:</p>

<pre><code>function RoundMod($x, $y) {
    $i = round($x / $y);
    return round($x - $i * $y, 12);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>RoundMod(5.6, .1)</code> now returns -0, which is close enough (though I don't know what the negative sign means)</p>

I don't know anything about binary data types (as I've never knowingly used them) and I'm trying to write a binary value that I see in the registry, to the registry. Now, all I see is the following [shown below]... and if I try to pass that as a string to the <code>RegSetValueEx</code> in the WinAPI and of course it errors out... I do not know what 'numbers' I need to pass into the <code>lpData As Any,</code> argument of <code>RegSetValueEx</code> (i tried a bit array) in order for it to come out as the following [shown below] in the regedit. I really have no idea, and my tests to place random numbers in the bit array just produce corresponding random ""figures"" as visible in regedit that I do not understand how to 'tie' them together logically.</p>

<p>here is the culprit!</p>

<p>If I had the following in a string or a bit array, what must I populate the bitarray with so that the registry outputs this [above] when written? or, how can I figure out how to do it? I was hoping there'd be a function that reads my string of binary data and transforms it into the real binary format to submit to the RegSetValueEx function in VB6 or other function in VB.Net or C# (this really is a language agnostic question, and the problem exists in all languages; ie: same process).</p>

<p>I hope there is a solution to this or a lead that I can follow. Thanks guys, you are all the best when I've come to the point of pulling my hair out!</p>

Below is a snippet of the code of a method I have in the implementation file. I'm getting an error ....(scrollTheView' undeclared)... also i have another error stacked with it that is (expected ';' before ':' token).....</p>

<p>Below this method I will include my entire Header file, which i've declared the method ""scrollTheView"" so i dont understand where i went wrong. The tutorial was using SDK iPhone OS 2.2.1, I however am using SDK iphone 4.3, could this be the actual cause for this problem? I've edited the post to include the entire implementation file. At the end of the code i also get a error 'expected declaration or statement at end of input' and another saying '@end' missing in implementation context' thanks for all those who viewed and are tryiing to help me.<br>
 thank you scott for helping me out with that missing bracket.. now i have a notice that pops up even tho  it compiles .. "" UIKeyboardBoundsUserInfoKey is deprecated notice""  anyone know what that means? as it stil compiles, should i be worried? it appears on the line of ""NSValue* aValue.....

<p>I was trying to learn to use the queue method, but of course initially I wanted to see what happens if I do it wrong, so I wrote this piece of code, which approximates pie for a few seconds:</p>

<pre><code>import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
from threading import Thread
import math

window = tk.Tk()
window.geometry(""300x150"")

lbl = tk.Label(window, text=""Press Start"")
lbl.place(width=280, height=60, x=10, y=10)

pb = ttk.Progressbar(window)
pb.place(width=280, height=25, x=10, y=80)

def calculate():
    """""" 1 / i^2 =  PI^2 / 6 """"""
    s = 0.0
    for i in range(1, 10000001):
        s += (1 / i**2)
        if i % 1000000 == 0:            
            value = math.sqrt(s * 6)
            lbl.config(text=value) #???
            pb.step(10) #???

def start():
    lbl.config(text=""Press Start"")
    #calculate() #irresponsive GUI this way, obviously
    t = Thread(target=calculate)
    t.start()

btn = tk.Button(window, text=""Start"", command=start)
btn.place(width=280, height=25, x=10, y=115)

window.mainloop()
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I understand, lines marked by the <code>???</code> comment are the problem. But this code runs just fine. Stays responsive, both the label and the progress bar are updated.</p>

<p>Is this cross-thread error undeterministic in terms of sometimes it happens / sometimes not? Would this code potentially break eventually? Or am I naive to believe the only good solution is a queue? I believe in C# this would yield a <code>cross-thread operation not valid</code>, but python doesn't seem to have a problem with it. </p>

I have validation occuring on controls on one tab that enforce dependent validation of controls on the other tab.  However, when the user switches to the second tab, it does not show any the red square around the validated control because the tab contents aren't rendered until that TabItem is viewed for the first time.  Is there a way to load the contents of all tabs when the Window is loaded?</p>

<p>I figured out a way to do this, but it feels very hacky.  I added the following code to the MainWindow_OnLoaded event handler in my code behind:</p>

{
    MainTabControl.SelectedIndex = tabIndex;

<p>This code simply loops through all tabs in the TabControl and sets them as the active tab and updates the layout.  That forces all the contents to initialize.  It all happens before the window appears so the user doesn't see the change.  I only have 2 tabs in my TabControl, but I could see this being a bit more awkward if there were more tabs.</p>

<p>What am I doing horribly wrong? I guess it's my lack of knowledge about object-oriented programming that's causing this. It's not the extras causing it, and the context should be correct as well, as it works for another method from the same instance.</p>

<p>Edit: detailed explanation</p>

<p>The LookingForGPS activity has a LocationManager (not using a service because it has some limitations that are too complicated for me to work around). Each time <code>onLocationChanged</code> is called, the <code>Run</code> activity is instantiated (I check whether it has actually been started first, it gets started by the user independetly of the LocationManager), and the <code>getAndSetValues</code> method inside <code>Run</code> is called, giving a bunch of parameters. <code>getAndSetValues</code> then performs some calculations and updates some <code>TextViews</code> in  the <code>Run</code> activity (which all works fine). A calculation is also performed to see whether a certain condition has been met. If it has been, the <code>postRun</code> activity is supposed to be started, which is when I run into the exception above.</p>

<p>I'm using JavaScript file called <code>cunfonRTL.js</code>, the content is: </p>

As far as I know there is a jQuery conflict with the $ selectors.
I converted all my $ sings with <code>jQuery</code>
There is no exception now, its just dont run.</p>

<p>I did some debugging and discovered he is not getting inside this loop:
<code>jQuery('bdo.cufon').each(function()</code></p>

<p>I'm trying to send a POST request with a JSON payload and a cookie (containing authentification information) to a REST webservice.
The JavaEE-Server reads the HttpServletRequest's InputStream but <strong>the last 23 bytes are missing (even though they are in the request)</strong>. The server works fine with requests sent via curl or this <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/rest-client/"" rel=""nofollow"">Java RESTClient</a> (by WizTools.org)</p>

<p>When looking at the Packet that was sent I noticed that <strong>the amount of bytes that are ignored when reading the inputStream is the same amount of data as the description of the accepted Cookies i.e. Cookie2: $Version=1\r\n</strong></p>

<p>So what is probably happening is that the requests content-length is correct for the JSONdata (27 Bytes), but because the inputStream includes the 'Cookie2: $Version=1\r\n' (23 bytes) only 4 bytes of the JSON String get read before the Reader exits.</p>

<p>Now the problem: I cant get rid of the CookiePolicy information!</p>

<h2>JavaCode from within an AsyncTask :</h2>

<p>(GET Requests using the Cookie are working fine btw)</p>

    cookie.setDomain(domain);
    cookie.setPath(""/"");
    cookieStore.clear();
    cookieStore.addCookie(cookie);
    httpClient.setCookieStore(cookieStore);
}

@Override
protected JSONObject doInBackground(Object... params) {
    String uri = (String) params[0];

    JSONObject jerg = new JSONObject();
    String response;

    HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();
    ResponseHandler&lt;String&gt; responseHandler = new BasicResponseHandler();

<h2>What i tried to get rid of it</h2>

<p>changing the parameter for cookie policy worked, but only resulted in different content influencing the supposed payload and with that a different offset than 23 bytes, e.g. the following resulted in a 2 byte offset (only the chars '\r\n' instead of 'Cookie2: $Version=1\r\n' disturb with that setting):</p>

<pre><code>httpClient.getParams().setParameter(ClientPNames.COOKIE_POLICY, CookiePolicy.BROWSER_COMPATIBILITY);
</code></pre>

<p>removing the parameter did not work as it defaulted to 'Cookie2: $Version=1\r\n'</p>

<pre><code>httpClient.getParams().removeParameter(ClientPNames.COOKIE_POLICY);
</code></pre>

<p>I have a very dirty workaround now, but help of how to get rid of the CookiePolicy Information or infos on why it is handled like it is part of the JSON payload are greatly appreciated =)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of v1.1, Open MPI requires that the size of C, C++, and Fortran
  datatypes be the same on all platforms within a single parallel
  application with the exception of types represented by MPI_BOOL and
  MPI_LOGICAL -- size differences in these types between processes are
  properly handled. Endian differences between processes in a single MPI
  job are properly and automatically handled.</p>
  
  <p>Prior to v1.1, Open MPI did not include any support for data size or
  endian heterogeneity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it mean that MPI_UNSIGNED_LONG must be either 32 bit on all hosts or 64 bit on all host? My cluster consists of 32 bit and 64 bit Linux servers. What is best way to insure that <code>long</code> and <code>unsigned long</code> has the same size on all hosts? Maybe I should use only <code>int</code> and 'long long' only? Those are 32 and 64 bits respectively on all hosts. Is it OK to have inconsistent data size as long as it is not used?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enter a sentence as input -this is called trigger string, is assigned to a variable-</p></li>
<li><p>Get longest word in trigger string</p></li>
<li><p>Search all Project Gutenberg database for sentences that contain this word -regardless of uppercase lowercase-</p></li>
<li><p>Return the longest sentence that has the word I spoke about in step 3</p></li>
<li><p>Append the sentence in Step 1 and Step4 together</p></li>
<li><p>Assign the sentence in Step 4 as the new 'trigger' sentence and repeat the process. Note that I have to get the longest word in second sentence and continue like that and so on-</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>import nltk
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
from random import choice

triggerSentence = raw_input(""Please enter the trigger sentence: "")#get input str
longestLength = 0
longestString = """"
listOfSents = gutenberg.sents() #all sentences of gutenberg are assigned -list of  list format-
listOfWords = gutenberg.words()# all words in gutenberg books -list format-

while triggerSentence:
    #so this is run every time through the loop
    split_str = triggerSentence.split()#split the sentence into words

    #code to find the longest word in the trigger sentence input
    for piece in split_str:
        if len(piece) &gt; longestLength:
            longestString = piece
            longestLength = len(piece)

    #code to get the sentences containing the longest word, then selecting
    #random one of these sentences that are longer than 40 characters
    sets = []
    for sentence in listOfSents:
        if sentence.count(longestString):
            sents= "" "".join(sentence)
            if len(sents) &gt; 40:
            sets.append("" "".join(sentence))

    triggerSentence = choice(sets)
    print triggerSentence
</code></pre>

<p>My concern is, the loop mostly reaches to a point where the same sentence is printed over and over again. Since it is the longest sentence that has the longest word. To counter getting the same sentence over and over again, I thought of the following:</p>

<p>*If the longest word in the current sentence is the same as it was in the last sentence, simply delete this longest word from the current sentence and look for the next longest word.</p>

<p>I tried some implementations for this but failed to apply the solution above since it involves lists and list of lists -due to words and sentences from gutenberg module-. Any suggestions about how to find the second longest word ? I seem to be unable to do this with parsing a simple string input since .sents() and .words() functions of NLTK's Gutenberg module yield list of list and list respectively. Thanks in advance. </p>

How could I access the textBox object on the main window from the user control. It works the other way round, i.e. I can access a user control textBox from the main window using the name of the user control and the textBox to access the textBox such as usercontrol1.textBoxName.
But it seems to me that I cannot access a main window textBox from the usercontrol such as mainWindow.textBoxName because the user control does not know the main Window and has no main Window object. Is this correct?

<p>This works but the comparison runs for hours after completing the resizes within 15 to 20 minutes. At first I assumed that it was a locking queue from which the workers got their combinations so I replaced it with pre-defined array chunks. This did not reduce the execution time. I also ran it without moving the files to exclude a possible hard drive issue.</p>

<p>Profiling this using cProfile provides the following output.</p>

I did this based on a few other stackoverflow posts that I was reading through, one of which suggested <code>deasync</code> and another of which suggested <code>sync</code>. I think that the problem I am having is that <code>ret</code> is being set asynchronously, so this doesn't solve the problem. Right now, there is a pause, and then suddenly <code>openEmailPage</code> is fired the 30 times, although I was expecting there to be a two second delay between each fire. </p>

<pre><code>function runSyncForLoop(linkArray){
    for (i in linkArray) {    
        var ret = 0 ;
        setTimeout(function(){
            openEmailPage(linkArray[i])  
        },2000); 
        ret=""hello"";   
    }    
    while(ret === 0) {
        require('deasync').runLoopOnce();
    }
    return ret;

<p>This could would simply be the following if it didn't have the deasync/timeout stuff:</p>

If that matters, I don't request indexing from it - the component is always called with extractOnly parameter returning text content of the document only and not adding it to the index on its own straight away (the content is then added to the index ""outside"" as a text field of the document following the standard procedure).</p>

<p>However, some files are not parsed and the component returns 500 Internal Server Error with no other details provided. Of all *.doc files submitted by our users about 30% of them fail to parse.</p>

<p>It is not the problem with Solr load - the files that cannot be parsed are always the same if you parse the same list of them again and again. It is also not about their size - many of them are smaller than other ones parsed successfully. Apparently, it is not about peculiar formatting (or at least that is not obvious) - almost all documents that fail to parse have coloured fonts, tables and images but many of the ones parsed successfully also have the same.</p>

<p>All these files open in Word without any warnings or errors. If you save them as docx Solr starts parsing them correctly but re-saving them in the same doc format with the same content doesn't help. Still, if all the content is removed and replaced by some lorem ipsum text, then saved as doc, they become correct.</p>

<p>As the content replacing helps, it should be something with some elements used in the documents but there is no description on <a href=""http://tika.apache.org/0.9/formats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Tika Formats</a> page telling in which cases parsing of the document fails. </p>

<p>I've uploaded a <a href=""http://cid-a1536158da2757c3.office.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Attachements/generic%5E_failed.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">sample file</a> which fails to be parsed in case if anyone is curious enough to try it (it is archived to prevent Windows Live from converting it into ""online document"").</p>

<p>Currently as a way around I use an ancient <a href=""http://www.winfield.demon.nl/#Programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">antiword</a> utility to parse those *.doc on which Solr fails (and antiword parses them perfectly). Still, it is obviously a crutch and I wonder if anybody else is facing the same issue - I failed to google it so probably that's me doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Or, if that's a known problem, what could be more elegant ways to solve it (I don't like relying on antiword)?</p>

<p>In my app I have a list of favorites. Due to API TOS I can't store any data, so I just keep a stub I can use to lookup when the user opens the app. I also have to look up each favorite one by one as there is no batch method. Right now I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code> self.api.loadFavorite(id, completion: { (event, errorMessage) -&gt; Void in
     if errorMessage == """" {
         if let rc = self.refreshControl {
             dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) { () -&gt; Void in
                 rc.endRefreshing()
             }
         }
         dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) { () -&gt; Void in
         self.viewData.append(event)
             self.viewData.sortInPlace({ $0.eventDate.compare($1.eventDate) == NSComparisonResult.OrderedDescending })
             self.tableView.reloadData()
         }
     } else {
         // some more error handling here

     }
 })
</code></pre>

<p>in api.loadFavorite I'm making a typical urlSession.dataTaskWithURL which is itself asynchronous.</p>

<p>You can see what happens here is that the results are loaded in one by one and after each one the view refreshes. This does work but its not optimal, for long lists you get a noticeable ""flickering"" as the view sorts and refreshes.</p>

<p>I want to be able to get all the results then just refresh once. I tried putting a dispatch group around the api.loadFavorites but the async calls in dataTaskWith URL don't seem to be bound by that group. I also tried putting the dispatch group around just the dataTaskWithURL but didn't have any better luck. The dispatch_group_notify always fires before all the data tasks are done. </p>

<p>Am I going at this all wrong? (probably) I considered switching to synchronous  calls in the background thread since the api only allows one connection per client anyway but that just feels like the wrong approach.</p>

<p>I'd love to know how to get async calls that make other async calls grouped up so that I can get a single notification to update my UI.</p>

<p>For the record I've read about every dispatch group thread I could find here and I haven't been able to make any of them work. Most examples on the web are very simple, a series of print's in a dispatch group with a sleep to prove the case.</p>

<p>For example lets say the game is about making a garden of sort (2d non-isometric) and you add you have </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>layer 1 - bg [no animation]</li>
  <li>layer 2 - soil (where plants can be)    [no animation]</li>
  <li>layer 3 - plants (40 different plant    sprites on display at a
  single time)    [no animation]</li>
  <li>layer 4 - animation of bugs and flies    sprites constantly moving on
  top</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>would this be practical? or is there a better way?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>+(CGSize)postLabelSizeForPost:(ANKPost *)post
{
  CGFloat labelWidth = 220.0f;
  NSAttributedString *text = [BXTPostCell mutableAttributedStringForPost:post];
  NSStringDrawingOptions options = NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin | NSStringDrawingUsesFontLeading;
  CGRect boundingRect = [text boundingRectWithSize:CGSizeMake(labelWidth, CGFLOAT_MAX)

                                         context:nil];
  CGFloat height = (CGFloat) (ceil(boundingRect.size.height));

  return CGSizeMake(labelWidth, height);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I use this method, the text doesn't actually fit inside this size - the size is consistently too short. </p>

<p>At first, I'd thought the issue was with emoji characters - but it seems to be happening for many tableviewcells in the app.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I've talked with a few folks, and it sounds like the issue may be an underlying bug with <code>boundingRectWithSize:options:context:</code>. I figured out a workaround: create a dummy <code>UILabel</code>, give it the same attributes as the <code>UILabel</code> in the tableview cell (<code>numberOfLines</code>, etc) and then use <code>sizeThatFits:</code> to calculate the size. It's a hack, to be sure - but it solves my problem sufficiently. I wish it were more elegant, though!</p>

And if one of the title exist there, i want to put some text after it. I tried to do it, but i don't know what is the problem. Last time i tried it with this jquery code:</p>

<pre><code>var cim = $.trim($('.hirblokk span.comments:contains(""új"")').parent("".hirblokk"").children(""h3"").text());
jQuery.each(cim, function(X) {
    $(""ul.s_hir.show li.hir a:contains(X)"").find(""small"").append("" (Új!)"");
    return (this == cim.length);
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see i put the texts what i wanted to 'cim'(it is working). Than i tried (line 3) to check if one of the  'ul.s_hir.show li.hir a' contains one of the text, and if it containes, i put (append) something in the small tag (there is a small tag inside a tag : Text..)(this is not working). I tried it in more ways, but none of them worked.
If i write:</p>

<pre><code>$(""ul.s_hir.show li.hir a:contains(a)"").find(""small"").append("" (Új!)"");
</code></pre>

<p>than it will put ' (Új)' after every <em>small</em> tag when the <em>a</em> contains a character. So it looks like the problem is how i want to check if it <em>a</em> contains one of the text.
Oh, and i can get more than whan text for example: 'I am new' and 'Oh, hello darling' and only one of them contains *ul.s_hir.show li.hir a*</p>

<p>I have following requirements with different REST calls:</p>

<li>POST Rest call - should create an employee without address.</li>
<li>GET Rest call - should retrieve an employeee. Address should also come if it exist.</li>

1. when i do ""getSession().update(object)"" , I get hibernate's StaleStateException: Batch update returned unexpected row count from update [0]; actual row count: 0; expected: 1.
 is this not possible with ""update"" if address does not exists? can't I create a new address during update?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>do i need to change my ServiceImpl call to ""getSession().merge(object) ? is this case can only be handled by calling ""merge"" ? how it impacts performance?</p></li>
<li><p>If i do merge, i get hibernate's IdentifierGenerationException: attempted to assign id from null one-to-one property.
Am i missing something here? </p></li>
<li><p>this can be solved by changing hibernate mapping? or somethin related to cascade.</p></li>
<li><p>what is the importance of @GeneratedValue(generator=""gen"") here? why is @parameter used in @GenericGenerator</p></li>

<p>In my project, I need to do paging for a set of around 20,000+ records which is a joined result from multiple tables, and it need to be sorted differently in different scenarios.</p>

<p>Currently, there are 2 options in front of me:</p>

<p>1, do it by using store procedure on database tier  <code>ie. where dl.[row_number] between @index*@size+1 and @index*@size+@size</code>. 
The problem of doing it is, you will have to write Store Procs for each sorting seperately. </p>

<p>2, do it on Business Logic tier, and do paging and sorting above the result. <code>(ie. skip(), take())</code>
But it is not ideal neither, since you may end up retrieving 20,000 records, but only 10 of them is used</p>

I have seen many single window WPF application examples that don't need to be anything else but a single window and i've  looked at applications such as FamilyShow which looked promising until all I could see in the code was a big pile of user controls that faded in and out over the lifetime of the application and not something I could really use for lets say a 30-40 views in an application.</p>

<p>So what exactly am I asking? Well should I build a LOB application as a single WPF window with lets say a panel that has user controls dynamically loaded into it and then swap these out when lets say a navigation item is pressed or should I have multiple window forms that get shown or hidden when lets say a navigation item is pressed from a launching main form.</p>

<p>UI Design has never really been my strengh but i'm keen to learn so I would really appreciate your thoughts and offered experience in laying out your WPF LOB applications (Window+UC's or Windows) or could point me to any articles that cover WPF UI Layout design for LOB applications.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading...</p>

I can do add , remove, delete , move operation over the files and directories. Now due to a bug somehow whenever a file is moved from a parent node to another parent node its reference is not removed from the earlier parent node. </p>

<p><strong>Approach taken so far:</strong> The approach I am thinking of is to first traverse though the whole directory structure and then keep all the file references in a hashset and before inserting any value to the hashset I will check if it already exists, if yes then this is a corrupt file having duplicate parent nodes .</p>

<p>My 2d Array is ""fullData"" of type <code>List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>. ParserIPAM is an inherited class and i declare fullData in its super class.</p>

<p>This is my code within main:</p>

<pre><code>for(String filename : filefetcher.getFiles()){
            System.out.println(""file to parse: ""+ filename);
            ipam = new ParserIPAM(filename);

            boolean flag = true;
            System.out.println(""------------------------------------------"");
            for(List&lt;String&gt; row : ipam.getSqlData()){
                //queries.insertVars(row);
                //System.out.println(row);
            }
            //System.out.println(i);
            ipam.clearSqlData();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my code where I fill the 2d Array: </p>

<pre><code>public ParserIPAM(String filename){
        super(filename);
        try {
            Parse(filename);
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        SpecialOperations(fullData);
        //System.out.println(""+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++""+ls2d.size());
    }

    @Override
    void Parse(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException{

        Scanner bufferinput = new Scanner(bufRead);
        String nextline = bufferinput.nextLine();
        int i = 0;
        while(bufferinput.hasNext()){
            Raw.clear();
            nextline = bufferinput.nextLine();

            for(String cell: nextline.split("",(?=([^\""]*\""[^\""]*\"")*[^\""]*$)"")){
                Raw.add(cell);

            fullData.add(Raw);

        }

        for(List&lt;String&gt; sub: fullData){

                //System.out.println(sub); ///THIS DOES NOT PRINT CORRECTLY

        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: ParserIPAM is an inherited class. Here is the complete code for the super class:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public abstract class Parser {
    protected static String filename;
    //private List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; dataArray = new ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()&gt;();
    protected List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; fullData = new ArrayList&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
    public Parser(String filename){
        //this.filename = filename;
    }
    //Parse will only parse file and put raw data into a 2d ArrayList.
    abstract void Parse(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException;
    //SpecialOperations will add additional data to raw data for table insertions.
    abstract void SpecialOperations(List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; data);


}
</code></pre>

<p>When I print everything out in the last System.out it prints the correct number of elements (256) but it always prints out the last line of the file 256 times in a row. I'm not exactly sure if I'm filling the array incorrectly or if I'm printing it incorrectly. Either way its wrong and I can't seem to figure it out.</p>

<p>I know there is probably a better way to do this than with an ArrayList, but that's not affecting the issue I'm having.</p>

<p>But, the directive don't work, i juste have my tag.</p>

<p>However, if i place manually the tag in client.html, the directive works fine.</p>

<p>I know i miss something important and need help to understand, so thx in advance for your support.</p>

<p>Here is my client.html :
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""client"" ng-controller=""ClientController""&gt;
&lt;tabset&gt;
    &lt;tab ng-repeat=""tab in tabs"" active=""tab.active"" disable=""tab.disabled""&gt;
        &lt;tab-heading ng-bind-html=""tab.title""&gt;{{ tab.title }}&lt;/tab-heading&gt;
        &lt;div ng-bind-html=""tab.content""&gt;{{ tab.content }}&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/tab&gt;
    &lt;tab-heading&gt;
        &lt;button ng-click=""newSearch()""&gt;&lt;span class=""glyphicon glyphicon-plus""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/tab-heading&gt;
&lt;/tabset&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my Controller and some very simple Directive :</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>app.controller('ClientController', ['$scope', '$sce', function($scope, $sce) {  
    var ctrl = this;

    $scope.tabs = [

            content: $sce.trustAsHtml('&lt;client-resume&gt;&lt;/client-resume&gt;')
        },
    ];
    ctrl.openView = function(title, content) {

        var tab = {

<p>I've checked here (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3624911/sharing-interfaces-that-are-implemented-in-wcf-service"">Sharing Interfaces that are implemented in WCF Service</a>) but it differs in that what I'm trying to accomplish involves an interface that <em>is</em> marked with ServiceContract.</p>

<p>I.e. in the service, I have an interface A (marked as a ServiceContract) and an extending interface B (also marked as a ServiceContract).  B is implemented by the WCF service.</p>

<p>The exact extension goes along the lines of this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface A&lt;T&gt;

public interface B : A&lt;SpecificType&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(""SpecificType"" is marked as a DataContract.)</p>

<p>Obviously, B is exposed to the WCF client in the proxy-generating process; however, I need to expose interface A, as well (I'm implementing a semi-generic pub/sub system and the ""publisher"" needs to be able to check/rely on interface A).</p>

<p>The first way I tried to solve this was by creating a separate, ""shared"" assembly that contained the interface and could be used by both the service and the client; however, that ended up not working so well because, in the publisher, it needs to ensure that an instance of B is, in fact, properly extended from A.  This implicit conversion fails, likely because the service reference doesn't seem to entirely jive with the ""shared"" assembly.</p>

<p>To get around this, I manually edited the Reference.cs file and it ended up working (I added the definition of interface A and made sure interface B referred to it properly).  But this poses a large problem in that every time I update the service reference, this code will get wiped out.</p>

<p>Having looked at other WCF responses on this site and others, I can't quite seem to find an exact answer (perhaps I just didn't get through all of them and their responses).</p>

<p>If someone could point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it.</p>

Meaning that I'm using the yield expression to pass values into the generator and then sending messages back and forth between various of these generator coroutines.</p>

<p>I am trying to chain together coroutines into a loop that iterates a value, whilst remaining open to new values originating from outside the loop. In other words, the loop should be non-blocking:</p>

<p>This is the loop:</p>

<pre><code>coroutine_A -&gt; val = (yield) -&gt; does something to val -&gt; coroutine_B.send(other_val)
coroutine_B -&gt; val = (yield) -&gt; does something to val -&gt; coroutine_C.send(other_val)
coroutine_C -&gt; val = (yield) -&gt; does something to val -&gt; coroutine_A.send(other_val)
</code></pre>

<p>And from time to time I want to pass a new value from the outside of this loop to coroutine_A, and then off it goes again.</p>

<pre><code>EXTERNAL TO LOOP -&gt; coroutine_A.send(message) -&gt; loop continues from new value...
</code></pre>

<p>The individual pieces work fine, but two issues arise when I try to connect them up. Firstly, how to instantiate these as a loop, which seems doable, but leads to a deeper issue as elaborated on beneath.</p>

<p><strong>THE FIRST ISSUE:</strong></p>

<p>When instantiating coroutine_A,  coroutine_B doesn't exist yet, so it isn't yet possible to tell coroutine_A what its message target is. Basically a chicken and egg scenario.</p>

<p>I've tried creating a container function that instances each of these coroutines (without message targets), and then creates a loop that manages the message on behalf of the coroutines like so:</p>

<pre><code>def func():
    A = coroutine_A()
    next(A)
    B = coroutine_B()
    next(B)
    C = coroutine_C()
    next(C)
    message_A = A.send(None)
    while True:
        message_B = B.send(message_A)
        message_C = C.send(message_B)
        message_A = A.send(message_C)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that it doesn't then seem possible to pass messages in from outside the loop because the while loop just gets stuck doing its thing.</p>

<p>Another way around this is to instantiate coroutine_A with a nested yield expression so that the target can be passed-in after instantiation time:</p>

<pre><code>def coroutine_A():
    while True:
        val = (yield)
        if val is not None:
            coroutine_B_target = val
            while True:
                val = (yield)
                if val is not None:
                    do something to val
                    coroutine_B_target.send(other_val)

A = coroutine_A()
next(A) # prime coroutine
A.send(B) # send in coroutine_B target and step into inner while loop
</code></pre>

<p>However, when coroutine_C tries to send a message to coroutine_A I get a ValueError exception: ""generator already executing"". </p>

<p>So both of these strategies basically lead to:</p>

<p><strong>THE DEEPER ISSUE:</strong></p>

<p>It appears that generators as coroutines can't loop back on themselves, and it seems that the reason for this is that the send call is a 'normal method', so effectively trying to chain a call-stack back on itself, i.e. doesn't allow recursion / reentry per David Beazley's <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/finalgenerator/FinalGenerator.pdf"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Generators: The Final Frontier</em></a> pages 127 to 131.</p>

<p>So its necessary to hand-off the information to a queue system and then dequeue and start a new call. But when I try this, I seem to get stuck with While loops that block messages originating from outside of the loop.</p>

<p><em>So, long story short, how does one, on one hand, keep the loop cranking over on itself while, on the other hand, remaining open to new messages originating from outside the loop?</em></p>

<p>Looking at the MATLAB documentation <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mean.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mean.html</a>, my assumption is that it calculates the mean over the matrix X in the first dimension (the column). What I don't see is the parentheses that comes after. Is this a conditional probability (where Y = y)? Can someone point me to some documentation where this is explained?</p>

I think the thing I'm trying to do is an existing problem in computer science, but I don't know what it's called and I'm having trouble finding information about it. Either way, here's the situation:</p>

<p>Let's say I have a set of teams <code>A = {1,2,3,...,n}</code> and a set of pairs of those teams <code>B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (6,9),...}</code>. B does not have every possible combination of teams from A. Assume that A has an even number of teams. My program is trying to create a subset of B (lets call that subset S) such that every team from A appears in S exactly once. It does this by moving the pairs from B to S, one at a time. Let's say that it has already placed several pairs into S. <strong>How can I find out whether it is possible to successfully create S given the current situation?</strong></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>A = {1,2,3,4}, B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (3,4)}

If after one move, S = {(1,2)}, then it can be completed by moving (3,4).
If after one move, S = {(1,3)}, then it cannot be completed.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
This algorithm will be one of the heuristics I use in my schedule generator. The goal is to implicitly split the schedule into ""waves"" where each team has one game per wave. So let's say that I have a pool of 16 teams and each team will have 5 games against other teams in the pool. An ideal schedule would make sure that no team has their second game before every team has had at least one game. The scheduler picks games one at a time and assigns them a date. So the idea is to have the scheduler keep track of the games scheduled in this ""wave"" and to never pick a game that would prevent each team from playing exactly once in the current wave. The scheduler also uses a bunch of other heuristics, so I can't explicitly order the games and have it go in order.</p>

<p>I'm sorry if this is unclear or not very rigorous. Feel free to ask for clarification and I'll do my best to explain further.</p>
