"4093166","1","4093404","","2010-11-04 01:33:19","","0","1924","<p>I have a data-intensive <strong>Python</strong> script that uses HTTP connections to download data. I usually run it overnight.

<p>You'll notice the socket error at the bottom. Since I'm using <strong>Python 2.5</strong> and don't have access to the third <strong>urllib2.urlopen</strong> option, is there another way to watch for and catch this error? For example, I'm catching <strong>URLErrrors</strong> - is there another type of error in <strong>urllib2</strong> or <strong>socket</strong> that I can catch which will help me? </p>

<p>In the Google Developer Console, Sony Xperia Z2 and Samsung Galaxy are marked as 'not supported'. How can this be? I basically covered all screen sizes up to xlarge. According to Table 3 at the Android Developer Guide (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html</a>) the Sony Xperia (1980x1020 @ 423ppi) and the Samsung Galaxy S4 (1980x1020 @ 441ppi) would be in xlarge/xhdpi, albeit the densities certainly exceed the values in the table. Is there a higher density qualifier that I am not aware of? What other reason would PlayStore have to exclude these devices?</p>

<p>I have been trying to figure this out for some time now, any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

Imagine it as sort of ""taking a picture"" or painting on top of the sphere so that the blue/gray texture spins with the sphere after a button is pressed.</p>

<p>As the fragment shader operates on each pixel it should be possible to copy pixel-by-pixel from one texture to the other, but I have no clue how, I might be googling for the wrong stuff.</p>

<p>However, in the ActiveMQ web console for the ""Active Listeners"" of our queue, I see that the ""Enqueues"" column count continually rises at a rapid rate (about 1 every second). Is this normal behavior? Is this just reflecting each poll of the listeners for new messages, now that we have prefetch=0?  It just seems a bit strange that the queues are showing an increasing Enqueue count when there's no actual messages they're working. Was also wondering if there's a way to throttle the poll frequency, or have some delay before each consumer polls the broker for new messages.</p>

<p>Pic of the console, showing the ever-increasing Enqueue count of each consumer with prefetch=0, even when there's no messages to work:</p>

Everything works great, except, now I want to be able to change the 'src' of the script depending on certain conditions when loading the page. The problem is, when I change the 'src', even though it changes in the DOM, it has no affect. The original 'src' is used and never updated.</p>

<p>Is it possible to dynamically retrieve the source of a remote site, or does this value have to be constant?</p>

<p>Edit: here is a sample of what I'm attempting:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://voap.weather.com/weather/oap/90210?

template=GENXV&amp;par=3000000007&amp;unit=0&amp;key=XXX""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
  var newS = document.createElement('script');
  newS.type = ""text/javascript""; 
  newS.src = ""http://voap.weather.com/weather/oap/90210?template=GENXV&amp;par=3000000007&amp;unit=0&amp;key=XXX"";
  $(""head"").append (newS);
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that the 'script' which is at the top works fine. The script I attempt to add dynamically does not work at all. It shows up in the DOM-inspector, but not in the page.</p>

<p>Also, see the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
  $.getScript(""http://w3schools.com/jquery/demo_ajax_script.js"");
  $.getScript(""http://voap.weather.com/weather/oap/90210?template=GENXV&amp;par=3000000007&amp;unit=0&amp;key=XXX"");
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>In this example, the w3school example works, but the weather does not.</p>

<p>I'm using Ember Data's <a href=""http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.ActiveModelAdapter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">ActiveModelAdapter</a> on my project and defining a few models like so:</p>

<pre><code>App.GiftCard = DS.Model.extend(
  destination: DS.belongsTo('destination', polymorphic: true)

  isCampaign: (-&gt;
    @get('destination.constructor') == App.Campaign
  ).property()
)

App.Destination = DS.Model.extend()

App.Campaign = DS.Model.extend()
</code></pre>

<p>My gift card model has a polymorphic relationship as the destination, and one of the types will be a Campaign.</p>

<p>This is all working as expected in the application, but now I'm trying to write a unit test for the <code>isCampaign</code> behavior using QUnit. The part I can't figure out is how can I create a GiftCard record and assign a Campaign as the polymorphic destination?</p>

<p>I have tried a few different ways. The first was to create a campaign record and assign it to the destination property:</p>

<h2>First attempt</h2>

<pre><code>campaign = @store.createRecord('campaign', id: 1)
@gift_card = @store.createRecord('gift_card',
  id: 1
  amount: 100.00
  destination: campaign
)
</code></pre>

<p>But that gives the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assertion Failed: You can only add a 'destination' record to this relationship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other thing I tried was just to create a destination record instead and specify the type:</p>

<h2>Second attempt</h2>

<pre><code>campaign = @store.createRecord('destination', id: 1, type: 'campaign')

@gift_card = @store.createRecord('gift_card',
  id: 1
  amount: 100.00
  destination: campaign
)
</code></pre>

<p>But in that case, <code>destination.constructor</code> is <code>App.Destination</code>, which is not what I want.</p>

<h2>Other info</h2>

<p>For what it's worth, the JSON from my API that sets up the relationship looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""gift_card"":{
    ""id"":1,
    ""amount"":100.0,
    ""destination"":{
      ""type"":""campaign"",
      ""id"":5
    },
    ""created_at"":""2013-12-10T01:17:30.373Z""
  }
}

In the parent form , there are buttons on the left side in panel.
In the remaining area of the parent form , the child window will be shown. I am positioning the child windows manually in a following manner.</p>

<p>1st window</p>

<p>2nd window</p>

<p>3rd window , in vertical manner. So, this also creates a scroll bar on the right side of the parent form. </p>

<p>Once you click the graph button , the child window is created and positioned in the bottom of all other child windows. Since, a new window was added , scroll bar size needs to be refreshed as well. the vertical height of the bar only changes when I hover the cursor on the scroll bar. 
So, I click on the button on the left side, then to update the scroll bar I need to move the cursor on the scroll bar which is in the right side.</p>

<p>I tried to access the scroll bar but since it was automatically generated, i can not find a way to refresh it or give a focus manually.</p>

<p>I tried to change MdiParentForm.VerticalScroll.Minimum and maximum after opening or closing the child window, but it did not help. I also tried to disable and enable vertical scroll along with MdiParentForm.AdjustFormScrollbars , but did not work.</p>

<p>I have autoscroll = false, since I can not make it true in mdicontainer form.
After i create the child window, I have written below in parent form.</p>

<p>I have a simple question that I need to solve. I am trying to do some quirky update on a table. Specific structure of the table is not important and my problem can essentially be reduced to the following one:</p>

<pre><code>update SalesTotal
set @total = total = @total + sales,
@flag = flag = case when @flag = 1 then 0 
                    when @total &gt; x then 1

<p>The question is CAN I TRUST that @total variable will have a new value ie. will execute before the second set part, or will it contain an ""old"" value (from previous assignment) or it is undefined. I am pursuing this problem for some time now, and can't find a solution and it is really important for my update (I want to update a table in one go). One of the values I want to update depends on the value of the other (in the same row) so the only way for it to work in a single update is if it works. </p>

"6949211","1","6950497","","2011-08-04 22:11:19","","0","368","<p>I have got a list which is:</p>

<pre><code>mylist = {
           'a': [(-1,-1), (0.2,0.4)] 
           'b': [(0.3,1.0), (-1,-1)]
           'c': [(-1,-1), (-1,-1)]
           'd': [(0.15,0.35), (0.05,0.15)]
          }
</code></pre>

<p>I have to get an output which will be like the following:</p>

<pre><code> mylist = {
           'a': [(0.3, 0.35), (0.2,0.4)] 
           'b': [(0.3,0.35), (0.05,0.15)]
           'c': [(0.15,0.35), (0.05,0.15)]
           'd': [(0.15,0.35), (0.05,0.15)]
          }
</code></pre>

<p>The list above looks like this when I print it,</p>

<pre><code>mylist = [ ('a', [ (-1, -1), (0.2, 0.4) ] ), 
           ('b', [ (0.3, 1.0), (-1, -1) ] ), 
           ('c', [ (-1, -1), (-1, -1) ] ), 
           ('d', [ (0.15, 0.35), (0.05, 0.15) ] ) ]
</code></pre>

<p>Now the algorithm is like the following:</p>

<pre><code>1st iteration: Compare a[0] and b[0] ie (-1, -1) and (0.3, 1.0). 
               Here replace (-1, -1) by (0.3, 1.0). 
               Rule: (-1, -1) is considered as empty or not in use so 
                     it gets replaced while comparison. 

               Similarly, compare a[1] and b[1] ie (0.2, 0.4) and (-1, -1). 
               Here keep the same value as b[1] is empty so no change. 

               Hence the new elements of 'a' are (0.3, 1.0), (0.2, 0.4). 
               Rule: if comparing with empty one then keep the same values.

2nd iteration: Compare new values of a[0] and c[0] ie (0.3, 1.0) and (-1, -1). 
               Here again no change. 
               Similarly, compare new values of a[1] and c[1] ie (0.2, 0.4) and (-1, -1).
               Here also no change. 
               Now the new elements of 'a' are (0.3, 1.0), (0.2, 0.4).
</code></pre>

<p>This process carries till 'a' is compared to the last element in the list here its upto 'd'. Then comes the turn of 'b' and same thing will continue between 'b' and 'c' then 'b and 'd' and so on. </p>

<p>The other rules when comparison between two actual ranges (0.1,0.3) and (0.5,1.0). </p>

<p>Say if two ranges totally overlap like (0.1, 0.8) and (0.3, 0.9) then,
it should take the common between them which is (0.3, 0.8). </p>

<p>If they don't overlap like (0.1, 0.4) and (0.5, 0.9) then,
it should choose its own which is (0.1, 0.4). </p>

<p>And if they partially overlap then also take the common between them.
Like (0.4, 1.0) and (0.8, 1.5) then it should choose (0.8, 1.0).   </p>

<p>P.S. The values (0.2, 0.4) are the ranges actually indicating the actual value will vary between 0.2 to 0.4. I think now I have explained a bit more clearly. Thank you</p>

object state changes in order to synchronize the updated state with the database.
<strong>It’s usually safe to return a different object from the getter method than the

value—not by object identity—to determine whether the property’s persistent
state needs to be updated. For example, the following getter method doesn’t
result in unnecessary SQL UPDATEs:</em></p>

But the problem is: the tasks workflow is entirely based in previous knowledge about tasks execution time to optime parallel performance. Below is a resumed version of my workflow so you can understand the problem</p>

<ul>
<li>Two main goals: execute some tests and validate database migration</li>
<li>To execute tests, I have to build the solution, build database projects and publish the databases</li>
<li>To validate database migration I also need to build and publish the databases (cannot be the same on which the tests will be executed) and need to do some ""extra stuff"".</li>
</ul>

<p>To optimize my workflow, I would like to run in parallel the build of the solution, the ""extra stuff"" and the build/publish of the databases, but I don't want to mix unnecessary dependencies, like the database migration waiting for the build of the solution or the test execution waiting for the ""extra stuff"".</p>

<p>In MSBuild and WWF4 I only know how to parallelize the activities by executing all the dependencies in one round then execute another set of dependencies...</p>

<p>Is there a better way of doing this? I mean, defining the workflow so the dependencies are automatically resolved and optimized.</p>

<p>P.S.: I'm using TFS 2012.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I've made a test building my project solution twice in parallel to see what happens. Turns out one MSBuild node waits the other to finish before trying to build my solution and then says it's up-to-date. Ex.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Project&gt;
    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
        &lt;Project Include=""MyProject.sln"" /&gt;
        &lt;Project Include=""MyProject.sln"" /&gt;
    &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

    &lt;Target Name=""Build""&gt;
        &lt;MSBuild Projects=""@(Project)"" Targets=""Build"" BuildInParallel=""true"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Target&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
&lt;!-- When I check the build log it says 
    1&gt; Project is building MyProject.sln (2) ...
    1&gt; Project is building MyProject.sln (2:2) ...
    2&gt; Building with tools...
    2&gt; ...
    2:2&gt; Building with tools...

    2&gt; ...
    2&gt; ...
    2&gt; Done building
    2:2&gt; Target ... skipped because it was previously built successfully
    2:2&gt; Done building
--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a desired behaviour, but when I try to rely on this to make my build workflow, my projects are built twice simultaneously, giving me lots of errors.</p>

<p>Is there anyway I can use Moq, NMock etc to Mock these classes (which are based off of a common interface)?</p>

<p>The point is, I want my url to reflect my folder strcuture. Witch is:</p>

<pre><code>~/Controllers/Admin/ 
~/Controllers/Supply/
</code></pre>

<p>My routeconfig look like this:</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(
                 name: ""Admin"",
                 url: ""Admin/{controller}/{action}"",

                 namespaces: new [] {""Web_Intranet.Controllers.Supply""}
            );
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that if you type on the brower url the following:</p>

<pre><code>localhost:4342/admin/users/showall
OR
localhost:4342/supply/users/showall
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Both will work!</strong> I assume that the routing checks wheter you pass a valid ""controller"" and ""action"" and chooses the first one that matches the condition.</p>

<p>How can I create a valid routing config that will not work if the corresponding prefix doesn´t match?</p>

    Session session = Mock(Session)
    service.sessionFactory.getCurrentSession() &gt;&gt; session

<p>Each cell is connected to its neighbor cell; basically we move up/down/left/right/diagonally to connect to another cell.</p>

<p>If each cell is viewed as a vertex in a graph, then we can find the adjacency matrix of the boggle board.</p>

<p>I came up with the following formulas to find the adjacent cells:
Assume the index of the cells start with 0 and are numbered from left to right.
i = cell index, n = number of rows/columns. So in a 3x3 matrix, i=0 would be the first cell and n is 3.</p>

<pre><code>up = i-n
down = i+n
left = i-1
right = i+1
diagonal 1 = i-(n+1), i+(n+1)
diagonal 2 = i-(n-1), i+(n-1)

<p>Example objects (these get called from a service):</p>

<pre><code>$scope.objArr1 = [
    { id: 1, Name: 'Name 1', Value: 'Value 1', },
    { id: 2, Name: 'Name 3', Value: 'Value 2', },
    { id: 3, Name: 'Name 3', Value: 'Value 3', },
];

$scope.objArr2 = [
    { id: 1, Name: 'Name 1', Value: 'Value 1', ObjArr1: { id: 1, Name: 'Name 1', Value: 'Value 1', }, },
    { id: 2, Name: 'Name 1', Value: 'Value 1', ObjArr1: { id: 1, Name: 'Name 1', Value: 'Value 1', }, },
    { id: 3, Name: 'Name 1', Value: 'Value 1', ObjArr1: { id: 3, Name: 'Name 3', Value: 'Value 3', }, },
];
</code></pre>

<p>Something along those lines. Basically if you can think of it this way; first array objects form buckets while second array objects form items that fit into corresponding bucket.</p>

<h3>First approach</h3>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li data-ng-repeat=""item in objArr1 | filter : someFilter""&gt;{{item.Name}}
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;!-- how to filter objArr2 items based on objArr1 property ? --&gt;
            &lt;li data-ng-repeat=""item2 in objArr2 | filter : someOtherFilter""&gt;{{item2.Name}}&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In simple terms I was trying to filter <code>$scope.objArr2</code> items that correspond to the current repeater <code>item</code> in the inner repeater. I tried various things with <code>someOtherFilter</code> but I was unable to reference the <code>item</code> from outer repeater.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>I couldn't figure out how get this filtering bit to work.</p>

<h3>Second approach</h3>

<p>When all else failed I decided to combine the data structures into one like so:</p>

<pre><code>// deep copy to avoid dependency
angular.copy($scope.objArr1, $scope.objArr3);
// loop over objArr3 and add empty array objArr2
// which we will populate a bit later
angular.forEach($scope.objArr3, function (val, key) {
    $scope.objArr3[key][""objArr2""] = [];
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then I setup a <code>$watch</code>-er`to monitor both <code>objArr1</code> and <code>objArr2</code> because I don't know when these will return.</p>

<pre><code>$scope.$watchGroup(['objArr1', 'objArr2'], function (newVals, oldVals) {
    // check to make sure there is stuff to loop over
    // i am wrongly assuming there will be items in both objArr1 and objArr2
    // i'll worry about what to do when there is no data a bit later
    if(newVals[0].length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; newVals[1].length &gt; 0) {
        angular.forEach($scope.objArr1, function (val1, key1) {
            angular.forEach($scope.objArr2, function (val2, key2) {
                 if (val1.Id === val2.objArr1.Id) {
                     $scope.objArr3[key1].objArr2.push(val2);
                 }
            });
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li data-ng-repeat=""item in objArr1 | filter : someFilter""&gt;{{item.Name}}
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li data-ng-repeat=""item2 in item.objArr2""&gt;{{item2.Name}}&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>While this has worked just fine on the surface I get a lovely <code>Error: [$rootScope:infdig] 10 $digest() iterations reached. Aborting!</code> in the console.</p>

<p>I am a bit puzzled what would cause for $digest to fire so many times.</p>

<p>However, by commenting update line <code>$scope.objArr3[key1].objArr2.push(val2);</code> of my watcher the error goes away. But then I don't understand how this would result in extra digest iterations.</p>

<h3>Halp</h3>

<p>In the end either of the approach that I came up with has some problem. While second approach actually does its job and populates my repeater correctly but there is that nasty error in the console.</p>

<p>Anyone with a bit more experience in this field please help.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Some of the silly things I tried with <code>someOtheFilter</code> are:</p>

<pre><code>data-ng-repeat=""item2 in objArr2 | filter : someOtherFilter""
$scope.someOtherFilter = function(item){
    // item is always the current inner repeaters item2 object
    // that just the way angular filter works
    return item.objArr2 === $scope.objArr1.Id; // this is silly but idea is there
};

data-ng-repeat=""item2 in objArr2 | filter : someOtherFilter(item)""
$scope.someOtherFilter = function(item){
    // if memory serves me right
    // in this case item is always repeaters current item2 object
    // with no ability to reference outer repeaters current item object
}

data-ng-repeat=""item2 in objArr2 | filter : someOtherFilter(item, item2)""
$scope.someOtherFilter = function(item, item2) {
    // if memory serves me right
    // in this case item was always inner repeaters current item2 object
    // and item2 is always undefined
    // again with no ability to reference outer repeaters current item
}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I gave up on first approach. But thinking about it now I might have been able to utilise <code>$index</code> (if inner repeater somehow or other didn't overwrite outer repeaters <code>$index</code> reference) to get index value of the outer repeater and try to get at <code>$scope.objArr1[index]</code>.</p>

<p>No matter which scenario would have worked for <code>someOtherFilter</code> inner working only need to compare inner object objArr1.Id to outer objects Id.</p>

<h3>UPDATE (learn from my mistakes)</h3>

<p>OK, after confirming the answer as working I still had the same issue in my production example <code>Error: [$rootScope:infdig] 10 $digest() iterations reached. Aborting!</code>.</p>

<p>After cooling down for a few days I decided to revisit this problem and this is what I found.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""block"" data-ng-repeat=""team in Teams | filter : validateAgeCategory""&gt;
    &lt;div data-ng-style=""getHeaderStyle()""&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;{{team.Name}}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;!-- bunch of things removed for brevity --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;ul data-ng-style=""getListStyle()""&gt;
        &lt;li data-ng-repeat=""players in Players | filter : { Team: { Id: team.Id, }, }""&gt;
            &lt;a data-ng-style=""getListItemStyle()"" data-ng-href=""#/players/{{player.Id}}""&gt;{{player.Name}}&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I adapted my Team/Player example for easier understanding. Regardless notice that in production I use a few <code>ng-style</code> calls to retrieve CSS.</p>

<p>Reason why I am doing so is because IE has a tendency to remove <code>{{}}</code> definitions from inline <code>style=""color: {{color}};""</code> definition during document load. It's IE bug so to speak.</p>

<p>Moving on, what I found is that the innermost <code>ng-style</code> was causing the error with $digest. By removing <code>data-ng-style=""getListItemStyle()""</code> everything is happy. Everything bu me of course.</p>

<p>Looking at this as an overhead it would be better to create CSS classes and instead apply classes based on some indexing to style my HTML.</p>

<p>There you have it.</p>

<p>I have two metrics, Y1 and Y2, that need to be graphed. The graph needs to show Y1 as an area for series 1, and the difference between Y1 and Y2 as an area for series 2 (with Y2 always being positive -- therefore, series 2 will always be more positive than series 1). That means the area for series 2 should not be from its line to the axis, but to series 1.</p>

The goal I'm trying to achieve is to have the the black series 2 (underneath the blue series 1) to shade in the inverse of what is overlapped by the blue. If the blue series 1 is positive, the black series 2 would be even more positive and the area would be between its line and the blue series 1 line.</p>

<p>The data for 5/2015 here are -600,000 for Series 1 and +500,000 for Series 2, so I would want the 500,000 difference between the two values to be colored by the black, rather than the -100,000.</p>

<p>Currently, it looks as if the celery event monitor (recv.capture?) blocks emitting events until the app is shutdown. I can see events being emitted through the ""Got task"" debug messages and when I kill my server all the events are spat out to my consumer at once.</p>

<p>Can anyone guide me on how I need to modify this in order to get them consumed at runtime correctly?</p>

<p>The logic is very complex because it needs to deal with many options and not-break backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Normally an encrypted password looks like</p>

<p>algorithm$salt$hash
algorithm$$hash  (no salt)
hash (legacy)</p>

<p>the hash is computing using the algorithm, the salt, and optionally a user provided key. The key is unique. The salt is different for each password.</p>

<p>Every time you call CRYPT()('password') you get a LazyCrypt object. This object can be serialized into a string. The string you get is always different because it contains a random salt. You cannot compare two of those strings because you always get false, even for the same password. Yet you can compare a LazyObject with a string and the lazy object will use the same algorithm and the same salt from the string to compute the hash and compare it with the hash in the string. Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = CRYPT()('password')
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = CRYPT()('password')
&gt;&gt;&gt; sa = str(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; sb = str(b)
&gt;&gt;&gt; sa == sb
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == sb
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = CRYPT()('wrong')
&gt;&gt;&gt; c == sb
False

class CRYPT(object):

    """"""
    example::
        INPUT(_type='text', _name='name', requires=CRYPT())
    encodes the value on validation with a digest.
    If no arguments are provided CRYPT uses the MD5 algorithm.
    If the key argument is provided the HMAC+MD5 algorithm is used.
    If the digest_alg is specified this is used to replace the
    MD5 with, for example, SHA512. The digest_alg can be
    the name of a hashlib algorithm as a string or the algorithm itself.
    min_length is the minimal password length (default 4) - IS_STRONG for serious security
    error_message is the message if password is too short

    Notice that an empty password is accepted but invalid. It will not allow login back.

    Stores junk as hashed password.
    Specify an algorithm or by default we will use sha512.
    Typical available algorithms:
      md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512

    If salt, it hashes a password with a salt.
    If salt is True, this method will automatically generate one.
    Either case it returns an encrypted password string in the following format:

      &lt;algorithm&gt;$&lt;salt&gt;$&lt;hash&gt;

    Important: hashed password is returned as a LazyCrypt object and computed only if needed.
    The LasyCrypt object also knows how to compare itself with an existing salted password

    Supports standard algorithms

    &gt;&gt;&gt; for alg in ('md5','sha1','sha256','sha384','sha512'):

    ...     print str(CRYPT(digest_alg=alg,salt=True)('test')[0])
    md5$...$...
    sha1$...$...
    sha256$...$...
    sha384$...$...
    sha512$...$...

    The syntax is always alg$salt$hash

    Supports for pbkdf2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; alg = 'pbkdf2(1000,20,sha512)'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print str(CRYPT(digest_alg=alg,salt=True)('test')[0])
    pbkdf2(1000,20,sha512)$...$...

    An optional hmac_key can be specified and it is used as salt prefix
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = str(CRYPT(digest_alg='md5',key='mykey',salt=True)('test')[0])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print a
    md5$...$...

    Even if the algorithm changes the hash can still be validated
    &gt;&gt;&gt; CRYPT(digest_alg='sha1',key='mykey',salt=True)('test')[0] == a
    True

    If no salt is specified CRYPT can guess the algorithms from length:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = str(CRYPT(digest_alg='sha1',salt=False)('test')[0])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a

I want it all to be mocked, as I don't want my tests to send any web requests around.

<p>but my test fails as soon as the object returned from the <code>service.Query()</code> method is used. I understand that in the 5th line the <code>entries.MockedInstance</code> was still null, so the <code>ExpectAndReturn</code> recorded the null as the return value - so what am I supposed to do? How can I set the mocks to return valid mock objects, instead of nulls?</p>

<p>Note - I am writing a .NET 2.0 project, so I can't use the Isolator features (I think). Would that have helped me? Or maybe switching to Rhino or MOQ would make it all easier?</p>

<p>I'm using google maps API, so that's why the structure can't change too much.</p>

<p>Ultimately my goal is to 'pin' one overlay view in place but have other overlay views still be able to be 'on top of' the pinned div. The only way I've found to pin the div is to use JavaScript to pull it up the dom two levels. I know this sounds confusing so I'll illustrate with some code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Standard Google OverlayView --&gt;
... unrelated div's
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;div class=""overlay-view""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class=""overlay-view""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class=""overlay-view""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;!-- 'Pinned' Google OverlayView --&gt;
... unrelated div's
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;div class=""overlay-view""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""overlay-view pinned""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have to move the pinned overlay up the dom so that the map will quit dragging it around.</p>

<p>The issue is that the 'pinned' overlay view is always above the other overlay views. I want it to be under it. I was successful in getting the pinned one to be under the others by playing with the z-index of the containers of the other overlay views, but that caused the markers to be above the 'pinned' overlay view. That's not the desired effect.</p>

<p>Is there anyway I would be able to achieve Marker on bottom, Pinned next, Standard overlay views on top?</p>

<p>While running within the VisualStudio 2010 environment, I can easily tell if my Winform application causes an exception.  I just have to go to Debug | Exceptions and make sure that both columns of checkboxes are checked.  I then run the application and if any exceptions then I get dropped straight into the offending piece of code.</p>

<p>How do I determine exceptions during testing, when I give test build to a tester.  I do not want the tester to run within Visual Studio, just as a regular user.  I still want to know if there are exceptions and the pertinent details.</p>

<p>Obviosualy, I should be able to control the process, so that when the code gets released normal execution happens.</p>

<p>Yes, I know about and use try/catch blocks, but I am talking about a method similar to Visual Studio exception catcher and reporter, just possibly compiled into the product and used for deployment to beta testers.</p>

<p>Maybe Visual Studio has such a feature, in which case where and how to set up, or possibly a third party component.</p>

<p>[Update:
I added two sub-questions, which you can find at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12731065/unhandled-exception-next-line-or-exit"">Unhandled Exception next line or exit</a>.</p>

<p>The solution mentioned below sounds great and with a tweak probably works, just not at the moment.</p>

<p>Inside the Visual Studio both 2010 and now 2012 works great. The exception handler gets called, okay after VS breaks at the line and I say to continue. I decided to test outside the VS2012 IDE, good thing for that. The OS traps the bug, shows the standard an ""An Unhandled Exception Occurred"" dialog giving the details along with a continue and quit buttons. Selecting continue, just continues the application with no trapping into my uber exception handler. Selecting quite, whites-out the application and displays the standard close window dialog. The quit button also does not call my uber handler.</p>

<p>The purpose is so that my exception handler gets called. I do not need an uber exception handler if I am working inside the VS2012 IDE. The purpose of the handler is for end users and beta testers, namely anyone other than myself and who will not have my development station.</p>

<p>So unless I am missing something, the question is still open.</p>

<p>There are code samples in the other question, enough to copy and paste and create a test application in a couple minutes time.

<p>I am trying to join 3 tables for my inventory report but I am getting weird results out of it. </p>

<p>my query</p>

<pre><code>SELECT i_inventory.xid,
       count(x_transaction_details.xitem) AS occurrence,
       i_inventory.xitem AS itemName,
       SUM(i_items_group.or_qty) AS `openingQty`,

WHERE (x_transaction_details.date_at BETWEEN '2015-01-18 03:14:54' AND '2015-10-18 03:14:54')
  AND i_inventory.xid = 3840
GROUP BY x_transaction_details.xitem
ORDER BY occurrence DESC
</code></pre>

<p>This query gives me this result:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tl0OO.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tl0OO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>See the <code>openingQty</code> column, I then tried to do a simple query to verify the result,</p>

<p>here's my query for checking the openingQty with joining only 2 tables <code>i_items_group</code> table (batches are stored) and <code>i_inventory</code> table (item Information are stored).</p>

<pre><code>SELECT i_inventory.xid,
       i_inventory.xitem,
       SUM(i_items_group.or_qty) AS openingQty,
       i_items_group.cost
FROM i_inventory
INNER JOIN i_items_group ON i_inventory.xid = i_items_group.xitem
WHERE i_inventory.xid = 3840
  AND (i_items_group.date_at BETWEEN '2015-01-18 03:14:54' AND '2015-10-18 03:14:54')
</code></pre>

<p>my result was:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0OIsd.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0OIsd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>which is the correct data.</p>

<p>I also made a query on my <code>x_transaction_details</code> table also to verify if its correct or not.</p>

<p>heres my query:</p>

<pre><code>select xitem, qty as qtySold from x_transaction_details where xitem = 3840 
AND (date_at BETWEEN '2015-01-18 03:14:54' AND '2015-10-18 03:14:54')
</code></pre>

<p>result:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cKFYJ.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cKFYJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Which would total to: 15-quatitySold.</p>

<p>I'm just confused on how did I get 3269 as a result of my query where as the true openingQty should be only 467. </p>

<p>I guess the problem was in my query with joins, its messing up with number of transactions then it sums it up (I really dont know though). </p>

<p>Can you please help me identify it, and help me come up with the correct query.</p>

            GROUP BY pd.id
            ORDER BY pd.method_type'; // Since pd.method_type is the discriminator column, I cannot order by it. And I need to be able to.

<p>I'd basically just like to loop infinitely between any number of divs using the previous/next buttons, AND move the .active class on the .dots to the corresponding li. Just not really sure how to go about it. I don't want to use a ready-made solution because A.) I'd like to keep the markup <em>just so</em> and B.) If one of you has a solution for me I'd like to reverse engineer it and expand the model to something a little more complex I have in mind.</p>

<p>Would really appreciate some examples if you guys have ideas. Thanks for any and all help!</p>

It's been a pain doing it manually. I've attempted to create this tool for the past few months, but keep getting stuck, dropping it and picking it up again. I think I got it down now, but have ran into a few issues.</p>

<p>I was able to use ImportXML function to scrape UPS's latest package status:</p>

<pre><code>=IMPORTXML(D3,""//*[(@id='tt_spStatus')]"")
</code></pre>

<p>My only issue with this is that it returns double results, one in the cell I've applied the function to and one directly below it, interferring with the next row of data. </p>

<p>I've searched google, stackoverflow and google forums and can not find a solution. It seems most people are not using ImportXML to scrape shipping tracking info, but script. Do you advise I use script to scrape this data?</p>

<p>Is there a way I can get the second result to not appear? It would work fine if I can just remove it.</p>

<p>I was able to get USPS to work:</p>

<pre><code>=IMPORTXML(D4,""//*[@id='results-multi']/div[1]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/h2"")
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried to get the xpath for FedEx, but it doesn't seem to work: </p>

<pre><code>=IMPORTXML(D5,""//div[@class='statusChevron_key_status bogus']"")
</code></pre>

<p>Not completely sure if I'm selecting the right xpath.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me with this. I've been going at this for days... Learning a lot, but still lost. Your help would be very much appreciated. </p>

Basically I've been dabbling with a bit of iOS development for a little while and now have a project idea that I want to start working on and for the first time I'm planning on putting this into source control.</p>

<p>Now I know Xcode 4 has some Git integration but I've spotted a couple of posts that suggest the integration isn't that great and it's better to do it the command line way.</p>

<p>So, I've been following instructions here <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a> and I've downloaded version 1.7.10.3 for Mac and ran the install.</p>

<p>However when I run git --version I get version 1.7.4.4 which is the version that was installed with Xcode I assume?</p>

<p>My question is, how do I make use of my new version 1.7.10.3?  The plan is to learn to use Git via command tools and set up a central repository on a server I have at home, then have local copies on my laptop.</p>

<p>As I say I'm really new to this, so a quick step by step idiots guide would be helpful.  I have searched and tried to find details here and on google but other than the suggestion to use Git outside of Xcode I've not found out exactly how to do it.</p>

<p>Any advice, or links to a decent tutorial that covers this would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I've changed the path to the new path in .bash_profile (/usr/local/git/bin) and now get git version 1.7.7.5 (Apple Git-26).  This still appears to be the wrong version (although this could be me being dense).  I downloaded the installer for OSX from the above link. Should I be doing something else.  I want to play around with the command line tools so I can get a proper understanding</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>I'm now also trying MacPorts as recommended in the article.  This seems to be downloading a lot more than just Git though</p>

Requests have this form:</p>

<p>gameserver.com/userId/givebonus/100</p>

<p>This for example would give the userId a bonus of 100.</p>

<p>Now, we encrypt the server request and it will become something like:</p>

<p>gameserver.com/42c34c234c234/ghjghjg4hj32g42jh2/424j23gh4h234h2j34j23</p>

<p>I'm not to fuss about some hacker trying to decrypt this to unveil the meaning of all of this,
what I'm worried about is <strong>sniffing</strong>.
Cos once the hacker knows that:</p>

<p>gameserver.com/42c34c234c234/ghjghjg4hj32g42jh2/424j23gh4h234h2j34j23</p>

<p>Gives a bonus of +100 <em>it could just keep sending the same request over and over again</em>.</p>

<p>So how do you prevent this?</p>

<p>Talking with few friends these are the possible solutions, but none of them would be either easy to implement or more secure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moving all (most) of the logic server side.</li>
<li>Handshake the first request and respond only to that mac address. (This won't work I think)</li>
<li>Changing private encryption key dynamically? How?</li>
<li>Encrypt the whole requests, basically using https? (Dont know how though :( )</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there's an easier answer I dont see :P</p>

<p>I have a custom HttpHandler that I want to process a request, log certain info then enter the details in the database. I'm using NUnit and Castle Windsor.</p>

<p>So I have two interfaces; one for logging the other for data entry, which are constructor injected. I quickly found out that there is no way to call the constructor as the default parameterless constructor is always called instead.</p>

<p>So I thought I would use Setter injection and let Castle windsor sort it out. This actually works as when I use <code>container.Resolve&lt;CustomHttpHandler&gt;();</code> I can check that the logger is not null. (In Application_Start in Global.asax.cs)</p>

<p>The problem is although Castle Windsor can create the instance the http application is not using it??? I think??</p>

<p>Basically the whole reason for doing it this way was to be able to test the logger and data repository code in isolation via mocking and unit testing.</p>

<p>As you may notice, when you click the Header, the box expands or collapses.</p>

<p>However, this only works when we click the Header, e.g. when we click the box's border (in collapsed mode) nothing happens.</p>

<p>To eradicate ""void-clicks"", I would like it to be like this:</p>

<p>A. In Collapsed Mode:
If you click anywhere on the box (.main-content class), the item will expand</p>

<p>B. In Expanded Mode:
If you click only the .Header class, the item contracts again.</p>

<p>What would be the best approach to do this ?</p>

<h1> UPDATE: </h1>

<p>OK, you were right. The CSS was a bit off.
I choose sandeep's solution as it was the most minimalistic but best working solution.
But also thanks to everyone else who helped. Especially the JS solutions from thecodeparadox &amp; Arif. (though it still has some ""void clicks"" around the border).
You are awesome, guys. I'll give you all a thumbs up.</p>

<p>The ""record.dat"" file is over 1MB in size, so I suppose the above program can get the data of the first 10 records without any issue (e.g. no need to handle <code>EOF</code> issue). However, when I compile the program in Dev C++ and run it, after reading 4 records, the <code>fread()</code> (marked by ** above) returns 0, and then subsequent <code>fread()</code> inside the while loop also return 0, meaning no data can be read. The stranger thing is all <code>errno</code> are 0, and when I use a g++ compiler in Linux to compile the same program, the program can read all (not just 10) of the records in the same file without any problem.</p>

<p>The following code, is sending an ICMPv6 packet probably due to IPPROTO_ICMPV6 but with kernel-added headers and quite bad packet content... (with a wrong destination address, I didn't fix yet some endianness issue). It worked in IPv6.
When I use IPPROTO_RAW, the packet is simply not sent...</p>

<p>I think the code is not the problem. Though if you have a better one I would be glad to see (or even better if you know a library which has this type of image manipulations).</p>

<p><strong>My problem is</strong> that after I run the algorithm on this image the guy's helmet instead of being green is light grey.</p>

<p>I have tried it on a silly example created in Paint and it works fine.
Thus, I think there must be some image setting or something of that kind which changes the rgb value I set to it in the algorithm. </p>

<p>I load a lot of youtube thumbnails on my page. They load from thumbnail urls I have in my db. </p>

<p>From time to time the video in question is changed or deleted by the author on youtube. This leaves me with 2 problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm loading the blank picture from youtube</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WFy1e.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ol>
<li>In my db I still have this image url listed.</li>
</ol>

<p>What would be a solution for figuring out the ""missing video"" thumnail, NOT displaying it, and updating my db. I need to fire an event by recognizing this image. Note that this is the default ""missing"" image that can appear different urls. So it's not a simple matter of seeing a particular url. </p>

<p>I also thought of using youtube api but making a bunch of calls every time the page loads seems counterintuitive to me. </p>

<p>I need to detect the image and fire so some of even for JS/jquery to use to update my db via ajax. </p>

<p>Maybe I'm overthinking this so if anybody has another solution to my problem I'm open.</p>

<h2><strong>I have read this: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14917664/javascript-detect-youtube-default-thumbnail"">Javascript - Detect Youtube Default-Thumbnail</a></strong></h2>

<p>But the solution above does not seem to fit. The first option in the answer is what I'm doing now and it doesn't work - because youtube serves the default image even when you use 1.jpg, or 2 etc..  (which is what I use). Basically the video is gone.</p>

<p>The second option (base 64 encoding, creating canvas element etcc) is not really expanded upon and seems rather like using a chainsaw in place of a scalpel. </p>

<p>I read 2 papers (<a href=""http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/264285/1/MarchandAdsettDamper_ISCA07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://web.cs.dal.ca/~adsett/publications/AdsMar_CompSyllMeth_2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>) about Tex hyphenation algorithm uses in syllabification. Authors stated about 95% accuracy in syllabification. I tested Synopse hyphenation only for counting syllables on <a href=""http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict"" rel=""nofollow"">CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a>, but only about 53% accuracy. </p>

<p>Why is the result significantly different? </p>

<p>I reproduce my method in a little detailed way.</p>

<p>I parse the CMU pronuncing dictionary to compute all number of words.
The CMU dic is like: </p>

<pre><code>PRONOUNS  P R OW1 N AW0 N Z
PRONOVOST  P R OW0 N OW1 V OW0 S T
PRONTO  P R AA1 N T OW0
PRONUNCIATION  P R OW0 N AH2 N S IY0 EY1 SH AH0 N
PRONUNCIATION(1)  P R AH0 N AH2 N S IY0 EY1 SH AH0 N
</code></pre>

<p>I will have this result:</p>

<pre><code>PRONOUNS=2
PRONOVOST=3
PRONTO=2
PRONUNCIATION(1)=5 // will be ignored
PRONUNCIATION=5   // use this one
</code></pre>

<p>Words with parentheses will be ignored when compared with the Synopse hyphenation lib. They are alternative or secondary pronunciations (variants).</p>

<p>Similarly, I will use the hyphenation lib to compute the number of syllables of each word in the CMU dictionary. Then I compare the two to see how many match. The words with different numbers of syllables are recorded like below:</p>

<pre><code>...

94814 cmu PROMULGATED=4 | PROMULGATED=3 Synopse Hyphenation
94821 cmu PRONGER=2 | PRONGER=1 Synopse Hyphenation
94829 cmu PRONOUNCES=3 | PRONOUNCES=2 Synopse Hyphenation
94833 cmu PRONTO=2 | PRONTO=1 Synopse Hyphenation
94835 cmu PRONUNCIATION=5 | PRONUNCIATION=4 Synopse Hyphenation

...
</code></pre>

<p>The total line number of CMU is 123611 (excluding lines with parentheses and lines without meaningful words, like quotation mark lines '(').
The total different number of syllables of the <em>same</em> words for the two:  57870.</p>

<p>CMU may not be the standard of syllable numbers. In this test, (123611-57870)/123611=53.183%. This is significantly different from the accuracy rate stated by the author in their paper above. Of course, they used a another database (CELEX) for their tests. Why is the result so different?</p>

<p>The Synopse hyphenation library is very fast. I want to know further if this is due to the pattern file (dic file used for hyphenation originally from libhnj used in OpenOffice). Or did the author of the paper use a different dictionary file?</p>

<p>This is a very dumbed-down version of a more complex form. In <code>.dojoxAlertBar</code>, the height is set to 100% for programming reasons. Things are all good, until I set the height for <code>#registerform</code> as a set number:</p>

<pre><code>/*    height:117px;  */
</code></pre>

<p>Without this, the height of the message is ""as big as it needs to be"". However, uncommenting the 117px height in the CSS has the result of making the height of <code>.dojoAlertBox</code> equal to <code>#registerForm</code>.</p>

<p>Can somebody please explain why that is? I keep on misunderstanding how ""height"" works in CSS. What does that ""100%"" actually mean? If it means ""100% of the containing element"", then why isn't it set as ""big"" even when there is no specified height for the parent?</p>

<p>In fact, if I can beg, having a simple table of how the height is calculated for fixed/absolute and relative/static elements, that would be great too.</p>

<p>The following code is from pp. 457, Chapter 17: ""Garbage Collection and Memory"" in ""The Java Programming Language, Fourth Edition"" by Arnold, Gosling and Holmes</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.ref.*;
import java.io.File;

class DataHandler {
    private File lastFile;        // last file read
    private WeakReference&lt;byte[]&gt; 
                         lastData;// last data (maybe)

    byte[] readFile(File file) {
        byte[] data;

        // check to see if we remember the data
        if file.equals(lastFile) {
            data = lastData.get();
            if (data != null)
                return data;
        }

        // don't remember it, read it in
        data = readBytesFromFile(file);
        lastFile = file;
        lastData= new WeakReference&lt;byte[]&gt;(data);
        return data;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to understand, just for the exercise of it, if this code is thread safe, with the part of code I am focusing on being the lines</p>

<pre><code>data = lastData.get();
if (data != null)
    return data;
</code></pre>

<p>My thinking is as follows: ""data"" is thread confined and is set to reference the referent of the ""lastData"" WeakReference. This creates a strong reference to the referent, hence even if after the null check, all other strong references to the referent outside readFile's scope disappears (what's the correct term ?) and even assuming the referent is not softly reachable, the garbage collector is not allowed to clear the weak reference thereby making the referent finalizable, because there still is the local strong reference to it from data. Hence if data is not null in the <code>data != null</code> line, it can not be null when returned in the following line. Correct ?</p>

<p>I can't get the console to consistently report values despite reading questions here about using the <code>delete window['console'];</code> method in firefox with firebug and Chrome.  But it appears that my .onclick function is changing all radios to unchecked, including the one that should be checked.  And as near as I can tell I am not selecting the radios in the validation portion, I've tried using the .val() and .value properties, but this code is my most recent attempt.</p>

<p>All I want is the radio that is clicked to stay checked with all others unchecked and to validate by determining if any is checked (including the cancel) OR if the textarea 'review_field' contains anything.</p>

<p>My final answer is provided below.  It is more elegant than my first solution, but I hope this helps someone in the future.</p>

<p>It works fine so far. I can use the endpoint to login/register on any site. If I am not logged in on the SMF, it will ask for my login and if that SMF login is successful, it accepts it.</p>

<p>However, it seems that it doesn't differ between different SMF logins. I.e. another user reported that he tried to use the endpoint on site X, logged in with his SMF account and landed on my user account on site X (I have registered the OpenID endpoint earlier on that site).</p>

<p>I guess I must send somehow the SMF login or make it somehow unique per SMF login. As it is probably trivial what I have to do, I thought I'd ask here on SO -- maybe there are also more things I need to fix.</p>

Also I want to make it possible to allow only certain people to login. What is a common way to get a unique string based on an OpenID login? In this case, I thought of something like <code>http://{smf-openid-endpoint}/{smf-user}</code> or <code>http://www.google.de/profiles/{google-user}</code>. What is a canonical way to get such a string?</p>

<p>To sort it, I use <code>sort</code>, but the output is not the one I'd expect.</p>

  p ""Unordered list is #{unordered}.""

  ordered = unordered.sort

  p ""Ordered list is #{ordered}.""
end

try_order

<p>And the output is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>""Unordered list is 80841159812813113212813914014114214212414414514814915297.""

<p>As you can see, the ordered list is not starting with the lower number, which is 80, but putting the 3-digit numbers which start with a 1 first.</p>

<p>I have 2 entities, <code>Person</code> and <code>Town</code>, which I need to link with a ""labeled relationship"": who can go to which town and how long does it take.</p>

<p>The constraints are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the time it takes a person to go to a town cannot be deduced from any other data;</li>
<li>for a given person, either a town is not accessible or it takes 1 or 2 or ... or 11 hours to go there;</li>
<li>there are 6000 towns and no town will ever be constructed/destructed;</li>
<li>there are initially 200,000 persons and that number will grow by 10~100 per day;</li>
<li>each person can go to 5~1,000 towns (in average, something like 100)</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent quite some time researching for the best way to model that, and so far I've found 3 ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> creating 11 many-to-many relationships (<code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code>, ... <code>r11</code>). <code>personA.r3</code> is the set of <code>Town</code>s which <code>personA</code> can reach in exactly 3 hours; and <code>townB.r6</code> is the set of <code>Person</code>s who can go to <code>townB</code> in exactly 6 hours.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> creating an intermediate table (<code>DurationInfo</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option 3:</strong> adding a <code>duration</code> attribute in the <code>Town</code> entity, each town being represented by 11 <code>Town</code> objects (one for every possible duration)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3FTGg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Graph representations of the 3 options</a></h2>

<p><em>According to me</em>, here are the pros and cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>option 1 has initially exactly 206,000 objects, it's the most compact (it's the only one I actually tried, and the sqlite files reach 100 MB and I'm not really willing to go far more than that...)</p></li>
<li><p>option 1 seems messy: I read that many-to-many relationships are not really recommended in Core Data, so having 11 of them...</p></li>
<li><p>option 2 seems to be the recommended solution for ""labeled relationships"", but in my case there are 20,000,000 <code>DurationInfo</code> objects (and that will grow by 1,000~10,000 per day), how much space does that take?</p></li>
<li><p>option 3 ""only"" creates 60,000 more objects, but I don't really like to have that many duplicated data.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there one (or more) other option I overlooked?</p></li>
<li><p>Which option is optimal in my case and why? Which should be my main concern when deciding which way to go?</p></li>
<li><p>Which option is optimal if some time in the future I need to slightly modify my model?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance for your insights!</p>

to use existing google maps data. Simply because I don't know how, I haven't found much on using existing data)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating a shared map</strong> ( I havent dived into this totally, but creating Starred items seems to work, I am just unsure how to present that data on a webpage instead on my own google maps...)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recreating locations from scratch with google maps api</strong> ( Totally a pain to do this, and I would be recreating all of the data I would need.  Essentially using the first solution.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Has anyone worked on something similar to this?  I am eager to research this further, however I don't want to go down the wrong rabbit hole if there are better solutions.  This is my first experience with custom google maps...</p>

<p>Would it be enough to keep tracking all the clients with creating a List where T would be a Socket class? What about the state object? Is it only used when data are being passed:</p>

<p>I got a global variable called Queue:</p>

<pre><code>private ArrayQueue&lt;ArrayQueue&lt;E&gt;&gt; Queue;
</code></pre>

<p>And inside my sort(), I am dequeueing the first two items from Queue and pass them to merge() as parameters:</p>

<pre><code>public void sort() {
    while (Queue.size() &gt;= 2) {
        ArrayQueue&lt;E&gt; first = Q.dequeue();
        ArrayQueue&lt;E&gt; second = Q.dequeue();
        System.out.print(""1st"" + firstElement);
        System.out.print(""2nd"" + secondElement);
         merge(first,second)
    }
}

public E dequeue() throws ArrayQueueException {
    if (isEmpty() == true)
        throw new ArrayQueueException(""Queue error"");
    if (front == rear) {
        front = front - 1;
        rear = rear - 1;
    } else
        front = front + 1;
    size--;
    return Q[front];
}

<p>Then inside my merge:</p>

<pre><code>private ArrayQueue&lt;E&gt; merge(ArrayQueue&lt;E&gt; q1, ArrayQueue&lt;E&gt; q2) throws ArrayQueueException {
    System.out.println(""q1 is "" + q1.toString());
    ArrayQueue&lt;E&gt; merged = new ArrayQueue&lt;E&gt;();
    String e1 = (String) q1.dequeue();
    System.out.println(""e1 is "" + e1);
    String e2 = (String) q2.dequeue();

    merged.enqueue(q2.dequeue());
            if (q2.isEmpty()) {
                // add remaining q1 elements
                while (!q1.isEmpty()) {
                    merged.enqueue(q1.dequeue());
                }
                break;
            }
            // take another element from q2
            e2 = (String) q2.dequeue();

Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>

Currently I have a class (pair) that will be initialized with two instances of a second class (participant). To unit test it, I would like to create two mocks of participants and pass them to the initialize method:</p>

<pre><code>def test_init
    participantOne = Minitest::Mock.new
    participantOne.expect(:name, ""P1"")
    participantOne.expect(:dept, ""D1"")

    participantTwo = Minitest::Mock.new
    participantTwo.expect(:name, ""P2"")
    participantTwo.expect(:dept, ""D2"")

    pair = Pair.new(participantOne, participantTwo)

    assert_equal(""P1"", pair.participantOne.name) #I would like to change this line
    assert_equal(""P2"", pair.participantTwo.name) # and this line


end
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but it is not 100% correct.
If I change the assert equal line to </p>

<pre><code>assert_equal(participantOne.name, pair.participantOne.name) #I would like to change this line
</code></pre>

<p>To compare the value of the stored participant with the value of the mock (which I would like to store), I get</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MockExpectationError: No more expects available for :name: []</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I don't really understand it. It seems that the ""expect"" I set before was already ""used"" during the execution of my code.</p>

<p>This is not exactly what I am looking for. I do not want to verify how many times a method is called, I would like to define a default value to be returned when the method is called in a given instance.</p>

<p><strong>How can I do that using minitest?</strong></p>

<p>I made some search and I read about stubs in Minitest. But as far as I understood they are meant to stub a method call for every instance of a class.</p>

<p>I would like to create two participants and define their name and dept information, without using the real class, so I can focus my test in the subject under test.</p>

<p>ps:
this is the init in my pair class</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(participantOne, participantTwo)
    @participantOne = participantOne
    @participantTwo = participantTwo
end
</code></pre>

I've always tried to follow a MVC pattern, even though I was doing stuff procedurally. Also, I'm used to some frameworks like CakePHP and CodeIgniter. However, I've not yet done anything from scratch using OOP. Today I was doing so for a college work, and I got to a few questions.</p>

<p>Usually, in frameworks, we just do <code>$this-&gt;database-&gt;query()</code>, on any controller class, and it works. On procedural, the <code>$link</code> to the database goes global scope, so you don't have to worry. I was looking for a way to do that with every class on my code, but to no success. The best I could get was using a Singleton class to instantiate the database, however, I needed to retrieve the database link in every single class. So for instance, in class Users I'd have to get it in the constructor, and at the Main class, and in every other one.</p>

<p><b>My questions is fairly simple. How do I use the database connection link through multiple classes, without having to instantiate the db in all of them.
And, if doing so is the best simpler way, is there any other way to do so than the Singleton method?</b></p>

<p>I'm using <b><code>Mysqli</code></b> lib, by the way.</p>

<p>Here's the class I've been using.</p>

<pre><code>class DB extends Mysqli {
    protected static $instance;

    private function __construct() {
        global $config;

        parent::__construct($config['db']['host'], $config['db']['user'], $config['db']['password'], $config['db']['database']);

        if($this-&gt;connect_error)
            die('Connect Error ('. $mysqli-&gt;connect_errno .') '. $mysqli-&gt;connect_error);
    }

    public static function getInstance() {
        if( !self::$instance ) {
            self::$instance = new self(); 
        }
        return self::$instance;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a class usage example.</p>

<pre><code>class Main {
    protected $db;

    public function __construct() {
        $this-&gt;db = DB::getInstance(); // &lt;-- having to do that in every class is the problem
    }

    protected function start() {
        $this-&gt;db-&gt;query(something...); // works
    }
}

<p>Currently, lots of the initial code in my functions consists of these parameter checks (empty strings, invalid characters, existing id, ...) and, while necessary, it is a bit ugly and obfuscates the 'real' code of the function. Typically, my code goes something like this: </p>

<pre><code>def my_function(p1,p2,p3,p4):
    #check parameters
    if p1 == ''

<p>Using tab 1 : I login giving correct credentials. works correctly.</p>

<p>Generate a unique 16-character key, to use as a batch name, that doesn't require any type of storage (<strong>e.g.</strong> a unique counter).</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have a Windows service that runs <strong>every 30 seconds</strong>. I picks up messages off of an MQ and processes them in a batch. One of the service calls I'm making is requiring a 16-character batch name now. <strong>They don't care what the batch name is</strong>, it just needs to be unique across all batches.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>If I generate a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.guid.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Guid</code></a>, can I use the first or last 16 characters of that string and it still be unique for my needs?</p>

<p>This exact copy of <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/change/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.jquery.com/change/</a> ... I changed the selector from "".target"" to ""input"".</p>

<p>However none of input element are handled by change event.</p>

<p>I get this error. And i am pretty sure that there are elements with input name</p>

<p>""Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'change' of null functions.js:378
(anonymous function)"".</p>

<p>Is it something wrong with logic or is there a syntax error. I narrowed down the error this much but i still don't see the problem?</p>

<h1>------EDIT------</h1>

<p>I test the answers and all answers are right.
When an event handler/listener assigned to elements via jquery selectors.</p>

<pre><code>$(""selectorStatement"").EventHandlerShortCut(function() {
  //Some code
});
</code></pre>

<p>When below code executed</p>

<pre><code>$(""input"").change // Change handler for ALL INPUT elements
</code></pre>

<p>Jquery engine get All the input elements ( !!All input elements that is declared and exist in that moment -the moment handler executed- !!)</p>

<p>After that moment if new element generated, Handler will not recognize that. The only thing that can prevent this is using $(document).ready which will call the code after whole document is created. As @Henrik Peinar , @Chandrika Prajapati , @G Z , @Gaurav , @Mzn Mentioned in their answers...</p>

<p>In addition to this,
In my case,</p>

<p>I generate some inputs by using</p>

<pre><code>document.anElement.innerHTML = ""&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>Which is used after the document is ready.
There can be 2 approach to this case.</p>

<p>This foo element can be generated while document is rendering. By using</p>

<pre><code>display:none
</code></pre>

<p>So the element can be read by jquery engine when document is ready. And can be made visible when the comes.</p>

<p>Or.</p>

<pre><code>$(""fooSelector"").handlerType(...
</code></pre>

<p>Handler caller can be called again again while page is dynamic. Which is a easy but a bad solution.</p>

I'm struggling with the problem. I have a ajax posts a JSON to a server uses Jersey REST GET, but nothing is working, I'm wondering if its the right way to do it.
Here is my previous questions with code regarding to the problem:</p>

<p>code in java implements in the server:</p>

<pre><code>@Path(""/helloworld"")
public class GetData {
    @GET
    @Consumes(""application/json"")
    @Produces(""application/json"")

        InputStream in = (InputStream) obj.values();
        String data = IOUtils.toString(in);

        JSONObject out = (JSONObject) JSONSerializer.toJSON(data);

        String result = out.getString(""name"");
        return data;
    }                           
}
</code></pre>

<p>Javascript code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    $.ajax({
        url: '/helloworld',
        type: 'POST',
        contentType: 'application/json',

    alert(""json posted!"");
&lt;/script&gt;

However, in an ""robust"" observer pattern implementation (one in which the error of a listener should not stop other listeners from being notified), an event publisher might be observed by <em>anyone</em>, meaning that the event listener might throw exceptions that the event publisher cannot possibly know (and that's the whole point of decoupling listener and publisher). </p>

<p>In this case, <strong>does it make sense to catch <code>Throwable</code> so that no matter what error happens in the event processing, other listener will still be notified?</strong> Or is it still a bad idea to catch such a generic class? </p>

<p>Something like this</p>

<pre><code>for (EventHandler listener : listeners) {
     try {
        listener.sendEvent(event);
     } catch (Throwable exc) {
        log.warn(""Listener "" + listener + "" failed to process event"");
        //maybe remove faulty listener...
     }

  }
</code></pre>

<p>Another, heavier alternative I can see to isolate failure of listeners is to use a thread pool so that if a listener throws an exception, only the thread of the pool will be lost but notification of other listeners will still happen</p>

<p>I would like to have a service which makes outbound connections to the clients, but once the connection has been made then clients would be able to make method calls against my service as if it were a conventional connection.</p>

<p>I suspect that this is some kind of a custom channel but wondered if
a) this had already been done
b) whether there were any pitfalls I should try and avoid</p>

<p>Note - that I'm not talking about a duplex style callback, but rather the client and server going on to have a conventional style conversation where the server responds to client requests through the standard wcf dispatcher - only the originator of the underlying tcp connection is the server rather than the client.</p>

<p>Siz suggests it is as simple as using a duplex contract.  To expand the requirements slightly:
  a) The client is prohibited from making connections to the server.  So if the duplex channel makes a seperate tcp connection then this won't work.  I think from my tests that it doesn't but shares the originating the connection under tcp (can anyone confirm?)</p>

<p>b) There are multiple services on the server that the client needs to call so the ""Callback contract"" mechanism of setting up the reverse connection will be awkward as there will need to be many ""register"" style calls to get them all set up.  Ideally I would like to set up multiple services all at once - is this possible using this approach?</p>

I have defined some methods on the proxy interface but unfortunately, I have some issues related to <strong>Content-Type</strong> not being set properly when sending http requests, which gives me an <strong>http 400 (Bad Request) error code</strong> since the remote API is expecting the <strong>Content-type</strong> header param to be <strong>application/json</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is how it looks like :</p>

<pre><code>@Path(""/"")
public interface RestAPIClient {

  @POST
  @Path(""/send"")
  String send(@CookieParam(""token"") String token, @FormParam(""name"") String id, @FormParam(""message"") String message, @FormParam(""emails"") List&lt;String&gt; emails);

}
</code></pre>

<p>is there a way to set the ""Content-type"" header as ""application/json"" directly at the proxy interface level ? using some annotations maybe ?</p>

<p>I have text strings that contain a month and a series of date. Sometimes, there are two months in the string.</p>

<pre><code>date1 = ""January 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24""
date2 = ""September 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, October 2, 3, 4, 10, 11""
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote a very WET piece of code that pulls the month from the string and adds each date, plus the year.
However, there are several issues I just can't figure out.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>ITERATING THROUGH THE DATES: I know I should use the EACH method to iterate through the dates. I tried but I can't get that to work, so I am doing it the hard way by concatenating the month with each date element. The obvious problem with this is, I don't know how many dates there will be so I have to build to the longest string and use an IF Statement to determine if I've reached the end of the string. I should use dates1.length = x plus DO EACH, but I can't get it to work.</p></li>
<li><p>CONCATENATING MONTH DAY YEAR: My very bad wet code works as far as pulling the monrg day and year together, but how do I get rid of the brackets and quotes?</p></li>
<li><p>MULTIPLE MONTHS: How do i choose the second month in the string, and concatenate ONLY the individual dates  that follow the month name to get MONTH/DD/YY?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a sample of my very bad code.</p>

<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'nokogiri'
require 'open-uri'

date1 = ""January 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24""
date2 = ""September 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, October 2, 3, 4, 10, 11""
datetext = date1.scan(/([\w\-]+)/)     #=&gt; pulls the whole string 
datetext2 = date1.scan(/(\w*)\s?/)[0]  #=&gt; this pulls the month
datenumbers = date1.scan(/(\d+)/)
firstdate = datenumbers[0]             #=&gt;ithe first date following the first month
seconddate = datenumbers[1]
year = ""2014""

mdy1 = ""#{datetext2} #{firstdate} #{year}""
mdy2 = ""#{datetext2} #{seconddate} #{year}""

puts date1
puts "" ""
puts datetext2 #=&gt; this variable adds the [0] delimiter to pull the 1st month
puts firstdate
puts "" ""
puts mdy1
puts mdy2
puts "" ""

<p>I'm trying to obtain <em>all possible matches</em> from a string using regex with javascript. It appears that my method of doing this is not matching parts of the string that have already been matched.</p>

<p>However, there is no equivalent help when the first query is enumerated. Inspecting into the LINQ implementation yields no useful data, probably due to the binary being optimized:</p>

<p>Is there a way to usefully inspect the enumerable values up the ""stack"" of <code>IEnumerable</code>s when not using query syntax? Query syntax is not an option because sharing code is impossible with it (ie, the transformations are non trivial and used more than once).</p>

<p>I would like to hook the open system call and execute some code before the call to open finishes.  I have read about using ptrace to do this, however I do not have sys/ptrace.h on this system (solaris).  I see documentation stating that /proc debugging interfaces should be used instead of ptrace(), but I haven't been able to figure out how to do what I want using procfs.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know if this is possible?  If so, how?</p>

<p>As a side note, I have also tried using the LD_PRELOAD trick to implement the open system call in my own shared library and have it call dlsym to find the address of the regular open system call.  I wasn't able to figure out 100% why this doesn't work, but it seemed related to the calls being inlined and not using an address table to lookup those functions.  However somehow <code>truss</code> is able to detect calls to open().</p>

<p>This was my code for that attempt:</p>

<p><code>cat wrap_open.c</code></p>

<pre><code>#define _GNU_SOURCE

#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<p>The <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Activity Life-cycle</p>
  
  <p>A GLSurfaceView must be notified when the activity is paused and resumed. GLSurfaceView clients are required to call onPause() when the activity pauses and onResume() when the activity resumes. These calls allow GLSurfaceView to pause and resume the rendering thread, and also allow GLSurfaceView to release and recreate the OpenGL display.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all I was slightly confused as <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onResume()</code> are, throughout the rest of Android, Lifecycle events as called by the System (Activity/Fragments). Here, from the description (including the detailed descriptions in <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.html#onPause%28%29"" rel=""nofollow"">onPause()</a> and in <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.html#onResume%28%29"" rel=""nofollow"">onResume()</a>) it seems that they have to be called manually by the developer.</p>

<p>I've been using <code>GLSurfaceView</code> <strong>without</strong> calling <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onResume()</code> and haven't noticed a problem. However, in the interests of playing ball (and decreasing likely suspects for strange behaviour on resuming the Activity) I'm trying to add them in as described in the documentation.</p>

<p>It seems however that using onResume() causes a <code>NullPointerException</code> to be thrown:</p>

<pre><code>07-23 13:20:08.570: E/AndroidRuntime(20777): Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException

07-23 13:20:08.570: E/AndroidRuntime(20777):    at com.ActivityNameHere.onResume(ActivityNameHere.java:151)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a step I'm missing to register the <code>Activity</code> with the <code>View</code>?</p>

What I expected to get back was an indicator of whether the operation worked or not. I think push() accepts an array of nodes, so an array of results would be sensible.

<p>The MSSQL 2000 server is fine, I can run all SQL statements and use mssql_num_rows and mssql_fetch_assoc much as you would with MySQL.</p>

<p>However, the MSSQL 2005 server won't work with mssql_num_rows or mssql_fetch_assoc - you have to use odbc_fetch_row.</p>

<p>That's not really an issue, I assum it's just due to the different server installs.</p>

<p>However, I have a huge issue with the MSSQL 2005 server: I cannot select a field AS another name!</p>

<p>Now, I have managed to resolve it by using auto-increment, Meaning that when I altered the id column (which is the PK) as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE `MYDB`.`brand_managers` CHANGE COLUMN `id` `id` BIGINT(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT  ;
</code></pre>

<p>It worked just fine!</p>

<p>I don't mind actually working this way (using auto-incremented id) but I simply don't understand why this is the only constellation that actually works. Why can't I generate a long type unique id using the ""IDENTITY"" generator?</p>

I was able to run this for IE. However, this doesn't work with Firefox 4. I keep getting a blank firefox window opening up and the server will just hang there. I believe that I've narrowed the problem down to the fact that the Selenium-maven-plugin uses the old Selenium 1.0 Core, which doesn't function properly with Firefox 4. </p>

Everything works fine, except when doing a query and extracting the result. The issue is with the <code>UnsafePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;</code> that is returned from SQLite in Swift as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var querySQL = ""SELECT address, phone FROM CONTACTS WHERE NAME = 'myName'""
var cQuery = querySQL.cStringUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)
var statement: COpaquePointer = nil
if sqlite3_prepare_v2(contactsDB, cQuery!, -1, &amp;statement, nil) == SQLITE_OK {
   if sqlite3_step(statement) == SQLITE_ROW {
   var address : UnsafePointer&lt;UInt8&gt; = sqlite3_column_text(statement, 0)
   var data = NSData(bytes: address, length: 10)
   var string = NSString(data: data, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)
   println(string)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we can convert the pointer to String if we know the length of the object (in this case 10)</p>

<p>To dig into this issue, I have the following example</p>

<pre><code>let pointerFromString: UnsafePointer&lt;Int8&gt; = ""xyz"".cStringUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)
let stringFromPointer = String.fromCString(anotherPointerFromString_Int8)                    println(stringFromPointer!)
</code></pre>

<p>Given that <code>CChar</code> is an alias of <code>Int8</code>, I can convert a <code>String</code> to <code>UnsafePointer&lt;Int8&gt;</code> using <code>.cStringUsingEncoding()</code>, and then back to <code>String</code> using <code>.fromCString(&lt;UnsafePointer_CChar&gt;)</code> </p>

<p>The problem is that my SQLite result is a <code>UnsafePointer_UInt8</code>, that can´t be used with <code>.fromCString()</code></p>

<p>The bottom line question is: Is it possible to convert or cast a <code>UnsafePointer_UInt8</code> to <code>UnsafePointer_Int8</code></p>

<p>Using phpseclib with a username / password, save these values in a php session and prompt for sudo for every command.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: use root login</strong></p>

<p>Using phpseclib with the root username and password in the login script. In this case you don't have to ask the user for sudo. (not really a safe solution)</p>

<p>Is there some way I could just get the output from the <code>git.exe</code> without hitting a block? Thanks.</p>

For one UseCase, we have to toggle one of the LED's in the device. The LED has number of ""Device Attributes"" and from the Application Layer [.java], we want to read a ""Device Attribute"".</p>

<p>When we do run the cat command on the adb prompt:</p>

<pre><code># cat /sys/devices/device_name/device_attribute
# device_attribute:invalid length
</code></pre>

<p>We get the error ""invalid length"". Hence, I wanted to know is there a way to read a ""Device Property"" such that it is accessible to the App Layer as well.</p>

<p>I found a similar question on another forum <a href=""http://android.modaco.com/topic/312770-possible-solution-for-lack-of-notification-light-developers-needed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://android.modaco.com/topic/312770-possible-solution-for-lack-of-notification-light-developers-needed</a> but it was also unanswered.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies !!!</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>
The device was only having ""set_device_attribute"" but since ""get_device_attribute"" was missing, we were getting ""invalid length"" issue when ""read"" command to that device property was issued.</p>

<p>I added a new API named:</p>

<pre><code>static ssize_t get_device_attribute(struct device *dev, struct device_attribute *attr,
char *buf)
{
 .........................
 .........................
 .........................
}
</code></pre>

<p>and updated the device attribute</p>

<pre><code>static DEVICE_ATTR(device_property, 0777,get_device_attribute, set_device_attribute);

<p>Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).validate({
    success: function(label) {
        var api = $('#' + label.attr(""for"")).qtip(""api"");
        api.updateContent($('#' + label.attr(""for"")).attr(""alt""), true);

<p>So <code>label.attr(""for"")</code> works just fine and returns the id of the target input field. However, when I plug that in to <code>$('#' + label.attr(""for)).attr(""alt"")</code>, it returns undefined even though the alt attribute is defined. Am I missing something or is this something that happens with the jQuery Validation plugin (maybe it removes the alt attribute on-the-fly without me knowing about it?)</p>

<p>Help is greatly appreciated!!!</p>

<p>EDIT: In fact <code>$('#' + label.attr(""for"")).attr(""id"")</code> and <code>attr(""name"")</code> both work as expected too. So it seems it's specifically <code>attr(""alt"")</code> that isn't working. Could qTip be doing something funky (since I think it takes alt as default value for tooltip content)?</p>

<p>UPDATE: More baffling yet... <code>$('#' + label.attr(""for"")).attr(""alt"")</code> DOES NOT WORK, but <code>$('#' + label.attr(""for""))[0].alt</code> DOES WORK. I'm just gonna use that as a solution, but does anyone know WHY???</p>

<p>Now i have a really ugly way of doing it. And it works, But it only works on the desktop and perhaps some scenarios.</p>

<p>If i try to move it in a Game it doesn´t work as intended (Game seems to lock the mouse Position, making the way i move the mouse invalid).</p>

<p>Now here is how i do it.</p>

<pre><code> [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport(""user32.dll"")]
        internal static extern bool SetCursorPos(int x, int y);
        [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport(""user32.dll"")]
        internal static extern void mouse_event(int dwFlags, int dx, int dy, int cButtons, IntPtr dwExtraInfo);
        internal static void mouse_event(int dwFlags, int dx, int dy, int dwData, int dwExtraInfo)
        {
            mouse_event(dwFlags, dx, dy, dwData, (IntPtr)dwExtraInfo);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the imports used (got help with (IntPtr right before)).</p>

<pre><code>    private void MouseListener_MouseMoveExt(object sender, MouseEventExtArgs e)
    {


        if (KeySend.Checked)
        {
            byte[] send_buffer = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(e.Location.ToString());
            udpClientMousePos.Send(send_buffer, send_buffer.Length, otherPartyIP.Address.ToString(), 1400);              
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the mouselistening thread. It sends the position as a string (it´s ugly already).</p>

<p>private void KeyRecieve()
        {</p>

<pre><code>        while (KeyReceive.Checked)
        {  
            byte[] byteData = udpClientMousePos.Receive(ref otherPartyIP);

           string b = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(byteData).Split(',')[0].Replace(""{X="", """");
            string b2 = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(byteData).Split(',')[1].Replace(""Y="", """").Replace(""}"", """"); ;
            NativeMethods.SetCursorPos(Convert.ToInt16(b), Convert.ToInt16(b2));             
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what i do when i receive it.</p>

<p>As you can see, it´s very weird, but it works.</p>

<p>I pretty much, sends the position as a normal text, then i get the X and Y text from it, and set it as the current mouse position, making the mouse move as mine.</p>

<p>Now this as said, works at the desktop just fine, but in Games, it goes mad.</p>

<p>As always, if you find a way to optimize it just tell.</p>

<p>The app seems to have no problem sending simple parameters and receiving complex objects. However, when attempting to send a complex object with my request, it arrives at the server as null. </p>

<p>I never got any marshalling/unmarshalling of complex types in ksoap to work, so basically had a whole lot of SoapObjects and PropertyInfo objects going on, a lot of .getProperty(""propertyname"") etc to step down through the hierarchy. That was ok, a bit tedious to code but it worked fine, so it's all good. But now when I attempt to send a complex object, no data is received with the request at the server. </p>

<p>I put together my request objects by creating a SoapObject, then assigning more SoapObjects as properties of the original one, and more SoapObjects off them, etc, with PropertyInfo objects at the end of the tree. For some reason this seems to no longer work when using ksoap2 version 3. I have tested this, the only difference is the version of ksoap I'm using. Works with 2.6, not with 3.0.</p>

<p>Is there any known reason why this would occur? If necessary I can post code here, but I thought I would ask in case I'm missing something basic. I didn't see anything in the News or Coding Tips &amp; Tricks to suggest why this might happen. </p>

However, <code>PostMessage()</code> is asynchronous, so for example if I try to change the text of an <code>""EDIT""</code> control, I will not be able to delete the text buffer when finished because I do not know when the window procedure will finish processing the message.</p>

<p>So these are two ideas I can think of to access the UI controls from another thread:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a user-defined message, for example, I send to the UI thread something like: ""<em>insert these 200 rows (all stored in one string, delimited by '\n' or something) into <code>ListViewX</code></em>"", and when the UI thread receives this message, it updates <code>ListViewX</code>, and when done, it deletes the string (which is allocated on the heap).</li>
<li>The other approach is to place the code that accesses the UI control inside of a function, and send the function pointer to the UI thread, which will then call it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does one of these approaches provide some advantages over the other, and are there other approaches to do this?</p>

<p>If getters are not allowed how do I verify that the CreatePurchaseOrder() methods functions correctly and sets a value of 1.</p>

<p>This is a big conceptual hurdle to me in trying to implement this design so any advice would be really useful.</p>

I'm fetching a model from the server by passing in a _id that is received as a hidden parameter on the page.</p>

<p>The database MongoDB has stored the data correctly and can be viewed from console as:</p>

<pre><code>{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""50bb82694fbe3de417000001""), ""holiday_name"" : ""SHREE15"", ""description"": """", ""star_rating"" : ""3"", ""holiday_type"" : ""family"", ""rooms"" : ""1"", ""adults"" : ""2"", ""child"" :""0"", ""emails"" : """" }
</code></pre>

<p>The Lithium Model class is so:</p>

<pre><code>class Holidays extends \lithium\data\Model {
public $validates = array(
        'holiday_name' =&gt; array(
                array(
                        'notEmpty',
                        'required' =&gt; true,
                        'message' =&gt; 'Please key-in a holiday name! (eg. Family trip for summer holidays)'
                ))); }
</code></pre>

<p>The backbone Holiday model is so:</p>

<pre><code>    window.app.IHoliday = Backbone.Model.extend({       
    urlRoot: HOLIDAY_URL,
    idAttribute: ""_id"",
    id: ""_id"",
    // Default attributes for the holiday.
    defaults: {
    },

    // Ensure that each todo created has `title`.
    initialize: function(props) {

    },
</code></pre>

<p>The code for backbone/fetch is:</p>

<pre><code>var Holiday = new window.app.IHoliday({ _id: holiday_id });
        Holiday.fetch(
                {
                    success: function(){
                        alert('Holiday fetched:' + JSON.stringify(Holiday));
                        console.log('HOLIDAY Fetched: \n' + JSON.stringify(Holiday));
                        console.log('Holiday name:' + Holiday.get('holiday_name'));
                    }
                }               
           );
</code></pre>

<p>Lithium Controller Code is:</p>

<pre><code>public function load($holiday_id)
{
    $Holiday = Holidays::find($holiday_id);
    return compact('Holiday');
}
</code></pre>

<p>PROBLEM:
The output of the backbone model fetched from server is as below and the Holiday model is not correctly 'formed' when data returns into backbone Model:</p>

<pre><code>    HOLIDAY Fetched: 
{""_id"":""50bb82694fbe3de417000001"",""Holiday"":{""_id"":""50bb82694fbe3de417000001"",""holiday_name"":""SHREE15"",""description"":"""",""star_rating"":""3"",""holiday_type"":""family"",""rooms"":""1"",""adults"":""2"",""child"":""0"",""emails"":""""}}

iplann...view.js (line 68)

Holiday name:undefined
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly there is some issue when the data is passed/translated from Lithium and loaded up as a model into backbone Holiday model. Is there something very obviously wrong in my code?</p>

Each video stream is stored in raw yuv420p format within an AVI container. I have a <strong>Decoder</strong> class from which I create a number of objects within different threads (one object per thread). The two main methods in Decoder are <code>decode()</code> and <code>getNextFrame()</code>, which I provide the implementation for below.</p>

<p>When I separate the decoding logic and use it to decode a single stream, everything works fine. However, when I use the multi-threaded code, I get a segmentation fault and the program crashes within the processing code in the decoding loop. After some investigation, I realized that the data array of the <code>AVFrame</code> filled in <code>getNextFrame()</code> contains addresses which are out of range (according to gdb). </p>

<p>I'm really lost here! I'm not doing anything that would change the contents of the <code>AVFrame</code> in my code. The only place where I attempt to access the AVFrame is when I call <code>sws_scale()</code> to convert the color format and that's where the segmentation fault occurs in the second case because of the corrupt <code>AVFrame</code>. Any suggestion as to why this is happening is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>The problem itself is very simple: I've got a large number of ordered word sequences of arbitrary length kept in a database, something like:</p>

<pre><code>Sequence #0: [ ""word1"", ""word34"", ""word56"", …, ""word_66"" ]
Sequence #1: [ ""word45"", ""word2"", ""word334"", ""word45"", …, ""word_668"" ] 
...
</code></pre>

<p>In the database sequences, the same word might appear more than once.</p>

<p>Given an input word sequence like [""word2"", ""word334""], I'd like to retrieve all the database sequences which contain the input words in the same order they are given.  The only particularity is this: there can be one word (at maximum) allowed between the words of the input.  So, for example, the sequence [""a"", ""a"", ""b"", ""c""] would be a match for the input [""a"", ""c""], ""b"" being a ""skipped word"" in that case.  Let's assume that all the sequences were already written in the database using whatever data model prior to any search being performed; only the query is of interest.</p>

<p>With SQL, this problem is easy enough to solve with a single query into normalized tables. But I'd like to solve the same problem using mongoDb.</p>

<p>First, I tried replicating the tables in mongoDb exactly as I had them in SQL. I figured I'd adapt the queries in the mongo query language as I went.  That didn't work so well, because I found no way of comparing two documents from the same collection within the same find()-- (that was a naive attempt at emulating some kind of JOIN).</p>

<p>Next, I tried grouping the sequence words in an array, in a ""sequence"" document and making sure all the necessary info was available in the same document.  Using the aggregate() pipeline, I tried to see if I could not get away with ""chaining"" a few $match stages.  The best I could do in the $match stage was to filter the sequences that had all the input words in them (using $all), but I could go no further because I could never find the mongoDb way to express ""compare the position of one word in the document's array to the position of another word in the same document's array"" (apparently, you can't put a field on the right hand side of a query comparison operator, even from the same document).</p>

<p>Then I though I could get away with coding a javascript function computing the solution for one document and calling it within a $where stage following the $match. I wasn't successful with this approach either, because I couldn't find a way to pass my input sequence (an array variable) to the $where clause.  I even tried to compose by hand the query string based on the input, so that it contained only resolved constants to run it afterward, but to no avail (apparently, $where doesn't like passing local variables as params, and doesn't like array constants).  I tried uploading the functions to the server, just in case, but I had no luck with that either, restrictions seem to be more or less the same.</p>

<p>At that point, the only thing I can see that could work would be to put all the sequence words in one big string, and use a $regex operator that would perform the match.  That would be a bit ugly, because of the possible ""skipped word"", and very slow because of regex and also because no index could ever be used in that case. I didn't try the full-fledged mapReduce pipeline, but at first glance it seems just like an expansion of the aggregate() and so probably equally unsuited to solve this problem.</p>

<p>I've gone through the documentation a couple times and didn't discover any other ""special feature"" or notion that could help me.  Could someone knowledgeable in MongoDB modelling nudge me toward some efficient approach?  What could be a mongoDb-friendly data model for this? I'm not looking for code as much as some design outline relevant to this specific problem. Thx.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get the Python OpenCV bindings to access an AVT GigE
GC1360H Camera using modules/highgui/src/cap_pvapi.cpp.  I can read
and display frames from the camera flawlessly in C, but when I attempt
to read a frame in Python the interpreter segfaults.  Calling
VideoCapture.open(0) in Python successfully initializes the camera to
Mono8 mode, and watching ifconfig shows data coming in from the
camera.  I can run this same Python code using my v4l webcam instead
of the AVT camera and it works fine.  I am using OpenCV 2.3.1 on
Gentoo Linux 3.2.12 x64. Here is the Python code I am using, running
on Python 2.7.2:</p>

<pre><code>import cv2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cv2.namedWindow(""Cam"", 1)
    capture = cv2.VideoCapture()
    capture.open(0) # This successfully opens the Camera and ifconfig
shows data being transferred
    while True:
        img = capture.read()[1] # This is where it segfaults

        cv2.imshow(""Cam"", img)
        if cv2.waitKey(10) == 27: break

    cv2.destroyWindow(""Cam"")

<p>I attached gdb to the Python interpreter and figured out that it
segfaults on the call to PvCaptureQueueFrame() inside
CvCaptureCAM_PvAPI::grabFrame() in the OpenCV source.  Here is the output from that:</p>

<p>Any insight into this problem would be appreciated.  Ultimately what this question boils down to is why C can call grabFrame() with no problem but Python segfaults.  I am inclined to think the
problem is the way that the Python bindings to C are generated, but I
am not familiar with how OpenCV does this. Any ideas why grabFrame() and PvCaptureQueueFrame() would work fine in C but not in Python?</p>

<p>For reference here is the C program that could successfully read the AVT camera:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;opencv2/imgproc/imgproc_c.h&gt;
#include ""opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp""
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
      printf(""Press ESC to exit\n"");
      cvNamedWindow( ""First Example of PVAPI Integrated"", CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE );
      CvCapture* capture = cvCreateCameraCapture( CV_CAP_PVAPI );
      assert( capture != NULL );

      IplImage* frame;

      while(1)
      {
            frame = cvQueryFrame(capture);

            if(!frame) break;
            cvShowImage( ""First Example of PVAPI Integrated"", frame);
            char c = cvWaitKey(50);
            if( c == 27) break;
      }
      cvReleaseCapture( &amp;capture );
      cvDestroyWindow( ""First Example of PVAPI Integrated"" );

<p>First, i'm doing a little download manager, i list all my downloads in a <strong>listview</strong> element.
My <strong>Listview</strong> (named <code>downloadListXaml</code>) have some <strong>GridViewColumn</strong> binded to a my element (stuff like file name, file size, and a progress bar).
Every download is managed by a <em>separate thread</em>, every thread just update the <strong>progress</strong> value binded to my <strong>ProgressBar</strong>.</p>

<p>In my initial project every thread refreshed the UI on every change to <strong>Progress</strong> but this make the entire UI freeze sometime.
So i maked a separate thread that refresh my <strong>Listview</strong> every 100ms and ONLY if some download thread are active, here the simple code used for refresh:</p>

<pre><code>downloadListXaml.Items.Refresh();
</code></pre>

<p>This works and UI is always responsive, but the progress bar animation just jumps every 100ms to the next value, not good looking at all.</p>

<p>I want to smootly refresh it, and i found some solution, like this: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14485818/how-to-update-a-progress-bar-so-it-increases-smoothly"">How to update a progress bar so it increases smoothly?</a></p>

<p>The problem in that solution is that i need to refeer to my <strong>ProgressBar</strong> xaml element, but i just can access to my <em>object binded</em> to the <strong>ProgressBar</strong>.</p>

<p>So, i think my only solution is solve this <strong>XAML-Side</strong>, attaching an animation to the <code>ValueChanged</code> event of the <strong>ProgressBar</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm really new to XAML and i'm not even sure i can do this. Is this possible? How can i do it? </p>

<p>This is my web.xml file:</p>

this.localUSER_ACT_STRDT_TypeDef=param; } else { throw new java.lang.RuntimeException();
} }

<p>This method always throws RuntimeException because the ConverterUtil.convertToString() method returns a String in a different format than ""yyyy-mm-dd"". It returns the date by appending +5.30 as 2011-03-21+05:30.</p>

<p>I tried passing the date in different formats but same result for all.</p>

<p>Can any one suggest how to resolve this issue.</p>

<pre><code>var MapView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: '.body',
    template: _.template(MapTemplate),
    render: function() {
        ...
    },
    events: {
        'click #log-pane-title': 'loadLogView'
    },
    loadLogView: function() {
        var eventLogView = new EventLogView({
            id: properties._id
        });

        eventLogView.render();
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>And my child view looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var EventLogView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: '#eventlog',
    logform: new NewLogForm({
                template: _.template(AddLogTemplate),
                model: new LogModel()
            }).render(),
    render: function() {
        // Render the form
        $(""#addtolog"").html(this.logform.el);
    },
    events: {
        'submit #addlogentry': 'test'
    },
    test: function() {
        alert('inside eventlogview');
        return false;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm facing is that <code>test()</code> never fires. For debugging purposes I made sure the submit event was even firing by putting: </p>

<pre><code>$('#addlogentry').on('submit', function() { 
    alert( ""submit firing"" ); 
    return false; 
});
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>render()</code> of the <code>EventLogView</code>. That does actually trigger, so I'm not sure what's going on and why <code>test()</code> isn't triggering.</p>

which is called many times. After some fiddling with compiler options I've got
an unexpected 10% performance degradation on Cortex-A57. Presumably it is due to
a little different instruction scheduling. I'd like to investigate the problem
deeper and find out what instruction combination causes unnecessary pipeline
stalls. But I have no idea how I could do that. I guess, I need a very detailed
execution trace to understand what happens, though I'm not sure if it is
possible to get such a trace.</p>

<p>So, the question is: What tools can I use to investigate such low-level
performance problems? How can I determine what prevents the CPU from executing
maximum number of instructions every cycle?</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong> I'm mostly interested in Cortex-A57 cores, but I'd appreciate useful
information on any other core or even a different architecture.</p>

<p><strong>PPS</strong> The function accesses the memory, but it is expected that almost all memory
accesses hit the cache. The assumption is confirmed by <code>perf stat -e r42,r43</code>
(<code>L1D_CACHE_REFILL_LD</code> and <code>L1D_CACHE_REFILL_ST</code> events).</p>

<p>I know that a <code>double</code> has a ""sign bit"" but I'm not sure if the way I'm ""looking for it"" in its binary rep is a good idea or not.</p>

<p>Barring ""portability"" issues, can someone tell me what's going on with this code in MSVC++?</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

{
  double z = 5.0 ;

  __int64 bitSign ;

  __int64 *ptr ;

  ptr = (__int64*)&amp;z ;

    printf( ""Bit# %d (%llx):  %lld\n"",
      sh, bitSign, ( (*ptr) &amp; bitSign) ) ;
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>First, why is starting at bit 32, even though I only shifted by one bit?</p>

<p>Second, is it ok for me to check the 64th bit of a <code>double</code> to check its sign on MSVC++?</p>

<p>This is my config at the moment:</p>

<pre><code>server {
        listen 80;
        return 301;
}

server {

        listen *:5001;

</code></pre>

<p>This almost works as I want it to. I can access my server on port 5001 to hit elasticsearch and must enter credentials as expected.</p>

<p>However, I'm still able to hit :9200 and avoid the HTTP authentication, which defeats the point. How can I prevent access to this port, without restricting nginx? I've tried this:</p>

<pre><code>server {
        listen *:9200;
        return 404;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I get:</p>

<pre><code>nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:9200 failed (98: Address already in use)
</code></pre>

<p>as it conflicts with elasticsearch.</p>

<p>There must be a way to do this! But I can't think of it.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I've edited based on a comment and summarised the question:</p>

<p>I want to lock down &lt; serverip >:9200, and basically only allow access through port 5001 (which is behind HTTP Auth). 5001 should proxy to 127.0.0.1:9200 so that elasticsearch is accessible only through 5001. All other access should 404 (or 301, etc).</p>

<p>Create table statement for how the table currently is (i've change it a number of times!) is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    CREATE TABLE `players` (
      `timestamp` datetime NOT NULL,

      `position` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
      `team` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
      `won` smallint(6) DEFAULT NULL,

    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

<p>innodb_buffer_pool_size has been set to 1GB, still seeing poor performance.  The subquery alone takes 20 seconds to run.  I did an explain on it:</p>

<pre><code>EXPLAIN 
SELECT name, server, Max(timestamp) AS MaxTimeStamp
FROM players_temp
GROUP BY name, server
</code></pre>

<p>result:</p>

<pre><code>1   SIMPLE  players_temp    index       rating2v2   3       265910  Using index; Using temporary; Using filesort

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>I got a bit further by altering the GROUP BY in my subquery.  I changed it from 'GROUP BY name, server' to 'GROUP BY timestamp, server, name' to match the order of the keys and now its using index instead of filesort temporary table, but there is still a problem and it seems to be ordering by score.</p>

<p>If I run this query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM players_temp a
ORDER BY a.score
</code></pre>

<p>it takes 33 seconds to run and EXPLAIN indicates it's using filesort.  There is a BTREE index on score, as indicated by above CREATE statement.  Any ideas?  This is the last hurdle, I believe, to getting the query to run properly. Thanks again</p>

<p>To demonstrate my problem I slightly modified the <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/echo/blocking_tcp_echo_server.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">synchonous tcp echo example</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note: the provided code seems to be working on Windows platforms but i'm having problems on a Linux machine.</em></p>

<p>Let's say the server receives a quit message and now wants to terminate an endless loop which accepts new connections.
Most tutorials etc. recommend you to run acceptor->close() in this case. But as
<a href=""http://boost.2283326.n4.nabble.com/tcp-acceptor-works-differently-on-windows-than-linux-td2587713.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a> states, the results might be undefined if <code>close()</code> is called from another thread.</p>

<p>If you do so, <code>accept()</code> won't terminate this time but when another client tries to connect it returnes an error (on Linux!)</p>

<p>So my question again: how do I correctly terminate a server which is based on <code>boost::asio</code> which continuously synchronously accepts connections?</p>

            boost::system::error_code error;
            size_t length = sock-&gt;read_some(boost::asio::buffer(data), error);
            if (error == boost::asio::error::eof) { break; }
            else if (error) { throw boost::system::system_error(error); }

            if( std::string(""quit"") == data ) {    // TRY TO CANCEL THE ACCEPT
                acceptor-&gt;close();
                break;
            }
            boost::asio::write(*sock, boost::asio::buffer(data, length));
        }
    }
    catch (std::exception&amp; e) { std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""exception in thread: "" &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; ""\n""; }
}

    for (;;) {
        boost::shared_ptr&lt;tcp::socket&gt; sock(new tcp::socket(io_service));
        boost::system::error_code error;
        a.accept( *sock, error );

        if( !error ) {
            boost::thread t( boost::bind( session, sock, &amp;a ) );
        }
        else {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; ""acceptor canceled ""&lt;&lt; error &lt;&lt; std::endl;
            break;
        }
    }
}

        // ..check args here...

        boost::asio::io_service io_service;

    }
    catch (std::exception&amp; e) {std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""Exception: "" &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";}

<ul>
<li>How can you right align text in a container?</li>
<li>How can you concatenate different bits of dynamic data intermixed with static data into a component that needs to line wrap?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a view that I want to render like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sjpv3.png"" alt=""Desired view layout""></p>

<p>Where the ""Seen:"" text is static and right aligned, and the text on the right is a concatenated string with 3 dynamic pieces of text and two pieces of static text.</p>

<p>I have something that works, but it doesn't feel right.</p>

<pre><code>xtype:'container',
    layout:{
    type:'hbox'
},
items:[
    {
        xtype:'container',
        flex:1,
        layout:{
            type:'hbox'
        },
        items:[
            {
                xtype:'spacer',
                layout:'fill'
            },
            {
                xtype:'label',
                layout:'fit',

        html:'[BUILD A STRING AND SET THE HTML HERE]'
    }
]

<p><strong>Right-aligning</strong></p>

<p>So to right-align the text, I basically used an hbox container with a spacer component on the left and a label on the right.  There's got to be an easier way.</p>

<p><strong>Concatenating</strong></p>

<p>I am able to build the string that I want to place on the right, but I'd rather have multiple labels that I can map one-to-one with my model.  It doesn't feel like MVC for me to have to write code to concatenate strings.</p>

<p>I tried breaking apart the right side into an hbox, but there were problems with line wrapping.  Each label wants to render itself individually, so if there were wrapping, it would happen within its own container.</p>

<p>Are there easier ways of doing what I am attempting?</p>

Unfortunately, the tickets table does not have a user_id: it has a user_login (it is a legacy database).  I am going to change that someday, but for now this change would have too many implications.</p>

<p>So how can I build a ""user has_many :tickets"" association through the <strong>login</strong> column?</p>

<p>I tried the following finder_sql, but it does not work.</p>

<pre><code>class User  &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :tickets,
      :finder_sql =&gt; 'select t.* from tickets t where t.user_login=#{login}'
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>I get a weird error:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I also tried this finder_sql (with double quotes around the login):</p>

<pre><code>:finder_sql =&gt; 'select t.* from tickets t where t.user_login=""#{login}""'
</code></pre>

<p>But it fails the same way (and anyway, if it worked it would be vulnerable to sql injection).</p>

<p>In a test database, I added a user_id column in the tickets table, and tried this finder_sql:</p>

<pre><code>:finder_sql =&gt; 'select t.* from tickets t where t.user_login=#{id}'
</code></pre>

<p>Now this works fine.  So apparently, my problem has to do with the fact that the users column I am trying to use is a string, not an id.</p>

<p>I searched the net for quite some time... but could not find a clue.</p>

<p>I would love to be able to pass any parameter to the finder_sql, and write things like this:</p>

<pre><code>has_many :tickets_since_subscription,
:finder_sql =&gt; ['select t.* from tickets t where t.user_login=?'+
     ' and t.created_at&gt;=?', '#{login}', '#{subscription_date}']
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: I cannot use the :foreign_key parameter of the has_many association because my users table <em>does</em> have an id primary key column, used elsewhere in the application.</p>

<p>Edit#2: apparently I did not read the documentation thoroughly enough: the has_many association can take a :primary_key parameter, to specify which column is the local primary key (default id).  Thank you Daniel for opening my eyes!  I guess it answers my original question:</p>

<pre><code>has_many tickets, :primary_key=""login"", :foreign_key=""user_login""
</code></pre>

<p>But I would still love to know how I can make the has_many :tickets_since_subscription association work.</p>

Users are to access the URL of an intranet Tomcat application from their client browsers, the Tomcat application acquires the users' credentials via Kerberos and redirects them to the actual web application.
Our customer's environment is a typical mixture of a Windows AD server acting as the KDC and Linux Tomcat application servers. The SSO functionality is supposed to be used from both Windows and Linux clients. This is what appears to be different from most answers I can find on the net where people have Linux web application servers but only use Windows clients.</p>

<p>Now, in my local setup I get some strange behaviour. My development environment is a Tomcat 7.0.26 running from MyEclipse 8.6 under Windows 7. My test environment is a Tomcat 7.0.26 or 7.0.53 behind an Apache web server on a Centos 6 machine. I have set up the AD server correctly, generated the necessary keytab files etc. and everything is running smoothly in the development environment. I can access the Tomcat application from both Linux and Windows clients using IE and Firefox, Kerberos authentication proceeds and I get redirected properly.</p>

<p>When deploying the Tomcat application on the test server this keeps working when trying to sign on from Windows clients. However, when I try to access the test server from a Linux client (I have tried from Linux Mint 13 and Ubuntu 13.10), I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>javax.servlet.ServletException: GSSException: No credential found for: 1.3.6.1.5.2.51.3.6.1.5.2.5 usage: Accept
      net.sourceforge.spnego.SpnegoHttpFilter.doFilter(SpnegoHttpFilter.java:233)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to admit that I do not properly understand this message. Does it point to a problem with the credentials supplied by the client or a problem with the application server negotiating with the KDC? I have done some research on this problem and have found out that the indicated oid 1.3.6.1.5.2.5 stands for GSS_IAKERB_MECHANISM and not GSS_KRB5_MECHANISM or GSS_SPNEGO_MECHANISM which I find strange. Also, nobody else appears to have exactly the same problem.</p>

<p>I have tried switching from MIT Kerberos to Heimdal Kerberos and back. I have tried Firefox and Chromium, on the application server I have switched between Tomcat 7.0.26 and 7.0.53, the problem still persists. I am using the latest spnego.jar.</p>

<p>Now: Calls from Linux to the Tomcat running on the Windows development machine succeed and calls from Linux clients to the Linux application server fail with the same error message for both browsers tried.</p>

<p>Any ideas on this one?</p>

<p>I have an array (named <code>wordToGuess[]</code>) representing the word that needs to be guessed. I'm comparing it to a masked copy of that word, (named <code>displayString[]</code> - which I know I still to rename for clarity). If <code>wordToGuess[]</code> is, for instance, <code>[S][T][A][C][K]</code>, <code>displayString[]</code> is initialized to <code>[*][*][*][*][*]</code>. As the user guesses a letter, I want to iterate through each character of the array, replacing the <code>*</code> with the letter guess if there's a match. If I guess <code>A</code> (this is the variable <code>letterGuess</code>), for instance, <code>A</code> is compared to every element of the array. If it matches, that element changes to <code>[A]</code>. If it doesn't match, the element remains <code>[*]</code>. The end result in this particular case should be an array populated with <code>[*][*][A][*][*]</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  public char[] drawProgress(char letterGuess, char[] wordToGuess, char[] displayString)
    {
        for (int a = 0; a &lt; wordToGuess.Length; a++)

Here's my problem:

Below is the value of each of these statements displayed on pop up:</p>

<p>We have a drupal 7 site. Our site works fine in all browsers except IE8.  It has to be IE8 on Windows XP...not the similators/emulators.  It seems to work fine in IE7, 9, and 10.  In IE8 it tries to reach our site and then it returns with res://ieframe.dll/acr_error.htm#[http://url.of.site] and fails to load the home page.</p>

<p>Other notes: other pages seem to load just fine if you know the full url.</p>

<p>The home page uses nice menus, flexslider, and jcarousel (v.0.2.8).  I noticed that when I decreased the carousel items so that there are no pagers, it seems to bring it back, at least in our development version. But we need to have more than one page of items, which is the whole point of using jcarousel.</p>

<p>I think I narrowed it down to jcarousel because the site works when I disabled the jcarousel. When I disabled everything else except the jcarousel, it crashes again.</p>

<p>There aren't any bg images to the body. We're running on jquery 1.8.2. I tried uncompressing and compressing all CSS and JS files. I tried changing the meta tag to force IE to emulate other versions. I tried changing the doctype.</p>

<p>Nothing works. And I'm not familiar with debugging in IE (beyond using the F12 developer tools) especially if the page fails to load.</p>

<p>Another odd thing is that I tried to use a different module to accomplish the same effect and it also crashes in IE8.</p>

<p>PHP's mhash function can get a very quick calculation for the adler32 (120MB per second on my dev machine).

This table powers multiple systems, only one of which is a Rails app.  In the Rails app, I want to use the product lookup as an ActiveRecord class with instance members with the product code - for example, the key code field is a 4-digit alphanumeric.  It would be nice to be able to refer to instances by the code like this:  ProductCode.01A3.  I don't want to simply declare them in the Rails code, of course, because the DB is the system of record for multiple systems.  Also, how would Ruby react to a non-existent product code?  If ProductCode.ABCD doesn't exist, does it just silently return a nil, and I'd need nil checks everywhere?  And then there's the issue of releasing a new ProductCode into production.  Updating the table would require reloading the class instance variables.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Can this be done?  Should this be done?  I've searched for a library but maybe my Google-fu isn't that good.</p>

Can I do it in restkit? or has been designed just for reasonable size responses?
I see I can track progress when downloading a large file, even I see I can know when mapping starts or finishes: <a href=""http://restkit.org/api/latest/Protocols/RKMapperOperationDelegate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://restkit.org/api/latest/Protocols/RKMapperOperationDelegate.html</a>
Probably I can also encapsulate the core data operation to avoid blocking the UI.

<p>It was working for about six months (for thousands of users), until about 6 hours ago.
Now, Windows 7 users now get an error that says ""Windows can not open the folder. The Compressed (zipped) Folder: '...filename.zip' is invalid."" This happens regardless of browser used to download. Linux users, etc., can open the delivered files just fine, and so can Win7 users if they have, say, WinRAR. Only Windows Explorer can't open them.</p>

<p><strong>Here's where it gets really weird...</strong> if I make a new copy of my script and remove the various includes that look up the files and decide what to name it, it will download and open just fine... the resulting files from both scripts are identically sized and the resulting name is identical. [Hardcoding the new name into the original script does not help. I kind of thought it might be an encoding issue in the name.] I have tried with a few different zip files with different contents created on different machines by different methods.</p>

<p>The script checks for headers_sent(), file_exists(), and is_readable(). </p>

<p><code>apache_setenv('no-gzip', '1');</code> was added to the scripts (with no effect) following the only semi-relevant info I could find here or elsewhere on the internet. </p>

<p>Clearly, something in the includes is breaking things somehow, but I haven't any idea what to look for... Ideas? (There are about 300 lines of code in the includes... basically, it's an abstract class for database access, a concrete version of that class for the files and all of their cms info, associated images for the site, etc.) </p>

<p><strong>On a whim, I added ""<code>ob_clean();</code> right before the <code>readfile($file);</code>... it fixed it. So my question now, is: why? Error reporting is off in all of the files. What else could send output but not headers? And why the ""sudden"" change in behaivor?</strong></p>

<p>Now the console output from these is what I expect:</p>

[[""waiting""]]
Event type: waiting
>>> CALLING HOOK waiting
[[""gotMessage"", ""77564""]]
Event type: gotMessage
$VAR1 = '77564';
>>> CALLING HOOK msgRx
New message: 77564
[[""idle""]]
Event type: idle
>>> CALLING HOOK typing
[[""gotMessage"", ""816523""]]
Event type: gotMessage
$VAR1 = '816523';
>>> CALLING HOOK msgRx
New message: 816523
>> User ending connection
null
>>> CALLING HOOK end</pre>

<p>However, the GUI TextView does not update. I can only presume that this is because the callback is actually happening in another thread, which has duplicates of the objects.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>1) Can i receive this document, while 'embedded' list will be ordered by inner ordering using pure mongo.db shell?</p>

<p>2) If answer is yes can same be done with mongoalchemy?</p>

<p>3) Meanwhile, i did not find answer for first question, so I pre-sort by ordering in python before insertion into mongodb. When i retreive document it still in right order.
But can i rely on it, will it be for sure in same order when database will grow?</p>

I realized that a have quite a few tables which never change.  They are static, no insert or updates can ever occur on these tables, and so can be considered immutable.  All accesses to these tables are via lazy loading (can be made eager) of entity collections and hql queries.</p>

<p>I'm wondering for such a case what would be the best approach performance-wise for handling such a scenario.  I have the basics in place, read only ehcache, query caching and the transactions set to read-only (does this do anything at all for Mysql?).  What other things can I look at?  Which ISOLATION modes, PROPAGATION modes are best?  Should I be looking at other caching solutions?  Or should I simply do away with all this and just load the data once into a series of hashmaps (this hopefully will be a last resort)?</p>

<p>Another possible (far-fetched?) solution would be to have some in-memory/no-transaction database and have hibernate connect to it.  Do such db engines exist?</p>

<p>2) create S3 bucket - done</p>

<p>3) <strong>grant read and write permission to the user created in the previous step</strong> - how???</p>

<p>4) I then run this three commands: </p>

$ heroku config:set S3_SECRET_KEY=oloalle
$ heroku config:set S3_BUCKET=name of bucket

<p>5) push to git and heroku - done</p>

<p>6) <code>heroku pg:reset DATABASE</code> - done</p>

If the user tap on an item of the <code>ArrayAdapter</code> it will open an extension of an <code>AlertDialog</code>. If the user taps on a button in this <code>AlertDialog</code> a dataset in the database will be deleted among others and the <code>AlertDialog</code> is <code>dismiss()</code>. Now I want to refresh the view of the <code>ArrayAdapter</code>.</p>

<p>I found solutions like </p>

<pre><code>remove(position);

</code></pre>

<p>But where could I call this? Can I pass a boolean from the <code>AlertDialog</code> backwards to the <code>ArrayAdapter</code> if the user clicked on the specific button to say ""hey adapter, please remove the current item in your list""?</p>

<p>here's some code:</p>

<p>Activity:</p>

<p>MyAdapter:</p>

<pre><code>public View getView(int position, View row, ViewGroup parent) {
    if(row != null) {
        row.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {

                myDialog.show();
            }
        });
    }

<p>MyDialog:</p>

<pre><code>protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    Button btn_delete = (Button) findViewById(R.id.btn_delete);
    btn_delete.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {

&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that IE memory keeps pilling up as radio buttons are clicked to load pages and after loading few pages browsers stops responding.
I can see the memory going up in task manager.</p>

<p>The application runs in IE 5,6,7,8,9 and in quirks mode in IE10. I tried to replicate the same scenario in chrome and it showed no problem. So I think it is IE specific memory management related problem.</p>

<p>I read many articles but I was not convinced.I also read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161988/jquery-load-method-memory-leak?rq=1"">this</a> question on SO but it suggests to load only some part of page which is not acceptable in my case.This <a href=""http://javascript.info/tutorial/memory-leaks"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> seems relevant but I am not sure what exactly causes memory leak in my case.</p>

<p><strong>The entire body above is actually in a iframe</strong> . So as a workaround I reload the 
frame with the main page containing  after 8 clicks of radio button.
I have tried to clear stuffs before each load using:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#loadPages"").empty();

$(""#loadPages"").find(""*"").off();

$.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });
</code></pre>

<p>But nothing works.So I doubt whether jquery can clear events registered through htc.</p>

<p>1) <strong>It would be great if you explain the reason of memory leak</strong> in this case.</p>

<p>2) And in general why memory leak can occur in a browser after loading many resources. This does not happen in modern browsers but why it occurred in older browsers. </p>

<p>3) Is there a way to release browsers memory without refreshing the frame.</p>

<p>4)Is there a way to check what all resources are residing in a browsers memory.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the <code>System.Threading.ThreadPool</code>.   </li>
<li>Using a custom delegate and calling its <code>BeginInvoke</code> method.  </li>
<li>Using custom threads with the aid of <code>System.Threading.Thread</code> class.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two methods offer a quick way to fire off worker threads for your application. But unfortunately, they hurt the overall performance of your application since they <strong>consume threads from the same pool used by ASP.NET to handle HTTP requests</strong>.</p>

<p>Then I wanted to use a new Task or async/await to write <code>IHttpAsyncHandler</code>. One example you can find is what Drew Marsh explains here : <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/6389323/261950"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/6389323/261950</a></p>

<p>My guess is that using Task or async/await still consume the thread from the ASP.NET thread pool and I don't want for the obvious reason.</p>

<p>Could you please tell me <strong>if I can use Task (async/await) on the background thread</strong> like with <code>System.Threading.Thread</code> class <strong>and not from thread pool</strong> ?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0hj1c.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I want to make a site that allows a user to add to a collection, then favorite with the click on a checkbox, and I want to add another checkbox to delete a gemstone if needed. I'm having problems with my checkbox that adds to the favorites table, how to delete, and adding to a collection. I'm looking for corrections, resources that could help me and psuedo code, but if I haven't given enough info let me know!</p>

<p>So this is my object-oriented favorites checkbox. Right now, the checkboxes are there but they're not functioning. There's some jQuery in there that is supposed to stop the user from faving more than 10. I look at this and it makes sense to me so kind of hard to see where I'm going wrong. </p>

<pre><code>    $username = $_SESSION['USERNAME']; 
    if(isset($_POST['submit'])){//to run PHP script on submit
        if(!empty($_POST['favorites'])){ 
        // Loop to store and display values of individual checked checkbox.
            foreach($_POST['favorites'] as $selected){
                if($_POST['checkbox']==0)
                $_POST['checkbox'] = '';
                $query= ""UPDATE u_collection SET fav = 0 WHERE username ='"".$username.""'""; 
                mysqli_query($db,$query);
                echo 'test';
            }
        } 
    } 
    if(isset($_POST['Collection'])){
    $query= ""UPDATE u_collection SET gem = '"".$i-&gt;name.""' WHERE username ='"".$username.""'""; 
    mysqli_query($db,$query);
    }

foreach($gems as $i){
    echo '&lt;tr&gt; 
    &lt;th&gt;'.$i-&gt;name.'&lt;/th&gt; 
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;form action=""userhome.php"" method=""post""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""checkbox""'; 
    if(!empty($i-&gt;fav)){
        echo ' checked = ""checked"" ';         
    }
    echo 'name=""favorites[]"" value='.$i-&gt;name.'&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/form&gt;'; 
}

&lt;script src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    $('form input[type=checkbox]').on('click', function(){
        if ($('form input[type=checkbox]:checked').length &gt; 10)
        {
           $(this).removeAttr('checked');
           alert('You are only allowed to select 10 checkboxes');
        }
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the collection is really bothering me because I know it's simplifier than the previous problem, but my brain's drawing a blank. This is the code that is seen on the side, and there's a button that is to add to the user's collection. I'm trying to figure how I would do that with this object oriented variable, I'm assuming? I also need to add a delete button in the collection.</p>

<pre><code>foreach($gemInfo as $i){
echo('
    &lt;tr&gt;  
        &lt;th&gt;
            &lt;img src='.$i-&gt;image.'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;form action=""userhome.php"" method=""post""&gt;
                &lt;input type=""hidden"" value="".'$i-&gt;name'.""&gt;
                &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""Collection"" value=""+ Collection"" /&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;'.$i-&gt;name.'&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    //rest of table'
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is my first attempt at adding to the user's collection. It looks way wrong. I know I need to check the user's gems to see if it's already there, and it needs to be added to that user's part of the database, via session as used, but it doesn't make sense. </p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_GET['name'])){
    $usql = ""SELECT gem FROM gems WHERE gem = '"".name.""';"";
    $ures =mysqli_query($db, $usql) or die(mysqli_error($db) .""&lt;br&gt;"".$usql);
    $urow = mysqli_fetch_assoc($ures);
    $d = $urow['gem'];
    if(isset($_GET['name']) &amp;&amp; $_GET['name'] == 'add'){
        //check to see if already added
        $fchksql = ""SELECT gem FROM u_collection WHERE username ='"".$_SESSION['USERNAME'].""'"";
        $fchkres =mysqli_query($db, $fchksql) or die(mysqli_error($db));
        $fr = mysqli_fetch_assoc($fchkres);
        $numrows = mysqli_num_rows($fchkres);
        if($numrows &lt; 1){
        $afsql = ""INSERT INTO u_collection(gem) values('"".$_SESSION['USERNAME'].""','"".$_GET['name'].""',now());"";
        mysqli_query($db, $afsql) or die(mysqli_error($db) .""&lt;br&gt;"".$afsql);
        header(""Location: "".$config_basedir.""userprofile.php?u="".name);
        }//end if
</code></pre>

<p>Also, when adding, it becomes an array. How would you delete from an array or is that simpler than I thought?</p>

Using the variable names, <code>u</code> and <code>c</code>, the url looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>www.originalwebsite.com/user.php?u=username&amp;c=43
</code></pre>

<p>I want a user-defined custom domain to remove any evidence of a username variable or variable name. Other variables (like category) are fine to remain. Ideally, this would result in the following link pointing to the one included before:</p>

<pre><code>www.customdomain.com/c=43
</code></pre>

<p>My reasons being that the custom domain would be unique for the user and, therefore, would be remove the need to specify the user (in theory, not in practice so far) as well as presenting the site from a custom domain in a manner that looks like a single site, rather than the portal like options of the original.</p>

<p>I can get <code>www.customdomain.com/u=username&amp;c=43</code> to work but am trying to think of the best method to remove reference to the username when using the custom domain (both the variable identifier and the variable itself). I'm struggling to think of how I'll inform the original website of what user account to use if it's not mentioned in the url itself.</p>

<p>At the moment my best idea is to let <code>user.php</code> handle this with a condition of whether the request is from <em>originalwebsite.com</em> or a custom domain. If finds that it's the latter, it checks it against a database listing and finds the relevant user settings discreetly. This feels like quite a slow procedure, however.</p>

<p>If my example is not clear, think of sites like Tumblr, where you can add a custom domain and, from that point on, urls make no reference of your user name.</p>

<p>Hi all, and again... thank you for your kind guidance.
Firstly, I would like to apologize as i'm quite new to this...
I've moved forward slightly but stuck on the last part and not sure how to proceed.</p>

<p>So the form now validates the form elements and checks the email to see if it exists.
The only issue I have left is if the email value is ok, the form does not process.
Is there a way to set submit value to true with the ajax callback function?</p>

if (x==null || x=="""") 
  {

  return false;
  }

  //more validation.....

//Check if username exists.

         } ,

          { 

            var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(data);

            if (obj.email_exists == 1) 
              {   
                $(""#form_status"").fadeIn(""slow"");

<p>After a redirect if i hit the Back button on my browser i go back in the old page and bounced forward again. Hitting back again works (with Chrome).
With Internet Explorer no problem, just 1 back works fine.
Firefox and opera bounces me endless times!</p>

<p>I tried to erase the script after execution, so i used this (without any newline):</p>

<pre><code>ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(Me.GetType(), ""redirector"",

The API returns data in the JSON format and I have successfully parsed this to HTML using jQuery. Each event result has a form in it so the user can save a result to view later. My problem is with creating the individual click handlers for each form that gets created. Currently each form gets its own unique id but my ajax function is called by the submit button class which is obviously the same for all the forms in the search results.

<p>$(#'0,#1,#2,#3').click(function() { </p>

This excel VBA macro is supposed to read data off an excel spreadsheet and perform certain actions based on what it finds.</p>

<p>I have two custom classes at work. cSample and cSampledReg. cSamledReg a SampledReg is a company who has submitted laboraty samples for testing and a Sample is one of the samples in question. cSample essentially contains the following variables each with get and let properties:</p>

<pre><code>Private pSampName As String
Private pColDate As String
Private pSubDate As String
Private pCertLab As String
Private pFeedProd As String
Private pIndex As Integer
Private pAnalysisArr() As String
'''''''''END VARIABLES'''''''''''''''''''''''''
</code></pre>

<p>cSamples additionally has the following subs</p>

<pre><code>'''Redimension the pAnalysisArr()
Public Sub redimArr(i2 As Integer)
   ReDim pAnalysisArr(1 To i2)
   pIndex = 1
End Sub

'Add values to the pAnalysisArr()
 Public Sub addAnalysis(value As String)
    pAnalysisArr(pIndex) = value
   pIndex = pIndex + 1
 End Sub

 Public Property Get RtnAnalysis(myIndex As Integer) As String
        RtnAnalysis = pAnalysisArr(myIndex)
 End Property
</code></pre>

<p>cSampledReg has a ton of variables but only 3 are relevant at this stage in the code:</p>

<pre><code>Private pZNum As String
Private pIndex As Integer
Private pSamplesArr() As cSample
''''''
</code></pre>

<p>It has these subs</p>

<pre><code>'''REDIMENSION SAMPLES ARRAY
Public Sub redimArr(size As Integer)
    ReDim pSamplesArr(1 To size)
End Sub
'''END SAMPLES ARRAY REDIMENSIONING

Public Sub addSample(thisSample As cSample)
 Set pSamplesArr(myIndex) = thisSample

 Dim i3 As Integer

 For i3 = 1 To myIndex
     MsgBox (pSamplesArr(i3).sampName &amp; vbNewLine &amp; pSamplesArr(i3).feedProd)
 Next i3

End Sub

 Public Property Get RtnSample(thisIndex As Integer) As cSample
     Set RtnSample = pSamplesArr(thisIndex)
 End Property
</code></pre>

<p>I have the for I3 loop there to test this issue I was getting. What is supposed to happen is that when the macro runs into a company's registration number it creates a cSampledReg object and then loops through the next lines of code creating cSample object when it finds a sample and THEN loading each sample with a bunch of analyses. Analysses don't need their own classes because they are just simple strings.</p>

<p>This program seems to be working at 90%. It correctly creates a cSampledReg object, correctly creates a cSample object when it runs into a sample and correctly loads the cSample object with as many analysis as it finds. HOWEVER, it seems that it loads the last sample of a company's list as the value for ALL of the company's samples. </p>

<p>I honestly do not understand why it does this. When I tested the I3 loop I found this out the hard way that this was the issue. Everytime it runs the addSamples sub in the cSampledReg class it will be correct the first time, the second time it will wrongly tell me that it has two samlples both of the second samples' name, and the third time it will wrongly tell me it has three samples each with the third samples name.</p>

I've followed the <a href=""http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages"">tutorial on using NuGet without committing packages</a> with some success. After working around <a href=""http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/1879"">this NuGet issue</a> by manually adding <code>&lt;RestorePackages&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;Import ...&gt;</code> for the nuget.targets file things were working.</p>

<p>However, once I cloned the repository with Mercurial, I got the following error when building:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unable to locate 'C:\...\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\MyProject\.nuget\nuget.exe'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes sense, because my ignore pattern prevented me from checking in the exe file. From <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/10111441/419956"">this related SO question</a> I inferred that it's not uncommon to have this file in version control (or is it?), but really I'd <strong>prefer not to commit NuGet.exe to version control</strong> if I can help it.</p>

<hr>

<p><em><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a convenient way to prevent needing to check in NuGet.exe?</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I've tried some Google-fu, skimming the documentation, and fiddling with the NuGet.targets file, no luck so far. It seems preferable if I could just dynamically point to the NuGet.exe of the particular environment that's building the solution.</p>

<p>I know I could just add the exe file, but I'd prefer to know if there are other ways to handle this or know why there are no viable alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
The nuget.targets file holds some relevant xml:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;!-- only (relevant) parts of the xml shown below --&gt;

<p>I'm unfamiliar with the workings of .targets files, but this seems to be along the lines of what I'm looking for.

<p>which mentions how to calculate moving average using Hadoop. </p>

<p>Please notice that all the records for a KEY should be sorted and then reduced. Now assume that the records for a particular KEY are spread across all the shards of Mongo cluster. In such case, would it be possible to calculate the moving average? </p>

<p>I understand that Mongo does the map reduce at each node. The prime requirement to solve this problem is to make sure all the emits for a map be reduced in a single reduce phase. If that's the case, then Mongo Map Reduce will never be able to solve such problems. Is there some basic misunderstanding?</p>

<p>Also, with billions of rows, and petabytes of data, why is it that Hadoop Reduce phase doesn't crash out of memory, since it has to deal with at least several TBs of mapped data.</p>

<p>and I would like to alter this set of numbers via a loop and copy the new numbers into a different sheet so that my formulas on that sheet can calculate whatever I need them to calculate. For example, the first couple of iterations might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>1st
20,000 x 1.001
25,000 x 1
27,000 x 1

<p>Can anyone explain the math behind this and also how I would use a loop to accomplish my goal?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I'm already running a script to cleanup file's older X-Days in my recordings... But I recognized that</p>

<pre><code>find /media/hdd/Serien/my_fav_series/ -mtime +5
</code></pre>

<p>is not as efficient enough, some of the four to six file's one recording generates have a different age... And I want to asure that I'll have always a few recordings left, even if those are older than X days!</p>

<p>So here's what I've got so far:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

DIR=$1
TS=$2
REC=$((TS * 6))
RECS=$((TS + 1))
FILES=$(ls /media/hdd/Serien/$DIR/|egrep '\.ts$'|wc -l)
DATE=$(date +""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"")

if [ $FILES -gt $TS ];
then

ls -ct /media/hdd/Serien/$DIR/|egrep '\.ts$'|tail -n+$TS &gt; /tmp/del.lst

cd /media/hdd/Serien/$DIR

#cat /tmp/del.lst|xargs -0 rm
while IFS= read -r file
do
rm -- ""$file""
done &lt; /tmp/del.lst

cd -
rm /tmp/del.lst

echo ""$DATE - $DIR - Saved the $RECS newest records &amp; deleted older records in folder"" &gt;&gt; /media/hdd/backup/cleanup.log
else
echo ""$DATE - $DIR - Less then $TS records in folder"" &gt;&gt; /media/hdd/backup/cleanup.log
fi
</code></pre>

<p>It work's as expected, and delete's oldest *.TS files, while keeping an amount given via parameter...</p>

<p>But it is not yet as intelligent as I want it to be! What I still need is an addition that delete's all the leftover's. By leftover's I mean the other not that space consuming part's of the records:</p>

<pre><code>20121221 1628 - ProSieben HD - How I Met Your Mother.ts
20121221 1628 - ProSieben HD - How I Met Your Mother.ts.ap
20121221 1628 - ProSieben HD - How I Met Your Mother.ts.cuts
20121221 1628 - ProSieben HD - How I Met Your Mother.ts.sc
</code></pre>

<p>After this will be cleaned I'll have the *.AP, *.CUTS, *.SC and maybe a *.META left in the dir. And I don't know how to write a function that will delete all file's that don't have a corresponding *.TS with em...</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<pre><code>ls -ct /media/hdd/Serien/How_I_met_your_mother/

20130102 1600 - ProSieben HD - How I Met Your Mother.ts.meta
20130102 1600 - ProSieben HD - How I Met Your Mother.ts

20130102 1114 - ProSieben HD - How I Met Your Mother.eit
</code></pre>

<p>The first six line's of  the ""ls -ct"" output show a complete not yet cleaned recording. The second set only showing 5 files is the leftovers from an already deleted record.</p>

<p>What I need is a function that recognise's that first date &amp; time pattern and sort's those in a group and then check's if that group contains a *.TS file and if it doesn't delete's the rest of the group.</p>

<p>I hope you can help.</p>

I'm writing an application with multiple threads; I know that when a variable is shared between two or more threads, it is better to lock/unlock using a mutex to avoid deadlock and inconsistency of variables. This is very clear when I want to change or view one variable.</p>

<pre><code>int i = 0; /** Global */
static pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

/** Thread 1. */
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);
i++;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mutex);

/** Thread 2. */
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);
i++;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mutex);
</code></pre>

<p>This is correct, I think. The variable <code>i</code>, at the end of the executions, contains the integer <code>2</code>.<br>
Anyway, there are some situations in which I don't know exactly where to put the two function calls.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you have a function <code>obtain()</code>, which returns a global variable. I need to call that function from within the two threads. I have also two other threads that call the function <code>set()</code>, defined with a few arguments; this function will set the same global variable. The two functions are necessary when you need to do something before getting/setting the var.</p>

<pre><code>/** (0) */
/** Thread 1, or 2, or 3... */
if(obtain() == something) {

    if(obtain() == somethingElse) {
        // Do this, sometimes obtain() and sometimes set(random number) (1)   
    } else {
        // Do that, just obtain(). (2)
    }

} else {
    // Do this and do that (3)
    // If # of thread * 3 &gt; 10, then set(3*10) For example. (4)
}
/** (5) */
</code></pre>

<p>Where I have to lock, and where I have to unlock? 
The situation can be, I think, even more complex. I will appreciate an exhaustive answer.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is to display a bunch of photos in a grid in a GUI constructed using PySide API. Further, when a user clicks on a photo, I want to be able to display the information corresponding to that photo. Additionally, I would like the container/widget used for displaying the photo to allow for the photo to be changed e.g. I should be able to replace any photo in the grid without causing the entire grid of photos to be created from scratch again.  </p>

<p>Initially I tried to use QLabel to display a QPixmap but I realized (whether mistakenly or not) that I have no way to detect mouse clicks on the label. After some searching, I got the impression that I should subclass QLabel (or some other relevant class) and somehow override QWidget's(QLabel's parent class) mousePressEvent() to enable mouse click detection. Problem is I'm not sure how to do that or whether there is any alternative widget I can use to contain my photos other than the QLabel without having to go through subclass customization.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a more suitable container other than QLabel to display photos while allowing me to detect mouse clicks on the photo or provide some code snippet for subclassing QLabel to enable it to detect mouse clicks?</p>

With a version control system though, would that be stored on a seperate server? Or is it possible to store it locally?  I'm more just concerned that I will just seriously mess up my code and not be able to undo it at some point...</p>

<p>I started with the basic behavior, where each thread think(), getForks(), eat(), and putForks(). So there's no prevention of deadlocks or starvation (done on purpose).</p>

<p>The getForks() method works like this:</p>

<pre><code>getForks(){
    while(forks[rightFork]==0) /*0 means fork is not on the table, so wait*/
         print(Thread #id waiting for right fork);
    forks[rightFork] = 0;
    while(forks[leftFork]==0)
         print(Thread #id waiting for left fork);
    forks[leftFork = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I put a sleep(5000) between getting the right and the left fork, so the program is running into a deadlock (with each thread holding the right fork). What is unexpected, however, is that for some reason execution is halting once it reaches the deadlock. I expected that the ""Thread #id waiting for fork"" messages would keep being printed during the deadlock, but they are not. Once deadlock is reached no more messages are printed.</p>

<p>In the book rule is given to subtract two no. </p>

<p><strong>Rule :</strong>  to subtract two no X and Y , that is X - Y , <strong>form 2's complement of no. Y</strong> and add it to X.</p>

<p>Suppose we have to subtract  two no. (-7) and (-5), then according to rule, we need to find 2's complement of the no (-5), and then add it to (-7).</p>

<p>Suppose, there are 3 images. There are point correspondences between image 1-2 and image 2-3, but there's no common point between image 1 and 3. I got the RT (rotation and translation matrix) of image 2, RT12, with respect to image 1(considering image 1 RT as [I|0], that means, rotation is identity, translation is zero). Lets split  RT12 into R12 and T12.</p>

<p>Similarly, I got RT23 considering image 2 RT as [I|0]. So, now I have R23 and T23, who are related to image 2, but not image 1. Now I want to find R13 and T13.</p>

<p>For a synthetic dataset, the equation R13=R23*R12 is giving correct R(verified, as I actually have the R13 precalculated). Similary T13 should be T2+T1. But the translation computed this way is bad. Since I have actual results with me, I could verify that Rotation was estimated nicely, but not translation. Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult GetAccount(int id)
{
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I want to return a <code>404</code> if say urls such as these are encountered:</p>

<pre>
/GetAccount
/GetAccount/notanumber
</pre>

<p>i.e. I want to trap the <code>ArgumentException</code> that is thrown.</p>

<p>I know I could use a nullable type:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult GetAccount(int? id)
{
  if(id == null) throw new HttpException(404, ""Not found"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that's pretty icky and repetitious.</p>

<p>I was hoping I could add this to my controllers where necessary:</p>

<pre><code>[HandleError(View=""Error404"", ExceptionType = typeof(ArgumentException))]
public class AccountsController : Controller
{
  public ActionResult GetAccount(int id)
  {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't appear to work well.</p>

<p>I saw <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/619895"">this post</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/619895/how-can-i-properly-handle-404-in-asp-net-mvc/2577095#2577095"">this answer</a> which nearly solves my problem:</p>

<p>In that answer an abstract <em>BaseController</em> is created from which you derive all your other controllers from:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class MyController : Controller
{
    #region Http404 handling

    protected override void HandleUnknownAction(string actionName)
    {
        // If controller is ErrorController dont 'nest' exceptions
        if (this.GetType() != typeof(ErrorController))
            this.InvokeHttp404(HttpContext);
    }

    public ActionResult InvokeHttp404(HttpContextBase httpContext)
    {
        IController errorController = ObjectFactory.GetInstance&lt;ErrorController&gt;();
        var errorRoute = new RouteData();
        errorRoute.Values.Add(""controller"", ""Error"");
        errorRoute.Values.Add(""action"", ""Http404"");
        errorRoute.Values.Add(""url"", httpContext.Request.Url.OriginalString);
        errorController.Execute(new RequestContext(
             httpContext, errorRoute));

        return new EmptyResult();
    }

    #endregion
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works great at handling unknown actions with a <code>404</code> but doesn't allow me to handle invalid data as a <code>404</code>.</p>

<p>Can I safely override <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.controller.onexception.aspx""><code>Controller.OnException(ExceptionContext filterContext)</code></a> like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnException(ExceptionContext filterContext)
{
  if(filterContext.Exception.GetType() == typeof(ArgumentException))
  {
    filterContext.ExceptionHandled = true;
    this.InvokeHttp404(filterContext.HttpContext);
  }
  else
  {
    base.OnException(filterContext);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>On the surface it seems to work, but am I storing up any problems by doing this?</p>

<p>Is this semantically correct thing to do?</p>

In addition to the relationship, I also only want to get a category if one of it's date properties is not null.</p>

Here is one of the samples I have previously attempted:</p>

<pre><code>var selectQuery =

Found a solution for my problem, but can't self-answer for another 7 hours.</p>

<p>I had partially been experiencing some issues on an earlier syntax, I assumed that when using <code>x.All</code> the values wouldn't return any match if the set was empty.</p>

<p>Here is what solved it for me:</p>

<pre><code>var selectQuery =
   (from statementDetail in pcardDatabaseContext.PCardStatementDetails

    &amp;&amp; statementDetail.PCardTransactions.All(txn =&gt; txn.TransactionStatusID == txnStatusAccountingApproved)
    &amp;&amp; statementDetail.PCardTransactions.Any()
    orderby statementDetail.ExportedDate
    select statementDetail) as IOrderedQueryable&lt;PCardStatementDetail&gt;;

<p>I have a <code>UITableView</code> in iOS (we are developing using Xamarin c#) where selecting a row will deserialise a view coming from the server before displaying it. This works fine on my iPad mini Retina with no problems and the same on the simulator. However, users with iPad 3 or below have a huge delay waiting for the deserialiser to finish its job. We have optimised it the best that we can but we still have a delay.</p>

<p>This delay allows users to tap the row multiple times (thinking it is not doing anything) which causes the processing to happen multiple times and then multiple instances of the deserialised view to appear on the stack which causes a navigation error and the app to crash when trying to navigate back down the stack.</p>

<p>My question is, is there a way to stop row click events being processed for that particular row after the first press until we have navigated back to that controller? I have tried using the WillSelectRow and a class variable bool (quick example below)</p>

<pre><code>bool isProcessing = false;
    public override NSIndexPath WillSelectRow (UITableView tableView, NSIndexPath indexPath)
    {
        if(!isProcessing)
            return indexPath;
        return null;
    }

    public override void RowSelected (UITableView tableView, NSIndexPath indexPath)
    {
        isProcessing = true;            

        var data = GetDataAt(indexPath);

        ProcessRowSelection(tableView, indexPath, data);

        isProcessing = false;

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is, when i have tried this approach, it doesn't stop the second tap from being registered as it fires the entire execution for the first tap before starting the second so essentially, the boolean never traps it.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be kindly appreciated!</p>

<p>We have a WPF application (3.5) that is used by multiple users.  Persistence is done from the application (via NHibernate) to the database.  Up until now, users would periodically refresh there view's in order to ensure they had the latest updates.  However, we now want to send notification to each application instance when an entity is persisted using pub/sub messaging.  The client applications are all run within the same domain and should be able to fulfill most dependencies required (e.g. installation of MSMQ on client machines).</p>

<p>To summarize: Client1 publishes an update message ---> ????? ---->  All other active clients receive it.</p>

<p>As I am new to MSMQ, I'm not even sure what the architecture should look like.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does each client machine need to have a local MSMQ queue to receive messages?</li>
<li>Do we just need to create a queue on a server and all clients listen for messages there?  If so, will just a queue(s) suffice or do we need to create a service in order to distribute the messages correctly?</li>
<li>Is this even the right tool for the job?</li>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Just in case anyone is interested we ended up splitting our ""Event Bus"" into two.  For the server, we are using MassTransit.  However, because Mass Transit requires ""full profile"" (.NET 4.0) and we wanted to stick with ""client profile"" for our WPF instances we are using SignalR for the client side event bus.  An ""observer"" on the server event bus forwards messages to the client event bus.</p>

I was using Iframes but now I decided to integrate it into my .tpl file. For the life of me I can't figure out how to include a custom js file in the .tpl The way other files are included is in a php file but this is just to include the config file. I managed to put the HTML in the .tpl fine, the last part I need is the javascript. I believe the issue is that the JS is uses Jquery so I need to include that library but I can't seem to make it work. Any ideas? I've used literal and that didn't work either....</p>

<p>I see a related question <a href=""http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en/Offtopic/thread/052e8b93-0a76-4fe1-b678-d63df8101fac"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, which suggests the problem is with the <code>PrincipalContext</code>, but no answer</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Got it working..... I restarted our production server because we needed to have this working for someone important within the next hour, and I thought since it that previous link suggested that a reboot would get a single login in that I would just reboot and login with the login needed to get it working for now, and after rebooting everything works absolutely perfectly. I spent most of yesterday, staying late, and all of this morning trying to figure this out. We're not supposed to reboot our web server, but it was important to get this working so I did it anyways, and now everything works the way it should.</p>

<p>I would still like to know what its problem was though. My best guess is that something caused the <code>PrincipalContext</code> to not dispose correctly, which was preventing me from logging in with any other set of credentials.</p>

<h1>SOLVED!</h1>

<p>Yuppie! I solved myself! my misunderstood. This middleware was preceded by another one. The first one, like this, had a wrong:
 <strong>return self.orig_func(request, *args, **kwargs)</strong></p>

<p>it should be replaced by <strong>return None</strong></p>

<p>because of the logic of the middlewares works with. In fact middleware are executed in sequence and <strong>return None</strong> when all the test passes, or an <strong>HttpResponse</strong> when you need to modify the normal execution of the invoked url. It was well explained in

<pre><code>syms a11 a12 a21 a22;
A = [a11 a12; a21 a22];
</code></pre>

<p>or using compact syntax as</p>

<pre><code>A = sym('A%d', [2 2]);
</code></pre>

<p>However i don't see how any of these syntax's should allow dynamic initialization. I would like to initialize each matrix element individually using two loops. One shot at a possible syntax (it's NOT valid MATLAB syntax) could be</p>

<pre><code>syms a x1;
P = sym(zeros(n,n));
for l = 1:n
   for m = 1:n
      kl = l; km = m;
      P(l,m)(x1) = a*sin(kl*x1)*sin(km*x1);
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>where I used the (invalid) syntax P(l,m)(x1) to specify that each element in P is a function of x1. Hence P(2) would be an (n,n) matrix with elements P(l,m) = a*sin(kl*2)*sin(km*2). I know it's possible to construct the P by building the matrix string (A=[...]) on run time and evaluating using <strong>eval</strong>. Something like</p>

<pre><code>syms a x1;
command = [];
for i = 1:n
    for j = 1:n
        kl = i; km = j;
        command = [command ' + a*sin(' num2str(kl) '*x1)*sin(' num2str(km) '*x1)'];
        if(j &lt; n) command = [command ',']; end
    end
    if(i &lt; n) command = [command ';']; end
end
eval(['P(x1) = [' command '];'])
</code></pre>

<p>However, using <strong>eval</strong> is bad practice, so I see this solution only as a last resort. Is there any <em>correct</em> way to achieve my goal?</p>

<p>NB: I have written the elements P(l,m) = a*sin(kl*x1)*sin(km*x1) to simplify the code. The actual expression is P(l,m) = sin(kl*x1)*sin(km*x1)*epsilon + kl*km*cos(kl*x1)*cos(km*x1).*b + km*cos(km*x1)*sin(kl*x1)-kl*cos(kl*x1)*sin(km*x1)/(kl^2-km^2).</p>

<p>First of all, this code does actually work. Creating arr2 this way does turn a Razor model into something that I can use. However, my nose says code smell. It says that throwing together two languages razor and Javascript, which have somewhat similar C-based programming flow syntax could be confusing to the next person that comes along and tries to read it.</p>

I have a series of URLS all starting with '/ships' for various API endpoints.  '/ships' is the most generic and simply returns a summary of all ships in the database.  Then there is '/ships/id/:id' which allows the client to specify a specific ship by id.  And '/ships/name/:name' to specify a specific ship by name.</p>

<p>Now the problem i'm having though is that when I make a call to the more generic '/ships', it is matching both '/ships' AND '/ships/id/:id'.  If I comment out the ID endpoint then it will match the NAME one instead.  In other words, it matches the base one, then rolls over into the more specific ones.  This is with the generic one first in the code.</p>

<p>If I instead move the generic '/ships' route to later in the code, then calling '/ships' will instead immediately match the more specific '/ships/id/:id' or '/ships/name/:name' whichever is first.</p>

<p>I can't for the life of me figure out why '/ships' would match with '/ships/id' or '/ships/name'.  </p>

I created dependency properties for each element, of type <code>UIElement</code>. This worked well.</p>

<p>When it came to styling control, it didn't work so well. Although I can define a style for the control that sets my custom properties, the style is only instantiated once. So if multiple instances of my custom control use the same style, only the last one to be defined gets the visual tree. I understand that this is because the style sets the <code>UIElement</code> directly rather than using a template, and it is the template infrastructure that makes multiple instances of the tree defined within it (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/8702180/1453269"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/8702180/1453269</a>)</p>

<p>My question is, how can I define a control that takes multiple templates in such a way that they will be applied? I have tried creating dependency objects of type <code>DataTemplate</code>. If I use a <code>ContentPresenter</code> to display the template, it just displays the type name of DataTemplate as text. I want it to apply the template values to my first dependency properties in a manner consistent with the rest of WPF. I had assumed there is a way to leverage the templating infrastructure in WPF, but I can't find how to do that.</p>

<p>and  use that to initiate a session with Bob. </p>

<p>My problem is caused because I call the Struts <code>configurationManager.reload()</code> method after loading some additional Struts2 XML config files that are stored in various plugins. Calling <code>reload()</code> kills the serving of static resources by Struts. My reload is done as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ConfigurationManager configurationManager = dispatcher.getConfigurationManager();
StrutsXmlConfigurationProvider strutsXmlConfigurationProvider =

<p>It might be a little old but it seems to work well apart from a little issue with the bounds to display the overlay in. </p>

<pre><code>-(void)showActivityView {
    if (overlayController == nil) {
        // This is where I get the wrong bounds
        overlayController = [[ActivityOverlayController alloc] initWithFrame:self.tableView.bounds];
    }
    [self.tableView insertSubview:overlayController.view aboveSubview:self.tableView];
}

<p>And this gets the bounds and displays my overlay perfectly if I call the method AFTER the table is loaded and filled but if I call it before it gets wrong bounds. I've tried getting the bounds of the tableView.superView but this just displays the overlay in the top left corner.</p>

<p>I understand this is because the UITableView doesn't contain any cells before loading and so doesn't have proper bounds yet but I don't know of a way to get these.</p>

While the data is loading, I show a loader(MBProgressHUD). This is my function for swapping the view controllers:</p>

<pre><code>class ViewUtils {

<p>All good with this but one thing - it totally breaks the loader. I am attaching an imagine of what's happening: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wif9F.png"" alt=""2nd view controller"">
This is the 2nd view controller while rotating. Once the rotation is complete, the loader appears just fine, both the spinner and the text tween to the correct position in the rounded rectangle.</p>

<p>I really don't understand why this happens, would somebody explain it to me, please? Is there a way to prevent it?</p>

<pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    hud = HUD(containingView: view)
    hud.show()

    createBackground()
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>class HUD {

    }

    func show() {

<p>In my code I am using a match function to cross check data in one sheet with data in the other. From this match I set a row id number and then use it in processing.

<p>I also tried just doing a .Select and everything works, i.e. all the other sheets work, apart from when referencing anything in this new sheet - lets call it MySheet. The code for match and loading the variable is as follows:</p>

<p>And this code below doesn't select at all the cell in the sheet, or raise any errors for that matter. I checked the variables i use in Match/Range and they are all populated as they should be, but it is just not pointing to the cell value in the sheet MySheet and therefore I get value = 0 for my user variable UniqueIDValue when I should be getting 2 for example. </p>

<pre><code>Range(""MySheet!$"" &amp; TargetColumnCharTest &amp; ""$2:$U$"" &amp; CStr(MaxRowCountTest)), 0).Select
</code></pre>

<p>When I do this with any other sheet if I step through the code and test by using .Select it goes to the sheet and the cell is selected.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read and hopefully you can shed some light on this - I can't figure it out but it seems that it will be something so simple.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use the <a href=""https://github.com/michael-wolfenden/Polly"" rel=""nofollow"">Polly</a> library to do something like this:</p>

reachable = HandleServerResponse(response);

<p>This works fine unless I get an Exception.  For instance, when I was getting an ApiException on one server I was testing against; the above code did not absorb the error!  It just threw the exception and crashed the program.  I could only get the code to work properly by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    var request = new PingUrlRequest();
    var validateUrlTask = apiService.UserInitiated.ValidateUrl(request);

    var response = await Policy

    reachable = HandleServerResponse(response);
}
catch (ApiException e)
{
    Mvx.Trace(e.StackTrace);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't feel correct... What's the point of having the Handle parameter up top if it doesn't do anything?  I have to be implementing this wrong!  Any suggestions?</p>

<p>My main problem is actually trying to make a connection with a TI CC2540  (KeyFob). I have loaded the demo software as provided by TI, all works well with Btool etc. and I am using a HTC Desire C (ICS, BT4.0), which does pair with the CC2540.  I have put together an APP, but have recently downloaded the BTChat Example from the Android SDK.  The Example App recognises the Keyfob, and even gets the correct Mac Address but as soon as I try to connect with it, it doesn't connect (Establish a Link).  I have carried out a lot of research and thought my problem may lie in the area of the UUID (128) but I am unable to find the correct UUID for the device.  Incidentally I have used the common one from the Android Dev Website, plus derivatives but with no success.</p>

<p>I eventually found an existing App for an Iphone (Bluetooth Smart Scanner) which did recognise my device but gave a 'null' response for the UUID.  </p>

<p>I am at a loss about where to go, could anybody point me in the right direction?</p>

One possibility is that some resources may go missing. When I neglect to put a dll in the run folder my application crashes spectacularly.  </p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to ""elegantly"" handle exceptions that result from missing resources?</strong></p>

<p>One of my classes imports a resource that references ""TcAdsDll.dll"".   .</p>

<pre><code>....
Imports Okuma.EthernetIO
....
</code></pre>

<p>In that class, I am able to catch the exception generated when I try to use this resource:</p>

<pre><code>    Try
        Dim objAdsStateInfo As TwinCAT.Ads.StateInfo = Nothing
        Try
             'Do a bunch of fun stuff with Ethernet...
        Catch...  
        'catch Ethernet errors              
        End Try
    Catch ex As Exception
    'This catches the exception generated when I try to instantiate an object that uses the dll which is no longer present
    End Try
</code></pre>

<p>However, after I handle this exception, the program still proceeds to crash.
Once out of the initialization phase, form main is loaded and I get all the way to the end sub of that event. As soon as I execute the 'End Sub' statement (debugging line by line), I get the message:</p>

<pre><code>DllNotFoundException was unhandled
Unable to load 'tcadsdll.dll': The specified module could not be found.
(Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)
</code></pre>

<p>I've added code to check for the existence of this .dll before doing anything with the resource that uses it, but because it's linked into the class with an imports statement, it still tries to dispose it and crashes. Do I have to rebuild the resource (Okuma.EthernetIO) to include checking for the dll file? Or is there an elegant way to go about this easily in my application that I am just unaware of?</p>

<p><em>UPDATE:</em> Checking for dll file existence before jumping into the class which contains the import is working for me. It stops the exception from being generated in the first place. However the question reamains:<br>

The video file is generated before it's being shared using an <code>UIActivityItemProvider</code>.</p>

<p>Because the file generation and sharing can take a while for longer videos, it's important that the user can cancel the sharing operation.</p>

<p>This all worked without a problem in iOS7.0. The user could tap the cancel button on the <code>UIActivityViewController</code> at any time, and the sharing operation was canceled.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for all the comments.</p>

<p>Further debugging appears to suggest that there might be a threading issue.My <code>UIActivityItemProvider's</code> item method is using a semaphore to make a block-based asynchronous export method <code>defacto synchronous</code>. Hereby also blocking the thread it is executing on. I thought this shouldn't be a problem as the documentation for the <code>-(void)item</code> method says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This method is called on a secondary thread of your app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under iOS7.0 the <code>UIActivityItemProvider's</code> cancel method was called from another thread than the one using the semaphore (as expected from the documentation), but under iOS7.1, could it be called from the same (blocked) thread, causing it to never execute? I can't test for this, as the cancel method never gets executed and I'm not responsible for calling it.</p>

<p>Is there an alternative way to force my export method to execute synchronously without blocking? Basically my issue is that <code>UIActivityItemProvider'</code> item method has a long running export method, but `UIActivityItemProvider still needs to be able to receive cancel calls while it is exporting.</p>

<p>While this does make the uploaded images accessible from <code>@post.image_uploads</code>, I think it doesn't associate these images with the post because when the post is deleted, the image uploads are not deleted -- even though I have used <code>:dependent=&gt;:destroy</code> for their relationships.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Post.first.delete
=&gt;[]
&gt; ImageUpload.all
=&gt; [#&lt;ImageUpload id: 3 ...&gt;] 
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the model:</p>

<pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
 has_many :image_uploads, :dependent =&gt; :destroy

end

class ImageUploads &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
 belongs_to :post

end

<p>What can I do to make sure that cascading deletes work?</p>

<p>We've got a large application that takes a while to load.  So we have a splash screen.
The Splash screen causes excessive load time on Remote Desktop (terminal server).
So to alleviate this, we want to hide the splash screen when loading on RDP.
But we still need to at least show the user that the application is loading.</p>

<p>So, I was thinking perhaps just show something in the Taskbar (not the system tray), as it will disappear once the application is fully loaded (and be replaced by the main form's Task icon).
However any WPF solution I've looked at, requires a visible form/window to go with the Taskbar status.</p>

<p>Is there any way of showing something in the Taskbar without showing a WPF window?</p>

<p>Or is there another way of showing application load status without something on the screen?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if it reaches a row that has a blank cell in the activity column (i.e. an administrative task without any activities), it stops going through the list, pushing neither the administrative session information nor any client session that followed.

<p>For example, imagine a blog backed by Firebase where the blogger can tag posts with tags. As the blogger is tagging a new post, it would be helpful if they could see all currently-existing tags that matched the first few keystrokes they've entered. So if ""blog,"" ""black,""  ""blazing saddles,"" and ""bulldogs"" were tags, if the user types ""bl"" they get the first three but not ""bulldogs."" </p>

<p>My initial thought was that we could set the tag with the priority of the tag, and use startAt, such that our query would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>fb.child('tags').startAt('bl').limit(5).once('value', function(snap) {
  console.log(snap.val()) 
});
</code></pre>

<p>But this would also return ""bulldog"" as one of the results (not the end of the world, but not the best either). Using startAt('bl').endAt('bl') returns no results. Is there another way to accomplish this?</p>

<p>(I know that one option is that this is something we could use a search server, like ElasticSearch, for -- see <a href=""https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-01-02-queries-part-two.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-01-02-queries-part-two.html</a> -- but I'd love to keep as much in Firebase as possible.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>As Kato suggested, here's a concrete example. We have 20,000 users, with their names stored as such:</p>

<pre><code>/users/$userId/name
</code></pre>

<p>Oftentimes, users will be looking up another user by name. As a user is looking up their buddy, we'd like a drop-down to populate a list of users whose names start with the letters that the searcher has inputted. So if I typed in ""Ja"" I would expect to see ""Jake Heller,"" ""jake gyllenhaal,"" ""Jack Donaghy,"" etc. in the drop-down. </p>

They both xor 256 bits.

<p>The task is to have it to cycle forwards and then backwards 0,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,0,1,2... etc</p>

<p>I've tried to implement several counting methods to count up and count down given certain conditions, but they appear to fight and loop between frame 4/5.</p>

<p>Is there a quick solution? or would anyone be able to  point me in the direction of a solution please :)</p>

<pre><code>    void SpriteGame::Update(int tickTotal, int tickDelta){

    if ( tickTotal &gt;= this-&gt;playerLastFrameChange + (TICKS_PER_SECOND / playerSheetLength) )
    {
        this-&gt;playerFrame = this-&gt;playerFrame + 1;
        this-&gt;playerLastFrameChange = tickTotal;

        if (this-&gt;playerFrame &gt;= this-&gt;playerSheetLength)
        {
            this-&gt;playerFrame = 0;
        }

        this-&gt;playerSourceRect-&gt;left = this-&gt;playerFrame * widthOfSprite;
        this-&gt;playerSourceRect-&gt;top = 0;
        this-&gt;playerSourceRect-&gt;right = (this-&gt;playerFrame + 1) * widthOfSprite;
        this-&gt;playerSourceRect-&gt;bottom = widthOfSprite;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>implementing the (abs()) method worked counting 0,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2.. etc </p>

<pre><code>//initializing playerFrame = -4; at the top of the .cpp

this-&gt;playerFrame = this-&gt;playerFrame +1; //keep counting for as long as its &lt;= 5 [sheet length]

if (this-&gt;playerFrame &gt;= this-&gt;playerSheetLength)
{
this-&gt;playerFrame = -4;
}

this-&gt;playerSourceRect-&gt;left = (abs(playerFrame)) * widthOfSprite;

I've read a bunch of people's post about Wildcards, but I am still confuse in terms of where I would put it with my current code. I've tried a few ways, but with my luck, nothing worked. Do I need to change something out in order for the Wildcard to work? I have used ""<em>"" and not ""%"" since people are saying that MS Access only supports ""</em>"". What I want to do is to allow the user to search for a term like 'Doll"" and all the product with the word ""Doll"" will show up in that Field. Also is it possible, to have the result coming back with a hyper-link attached to like ""ninjaturtle"" where when the user click on ninjaturtle and all the information will be there? But first, I just want to know how to get the Wildcard search to work. My code is posted below. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<p>I am positive I will need to log in as root on the server to accomplish the right settings; but I do not know the right way to set permissions for nginx to allow a php script to write to the folder and access it's contents.</p>

<p>My path to the web root looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/httpdocs
</code></pre>

<p>So I wanted to create a folder here ( I am guessing ):</p>

<pre><code>/var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/new_folder
</code></pre>

<p>I have not logged in to the server as the root user before, but I have found a few lines of commands that may be relevant.  I do not know which applies to my situation.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/new_folder
chmod 755 /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/new_folder
</code></pre>

<p>Will this work for a server running nginx? or do I need something like this?</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/new_folder
sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/new_folder
</code></pre>

<p>I think that the sudo command deals with permission on folders that were supposed to only be accessed by the root user.</p>

<p>I am having a hard time researching this as I do not understand which context to use these commands.  I still do not know how to set the permission of a folder so a php script can read and write to that directory.</p>

<p>I could really use a nudge in the right direction, as I am terrified in trying to just start blindly entering commands on the server logged in as root.</p>

<p>I submit the form using <code>POST</code> method to the same page. If a user added additional rows using the JavaScript, it loads with the previous amount of rows as when the page was submitted. To do this I used PHP <code>$table_rowcount = count( $_POST[""item_details""] );</code>. Just FYI, the <code>{$table_rowcount}</code> isn't a syntax error as I'm using a template engine.</p>

<p>Everything works great to this point. Administrators can add additional rows to input data and when the page is submitted to itself it loads those number of rows. Perfect. <em>However this is where the problem comes in.</em></p>

<p>What I need to do is use a method of sticky forms so if there is an error, the page will reload (as it currently does) with variables assigned to each inputs <code>value=""""</code> so the administrator wont have to re-enter all the details.</p>

<p>The problem is I do not know how to do this with a combination of JavaScript and PHP. I need to some how get the current number of the row using the <code>for()</code> loop in JavaScript and then use that number in a PHP variable as seen in the tbody of the HTML below for the default 1st row.</p>

<p>Basically if it is the 3rd row and the <code>for()</code> loop will show it as <code>var i = 2</code> (since array starts at 0), how can I use JavaScript to help me call the PHP variable <code>{$item.2.details}</code>.</p>

<p>I'm assuming I need to use AJAX for this? However I do not know AJAX. I'm hoping someone could assist me with this so myself and others can learn how this is properly done.</p>

<p><strong>Question simply put</strong></p>

<p>How can I use a JavaScript variable to select a PHP array in a HTML file?</p>

        // Set table id.
        var table = document.getElementById(""invoice_items"");

        // Count rows.
        var rowCount = table.rows.length;

        // Row to insert into table.
        var row = table.insertRow(rowCount);

        // Cells to insert into row.
        var cell1 = row.insertCell(0);
        var cell2 = row.insertCell(1);
        var cell3 = row.insertCell(2);

        // Current Row.
        var rowNumber = rowCount + 1;

        // Data in cells.
        cell1.innerHTML = ""&lt;textarea name=\""item_details[]\""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;"";

<p>A super base class that we will use to store instances with this base in the same container and a few ""Facet"" classes that we will use with multiple inheritance to encapsulate common behaviour.</p>

<pre><code>class Facet_A;
class Facet_B;
class Facet_C;

struct Facet_converter
{
    Facet_A * facet_a;
    Facet_B * facet_b;
    Facet_C * facet_c;
};

class Super_base
{
    public:

    virtual ~Super_base() {}
    virtual Facet_converter convert()=0;
    virtual const Facet_converter convert()const=0; //Notice this const...

};

class Facet_A
{
    private:

    int value_a;

    public:

    virtual ~Facet_A() {}
    Facet_A():value_a(0) {}
    void set_value_a(int v) {value_a=v;}
    int get_value_a() const {return value_a;}
};

class Facet_B
{
    private:

    float value_b;

    public:

    Facet_B():value_b(0) {}
    virtual ~Facet_B() {}
    void set_value_b(float v) {value_b=v;}
    float get_value_b() const {return value_b;}
};

class Facet_C
{
    private:

    char value_c;

    public:

    Facet_C():value_c('a') {}
    virtual ~Facet_C() {}
    void set_value_c(char v) {value_c=v;}
    char get_value_c() const {return value_c;}
};
</code></pre>

<p>All classes that derive from these will always:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Super_base as a public base class, so we can store them in a vector of these.</li>
<li>Implement the convert methods that will return a Facet_converter object with pointers (shared, unique, raw, whatever) of the derived class casted as a particular facet (null, if not applicable).</li>
<li>Use Facet_A, Facet_B or Facet_C as a base class depending on what do they try to implement.</li>
</ul>

<p>The client code would do something like...</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;Super_base *&gt; v;

//Fill super base with the good stuff.

//Let's use everything that has an integer!.
for(auto sb : v)
{
    Facet_converter fc=sb-&gt;convert();
    if(fc.facet_a)
    {
        //Do something with this integer like... std::cout&lt;&lt;fc.facet_a-&gt;get_value_a()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
    }
}

//Let's use everything that has a float.
for(auto sb : v)
{
    Facet_converter fc=sb-&gt;convert();
    if(fc.facet_b)
    {
        //Do something with this float...
    }
}

//Let's use everything that has a char.
for(auto sb : v)
{
    Facet_converter fc=sb-&gt;convert();
    if(fc.facet_c)
    {
        //You get the drift...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Horrible design apart (I've come to this point sick of visitors everywhere) this particular example is pretty much barebones, but you get what I am trying to do: casting down the hierarchy without using dynamic_cast and ""enforcing"" the compiler help (it would yell at me if I tried an assignment to a non-base class in the ""convert"" method).</p>

<p>So, a of fully implemented class...</p>

<pre><code>class Derived_numeric:  //This one has a float and and int
    public Super_base,
    public Facet_A,
    public Facet_B
{
    ///Blah blah blah blah

    virtual Facet_converter convert()
    {
        Facet_converter result;
        result.facet_a=this;
        result.facet_b=this;
        result.facet_c=nullptr;     //Assume no constructor for the struct that initializes the method, not really the case.
        return result;
    }

    virtual const Facet_converter convert()const
    {
        const Facet_converter result;
        result.facet_a=this;        //Booom!!!. Error, const Derived_numeric can't be caster to Facet_A because... it's const.
        result.facet_b=this;
        result.facet_c=nullptr; 
        return result;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And there's the problem, right in the const convert method. There's a const and a non const method because the client code may work with const and non const objects but there's no way the compiler is gonna let me assign a ""const this"" without const casting it first.</p>

<p>Considering that I've come with two solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>const_casting the this pointer in the const method.</li>
<li>Creating two Facet_converter objects: Facet_converter and Facet_converter_const. They're exactly the same but one has const pointers and the other has regular pointers. Let the client code use the one they need.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of them suffer from horrible code repetition, since the code is almost the same and only a few details change. </p>

<p>I've toyed with the idea of implementing only the const one, const_casting the ""this"" pointer and basically lying about what the method promises. Want true constness?, add the const modifier to the result of convert() and be done with it... Seems easier, but too sneaky.</p>

<p>My question is, can I implement this idea without basically copying and pasting the code and being sneaky?. Remember that I need both const and non const (the derived object may change its state by using the facets, or it may not).</p>

<p>Now, please consider that I am not looking for ""Your approach is wrong"" or ""I don't know why you would want to do that"". This is the current situation I want to deal with and learn about. I already know I can use double dispatching or I can bastardize the whole base class to contain every other possibility... I am just looking for alternatives to it.</p>

<p>So there is one Accordion which I am programmatically adding AccordionPanes to. The amount of panes I add depends on my particular dataset's count value, usually no more than 5. I've managed to do this successfully.</p>

<p>The thing I am having difficulty with is creating and adding a Repeater per each AccordionPane.</p>

<p>I've glanced over <a href=""http://iridescence.no/post/Using-Templated-Controls-Programmatically.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iridescence.no/post/Using-Templated-Controls-Programmatically.aspx</a> but this is not exactly what I had in mind. Instead, I would rather declare a single Repeater as static HTML that I could then ""clone"" when I need. How can I achieve this? Obviously I would want each control's ID (within this declared Repeater) to be generated automatically each time i ""clone"" it.</p>

<p>The repeater looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Repeater ID=""rptForum"" runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;

Eventually, once the power restored, I thought I would set a font by .setTypeFace() before running my app again but this made my app crash when I did run it. So after fiddling around with the code and finding no fix, I decided to get rid of the whole font and just run the app with the bug fix.

I currently have a class extending another that will have a gameinfo.class annotation on each class (Is there a way I can enforce this with the compiler?)</p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to call the following in the type it is extending:</p>

<pre><code> @GameInfo(name = ""Default Minigame"", aliases = {""DM""}, pvp = false, authors = {""Tom""},
gameTime = 65, description = ""desc"")
public class DefaultMinigame extends Minigame {

    public DefaultMinigame(Plugin p) {
        super(p, DefaultMinigame.class.getAnnotation(GameInfo.class));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I'd rather not have to call the above in each class and instead call it in Minigame.class
How would I do this without calling ""this"" (Due to super type not being initialized)</p>

<p>Thanks for your time! 
(And sorry if what I'm saying isn't the most comprehensible of questions)</p>

Anyhow, I have a webservice that acts as a proxy to our vendors site. It simplifies the ""screen scrape"" that we would usually have to do. The webservice function looks like this:</p>

<pre>
namespace foo  
{  
  public class MyService : WebService  
  {
     [WebMethod]  
     public string UploadFile(System.IO.FileStream fileToUpload)

     }  
  }  
}    
</pre>

<p>The client throws an error when you try to give it the FileStream that the method asks for. In compilation somewhere, the webservice changed the type of the parameter from System.IO.FileStream to foo.FileStream. Does anyone have any ideas as to how I did this to myself?</p>

<p>The issue I have is I cannot follow links to different pages as it tries to direct the browser to a file within the directory that doesn't exist. For example. When I am on the homepage and I drop down the ABOUT menu and hit OUR TEAM, it will direct to the OUR TEAM page, but once I am on the OUR TEAM page and drop down the RESOURCES menu, it tries to take me to ""about/resources/whateverpage.php"" as opposed to ""/resources/whateverpage.php""</p>

<p>How do I make it so it will actually direct the to /resources directory instead of remaining within the /about directory. I've tried using ""../"" before the links but you can guess where the problems would arise with that.</p>

<p>As well, because of the fact that I have the links pointed to about/ourteam.php (for example), when I am in the ABOUT menu/directory and I go to click another page within the ABOUT menu it tries to lead me to about/about/hours.php instead of about/hours.php </p>

<pre><code>@XmlRootElement(name = ""User"", namespace = ""security.services.pml.com"")
public class User {
    @XmlElement(namespace = ""security.services.pml.com"", required = true)
    protected String name;
    @XmlElement(namespace = ""security.services.pml.com"", required = true)
    protected String nickname;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When we have a resource method that returns a List of User we get XML with the following format (note the lowercase ""users"" parent element):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?&gt;
&lt;users&gt;
    &lt;User xmlns=""security.services.pml.com""&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;John Doe&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;nickname&gt;Jackie&lt;/nickname&gt;
    &lt;/User&gt;
&lt;/users&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We expect Jersey to instead pluralize <strong>User</strong> (from the annotation) to come up with <strong>Users</strong> instead of <strong>users</strong>.</p>

<p>In Jersey 1.x we dealt with this Jersey bug by putting the following config property into our web.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;com.sun.jersey.config.feature.XmlRootElementProcessing&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But that seems to have no effect in Jersey 2.x, and we can't find a new property to give the same result.  We obviously could instead return a properly annotated object called Users that contained a list of User and get the desired result, but we didn't have to do that with Jersey 1.x.</p>

<p>Does anybody know what we are missing?</p>

However, I want to keep the as much of the existing Python project intact as possible, which means allowing Python to manage execution.  </p>

<p>PyV8 does just about everything I want except provide a node.js-like environment that would allow me to use node.js modules in PyV8, so it seems like a good starting point.</p>

<p>Does node.js provide an external API similar to that of V8 such that one could modify PyV8 to wrap node.js?  If not, is there a way to load the node.js environment into PyV8 so I can use node.js modules? </p>

<p>I hear around everywhere that RAII is (for the most part) a unique idiom to C++. But why is that exactly? I believe most OOP languages force you to create objects on the heap (by all means correct me if I'm wrong), which then leads to wanting a GC to deal with memory management altogether. But what's wrong/bad just having stuff work from the stack in the first place? What advantage does it serve implementing things as they do?</p>

<p>Perhaps this extends to the lack of understanding I have behind heap usage in the first place. I don't quite 'get' the point of it outside of precaching big stuff before it's needed. 99.9% of my code ever involving pointers at all is just interfacing with old code!</p>

<p>okay so i want it so if someone enters a 1 and enters a value between 0 and 1 it will lighten the image and if someone enters 2and enters a value between 0 and 1 it darkens the image(I think this one works?)</p>

<p>here are the equations I was given, why is this not working?
Shade (darken) 
    If the value of pixel p1 = (r1, g1, b1) and the amount of desired change is s (&lt;= 1.0) 
    Then the value of the new pixel, p2 = 
    r2 = r1 * s 
    g2 = g1 * s 
    b2 = b1 * s </p>

<pre><code>Tint (lighten) 
If the value of pixel p1 = (r1, g1, b1) and the amount of desired change is t (&lt;= 1.0) 
Then the value of the new pixel, p2 = 
r2 = (t * r1) + (255 * (1.0 - t)) 
g2 = (t * g1) + (255 * (1.0 - t)) 
b2 = (t * b1) + (255 * (1.0 - t))

<p>For example take the two methods outlined in my hypothetical piece of code below (purely illustrative), I have a method that throws exceptions that I call multiple times but require different handling depending on which call it is. Similarly there could be different types of exception thrown with different handlers.</p>

<pre><code>private Object exceptionMethod() throws Exception {
    throw new Exception(""Something bad happened"");
}

public void useMethodSequentialHandlers() {
    Object o1; // Must be declared in a wider scope than where it is used
    try {
        o1 = exceptionMethod();
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Assume we cannot continue after this exception so we'll return or
        // rethrow to exit the method
        return;
    }

    Object o2; // Must be declared in a wider scope than where it is used
    // Do something that requires o1
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
        try {
            o2 = exceptionMethod();
            // Here we would use the objects in some manner
            boolean equal = o1.equals(o2);// Just a pointless example
                                                // to show that both objects
                                                // are required
                // Assume the method does a load of stuff down here
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            // Assume we can continue to the next iteration after this exception
            continue;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I see it the advantage of having the try/catch blocks in a sequential order is that it is clearer to the reader exactly at what point I'm responding to the exception so perhaps there is better code clarity.
The disadvantages would be that we have exception handling littered around various places in the method and we have variables declared in a wider scope than required (is this a bad thing?).</p>

<p>Alternatively:</p>

<pre><code>public void useMethodNestedHandlers() {
    try {
        Object o1 = exceptionMethod(); // Can be declared inside scope where it is used
        // Do something that requires o1
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
            try {
                Object o2 = exceptionMethod(); // Can be declared inside scope where it is used
                // Here we would use the objects in some manner
                boolean equal = o1.equals(o2); // Just a pointless example
                                                // to show that both objects
                                                // are required
                // Assume the method does a load of stuff down here
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                // Assume we can continue to the next iteration after this
                // exception
                continue;
            }
        }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Assume we cannot continue after this exception so we'll return or
        // rethrow to exit the method
        return;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we keep exception handling logic together and variables are declared within the scope they're used. However to me the exception handling logic seems less clear as it is further from it's point of origin. 
Does anyone have an opinion on which would be better or am I just worrying about pointless minutiae and should just get on with my job? :-)</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, when the user navigates to other records trough ajax on that same page, we got an irritant refresh.

<p>I've read on stackoverflow that we should use delegate instead of live, on this case however, live seems to do the job while delegate doesn't. OR, am I using it wrongly ?</p>

So, and using <em>on</em>, by taking the same examples as above:</p>

Needless to say, maintaining the build process can be quite a chore. </p>

<p>There are several places in the codebase where it would clean up the code substantially if only there were a way to make the pre-processor ignore certain #includes if the file didn't exist in the current folder. Does anyone know a way to achieve that?</p>

<p>Presently, we use an #ifdef around the #include in the shared file, with a second project-specific file that #defines whether or not the #include exists in the project. This works, but it's ugly. People often forget to properly update the definitions when they add or remove files from the project. I've contemplated writing a pre-build tool to keep this file up to date, but if there's a platform-independent way to do this with the preprocessor I'd much rather do it that way instead. Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>using WinFormApp1;
class Class1
{
    private Form1 Frm1;

    public Class1(Form1 parent)
    {
        Frm1 = parent;

    }
}

<p>It works perfectly, but now I want to call class1 methods in class2 and vice versa. What is the best way of doing this? Should I define another constructor in each class without input argument like below, or there is any better way of doing this? Is there any way I can use the existing constructor like in above to define instances of class1 in class2 and vice versa?</p>

<p>The error itself is self-explanatory because it says class not found means some jar is not on the classpath. But I have no idea from where this listener is being invoked or has any reference to it, as in my code I do not have any such reference to it. And one more thing the exact same war file gets deployed on weblogic 12c without any error without changing any line of code. Below is my code. </p>

<p>I am not clear as to what I could do to resolve this, I have looked at other threads but they all seem to actually use some jsf and myface libraries in their project and missed to add it to war file. And its also not clear as to how come it is working on weblogic 12c with same code. </p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated. </p>

another calendar object. I expected same date from that object. But actually

<p>The data consists of a position for a circle and the number of circles that will be at that position. The demo data here also demonstrates that this aggregation isn't perfect for various reasons - their may be two entries for the same position both indicating that a few circles are positioned there.</p>

<p>I would like to calculate and show the actual transparency as if I had been given the data in a completely un-aggregated form - e.g. in this example dataset the un-aggregated form would have three entries for the circle at position <code>3</code> and the transparency of the circle at position <code>3</code> would be the same as the transparency of the circle at the position <code>4</code>.</p>

<p>How could I calculate the alpha level I should use for each point to get this result? Note that I do not want to manipulate the data before hand to get the un-aggregated form, since the reason it is aggregated is to prevent huge numbers of svg elements being plotted, which would be very intensive to process.</p>

I know the maximum and minimum length of the file but I am doing something wrong when I read in the file and then split it up as I am getting really funny values and stuff when I try to compare methods. The maximum length of any line is 80 character. </p>

<p>The format for each line will be as follows: (I will write them in column form as they would appear in a character array)
0-7 _ 9 10-16 _ 18 19-28_ _31-79</p>

<p>spots 0-7 will contain a string(any being under 8 will have blank spaces)
spots 8,17,29,30 are all blank spaces (Marked by underscores)
spots 10-16 will contain a string (again any being under the max length will have blank spaces at the end)
spot 18 will contain a blank space or a character
spot 19-28 will contain another string (Same as other cases)
spot 31-79 can be filled with a string or may not exist at all depends on the users input. </p>

<p>Right now I am using a buffer of size 82 and then doing strncpy to take certain parts from the buffer to break it up. It appears to be working fine but when I do strcmp I am getting funky answers and the strlen is not giving the char arrays I declared the right length. </p>

<p>(I have declared them as having a max length of 8,9,etc. but strlen has been returning weird numbers like 67) </p>

<p>So if I could just read it in broken up it should completely resolve the issue. </p>

<p>I was hoping there would be a way to do this but am currently unsure. </p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have attached the part of the code where I think the error is. </p>

<p>(I know it isn't good to have the size hardcoded in there but I want to get it working first and then I'll get rid of the magic numbers)</p>

(Forgive me, I'm a beginner) Is there a good design pattern where class instances interact together without the interference of the superclass, or at least at a minimum level? I would like to create instances that are fully independent. But in order to interact with others, they need to have a notion of the world around it. I have the feeling there must be an elegant way to directly access other instances' methods.. or?

<p>There are a few samples for the API showing how to do partial updates (i.e. via HTTP PATCH), but Google Contacts specifically doesn't seem to support PATCH . The docs also specify that contacts updates done via PUT need to include the full information about the contact since any existing data omitted in the PUT request will be removed from the contact.</p>

<p>So what's the easiest procedure to read a contact, modify its data and update it? The client API has this nice <code>AtomParser</code> that takes the response from the HTTP GET request and populates members in my class, but unless my class contains every possible field that a contact could have, I might not read in all the data and as such delete data during the HTTP PUT.</p>

<p>My only guess is that I'll have to skip all the cool AtomParser witchcraft and just use a plain old XML parser to read the incoming feed, extract the information I need and then do an HTTP PUT on it. But that seems a bit absurd, given all the functionality int he API client. Is there a better way?</p>

<p>I'm secretly hoping there is an equivalent to this:</p>

<pre><code>HttpRequest request = transport.buildPatchRequest();
request.setUrl(getEditLink());
AtomPatchRelativeToOriginalContent content =
    new AtomPatchRelativeToOriginalContent();

content.namespaceDictionary = Namespace.DICTIONARY;
content.originalEntry = originalEntry;
content.patchedEntry = modifiedEntry;
request.content = content;

return RedirectHandler.execute(request).parseAs(getClass());

<p>So my question is this, how can i make sure that the return page comes from PayPal and is not spoofed by a user in the system.  I know there is a way to use the notify_url to have PayPal post back to our system, but in this case i have to run a chunk of javascript.  Is there an easy way to do this, or would i have to write some looping/timeout function that checks to see if the notify post has come through?</p>

A second WebForm ""Benutzer.aspx"" display the Information about this User. I think I need a Value (ID or eMail) of the selected User for the second WebForm. So I need a Session. So if I click the Button ""Anzeigen"" I need the Value of the eMail or ect. of this actually Line in the ListView. </p>

<p>My Problem:</p>

<p>I don't know how I can get the other Informations of this ListView Line. I think I need a kind of Index or I must control a Cell.</p>

<p>Now, whenever the mask appears as if (this.facetracker!=null), the code starts to calculate the angles and generate the text file.
My question is how can I add a control (e.g.Timer or button) to decide exactly when to start calculating features or generating the file because in data collection I need features to be recorded accurately when the speaker starts to pronounce phrases not when the mask appears.
I have tried to add a dispatcherTimer as when the timer counts after the mask appears it starts to calculate the angles like this:</p>

<pre><code>  private static void dispatcherTimer_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            Microsoft.Kinect.Toolkit.FaceTracking.FaceTrackFrame fr;
            fr = facetracker.Track(sensor.ColorStream.Format, colorPixelData,
                              sensor.DepthStream.Format, depthPixelData,skeleton);
             //getangles(fr) and stream writter

        }
</code></pre>

<p>and added this to getangles(fr)</p>

<pre><code>    System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherTimer dispatcherTimer = new   System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherTimer();
                dispatcherTimer.Tick += dispatcherTimer_Tick;
                dispatcherTimer.Interval = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 10);
                dispatcherTimer.Start();            
</code></pre>

<p>but this gives an error in:   var shape = frame.Get3DShape(); as using unassigned variable frame and I tried to declare facetracker in timer's void  but this gives me an error too so, if you have an I idea how can I add a timer or a button to control when the angles to be calculated I would be grateful.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

I'm using the <code>onUpdate</code> function which actually halts the rest of the program (i.e. the 2nd tween). Trying to tween multiple circles with a delay thus also does not work??

<p>UPDATE: Changing <code>micCircleOne</code> to <code>micCircleTwo</code> inside <code>circlesTwoExpandUpdate();</code> fixed the problem. -facepalm-<br/>
<br/>
However, I've run into another one with some additional code. The blur is happening inside <code>circles();</code> but it seems that the <code>onUpdate</code> is causing each and every blur of the whole displayObject to be redrawn every time, causing it to lag lots.</p>

<pre><code>TweenMax.set(micCircleOne, {alpha:1, blurFilter:{blurX:0, blurY:0}});

TweenMax.to(micCircleOne, 1, {ease:SlowMo.ease.config(1, 0), alpha:0, blurFilter:{blurX:20, blurY:20}, delay:1});
</code></pre>

<p>The blur and alpha gets reset in <code>circlesExpandAnimate();</code> and run again with the exact same code:</p>

<pre><code>TweenMax.set(micCircleOne, {alpha:1, blurFilter:{blurX:0, blurY:0}});

TweenMax.to(micCircleOne, 1, {ease:SlowMo.ease.config(1, 0), alpha:0, blurFilter:{blurX:20, blurY:20}, delay:1});

<p>Level 1 Folders - Categories of projects</p>

<ul>
<li>Executables</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
<li>WebApps</li>
</ul>

<p>Level 2 Folders - Sub Categories within each category folder, these differ for each of the above Category folders</p>

<li>Employment</li>

<ul>
<li>TheFooApplication</li>
<li>BarUtility</li>
<li>ChewDotNet</li>
<li>FooBarQueryApp</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not going to perform a full migration, new projects will be created in TFS and current projects will be moved when the developers have time to do so.</p>

<p>So my question is how should we arrange the collections/projects in TFS whilst maintaining the above folder layout? If we were to use multiple collections could we only do this for the Level 1 folders i.e. you can't have collections within collections can you? Would it be best to just have one collection and then maintain the above folder structure in that one collection?</p>

<p>One thing that may impact any answer is that there are dependencies between the projects. So for example there are projects in the 3rd level of ""Libraries"" which are referenced in projects in the 3rd level of Webapps and Executable.</p>

<p>FileState looks at whether the document is dirty. If it isn't it does nothing and returns true. If it is dirty, it asks the user if he wants to save (YES/NO/CANCEL). If the user cancels at this point, it should abort the windowClosing.</p>

<p>All the suggestions I've seen on the net involve explicitly exiting in the windowClosing method, thus overriding the use of JFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(), and duplicating the code in JFrame.processWindowEvent(). </p>

<p>In the code sample they are using GUIDs for primary keys. In my case I'm using Identity columns that auto-increment.  The code in the link above works great, except on 'add' I can't get the primary key (return 0 as the for does not submit this data) when calling dbentry.current values.  </p>

<p>I'm trying to find a way to get the primary key so I can properly add it to my transactions table. I know you can retrieve this afterwards, but I'm not sure the best way to get that and then update the table with the correct primary key.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be appreciated. I'd prefer not to change my primary keys to GUIDs. </p>

<p>I made the following modifications to my dbcontext which works.</p>

<pre><code>if (ent.State == System.Data.EntityState.Added)
            {
                base.SaveChanges();
                ent.State = System.Data.EntityState.Added;
            }
</code></pre>

<p>then in the GetAuditRecordsForChange function I detached again so the record isn't created twice.</p>

<pre><code>if (dbEntry.State == System.Data.EntityState.Added)
        {
            // For Inserts, just add the whole record
            // If the entity implements IDescribableEntity, use the description from Describe(), otherwise use ToString()                   
            result.Add(new TransactionHistory()
            {
                TransactionTypeID = 1,
                TableName = tableName,
                FieldName = ""ALL"",

<pre><code>5 * * * * perl /abs/path/to/my/script.pl &gt;&gt; /abs/path/two/my/script-log.txt 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it's also redirecting both STDOUT and STDERR to the same log file.</p>

<p>I've been asked to refactor either the Perl script, the crontab entry, or to add any new code/scripts necessary so that every night, at midnight, the <code>script-log.txt</code> gets cleared/flushed/emptied.</p>

<p>That is, every night, at midnight, if <code>script-log.txt</code> has 20MB of text in it, to clean it out so that it now has nothing (0bytes) in it, and then at 12:05 AM the crontab would kick back in, run <code>script.pl</code>, and start adding more text to the same <code>script-log.txt</code> log file.</p>

<p>It would be <em>enormously</em> easier if there was a way to modify the crontab entry with some Linux/Perl magic to set up such a ""daily rolling log file"". In a worst-case scenario, we can always write a new script to purge <code>script-log.txt</code> and cron it to run at midnight. But my higher-ups would greatly prefer to not have yet-another cron job, and are looking for a way to do this from the entry itself (if possible).</p>

<p>In reality, we have dozens of entries that work like this, and so the problem with writing ""purging script"" and cronning it to run at midnight is that we'll constantly be updating the purging script as we add/delete other scripts that generate these kinds of log files. Thus, if we can set such purging up at the entry level, each cron entry cleans itself. Thanks for any insight/pointers/suggestions in advance.</p>

<p>with this solution, i need to resize any single column before going (if necessary) over 100%; if i enlarge only one column, for example, all the others columns are restricted, they does not maintain the original width (as i would)</p>

<p>Instead of using html, head and body tags I used an unordered list in hopes of getting flexbox to work properly, this could be a possible reason for it not working. I also attempted to place a comment in-between the heading3 and paragraph elements, but that obviously didn't work.</p>

<p>I'm using the Cloud9 (c9.io) code editor. In the CSS, I tried putting a negative value of margin-top, that did not work consistently either. When I open code inspector from Google Chrome, it shows my heading3 and paragraph elements with nothing in-between and no margins, padding, or borders preventing the heading3 and paragraph being closer together. I'm really lost. </p>

<p>Let me know if you need a link to view all of my code or if you need any more information. This is my first post here as usually I can figure things out on my own but in this case I seem to have come across an impossible scenario. Feel free to also let me know if there is anything I can do to improve my code if you have time.</p>

<p>EDIT: I already set margin and padding to 0. It didn't work. Inspect element showed that there was 0 margin or padding in my p and h3 elements.</p>

<p>However, I can't seem to update a property <em>inside</em> the array:</p>

<p>Anecdotally, it works if I perform an array operation afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>App.Entities.reverseObjects(); // change is picked up!

<p>So the question: How to update properties INSIDE an ArrayController (And make sure bindings are updated?)</p>

I've gotten to the point where IIS starts up git-http-backend in its own process, but then I always get a 500 error from IIS. These errors, even with detailed error messages turned on, really don't tell me anything other than that git-http-backend was the source of the error. IIS Failed request tracing also tells me nothing except that git-http-backend exited unexpectedly.</p>

<p>I would like to find out <em>why</em> it exited unexpectedly. If you run git-http-backend.exe manually on the command line, it prints out an HTTP response saying that there was no REQUEST_METHOD from server (see below). That's expected of course, because since I didn't invoke the command from a web server, there was no web server to set the REQUEST_METHOD environment variable.</p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\libexec\git-core&gt;git-http-backend.exe

fatal: No REQUEST_METHOD from server
</code></pre>

<p>But the point is, when Git has a problem, it prints out a detailed message. If I could see this message when it is being invoked by IIS, I could probably figure out what is going wrong and fix it. But IIS swallows these responses and prints out its own 500 responses (they are the detailed pages, not the customer error pages, but still, detailed pages show only IIS specific data apparently, not program output). Are there any CGI Windows developers out there who know how to get IIS to display CGI program output somewhere? Logs, exceptions, HTTP responses, I don't really care where as long as I can see the output.</p>

<p>Thx a lot</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>Given tiles: A, P, E, F, O, L, M

<p>Is this possible by using a simple SELECT-statement with REGEXP? If possible I would also like to add letters on specific positions and be able to determine max/min length.</p>

<li>Doing some checks (e.g. ensuring the module doesn't already exist),</li>
<li>Centrally storing modules in <code>App.moduleManager.modules</code></li>
</ul>

<p>My <code>key_length</code> is <code>31</code> and I know for sure it`s good (computed before, also for other values, for which the program get to the end and prints a decrypted chypertexht).</p>

<p>In <code>construct_cypherstreams</code> I am passing pointers to dinamically allocated memory in <code>compute_key</code>.
My intention is to populate a 2D array, <code>encr_streams</code> and a 1D array <code>bytes_in_stream</code>, of unknown sizes at compile-time.</p>

<p>In <code>construct_cypherstreams</code>, I print the contents of <code>bytes_in_stream[k]</code> after each iteration and I get valid data. There are 7 bytes in each stream, everything works as expected. I also print the newly formed <code>encr_streams[k]</code> and I also get expected values.</p>

<p>At step #1, after the program returns from <code>construct_cypherstreams</code>, i check to see if the contents of <code>bytes_in_stream</code> are correct, and I see the first 7 values are garbage and I really don`t understand why. I have written a lot of dummy examples to populate an array of all kinds inside a function and they all seem to work.</p>

<p>At step #2, when I got really frustrated, I just populated <code>bytes_in_stream</code> with the values I knew it should contain, so that I can get to the next part of the code. To my surprise, when I am trying to print <code>encr_streams</code>, my program crashes when <code>i</code> gets to be <code>24</code> (there are a total of 31 <code>encr_streams</code>).</p>

<p>I really don`t understand why this happens and I get the feeling that I am on a case of undefined behaviour.</p>

<p>The program is running smooth when it finds <code>key_length</code> to be <code>6</code>, for another stream.</p>

<pre><code>final Uri lookupUri = Uri.withAppendedPath(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI, contactKey);
final Cursor contactCur = mContentResolver.query(lookupUri, new String[] { ContactsContract.Contacts._ID },

    return false;
contactCur.moveToFirst();
long contactId = 0;

    contactId = contactCur.getLong(contactCur.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.Contacts._ID));
contactCur.close();
if (contactId == 0)
    return false;
final Uri contactUri = ContentUris.withAppendedId(Contacts.CONTENT_URI, contactId);

final InputStream inputStream;
if (VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= VERSION_CODES.ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH)

<p>It seems like on some rare cases, devices return me an exception of :</p>

<p>as it turns out, there are plenty of reports on this issue, but not regarding ""openContactPhotoInputStream"" function.</p>

<p>from what I've read (for example <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/6103365/878126""><strong>here</strong></a>), it is caused since the blob that need to be read is too large, but in this case, I have this problem within Android's code...</p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>What's the best way to overcome this?</p>

<p>Is it possible it's a bug on Android?</p>

<p>My guess is that even if I use try-catch , when I try to get the image later I would get the same error, right?</p>

What I have so far is this:</p>

<pre><code>(define (conversation input)
    (cond ((eq? (or ""hello Racket"" ""hi Racket"" ""what's up, Racket?""

(conversation ""hi Racket"")
(conversation ""hey Racket"")

<p>They will all return the same result, which is ""hey coder"". However, that is not what's happening. The only one that returns ""hey coder"" is (conversation ""hello Racket""). All the rest return ""no hable ingles."" As with many other aspects of the language, I'm not all too savvy with strings in scheme. I'm fairly certain that the problem lies within the or statement, though I wouldn't know of the alternatives that would work in this context.

<p>Controller has the model attribute called ""types"" mapping to Collection declared as code below:</p>

<pre><code>    @ModelAttribute(""types"")
    public Collection&lt;PetType&gt; populatePetTypes() {
        return this.clinicService.findPetTypes();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In JSP page, create a select box, which should list all types in String by <em>PetTypeFormatter.print()</em> method. You only need to parse <em>types</em> to select box <em>names</em> field. </p>

<pre><code> &lt;petclinic:selectField names=""${types}"" name=""type"" label=""Type"" size=""5""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in turn, use select string from select box, <em>PetTypeFormatter.parse()</em> method convert the string to PetType entity for controller to handle.</p>

<p>My question is that I have many entities needed to do this kind of formatting. After copying the code and creating more then 10 Formatters for different entity objects, I feel there must be better pattern to make the code look more concise. Can any one give me some advice? Thank you!</p>

<p>The jline dependency is correctly resolved, but strangely the setDefaultPrompt method does not appear to be present in the jar:</p>

<pre><code>$ javap -classpath target/lib/compile/jline-0.9.94.jar jline.ConsoleReader | grep setDefaultPrompt
$ 
</code></pre>

<p>(Other methods appear missing from the javap output as well, but setDefaultPrompt is the one breaking my build.)</p>

<p>I've tried wiping out jline from my local maven repository and trying again, to no avail. I've also checked the jline jarfile from <a href=""http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/jline/jline/0.9.94/jline-0.9.94.jar"" rel=""nofollow"">Maven Central</a> as well as a mirror with the same results.</p>

<p>Oddly, I can copy the jar file to a different machine (a Sun) and perform the exact same steps and I see the setDefaultPrompt method in the jar file as expected. Others have successfully performed the same steps on a Mac as well.</p>

<p>What could be happening on my machine which would prevent the Java toolchain from seeing methods contained in the jar file?</p>

<p>The way the application works when you are actually working within it is that you select an entry in a drop down box first. Then enter information in text boxes below it. You select another entry in the drop down box, the fields reset to blank text boxes. The code behind on the downstream application associates the text box information with the selection in the drop down. That is way that particular app works.</p>

<p>Our problem is automating this process. We use Win32 API calls to set information in the drop down using the following:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""user32.dll"")]
public static extern int SendMessage(IntPtr hWnd, int uMsg, [Out] int wParam, string lParam);

// Actual call to the downstream app.
SendMessage(hWnd, (int)CB_SELECTSTRING, 0, strValue); 
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is when we try to set the second value in the drop down box. The text boxes are not being reset. We have tried using the following calls as well:</p>

<pre><code>SendMessage(hWnd, (int)CB_SELECTSTRING, -1, strValue); 
SendMessage(hWnd, (int)CB_SETCURSEL, 0, strValue); 
SendMessage(hWnd, (int)CB_SETCURSEL, -1, strValue);
</code></pre>

<p>None of these messages are accomplishing the task. We need the call to simulate the Selected Index Changed event. Are we not using the right piece here? Or do we need to send a message to the parent to fire off that event?</p>

<p>I looked through our solution and did not find CBN_SELCHANGE anywhere or any API call that would send that to the parent. </p>

<p>Any ideas here folks? </p>

<pre><code>public abstract class GenericTree&lt;T&gt; : Tree
    where T : Fruit
{
    public Tree(IFruitCollection&lt;T&gt; fruits)
        : base(fruits) { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The base Tree class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Tree
{
    private IFruitCollection&lt;Fruit&gt; fruits;

    public IFruitCollection&lt;Fruit&gt; GetFruits
    {
        get { return fruits; }
    }

    public Tree(IFruitCollection&lt;Fruit&gt; fruits)
    {
        this.fruits = fruits;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my first problem. The constructor of GenericTree can't cast the the generic collection to a fruit collection. I've also got an implementation of the GenericTree:</p>

<pre><code>public class AppleTree : GenericTree&lt;Apple&gt;
{
    public AppleTree()
        : base(new FruitCollection&lt;Apple&gt;) { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my second problem. When I add fruit to an instance of AppleTree, using myAppleTree.GetFruits.Add(...), I am not restricted to apples only. I am allowed to add all kinds of fruit. I don't want this.</p>

<p>I tried to solve that problem by adding this to the GenericTree:</p>

<pre><code>new public IFruitCollection&lt;T&gt; GetFruits
{
    get { return base.GetFruits as IFruitCollection&lt;T&gt;; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this is not possible either. It somehow always returns null. It could be possible that this will be solved, when my first problem is solved.</p>

<p>The IFruitCollection interface looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IFruitCollection&lt;T&gt; : ICollection&lt;T&gt;
    where T : Fruit { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>And the FruitCollection class is a simple implementation of the Collection class.
Oh, and of course, the Apple class extends the Fruit class.</p>

<p>The solution is to make the IFruitCollection interface compatible with both covariance and contravariance. But how do I achieve this? The ""in"" or ""out"" parameter keywords are not possible, because the ICollection interface doesn't allow it.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>

<p>If I run this code it works perfectly. However in a quick look through the code there is this ""for (int z = 7; z >= 0; z--){}"" which appears to do absolutely nothing. However if I delete or comment it out my program decides that any input is not a binary number. If someone could tell me why this loop is needed and/or how to remove it, it would be much appreciated.

<p>Let's say i have three classes A, B and C that inherit from a base class X. Classes A, B and X have the constructor:</p>

<pre><code>- (id)InitWithString:(NSString*)someString andDelegate:(id&lt;SomeProtocol&gt;)aDelegate
</code></pre>

<p>the only difference being that every class uses a different protocol for the delegate.</p>

<p>What happens is that for A and B the compiler tries to use the method from C. A warning informs me that the protocols required by class C's constructor is not implemented by the provided delegate. There is nothing wrong with the delegate itself, since each class has a delegate that implements the right protocol for the classes' own constructor. Everything works fine at run time and the right functions are called for all classes.</p>

<p>I tried having the constructors return A*, B* or C* instead of the anonymous id, though this still doesn't solve the problem.</p>

<p>The only thing that works is making a cast to the right class like this:</p>

<pre><code>instanceOfA = [(A*)[A alloc] InitWithString:@"""" andDelegate:aDelegate];
</code></pre>

<p>This seems superfluous and unnecessary. I'm probably missing something obvious here.</p>

</ul>

<p>I’ve threaded the engine to use a thread pool to assemble the puzzles so I can process many puzzles at a time. However, in the example above, P2 will be solved before P1, but I need to mux the output together to ensure that P1 goes before P2. This, of course is a simplified example as I would expect to continuously be getting input data fed to the engine (I currently have a default of 10 threads) so the threads will be kept busy, but I still need to ensure the output order regardless of thousands of puzzles coming in.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1310214/register-an-object-creator-in-object-factory"">Register an object creator in object factory</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1691473/somehow-register-my-classes-in-a-list"">somehow register my classes in a list</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9975672/c-automatic-factory-registration-of-derived-types"">c++ automatic factory registration of derived types</a></p>

<p>The basic objective is to register classes automatically with some registry or factory so that it can do some work with each class later.</p>

<p>This is a well-established technique, used by libraries like (for example) Google Test (http://code.google.com/p/googletest), which automatically registers subclasses of the Test class so that each test can be instantiated automatically and run during test execution.</p>

<p>Registration can be accomplished by instantiating a static Registrar class whose constructor does the registration, or by clever use of the CRTP and putting the registration code in the base class constructor, or whatever you like (the links above offer several different possible techniques).</p>

<p>However, when I implement any of these techniques I find they scale very poorly.  If I have 10,000 TEST macro invocations in Google Test, compilation and linking grind to a halt (MSVC 2010) and binary size explodes.  If I implement this another way, using 10,000 subclasses with static registrars, I see the same behavior.</p>

<p>For instance, consider the simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

class Base {

    public:

        Base( const std::string&amp; Name_ ) : Name( Name_ ) { ; }
       ~Base() { ; }

        virtual std::string GetName() const { return Name; }
        virtual void DoSomething() = 0;

    private:

        std::string Name;

};

class Registry {

    public:

        static Registry&amp; GetInstance() {
            static Registry* Instance = new Registry();
            return *Instance;
        }

        void Register( const Base* b ) {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Registered class "" &lt;&lt; b-&gt;GetName() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        }

    private:

        Registry()  { ; }
       ~Registry()  { ; }

};

class Registrar {

    public:

        Registrar( const Base* b ) {
            Registry::GetInstance().Register( b );
        }

       ~Registrar() { }

};


#define  REGISTER( CLASS )                                          \
    class CLASS : public Base {                                     \
        public:                                                     \
            CLASS( const std::string&amp; Name ) : Base( Name ) { ; }   \
            virtual void DoSomething();                             \
        private:                                                    \
            static Registrar m_Registrar;                           \
    };                                                              \

int main( int argc, char** argv )
{
    return 0;
}


REGISTER( Class1 )
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Doing something in Class1"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

REGISTER( Class2 )
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Doing something in Class2"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

<p>Is there a fundamental reason why this won't scale well?  Will the compiler just choke on 10000 classes?  Under MSVC 2010 compilation of the above takes almost two minutes on a fairly fast machine and produces a binary over 5 MB in size.  If I do similar with Google Test I see the same result.</p>

"5552982","1","","","2011-04-05 13:53:47","","3","878","<p>I'm currently designing an application for iOS (using MonoTouch) that will have a server component running on Windows Azure. The application will essentially be a chat type application where users will generate messages within their clients and send them to the server, which will then need to forward those messages out (as quickly as practicable) to other clients that the user might be sending the messages to.</p>

<p>My question is - is there a recommended practice for architecting an application like this, where clients need to receive 'push' messages from the server?</p>

<p>I've considered a few options but would appreciate feedback.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first option is to use Apple's Push Notifications service (APNs). I have two concerns about this - first, the clients only need to receive the messages when they're online (APNs sends messages through when the app is closed too, which I don't need or want); and second, there is a possibility that there will be a high volume of messages, which I know Apple would probably get unhappy about (perfectly fairly).</p></li>
<li><p>A second option I considered is using a web service (WCF-based) and having the client call this service every (say) 2-3 seconds, which is the maximum delay we could tolerate. This would seem to involve a great deal of potentially unnecessary network traffic, though (""have you got anything for me?"", ""no"", repeated ad nauseum).</p></li>
<li><p>A third option is to maintain a persistent web service connection between the client and the server. When the client app starts it would call a web service method on a background thread. The server would hold the connection open (by not returning anything), and if any messages came through it would immediately return them. This connection might time out after, say, 2 minutes at which point it would be re-established. This seems to do what I want, but again, I'm concerned that there'd be a lot of connections open to the server at any moment, which could require server resources unnecessarily.</p></li>
<li><p>A fourth option is to use a persistent connection over TCP (or UDP, although from what I've found, Windows Azure doesn't support this). This seems to be a good option, but again, might be overkill in terms of server usage - there could potentially be hundreds or even thousands of clients connected at any moment.</p></li>
<li><p>A fifth option is to somehow have the server push messages directly to the client, perhaps by having the client run a mini web server or similar. However, as the app will be running on 3G and WiFi networks (beyond my control) I don't expect incoming ports will be open for this sort of thing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone has any other suggestions, or thinks one of the above options would be a good idea (or is a standard way of approaching this sort of problem) I'd be very interested to hear about it.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<li>Add it to url as querystring.</li>
<li>Email url to client.</li>
<li>Url opens and token in querystring is evaluated on client  and

<li>Client adds content and submits through Post to  webapi PUT.</li>
<li>Fields are submitted.</li>
<li><strong>Webapi PUT should only available to the Post from that url with query string.</strong></li>

<p>I've got a class that I would like to put on frame 1 as part of my preloader. This class is a rudimentary 3D cube that uses artwork in my library as textures for the faces of the cube. When I instantiated the class on frame 1, the cube was there but the textures were missing! I tried unchecking ""Export to frame 2"" for that artwork in the library, but that didn't seem to help. There doesn't seem to be a way to force them to export to frame 1, which should solve my problem. I've tried instantiating the artwork textures through actionscript, but that won't make them display either.</p>

<p>The only thing that works is to drag the artwork textures from my library onto frame 1 and hide them off screen or underneath something. Then the textures will display properly on my cube. It's a very inelegant solution to my problem. Anyone have any other ideas?</p>

<p>I want to know the opinion of people who have worked on the front-end:<br/></p>

<ul>
<li>I feel code validation is important but not the end of the world(as my priorities) - I do however like to change my code often by hand. Does the output from this software let you do this?(compare to the html/css that micorsoft word vomits - Does this software do a similar thing?)</li>
<li>Is this software used as a primary design tool by people who can code by hand and does it actually improve efficiency? or is it just for newbies?</li>

<p>The table is generated by MVC code-first application,
Latitude and longitude data type is real</p>

<p>I have a stored procedure that takes as input searchLatitude and searchLongitude and then calculates the distances:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[StockistSearch] 
    @searchLat float = 0,
    @searchLng float = 0
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
SELECT top 40

AS Distance
FROM Stockist s, Customer c, Address a
where s.CustomerId = c.Id
and c.ShippingAddress_Id = a.Id     
ORDER BY distance
END
</code></pre>

<p>If I execute this through SQL server management studio, it executes the following:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @return_value int

EXEC    @return_value = [dbo].[StockistSearch]
    @searchLat = 53.29,
    @searchLng = -3.72

SELECT  'Return Value' = @return_value

GO
</code></pre>

<p>Which return the distance correctly (0.645 miles)</p>

<p>However, when executed through the application using :</p>

<pre><code>var result = this.Database.SqlQuery&lt;TEntity&gt;(commandText, parameters).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>which according to a trace, executes:</p>

<pre><code>exec sp_executesql N'StockistSearch',N'@searchLat float,@searchLng float',@searchLat=53.29,@searchLng=-3.72
</code></pre>

<p>which results in a completely different (and wrong) result for the calculated distance, (it returns distance 3688.96 miles!)</p>

<p>I've stepped through the code in debug and the parameters are being entered correctly and have confirmed that the exec sp_executesql is giving a different result that the EXEC when ran directly in the SQL server management studio</p>

<p>I'm completely at a loss as to why this is happening and although the stored procedure seems to be functioning correctly, the results showing through the application are completely wrong.</p>

<p>Please can someone please give me some advice before I go mad!!</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>Thanks for all the comments so far and thanks to @McKay, I've narrowed it down to it ignoring the input parameters when called from exec sp_executesql and is using the defaults 0 for both latitude and longitude. If i remove the defaults, I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>Procedure or function 'StockistSearch' expects parameter '@searchLat', which was not supplied.
</code></pre>

<p>The SQL query is</p>

<pre><code>exec sp_executesql N'StockistSearch', N'@searchLat real, @searchLng real',@searchLat=53.29,@searchLng=-3.72
</code></pre>

<p>This sql is automatically generate by the entity framework (code-first MVC EF doesn't currently support stored procedures but should be able to query stored procedures using the following in the DbContext:) </p>

<pre><code>var result = this.Database.SqlQuery&lt;TEntity&gt;(commandText, parameters).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>Would greatly appreciate any further help</p>

<h1>FIXED :-)</h1>

<p>When calling :</p>

<pre><code>var result = this.Database.SqlQuery&lt;TEntity&gt;(commandText, parameters).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>The command text has to have the parameters appended to it so</p>

<pre><code>commandText = ""StockistSearch @searchLat,@searchLng""
</code></pre>

<p>so the resulting sql is;</p>

<pre><code>exec sp_executesql N'StockistSearch @searchLat,@searchLng', N'@searchLat real, @searchLng real',@searchLat=53.29,@searchLng=-3.72

<p>It now accepts the input parameters and calculates the correct distance</p>

<p>I'm making basically a Facebook feed reader. It gets the JSON data from an API call and uses that to populate a ListView. Each time the custom adapter calls the getView() method, it checks to see what type of ""status"" it is. If it's a ""photo"" status, the view will have two images (a profile picture and the picture of the status update). I'm using nostra13's Universal Image Loader to load both images after inflating the ImageViews using a holder class to help recycle views. That's where I think my problem exists.</p>

<p>When I scroll through the list, all the profile pictures load fine and work great. But as I scroll, the status photos do a couple things:</p>

<p>1.) The all load the same image (I didn't have this problem before but I gave it to myself trying to fix the others).</p>

<p>2.) The images jump around and either disappear or appear in different views than they're supposed to.</p>

<p>3.) If the images load correctly and don't all show the same image, the images change as I scroll up and down, eventually all becoming the same image.</p>

<p>I'll post my getView() code (sorry it's kind of long).</p>

<p>I'm sure it has something to do with Android recycling views and being efficient, but I can't figure out where I'm making the error. It's also weird that the problem only exists for the one image view. Any help would be hot. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  We discovered it was an error with my JSON parsing. You have to use setTag() to retain the image specific to that line item. The adapter was trying to set a tag of null to the view, which caused the NPE.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE AGAIN:</strong> After digging some more, it looks like it's the ImageView itself that's giving a null value as if it isn't finding the correct layout. I was using two different xml layouts for the different types of posts. So now it looks like the best solution would be to use the same layout and just conditionally inflate different elements in each view depending on the status type.</p>

<p>For the first few cells it's okay and control is displayed fine but when you scroll then for later cells it showing wrong number of stars but in place.Rating there is right number. I set break point and code and values look fine. Maybe it's something with lazy loading and using this control but I don't know how to fix this. I find out that it depends on shown stars at few first rows. There is pattern. In my screen first 4 cells are shown and has right number of stars (5th cell is not shown but it has right number too) and then these 5 rating are repeating and 6th has same rating as 1st but it's wrong and same goes for 7th (has same as 2nd) and so. I set other things in cellForRowAtIndexPath like image and so and it's okay. It's just these rating controls. I tried to force some redraw with commented methods at first example code but it didn't help.</p>

All the provisioning profiles are matching the bundle name of our app. We use TestFlight for distribution although I don't think it's the problem. </p>

<p>We have only managed to get it to work on iOS 7 devices that didn't have the app installed earlier. Not a single iOS 8 device worked ad hoc. The errors we were getting in the beginning were 25300 (errSecItemNotFound) and now after resetting provisioning profiles we are getting a plain 0 (both on saving on loading and still no data can be retrieved).

<p>What I am trying to do is run an async method in a triggered event [EventEmitter], but such a simple thing seems to be just simply not possible as I can find. </p>

<p>Consider the following...</p>

<pre><code>// Your basic async method..
function doSomething(callback) {
    var obj = { title: 'hello' };

    // Fire an event for event handlers to alter the object.
    // EvenEmitters are called synchronously
    eventobj.emit('alter_object', obj);

    callback(null, obj);
}

// when this event is fired, I want to manipulate the data
eventobj.on('alter_object', function(obj) {
    obj.title += "" world!"";

    // Calling this async function here means that our
    // event handler will return before our data is retrieved.
    somemodule.asyncFunction(callback(err, data) {
        obj.data = data;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the last few lines,  the event handler will finish before the object's data property is added.</p>

<p>What I need is something where I can turn the async function into an sync function and get the results there and then.   so for example...</p>

<pre><code>obj.data = somemodule.asyncFunction();
</code></pre>

<p>I've looked at the <code>wait.for</code> module, the <code>async</code> module, and none of these will not work.  I've even looked into the <code>yield</code> method, but it seems not yet fully implemented into the V8 engine.</p>

<p>I've also tried using a <code>while</code> loop too wait for data to populate, but this just brings with it the CPU overload issue.</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced this and found a design pattern to get around this?</p>

<p>In order to make my app portable, I need to understand if <strong>the mapping between Security Roles and principals / users</strong> can be defined in the app server itself, or in the application source code, without using the app-server-specific deployment descriptor <code>glassfish-web.xml</code> or equivalent. This would avoid the deployer's task of editing the <code>.war</code> file, which is something I'd like, since the application has to be portable.</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.validator.addMethod(""uniqueemail"", function(email) {

<p>jQuery validator will use this method before submitting the field to check if it is valid (in addition the the rules set above), however if one of the <code>addMethod</code>'s validates to false, it will use the message for that item set above in the validate method, and not the message passed into <code>addMethod</code>.

<p>The table is created as follows:</p>

<pre><code>create table mytable (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, myvalue DOUBLE, updateTime INTEGER )
</code></pre>

<p>I can insert new rows properly. When I inspect the database with <code>SQLite Browser</code>, I can clearly see the values are correctly inserted.</p>

<p>Now there is a command line project utilizing the database wrapper class. When I run this program all double values are correctly fetched.</p>

<p>In another project, being a <code>WPF</code> application, I'm using the very same database access wrapper library. But in this case, the <code>double</code> values are totally messed up.</p>

<p>When I put in <strong>14.28</strong> it reads out <strong>-5.1897674825990524E-306</strong>.
I guess there is just some problem of double representation here, but I do not know how to solve it.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> <code>Command Line</code> works, <code>WPF</code> doesn't.</p>

I have just seen, that every time I read the values out, the bogus value is changing. So there is some other mystical base.</p>

I then have a bit of text that displays under the second dropdown box once a selection has been made, and what the text says is unique to whatever selection is made.</p>

<p>What I want to be able to do is have this information directly publish into a table that will be included at the bottom of the same page the form is located on, once a user hits the submit button. In other words, when a user submits the form, I don't want it to simply spit the user's info back to them; I want the info to actually publish to the page in a table, so that anyone who logs in can see it, and can add their own published info to the table as well.</p>

<p>You could think of it sort of like a blog commenting system that automatically publishes new content to the page every time a visitor submits the form, except, instead of text areas that allow users to insert whatever they want, I have dropdown boxes that only allow them to select a certain option, and then have that selected info publish to a table.</p>

<p>How would I go about doing this? I have a beginner's knowledge of PHP, and almost no knowledge of javascript. But depending on how detailed and helpful of an answer that may be provided, I could work with either.</p>

<p>This form is only accessible to members who are logged in, and I have 6 bits of info that I want to have published into a row of 6 columns in the table every time a user hits Submit. Those 6 things are: (1) Username, (2) Time Stamp (Date &amp; Time at which the form was submitted), (3) Selection result of 1st Dropdown, (4) Selection result of 2nd Dropdown, (5) The unique text that is displayed according to whichever selection is made in the 2nd dropdown, and (6) a second time stamp which is calculated as 30 days beyond the time generated in the 2nd column.</p>

<p>This is a personal project made for an online gaming clan (in EVE Online), with all of maybe 20 unique visitors a month, so quality and proper coding technique is not much of an issue (not at this point anyway). The primary concern is simply that it will work.</p>

<p>The reason I suggested posting a PHP table rather than taking the javascript route is because I already have a table created in a database (and I'm also more familiar with PHP and just want to get the first version of this online ASAP), and I already have it posting to the website as well, as you'll see on the above page. This is the ""workorders"" table.</p>

<p>You'll notice upon logging in that there are instructions on the index page referring to a dropdown box, which does not yet exist. The dropdown box will consist of 49 ""jobs"" to select from. When a user selects an option and submits the form, I want their selection to insert into the ""job"" field of the workorders table on my database; and, I also want the site to detect the additional information in the other 8 fields in order to automatically insert them as well.</p>

<p>I've been experimenting with one idea, but I'm not sure if it would work, or how to do it exactly. In my members and jobs tables, I've included a ""rank_id"" field, in which each entry will have a matching value to the ""id"" field in the ranks table. Now, there are 49 ""jobs"" to choose from, however, depending on what rank a user is, their job salary will vary (given that there are 7 ranks, 49 * 7 = 343 total possible job/salary combinations that can result from the form submission). What I want the site to do is detect the logged in user's ""rank_id"" (in the members table), and after the user selects a job from the drop down, find the corresponding job in the jobs table that has the same ""rank_id"". That, I'm assuming, would allow the site to gather the ""User"", ""Rank"", ""1st Requirement"", ""2nd Requirement"", ""3rd Requirement"", and ""Salary"" info (all of which are contained in the members and jobs tables), and then insert that info into the appropriate fields in the workorders table, so that the info will then post to the site.</p>

<p>At that point all I would need to worry about are the ""Date"" and ""Due By"" columns - the ""date"" being automatically generated as the current date when the form is submitted, and the ""due by"" being automatically calculated as the current date plus 30 days.</p>

<p>I hope that's a more helpful explanation, and not too confusing.</p>

I get exception - <strong>""DBD::ODBC::db begin_work failed: Already in a transaction""</strong>. Now i do not have any way of modifying the call_method_for_table* methods since it is in a library and modifying it is not possible due to many reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Can i use checkpoints to solve this problem</strong></p>

<li>Is it fine even when there are parallel runs of the same process ?</li>

However, Java is displaying some words improperly. They seem to take the correct form but are not combined correctly. Here is the result of a JOptionPane.showMessageDialog</p>

<p>[1] (Edit: Link below, low rep doesn't let me add pics)</p>

<p>Those letters are M-S-J-D written left to right - and note the last two J and D did in fact combin ۔م س ج د</p>

<p>Here is the correct formation when written in NotePad with the Urdu Typesetting font (which is the same font I am using in my program
)۔</p>

<p>[2] (Edit: Link below)</p>

<p>At first I thought it was because the letters from my keyboard were different than the unicode (\uXXXX) escape commands; especially since you can see the letters from each don't take exactly the same shape if they were to be combined. I used my keyboard's Urdu setting to type in NotePad where that doesn't work in JCreator; I was using the escape commands.</p>

<p>However I looked up the unicode for keyboard's Urdu setting and they were exactly the same as the codes I was using in JCreator. I then tried using Netbeans because it encodes in UTF-8 (JCreator uses Cp1252), this time I typed the letters directly into the code instead of using the escape command and got exactly the same result in the first image above.</p>

<p>Not all words have this behavior either. Baba ب ا ب ا
combines correctly.</p>

<p>Why isn't Java combining these words correctly and how can I fix it? Thanks in advance!</p>

And last week i thougt i cracked the nut, but unfortunately not....</p>

<p>so i want to create a CSV download for other users to open up in MS-Word (they want the CSV format)</p>

<p>so i end up with this code in a MVC2 controller:</p>

<pre><code>Response.AddHeader(""Content-Disposition"", ""attachment; filename=PersonalMessages.csv"");
Response.ContentType = ""application/csv"";
string s = new DownloadService().GetAddresses();
Response.Write(s);
Response.End();
return null;
</code></pre>

<p>the string 's' contains (among other info) these chars: é å æ É à</p>

<p>When i open it in notepad: OK</p>

<p>when i open it in Notepad++: Ok</p>

<p>when i open it up in Excel: Not ok, it shows this:   Ã© Ã¥ Ã¦ Ã‰ Ã </p>

<p>(when i open it up in Notepadd++, it says it is in UTF8 encoding without BOM, whatever i tried with UTF8 encodings with booleans in the constructor to get the BOM in, it didn;t work out)</p>

<p>So i asked a question last week, and the answer was to let the GetAddresses() function return a byte array.</p>

<p>So i did convert my text using this:</p>

<pre><code>// C# to convert a string to a byte array.
public static byte[] StrToByteArray(string str)
{
    System.Text.UnicodeEncoding encoding = new System.Text.UnicodeEncoding();
    return encoding.GetBytes(str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>, and wrote the byte array in the response and all was fine! Notepad, notepad++ and Excel!
Great, live is good.</p>

<p>But then i found out they we're opening up the file in Word. Well, no problem i thought.</p>

<p>But then they aid: Word can not open the file (diretly), <strong>it asks for the encoding first</strong>, and that is a problem because they are using it in an automated process.</p>

<p>When they open the file in Notepad and save it as unicode, all goes well.</p>

<p>I've also tried this in the action method:</p>

<pre><code>Response.ContentEncoding = Encoding.Unicode ;
Response.HeaderEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;
</code></pre>

<p>but that didn't help out.</p>

<p>Does anybody has any clue?</p>

<p>I`m trying to create an Augmented Reality application by detecting markers in a scene. In order to do that, I need to do heavy processing on an image. I do that in onCameraFrame() method at every frame, but the image processing holds up the thread and camera feels laggy with low fps. So I try to put image processing part to the background by using AsyncTask. I have found an example of AsyncTask in CameraCalibrationActivity and by following it I try to replicate the code, but after launching the application it crashes and the error is Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0x00000028 (code=1), thread 16291 (AsyncTask #5). Also, if I try to implement AsyncTask in other way, the app is ran successfully, but the FPS is still low (the FPS increase is like 2 FPS). I will post both of the implementations. If anyone has any suggestions, experiences - please post.</p>

<p>Implementation like in CameraCalibrationActivity():</p>

<pre><code>public Mat onCameraFrame(CvCameraViewFrame inputFrame) 
{
    mRgba = inputFrame.rgba();

    new AsyncTask&lt;Void, Void, Void&gt;() 
    {
        @Override
        protected Void doInBackground(Void... arg0) 
        {
            MarkerDetector.detect(mRgba, detectedMarkers, CameraParameters, (float) 0.14, mRgba);
            return null;
        }
    }.execute();

    return mRgba;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My own implementation with seter methods on child class:</p>

<pre><code>public class MarkerDetector extends AsyncTask&lt;Void, Void, Void&gt;
{
    private Mat inGlobal;
    private Vector&lt;Marker&gt; detectedMarkersGlobal;
    private CameraParameters cameraParametersGlobal;

    public void detect(Mat in, Vector&lt;Marker&gt; detectedMarkers, CameraParameters cp,float markerSizeMeters, Mat frameDebug)
    {
        // image processing code here
    }

    public void setInputFrameMatrix(Mat _in)
    {
        inGlobal = _in;
    }

    public void setDetectedMarkers(Vector&lt;Marker&gt; _detectedMarkers)
    {
        detectedMarkersGlobal = _detectedMarkers;
    }

    public void setCameraParameters(CameraParameters _cameraParameters)
    {

    {

<p>A typical use case is when an activity starts, it connects to a back end server and waits until the server sends back a message, then notifies javascript to make UI updates. How should it be done in Cordova?</p>

<pre><code>JkMount /path ajp13
</code></pre>

<p>Now we're using <code>mod_proxy_ajp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ProxyPass /path ajp://localhost:8009/path
ProxyPassReverse /path ajp://localhost:8009/path
</code></pre>

<p>However, there's a feature that <code>JkMount</code> offered but <code>ProxyPass</code> doesn't: the ability to select on file types. This made it possible to proxy html files, but not images - in other words, to let the nice fast Apache serve the static stuff, and resorting to the slow Tomcat only for the dynamic stuff.</p>

<pre><code>JkMount /*.html ajp13
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way of achieving this with <code>ProxyPass</code>? Possibly using a surrounding <code>&lt;Location&gt;</code> directive or something like that?</p>

<p>At work, we have several self-developed control libraries for the .NET Compact Framework. Under Windows XP 32-bit I was able to store them in a folder C:\owncontrols and add the folder to</p>

<pre><code>[HKLM\...\Microsoft\.NETCompactFramework\VERSION\WindowsCE\AssemblyFoldersEx\COMPANYNAME]
</code></pre>

<p>The folder structure is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>c:\owncontrols\libname\2.0\dllname.dll
c:\owncontrols\libname\2.0\dllname.wm5.dll
c:\owncontrols\libname\3.5\dllname.dll
c:\owncontrols\libname\3.5\dllname.wm5.dll
</code></pre>

<p>The DLLs all have the same version number. After putting the entries into the registry, I was able to add the controls to the toolbox and Visual Studio would choose the correct DLL depending on the framework version and the type of device (WM5 or WinCE 5).</p>

<p>Under Windows 7 I'm not able to do this, somehow. I found the registry entries under <code>WOW6432Node</code> node in <code>HLKM\Software</code> and made the entries just the same as under XP, but  the controls don't show up in Visual Studio when I'm trying to add them to the toolbox.</p>

<p>So maybe I'm doing it all wrong? How would I add the controls as described for XP? Please note that installing to the GAC is not an option here - these libraries change frequently.</p>

<p>I really liked the feature that Visual Studio selected the right DLL depending on framework version and project type. I tried adding the DLLs manually, but then I see all the controls doubled.</p>

I'm aware of this gradle <a href=""https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-tomcat-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">plugin</a> that support tomcat deployment but at the moment it doesn't support tomcat 8 yet. So I decided to use ant from gradle.</p>

            include(name: '*.jar')
        }

<p>I am re-sizing my image so that it is scaled to be full page on the printout when I print this the image is cropped slightly.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>I <em>am</em> using the margins to calculate the area to use:</p>

<pre><code>With printSettings.DefaultPageSettings
    Dim areaWidth As Single = .Bounds.Width - .Margins.Left - .Margins.Right
    Dim areaHeight As Single = .Bounds.Height - .Margins.Top - .Margins.Bottom
End With
</code></pre>

<p>The bounds of the page are 1169x827 (A4) and with the margins it is 1137x795.</p>

<p>After resize my image size is 1092x682 and I am using the following code to draw it:
    <code>e.Graphics.DrawImage(printBitmap, .Margins.Left, .Margins.Top)</code></p>

<p>The annoying thing is that when I print to the PrintPreviewDialog it is scaled perfectly but when I print the exact same code to the actual printer it does not fit.</p>

<p>Full code can be found at <a href=""http://pastebin.com/HxsbEYg0"" rel=""nofollow"">this url</a>

In particular, if you have multi-column sort and search capabilities, how do you handle fetching (and pre-fetching) the data, client side model binding (for display), and caching the data.</p>

<p>I would imagine a good solution would be doing some thoughtful work in the background. For instance, initially, if the table was displaying N items, it might fetch 2N items, return the data for the user, and then go fetch the next 2N items in the background (even if the user hasn't requested this). As the user made search/sort changes, it would throw out (or maybe even cache the initial base case), and do similar functionality.</p>

<p>Can you share the best solutions you have seen?</p>

<p>Jquery is replacing elements on the page, and it creates form where user can update his data. (this is working fine, update without the image part is working). When I try to update image, I get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You did not select a file to upload</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also have form to create new user, which use </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>function person_img_upload()</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and it is working fine (form is not created via jquery). What seems to be a problem? </p>

<p>I fixed this by implementing a orientation check within viewDidLoad in the first Viewcontroller after my Appdelegate. For every orientation I saved a value. When performing shouldAutorotate: I first check for the saved value which disables orientation changes.</p>

<p>Solution in code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    NSUserDefaults * defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
    if (UIDeviceOrientationIsLandscape([UIDevice currentDevice].orientation)) {
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setInteger:1 forKey:@""PortraitLandscapeIndicator""];
    }
    else {
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setInteger:0 forKey:@""PortraitLandscapeIndicator""];
}

- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation {
    //the latest saved orientation is our orientation
    if([[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] integerForKey:@""PortraitLandscapeIndicator""] == 1){
         return ((interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft) || (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight));
    }
    else{
        return ((interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait) || (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown));

    }

}

I am creating a basic C# program that, among other things, will uninstall and reinstall the most current version of a program (I can't build this functionality into the program itself). The way I am doing it is by:</p>

<pre><code>MsiExec.exe /X{[UninstallString]} /passive
</code></pre>

<p>in a command prompt process. I have a couple of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Obviously you don't know the history of the program (I don't either to tell you the truth), but is that uninstall string generally the same every time for every version? Does it change? </li>
<li>Is there any possible way that the uninstallstring could accidentally be a different program's string on another computer? I don't want to uninstall anything else.</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically I just want to know if this is safe. If not, or if there is a better way to do this programatically, let me know! Thanks!</p>

Each technology has specific syntax and stuff, but - roughly - used for CPU parallel programming. But they have different effect. I know that, for instance, MPI and OpenMP used for different memory models.</p>

<p>I also know that the choice of a technology is not actually exclusive so another one can be used (again, MPI and OpenMP). How come they are used for different effect but still working with the same source (CPU)?</p>

<p>What the difference would be (from the operation system and hardware point of view) if I compile a C++ program with parallelism based on each of those technologies? Does, for example, OpenMP or <code>std::thread</code> use POSIX threads? If so, how does C++11's threads work on Windows? Or does each of these technologies work directly with CPU via assembly language or something?</p>

<p>I'll try to put it in a question. The thing I don't understand: what these technologies based on so they have different effect while having equivalent aim? Or is even the effect eventually stays the same?</p>

    if(!$match) { return $input; }

<p>I need the function to work with an array of different words supporting a space in the search.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>$search = array(""this needs"", ""here"", ""can high-light the text"");</code></p>

<p><code>$string = ""This needs to be in here so that the search variable can high-light the text"";</code></p>

<p>Obviously this doesn't work and I'm not sure how to get this to work (regular expression are not my strong point).</p>

<p>Another point that may be a problem, how would the function deal with a multiple match? Such as <code>$search = array(""in here"", ""here so"");</code> as the result would be something like:</p>

<p><code>This needs to be &lt;strong&gt;in &lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt; so&lt;/strong&gt; that the search variable can high-light the text</code></p>

<p>Thanks Akatum
You said "" </p>

<p>In your grid configuration you need to setup listener for itemclick event, which is fired when user click on row in grid. In this listener you need to get information about layer from row record. Then you can find layer node in tree by Ext.data.TreeStore getNodeById method and set its checked attribute to true</p>

<p>So in your grid configuration you will have:</p>

<pre><code> listeners: {

itemclick: function(c, record) {
    // get layer id from clicked row record
    var layerId = record.get('layerId');

    // find layer node in tree by layer id
    var node = layerTree.getStore().getNodeById(layerId);

    // set node checked attribute to true
    node.set('checked', true);
}


}""

<p>The <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2"" rel=""nofollow"">appropriate RFC</a> says this should be idempotent but to my mind the user expectation will be that they are clicking a link to take an action.</p>

<p>I've implemented this so that the link takes you to a page that has a big confirm button which then updates your subscription, confirms that and displays the final state of your account (we have more than one type of subscription)</p>

<p>But I wonder if it would not be a better UX if the person simply skipped the confirm button stage...</p>

<p>The answer to the question ""Am I overthinking this?"" is definitely yes but I wondered what people's views were on balancing the best practice of an idempotent GET with the best practice of not confounding user's expectations...</p>

<p>But if for whatever reason the DB dump jobs fails to complete for a while, all dumps will eventually be thrown away. So as a safeguard i want to keep at least the youngest Y=7 dumps, even it all or some of them are older than 21 days.</p>

<p>I look for something that is more elegant than this spaghetti:</p>

<pre><code>DB_DUMP_DIR=/var/backups/dbs

find ${DB_DUMP_DIR} -type f -printf '%T@ %p\n' | \  # list all dumps with epoch

<p>(This snippet might have minor bugs - Ignore them. It's to illustrate what i can come up with myself, and why i don't like it)</p>

"11803807","1","11804493","","2012-08-03 21:53:50","","1","236","<p>In the d3 docs on transitions, it says that <code>transition.select(selector)</code> is approximately equivalent to <code>selection.select(selector).transition()</code> saying that the sub-transition version inherits easing, duration and delay from the current transition.</p>

<p>My observation from using both approaches is that sub-transitions must actually have a slightly deeper relationship with the parent transition than the docs imply.  What I've seen is that if I have 2 transitions that are very closely related to each other, I <em>must</em> use a sub-transition to get both transitions to run perfectly together.</p>

<p>Here's a contrived example to illustrate the point (although this is simple enough that it would possibly not show the problem in reality).  Say I have this in my DOM:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;g&gt;
        &lt;circle&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
    &lt;/g&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Transition 1 runs on <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> and applies a ""transform=translate(100,0)"" to move it horizontally.</p>

<p>Transition 2 runs on <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> and simply reverses this by applying a ""transform=translate(-100, 0)"" to move it back horizontally the other way.</p>

<p>The expected result is that the circle does not move at all.  But what I actually see depends on how the transitions are set up.  If I use 2 separate transitions configured with identical properties for duration and so on, I see the circle appear to jitter just slightly.  Presumably this is because the intermediate values passed into the transition interpolators are slightly out of sync.</p>

<p>However, if I use sub-transitions to set up the 2 transitions, it looks perfect.</p>

<p>My question is about the relationship between a transition and a sub-transition.  What is the difference in terms of timing and interpolation between using separate transitions versus using sub-transitions?</p>

Sorry must have clarified its a asp.net page, the resulting code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_JobAdmin1_pnlConfirmPanel"").dialog(
                        {

                        })

<p>If I remove modal:true, the dialog box shows and closes fine in both IE6 and IE7. Its when I add the modal:true line, that causes the browser to crash...</p>

"2231306","1","2232807","","2010-02-09 18:07:18","","0","2106","<p>I have an asp.net web app that uses forms-based authentication, a SqlMembershipProvider (using an encrypted password format), and a SqlRoleProvider. I need to know if it's possible to administer the users (create new users, assign them to roles, etc.) from a windows application - the powers that be don't want any administrative functionality in the web app itself.</p>

<p>Here is the membership provider definition from web.config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;membership defaultProvider=""MyProvider""&gt;
  &lt;providers&gt;
    &lt;add name=""MyProvider""
         type=""System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider, System.Web, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a""
         connectionStringName=""MyConnectionString""
         enablePasswordRetrieval=""false""
         enablePasswordReset=""true""
         requiresQuestionAndAnswer=""true""
         applicationName=""/MyWebApp""
         requiresUniqueEmail=""true""
         passwordFormat=""Encrypted""
         maxInvalidPasswordAttempts=""5""
         minRequiredPasswordLength=""7""
         minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters=""1""
         passwordAttemptWindow=""10""
         passwordStrengthRegularExpression=""""/&gt;
  &lt;/providers&gt;
&lt;/membership&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the role manager definition:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;roleManager enabled=""true"" defaultProvider=""MyRoleManager""&gt;
  &lt;providers&gt;
    &lt;add name=""MyRoleManager""
         type=""System.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvider""
         connectionStringName=""MyConnectionString""
         applicationName=""/MyWebApp"" /&gt;
  &lt;/providers&gt;
&lt;/roleManager&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the machineKey definition (necessary to be able to use encrypted passwords):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;machineKey
    validationKey=""BC50A82A6AF6A015C34C7946D29B817C00F04D2AB10BC2128D1E2433D0E365E426E57337CECAE9A0681A2C736B9779B42F75D60F09F142C60E9E0E8F9840DB46""
      decryptionKey=""122035576C5476DCD8F3611954C837CDA5FE33BCDBBF23F7""
      validation=""SHA1""
      decryption=""AES""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, obviously, I have a Sql Server database that contains the users and roles for the web app. I'd like to create a separate windows app that references the web app assembly, and use the configured MembershipProvider, RoleProvider, and machineKey to create users, assign users to roles, etc. If that's not possible, I can duplicate the configuration settings from web.config within the windows app. But I don't know how to do this either.</p>

<p>Am I way out of line thinking that this is possible? I've tried googling for a solution, but the signal-to-noise ratio is really bad.</p>

<p>On my test platform the function returns a subclass of <code>ByteBuffer</code> so the cast works, but making this assumption for all platforms or Android versions supporting OpenGL-ES 3+ doesn't seem very safe.

I'm using a web hosting service, so the root directory isn't on my computer. So, inside public_html I have /js/ javascript files and /css/ CSS files. In the root folder I have my home page etc, but I want to put the store's page in /store/storehome.php. I'm using .php so that I can include the header.html and footer.html files which are located in /includes/. All the JS and CSS files are not mine, and I'm just editing them to serve my desires. </p>

<p>The issue is that the storehome.php file will not format correctly. I don't fully understand what it's missing (I'm new to this) but I assume it's not seeing the CSS file. </p>

<p>I've been referencing the CSS through the header file, and it seems to work for the normal root files. This is part of the header file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;

<p>And no matter what, even if I do /css/style.css or ../css/style.css or the domain like above, nothing works. The weird thing is that if I comment out the lines referencing the CSS, my root files will still be correctly displayed, even though they never reference the CSS file other than in the header. Does this have something to do with the .js files? I have no idea how they work and I havent touched them. Thanks!</p>

<p>I didn't add <code>$captcha_instance-&gt;remove( $prefix );</code> so far because it works not as it should. It seems that every time I click on the submit button a new word is created and the function <code>$captcha_instance-&gt;check()</code> checks if the new word equals the captcha text in the input field but those words doesn't match of course because it's already a new word. I don't understand why a new word is created when clicking on the submit button. Where is the error?</p>

<p>The JSON needs to be read, lookups need to be performed on certain ""fields"" in the JSON and then the result of these lookups needs to be inserted into a MySQL database.</p>

<p>At the moment, it is taking hours to process this file and I think that it is because I am inserting and commiting on each row instead of using executemany, however I'm struggling to work out how best to approach this because I need to do the lookups as part of the process and then insert into multiple tables.</p>

<p>The process is effectively as follows:</p>

<p>1) Iterate over the file, reading each line as we go</p>

<p>2) For each line, work out if it needs to be inserted into the database</p>

<p>3) If the line does need to be inserted into the database, look up foreign keys for various JSON fields and replace them with the FK id</p>

<p>4) Insert the ""new"" line into the database.</p>

<p>The issue comes at (3) as there are some cases where the FK id is <em>created</em> by an insert of a subset of the data.</p>

<p>In short, I need to do a mass insert of a nested data structure with various parts of the nested data needing to be inserted into different tables whilst maintaining referential integrity.</p>

<p>Thanks for all and any help,</p>

<p>I want to make the edges of the 'f' and 'l' stretch to the edge of the page.  I'm just expanding the height of two images that sandwich the word.</p>

<p>I want the word itself to stay put, and I don't want the expanding images to displace any other elements.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to achieve this? I imagine it has to do with positioning correctly, but I still don't have a full grasp of the subtleties of CSS positioning.</p>

<p>I didn't get any good answers so far, so I've decided to write my own little script that will change width of the event based on the number of overlapping events. </p>

<p><strong>I want to avoid overlapping of the boxes and want them to stack.</strong>  </p>

<p>Here's the initial test:  </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pIlA6.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">  </p>

<p>Below is a basic script with description:</p>

<pre><code>    $('[class^=""tg-col""]').each(function(){ // each day column 
                                           //(Mon, Tue, etc. has class tg-col or tg-col-weekend.
    var ItemArray = [];
    $(this).find("".chip"").each(function(){ //each event box has chip class.

    var top = $$(this).position().top;  //Get top pixels
    var bottom = $$(this).height() + top;  //get end of the event.
    var arr = ItemArray.push({
        class: $$(this).attr(""class"").split("" "")[0], 
        start : top, 
        end:bottom
         }); 
    });
    var result = getOverlaps(ItemArray); //get overlaps counts number of overlapping events.
    $$.each(result, function(index, value){ 
      var ec = result[index].eventCount;
      var w = 100/result[index].eventCount-1 + ""%"";
    var el = $$("".""+result[index].class);
      el.width(w);
    //el.css(""left"",w);
        });
    });
function getOverlaps(events) {
    // sort events
    events.sort(function (a, b) {
        return a.start - b.start;
    });

    var results = [];
    for (var i = 0, l = events.length; i &lt; l; i++) {
        var oEvent = events[i];
        var nOverlaps = 0;
        for (var j = 0; j &lt; l; j++) {
            var oCompareEvent = events[j];
            if (oCompareEvent.start &lt;= oEvent.end &amp;&amp; oCompareEvent.end &gt; oEvent.start || oCompareEvent.end &lt;= oEvent.start &amp;&amp; oCompareEvent.start &gt; oEvent.end) {
                nOverlaps++;
            }
        }
        if (nOverlaps &gt; 1) {
            results.push({
                class: oEvent.class,
                eventCount: nOverlaps
            });
        }

    }
    return results;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This solution works only on simple events (on the left):</strong><br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NkGeQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For more complex overlapping we cannot simply count numbers of overlaps and diving 100% / number of overlaps. We have to take into considerations other dimensions.   </p>

<p>Also, after each manipulation in google calendar it redraws events and script changes are lost. Is there easier way to solve this problem?<br>
(Maybe it is possible to modify js received from google directly? (But it's minified :().</p>

We have many other libraries, one of which uses NHibernate for the database.  It all works fine, the library gets the data back.</p>

<p>When we add a reference to this new library which uses Solrnet, things start to go arwy.  The first error that occurs when we run the application. when the application runs the StructureMap registry for the library using NHibernate, the registry blows up because NHibernate can't load the Castle.Core assembly (which has not caused any problems being missing prior to adding the reference).  If we then ensure that Castle.Core is present, NHibernate then blows up trying to load Castle.Windsor, which again it didn't need before.</p>

<p>Any ideas?  As I said, the library which uses NHibernate is fine if we remove the new library which uses Solrnet, but as soon as we reference it things start to go wrong.  The library which uses Solrnet also configures Solrnet using StructureMap, FWIW.</p>

<p>EDIT:  These are the versions of various assemblies in the mix.
StructureMap - 2.6.1.0
Fluent NHibernate - 1.0.0.0
NHibernate - 2.1.2.4000
Solrnet - 0.3.1.0
Castle.Core (came with NH) - 1.1.0.0</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Its starting to look like Solrnet is the one trying to load Castle.Windsor.  I'm not sure why as we've given it a StructureMap configuartion.  Its mere presence is enough to blow things up.  Even without the assemblies which depend on Solrnet, the fact that its there at all seems to mess with the NHibernate configuration.</p>

<pre><code>http://http//example.com/a9noaa.asp

<p>It is clearly incorrect (<code>http</code> comes twice) URL so when one clicks on it there is a page error like ""Address not found"".</p>

<p>But when one copies the link location and pastes it in the browser’s location bar, it loads that new page correctly. So it’s the problem of incorrect URL being mentioned in the hyperlink.</p>

<p>Will it be possible to make browser check for basic sanity of the URL being accessed like checking that:</p>

<ul>
<li>word <code>http</code> is present only once,</li>
<li>colon is typed correct,</li>
<li>no unusual character at beginning of URL,</li>
<li>double backlashes are correctly present, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or that the URL being typed in the address bar and automatically correct the errors in it?</p>

<p>Can any client side code be present to make a internet browser achieve this functionality? Is it possible?</p>

<p>Or are there any plugins for popular browsers (Firefox, IE) already available to achieve this?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

However, I can't figure out how to make it work. I am creating the URL to post to with the usual blobstoreService.createUploadUrl() command.</p>

<p>One possibility for posting my string to the blobstore url is to use jQuery.ajax:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.ajax({url:blobstore_url,contentType:'multipart/form-data',type:'POST',data:{file:mystring}})
</code></pre>

<p>However, when i run this command I get the AppEngine error ""java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"". Googling this error suggests my form data is missing the required ""name"" attribute, but I cannot figure out how to specify this using jQuery.ajax.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to use the browser's FormData object:</p>

<pre><code>   formData = new FormData()
   formData.append(""file"",my_string)
   xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()
   xhr.open(""POST"", blobstore_url)
   xhr.send(formData)
</code></pre>

<p>This runs fine, but then when my ""success"" url is triggered by the blobstore in my AppEngine server app, the list of posted blobs is empty. I assume I can't just append my_string to the formData as a file object but need to do something else instead.</p>

<p>I know I'm extremely close to having this working, but am missing some important little detail. If any of you can help me figure out how to fix either of the two approaches above I would be elated- Thanks!</p>

<p>We're looking for a simple solution to simplify taking web apps online and offline when a server is undergoing maintenance.  The idea is that we be able to mark a server as unavailable, and then mark all dependent (direct and indirect) as offline.</p>

<p>Our first proof-of-concept is running, and we created an aspx page that lists various applications that have an App_Offline.html file with a friendly ""Down for Maintenance"" message in a GridView.  In the GridView, each app has a LinkButton that, when clicked, either renames the App_Offline.htm to App_Offline.html or vice-versa to take the app online and offline.  </p>

<p>The next step is to set up all of our dependencies.  For example, our store locater would be dependent on our web services, which in turn are dependent on our SQL Server.  (that's a simple example.  We can easily have several layers, or one app dependent on multiple servers, etc.)  In this example, if the SQL server goes down, we would need to drill down recursively to find all apps that depend on it, and then turn them off and on by renaming the App_Offline file appropriately.</p>

<p>I realize this will be relatively simple to build, but could be complex to manage.  I'm sure we're not the first team to think of this concept, and I'm wondering if there are any open source tools, or if any of you have done something similar and can help us avoid pitfalls.</p>

<p><em><strong>Edit - Update</em></strong></p>

<p>I found the category of software I'm looking for.  it's called CMDB - (Configuration Management Database), and it's generally more of a Network Admin type tool than a developer tool.  I found some open source products in this category, but none written in .NET.  </p>

<p>I had considered moving this question to ServerFault.com when I realized I was looking for a netowrk Admin type tool, but since I'm looking for code and a modifiable solution I'll keep the question here.</p>

<p>I'm working on a django app that I had previously downloaded via pip, but have removed and cloned from git so I can add extra functionality. The modules name is <code>popolo</code>, and I can't import the <code>admin</code> module from it.</p>

<p>The directory structure shows this:</p>

<pre><code>legostormtroopr@cloud9:~/workspace $ ls popolo/
__init__.py   admin.py   behaviors/  models.py  querysets.py
templates/  tests.py  urls.py  views.py
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>admin.py</code> and <code>views.py</code> are both there, but when I try this:</p>

<pre><code>import popolo
class PersonModelAdmin(popolo.admin.PersonAdmin):
    pass # more code
</code></pre>

<p>I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>  File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/importlib/__init__.py"", line 37, in import_module
    __import__(name)
  File ""/home/ubuntu/workspace/my_app/admin.py"", line 108, in &lt;module&gt;
    class PersonModelAdmin(popolo.admin.PersonAdmin):
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'admin'
</code></pre>

<p>Printing <code>dir(popolo)</code> just before the import gives this:</p>

<pre><code>['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__',
 '__path__', '__version__', 'behaviors', 'models', 'querysets']
</code></pre>

<p>Meaning that neither <code>admin</code> or <code>views</code> are recognised as being in the module. The <code>__init__.py</code> is here (not my code, don't judge):</p>

<pre><code>""&lt;Include a description of your project&gt;""

__version__ = '0.0.0'
</code></pre>

<p>It gets weirder as I can do this code just fine:</p>

<pre><code>import popolo
from popolo import admin as popoloAdmin
class PersonModelAdmin(popoloAdmin.PersonAdmin):
    pass # more code
</code></pre>

<p>And even this:</p>

<pre><code>import popolo
from popolo import admin as popoloAdmin
class PersonModelAdmin(popolo.admin.PersonAdmin):
    pass # more code
</code></pre>

<p>And at the above point if I <code>print dir(popolo)</code> it shows <code>admin</code> as being a part of it.</p>

<p>Things I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rebooting/restarting</li>
<li>Removing all <code>.pyc</code> files</li>
<li>Moving directories</li>
<li>Making <code>__init__.py</code> completely blank</li>
</ul>

<p>Why isn't <code>admin</code> showing up in the module, when by all accounts it should be? <strong>What am I doing wrong?</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>There's NO ERROR on those code, so <strong>it works just fine</strong>. But, it seems that the <code>InputBindings</code> <strong>can get a lot</strong> of lines if my application has a lot of <code>InputBindings</code>. </p>

<p>So, is it possible to <strong>simplify</strong>/shorten them (in any way)? It is because my application will <strong>need a lot</strong> of <code>InputBindings</code> / <code>KeyBinding</code>'s <strong>Modifier</strong> combination, and it feel input it one-by-one will look ""not neat"". M</p>

<p>Or maybe it is the only way to do (with MVVM)?</p>

<p>Please clarify anything needed :D</p>

<hr>

<p>Just in case needed, these are the related methods in Command and ViewModel class :</p>

<pre><code>public void Execute(object parameter)
{
    Notes note;
    if (Enum.TryParse(parameter.ToString(), out note))
    {
        _vm.AddOrUpdateNote(note, Keyboard.Modifiers);
    }
    else
    {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A part of my ViewModel :</p>

<pre><code>public void AddOrUpdateNote(Notes note, ModifierKeys mKeys)
{
    if (mKeys == ModifierKeys.Control)
    {
        ...
    }
    else if (mKeys == ModifierKeys.Shift)
    {
        ...
    }
    else
    {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, there's a minor behavior difference depending which Modifier Key is pressed. <em>(Splitting into different methods feels awful for me)</em></p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE :
I've read some explanations on <code>InputGestures</code>. In <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752308%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752308%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a> it's said <code>this.InputBindings.Add(Blabla)</code> (from xaml.cs i guess), can it be done in the ViewModel? Or is it strictly need to be done via XAML, so, if I have <strong>a lot of</strong> key combination in my application such in the example above, it still need to be done that ""long"" way?</p>

<p>Please provide some code samples if possible, so I can understand it better. Thanks</p>

<p>(Not quite sure too how to ask it, so please feel free to clarify)</p>

<pre><code>var store = {
      error: {msg:'',info:{}},
      others: '',
      etc: ''
}
</code></pre>

<p>On an error in the app, an action will update the error via the dispatcher, and the error panel will be shown to the user.  The render of the error panel conditionally shows the div by testing the error msg state.</p>

<p>On the next user input, an action, i.e., userAction, the model state will be updated by the dispatcher. <strong>Problem</strong>: the error panel will still be shown, since the error msg state was not 'reset'.  </p>

<p>The userAction will be setting other non-error state. Flux will emit a change for this change.  Yet, if I follow the Flux model, a reset of the error should also be done here, in this action, but that would cause an emit, which tells to UI to update.  Seems incorrect.   </p>

<p>My thinking is:
1.  Don't put this kind of stuff in the store?  Or,
2.  The store will reset the error state for every non-error update of state. Or,
3.  Each action will also include an error state object for any state updates.</p>

<p>Currently my solution is to clear the error data within the store functions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in
  the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use.  When free
  memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven't been able to find any documentation regarding this threshold value. It is a percentage of available RAM? Is it when the Commit Charge consumes all available RAM? How does the system treat Kernel pages, vs User mode pages?</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is that threshold? </li>
<li>Is there a way to detect it? </li>
<li>Do different versions of windows have different behavior or thresholds?</li>
</ul>

<p>The scenario is that my process will try to use as much memory as there is available physical RAM. Once that limit is reached I can deallocate and cache on disk certain chunks of memory to make room for new stuff. It does this to help alleviate page file thrashing when memory conditions are low. I'd like to perform the deallocation BEFORE the memory manager begins swapping pages to disk because the memory usage has passed the magic threshold.</p>

<p>I currently use the MEMORYSTATUSEX::ullAvailPhys value (filled by GlobalMemoryStatusEx) to identify the amount of available physical memory. </p>

<p>These are the constructors.</p>

<pre><code> public stock(String dt, double opening, double closing)
        throws ParseException {

    Date date = new SimpleDateFormat(""d-MMM-yyyy"").parse(dt);
    GregorianCalendar gregCal = new GregorianCalendar();

<p>The issue is when I try to print the object it seems to print out the contents of a Gregorian calender which is what I'm using for date. Once I read the contents of the file, I added them to the object and tried to print them but that's were the problem was.</p>

<pre><code>  stock newStock = new stock(temp, opening, closing);

<p>Setting childview.setOnClickListener() doesn't work since it always consumes the touch event.</p>

<p>Therefore, I used childview.setOnTouchListener() and let its onTouch method return false, so that the Gallery becomes scrollable.</p>

<p>This is all fine.</p>

<p>The problem is now, that the onTouch method of the childView only fires the ACTION_DOWN event. 
It doesn't pass on the MotionEvent ACTION_UP unless I make the View clickable by setting childview.setClickable().
However, setting the View clickable itself seems to consume the onTouch event so that the gallery View becomes unscrollable.</p>

<p>Seems like I'm going in a circle here. I'd be grateful for any help.</p>

<p>Here's my code</p>

<p>Gallery View:</p>

<pre><code>public class myGallery extends Gallery {

    public myGallery(Context ctx, AttributeSet attrSet) {
        super(ctx, attrSet);
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }

    private boolean isScrollingLeft(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2){ 
           return e2.getX() &gt; e1.getX(); 
        }

    @Override
    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY){
      int kEvent;
      if(isScrollingLeft(e1, e2)){ //Check if scrolling left
        kEvent = KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_LEFT;
      }else{ //Otherwise scrolling right
        kEvent = KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_RIGHT;
      }
      onKeyDown(kEvent, null);
      return true;  
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>in my Activity:</p>

<pre><code>gallery.setOnItemSelectedListener(new OnItemSelectedListener(){
     public void onItemSelected(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view,
                    int position, long id) {


         //  childView.setClickable(true);   // can't use this
                                             // click event would get consumed
                                            // and gallery would not scroll 

         // therefore, I can only use the ACTION_DOWN event below:

         childView.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() {

"32524740","1","","","2015-09-11 13:31:54","","1","54","<p>I have an OrientDB graph database with nodes connected in series with link of type <code>NEXT</code>. (There are several distinct series in my data, and no node has more than one incoming and one outgoing ""NEXT"" link). The nodes all have a property called ""name"". I would like to find all the sequences of name that occur in traversing the paths from start to end.</p>

<p>I.e. to get one sequence of names, start at a node which has no incoming NEXT link, follow the NEXT links until you have reached a node with no outgoing ""NEXT"" links, and gather up into a list all the names of the nodes you have passed. </p>

<p>e.g. a sub-graph of form 
    <code>(Bob)-[NEXT]-&gt;(Sharon)-[NEXT]-&gt;(Carl)</code>
should give the list 
    <code>[""Bob"", ""Sharon"", ""Carl""]</code></p>

<p>For clarification, here is a Cypher (Neo4j) query which gets me all the possible lists.</p>

<pre><code>    match (start) -[:NEXT*]-&gt; (end),
    p = shortestPath(start-[:NEXT*]-&gt; end)
    where not ()-[:NEXT]-&gt;(start) and not (end)-[:NEXT]-&gt;()
    return extract( s in nodes(p) | s.name ) as path
</code></pre>

<p>However, I need to do this in OrientDB, which doesn't use Cypher.</p>

<p>I would like to know whether this is possible in OrientDB, and if so whether it is simpler in the SQL language or Gremlin.</p>

<p>As a secondary question, ideally I would like to not return all the lists of names, because what I really care about is how often each list occurs. So instead I want to return the unique lists with how often that particular list was found. Is this possible to do in OrientDB, or would I have to retrieve all the path data from OrientDB as above and do the aggregation somewhere else?</p>

I understand how NoSQL is meant to be schema-less and it feels counter-intuitive. Nevertheless, I am in such a situation that I do not see how schema migration can be totally avoided. I use NoSQL with mobile devices. Here's the big lines of my set-up and my needs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Each mobile device has its own replicated database.</li>
<li>The mobile device can work offline.</li>
<li>Mobile devices replicates with a database on the cloud server to share their data.</li>
<li>The data replicates when possible so multiple users on different devices can work on the same data.</li>
<li>A newer version of the client could decide to change the value type it stores for a particular key (i.e. the equivalent of a schema change)</li>
<li>The users might not update the app as soon as an update is available.</li>
<li>A user that is not updated should be able to still work on the same data as the users who are updated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit:</p>

<ol>
<li>The application is 100% native code.</li>
</ol>

<p>My problem here is that a user with a client that is an old version of the software would not expect the new data to be a string instead of an int per se. Thus, handling it client-side can not always be done since we do not want to force the users to update their apps.</p>

<p>To explain it under another angle what happens is that I want two users with two different client versions to be able to share and modify the same data, meaning that I need to have backward and forward compatibility. Backward compatibility is often tackled, but forward compatibility is a bit more problematic. I need a way to continue to use my last-modified heuristic for conflict resolution while having a version that can not interpret the new schema fully. </p>

<p>After some thinking, I could consider an approach where I should split the cloud database into multiple sources; one where every mobile device pushes its modifications and one-to-x databases where the mobile devices pull the most recent data adapted to their versions. Somewhere in between those I should handle backward and forward compatibility with schema migrations. </p>

<p>Is there a way to avoid schema migrations, even in such a set-up?
Do anyone see any other simpler or safer solutions? 
What are the limitations of such a system? 
I do not feel that I am exactly on the right track here.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Paul</p>

<p>How do I catch all unhandled exceptions using WCF Rest with .NET 4.0?</p>

<p>For security purposes I do not want unhandled exceptions going to the client. I want to log all exceptions and for unknown exceptions just send back 500 Internal Server Error.</p>

<p>My best research so far tells me I need to implement IErrorHandler and throw WebFaultExceptions for known exceptions. One issue I have with this is that all of my business logic is in a separate project from the WCF service and it doesn't make sense to throw a Web exception from the underlying class library since the class library could be consumed by another process which may not be a WCF Rest Service. Is there a nice way to map exceptions?</p>

$(window).resize(function(){
var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
canvas.width=window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
});

<p>However, I want my canvas to be fully sized from the get-go, not just when somebody resizes the screen. For some reason, when I copy the code above, except I change <code>$(window).resize</code> to <code>$(window).load</code> or <code>$(document).ready</code>, the canvas does not get set to the size of the window to begin with. </p>

<p>Does anybody see something wrong with what I'm trying to do that I'm not seeing, or have any other ideas on how to achieve this? </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>It would probably be good to note that I'm loading a ProcessingJS sketch into the canvas. I don't know whether the time that it takes for that to load ends up having an impact on things or not, but I figured I might as well make a mention of this...</p>

Fancybox works as it should when the first decade selection is made.  However, when the decade is changed and a new batch of photos loads up, the hyperlinks for photo enlargement stop working. When I click on one of the thumbnails I get only the background overlay, with no display of the photo enlargement. I can see the hyperlinks in the source, but it's acting like the Z-order of the background image has a higher value than the thumbnails. Fancybox works correctly if I reload the parent page (the one with the dropdown menu) after each decade selection but that doesn't make for a smooth user experience.  Any suggestions would be very much appreciated!</p>

<p>So far I have the first set of results returned and an Ajax.ActionLink working which renders a partial view in a div which shows results from a second source. However obviously I have to click on the actionLink to get the it to work.</p>

push_back(3)
push_front(5)
push_front(1)</p>

<p>how will this data appear in deque? will it be like
    3,4,5,1  where Front points to 1 and back to 3?
so if i do pop_back() will it return 3 or 4? (since 3 was pushed before 4.. does it act as a FIFO?)
similarly for pop_front()? 5 or 1?</p>

<p>if I do 
push_back(4)
push_back(3)
push_back(5)
push_back(1)</p>

For some reason in IE11 the <code>localStorage</code> resets itself after closing the browser; in IE10 with the same settings everything works ok. </p>

<p>Any ideas what the problem could be?</p>

<p>Java or C++ is fine. Just need an example of some code. Can't find a single example of doing this.</p>

<p>If anyone has links to good examples/tutorials I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
