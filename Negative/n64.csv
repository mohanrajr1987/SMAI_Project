"11152845","1","11153439","","2012-06-22 08:39:54","","3","179","<p>I am trying to create a jQuery Gallery that lets the user flip (with previous, next buttons) through 'icons' which contain photos, movies, PDF documents. </p>

<p>My strategy is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep jQuery ignorant of the actual contents of the icon,</li>
<li>the actual content comes from an Ajax callback, which returns an HTML string,</li>
<li>if my php-code so decides, a previous and/or next button maybe present in that HTML string,</li>
<li>if those buttons are present, bind a click event to them,</li>
<li>the click event makes a recursive call to mainLoop() which shows the new icon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>function mainLoop() {
if (icons[newIndex] !== IFM_APPENDED ) { // tests whether this icon has already been loaded
    $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: '/callback/div_supply',
        data: {iconindex: newIndex},
        success: function(data) {
            $('#jquery-lightbox').append(data); // inserts new icon into the DOM
            icons[newIndex] = IFM_APPENDED; // registers that this icon has been loaded
            if ($('#icon'+newIndex+' .prev-button').length !== 0) { // test if the previous button is present
                $('#icon'+newIndex+' .prev-button').click(function () {
                oldIndex = newIndex;
                newIndex -= 1;
                mainLoop();
                }); // END $('#icon'+newIndex+' .prev-button').click()
            } // END if ($('#icon'+newIndex+' .prev-button').length !== 0) 
            if ($('#icon'+newIndex+' .next-button').length !== 0) { // test if the previous button is present
                $('#icon'+newIndex+' .next-button').click(function () {
                oldIndex = newIndex;
                newIndex += 1;
                mainLoop();
                }); // END $('#icon'+newIndex+' .prev-button').click()
            } // END if ($('#icon'+newIndex+' .prev-button').length !== 0) 
        } // END succes:
    }); // END $.ajax
} //  END if (icons[newIndex] !== IFM_APPENDED )
$('#icon'+oldIndex).hide(); // hide the old icon
$('#icon'+newIndex).show(); // hide the new icon
}

$(document).ready(function() {
// Hide some elements to avoid conflict with overlay in IE. These elements appear above the overlay.
$('embed, object, select').css({ 'visibility' : 'hidden' });
$(""#gallery li"").click(function() {
    _set_interface();
    mainLoop();
}); // END  $(""#gallery a"").click(function
}); // END $(document).ready(function()
</code></pre>

<p>This code works fine when I step through mainLoop() in the Firebug debugger. </p>

<p>However, when I run it, the script just hangs. It also ends up hanging when I step though the $(document).ready(function(). There a no console.log() calls which could throw Firebug off.</p>

<p>I suspect there is something wrong with the way I have set up recursion.</p>

<p>What is going wrong?</p>

<p>It has the following code included in JavaScript that runs when the user clicks a button to display a report in a separate window:</p>

<pre><code>var oIframe = $(""iframe id='idReportFrame' style='display:none' name='idReportFrame' src=''&gt;"");
oIframe.load(function() { parent.ViewReports(); });

oIframe.appendTo('body');

try
{
  $('#idReportForm').attr('target', 'idReportFrame');
  $('#idReportForm').submit();
}
catch (err) { // I did NOT write this
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Then the load function:</p>

<pre><code>function ViewReports()
{
  var rptName = $(""#ReportNameField"").val();

  if (rptName == '') { return false; }

  var winOption = ""fullscreen=no,height="" + $(window).height() + ""left=0,directories=yes,titlebar=yes,toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=no,menubar=yes,scrollbars=no,resizable=no, top=0, width="" + $(window).width();
  var win = window.open('@Url.Action(""ReportView"", ""MyController"")?pReportName=' + rptNameCode, 'Report', winOption);
  win.focus();
  return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I execute this (in Chrome, at least), it does pop up the window and put the report in it.  However, breakpoints in the c# code indicate that it is getting called 2 or 3 times.  Breakpoints in the JavaScript and examination of the little log in the JavaScript debugging environment in Chrome show that the call to <code>win.focus()</code> fails once or twice before succeeding.  It returns an undefined value, and then it appears that the first routine above is executed again.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think it some kind of timing issue, except that the window.open() call is supposed to be synchronous as far as I can tell, and I don't know why it would succeed sometimes and not others.  There is a routine that gets executed on load of the window, perhaps that's somehow screwing up the return of the value from open().</p>

<p>I am not a JavaScript person much, as those of you that are can likely tell by this time.  If there is something with the code I've put here that you can tell me is incorrect, that's great; what I'm more hopeful for is someone who can explain how the popup-report-in-frame is supposed to work.  Hopefully I can do it without having to replace too much of the code I've got, as it is brittle and was not, shall we say, written with refactoring in mind.</p>

There's also a status column. For a particular ID, we'll have a row representing each time that value was updated and we use the one with the most recent timestamp to represent the ""current"" value.</p>

<p>We have a process that will update the state based on user input. So when a user clicks a button in the UI, a new row will be created with the new state and a new user id.</p>

<p>If two users click the button at the same time, we're just inserting two new records and one of them will win (the one with the newest timestamp). We'd like to avoid having two users click this button at the same time and one potentially creating a new row without knowing they stepped on someone else's state change. In Oracle, we'd just do something like this and check that a row was inserted (where PREVIOUS_KNOWN_MAX_TS is the TS for the ""current"" record when the user viewed the page):</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO SOME_TABLE
   (ID, REVISION_TS, USER_ID, STATUS, ...)
SELECT 1, 'SOME_TIMESTAMP', 'user123', 'NEW_STATUS', ...
FROM DUAL
WHERE NOT EXISTS
   (SELECT *
   FROM SOME_TABLE
   WHERE USER_ID = 1
      AND REVISION_TS &gt;= 'PREVIOUS_KNOWN_MAX_TS'));

<p>If there was an insert between the time the user viewed the page and the time the user's updated info was inserted, the insert wouldn't happen and we'd detect that by knowing zero rows were inserted.</p>

While it works fine on my local server (Windows, PHP 5.3.6) on the remote server (FreeBSD, PHP 5.3.6) PHP returns a ""500 Internal Server Error"" when using imagecreatefrompng. Normally, I'd consult the logs in /var/log/php.log - but nothing is added to the log when I try and load the page. If I comment out the line containing imagecreatefrompng the script loads - albeit with many errors output into the log because of the missing image resource.</p>

<p>I've tried adding:</p>

<pre><code>ini_set('display_errors', 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);
</code></pre>

<p>to the code, no difference.</p>

<p>The output of phpinfo shows that GD is loaded, the output of gd_info is:</p>

<p>At this point, I'm completely lost. Short of nuking my php install and trying over again, I don't know what to do. I plan to upgrade to 5.4 once the port is updated, but considering I can't tell what the issue is - I don't know if that will fix things.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of the code in question:</p>

<pre><code>/* load image */
$imgname = '/images/'.$doctype.'_'.side($_GET['side'])."".png"";
$image_path = trim(shell_exec('pwd')).$imgname;

if(!file_exists($image_path)){
  trigger_error('Image file not found!');
  exit;
}
$im = imagecreatefrompng($image_path);
</code></pre>

<p>I've gone as far as making sure I'm using the absolute path to the image, double checking the image exists (file_exists()) and errorring out if it doesn't. Regardless of what I do, as long as imagecreatefrompng is uncommented, I get a silent 500 error.</p>

<p>Edit: I've added the snippet:</p>

<pre><code>var_dump(is_readable($image_path));
var_dump(file_exists($image_path));
</code></pre>

<p>to my code which results in:</p>

<pre><code>bool(true) bool(true)
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like the image file is readable by PHP. I've also verified the image is an actual PNG file. Any other ideas? </p>

<p>Shouldn't it be using the 2nd constructor?
Either it is confusing the string with a MyInteger, or the string is being converted to a MyInteger somehow and then the compiler is trying to convert it again using the 3 candidates that it has listed. A similar error is occuring with the overloaded + operator.</p>

<p>I know that I could (as the previous answer suggests) transform my data into fixtures, then use Django's <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/howto/initial-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">in-built fixture support</a> to import it.</p>

<p>But this doesn't feel quite right - it isn't ""initial"" data, it's new data that will be uploaded regularly. Transforming it into fixtures feels like an unnecessary overhead, and the overall approach feels more suitable for initial data than for regular new data.</p>

<p>Currently I just have a Python script at the root of my project that parses the CSV file once a month and saves it directly into the database using the Django ORM. I run this once a month. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>from models import Presentation

mydata = csv.DictReader(open('Jan2015.csv', 'rU'))
for row in mydata:
    p = Presentation(id=row['id'], name=row['name'])

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^192\.168\.1\.30
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.mysite.com/$1 [R,L]
</code></pre>

<p>My local IP is <code>192.168.1.30</code> and it keeps correcting my adress to <code>https://www.mysite.com</code>.
In one condition it allows me to connect locally to my server. When I type <code>https://192.168.1.10</code> (my local server adress). But it keeps throwing me SSL caution which cannot be kept this way.</p>

<p>When I type <code>http://192.168.1.10</code> it redirects me to <code>https://www.mysite.com</code></p>

<p>How to make it leave my ip alone from all the redirects?</p>

<p>For my logic, it should not redirect me no matter what if my <code>REMOTE_ADDR</code> is <code>192.168.1.30</code>.</p>

When the page is <strong><em>not</em></strong> set as the front page my orderby filtering works perfectly. However when trying to use orderby on a static front page it redirects to the <strong>index.php page</strong>.</p>

<p>This url works for my filtering, not a static front page</p>

<pre><code>www.mydomain.com/clothing/?orderby=title&amp;order=asc

<p>This url returns no products and on page reload redirects to my index.php template when clothing is set as a static front page</p>

<pre><code>www.mydomain.com/?orderby=title&amp;order=asc
</code></pre>

<p>Its odd because I am able to filter by categories, tags, attributes, meta with no problem even when set as a static front page.</p>

<pre><code>www.mydomain.com/?cats=mens&amp;tags=shirts&amp;color=black&amp;price=60,155

<p>In my code, I'm receiving (from a third party library) a <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Stream</a> object. This <code>Stream</code> is wrapped around a <code>GetObjectResponse</code> class.</p>

<p>Since this class will be disposed after the transaction is closed, I need to copy the received stream so I can continue using it afterwards.</p>

<p>The <code>Stream</code> class exposes a <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream.length(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Length</a> property to determine the length of the stream, so as an initial step to begin the copying process I started writing:</p>

<pre><code>Stream destination = new MemoryStream(response.ResponseStream.Length);

<p>But the compiler throws an error, stating that <code>MemoryStream</code> does not take a <code>long</code> parameter, instead it takes an <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>Why would they do this?</p>

<p>If <code>MemoryStream</code> extends from <code>Stream</code>, this means that it can have a long <code>Length</code>. If it can have a <code>long</code> size, why can't it take a <code>long</code> initial capactiy?</p>

<p>I'm trying to avoid initializing the stream with no capacity, because I want to take advantage of the fact that I know how big the stream is going to be, but the constructor seems to be constraining this wish.</p>

<p>How can I approach this and why does <code>MemoryStream</code> cannot take a <code>long</code> capacity?</p>

<p>And my problem is that this code detects the wrong frequency. ;( I have searched for an algorithm/implementation (in any language) but have not found anything. </p>

<p>Note, I cannot use autocorelation, etc.. It must be comb filtering.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A little more explanation of my code:</p>

<p>I load a wav file and put frames to array frames. Then I make fft on it and have array of Complex (named widmo) (simple structure to handle complex numbers).</p>

<p>Now I put abs of Complex numbers into array spectrum:</p>

<pre><code>double[] spectrum = new double[widmo.length];

            for (i = 0; i + 1 &lt; widmo.length; ++i) {
                spectrum[i] = widmo[i].abs();
            }


            ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; comb = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
            int best = 0, best_step = 0;
            for (int step = 3; step &lt; 400; ++step) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (i = 1; i &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; i * step &lt; spectrum.length; ++i) {
                    for (int di = 0; di &lt; i; ++di) {
                        sum += spectrum[i * step + di] / i;
                    }
                }

                // sum /= step + 100; // ta linijka pozwala usunÄ…Ä‡ sporo
                // niespodziewanych skokĂłw czÄ™stotliwoĹ›ci

                sum *= 100;
                comb.add(sum);
            }
            int sum = 0;

            for (i = 0; i &lt; comb.size(); ++i) {
                sum = comb.get(i); // 3 * comb[i] - comb[i-1] - comb[i+1];
                // ctx.fillRect(i, canvas.height, 1, -sum);
                System.out.println(i + "" - "" + sum);

This makes things clean and tidy for the client - the client can work with strong types and not have to think about XML.</p>

<p>However, in the implementation of the WCF service, I would prefer to deal with the parameter data as XML documents (LINQ XDocument) instead of the deserialized object types. It's nice that WCF will deserialize to explicit types, but for my generic algorithm it's more convenient and more flexible to deal with the xml documents instead, primarily because the incoming data is polymorphic.</p>

<p>I know I can just take the parameter objects and serialize them back down to XML, but this seems wasteful. </p>

<p>I understand that I could probably replace the strongly typed params with XElement to get what I want for implementation convenience, but this will lose the benefits of strong typing (compiler checks, intellisense, self documentation) for the client.</p>

<p>Is there any way to tell WCF that in my service implementation I don't need the parameter objects deserialized, that I want them as XML instead?  </p>

<p>Or, is there a way to access the raw XML of the params as they were prior to WCF deserializing them into objects? If I can't prevent WCF from spending time deserializing the objects at least this would avoid the cost of reserializing them back to XML.</p>

While the range slider is moving or actively being touched, touching a button will fire the button's event only once. Further touches of the button appear to activate it (it depresses on screen), but it does not call the event function. The event handling is nothing fancy: the button uses on-touch for a function in my controller and the range input is bound using ng-model.</p>

<p>To reproduce:</p>

<ul>
<li>slide the range input </li>
<li>while still holding and/or sliding the range input, touch the button. The buttonTouch() function is called on the the first button press. After that, buttonTouch() will not be called, and the button will appear as if it is being activated with each touch on screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know that this can be tested in a browser, as it requires touching both controls at the same time (I used the Ionic View app).</p>

<p>example:</p>

<p><strong>html</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ion-content class=""padding"" ng-controller=""RangeCtrl""&gt;
  &lt;button type=""button"" class=""button button-large"" on-touch=""buttonTouch()""&gt;

           &lt;Setter Property=""Background"" TargetName=""Bd"" Value=""Black""/&gt;

     &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
   &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
&lt;/Setter&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when TextBlocks are globally styled in App.xaml (for maintaining a consistent look), the foreground does not change, but retains the globally styled foreground color. This is how my TextBlocks are styled:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type TextBlock}""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""FontFamily"" Value=""Arial""/&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Foreground"" Value=""Brown""/&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Margin"" Value=""4,0,4,0""/&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""TextTrimming"" Value=""CharacterEllipsis""/&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""TextWrapping"" Value=""NoWrap""/&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""VerticalAlignment"" Value=""Center""/&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is shouldn't the explicitly defined style assignment (in TabItem's trigger) have precedence? More importantly, how do I work around this without assigning styles to all my textblocks individually but having the TabItem textblock change color as expected?</p>

<pre><code>      // create AVPlayerLayer
      if(iAmPlayingButCellIsReloaded)
        {
            _playerLayer.player = playerWhichIsPlaying;
            // time resets to 0 here
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Mostly, it's working correctly, but there are cases when video restarts (moving to the beginning) after replacing cells. It happens every first reload and rarely during next iterations. 
Is there fix for that? Should I wait to finish video, and then reload cell? Can I somehow force to use old cell while reloading row? Is there better way to copy AVPlayerLayer/AVPlayer from one place to another?</p>

Like for example, in a text editor, files are opened up in multiple tabs. I want to replicate this. So whenever I press ""New File"" button, it should programmatically create another tab with a new QTextEdit field. 
Also all the functions I have written so far are using the above mentioned object name, like </p>

<pre><code>void MainWindow::some_function() {
    ...
    ui-&gt;text_field-&gt;textCursor();
    ...

<p>As you can see, I have approached this in a wrong way. The problem is that how am I going to set the same object name for newly created QTextEdit when I press the ""New File"" button?</p>

<p>I tried something like this.</p>

<pre><code>void MainWindow::on_actionNew_triggered()
{
    QTextEdit *text_field = new QTextEdit();
    ui-&gt;tabWidget-&gt;addTab(text_field,""Untitled.txt"");

    &lt;script type=""text/template"" id=""template-flight-match""&gt;
      &lt;section id=""form-search"" class=""content-inner clearfix""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""date-container"" class=""search-row clearfix""&gt;
          &lt;label class=""search-label"" for=""date""&gt;Travel Date&lt;/label&gt;
          &lt;img src=""images/structure/icon-calendar.png"" alt=""calendar"" class=""calendar""&gt;
          &lt;span class=""help-text"" id=""date-unknown""&gt;don't know it?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=""flight-container"" class=""search-row clearfix""&gt;
          &lt;label class=""search-label"" for=""date""&gt;FLIGHT #&lt;/label&gt;

        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and in flight-match-form.js, I simply say:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

    var MatchView = Backbone.View.extend({
        initialize: function(){
            this.render();
        },
        render: function(){
            // Compile the template using underscore
            var template = _.template( $(""#template-flight-match"").html(), {} );
            // Load the compiled HTML into the Backbone ""el""
            this.$el.html( template );
        }
    });

    var matchView = new MatchView({ el: $(""#content"") });

});
</code></pre>

<p>This works great, and all I really wanted to do next was to get all that html out of a script tag and into a proper HTML file, where I think it belongs. So, does anyone know the simplest way to do this?</p>

<p>I tried to follow <a href=""http://backbonetutorials.com/organizing-backbone-using-modules/"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>, and it lead me down this big rabbit hole where I ended up using require.js and the text module, and a router, and two new js files (main and app), along with a view and a template. I'm currently getting an error in the view stating that Backbone cannot read property 'view' of undefined. This is my code:</p>

<p>In index.html, I include require.js, and make it reference main.js as the inital file:</p>



<p>then in main.js, I specify a template directory, and send it off to app.js:</p>

<pre><code>require.config({
  paths: {
    jquery: 'vendor/jquery/jquery-2.0.2.min',
    underscore: 'vendor/underscore/underscore-min',
    backbone: 'vendor/backbone/backbone-min',
    templates: '../templates'
  }
});

require([
  'app',
], function(App){
  App.initialize();
});
</code></pre>

<p>In app.js, I initialize the router:</p>

<pre><code>define([
  'jquery',
  'underscore',
  'backbone',
  'router', // Request router.js
], function($, _, Backbone, Router){
  var initialize = function(){
    // Pass in our Router module and call it's initialize function
    Router.initialize();
  };

  return {
    initialize: initialize
  };
});
</code></pre>

<p>and in router.js, I set up a route for my view:</p>

<pre><code>// Filename: router.js
define([
  'jquery',
  'underscore',
  'backbone',
  'views/search/SearchFormView'
], function($, _, Backbone, SearchFormView) {

  var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
    routes: {
      // Define some URL routes
      'search': 'SearchFormView'
    }
  });

  var initialize = function(){

    var app_router = new AppRouter;

    app_router.on('route:SearchFormView', function(){

        // Call render on the module we loaded in via the dependency array
        var searchView = new SearchFormView();
        searchView.render();

    });
    Backbone.history.start();
  };
  return {
    initialize: initialize
  };
});
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, I just create that view, which will load my template:</p>

<pre><code>define([
  'jquery',
  'underscore',
  'backbone',
  'text!templates/search/search-form-template.html'

], function($, _, Backbone, searchFormTemplate){
  var SearchFormView = Backbone.View.extend({
    initialize: function(){
        this.render();
    },
    render: function(){
        // Compile the template using underscore
        var template = _.template( $(""#template-flight-match"").html(), {} );
        // Load the compiled HTML into the Backbone ""el""
        this.$el.html( template );
    }
  });
  return SearchFormView;
});
</code></pre>

<p>but it's not working, and I can't figure out why. Any help is much appreciated. Apologize for the excessive amount of code, but all of it seems to be necessary just to load this stuff the proper way.</p>

"1746402","1","1746505","","2009-11-17 03:27:09","","0","522","<p>I am looking for a special template class, hopefully either a QT template or a self-contained open source library. This template class is intended to act as a container for a set of objects. Each object in the set has an integer-valued weight function but the weight function itself is arbitrary. It could range uniformly from 10 to 100 or vary non-uniformly from 1000 to 10000 or be a constant value. </p>

<p>The template would keep a list of objects sorted by this weight (resolving ties arbitrarily). It would allow me to quickly retrieve the object having <em>nth highest weight</em> from the list, <em>by order, not value</em> (random access using an integer, like QList). The template also allow me to quickly add and remove arbitrary elements while keeping the list ordered by weight (like a QMap). </p>

<p>Just quickly finding objects within an order of magnitude would be enough for my purposes - IE, finding the 1st, the 10th, the 100th, the 1000th and so-forth elements in my ordered list would suffice.</p>

<p>I could implement a data structure like this myself (as an array of lists of increasing size or as a modified a binary tree having a count of n elements below each node). But it seems better to use a standard, commonly available, <em>well documented</em> template to solve the problem. I would prefer to avoid STL but if there's an STL solution, I would be interested. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I'm looking for, at the least, <em>orders of magnitude</em> - <strong>not</strong> <em>just the first</em> but the 1st, the 10th, the 100th <em>ordered by weight</em> on up to the end (the internal ordering of a heap data structure would be great but I don't see any functions that directly access this). I can see that STL provides a ""random access iterator"" but after paging through a fair amount of documentation, I still can't find if this iterator would give the nth value without needing to sort the list for each call - indeed, my vague impression is that it would. STL also provides an ""nth element"" function but it appears that this is relatively costly if you are calling it for each access to the list. </p>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong>
Reason one can't simply use a QMap iterator and do it2 = it.begin()+1000; (<a href=""http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qmap-iterator.html#operator-2b"" rel=""nofollow"">from QT's documentation</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iterator iterator::operator+ ( int j )
  const</p>
  
  <p>Returns an iterator to the item at j
  positions forward from this iterator.
  (If j is negative, the iterator goes
  backward.)</p>
  
  <p>This operation <strong>can be slow</strong> for large j
  values.</p>
  
  <p>See also operator-().</p>

<p>I have a script that runs an experiment and collects data. The script keeps track of test runs with a single int value. So the first time I run the script, the data that is collected will have a column in the SQL table called TestNum that starts with 1. The next time I run it, it will be 2 and so on and so forth.

{
    (set TestNum variable in script = 1)

<p>Will this succeed in allowing Proguard to identify the unused statements and remove them? This statement is pretty ugly, but it's the shortest I can see that it can be.</p>

<p>Is there a more succinct way to include logging in an Android app, but have it automatically stripped out for the production build? I suspect it's possible to configure Proguard itself to remove specific aspects of the code, but not sure if that's a better solution than this.</p>

<p>I've seen this topic but it doesn't help me!</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1058785/how-can-i-get-castle-windsor-to-automatically-inject-a-property"">How can I get Castle Windsor to automatically inject a property?</a> </p>

<p>this is Program.cs</p>

<pre><code> CastleContainer.Instance
        .Install(
          new RepositoriesInstaller(),
          new PersistenceInstaller(),
          new LoggerInstaller(),
          new FormInstaller(),
          new ServiceInstaller()

          );

        FrmStart form1 = CastleContainer.Resolve&lt;FrmStart&gt;(new {Id=""666"" });
</code></pre>

<p>I use log4net.config external file and this is my installer:</p>

<pre><code>public class LoggerInstaller : IWindsorInstaller
{
    #region IWindsorInstaller Members

    public void Install(IWindsorContainer container, IConfigurationStore store)
    {
         container.AddFacility(""logging"", new LoggingFacility(LoggerImplementation.Log4net, ""log4net.config""));
    }

    #endregion
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the class contains the property I want Windsor to inject:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class FrmStart : Form
{
    private EventService EventService;

    private ILogger logger = NullLogger.Instance;
    public ILogger Logger
    {
        get { return logger; }
        set { logger = value; }
    }

    public FrmStart(EventService eventService, string Id)
        : this()
    {

        Logger.Debug(""xxx"");

        this.EventService = eventService;
        this.id = Id;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that ""eventService"" and ""Id"" in the constructor are correctly injected! 
If I try to inject the Logger in the constructor it works and I've the Logger object:
{log4net.Repository.Hierarchy.DefaultLoggerFactory+LoggerImpl}! :-(</p>

<p>I've tried to create a public property for EventService and Windsor can inject it properly! So I think the problem is related only to the ILogger interface. </p>

<p>I prepared a simple full-code example here:</p>

I have a piece of code that creates rain inside a div and I need this rain to turn off and on according to my if statements. </p>

<p>Here is that JS code that makes rain work.</p>

<pre><code>var nbDrop = 120;

// function to generate a random number range.
function randRange( minNum, maxNum) {
  return (Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxNum - minNum + 1)) + minNum);
}

// function to generate drops
function createRain() {

    for( i=1;i&lt;nbDrop;i++) {
    var dropLeft = randRange(0,1280);
    var dropTop = randRange(-500,590);

    $('.rain').append('&lt;div class=""drop"" id=""drop'+i+'""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
    $('#drop'+i).css('left',dropLeft);
    $('#drop'+i).css('top',dropTop);
    }

}
createRain();
</code></pre>

<p>So further I have a series of if statements and I want to change nbDrop variable which controls a number of drops. I want only one condition to result in raining, while others should set it to 0 value. </p>

<pre><code>  function displayAnswer(answer) {           

var fortuneText = document.getElementById('answer');

    if (chosenAnswer == 0){
nbDrop = 0; 
}

else if (chosenAnswer == 1){
nbDrop = 0; 
}

else if (chosenAnswer == 2){
nbDrop = 0; 
}

else if (chosenAnswer == 3){
nbDrop = 0; 

}

else if (chosenAnswer == 4){

nbDrop = 0; 

}


else if (chosenAnswer == 5){


var nbDrop = 120;

// function to generate a random number range.
function randRange( minNum, maxNum) {
  return (Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxNum - minNum + 1)) + minNum);
}

// function to generate drops
function createRain() {

    for( i=1;i&lt;nbDrop;i++) {
    var dropLeft = randRange(0,1280);
    var dropTop = randRange(-500,590);

    $('.rain').append('&lt;div class=""drop"" id=""drop'+i+'""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
    $('#drop'+i).css('left',dropLeft);
    $('#drop'+i).css('top',dropTop);
    }

}

createRain();
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>A problem is that it only works once when the last if statement is true. But when other conditions are true, rain keeps going, so that variable doesn't change to 0 for some reason. It stays at 120. </p>

<p>Even though the button I use to click to change if statements condition has an even listener on it:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;button id=""button1"" onclick=""displayAnswer();""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to make that nbDrop variable change to zero for all other if conditions, except one which should have it set to 120?</p>

<p>For example -</p>

<pre><code>/path/to/pictures
  |
  |-&gt; 2003_college_graduation
  |-&gt; 2002_miami_spring_break
</code></pre>

<p>However, anyone can take a look at the HTML source and get the absolute path to the image -</p>

<pre><code>my.server.com/path/to/pictures/2003_college_graduation/IMG_0001.JPG
</code></pre>

<p>And with a little guesswork, anyone could navigate to other images on the server, even ones they don't have permission to.</p>

<p>Is there any way to ""mask"" the URL here? </p>

<p>One potential solution is to hash each filepath into a UUID and store the mappings in mysql table. Then when they request the URL with that hash I can look it up in the table and pull the correct image. But that makes the URL looks messy and creates a problem if the URL ever changes (because the hash will change). </p>

<p>Are there any libraries or other workarounds to mask the real path to a file? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>However, now I need to add the ability to update the database with update and insert statements based upon what the user selects in the drop down boxes from above. Again, being fairly new to this, I'm not sure what the best way to go about doing this would be? A lot of what I've found on google suggests this functionality mainly involves this part of the code:</p>

<p><code>&lt;form name = ""codes"" method = ""POST"" action=""...."" target=""_self""&gt;</code></p>

<p>And it seems a lot of the examples online suggest using a seperate php page? But I didn't really understand how the two linked to one another and how one pages contents get transferred between the other page and the database you want to update. Could anyone with experience in this offer some advice here or point me in the right direction as to what I might want to do next in order to be able to write to the database when the <code>submit</code> button is clicked?</p>

<p>Which as far as I know is the correct way of doing it. I have used this same structure several times in the same program and in several classes and modules and I have never had a problem, except with this two lines. <a href=""https://github.com/Achifaifa/kirino/blob/master/source/launch.py#L199-L200"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is the code (it says <code>var=input(""message"")</code>, but I'm trying to run it now with just those two lines changed). <code>tempx</code> and <code>tempy</code> don't share names with any function. I have also tried removing the message in <code>raw_input</code> (Same result).</p>

And I found 3 interesting things(the title is the third one ).</p>

<p>1 a local variable declared as val is not interpreted as final.</p>

<pre><code>class HowAreVarAndValImplementedInScala {
  var v1 = 123
  val v2 = 456

  def method1() = {
    var v3 = 123
    val v4 = 456
    println(v3 + v4)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>if i compile the above scala code into bytecode and then decompile that into java, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class HowAreVarAndValImplementedInScala
{
  private int v1 = 123;
  private final int v2 = 456;

  public int v1()
  {
    return this.v1;
  }

  public void v1_$eq(int x$1) { this.v1 = x$1; }

  public int v2() { return this.v2; }

  public void method1() {
    int v3 = 123;
    int v4 = 456;
    Predef..MODULE$.println(BoxesRunTime.boxToInteger(v3 + v4));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>we can see v2 is final, but v4 is not, why?</p>

<p>2 scala compiler for .net adds override keyword to a lot of(if not all) public instance methods</p>

<p>if we compile the scala code shown above into CIL and then decompile it into C#, it's like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class HowAreVarAndValImplementedInScala : ScalaObject
{
  private int v1;
  private int v2;

  public override int v1()
  {
    return this.v1;
  }

  public override void v1_$eq(int x$1)
  {
    this.v1 = x$1;
  }

  public override int v2()
  {
    return this.v2;
  }

  public override void method1()
  {
    int v3 = 123;
    int v4 = 456;
    Predef$.MODULE$.println(v3 + v4);
  }

  public HowAreVarAndValImplementedInScala()
  {
    this.v1 = 123;
    this.v2 = 456;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>all public instance methods(exclude the constructor) are marked as override, why? is that necessary?</p>

<p>3 Scala compiler for .net looses the meaning of val</p>

<p>in the above c# code, we can see that v2 is just a normal field, while in the java couter part, v2 is marked as final, shouldn't v2 be marked as readonly by the Scala compiler for .net?(a bug?)</p>

The php files are using the serialize and unserialize commands on the array variable argument but it not working correctly.</p>

<p>The initial html form is basically doing this:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;form name=""ppFrom"" action=""pp_GeneratePage.php"" method=""post""&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Filter out the following TDRSSes or Ground Stations:&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;input id=""cfButton"" type=""button"" value=""Clear filters"" onclick=""toggleOff(this);"" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""SGS""&gt;SGS 
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""AGS""&gt;AGS 
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""SKS""&gt;SKS 
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""WPS""&gt;WPS 
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""PF1""&gt;PF1&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""171""&gt;171 
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""TDW""&gt;TDW 
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""TDE""&gt;TDE 
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""TR3""&gt;TR3 
  &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""Filter[]"" value=""275""&gt;275&lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the pp_GeneratePage.php I can print out the check items ok (I checked SGS and AGS):
print_r($_POST['Filter']);
prints output:
Array ( [0] => SGS [1] => AGS )</p>

<p>The problem starts when I try and pass the Filter array down to the php file which does the real work.  This is the code I see when I do view source command:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;frame name=""AquaMB"" src=""pp_ContactRangesPanel.php?sc=Aqua&amp;path=/var/www/html/java_clocks/Aqua/terra_aos_times&amp;filter=a:2:{i:0;s:3:""SGS"";i:1;s:3:""AGS"";}#target"" scrolling=auto frameborder=0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I have 3 arguments being passed to the pp_ContactRangesPanel.php file via the src parameter: sc=Aqua, path=/var/www/html/java_clocks/Aqua/terra_aos_times, and an array Filter which I serialized to filter=a:2:{i:0;s:3:""SGS"";i:1;s:3:""AGS"";}.</p>

<p>This is the print code:</p>

<pre><code>$filterList = serialize($_POST[""Filter""]);
printf (""&lt;frame name=\""%sMB\"" src=\""pp_ContactRangesPanel.php?sc=%s&amp;path=%s&amp;filter=%s#target\"" scrolling=auto frameborder=0&gt;\n"", $aMissions[$c], $aMissions[$c], $MissionInputPaths[$aMissions[$c]], $filterList);
</code></pre>

<p>In pp_ContactRangesPanel.php I can see the first two arguments fine, but filter array is truncated as follows:
I see ""a:2:{i:0;s:3:"" but I should see ""a:2:{i:0;s:3:""SGS"";i:1;s:3:""AGS"";}""</p>

<pre><code>   import_request_variables(""gP"", ""var_"");
   echo ""sc $var_sc &lt;br&gt;"";
   echo ""path $var_path &lt;br&gt;"";
   $filterList = unserialize($var_filter);
   echo ""filter $filterList &lt;br&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>output is</p>

<pre><code> sc Aqua
 path /var/www/html/java_clocks/Aqua/terra_aos_times
 filter 
</code></pre>

<p>If I do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>$filterList = isset($_GET['filter']) ? $_GET['filter'] : null;
echo ""fitler $filterList end&lt;br&gt;"";
$afilter = unserialize($filterList);
echo ""fitler2 $afilter &lt;br&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>The out is:</p>

<pre><code>fitler a:2:{i:0;s:3: end
fitler2 
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same as if I did a </p>

<pre><code>echo ""path $var_filter &lt;br&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>So somehow the variable is being truncated so I can't unserialize it successfully.  I think is the double quotes generated by the serialize command but I don't what the workaround is for it.  If I pass the filter without serializing it all I see is ARRAY when I print out a entry it doesn't work.</p>

<p>So what am I doing wrong?  If is the double quotes, what is the workaround so it parses ok?  </p>

<ul>
<li>Modify the serialized filter sting to do \""SGS\"" or is the some<br>
command I can use to fix it?</li>
<li>Should I be using something besides printf? </li>
<li>Or am I passing these arguments in the hard way and should be doing
it some other way?</li>
</ul>

These applications are multi-user, multi-account systems in which the end users can create custom forms based on JPA entities.</p>

<p>I noticed as my JSP pages became more complex that my performance and load times were taking a hit. Originally I had thought it was the data layer causing my bottleneck, but on a whim today I replaced a couple include pages which are created on the fly using lists of objects that are iterated over by struts with a JSTL based iteration scheme. I was blown away that my page load time went from about 10 seconds to around a second. The render times of the JSP pages increase substantially (with struts2 OGNL iteration) as the list sizes grow.</p>

<p>In my struts configs I have dev mode turned off and I'm using a simple theme set, nothing special. I'm considering rewriting some of my iteration heavy pages to use JSTL instead of struts, but I thought I would ask around to see if I'm missing something or if anyone has run into similar circumstances. </p>

<p>I'd like to try and get a timeseries of an n-period rolling quantile.</p>

<p>For example, to get the upper quartile of the entire series is simply:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; quantile(se,.75)
    75% 
0.004117848
</code></pre>

<p>But what I want is to effectively add <code>data$rolling_quantile</code> so that I can have a rolling n-period window of what constitutes the</p>

<p>I would have thought <code>apply.rolling</code> (in <code>Performance Analytics</code>) or roll.apply (in <code>zoo</code>) would do the the trick but I get the follwing error when trying to calculate the 10-day rolling upper quartile:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; rolling_quantile &lt;- apply.rolling(data,width=10,FUN=""quantile"",.75)

Error in xts(calcs[-1], order.by = dates[steps]) : 
  NROW(x) must match length(order.by)
</code></pre>

<p><code>tracback</code> doesn't give much clue either:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; traceback()
3: stop(""NROW(x) must match length(order.by)"")
2: xts(calcs[-1], order.by = dates[steps])
1: apply.rolling(data, width = 10, FUN = ""quantile"", 0.75)
</code></pre>

<p><code>roll.apply</code> seems to work, but it seems to chop more data than expected at the head and tail of <code>data</code>. I will post that call as an update if necessary, but I figure <code>apply.rolling</code> is the appropriate solution in any event.</p>

<p>Doing this in excel is dead simple, of course, but I'd like to get the answer in R. But as a guide to the solution, this is the result I'd like to get (as generated in Excel):</p>

<p>This looks a little monstrous for me. I found many things are crowded into one line. Also, I found <code>l.deviceID</code> is of type <code>Column[Option[String]]</code>, while <code>userLoginInfo.deviceID</code> is of type<code>Option[String]</code>, they don't equal if both of them is <code>None</code>. Thus a <code>l.device.isEmpty</code> looks necessary..</p>

<p>when image is not moving, this doesn't happen. It seems that the image is already moved internally, but not yet drawn to the screen, but thats just a wild guess. The example below uses a button, but the same goes for an image. I""ll provide a short example of the code, but i guess its pretty straightforward what i'm trying to do.</p>

<pre><code>private var _image:Button;
protected function init():void {
    //create pickup image
    _image  = new Button(assets.getTexture(""button""));
    _image.scaleWhenDown    = 1;
    _image.addEventListener(Event.TRIGGERED, onClick_image);
    addChild(_image);

    //listen to touch event (not used, but example for touch on image instead of button
    //touchable = true;
    //addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH, onTouch_image);
}

private function onEnter_frame(e:Event):void {
    _image.x -= 20;
}

<p>How can one add custom headers to a data bound DataGrid in WPF?</p>

<p>Why am I asking this question? Well, because I've fitted my DataGrid (which is generated in code-behind) with a dynamic itemssource, bound to an ienumerable 'list'. This works perfectly fine, although it uses the property names as column headers.</p>

<p>To improve readability I simply want to assign custom headers to the columns, however...
My idea was to supply a datagrid with the columns already defined, and let the itemssource fill the rows. But itemssource deals with the rows, as well as the columns.</p>

I use jetty 8 and try to implement an embedded web server.</p>

<p>For testing purpose i have created two servlets:</p>

<ul>
<li>FileServlet: It simply handles HTTP GET for static content, like index.html, css
and other static files and prints the current session id on the
console:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.out.println(""File session: ""+request.getSession(true).getId()
  + "" path ""+request.getPathInfo());</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>TestServlet: Does nothing, it simply prints the current session id on the console on a doGet(...)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.out.println(""Test session: ""+request.getSession(true).getId()
  + "" path ""+request.getPathInfo());</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as i know the Servlets must be part of the same ServletContext to handle Sessions correctly. So i implement it programmatically this way:</p>

<pre><code>Server server = new Server(8081);    
ServletContextHandler servletContext = new ServletContextHandler(ServletContextHandler.SESSIONS);
            servletContext.setContextPath(""/"");
            servletContext.addServlet(new ServletHolder(new FileServlet()),""/*"");
            servletContext.addServlet(new ServletHolder( new TestServlet()),""/servlets/test"");
server.setHandler(servletContext);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I start my web-browser (Chrome btw.) clear browsers cookies and browsers chache and load my test site <a href=""http://localhost:8081/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8081/index.html</a> which will also request to load other static files like css and js.</p>

<p>So now i get this output:</p>

<pre><code>File session: ok49uty1mshn1fnhyle9ojh3n path /index.html
File session: 1fuxdd50woxwv1gl9r96dfdxgl path /css/style.css
File session: 1f6m5dkht4xja5ryj7dgd93wu path /css/Loading.css
File session: 1qizt3gnyy58uj0u46kofbxdf path /css/photo.css
File session: ikzpmgyew49uwxlnt8lr839m path /css/Login.css
File session: pg6p843xuqak1uwcc68q8wnxx path /js/script.nocache.js
File session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /js/script2.js
</code></pre>

<p>After index.html has been loaded and every other resource that is embedded in index.html (css and js) i call <a href=""http://localhost:8081/servlets/test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8081/servlets/test</a> and i see this output:</p>

<pre><code>Test session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /servlets/test
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems to me that it takes some time to establish a session and i am wondering why and how to let the first session that has been created by the HTTP GET of /index.html be the session for every futher server interaction. Its very strange.</p>

<p>I also make a second experiment:
As a said before i cleared the browsers cache and cookies before loading /index.html. This time i reload the page without clearing the cache and cookies, and now it works correctly or in other words, how i expect to work:</p>

<pre><code>File session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /index.html
File session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /css/style.css
File session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /css/Loading.css
File session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /css/photo.css
File session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /css/Login.css
File session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /js/script.nocache.js
File session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /js/script2.js
</code></pre>

<p>And also /servlets/test have the same session:</p>

<pre><code>Test session: 1uv2jmvpu5u6s127rpc01ef8 path /servlets/test
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: i understand that my browser doesnt wait until the index.html is loaded completly and start to load the css and js in the meantime... But I really need to be able to determine from the first HTTP GET the ""real"" session for some security reasons. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I actually had sqlite3.h in <code>/usr/local/include</code> but could not get anything different even when trying <code>sudo gem install timetrap -- --with-sqlite3-include=/usr/local/include</code>. I tried installing <a href=""http://bitnami.org/stack/rubystack"" rel=""nofollow"">BitNami RubyStack</a> to see if that helped and no dice.</p>

<p>In any case, I ran into some posts (several here) saying that c libraries were required for some gems, so I decided to install XCode and everything worked.</p>

<p>XCode is a space hog and I'll hardly ever use it, but I'd like to be able to do what I need to with this. I tried installing only the gcc-4.2 package alone and got failures. I found that the package <code>MacOSX10.5.pkg</code> also did not sole the problem. Installing all of XCode (Build Tools Essentials and Unix Development options) takes 2+ GB.</p>

<p>It seems that just the gcc package should give me what I want, but something is awry.</p>

<p>Would someone suggest:
- if all of XCode really is required for some other thing included in that package?
- if installing XCode is setting a path/include variable somewhere such that it works when XCode gets installed but not when I try to do my a la carte install of gcc along?</p>

<p>I have several sqlite3.h's scattered around with these individual packages as well as the ones that were already there. What's my issue? Is it not really sqlite3.h but something else?</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Install some basic package that lets me do this without needing various other tools I'll never use. I dual boot on an older MacBook and only have 10GB left on my drive. Without XCode I had closer to 13! I realize I could install and then just trash XCode, but it seems like while I'm at it, gcc isn't bad to have around.</p>

<p>So I've now moved to the user account area and would like to code the page that my user would edit their profile on. My signup form only asked for username, email and password as I wanted quick registration. For the page where users will edit their profile information it will ask them for things such as:</p>

<p>first name
last name
date of birth
location
it will have the url for their profile
about me
personal stats
favoyrite things
status etc
and their photos</p>

<p>They should be able to update or change this info on the fly. On their actual profile page it will pull this info for their profile content.</p>

<p>I was wondering to keep organised would it be best to created a separate table for this e.g. profile? or would it be wise to store some of this info in the users table in the database, such as first name last name?</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out a clean way to do this because later on I'll need to add more pages like the settings page etc.</p>

<p>I recently downloaded v3.2.1 of Laravel, and I tried running the following command line from within the directory that artisan resides:</p>

<pre><code>php artisan key:generate
</code></pre>

<p>This should create a random key for me in my applications/application.php file. (Please see <a href=""http://laravel.com/docs/artisan/commands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laravel.com/docs/artisan/commands</a> for a specific reference to this command.)</p>

<p>However, when I run this command from the shell I receive the following error:</p>

<p>This is what's on line 62 of paths.php:</p>

<pre><code>chdir(__DIR__);
</code></pre>

<p>This is what's on line 1 of core.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php namespace Laravel;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My question is this: Are there any specific environment, directory, or other permissions that I should modify to get artisan up and running.</strong></p>

<p>A little background:</p>

<ul>
<li>I installed Laravel 3.2.1 yesterday for the first time</li>
<li>I can run a simple web application successfully on my system (i.e. I can route a request to a controller and load up the associated blade properly)</li>
<li>I simply downloaded the Laravel 3.2.1 (laravel-laravel-v3.2.1-8-gaae8b62.zip) from GitHub and extracted it on my server</li>
</ul>

<p>My environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3.13 on a shared host at Dreamhost</li>
<li>FireSSH to run the commands</li>
</ul>

<p>My root directory: (permissions in parenthesis)</p>

<li>/public (775)</li>
<li>/storage (775)</li>

Therefore I need to modify the to_python method to convert a datetime object into a unix timestamp. 
What would be the best way to do this? Write a custom field for my model or is there a way manipulating the widget using an own to_python method?</p>

See my <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18279572/create-a-wpf-progress-window-on-another-thread"">previous post</a> for details on how I'm doing this.</p>

<p>My delegate method to open my progress window on a second thread looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>void ShowProgressWindow()
{
    this.progressWindow = new ProgressWindow();
    progressWindow.Show();

    //Causes dispatcher to shutdown when window is closed
    progressWindow.Closed += (s, e) =&gt; Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher.BeginInvokeShutdown(DispatcherPriority.Background);

    //Notifies other thread the progress window is open when the dispatcher starts up
    System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher.BeginInvoke(new Func&lt;bool&gt;(_progressWindowWaitHandle.Set));

    //Starts the dispatcher
    System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Run();


    //Forces the worker to cancel work
    workerInstance.RequestCancel();
}
</code></pre>

<p>So if the user closes the window while the process is still running, the dispatcher will shutdown, the code will continue from Dispatcher.Run() to the next line where the work will be canceled. After which the progress window thread will exit.</p>

<p>This works fine if the window is closed by clicking the X in the top right of the window. The window closes immediately and the work is canceled.</p>

<p>Yet if I click the cancel button I've added to the window the progress window does not close, and completely stops responding. My cancel button has a very simple click event handler which simply calls Close() on the window.</p>

<pre><code>private void cancelButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    this.Close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I set a breakpoint inside this method it never ends up being hit after I click the button.</p>

<p>The XAML for my button is pretty standard</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button x:Name=""cancelButton""  Content=""Cancel"" Grid.Row=""7"" HorizontalAlignment=""Right"" Grid.Column=""1"" Margin=""0,0,12,12"" Width=""75"" Height=""23"" VerticalAlignment=""Bottom"" Click=""cancelButton_Click"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After messing with this some more I realized that clicking <em>anywhere</em> in the window, not just the cancel button, will cause it to stop responding. When the window first opens I can drag it around the screen by grabbing the title bar, but if I click anywhere inside the window it will freeze.</p>

  <p><em>The very first constructors to be executed are the virtual base classes anywhere in the hierarchy.</em></p>

<p>I tried to verify it using following program:</p>

           |

</code></pre>

<p>each class has a c'tor and virtual d'tor. the output is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>A

G
H
~H
~G
~F
~D
~E
~C

<p>but as per quote virtual base classes constructors should be executed first.</p>

<p>what did I undestand wrong?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To clear my question, As per my understanding this behaviour has nothing to do with whether a base class is virtual or not. but quote insists on <strong>Virtual Base class</strong>. am i clear or something fishy there?</p>

<p>I understand that the second <code>_.each</code> loop should be iterating for every match, since very <code>match</code> has it's own <code>events</code> subarray. I'm just not sure how to structure this and have been struggling with it for a while.</p>

<p>I tried nesting that loop inside the <code>_.each(matches, function(match) {</code> loop but that didn't work. </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: How could I get this to work?</p>

<pre><code>var results = new Results({
    start_date: lastWeek_string,
    end_date: today_string,
    matches:[
        match_events: []
    ]
});
</code></pre>

<p>Because then as @zangw says I could construct the match_events array first, append it to matches, and so on.</p>

<p>I have a game with levels. When the level selection scene is loaded, i check the MaxLevelReached int variable.</p>

<p>The first time the user plays, the maxlevelreached variable is 0.</p>

<p>The first level is  = 0 so what i do is this when the scene is loaded...</p>

<pre><code> private int level = 60; 

 if (level &gt;=  maxLevelReached || maxLevelReached == 0){
     box.setColor(0, 0, 0);  
 }
 else
 {
     box.setColor(0, 0.9f, 0);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>As you see I check to see if the level is less than or equal to the maxLevel.</p>

<p>So to start off the user should be able to play to the first level, and then when it is completed the second level will be unlocked. I know this seems really simple, but for some reason I've been struggling with it.</p>

<p>If the user clicks on a level and it Isn't unlocked yet, this is how i test to start the level or not..</p>

<pre><code>Log.e(""Level:""+levelClicked, ""Level"");

if(levelClicked &gt;= maxLevelReached){                                                           
    levelClicked = levelToLoad;

    intent.putExtra(""level"", levelClicked);

<p>This Isn't working either... For some reason all of the levels are playable when it should only be the first level to begin with.</p>

<p>Here is how I unlock the levels once the previous level is completed..</p>

<pre><code>int CurrentLevel = level+1;
Log.e(""Current Level unlocked"", String.valueOf(CurrentLevel));
editor.putInt(""max_level"",CurrentLevel);
editor.commit();
</code></pre>

<p>Then I do this in the level selector scene...</p>

<pre><code>int unlockedLevel = preference.getInt(""max_level"",0);
maxLevelReached += unlockedLevel;

When the scroll bar is dragged right-left the <code>CurrentFrameTime</code> is updated and triggers <code>UpdateFrames</code> which, in turn, grabs the frame and shows it. That works fine. </p>

<p>But, sometimes grabbing the frame can take time (because of the disk for example) and though <code>CurrentFrameTime</code> value can be already changed, the <code>UpdateFrames</code> can be ""stuck"" and still be waiting for previous frame in <code>...GetAsync().Result</code>.
What is decided to do is to move <code>Dispatcher.BeginInvoke</code> into <code>ContinueWith</code> block. Now, each time the <code>CurrentFrameTime</code> is changed, the previous operation will be canceled(we don't need to show the frame if frame time was already changed) and an up-to-date frame should be shown. But, for some reason because of this change the application became slower. When I drag the scroll it can take a few seconds before the image is updated.</p>

<p>Okay, well the basic answer to this would be using the:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor.Clip = new Rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2);
</code></pre>

<p>But my problem is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>What I need it to do is correctly map itself to a specific windows bounds so that the touch input will be restricted to that window, but will <strong>properly clip itself to the window so that when I touch the top-left corner or the bottom-right corner of the touch screen, it will place the cursor to the top-left or bottom-right of the window.</strong> Using <code>Cursor.Clip</code> will not do that and everything I touch on the touchscreen that outside of that clipping zone will just get mapped to it's closest edge of the window from where I am touching.</p>

<p>Is there anything that will allow me to pre-filter the mouse position so I can adjust it's bounds correctly?</p>

<h2>IF ALL ELSE FAILS</h2>

<p>Alternatively, I could try to find some code that will convert the mouse feed into <strong>TUIO</strong> input and feed it into the application that way, but I was hoping I wouldn't have to do that. So if anyone knows of how I can do that, that would be helpful to if my original request is not possible.</p>

<h2>FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I AM DOING</h2>

<p>If you need to know exactly why I am doing this, I am basically trying to feed the mouse events from a touch screen being fed in video into a 3D application that can take in touch inputs (through normal mouse events or TUIO) that will draw to that video, but has no way of maximizing to the full resolution of the screen because it will only render the size it is set to output at. </p>

<h2>TO BE CLEAR</h2>

<ul>
<li>I don't mind a normal mouse being disrupted by any of this. </li>
<li>I am talking about a Windows 7 system using the default Windows 7 Touch</li>
<li>The input is coming in via USB, not serial or anything like that.</li>

This works fine. A player can take a turn and the other player's listener receives the update. And if the activity is in the backgroud the updates appear as notifications in the notification bar. This is all as I'd expect.</p>

<p>However, if a player taps a notification to bring the activity into the foreground, subsequent updates always generate another notification. I would expect that the listener should have been re-registered and the activity should start handling the updates again.</p>

<p>Updated : Calling both unregisterMatchUpdateListener and registerMatchUpdateListener in onResume also doesn't allow the activity to start handling the updates.</p>

<p>The App is like this:</p>

<p><code>Two Tabs</code> in a <code>Tab Bar Controller</code>; both tabs are <code>Table View Controllers</code>. In <code>Tab Bar one</code>, we have the <code>Timeline</code>. In <code>Tab Bar two</code>, we have the <code>Settings</code>. If the user clicks on the <code>cell</code> labeled <code>Themes</code> in the <code>Settings Table View</code>, they're taken to a <code>UICollectionView</code> (embedded in a <code>UIViewController</code> with a custom <code>UICollectionViewCell</code>) called <code>Themes</code> via a <code>Push Segue</code>. </p>

<p>The themes and labels of the cells are loaded in via <code>NSArrays</code>. That works. </p>

<p>The issue I'm having is when selecting a cell to change the theme, I'm getting some strange behaviour. </p>

<p>If the user selects a theme, the <code>background</code> of the view changes, the <code>tab bar</code> changes, but the <code>navigation bar</code> does not. </p>

<p>Scenario 1 (After selecting a theme):</p>

<p>If I go back to the <code>Settings Table View</code>, the <code>navigation bar</code> is still not correct (still the old navigational bar). From here, if I go to the <code>Timeline tab</code>, the <code>navigation bar</code> changes to the appropriate theme. If I go back to the <code>Settings Table View</code> and go to the <code>Theme Collections</code>, the <code>navigation bar</code> is the same navigation bar from the <code>App Settings</code>, but not the correct <code>navigation bar</code> (because I'm using a transparent <code>navigation bar</code> in the <code>Themes Collection</code>). </p>

<p>Scenario 2:</p>

<p>If I've selected a theme in the <code>Themes Collection</code> and DON'T go back to the <code>Settings</code> but instead go straight to the <code>Timeline</code>, the <code>Navigation Bar</code> is correct in the <code>Timeline</code> and if I go back to the second tab (which is in the <code>Themes Collection View</code>), the <code>navigation bar</code> uses the appropriate <code>Transparent</code> <code>navigation bar</code> for the <code>Themes Collection View</code>. </p>

<p>In both scenarios, although I'm getting very different behaviour, the first problem is: <strong>When I select a theme, the background changes with the tab bar, but the <code>Nav bar</code> does not</strong>. </p>

<p>The second problem is I don't quite understand what is actually happening with the <code>viewWillAppears</code>, <code>viewDidLoads</code>, etc. </p>

<p>So I set out some serious logging. </p>

<p>First, here's the code in the <code>Themes Collection</code>.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

</code></pre>

<p>If you read through the logs, there's some strange behaviour where the <code>selectedThemes</code> is null through the <code>segues</code>, etc, therefore indicating that it's not loading from the <code>NSUserDefaults</code></p>

<p>I need to fix the following problems:</p>

<p>1) When a user taps a <code>cell</code> in the <code>Themes Collection</code>, change the <code>UINavigationBar</code> as well as the <code>Tab Bar</code> and <code>Background</code> (it makes no sense to me why the <code>tab bar</code> and <code>background</code> change but the <code>nav bar</code> doesn't, in the same if statement). </p>

<p>2) Fix the scenarios above where in many cases, <code>self.selectedThemes</code> is <code>null</code>, even though it should be loaded from the <code>NSUserDefaults</code>  </p>

<p>I'm not using any prepareForSegue code from the App Setting to the Theme Collections. </p>

<p>But the problems don't end there. Recently, i added the ability to write comments in a (JSF) page, after the user submits their comment, i add it to the database and redirect to the same page, so that hopefully the page refreshes with the new comment, but it wont!</p>

<p>The underlying Mysql database shows that the new comment has been added, but the page just wont show the new comment! I've tried everything (e.g. deleting browser cache, using different browsers) but only after restarting GF is when the page shows the new comment!</p>

<p>Do you have any idea what the problem could be? Could this be a Glassfish bug?</p>

<p>I believe the cause of me getting the above exception is because of the following code:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    using (SPSite site = new SPSite(siteId, spUserToken))
    {
        using (SPWeb web = site.OpenWeb(webId))
        {
            createNewSite(web);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>createNewSite(web) changes the name and URL of ""web"" using AllowUnsafeUpdates, so when it comes out of the method it has been changed.  My few months worth of Sharepoint developing experience suggest that that is the cause of the exception.  ""web"" is no longer used anymore so I can comfortably null it myself.  The problem here is... it didnt work:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    using (SPSite site = new SPSite(siteId, spUserToken))
    {
        SPWeb web = null;
        using (web = site.OpenWeb(webId))
        {
            createNewSite(web);
            if (web != null)
            {
                web = null;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I believe that the original developer used the using declaration to avoid SPWeb objects from leaking.  Asides that I think it is okay for me to break this pattern solely for the purpose of getting rid of that dreaded exception.</p>

<p>So the question: what can I do to the above code to potentially fix this exception?</p>

<p>I have created a WiX project that installs a bunch of different EXEs and DLLs. Unfortunatly when I build the project I receive the following warning for each one of them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ICE60: The file fileName is not a
  Font, and its version is not a
  companion file reference. It should
  have a language specified in the
  Language column.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have found examples and possible solutions for this and each time it is suggested to set the DefaultLanguage tag to 0 in order to fix the warning. Once doing that I then get this warning: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DefaultLanguage '0' was used for
  file 'fileName' which has no language
  or version. For unversioned files,
  specifying a value for DefaultLanguage
  is not neccessary and it will not be
  used when determining file versions.
  Remove the DefaultLanguage attribute
  to eliminate this warning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this leads me to the question of how can I handle this warning?</p>

<p>An MVC model has to be populated from posted form values or query string parameters, or other sources of data.

The idea is that I want to perform some logic before the route is handled, and possibly return a 403 error. I figured the way to do this was to add a <code>RequestFilter</code> and throw an <code>UnauthorizedAccessException</code> from inside of it.</p>

<p>This doesn't work though, and the response ends up being empty. It looks like the try/catch that would normally handle these isn't applied to <code>RequestFilters</code>. <code>DtoUtils</code> has a <code>HandleException()</code> method which creates an error response, but I am not sure how to properly add this to the <code>IHttpResponse</code> that the <code>RequestFilter</code> receives. </p>

<p>I am wondering if there is another way to add pre-route logic where you can throw exceptions like you can from inside services, or if there is a recommended way to create the error response from a <code>RequestFilter</code>.</p>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>I want the error returned by the Plugin to match (as closely as possible) errors returned by Exceptions thrown in a service. </p>

<p><code>DtoUtils.HandleException</code> looks like the way SS constructs the response, but it throws a <code>StackOverflowException</code> when I try to call it from the plugin like this:</p>

<pre><code>var error = new HttpError(HttpStatusCode.Forbidden, ""UnauthorizedAccessException"", message);
//_appHost is stored by the original Register() call
var result = DtoUtils.HandleException(_appHost, request, error);
response.WriteToResponse(request, result);
response.EndServiceStackRequest();

The background thread does some database integrity checks and checks for stuff in the Internet using Indy. After 10 seconds, the background thread should be finished and since FreeOnTerminate is true, it will also clean itself up.</p>

<p>We have noticed that in some cases, if the user closes the program too quickly, the process will still be alive until the background thread is finished.</p>

<p>Since we couldn't exactly reproduce the issue, I have created a demo project to try a few things:</p>

<pre><code>type
  TBackgroundThread = class(TThread)
  protected
    procedure Execute; override;
  end;

{ TForm1 }

var
  bt: TBackgroundThread;

procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
var
  i: integer;
begin
  // Create a background thread which runs X seconds and then terminates itself.
  bt := TBackgroundThread.Create(false);
  bt.FreeOnTerminate := true;
end;

procedure TForm1.FormShow(Sender: TObject);
begin
  // The user closes the app while the background thread is still active
  Sleep(2000);
  Close;
end;

{ TBackgroundThread }

procedure TBackgroundThread.Execute;
var
  i: integer;
  x: cardinal;
begin
  inherited;

  // Simulate some work that the background thread does
  x := MaxInt;
  for i := 0 to MaxInt do
  begin
    x := Random(x);
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The result is a bit surprising to me: After I close the MainForm, the process will be immediately terminated and the background thread will get hard-killed.</p>

<p>Now I have a few questions about this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After the closing of the MainForm (= exit of the main thread), should I manually terminate all created threads via .Terminate or will that be done automatically?</p></li>
<li><p>Shall my threads only check for Self.Terminated or should they also check for Application.Terminated ?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does my busy thread as shown above gets immediately killed when I close the application? I expected that the process Project1.exe will run until all threads have finished by themselfes. (And as described above, we had seen an application where the main form is closed, but a thread is preventing the process of being closed).</p></li>
<li><p>How is it possible then, that our real application's process does not terminate because of a running background thread? Might it have something to do with the Internet stuff, which might cause the app to wait until a connection timeout is reached?</p></li>

<p>Well this is even more bad.. I just saw I am trying to use <code>GET</code> to post. </p>

<p>So I change my request to post, and the server took it and it worked, it even created the file, but give  me an error <code>index.html:1 XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:56212/api/Mail/MailOpen.

<p>How can it give an error and still work? </p>

<p>Better yet, how is this even working!?</p>

<p>My application is based around 2 components: a WCF Windows Service and a .net client forms application. The service runs all the time under the Local System account and is primarily used to check for updates, act as a pass-through for web-service calls and manage product information files.</p>

<p>Anyway, when the application is deployed to a user that accesses the web via a proxy the service fails to hit the web-services. This is expected, as the Local System account cannot detect the users proxy settings. I can't figure out how to get around this problem. I can easily solve it on a case by case basis by setting the defualtProxy information in the WCF service config file, but I can't manage the situation on a case-by-case basis - I need my service to detect the proxy settings at runtime. I've read about proxycfg and netsh but I can't see how I can use them in my service.</p>

<p>Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.</p>

The PDF opens fine in Acrobat X, but when I try to open it programatically I an error saying that ""the file is damaged and could not be repaired"".

<p>In both Google Chrome developer tools and Firebug, I had an object <code>obj</code> which <code>console.log</code> printed out as <code>{ players: {0: ...}, ...}</code>, while <code>JSON.stringify</code> reported <code>{ players: {}, ...}</code>. <code>obj.players</code> was <code>{}</code> under both functions, so it seems that <code>console.log</code> is the culprit.

<p>I'm afraid I won't be able to provide much more context, since the code is lengthy and for a client, but I can try if there is something that could help get to the bottom this. For the moment, I am forced to stay away from <code>console.log</code> for inspection.</p>

<p>It might be useful to know that the object is formed merely from an object literal by setting properties by hand, e.g., <code>obj.players = {}; obj.players[0] = ...</code>.</p>

<p>I wants to know the feature difference or what is special node.js do which will make me think to go with it. What benefits I will get if I choose to go with Node.js . I know Node.js work on event-driven programming not an Object oriented Programming language but what else what are the other things i can do with node.js which i can not do with JQuery or other frameworks.</p>

<p>I have few Doubt like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What can be done by Node.js which can not be done by JQuery ?</p></li>
<li><p>Can Node.js is capable of consuming Web services ? If yes then is it possible to do

<p>Hope this makes sense, this is what I have so far, pretty basic but this only returns the item value, obviously because I think the location variable is unavailable (which I tried to fix unsuccessfully).  </p>

I have a collection of documents (5000 event files) that all have some ID value that will be common to groups of documents.  So there might be 10 that all have TheID: 'foobar'.</p>

<p>(In case someone asks - TheID is not an auto-increment value from a relational database - it is a unique id assigned by a partner company of ours.  I cannot redesign my source data to identify itself some other way, I have to use this TheID field to recognise groups of documents.)</p>

<p>I want to query my list of documents:</p>

<pre><code>{ _id: 'document1', Message: { TheID: 'foobar' } }
{ _id: 'document2', Message: { TheID: 'xyz' } }
{ _id: 'document3', Message: { TheID: 'xyz' } }
{ _id: 'document4', Message: { TheID: 'foobar' } }
{ _id: 'document5', Message: { TheID: 'wibble' } }
{ _id: 'document6', Message: { TheID: 'foobar' } }
</code></pre>

<p>I want the results:</p>

<pre><code>'foobar': [ 'document1', 'document4', 'document6' ]
'xyz': [ 'document2', 'document3' ]
'wibble': [ 'document5' ]
</code></pre>

<p>The aim is to represent groups of documents on our UI grouped by TheID, so the user can see all documents for a specific TheID together, and select that TheID to drill into the data querying just by that TheID value.  Yes, the string id of each document is useful - in our case, the _id value of each document is the source event identifier, so it is a unique and useful value that the user is going to want to see in the list on screen.</p>

<p>In SQL one might order by or group by the TheID field and iterate the result set appropriately.  I doubt this thinking is any use at all with a CouchDB query.</p>

<p>I know that I can use a map function to extract the TheID value for each document, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function (doc) {
  emit(doc.Message.TheID, 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>or perhaps</p>

<pre><code>function (doc) {
  emit(doc._id, doc.Message.TheID);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what I should emit as the key and value.  Even if this is useful, I'm getting the feeling that I should not use a reduce function to try to 'reduce' the large map output (1 result row per document in the database) to what I want (3 results each with a list of document id's).</p>

<p><a href=""http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/views.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/views.html</a> says ""A common mistake new CouchDB users make is attempting to construct complex aggregate values with a reduce function. Full reductions should result in a scalar value, like 5, and not, for instance, a JSON hash with a set of unique keys and the count of each.""</p>

<p>I thought I might be able to use reduce to scan the results of the map and somehow collect all results that have a common TheID value into a single result object.  What I see when reading the reduce documentation is that it will be given arrays of keys and values that contain fairly unpredictable collections, driven by the structure of the btree underlying the map results.  It won't be given arrays guaranteed to contain all similar TheID values that I could scan for.  This approach seems completely broken.</p>

<p>So, is a map/reduce pair the right thing to do here?  Should I look at using a 'show' or 'list' instead?  I'm intending to build a mustache based HTML template engine around the results, so 'list' seems the wrong way to go.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any guidance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I have done some local dev and come up with what I think is a broken solution.  Hopefully this will show you the direction I'm trying to go in.  See a public cloud based CouchDB I created at <a href=""https://neek.iriscouch.com/_utils/database.html?test/_design/test/_view/collectByTheID"" rel=""nofollow"">https://neek.iriscouch.com/_utils/database.html?test/_design/test/_view/collectByTheID</a></p>

<p>This is public.  If you would like to play, please copy it to a new view, don't pollute this one in case others come in and want to see the original.</p>

<p>map function:</p>

<pre><code>function(doc) {
  emit(doc.Message.TheID, doc._id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>reduce function:</p>

<pre><code>function(keys, values, rereduce) {
  if (!rereduce) {
    return values;
  } else {
    var ret = [];
    values.forEach(function (ar) {
      ret.concat(ar);
    });
    return ret;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Results:</p>

<pre><code>""foobar""   [""document6"", ""document4"", ""document1""]
""wibble""   [""document5""]
""xyz""      [""document3"", ""document2""]
</code></pre>

<p>The reduce function first leaves the array of values alone, and on the second pass concatenates them together.  However when I run this on my large 5000+ document database it comes up with some TheID values with empty document id arrays.  I believe this suffers from the problem I mentioned before, where the array of values passed to reduce are build dependent on the btree structure of the map they are extractd from and are not guaranteed to contain a complete set of values for given keys.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add markers via address submit through a form/button click.</li>
<li>Reset the map with a reset button to clear all the overlays.</li>
</ol>

<p>Would be an awesome step forward.</p>

<p>Algorithm:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>;start

;input to take in number of track to test n tracks
;input is stored in ""n""

<p>Google Tag Manager dataLayer gets clogged with values over time that make rules and tags too complex, especially on an AJAX-heavy site.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I'm implementing GTM on a tracking-heavy site and looking for a clean solution to the following issue. I'll take Google Analytics as en example.</p>

<p>It lets you set and use 4 macros for event tracking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Category {{ga event category}}</li>
<li>Action {{ga event action}}</li>
<li>Label {{ga event label}}</li>
<li>Value {{ga event value}}</li>
</ul>

<p>Value and label are optional, but dataLayer is persistent, isn't it? So how do I handle the following scenario:</p>

<pre><code>dataLayer.push({
  'event':'gaEvent', 
  'gaEventCategory':'my-category', 
  'gaEventAction':'my-action',
  'gaEventLabel':'my-label',
  'gaEventValue':'my-value'
});
</code></pre>

<p>But then on the same page later I have to track another event, but one without Label and Value:</p>

<pre><code>dataLayer.push({
  'event':'gaEvent', 
  'gaEventCategory':'another-category', 
  'gaEventAction':'another-action',
});
</code></pre>

<p>If I set up a rule like ""Event is gaEvent"" and on that I fire off the ""Google Analytics"" tag that looks like the following (using HTML tag here instead of built-in one):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', '{{ga event category}}', '{{ga event action}}', '{{ga event label}}',  {{ga event value}}]);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The second event would be pushed to <code>_gaq</code> with previous event's label and value.</p>

<p>How to handle cases like these?</p>

<p>For those wondering, I need to be able to fire off different tags on the same event at certain points, that's why I want this ""dynamic"" solution, but dataLayer being persistent like that would screw up the Rules.</p>

<h2>Edit 1: testing routine</h2>

<p>Here's how I test this.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have Google Analytics Debugger installed in Chrome</li>
<li>I have GTM in debug mode</li>
<li>Once the site is loaded, in the console I do the first dataLayer push from description</li>
<li>I see from GA Debug output that the GA event is fired with the 4 values</li>
<li>I do the second push from the console</li>
<li>GA Debug output tells me that the GA event is fired with new category and action, but with previously pushed label and value</li>
</ul>

<p>That's the persistency I speak of. To circumvent this I could only come up with different event types like <code>gaCustomEvent</code>, <code>gaCustomEventWithLabel</code>, <code>gaCustomEventWithOption</code> etc, and then rules and tags for each one of those. That's absurd, don't you agree?</p>

<pre><code>public static int convertDpToPixels(float dp, Context context) {

<pre><code>%table.zebra-striped#user-table{ :cellspacing =&gt; ""0"" }
  %colgroup
    %col{:id =&gt; ""email""}
    %col{:id =&gt; ""username""}

      %th{:id =&gt; ""username-head"", :scope =&gt; ""col""} Username
      %th{:id =&gt; ""sign-in-count-head"", :scope =&gt; ""col""} Sign Ins
      %th{:id =&gt; ""last-sign-in-at-head"", :scope =&gt; ""col""} Last Sign In

  %tbody
    - @users.each do |user|
      %tr{ :class =&gt; zebra }
        %td
          =h user.email
        %td
          =h user.username
        %td
          =h user.sign_in_count
        %td
          =h user.last_sign_in_at

<p>Ideally, I would like to create some kind of helper method where I could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>= custom_table_for @users do
  = column :email
  = column :username do |user|
    = link_to user.username, user_path(user)
  = column ""Sign Ins"", :sign_in_count
  = column :last_sign_in_at
</code></pre>

<p>This way I can change the formatting of the data in the columns and the column header names if I'm not happy with default values, but have the table generated for me. </p>

<p>I suppose I could create a normal helper, but I'd have to use arrays and I have no idea how I could include custom data formatting per column. </p>

<p>active_admin has something similar to this which you can see here: <a href=""http://activeadmin.info/docs/3-index-pages/index-as-table.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://activeadmin.info/docs/3-index-pages/index-as-table.html</a></p>

<p>Any leads or ideas would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>I am contemplating moving it off of AppEngine to something like Rackspace Cloud Servers because I think that my application can be more efficient if I can offload some of the work to the database (plus I can add more features that would be difficult to implement on AppEngine).</p>

<p>So, how would I go about moving an AppEngine app?  It is developed with the webapp framework and does not use many Google APIs other than the datastore.  Ideally I would be able to keep the webapp code and swap out the db classes for something that would talk to another database (MySQL or PostgreSQL is probably preferable to something like CouchDB or MongoDB, but those could work too).</p>

<p>UPDATE: In response to the comments below...
I have run plenty of web applications before.  I have not run production python apps before. I assume setting up the python / webserver aspect is fairly simple.  My hope for going with something like Rackspace Cloud servers is that it will be 1 ""server"" that I can just add resources too as we grow. We are currently doing about 200k hits a day.</p>

<p>As for AppEngine optimizations, we are using memcache where we can (not many places). We are also using Tasks, and while that helps get around request timeouts, it adds to the resources used.</p>

<p>My primary question is a good python alternative for the data layer that might require the fewest code changes. Though I also know there are probably some relevant questions that I am not thinking to ask.</p>

<ul>
<li>an <code>asm</code> declaration</li>
<li>a <code>goto</code> statement</li>
<li>a <code>try</code>-block</li>
<li>a definition of a variable of non-literal type or of static or thread storage duration or for which no initialization is performed</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that the standard does not restrict the number of <code>return</code> statements that may appear, whereas, in C++11, only one was allowed.</p>

<p>Now, consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>class Thing
{
    public:
        // Shouldn't this constructor be fine under both C++11 and C++14?
        constexpr Thing ( )
        {
            return;
        }
};

int main ( )
{
    Thing a_nice_thing;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Clang (3.5 with <em>-std=c++14</em>) compiles it fine, but GCC (4.9.1 with <em>-std=c++14</em>) does not, complaining:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>constexpr constructor does not have empty body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if it is changed:</p>

<pre><code>class Thing
{
    public:
        // This constructor is fine under both C++11 and C++14
        constexpr Thing ( )
        {
            static_assert( __cplusplus &gt; 1 , ""static_assert isn't the right mechanism to test this, since it wasn't available at earlier versions of the language"" );
        }
};

int main ( )
{
    Thing a_nice_thing;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then it compiles fine under both compilers.</p>

<p>Since GCC complains about the constructor's body not being empty, shouldn't it also complain in the later case? Is this behavior a bug in GCC? Is the return statement allowed on constexpr constructors?</p>

<p><sub>Note: whether a single <code>return</code> statement is really worth is not the scope of this question, although interesting and perhaps worth another one. I put single <code>return</code> statements on constructors whose body is empty, for style reasons.</sub></p>

I followed <a href=""http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this guide</a> on android website and made a new project out of existing code then added it as a library into my own project. The problem is everything errors out, <code>R</code> cannot be resolved as a variable so I tried to clean my project and it does nothing. I import <code>R</code> then it can't find any of my activities. So there's my first problem. </p>

<p>The library I'm using is This <a href=""https://github.com/attenzione/android-ColorPickerPreference"" rel=""nofollow"">Color Picker</a> and really on the homepage it just says to use the xml and add it to my preferences but my preferences doesn't seem to recognize it. </p>

<p>I'm obviously doing something wrong but can't seem to find a decent tutorial to walk me through adding custom libraries to my project. I was hoping someone with more experience could help me find the root of my errors or point me to a tutorial so I can start the import process from scratch.</p>

I have installed the gem client_side_validations to generate client side validations. But this works only for one of my two nested simple_fields_for. I updated client_side_validations to the latest version (3.2.6), but that doesn't helped. I played a little bit with ryan bates railscast example app client_side_validation #263 trying to get it to work there. There worked the same setup as expected. But in my app not. I striped nearly everything away in my app to identify the error. Then it looked very similar to the working railscast app. But the validation in the simple_fields_for :yearkontakts form doesn't show up.The JavaScript seems to be generated properly. As far as I can see there is no cause for this behavior. Is there anybody who can help me to find a solution?</p>

<p>Update (2013-08-20):</p>

<p>I tried to nest another simple_fields_for form on the same level as :yearcontacts. The new form showed no client side validation, too! Seems to me that there is no problem with the yearcontact model.</p>

<p>Another finding was, that If I'm changing the simple_fields_for block from:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= y.simple_fields_for :yearkontakts, :yearkontakt do |yk| %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.association :sex %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.input :vorname %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.input :nachname %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.input :email %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.input :notizen  %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= y.simple_fields_for @yearkontakt do |yk| %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.association :sex %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.input :vorname %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.input :nachname %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.input :email %&gt;
   &lt;%= yk.input :notizen  %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then the client side validation works. But then the create controller can't identify the @yearkontakt data as nested attributes for @year. </p>

<p>I will say that STS takes AGES to load vs IntelliJ for some reason so if someone knows how to tweak STS to open faster I'd love to know. Even on this new MBP 15"" with i7 and 4GB of ram it feels way too slow opening up and is excruciatingly frustrating when it hangs.</p>

Servers are using X509 certificates for authentication. Needless to say, when server A (client) establishes connection to server B (server), there is a SSL/TLS validation error, since certificates used are not from trusted 3rd party authority.</p>

<p>Normally, the way to handle it is using <code>ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback</code>, such as:</p>

<pre><code>ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += 
        (sender, cert, chain, error) =&gt;
{
    return cert.GetCertHashString() == ""xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"";
};
</code></pre>

<p>That approach works, except it's not ideal. What it essentially does is override validation procedure for EVERY http request done by the application. So, if another class will try to run HTTP request, it will fail. Also, if another class overrides <code>ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback</code> for its own purposes, then my communication starts failing out of sudden.</p>

<p>The only solution which comes to mind, is creating a separate <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">AppDomain</a> to perform client HTTP requests. That would work, but really - it's silly to have to do that only so that one can perform HTTP requests. Overhead will be staggering.</p>

<p>With that in mind, have anyone researched if there is a better practice in .NET, which would allow accessing web services, while handling client SSL/TLS validation without affecting other web clients?</p>

<p>At first i was saving to NSHomeDirectory itself, not the ""Documents"" subdirectory. Since the App directory changes with each deployment but only the files in the ""Documents"" directory get copied, the saved file was lost after each deployment. Then i used the ""Documents"" folder but someone suggested i should probably put it in a subfolder of ""Documents"" i did just that but forgot to create the folder, hence the file wasn't saved. I double-failed on this one. :)</p>

<p>For ease of reference, I shall sum up the referenced question here. The OP defines a class:</p>

<pre><code>struct Account 
{
    static constexpr int period = 30;
    void foo(const int &amp;) { }
    void bar() { foo(period); } //no error?
};
</code></pre>

<p>and is wondering why he gets no error about his usage of an in-class initialized static data member (a book mentioned this to be illegal). Johannes Schaub's answer states, that:</p>

<ol>
<li>This violates the <strong>One Definition Rule</strong>;</li>
<li>No diagnostics is required.</li>
</ol>

<p>As much as I rely the source and validity of this answer, I honestly dislike it because I personally find it too cryptic, so I tried to work out a more meaningful answer myself, with only partial success. Relevant seems to be § 9.4.2/4: </p>

<p><em>""There shall be exactly one definition of a static data member that is <strong>odr-used</strong> (3.2) in a program; <strong>no diagnostic is required</strong>""</em> [Emphases are mine]</p>

<p>Which gets me a bit closer to the point. And this is how § 3.2/2 defines an <strong>odr-used</strong> variable:</p>

<p><em>""A variable whose name appears as a potentially-evaluated expression is odr-used <strong>unless</strong> it is an object that satisfies the requirements for appearing in a constant expression (5.19) <strong>and</strong> the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (4.1) is immediately applied""</em> [Emphases are mine]</p>

<p>In the OP's question, variable <code>period</code> clearly satisfies the requirements for appearing in a constant expression, being a <code>constexpr</code> variable. So the reason must be certainly found in the <em>second</em> condition: <em>""<strong>and the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (4.1) is immediately applied</strong>""</em>.</p>

<p>This is where I have troubles interpreting the Standard. <strong>What does this second condition actually mean?</strong> What are the situations it covers? Does it mean that a static <code>constexpr</code> variable is <strong>not</strong> odr-used (and therefore can be in-class initialized) if it is returned from a function? </p>

<p>More generally: <strong>What are you allowed to do with a static <code>constexpr</code> variable so that you can in-class initialize it?</strong></p>

<p>My platform is development box is 64bit Windows 7, but I need to build for both 64 and 32 bit platforms.  I'm using VS 2010 and OpenSSL 1.0.0e, though if need be, I can use another one.  I'm trying to create a static library (*.lib) that will be included into a larger project by other developers.  The *.lib seems to compile, but obviously things are not all well since the test program breaks.</p>

<p>I cannot use *.dlls with my program, this has come from on high, therefore I've been trying to statically link my library to libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib.  I've only just begun and like to start slow when using something new, so the only two functions I'm trying to call from SSL are HMAC and EVP_sha512:</p>

<p><code>HMAC(EVP_sha512(), key, keyLen, lpBufferAddr, dwCurBufSize, hashOut, &amp;len);</code></p>

<p>I acknowledge I may be doing it entirely wrong, but there you have it. Honestly, the only thing I need are the crypto functions, and HMAC functions. I could probably use something else, but I've been told to use OpenSSL. Anyway, moving on....</p>

<p>When building the test program that links to my library project (which in turn links to the two OpenSSL libraries), I get the following linking errors:</p>

<pre><code>error LINK2019: unresolved external symbol _HMAC@28 referenced in function ""public: int _thiscall etc""
error LINK2019: unresolved external symbol _EVP_sha512@28 referenced in function ""public: int _thiscall etc""

<p>I include both libraries in ""Additional Dependencies"", and have included their directory in ""Additional Library Dependencies"".</p>

<p>Can anyone help me with this? I've been pouring over this and have come to the unfortunate conclusion I'm a dunce.  Creating static libs from OpenSSL was difficult enough for me, I  admit, and I'm not even convinced I succeeded with x64.  Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>201 - 0 - Jack and Rose
204 - 0 - Bill
206 - 0 - Rose and David
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to do this changing only the MySql query? I need that because the query itself is used, among  the same page, to navigate between the “pages” generated by the php when their count increases after the max messages per page number. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>I am hving a project number - PRJ0012345. But how to find the task / userstory assciated with this project.</p>

<p>I had tried the  following service</p>

<pre><code>https://xyz.service-now.com/pm_project.do?WSDL
</code></pre>

<p>For data retreiving I used the following SOAP url <code>https://xyz.service-now.com/pm_project.do?displayvalue=true&amp;SOAP</code></p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>           private static string url = ""https://xyz.service-now.com/pm_project.do?displayvalue=true&amp;SOAP"";
           private static ServiceNowPMProjectService.getRecordsResponseGetRecordsResult[] recordResults;
           var proxy = new ServiceNow_pm_project
            {
                Url = url,
                Credentials = new NetworkCredential(userName, password)
            };

            var objRecord = new ServiceNowPMProjectService.getRecords
            {
                number = ""PRJ0012156""
            };

            recordResults = proxy.getRecords(objRecord);
</code></pre>

<p>From <code>recordResults</code>, I am not able to figure out how to find the <code>related tasks / userstories</code> associated with this project.</p>

<p>Note: If any other <strong><em>service url</em></strong> is used also, can mention here. I will give a try to find out related userstories / tasks.</p>

<p>Above service url uses <code>pm_project</code> table. Similarly, If some another table name in that url is used also, please mention. Thanks.</p>

<p>He describes why github does not use the git flow workflow described by Vincent Driessen (<a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a>), and we don't use it for the same reasons, where the most important reasons are, that it does not work well with pull requests and it does not fit well to website development where you don't have ""officially released versions of a software product"" but continuously improve the website.</p>

<p>We are developing a large online community in a small team with a lot of old legacy code (some code is more than 10 years old) with bad test coverage. We are using a similar workflow as github, currently we use feature branches for developing, and use pull requests to integrate them into the master branch, do peer reviews, ask for feedback etc. When the feature has been finished and approved by others, it's merged into master. A few times a week we push master to a staging enviroment which is used by our testers, as well as beta users. We try to release the master branch to public every two weeks, so every feature branch which gets merged has to be tested good enough and ""more risky feature branches"" are not merged in the last few days, until the release to public is done.</p>

<p>Thats not a perfect workflow, because when merging of ""risky features"" to master starts again, we can't use master to deploy hotfixes to public anymore. </p>

<p>Github uses continuous delivery for deployment, which is not an option for us, we do need people to test a feature before we can release it to public. </p>

<p>A pull request can only be merged into one branch. So it's a straightforward workflow at github with only one long running branch which is master. Perhaps we should not release every two weeks, but release pull requests when they are merged to master? But that way it's hard to test, we could run the unit-tests we have on the feature branch before it is merged, and we could deploy the branch to staging for beta testers, but that's not always that easy, sometimes you have to do database changes manually (we can't do it automatically, it's too risky because our staging server for beta testers uses the production database), so you have to wait until this is done by admins. And the bigger problem is, if you release only feature branches to the beta users, they are not integrated, they will see new features, and features getting removed perhaps multiple times a day. Not to say that you cannot run integration tests, or you have run them very late just before release, when a feature branch is just merged to master...</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we use 2 long running branches like develop and master as described in git-flow, we can solve the hotfix problem, we could use pull-requests to merge feature branches to develop, we could use a pull request for a release branch for merging recent changes into master, but we can't merge back changes to develop using the pull request workflow.</p>

<p>As you can see in the github flow article (#6 – deploy immediately after review), github engineers can deploy not only to production, but also to a staging environment. And not only engineers can do that, but also support and designers. But how does it work with only one integration branch? You don't need a staging environment if the last pull request is going to production anyway in a few hours or minutes. Sometimes they seem to deploy feature branches to staging, that makes sense, but they are not integrated, so what I described above will happen, you see features coming and going in your staging environment, even if they merge changes from master before deploying a feature-branch to staging (do you think this would be a good idea?).  Or does it make sense to have multiple staging environments, one for every feature branch? But this way again you loose advantages from continuous integration. And as said, I don't think you can do this in a beta testing environment.</p>

<p>I see problems in both workflows, git flow and github flow, I like github flow better, but it seems difficult if you don't have a good test coverage and need more testing by people.</p>

<p><strong>So, how can I integrate and test feature branches, when they need more testing by people (qa and beta testers)?</strong></p>

<p>If you try to slide pane around, theres a good few seconds between when you move the cursor and when the scrollbar and the scroll pane update.

<p>Performance is even worse when trying to draw on a large sized canvas, simple</p>

<pre><code> onKeyPress((a) -&gt; drawText(a.getText(), ...));

<p>takes seconds to process.</p>

<p>(One of the blogs that nicely explains securing MVC is <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rickandy/archive/2012/03/23/securing-your-asp-net-mvc-4-app-and-the-new-allowanonymous-attribute.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>)</p>

<p>To lock down all controllers by default, the <b>AuthorizeAttribute</b> is added to <b>RegisterGlobalFilters</b></p>

<pre><code>public static void RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilterCollection filters)
{
    filters.Add(new HandleErrorAttribute());
    filters.Add(new System.Web.Mvc.AuthorizeAttribute());
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm also seeing examples where something similar is done in the global.asax file:</p>

<pre><code>GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Filters.Add(new System.Web.Http.AuthorizeAttribute());
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that the first statement is to lock down the MVC controllers and the second is to lock down the WebAPI controllers, but when is the second statement needed? If I'm not building WebApi controllers, is the second statement still necessary?</p>

<pre><code> public sealed class Jobs
    {
        public Jobs() { }

        public static void HourlyJob(object state)
        {
            SchedularDBContext schedular = new SchedularDBContext();

            dbSchedular.Message = ""Generated time span = "" + DateTime.Now.ToString();
            schedular.DbSchedulars.Add(dbSchedular);
            schedular.SaveChanges();

            ctx.fillRect(0,0,640,1280);
        &lt;/script&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;This is some text in a paragraph.&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;

<p>And below is my index.js:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.application({

        });

        // Add the new HTMLPanel into the viewport so it is visible
        Ext.Viewport.add(HTMLPanel);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>I am able to see the text ""Some text is here."", but not the canvas that I tried to create using javascript.</p>

<p>Is there any config that needs to be specified? Or any other cause?</p>

<p>Here there is a description of a simple AJAX login form. I have previously asked about the security with using AJAX as a login method and was told that posting password as an AJAX variable is risky compared to a normal page change. This is of course based on desktop web applications, and in this case it is about native phone applications. Is there also a security risk using AJAX for Phonegap Apps?</p>

<p>In the post, the author also mentions a method to store the password and username as local variables to make an automatic login next time they open the application. Is this safe? Storing the login details as plain text in local variables?</p>

<p>I took some time browsing around some websites to see how they handle login AJAX based. To my big surprise, they don't do anything but just post the login details as an array to their login server. Websites such as iCloud and Squarespace, do not do anything with the login details before posting them. Of course they have an SSL certificate on the site, but is that secure enough?</p>

Next I need to leverage another model (Book - which is included in the view), and for each author, I want to find the books they've written that are active.</p>

<p>The Book model has a foreign key to the Author (the author ID or primary Key)</p>

<p>I've got this below ... but it's not working and I'm stumped - any thoughts?</p>

<pre><code>def authors(request):
   _vars = {}
    authors = Author.objects.all()

    #loop through the authors
    for author in authors.object_list:
        books = Book.objects.filter(author=author.pk).filter(is_active=True, author__is_active=True).order_by('-author__author_type__importance').exclude(author__is_active=False)
        author.append(books)

    _vars['authors'] = authors

    return render(request, 'template.html', _vars)
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry: to clarify - I'm unable to run this in debug mode, I am doing this (stupidly) on a live environment. </p>

<p>The server responds with a 500 error and I'm kinda blind as to why. It is this line</p>

<pre><code>        books = Book.objects.filter(author=author.pk).filter(is_active=True, author__is_active=True).order_by('-author__author_type__importance').exclude(author__is_active=False)
</code></pre>

<p>And my suspicion is the primary key lookup. I use the exact same search in a specific Author look up and it works - but when I try to reference the primary key in the for loop it fails</p>

<p>What I want is this to return a list of all the authors (id, name, age etc from my author model) along with a list of their books (book id, book name etc)</p>

<p>I'd have an object where I can go author.name (this is the authors name) or author.books.name (get the name of the book - well it'd be a set of books so I'd need to iterate through - but you get the idea right?)</p>

<p>The template might look like</p>

<pre><code>{% for author in authors %}
    Name: {{ author.name }}
    Age: {{ author.age }}
    {% for book in author.books %}
        Title: {{ book.title }}
        Published: {{ book.published }}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

I am getting ready to move it out as part of a tool to the entire group.  I am interested in improving this a bit more before I role it out to everyone.  It is called from methods that have error handling in place so that part is not an issue.  Also this works perfectly in our logic the way we flatten objects for change tracking, but am I missing something that could be an issue even though it works perfectly for the usual situations.</p>

<pre><code>public class ChangeTracker
{
    public static string GetChangesString&lt;T,S&gt;(T original, T current, S dto, string[] exluded)
    {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

            object propB = current.GetType().GetProperty(item.Name).GetValue(original, null);

            if (propA == null &amp;&amp; propB != null)
            {
                //appendline for value added
            }
            else if (propB == null &amp;&amp; propA != null)
            {

            {
                //appendline for value changed
            }



        }

        return sb.ToString();



    }

    private static string GetDisplayName(PropertyInfo prop)
    {
        string display = string.Empty;
        //Check for displayattribute and set correct name
        return display;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Specifically this is my question.</p>

<p>Is there a better way I can do the propA and propB setting to improve performance?  It works on one object changing and I have tested it up to 103 properties with no performance issues, but I try to avoid stuff like this when I can.</p>

<p>In Jobs, there is <code>set&lt;Tasks&gt;</code>. In task there is <code>JobsId</code> It is trying to set again the Jobs Object and going through the loop. Again there is <code>set&lt;Process&gt;</code>, it is mapping to <code>tasks</code> And goes through loop. Then finally when I m replying for result as JSON in web browser, it gives error.</p>

<p>What I want is, when I retrieve <code>List&lt;Jobs&gt;</code>, I want tasks, then inside tasks, I don't want the hibernate to set value for <code>jobs</code> object. And also in <code>Process</code> I dont want to set for <code>tasks</code> object.</p>

<p>I tried adding <code>@Transient</code> (javax.persistence) in each of those fields which is annotated as <code>@ManyToOne</code>.</p>

<p>But I get the following error</p>

<p>However, if I open the connection with the SQL Server Management Console (2008), and execute the sproc, the query returns in about 4 seconds with 2 rows of data.</p>

<p>I suspect some kind of driver issue, but I'm not at all sure where to look. I'm hoping that some kind of configuration modification (on either the server, or the ADO client) might fix this, but so far my searches for answers via google have not turned up any useful hints.</p>

<p>So I turn to you.</p>

<p>Any ideas ?</p>

I know I'm declaring N inside the class definition as a private variable but I have to do so because N is a parameter related to the module which is defined as an instance of the class SLF and it is read from the configurations of this module using the OMNET++ defined function ""par"".</p>

<p>If I declare<code>MyReg[N]</code>inside the    initialize    function it works but the problem is that I need to use this variable inside the other function (<code>handleMessage</code>). Any hints?</p>

<p>The div is hidden now, but try try this- View this in safari and open the developer tools. If you go to the safari div and click off display none the video will reappear. Now, click on it again to hide it and you will notice that it does not hide. Why would this be an issue, you may wonder? Well I'm working with a carousel for youtube videos and it works by hiding inactive videos. In the most reason version of safari, 5.1.7, the videos simply will not go away. Does anyone know a fix for this? I've tried hiding it with opacity, height, width, and visibility but you can still see it there in Safari. Anyone have any ideas?</p>

After the user finished with the current image, he can load a next one.</p>

<p>I have some experience with Java, and I think this wouldn't be too hard in Swing. But MATLAB seems like not having the purpose of creating such an advanced GUI. However, the whole project until now is in MATLAB, so it would be nice if I could manage to do it. Any help? Hints? Things I should look at?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Sorry, this is a little lengthy to explain. Please let me know if something's not clear.</p>

<p>The title is my goal. I have a local server set up with Apache2. I don't know if it matters, but I have dnsmasq set up to redirect, for example, site.dev/index.html to /home/wastvedt/Projects/site/www/index.html (<a href=""http://daniel.hahler.de/easy-dns-wildcard-setup-for-local-domains-using-dnsmasq"" rel=""nofollow"">described here</a>). </p>

<p>I've followed the tutorials I can find. XDebug is running, I have the helper installed in Chromium, and the debugger, interpreter, and web server set up in Aptana.</p>

<p>I'm working on a WordPress site and want to break on one of the functions in my theme's functions.php file. I created a breakpoint in the function in Aptana, turned on the XDebug helper in Chromium, and updated a post, which calls the function in question. Aptana recognizes what I'm doing and prompts me with the option of breaking on the first line. Regardless of what I select, I see ""XDebug JIT Session [Remote Launch]"" in the Debug view. The prompt appears three times, but nothing else happens in Aptana.</p>

<p>I think the problem might have something to do with linking files in the editor to files in Apache. When I try this JIT debugging thing with ""localhost"" (located at /home/wastvedt/apache2/www/index.php), Aptana brings up /home/wastvedt/Projects/site/www/index.php. This isn't right, but maybe the real problem is somewhere else. To be honest I'm a little lost now.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? I'd provide some sort of dump or output, but I'm not sure which or what. </p>

I'm using <a href=""http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/older-versions/models-%28data%29/validating-with-a-service-layer-cs"" rel=""nofollow"">the techniques described in this post</a> to separate my validation concerns to a Services layer.</p>

<p>This post has a <strong>TL;DR</strong> at the end if you want to skip to the specific question.</p>

<p>Here is my <code>ApiController</code> code:</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize]
public class FriendsController : ApiController
{
    private IItemService _service;

    public FriendsController()
    {
        _service = new ItemService(new HttpModelStateWrapper(ModelState), new ViewModelRepository());
    }

    public FriendsController(IItemService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    // GET api/friends
    public IEnumerable&lt;User&gt; Get()
    {
        return _service.GetFriends(User.Identity.Name);
    }


 .
 .
 .

    // POST api/friends
    public void Post(Guid id)
    {
        var user = _service.AddFriend(User.Identity.Name, id);  // Handles error and should update ViewModel
        NotificationAsyncController.AddNotification(user);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the code for <code>_service.AddFriend(User.Identity.Name, id);</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public User AddFriend(string userName, Guid id)
    {
        try
        {
            return _repository.AddFriend(userName, id);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            _validationDictionary.AddError(""AddFriend"", e.Message);
            return null;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>_validationDictionary</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class HttpModelStateWrapper : IValidationDictionary
{
    private ModelStateDictionary ModelState;

    public HttpModelStateWrapper(ModelStateDictionary ModelState)
    {
        this.ModelState = ModelState;
    }

    public void AddError(string key, string errorMessage)
    {
        if (ModelState != null)
            ModelState.AddModelError(key, errorMessage);
    }

    public bool IsValid
    {
        get { return ModelState == null ? false : ModelState.IsValid; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well, I found out that if <code>_repository.AddFriend(userName, id);</code> throws an error and <code>_validationDictionary.AddError(""AddFriend"", e.Message);</code> is called, the ModelState object that is in <code>_validationDictionary</code> does not update the ModelState object that resides in the <code>FriendsController</code>.</p>

<p>In other words, after <code>AddError</code> is called, the ModelState in the <code>HttpModelStateWrapper</code> is not valid, but once that method returns and scope is returned to the <code>FriendsController</code>, its ModelState has not updated and is still valid!</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>How do I get the ModelState object that I've passed into the <code>HttpModelStateWrapper</code> in the ctor of the <code>FriendsController</code> have its changes reflected in the ModelState object of the <code>FriendsController</code>?</p>

                //info( any2str(dataReader.get_Item( ""LEVEL"" ))); // not working
            }
            dataReader.Dispose();
        }
        catch

        }
        catch(Exception::CLRError)
        {

    {
        connection.Dispose();
    }
    command.Dispose();
    CodeAccessPermission::revertAssert();
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are four codelines to access data:</p>

<pre><code>//info( dataReader.get_Item( ""PRODID"" )); // ok
//info( dataReader.get_Item( ""LEVEL"" )); // not working
info ( int2str( dataReader.GetInt32( 23 ))); // not working
//info( any2str(dataReader.get_Item( ""LEVEL"" ))); // not working
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, only one line won't throw an error, since datatype of field fits to the desired operation. Info-logging is just an example. If I try to assign data to ax-table-fields, the same problem occurs.
Casting via <code>int2str()</code>, <code>any2str()</code> and so on doesn't work as well.</p>

<p>So what's the right way to handle data read, for further processing?</p>

This is all done in traditional Excel; However, this sheet has some problems, namely that I have to duplicate the sheet myself and change it for each month in the future (I am in a remote part of Africa where the people are not computer literate, and so the interface must be very simple).</p>

<p>I have recently discovered VBA Macros and have been writing them for this sheet.  I have so far written a userform that has dropdown menus for month and year, and when you hit enter, the program duplicates a ""master"" document, autopopulates the dates across the top and saves the workbook as the input month and year.  My questions are: How do I delete the last columns in the new workbook?  In the Master sheet, there are 31 columns, but not all months have 31 days, so I want to delete the unnecessary columns, without deleting the ""total"" column that comes after.  Once I have formatted the document, I would like to import the previous month's data from the last column of that inventory sheet.</p>

<p>This is the part of the code I am struggling with.  I want to be able to delete the extra columns that are automatically filled in with the first couple of days of the next month, e.g., 28-Feb-16 then 1-Mar-16 then 2-Mar-16, where I can have the program find the March dates and delete their associated columns.</p>

<p>This works great to scroll items, such as the UILabel here when they appear outside of the view. However, the problem that I'm having is that when the TextView becomes larger than the screen, it begins adding an exponential amount of padding between the UIView and the UIScrollView, and then scrolls to the bottom. I do not have a constraint from the bottom of the ScrollView to the bottom of the UIView because when I add this, it no longer scrolls at all. Here are my constraints for my main views:</p>

<p>How can I make this padding go away? Is there something new in iOS8 that provides a logical solution for UIScrollViews and expanding UITextViews? Help!</p>

<p>Here is my example code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    A() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Made A.\n"";
    }
    void doThing() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""A did a thing.\n"";
    };
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Made B.\n"";
    }
    void doThing() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""B did a thing.\n"";
    };
};

class C : public A {
public:
    C() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Made C.\n"";
    }
    void doThing() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""C did a thing.\n"";
    };
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""\n"";

    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Make objects: \n"";
    A a;
    B b;
    C c;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Call objects normally: \n"";
    a.doThing();
    b.doThing();
    c.doThing();

    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Call objects as their parent type from a vector: \n"";
    vector&lt;A&gt; vect;
    vect.push_back(a); vect.push_back(b); vect.push_back(c);

    for(int i=0;i&lt;vect.size();i++)
        vect.data()[i].doThing();

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the output I get:</p>

<pre><code>Make objects: 
Made A.
Made A.
Made B.
Made A.
Made C.
Call objects normally: 
A did a thing.
B did a thing.
C did a thing.
Call objects as their parent type from a vector: 
A did a thing.
A did a thing.
A did a thing.
</code></pre>

<p>This same code in another language (like Java) would produce this output:</p>

<pre><code>Make objects: 
Made A.
Made B.
Made C.
Call objects normally: 
A did a thing.
B did a thing.
C did a thing.
Call objects as their parent type from a vector: 
A did a thing.
B did a thing.
C did a thing.

<p>However, there are times in my application that the 5 <code>RadioButtons</code> are disabled, and then re-enabled.  When this happens the <code>VisualState</code> for the <strong>Checked</strong> <code>RadioButton</code> doesn't activate.  Instead, all 5 <code>RadioButtons</code> appear as the <strong>Normal</strong> state.</p>

<h2>Why is this happening?  How can I resolve this?</h2>

<p>Here is the example of the <code>RadioButtons</code> that I'm using.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3o4Ep.png"" alt=""RadioButton VisualStates""></p>

<p>If I start by selecting the first group of 5 <code>RadioButtons</code>, and make a selection, then everything may appear as the above image does.</p>

<p>But, if I select the second group of 5 <code>RadioButtons</code>, my control is designed so that the first group will disable.  This works fine, and the second group enables properly.  After that, if I select the first group again, every <code>Radiobutton</code> will appear with the <strong>Normal VisualState</strong>.  This is a problem, because my program knows that behind the scenes that <strong>#1</strong> is still <strong>Checked</strong>.  The <strong>Checked VisualState</strong> is NOT triggered, so it looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RUBNX.png"" alt=""RadioButton VisualStates (error)""></p>

<p>The goal here is that the <strong>Checked</strong> <code>VisualState</code> will be resumed as it appears in the first image.</p>

<p>Here is the corresponding XAML code for the <code>VisualStates</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups&gt;
    &lt;VisualStateGroup x:Name=""CommonStates""&gt;
        &lt;VisualState Name=""Normal""/&gt;
        &lt;VisualState Name=""Disabled""&gt;
            &lt;Storyboard&gt;
                &lt;ColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=""FillBrush"" Storyboard.TargetProperty=""Color"" To=""#FFEEEEEE"" Duration=""0""/&gt;
                &lt;ColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=""StrokeBrush"" Storyboard.TargetProperty=""Color"" To=""#FF777777"" Duration=""0""/&gt;
                &lt;DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=""MoodEllipse"" Storyboard.TargetProperty=""StrokeThickness"" To=""1"" Duration=""0""/&gt;
                &lt;ColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=""Presenter"" Storyboard.TargetProperty=""(TextBlock.Foreground).Color"" To=""#FF777777"" Duration=""0""/&gt;
            &lt;/Storyboard&gt;
        &lt;/VisualState&gt;
    &lt;/VisualStateGroup&gt;
    &lt;VisualStateGroup x:Name=""CheckStates""&gt;
        &lt;VisualState Name=""Checked""&gt;
            &lt;Storyboard&gt;
                &lt;ParallelTimeline&gt;
                    &lt;ColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=""FillBrush"" Storyboard.TargetProperty=""Color"" To=""#FFC5F5FF"" Duration=""0:0:0.05""/&gt;
                    &lt;ColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=""StrokeBrush"" Storyboard.TargetProperty=""Color"" To=""#FF12394F"" Duration=""0:0:0.05""/&gt;
                    &lt;DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=""MoodEllipse"" Storyboard.TargetProperty=""StrokeThickness"" To=""2"" Duration=""0:0:0.05""/&gt;
                &lt;/ParallelTimeline&gt;
            &lt;/Storyboard&gt;
        &lt;/VisualState&gt;
        &lt;VisualState Name=""Unchecked""/&gt;
        &lt;VisualState Name=""Indeterminate""/&gt;
    &lt;/VisualStateGroup&gt;
&lt;/VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This XAML code seems to be in accordance to how to use <code>VisualStates</code>, but I suppose there must be something wrong with it.</p>

<p>I've referenced these pages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee230084(v=vs.110).aspx#specifying_the_behavior_of_a_control_when_it_transitions_between_states"" rel=""nofollow"">Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751600(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">RadioButton Styles and Templates</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As some additional notes, I've noticed that the <strong>Checked</strong> <code>VisualState</code> can be triggered if I click one of the <strong>Unchecked</strong> <code>RadioButtons</code>.  At this point, everything is works properly --until the group of <code>RadioButtons</code> is disabled &amp; re-enabled.</p>

<p>Also, I've experience even stranger behavior for the <strong>Checked</strong> <code>VisualState</code> when I didn't include the empty <strong>Unchecked</strong> <code>VisualState</code> in the above XAML code.</p>

<p>Any insight about why the <code>VisualStates</code> are behaving strangely would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks much!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure if it matters, but the group of <code>RadioButtons</code> are disabled because they are in <code>StackPanels</code> whose <code>IsEnabled</code> property is bound to the outside <code>RadioButton</code>'s <code>IsChecked</code> property:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;StackPanel IsEnabled=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type RadioButton}}, Path=IsChecked}""&gt;

I want to be able to compare different loan stats based on the interest rate percentage. So, if I enter 50000 as the loan amount and want to see some stats based on a 4% interest rate and a 6% interest rate, I'll get a dynamically added table with those calculations. </p>

<p>So, a user can enter as many interest rates as he/she wants for comparison and see different stats (like, how long it will take to pay off) of the loan amount.</p>

<p>Problem: Since users can enter as many percentage rates as they want (dynamically inserted  ), I have to loop over each one to calculate stuff. I got that down, but if the page does not re-load and the user clicks the link to add another input box to compare another percentage rate and then clicks the button to calculate again, the new percentage rate is added to the table PLUS all of the previous percentage rates added again. </p>

<p>I know why this is happening ( I guess it's expected with .each() ), <strong>but how do I code it so  the table will only add the new cell and not the new cell + all of the old cells again.</strong></p>

<p>Sorry, for the long explanation. Click the link below to see what a working example. Remember, add some % rates and loan amount and click calculate, but don't refresh and add some more % rates and click calculate again. Don't worry about the math or how I'm getting the numbers. It doesn't matter for now; I'm just trying to get the preliminary stuff to work. THanks.!</p>

(<em>In this very example -- for ""li"" elements to disappear separatly with every element separate animation (some delay between every element) (but that's not so important)</em>).</p>

<p><em>(I consider here just will be a full replacement of elements (let's say not to be bothered much if new data contains items with the same id... that's complicated, I understand that)).</em></p>

<p>As I understand, that might be pretty tough, and I should consider to change/extend Knockoutjs sources (right?) to deal with ""<strong><em>start-disappearing-animation</em></strong>"", ""<strong><em>disappearing-animation-finished</em></strong>"", ""<strong><em>start-appearing-animation</em></strong>"".</p>

<p>But is there at least any way <strong>to prevent knockout to delete existent DOM elements</strong> (<em>for me to handle that manually</em>)... some way to ""detach"" them from container.</p>

<p>But, I don't know how does this jQuery function work, how to implement it and how do I have to rewrite the required code. </p>

<p>When the code loads, the images load too? </p>

<p>It's possible to do a MySQL request by PHP?</p>

<p>I'm so lost :S</p>

<p>Thank you a lot!</p>

<p>Because <code>.hidden</code> div is not displayed, how can I check does the browser firstly loads all its children images, or maybe jumps outside the hidden div, in order to loading visible images firstly ?</p>

<p>If not, is there a way to write such an instruction, using javascript, or somehow else.</p>

After exhaustive checking I have narrowed things down to two scenario's. Before you respond please try this for yourself as proof. VS2010 or VS2012 ASP.Net project. I guarantee you this will NOT work.</p>

<p>I consider myself an experienced .net developer and code like this would normally be very trivial indeed for me but I am absolutely stumped with this one.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

<p>In my default.aspx <strong>Page_Load</strong> event page I have this code and nothing else</p>

<pre><code>if (!IsPostBack)
{
     cboDept1.DataSource = GetTeamGroups();
     cboDept1.DataValueField = ""Value"";
     cboDept1.DataTextField = ""Text"";
     cboDept1.DataBind();
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this version of the <strong>GetTeamGroups</strong> function code the dropdownlist works as expected, the list is preserved and I can get the <strong>SelectedItem</strong> etc. with no problems after each postback.</p>

<pre><code>private List&lt;ListItem&gt; GetTeamGroups()
{
    List&lt;ListItem&gt; oList = new List&lt;ListItem&gt;();

    oList.Add(new ListItem(""1"", ""1""));
    oList.Add(new ListItem(""2"", ""2""));
    oList.Add(new ListItem(""3"", ""3""));
    oList.Add(new ListItem(""4"", ""4""));

    return oList;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thats not practical where I want to get my list from a function (database, or webservice). But this version of the <strong>GetTeamGroups</strong> function this the dropdownlist is reset with each postback. I CANNOT get the SelectedItem. (PS. It doesn't really matter what code you use to dynamically fill the list, the problem is the same. Seems like the list cannot be filled dynamically for this to work).</p>

<pre><code>private List&lt;ListItem&gt; GetTeamGroups()
{
    List&lt;ListItem&gt; oList = new List&lt;ListItem&gt;();

    string[] sGroups = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""Groups""].ToString().Split(';');

    int iCount = 0;

    foreach (string sGroup in sGroups)
    {
        oList.Add(new ListItem(sGroup, iCount.ToString()));
    }

    return oList;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have read numerous articles suggesting that the viewstate may help. No combination of viewstate on the control or page resolves the problem. The list is ALWAYS reset.</p>

<p>My question refers to the <code>options</code> list. Is there a way to implement the <code>options</code> list that would allow me to manipulate it in both <code>options.append</code> locations?</p>

"2050790","1","2051159","","2010-01-12 17:08:50","","184","116111","<p>Brief background: Many (most?) contemporary programming languages in widespread use have at least a handful of ADTs [abstract data types] in common, in particular,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>string</strong> (a (sequence comprised of characters)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>list</strong> (an ordered collection of values), and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>map-based type</strong> (an unordered array that maps keys to values)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the R programming language, the first two are implemented as <em>character</em> and <em>vector</em>, respectively.</p>

<p>When I began learning R, two things were obvious almost from the start: List is the most important data type in R (because it is the parent class for the R <em>Data Frame</em>), and second, I just couldn't understand how they worked, at least not well enough to use them correctly in my code.</p>

<p>For one thing, it seemed to me that R's <em>List</em> data type was a straightforward implementation of the map ADT (<em>dictionary</em> in Python, <em>NSMutableDictionary</em> in Objective C, <em>hash</em> in Perl and Ruby, <em>object literal</em> in Javascript, and so forth).</p>

<p>For instance, you create them just like you would a Python dictionary, by passing key-value pairs to a constructor (which in Python is <em>dict</em> not <em>list</em>):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = list(""ev1""=10, ""ev2""=15, ""rv""=""Group 1"")
</code></pre>

<p>And you access the items of an R List just like you would those of a Python dictionary, e.g., x['ev1']. Likewise, you can retrieve just the 'keys' or just the 'values' by: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; names(x)    # fetch just the 'keys' of an R list
      ""ev1"" ""ev2"" ""rv""

&gt;&gt;&gt; unlist(x)   # fetch just the 'values' of an R list
      10 15 ""Group1""

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = list(""a""=6, ""b""=9, ""c""=3)  

&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(unlist(x))
      18
</code></pre>

<p>but R Lists are also <strong><em>unlike</em></strong> other map-type ADTs (from among the languages I've learned anyway). My guess is that this is a consequence of the initial spec for S, i.e., an intention to design a data/statistics DSL [domain-specific language] from the ground-up. </p>

<p><em>three</em> significant differences between R Lists and mapping types in other languages in widespread use (e.g,. Python, Perl, JavaScript):</p>

<p><em>first</em>, Lists in R are an <em>ordered</em> collection, just like vectors, even
    though the values are keyed (ie, the keys can be any hashable value not just sequential integers). Nearly always, the mapping data type in
    other languages is <em>unordered</em>.</p>

<p><em>second</em>, Lists can be returned from functions even though you never passed in
    a List when you called the function, and <em>even though</em> the function that returned the list
    doesn't contain an (explicit) List constructor (Of course, you can deal with this in practice by wrapping the returned result in a call to <em>unlist</em>):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = strsplit(LETTERS[1:10], """")     # passing in an object of type 'character'

&gt;&gt;&gt; class(x)                            # returns 'list', not a vector of length 2
      list
</code></pre>

<p>A <em>third</em> peculiar feature of R's Lists: it doesn't seem that they can
        be members of another ADT, and if you try to do that then the
        primary container is coerced to a list. E.g.,</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.23, list(0.5, 0.2, 0.9), recursive=T)

&gt;&gt;&gt; class(x)
      list
</code></pre>

<p>my intention here is not to criticize the language or how it is documented; likewise, I'm not suggesting there is anything wrong with the List data structure or how it behaves. All I'm after is to correct is my understanding of how they work so I can correctly use them in my code. </p>

<p>Here are the sorts of things I'd like to better understand:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the rules which determine when a function call will return a List (e.g., <em>strsplit</em> expression recited above)?</p></li>
<li><p>If i don't explicitly assign names to a list (e.g., list(10,20,30,40)) are the default names just sequential integers beginning with 1?  (I assume, but i am far from certain that the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be able to coerce this type of List to a vector w/ a call to <em>unlist</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>why do these two different operators, [], and [[]], return the <em>same</em> result?</p>

<p>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</p>

<p>both expressions return ""1"":</p>

<pre><code>x[1]

x[[1]]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>why do these two expressions <strong>not</strong> return the same result?</p>

<pre><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)

x2 = list(1:4)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>please don't point me to the R Documentation (<a href=""http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/list""><code>?list</code></a>, <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-intro.html#Lists""><code>R-intro</code></a>)--i have read it carefully and it does not help me answer the type of questions i recited just above.</p>

<p>(lastly, I recently learned of and began using an R Package (available on CRAN) called <a href=""http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/packages/info/?hash""><strong><em>hash</em></strong></a> which implements <em>conventional</em> map-type behavior via an S4 class; i can certainly recommend this Package.)</p>

But I’m not sure what is meant by that.</p>

<p>What or how exactly would you be able to add an extra item if you were allow to explicitly create a data object? Would you basically be able to bind control to data source and let the runtime  automatically fill the control with data source’s data , and additionally that control could also get an extra item from data source by manually creating it?! How would it be able to do that?!  </p>

<p>My gridView consists of few BoundField and TamplateFields. When I want to sort by proper BoundField I put proper string to property FilterExpression. For example:</p>

<p>Field in GridView:
<code>&lt;asp:BoundField DataField=""identifier"" HeaderText=""Case number"" SortExpression=""identifier"" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>so I set
<code>FilterExpression = ""[identifier] LIKE '%"" + txtCaseNumber.Text + ""%'""</code></p>

<p>where <em>identifier</em> is DataField in BoundField and In this case everything is ok.
But when I want to select proper rows from column wihich name equal Fininish from TempateField I don't know how I should do it.
Exaple of TemplateField looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:TemplateField HeaderText=""Status"" SortExpression=""Status""&gt;
                    &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;

<p>Thanks for help.</p>

<p>It's ok but I forgot mention that I have my own user contron (ucCaseFilter) which consists of DropDownList from which I choose status. For example: Failed, InProgress, Finish ...   Inside this control I create public property Filter and I want to assign string value which will be select proper column and sort them .</p>

<pre><code>Filter = ""[???] = '"" + ddlCaseStatus.SelectedValue + ""'""; 
</code></pre>

<p>Then in gridView use it:</p>

<pre><code>FilterExpression = ucCaseFilter.Filter;

I know which line is throwing the exceptions, and it looks something like this:</p>

        //...
</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of references in there, and any of them could be the problem. However, <code>NullReferenceException</code> itself doesn't seem to capture which reference blew up. The fact that I'm passing in a lambda presents another challenge: As far as I can tell, I can't step through the lambda during debugging and see which members of <code>r</code> are null.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can do one or both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have Visual Studio tell me exactly which reference threw the <code>NullReferenceException</code>?</li>
<li>Failing that, is there a way to make the debugger step through the lambda expression (or just hover over things to see their values) as it's being evaluated by <code>Any</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like there must be a way to do these things, but I can't seem to find it. I'm on VS2010 Premium, and I have Resharper, VS Power Tools, and a couple other extensions installed. If there's an add-on that does this, I'd be fine with that.</p>

<h1>Edit:</h1>

<p>As Eric Lippert points out, it's impossible to pinpoint the source of an NR exception when the code has been compiled in Release configuration. I'm only asking about working in debug mode. If Visual Studio (or some extension to VS) can track the source of a reference while debugging, that would answer my question.</p>

<h1>Edit 2:</h1>

<p>The second question--how to break and step through a lambda--has been answered, but I'd still like to know if there's an automatic way to track down a null reference.</p>

<p>Am I right in assuming that it is significant which compiler Boost.Build is built with? If so, how do I get past this problem?

<p>after submitting the form, if the the form have validation errors it will be returned to the user to re-fill and correct the errors, but the form didn't returned with its all values, so the selected radio button will returns not selected, and also the dropDownList of cities, so how to retain all values of the form if it not submitted?
I hope that my question is clear.</p>

<p>I now would like to use this approach on top of a class hierarchy where every class might have getter and setter which can be registered as pair within a vector or array to be able to call the getter and setter if needed. GUIObject and GUICompositeObject are example classes out of the described class hierarchy.
The bound_mem_fun_t for the objects have unfortunately different types and thats the reason I don't know how to integrate them into an array/vector of pointers to the functors.</p>

<p>In c++11 I would use std::function. Is there a way to emulate this in c++98? </p>

<p>Because our compiler support only c++98 I cannot use the new features of c++11 or c++14. Also boost is not allowed.</p>

"20309909","1","20370809","","2013-12-01 07:43:51","","1","365","<p>I am trying to build a class that <strong>insert array of values</strong> into oracle database, I am also trying to make the class <strong>scalable</strong> (works with all forms of the application).</p>

<p>the reason am doing this is to reduce code repeating for the application am working on, <strong>because it has a lot of forms, and some of them has a lot of variables (50+)</strong>.. therefore I need to make a class capable of inserting values into table, where the number of values is dynamic (depending on the form).</p>

<p>so far what I did is:</p>

<pre><code>class ArrayQuery {

    public $conn;
    public $table;


    public function __construct($conn){

        $this-&gt;conn = $conn;
    }

    public function setTableName($table)
    {
        $this-&gt;table = $table;
    }

    public function InsertArray(array $args){

        $keys = array_keys($args);
        $values = array_values($args);

             // need help here //

    }
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>The construct function will get database connection, by calling the $conn object from the db_connection class (e.g $conn = new db_connection(); $query = new ArrayQuery($conn);)</p></li>
<li><p>setTableName is obviously for defining the desired table.</p></li>
<li>now the ArrayQuery, what I did in my form page, I named the keys of the array the same as the name of columns in table, for example array args['id']= $_post['id']. so basically <strong>array_key = column name</strong>. I did that in order to get columns name without manually setting them.</li>
</ul>

<p>now I have 2 arrays: <strong>$keys</strong> (holds the name of columns), and <strong>$values</strong> (holds the data to be insert).</p>

<p>I cant figure out <strong>how to bind variables into keys? knowing that the number of variables is dynamic ?</strong></p>

<p>any help will be much appreciated</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Here is how the $args array are set</p>

<pre><code>$args = array(
          'id' =&gt; $_POST['id'],
          'firstname' =&gt; $_POST['firstname'],
          'lastname' =&gt; $_POST['lastname'],
          'email' =&gt; $_POsT['email'],
)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>answer:</strong></p>

<p>thanks to @calculon for putting me on the right track, with little modifications to work in my scenario, for future reference the answer to my case is: </p>

<pre><code>$i=0; $col=''; $val='';
        foreach ($args as $key =&gt; $value) {
               if($i==0){
                 $col .= $key;
                 $val .= ':'.$key;
               }
               else{
               $col .= ', '.$key;
               $val .= ', :'.$key;
               }
               $i++;
         }

        $sql = 'INSERT INTO '.$table.' ('.$col.') VALUES ('.$val.') ';
        $stmt = oci_parse($this-&gt;conn, $sql);
        foreach ($args as $key =&gt; $value) {
              oci_bind_by_name($stmt, $key, $args[$key]) ;
            }

    $rootScope = _$rootScope_;
    url = _url_;

    //questo serve per iniettare httpBackend
    $httpBackend = $injector.get('$httpBackend');

    $httpBackend.when('POST', url.login, {username:     ""me@stuff.it"",password:""pass""}).respond({success: true, user:{""id"":""8490394"",""username"": ""me"",""token"": ""asd8u09u900asduijjaijjHJ""}});

    $httpBackend.whenPOST(url.login).respond(403, {success: false, message: 'Wrong username or password'});
  }));

it('should return user object', function () {

    //se i valori sono corretti ritona un oggetto che contiene l'utente

        f = res;
      }); //end login

      //this trigger the promise
      $rootScope.$digest();

      //this trigger the http request
      $httpBackend.flush();

      expect(f).toEqual({success: true, user:{""id"":""8490394"",""username"": ""me"",""token"": ""asd8u09u900asduijjaijjHJ""}});
    }); //end inject
  });
</code></pre>

<p>They work perfectly if I remove the fake backend config from app.js, instead if I leave it there Karma report: <code>Error: No pending request to flush !</code></p>

<p>I think that this is beacause of the interceptors declared in app.js are triggered and prevent the $httpBackend defined in the test to be triggered on a request.</p>

<p>Any idea on how to solve this issue?</p>

I'm setting the SVG's width to 100% using CSS. This should let the SVG scale to its wrapping container, maintaining the aspect ratio set up by the viewBox.  In Chrome and Firefox, this works perfectly!</p>

<p>Here's a minimal codepen example of what I'm talking about:
<a href=""http://codepen.io/pcorey/pen/amkGl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/pcorey/pen/amkGl</a></p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;svg viewBox=""0 0 100 10""&gt;
    &lt;text x=""1"" y=""9""&gt;hello&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>div {
  width: 400px;
}

svg {
  width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
  outline: 1px solid tomato;
}

text {
  font-size: 10px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The viewBox is 100x10. The outer div is set to have a 400px width. That means that the SVG's height should be (and is in Chrome/Firefox) 40px. BUT, in IE 11, the width is ALWAYS 150px (even when the div's width exceeds 1500px...)</p>

<p>Is there a nice way to fix this in IE? Why can't IE handle the unknown height correctly? I can use the ""<a href=""http://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video/"" rel=""nofollow"">intrinsic aspect ratio</a>"" trick, but that is super ugly, requires another DOM element, and requires that I recompute the padding-top every time the wrapper resizes.</p>

<p>For more info on why I want to do this, I wrote a quick blog post about it: <a href=""http://1pxsolidtomato.com/2014/10/08/quest-for-scalable-svg-text/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1pxsolidtomato.com/2014/10/08/quest-for-scalable-svg-text/</a></p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>It seems that there is a problem with the downme execution, since I am getting a 404 Not Found error when i execute it (even only with the alert). Why might this be happening?</p>

The method is raised by a constructor of the derived class and by some methods or properties in it.
I need to determine if that came from inside the instance constructor of that derived class or after that (in runtime).</p>

<p>The following example explains what I need:</p>

<pre><code>public class Base
{
    public Base()
    {

    }

    protected void OnSomeAction(object sender)
    {
        // if from derived constructor EXIT, else CONTINUE
    }
}

public class Derived : Base
{
    public void Raise()
    {
        base.OnSomeAction(this); // YES if not called by constructor
    }

    public Derived()
    {
        base.OnSomeAction(this); // NO
        Raise(); // NO
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var c = new Derived(); // NO (twice)
        c.Raise(); // YES
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I cannot change the signature or arguments because I cannot alter derived classes. Basically what I was thinking is to determine if the derived class (sender) is fully constructed.</p>

<p>So the implementation is as is. I cannot do changes in the base class that break derived classes. I can do changes only to the base class :/</p>

<p>Is this possible in some way, good or not? Even some reflection magic or similar hacky approach is unfortunately welcome as this is a must :/.</p>

<p>Assembly 1</p>

<pre><code>public static class Foo
{
    public static string DoStuff()
    {
        // Do something

        return ""some string"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Assembly 2:</p>

<pre><code>public class Bar
{
    public void SomeMethod()
    {
        // I realize the below is not what should be done for catching exceptions, as the exception is never thrown due to the return, and seems unnecessary either way... 
        // this is inherited code and has not been modified to correct.

        try
        {
            var someValue = Foo.DoStuff();
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            return;
            throw;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Requirements changed so that DoStuff would need to take in a parameter, the value of which would change the behavior slightly.  Note that only assembly 1.Foo is changing.</p>

<p>New Foo</p>

<pre><code>public static class Foo
{
    public static string DoStuff(bool someBool = false)
    {
        // Do something

        return ""some string"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This recompiled fine, and Assembly 2 was able to successfully utilize the changed method signature without complaint.  My check in was performed, and project dlls that had changes were promoted (note this was only Assembly 1 dll).</p>

<p>After promotion we found out that Assembly 2 was failing on the Foo.DoStuff() call - unfortunately I cannot provide an exception as the above code was swallowing it.</p>

<p>Even though no actual code changed in Assembly 2, it did seem to have an impact on the dll on recompile, even though the method signature - at least in my mind - is the same due to providing a default value for the new parameter.</p>

<p>I used dotnet peek in order to peek at the ""old dll"" and the ""new dlls"" (even though no code change to that assembly and did note a difference in the two DLLs in that in the old DLL, the default value parameter was not supplied, but in the recompiled, the default value parameter was supplied.</p>

<p>I guess my question(s) boil down to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does the compiled code on assembly 2 change based on a method signature that (at least I think) should be transparent?</li>
<li>Would the method of avoiding a situation like this just be ""deploy everything""? Rather than trying to deploy based on code changes?  Note that DLLs are not checked in, so there was no actual ""code change"" to assembly 2, though the DLL was different based on the changes to Assembly 1.</li>
</ol>

I've managed to get OpenCVSharp integrated into the Unity editor and currently have eye-detection (not tracking) working within a game. It can find your eyes within a webcam image, then display where its currently detected them on a texture, which I display within the scene. </p>

<p>However its causing a HUGE fps drop, mainly because every frame its converting a webcam texture into an IPLimage so that OpenCV can handle it. It then has to convert it back to a 2Dtexture to be displayed within the scene, after its done all the eye detection. So understandably its too much for the CPU to handle. (As far as I can tell its only using 1 core on my CPU).</p>

<p>Is there a way to do all the eye detection without converting the texture to an IPLimage? Or any other way to fix the fps drop. Some things that I've tried include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Limiting the frames that it updates on. However this just causes it
to run smoothly, then stutter horribly on the frame that it has to
update.</p></li>
<li><p>Looking at threading, but as far as I'm aware Unity doesn't allow it.
As far as I can tell its only using 1 core on my CPU which seems a bit silly. If there was a way to change this it could fix the issue?</p></li>
<li><p>Tried different resolutions on the camera, however the resolution that the game can actually run smoothly at, is too small for the eye's to actually be detected, let alone tracked.</p></li>

<p>I have the four font files...</p>

<ul>
<li>fontawesome-webfont.eot</li>
<li>fontawesome-webfont.svg</li>
<li>fontawesome-webfont.ttf</li>
<li>fontawesome-webfont.woff</li>
</ul>

<p>...where they belong and they are readable by the world (755 permissions).
What am I missing?  Do I have to do something with compatibility view in IE8?</p>

<p>The same computer views the fonts on the Font Awesome site just fine so it has to be something I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>As requested, a copy of font-awesome.css is here: <a href=""http://reljac.com/so_1/font-awesome.css"">font-awesome.css</a>.  It is more or less what I downloaded from them with the exception of the path to the font files.</p>

<p>Based on @Abody97 I added <a href=""https://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"">https://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js</a> into the mix (Code above has been updated).  Still no luck, even after a refresh and a delete cache refresh.</p>

<p>A lot of the tutorials on the net talk about evicting the cache using a @cacheEvict method however this does not suit me. I think I am better suited off using the timeToLiveSeconds option to evict the cache.</p>

<p>When i look in the logs the cache is definitely working however the eviction of the cache is not. I've read some other articles on the net about how timeToLiveSeconds doesn't truly evict the cache but other articles like this one <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/ehcache-spring-annotations/wiki/EvictExpiredElements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/ehcache-spring-annotations/wiki/EvictExpiredElements</a> which say there are special settings you have to create to get the cache to evict.</p>

<p>Can someone please help me understand if my cache should be evicting and also how I can evict because what is mentioned in the article is not something i was able to understand how to implement.</p>

<p>Here are what my logs look like. But there are no signs of eviction...</p>

            &lt;ns:LinkItem id=""LI1"" href=""http://www.ibt.pt/"" target=""_blank""&gt;IBT&lt;/ns:LinkItem&gt;

<p>Now, in javascript I am trying:</p>

<pre><code>    var elements = document.getElementsByTagName('ns:LinkItem');
    element = elements[0];
    console.log(element.getAttribute('id'));
    //I get a correct value in all browsers
</code></pre>

<p>trying to get all the ChildNodes in my elements[0]. It works fine in all browsers, except -IE lt 9-</p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<pre><code>var children = element.getElementsByTagName('ns:LinkItem');
console.log(children.length);
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>var children = Array();
for (i=0; i&lt;element.childNodes.length; i++){
   alert(element.childNodes[i].nodeName);
   if (element.childNodes[i].nodeName==""NS:LINKITEM""){
      children.push(element.childNodes[i]);
   }
}
console.log(children.length);
</code></pre>

<p>in both console.logs, i get the correct length(4) in every browser except IE8 or less, i get 0.</p>

<p>According to @Shadow Wizard In IE8 and below, the canHaveChildren property of the element is false which means dead end - the browser simply doesn't support having child nodes for this tag, same way that <br /> can't have child nodes for example. I have tried it and it is true. If I try:  </p>

<pre><code>element.parentNode  
</code></pre>

<p>in IE 8 or less, I get the div that contains my markup and in the other browsers I get my parent </p>

<p>I have a large query utilising FOR XML PATH to output a .xml file.I have the main select which basically just represents the root ie</p>

<pre><code>select *
from tbl
for xml path ('root'),elements xsinil
</code></pre>

<p>I then have subsequent nested selects within this main select i.e.</p>

<pre><code>select 
    (
        select null [level1],
               '2'  [level2]
        from tbl

    (
        select null [level1],
               '2'  [level2]
        from tbl
        for xml path('nested2'),type
    )
for xml path('root'),elements xsinil
</code></pre>

<p>However, the element xsinil argument placed on the for xml path does not have any affect on the contained subqueries i.e. the Level1 element is just a closed tag. I need this to display as xsi:nil=""true"".</p>

<p>I can achieve this through adding elements xsinil argument to the for xml path statement e.g.</p>

<pre><code>for xml path('nested1'),type,elements xsinil
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that the namespace declaration gets repeated at the subquery level.</p>

<p>I can find plenty of examples of using elements xsinil but none where it is to apply to a subquery without a repeated namesapce declaration. </p>

<p>To confirm, I am looking for the following output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;root xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""&gt;
  &lt;nested1&gt;
    &lt;level1 xsi:nil=""true""&gt;
    &lt;level2&gt;2&lt;/level2&gt;
  &lt;/nested1&gt;
  &lt;nested2&gt;
    &lt;level1 xsi:nil=""true""&gt;
    &lt;level2&gt;2&lt;/level2&gt;
  &lt;/nested2&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;

<p>I've made an attempt at using the NVL functionality, but I think I'm missing the point of this function entirely - The query below returns no rows whatsoever, so there is no 'null value' which is why the NVL function won't work in my case - I've tried COALESCE but I can't get my head around the embedded SELECT and calling a dummy 'DUAL' table.</p>

<p>Is there a method I can employ to provide a value in case of 'no rows returned'?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
TO_CHAR(AR_WD_EVENTS.EVENT_ID)
FROM
AR_WD_EVENTS, AR_PI_SITE_BLOCKS
WHERE AR_WD_EVENTS.EVENT_BLOCK_ID = {!AR_PI_SITE_BLOCKS.SITE_ID}
AND TO_CHAR(AR_WD_EVENTS.EVENT_CONTRACT_ID) = 1555
</code></pre>

<p>This is the QB syntax - '6. Shutters - Event' is the name of the SQL query above, basically I want the SQL statement to return a corresponding 'Event ID', if it doesn't find an 'Event ID' then give a value of NULL/Zero/NA, so that I can use it in the QBF statement below - as it stands the SQL query works fine but only when there's a value to return.</p>

<pre><code>$QBFvalue = 'Y';

if ({%6. Shutters - Event} = 'N/A') $QBFvalue = 'N';

return $QBFvalue;

<p>Why I am getting errors? If I pass arguments by value (omit reference (&amp;) symbol from friend operator function) then program compiles fine. What I am understanding wrong here? Why <code>c=a+b;</code> works but <code>c=a+b+c;</code> is an error in my program?</p>

I can use /mingw/bin/nm to extract the symbols from your C libraries. This
is a time consuming task which may generate huge output on the disk (up

alternative is to skip the 'nm' extraction part and to compile a small
test program instead to determine whether each symbol is present. If
you have a fast C compiler and/or if your 'nm' output cannot be parsed,
this may be the best solution.

You probably shouldn't let me use 'nm' if you are using the GNU C Library.

I'm using just the xsltproc, so only XSLT 1.0 and EXSLT are my tools.</p>

<p>I use one input xml file to get the further xml files which I have to also process.
This causes that I do not know the prefixes and the namespace in the xsl I'm applying.</p>

<p>Futher I have to use ""xPathes"" (which are stored as attributes) out of my input xml file.
So I have to use EXSLT to evaluate (dyn:evaluate function) xpathes on documents which are loaded to variables: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:variable name=""importedDocument"" select=""document('importDoc.xml')"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>form the importDoc:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
  &lt;bm:root xmlns:bm=""http://my.bookmarks/ns/1.0"" &gt;
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>So after that I want to use a xpath ... something like that in my xslt:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""   version=""1.0""
    xmlns:rs=""http://ns.zf.com/xmlmerger/ruleset"" 
    xmlns:dyn=""http://exslt.org/dynamic""
    xmlns:exsl=""http://exslt.org/common""
    extension-element-prefixes=""dyn rs exsl"" &gt;

   ....

     &lt;xsl:variable name=""xpath"" select=""bm:root/bm:bookmarks[4]/@xpath"" /&gt;
     &lt;xsl:for-each select=""exsl:node-set($importedDocument)""&gt;
        &lt;xsl:if test=""dyn:evaluate($xpath)"" &gt;
          &lt;xsl:value-of select=""generate-id(dyn:evaluate($xpath))"" /&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But finally I got this message from </p>

<pre><code>xmlXPathEval: evaluation failed
dyn:evaluate() : unable to evaluate expression 'bm:root/bm:bookmarks[4]/@xpath'
</code></pre>

<p>So I need something like ""autoregister namespaces"" ???
Or is it possible to use catalog files to fix that ???
Or maybe I can use some kinds of imports or includes ???</p>

<blockquote>

  must not be an image mask and may not have an image mask or masking
  color associated with it. mask     A mask. If the mask is an image, it
  must be in the DeviceGray color space, must not have an alpha

<p>and I have image with specified colors:</p>

<p>So based on these colors I want to extract a part of image from the source image and it also will be great if I can detect center coordinates of extracted images in the source image. Right not problem is that using DeviceGray colors I need to have one source image and five mask images, but instead of it I want to specify color which I want to extract and have only 2 images - source and ""mask"" image.</p>

<p>Basically I want to use a code first approach and create a database from a designer. If I'm going to create a new project to handle the entity framework, what type of project should it be? a C# class library, WPF.. something else?</p>

<p><code>DefaultModel.RegisterContext( typeof( MyCompany.MyProject.DataModel.DataContext ), new ContextConfiguration() { ScaffoldAllTables = false } );</code></p>

<p>The MSDN docs (and the comments in the global.asax file) say that I should now be able to selectively enable scaffolding of individual tables by adding the <code>[ScaffoldTable(true)]</code> attribute to their partial ""buddy"" class. I've done so like this:</p>

<p>I've gotten this to work in similar scenarios before; the one thing that is different about this attempt is that my EF model is its own assembly. If I change the global.asax to go ahead and scaffold all tables, it works fine. But obviously, I don't want that. I was careful to make sure that the namespace for the partial metadata class matches the namespace of the EF data context.</p>

I currently uploaded my new php mvc website to 123-reg.co.uk and im using apache mod_rewrite with a router class. It works perfectly when im on my localhost but when its live, the mod_rewrite is ignored and the controller is not recognised e.g if i type <a href=""http://www.examplewebsite.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.examplewebsite.co.uk</a> the home controller loads like it should but if i try to load a different controller e.g <a href=""http://www.examplewebsite.co.uk/images"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.examplewebsite.co.uk/images</a> it takes me too a server error 404 page. I have been trying to fix this for several days now with no success, i have done some research and 123-reg.co.uk does support mod_rewrite, i feel like im loosing it haha, any help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>This is the router class:</p>

<pre><code>class Router {

public function __construct()
{
    if(empty($_GET['url']))
    {
        Help::loadApplication('controllers','home');
        return new Home();
    }
    elseif(isset($_GET['url']))
    {
        $url = $_GET['url'];
        $url = rtrim($url,'/');
        $url = filter_var($url,FILTER_SANITIZE_URL,true);
        $url = explode('/',$url);

        Help::loadApplication('controllers',$url[0]);
        if(class_exists($url[0]))
        {
            $controller = new $url[0];

            if(isset($url[1]))
            {
                $methodName = $url[1];

                if(method_exists($controller, $methodName))
                {
                    $methodParams = (isset($url[2]) ? $url[2] : false);
                    $controller-&gt;{$methodName}($methodParams);
                }
            }
        }
        else
        {
            Help::loadApplication('controllers','home');
            return new Home();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the mod_rewrite:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On

RewriteBase /http://www.examplewebsite.co.uk

Options -Indexes

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/?url=$1 [QSA,L]
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE !!</p>

<p>Anyone else that has this same issue,  the reason it wasn't working is because 123-reg.co.uk don't support mod_rewrite on their Windows package but do on there Linux package, it would have been good for them to state that when I signed up for the Windows package but making the switch over to the Linux package now. Thanks for the help guys! </p>

<p>To be more clear, as I mentioned in a comment below, this is what I'm looking to do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm not trying to get a specific users ""subscriptions"", but instead
  I'm trying to                    combine multiple channels recent
  uploads (videos) into one list. This way I can display my     ""teams""
  videos in chronological order on my website in the order that they are
  uploaded.</p>

And the minimum memory allocation?</p>

<p>I assembled (using MASM (ml.exe) and link.exe that come with VS 10) the following code:
<em>I can not leave out kernel32.lib and ExitProcess, if I do, the program crashes.</em> </p>

<pre><code>; Assmebly options
.386
.MODEL FLAT, STDCALL
option casemap:none

; Include Libs
includelib kernel32.lib

; Imported symbols
ExitProcess PROTO :Dword
Sleep PROTO :Dword

; Code
.CODE

start:
    invoke Sleep, 10000
    invoke ExitProcess, 0
END start
</code></pre>

<p>The Sleep command is included only to be able to read the memory usage before the program ends.</p>

<p>Now I measure the following: The .exe file is exactly 2.5 KB in size (if I include user32.lib and MessageBoxA, it becomes 3 KB in size --> blocks?) and the application uses 136 KB RAM when it's run (Vista 32bit).</p>

<p>Isn't that somewhat much memory for such a simple program? Why is the exe file so large, and the RAM requirement much larger than the exe file?</p>

<p>Are there some minimal memory sizes? What about the file? It looks like it's organized in blocks of 0.5 KB in size, but isn't it 0.5 KB then for this shortest possible program?</p>

<p>Where can I read about this (except <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx</a> which I will check out)?</p>

<p>How can I typedef them?</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code> typedef std::map&lt;MyKeyClass, typename MyList::iterator&gt; MyMap;
 //                                    ^ MyList not defined.
 typedef std::list&lt;typename MyMap::iterator&gt; MyList;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course inverting the two lines doesn't work.</p>

<p>I also tried</p>

<pre><code> typedef std::map&lt;MyKeyClass,
                  typename std::list&lt;typename MyMap::iterator&gt;::iterator&gt; MyMap;
 typedef std::list&lt;typename MyMap::iterator&gt; MyList;
</code></pre>

<p>but that did not work either.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
The reason I need this is to keep track key/value pairs by 2 aspect of  orders. Let's say that I have a <code>map&lt;KEY,VALUE&gt;</code>. It is sorted by KEY and find a value by a key is fast. But I also want to keep track the values by the time when the value is added. I want to know which value is least recently added. To do this I use list. The reason I need an iterator back to the list from the map is to erase an element in the containers. When I erase an element in the map by a key, I also need to erase an element in the list. I also need the opposite (erasing the least recently value).
I found that my idea that to use pointers explicitly (as in the comments) does not work because I need actually an iterator to erase an element in the containers.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong>
I'm asking this because I felt a little weird that I can not do this. I often use STL container as a basic data structure (as everyone does). For example, <code>std::map</code> can be used as alternative to implementation of binary tree with explicit struct and pointers. STL containers are well designed and I have not experienced that I can not use STL container to express some structure that can be done by struct and pointers. They may not guarantee that STL container has same property as struct and pointer structure have. But still, with such simple structure I felt a little strange I can not express it with STL containers.</p>

<p>This doesn't work because it returns ID=30, Code = WHEAT  where Date 12/25/2001 which is not the max(date) for that ID.<br></p>

<pre><code>    select ID, code, max(enroll_date)
    from enrollment
    where  CODE = 'WHEAT'
    group by ID, code
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work either because it too returns ID=30, Code = WHEAT, where date = 12/25/2001. </p>

<pre><code>    select ID, code, max(enroll_date)
    from enrollment
    group by ID, code
    having code='WHEAT'
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my TABLE</p>

<pre><code>ENROLLMENT

<p>First time PowerShell user, but I was successful in creating a short script to do the job, as follows…</p>

<pre><code>$word=new-object -comobject word.application
$doc=$word.documents.Open(""c:\TEST.docx"")
$doc.SaveAs([ref]""c:\test.pdf"", [ref]17)
$doc.Close()
$word.Quit()
</code></pre>

<p>Which once saved as a ps1 file works well when run with the use of following command…</p>

<pre><code>powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -file c:\SaveToPDF.ps1
</code></pre>

<p>However I have subsequently been asked too allow this script to be run on a remote computer. So I have started investigating this feature and have been able to create another power shell script that will run a command line job on a remote computer, as follows, that will run the help command</p>

<pre><code>$Username = ""Username""
$Password = ""PWD123""
$ComputerName = ""PC-RemoteApps""

$Script = {help}

$SecurePassWord = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $Password -Force
$Cred = New-Object -TypeName ""System.Management.Automation.PSCredential"" -ArgumentList $Username, $SecurePassWord

$Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName $ComputerName -credential $Cred

$Job = Invoke-Command -Session $Session -Scriptblock $Script

echo $Job

Remove-PSSession -Session $Session
</code></pre>

<p>Which also works and the results of the help command are echoed back to the local PC. So the next step is to simply change the $Script variable to include the command I wish to run to action the conversion of the Word document to PDF, as follows…</p>

<pre><code>$Script = {powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -file c:\SaveToPDF.ps1}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this generates an error (See Below) that does not make much sense seeing how the script works when run on the remote PC just fine…</p>

<p><i>You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I have even tried to include the power shell script command directly into the remote processing script, as follows…</p>

<pre><code>$Script = {

$word=new-object -comobject word.application
$doc=$word.documents.Open(""c:\TEST.docx"")
$doc.SaveAs([ref]""c:\test.pdf"", [ref]17)
$doc.Close()
$word.Quit()
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Where I is still get an error that basically tells me the same thing, as follows…</p>

<p><i>You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.</p>

<ul>
<li>CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (SaveAs:String) [], RuntimeException</li>

<li>CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (Close:String) [], RuntimeException</li>
<li>FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvokeMethodOnNull
</i></li>
</ul>

<p>It looks to me as though the $doc variable is not set to anything and therefore the SaveAs() and Close() methods cannot be called. Yet the source file (""c:\TEST.docx"") exists in this location on the remote PC and the commands do run OK when run on the remote PC.</p>

<p>I have even moved the test files to network locations that both the Local and Remote PC have read write access too and I still get the same set of errors.</p>

<p>So at this point I have come to you guys to see if you can let me know what I am missing.</p>

<p>Hope you can help</p>

<p>Things I know, or know that aren't causing the issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>The query isn't slow. When I look at the same query, from the same query run, profiled in PHP and profiled using SET PROFILING the query is always fast and never logged in the slow query log even when it shows taking .2 seconds from the PHP side.</li>
<li>This is not skip-name-resolve related - this is inconsistent and I have skip-name-resolve already on</li>
<li>This is not query cache related, the behavior exists in both</li>
<li>This behavior happens even on queries coming out of the cache.</li>
<li>The query doesn't actually select the ID, but I use this query for testing to show that it isn't a disk access issue since that field is definitely indexed.</li>
<li>This tables is only 10-20 megs with something like a 1 meg index. The machine shows very little load and innodb is not using all of its buffers.</li>
<li>This is tested against a table that has no other activity against it other than my test queries.</li>

<p>Problem One: I can't open an activity if the phone is locked.
Problem Two: I can start only one activity if the phone is unlocked but can't call methods of the phone. The only way I started the camera was starting the MainActivity on the Oncreate() method using the wearListener service.</p>

What I get is not an exception, but my log continues to generate messages that, in my opinion, underline a problem in the db generation\connection. I declared an hsql database that I can access by the hsql swing manager, but the db file is not visible in the file explorer. Instead of test.db I get the following files:</p>

<li>How to write to the created <code>.XML</code> file.</li>
<li>How to read from the found <code>.XML</code> file.
The reason for this is that I'm trying to create a save/load class for a game.</li>

<p>Just a general snippet of code, that I'd be able to modify for my needs would be great even for a learning experience.</p>

<p><strong>Here's an example polygon:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/8804/poly.png"" alt=""example""></p>

<p><strong>Formal description</strong></p>

<p>We have a list of points in CW order defining the polygon. We also can query whether a point is a cutting point with <code>is_cut(p)</code>, where <code>p</code> is a given point. Now we want to compute new polygons caused by this ""cut"".</p>

<p><strong>The algorithm should do this:</strong></p>

<p>Input: <code>{a, c1, b, c4, c, c5, d, c6, e, c3, f, c2}</code></p>

<p>Output: <code>{a, c1, c2}</code>, <code>{b, c4, c3, f, c2, c1}</code>, <code>{d, c6, c5}</code>, <code>{e, c3, c4,  c, c5, c6}</code></p>

<p><strong>Here my current algorithm:</strong></p>

<pre><code>follow your points, CW
if the point is a cut point
-&gt; go back trough the list looking for cut points
--- if next cut point is connected to the current cut point 
    and not part of the current poly, follow it
--- else keep searching
else
-&gt; continue until you hit your starting point.
that's a poly
do this for every non-cut-point

<p>I created a custom WP plug-in that takes a folder name and outputs all videos inside the folder as images, which when clicked make a video pop-up. The video has custom controls (only play/pause and mute) and I'm using fancybox to make the video pop-up.</p>

<p>Everything works reliably in Opera and Firefox. The video doesn't bother playing in IE9 and, what's most annoying, it <strong>sometimes</strong> plays in Chrome and sometimes doesn't. (btw Safari won't even pop-up, no idea why).</p>

<p>The plug-in is quite a piece of code, but the end result is a bunch of links with an image inside and a hidden div that contains the links relevant to the current video. Then there's the video container, which is the code for the pop-up. Upon clicking one of the links, the src of the video is swapped for the one that is in the hidden content of the link.</p>

<p>It's quite hard to explain, so please have a look at the code on the website:
<a href=""http://londoncreativedigital.com/downloads/creativeshowcase/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://londoncreativedigital.com/downloads/creativeshowcase/</a></p>

For a second I thought that adding a webm video would help, but it doesn't. It behaves the same way, even after adding a webm and removing the mp4 version. (tried on localhost, the online version doesn't have the webm vids).</p>

<p>Now I take a second photo of a purple block inside of different lighting conditions the RGB turns out to be (79, 40, 145) and an HSV of (262,72,56). Now since the fact that their values are different (different lighting conditions) in their HSV it is apparent that their RGB values cannot be accurately compared to test.</p>

<p>So therefore I need to use the HSV. So in order to scale ""up"" my HSV I need to multiply the purple value by 100/56 to bring it up to 100. Therefore the resulting color is HSV (262, 72, 100). Now. This is great and dandy - but is there a way in Objective-C to read the HSV back into RGB or convert the HSV into RGB? I cannot seem to find any good resources on the matter.</p>

<p>I am not sure what to read my color with but here is example code of what I am trying to accomplish:</p>

<pre><code>CIColor *myColor = [CIColor colorWithRed:rn green:gn blue:bn alpha:1];
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>rn</code>,<code>gn</code>, and <code>bn</code> are the RGB of my purple.</p>

<p>Now what I want to do is get the HSV from that CIColor object.</p>

<pre><code>hn = myColor.hue;
sn = myColor.saturation;
vn = myColor.value;
</code></pre>

<p>Next I want to take that HSV and scale it up to the white like such</p>

<pre><code>CIColor *myNewColor = [CIColor colorWithHue:hn, saturation:sn, value:vn*(vw/vn)];
</code></pre>

<p>and change it back to RGB.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is confusing - perhaps there is a better way to go about this.</p>

<p>In the above code,I have to save some items into a table(TranConsolidated).Depending on the number of records in other tables,I count the rows in the tables and then run the loop for that many times.
Note that in the destination table(TranConsolidated)I have to create the primary which is not AutoNumber and I obtain each new key by obtaining the max number of last record in the table and then adding 1 to it.</p>

<p>However,I get a ""Insert Into""syntax error.Note that I have repeatedly checked the table for any system keywords and found none.Also,there is another place from which I save to the same table without any problems.
Even here I had earlier been able to save successfully but encountered problems when I set up the code to insert the new primary key at each iteration.</p>

The first contains 993 float values. I have added every 12 instances of these 993 float values together and stored them in another ArrayList (993/12), giving the second ArrayList a size of 83.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet of the second ArrayList:</p>

<p><code>919.2, 927.9, 809.39996, 633.8, 626.8, 871.30005, 774.30005, 898.8, 789.6, 936.3, 765.4, 882.1, 681.1, 661.3, 847.9, 683.9, 985.7, 771.1, 736.6, 713.2001, 774.49994, ...</code></p>

<p>The first of these values i.e <code>919.2</code> corresponds to the year 1930.</p>

<p>The second, <code>927.9</code> corresponds to the year 1931.</p>

<p>The third, <code>809.39996</code> corresponds to the year 1932 and so on... meaning the last 83rd value will correspond to 2012.</p>

<p>The ultimate aim I have is to look at these values in this second ArrayList and find the largest, printing its value AND the year that corresponds with it.
The issue is the program currently has no way of knowing these corresponding year values. </p>

<p>Allowed assumption: the first corresponding year value is 1930.</p>

<p>Currently I am able to successfully print the largest value in the ArrayList which is half the problem.
To achieve this is simply sorted the ArrayList:
<code>System.out.println(depthAdd.get(depthAdd.size() -1));</code></p>

<p>What im lacking is the corresponding year. How can I do this???</p>

<p>Here is some code for you:</p>

<pre><code>  public void depthValues() {
    ArrayList&lt;Float&gt; rValue = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    ...
    ArrayList&lt;Float&gt; depthAdd = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    Iterator&lt;Float&gt; it = rValue.iterator();
    final int MAX = 12;

    while(it.hasNext()) {
        float sum = 0f;
        int counter = 1;
        while (counter &lt;= MAX &amp;&amp; it.hasNext()) {
          sum += it.next();
          counter++;
        }
        depthAdd.add(sum);
    }


    Collections.sort(depthAdd);
    System.out.println(""Wettest year: //year needs to go here ""
    + depthAdd.get(depthAdd.size() -1));




    return;

The circles are - together with underlying rectangles encapsulated in a SVG group elements (). Those groups are positioned with the <em>transform=""translate(x,y)""</em> attributes.
My problem is, that the coordinates of the elements inside the group are positioned relatively to the origins (0,0 coordinates) of their groups. To place a overlying line I need to know the absolute coordinates.</p>

<p>Here is the code using the D3 javascript library :</p>

<pre><code>var body = d3.select(""body"");

var svg = body.append(""svg"");

var group1 = svg.append(""g"")
    .attr(""transform"", ""translate(50,50)"");

var rect1 = group1.append(""svg:rect"")
    .attr(""x"", 0)
    .attr(""y"", 0)
    .attr(""width"", 100)
    .attr(""height"", 100)
    .style(""fill"", 'lightblue');

var circ1 = group1.append(""svg:circle"")
    .attr(""cx"", 50)
    .attr(""cy"", 50)
    .attr(""r"", 10)
    .style(""fill"", 'red')

var group2 = svg.append(""g"")
    .attr(""transform"", ""translate(350,50)"");

var rect2 = group2.append(""svg:rect"")
    .attr(""x"", 0)
    .attr(""y"", 0)
    .attr(""width"", 100)
    .attr(""height"", 100)
    .style(""fill"", 'lightgreen');

var circ2 = group2.append(""svg:circle"")
    .attr(""cx"", 50)
    .attr(""cy"", 50)
    .attr(""r"", 10)
    .style(""fill"", 'red');

var line = svg.append(""svg:line"")
    .attr(""x1"", parseInt(circ1.attr(""cx"")))
    .attr(""y1"", parseInt(circ1.attr(""cy"")))
    .attr(""x2"", parseInt(circ2.attr(""cx"")))
    .attr(""y2"", parseInt(circ2.attr(""cy"")))
    .attr(""stroke"", ""black"");
</code></pre>

<p>I do know why the line does not appear. I also know that every SVG element is related to a transformation-matrix. I am not sure how to access the matrices of the circle-elements and how to get the absolute coordinates of them (the cx/cy attributes). Another possibility would be to get the absolute distance of the circles.</p>

<p>He wants to be able to put youtube video's and html forms in the readme. I'm currently using the <a href=""https://github.com/brandly/angular-youtube-embed"" rel=""nofollow"">Youtube-embed directive</a> made by <a href=""https://github.com/brandly"" rel=""nofollow"">Brandly</a> but unfortunately it does not render in our page. </p>

<p>I am using a script which uses <code>ng-bind-html</code> in combination with <code>$sce.trustAsHtml</code> in order to parse html in the page. Normal HTML is picked up just fine (form tags and other stuff) but angular stuff (youtube directive as example) aren't.</p>

<p>I also noticed that angular directives such as <code>ng-click</code>, <code>ng-submit</code> etc aren't working.
Does anyone know how to make angular work in html which is bieing parsed within the angular application using <code>ng-bind-html</code>?</p>

<p>Here is a code example on how the html is bieing parsed to the template:</p>

<p>JS:</p>

<pre><code>case 'markdown':
    $scope.fileContent = $sce.trustAsHtml(remarkable.render(content));
break;
</code></pre>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre class=""fileContent""&gt;&lt;code ng-bind-html=""fileContent""&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>i've added a <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/mC30KRTzyutW1rPYuvxe?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"">Plunker example</a> with the problem I am having, as you can see it never executes the <code>ng-submit</code> that I  added in the form.</p>

<p>What could be the problem? The database is created just fine. Is there any other code you'd need to see?  </p>

I am VERY sure this column exists. I queried the database with this:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor c = db.rawQuery(""SELECT * FROM tasks LIMIT 1"", null);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; c.getColumnNames().length; i++) {
    Log.v(TAG, c.getColumnNames()[i]);

My suggestion is, that this white line is part of the background of the embed part and adobes pdf plugin doesnt covers the whole embed area.

<p>I only want the second to work (for SEO). Also, when I create a link to that page, the routing engine gives me back a URL without a trailing slash.</p>

<p>This is the code I'm using to generate the link:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Html.ActionLink(""Firefox Extension"", ""Firefox"", ""Home"")%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I believe can fix the first problem by using an HTTP handler to do a 301 redirect to the URL with the trailing slash. However, I want to link to the URL with the trailing slash, and I'm hoping to not have to hard-code the version with the slash.</p>

<p>Anyone know how to force the route to use a trailing slash?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$names = file('demo.csv');
$page = $_GET['page'];
$pagedResults = new Paginated($names, 20, $page);
echo ""&lt;table border='2' bgcolor='#fbd998' style='float:center; margin:20'&gt;"";

//important to set the strategy to be used before a call to fetchPagedNavigation
$pagedResults-&gt;setLayout(new DoubleBarLayout());
echo $pagedResults-&gt;fetchPagedNavigation();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem was, I was not able to display the CSV header information except the first page. To avoid this, I used the handler to extract the first line alone from CSV file (which contains the header information). I added the below piece of code before the while loop. </p>

<pre><code>if (($data = fgetcsv($handle, 1000, ',')) !== FALSE)
{
}
echo ""&lt;table border='2' bgcolor='#fbd998' style='float:center; margin:20'&gt;"";
echo '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;'.implode('&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;', $data).'&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>This strategy seems to be working fine in all the pages except that in the first page, I have the CSV header twice. For example, my current first page looks like below.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Column1 Column2 Column3 </li>
<li><p>Column1 Column2 Column3 </p>

<hr></li>
<li><p>Rest of my data </p>

<hr></li>
</ul>

<p>Can someone please guide me on how to resolve this problem?</p>

<p>for example</p>

<pre><code>double d = 123.0   -&gt;   toString() will be ""123""

<p>I've found a little bit of a solution in using the custom format <code>.toString(""#.0"")</code> but if I want to add any more decimal places I'm back to where I started</p>

<pre><code>double d = 123.00   -&gt;  toString(""#.0"") will be 123.0
double d = 123.0    -&gt; toString(""#.00"") will be 123.00

<p>The reason I'm trying to do this is because I've got custom text boxes that must use a different value to the one thats actually displayed and when trying to enter your own value into this text box the textbox is ignoring your text when you try to enter zero in decimal places. Therefore I need the <code>toString</code> value to equal the exact value of the <code>double</code> so this number can be entered properly.</p>

<pre><code>// 1. Binds via public, no-arg ""ServiceImpl()"" ctor?
bind(Service.class).to(ServiceImpl.class);

// 2. Every client-side request for a Service instance returns the same
//    ServiceImpl instance?

bind(Service.class).toInstance(impl);

// 3. Every client-side request for a Service instance returns the same
//    SINGLETON ServiceImpl instance?
ServiceImpl impl = new ServiceImpl(...);
bind(Service.class).in(Scopes.SINGLETON).toInstance(impl);

// 4. Should this be a call too bindConstant() instead of toInstance()
//    instead? If so, how/why?
Integer timeout = 1000 * 60;   // 60 seconds
bind(Integer.class).named(Names.named(""TIMEOUT"")).toInstance(timeout);

<p>So my questions, as implied by the code snippet above:</p>

<ol>
<li>When using <code>to(...)</code>, I assume the public no-arg ctor is used, and a new instance is returned every time?</li>
<li>Per #2 above, is the same <code>impl</code> instance used for ever <code>Service.class</code> request, or is a new one returned?</li>
<li>Same as #3 above, but now with <code>Scopes.SINGLETON</code> specified.</li>
<li>Is the above code OK or should I be using <code>bindConstant()</code>? If so, how/why?</li>
<li>Under what circumstances should I be using so-called <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/InjectingProviders"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>provider methods</strong></a>? I <em>sort of</em> understand the example on that page, but am now choking when it comes to finding a real-world use case for them in my code.</li>

<p>You can mind all the MVVM loading, that is done sepratly. 
Anyway, using code behind, I basically add this to my button click:</p>

<pre><code>PrintDialog prnt = new PrintDialog();

prnt.PrintVisual(PrntFrm, ""Initiate Work Request"");
</code></pre>

<p>This prints out my form (stackpanel), but it is not exactly centered on the page. It sits at the top left, and some of the text is cut off on the left side.</p>

<p>Using the <code>PrintDialog</code> methods, how does one set the size of the page to be printed, or just center the contents of the printable form? And also, how can I set the page orientation from <code>PrintDialog</code>?
 Do I have to set the <code>PrintableAreaHeight/Width</code>, and how do I do so? </p>

-> Fire on the 1st day of every month at 14:00 hours.  </p>

<p>I used the Quartz CronScheduleBuilder to build the expession, but this is irrelevant.</p>

<p>My Local timezone is UTC+01:00 and the summertime (this year) begins on 31.03.2013 2:00, where the time is adjusted to 3:00.</p>

<p>When i schedule a new Job using the proposed trigger on lets say 20.02.2013, Quartz calculates the System.DateTimeOffset for the ""NextFireTimeUtc"" correctly to:<br>
DateTime: 01.03.2013 13:00:00 (this is the UTC time, which is one hour behind the local timezone)<br>
LocalDateTime: 01.03.2013 14:00:00</p>

<p>The job will correctly trigger on 14:00 hours as specified.</p>

<p>Now if i schedule the job on 20.03.2013, the ""NextFireTimeUtc"" results in:<br>
DateTime: 01.04.2013 13:00:00 (this is the UTC time, which is now two hours behind the local timezone)<br>
LocalDateTime: 01.04.2013 <strong>15:00:00</strong></p>

<p>Notice, that the resulting NextFireTimeUtc now falls within the local summertime. As a result, the LocalDateTime was also ""corrected"" by an additional hour from the UTC. This results in the job running at 15:00 hours, which is not what i want.</p>

<p>What i (obviously) expected is that the ""14"" in the cron expression should always result in the trigger firing at 14:00, even during summertime.</p>

<p>There must be an easy way to deal with this phenomenon, i am probably just missing something conceptional. I am confused.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
The problem seems to be, that Quartz calculates the <strong>first</strong> NextFireTimeUtc depending on the <strong>current</strong> timezone information. To test this, i scheduled two different cron triggers and called GetFireTimeAfter() on the trigger with an increasing offset to view the resulting fire times over the year.</p>

<p>Trigger 1: Fire on the 28th of every month at 14:00</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GetFireTimeAfter now + 00 months: 28.03.2013 <strong>13:00:00 +00:00</strong> &lt;- this is correct<br>
  GetFireTimeAfter now + 01 months: 28.04.2013 12:00:00 +00:00<br>

  GetFireTimeAfter now + 03 months: 28.06.2013 12:00:00 +00:00<br>

  GetFireTimeAfter now + 08 months: 28.11.2013 13:00:00 +00:00</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first fire time is correct, since it still falls into ""wintertime"". The times during ""summertime"" are off by an additional -1, resulting in the correct fire time after the local timezone adds +2.</p>

<p>Trigger 1: Fire on the first day of every month at 14:00</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The first fire already falls within summertime, but its only offset by -1, resulting in a local trigger time of 15:00. </p>

<p>So the trigger is fine, except for the first trigger time, if its scheduled during wintertime and the first execution falls within summertime. How to handle this?</p>

<p>It works perfectly.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can get the second result using the simple = operator to reinstantiate instead of pointing to, thus imitating better the behavior of Int64 or something?
I mean, the point here is I may end up wanting to distribute this code for other people to work with and they would probably end up having that 'point to instead of being a new value' problem when using IntEx class -_-</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

One can run the application by passing arguments when calling the application , which I parse using getopt() .</p>

<p>One can choose to run this application in interactive mode, in which case a small menu is presented and the user should be able to enter similar options as the ones they add when running the application. </p>

<p>To avoid creating a different parser when I am in interactive mode, I wanted to parse the keyboard input to argc &amp; argv and feed that in the same getopt() function.</p>

<p>The proof of concept <code>c</code> function I created is the following:</p>

<pre><code>void menuDlg()
{
    char kbinput[256];
    wordexp_t we;
    char **argAr;
    int argCount = 0 ,i,er=0;

    printf(""showing menu options\n"");
    //...
    //...

    ///grab keyboard input
    fgets(kbinput,256,stdin);

    ///the ""\n"" in kbinput breaks we 
    ///and we.we_wordc return weird value, 
    ///so we need to remove it
    for (i=0; i&lt;256; i++)
    {
        if (kbinput[i]=='\n')
        {
            kbinput[i]='\0';
            break;
        }
    }
    printf(""you typed |%s|\n"",kbinput);

    we.we_offs = 0;
    if ( (er=wordexp(kbinput, &amp;we, 0)) != 0)
    {
        printf(""error in word expansion %d\n"",er);
    }
    argAr = we.we_wordv;
    argCount = we.we_wordc;
    printf(""we.c=%u\n"",we.we_wordc);

    main_dialog( argCount, argAr );

    wordfree(&amp;we);
}

<p>were main_dialog() parses the cli options </p>

<pre><code>void main_dialog( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    while ( (ch = getopt_long(argc, argv, ""yscvh"", longopts, NULL)) != -1 )
    switch (ch)
    {
     ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But when I run this my application crashes inside the call to <code>getopt_long()</code>.</p>

<p>I read that <code>argv</code> is supposed to have a final entry of <code>null</code>. so for parameters ""foo bar"" , we'd have argc=2 , but argv[0]=""foo"" , argv[1]=""bar"" and argv[2]='\0' . In <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/wordexp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">wordexp documentation</a> it states little about the internal structure of we_wordv (that is about a tailing NULL array entry) so I do not know  if this is the problem.</p>

<p>Could this be the source of the problem? Is there another <code>glib</code> function to do what I need?</p>

HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
System.out.println(connection.getResponseCode());
connection.disconnect();
</code></pre>

<p>But this just prints out response code <code>404</code> which doesn't make any sense because if I paste the link generated by <code>tracker.getLinkTrackURL</code> into my browser it works perfectly and logs correctly in Piwik (I have debug mode on).</p>

<p>So my question is, why is Piwik returning a bad request and why can't Java find the URL (404) when it works perfectly fine in my browser?</p>

<p>This is what I have done:
in the <strong>application.rb</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> config.time_zone = 'Melbourne'
 config.active_record.default_timezone = :local
</code></pre>

<p>However when user from different timezone create a record or update a record it saves as <code>Melbourne</code> timezone. I thought default timezone would be set to where user create the record.</p>

<p>Basically I need to be able to do this for the <code>created_at</code> and <code>updated_at</code>:</p>

<p><code>Time.zone.now</code></p>

<p>So I did the following in my initialiser folder: </p>

<p>I have added <strong>timestamp.rb</strong> with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>module ActiveRecord
  module Timestamp
    def self.included(base) #:nodoc:
      base.alias_method_chain :create, :timestamps
      base.alias_method_chain :update, :timestamps

      base.class_inheritable_accessor :record_timestamps, :instance_writer =&gt; false
      base.record_timestamps = true
    end

    private
    def create_with_timestamps #:nodoc:
      if record_timestamps
        t = Time.zone.now
        write_attribute('created_at', t) if respond_to?(:created_at) &amp;&amp; created_at.nil?
        write_attribute('created_on', t) if respond_to?(:created_on) &amp;&amp; created_on.nil?

        write_attribute('updated_at', t) if respond_to?(:updated_at) &amp;&amp; updated_at.nil?
        write_attribute('updated_on', t) if respond_to?(:updated_on) &amp;&amp; updated_on.nil?
      end
      create_without_timestamps
    end

    def update_with_timestamps(*args) #:nodoc:
        t = Time.zone.now
        write_attribute('updated_at', t) if respond_to?(:updated_at)
        write_attribute('updated_on', t) if respond_to?(:updated_on)
    end
  end
end 
</code></pre>

<p>I restarted the server however nothing has changed, still I get the wrong timezone recordings. If somehow I force Rails to use my Timestamp override this problem would be solved.</p>

<p>This is on my Local machine at about 10:15 AM</p>

<p>Here is an example of <code>created_at</code> after <code>create</code> is triggered:
 <code>created_at: ""2014-12-09 22:15:09""</code></p>

<p>Now when I run the <code>Time.zone.now</code> in the console I get 
<code>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 10:15:09 EST +11:00</code></p>

<p>FYI: (Not sure this is matter.)
Database is located on Amazon RDS which is in different timezone too and it is Postgresql.</p>

<p>I'm dealing with documents than can reference other documents. Starting from any document, I need to get the id of all the documents this document references. The problem is that the circular references are allowed so if A ref B ref C, again C can ref A and I get in the loop.
How can I solve this problem in C#?</p>

<p>An small example:</p>

<p>Let suppose that this is a class that represents a document:</p>

<pre><code>public class Document
{
    public Document(int id)
    {
        this.ID = id;
    }

    private int m_ID;

    public int ID
    {
        get { return m_ID; }
        set { m_ID = value; }
    }

    private List&lt;Document&gt; m_Children = new List&lt;Document&gt;();

    public List&lt;Document&gt; Children
    {
        get { return m_Children; }
        set { m_Children = value; }
    }

    private List&lt;Document&gt; m_Parent = new List&lt;Document&gt;();

    public List&lt;Document&gt; Parent
    {
        get { return m_Parent; }
        set { m_Parent = value; }
    }

    public Document AddChild(Document child)
    {
        child.Parent.Add(this);
        this.Children.Add(child);

        return child;
    }

    public Document AddChild(int child)
    {
        Document d = new Document(child);

        return AddChild(d);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's create a Document class that has some references:</p>

<pre><code>public static Document CreateReferences()
{
    Document d = new Document(1);

    Document temp = d.AddChild(2);

    for (int i = 3; i &lt; 6; i++)
    {
        temp = temp.AddChild(i);
    }

    temp.AddChild(d);

    return d;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I need to implement a method in Document class like</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;int&gt; GetReferencedDocuments()
{    }
</code></pre>

<p>What is the best way to do that? Any specific algorithm can be implemented?</p>

<p>Any suggestion is well accepted!</p>

I believe this is due to the <code>/</code> that is not removed during the escape encoding. For example the HTML break tag becomes <code>%3Cbr%20/%3E</code>. So the <code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code> and space are replaced, but not the <code>/</code>. </p>

<p>Should I be using a different method? Is there an easy way to send HTML over Query String? Am I correct that the <code>/</code> character is what is breaking my query string?</p>

<p>Here is the code I have now:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *datePE =[dateString stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSString *studentPE =[student stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSString *teacherPE =[teacher stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSString *transcriberPE =[transcriber stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSString *vrPE =[vrTextField.text stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSString *totalTimePE =[totalTimeString stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSString *transcriptPE =[transcriptString stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

parameters = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""dateQS=%@&amp;studentQS=%@&amp;teacherQS=%@&amp;transcriberQS=%@&amp;vrQS=%@&amp;totalTimeQS=%@&amp;transcriptQS=%@"",datePE ,studentPE,teacherPE,transcriberPE,vrPE,totalTimePE, transcriptPE];

Is there a straightforward way to get python to warn you when you attempt to override a built-in?</p>

<p>I'm thinking more specifically of Mathematica. In Mathematica all built-ins have attribute <code>Protected</code>. If you try to redefine <code>Set</code>, it will tell you that <code>Set</code> is <code>Protected</code> and leave it unchanged, possibly saving you from massive confusion later on when things that ought to work stop doing so for no obvious reason. If you really seriously want to redefine <code>Set</code> you can still do it -- you just have to <code>Unprotect</code> it first. And you can <code>Protect</code> your own symbols, too, to protect them from accidental redefinition. </p>

<p>Perhaps experienced pythoners don't need this, but it would be nice if there were something like this for newbies like me. (Come to think of it, I've been programming Mathematica for 15 years and <code>Protected</code> still occasionally saves my bacon.)</p>

<pre><code>1. LoginViewController  // this inherits from BaseViewController and holds common code for both ipad and iphone 
2. LoginViewController_iphone // custom logic for iphone only
3. LoginViewController_ipad // custom logic for ipad only
</code></pre>

<p>The cool part with that is I'm using controllers without suffixes around the code because they all extend from BaseViewController and it has overriden alloc method, which does smart logic and auto picks correct class upon calling VC alloc/init. </p>

<p>Now, as we all started slowly to transition to Swift, I managed to override and implement alloc method in Swift 1.2 as well. Here's the implementation:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseViewController: UIViewController {

  override class func alloc() -&gt; BaseViewController {

    var viewControllerClassName : String = NSStringFromClass(self)

    if ((viewControllerClassName.lowercaseString.rangeOfString(""ipad"") == nil) &amp;&amp; (viewControllerClassName.lowercaseString.rangeOfString(""iphone"") == nil)) {

        switch (UIDevice.currentDevice().userInterfaceIdiom) {

        case .Pad:

            viewControllerClassName += ""_ipad"";

        case .Phone:

            viewControllerClassName += ""_iphone"";

        default:

            viewControllerClassName += """";
        }

        let viewControllerClass : AnyClass = NSClassFromString(viewControllerClassName)

        return viewControllerClass.alloc() as! BaseViewController

    } else {

        return super.alloc() as! BaseViewController
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Today, I downloaded Xcode 7 beta 6 with Swift 2 and tried to compile the project but got annoying surprise message ""alloc() is unavailable in Swift: use object initializers instead"". Well, I don't mind the other devs prefer using a different approach, however having more flexibility is better than having less. Has anybody an idea how to override creation of class object and add the custom logic?</p>

<p>Here is the deal, I have defined a route:</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(""CategoryName"", ""Category/Name/{text}"",
    new { controller = ""Category"", action = ""Name"", text = """" });
</code></pre>

<p>The twist here is the following:</p>

<p>This url: <code>http://www.url.com/Category/Name/existingCategoryName</code></p>

<p>And <em>this</em> url: <code>http://www.url.com/Category/Name/anotherExistingCategoryName</code></p>

<p>Both url's <strong>should</strong> go to the same controller method which is <code>public ActionResult Name(string text)</code> but sadly the first url is going to the default <code>Index</code> method, the second is being routed correctly.</p>

<p>I wonder why this happens, as I've been with .net mvc for several years and never experienced this behavior.</p>

<p>As a side note here are some facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>As it's being route to different methods, I doubt the code inside them has something to do with it.</li>
<li>When manually write the category to something it doesn't exists in the DB as a category name it goes through the <code>Name</code> method.</li>
<li>The routes are placed correctly, as I'm aware the first route that matches the pattern will win.</li>
<li>Even I tried place the <code>CategoryName</code> route first, the behavior is the same.</li>
<li>When writing each link in the <code>Category/Index</code> I use the same <code>@Html.RouteLink()</code> helper, so all the links are formatted the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I have a page for users to compare up to three products, and at the same time, save their search to a table <code>(""saved_results"")</code> so that that I can have a section, for lets say, recent searches, or similar searches, etc....</p>

<p>What happens is, as the user compare multiple products, it takes the product ids they're comparing from the products table <code>(""products"")</code> and saves it to a new table <code>(""compared_products"")</code> in the db, in the field <code>compared_ids</code>, using a comma separated format (id1, id2, id3).</p>

<p><strong>how can I make a query to return fields in the ""saved_results"" where at least two of the comma separated fields are the same?</strong> </p>

<p>I'm assuming I can't use a LIKE statement, I dont <em>think</em> it would work because if I wanted to find a row where someone compared product 1 and 5, it would return any row with one of those numbers, including  lets say 10, 11, 15, 16...25, 50,51,52.... because 1 and/or 5 are in all those numbers!</p>

By ""session object"", I mean one that the client creates before using the service and deletes after using the service. I am trying to convince the team that we need such a session object in order to allow the client to control the allocation and deallocation of the service's internal resources. I'm looking for documented design patterns that help me make my case.</p>

<p>I know that many COM interfaces do not need such a session object. Any initialization of internal resources is done when the first object is created, regardless of what object that is, and those resources are released when the last object maintained by the server is deleted (ie, when its reference count goes to 0). Although this is perhaps simpler for the client, the problem is that the cost of the initialization must be paid at the time the first object is created. If the client is expecting that to be a lightweight operation, and most of the time it is, this initialization results in unpredictable and undesirable behavior.</p>

<p>By introducing a session object whose lifetime must wrap those of all other objects, the client can control when the initialization occurs and make sure that it occurs before the services managed by the session are used. (I realize that a robust design requires that my service handle multiple sessions and that the initialization price be paid on creation of the first session object and releasing of resources on deletion of the last session object.)</p>

<p>Is there a name for this pattern? Are there any documented examples that I can point others to in order to support my case? I realize that what I want to do is associated with RAII (Resource Allocation Is Initialization) but the motivation is a bit different.</p>

<p>I can parse out the year with <code>substring-before(substring-after(substring-after(substring-after(pubDate, ' '), ' '), ' '), ' ')</code>, and I have attempted to create a key with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:key name=""years"" match=""/root/pubDate"" use=""substring-before(substring-after(substring-after(substring-after(/root/pubDate, ' '), ' '), ' '), ' ')"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which I then used:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=""root""&gt;
&lt;rss&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates mode=""year"" select=""pubDate[
      generate-id()
      =
      generate-id(key('years', substring-before(substring-after(substring-after(substring-after(/root/pubDate, ' '), ' '), ' '), ' '))[1])
    ]""/&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match=""root/pubDate"" mode=""year""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:variable name=""year"" select=""substring-before(substring-after(substring-after(substring-after(., ' '), ' '), ' '), ' ')""/&gt;
    &lt;year handle=""{$year}""&gt;
         &lt;xsl:apply-templates mode=""final"" select=""key('years', $year)""/&gt;
    &lt;/year&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match=""root/pubDate"" mode=""final""&gt;
    &lt;date&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select=""."" /&gt;
    &lt;/date&gt; 
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=""./following-sibling::*[1]"" /&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But my output is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;year handle=""2013""&gt;
    &lt;date&gt;Tue, 03 Sep 2013 15:15:00 +0000&lt;/date&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title 1&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;date&gt;Tue, 02 Mar 2013 15:15:00 +0000&lt;/date&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title 2&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;date&gt;Tue, 02 Sep 2012 15:15:00 +0000&lt;/date&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title 3&lt;/title&gt;
    ...
&lt;/year&gt;

<p>I seem to be able to solve individual parts of this problem but I have not been able to get them all working together. There are many examples of grouping RSS by year and month, but that is just different enough from my problem (especially considering my flattened RSS) that I cannot emulate those examples. </p>

<p>If it helps to know, I am using XSLT / XPath 1.0 because I am using Symphony CMS, which relies on PHP's libxslt.</p>

<p>Any help is very welcome, thanks for reading.</p>

<p>When I nest an element with <code>display: -webkit-box</code> inside another element with <code>display: -webkit-box</code> it fails to contain its elements properly as a flexible box. See text behind delete buttons in below image.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/seVKV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>LI HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div class=""reference""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""number""&gt;1.&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""edit""&gt;
        &lt;button class=""delete""&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>LI CSS (aesthetics omitted):</p>

<pre><code>li {
    display: -webkit-box;
    -webkit-box-align: center; /* Vertically center elements within LI */
}
.reference {
    -webkit-box-flex: 1; /* Expand to fill space */
    display: -webkit-box;
}
.number {
    width: 3ex;
    padding: 0 5px 0 0;
}
.edit {
    /* I have tried setting a width and -webkit-box-flex: 0,
    but this does not solve the problem. */
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's crucial that .reference stays flexible as the viewport width changes.</p>

<p>The problem can be solved by removing .reference's <code>display: -webkit-box;</code>, but this means I can't use the flexible box model on elements within .reference and I need to, to keep item numbers (1., 2., etc) in their own column.</p>

<p>Any help is most appreciated. Kind regards.</p>

The site will have 500-1000 logged in users viewing a single page during the auction. Only one item will be on sale at any one time, similar to a real auction held in an auction house.</p>

<p>I will be broadcasting a countdown timer to all of the signed in users from the server to the client. On the server side I will be using setInterval() of 1 second to countdown to the auction end time. Apart from this the only other message being sent across will be the current bid being passed from a single client to the server then broadcast to all.
Will this be a reliable way to do this? And will it be able to handle the usage on the server?</p>

<p>If not is there a way which would be better?</p>

<p>When my app receives a notification, via the App Delegate's <code>- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary*)userInfo</code> method, and the app is currently already running, I update the data (stored via Core Data)</p>

<p>An alert view pops up, and once it is dismissed, I call</p>

<pre><code>[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@""updateConversations"" object:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>In the table view controller:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
    //some setup code removed
    _someData = [[GGGroups findAllSortedBy:@""lastUpdated"" ascending:NO withPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""ANY users = %@"", [GGUser currentUser]]] mutableCopy];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(updateData:) name:@""updateConversations"" object:nil];
}

- (void)updateData:(NSNotification *)notification {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        [self.tableView reloadData];
        NSLog(@""Updated those conversations"");
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried adding and removing the dispatch_async main queue blocks.</p>

<p>It always reaches the updateData method <em>(I can see the NSLog)</em>, the tableview itself never gets updated.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update</p>

<p>More code as requested.</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView
 numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section
{
    return [_someData count];

}
</code></pre>

<p>Also each table view cell is configured to an index of _someData.</p>

<p>The appDelegate updates the GGGroups core data structure, so the tableview should accordingly update, but this is not happening, for reasons unknown to me thus far.</p>

<pre><code>    jQuery(document).ready(function($){         
        $( '.slides' ).css(""width"", """");
        $( '.slides' ).css(""margin-left"", """");
        $( '.slides' ).css(""margin-right"", ""126px"");        
    });
</code></pre>

<p>I saved this code in a file named <code>final.js</code> inside the theme's js directory. But I haven't been able to make it work!
I read an article about enqueue-ing (if there's such a verb) the scripts, <a href=""http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. I tried and it seems like, the script will be included inside the header among the other scripts. But no matter if it's at the top or the bottom of the other ones, it won't work!</p>

<p>I tried to put it at the bottom of the page without using the enqueue method.
All I could get from my efforts is adding <code>margin-right</code> to the class <code>slides</code>. This is not enough. Which ever code is changing this class, is firing after my custom script and doesn't let it happen.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions to make this this thing work?
Here's the <a href=""http://ashrafii.com/product/cartier-6022/"" rel=""nofollow"">link to site</a> if you want to have a look (should look for: <code>&lt;div id=""carousel"" class=""flexslider""&gt;&lt;ul class=""slides""&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>When I used the OleDBDataAdapter and populated the DataTable using Fill on <code>FirstTable</code>, <code>Column1</code> and <code>Column2</code> were empty and there were two additional columns that were from the Excel sheet <code>(ExcelCol1, ExcelCol2)</code>. So unless, I gave the same excel columns names to <code>FirstTable</code> (instead of <code>Column1</code> and <code>Column2</code> if I called it <code>ExcelCol1</code> and <code>ExcelCol2</code>), it would not populate the DataColumns that I created via the designer.</p>

<p>Is there any way to tell the DataSet to ignore the columns coming from Excel and just populate the already defined DataColumns?</p>

<p>IF that is <em>not</em> possible can I somehow connect the Excel sheet via a DataConnection to create the layout of the DataTables? The only thing I'm not sure about is that the excel file is user defined, so the user browses to the excel file to populate the DataSets. BUT the columns for all these excel files will always be the same. Hence I want to preset the layout using a Typed DataSet.</p>

<p>My <strong>cursor.getCount()</strong> differs from my last <strong>cursor.getPosition()</strong>. Check my while loop! It is all I do with it!</p>

<p><em>Notes</em>: 
1. it is about querying the Contacts content provider (android api >5)
2. I display only the esential code</p>

<pre><code>Cursor cursor = mContext.getContentResolver().query(mUri, mProjections, null, null, null);
Logger.d(TAG, ""***  cursor.getCount(): ""+cursor.getCount());
while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
    Logger.d(TAG, ""| position: ""+cursor.getPosition());
    processMainCursor(serializer, cursor);
}
cursor.close();
</code></pre>

<p>processMainCursor() will display data from cursor + do another queries: one 4 phones, one 4 emails, one 4 IM accounts:</p>

<pre><code>void processMainCursor(XmlSerializer serializer, Cursor main_cursor) {
     writeCursorData(serializer, main_cursor); //writes cursor data, column by column
     writePhoneEntities(serializer, main_cursor);
     writeEmailEntities(serializer, main_cursor);
     writeIMEntities(serializer, main_cursor);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In none of my <code>writeXXX</code> methods do i close my <code>main_cursor</code> or move next!!!..have to trust me on that.. i just do a new query, print data &amp; close that cursor</p>

<p>So statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>cursor.getCount() = 695 (<strong>always</strong>)</li>
<li>commenting <em>writePhoneEntities, writeEmailEntities, writeIMEntities</em>: cursor.getCount() = 
last cursor.getPosition() = 695 (<strong>so correct!</strong>)</li>
<li>leaving one/two/all of my <em>writeXEntities</em> shows randomness; example: leaving them all: 
last cursor.getPosition() sometimes displays 254, 257, 253, etc; leaving just phone &amp; IM: 514, 510, 511, etc (<strong>so different RUN -> different last cursor.getPosition() VALUE</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>So oppinions.. Why is that? Is it memory related?</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: 
Leaving any of my writeXEntities displays at the end in logcat:
<em>Removing dead content provider: contacts</em></p>

<p><em>Update 2</em>
Adding  <code>cursor.moveToFirst();</code> &amp; doing loop like</p>

<pre><code>do {
    //do whatever you want
} while (cursor.moveToNext()); 
</code></pre>

<p>didn't do the job..</p>

<p>So maybe the answer is in this logcat entries: </p>

<pre><code>05-21 23:29:30.209: I/ActivityThread(7085): Removing dead content provider: contacts
05-21 23:29:30.209: I/ActivityThread(7085): Removing dead content provider: com.android.contacts
</code></pre>

<p><strong>SAMPLE OF a writeXEntity</strong> REMOVED </p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> .. i <strong>wasnt</strong> closing the cursors from writeXEntity corectly (probably leaving quite a lot of open cursor after main while)</p>

<p>in reality i was closing like this</p>

<pre><code>if(phone_cursor!=null &amp;&amp; phone_cursor.getCount() &gt; 0)
{                   
     //... stuff
     phone_cursor.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>i should have closed after if</p>

<pre><code>if(phone_cursor!=null &amp;&amp; phone_cursor.getCount() &gt; 0)
{                   
     //... stuff
}
phone_cursor.close();
</code></pre>

<p>I guess leaving a basilion cursor open ..was the answer?!?</p>

<p>Now, the thing is that I have got a main activity that handles two fragments.<br>
In one of the fragments, I have a search method that needs to use the Internet.<br>
So, what I am trying to do is: if there's no Internet, then the user will get a toast, after he/she pressed the search button.</p>

<p>In order to do this - I've written the following class in the main activity -</p>

<pre><code>public class ConnectionChangeReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {

       Boolean netBol;

    ConnectivityManager connectivityManager = (ConnectivityManager) context

    NetworkInfo activeNetInfo = connectivityManager
            .getNetworkInfo(ConnectivityManager.TYPE_MOBILE);

    boolean isConnected = activeNetInfo != null
        &amp;&amp; activeNetInfo.isConnectedOrConnecting();

    if (isConnected){

         Boolean netBol = true;

    }else{

        netBol = false;
    Toast.makeText(context, R.string.no_internet, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I'm trying to use the Boolean netBol, to determine if there's a connection or not.</p>

<p>But the point is that i want to pass it to the search fragment, and I don't know how to do that.</p>

<p>I've also added the following line to the manifest:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and I also put the following code in the main activity;</p>

<pre><code>   ConnectionChangeReceiver netReceiver = new ConnectionChangeReceiver();
            IntentFilter filterNet = new IntentFilter(""android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE"");

            registerReceiver(netReceiver, filterNet);
</code></pre>

<p>For my understanding this is saying that I've declared on a receiver, but I need one at the fragment.</p>

<p>So what I'm asking is: what should I do in order to pass the info from the receiver to the fragment, so that I could know if there's internet or not?<br>

<p>When I use a non final variable the result is ""B=0"" as expected.</p>

<p>What's going on?</p>

<p>here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>public class A {

    public void printMe(){

public class B extends A{

"8072492","1","","","2011-11-09 22:12:48","","1","384","<p>I am making a first attempt at writing fluent builders in C# so I can simplify the logic for creating object graphs.</p>

<p>My first thought was to create a fluent builder for each class, then nest them hierarchically like this:</p>

<pre><code>School school = SchoolBuilder.New()
  .WithName(""Whatchamatta U"")
  .AddClass(
      ClassBuilder.New()
      .WithName(""Arithmetic"")
      .WithClassNumber(""101"")
      .AddStudent(
         StudentBuilder.New()
         .WithName(""John Smith"")
      )
      .AddStudent(
         StudentBuilder.New()
         .WithName(""Jane Smith"")
      )
  )
  .Save()
</code></pre>

<p>This is straightforward to implement as a state machine using C# interfaces, and fairly easy to understand, both as a developer trying to read the code AND as a developer trying to create new code (""With*""=set a property, ""Add*""=add a child object, ""Save"" does whatever needs to be done to create the graph), but I thought it might be easier for a developer to read and write a DSL that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>School school = SchoolBuilder.New()
  .WithName(""Whatchamatta U"")
  .AddClass()
    .WithClassName(""Arithmetic"")
    .WithClassNumber(""101"")
    .AddStudent()
       .WithStudentName(""John Smith"")
    .AddStudent()
       .WithStudentName(""Jane Smith"")         
  .Save()
</code></pre>

<p>Since the messages for all builders are going through the topmost parent builder object, I think I need to find some way to route them down the hierarchy to the appropriate child builder object.  In Ruby this can be done with method_missing, but I can't see an smart way to implement this in C#.  </p>

<p>An ugly solution would be to have each parent implement the interface of every potential descendent object, where each method routes its invocation to the child.  Obviously this is not desirable, especially as I add more builder classes to the hierarchy, but I don't know of a concise way to ""virtually"" implement these interfaces at compile time but intercept all calls to that interface and proxy them down the tree, à la method_missing.  I can see that there are ways to dynamically implement interfaces at runtime in C# using a dynamic proxy but I don't think any of these will support intellisense.</p>

<p>My requirements are that a) this works with intellisense and b) any builder can be used to build objects without reference to its parent---meaning I want all builders to be able to handle the construction of its child-builders (meaning the the ugly solution would be <em>really</em> ugly)</p>

<p>Is there a way to take this second route in C#?  Or is this the wrong way to think about it?</p>

<p>I'm using a custom adapter that extends <code>FragmentPagerAdapter</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that when I change the tab, the first <code>Fragment</code> gets created again although it's not the currently visible.
Moreover, this only happens after changing the tab for the fourth time. E.g. tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3=> <code>onStop</code> from tab1 is called. -> tab2 => <code>onCreateView</code> from tab1 is called (<code>onAttach</code> is not called).</p>

<p>I want to avoid this. I need all tabs to remain always in their state even when they are not currently displayed.
How can I do this?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<pre><code>TRAFFIC (date),(input_quant),(output_quant),(status)
SUPPLY (input_quant), (output_quant),(status_comunal_waste)
</code></pre>

<p>After I import the DATE, INPUT, OUTPUT, STATUS data into the table TRAFFIC,
with the trigger AIR the data is also imported into the table SUPPLY, with the execption of columns USER_CHANGES, DATE_CHANGES, USER_DELETE, DATE_DELETE as to mimic the changes the  ""user"" has made if the ""user"" decides to change or add the data.</p>

<p>So far I've tried something like this</p>

<pre><code>create or replace TRIGGER supply_after_insert
after INSERT
ON traffic
FOR EACH ROW

DECLARE

Status_comunal_waste VARCHAR2(20);

BEGIN

SELECT SUM(input_quant) - SUM(output_quant)
into Status_comunal_waste
  FROM traffic
  WHERE (key_num_code =200101);

INSERT INTO supply
(Status_comunal_waste) VALUES (Status_comunal_waste);
 END;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Meanwhile I switched from creating a trigger to function, and this is written so far:</p>

<pre><code>create or replace 
FUNCTION   stat_comunal_waste (key_num_code number)

return number 

is

status_comunal_waste NUMBER;

BEGIN
if (key_num_code = 200101) THEN

SELECT SUM (input_quant) -  SUM (output_quant)
into status_comunal_waste
  FROM traffic
  WHERE key_num_code =200101;
  end if;

  return status_comunal_waste;
 END;
</code></pre>

<p>The function compiled with no errors but now I get errors with the PACKAGE</p>

<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Paket
IS
function stat_comunal_waste (key_num_code number)
return status_comunal_waste;
end Paket;

  <p>You have a data structure for Left Child Right Sibling tree that looks
  like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class TreeLCRSnode {
    public TreeLCRSnode parent, leftSon, rightSibling;
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You need to write a function named double avgH(TreeLCRSnode root) that
  will return back the result of average leaf height.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be sure everyone understand, leaf is a node without any child. So for example, if a tree looks like this,</p>

<pre><code>4

2----7
|
3
</code></pre>

<p>then there is two leafs, one at height 1 (no. 7) and one at height 2 (no. 3).</p>

connection to a DB Cluster of 2 Physical Servers pointing at the same MDF file location. One server is a Master and the other a Slave.</p>

<p>I have an example Database with two tables, lets say Users and UserTestResults</p>

<p>UserTestResults has a unique key which is used as a foreign key in the Users Table.</p>

<p>Lets say I want to update users results every ten minutes, to facilitate this we have a timestamp column on the results table. to check the last updated date.</p>

<p>The issue:
On occasion when I am attempting to update the results and committing the dbcontext, a table lock is generated (expected as we are doing an update on the table), it appears at the same time a request to view the results for that user is made, this request to select data from the table will wait until the update has completed, but some sort of lock appears to stay locked indefinitely (doesnt ever release). Any user then attempting to access this results view appears to wait for this process to complete, resulting in a db connection timeout.</p>

<p>This doesnt occur always but appears to be happening more frequently.</p>

<p>We are using Unity to register the DBContext and the Entity Framework Repository for the Results. the Entity Framework Repository is registered with PerResolveLifetimeManager.</p>

<p>We then manually fail over to the slave server and this appears to clear all locks.</p>

<p>Any ideas why this lock may not be releasing ever?

I'm going to attempt to explain my problem but it's kind of difficult to put into words, so please forgive me if I'm not the clearest.</p>

<p>I have a navbar-fixed-top at the top of my page. Under that I have a .container div. Inside there I have two div.spans (span4 and span8). Inside span4 is a div.well that has the affix-top class applied to it (so it gets a fixed position and ""sticks"" where it's at). Inside my span8 I have a bunch of content.</p>

<p>Inside the well div there is a nav-list. This list gets populated with li/a elements based on items in the span8 (I have a little script that does this). The links are anchors, so they point to elements on the page (#myId, #myIdTwo, etc). All this works wonderfully. My list is there, the links are clickable, they take me to my elements. Great.</p>

<p>However, not great. Sometimes, when I click one of the links, I go to my anchor in the span8 but the page doesn't seem to refresh properly. I sometimes see strange white ""boxes"". Or the content inside the span will show partly above the fixed nav-header. Sometimes half of the nav-list disappears.. but then comes back (sort-of) if I move my mouse around it. Like you used to see in some old Windows applications that were getting bogged down. </p>

<p>You can see for yourself here: <a href=""http://jaylach.github.com/lutra"">http://jaylach.github.com/lutra</a>. You may need to click some of the nav links a few times before you see the issue.</p>

<p>I've been struggling with this all day and I cannot, for the life of me, figure it out. I've taken out the affixes, I've taken out the fixed top navbar, I've taken out my z-index. I just can't seem to figure it out.</p>

<p>Does anyone, anywhere, have any clue as to what could be causing this? I would really appreciate any advice you guys could give. </p>

<p>By saying that i mean, supposing i have a a server-side ASP.NET function
GetTheResults as listof(string) or
GetTheResults as string ()</p>

<p>how am i supposed to pass those values as source required by the auto-complete?</p>

<p>The second problem is that the specific way does not use AJAX.
Which means i guess on the load of the form i will load all the available values to the source. Isn't that an overkill? </p>

<p>What do you suggest instead?</p>

FirewallRuleSet global {

    # FirewallRule syntax:
    # FirewallRule (block|drop|allow|log|ulog) [(tcp|udp|icmp) [port X]] [to IP/CIDR]

    ## To block SMTP out, as it's a tech support nightmare, and a legal liability
    #FirewallRule block tcp port 25

    ## Use the following if you don't want clients to be able to access machines on 
    ## the private LAN that gives internet access to wifidog.  Note that this is not
    ## client isolation;  The laptops will still be able to talk to one another, as
    ## well as to any machine bridged to the wifi of the router.
    # FirewallRule block to 192.168.0.0/16
    # FirewallRule block to 172.16.0.0/12
    # FirewallRule block to 10.0.0.0/8

    ## This is an example ruleset for the Teliphone service.
    #FirewallRule allow udp to 69.90.89.192/27
    #FirewallRule allow udp to 69.90.85.0/27
    #FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 69.90.89.205

    ## Use the following to log or ulog the traffic you want to allow or block.
    # For OPENWRT: use of these feature requires modules ipt_LOG or ipt_ULOG present in dependencies
    # iptables-mod-extra and iptables-mod-ulog (to adapt it to the linux distribution). 
    # Note: the log or ulog rule must be passed before, the rule you want to match.
    # for openwrt: use of these feature requires modules ipt_LOG or ipt_ULOG present in dependencies
    # iptables-mod-extra and iptables-mod-ulog
    # For example, you want to log (ulog works the same way) the traffic allowed on port 80 to the ip 69.90.89.205:
    #FirewallRule log tcp port 80 to 69.90.89.205
    #FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 69.90.89.205
    # And you want to know, who matche your block rule:
    #FirewallRule log to 0.0.0.0/0
    #FirewallRule block to 0.0.0.0/0

    FirewallRule allow mytestserver.com

}

# Rule Set: validating-users
#
# Used for new users validating their account
FirewallRuleSet validating-users {
    FirewallRule allow to 0.0.0.0/0
}

# Rule Set: known-users
#
# Used for normal validated users.
FirewallRuleSet known-users {
    FirewallRule allow to 0.0.0.0/0
}

# Rule Set: unknown-users
#
# Used for unvalidated users, this is the ruleset that gets redirected.
#
# XXX The redirect code adds the Default DROP clause.

</code></pre>

<p>And this HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=""refDropDown"" id=""refDropDown"" class=""items"" data-hidden-field=""DropDownReferral""&gt;
     &lt;option value=""""&gt;Please Select&lt;/option&gt;

     &lt;option value=""Steve T""&gt;Steve&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, the logic is:</p>

<ol>
<li>If 'Referral' which is a query string, gets passed, then I am checking the value in my select option and moving it on top and disabling the dropdown. <strong>NOT WORKING!</strong> See the picture below.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/wC2aP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>If the dropdown doesnt have the query string value then disable the dropdown and store it in the hidden field. <strong>(WORKING!)</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>What I am missing here?</p>

<p>If I am passing ?Referral=Albert, then it should show me 'Al' on top. If I am passing ?Referral=Steve, then is show 'Steve' on top and disable the dropdown.  </p>

<p>Suppose, we the following simple example:</p>

<pre><code>function Logger () {
    this.debug = function(msg) {
        // do some stuff with msg
        console.log(msg);
    };
}

var log = new Logger();
log.debug(""Hello"");

<p>If you open the page, Chrome shows up this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qSb2h.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qSb2h.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This indicates that the message was logged at <code>main.js:4</code> but what I really want is that it shows <code>main.js:9</code>. Because line 9 is where the logger was called.
For this simple case it doesn't make much difference, but when the Logger is in a separate file, it always shows <code>logger.js</code> instead of the class which called the logger.</p>

<p>The Logger class should do some additional stuff with the logged message (e.g. sending it to the server), thus I can't just use <code>this.debug = console.log</code>.</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em>:</p>

<p>There are already some similar questions, but all of them just add an additional line to the output, which isn't clickable to jump to the corresponding line:</p>

Its not required to display the Items in my grid, but i need to get customers sorted by the comma separated Items..</p>

<p>If I try to ""Build for Archive"" my app, the build process finishes without any errors or warnings. If I attempt to ""Archive"" though, it will throw a huge load of build errors at me. The errors (and the number of errors) are different every time I try.</p>

<p>The app still runs fine on the simulator and on the device. I have successfully archived the same app before, although the last successful archive was created using Xcode 4.0.1 (now 4.0.2).</p>

<p><strong>Live update:</strong></p>

<p>Amongst the mass of errors there is one recurring issue: It seems like the app's pch file (precompiled header file) can't be found. I suppose this is the root error for all of the other issues. The question remains why it can't be found while archiving, despite being perfectly available to all other build types (and even ""build for archive"")?</p>

<p>How can I overcome this error? If this is a bug in Xcode 4.0.2: Is there a way to archive a build without using the ""Archive"" option?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
This may be another hint: Right after complaining that the pch couldn't be found, another error says ""one or more PCH files were found, but they were invalid"" - hokay...</p>

I am heavily using both Redis and Socket.io throughout my code. So I want to know whether I should be utilizing Socket.io's <a href=""https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/wiki/Rooms"">Rooms</a> or I would be better off using redis' <a href=""http://redis.io/topics/pubsub"">pub-sub</a> ? </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> 
Just realized there is a very important reason why you may want to use redis pub/sub over socket.io rooms. With Socket.io rooms when you publish to listeners, the (browser)clients recieve the message, with redis it is actually the (redis~on server)clients who recieve messages. For this reason, if you want to inform all (server)clients of information specific to each client and maybe do some processing before passing on to browser clients, you are better off using redis. Using redis you can just fire off an event to generate each users individual data, where as with socket.io you have to actually generate all the users unique data at once, then loop through them and send them their individual data, which almost defeats the purpose of rooms, at least for me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for my purposes I am stuck with redis for now.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Ended up developing a plugin to use only 2 redis connections but still allow for individual client processing, see answer below....</p>

<p>Here is my model:</p>

<pre><code>public class QueueItem
{
    public virtual long ID { get; set; }
    public virtual DateTime AddedToQueue { get; set; }
    public virtual DateTime DontProcessUntil { get; set; }

    public virtual DataQueueItemState State { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the ID is a long.
I also have this bit of LINQ:</p>

<pre><code>            var nextID =
                from i in _repository
                where i.State == DataQueueItemState.GetDataQueue &amp;&amp; i.DontProcessUntil &lt; DateTime.UtcNow

                select new { ID = g.Min(i =&gt; i.ID) };
</code></pre>

<p>_repository is a data layer repository implementing IQueryable.</p>

<p>This query works fine. However, when I looked at the generated SQL, I saw this:</p>

<pre><code>NHibernate: select cast(min(queueitem0_.ID) as INTEGER) as col_0_0_ from ""QueueItem""
queueitem0_ where queueitem0_.State=@p0 and queueitem0_.DontProcessUntil&lt;@p1 group by
queueitem0_.State;@p0 = 'GetDataQueue' [Type: String (0)], @p1 = 28/03/2012 08:21:10
[Type: DateTime (0)]
</code></pre>

<p>The question is; why is the ID getting cast to an INTEGER?
In fact, why is it casting at all?</p>

<p>On the code side, the g.Min(i => i.ID) knows that it is returning a long.
A new anonymous type is being generated to hold the result and if I do a .elementAt(0).ID on it then it gives me a long as well so that all seems fine.</p>

"11496274","1","","","2012-07-15 22:44:56","","3","3030","<p>I am trying to create a simple ""inventory"" of items, much like in any RPG. I have <em>very basic</em> classes made, which have properties.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a base class of <code>item</code> and inheriting from that is <code>weapon</code>. <code>item</code> has properties (name, value, weight, ""important item"") that are also used within <code>weapon</code>, but <code>weapon</code> has extra properties (attack, defense, speed, handedness).</p>

<p>I've got the following code (sorry if the readability is horrible):</p>

<pre><code>static void Main(string[] args)
{   
     List&lt;item&gt; inventory = new List&lt;item&gt;();
     inventory.Add(new weapon(""Souleater"", 4000, 25.50f, false, 75, 30, 1.25f, 2));
                           //item---------------------------&gt;  weapon---------&gt;

     Console.Write(""Name: {0}\nValue: {1}\nWeight: {2}\nDiscardable: {3}\nAttack: {4}\nDefense: {5}\nSpeed: {6}\nHandedness: {7}"",
            inventory[0].Name, inventory[0].BValue, inventory[0].Weight, inventory[0].Discard, 
            inventory[0].Atk, inventory[0].Def, inventory[0].Speed, inventory[0].Hands);

     Console.ReadLine();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, what I'm trying to do is add a new <code>weapon</code> to the inventory, but the inventory is a <code>List&lt;item&gt;</code> type. I went out on a whim hoping that, due to it's inheritance, it'd be accepted. It was, but the properties specific to <code>weapon</code> aren't able to be accessed:</p>

<p><em>('shopSystem.item' does not contain a definition for 'Atk' and no extension method 'Atk' accepting a first argument of type 'shopSystem.item' could be found)</em></p>

<p>So, is there any way to achieve what I was intending here? Have an ""inventory"" which can store <code>item</code> objects, as well as <code>weapon</code>, <code>armour</code>, <code>accessory</code> etc. objects, which inherit from <code>item</code>?  It is also worth mentioning that I can access all of the desired properties if I declare the following:</p>

<pre><code>weapon Foo = new weapon(""Sword"", 200, 20.00f, false, 30, 20, 1.10f, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Many thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Here's the <code>item</code> and <code>weapon</code> classes, if anybody is interested:</p>

<pre><code>class item
{
    #region Region: Item Attributes
    protected string name = """";
    protected int baseValue = 0;
    protected float weight = 0.00f;

    #endregion

    public item(string n, int v, float w, bool nd){
        name = n; baseValue = v; weight = w; noDiscard = nd;}

    public string Name{
        get{return name;}
        set{if(value != """"){
            name = value;}
        }//end set
    }

    public int BValue{
        get{return baseValue;}
    }

    public float Weight{
        get{return weight;}
    }

    public bool Discard{
        get{return noDiscard;}
    }
}

class weapon : item
{
    #region Region: Weapon Attributes
    private int atk = 0;
    private int def = 0;
    private float speed = 0.00f;
    private byte hands = 0;
    #endregion

    public weapon(string n, int v, float w, bool nd, int a, int d, float s, byte h) : base(n, v, w, nd){
        atk = a; def =d; speed = s; hands = h;}

    public int Atk{
        get{return atk;}
    }

<p>So something like this, using Underscore's <code>filter</code> and <code>every</code> methods:</p>

<pre><code>/* the set of data */
var colors = [
  {
    ""id"": ""001"",
    ""tags"": [""color_family_white"", ""tone_warm"", ""room_study""]

  {
    ""id"": ""002"",
    ""tags"": [""color_family_white"", ""tone_neutral""]
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""003"",
    ""tags"": [""color_family_red"", ""tone_bright"", ""room_kitchen""]
  }
];

/* an example of white I might want to filter on */
var tags = [""color_family_white"", ""room_study""];

var results = _.filter(colors, function (color) {
    return _.every(tags, function() { /* ??? what to do here */} );
});
</code></pre>

<p>All tags should be present on <code>color.tags</code>.  So this should return only color 001.</p>

<p>So far I've managed to write the following script:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php
      $xml=new DOMDocument();
      $xml-&gt;formatOutput=true;
      $xml-&gt;preserveWhiteSpace=false;

<p>--------I've managed to add the nodes properly by replacing;---------</p>

<p>With the following code;</p>

<p>My one last question is, how do i remove a particular ban, where nick is equal to a user supplied string stored in the variable $buser. I used the following code. But using $buser in the condition creates errors.</p>

<pre><code>namespace CRAWebSiteMVC.Models
{
    public partial class Employee
    {

        partial void OnPasswordChanging(global::System.String value);
        partial void OnPasswordChanged();

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>But now, whenever I try to assign a value to password it always end up have a null value.</p>

<p>E.g : </p>

<pre><code>  [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult Create([Bind(Exclude = ""Id"")] Employee objEmployee, FormCollection form)
    {
        ViewBag.CompanyList = _service.ListCompany();
        ViewBag.SupervisorList = _service.ListSupervisor();

        objEmployee.CreatedDate = System.DateTime.Now; // They will get the good value
        objEmployee.UpdatedDate = System.DateTime.Now;

        objEmployee.Password = form[""Password""]; // will always be = to null, even when the form is filled
    }
</code></pre>

<p>What can be the cause of this?</p>

<p>EDIT : Password now has a value, thank you all.</p>

<p>But now the following error occures : </p>

<pre><code>An error occurred while updating the entries. See the inner exception for details.

<p>At this point :</p>

<pre><code> public Employee Create(Employee objEmployee)

<ul>
<li>The x/y/z coordinates of the particle (of length <code>a</code>, which is <code>3</code> for a 3d space)</li>
<li>The index of the individual particle (of length <code>b</code>)</li>
<li>The index of the time step it's on (of length <code>c</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it better to construct the array such that <code>particles.shape == (a, b, c)</code> or <code>particles.shape == (c, b, a)</code>? </p>

<p>I'm more interested in convention than efficiency: Numpy arrays can be set up in either C-style (last index varies most rapidly) or Fortran-style (first index), so it can efficiently support either setup. I also realize I can use <code>transpose</code> to put the indexes in any order I need, but I'd like to minimize that.</p>

<p>I started to research this myself and found support for both ways:</p>

<p>Pro-(c,b,a):</p>

<ul>
<li>By default, Numpy uses C-style arrays where the last index is the fastest-varying.</li>
<li>Most of the vector algebra functions (<code>inner</code>, <code>cross</code>, etc.) act on the last index. (<code>dot</code> acts on the last of one and the second-to-last of the other.)</li>
<li>The <code>matplotlib</code> collection objects (<code>LineCollection</code>, <code>PolyCollection</code>) expect arrays with the spatial coordinates in the last axis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pro-(a,b,c):</p>

<ul>
<li>If i were to use <code>meshgrid</code> and <code>mgrid</code> to produce a set of points, it would put the spatial axis first. For instance, <code>np.mgrid[0:5,0:5,0:5].shape == (3,5,5,5)</code>. I realize these functions are mostly intended for <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html#integer-array-indexing"" rel=""nofollow"">integer array indexing</a>, but it's not uncommon to use them to generate a grid of points. </li>
<li>The <code>matplotlib</code> <code>scatter</code> and <code>plot</code> functions split out their arguments, so it's agnostic to the shape of the array, but <code>ax.plot3d(particles[0], particles[1], particles[2])</code> is shorter to type than the version with <code>particles[..., 0]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In general it appears that there are two different conventions in existence (probably due to historical differences between C and Fortran), and it's not clear which is more common in the Numpy community, or more appropriate for what I'm doing.</p>

Inside the email content is css to style hyperlinks within the email message. The message content is retrieved from the server using a php script and echoed. jQuery gets the content returned from the php script and puts it in the div's inner html with:</p>

"32125711","1","","","2015-08-20 18:28:19","","1","46","<p>I am extending the APIMan / Wildfly Docker image with my own image which will do two things:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Drop my .war file application into the Wildfly
  standalone/deployments directory</p>
  
  <p>2) Execute a series of cURL commands that would query the Wildfly
  server in order to configure APIMan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially, I tried creating two Docker images (the first to drop in the .war file and the second to execute the cURL commands), however I incorrectly assumed that the CMD instruction in the innermost image would be executed first and CMD's would be executed outward.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>ImageA:
FROM jboss/apiman-wildfly:1.1.6.Final
RUN /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/add-user.sh admin admin --silent
COPY /RatedRestfulServer/target/RatedRestfulServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/

CMD [""/opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh"", ""-b"", ""0.0.0.0"", ""-bmanagement"", ""0.0.0.0"", ""-c"", ""standalone-apiman.xml""]
</code></pre>

<p>And</p>

<pre><code>ImageB:
FROM ImageA
COPY /configure.sh /opt/jboss/wildfly/

CMD [""/opt/jboss/wildfly/configure.sh""]
</code></pre>

<p>I had initially assumed that during runtime Wildfly / APIMAN would be started first (per the ImageA CMD instruction) and then my custom script would be run (per ImageB CMD instruction).  I'm assuming that's incorrect because throughout the entire hierarchy, only 1 CMD instruction is executed (the last one in the outermost Dockerfile within the chain)?</p>

<p>So, I then attempted to merge everything into 1 Dockerfile which would (in the build process) startup Wildfly / APIMAN, run the cURL commands, shutdown the wildfly server and then the CMD command would start it back up during runtime and Wildfly / APIMan would be configured.  This, however, does not work because when I start Wildfly (as part of the build), it controls the console and waits for log messages to display, thus the build never completes.  If I append an '&amp;' at the end of the RUN command, it does not run (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27699702/dockerfile-run-results-in-a-no-op"">Dockerfile : RUN results in a No op</a>).</p>

<p>Here is my Dockerfile for this attempt:</p>

<pre><code>FROM jboss/apiman-wildfly:1.1.6.Final
RUN /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/add-user.sh admin admin --silent
COPY /RatedRestfulServer/target/RatedRestfulServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/
COPY /configure.sh /opt/jboss/wildfly/
RUN /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -bmanagement 0.0.0.0 -c standalone-apiman.xml
RUN /opt/jboss/wildfly/configure.sh
RUN /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect controller=127.0.0.1 command=:shutdown

CMD [""/opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh"", ""-b"", ""0.0.0.0"", ""-bmanagement"", ""0.0.0.0"", ""-c"", ""standalone-apiman.xml""]
</code></pre>

<p>Are there any solutions to this?  I'm trying to have my ""configure.sh"" script run AFTER Wildfly / APIMan are started up.  It wouldn't matter to me whether this is done during the build process or at run time, however I don't see any way to do it during the build process because Wildfly doesn't have a daemon mode.</p>

If you wait then the sound play again, then stop, then play again...</p>

<p>Here is a demo app that shows the problem. If you hold the enter button in the console, you will hear a note repeatedly. After some time (likely less than a minute), the sound will stop (event if you keep the button pressed), and then it will come back.</p>

<p>I'm working with Wordpress, though this will fit most website dev scenario's.  I want to manage the site install with a git repo and also manage various WP plugins, jQuery plugins and  other code bits in separate repos which can easily be pulled/pushed from their external sources.    Seems simple enough until you look at the details...</p>

<h1>The criteria</h1>

<p><strong>""Subfolders"" criterion</strong>
The folder for each plugin should not be bound to the root folder of its source repo.  Many repos have multiple nested folders such as ""my-repo-name/..."", ""dev/"", ""test/"", ""src/"" where the contents of the later is the thing required.  This is important to keep the referencing URLs clean and to minimise publicly available rubbish.</p>

<p><strong>""No Proxys"" criterion</strong> 
The ideal solution would not require additional intermediary branches or repos.  Pushing changes to a plugin's external source should be simple and not require multiple intermediary merges/pushes.   </p>

<p><strong>""Real Files"" criterion</strong> 
Ideally the outer repo for the whole website should actually contain the files of the plugins' subrepos (ie no ""submodules"").  I could be persuaded away from this one though...</p>

<p><strong>""Publishing"" criterion</strong> 
It must play well with rsync and/or git push'ing to the live server</p>

<h1>I've looked at these five solutions</h1>

<p><strong>Git Submodules</strong> Simple enough for making changes and pushing/pulling but submodules fail on the ""Subfolders"" and ""Real File"" criteria</p>

<p><strong>Git read-tree/subtree merge</strong> Solves the ""Real Files"" problem and <code>read-tree</code> actually lets you reference a branch's subfolder but when I did so and tried to merge changes on master back upstream, Git failed to remember that it came from a subfolder and merged master's whole structure into the ext libs tracking branch...so FAIL on this criterion.</p>

<p><strong>Apenwarrs subtree extension <a href=""https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree"" rel=""nofollow"">(here)</a></strong>
Great for the ""Real Files"" criterion and fairly simple to push/pull until you want to enforce the ""Subfolders"" rule.  At best it then seems to require intermediary branches where you split out the folder you want from the remote tracking branch and then add this as a subtree to your master branch.  I didn't have much luck merging/pushing changes on master back to the source repo.  I still think there might be possibility here...</p>

<p><strong>Symbolic links with external repo</strong>
Great solution until GIT stopped following symlinks.  Now it fails on ""Real Files"" and ""Publishing"" criteria</p>

<p><strong>Nested repos</strong>
Somewhere I saw an SO answer where if you explicitly <code>git add</code> a folder which contains another repo and include the trailing slash, git will NOT submodule it but instead track the individual files.  This seemed promising but it fails on the ""Subfolders"" criterion.</p>

<h1>What next?</h1>

<p>I've seen references to ""sparse checkout"" - or perhaps a something involving branch pruning.  I'm hoping to avoid a solution that involves shell scripts or is so complex that it requires me to re-learn it every time (infrequent) I make a change to a plugin.  It needs to be easier than maintaining a separate repo for each plugin and copying back and forth from the main CMS installation.</p>

<p>Surely someone has a simple functional way to make this common dev scenario work??  Thanks in advance for the help...</p>

<p>Can i realize this with a single SQL statement?</p>

I studied programming in high school and college (BS IT) and find it relatively easy. The hard part for me has been the rest of the software development life cycle. They don't seem to teach that as much in school.</p>

<p>I'm trying to reach as many platforms as possible. I started coding in JavaScript (with the intent to use PhoneGap), but local storage seems tedious and I decided to lean more towards application development than web development. Then I started over with Mono and C# and it was great fun and easy. Then I discovered the price tag and I can't afford to buy Xamarin. So, I think, I want to try C++ and Qt. Qt4 and Necessitas currently allow for Android and Qt5 is supposed to include iOS and Android sometime this year (plus all the desktops and loads of embedded systems).</p>

<p>Now I'm struggling with the idea of unit testing. The Nunit tests for C# were super easy to learn and run in both Visual Studio and MonoDevelop. C++ unit testing seems a little tougher, but I want to be Agile and use TDD. Qt Creator, however, as far as I can tell does not support automated unit tests. Eclipse does have automated unit tests with the CUTE plugin, but the Qt designer plugin for Eclipse has been abandoned. That probably won't help for mobile GUI design as Digia is still working in that arena and the old plugin was made by Nokia.</p>

<p>I think I want to put all of my code (OOP classes) in one library, put all of my unit tests in another library or project, and then create another project for the app/main/GUI of each platform that I aim to develop for. I'm using free/open licensing, so I'd start a project on SourceForge or something using Git. What I'm thinking is that I could use Eclipse to write the code and tests. When I need to do some GUI stuff, push the changes, close Eclipse, open Qt Creator, pull the work I just did in Eclipse and then start playing with the GUI.</p>

<p>Does anyone do this? Could this work? Is this madness? Better ideas?</p>

<p>p.s. stackoverflow is already warning me that this question appears subjective and is likely to be closed. I'm not looking to start a debate. I'm just wondering if this idea could work and if there is anything else along these lines immediately coming to mind that I have missed.</p>

<p>I have a web application that uses a master page. I am adding a user control that I wrote to one of the content pages. I added the user control to the aspx page by dragging and dropping it from the toolbox. I am able to see the user control from the code behind, but I cannot access the public functions. To fix that problem, I created an object of the user control in the code behind and used the LoadControl function. All of that seems to work fine.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is when I am trying to hook the into the EventHandler from the aspx page to the user control. Everything compiles and runs just fine, but I am not seeing anything happen on the page. I think the issue is that the EventHandler is always null.</p>

Each meal has some foods listed underneath that. I have a form_tag and text_field_tag that go right under the last food in each meal that uses autocomplete. </p>

<p>When I type into the first text_field I can see my server processing the request. Although when I type something into the other text_fields below the first one, the server doesn't seem to be processing anything at all. </p>

<p>It seems that the form_tag only gets applied to the first text_field_tag directly below it since chrome console shows a closing  tag  under it. </p>

<p>The form_tag doesn't show up for the other text_field_tags at all. </p>

<p>What's funny is that the default hidden div underneath the form_tag DOES show up for the other form_tags... </p>

<p>I know that servlets are modules that run inside request/response-oriented servers, such as Java-enabled web servers. But now i don't hear anyone working with servlets.It may be that 'I' don't have people around who are much interested in servlets. But the thing is where servlets are used can't we write scripts in <code>PHP</code> or program in <code>asp</code> for that part ?</p>

<p>When i came to know that JDK'S <strong>IO</strong> classes can only work with system files,i thought of writting the particular application in php but because i love java i gave a look at <code>servlet</code>. </p>

<p><em>My knowledge of servlets is not much,but because i needed some application on server that could generate a response when a button is clicked from my applet i came across <code>servlet</code>. But then i thought is there anything that only servlets can do ?</em></p>

<p>I know I can <code>createElement('canvas')</code>, convert Image data to base64 and XHR POST the data, but I would like to see if it is possible to let Firefox handle it.</p>

<p>Normally, a user will click BROWSE on the site, Firefox will then Open <code>File Upload</code> dialogue, select file, and click OPEN. </p>

<p>I would like to automate that from the context menu so that a <strong>local file</strong> opened by the browser (ie an image) can be uploaded to the destination directly.</p>

<p>Is that possible and how?</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> </p>

<p>In file selection for upload via Firefox, these are the required data:<br>
- target form<br>
- local file location<br>
- The action attached to the OPEN button in FILE UPLOAD dialogue box  </p>

<p>In a context menu situation that I would like to create:<br>
- target form: will be hard-coded in the script<br>
- local file location: the file that is right-clicked (ie <code>gContextMenu.target.src</code>)<br>
- The action: here is what I would like to do and attach 'command' to the function of the above button (the existing Firefox function)</p>

<p>That means, not manually creating <code>new XMLHttpRequest()</code> and POSTing the data, and instead using the existing function of Firefox. </p>

<p>In other words, manually feed the 'target form' &amp; 'local file location' to the OPEN button function of FILE UPLOAD as if that was the process that was executed.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3509756/opening-a-socket-io-connection-in-a-google-chrome-extension"">Opening a Socket.IO connection in a google chrome extension</a> says this can't be done; and</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8970880/cross-domain-socket-io"">Cross Domain Socket.Io</a> says it can.</p>

<p>Is there any special configuration I must change in order to accept emits from my socket server?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>(Note: I'm using AngularJS, but it shouldn't be relevant to this question)</p>

<p>socketFactory.js:</p>

<pre><code>myApp.factory('socketFactory', function($rootScope) {
  var socket = io.connect('//dev.mydomain.com', {'path': '/api/socket'});
  return socket;
}
</code></pre>

<p>inject.js:</p>

<pre><code>var packetData = { 'some':'data', 'roomId':'123abc' };
socketFactory.emit('room:join', packetData);
...
socketFactory.on('room:update', function (data) {
  console.log('Received data from socket server');
  console.log(data)
}
</code></pre>

<p>socket.js (server-side):</p>

<pre><code>socket.on('room:join', function ( data ) {
  // Setting socketId to detect disconnect
  data.user.socketId = socket.id;

  socket.join( data.roomId, function() {
    // Some code ...
    io.sockets.to(data.roomId).emit('room:update', {'some':'data', 'roomId': '123abc'});
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>That's the basic setup of my connection. This system works perfectly when I launch the app in non-extension mode (we're making an extension to emulate our webapp), but when in the extension, <code>room:update</code> is never triggered.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>:</p>

<p>We did a <code>console.log</code> on the <code>socket</code> object (generated on connect) in <code>socket.js</code>. Inside the headers, it appears the host is <code>dev.mydomain.com</code>, while the referrer is <code>www.othersite.com</code>. Could this be the problem? What does ""host"" refer to? Host of the socket server, or host of the socket listener? In the latter case, it would make sense it's not reaching <code>www.othersite.com</code> over which we have the extension running.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: ...And it started working out of nowhere. Must be a race condition somewhere. Closing the question as no longer relevant.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>What's the proper way to notify the client of any error that took place? Return false? Use GearmanJob::sendFail()? If it's the latter, do I need to return from my doSomethingFunc() after calling sendFail()? Should the return value be whatever sendFail() returns?</p>

<p>The client is using GearmanClient::returnCode() to check for failures. Additionally, simply using ""return $value"" seems to work, but should I be using GearmanJob::sendData() or GearmanJob::sendComplete() instead?</p>

<p>First I will give you a sum-up of my code and then explains the problem.</p>

<p>main.cpp : Declare a new QApplication</p>

<pre><code>`int main( int argc, char *argv[] )
{
    main_app = new QApplication( argc, argv ) ;
    [....]
}`
</code></pre>

<p>mainwindow.h : header of the mainwindow</p>

<pre><code>    class MainWindow : public QMainWindow
    {
     Q_OBJECT

    public :

     void generate_click( int coord_x, int coord_y ) ;

    [...]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>mainwindow.cpp: definition of my function</p>

<pre><code>    void MainWindow::generate_click(int x, int y)
    {


        printf(""Enter generate_click : (%d/%d)\n"", x, y) ;

        QPoint _pos_click( x, y ) ;
        QWidget *receiver = QApplication::widgetAt( _pos_click ) ;

        if(receiver == 0)
            printf(""No element at the position (%d, %d)\n"", x, y) ;
        else
        {
            QMouseEvent *event = new QMouseEvent(QEvent::MouseButtonPress, receiver-&gt;mapFromGlobal(_pos_click), Qt::LeftButton, Qt::LeftButton, Qt::NoModifier);
            main_app-&gt;postEvent(receiver, event);
            QMouseEvent *release = new QMouseEvent(QEvent::MouseButtonRelease, receiver-&gt;mapFromGlobal(_pos_click), Qt::LeftButton, Qt::LeftButton,Qt::NoModifier);
            main_app-&gt;postEvent(receiver, release);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This way it is NOT working, even if the coordinates are good in my first printf. I never see the error ""receiver == 0 ). If we modify the Qt library to add a log in the function PostEvent we see that x or y (randomly) equal 0 or 1 so that's why there is no click.</p>

<p>If I modify x and y this way (give a value to x / y ) it WORKS all the time : </p>

<pre><code>void MainWindow::generate_click(int x, int y)
{

    x = 20 ;
    y = 80 ;

    printf(""Enter generate_click : (%d/%d)\n"", x, y) ;

    QPoint _pos_click( x, y ) ;
    QWidget *receiver = QApplication::widgetAt( _pos_click ) ;

    if(receiver == 0)
        printf(""No element at the position (%d, %d)\n"", x, y) ;
    else
    {
        QMouseEvent *event = new QMouseEvent(QEvent::MouseButtonPress, receiver-&gt;mapFromGlobal(_pos_click), Qt::LeftButton, Qt::LeftButton, Qt::NoModifier);
        main_app-&gt;postEvent(receiver, event);
        QMouseEvent *release = new QMouseEvent(QEvent::MouseButtonRelease, receiver-&gt;mapFromGlobal(_pos_click), Qt::LeftButton, Qt::LeftButton,Qt::NoModifier);
        main_app-&gt;postEvent(receiver, release);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I add an addition to the coordinate I receive, it also WORKS ! </p>

<pre><code>void MainWindow::generate_click(int x, int y)
{

    x = x + 5;
    y = y + 5;

    printf(""Enter generate_click : (%d/%d)\n"", x, y) ;

    QPoint _pos_click( x, y ) ;
    QWidget *receiver = QApplication::widgetAt( _pos_click ) ;

    if(receiver == 0)
        printf(""No element at the position (%d, %d)\n"", x, y) ;
    else
    {
        QMouseEvent *event = new QMouseEvent(QEvent::MouseButtonPress, receiver-&gt;mapFromGlobal(_pos_click), Qt::LeftButton, Qt::LeftButton, Qt::NoModifier);
        main_app-&gt;postEvent(receiver, event);
        QMouseEvent *release = new QMouseEvent(QEvent::MouseButtonRelease, receiver-&gt;mapFromGlobal(_pos_click), Qt::LeftButton, Qt::LeftButton,Qt::NoModifier);
        main_app-&gt;postEvent(receiver, release);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even if the Qt documentation says that QPoint is expecting an integer, I think that the addition or the fact that we give fixed coordinates will cast them in a type expected by QPoint.</p>

<p>Are you able to tell me why the first example is not working ?</p>

<p>I hope my problem is clear and let me know if you need more information.
Thanks in advance.</p>

I have a composite class which extends Icon and has an ArrayList that holds a custom class implementing Icon and extending ImageIcon. I want to call the composites paintIcon() method and loop through the ArrayList, and paint all the contained Icons. I can paint an Icon to the screen if I simply call an ImageIcon and add it to my panel. I don't understand why the paintIcon() called from the CompositeIcon isn't working. The following method loops the ArrayList, but doesn't seem to print from the screen. when setIcon() is called in the GUI, shouldn't this paint onto the JPanel?</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void paintIcon(Component c, Graphics g, int i, int i1) {
    for(int j = 0; j &lt; icons.size(); j++){
        icons.get(j).paintIcon(c, g, listX.get(j), listY.get(j));
    }
}

<p>So far I have a tester:</p>

<pre><code>public class Display extends JFrame {


public CompositeIcons icons = new CompositeIcons();



public Display() throws MalformedURLException{
    super();

    this.setTitle(""Composite Pattern"");
    this.setSize(600, 600);
    this.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
    this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    //this.setResizable(false);
    this.setLayout(new FlowLayout());


    ImageIcon image = new ImageIcon(""discover.png"");
    IconOne iconOne = new IconOne(""discover.png"");    

    icons.addIcon(iconOne, 10, 10);

    JPanel panel = new JPanel();
    JLabel label = new JLabel();
    label.setIcon(icons);
    panel.add(label);
    panel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.GRAY, 1, true));
    panel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(100,100));
    this.add(panel);
    this.setVisible(true);
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>and a composite class:</p>

<pre><code>public class CompositeIcons implements Icon {

private ArrayList&lt;Icon&gt; icons = new ArrayList();
private ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; listX = new ArrayList();
private ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; listY = new ArrayList();



public void addIcon(Icon icon, int x, int y){
    icons.add(icon);
    listX.add(x);
    listY.add(y);
}




@Override
public void paintIcon(Component c, Graphics g, int i, int i1) {
    for(int j = 0; j &lt; icons.size(); j++){
        icons.get(j).paintIcon(c, g, listX.get(j), listY.get(j));

Consider a cache memory system having the following characteristics :
-512 Mbytes of main memory.
-Word size of 4 bytes.
-Cache size of 512 Kbytes.
-Line size of 8 bytes. 
Determine the direct cache memory mapping address format.</p>

<p>What I have so far: </p>

<p>Main memory would consist of 2^29 bytes but as each word is 4 bytes 2^29 bytes/2^2 bytes = 2^27 and thus 27 bits are needed to represent a memory address. Now I am a little confused about what cache line size is, is this the actual length of each line in cache(tag field, block field and word/index field  = 8 bytes?) Because if this is the case I am a little confused about how I am supposed to map a 27 bit address (containing 4 byte word data) to a cache where each line has 64 bits(8 bytes) and how many memory blocks would it take(as doesn't cache memory and main memory have to have the same amount of memory addresses in each block for this mapping scheme to work?). Also does cache actually store data or is all contents in cache just a mapping to main memory?</p>

<p>There is another question similar to this here on SA, but the accepted answer was about a threading issue with what I believe was an inproc server using the WebBrowser control, and again I am using an out or process server, so I don't believe any threading issue applies to my problem.</p>

<p>Specifically, I need an image viewer that will allow the image to grow and change while not altering the coordinates of any older (unchanged) tiles. This means that the center point (0,0), where the image started growing from, must always remain (0,0). So I'm looking for a library that will allow me to use a very basic Cartesian coordinate system (no map projection!), which will ask for tiles infinitely in all directions with no repetition (as opposed to how map libraries just ignore y-axis above and below the map, but the x axis repeats).</p>

<p>There's another catch. I need zoom level 0 to be zoomed <em>in</em> all the way. Since the image is constantly growing, there's no way to tell what the max zoom level will be, and the coordinates need to be based on the base image layer tiles so that every tile in zoom level z contains 2^z base layer tiles.</p>

<p>I am wondering if this is possible with OpenLayers and how to do it. If it's not, any suggestions of other (open-source javascript) libraries that can do this would be very appreciated! I've tried playing around with <a href=""http://polymaps.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Polymaps</a>, but the documentation is lacking too much for me to be able to tell if it will work. So far no luck.</p>

<p>Please let me know if none of this made sense, and I'll try to include some images or better explanations. Thanks! </p>

I created one app, but I don't feel like I have a strong grasp of the time and date functions, especially when being stored in the database. O one of my main concerns is how to store and retrieve dates from the database (SQLite) and compare them.</p>

<p>The way I do it in PHP is I simple; I use the <code>time()</code> function, which creates a unix timestamp for the current time, and then I store it as an integer in a MySQL database. This makes things very simple and easy due to MySQL's date functions, as well as the ability to easily retrieve and compare the date via PHP as an integer.</p>

<p>So basically, I'm wondering what the best solution would be for Java. What do you recommend I do when creating, storing, retrieving, and comparing dates for my future Android apps?</p>

<p>Here is an example of the PHP code I'd use, perhaps this will give someone a better idea of what I'm used to and what I'm looking for:</p>

<pre><code>Database structure:
`id` (int) auto increment
`username` (varchar)
`the_date` (int)

&lt;?php

$username = 'scarhand77';
$the_date = time();

// insert into database

mysql_query(""insert into `stack_overflow` (`username`, `the_date`) values ('$username', '$the_date')"");

// retrieve from database

$user_date = mysql_result(mysql_query(""select `the_date` from `stack_overflow` where `username`='$username'""), 0);

// compare $user_date, see if its older than right now

if ($user_date &lt; time())
    echo 'it is older';
else
    echo 'it is not older';

<p>But I can't really draw any useful information out of it, different from the first question where it was clear that the drive the installation package was run from is actually a network drive.</p>

<p>In this case though, the installation resides directly under <code>C:\</code>, but somehow MSI still tries to locate something in Internet Explorers cache files, which I can't wrap my head around.</p>

<p>What's happening here and how can I fix it?</p>

<p><em><strong>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>After trying the command</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt; msiexec /i myInstallation.msi REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus /qb
</code></pre>

<p>I get an error window telling me</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A network error ocurred while attempting to read from the file C:\myInstallation[1].msi</p>

<p>How can this happen when I'm executing (and refreshing) everything from <code>C:</code>?</p>

<p>Lets say you have a table, where you have three buttons in each table row, and table rows can be added dynamically. How would you guys suggest binding these to the presenter?</p>

<p>The new row, if following Google's proposed structure, will get generated in the view, which does not have a direct link to the presenter and can not call back to it (so no calling <code>bindNewButtons(Button, Button, Button)</code>-ish type method).</p>

<p>So, what's good practice here? I was thinking since the presenter will be handling the event which adds a new row in the widget inside the view (handles as in, fires the method in the view which generates this new row), I could have a <code>getRowButtons(int index)</code> method in the view, and then using this to retrieve the components and bind them after they where added.</p>

<p>I'm sure there's a more clever way of doing this though, so I'm seeking a bit of advice here.</p>

<p>I wrote a program in Java with eclipse on Windows. My program makes use of Java hidapi library, which is a Java wrapper of the C version hidapi library (.dll). In eclipse, by adding the Java hidapi to the build path and setting the C hidapi as a native library, everything works just fine.</p>

<p>Now I want to do the same on Ubuntu. The same Java hidapi is used, which now will make use of the C version hidapi library for Linux (a .so file). When making the C version hidapi library for Linux, it turns out that I need another library called libusb-1.0 (which hidapi needs to deals with the low level communication). So I install libusb-1.0 (now I have a libusb-1.0.so file under /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu), make the C version hidapi library for Linux. I have a small C program and I test it under bash, it works so I believe until this point everything, both libsub-1.0.so and C version hidapi library for Linux libhidapi-jni.so are installed/generated correctly, and when running the small C program the system is able to find the shared libusb-1.0.so library without explicitly mentioning where libsub-1.0 is (which makes sense because libusb-1.0 is installed in a place where the system loader will always search).</p>

<p>So I go to eclipse. I import the eclipse work space, add the Java hidapi to the build path (as I did in Windows), move the C version hidapi library for Linux (the .so file) into a folder called 'lib' (where the .dll version of native library also resides). And I set the native library to 'lib', by ""build path"" -> ""configure build path"" -> ""libraries"" tab -> ""native library location"". So till this point, the two native libraries are: libusb-1.0 under /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu, and hidapi.so under 'wherever eclipse workspace is'/lib. Finally in the source code I add two lines: </p>

<p>System.loadLibrary(""usb-1.0""); // Call this line A.</p>

<p>System.loadLibrary(""hidapi-jni""); // Call this line B.</p>

<p>I run the program as a Java application. It reports ""java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no usb-1.0 in java.library.path"" at line A. So I guess the Java runtime is not able to find where libsub-1.0 is.</p>

<p>Just for clarification, I already did the following trials, none of them worked.</p>

<ol>
<li>Remain the two libraries where they are, add vm argument (Run -> Run Configuration -> Arguments -> VM arguments): -Djava.library.path=""${workspace_loc:project_name}/lib;
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu"". It gives: ""java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no usb-1.0 in java.library.path"" at line A.</li>
<li>Undo 1. Move libsub-1.0.so to 'wherever eclipse workspace is'/lib, so now the two .so files are together. Set .jar's native library location to this folder. It gives ""java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: blablabla: undefined symbol: libusb_control_transfer"" at line B. So I think it founds the libusb library, however the symbol (which should be in libusb) is still unresolved. This is really weird.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can anyone help me? Thanks in advance.</p>

"29672620","1","","","2015-04-16 10:56:51","","3","42","<p>I recently started working on a site as a side project. As I am not entirely sure yet what method should I use to handle/display content, I spent the last two days with trying to find the best method, unfortunately I found nothing useful - most likely because I do not know the correct terms to search by.</p>

<p>Basically, the site would use a menu system (unrelated to my question) to navigate the users to different categories which would let them select a  piece of content. The site then would display that page.</p>

<p>Here is a mockup of the content display system I want to build:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/y423V.jpg"" alt=""Content layout mockup""></p>

<p>Every 'article' would be displayed like this (with some modifications in a few special one): they have a simple background image, a title, a few paragraphs of information,  one or two links to outside sources and an image which is sometimes can be interacted with (clicking on it plays a sound, for example). None of these can be modified by the users (and it won't be possible in the future, either) - the only way to edit content (currently) is to edit strings in the database or edit the images/sounds stored on the server.</p>

<p>My biggest problem is that I have not enough experience to be able to determine the best way to do it. Currently I use a lot of JavaScript - probably even too much. When the user clicks on a category, a code runs that generates a submenu (as it didn't exists before the button press) based on a database. This submenu is filled with buttons that are linked to different 'articles' and use the same method: on button press they generate and display the content.</p>

<p>I know this is a bad practice - during my research I read that I should not build the entire site from JS, but I used the same method in my previous project, where I had to make a system that lets the users view and modify a huge amount of DB entries in a quick and user-friendly way. Because of this I started to prototype the menu system using the same practices. But I plan to make a site that is available to a bigger user base and it entirely possible that I can't do it the same way - the previous site wasn't built to be usable by people with disabilities, for example.</p>

<p>Currently I have three options to manage content:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the same method as before: have a few pre-built elements then generate the requested content only when I have to, but do that every time the same content is opened. It's very JS heavy, but the user only have to download the necessary resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Create everything beforehand, so the site only displays the content. It does require less JavaScript and makes it possible to build most of the site with pure HTML and CSS. It comes with big(ger) downloads.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine the two methods: generate the content when the user needs it, but also store it, so returning to it only displays the already existing 'article'.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Could you advise me about best practice to use? </p>

When I break down both dates into their respective components and re-assemble them into the new date.. everything seems to be correct except the hours.  Im sure its something simple that has to do with the timezone or the NSGregorianCalendar, but I am new to iOS, and programming NSCalendar.  Im hoping someone will catch the simple mistake Im making.</p>

<p>The result of the log printing the revisedCorrectedDate shows everything correct that I set except the hours.  This has to be a simple fix.. I just don't see it.  Thank you in advance!</p>

My applet runs, but it won't repaint. If you could give me any pointers, I'd appreciate it. Believe it or not, I actually went to school for this (Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science). However, that was two years ago, and I pretty much haven't touched it since. I'm pretty good when it comes to the basics (classes, methods, variables, etc.), but I'm afraid I'm a bit lacking on the graphics and threading / multi-threading. A lot of the code came from the Lantronix manual (available here: <a href=""http://www.endurance-rc.com/media/Creating_Custom_Web_Pages.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.endurance-rc.com/media/Creating_Custom_Web_Pages.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>The code requires a string of 5 'chunks' of characters, each separated by a space, sent by a ServerSocket over port 10001.</p>

<p>EDIT: The server updates the string regularly. If a window is moved over my applet, the part of the applet underneath the window will repaint. However, I can't seem to find the way to trigger it whenever the characters change.
/EDIT</p>

<p>Any direction you can give me would be much appreciated.</p>

I am trying to add a GUI to to an existing project. More specifically to a plugin that is loaded as a <code>.so</code> file (or when compiled on win32 a <code>.dll</code>)</p>

<p>The project has its own threading implementation already to deal with portability. I know that Qt has its own cross platform threading model but it would be preferable to stay within this existing threading model.</p>

<p>My question to the Qt veterans out there [I have only just started reading the docs] is: Would it be possible to embed a GUI using Qt in to a plugin as described above? The plugin already is a command line interface and I would like to have the GUI optional, even if its compiled in. Since those standard functions get called by the main program, the GUI (which I assume will live in another thread) will have to be accessible or able to have methods called on it so that the CLI thread can coexist and the standard functions can work with any permutation of the two interfaces.</p>

<h2><em>edit 1:</em></h2>

<p>after playing with the code a bit I am able to launch a simple GUI from the plugin. The plugin already is the CLI and has functions that are called from the main program. I simply created a new thread on initialization of the plugin and launched the blocking GUI from there:</p>

<pre><code>QApplication app(NULL, NULL);
window = new zGui;
window-&gt;show();
app.exec();
</code></pre>

<p>The question here is: Is it possible to communicate with the GUI or rather access GUI elements from the CLI thread?</p>

<h2>edit 2: some results</h2>

<p>Alright, so far starting the blocking GUI in a separate thread has worked with no problems. I am able to access widgets in the GUI from the main plugin thread as well. I understand that this practice is discouraged as not only per the answers I've received so far but also the Qt libs are spitting out some warning about unsafe access by another thread.</p>

<p>As of now I have only been working in a linux environment, perhaps real issues will be presented on other systems. I have seen only one glitch that I can not say for sure is related:</p>

<p>Upon changing the the max and min values of a progress bar widget, the progress bar appears blank. I was able to apply a simple fix to this by the following</p>

<pre><code>//here is me setting the values
window-&gt;progressBar-&gt;setMaximum(character.maxHP);
window-&gt;progressBar_2-&gt;setMaximum(character.maxMP);
window-&gt;progressBar-&gt;setValue(character.curHP);
window-&gt;progressBar_2-&gt;setValue(character.curMP);

//and here is the fix
window-&gt;progressBar-&gt;setVisible(false);
window-&gt;progressBar-&gt;setVisible(true);
window-&gt;progressBar_2-&gt;setVisible(false);
window-&gt;progressBar_2-&gt;setVisible(true);
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose my final question is 'What specifically are the situations where accessing a Qt GUI from an other thread is unsafe and why?'</p>

<p>With that handler i've got my resposes truncated by at least one byte. If I change <code>ChunkedStream</code> to <code>ChunkedNioFile</code> (and so use a <code>is.getChannel()</code> instead of <code>is</code> as a constructor to it) - everything works perfectly. </p>

There doesn't appear to be much in the way of documentation for module building with Alchemy, so I'm just going off of <a href=""http://guides.alchemy-cms.com/creating_modules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>. </p>

<p>I've created two controllers, one that admins will use called guestbook_controller.rb and placed this under app/controllers/admin</p>

<pre><code>module Admin
  class GuestbookController &lt; Alchemy::Admin::ResourcesController
    def index
      ""index""
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>and another for guest to access under app/controllers/guestbook_controller.rb</p>

<pre><code>class GuestbookController &lt; ActionController::Base
  def index
    ""index""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>My intention is that Guestbook posts will be displayed under one of the pages already within Alchemy and a form will also be displayed on this page. </p>

<p>The guestbook model looks this:</p>

<pre><code>class GuestbookEntry &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :location, :message, :name
end
</code></pre>

<p>My routes file looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>resources :guestbook

namespace :admin do
  resources :guestbook
end

mount Alchemy::Engine =&gt; '/'
</code></pre>

<p>and I have a file called authorization_rules.rb under config that looks like:
    authorization do</p>

<pre><code>  role :admin do
    has_permission_on :guestbook, :to =&gt; [:manage]
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>The first problem that I'm encountering is that going to the route /admin/guestbook gives me the error 'You are not Authorized', but the authorization rules file should be being called by my initalizer, so why am I getting this error?</p>

<pre><code># Registering guestbook module in Alchemy CMS
Alchemy::Modules.register_module(YAML.load_file(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../..', 'config/guestbook_module.yml')))

# Loading authorization rules and register them to auth engine instance

Following a code example, I've established a separate static Commands class to hold all of my commands, and it looks like this.</p>

{
    public static RoutedUICommand OpenDocument { get; set; }

            Commands.BindCommands(this);
        };
    }
}

<p><strong>ViewModel.cs</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class ViewModel
{
    private static ViewModel _current;
    public static ViewModel Current
    {
        get { return _current ?? (_current = new ViewModel()); }
        set { _current = value; }
    }

    public object SelectedItem { get; set; }

<p><strong>My problem</strong> is visible, when I first select a button and wait few seconds for its focus to disappear. Then I click on the track pad and while the button is pushed (verified that), you don't see anything at the screen - it doesn't turn blue or red.</p>

<p>I've tried all combinations of navigationClick() and trackwheelUnclick() but can not fix that.</p>

<p>Any help please?
Alex</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></p>

<p>I've tried the following, but it doesn't work well (focus disappears forever, probably because button thinks it is in the needed visual state already):</p>

<pre><code>    protected void onFocus(int direction) {
        if (_focusTimer != -1) {
            _app.cancelInvokeLater(_focusTimer);

        }            

        _focusTimer = _app.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                MyButton.this.setBorder(BorderFactory.createSimpleBorder(EDGES));
                MyButton.this.setBackground(BackgroundFactory.createSolidTransparentBackground(Color.GREEN, 0));

<p>My main issue I'm not sure how to handle is that I don't know the number of defects (i.e. COMPONENT MISSING, COMPONENT SKEWED, SOLDER BAD) per partnumber, how many defects (and what defects it has) will vary, therefore I can't just hard-code 'COMPONENT MISSING: [some calc]' into my foreach loop.... </p>

<p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p>Few more insights, I am not an Objective C person, however by debugging I found that “chooseContact"" method from ContactPicker.m is getting called as the overlay pops up, after that as the user selects contacts no other method from ContactPicker.m is getting called. But once I hit the Cancel button “peoplePickerNavigationControllerDidCancel"" method is getting called and it returns back to Phonegap App without any contactInfo. </p>

<p>Aggregate:</p>

<pre><code>[Camel (camel-3) thread #41 - Aggregating 1 - Waiting on 3 more items

[Camel (camel-3) thread #49 - Aggregating 3 - Waiting on 2 more items

<p>On my local machine the above works fine, but when we deploy to our test server half of the messages go to one camel aggregator, half to the other. causing none to ever finish. Notice in the config below that we've set concurrent consumers to 1 for camel. </p>

<p>Here's the camel / activemq config</p>

        &lt;/amq:transportConnectors&gt;
    &lt;/amq:broker&gt;

    &lt;!-- Basic AMQ connection factory --&gt;
    &lt;amq:connectionFactory id=""amqConnectionFactory"" brokerURL=""vm://localhost"" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Wraps the AMQ connection factory in Spring's caching (ie: pooled) factory
         From the AMQ ""Spring Support""-page: ""You can use the PooledConnectionFactory for efficient pooling... or you
         can use the Spring JMS CachingConnectionFactory to achieve the same effect.""
         See ""Consuming JMS from inside Spring"" at http://activemq.apache.org/spring-support.html
         Also see http://codedependents.com/2010/07/14/connectionfactories-and-caching-with-spring-and-activemq/

         Note: there are pros/cons to using Spring's caching factory vs Apache's PooledConnectionFactory; but, until
         we have more explicit reasons to favor one over the other, Spring's is less tightly-coupled to a specific
         AMQP-implementation.

<p>Is there any advantage to using</p>

<pre><code>using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(conStr))
{
     using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand())
     {
        // dostuff
     }

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(conStr))
{
     SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand();
     // dostuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously it does matter if you plan to run more than one command with the same connection, since closing an <code>SqlDataReader</code> is more efficient than closing and reopening a connection (calling <code>conn.Close();conn.Open();</code> will also free up the connection).</p>

<p>I see many people insist that failure to close the <code>SqlDataReader</code> means leaving open connection resources around, but doesn't that only apply if you don't close the connection?</p>

I started by trying to find if the said set is additive, ie. if the sum of every two elements of L is also an element of L.</p>

<p>I wrote the following:</p>

<p>This, naturally, produces all possible sums and, correctly, answers that the answer is true for all of them.</p>

I've also defined a setter/getter property for each column which encapsulates the logic for serializing and deserializing the JSON into python datastructures.</p>

<p>The nature of this data ensures that it will be accessed many times by view and template logic within a single Request.

<p>Where/How do I store the memo? I'm nervous about using instance variables, as I don't understand the magic behind how any particular UserProfile is instantiated by a query. Is <code>__init__</code> safe to use, or do I need to check the existence of the memo attribute via <code>hasattr()</code> at each read?</p>

<p>Here's an example of my current implementation:</p>

Looking at this previous posting <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8950122/how-do-i-apply-the-law-of-demeter-to-this"">How do I apply the Law of Demeter to this?</a> shows how heavy handed this can become if you did this for every association.</p>

<p>How common of a practice is this in rails? My thought is that even if this is technically the right thing to do, if it isn't a part of the rails culture then it seems that doing this will throw people off. And, more importantly, actually make the code less maintainable as other developers think you're wasting your time with all these helper methods.</p>

<p>Let's say I wanted to impliment this, would @period_registration.event.city, where city is an attribute of event, not a seperate object also violate LoD or would I need to write <em>ANOTHER</em> method so I could do: @period_registration.city</p>

<p>The shaders get compiled and attached to the shader program. The program is then linked and then used. The only reported active uniform variables by <a href=""https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glGetActiveUniform.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""glGetActiveUniform"">glGetActiveUniform</a> are the vertex shader's uniform vertexMvp and the fragment one's cTex. hTex is not recognized and querying for its location the result is -1. The GL_ARB_multitexture OpenGL extension is supported by the graphics card ( supports OpenGL version up to 4.3 ).</p>

<p>Tested the simple multitexturing example provided <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3569261/multiple-textures-in-glsl-only-one-works"">here</a> which has only fragment shader defined, using the stock vertex one. This example works like a charm.</p>

<ul>
<li>Normal</li>
<li>DropCreate</li>
<li>RestoreRun</li>
</ul>

<p>The first 2 are clear, but I don't understand <a href=""https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/wiki/RoundhousEModes"" rel=""nofollow"">RestoreRun Mode</a> and the benefit it offers in Production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Once you have gone to production, you switch from DropCreate to
  RestoreRun mode if your database is small enough</strong>. If not, you can
  continue with the idea of maintenance mode by switching to a new script
  name that you are making changes to. You can also backup the structure
  only (and some of the lookup data if you use a tool like LiteSpeed)
  and restore from that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was under the impression that RestoreRun would restore a backup of the database before running the migrations scripts. If this is the case, I could see it being useful in development where I am repeatedly testing my new scripts, but don't see the purpose of it for production.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I misunderstanding the purpose of RestoreRun?</li>
<li>What is an example scenario of how RestoreRun would benefit a production deployment?</li>
<li>Are there any other differences other than starting with a db restore between RestoreRun and Normal mode?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any insight into this would be much appreciated.</p>

<br>A few of this also works:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=""linktype[]""/&gt;

<p>What if I created a micro/small instance and hooked it to an elastic IP. I can then use that IP as my A record address for my website. That instance will forward 100% of its traffic to an ELB load balancer address (Haproxy?), which will then operate normally and forward that traffic to my server pool.</p>

<p>With this architecture I can use my A-record and an ELB. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are there any downsides to this aside from the cost of the initial instance that forwards its traffic to the ELB? </p></li>

<p>The first database has a dozen small tables (each having four or five INTEGER or TEXT columns).  Most of the tables have only a few dozen rows, but one table will have several thousand rows of ""Items.""  The tables are all related so they have many joins between them.</p>

<p>The second database contains only one table.  It has a BLOB column with one row related to some of the ""Items"" from the first database (photos of the items).  These BLOBs are only used in a small part of the program, so they are rarely attached or joined with the first database (rows can be fetched easily without joins).</p>

<p>The first database file size will be about a megabyte; the db with the BLOBs will be much larger -- about 50 megabytes.  I separated the BLOBs because I wanted to be able to backup the smaller database without having to carry the BLOBs, too.  I also thought separating the BLOBs might improve performance for the smaller tables, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of having two databases (SQLIte databases in particular ) to separate the BLOBs, vs. having just one database with a table full of very narrow tables mixed in with the table of BLOBs?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gRxVM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>--------------------WORK AROUND---------------------</strong></p>

<p>Get the current time using <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> and then pass it to <code>when()</code></p>

<pre><code>long curr_time = System.currentTimeMillis();

mBuilder.setWhen(curr_time);
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if this could be solved without a work around. :)</p>

  FileDrop Revamped - server-side upload handler sample

 ***

  This is an example of server-side script that handles both AJAX and IFrame uploads.

  AJAX upload provides raw file data as POST input while IFrame is a POST request
  with $_FILES member set.

  Result is either output as HTML with JavaScript code to invoke the callback
  (like JSONP) or in plain text if none is given (it's usually absent on AJAX).

ob_start();

// Callback name is passed if upload happens via iframe, not AJAX (FileAPI).

<p>My guess is that <code>myNamespace</code> is inherit for <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;anotherElement&gt;</code>. And <code>anotherNamespace</code> is a default namespace in <code>&lt;someElement&gt;</code> so in this element and for its child's overrides the other <code>myNamespace</code>. </p>

<p>I know that I can rewrite the above xml code like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;my:root xmlns:my=""myNamespace""&gt;
    &lt;a:someElement xmlns:a=""anotherNamespace""&gt;

<p>I cannot post any code since this is for work.  But I did find out a little bit more about the issue.  First there is no problem with the view or the controller, because the tab control, view and controller all worked together fine before I upgraded from Telerik to Kendo.  Second, the issue seems to be that the tab control is treating the partial view like a regular view, whenever a postback happens. </p>

<p>The code setup for this is real simple.  Kendo tab control and for each tab, I am using a partial view.  On each partial view is a submit button.  When I click the button, I get the error above.  Worked fine for Telerik control, does not work for Kendo.</p>

<p>Do I have the project setup incorrectly, or is there something else I should be looking into? (Unfortunately, I cannot post the code for proprietary reasons, but it is a very simple bit of code and easily follows the above example.)</p>

I have a time set to fire every 0.005 seconds that increases the height of both the ""block"" and the content height of the scroll view (so that the user can technically scroll infinitely). The problem is that whenever the user begins to scroll, this stops firing (i.e. the block stops getting taller). However, immediately when the user stops scrolling everything again works as it should. Here is all of the code that I have:</p>

self.mainScrollView.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];
self.mainScrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height * 10);
self.mainScrollView.scrollEnabled = YES;

self.darknessBlock.frame = CGRectMake(self.view.frame.origin.x,   self.view.frame.origin.y, self.view.frame.size.width, 100);
self.darknessBlock.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor];

[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.005 target:self selector:@selector(increaseDarknessHeight) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];

The purpose of the addon is a Firebase Authenticator for Ember Simple Auth. I've gotten the code working, but after packaging it up as an addon according to the Ember CLI documentation as well as a few tutorials, I'm running into some issues.</p>

<p>First, when I install the addon directly from a repo or from NPM, I get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>jamesdixon$ ember install ember-cli-simple-auth-firebase
version: 0.2.3
Installed packages for tooling via npm.

  cached git://github.com/firebase/firebase-bower.git#2.2.3
Installed browser packages via Bower.
installing
The ""ember generate"" command requires an entity name to be specified. For more details, use ""ember help"".
</code></pre>

<p>After the install, when looking at my application directory, I see that my addon has been installed under <code>npm_modules</code> and that the proper Bower packages have been installed under the <code>bower_components</code> directory. Unfortunately, none of the code under the <code>app</code> directory of my addon has been merged into the <code>app</code> directory of the project as is supposed to happen. I've been through the Ember CLI documentation a number of times in addition to reading through a few tutorials, but no luck. </p>

<p>The full source code can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/jamesdixon/ember-cli-simple-auth-firebase"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jamesdixon/ember-cli-simple-auth-firebase</a></p>

<p>Note that I'm running the latest version of Ember and Ember CLI: 0.11.1 and 0.2.3, respectively. </p>

<p>If there are any other details you need, please let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I have a table of <code>BillRecords</code>, which has a field <code>subscriberno</code> . In my django filters, i use a filtering query like:</p>

<pre><code>BillRecords.objects.filter(subscriberno__icontains='123456')
</code></pre>

<p>Since the <code>subscriberno</code> the customer said might be quite shortened version of the real number...</p>

<p>That filter outputs a query like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ""subscriberno"" FROM ""BillRecords"" WHERE UPPER(""subscriberno""::text) LIKE UPPER(E'%123456%');
</code></pre>

<p><code>subscriberno</code> is a char field because some numbers contains alphas and some special chars.</p>

<p>On my database, i have two indexes for that column, created by my colleagues.</p>

<pre><code>""BillRecords_subscriberno"" btree (subscriberno)
""BillRecords_fsubscriberno_like"" btree (subscriberno varchar_pattern_ops)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I am wondering</strong> using two indexes for a such query is logical. Since all of our django filter uses <code>icontains</code> and that supposed to be create queries like i write above. </p>

<p>Postgres analyse of the query is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Seq Scan on BillRecords  (cost=0.00..159782.40 rows=370 width=15) (actual time=579.637..3705.079 rows=10 loops=1)
Filter: (upper((subscriberno)::text) ~~ '%123456%'::text)
Total runtime: 3705.106 ms
(3 rows)
</code></pre>

<p>So, as far as i see, no index is used. Since index usega have costs in data insertion and update, having two indexes with no usage (as far as i can see from this analyse)  seemed me not logical.</p>

<p>Is there any channce for django to output different queries for a similar <code>icontanis</code> filter? Or my indexes are totally useless?</p>

Originally I was using GDI to resize the images (the originals take up far too much memory).  That was fine, except they were taking about 400ms per image.  Not so fine.  So in search of another solution I found a method that uses TransformedBitmap (which inherits from BitmapSource).  That's great, I thought, I can use that.  Except I'm now getting memory leaks somewhere...</p>

<p>I'm loading the images asynchronously using a BackgroundWorker like so:</p>

<pre><code>BitmapSource bs = ImageUtils.ResizeBitmapSource(ImageUtils.GetImageSource(photo.FullName));
                //BitmapSource bs = ImageUtils.GetImageSource(photo.FullName);
                bs.Freeze();

                this.dispatcher.Invoke(new Action(() =&gt; { photo.Source = bs; }));
</code></pre>

<p>GetImageSource just gets the Bitmap from the path and then converts to BitmapSource.</p>

<p>Here's the code snippet for ResizeBitmapSource:</p>

<pre><code>const int thumbnailSize = 200;
        int width;
        int height;

        if (bs.Width &gt; bs.Height)
        {
            width = thumbnailSize;
            height = (int)(bs.Height * thumbnailSize / bs.Width);
        }
        else
        {
            height = thumbnailSize;
            width = (int)(bs.Width * thumbnailSize / bs.Height);
        }

        BitmapSource tbBitmap = new TransformedBitmap(bs,
                                                           new ScaleTransform(width / bs.Width,
                                                                              height / bs.Height, 0, 0));

        return tbBitmap;
</code></pre>

<p>That code is essentially the code from:
<a href=""http://rongchaua.net/blog/c-wpf-fast-image-resize/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rongchaua.net/blog/c-wpf-fast-image-resize/</a></p>

This is rather trivial to do, but I was wondering if Swiper provided this capability?  Ideally each of the Swiper slides would have a classname and as the pagination is generated it could pull each slide's classname.  If you look at the JADE below, ideally I would be able to pull the classes 'serve', 'tithe', 'engage', 'practice', and 'share' from each slide and apply it to the respective pagination element.

I'm deploying it as a feature from inside some bundles, which I've built using a maven project. I'm using the 'javax.sound.sampled' library to get the audio, and I'm loading the file from the AudioSystem with 'java.io.File'. </p>

<pre><code>    val file = new File(""audioFile.wav"")
    val audioStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(file)
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously not the actual code, as I've stripped out all of the trivial bits. But this is where it fails, on the 'getAudioInputStream' call.</p>

<p>When I deploy this code to Karaf it fails with 'UnsupportedAudioFileException'. The file does exist, and is readable, I've already validated this. Also, I've made sure that this code can be run under the following.
  - Scala 2.10.2, 2.10.3
  - Java 1.7.0_45  ( This is the same JRE as my Karaf program is using )
  - SBT 0.12.4 ( With the different Scala versions )</p>

<p>The only place this fails is when I deploy it to Karaf. I don't know if Karaf has cut out some random audio support, or what is going on, because this otherwise works when deployed through SBT or using the Scala command line. I've also looked into alternative libraries, but to no avail. Most other solutions seem to be based around actually playing the audio through a sound driver, which is useless to me. I need the actual byte data. </p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that just sending the file over is also useless me. Another requirement is that I need to be able to be able to merge multiple audio files in to one seamless audio stream. I already have this done, I just need to port it to OSGi, and for some reason I am now getting this error. I don't know if Karaf has something to do with it, or if my building it through a Maven project has broken something. I've looked around, and have found very little hint as to where the problem might be. </p>

<p>The audio files I'm using are of Waveform audio. 8,000 sampling rate, 16 bits per sample. I don't think this would actually make a difference, but I'm no expert on audio formats. </p>

<p>My pom.xml dependencies are as follows. The only plugin I'm using is the Scala compiler, and of course my root pom.xml is using the org.apache.felix maven-bundle-plugin. There's really not much magic going on here, yet the mystery remains. </p>

<pre><code>    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.scala-lang&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;scala-library&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;2.10.3&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;

<p>That's absolutely perfect for my system, but this is not how it inserts into the query.</p>

<p>What I need to do is insert into my MySQL query, but whenever I do this I get an issue with values.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get the data from $can_view into a string which can be used on my MySQL code which isn't inside the foreach.</p>

"12253415","1","12253609","","2012-09-03 20:02:39","","4","5826","<p>In many flavors of SQL, there are three ways you can implicitly set a column to NULL on every row insertion. These are</p>

<pre><code>columnname type NULL
columnname type DEFAULT NULL
columnname type NULL DEFAULT NULL
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. the first one sets the NULL flag (as opposed to NOT NULL), second one leaves the NULL flag to the default value, and the third one sets the NULL flag and sets the implicit value as NULL.</p>

<p>I've heard about how in Microsoft SQL, the second variation is not exactly the same since you can also customize the default value of the NULL flag for tables or schemas.</p>

<p>But for MySQL, I don't believe there is such a feature. In addition, in MySQL, columns with the NULL flag, unlike NOT NULL columns, always are implicitly set to NULL on insert if there is no explicit value, even if strict mode is turned on. So that leaves all these column declarations identical.</p>

<p>In my MySQL script, for every NOT NULL column, I specify a DEFAULT value for columns I don't expect to set in some insertions in my application, to avoid any issues if I were to enable strict mode. Thus, I feel it would be more symmetrical if I were to choose the third variation, even though it is the most verbose and explicit. Are declarations like the third variation common, or does the first or second variation occur more frequently in others' scripts?</p>

<p>I was considering leaning to the second approach because that's the alias that MySQL dump uses, but I'm not sure that's such a good idea since it also dumps integer literals as strings (single quotes) in default clauses of column declarations.</p>

<p>This question may appear to be more opinion than one that has a solution, but I also want to be aware of any potential gotchas that I am not aware of. I may choose to migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL in the future, and I also could use some advice from those experts, e.g. if PostgreSQL distinguishes these cases like MS-SQL does. Correct me if I am wrong if I made any incorrect assumptions.</p>

<p>I have a fairly simple many-to-many relationship in my data model with Web 2.0 style ""Tags"".  Shifts have tags and users have tags.</p>

<p>I am pulling a shift from a cache.  When I try to make a copy of a shift, copying over the shift details and tags from the cached copy, I do the following (simplified).</p>

<pre><code>Data.Shift s = new Data.Shift();

/* copy over a bunch of stuff from the cached shift object. I'll spare the boring details */    

foreach (var t in shift.Tags) {  //shift object is a cached object

                Data.Tag dt = new Data.Tag
                {
                    TagID = t.TagID,
                    Name = t.Name,
                    OrgID = t.OrgID,
                };
                s.Tags.Add(dt);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Even though I have explicitly set the TagID in the new Data.Tag object, on SaveChanges() a new tag is inserted into the DB, rather than just creating a relationship on the Tag that already exists in the DB. TagID is a PK identity column </p>

<p>When I try the following code:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var t in shift.Tags){
   s.Tags.Add(t)
}
</code></pre>

<p>It obviously fails because the shift was cached from a different object context than the current requests' context. </p>

<p>Any thoughts?  As far as I can tell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clearing the cache is not an option for me because of performance concerns -- I recognize that this whole issue would go away if I did this work within the same object context.  </li>
<li>Also, pulling the Data.Tag from the DB in the current context is not an option because of perf concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>This seems like a really easy thing I am trying to do...</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Ok -- I've tried updating my code with both solutions but I am running into trouble with both.  Let's try the first one:</p>

<pre><code>// ctx is grabbed up here from HttpContext.Current.Items

 Data.Shift s = new Data.Shift();

 /* copy over a bunch of stuff from the cached shift object. I'll spare the boring details */    

foreach (var t in shift.Tags) {  //shift object is a cached object

            Data.Tag dt = new Data.Tag
            {
                TagID = t.TagID,
                Name = t.Name,
                OrgID = t.OrgID,
            };
            ObjectStateEntry entry;
            ctx.ObjectStateManager.TryGetObjectStateEntry(t.EntityKey, out entry);
            if (entry == null || entry.State == EntityState.Detached) { 
                    ctx.Tags.Attach(t);
            }
            s.Tags.Add(dt);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This is throwing the following error:</p>

<pre><code>  An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker.
</code></pre>

<p>I am guessing that the reason I am getting is this error, is because the shift object and its tags are pulled out of a cache (obviously from different contexts).  Thoughts?</p>

<p>Do you know how to get through that? In order to pass the newData instead data as argument to the super object.</p>

<p>To answer Bergi, as he asked I what _super() is calling. The instance.web.Model call a python script in server-side, I guess it is kind of Ajax call. But I test many case and I assume this instance.web.Model call is asynchronous. So that is the object I extend :</p>

<pre><code>instance.web.search.ExtendedSearchProposition = instance.web.Widget.extend(/** @lends instance.web.search.ExtendedSearchProposition# */{
template: 'SearchView.extended_search.proposition',
events: {
    'change .searchview_extended_prop_field': 'changed',
    'change .searchview_extended_prop_op': 'operator_changed',
    'click .searchview_extended_delete_prop': function (e) {
        e.stopPropagation();
        this.getParent().remove_proposition(this);
    }
},
/**

 *
 * @param parent
 * @param fields
 */
init: function (parent, fields) {
    this._super(parent);
    this.fields = _(fields).chain()
        .map(function(val, key) { return _.extend({}, val, {'name': key}); })
        .filter(function (field) { return !field.deprecated &amp;&amp; (field.store === void 0 || field.store || field.fnct_search); })
        .sortBy(function(field) {return field.string;})
        .value();
    this.attrs = {_: _, fields: this.fields, selected: null};
    this.value = null;
},
</code></pre>

<p>To go further (hope it will help you). Ok, let's see who are the superclass:</p>

<pre><code>instance.web.Widget = instance.web.Controller.extend({
// Backbone-ish API
tagName: 'div',
id: null,
className: null,
attributes: {},
events: {},
/**
 * The name of the QWeb template that will be used for rendering. Must be
 * redefined in subclasses or the default render() method can not be used.

template: null,
/**

 *
 * @constructs instance.web.Widget
 *
 * @param {instance.web.Widget} parent Binds the current instance to the given Widget instance.
 * When that widget is destroyed by calling destroy(), the current instance will be
 * destroyed too. Can be null.
 */
init: function(parent) {
    this._super(parent);
    // Bind on_/do_* methods to this
    // We might remove this automatic binding in the future
    for (var name in this) {
        if(typeof(this[name]) == ""function"") {
            if((/^on_|^do_/).test(name)) {
                this[name] = this[name].bind(this);
            }
        }
    }
    // FIXME: this should not be
    this.setElement(this._make_descriptive());
    this.session = instance.session;
},
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the next one:</p>

<pre><code>instance.web.Controller = instance.web.Class.extend(instance.web.PropertiesMixin, {
/**
 * Constructs the object and sets its parent if a parent is given.
 *
 * @param {instance.web.Controller} parent Binds the current instance to the given Controller instance.

 * destroyed too. Can be null.
 */
init: function(parent) {
    instance.web.PropertiesMixin.init.call(this);
    this.setParent(parent);
},
</code></pre>

<p>Then :</p>

<pre><code>instance.web.PropertiesMixin = _.extend({}, instance.web.EventDispatcherMixin, {
init: function() {
    instance.web.EventDispatcherMixin.init.call(this);
    this.__getterSetterInternalMap = {};
},
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>instance.web.EventDispatcherMixin = _.extend({}, instance.web.ParentedMixin, {
__eventDispatcherMixin: true,
init: function() {
    instance.web.ParentedMixin.init.call(this);
    this.__edispatcherEvents = new Events();
    this.__edispatcherRegisteredEvents = [];
},
</code></pre>

<p>Finally:</p>

<pre><code>instance.web.ParentedMixin = {
__parentedMixin : true,
init: function() {
    this.__parentedDestroyed = false;
    this.__parentedChildren = [];
    this.__parentedParent = null;
},
