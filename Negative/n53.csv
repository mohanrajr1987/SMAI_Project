"32741137","1","32745483","","2015-09-23 13:35:44","","0","15","<p>So I have RVM installed, put root and $account into the rvm group.</p>

<p>$account installs ruby 1.9.3-p551 into RVM and I set up RVM to enable</p>

<pre><code>rvm use 1.9.3
</code></pre>

<p>And then I check</p>

<pre><code>ruby -v
ruby 1.9.3-p551 (2014-11-13 revision 48407) [x86_64-freebsd10.1]
</code></pre>

<p>Which confirms that ruby has been changed from the system-wide 2.1 to the rvm-masked 1.9.3</p>

<p>The service I attempt to run is Snorby if that helps open any eyes, and so I start it with</p>

<pre><code>service snorby start
</code></pre>

<p>To which it replies</p>

<pre><code>ruby1.9.3-p551 is not installed.
To install do: 'rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p551'
ruby1.9.3-p551 is not installed.
To install do: 'rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p551'
ruby1.9.3-p551 is not installed.
ruby: ruby-1.9.3-p551 not available via rvm (exit code 1)
</code></pre>

<p>If I interpreted it right, ruby was the one that returned the last error which makes me think some script is either expecting ruby-1.9.3-p551 to be in an environment variable that it is not, or when I attempt to run a service script, it is run under a different user and therefore needs to be added to the rvm group.</p>

<p>To try and confirm, I ran grep in one of the directories that almost all involved files reside:</p>

<pre><code>grep -rnwl '/usr/local' -e ""is not installed""
</code></pre>

<p>Just to find the possible script that would be reading this error, almost all the ones returned were ruby or rvm related. I'm unsure where to go next with this as reinstalling 1.9.3 does not fix the issue and I do not want to modify configs haphazardly.</p>

<p>Addendum_1.1:</p>

<p>Upon further research the rest of Addendum_1 is misinformed, in the script $0 would resolve to the correct directory, therefore both accounts resolve properly to</p>

<pre><code>/correct/directory
</code></pre>

<p>I will italicize the remainder of Addendum_1 to leave it as background material.</p>

<p><em>I looked into the service script and realized that it attempts to read the .ruby-version in the wrong directory for the $account I have, on all other accounts the following code:</em></p>

<pre><code>echo $(cd $(dirname $0)/.. &amp;&amp; pwd)
</code></pre>

<p><em>results in:</em></p>

<pre><code>/correct/dir
</code></pre>

<p><em>But in $account the result is:</em></p>

<pre><code>/
</code></pre>

<p>Addendum_2:</p>

<p>Further research reveals that $? is being used to check exit codes and they are not lining up at all. When I test the exit code in $account by doing</p>

<pre><code>rvm use $version &gt;/dev/null; echo $?
</code></pre>

<p>It returns 0, which is that everything's fine.</p>

<p>When I edit the script though and force it to echo $? after it uses</p>

<pre><code>rvm use $dynamically_acquired_version &gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>It returns 1, which makes me suspect the script is being run as a different $account. I even checked if $version = $dynamically_acquired_version and they both are identical.</p>

<p>Addendum_3:</p>

<p>My suspicions are confirmed by injecting the following right at the beginning of the script:</p>

<pre><code>if [ -z ""$USER"" ]; then
  echo ""USER IS NULL""
fi
</code></pre>

<p>The user is changed, and in fact is not even defined, the way I have RVM installed is that only root and $account are in the rvm group. Hopefully things will clear up extremely soon.</p>

<p>I'll update this further when more results come up, if anyone happens upon this though feel free to throw me a bone while I'm digging.</p>

    self = [super initWithFrame:frame];
    if (self) {
        self.productImage = [[UIImageView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(5, 5, 100, 75)];
        self.labelName = [[UILabel alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 80, 100, 20)];
        self.labelName.font = [self.labelName.font fontWithSize:12];
        self.labelName.textAlignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;

        [self addSubview:self.productImage];
        [self addSubview:self.labelName];

        self.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:236.0f/255.0f green:236.0f/255.0f blue:236.0f/255.0f alpha:1.0];
        self.layer.masksToBounds = YES;
        self.layer.borderWidth = 1.0f;
        self.layer.cornerRadius = 10.0f;
        self.layer.borderColor= [[UIColor colorWithRed:207.0f/255.0f green:207.0f/255.0f blue:207.0f/255.0f alpha:1] CGColor];
    }
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the result is this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SnuPp.png"" alt=""Simulator view""></p>

<p>You can see that the text and the image aren't in center, how I can center them? Note the image may can have different size.

<p>My code was something like: </p>

<pre><code>var closed =['closed', 'closed', ..., 'closed'];
sunday = closed;
...
saturday = closed;
</code></pre>

<p>After this if i do:</p>

<pre><code>sunday[2] = 'open';
</code></pre>

<p>I get sunday[2] = 'open', monday[2] = 'open', tuesday[2] = 'open', ..., saturday[2] = 'open'. It's like all the variables were been 'glued' or linked because no mater which you change, all of them change in the same way.</p>

<p>I've fixed it in this way:</p>

<pre><code>var closed1 =['closed', 'closed', ..., 'closed'];
...
var closed7 =['closed', 'closed', ..., 'closed'];
sunday = closed1;
...
saturday = closed7;
</code></pre>

<p>And now I get independent variables. But I don't like this solution, so I'd be grateful if someone knows the problem.

        {""Smith"", ""Jones""}
    };
System.out.println(names[0][0] + names[1][0]);    // the output is ""Mr. Smith"";

<p>My example:</p>

<pre><code>public class User {
   private static String[][] users;
   private static int UC = 0;

   public void addUser (String email, String name, String pass) {
      int i = 0;

      // Here, when I define an array this way, it has no errors in NetBeans
      String[][] u = { {email, name, pass}, {""one@one.com"", ""jack sparrow"", ""12345""} };

      // But when I try to define like this, using static variable users declared above, NetBeans throws errors
      if (users == null) {
         users = { { email, name, pass }, {""one"", ""two"", ""three""} };    // NetBeans even doesn't recognize arguments 'email', 'name', 'pass' here. Why?

         // only this way works

<p><em>illegal start of expression,</em> </p>

<p><em>"";"" expected</em>, </p>

<p><em>not a statement</em>. </p>

<p>And also it doesn't recognize arguments <code>email</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>pass</code> in the definition of the <code>users</code> array. But recognizes them when I define <code>u</code> array.</p>

<p>I've already created a FrameworkElement that renders an individual element as a line (this line represents the transition between one element and the next, e.g. y(x) = x) and my intention is to use this element as part of the DataTemplate for my custom ItemsControl.  By flipping the odd elements horizontally and butting them together in a panel, it should be possible to see a continuous series of transitions between the elements.  I'm having difficulty in deciding how to implement this panel, in particular with filling 'dead space' that might occur at the start of the panel.</p>

<p>The collection of elements that I'm trying to draw represents a looping effect, but the first element may not start at time T=0.  Because the effect loops back on itself this means that the gap between T=0 and the first effect's start time is actually made up of the final part of the last element in the collection.  This means I have to find a way of chopping up the last visual element in the panel so that the front part sits at the end of the panel and the back part sits at the start.</p>

<p>Another way to think of this is in terms of a circle/pie chart - if element A starts at 15% and element B starts at 50%, element B would occupy the regions 50-100% and 0%-15% continuously.</p>

<p>I'm really looking for a way to get this done in WPF visually rather than by modifying the collection of items (e.g. by adding a fake 'padding' element between 0 and the first element) as this would create complications down the line when it comes to things like modifying/selecting items, etc.</p>

<p>Someone has suggested drawing this as a 0-1 effect (removing any offset on the first element if there is one) then recreating the offset using a pair of cameras/viewports, which is something I'm not familiar with and seems a bit overkill.  Can anyone suggest a simpler or more elegant way?</p>

<p>Before it's said, I know TFS provides build capability, but we are trying to standardize on build infrastructure and the first step is having all projects built through the same web services (Jenkins in this case).</p>

<p>I need to install TFS to the build server, so I downloaded the TeamExplorer client, an ISO just under 400Mb in size. When I tried installing from the ISO, it doesn't offer optional install components, and comes up with a large list of components it will install (most will never be used on this server, AFAIK).</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Shell (integrated mode)</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Microsoft Office system (version 3.0 Runtime)</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Tools for the 2007 Microsoft Office System Runtime</li>
<li>Microsoft Document Explorer 2008</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Team Explorer</li>
<li>Microsoft Office System 2003 Primary Interop Assemblies</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems very much overkill to install the full Visual Studio UI, and all attendant stuff as I will only ever be calling the CLI TFS client. Is that all necessary for the CLI utility?</p>

<p>Is it possible to get just the assemblies required for command line TFS? Or is it possible to install only the CLI from the ISO? </p>

<p>I know there is a similar question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5503858/how-to-get-tf-exe-tfs-command-line-client"">here</a>, with a list of the minimum files to copy for a working command line TFS in ijprest's answer, but I don't want to install a hack.  I'd prefer a supported install that won't cause confusion in the future.</p>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong></p>

<p>Based on a couple of answers that came in, I'll explain the environment and reasoning.</p>

<p>The build server itself is a Windows 2008 server, but I can't build through TFS, because we are trying to create a unified CI system that will handle multiple projects. </p>

<p>Some projects are .NET, some Java. Some are hosted (SCM) on Subversion, some on ClearCase. This new project is hosted on TFS (so far 1 project out of 6), so TFS is in the minority here.</p>

<p>Politically, we cannot mandate that projects use a single set of tools. However, we're hoping that having a single build point will gently push projects into a more uniform approach (or at least push project leadership into 'talking' to each other <em>before</em> purchasing new tools/frameworks/etc.</p>

<p>So, the build server will need to be able to pull source from SCM onto a 'build' area, then perform the build (through Ant, Maven, NAnt, MSBuild, Grdle, whatever), but the important things are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The build is kicked off automatically based upon source changes (based upon polling the SCM)</li>
<li>The build system will pull the source from SCM with <em>no human interaction</em>.</li>
<li>The build will occur via convention, OR (at least) via SCM based scripts (build.xml, makefiles, etc.). The important thing is <em>again</em> no human interaction.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""http://intra.gchss.edu.mt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intra.gchss.edu.mt</a></p>

<p>The scripts aren't accessible even if they are physically present. Tomcat reports HTTP Status 404 - The requested resource (/scripts/javascript/script.js) is not available.</p>

<p>In my attempts I also tried creating several other applications and tweaked contents.xml to stop tomcat caching:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Context cachingAllowed=""false"" cacheMaxSize=""0"" cacheTTL=""1""&gt;
    &lt;WatchedResource&gt;WEB-INF/web.xml&lt;/WatchedResource&gt;

<p>But they all behave in the same way. (I know it's irrelevant with new applications but I tried it anyway)</p>

<p>I checked the directory and the files permissions and they're 777 so they should be accessible and runnable by anyone. But still I can't access them. </p>

<p>There are two things I haven't tried yet and wouldn't want to try</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-installing tomcat</li>
<li>Put the scripts in the main directory.</li>

<p>Any thoughts? I'm running tomcat 5.5 on Debian.</p>

<p>1: Is there any way to display a month even if there are no records to be summarized in that month? i.e. no orders for March, but want to display Jan, Feb, Mar.? I'm pretty sure I can create a dates table and use that spoof it, but don't want to go that route as the database is part of a Vendor's package and I don't want to get to crazy in there.</p>

<p>2: Is there a way of specifying or limiting how many columns go across? For example in a forecast cross tab I only owant current month and the next six months to show up. I suppose I can do a date range on the selection criteria, but that seems a bit kludgy to me.</p>

temp-&gt;next = NULL;

<pre><code>struct node {

<p>I am getting confused on how to have an array of node pointers. I notice they tend to look like this: node **next and then declared to have memory allocated dynamically. I just want my arrays to be of size 4. So [3].</p>

<p>My problem is how can I create new nodes with the array of node pointers in main() and put something in the first slot of the nodes array? </p>

<p>This does not work for putting things in the array but it does work for putting in the number.</p>

<pre><code>void insertAsFirstElement(node *&amp;head, node *&amp;tail, int number){

node *temp = new node; 
temp-&gt;number = number;
cout&lt;&lt;temp-&gt;number&lt;&lt;endl;
temp-&gt;next[0] = tail; 
cout&lt;&lt;temp-&gt;next[0]&lt;&lt;endl;
head-&gt;next[0] = temp;
cout&lt;&lt;head-&gt;next[0]&lt;&lt;endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please help me. </p>

This is to run every hour depending on an input CSV file being present. The application also needs to be reused for other database imports on the same server, e.g. there could be up to 20 instances of the same .exe file with each instance having their own separate configuration.</p>

<p>At the moment I have the base application which passes a location of config file via args, so it can be tweaked depending on which application needs to use it. It also undertakes the import via a transaction, which all works fine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>newly logged in users are correctly remembered, as you can verify by
  logging in, closing the browser, and checking that you’re still logged
  in when you restart the sample application and revisit the sample
  application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when I go through these steps I'm not logged in i.e: I can log in but when I restart the browser and revisit the app I'm not logged in as it is supposed to be.(I'm using localhost:3000)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want, you can even inspect the browser cookies to see the
  result directly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one, however, works. I can verify that the cookie is saved successfully.</p>

<p>I have gone through this chapter several times, making sure that I'm following the exact same steps but still no luck.</p>

<p>Also the test is <strong>not red</strong>, I can logout at any time. I really don't know what to do. I have been trying several things but no luck. Excuse me if this is  a simple question as I'm new to rails.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> you can view the chapter here: <a href=""https://www.railstutorial.org/book/log_in_log_out#sec-remember_me"" rel=""nofollow"">Rails tutorial 3</a></p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/serial.fscanf.html?searchHighlight=serial%20fscanf"" rel=""nofollow"">the documentation</a> for serial fscanf, assuming I interpreted it correctly, the format 
A = fscanf(obj,'format',size) reads the number of values specified by size. 
so, I have </p>

fprintf(handles.s,'%s','M0');
disp('M0 was sent');

for j = 1:6
    while (handles.s.BytesAvailable == 0)

    disp('pausing');
    pause(0.1);
    disp('stopped pausing');
    CurrentInput = fscanf(handles.s,'%c', 1 );
if CurrentInput == ' ' 
    disp('pausing');
    pause(0.1);
    disp('stopped pausing');
    databit = fscanf(handles.s,'%i',5);% reads four bytes and stores it as an integer
    disp(databit);

<p>Which does what I want it to , but I don't understand why.</p>

<p>Now, I initially tested with  </p>

<pre><code>databit = fscanf(handles.s,'%i',4);% reads four bytes and stores it as an integer
</code></pre>

<p>Because I thought it would read 4 bytes (32 bits) and convert that as a long int. but realised soon enough the function had a will of its own and was reading digits or something...</p>

<p>Then how can I read a specified number of bytes (4) from the input buffer and convert them to an long int (32bits)?</p>

<p>Here is the snipet of arduino code that is relevent, for your interest. Essentially, we are reading coefficients from the register of 2 sensors through I2C. Then converting the bytes as long integers that are sent over serial to matlab.</p>

////////Notes:

  // Keep looping until reaching the point in time where if you do the next conversion 
  // you will exceed the specified wait time

We have tried the <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/tess4j/discussion/1202294/thread/8393fd13/"" rel=""nofollow"">LC_NUMERIC</a> solution but still doesn't work.</p>

<p>Our Tesseract java code is something like this</p>

<pre><code>File file; // ...
boolean hOcr; // ...
Rectangle rec; // ...
OcrResult result;
//Tesseract instance = Tesseract.getInstance();
Tesseract1 instance = new Tesseract1();

    } else {

<p>The whole point of me using S3 is to lighten my EC2 server loads. 
However, it seems using this method to download the files it pulling the files from S3 via the EC2 server (monitoring the server loads via iStat shows me an increase in activity when downloading a file).</p>

<p>Is there an alternative way of doing this so the file is downloaded directly from S3 rather than via the EC2 server??</p>

<p>I have implemented matrix multiplication in C++, Java (both in naive way), and OpenCV to do the computation.</p>

<p>As you can see in the chart, it took me 56460 ms, nearly one minute, to do the multiplication of two 1000*1000 matrices. By the way, I'm using LG G2 to do the computation.</p>

<p>It is way more slower than the performance on a PC or so on. I know the computation on mobile phones should be slower than other machines, but I believe the difference shouldn't be that much.</p>

<p>I would like to know if my performance is normal (as a mobile phone). If not, is there any way that I can improve it?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

I know how to get the URL of the current page by either using <code>document.location.href</code> or <code>document.URL</code>. They both work fine, however when a PDF page is loaded those calls do not work.</p>

<p>I am inserting a content script through <code>page-mod</code>. The code is the following:</p>

pageMod.PageMod({

<p>So I am guessing that you cannot insert a content script into a PDF page. What alternatives do I have to detect when a user is inside a PDF page?</p>

<p>In Chrome I am able to do this by assigning a background page. Is there a similar way to do this with the Add-on SDK? I looked at <code>page-worker</code> but I couldn't find anything there either since it is just an invisible page and not a background page. </p>

<p>I've tried unregistering and running the win32 app. which references the DLLS; I expected to receive a run-time error but the application once again hung at the CreateComObject call.</p>

<p>I've also tried unregistering and registering the dll without any luck.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Basically, we just want to copy a file using xcopy command.</p>

<p>For instance, we do:</p>

<pre><code>xcopy ""C:/my/path/myfile.test"" ""C:/my/path/mynewfile.test*"" =&gt; Does not work. Windows needs backslash
xcopy ""C:\my\path\myfile.test"" ""C:/my/path/mynewfile.test*"" =&gt; Does not work. We need to escape backslash
xcopy ""C:\\my\\path\\myfile.test"" ""C:/my/path/mynewfile.test*"" =&gt; Works...
</code></pre>

<p>So I have some issues. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why does the source parameter of xcopy need backslash while the
destination parameter works with slash?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm using the <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options"" rel=""nofollow"">spawn function of the child process module</a>. It seems this does not escape anything. I tried to look though the code of nodejs but well... that's not easy! Does the spawn function escape the command?</p></li>
<li><p>If we do need to escape the command ourselves, then we also want to execute our commands on UNIX. So I presume the escaping method is not the same. And I would not prefer to make a </p>

     escapeshellargWindow(arg)
  else if(unix)

The thing we achieved till now is I can send byte array to him in another thread and receive byte array in service. But the problem that we face is that I can't read the whole message which he is sending to if he don't close the socket. But I need that socket alive, so I can send him response if the data was ok or there were some problems. Here is how I am listening about his messages :</p>

<pre><code>thread =  new Thread(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            try {

                        Log.d("""",""ipadress : ""+client.getInetAddress().toString());

                        InputStream is = client.getInputStream();

                        Log.d("""",""is Size : ""+is.available());

                        byte[] bytes = toByteArray(is);
                        for(int i=0;i&lt;bytes.length;i++){
                            Log.d("""",""bytes[""+i+""] : ""+bytes[i]);
                        }

                 }

                  serverSocket.close();
                  Log.d("""",""client socket : ""+client.isClosed() + "" serverSocket : ""+serverSocket.isClosed());

             } catch (UnknownHostException e) {

        }
    });
    thread.start();

<p>So if he don't close the application or don't close the socket, I am sitting on that log message : <code>Log.d("""",""is Size : ""+is.available());</code> and nothing really happens. After he close the socket I can see the bytes of received byte array.</p>

<p>But the problem is I need the session progress to be represented on the screen. I plan to have a UIToolBar at the bottom of the main menu which I don't want to cover with the progress bar but cover the UIView above it.So the way I see it I could do it a few different ways. </p>

<p>1) Have the App Delegate establish the sessions and report the progress to the main menu class so it can represent it in the progress bar (will I have any issues doing this if the sessions are created in a separate thread?), </p>

<p>2) have the App delegate display the main menu (UIView with a bunch of buttons and UIToolBar) and have it track and display the progress (I have never displayed anything in the App Delegate but assume you can do this but its not recommended) or</p>

<p>3) have the App Delegate just push the main menu and have the mainMenu class create the sessions and display the progress bar.</p>

<p>4) I think the other way to do it is to create the sessions in a delegate class and have the delegate set to mainMenu rather than self (AppDelegate), although I've never used anything other then self so not sure if this will work or if I will be able to close the thread (through calling super maybe?) as its running in the AppDelegate rather than the delegate of the class. </p>

<p>As I've kinda said before the sessions are being created in a class in a separate thread so it wont lock the UI and I think the best way is the first but am I going to have issues having it running in a separate thread, reporting back to the app delegate and then sending that message to the mainMenu view?</p>

<p>I hope that all makes sense, let me know if you need any further clarification. Any information is appreciated </p>

<p>It seems the CFCHART tag accepts pixel dimensions for height and width, and that I need to be able to dynamically resize the chart based on the dimensions of the browser window. I'd prefer the object to remain in flash but I can change it to a JPEG or PNG if needed.</p>

<p>How would I easily get these dimensions and change them with Javascript? is there another easy method?
What would I do on a window resize?</p>

<p>I have, on my custom lib, for user attributes something like this:</p>

<p><code>auth_users</code> table to know the ""user_ids"":</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `auth_users` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `attribute` text NOT NULL,
  `value` text NOT NULL
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

<p>So whenever i want an user by user_id, my custom lib returns <code>$system-&gt;auth-&gt;user-&gt;get(1)</code> into:</p>

<pre><code>Array(
    'fullname' =&gt; 'José Moreira',
    'username' =&gt; 'Cuss',

<p>If i want to save user i have two methods, save an entire array <code>$system-&gt;auth-&gt;user-&gt;save(user_id,user_attributes_array)</code> or by attribute <code>$system-&gt;auth-&gt;user-&gt;put(user_id, user_attribute, user_attribute_value)</code></p>

<p>first subitem is  : the index number of the item</p>

<p>second subitem is : A description for the item</p>

<p>last subitem is   : A directory path</p>

<p>Example:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y2wXO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Just before adding a new item I try to search if the listview already contains the third subitem (the directory path) with a function I've made:</p>

<pre><code>' Find ListView Text
Private Function Find_ListView_Text(ByVal ListView As ListView, ByVal Text As String) As Boolean
    Try : Return Convert.ToBoolean(ListView.FindItemWithText(Text)) : Catch : Return True : End Try
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>...Now, the problem is for example if I first add in the listview a Item wich contains the directory <strong>""C:\electro""</strong> as the third subitem like seen in the image, then later I can't add a new item with a <strong>""C:\""</strong> directory because my function is not searching for a full text, my function founds ""C:\Electro"" when I search for ""C:\"", it searchs for a piece of text and I need the otherwise.</p>

<p>Then I need to improve the function to search inside a listview for a full text, not for a piece of text.</p>

<p>Last example:</p>

<p>If I have an item in the listview with the string ""C:\Electro"" and I search if exist ""C:\"" in the listviews items, the desired result is ""FALSE"" (Not exists the directory C:\, is C:\Electro)</p>

<p>Now, I have a subset of user IDs <strong><em>smallUserIDList</em></strong> and a subset of item IDs <strong><em>smallItemIDList</em></strong>, then I want to find the rows in A that rated by users in <strong><em>smallUserIDList</em></strong>, and collect the items that user rated, and do some calculations, such as setdiff with <strong><em>smallItemIDList</em></strong> and count the result, as the following code does:</p>

<pre><code>userStat = zeros(length(smallUserIDList), 1);
for i = 1:length(smallUserIDList)

When I click on the button I should get some data from USB device.
For some reason it works correctly only about 2% (I was able to get 2 correct responses out of 100 clicks).
Here is the code for the Form1:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Test_onForm1
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            Lib1.FindHID.TransferInputAndOutputReports(0xC0); //request specific data from USB device
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code handling USB communication is in DLL Lib1 (fragments of the code below):</p>

<pre><code>namespace Lib1
{      
    public static class FindHID
    {
    private static void TransferInputAndOutputReports(UInt16 repType)
    {
        //some code here sending request to USB device... and then read what came from USB
        ReadInput();
        //some code here                
    }    

    //  Read an Input report.
        private static void ReadInput()
       {
           Byte[] inputReportBuffer = null;
           inputReportBuffer = new Byte[MyHid.Capabilities.InputReportByteLength];
         IAsyncResult ar = null;

          if (fileStreamDeviceData.CanRead)
         {
        // RUNS UP TO THIS POINT and then Form1 freezes most of the time
              fileStreamDeviceData.BeginRead(inputReportBuffer, 0, inputReportBuffer.Length, new AsyncCallback(GetInputReportData), inputReportBuffer);                 
           }
       }

    private static void GetInputReportData(IAsyncResult ar) 
      {
        // RARELY GETS HERE
                Byte[] inputReportBuffer = null;
                inputReportBuffer = (byte[])ar.AsyncState;              

   fileStremDeviceData.EndRead(ar); //waits for read to complete
        // then code to update Form1 
     }      
    }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When it doesn't work it stops around fileStreamDeviceData.BeginRead and then Form1 freezes.</p>

<p>For testing I created a completely new project and instead of using a DLL I copied all DLL code to the Form1.
This option works perfectly fine 100% of the time.
So my question is why it doesn't work with DLL?</p>

<p>Update: when I get lucky and it start working then it works indefinitely until I close application. Then, I have to keep trying to get it to work again.
How to troubleshoot this problem?       </p>

<p>I understand that if you are going to call <code>restoreCompletedTransactions</code> there is a question about whether it should be called automatically or manually when the user presses a button (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1757467/when-to-use-restorecompletedtransactions-for-in-app-purchases"">here</a> for instance).</p>

<p>My question is whether it's necessary to call <code>restoreCompletedTransactions</code> at all. If my app has only one or two things to sell/unlock, it seems acceptable to let the user go through the standard purchase UI, as long as there's a note explaining that the user won't be charged again if purchasing something they've already purchased. So, say the user installs my game on a new device. On their old device they already purchased/unlocked Level X. When they get to Level X on the new device, it asks if they want to purchase it (explaining that they won't be charged twice if they purchased it previously), and they say yes, and they now have Level X on their new device, and they were only charged once (when they purchased it on their old device).</p>

<p>Is that a kosher way to handle it, as far as Apple approval is concerned? I can see how, if they had purchased 100 individual items it would be nice to give them a way to restore them all at once. But if it's just one or two unlocks for the whole app, is my no-<code>restoreCompletedTransactions</code> approach acceptable?</p>

<p>I declined this invitation, but shortly after doing so, the login stopped working. If I open the Java console and try to call the Applet from Firebug I see the following messages:</p>

<pre><code>security: LiveConnect (JavaScript) blocked due to security settings.
network: Created version ID: 1.7.0.45
network: Created version ID: 1.7.0.51
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems I'm trapped in some purgatory between the two versions. My is guess that either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the partial installation of 1.7.0.51 changed some security settings which are preventing me from calling the applet (from JavaScript)</li>
<li>I can't call the applet because the old version is blocked and I have to upgrade to the newer version</li>
</ul>

<p>If possible, I'd like to go back to version 1.7.0.45, and my previous security settings, because I know this configuration worked. If this is not possible, then I guess I'll try to upgrade to 1.7.0.51. I checked in the Java control panel for a way to upgrade, but there doesn't seem to be any ""check for updates now"" button.

<p><a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagejpeg.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagejpeg.php</a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// Create a blank image and add some text
$im = imagecreatetruecolor(120, 20);
$text_color = imagecolorallocate($im, 233, 14, 91);
imagestring($im, 1, 5, 5,  'A Simple Text String', $text_color);

// Set the content type header - in this case image/jpeg
header('Content-Type: image/jpeg');

// Output the image
imagejpeg($im);

// Free up memory
imagedestroy($im);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I put this into ""export.php"" and link to it, I get the image as expected. I want this to be a download though, so that the user clicks the link and the image downloads rather than appears in their browser. <em>Allegedly</em> the way to do this is with the content-disposition tag, like so;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// Create a blank image and add some text
$im = imagecreatetruecolor(120, 20);
$text_color = imagecolorallocate($im, 233, 14, 91);
imagestring($im, 1, 5, 5,  'A Simple Text String', $text_color);

// Set the content type header - in this case image/jpeg
header('Content-Type: image/jpeg');

//This is literally the only line I have added
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""foo.jpg""');    

// Output the image
imagejpeg($im);

// Free up memory
imagedestroy($im);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And now the image no longer displays (as expected) and all works in all browsers EXCEPT chrome, which now ""cancels"" the image download when it's done downloading (according to dev tools) - also complains that <code>Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type image/jpeg</code> in the console. </p>

<p>I have tried every response header under the sun, what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>response headers:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> Cache-Control:max-age=0
 Connection:Keep-Alive
 Content-Disposition:attachment; filename=""foo.jpg""
 Content-Length:1302
 Content-Type:image/jpeg

<p>So I was wondering if anyone can tell me how to iterate through each of the 3 images on the same co-ordinate, so for example read 1, 1 of each image and record the red, green and blue value accordingly. Apologies if it doesnt make complete sense, its a bit hard to explain. I can iterate the values for one image fine but when I add in another, things start to go a bit wrong as obviously its quite a bit more complicated! I was thinking it might be easier to create an array and replace the according values in that just not sure how to do that effectively either.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>How can i make a proper request in the create method, obtain a token as a response and store it so am able to to use it in the success method to search for the particular transaction.</p>

<p>Also, how can i then execute a proper <code>DoExpressCheckoutPayment</code> in the success method.</p>

<p>I am not an expert in Linux based development. This is the first time I am trying to work on something to interface between JavaScript and C++ code.</p>

<p>The C++ code basically resides in the .so files ( dynamic libraries) that would provide interface methods to access certain hardware and file system. The GUI needs to be in HTML and I am searching for different solutions that are possible that can call C++ from HTML. I searched and ended up deciding to try 2 approaches, both using the WebKit engine.</p>

<p><strong>Approach 1: Using Qt 5.0.2 Webkit Bridge - the WebView control</strong><br>
The GUI framework will be on Qt framework, the main application window will contain a webview control that would run an HTML code which in turn contains the JavaScript code.<br>
The interface between Web page and C++ is done using the addToJavaScriptWindowObject() function. </p>

<p>I created a sample application and tested this solution and it seems to works fine.</p>

<p><strong>Approach 2: Using GTK+ WebKit WebView</strong><br>
I downloaded and installed the GTK 3.0 library.<br>
I got the webkitgtk 2.0.1 and have installed it.<br>
I have created a test application with GTK without webkit, it works well.<br>
I am trying to create a webkit webview control using GTK.  </p>

<p>When trying my Approach 1 with Qt, there was quite a good set of documentation and samples to do what I wanted to. But after starting with Approach 2 using GTK+, I feel am moving slower comparitively. I personally feel that the documentation part is not that straight forward for the kind of application I am trying to develop.</p>

<p><strong>Other Approaches:</strong><br>
I also want to try to check if either using Applets (to call the .so files directly) or using the V8 JavaScript engine to interface between JavaScript and C++ are viable options(<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/v8/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/v8/</a>)</p>

<p>I have tried the following resources:<br>
<a href=""http://webkitgtk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webkitgtk.org/</a><br>
<a href=""http://www.webkit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webkit.org/</a><br>
<a href=""https://live.gnome.org/WebKitGtk/ProgrammingGuide/Tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">https://live.gnome.org/WebKitGtk/ProgrammingGuide/Tutorial</a>  </p>

<p>I want to know how exactly to do this interface part of calling a C++ functions (in .so files) when a button is clicked in a HTML web page containing JavaScript. What kind of signal am I supposed to look for. If I am using a WebkitWebview control, how do I map a button click to a c++ function?</p>

<p>Can someone point me to the right direction?</p>

<p>I would really appreciate your time and knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As per tom's question below, magic quotes is/was indeed turned off.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> What I have ended up doing to solve the problem is the following:</p>

<p>After collecting the data for each individual item/post/etc, I store that data to an array that I use later for output, then clear the local variables used during collection. I added in a step that checks if data is already present, and if it is, I concatenate it to the end, rather than overwriting it.</p>

<p>So, if I end up with three chunks (as above, let's stick with 'Get Wired, You're Hired!', I will then go from doing</p>

<pre><code>$x = 'Get Wired, You'
$x = ""'""
$x = 're Hired!'
</code></pre>

<p>To doing:</p>

<pre><code>$x = 'Get Wired, You' . ""'"" . 're Hired!'
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't the optimal solution, but appears to be working.</p>

In order to do so, I need to be able to post raw JSON, but I haven't seemed to find a way to do that.

however there is a sub-question why the compiler diagnoses a warning in one case and an error in the other case ,with the exact same expression.</p>

<p>I really like the use of the <code>auto</code> 'type' as in <code>auto var =</code>..., but MSVC 2015 CTP gives an error from my code.</p>

<p>The issue is I am <code>auto</code>-ing an expression of type <code>short</code> but sometimes it's promoted to <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>Here's a MCVE:</p>

<pre><code>struct MY_COORD { short X; short Y; };
using t_crd = MY_COORD; 

void call_test ( t_crd x )  {}

int main()
{
    t_crd    crd { 10 ,20 };

    auto     x5 = crd.X - crd.Y;
    auto     y5 = crd.Y - crd.X;
    t_crd    crd5 { x5 ,y5 };       // (1)
    call_test( t_crd{ x5 ,y5 } );   // (2)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The messages from lines (1) and (2) are respectively:</p>

<pre><code> warning C4838: conversion from 'int' to 'short' requires a narrowing conversion
 error C2397: conversion from 'int' to 'short' requires a narrowing conversion
</code></pre>

<p>I thought this code was OK but it's not according to MSVC 2015 CTP compiler (but Intellisense doesn't indicate it).
Is there some obscure little rule that I missed that makes MSVC right ?</p>

<p>And if so why is the same expression a <strong>warning</strong> in one case and an <strong>error</strong> in the other case ?</p>

<p>I wanted to use it in the initialization of a loop variable like this:</p>

<pre><code>MY_COORD pos = ResultFromFunction();
auto rows = pos.Y;
for ( auto i = (rows - rows); i &lt; rows; ++i )
{
   coord c{ 0 ,i };
   ...

<p>EDIT: when using MYSQL, they seem to  come out correct, but not when pasted into the html itself or echoed out</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>I ran this in phpmyadmin: ""mysqldump -h localhost -u root -p  --opt --quote-names \
    --skip-set-charset --default-character-set=latin1 general > general-dump.sql
""</p>

<p>The error was: ""#1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'mysqldump -h localhost -u root -p --opt --quote-names \ --skip-set-charset' at line 1""</p>

<p>EDIT 3:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=""content-type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" /&gt;
&lt;?php       
$connection = mysql_connect('localhost','root','');
$select = mysql_select_db('general',$connection);
$result = mysql_query('SELECT name FROM exchange WHERE `id`= 192');
$results = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
echo $results['name'];

<p>Considering the code above, if the user clicks on one of the main-level checkboxes (ie, Item 1 or Item 2), how would I go about toggling all checkboxes in the neighboring list with the <code>sublist</code> class value? I don't want to use any other class or id values because I'll have several types of sublists that need to be toggled independently; I don't want to duplicate chunks of code for each set of class/id values.</p>

"16512272","1","","","2013-05-12 21:34:21","","2","513","<p>I have just created a customized VirtualPathProvider for my ASP.NET web application. It basically maps all virtual files in ""~/Storage"" and subdirectories to a directory other than the solution's directory.</p>

<h3>Code essentials</h3>

<pre><code>    private bool IsPathVirtual(string virtualPath)
    {
        String checkPath = VirtualPathUtility.ToAppRelative(virtualPath);
        return checkPath.StartsWith(VirtualRootPath, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase);
    }

    public override bool DirectoryExists(string virtualDir)
    {
        return IsPathVirtual(virtualDir) ? ((FileSystemVirtualDirectory)GetDirectory(virtualDir)).Exists() : Previous.DirectoryExists(virtualDir);
    }

    public override bool FileExists(string virtualPath)
    {
        return IsPathVirtual(virtualPath) ? ((FileSystemVirtualFile)GetFile(virtualPath)).Exists() : Previous.FileExists(virtualPath);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In my case <code>VirtualRootPath = ""~/Storage""</code>, but that it configurable.</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>In IIS Express, when I debug via Visual Studio, the two public methods, required to resolve a virtual path, are not always called.</p>

<ul>
<li>Calling <code>http://localhost:7749/Storage</code> triggers breakpoints on both methods. A 404 error is returned and desired. This is a correct behaviour to me</li>
<li>Calling <code>http://localhost:7749/Storage/ExistingFile.txt</code> doesn't trigger debug, and a different 404 error is returned. This is not correct</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between the two 404 errors is that when I call for the directory, it's ASP.NET responding (<code>Server error in application '/'</code>) but when I call for the file inside that directory, it's IIS 8.0 responding (<code>HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found</code>).</p>

<h3>The question</h3>

<p>Why, even if I correctly registered the <code>VirtualPathProvider</code> in my <code>HostingEnvironment</code>, doesn't IIS 8.0 let ASP.NET pipeline handle the HTTP request so it could be resolved correctly?</p>

<h3>The workaround</h3>

<p>After reading <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8163058/virtualpathprovider-doesnt-quite-work-in-production-on-iis-7-5"">VirtualPathProvider doesn&#39;t (quite) work in production on IIS 7.5</a> I realized it could be a <code>Web.config</code> problem. Judging from the other question, it <em>looks like</em> that IIS handles certain file extensions independently, no matter if ASP.NET maps those to a virtual resource, a controller, or anything else. So, since I was trying to read an XML file (and perhaps not a JPEG), IIS didn't bother ASP.NET.</p>

<p>The workaround has been putting this line in <code>Web.config</code>'s <code>system.webServer.handlers</code> section:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;add name=""AspNetStaticFileHandler-XML"" path=""*.xml"" verb=""*"" type=""System.Web.StaticFileHandler"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this workaround works only for XML files. How to make a permanent fix that works for all files under the storage directory?</p>

<p>With Ruby on Rails (which I appreciate talks to a ""real"" database), with each record I add to a table, I can extract the ID of that record, send it somewhere, do something with it, and return data which can be associated with the original record.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Looking at other websites, and finally drilling it down, I've decided to use my own Unique ID. Apple can change the structure of URIRepresentation and, objectID can change if you change the structure of core data. So, it's best to stick with what I know.</p>

I have a window, with an NSView inside it, and that NSView is supposed to use data from an NSMutableArray containing NSNumbers to draw corresponding images on a grid such that images are drawn at 0,0; 32,0; 64,0 . . . 0,32; 32,32; etc. Accordingly the array's count is the grid's W*H, in this case 21*21 or 441.</p>

<p>You left click to ""place"" an image, which really just means updating the array based on where you clicked and then calling setNeedsDisplay:YES so it redraws itself to reflect the updated array. So far, I can get it to draw images based on the array properly.</p>

<p>When you right click, though, it is supposed to rotate the image in the particular grid slot by a certain amount. The only problem I am having here is figuring out how to actually draw the rotated images, in their proper locations. They should rotate about their center points, which would be the relative coordinates of 16,16 (all images are 32x32 pixels in size). As it is, my code is:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(NSRect)dirtyRect
{
    [super drawRect:dirtyRect];

    //Black background
    [[NSColor blackColor] setFill];
    NSRectFill(dirtyRect);

    // Drawing code here.
    NSRect rectToDraw = CGRectMake(0,0,32,32);
    NSInteger imageIndex = 0;
    NSImage *imageToDraw = nil;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; [objDataArray count]; i++) {
        //Loop through data array and draw each image where it should be
        if ([objDataArray objectAtIndex:i]==[NSNull null]) continue; //Don't draw anything in this slot

        //Math to determine where to draw based on the current for loop index
        //0 = 0,0; 1 = 32,0 . . . 20 = 640,0; 21 = 0,32; etc. (grid is 21x21)
        rectToDraw.origin.x = (i % 21)*32;
        rectToDraw.origin.y = floor(i/21)*32;

        //Get the data at this index in the data array
        imageIndex = [((NSNumber*)[objDataArray objectAtIndex:i]) integerValue];

        //Use the retrieved number to get a corresponding image
        imageToDraw = (NSImage*)[objImagesArray objectAtIndex:imageIndex];

        //Draw that image at the proper location
        [imageToDraw drawInRect:rectToDraw];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So say that the amount of rotation in degrees is specified by the variable rotationAmount. How do I change the drawInRect line (the last line before the closing braces) so that the image draws at the proper location specified by rectToDraw, but rotated by rotationAmount degrees about its center?</p>

<p>Hi Rotskoff, thanks I tried your suggestion but I could not get it to work, so I think I must have misunderstood something.</p>

<p>I created 3 files test.hs, test1.hs, and test2.hs as follows : </p>

<p>-></p>

<pre><code>--test.hs
import NecessaryModule
</code></pre>

<p>-></p>

<pre><code>--test1.hs
module NecessaryModule where

addNumber1 :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
addNumber1 a b = a + b
</code></pre>

<p>-></p>

<pre><code>--test2.hs
module NecessaryModule where

addNumber2 :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
addNumber2 a b = a + b
</code></pre>

<p>Then when I did : </p>

<pre><code>:load test
</code></pre>

<p>I got the error message : </p>

<pre><code>test.hs:1:8:
    Could not find module `NecessaryModule':
      Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.

<p>I want to change the color of the help text across the entire admin, so I want to extend the extrastyle block of the base.html template.</p>

<p>So in my main templates folder I created admin/base.html with this code in it:</p>

<pre><code>{% extends 'admin/base.html' %}

{% block extrastyle %}
    {# Changing the color of the help text across the entire admin #}
    &lt;style&gt;
        .help, p.help {
            font-size: 10px !important;
            color: #f00;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
{% endblock %}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when I try and access the admin, the server completely crashes with a 'bus 10' error.  I believe this is because it is trying to extend itself.  Since Django looks first in my app template folders, {% extend 'admin/base.html' %} finds itself first and the world explodes.</p>

<p>However, if I try placing the base html anywhere else it doesn't work.  If I place it in one of my apps it works only for that app, but if I place it anywhere else it is just ignored.</p>

<p>From my understanding it's a best practice to extend instead of override django templates, so I would like to get this working.  However if the only way I can do it is by overriding it, then that's the route I'll take.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Keyword FROM Keyword WHERE Keyword LIKE 'Keyword' Union All SELECT * FROM Keyword WHERE Keyword like '%Keyword%' AND NOT LIKE 'Keyword'
</code></pre>

<p>and the whole query i tried out:</p>

<pre><code>WITH SearchResult as 
(SELECT * FROM Keyword WHERE Keyword like 'Keyword' Union All SELECT * FROM Keyword WHERE Keyword like '%Keyword%' AND NOT LIKE 'Keyword') 
SELECT * FROM 
(SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Keyword DESC) AS RowNum, * 
 FROM SearchResult) AS Results 
WHERE (RowNum BETWEEN (1 - 1) * 100 + 1 AND 1 * 100)

<p>I need to make several requests to a server from my app so I am using AsyncHttpClient. </p>

<p>A part of my app has an user profile and a timeline to show some events. When the user logs in, I need to get their profile information, and the information of their timeline and to do so I have to make 3 different requests to the server:</p>

<p>1st Request: Log in -> Save cookies and session information into SharedPreferences
2nd Request: Get profile -> Save personal information of the user. 
3rd Request: Get the user timeline -> Save posts and events related to the current user. </p>

<p>If you see the code, what I am trying to do with the progress dialog is to keep it shown until the last request finishes (the getWalls request)</p>

<p>Thing is, sometimes when I log out and log in again with the same or a different user, I get the android.view.WindowLeaked exception and I think it is because I am not managing well my progress dialog. </p>

<p>How can I properly manage my progress dialog to avoid getting leaked windows? </p>

<p>Hope anyone can help me with this, thanks in advance. </p>

Database is mysql 5.1, there are 4 InnoDb tables and 4 views. Tables have numeric indexes for fields used in table joining.

But after 2 weaks, when urls table contains 384929 records (~25% of all processed urls) and takes 8.2Gb, java application begun work very slowly and crash every 1-2 minutes. I guess the reason is mysql, that can not handle growing loading (parser, which perform <code>2+4*BLOCK_NUMBER</code> queries every processed url; sphinx, which updating delta indexes every 10 minutes; I don't consider web-interface, because it's used by only one person), maybe it rebuild indexes very slowly? But mysql and scraper logs (which also contain all uncaught exceptions) are empty. What do you think about it?</p>

<pre><code>Array ( [width] =&gt; 100 [height] =&gt; 50 )

<p>which is an unexpected result. If I execute exactly the same code with imagick instead of gmagick, I will get different (expected) result</p>

<pre><code>Array ( [width] =&gt; 140 [height] =&gt; 70 )
</code></pre>

<p>Also, interestingly, for the gmagick, if I omit the line </p>

<pre><code>$output = $gm-&gt;getImageBlob();

<p>then I get the expected image size 140x70..</p>

<p>Am I missing something essential here?</p>

<p>I am struggling pretty hard here, I can't figure out how to get the results from the views, but I am hoping there is a way to get all accounts that match the filters for each view.</p>

<p>Here is my SOQL query:</p>

<p>This is the basis of the VF page I have made so far.  It is possible to filter the Account with Account Owner and a drop down list from province.  The idea is, many people in the organization have already created views with the accounts filtered as they need it.  Instead of including every possible account field as a filter, I would like a drop down list of the active users views associated with Account, and then they can select Opportunity 1 and Opportunity 2 and have a list of Accounts matching.</p>

<p>And then return the amount of swaps made and the checksum of the final answer. My program seemingly does both the sorting and the checksum according to how it wants. But my final answer is off for everything but the test input they gave.</p>

<p>I cut the xml file because it is long. The number of ids within each timestamp varies. I already have the code to read through the xml file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
if(file_exists('myfile.xml'))
{
  $xml = simplexml_load_file (""myfile.xml"");
}
else {
  exit ('Could not load the file...');
}

foreach($xml-&gt;item as $item)
{
   echo $item-&gt;timestamp.'&lt;br&gt;';
   {
      foreach($item-&gt;id as $id)
      {
        echo $id.' ';
      }
      echo '&lt;br&gt;';
      echo '&lt;br&gt;';
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the result is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>0
10 14 2 7 6

1
4 4 8 3 2 12
</code></pre>

<p>I just don't know how to go about plotting this in php in such a way that the timestamp is on the x-axis and the id gets plotted on the y-axis.</p>

<p>As you can see, the data is entered separately for the same employee. Let's say he reported SL (Sick Leave) for one day, the data is entered, Then he called next day to report another sick leave for two days..etc. Now what I want is to merge these entries when presenting it to the client so that all consecutive Absences with the same absence code will be merged. For example the table above should look exactly like this:</p>

<p>I am not an SQL guy, I can do it using a loop in C# to iterate a <code>DataSet</code> or <code>DataReader</code> but I hope to do this with T-SQL in a stored proc. I have found similar questions in StackOverFlow and checked them all, None of them applies for the above sample table.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Sometimes I will Have a situations like this:</p>

<pre><code>RecordId    EmpID       AbsCode DateFrom    DateTo
---------------------------------------------------------------
666542      1511        AB      09/11/2011  10/11/2011
666986      1511        AB      11/11/2011  25/12/2011
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this Employee had Absence from 9/11/2011 (d/M/yyyy) to (25/12/2011) but the client requested to have Absence list from 1st of December until 31st of December, So the result should be:</p>

<pre><code>EmpID       AbsCode DateFrom    DateTo
-------------------------------------------------------------
1511        AB      01/12/2011  12/11/2011
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, It will show the result according to parameters supplied (from, to). If the record stared before the requested period, It will show it but at the same time it will show the start of the record according to the parameters supplied, Same applies from records endings after the (from, to) parameters.</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks to Daniel's answer below I now know that the other threads do not have <em>out</em> bound to the output of the REPL. This code works because you pass in the <em>out</em> from where you run from.

<p>The issue is that many modules may share the same layout.  I don't want to copy the same exact layout into each module that uses it.  I know I can set everything to use one layout script by setting a specific path like <code>resources.layout.layoutpath = /layoutPath</code> and everything would use /layoutpath/layout.phtml, and I know I can set individual pages (or whole Controllers, in the init) by using <code>$this-&gt;_helper-&gt;layout-&gt;setLayout('foobaz');</code></p>

Ideally, it would be setup how it is currently, but if a module doesn't have its own layout.phtml, it would use the default module's layout.</p>

I've done quite a bit of searching and iterating over various solutions but have not yet been able to make a new window spawn on the second monitor.</p>

<p>Here's the use thread:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open file</li>
<li>Drag current tab to other monitor</li>
<li>New App instance spawns with that tab set in it, at the location that the user dragged the tab to.</li>
</ol>

<p>The disconnect is in step 3.  The new instance is always spawned on the Primary monitor.</p>

<p>So, some code to expand upon the problem.</p>

<pre><code>namespace app {
    public class AppView {
      public void OpenInNewWindow()
      {
        // Create a new viewmodel
        var appViewModel = new AppVM();

        //// On my machine this returns the correct screen ""DISPLAY2"".  The Top and Left properties are 0 and 1680, respectively.
        var targetScreen = Screen.FromPoint(System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Position);

        ////So we can set the position of the new view
        var appView = new AppView(appViewModel);

        //This seats the currently selected data tab inside the new AppViewModel
        RelocateSelectedViewModel(appViewModel);

        appView.WindowStartupLocation = System.Windows.WindowStartupLocation.Manual;
        appView.Top = targetScreen.WorkingArea.Top;
        appView.Left = targetScreen.WorkingArea.Left;
        appView.Show();
        // Have to maximize after we Show() or it won't appera on secondary monitors according to THE INTERNET!
        appView.WindowState = System.Windows.WindowState.Maximized;
        appView.Focus();            
      }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose I should mention that I have no problems getting the second Screen.  targetScreen in the code above is correctly finding the screen I want, and the Top and Left values of the new window are getting set correctly, to 0 and 1680, respectively.  It's just that the AppView.Show()  command (which is actually Window.Show()) creates the window on the primary screen.</p>

<p>I have taken this same code to a standalone project and it has worked, which leads me to believe that there is some kind of tie between my new appView and the current one that is overriding my sets here.  Has anyone encountered this problem before?</p>

<pre><code>Private Shared ReadOnly log As log4net.ILog = log4net.LogManager.GetLogger(decType)

<p>And since the class involves multiple threads interacting with it, I have a <code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code> instance that I use to make sure I don't get into any race conditions with my variables. So to recap,if I want to make sure I'm practicing safe threading do I need to do something like this:  </p>

    }

<p>I see that spring creates this @Component and properly configures it.  However, even though I am using this configuration, the @Provider is not utilized:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;jersey-serlvet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer&lt;/servlet-class&gt;

        &lt;param-name&gt;javax.ws.rs.Application&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;com.usamp.biddingtool.utilities.BiddingToolConfig&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;jersey.config.server.provider.packages&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;
            com.usamp.biddingtool.rest
            com.usamp.core.ui.model.utility
        &lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried using com.usamp as the only package and still the @Provider is not picked up in another JAR.  </p>

<p>As a test, I created a brand new class and placed it along the classes with the .WAR:</p>

<pre><code>package com.usamp.biddingtool.rest.providers.contextresolver;

@Component
@Provider
public class UIMapperProvider extends UIModelObjectMapperProvider {
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this class simply extends the class coming from the .JAR dependency.  </p>

<p>When server starts up what I see is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spring creates the a bean to represent UIModelObjectMapperProvider and calls proper setters to configure dependencies  </li>
<li>Spring creates the a bean to represent UIMapperProvider and calls proper setters to configure dependencies </li>
<li>Jersey creates a new object for UIMapperProvider and no dependencies are set</li>
</ol>

<p>So it seems that Spring is doing it's thing, however, Jersey is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not seeing a @Provider in a dependent .JAR (not scanning across jars for packages?)</li>
<li>When a @Provider IS found with the .WAR a new object is created and Spring's bean is not used</li>
</ol>

<p>I am using this to configure my application in web.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;javax.ws.rs.Application&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;com.usamp.biddingtool.utilities.BiddingToolConfig&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My BiddingToolConfig class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class BiddingToolConfig extends ResourceConfig {

    public BiddingToolConfig() {
        register(MultiPartFeature.class);
        register(UIModelObjectMapperProvider.class);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am also using the jersey-spring3 dependency:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.jersey.ext&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-spring3&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.8&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, my API methods ARE getting wired up correctly, so the following works:</p>

<pre><code>@Path(""bid)
@Component
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class BidAPI {

    @Resource
    private BidService
        bidService;

    @Resource
    private SFBidMappingService
        sfBidMappingService;
</code></pre>

<p>So it just seems that the @Providers are not being found when in a separate JAR, and when they are found, Spring is not utilized.  </p>

<p>Temporarily, I created a new @Provider class in the .WAR and implemented it to forward the call to Spring's bean:</p>

<pre><code>@Provider
public class UIMapperProvider implements ContextResolver&lt;ObjectMapper&gt; {
    @Override
    public ObjectMapper getContext(final Class&lt;?&gt; type) {
        return
            ApplicationContextProvider
                .getApplicationContext()
                .getBean(UIModelObjectMapperProvider.class)
                .getContext(type);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I should not have to do this.</p>

<p>Any idea what I am missing?</p>

This div is going to be absolute positioned along the bottom of the page and the swf file in it's normal state will only take up 29px in height. It isn't until the user hovers over some pieces of the swf that it will take up a height of 270px. I was going to incorporate some java script to change the height of the div for when that happens. However the problem I am running into is that the swf file won't align to the bottom of the div. It always seems to align to the top despite the fact that I am putting in <code>&lt;param name=""salign"" value=""lb"" /&gt;</code>, aka align left bottom. Is it not possible to fit a swf into a smaller div and have that swf align to the bottom vs being pushed down from the top?</p>

Of course i can move the object programmatically but i don't want to do that. What i want is the object has animation itself. I searched but i can't find exact file format. There are .obj files (not animated itself, is it true?), .mtl files, .anm files .etc. If the format is one of them, then can you give me an example model?</p>

<p>If there is a likelihood that <code>$_SESSION</code> won't be set on page load, what would be considered best practice in cases like the below? Is it considered OK to suppress notices like <code>Undefined index</code>, which would be the result of the second example if there was no <code>@</code> in front of it. How far is it worth going to have ""error free"" code considering processor usage (though the difference must be minimal in the cases below).</p>

<pre><code>if( isset($_SESSION['sessionvar']) ){ $seen = $_SESSION['sessionvar']; }
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>@$sessionid = $_SESSION['sessionvar'];

<p>I am again here with a problem my problem is:</p>

<p>I am trying to connect to the Exchange server i installed locally from a window app we are developing for a client. now what we want to do is: we want to fetch all the Emails with attachment from the inbox, save the attachment in a directory, read the attachment(specific info from them) and then send a info mail to others.</p>

<p>I am using Exchange Server 2007 SDK to connect to the Exchange Server.
the issue i am having is when we are trying to access mails from local exchange server we are getting an error ""No Connection could be made as target machine actively refused it"".</p>

<p>we are providing the Credentials like User Name, password, domain and URL.
User name : a mail account on the local web exchange server.
Password : password related to above account.
domain : domain for the window server.
URL : https://&lt; Domain Name/Configuration Domain Controller >/EWS/Exchange.asmx
but its not working properly.</p>

<p>I am done with everything else but this issue.
what I am doing wrong please suggest, any type of help will be appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>---
layout: layout
---
&lt;ul&gt;
{% for post in site.posts %}
{% for tag in post.tags %}
{% if tag == page.tag %}

&lt;li itemprop=""name"" itemprop=name&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/li&gt;

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Burt what I'd like to do is display the categories which have posts of the tag and the posts listed under each category.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Example use case</h2>

<p>Category 1 has post 1, post 2, post 3.
Category 2 has post 4, post 5, post 6.
Category 3 has post 7</p>

<p>Posts 1,2,4 have tag Tag1.</p>

<p>The tag page should display Category 1 + Post 1, post 2.  Category 2 + Post 4.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the homepage I display categories with all posts under each category like this:</p>

<pre><code>{% assign counter=0 %}
&lt;main id=""page"" role=""main""&gt;
{% for category in site.categories %}
&lt;div class=""col pane ui-layout-{% assign counter=counter | plus:1 %}"" id=""{{ page.id }}""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""colheader""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""bar""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p class=""lead""&gt;Leadin text&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{{ category | first }}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""colscroll unlock""&gt;
{% for posts in category %}
{% for post in posts %}
    &lt;div class=""colblock"" itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/BlogPosting""&gt;    
        &lt;div class=""excerpt""&gt;
            &lt;time class=""date"" datetime=""{{ page.date | '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%i:%S-08:00' }}"" itemprop=""datePublished""&gt;
                {{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}
            &lt;/time&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;
            &lt;a itemprop=""url"" href=""{{ post.url }}"" target=""_blank"" title=""{{ post.title }}""&gt;
                &lt;span itemprop=""name"" itemprop=name&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/h1&gt;                        
        &lt;p itemprop=""description""&gt;
            {{ post.excerpt }}..
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=""link_tags""&gt;{{ page.tags }}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{% endfor %}

<p>So on the tag page I try to achieve what I want like this but it is returning all categories and all posts just like the homepage rather than filtering by the tag.</p>

I'm using jQuery 1.8.16 and this <a href=""http://plugins.scbfolio.com/jquery_drag_drop_select/"" rel=""nofollow"">Multi-Select, Drag &amp; Drop</a> plugin and found that my page that utilizes it does not work anymore after the upgrade. After many hours of debugging I found out that the event object's target attribute does not contain the same element anymore.</p>

<p>It's easiest explained with an example, so I created <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/QwWnb/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">this on jsfiddle</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
  $(""#draggable"").draggable();
  $(""#droppable"").droppable({
      drop: function(event, ui) {
          $(this).addClass(""ui-state-highlight"").find(""p"").html(""Dropped!"");
          $('#target-content').html($(event.target).html());
      }
  });
});

&lt;div class=""demo""&gt;      
&lt;div id=""draggable""&gt;     
    &lt;p&gt;Drag me to my target&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;div id=""droppable""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drop here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""test""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when you use the jQuery 1.5.2 (or 1.6.4, but this version does for some reason not contain jQurey UI) on jsfiddle, and you drag the red box onto the green box, the event.target is refering to the green box, thus showing the text inside. However, when you use jQuery 1.7.x, the event.target is refering to the red box!</p>

<p>To me this seems to be lack of support for jQuery 1.7.x in jQuery UI 1.8.x, and I can't find any place on the homepages where this would be mentioned.</p>

<p>Now, what should I do? I can fix it in the Multiselect, Drag &amp; Drop plugin, but that will probably break it again if this bug is fixed later.</p>

<p>Now everything is working fine <strong>except updating the data displayed in the table after saving the edited row</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> When I click <code>save</code> to save my edits the data is sent to the database only and not in the table model.</p>

<p><strong>I would want that after saving to the database the data is inserted into the model as well and this should be reflected on the display as well.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do we make it work the way I have suggested above? And Also how should the same happen after adding a row?</p>

<p>I have tried </p>

<pre><code>    public void rowInserted(){
    this.fireTableDataChanged();
}
</code></pre>

<p>and call it after inserting into the database but it did not solve the problem.</p>

I've done everything as describet in Apples In-App Purchase Guidelines but it didn't solve the problem.</p>

<p>My problem is that i have created autorenewable subscriptions but they won't be autorenewed.</p>

<p>I've create a Payment Transaction Observer class, which implements the SKPaymentTransactionObserver interface. This class will be installed as a paymentObserver at Application startup in the <code>viewDidLoad:</code> method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PaymentTransactionObserver *observer = [[PaymentTransactionObserver alloc] init];</p>
  
  <p>[[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] addTransactionObserver:observer];</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the paymenttransactionobserver i have the paymentQueue:updateTransactions method: (same as describet in Apple's documentation)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>(void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions {
  for (SKPaymentTransaction *transaction in transactions) {</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>    switch (transaction.transactionState) {

        case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased: 

            [self completeTransaction:transaction]; 

            break;

        case SKPaymentTransactionStateFailed: 

            [self failedTransaction:transaction]; 

            break;

        case SKPaymentTransactionStateRestored:

            [self restoreTransaction:transaction]; 

            break;

        default:

            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When i buy a autorenewable product, the product will successfully be purchase.
But it will never be autorenewed. I thought of, that the transaction observer, somehow will get deallocated, but it won't (Otherwhise, i would be notified by the debugger). I also though, i did remove the observer but it will never be removed.</p>

<p>I used the debugger to ensure, that the <code>updateTranscations:</code> method will get called, but nothing. When i buy a test product (in sandbox-mode) with autorenewal time of one week, the method should get called after 3 minutes, but it wont. </p>

<p>What am i doing wrong?</p>

<p>Can anybody help?</p>

<p>Problem 1: i have PNG-Files in my res folder and i draw them using Canvas.drawBitmap. After reading this article ( <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html</a> ) i thought android resizes the bitmaps if the screen is bigger. Unfortunately i recognized no scaling (or any changes) when launching my app on a tablet vs. launching it on a phone. So how is it done? Should i come up with some fancy strategy to calculate the available space and draw my bitmaps using the source- and destination-Rectangle? Would be nice if someone has a best practice or some hints how to draw bitmaps on a canvas. I already read the pixel&lt;->dip conversion topics but i have to say i don't know how to use that ""solution"" in my app. So any help appreciated...</p>

<p>Problem 2: I have 3 PNGs in my res folder. One ldpi, one mdpi and one hdpi. Ldpi image has 50px*50px, mdpi has 75px*75px and hdpi has 100px*100px. When i load the app in the emulator (800*480) it uses the 100*100 png. When i load the app on the Acer Iconia Tab it uses the 75*75 image. I thought hdpi is for big screens (=tab) and mdpi or ldpi would be used for the emulator screen. At least i thought android would use the hdpi-image also on the tab but i got surprised... Any explantation for this as well much appreciated</p>

This case changes the value of all registers in $f, $t, $a, and $s and adds 2 items to the top of its stack in order to ensure that the average method is preserving properly the values it will need to run its calculations following the $jr from printStats. </p>

<p>The problem I am having is recurring in a few test cases where there are 3 batters. Batter 3 uses arbitrarily large integers.</p>

<pre><code># printStats puts two values at the top two spots in its stack.  This is where
#    the number of homeruns and outs were placed when printStats
#    is called.  A function is allowed to change its own stack.

# Changes the $s registers used by main. The average function should be
#    getting arguments from the $a registers and the stack, and not relying
#    on what is in the $s registers.

# From test12:
# Tests if $t registers are preserved (if needed) by average.
# printStats puts values into every $t register.

# From test13:
# Tests if $a registers used correctly when average calls printStats.
# printStats changes the contents of $a1, $a2, and $a3 before returning

# test with three batters, both average and slugging percentage
# First batter has no hits, but does have outs
# Second batter has hits and outs, with realistic values
# Third hitter has large values for some of the hits and for the
#    outs. This means the hits and outs *have* to be converted from int's
#    to float's in order to get the right answer.

<pre><code>SerializeAsString()
</code></pre>

<p>Where as the C++ version gives us both:</p>

<pre><code>SerializeToArray(...)
SerializeAsString()
</code></pre>

<p>We're writing to our C++ file in binary format, and we'd like to keep it this way. That said, is there a way of reading the binary data into Python and parsing it as if it were a string?</p>

<p><s>Is this the correct way of doing it?</p>

<pre><code>binary = get_binary_data()
binary_size = get_binary_size()

string = None
for i in range(len(binary_size)):
   string += i

message = new MyMessage()
message.ParseFromString(string)
</code></pre>

<p></s></p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Here's a new example, and a problem:</p>

<pre><code>message_length = 512

file = open('foobars.bin', 'rb')

eof = False
while not eof:

    data = file.read(message_length)
    eof = not data

    if not eof:
        foo_bar = FooBar()
        foo_bar.ParseFromString(data)
</code></pre>

<p>When we get to the <code>foo_bar.ParseFromString(data)</code> line, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Exception Type: DecodeError
Exception Value: Too many bytes when decoding varint.
</code></pre>

<h2>Update 2:</h2>

<p>It turns out, that the padding on the binary data was throwing protobuf off; too many bytes were being sent in, as the message suggests (in this case it was referring to the padding). </p>

<p>This padding comes from using the C++ protobuf function, <code>SerializeToArray</code> on a fixed-length buffer. To eliminate this, I have used this temproary code:</p>

<pre><code>message_length = 512

file = open('foobars.bin', 'rb')

eof = False
while not eof:

    data = file.read(message_length)
    eof = not data

    string = ''
    for i in range(0, len(data)):
        byte = data[i]
        if byte != '\xcc': # yuck!
            string += data[i]

    if not eof:
        foo_bar = FooBar()
        foo_bar.ParseFromString(string)
</code></pre>

<p>There is a design flaw here I think. I will re-implement my C++ code so that it writes variable length arrays to the binary file. As advised by the protobuf documentation, I will prefix each message with it's binary size so that I know how much to read when I'm opening the file with Python.</p>

<pre><code>employees &gt;--- position ---&lt; permission

<p>Employee.rb</p>

<pre><code>belongs_to :position

 # subject_class
 # subject
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>I have a problem with action buttons/links on AngularJS client side.</em></strong></p>

<p>For example I don't want to show link ""Add Order"" somewhere in Angular app because Employee's position permission allows only to read resource and not to modify it:</p>

<pre><code>id    action     subject_class     subject
 1    :read      Order

<p><strong>How I tried to solve this problem</strong></p>

<p>I create a resource GET <code>api/v1/employees/me</code> which returns current_employee with all his permissions:</p>

<pre><code>""employee"": {
    ...
    :position"": {
        ...
        ""permissions"": {
           {""id"": 1, ""action"": ""read"", ""subject_class"": ""Order"", ""subject"": """"},
           {""id"": 6, ""action"": ""manage"", ""subject_class"": ""Waybill"", ""subject"": """"}
        }
     }
  }

Not even command like 'c:\cygwin\bin' is executing.
When I type 'user' in cygwin command prompt, I get 'ntvdm has encountered an system error. Parameter incorrect'.</p>

I've implemented the code given by CIMGF for dynamic resizing of <code>UITableViewCell</code>. It worked for the first time around but does not seem to work now. Strange, right? 
Anyway, here are the code snippets:</p>

<pre><code>- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
{
    NSString *text = [[buzzList objectAtIndex:[indexPath row]] objectForKey:@""description""];
    CGSize constraint = CGSizeMake(260, 20000.0f);
    CGSize size = [text sizeWithFont:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:FONT_SIZE] constrainedToSize:constraint lineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap];
    CGFloat height = size.height;

    return height +25 +(CELL_CONTENT_MARGIN * 2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the corresponding code for <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>[cell.descriptionLabel setLineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap];
[cell.descriptionLabel setMinimumFontSize:FONT_SIZE];
[cell.descriptionLabel setNumberOfLines:0];
[cell.descriptionLabel setFont:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:FONT_SIZE]];

CGSize constraint = CGSizeMake(CELL_CONTENT_WIDTH - (CELL_CONTENT_MARGIN * 2), 20000.0f);

CGSize size = [[[buzzList objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] objectForKey:@""description""] sizeWithFont:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:FONT_SIZE] constrainedToSize:constraint lineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap];
cell.descriptionLabel.text=[[buzzList objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] objectForKey:@""description""];
CGRect rect=CGRectMake(45, 20, 260, size.height);
[cell.descriptionLabel setFrame:rect];
</code></pre>

<p>Where the values 45,20,260 are set by me to get the exact location of starting point of text in the cell and it's width. The values are correct and need no modification. However, When I execute the code, I get the right height for the cell (Dynamically adjustable according to the text) <code>BUT</code> the <code>descriptionLabel</code> shows maximum of 2 lines text. It truncates the text after that. :(</p>

<p>As modifications on my website were needed in result of massive growth and suggestions from the public, I needed to modify my database, which I have already done to adjust it to the visitor suggestions. Right, very confusing so I'll just get to the point:</p>

<p>Current query:</p>

<pre><code>$arow=mysql_fetch_assoc(mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM animelist WHERE id = '"".$_REQUEST['id'].""'""));
$placeholders = array(' ', ',', ':');
$replacements = array('-', '', '');
$title=str_replace($placeholders, $replacements,$arow['name']);
$title=preg_replace(""/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s-]/"", """", $title);
$link=$title.""-"".$arow['id'];

$link=""Stream-"".$title.""-Episode-"".$row1['episodes_id'].""-"".$row1['language'].""-"".$row1['id'];
</code></pre>

<p>Initially the part -Episode- was only needed to be named/written as '-Episode-', however to user suggestions and I completely agree, it needs to be dynamic aswell. Lets say (using the terms for reference only) at first the website only had Episodes and not Movies, but now also has Movies. So we want this part to be dynamic aswell. For this we use database information, I have made a column 'type' INT(1) in the table 'items' I suggest 0 to be -Episode- and if value under type is 1 then I suggest it to be -Movie-.</p>

<p>Now the question is how do I correctly implement it in the query? I understand more queries need to be made similar to the one from $title or $row1. this is what I have so far, but it is not complete yet, because I don't know how to:</p>

<pre><code>$link=""Stream-"".$title.""-.$type.-"".$row1['episodes_id'].""-"".$row1['language'].""-"".$row1['id'];

$type=$arow['type']
</code></pre>

<p>Now there should be a code, which I am not sure of how to write correctly, which makes the condition that if type = 0 then echo Episode, elseif type = 1 then echo Movie.</p>

<p>I greatly appreciate the time you took to read this through and hope you can help me out.</p>

<p>Edit:
Assume $row1, is fetched from table named 'videos' and not from 'animelist', however the table 'videos' each video has an 'id' but also has an column named 'anime_id', this anime_id is equal to the 'id' in 'animelist', in short videos id is the post, and anime_id is the category.</p>

<p>More queries need to be written now to balance the game, please help me out, I am stuck.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,

<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/w5d2s.png"" alt=""Form""></p>

<p>The first select field is required. And only one is required from the next three fields.
Phone with formatting is the last. And another two are for digits (some IDs).
I validate in controller, the code is next:</p>

<pre><code>public function getApplication()
{
    $input = Input::except('_token');
    Debugbar::info($input);
    $input['phone'] = preg_replace('/[^0-9]/', '', $input['phone']); // remove format from phone
    $input = array_map('intval', $input); // convert all numeric data to int
    Debugbar::info($input);

    $rules = [ // Validation rules
        ['operation-location' =&gt; 'required|numeric'],
        ['app-id' =&gt; 'numeric|min:1|required_without_all:card-id,phone'],
        ['card-id' =&gt; 'numeric|digits:16|required_without_all:app-id,phone'],
        ['phone' =&gt; 'numeric|digits:12|required_without_all:app-id,card-id']
    ];

    $validator = Validator::make($input, $rules);
    if ($validator-&gt;passes()) {
        Debugbar::info('Validation OK');

        return Redirect::route('appl.journal', ['by' =&gt; 'application']);
    }
    else { // Validation FAIL
        Debugbar::info('Validation error');
        // Redirect to form with error
        return Redirect::route('appl.journal', ['by' =&gt; 'application'])
            -&gt;withErrors($validator)
            -&gt;withInput();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you may see I convert numeric IDs to integers myself and leave only number for phone number.
The problem is when I submit form as it is, it passes validation, despite one field is required and starter phone format is too short.
I've tried changing required_without_all to just required on all fields (!), but it still passes fine with blank empty form submitted.
And I expect at least one field to be properly filled.</p>

<p>Debug of my inputs.
Initial:</p>

<pre><code>    array(4) [
    'operation-location' =&gt; string (1) ""0""
    'app-id' =&gt; string (0) """"
    'card-id' =&gt; string (0) """"
    'phone' =&gt; string (6) ""+3 8(0""
]
</code></pre>

<p>After conversion to int:</p>

<pre><code>    array(4) [
    'operation-location' =&gt; integer 0
    'app-id' =&gt; integer 0
    'card-id' =&gt; integer 0

                    }
                    //Add user to Cache

<p>But this doesn't seem to work. There are no records in sys.dm_qn_subscriptions. There are no more errors in Event Log (which I was getting yesterday and took appropriate steps to resolve those) Looking at the Sql Profiler I find that the SqlQueryNotification stored procedure is running every 2 minutes or so. </p>

Sympy evaluation can be done with arbitrary precision, but what precision would be just good enough, i.e. would not ""pollute"" longdoubles results? As far as I understand NumPy longdouble is in fact only 80 bits long, despite being called <code>float128</code> on my system. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_precision#Working_range"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> says that about 80-bit precision:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bounds on conversion between decimal and binary for the 80-bit format can be given as follows: if a decimal string with at most 18 significant digits is correctly rounded to an 80-bit IEEE 754 binary floating point value (as on input) then converted back to the same number of significant decimal digits (as for output), then the final string will exactly match the original; while, conversely, if an 80-bit IEEE 754 binary floating point value is correctly converted and (nearest) rounded to a decimal string with at least 21 significant decimal digits then converted back to binary format it will exactly match the original.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally,  I dig up in an interactive prompt:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.finfo(numpy.double).precision
15
&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.dtype(numpy.double).itemsize
8
&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.finfo(numpy.longdouble).precision
18
&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.dtype(numpy.longdouble).itemsize
16
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>So, wiki says that precision depends on in which way numbers are converted (either <code>18</code> or <code>21</code> digits), and Numpy just says it's <code>18</code> digits. Interestingly, precision of default double is equal to default SymPy numerical evaluation precision (<code>15</code> vs. <code>15</code>).</p>

<p>Assuming I'm converting at one point longdouble result to SymPy float (and then work on SymPy), what SymPy precision should I set? <code>18</code> digits? <code>21</code>? Little more?</p>

<p>I guess I could use the </p>

<p>But heres what it gotten to be so far. Normaly when you tap or double tap on a widget, the phone vibrates. Using this, the phone doesen't vibrate anymore when tapped nor it prints anything in logcat. This problem is annoying me for the last couple of days. Hopefully someone else will know what I am doing wrong.</p>

Seems like many version control systems have become trendy lately. Also, the question was <strong>exactly</strong> my situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Django based web application</li>
<li>Using an <a href=""http://www.travisswicegood.com/2010/01/17/django-virtualenv-pip-and-fabric/"" rel=""nofollow"">isolated virtulaenv environment</a></li>
<li>One man developer</li>
<li>Will not be open sourced</li>
<li>Linear project (no branches)</li>
<li>Perhaps will be using tags for releases (but not needed)</li>
</ul>

<p>At some point, it might become two developers. I'll worry about that down the line.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> Is there any reason to switch to another version control system now? I use <a href=""http://subversion.tigris.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SVN</a> on a Linux development box right now.</p>

I'm now trying to extend it so that each item on the canvas binds to a different ViewModel object - i.e. I'm setting the DataContext for each item.</p>

<p>Every item on the designer is actually a ContentControl, into which is placed a different template (based upon which toolbox item was dragged onto the canvas). So I have a template containing a TextBox, and I have a ViewModel object containing a Name property, and I bind the Text property of the TextBox to the Name property of the ViewModel, and ... nothing. I've checked the visual tree with Snoop, and it confirms that the DataContext of the TextBox is the ViewModel object. Yet the TextBox remains empty. And if I modify the (empty) Text in the TextBox, the Name property in the ViewModel does not change. So it looks like the binding is not being applied (or has been removed somehow).</p>

<p>I've found a few posts which talk about the ContentControl messing around with the DataContext and Content properties, but I'm not sure how applicable they all are. The code sets the ContentControl.Content as follows:</p>

<pre><code>newItem = new ContentControl();
ControlTemplate template = toolbox.GetTemplate();
UIElement element = template.LoadContent() as UIElement;
ViewModelItem viewModel = new ViewModelItem() { Name = ""Bob"" };

newItem.Content = element;
newItem.DataContext = viewModel;
</code></pre>

<p>and the XAML for the template is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ControlTemplate&gt;
    &lt;Border BorderBrush=""Black"" BorderThickness=""1"" Width=""100""&gt;
        &lt;TextBox Text={Binding Name}/&gt;
    &lt;/Border&gt;
&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Snoop shows that the TextBox has a DataContext, and if I Delve that DataContext I can see that it has a Name property whose value is ""Bob"". So why does the TextBox remain empty? Snoop allows me to change that Name property, but the TextBox remains empty.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<hr>

<p>A few more details. I've set the VS2010 Debug DataBinding option for the OutputWindow to Verbose, which seems to show that the binding is all being attempted <em>before</em> I set the DataContext. Is it possible that the change to the DataContext is not being recognised?</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>I've realised that the template has come through a XamlWriter, which apparently strips all bindings. This wouldn't be helping. </p>

<hr>

<p>I've not been able to fix the DataTemplate.LoadContent(), but I realised that I didn't actually need a DataTemplate, since the XamlWriter / XamlReader was already instantiating the UI element that I was after. I found a fix to make the XamlWriter write all the bindings <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/27158/XamlWriter-and-Bindings-Serialization"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, and after that it all works.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr ng-repeat=""row in rowCollection""&gt;
    &lt;td ng-repeat=""col in columns""&gt;{{value-to-show}}&lt;/td&gt;

In a Firebase transaction (in Java), if I get unexpected or inconsistent (stale) values from <code>MutableData.getValue()</code>, how should I error check and make sure that the transaction runs repeatedly if necessary? When do I use <code>Transaction.abort()</code> vs <code>Transaction.success()</code>?</p>

<p><em>Long version</em>:<br>
I wanted to write a Firebase transaction in Java that </p>

<ol>
<li><p>checks if the value ""foo"" is stored at a location, logging errors if it's different or missing, and then</p></li>
<li><p>updates the value to ""bar"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We expect ""foo"" to be at the location because it's successfully written by the same client before the transaction is run.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>public Transaction.Result doTransaction(MutableData data) {
    String value = (String) data.getValue();
    if(value == null || !Transaction.equals(""foo"")) {
        return Transaction.abort();
    }
    data.setValue(""bar"");
    return Transaction.success(data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know <code>data.getValue()</code> may return stale values (including <code>null</code>) because of the eventual consistency of Firebase, and so the transaction may need to execute multiple times. But it seems like the transaction only ever runs once if I return <code>Transaction.abort()</code> in the <code>if</code> statement. If I replaced it with <code>Transaction.success(data)</code>, wouldn't I be committing bad values? How do I detect when the value is actually null or not ""foo""?</p>

<p>I <em>really</em> hope the dev of Fody sees this because we're at an absolute standstill until this is fixed. We can't ""revert"" back to when it was working because the current configuration IS when it was working.</p>

Ideally, I'd like to be able to refer to the attribute directly but not be allowed to assign to it. When experimenting, I got this very curious behavior:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Boo(object):

...             self.__x = x
...     def getx(self):

&gt;&gt;&gt; b.__x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.getx()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.__x
2
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to add that when I used <code>x</code> and <code>_x</code> as the attribute names, reassigning the attribute caused the getter to return the changed value, i.e. both <code>b.getx()</code> and <code>b.x</code>/<code>b._x</code> gave me <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>I realize that I'm using <code>x</code> as the property name, though, but when I tried the following I got an <code>AttributeError</code> in my <code>__init__()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Boo(object):

<p>The error as I tried to access localhost:8000/media/a.gif is as following:</p>

<p>I put the admin media files in directory named ""media"", while I put the normal media files in directory named ""static"". I'm on Windows, too.</p>

<p>Here's how I serve the ordinary media files in urls.py:</p>

<p>And my settings.py (only the important pieces):</p>

<pre><code>import project_path
MEDIA_ROOT = project_path.MEDIA.replace('\\','/')
MEDIA_URL = '/static/'
ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/media/'
TEMPLATE_DIRS = (

TEMPLATE = join(ROOT, ""templates"")
MEDIA = join(ROOT, ""static"")

</code></pre>

<p>Any hints?</p>

<p>or maybe at least please share how do you serve your admin media files (without changing any files from the web server, but only via the django source code)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>+""42"" which would yield the number output of 42.</p>

<p>But further along in the section about <em>Operators</em> it says that by adding a string ""something"" to any number you can convert that number to a string. They also provide the following example which confused me:</p>

<p>""3"" + 4 + 5 would presumably yield a string of 345 in the output, because numbers 4 and 5 would also be converted to strings.</p>

<p>However, wouldn't 3 + 4 + ""5"" yield a number of 12 instead of a string 75 as was stated in their example?</p>

<p>In this second example in the section about operators wouldn't the + operator which is standing in front of a string ""5"" convert that string into number 5 and then add everything up to equal 12?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>For this example. When I choose <code>List 1 = ""BBBBBBBBBB""</code>, List 2 will be <code>[""1111111111"",""1222222222"",""1333333333"",""1444444444""] =&gt; 4 products</code></p>

<p>And I choose<code>List 1 AGAIN = CCCCCCCCCC</code>. List 2 will be <code>[""1111111111"",""1333333333"",""2111111111"",""2222222222"",""2333333333"",""2444444444""]; =&gt; 6 products</code></p>

<p>I don't want it be....I want it JUST SHOW 4 products as List 1 was chose. Can anyone help me to solve this.</p>

<p>Thank for all.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> 
Thank for give me the suggestion. I have found and tried much but I don't get it. Now everything is ok.
The solution for this is add do function like this to remove by ""loop for"" for the selectors.</p>

<pre><code>function removeOptions(selectbox)
{
    var i;
    for(i=selectbox.options.length-1;i&gt;=0;i--)
    {
        selectbox.remove(i);
    }
}
//using the function:

removeOptions(document.getElementById(""pro_name""));
</code></pre>

<p>And my completed code is:</p>

<p>This allows for the formation of irregular graphs, such as:</p>

<pre><code>N------N---------N-------N
      / \        |        \
     /   \       N---N-----N
    /     \      |    \    |  
   N-------N-----N     N---N            
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  Very dynamic data.  A typical node may look like so:</p>

<pre><code>NOODE_1 -&gt; NODELINK_1 -&gt; NODELINK_2 -&gt; NODELINK_3 -&gt; NULL
               |             |             |
               V             V             V
             NODE2_        NODE3_        NODE4_
</code></pre>

<p>A problem arises when it comes to traversing such a graph.  Making my way around the graph is easy enough, but how can I make sure I don't find myself stuck traversing a loop within the graph (NOTE: It is unsafe to assume that the head will be a part of this loop, so your typical ""circular linked list traversal"" algorithm won't cut it here), and how can I make sure to know when a node has been processed before?</p>

<p>The only thing I can come up with is setting a flag within each node, indicating that it has already been processed.  This seems sort of like a hackjob, but I can't think of any other way to do this that I would consider reasonable.  Am I wrong?  Is there a better way?</p>

<p>For example, while trying to search() inside the Users file from the Stacked class, I need the fields (username, name, last name, etc...) which are inside the Users Descriptor file, but I cant come up with a nice design for it. The only way I can think of is passing the Descriptor reference to each method (search, write, etc...) but I have a feeling that my solution would be bad design. </p>

<p>Please note that I still have to keep adding more file organizations for different files, so I want to plan ahead and have a nice file manager to handle all the requests the best way possible, but currently this is what I've come up with. </p>

<p>This code fails to compile with <code>g++</code>, Visual C/C++, and Comeau C/C++ with basically the same error message:</p>

    static int do_stuff(int) {

<p>g++ says ""error: template with C linkage"", Visual C/C++ emits compiler error <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/95bhc9c2.aspx"">C2894</a>, and Comeau C/C++ says ""error: this declaration may not have extern ""C"" linkage"".</p>

<p>The thing is, all are happy with:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

extern ""C"" {
    static int do_stuff(int) {
        return 3;
    }

    struct test {
        static void foo(int (*)(int)) { }
    };
}

int main()
{
    test::foo(&amp;do_stuff);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Section 7.5, Linkage specifications, of the C++ Standard states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A C language linkage is ignored for the names of class members and the member function
  type of class member functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it even gives the example:</p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" {
    class X {
        void mf(); // the name of the function mf and the member
                // function's type have C++ language linkage
        void mf2(void(*)()); // the name of the function mf2 has C++ language
                // linkage; the parameter has type pointer to C function
    };
}

<p>If templates were allowed in extern ""C"" blocks, then the member functions of the instantiations would have C++ linkage.</p>

<p>Why, then, does chapter 14, Templates, of the C++98 Standard state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A template name may have linkage (3.5). A template, a template explicit specialization (14.7.3), and a class template partial specialization shall not have C linkage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does it mean that a template ""may"" have linkage? What is template linkage?</p>

<p>Why is it explicitly forbidden to have a template with C linkage, when a class is okay, and all member functions of instantiations of the template (the default constructor, destructor, and assignment operator overload) would have C++ linkage?</p>

<p>When I manually enter an invalid date such as 21544/10/2012, icefaces converts it to some acceptable format such as 10/12/2020 or similar. It must be doing some background calculation due to which it converts the invalid date to some other date. When it reaches my own validator, the date is already converted into some other date thus my validation has no effect and no message is displayed regarding the invalid date format. There is no JIRA raised to address this. Before I raise this as a bug has anyone else faced this problem or have any solution. </p>

<p>Also, the problem does not occur when <code>pattern=""dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm""</code>. It occurs only when pattern is <code>pattern=""dd/MM/yyyy""</code></p>

<p>Such construction repeats many times and surrounds different code. This can be a method with or without return statement.
I want to make something reusable of this try-finally block.</p>

<p>I've think out of such realization. </p>

<pre><code>public abstract class ISafeExecute&lt;T&gt; {

private IDfSession session = null;

protected abstract T execute() throws DfException;

public T executeSafely() throws Exception {
    IDfSessionManager manager = DfcSessionManager.getSessionManager();
    try {
        session = manager.getSession(DfsUtils.getCurrentRepository());
        return execute();
    } finally {
        if (session != null) {
            manager.release(session);
        }
    }
}

public IDfSession getSession() {
    return session;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Session field was made with public getter.</p>

<p>And we can use this class like this(with returned object):</p>

<pre><code>return new ISafeExecute&lt;String&gt;() {
        @Override
        public String execute() throws DfException {
            return getSession().getLoginTicket();
        }
    }.executeSafely();
</code></pre>

<p>Or without return object:</p>

<pre><code>    new ISafeExecute() {
        @Override
        public Object execute() {
            someMethod();
            return null;
        }
    }.executeSafely();

            echo $format;

<p>The parse error is  in the for loop, at the end of the format string, the part where a and div tags are closed.</p>

<p>Also, if this is a bad practice to generate html content, please tell me and suggest another solution :)</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I have corrected the code, and it works, but the for loop doesn't work as it is supposed to. It always prints out only one div with the correct image, and it is supposed to print out 4 of them. When I echo format 4 times by myself without using a loop, every thing is fine. </p>

<p>If I do this it works fine(but that's just bad practice):</p>

<pre><code>echo '&lt;div class=""col-sm-3 col-xs-6""&gt;
        &lt;a href=""'.$curl_odgovor_decoded[0]['slika1'].'"" title=""slika1"" &gt;

        &lt;img class=""img-responsive img-customer"" src=""'.$curl_odgovor_decoded[0]['slika2'].'""&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';    
        echo '&lt;div class=""col-sm-3 col-xs-6""&gt;
        &lt;a href=""'.$curl_odgovor_decoded[0]['slika3'].'"" title=""slika3"" &gt;
        &lt;img class=""img-responsive img-customer"" src=""'.$curl_odgovor_decoded[0]['slika3'].'""&gt;

I'm not sure where to start but each time I click my icon,  it re-starts my application.  I have tried using different launchmodes with nothing different happening.  I'm thinking it has to do with the OnCreate code, and the setting of the notification.  I need help saving my application state and then resuming on either re-click of icon or click from notification bar.  I've tried everything had to turn here for help.

I now need to display the results as a real-time chart in a client browser. To keep things simple, I am presently using the image-based Google chart URL and restricting the amount of data to be plotted. Eventually this client-side display piece will be rich &amp; interactive.</p>

<p>I understand that one of the ways for my server to push the data out to the browser is Comet. I expect there must be a corresponding socket-something on the browser side, so the two should go together. </p>

<p>Q1: For prototyping: what is the simplest way for me to push string data from node.js to my Firefox 3.6.10 browser? String updates less than 1KB once per second.</p>

<p>Q2: For production: any recommendations for an approach that will work across browsers, including mobile devices? Binary updates order of 100KB per second, no images or video.</p>

<p>I am also using the Perforce source control plug-in. These solutions are under source control.</p>

<p>Actions that can prompt this behaviour are things like, creating a content page from a master page, clicking on the 'Configuration' icon at the top of the solution explorer. Ironically, actually running one of the projects doesn't seem to cause the same problems.</p>

<p>Once things have settled down, I end up with a notification area that fills half my taskbar. 'Running' the mouse along these icons then causes them to disappear, in the same way that you sometimes get with applications that have terminated unexpectedly.</p>

<p>I've got some resources already but probably there are some good ones I do not know of out there:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1847197108"" rel=""nofollow"">C# 2008 and 2005 Threaded Programming: Beginner's Guide (Book)</a> (this is the one I'm thinking about starting to look at first)</li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735627045"" rel=""nofollow"">CLR via C# (Dev-Pro)</a> (I have this book also and Jeffery has some threading stuff in here too)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.albahari.com/threading/"" rel=""nofollow"">Threading in C# - eBook</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/032143482X"" rel=""nofollow"">Concurrent Programming on Windows</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1930110545"" rel=""nofollow"">.NET Multi-threading Book from 2003 (Book)</a> (not sure if this stuff is outdated...)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>So:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Looking for others (videos, books, etc.) and also what your opinion is on the resources above (would you recommend certain ones as better or ones as outdated / bad?).</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Also, since this is a broad and highly complex topic...being a complete foreigner to this, I'm trying to narrow down some kind of sane study list.  Threading is deeeeeeeep so I just want to cover the basics or most likely the areas they'll probably touch (locking, thread safe, etc.).  I don't need to go into this interview being an expert...just show that I am not completely clueless about when to use it, common scenarios and a couple examples I can explain to them.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Anyone with threading experience out there to point me to some good resources or give me some good study tips or areas you think I should most definitely hit up?</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> Obviously with the advent of .NET 4.0 that changes things altogether but I am focusing on .NET 3.5 mainly here.  I need to just know the basics of THREADING first...the concept, things to be aware of, locking, thread safe singletons (I know John Skeet's page on Singletons, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>5)</strong> Another thing that would help me are real world examples and reasons to use threading.  Both on the IIS side, OOP side, server farms, ect.  I'd like to know some real examples of use of threading or common scenarios in real life apps where you really need to start utilizing threading.</p>

<p>I don't need everyone to answer all 5 of my areas here...even just advice in one of the 1-5 above would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks...</p>

<p><em>UPDATE / DISCLAIMER</em> (after receiving a few assumptions about me)</p>

<p>No I'm not going to go in there claiming I know threading or am an expert in it, but that I'm a beginner and have done only a couple things at a past job and still learning.  But I did want to give the context in why I'm posting this entire thread here so you can help me hone in better in a shorter period of time...filter out a path that may be better so I don't waste my time both for the interview but also for my future learning.</p>

<p>Which one is the best approach to guarantee good performance and providing ""clean code""?</p>

<p><strong>Variant 1</strong> (The way I actually apply):
I declare a single <code>TextView</code> variable ""tempText"" as global variable and assign the TextView to update to this variable (alternatively in a extra method).
Alternatively, a) is doing the whole procedere in the <code>onCreate()</code>, while b) is handle everything in a method called e.g. <code>updateTextViews()</code></p>

<pre><code>(...)

public class MyActivity extends Activity{

    private TextView tempText;

    public onCreate(Bundle icicle){
        (...)

        tempText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_1);
        tempText.setText(string_1);

        tempText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_2);
        tempText.setText(string_2);

        (...)

        tempText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_n);
        tempText.setText(string_n);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Variant 2</strong> :
I declare a single <code>TextView</code> variable ""tempText"" as variable in the <code>onCreate()</code> or the respective method and assign the TextView to update to this variable.
The rest is in analogy to Variant 1.</p>

<pre><code>(...)

public class MyActivity extends Activity{

    public onCreate(Bundle icicle){
        (...)

        private TextView tempText;

        tempText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_1);
        tempText.setText(string_1);

        tempText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_2);
        tempText.setText(string_2);

        (...)

        tempText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_n);
        tempText.setText(string_n);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Variant 3:</strong>
I declare a global <code>TextView</code> variable for every <code>TextView</code> to update. This, as far as I know, needs more space in the RAM, but I don't know about the impact to velocity. Also here, are there differences between handling it in the <code>onCreate()</code> (a)) or in a seperate method (b))?</p>

<pre><code>(...)

public class MyActivity extends Activity{

    private TextView tempText_1;
    private TextView tempText_2;
    (...)
    private TextView tempText_n;

    public onCreate(Bundle icicle){
        (...)

        tempText_1 = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_1);
        tempText_1.setText(string_1);

        tempText_2 = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_2);
        tempText_2.setText(string_2);

        (...)

        tempText_n = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_n);
        tempText_n.setText(string_n);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Variant 4:</strong>
I declare a <code>TextView</code> variable for every <code>TextView</code> to update in the <code>onCreate()</code> or the respective method which handles this. The rest is in analogy to Variant 3?</p>

<pre><code>(...)

public class MyActivity extends Activity{


    public onCreate(Bundle icicle){
        (...)

        private TextView tempText_1;
        private TextView tempText_2;
        (...)
        private TextView tempText_n;

        tempText_1 = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_1);
        tempText_1.setText(string_1);

        tempText_2 = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_2);
        tempText_2.setText(string_2);

        tempText_n = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv_n);
        tempText_n.setText(string_n);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which one is the ""best"" method? Variants 1 and 2 provide reserving only one memory address in the RAM and use this, while according to Robert C. Martins ""Clean Code"" the variables are really ambiguous. Option 3 and 4 would be the exact opposite. But for the rest I'm not very conscious of other effects.</p>

<p>Mocking inter-bundle-dependencies is quite easy since OSGi strengthens the DIP <em>(Dependency Inversion Principle)</em> and injector-methods (e.g. setter) usually exist.<br>
But what about bundle internal dependencies?  </p>

<p>For example look at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5577274/testing-java-sockets"">this case</a>. Now I want to bring it into an OSGi context...

<p>If we would refactor the socket creation into a separate but still bundle internal POJO <em>(Plain Old Java Object)</em> class, how should we inject it into the protocol implementation?  </p>

<ul>
<li>In the unit test we could simply use a setter method but who would do this in the OSGi container for us?  </li>
<li>Subclassing the tested class and overwriting a creator-method would only work if the tested class is not declared as final.  </li>

<p>Using XDocument, I can get into the Descendants of <code>&lt;extendeddata&gt;</code>fine which returns all the data nodes and values but how do I specifically grab the value of one based on the name of the data attribute? so for example I want to get in to a specific element such as: <code>&lt;data-name=""realStartTime""&gt;1366113604&lt;/data&gt;</code> being 1366113604 as the value I want to get out.</p>

<pre><code>public override Boolean OnSave(Object entity, Object id, Object[] state,
        String[] propertyNames, IType[] types)
</code></pre>

<p>and take a look at the propertyNames the only items in there are the items that were explicitly mapped in the mapping file (in the example this would just be ID, Start, and End). </p>

<p>In my case though I have a base class which isn't mapped at all. Instead it's just contains properties that get filled out by the interceptors. This used to work in Fluent Nhibernate, but now that I've moved to Nhibernate 3.3 I can't get it to work anymore.</p>

<p>My classes/mapping look something like this</p>

<pre><code>public class BaseAuditEntity
{
  public virtual int ModifiedByUserID { get; set; }
  public virtual DateTime LastModifiedTime { get; set; }
}

public class Foo : BaseAuditEntity
{
  public virtual int ID { get; protected internal set; }
  public virtual DateTime Start { get; protected internal set; }
  public virtual DateTime End { get; protected internal set; }
}

public class FooMap: ClassMapping&lt;Foo&gt;
{
  Id(x =&gt; x.ID, m =&gt; m.column(""fooID""));
  Property(x =&gt; x.Start, m =&gt; m.column(""start""));
  Property(x =&gt; x.End, m =&gt; m.column(""end""));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas of how to get this work? I don't want to have to map this every class, and I didn't think I needed to map the BaseAuditEntity, at least with Fluent it wasn't needed.</p>

<p>What I know of titanium is that it uses html/css for the views, and language of choice (javascript, ruby,python,php) for everything else. Then it gets compiled(?) into a native app.</p>

<p>What are the quirks? if any? </p>

<ol>
<li>Is it necessary for the user to install some sort of a runtime to execute the compiled app?</li>
<li>I suppose javascript is the prefered language, but how are the other ones handled?
<ul>
<li>For example, which Ruby interpreter would be included, would I be albe to use the ruby stdlib or external libraries? Would it affect the speed of the app? I.e JS > Ruby in terms of speed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since the views are CSS/HTML, would it still be necessary to style the elements, add them effects via JS librarier to achieve a widget-like feeling? Or does it come with some pre-made settings/classes for that?</li>
<li>I am not sure if it applies to the desktop package, but is there some syncing with the appcelerator's server required? What would it be necessary for?</li>
</ol>

<p>I am sorry if the questions sound stupid, but I didn't even realise there are than many tools until recent. I am ultimately looking for something which is easy to use, has an option to work with a back-end server for data exchange, looks preferably good 'out of the box' or doesnt require that much work to get it themed nicely and works on mobile as well as desktop devices.</p>

<p>I'm currently using eclipse to edit and build the project, but I'd like to switch over to using an ant file, as it should be eaiser to maintain (don't need a specific version of eclipse), and eaiser to build (just run ""ant build"" or something.</p>

<p>The problem is, I'm not sure where I should be including the libraries in the ant file. My current ant file (see below) always fails at the javac stage, so I think it should be there. It generally because it can't find things like ""Element"", which is a class defined by the JDom2 library.</p>

<p>Could somebody explain where I should be importing it, and how.</p>

Thanks to the template ""Master-Detail Application"" I can make use of the built-in NSFetchedResultsController and its methods which take care of the core data handling (e.g. deleting rows). When running the app, the cells get configured with the existent core data objects. At this point I can delete those entries like one would expect.</p>

<p>In addition, my app also has a refresh button. When tapped, it loads some new data from the internet and converts it into objects that are saved to core data. The cells configure themselves again the same way they did before and the UITableView gets a refresh. Again I can delete an entry but now, as soon as I've deleted one which then disappears normally, the table freezes (not the whole app) in the sense that its cells are not tappable anymore/don't react to gestures. I can refresh and that work (10 entries again after having deleted one before) but the cells keep being untappable. I have to stop the app to return to normal functionality.</p>

<p>When restarting, the one entry deleted before is - like expected - gone, 9 entries are left. Again everything works fine at this point, I can delete multiple ones without a problem. But as soon as a manual refresh took place, we're at the same point as before when deleting an entry now.</p>

<p>Please can someone assist me with the issue I have come across as it’s prohibiting me from running code on the iPhone?</p>

<p>The code works beautifully on WP8 and Android however it breaks horribly on iPhone due to JIT limitations. The error I receive is the following:
<em>Attempting to JIT compile method 'ServiceStack.ServiceClient.Web.AsyncServiceClient:SendAsync (string,string,object)' while running with --aot-only. See <a href=""http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/about/limitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/about/limitations</a> for more information.</em></p>

<p>I have tried in Debug mode, Release mode and with all of the available linker options to no avail. The problem definitely lies with how I have implemented the new async calls in the AsyncServiceClient.cs file. For the changes made to ServiceStack codem, please see my Github repo <a href=""https://github.com/dylanvdmerwe/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/ServiceClient.Web/AsyncServiceClient.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Example Android and iPhone projects can be found <a href=""http://d-h.st/y0h"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. One is for Android which works flawlessly and the other is for iPhone. Would it be possible for someone to assist me with what I need to change in order to get this code to work on the iPhone runtime? I am not sure if there is a bug or if there is something I would be required to change?</p>

One of the SAS Analysts uses 'weights' in their models. Basically to give certain records more importance than other records. Is this possible to do in SSAS Data mining?</p>

observer.observe(target, config);

<p>I have a Microsoft Word Add-In, written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), that compresses a document and all of it's related contents (embedded media) into a zip archive. After creating the zip archive it then turns the file into a byte array and posts it to an ASMX web service. This mostly works.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>The main issue I have is transferring large files to the web site. I can successfully upload a file that is around 40MB, but not one that is 140MB (timeout/general failure).</p>

<p>A secondary issue is that building the byte array in the VBScript Word Add-In can fail by running out of memory on the client machine if the zip archive is too large.</p>

<h1>Potential Solutions</h1>

<p>I am considering the following options and am looking for feedback on either option or any other suggestions.</p>

<h2>Option One</h2>

<p>Opening a file stream on the client (MS Word VBA) and reading one ""chunk"" at a time and transmitting to ASMX web service which assembles the ""chunks"" into a file on the server.</p>

<p>This has the benefit of not adding any additional dependencies or components to the application, I would only be modifying existing functionality. (Fewer dependencies is better as this solution should work in a variety of server environments and be relatively easy to set up.)</p>

<h3>Question:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are there examples of doing this or any recommended techniques (either on the client in VBA or in the web service in C#/VB.NET)?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Option Two</h2>

<p>I understand WCF may provide a solution to the issue of transferring large files by ""chunking"" or streaming data. However, I am not very familiar with WCF, and am not sure what exactly it is capable of or if I can communicate with a WCF service from VBA. This has the downside of adding another dependency (.NET 3.0). But if using WCF is definitely a better solution I may not mind taking that dependency.</p>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Does WCF reliably support large file transfers of this nature? If so, what does this involve? Any resources or examples?  </li>
<li>Are you able to call a WCF service from VBA? Any examples?</li>
</ul>

I even tried calling the <code>ndo_start_xmit</code> (traditionally <code>hard_start_xmit</code>) function pointer of the wlan driver, but without consequences.

<p>A required option is for the Linux Admin that's running the script to be able to override any of the item/value pairs from the config file, at the command-line.</p>

<p>The way I'm currently handling this seems overly cumbersome and I know there's got to be a more innovative and less clunky way to do this.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the code I:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Parse the YAML config file with <a href=""http://p3rl.org/YAML%3a%3aTiny"" rel=""nofollow"">YAML::Tiny</a></p>

<pre><code>location:
    continent: na
    country: us
    city: rh
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create variables with the same names as the config file items, assigning the values from the config file.</p>

<pre><code>my $yaml = YAML::Tiny-&gt;new;
$yaml = YAML::Tiny-&gt;read($config_yml);
my $continent = $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{location}-&gt;{continent};
my $country = $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{location}-&gt;{country};
my $city = $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{location}-&gt;{city};

<li><p>Use <a href=""http://p3rl.org/Getopt%3a%3aLong"" rel=""nofollow"">Getopt::Long</a> and assign the variables, overriding anything passed at the command-line.</p>

  def compose[A, B, C](f: A ~&gt; B)(g: B ~&gt; C): A ~&gt; C

<p>Here's an instance for unary functions:</p>

<pre><code>object Category {

    def compose[A, B, C](f: A =&gt; B)(g: B =&gt; C) = g.compose(f)

<p>Now, categories are subject to some laws. Relating composition (<code>.</code>) and identity (<code>id</code>):</p>

<pre><code>forall f: categoryArrow -&gt; id . f == f . id == f
</code></pre>

<p>I want to test this with ScalaCheck. Let's try for functions over integers:</p>

<pre><code>""Categories"" should {
  import Category._

  val intG  = { (_ : Int) - 5 }

  ""left identity"" ! check {
    forAll { (a: Int) =&gt; fCat.compose(fCat.id[Int])(intG)(a) == intG(a) }

  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But these are quantified over (i) a specific type (<code>Int</code>), and (ii) a specific function (<code>intG</code>). So here's my question: how far can I go in terms of generalizing the above tests, and how? Or, in other words, would it be possible to create a generator of arbitrary <code>A =&gt; B</code> functions, and provide those to ScalaCheck?</p>

<p>Everything seems fine <strong>EXCEPT</strong>:</p>

<p>When expanding one of the nodes, the <strong>NodeExpand Event sends the wrong value for the node that is being expanded</strong>. For example, if I expand Node 3, it gives me value (e.Node.Value)  for Node 1. See picture below for more explanation. As a result wrong child nodes are loaded.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rdJ7l.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>1) Why NodeExpand is broken when NodeTemplate is being added ?</p>

<p>2) Any way to achieve  adding an arrow to the node so people can left-click on it without overwriting NodeTemplate?</p>

Instead of copying the class in every project I'm trying to put it in a separate jar, so I have this structure:</p>

<li>JPALogic: JAR project with JPALogic class in it</li>
<li>RemoteServices: JAR project with beans interfaces</li>
<li>Services: EJB project with beans, including JPALogic and RemoteServices as libraries</li>
<li>Frontend: WAR project with frontend, including RemoteServices as library.</li>
</ul>

<p>JPALogic is used only in the EJB project and there's no reference to it in other parts of the Java EE app. In JPALogic library I've my JPALogic bean:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class JPALogic {
  @Resource
  private EJBContext ejbContext;
  @Inject @ShardedPersistenceContext
  private EntityManager em;
  public JPALogic() {
  }
  [...lots of methods...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works perfect if JPALogic code is directly in the EJB project, but when I put it in the external library deployment become very unstable (netbeans 8 + glassfish 4) and almost every deploy fail with this error:</p>

<pre><code>Exception while deploying the app [app] : Cannot resolve reference [Remote ejb-ref name=com.my.autenticacion.services.AutRolBackendServices/jpa,Remote 3.x interface =com.my.infraestructura.jpa.JPALogic,ejb-link=null,lookup=,mappedName=,jndi-name=,refType=Session] because there are [2] ejbs in the application with interface com.my.infraestructura.jpa.JPALogic. 
</code></pre>

<p>I've search but it seems this kind of error appear when an interface have more than one implementation, and this is not the case: there's only one bean named ""JPALogic"" and, inspecting the ear, JPALogic.jar appear one time only. </p>

<h1>Setup for one specific project</h1>

<ul>
<li>The whole project is hosted on github.</li>
<li>The project is a complex webapplication running on a linux os (It's impossible to run it on a local development-server, neither on windows nor on mac).</li>
<li>There are 2 branches: dev and master. dev is the testing server and master is the productive server.</li>
<li>Besides from the main github repository there is a local repository on the designer's computer, one on my computer, one on the testserver and one on the production server.</li>
<li>I develop locally (on Windows). While developing there is a auto-sync script that automatically uploads all files I edit via FTP to the testing server, so I can check instantly if my changes work.</li>
<li>The designer also develops locally (on Mac), he will also have an auto-sync script that automatically uploads all his changes to the testserver via FTP, but he has just access to a special ""layout""-directory where all templates and static files (images, css, js, ...) are located. He also needs to check every few minutes if his changes or new features work.</li>
<li>Whenever the designer or me sucessfully finished and tested a new feature on the testserver we then push our changes from the local dev-branch to the remote dev-branch on github. The testing server is not touched by git so far.</li>
<li>Everyday in the morning there is a cronjob, that deletes the whole testserver directory and then does a ""git clone"" of the dev-branch of the remote repository hosted on github. That way the testserver has all new commits.</li>
<li>The designer and me have to ""git pull"" the newest updates of each other using the remote github repository every morning before any further development.</li>
<li>As soon as a feature runs well on the testserver I will merge the ""dev"" branch to ""master"" and commit the master to github.</li>
<li>Then we have a deployment that pulls the master branch from github to the production server.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Questions</h1>

<p>How do you generally handle the situation where you cannot have local development-servers for each project-member (because the application is not able run locally)? It seems really unprofessional to have one testserver where everybody can upload files via ftp to try their stuff, because it can easily happen that someone overwrites someone elses files so testing will fail. Is there a best-practice example of how to develop in a team when there is no local testing server?</p>

<p>It first shows the emulator window with a plain text ANDROID on the upper left or so. After a while it changes to the next phase (same as in the other emulator) which displays the word ANDROID with funky letter type and an animation on the letters. But it never gets past that.</p>

<p>On the working emulator it goes to the next phase which displays the Android screen unblocking , which after unblocking loads the app being tested.</p>

<p>So why is the S3 emulation NOT starting? My S3 is targetted at Android API Level 15 and in the Android SDK Manager I have the following in the Android API 15 (4.0.3):</p>

<ul>
<li>SDK Platform (installed)</li>
<li>ARMEABI v7a System Image (installed)</li>

<p>If I try the Nexus 7 emulator that was already installed by default, it does not even show the emulator screen, it only says ""This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.

<p>But one question that I can't answer by myself is how RAM access works with multiple CPUs.</p>

<h1>My thoughts</h1>

<p>We have two matrices A and B. We want to compute C = A* B:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MJ2Vk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A parallel execution will only be faster, when n,m or p are big. So suppose n, m and p >= 10,000. For simplicity, just suppose n=m=p=10,000 = 10^4.</p>

<p>We know that we  can compute each $c_{i,j}$ withouth looking at other entries of C. So we could compute every c_{i,j} in parallel:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bMDJI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But all c_{1,i}  (i \in 1,...,p) need the first line of A. As A is an array with 10^8 doubles, it needs 800 MB. This is definitely bigger than a CPU cache. But one line (80kB) will fit into a CPU cache. So I guess it is a good idea to assign every line of C to exactly one CPU (as soon as a CPU is free). So this CPU will at least have A in its cache and benefit from that.</p>

<h1>My question</h1>

<p>How is RAM access managed for the different cores (on a normal Intel notebook)?</p>

<p>I guess there has to be one ""controller"" that gives exclusive access to one CPU at a time. Does this controller have a special name?</p>

<p>By chance, two or more CPUs might need the same information. Can they get it at the same time? Is RAM access a bottleneck for the matrix multiplication problem?</p>

<p>Please let me also know when you know some good books that introduce you to multicore programming (in C++/Python/Java).</p>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: How do i get the text of a text box during <code>onKeyPress</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Bonus Chatter</h2>

<p>There are three events related to <em>""the user is typing""</em> in the HTML DOM:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>onKeyDown</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyPress</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyUp</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In <strong>Windows</strong>, the order of <code>WM_Key</code> messages becomes important when the user holds down a key, and the key begins to repeat:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>WM_KEYDOWN('a')</code> - user has pushed down the <kbd>A</kbd> key</li>
<li><code>WM_CHAR('a')</code> - an <code>a</code> character has been received from the user</li>
<li><code>WM_CHAR('a')</code> - an <code>a</code> character has been received from the user</li>
<li><code>WM_CHAR('a')</code> - an <code>a</code> character has been received from the user</li>
<li><code>WM_CHAR('a')</code> - an <code>a</code> character has been received from the user</li>
<li><code>WM_CHAR('a')</code> - an <code>a</code> character has been received from the user</li>
<li><code>WM_KEYUP('a')</code> - the user has released the <kbd>A</kbd> key</li>
</ul>

<p>Will result in five characters appearing in a text control: <code>aaaaa</code></p>

<p>The important point being that the you respond to the <code>WM_CHAR</code> message, the one that repeats. Otherwise you miss events when a key is pressed.</p>

<p>In <strong>HTML</strong> things are slightly different: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>onKeyDown</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyPress</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyDown</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyPress</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyDown</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyPress</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyDown</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyPress</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyDown</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyPress</code></li>
<li><code>onKeyUp</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Html delivers an <code>KeyDown</code> and <code>KeyPress</code> every key repeat. And the <code>KeyUp</code> event is only raised when the user releases the key.</p>

<p><strong>Take aways</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>i <strong>can</strong> respond to <code>onKeyDown</code> or <code>onKeyPress</code>, but both are still raised before the <code>input.value</code> has been updated</li>
<li>i cannot respond to <code>onKeyUp</code>, because it doesn't happen as the text in the text-box changes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do i get the text of a text-box during <code>onKeyPress</code>?</p>

<p>jQuery unobtrusive validation is working for the latter, but not the former -- i.e. it's not working for the radio buttons.</p>

<p>It's not a display issue - it's actually allowing the form to submit, and is <em>not</em> adding class 'input-validation-error' to the first radio button.</p>

<p>Anyone know what might be causing this to fail? Using jQuery 1.8, jQuery validate 1.11.1 and jQuery unobtrusive (no version). Thanks!</p>

<p>It seems like the inner div is treated like text if there is not actual text. Is there a way to eliminate this behavior?</p>

<p>I can only change the divs and not what follows, so I'd be interested in a solution that allows me to make the parent div solely determine the baseline.</p>

<p>EDIT: Not making the child <code>display: inline-block</code> also seems to work. This seems to confirm that the contents are being treated as the ""text"" that matters. I'd still like to know why.</p>

I am currently editing an existing application and am trying to add a function that will call a batch file that I have written.  This batch file runs a CLI program and does some error level checks to ensure the program executed correctly and reports any errors to the command prompt.  I do not wish to rewrite this function in C# because this batch file is useful to me when I am performing this task without the main program.  However, if rewriting this batch file's functions in C# is needed I would not know how to go about doing it.  </p>

<p>I found this code online to run my batch file, and it works quite well: </p>

<pre><code>        System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
        proc.EnableRaisingEvents = false;
        proc.StartInfo.FileName = ""C:mypath\\mybatfile.bat"";
        proc.Start();
</code></pre>

<p>My only problem with this code is that it requires me to set this path before I deploy the application.  I will be distributing this application to a few other machines, and may eventually distribute it to many more.  I would really like to find a way to somehow link this path to where the program is saved and just include this batch file in the resources of the application.  </p>

<p>This all may be very off base, and any direction provided will be greatly appreciated.  </p>

<p>I have very little knowledge of terminology used in C# and other PC programming as most of my experience is in uControllers.  </p>

<p>EDIT:  My program is a GUI .xaml application.  I have also decided that I am open to rewriting my batch file in C# because I also have some paths in my batch file that I forgot about.  is there any way to run a command prompt application and pass command line arguments and check error-levels easily?  </p>

<p>EDIT 2:  I am adding this just to help anyone that comes along this thread in the future.  this is how I eventually fixed my problem, using a suggestion from Dantix below:</p>

<pre><code>        System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
        proc.EnableRaisingEvents = false;
        string bat_path = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location; 
        proc.StartInfo.FileName = bat_path.Replace(""\\myAppName.exe, """") + ""\\myBatchFile.bat"";

The assignment statement works fine.  I had a ""while"" statement as well which had the same problem as the ""if"" statement so I am sure if I can get help to figure out why one is not working it should be easy to get the other going.

<p>I changed the default encoding of my Ubuntu system to <code>latin1</code>. Now I can open the checkedout files with an editor and they look good (thanks to @John-T at <a href=""http://superuser.com/questions/55224/change-the-default-codepage-from-latin1-to-utf8-on-a-linux-machine/55233#55233"">superuser.com</a>).</p>

<p>But Hudson still complained about <code>unmappable character for encoding ASCII</code> and I found that this is caused by maven. I found an <a href=""http://maven.apache.org/general.html#encoding-warning"" rel=""nofollow"">explantion</a>, but the suggested solution didn't work. Now maven tells me that it uses <code>latin1</code> when copying some resources, but the compiler (not using this setting?) still complains with the same error message.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who gave me suggestions. I don't think I was very clear about wanting the time points to be my x-axis as opposed to the genomic position - my apologies. Hopefully this picture clarifies that! </p>

I already have the code that connects to the control port and changes IP address. Basically it works fine with my programs, but the only drawback is that Tor is only for Socks, and it doesn't allow for multithreading with different IPs at once. My solution would be a program that runs on localhost, listens on a new port (maybe 9152), converts the protocol to HTTP, and each time a request is made through it, it will redirect it to the Tor proxy on port 9150, and then immediately change IP address. The request will still go through fine on the port on the IP it had before the IP address was changed. This way the user can 'multithread' using Tor. The only problem I have with making this is, I have no idea how to make this. So can people give me tips in the right direction?</p>

<p>This is my code for changing the IP of Tor:</p>

<pre><code>Shared Function ChangeIdentity() As Boolean

<p>I am building an HTML table based on the results of a query that returns XML that I'm converting to an HTML table using XSL.  I've been asked to add sorting, pagination and filtering.  I was able to add some javascript libraries to enable sorting and pagination, and a different library to enable the filtering.  However, since they are separate libraries, they do no cooperate, so when I filter, the table doesn't keep to the constraints of the 'entries per page' field.  </p>

<p>I made some attempts at a few jQuery solutions, but couldn't get them to work.  What I'm looking for is the best and (naturally) the easiest solution to adding pagination, column sorting and column filtering without the need to press enter or hit any buttons.  </p>

<p>Thanks very much in advance and I hope everyone has a happy and healthy new year!</p>

<ul>
<li>in details:</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm trying to figure out how to save a large set of functions using HTML interfaces to run CATscripts (Catia macros, VBscript like), that are launched via VBscripts, from the transition of my Company from IE8 to IE11 (no choices here). As discussed <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn384057(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">there in MSDN</a>, and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17483782/vbscript-support-in-internet-explorer-11"">here in Stackoverflow</a> (I've tried all solutions obviously, and the compatibility setting is not activatable), VBscript support stops in IE11</p>

<p>I have 2 sort of functions: some are static, and stored on our intranet website. They still work on IE11 (Edge mode if i understood, although i couldn't find exactly what it mean)</p>

<p>But some other are written on the fly, on users computer, to generate an interface reflecting what's currently in Catia. Those don't work anymore on IE11, and are the most important. It seems they are considered ""internet zone"", which I don't understand since they are locally written. is that to prevent malware?</p>

<p>here is how i call the function from the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type='button' value='00-10' onclick='StartScript(me)' id='import-zip-from-DB'/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and here is the VBscript (simplified but functional):</p>

<pre><code>Sub StartScript(button)
    Dim aParams()
    Dim sName
    Dim sPath
    Dim CATIA
    sName = button.Id
    sPath = ""C:\temp\""
    'Get Catia object
    Set CATIA = GetObject(, ""CATIA.Application"")
    'run the script in catia
    On Error Resume Next
    CATIA.SystemService.ExecuteScript sPath, 1, sName &amp; "".CATScript"", ""CATMain"", aParams
    If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then MsgBox Err.Description, vbCritical, ""QC2 toolset""
    On Error GoTo 0
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried Javascript, with a really similar function. the code to get Catia Object is <code>var CATIA = new ActiveXObject(""CATIA.Application"");</code></p>

<p>My question is this: I had never even heard of using EAFP as the primary data validation construct, coming from a Java and C++ background. Is EAFP something that is wise to use in Java? Or is there too much overhead from exceptions? I know that there is only overhead when an exception is actually thrown, so I'm unsure as to why the simpler method of EAFP is not used. Is it just preference?</p>

This pops up every time  user requests large sets of data. While the database is retrieving the data, the user sees a small form with the text ""Please wait"" and a gif progressbar-like thingy. </p>

<p>The problem I encounter is that I launch this form in a second thread using a backgroundworker. This is fine, I see it pop up, but it doens't close when the loading is done. I used the code supplied by microsoft MSDN. This is the code I have now, but the closing never happens. I debugged the code, and see that the bgw.cancellationpending never gets to true, even though I call the CancelAsync() method.</p>

<p>showLoading is called before the database call, cancelLoading() is called after the database call is completed.</p>

<p>What is wrong and what should I change?</p>

<p>I compile it with:</p>

<pre><code>$ javac -classpath :/usr/local/hadoop-1.0.3/hadoop-core-1.0.3.jar:/home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar:/home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar:/home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar -d myjavac/ SeqPrep.java
</code></pre>

<p>I jar it:</p>

<pre><code>$ jar -cvf SeqPrep.jar -C myjavac/ .
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'd like to run it on my local hadoop node. I've tried:</p>

<pre><code> hadoop jar SeqPrep.jar org.help.SeqPrep
</code></pre>

<p>But I get:</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/mahout/math/Vector

<p>So I tried using the libjars parameter: </p>

<pre><code>$ hadoop jar SeqPrep.jar org.help.SeqPrep -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/math/target/mahout-math-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/math/target/mahout-math-0.8-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar
</code></pre>

<p>and got the same problem. I don't know what else to try.</p>

<p>My eventual goal is to be able to read a .csv file on the hadoop fs into a sparse matrix and then multiply it by a random vector.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Looks like Razvan got it (note: see below for another way to do this that does not mess with your hadoop installation). For reference:</p>

<pre><code>$ find /usr/local/hadoop-1.0.3/. |grep mah

<p>and then:</p>

<pre><code>$hadoop jar SeqPrep.jar org.help.SeqPrep

</code></pre>

<p><strong>edit:</strong>  I'm trying to do this without copying the mahout jars into the hadoop lib/</p>

<pre><code>$ rm /usr/local/hadoop-1.0.3/lib/mahout-*
</code></pre>

<p>and then of course:</p>

<pre><code>hadoop jar SeqPrep.jar org.help.SeqPrep

Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: SeqPrep.jar
</code></pre>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Apparently I can only send one jar at a time to hadoop. This means I need to add the class I made into the mahout core job file:</p>

<pre><code>~/mahout/trunk/core/target$ cp mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar_backup

~/mahout/trunk/core/target$ jar uf mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar SeqPrep.class

<p>And then:</p>

<pre><code>~/mahout/trunk/core/target$ hadoop jar mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar org.help.SeqPrep

Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.help.SeqPrep

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Ok, now I can do it without messing with my hadoop installation. I was updating the .jar wrong in that previous edit. It should be:</p>

<pre><code>~/mahout/trunk/core/target$ jar uf mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar org/help/SeqPrep.class

        &lt;?php }

       }
    ?&gt;
   &lt;/select&gt;

<p>Initially all the subcategories are display:none except the select one . all the subcategory has class which is its main category.
Now when I change the category I hide all the subcategories, take the value of selected
category and show() the subcategories whose class is the value which I got from category like this</p>

<pre><code>     $('#category').change(function () {
                $(""#subcategory"").children('option').hide();
                var cate = document.getElementById('category').value;
                cate = cate.split(' ').join('_');
                if (cate != '') {
                    $('.' + cate).show();
                    $('.axyzb').show();
                }

            })
</code></pre>

<p>basically I want to show subcategories according to the selected category..above code works fine for me in firefox but in chrome it does not work for two categories .when I check the console the initial display:none is removed from the html but still those subcategories are not shown on the page.</p>

<p>Unknown column 't.login' in 'where clause'.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Yes, that would solve a problem. I created this sub query why I'm using the Yii Framework, and the has_one relationships there is no limit, ie if one 'cliente' with millions of 'acct', the framework seeks all 'acct', to take only one this gives some GB of traffic and is very slow. To solve, I used the subquery seeking only the newest id to get the 'cliente' and the last 'acct' and make it work in Active Record, until then everything was fine, but the search was slow estremamente to seek a record took 40 seconds, then I discovered that the problem was in the 'ORDER BY' (radacctid is an index and tables are innodb), hence I did to solve the 'ORDER BY' outside the subquery, then resolvou, the problem that the subquery column the table 'cliente' (t.login) is like there, as I explained above.</p>

<p>I've tried also sort by another field, eg 'acctstarttime', and continued slow, only solved when I did it this way:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `radacctid` FROM
              (SELECT radacctid
                 FROM `radacct` `fUzDDUDv` 
                WHERE username = t.login
              ) AS `fUzDDUDv` ORDER BY `radacctid` DESC LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>But the problem of INNER JOIN is that if there is no result for 'acct' does not return the 'cliente'.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>The problem is not where the <code>t</code>.<code>login</code> but it is not recognized as existing within the subquery that I can not put 'out' if the order is not slow.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Read my comments? This is the situation. It really is only on the production server that has inserts and updates all the time.</p>

In addition to downloading the data from internet it also shows it in widget in a ViewFlipper.</p>

<p>When I add the widget to the home screen, it fires onUpdate immediately, downloads the data from internet and updates the widget. This works just fine. Log shows <code>onUpdate</code> and <code>dataDownloaded</code> with about 3 sec apart.
On the next update (phone has gone to sleep mode), the update doesn't happen and this is what my logs report.</p>

<ul>
<li>onUpdate is called.</li>
<li><code>dataDownloading</code> is called, but after 20 seconds after <code>onUpdate</code> has been initially called. I assume this is because the phone was in sleep and it takes time to initialize networks sockets etc.</li>
<li>After this, I get the ANR log entry and widget update doesn't happen, process is practically dead, widget stays on screen and doesn't respond to manual updates from within activity, which otherwise works when no ANR exception is thrown.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm looking for a possible solution to this. I was thinking about calling all the downloads in a different thread (from within the AppWidgetProvider, possibly using <code>AsyncTask</code>), store data in SQLite or local storage and doing the widget  update (no downloads, just reading the data from SQLite and local storage) on the next <code>onUpdate</code> call. This would make the application/widget process more responsive and not fault into ANR.</p>

<p>Is this threading approach a bad practice? Is there an alternative? Should I use service instead? I'm inclined not to use a service, unless there's a lot of pros for it.</p>

<p>How do we deploy both of these EARs to Wildfly?</p>

<p>If TeamA had the budget to test and get certified using <code>librayX-v2.jar</code>, then the obvious solution would be to upgrade that module within Wildfly.</p>

<p>When we add <code>libraryX-v2.jar</code> to <code>TeamB.ear</code>, we get the following exception:</p>

<p>The UDF makes a call out via JNI to a C++ program for each row to calculate the return data so it would be preferable to only have to make the call once per input row for performance reasons.</p>

<p>Will hive call the normalise function twice - once for each time it is used in this statement - or will it see both calls have the same argument and only call it once, cache the output, and use the cache rather than making the call a second time?</p>

The following clients (from now CLIENTAPP): 
Client1, Client2, UserClient2, .., UserClientXX 
have a Microsoft .Net application that interact with mysql cluster database. </p>

<p>After a while the My sql cluster configuration appears to work correctly and any of CLIENTAPP it's able to connect to MYSQL-D1 or MYSQL-D2 (this is possibile by changing the connection string of .NET client application and pointing to IP of MYSQL-D1 or to the IP of MYSQL-D2).</p>

<p>In a perfect world CLIENTAPP automatically it's able to connect to the right server (MYSQL-D1 or MYSQL-D2), pratically:
    - if MYSQL-D1 it's down CLIENTAPP connect to MYSQL-D2 
    - if MYSQL-D2 it's down CLIENTAPP connect to MYSQL-D1 </p>

<p>How .NET client application can interact with mysql cluster? </p>

<p>The best solutions I have found for my scenario are the followings: 
    1. use mysql proxy but this is in a alpha stage and I can't use it in production enviroment
    2. install cluster data node on each CLIENTAPP 
    3. use a connection string that support multiple servers (I don't know if it's supported by mysql .NET connector)
    4. rewrite my application to interact with both MYSQL-DX node (what I want to avoid)</p>

Somewhere in my script i am reading text file outputted from other app, and creating materials and image maps from the lines of this text file. one of the things i am doing there is creating a dictionary of the channel names from this text file, and mapping each channel name to the modo's internal channel name, so modo could understand what to do with this channels. This is a snippet that doing it:</p>

<pre><code># this is a dictionary of the channel names in the textures.txt file
# mapped to modo's internal channel names
channels = {'color':'diffColor', 'specular':'specAmount', 'normalmap':'normal'}
for channel in channels:
    if channel in materials[mat].keys():
============AND SO ON==============
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works as expected, but there is one more channel - displacement. And the problem is that it's not just a string as other channels, but a string followed by a float number, which is a scale factor for displacement, like this:
displacement 19.378531</p>

<p>For now i want just to create displacement image map in modo, as i am already doing with other maps (color, normals, specular), without using this 'scale factor' number in any way. It seems easy enough, and i have tried to use Regular Expression to match string ""displacement"" followed by random float number, but it does not works (or, i do not use it properly)!</p>

<p>How can i tell python to do instead of </p>

<pre><code>channels = {'color':'diffColor', 'specular':'specAmount', 'normalmap':'normal', 'displacement':'displace'}
</code></pre>

<p>to do this:</p>

<pre><code>channels = {'color':'diffColor', 'specular':'specAmount', 'normalmap':'normal', 'displacement' + 'ANY_FLOAT_NUMBER':'displace'}

<p>I have a <code>.txt</code> file that is about 2MB and about 16,000 lines long.  Each record length is 160 characters with a blocking factor of 10.  This is an older type of data structure which almost looks like a tab-delimited file, but the separation is by single-chars/white-spaces.</p>

<p>First, I <code>glob</code> a directory for <code>.txt</code> files - there is never more than one file in the directory at a time, so this attempt may be inefficient in itself.  </p>

<pre><code>my $txt_file = glob ""/some/cheese/dir/*.txt"";
</code></pre>

<p>Then I open the file with this line:</p>

<pre><code>open (F, $txt_file) || die (""Could not open $txt_file"");
</code></pre>

<p>As per the data dictionary for this file, I'm parsing each ""field"" out of each line using Perl's <code>substr()</code> function within a while loop. </p>

<pre><code>while ($line = &lt;F&gt;)
{
$nom_stat   = substr($line,0,1);
$lname      = substr($line,1,15);
$fname      = substr($line,16,15);
$mname      = substr($line,31,1);
$address    = substr($line,32,30);
$city       = substr($line,62,20);
$st         = substr($line,82,2);
$zip        = substr($line,84,5);
$lnum       = substr($line,93,9);
$cl_rank    = substr($line,108,4);
$ceeb       = substr($line,112,6);
$county     = substr($line,118,2);
$sex        = substr($line,120,1);
$grant_type = substr($line,121,1);

$acad_idx   = substr($line,125,3);

This approach takes a lot of time to process each line and I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way of getting each field out of each line of the file.</p>

I have been asked to solve a bug in a web application.
I have a date coming from a web form, the user is supposed to enter a valid date in a given format <code>dd/MM/yyyy</code>.</p>

<p>The application is using Struts 1.3 as a framework, and this is what I found in validate method of the corresponding FormBean.</p>

<pre><code>DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat( ""dd/MM/yyyy"", aLocale ); 
try{
     mydate = dateFormat.parse( formDate );
}
catch( ParseException pe ){
     errors.add( ""error"", new ActionError( ""error.date.invalid"" ) );
}
</code></pre>

<p>However it's happening that the error is not raised for example when user enter year in short format, i.e. <code>01/10/12</code>, which is converted into a date, looking in database I found <code>01/10/0012</code>.</p>

<p>As a quick fix I tried to use <code>setLenient(false)</code>, but the exception is still not raised, and mydate still results in a valid but wrong date.</p>

<p>Before going to mess with regex and string pre parsing, I was wondering if I am missing something. Especially when locale is used within date format instantiation.</p>

<p><code>DataInputStream</code> is an <code>InputStream</code> subclass, hence it reads and writes bytes. If you are reading bytes and you know they are all going to be <code>int</code>s or some other primitive data type, then you can read those <code>byte</code>s directly into the primitive using <code>DataInputStream</code>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Question: <em>Would you would need to know the type (int, string, etc) of the content being read before it is read? And would the whole file need to consist of that one primitive type?</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The question I am having is</strong>: Why not use an <code>InputStreamReader</code> wrapped around the <code>InputStream</code>'s byte data? With this approach you are still reading the bytes, then converting them to integers that represent characters. Which integers represent which characters depends on the character set specified, e.g., ""UTF-8"".</p>

<ul>
<li>Question: <em>In what case would an <code>InputStreamReader</code> fail to work where a <code>DataInputStream</code> would work?</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My guess answer</strong>: If speed is really important, and you can do it, then converting the <code>InputStream</code>'s byte data directly to the primitive via <code>DataInputStream</code> would be the way to go? This avoids the <code>Reader</code> having to ""cast"" the byte data to an <code>int</code> first; and it wouldn't rely on providing a character set to interpret which character is being represented by the returned integer. I suppose this is   what people mean by <code>DataInputStream</code> allows for a machine-indepent read of the underlying data.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplification: <code>DataInputStream</code> can convert bytes directly to primitives.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question that spurred the whole thing</strong>: I was reading the following tutorial code:</p>

<pre><code>    FileInputStream fis = openFileInput(""myFileText"");

    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader( new DataInputStream(fis)));

    EditText editText = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.edit_text);

    String line;

    while(  (line = reader.readline()) != null){

        editText.append(line);
        editText.append(""\n"");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>...I do not understand why the instructor chose to use <code>new DataInputStream(fis)</code> because it doesn't look like any of the ability to directly convert from bytes to primitives is being leveraged? </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Am I missing something?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>private void <strong><em>taxi2</em></strong>_Click (....)</p>

<p>and the call.DisplayName=""<strong><em>Calling Taxi 2</em></strong>"";</p>

<p>and call.PhoneNumber = ""<strong><em>1422222</em></strong>"";</p>

<p>Maybe I should use only one function like</p>

<pre><code>        private void PhoneCall_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
         {
          string number="""";
          HttpUtility.UrlEncode((sender as Button).Tag.ToString());
    if (NavigationContext.QueryString.TryGetValue(""number"", out number))
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(number))
            {
         PhoneCallTask call = new PhoneCallTask();
        call.DisplayName = ""Taxi"";
          call.PhoneNumber = number;
        call.Show();
         }
}
}

and &lt;Button ....... Tag=""141111"" .. /&gt;

<p><strong>[Problem Context]</strong></p>

<p>I am developing an application which will be deployed in two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>an XML Importer tool: its role is to Load/Read an xml file in order to fill some datastructures, which are afterwards serialized into a binary file.</li>
<li>the end user application: it will Load the binary file generated by the XML Importer and do some stuff with the recovered data structures.</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, I only use the XML Importer for both purposes (meaning I first load the xml and save it to a binary file, then I reopen the XML Importer and load my binary file). </p>

<p><strong>[Actual Problem]</strong></p>

<p>This works just fine and I am able to recover all the data I had after XML loading, <strong>as long as I do that with the same build of my XML Importer</strong>. This is not viable, as I will need at the very least two different builds, one for the XML Importer and one for the end user application. Please note that the two versions of the XML Importer I use for my testing are <strong>exactly the same concerning the source code and thus the datastructures</strong>, the only difference lies in the build number (to force a different build I just add a space somewhere and build again).</p>

<p>So what I'm trying to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build a version of my XML Importer</li>
<li>Open the XML Importer, load an XML file and save the resulting datastructures to a binary file</li>
<li>Rebuild the XML Importer</li>
<li>Open the XML Importer newly built, load the previously created binary file and recover my datastructures.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this time, I get an Exception:</p>

<pre><code>SerializationException: Could not find type 'System.Collections.Generic.List`1[[Grid, 74b7fa2fcc11e47f8bc966e9110610a6, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null]]'.

</code></pre>

<p>For your information (don't know if useful or not), the actual type it is struggling to deserialize is a List, Grid being a custom Class (which is correctly serializable, as I am able to do it when using the same version of XML Importer).</p>

<p><strong>[Potential Solution]</strong></p>

<p>I do believe it comes from somewhere around the Assembly, as I read many posts and articles about this. However, I already have a custom Binder taking care of the differences of Assembly names, looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>public sealed class VersionDeserializationBinder : SerializationBinder
{ 
    public override Type BindToType( string assemblyName, string typeName )
    { 
        if ( !string.IsNullOrEmpty( assemblyName ) &amp;&amp; !string.IsNullOrEmpty( typeName ) )
        { 
            Type typeToDeserialize = null; 
            assemblyName = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().FullName; 
            // The following line of code returns the type. 
            typeToDeserialize = Type.GetType( String.Format( ""{0}, {1}"", typeName, assemblyName ) ); 

            return typeToDeserialize; 
        } 

        return null; 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>which I assign to the BinaryFormatter before deserializing here:</p>

<pre><code>    public static SaveData Load (string filePath) 
    {
        SaveData data = null;//new SaveData ();
        Stream stream;

        stream = File.Open(filePath, FileMode.Open);


        BinaryFormatter bformatter = new BinaryFormatter();
        bformatter.Binder = new VersionDeserializationBinder(); 
        data = (SaveData)bformatter.Deserialize(stream);
        stream.Close();

        Debug.Log(""Binary version loaded from "" + filePath);

        return data; 
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Do any of you guys have an idea on how I could fix it? Would be awesome, pretty please :)</p>

<p>I get the average interest rate paid over the life of the loan.  For example: if the loan has a 4% rate for the first 24 payments and then the rate is raised to 6% for the last 336 payments. </p>

<pre><code>AverageOverallRate = ( (4/12 * 24 ) +  ( 6/12 * 336 ) / 360 ) * 12 
</code></pre>

<p>This will give me an Average Interest Rate of of 5.866%</p>

<p>I then try and take this “Average Interest Rate” and find the effective APR (taking into account compounding) using this formula. </p>

<pre><code>Math.pow( 1 + ( averageOverallRate / 12 ), 12) – 1
</code></pre>

<p>Or I try to figure the effective APR (taking into account origination fees) by first solving for the payment that would result from borrowing the Principal + Origination Fees at the AverageOverallRate. Then once I know what that payment would have been I use a guess check method to evaluate what the rate would be for that same payment amount but for the original principal amount (without fees). (I am using the method explained here <a href=""http://www.efunda.com/formulae/finance/apr_calculator.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.efunda.com/formulae/finance/apr_calculator.cfm</a> )</p>

<p>I have both the above formulas working for fixed rate loans so I believe I am implementing them correctly(that is my calculations correspond to the many online calculators).  However, whey I try to calculate with the average interest rate for an ARM my calculations do not equal what the other online ARM APR calculators show (like this one: <a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/annual-percentage-rate-apr-calculator.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/annual-percentage-rate-apr-calculator.aspx</a> ).  </p>

<p>How are you supposed to calculate the ARP for an APR?  Are you able to do it with simply average out the interest rate over the life of the loan or is this the wrong approach. </p>

<p>Say I want to use <a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/polymer-dart/"" rel=""nofollow"">Polymer.dart</a> in my project. So, in my project root, I create the following <code>pubspec.yaml</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-yaml prettyprint-override""><code>name: test_dart
description: A sample web application
dependencies:
    browser: any
    polymer: ""&gt;=0.9.0 &lt;0.10.0""
</code></pre>

<p>I then run <code>pub get</code>, which goes to the <code>pub</code> repo and fetches the <code>browser</code> and <code>polymer</code> dependencies that I've specified. It then creates a <code>packages</code> directory in my project root, which now means I have a project that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>MyDartProject/
    pubspec.yaml
    myapp.dart
    packages/
        browser/
            ...
        ...all the packages that ship with Polymer
</code></pre>

<p>Now I start coding my Dart web app (<code>myapp.dart</code>), which will references various Polymer and <code>browser</code> types/functions/etc. in its source code.</p>

<p>When I'm all done, I want to create a JavaScript file called <code>myapp.js</code>.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart2js.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>dart2js</code> docs</a>, I need to run something like:</p>

Since public information about this framework is extremely scarce. (A link above and a blog post at Google Research)</p>

<p>I know there are ""min"" files for javascript and css, but what about optimizing PHP scripts. Of course you will want to keep a copy of the scripts in human readable format. However, for the version running on the production server, will it perform better if it is ""optimized"" by removing all of the unecessary space and newline / tab characters? </p>

  <p>For example, given this:</p>

  <p>GHC will represent the type T like this:</p>

  <p>eliminating the tuple. This is commonly used to put unboxed Ints directly in a constructor:</p>

<pre><code>data T = T Int#

<p>I was wondering, <strong>does this also work when the field to be unpacked is polymorphic?</strong> For example, if I define</p>

<p>Now what I want to do, is to convert matrix, x and y values to css attributes.For Example, T here is superscript and N is subscript and this is done by tarnsform,x and y attributes AND I want to translate this sub/super script effect to css in HTML document.
I have found a python script wich called svg2css and another one which called svg2html, but I cant find any information about how to test them.
This is svg2css script:<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/svg2css/files/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/svg2css/files/</a><br>
And this is svg2html script:<a href=""http://jspoker.pokersource.info/jpoker-1.0.16/test-svg2html.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jspoker.pokersource.info/jpoker-1.0.16/test-svg2html.py</a> <br>
I have found this also, it seems to be a test code for svg2html script:

Hi friends, finally I have found a way to test svg2css python script, but it results in error message:
I tried to use svg2css inkscape extension in python, which converts an svg file to its equivalent css+html, but it resulted in no output with a warning message:</p>

<blockquote>

  My svg file is very simple, it just contains one text tag, I tried to generate the css+html from these svg formats:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>plain svg</li>
<li>inkscape svg</li>
<li>optimized svg
but all of these resluted in no output with same error message.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>This is the Error Log file generated in \Users\staff\Application Data\inkscape:<br></p>

I was going through lesson 1 on the Sunshine app where the lecturer chose to create fake data by declaring an array of strings and then converting it to an ArrayList. </p>

<p>The code is the following: </p>

<pre><code>String[] data = {
            ""Mon 6/23 - Sunny - 31/17"",
            ""Tue 6/24 - Foggy - 21/8"",

    };
    List&lt;String&gt; weatherForecast = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(data));

<p>I was wondering is there any advantage to using this convertion method? Why not just immediately declare the data as an ArrayList as such: </p>

<pre><code>    ArrayList weatherForecast = new ArrayList();
    weatherForecast.add(""Today - Sunny - 88/63"");

) minDateExpires on p2c.category_id = minDateExpires.category_id
ORDER BY available, expiring

        return $query-&gt;rows;

The page dynamically generates a list of ""Environments"" and for each environment the table contains a nested table that lists out each ""Item"" in that environment. I'm having some big time trouble rewriting this with CSS (I'm primarily a back end dev). The existing table needs each nested table to be collapsible so you start with only seeing the header for each nested table, and expand to see the body by clicking a little plus img.

<p>I have a marker with an InfoWindow which works fine except on iOS. When I rotate the device, the google map API doesn't seem to calculate the size well and the infoWindow is too small for its content. I reckon this is the same bug as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24619738/infowindow-appears-minimum-size-no-matter-what?lq=1"">this one</a> </p>

<p>So I have been trying to access the InfoWindow object to close it and open it again to force google to redraw/recalculate but couldn't find a way to access it. 
I can access the google.maps.Map object by using  <em>$scope.map.control.getGMap()</em> in angular but can't access the InfoWindow. I can see a getGWindows in  Window.prototype but no idea how to access it from the map. I can access the markers as well but they don't have a reference to their infowindow.</p>

<p>Here is the way I create the marker in case it can be of any help:</p>

<pre><code>var marker = {
    id: obj.id,
    name: obj.name,
    latitude: obj.lat,
    longitude: obj.lng,
    address: obj.address,
    suburbCity: obj.suburbCity,
    state: obj.state,
    postcodeZip: obj.postcodeZip,
    icon: ""xxx.png""),
    options: {
        labelContent: obj.name,
        labelClass: ""none"",
        labelAnchor:""25 0"", 
        opacity: 0.25,
        animation: google.maps.Animation.DROP,
        visible: true
    },
    templateurl:'markerwindow.tpl.html',
    templateparameter: data,
    closeClick: function() {
        marker.options.visible = false;
        return $scope.$apply();
    },
    onClicked: function() {
        navigateToMarkerOnMap(marker);
    }
};

$scope.map.markers.push(marker);


function navigateToMarkerOnMap(marker) {
    $scope.selected.options.visible = false;
    $scope.selected = marker;
    $scope.selected.options.visible = true;
}

I don't see the usefulness of Pub / Sub with this limitation, as we are usually using Redis not just as a message queue.  So if you can't do any Redis commands from a subscription callback, you just end up making your own message handler instead of using Pub / Sub, don't you?  </p>

<p>In short, my question is how to properly use Pub / Sub such that you can access Redis when a message comes in?  If there is no way, then Pub / Sub can't be used for many applications.  - I am not posting code because I already know the code to create a Pub / Sub connection.  I am looking for software pattern / architectural advice and affirmation that this is a problem.</p>

<li>be ""lightweight"" (have low overhead) as many other processes would also be running with it</li>
<li>output videos with minimal file size </li>

<p>I am aware of <a href=""http://camstudio.org"" rel=""nofollow"">CamStudio</a> and the <a href=""http://download.cnet.com/Easy-Screen-Capture-Video/3000-13633_4-10288385.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Easy Screen Capture Video</a> program,
but I don't need such software. I need a simple function or module in C# .NET so that I can integrate, optimize or customize it as per my needs. Please don't recommend software.</p>

<p>I know how to capture a single image as shown here:</p>

<pre><code> private static void CaptureScreen()
    {
        Size s = Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Size;
        Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(s.Width, s.Height);
        Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bmp);
        g.CopyFromScreen(0, 0, 0, 0, s);
        bmp.Save(""C:\\d.jpg"");    //location to save image
    }
</code></pre>

<p>but I don't know how to get a video in some avi or different video formats.</p>

<p>This isn't for spyware. I just want to monitor all my daily activity once I log on and keep it in video. Then in the future it might be possible to search the recorded sessions.</p>

<p>I am trying to find out this common view 'p' among m and n subviews. Obviously the brute force approach of O(m*n) works fine to get the common view p. But I would like to know if there is a better efficient algorithm that I can use to get that one unique common view which is present in both V1 and V2.</p>

<p>V1 = {B, K, L, P, O, B, C, A, Q, R}

<p>Running brute-force gives me O as the answer in O(m*n). Here the views O and O have same class.
As pointed out in the comments, I am NOT looking for views which have same frame.</p>

<p>Any efficient way to do this?</p>

    NSMutableSet *s = [[NSMutableSet alloc] initWithCapacity:[[a1 subviews] count]];
    for (UIView *a1SubViews in [a1 subviews]) {

        }
    }
    NSLog(@""NO common subview"");

<p>I assume the INFO messages come from the WebDriver library but I don't know how to change the log level. Any ideas?</p>

<p>BTW, I already tried:</p>

<pre><code>LoggingPreferences logs = new LoggingPreferences();
logs.enable(LogType.DRIVER, Level.OFF);
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.LOGGING_PREFS, logs);
driver = new FirefoxDriver(capabilities);
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("""");
logger.setLevel(Level.WARNING);
</code></pre>

<p>without luck, although with the latter INFO messages stop being printed in the Eclipse console.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Setting the standard java.util.logger logLevel to e.g. WARNING (as shown above) at the right place, in my case inside a @BeforeClass method, solved the issue.</p>

<p>And myapp-core.zip file really does not exist in the .m2 repository.
Although it does create proper directory chain there but it contains only resolver-status.properties file.
I went through the Grails documentation and Manning book but still cannot find the resolution.
In plain old Java with maven it is a piece of cake, but in Grails, despite all the claims of how easy and straightforward it is, I beating my head against this wall for a week.</p>

<p>I have a list of tuples representing partial string matches in a sentence:</p>

<pre><code>[(0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 4), (2,6), (23, 2), (22, 6), (26, 2), (26, 2), (26, 2)]

<p>The first value of each tuple is the start position for the match, the second value is the length. </p>

<p>The idea is to collapse the list so that only the longest continue string match is reported. In this case it would be:</p>

<pre><code>[(0,4), (2,6), (22,6)]

<p>I do not want just the longest range, like in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4593583"">algorithm to find longest non-overlapping sequences</a>, but I want all the ranges collapsed by the longest.</p>

<p>In case your wondering, I am using a pure python implementation of the Aho-Corasick for matching terms in a static dictionary to the given text snippet.</p>

<p>EDIT: Due to the nature of these tuple lists, overlapping but not self-contained ranges should be printed out individually. For example, having the words <code>betaz</code> and <code>zeta</code> in the dictionary, the matches for <code>betazeta</code> are <code>[(0,5),(4,8)]</code>. Since these ranges overlap, but none is contained in the other, the answer should be <code>[(0,5),(4,8)]</code>. I have also modified the input dataset above so that this case is covered.</p>

a[0] = (1.1, 1, 'this\0', 'to\0')
a[1] = (2.1, 2, 'that\0', 'ta\0')
a[2] = (3.1, 3, 'dogs\0', 'ot\0')

<p>(Note: the problem described below occurs with or without the null terminator)</p>

<p>I then have the cython code:</p>

cimport numpy as np

cdef packed struct tstruct:
    np.float32_t a
    np.int32_t b
    char[5] c
    char[3] d

<pre><code>ValueError: Expected a dimension of size 5, got 8
</code></pre>

<p>If in the array and corresponding struct are reordered such that the fields containing strings are not adjacent to each other, then the function works as expected. It appears as if the Cython function is not detecting the boundary between the <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> fields correctly and thinks as if you are passing in a char array of the sum of the lengths. </p>

<p>Short of reshuffling the data (which is possible but not ideal), is there another way to pass a recarray with fixed length string data into Cython?</p>

"6205569","1","6206713","","2011-06-01 17:54:51","","3","2504","<p>I want to put a light in the scene that is fixed at a certain spot. Here's what the <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/lights.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenGL site</a> has to say about this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How can I make my light stay fixed relative to my scene? How can I put a light in the corner and make it stay there while I change my view?</strong></p>
  
  <p>As your view changes, your ModelView matrix also changes. This means you'll need to respecify the light position, usually at the start of every frame. A typical application will display a frame with the following pseudocode:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>Set the view transform.</em></li>
  <li>*Set the light position //glLightfv(GL_LIGHT_POSITION,…)*</li>
  <li><em>Send down the scene or model geometry.</em></li>
  <li><em>Swap buffers.</em></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If your light source is part of a light fixture, you also may need to specify a modeling transform, so the light position is in the same location as the surrounding fixture geometry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I added this to the <code>paintGL()</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glPushMatrix();
gluLookAt(0.0, 5.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
GLfloat l0pos[] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0};
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_POSITION, l0pos);
glPopMatrix();
</code></pre>

<p>It seems okay when I'm standing still, but when I move the camera's eye position or the camera's center position, the light flickers. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update2</strong>: I ended up using this code, but I'm still having issues. The light no longer moves, but its position isn't accurate. The matrix on top of the stack is the matrix generated by a <code>gluLookAt</code> command that represents the camera position.</p>

<pre><code>glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glPushMatrix();
glTranslatef(xCoordinate, yCoordinate, zCoordinate);
GLfloat lpos[] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, w};
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_POSITION, lpos);
glPopMatrix();

<p>I am trying to figure out the best ""standard"" picture dimensions (WxH) that I should use to deliver these photos on the devices so that quality is preserved (best possible look and feel for the device) but transfer size stays acceptable. </p>

<p>For example I believe that a 5184 x 3456 picture is overkill even for a High res tablet or ipad. </p>

<p>So my question really comes to what is the best ""standard""/cross platform image dimensions that will fit most of the tablets out there while preserving the original high resolution feel of the picture. </p>

<p>I'm also thinking about a couple of scenarios :</p>

<p>1 -  build a server side database of all the pictures in different dimensions and depending on the requesting device, deliver the the picture with dimensions that matches best the dimensions of the screen's device. </p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>2- use one standard MAX picture size that the device will need to dynamically scale down at runtime. In which case, what is the standard MAX picture size that I should use to cover most tablets and smart phones. </p>

<p>Hope I'm clear enough. </p>

<p>Thanks for your insights. </p>

How do you write a compiler for a language in the language itself? It seems like it would be just text without anything to compile it into an executable that could then compile the future code written in Ruby. I get confused just typing that sentence. Can anyone help explain this?</p>

This tree of objects can be quite large, and can be subject to very frequent modifications (e.g. adding or removing a node, changing some properties of a node, and so on) by more users. Now, every time an update is published by an user, I need to be able to get some hash of the tree as it is after the user modified it, so that the user can sign the update with his private RSA key. Therefore I obviously need the hash to be cryptographically secure. However, hashing a linear representation of the whole tree over and over every time an user changes just one node is unfeasible.</p>

<p>I thought about this strategy, but I am not sure if that will work out properly:</p>

<ul>
<li>I add to each node of a new field, that is the SHA256 hash of all its children nodes. </li>
<li>The hash of a node is now the hash of each of the fields of the node, therefore included the hash of its children.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, updating the tree should be easy: every time I update a node, I change the hash field of its parent, then it's grandparent and so on until the root is reached, and use the hash of the root as hash value. This would reduce the complexity of this operation to O(ln(N)) rather than O(N).</p>

<p>However, I know that it is never safe to trust one's own intuition about cryptography. So is this procedure secure?</p>

<p>But check this second code, If I try to use <code>char juices[][20]</code> instead of <code>char *juices[]</code> , the compiler give error, I want to know why?</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    size_t len = strlen(s);
    char *t = s + len - 1;
    while (t &gt;= s) {
        printf(""%c"", *t);
        t = t - 1; //pointer arithmetic
    }

    char *juices[] = { ""dragonfruit"", ""waterberry"", ""sharonfruit"", ""uglifruit"",

    a = juices[2];
    juices[2] = juices[8];
    juices[8] = a;
    puts(juices[8]);
    print_reverse(juices[(18 + 7) / 5]);

    puts(juices[2]);
    print_reverse(juices[9]);
    juices[1] = juices[3];
    puts(juices[10]);
    print_reverse(juices[1]);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is quite strange, because if you check third code below, it will give error because pointer to a string literal can not be updated. If the thing is like this, then in second code <code>char *juices[]</code> is array of pointers to string literals, and then <code>juices[2]</code> is a pointer to <code>""sharonfruit""</code>, how can it be updated?</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{

char *cards = ""JQK"";  //you should use char cards[]=""JQK"";
char a_card = cards[2];

cards[2] = cards[1];
cards[1] = cards[0];
cards[0] = cards[2];
cards[2] = cards[1];
cards[1] = a_card;

puts(cards);

return 0;

<p>The repository no longer contains the <strong>1.4.0.6</strong> version of the package (which was relevant a couple of months ago), but rather the new version of it (e.g., <strong>1.5.1.6</strong>).</p>

<p>Why doesn't NuGet find the new versions of the packages? Is there some syntax I can specify in packages.config to ensure that the latest versions will be downloaded?</p>

<p>Try to follow this example: We'll call the application I'm talking about ""application A"". Now we want to roll out an application B to one of these locations and it must implement application A. We'll have to modify A to accept B's requirements. However, our development version of A (the version that eventually each location will have) must have support for B as well. This means we have to rollback to the state of the software running on the site requiring B as well as make these changes to our development version of A. This also means that the 4 other locations are implementing a version of A without B support.</p>

<p>So one can see where it gets frustrating to control the versioning. If we want to support sites 2-5 we can't use our development version of the source, we have to rollback to the specific version on that site. What's the best way to do this?

<p>I advise just using 1 or 2 disks for testing as it may get confusing otherwise.</p>

<p>The main part you wan to be looking at is in <strong>def TokenButtonRelease(self, event)</strong> and where it states <strong>self.canvas.move(self._drag_data[""item""], self._pole1_data[""x""]-event.x, self._pole1_data[""y""]-event.y)</strong></p>

<p>The problem is the ""-event.x"" and ""-event.y"", as I really want to be minus'ing the centre point of the object. So my main question is how do I find this and how do I state that I want this to be the value that has to be taken away. You will notice that the object snaps to a certain position, but if you grab the object at different points, it will obviously snap to a slightly different point.</p>

<p>The intention here is for the custom View to be self sufficient and not need additional handling from the Activity.  The way to do that would be for it to listen for when its parent was backgrounded and for it to then let the infinite sleep loop in the Thread expire.

view.GroupDescriptions.Add(groups);
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to have each group in an expander, so they can be hidden. I have got this working by looking at GroupTemplates at MSDN This involves, having an expander, textblock and then a seperator to rule off the extra space like in Windows Vista/7 Groups. As Below.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HN61N.png"" alt=""Windows 7 Groups""></p>

<p>The problem I am having is I cannot get the separator to fill up the remaining space correctly. If I use a MinWidth value, all my expanders have the same width. If I use the {binding ActualWidth, ElementName=MyListBox}, then the separator is too wide, as its as wide as the control that contains it. So it sets the scroll bars to be visible, (see screenshot below). If i leave width blank, then the seperator is not drawn at all.</p>

<p>My gut feeling is the stackpanel should have expanded the seperator to use the remaining space but it didn't. So i tried a DockPanel as in the XamlCode below, yet this also fails. I have a few other problems with getting controls to fill up the remaining space, by using a suitable width so if you can help me resolve this, it would be great.</p>

<p>I'm assuming combining the two is a no-no since either:</p>

<ol>
<li>you're passing around a native pointer to a smart pointer-managed object which defeats the point of using the smart pointers in the first place,</li>
<li>if you wrap the ""this"" pointer in a smart pointer at use, e.g. ""return CSmartPtr(this);"", you've effectively set up multiple smart pointers managing the same object so the first one to have a reference count of zero will destroy the object from under the other, or</li>
<li>if you have a member variable holding the value of CSmartPtr(this) to return in these cases, it'll ultimately be a circular reference that results in the reference count always being one.</li>
</ol>

<p>To give a bit of context, I recently learned about the negative implications of combining STL containers with objects (repeated shallow copying, slicing when using containers of a base class, etc), so I'm replacing some usage of these in my code with smart pointers to the objects.  A few objects pass around references to themselves using the ""this"" pointer, which is where I'm stuck.</p>

<p>I've found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/382166/smart-pointers-this-considered-harmful"">smart pointers + “this” considered harmful?</a> asked on a somewhat similar problem, but the answer isn't useful as I'm not using Boost.</p>

<p>Edit: A (very contrived) example of what I'd been doing would be</p>

I want it to stay in column A, and every time a duplicate came up that was adjacent to delete it.
Pretty much I have an excel sheet that alternates information like so:</p>

<p>EDIT: I solved my own question. The answer is down below but here it is again to help others who may have come across the issue as I have.</p>

<p>Nevermind folks. I got this one. I recorded a macro that uses filters and a simple formula. In column B I put this in: =IF(a1=a2,""STOP"","""") Then I dragged it down to copy it. Then I filtered column B to show only ""STOP"" cells. Then I cleared out those cells. Then I unfiltered column B to show all. Then I went to Home>Find and Select>Special>Select Blanks Then I deleted and shifted cells up the selected blanks. Then I re dragged the B column formula down to make a working loop for my recorded macro. Heres what the recording ended up looking like:</p>

<p>I need to run some commandline code via a php script.
Unfortunately it does not give me any output, no errors, etc.
save_mode is turned off and there are no functions disabled.
Also there are no errors to be found in the server log and the errors are enabled in the php script.</p>

<p>The code I'm using is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
error_reporting(E_ALL);

exec('dir 2&gt;&amp;1', $output, $result);
var_dump($output);
var_dump($result);

$output = shell_exec(""whoami"");

$message=shell_exec(""test.bat 2&gt;&amp;1"");
var_dump($message);

<p>This script returns:</p>

<pre><code>array(0) { } int(1)

NULL NULL

<p>This script is run on a IIS server.</p>

And it's a fast reaction-based game, I don't want any lag with it. I've searched a lot and couldn't find a working solution for my problem.

"9001297","1","","","2012-01-25 10:40:35","","0","92","<p>Im having design/ architecture issues in how I am putting together my code. For example right now I store data in:</p>

<pre><code>internal interface IProperty&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt; : IDictionary&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt; { }

internal class PropertyDictionary&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt; : IProperty&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I implement IDictionary in PropertyDictionary. Also with PropertyDictionary i can then have a key and then for the value an immutable object with public properties. I can then reference the data easily by:</p>

<pre><code>        foreach (var data in inputData.Values)
        {
              var propertyValue = data.MyDataProperty;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly this way seems a lot of overhead to store data but more importantly now when I need to extend the functionality of PropertyDictionary for example to include RetrievePrice it becomes complicated as I need to add the additional methods in an interface and then create a new class as so:</p>

<pre><code>internal interface IAssetPriceData&lt;in TKey1&gt;
{
    double RetrievePrice(TKey1 key);
}

internal class PriceDictionary&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt; : PropertyDictionary&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt;, IAssetPriceData&lt;TKey1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So a solution on how I should structure my code to easily store different types of data which is then easily retrieved so I can manipulate / perform calculation on the properties that are being stored.</p>

<p>I have a collectionview that holds an observablecollection list that stores all my items. My datagrid's item source is the collection view. I have simple grouping in datagrid XAML...</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;DataGrid.GroupStyle&gt;

<p>Now... adding / removing items works just fine, however whenever I update / edit an item the groups are not updated. Let's say for example the items are grouped by city, if I have 3 items under one city name ""Seattle"" then change one of those city names to ""Brooklyn"" the ""Brooklyn"" city remains under the Seattle group until i repopulate the observablecollection list. </p>

<p>My current work around... is that whenever a city is changed I am literally clearing and repopulating my observablecollectionlist for the groups to update... There has to be a better way!</p>

<p>My question is, is there any way to update the datagrid group, manually / dynamically whenever i update / edit an item?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> INotifyPropertyChanged I am 90% sure is not the problem here, I have tried all manner of combinations with this interface, the groups will not update whenever I am editing / updating items. However whenever I add an item if it is a new city, a new group would be created, if I removed all items in a city, that city group would also be removed. Also its not just specific items, its any item column.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> ok, still no solution... but I found another work around, which once again is not the most elegant. I put an event handler for the city box.. so whenever the city is changed the event handler is called, and I refresh the collectionview. However the event is called whenever I add an item, called when I click on the item, and called twice whenever I make a change so it's not every efficient.. still looking for ideas.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong> I am now looking into the BeginEdit and EndEdit of IEditableObject to see if this will give me what I need</p>

<p>Any help is GREATLY appreciated, thank you!</p>

<p>I know that supervisord offers programmatic access in the form of XML-RPC. I read the documentation and attempted to work with it in several ways, but I keep running into problems.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the <a href=""http://supervisord.org/introduction.html#supervisor-components"" rel=""nofollow"">Introduction page</a>, the documentation recommends running an HTTP server for the XML-RPC interface and using the Python standard library <a href=""http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.5/library/xmlrpclib.html"" rel=""nofollow"">xmlrpclib</a> to communicate with it. There are two problems here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>inet_http_server</code> directive for supervisord.conf only includes username, password, and port as settings. There is no option to encrypt the connection.</li>
<li>xmlrpclib doesn't even support usernames and passwords. When I use the syntax <code>username:password@host:port</code>, I get <code>IOError: unsupported XML-RPC protocol</code>. As you can see in the example on the documentation page, no authentication occurs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Since UNIX sockets are secure, I figured that connecting to the <code>[unix_http_server]</code> with xmlrpclib would be a good idea. Still, I don't know how authentication would work, and furthermore, xmlrpclib only supports network HTTP/HTTPS servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Another page in the documentation mentions a <code>supervisor.rpcinterface</code> module. I have no access to such a thing in Python, though. To glean more information as to why that is, I re-installed supervisord with Pip. <code>sudo pip install --upgrade supervisor</code>. In the pip output, I see the line <code>Skipping installation of /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/supervisor/__init__.py (namespace package)</code>. I don't know why it would skip installation of the namespace package.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How am I supposed to communicate programmatically and securely with supervisord?</p>

"19120387","1","","","2013-10-01 15:36:51","","1","374","<p>I have a WebView which pulls up a web page which uses the Google Maps API, and I have this object called MapsBase which handles the map stuff. Inside the MapsBase init() I have:</p>

<pre><code>window.addEventListener('blur', (function (obj) {
    return function (evt) { obj.Pause(); };
})(this), true);
window.addEventListener('focus', (function (obj) {
    return function (evt) { obj.Resume();};
})(this), true);
</code></pre>

<p>Which acts on these functions:</p>

<pre><code>MapsBase.prototype.Pause = function () {
    //Chrome bug - focus and blur events are called twice.
    if (this.isPaused) {
        return;
    }
    if (window['DEBUG']){window.console.log('MapsBase.prototype.Pause()');}
    this.isPaused = true;
    this.geolocationMarker.setMap(null);
};

MapsBase.prototype.Resume = function () {
    if (this.isPaused) { //Chrome bug - focus and blur events are called twice.
        if (window['DEBUG']){window.console.log('MapsBase.prototype.Resume()');}
        this.isPaused = false;
        this.geolocationMarker.setMap(this.map);
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>On the Android side, I have my WebView (extends Fragment), which uses this in onStart():</p>

<pre><code>WebSettings settings = webView.getSettings();
settings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
settings.setGeolocationEnabled(true);
settings.setGeolocationDatabasePath(context.getFilesDir().getPath());
</code></pre>

<p>and has this as the onPause method:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onPause(){
    if (MainActivity.DEV_MODE) {  Log.i(""WebFragment"",""onPause - dispatching the 'blur' event""); }
webView.getSettings().setGeolocationEnabled(false);
    super.onPause();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It appears that all the events are firing as planned. When I monitor the debug output on my Nexus 4, I see that the onPause method is firing and dispatching the 'blur' event, but the geolocation is still active (showing in the notification area).</p>

<h3>tl;dr:</h3>

<p>Is there any way to force the WebView to give up geolocation?</p>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>It appears that the geolocation is deactivated when using the back button (system) to back out of the webview, but not when simply navigating away using the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Navigation Drawer</a> navigation I have going, like if I were to open the drawer and go to a totally different section of the app. It also happens if I just press the home button (the system ""home"" to go back to the launcher).</p>

<p>Here's the log output when I navigate to a different part of the app using the Navigation Drawer (after this point, the geolocation is still active):
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WigXp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Edit 2:</h2>

<p>There have been many questions on SO regarding switching GPS on/off.
In particular, one which seems to be relevant is the question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/6925832/940217"">Switch off GPS programatically</a>. Both the question and answer selected seem to fit what I'm looking for, but just seems like it's overkill. I don't have a <code>LocationListener</code>, and in order to get one, I'd need to follow the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/strategies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Location Strategies</a> guide.</p>

<p>It seems like setting geolocation to be disabled through the <code>WebView</code> should do the trick (like what I'm doing in <code>onPause</code>), but it doesn't.</p>

<p>The other option I've seen on SO is simply disabling GPS altogether for the app, which <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/4721449/940217"">isn't possible</a> except through exploitation of a security hole which has already been fixed.</p>

<p><strong>is this a bug in the <code>WebView</code> code?</strong></p>

<h2>Edit 3:</h2>

<p>I found the fix to my immediate problem, and it was an error in my JavaScript. The <code>setMap</code> function for the geolocation marker wasn't clearing the callback functions that were set up for the map.</p>

<p>As for the bigger issue at hand, <strong>Why does the web page Geolocation overrule the <code>WebView</code> geolocation settings?</strong> It turns out that this <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7176"" rel=""nofollow"">this was a bug</a> that has been marked as ""fixed"" (at least for an <code>Activity</code>). I suspect that this is a regression which shows up when the <code>WebView</code> is run within a <code>Fragment</code>.</p>

<p>I need to write a program that gets a sorted array. The program will put 999 where two adjacent blocks have the same value, and then put all the 999 in the end of the array. I need to do this without using another array and the program must be O(n).</p>

<p>example input:</p>

<p><code>50,60,60,72,81,81,81,81,93,93</code></p>

<p>desired output:</p>

<p><code>50,60,72,81,93,999,999,999,999,999</code></p>

<p>another example: </p>

<p><code>1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6,6</code></p>

<p>desired output: </p>

<p><code>1,2,3,4,5,6,999,999,999</code></p>

<p>my code. It's not working. For the first example the output is alright. for the second example i get 1,2,3,4,5,4,5,6,-14568127 (out of array bounds)</p>

<p>my algorithm is i walk through the array with two indexes, i and j, if a[i]!=a[i+1] then i advance i. if they are equal, j looks for the next unique value, and puts it in a[i+1].</p>

<p>I'd love to hear better ideas or a code to do this. in C.</p>

<pre><code>while((j!=size-1)&amp;&amp;(a[size-1]!=a[i]))
{
     if(a[i]!=a[i+1])
     {
         i++;
         j=i;
     }
     if(a[i]==a[i+1])
     {
         j=i;
         while(a[i]==a[j])
               j++;
         a[i+1]=a[j];
         i++;
         if(j!=size-1)
              j=i;
     }
}
i++
for(;i&lt;size;i++)
      a[i]=999;
</code></pre>

<p>I've edited the code, now I do it as chen suggested. First i iterate through the array putting 999 where the doubles are, problem arises when I want to switch though. here's the code I wrote for re-sorting the array:
each time i put a 999 somewhere, count++.</p>

<p>It's working for the two examples I gave perfectly. Thanks everyone.</p>

<p>I also have a backend that is created in Ruby on Rail (Mysql database) for Music management like adding songs, genre, albums and artists. It also handles sending push notification and all.</p>

<p>And now I want to create a web frontend for users to enjoy the songs through their laptop or desktop so that I can give my users the flexibility to play songs, view playlist that they create in android devices. </p>

<p>Here is the main question:</p>

<p>How Can I create the frontend to use the json api that my android app is using so that I dont have to create another backend for the website.? Let me know if its possible or not.</p>

<p>If not possible to use the json api then how can I proceed so that I avoid another backend work?</p>

                done
        done
</code></pre>

<p>...which results in a number of student directories being created in a temp directory that contains only the unzipped contents for the student submissions. 
I need the ls output of the new temp directories formatted as a string that contains:</p>

<pre><code>/tempDir/studentName1/\*.languageExt /tempDir/studentName2/\*.languageExt
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried variations on</p>

<pre><code>find ""$tempDir"" -iname ""*.$languageExt"" -printf ""%p/*.$languageExt""
</code></pre>

<p>using iname and not - but I either have output that contains extra directory information such as $tempDir/*.languageExt (when I just need the subdirectories $tempDir/$studentName/*.languageExt) or I have output where the path for every source file is also listed such as:</p>

<p>$tempDir/$studentName/studentNameA.java
$tempDir/$studentName/studentNameB.java
when I only need 
$tempDir/$studentName/*.java</p>

<p>I think this should be really easy and I'm just over thinking it. Any hints for improving the script also appreciated.</p>

If I encode the dataset using <a href=""http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/</a>, and manually paste the URL &amp; dataset into a browser, I get a successful response.</p>

<p>However, when trying to do the same thing with .NET, I get a response from the vendor API indicating that my dataset is invalid.</p>

<p>Here's my code (which I copied from elsewhere on the good ol' interweb):</p>

<pre><code>    public void PostXML(string value1, string value2, string value3, out string responseStatus, out string responseBody)
    {
        // Create a request using a URL that can receive a post. 
        WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(""https://www.vendorURL.com/API/page.html?input="");

        // Set the Method property of the request to POST.
        request.Method = ""POST"";

        // Create POST data and convert it to a byte array.
        string postData = ""&lt;DATASET&gt;"";
        postData += ""&lt;FIELD1&gt;"" + value1+ ""&lt;/FIELD1&gt;"";
        postData += ""&lt;FIELD2&gt;"" + value2 + ""&lt;/FIELD2&gt;"";
        postData += ""&lt;FIELD3&gt;"" + value3 + ""&lt;/FIELD3&gt;"";
        postData += ""&lt;/DATASET&gt;"";

        byte[] byteArray = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(postData);

        // Set the ContentType property of the WebRequest.
        request.ContentType = ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"";

        // Set the ContentLength property of the WebRequest.
        request.ContentLength = byteArray.Length;

        // Get the request stream.
        Stream dataStream = request.GetRequestStream();

        // Write the data to the request stream.
        dataStream.Write(byteArray, 0, byteArray.Length);

        // Close the Stream object.
        dataStream.Close();

        // Get the response.
        WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();

        // Assign the status.
        responseStatus = ((HttpWebResponse)response).StatusDescription;

        // Get the stream containing content returned by the server.
        dataStream = response.GetResponseStream();

        // Open the stream using a StreamReader for easy access.
        StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(dataStream);

        // Read the content.
        responseBody = reader.ReadToEnd();

        dataStream.Close();
        response.Close();
    }

<p>Keep in mind, I <em>am</em> getting a response from the vendor API.  It's just telling me that my dataset is invalid.  I have already contacted the vendor's customer support.  That have confirmed that my dataset itself is correct, but somewhere along the way I'm encoding it incorrectly for it to be recognizable by the vendor API.</p>

Currently the map is generated by loading an HD picture of a map from Zelda. Then i made a simple map engine editor which helps me position collision boxes wherever i want (the collision box size is random , along with the position - generated by simple mouse click and drag). But working on the project i soon realized that i can not implement a proper AI path-finding algorithm to make an Enemy reach the Player avoiding the collision areas. I've been reading about path-finding algorithms but as far as i understand those methods require constant sized and positioned collision boxes (for example 8x8 or 16x16 etc).</p>

<p>My Questions are the following:
1. Is it good to progress further with this method, or should i create the map out of tiles(Tiled map editor). But i do not know how does Collision detection work in that particular software. I tried making object_layer and put some collision boxed in there but, the boxes position and size is not consistent with the map grid. Meaning that i can pop a box in the middle of a 8x8 tile box.
2. If i keep my method and approach is there a way to make a working AI path finder.
3. I've always wondered how were half - collidable tile boxes made (collision over the slope/diagonal of the tile not the outer bounds)
4.Also  I would like some good soul to explain me how does tiled maps work. Why should i not use an HD picture instead of such map(besides performance issues) I do not seem to grasp them AT ALL. Also how can i generate Grid collision boxes over a picture map background ?</p>

<p>PS: I would not apply any code examples for now , since my Question is more related with the logic behind the game rather than the actual programming part.</p>

<p>PS2: In Advance , I would like you to excuse me if my English is causing you headaches. :)</p>

<p>I am using ORMLite from ServiceStack (it is some non-entity-framework lite ORM), so it doesn't seem have auto-relational-mapping to the collections. I make the Linq statement to map this Many-to-Many relationship between <code>Role-RU-User</code>. Here is the Linq:</p>

<pre><code>//cleaning old data
UsersDict.ForEach(kvUser =&gt; kvUser.Value.Roles.Clear());
//for each role ...
RolesDict.ForEach(kvRole =&gt; {
    //cleaning old data
    kvRole.Value.Users.Clear();
    //find users that belong to the role
    var users = (from ru in RoleUserDict
         join u in UsersDict on ru.Value.UserId equals u.Value.Id
         where ru.Value.RoleId == kvRole.Value.Id 
         select u).ToList();
    //couple them up
    users.ForEach(kvUser =&gt; {
        kvRole.Value.Users.TryAdd(kvUser.Key, kvUser.Value);
        kvUser.Value.Roles.TryAdd(kvRole.Key, kvRole.Value);

<p>I am not good at Linq and I am not sure how normally the Many-to-Many relationship is handled in this situation. My code looks pretty horrible to me. Especially with those chunky nested ForEach() loops.  </p>

However, as I've used the same variable name in a javascript file, I have to wade through all those search results too.

<p>To compound things, our designers include HTML mock-ups of the pages in the same project, so I often find I'm hitting loads of search results in there too.</p>

<li>Search only in files of any of a given set of types (search only .cs, .aspx and .ascx files).</li>
<li>Search in all file types except a particular type or types (search everything except .js).</li>

Unfortunately, most all tutorials regarding WCF are in C# and I'm not too familiar with C# syntax; most all of my experience is in VB. I've gotten through it so far, but I ran into a bit of a snag. I think that the <code>:</code> is the equivalent of <code>Inherits</code> or <code>Implements</code> ? However I'm not sure what it means when there are two comma seperated things after a <code>:</code> in a class declaration. Here's the code in C#:</p>

 <pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>Public class MyProxy : ClientBase&lt;InterfaceDom&gt;, InterfaceDom
{
    Public int Add(int num1, int num2)
    {
        return base.Channel.Add(num1, num2);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try run it through some of the online converters the converters error out with something about EOF expected. I was hoping someone could let me know what I need to change with my VB code to make it do the same thing as the C# code above.</p>

<pre><code>if (pf.isDefinedAt(in)) pf(in)
</code></pre>

<p>By breaking this up into two separate calls, all of the patterns that were evaluated in #isDefinedAt are then also evaluated in #apply.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>object Ex1 {
  def unapply(in: Int) : Option[String] = {
    println(""Ex1"")
    if (in == 1) Some(""1"") else None
  }
}

object Ex2 {
  def unapply(in: Int) : Option[String] = {
    println(""Ex2"")
    if (in == 2) Some(""2"") else None
  }
}

val pf : PartialFunction[Int,String] = {
  case Ex1(result) =&gt; result
  case Ex2(result) =&gt; result
}

val in = 2

if (pf.isDefinedAt(in)) pf(in)
</code></pre>

<p>Which prints</p>

<pre><code>Ex1
Ex2
Ex1
Ex2
res52: Any = 2
</code></pre>

<p>In the worst case, where your pattern matches last, you've evaluated your patterns/extractors twice when calling a PartialFunction. This could become inefficient when matching over custom extractors that did more than just a simple class or list pattern match (for example, if you had an extractor that parsed an XML document and returned some value objects)</p>

<p>PartialFunction#lift suffers from the same double-evaluation:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; pf.lift(2)
Ex1
Ex2
Ex1
Ex2
res55: Option[String] = Some(2)

<p>Is there a way to conditionally call a function if it is defined without potentially calling all of your extractors twice?</p>

<p>When I deploy the wsp via PowerShell to a remote SharePoint server, the web parts show in the web part gallery but adding one to a page gets me the error 'Cannot import this web part'. The logs have no further information in them. As per some answers I've found via Google, I've checked there is no code in Init. All initial processing is done within CreateChildControls (although I would have thought if this were the cause, I would get the same error on my local machine).</p>

<p>I originally asked this question at <a href=""http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/11820/custom-web-part-deployment-produces-cannot-import-this-webpart-error"">http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/11820/custom-web-part-deployment-produces-cannot-import-this-webpart-error</a>. From the suggestions I received I decided to create a fresh project where I had done minimal coding.</p>

<p>The new project has just one simple label web part.  The code for the web part is</p>

        {
            Label lblThis = new Label();
            lblThis.Text = ""Testing web part"";
            Controls.Add(lblThis);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The .webpart file in the project is</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

<p>The AS_Segment class is a simple extension of shape that just stores an id:</p>

<pre><code>package views.segments

    import flash.display.Shape;

    public class AS_Segment extends Shape
    {
        public var id       :String;

        public function AS_Segment($id:String)
        {
            id = $id;
        }
    }
}

<p>It would be a pain to comment out this new code.  What is the correct way to re-write it to be compatible with both the old and new Base SDKs, and does submitting it now (via XCode 4 and built against iOS 6 SDK) risk any sort of App Store rejection?</p>

<p>Basically the while process was working properly.
The problem I currently have is that the <b>sql</b> folder next to the java folder is not copied into the archetype when performing <pre>mvn archetype:create-from-project</pre></p>

<p>I already tried to pass this through via archetype.properties without success.</p>

<p>I know that I have the option to adjust the archetype-metadata.xml after the archetype generation, but I would like to generate everything from the sample project without further manual changes.</p>

I've already run into the issue of having developed using PHP 5.4 only to find out that my static functions won't work on WS's 5.1.4 installation.  I've since fixed those issues and am not facing one that I can't seem to find any help for on the internet.</p>

<p>All of the static functions I was using have been rewritten as functions outside the class scope.  Instead of having</p>

<pre><code>class Product{
...
public static function myFunction(){}
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I now have</p>

<pre><code>function myFunction(){}

class Product{...}
</code></pre>

<p>in my included Product.php file.</p>

<p>However, when I try to call <code>myFunction()</code> from my code, nothing happens.  I know the nothingness comes from WS's error handling, but the point is, the function isn't working.  To verify this, I have taken the following steps:</p>

<p>Inserted the line <code>echo ""entered included"";</code> immediately following the <code>&lt;?php</code> in Product.php.  This prints ""entered included"" on the index page, indicating that my <code>include</code> is working.  I have done the same thing before the final <code>?&gt;</code> with the same results, so I don't think it's getting hung up inside the included file.</p>

<p>I have changed myFunction() in the included file to be simply</p>

<pre><code>function myFunction(){echo ""myFunction works"";}
</code></pre>

<p>A call to <code>myFunction()</code> still makes nothing happen.</p>

<p>I have moved myFunction() to the including file (myFunction() now lives in index.php instead of Product.php; index includes Product.php).  This time, myFunction() executes without issue.</p>

<p>To my 'hack it til it does what it should' sensibilities, this tells me that the server is having a problem with functions that are declared in files that are included; honestly, though, I have absolutely no clue what's going on, and any help would be appreciated.  Their website is currently down, and they were expecting it to only be offline for a day, so I'll try pretty much anything short of sacrificing a fatted calf.</p>

<p>I know I should be posting more specific code, but since this is a customer's actual website, I'm trying to put as little of the actual code out here as is possible.  I'm happy to append specific sections of code to this entry as they are requested for clarification.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your consideration.</p>

<p>@Rottingham:  First, thanks for the 3v4l link.  Second, my assumption about static methods in 5.4 vs 5.1.4 came from this line of php.net's page on static members and methods:</p>

<p>""As of PHP 5.3.0, it's possible to reference the class using a variable. The variable's value can not be a keyword (e.g. self, parent and static).""
src - <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php</a></p>

<p>Since my version and the server version were on different sides of the 5.3 mark mentioned, I incorrectly assumed that this was my problem.</p>

<p>Third, when I get in from my day job, I'll update my code to show errors and update this post if a solution has not yet been found.</p>

<p>Ultimately, my problem isn't with using static methods (since I don't have them anymore) but with using any function that is declared in an included .php file.</p>

I'm building a fetch request to only retrieve events that have upcoming dates between two given dates. The problem is, no matter how I format the input dates in my predicate I get an exception. It seems like Core Data wants my predicate arguments to be both NSDates and NSNumbers.</p>

<p>When I pass in NSNumbers, by doing @([date timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate]), I see this:</p>

<pre><code>predicate: 0 != SUBQUERY(upcomingDates, $upcomingDate, $upcomingDate.date &gt;= 387270000 AND $upcomingDate.date &lt;= 387356400).@count
-[__NSCFNumber timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x865a0b0
</code></pre>

<p>When I go the intuitive route, with plain old NSDates, I see this:</p>

<pre><code>predicate: 0 != SUBQUERY(upcomingDates, $upcomingDate, $upcomingDate.date &gt;= CAST(387270000.000000, ""NSDate"") AND $upcomingDate.date &lt;= CAST(387356400.000000, ""NSDate"")).@count
-[__NSDate objCType]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x86c6450
</code></pre>

<p>Printing out the object receiving the unrecognized selector, it's always the first of the predicate arguments.</p>

<p>I've verified to the best of my ability that upcomingDate.date is in fact an NSDate (that's what the model specifies, but I also took a look at what was passed in when they're created). I've tried using every permutation of CASTs to NSDates and NSNumbers. I've broken the predicate down to the simplest case possible, which really just means removing one of the ANDed subquery predicates. I'm stumped.</p>

<p>ETA:
The predicates are as follows.
NSNumbers:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""0 != (SUBQUERY(upcomingDates, $upcomingDate, ($upcomingDate.date &gt;= %@) AND ($upcomingDate.date &lt;= %@))).@count"", @([self.timeFilterRange[0] timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate]), @([self.timeFilterRange[1] timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate])]
</code></pre>

<p>NSDates:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""0 != (SUBQUERY(upcomingDates, $upcomingDate, ($upcomingDate.date &gt;= %@) AND ($upcomingDate.date &lt;= %@))).@count"", self.timeFilterRange[0] , self.timeFilterRange[1] ]

Now I cannot be sure if this relates to lack of exposure to alternative ways of thinking or projects of sufficient scale to warrant significant investigation. </p>

<p>I’ve been a .net net developer for a number of years (and before that php and asp classic) and typically when developing applications I shy away from using the built in .net <code>SqlMembershipProvider</code> primarily because it often seems significantly over complicated for my needs, and secondarily because I can only imagine such a complex data model will likely have a performance hit. </p>

<p>Typically I use a custom membership and roles provider operating on a fairly simple <code>user -&gt; user roles &lt;- roles</code> type schema. I maintain the standard membership provider features such as account recovery, profile details, failed login account locking, secret questions, etc depending on the needs of the associated application such as an AD secured application has few additional features, a public facing application will usually have them all. It also means should any tasks that come up which require stored procs to chew through user data they’re easy to write and perform very well. Straight SQL commands, good indexing and a simple data model resulting in a high performance, scalable solution which should needs change I have full control to change as necessary which I considering invaluable.</p>

<p>I have scanned over some tutorials but I have to admit it does seem rather (very) complicated compared to mysql_query()</p>

<p>The best way to learn is probably through example, so Im hoping someone would be kind enough to change the following example for me to a PDO and a MYSQLI statement so that I can see the difference between the two. If a brief explanation can be included it will be greatly appreciated...</p>

<p>Also what do you recommend is the easiest to learn? Mysqli or PDO</p>

<p>I have two tables: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>entry</code> containing the name &amp; details of a competition entry.</li>
<li><code>votes</code> containing a timestamp, unique ID, and entry_id. Each row with the entry_id matching the id of an entry represents one vote for that person's competition entry.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rough Db Structures are:</p>

<p>entry table:</p>

<pre><code>|id|name|email|created|deleted|   [last two cols being datetime stamps]
</code></pre>

<p>votes table:</p>

<pre><code>|id|entry_id|created|deleted|
</code></pre>

<p>My attempts (various rewrites, probably too tired!) have resulted in just one row being returned.</p>

<p>My latest attempt:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = 'SELECT
        s_id,
        count(sv.s_id) as count
    FROM
        'vote AS sv
    LEFT JOIN
        'entry AS se on sv.entry_id = se.id
    WHERE
        sv.deleted = ""0000-00-00 00:00:00""

        10';

<p>Can someone give me a steer on how best to achieve this?</p>

I'll be debugging my app in Xcode, when Xcode breaks on an error.  After looking at it, I'd hit Step Over or Continue...and it wouldn't do anything.  More accurately, it acted like it stepped, but didn't actually go anywhere.  This can be repeated indefinitely, as far as I can tell.  One reason this is problematic is that it never gives me the crash log, because it never finishes crashing.  I only get the crash log when the app crashes and it isn't being debugged (which means I have to get it through Crittercism or by checking the device logs).</p>

<p>Anybody see this before, and/or know why it does this?  I haven't seen any mention of this elsewhere, but it's happened to me in several projects.</p>

<p>For example, in one project we use SocketRocket, and every once in a while (for an as-of-yet unknown reason) it crashes in SRWebSocket.m in the following method:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)main;
{
    @autoreleasepool {
        _runLoop = [NSRunLoop currentRunLoop];
        dispatch_group_leave(_waitGroup);

        NSTimer *timer = [[NSTimer alloc] initWithFireDate:[NSDate distantFuture] interval:0.0 target:nil selector:nil userInfo:nil repeats:NO];
        [_runLoop addTimer:timer forMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode];

        int i = 0;

        while ([_runLoop runMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate:[NSDate distantFuture]]) {
            NSLog(@""_runLoop %i %@"", i++, [NSDate date]);
        }
        assert(NO);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It crashes on the <code>while</code> line.  (I added the NSLog line, by the way).  When I hit Continue or Step Over, the line indicator flickers briefly, then appears again on the same line.  Note that it does not continue to the NSLog line, and nothing is written to the console at all.  I'm currently still trying to get it to crash again (this particular crash is rather unpredictable), but if I remember correctly, the line indicator says <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code>, probably a prematurely deallocated object.</p>

<p>This all works fine. I have Google analytics installed on the hosting page, so I can see how many hits the page gets, but what I would like to know is how many people are getting the updates.<br>
The normal analytics won't work because they all rely on somebody clicking on a link, but Greasemonkey downloads the updated file without clicking on anything (or, as far as I can tell, triggering a page hit in analytics).</p>

<p>I'm assuming I need a server-side solution, but I have no idea what it would look like. Maybe all the above about GM is irrelevant, and the simple question is:<br>
How can I track how many times a file is downloaded from my server (without relying on counting clicks on download links)?   </p>

<p>[<strong>EDIT FOR FURTHER INFO</strong>]</p>

<p>@Brock Adams Thank you for the answer - it was very detailed and exactly what I was looking for. I wasn't aware of the separate <code>meta.js</code> option, but reading a little into it I see that it's a good idea anyway as it means that only the <code>meta.js</code> file has to be downloaded (as opposed to the entire <code>user.js</code> file) when checking for updates. When I set this up, auto-updates were kind of new and there wasn't much documentation around about them.
I still can't find much, so I wonder if you could clarify. The metadata in the main <code>user.js</code> file stays the same, just with a pointer to <code>meta.js</code> in the <code>@updateURL</code> and without the version number, ie:</p>

<pre><code>// ==UserScript==
// @namespace   http://namespace.com/userscripts
// @description some description. 
// @downloadURL https://namespace.com/userscripts/example.user.js
// @updateURL   https://namespace.com/userscripts/example.meta.js
// @include     https://example.com/*
// @grant       none
// ==/UserScript==
</code></pre>

<p>and then all <code>example.meta.js</code> has to have is </p>

<pre><code>// ==UserScript==
// @version 2.1
// ==/UserScript==
</code></pre>

<p>is that correct? thanks again.</p>

As I intend only one person to be using the application I wanted to avoid using php and HTTPS. Every example I have seen so far is connecting via some database which I don’t think we need to do as only user will tend to use the app.</p>

<p>I was thinking more along the lines of having a one off registration page for the user when he first downloads the application and when he register stores the username and password in XML.  Then allow the user to login where the user will check XML file to see if its correct if so let the user go to the main page, as well as use preference to avoid login if the user wishes to do so. </p>

<p>So my main question is this possible? Saving data using XML when registering and checking against that data in XML when logging in.  If so how do I go towards implementing this?</p>

I have an asp.net web application 3.5 framework that display generated pdf file to an ajax modalpop.

I manage to display pdf file on an iframe within the ajax modalpopup and this setup is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera but not on IE. I manage to found a solution on IE9 64bit using response.binarywrite and pdf file will display on a new instance of Adobe Acrobat Reader (v11 and v10) but on IE9 32bit this is not how it renders pdf, it renders on the current page itself and I don't want to be that way and when user click on the back button of the browser it will redirect to the last page visited not on the page where I click a button to display the pdf. I'm aware that by looking on the browser it still on the current page where the trigger to load the pdf happens. Now is it possible to reload the current page by clicking the back button and will it reload on the page where the pdf file is not visible. Refer to the code below to what I've done so far.</p>

However, I do not have the whole codebase locally, so I am not sure if I have found and updated every reference to the original file. In order to ensure that I don't break anything, I would like to leave the original file, and simply have it extend the new file that I created. Ideally, they'd both have the exact same name. Overtime, I plan to deprecate and remove the old file, but for now this seems like the most robust solution. However, I cannot figure out how to get it to work in Java.</p>

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

            throws ServletException, IOException
    {
        // implementation of service
    }

}

The idea is that your program is a combination of a datatype and operations over it. We want to be able to add new cases without recompiling the old classes. </p>

<p>Now Haskell has some really awesome solutions to the <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExpressionProblem"">expression problem</a> with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class"">TypeClass</a>. In particular - we can do:</p>

<pre><code>class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
  (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool


member :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
member y [] = False
member y (x:xs) = (x == y) || member y xs
</code></pre>

<p>Now in Clojure there are <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MultiMethods"">multimethods</a> - so you can do:</p>

<pre><code>(defmulti area :Shape)
(defn rect [wd ht] {:Shape :Rect :wd wd :ht ht})
(defn circle [radius] {:Shape :Circle :radius radius})
(defmethod area :Rect [r]
    (* (:wd r) (:ht r)))
(defmethod area :Circle [c]
    (* (. Math PI) (* (:radius c) (:radius c))))
(defmethod area :default [x] :oops)
(def r (rect 4 13))
(def c (circle 12))
(area r)
-&gt; 52
(area c)
-&gt; 452.3893421169302
(area {})
-&gt; :oops
</code></pre>

<p>Also in Clojure you have <a href=""http://clojure.org/protocols"">protocols</a> - with which you can do:</p>

<pre><code>(defprotocol P
  (foo [x])
  (bar-me [x] [x y]))

(deftype Foo [a b c]
  P
  (foo [x] a)
  (bar-me [x] b)
  (bar-me [x y] (+ c y)))

(bar-me (Foo. 1 2 3) 42)
=&gt; 45

(foo
 (let [x 42]
   (reify P
     (foo [this] 17)
     (bar-me [this] x)
     (bar-me [this y] x))))

=&gt; 17
</code></pre>

<p>Now <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21984769/can-you-formulate-the-insertion-sort-as-a-monoid-in-clojure#comment33345197_21997032"">this individual makes the claim</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But, there are protocols and multi-methods. These are very powerful, but not as powerful as Haskell's typeclasses. You can introduce something like a typeclass by specifying your contract in a protocol. This only dispatches on the first argument, whereas Haskell can dispatch on the entire signature, including return value. Multi-methods are more powerful than protocols, but not as powerful as Haskell's dispatch.</p>

<p>When i enter letters into the text field i get no error thrown. My jquery/javascript is limited but I thought this would at least work? as the reg exp checks for numbers between 0-9. I would also like to check that if a number is entered then it matches 11 digits</p>

<p>Is there any way like it can set range like  <code>B11:B19</code> then <code>shDestin 11:19</code>?
It will be trouble because in future I might have 50+ file in a folder to trace the data...</p>

<p>Details: We have a cube that deploys to all client environments via a installer. Now as we continue to develop, we make changes to the cube, like changes in calculated measures, adding a new level to a dimension or editing an existing level/measure. we need to deploy these changes to client environments in the form of an updates. </p>

<p>Now these environments are not directly accessible by us nor do they have bids installed, meaning, we cant use bids to make changes and deploy it to the prod environment. Hence the requirement of a script/s to accomplish it.</p>

<p>Is there an approach that can enable to release these updates to the cube programmatically (not via AMO)? eg: a reporcess of a cube can be triggered in the form of a xmla statement. </p>

<p>We also need to be considerate of any customization/s that the client would have made (like addition of measures or levels for a given dimension) and preserve them.</p>

<p>Please let me know if i have clearly explained the issue at hand. </p>

<p>Everything works fine - custom pagination,custom filtering etc. The only sore point is that I am unable to sort properly when I click a header.</p>

<p>I am having 10rows per page. When Page1 is loaded, sorting works correctly on any column. But when I goto next page and click on a column header to sort that column, It sorts the previous pages records and shows the top 10 rows of the sorting . </p>

<p>So on page 2, the default display will show records with SerialNumbers from 21 to 30. Which is correct. But when I click on the SerialNumber Header to sort it, I get 1-10 shown as the result. If I click the header again, I am shown 10-1 (descending order). So my current data of rows from 20-30 is totally lost.</p>

From reference <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function"">here</a> one can see that argument to <code>std::function</code>'s ctor should be callable and copy constructible. So here is small example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;

class A {
public:
    A(int a = 0): a_(a) {}
    A(const A&amp; rhs): a_(rhs.a_) {}
    A(A&amp;&amp; rhs) = delete;
    void operator() ()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; a_ &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

private:
    int a_;
};

typedef std::function&lt;void()&gt; Function;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::boolalpha;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Copy constructible: ""
              &lt;&lt; std::is_copy_constructible&lt;A&gt;::value &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Move constructible: ""
              &lt;&lt; std::is_move_constructible&lt;A&gt;::value &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    //Function f = A();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We have callable, copy constructible but not move constructible class. As I believe this should be sufficient to wrap it in <code>Function</code>. But if you uncomment commented line compiler becomes very upset about deleted move constructor. Here is <a href=""http://ideone.com/Oqwnj2"">ideone</a> link. GCC 4.8.0 doesn't compile this too.</p>

<p>So, is it something I misunderstand about <code>std::function</code> or is it GCC's incorrect behaviour?</p>

The balance will be added to that user which has the id of 4 not previous one.</p></li>

Second problem arises. What if the user just exits the paypal page without completing the order after pressing the submit button? This is something I cannot track since paypal does not belong to me and it opens in other page.</p></li>

I built a small framework that creates a list view and edit view for each mysql database table.  Below shows an example of code of how I might set up a CMS to manipulate a database table:</p>

<pre><code>// CODE FOR LIST VIEW - http://mysite.com/admin/user.php
// This code will output an html table of records from db table t_user.
// The html table will have controls that allow user to search, delete, and paginate
// You can click on each record to edit the record
&lt;?php
include('class/framework.php');
$template = new ListView();
$template-&gt;data_object = new DB($mysql_table_name = 't_user');
$template-&gt;setCol($col = 'user_name', $label = 'User Name');
$template-&gt;setCol($col = 'email', $label = 'Email'); 
$template-&gt;setCol($col = 'last_login', $label = 'Last Time Logged In', $format='Y-m-d H:i:s');
$tempate-&gt;run();
?&gt;

// CODE FOR EDIT VIEW - http://mysite.com/admin/user.edit.php
// This code will output an html form that adds, edits, deletes
// and validates a record from t_user
&lt;?php
include('class/framework.php');
$template = new EditView();
$template-&gt;data_object = new DB($mysql_table_name = 't_user'):

$f = new Field($col = 'user_id', $type = 'hidden');
$template-&gt;field[] = $f;

$f = new Field($col = 'email', $type = 'text');
$f-&gt;arr_validate = array('is_email', 'is_required');
$template-&gt;field[] = $f;

$f = new Field($col = 'phone', $type = 'text');
$f-&gt;arr_validate = array('is_phone', 'is_required');
$template-&gt;field[] = $f;

$f = new Field($col = 'password', $type = 'password');
$template-&gt;field[] = $f;

$f = new Field($col = 'bio', $type = 'wysiwyg');
$template-&gt;field[] = $f;

$f = new Field($col = 'pic', $type = 'image');
$template-&gt;field[] = $f;


$template-&gt;run();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it...I don't have to write a single line of html, css or javascript code.  All the validation is done for me as long as I populate <code>$f-&gt;arr_validate</code>.  The ability to search, sort, paginate, edit, delete etc...is all done with just the code above.</p>

<p>Is there something in Code Igniter that achieves something similar?  If there is no such thing out of the box, just say so.</p>

<p>That class would have an <code>int TotalItems</code> property, which would (not that surprising) get / set the count of the queryable or enumerable parameter.</p>

<p>If I use <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> as parameter, </p>

<pre><code>//simplified
public Pagination(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; query)
    {
        TotalItems = query.Count();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>Count()</code> method will be (<strong>if I'm not wrong, that's the point</strong>) <code>Enumerable.Count()</code>. So even if query is an <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code> (which inherits from <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>), it will be enumerated (which is obviously not desired with a ""db query"").</p>

<p>So is there a way to use <code>Queryable.Count()</code> method when my <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> is in fact an <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code>, or do I have to change my design, having, for example in this case, 2 ctor</p>

<pre><code>//simplified
public Pagination(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; query)
    {
         TotalItems = query.Count();
    }
public Pagination(IQueryable&lt;T&gt; query)
    {
         TotalItems = query.Count();
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I do understand that <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code> inheriting from <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> has nothing to do with the fact that <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code> have extension methods with same name, and that it's nice to have same names for extension method, which ""look like they do the same"", but I think it still sometimes confusing...</p>

<p><strong>Generic question for curiosity</strong></p>

<p>Are they other examples, in framework, with the same ""architecture"" : inheritance  + common names for extension methods ?</p>

<p>It seems that the whole processing starts from this point, calling <code>parser.prog()</code>, and I must be doing some very wrong thing as I cannot find the method <code>prog()</code> in <code>myGrammarParser</code> class.

The application displays several tabs inside a browser window (we are using IE 8 and that is the only browser we are supporting). The application displays the Silverlight control on tabs dynamically, based on the data. So, if I have a window where I see 3 tabs, then it may be in one tab, or it may be on all three of the tabs and so on. The problem is that we do not have control of the tabs and every single time the client clicks on one of the tabs, if there is a Silverlight control there then it is initialized like if the window is being open the first time. 
The problem with that is that the client can make changes on the control (not the data display), like scrolling through the data in the control. Those changes are lost because the control is initialized and we don't want that. Is there a way to stop that?</p>

<p>Suppose I'd like to customize the layout such that I want to do this in an action in my controller:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>$layout = $this-&gt;layout();
$myNav = new ViewModel(array('nav' =&gt; $this-&gt;getNav());
$myNav-&gt;setTemplate('layout/nav');
$layout-&gt;addChild($myNav, 'navigation');
</code></pre>

<p>Works great when I place this into my controller for regular (i.e. non-404) viewing. Now I've customized my layout so that I can do <code>&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;navigation; ?&gt;</code> and the <code>layout/nav.phtml</code> is fired up and everything works just hunky dory.</p>

<p>Now, suppose I want to do the exact same thing when errors are rendered. I need to be able to inject the above code somehow prior to the error handler returning it's own <code>ViewModel(...)</code> into the <code>error/404.phtml</code> template.</p>

<p>How do you do that?</p>

<p>I suspect that it's something like setting up the correct class for the service manager like this in <code>module.config.php</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>'service_manager' =&gt; array(
    'services' =&gt; array(
        'error_handler' =&gt; 'MyModule\Controller\MyCustomErrorController'
        //and so on...
</code></pre>

<p>How do I do this?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>In my <code>Module.php</code> I've attached a method for <code>MvcEvent::EVENT_DISPATCH_ERROR</code>. Variant A works, Variant B does not. So you can't use partials here?? Am I missing something really basic??</p>

<p><strong>Variant A</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>public function onDispatchError(MvcEvent $event)
{
    $sm  = $event-&gt;getApplication()-&gt;getServiceManager();
    $vm = $event-&gt;getViewModel();
    $vm-&gt;setVariable('nav', '&lt;h1&gt;test do i work?&lt;/h1&gt;');
    //Works
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Variant B</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>public function onDispatchError(MvcEvent $event)

    $sm  = $event-&gt;getApplication()-&gt;getServiceManager();
    $vm = $event-&gt;getViewModel();

    $nav-&gt;setTemplate('layout/simpletest');//contents: &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;test; ?&gt;

I am actually wondering what the point of having functions return IO[A] out of them. The lambda expressions wrapped in the IO object are what the mutations are and at some point higher up the change they have to be observed, I mean executed, so that something happens. Are you not just pushing the problem higher up the tree somewhere else?</p>

<p>The only benefit I can see is that it allows for lazy evaluation, in the sense that if you do not call the unsafePerformIO operation no side effects occur. Also I guess other parts of the program could use / share code and deciede when it wants the side effects to occur.</p>

<p>I was wondering if this is all? Is there any advantages in testability? I am assuming not as you would have to observe the effects which sort of negates this. If you used traits / interfaces you can control the dependencies but not when the effects take place on these dependencies. </p>

<p>I put together the following example in code.</p>

<pre><code>case class IO[+A](val ra: () =&gt; A){
  def unsafePerformIO() : A = ra();
  def map[B](f: A =&gt; B) : IO[B] = IO[B]( () =&gt; f(unsafePerformIO()))
  def flatMap[B](f: A =&gt; IO[B]) : IO[B] = {
    IO( () =&gt;  f(ra()).unsafePerformIO())
  }
}



case class Person(age: Int, name: String)

object Runner {

  def getOlderPerson(p1: Person,p2:Person) : Person = 
    if(p1.age &gt; p2.age) 
        p1
      else
        p2

  def printOlder(p1: Person, p2: Person): IO[Unit] = {
    IO( () =&gt; println(getOlderPerson(p1,p2)) ).map( x =&gt; println(""Next"") )
  }

  def printPerson(p:Person) = IO(() =&gt; {
    println(p)
    p
  })

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    val result = printPerson(Person(31,""Blair"")).flatMap(a =&gt; printPerson(Person(23,""Tom""))
                                   .flatMap(b =&gt; printOlder(a,b)))

   result.unsafePerformIO()
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see how the effects are deferred until main which I guess is cool. I came up with this after getting a feel for this from the video. </p>

<p>Is my implementation correct and Is my understanding correct.</p>

<p>I am also wondering whether to get milage it should be combined with the ValidationMonad, as in ValidationMonad[IO[Person]] so we can short circuit when exceptions occurs? Thoughts please.</p>

But if I simple launch this test from IDE without preliminary Maven build - than my web service address will be simply acquired from application.properties and equals ""${pom.integration.web.service.url}"" (e.g. process of Maven filtering doesn't work before test). How can I adjust Maven, Spring or jUnit to extract my value from pom.xml?</p>

<p>I converted my app, everything seems to have worked perfectly, however, the connection to the web server completely stopped working all together.</p>

<p>original code: </p>

<pre><code>let tempstring: String? = ""\(urlBase)""
let url = NSURL(string: tempstring!.stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)!)
var key: NSString?
key = NSString(contentsOfURL: url!, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding, error: nil)
</code></pre>

<p>temp string would end up being <a href=""http://www.zephyrpanthur.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zephyrpanthur.com/</a> --other variables and subdirectories</p>

<p>the conversion did:</p>

<pre><code>let tempstring: String? = ""\(urlBase)""
let url = NSURL(string: tempstring!.stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)!)
var error: NSError?
var key: NSString?
do {
  key = try NSString(contentsOfURL: url!, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)
  print(key)
}
catch var error1 as NSError {
  error = error1
  print(error)
  key = nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically just added a try/catch, which is awesome. However, <code>key</code> is always equal to <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>I tried lots of stuff, and eventually figured out that if I load <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com</a> it worked and loaded the site. I tried with Yahoo, Facebook, and some other pages that are not major names and they all worked.</p>

<p>When I went back to zephyrpanthur.com, it stopped working. I even tried some other servers I own, like, 8bitfox.com and that also didn't work. I tried with and without <code>www.</code> and with and without ssl (https/http)</p>

<p>Anything from my own servers seems to be blocked. This is very bizarre and strange. my iPhone, iPad, and simulators can load those pages just fine, but they will not load inside my app...</p>

<p>The code DOES work in playgrounds, just not in my app. I am not doing anything else with networking, and before this code is ran, the only thing that happens is some checks with local user settings to know if it should auto login, or request user and pass to be entered.</p>

<p>The error messages was along the lines of ""could not open zepyrpanthur.com"" or whatever site I used when it failed.</p>

<p>I'm hoping this is an issues with swift 2.0, and not a problem with my web servers, but who knows. maybe ssl is required for access now? tho some of the sites that did load weren't ssl, so I don't know, any ideas?</p>

I have looked around but I haven't seen anything specific in this case. Like I said, these files were making the site work as they were without any other modifications.</p>

<p>If anyone has any idea on what it wrong, I would greatly appreciate your help.</p>

<p>My thoughts are the following. I'm creating a merger-file (in PHP) that will handle all the js-includes and make them into one big file. But I got some questions.</p>

<p>There are two cases.</p>

<ol>
<li>A merger file is created for each sub-item and stored in a special folder. Each sub-item will then include that file, and only that file that is ""it's own js-file""</li>
</ol>

<p>Pros: Very clear that a certain sub-item got it's own js-file.
Cons: A lot of files and also each time you make a change in a js-file you have to update the merged js-file manually</p>

<ol>
<li>A merger file is created on the fly for each sub-item depending on some parameters (js.php?modules=jquery-jqueryui-plugin1-plugin2)</li>
</ol>

<p>Pros: Easy to work with, all changes will be updated instantly since it's generated in runtime.
Cons: The possibility that the processing time and energy to create the merger-file will even out the loss of 20~ HTTP requests.</p>

<p>So, this is a question about performance. Thoughts?</p>

I've only recently begun playing around with it and stumbled upon some of my old MATLAB homework.  I'm able to calculate this in MATLAB but pylab is still a bit of a mystery to me.</p>

<p>So, I have a text file of equations that I'm trying to convert into the the same form of A x = b and then solve some linear algebra problems associated with them in PYLAB.</p>

<p>The text file, ""equations.txt"",contains collections of linear equations in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>-38 y1  +  35 y2  +  31 y3  = -3047

11 y1  + -13 y2  + -34 y3  = 784

34 y1  + -21 y2  +  19 y3  = 2949
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>The file contains the equations for four sets of equations, each set with a different number of variables. Each set of equations is of the exact form shown (3 examples above) with one empty line between each set.</p>

<p>I want to write a program to read all the sets of equations in the files, convert sets of equations into a matrix equation <code>A x = b</code>, and solve the set of equations for the vector <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>My approach has been very ""MATLABy"", which is a problem because I want to be able to write a program that will solve for all of the variables.</p>

<p>I've tried reading a single equation as a text line, stripped of the carriage return at the end, and splitting line at the <code>=</code> sign because as we know the 2nd element in the split is the right hand side of the equation, that goes into the vector <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>The first element in the split is the part you have to get the coefficients that go in the <code>A</code> matrix.  If you split this at white space <code>' '</code>, you will get a list like</p>

<pre><code>['-38', 'y1', '+', '35', 'y2', '+', '31', 'y3']
</code></pre>

<p>Note now that you can pull every 3rd element and get the coefficients that go into the matrix <code>A</code>.<br>
Partial answers would be:</p>

<pre><code>y1 = 90; c2 = 28; x4 = 41; z100 = 59
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to manipulate them to give me the sum of the entries of the solutions <code>y1, ..., y3</code> for the first block of equations, the sum of the entries of the solutions <code>c1, ..., c6</code> for the second block of equations, the sum of the entries of the solutions <code>x1, ..., x13</code> for the third block of equations, and the sum of the entries of the solutions <code>z1, ..., z100</code> for the fourth block of equations.</p>

<p>Like, I said - I'm able to do this in MATLAB but not in Python so I'm probably approaching this from the wrong way but this is what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>import pylab
f = open('equations.txt', 'r')

L=f.readlines()

list_final = []

for line in L:
line_l = line.rstrip()
list_l = line_l.split("";"")
list_l = filter(None, list_l)

for expression in list_l:
</code></pre>

<p>and ending it with</p>

<pre><code>f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This was just my go at trying to format the equations to all look the same. I realise it's not a lot but I was really hoping someone could get my started because even though I know some python I normally don't use it for math because I have MATLAB for that.</p>

<p>I think this could be useful for many of us who have prior MATLAB experience but not pylab.
How would you go around this?  Thank you!</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($this as $that) {
    $test1[] = $that-&gt;testing1;
    $test2[] = $that-&gt;testing2;
    $test3[] = $that-&gt;testing3;

$all = array(""Test1"" =&gt; $test1, ""Test2"" =&gt; $test2, ""Test3"" =&gt; $test3);

<p>So if I want to run an array_unique on $test2 and it removes $test2[4], $test2[7], &amp; $test2[15], then I need it to remove $test1[4], $test3[4], $test1[7], $test3[7], etc.</p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what the best way to go about doing this is, so I was hoping that someone on here may have an answer since I have found numerous answers here on stackoverflow before. I tried searching everywhere for one, but I think my question is more specific than what I was able to find.</p>

<p>My reasoning behind this is that one of these arrays is loaded with images, but a lot of the images are duplicates, so I want to remove all of the duplicate images. But once I have removed all of the duplicate images, I still have full arrays in the other categories that I don't need any longer.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>doInBackground</code> of any instances will share the same worker
thread, i.e. one long running <code>AsyncTasks</code> can block all others.</p></li>
<li><p><code>execute</code>, <code>onPostExecute</code> and other ""synchronizing"" methods must/will always be executed on the UI-thread, i.e. not on the Thread, which wants to start the task.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I ran into trouble, when I tried to reuse some existing AsyncTasks in a background <code>IntentService</code> that are responsible for the client-server communication of my app. The tasks of the service would fight over time in the worker thread with those of the UI activities. Also they would force the service to fall back onto the UI-thread, although that service should perform its work quietly in the background.</p>

<p>How would I go about removing/circumventing these limitations? I basically want to achieve:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A framework that closely resembles AsyncTask (because I need to migrate a lot of critical code there).</p></li>
<li><p>Each instance of such a task should run its <code>doInBackground</code> on its own thread instead of a single worker thread for all instances.</p>

<p>Edit: Thx to VinceFR for pointing out this can be achieved by simply calling <code>executeOnExecutor</code> instead of <code>execute</code>.</p></li>

<p>The problem is about transparent PNG files in Monotouch:</p>

<p>I am trying to load a <strong>transparent PNG</strong> in a <strong>context</strong> in order to <strong>read and write pixel colors</strong>. I am using the code below, which works perfectly with non-transparent PNGs. (I am also including several other attempts made while trying to get the correct result)</p>

<p>With transparent PNGs the problem seems to be that I have to load the image in the context with premultiplied alpha info (<strong>CGImageAlphaInfo.PremultipliedLast</strong>). This causes RGB  values to be altered from their original values when loaded in the context.</p>

<p>I tried to create a context with <strong>CGImageAlphaInfo.Last</strong> (which is theoretically correct), but I get an exception (not acceptable parameter combination).</p>

<p>I thought of trying with CoreImage, but this would restrict our users to iOS 5 or later and I decided that this is not acceptable.</p>

<p>I desperately need to find a way to get and set pixels in transparent PNGs, since I am  creating a cross platform software (iPhone, iPad, Mac using MonoMac and Windows) that needs to process transparent PNGs.</p>

<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!</p>

At the moment, I'm doing the entire authentication and video streaming through a PHP script, however it tends to use a lot of resources and I'd like to use nginx to actually serve the file. To do that, I found you have to send the <code>X-Accel-Redirect</code> header from your PHP script which then hands of the file serving to nginx.</p>

<p>However, there's one problem, the URL of the video to stream isn't being served by the same server as this site. It's coming from one of my other websites which is on a different VPS server (and domain) entirely. Regardless, I tried this simple test script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

header('X-Accel-Redirect: http://other-site.com/protected/videos/test.mp4');
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't know what to use in my nginx config to serve the file at <code>http://other-site.com/protected/videos/test.mp4</code>, while still hiding the original video URL from the user.</p>

<p>When I access the above test script, nginx returns a <code>404 Not Found</code> and the error log has an entry like so:</p>

<pre><code>open() ""/var/www/site.com/web/publichttp://other-site.com/protected/videos/test.mp4"" failed (2: No such file or directory)
</code></pre>

<p>So, nginx is obviously trying to resolve <code>http://other-site.com/protected/videos/test.mp4</code> to a path in the site's document root, rather than recognising that it's a resource at another location and just ""proxying"" the file.</p>

<p>Anyone got any tips on getting this working?</p>

"9839676","1","9841733","","2012-03-23 13:02:13","","4","12730","<p>It seems that every week or so someone posts a question about dates being converted (corrupted?) to American format.  Like many others, I have attempted to help but the problem is elusive.  I now wonder if I have discovered the cause.</p>

<p>I am working on an application in which I need to extract data from an Excel worksheet and output it as strings formatted to match the value the Excel user can see.  So if the value is “1” formatted to display as “1.00” then I want the string to be “1.00”.</p>

<p>I achieve this effect by testing the cell value to be a number, date or time.  If it is, I retrieve the number format and use it to format the cell value so:</p>

<pre><code>With .Cells(Row, Column) 
  Output string = Format(.Value, .NumberFormat)
End With
</code></pre>

<p>In most cases this gives me exactly the output I require.  However, sometimes I get American dates and times when the source is formatted as a UK date or time.</p>

<p>After much experimentation with Excel 2003 and Excel 2007, I have discovered the cause.  (I do not have access to Excel 2010 but from questions I deduce it has the same problem.)  This question is in part intended to reveal this problem to the world because I can discover nothing on the internet to indicate that anyone else has noticed it.  (No doubt someone will reply that they googled “xyz” and got the answer immediately.)  However, the main purpose of this question is to seek suggestions for obtaining the result I need in all situations.</p>

<p>Typically I enter dates as, for example, “23mar12”.  Excel recognises this as a date and formats it as “23-Mar-12”.  I can select <code>Format Cells</code> and enter or select a custom format or select one of the date formats so I can have any format I can imagine wanting including non-English names for days and months.</p>

<p>However, in one case the format I select is not the format that is recorded: Custom format “dd/mm/yyyy” is recorded as Date format “* 14/03/2001”.  This is not obviously a problem until further down the line.</p>

<p>I created a column of dates and times and formatted each with a different custom or standard format.   I wrote a macro to extract the NumberFormat for each of these dates and times and write it as a string to an adjacent column.  I also formatted the value using the number format and wrote that string to a third column.</p>

<p>In a number of cases the format selected and recorded by Excel was not the format returned by NumberFormat:</p>

<pre><code>Excel format            NumberFormat
Date: * 14/03/2001       m/d/yyyy
Date: * 14 March 2001   [$-F800]dddd, mmmm dd, yyyy
Date: 14/03/2001        dd/mm/yyyy;@
Date: 14/03/01          dd/mm/yy;@
Date: 14/3/01           d/m/yy;@
Date: 14.3.01           d.m.yy;@
Date: 2001-03-14        yyyy-mm-dd;@
Date: 14 March 2001 (1) [$-809]dd mmmm yyyy;@
Date: 14 March 2001 (2) [$-809]d mmmm yyyy;@
Custom: hh:mm:ss        h:mm:ss
Time: * 13:30:55        [$-F400]h:mm:ss AM/PM
Time: 13:30:55 (1)      hh:mm:ss;@
Time: 13:30:55 (2)      h:mm:ss;@
Time: 01:30:55 PM       [$-409]hh:mm:ss AM/PM;@
Time: 1:30:55 PM        [$-409]h:mm:ss AM/PM;@
</code></pre>

<p>The values (1) and (2) in the Excel format column were added by me to indicate that there are two apparently identical formats.  As can be seen from the NumberFormat column, in each case the second version suppresses a leading zero.</p>

<p>Most changes have no important effect.  “[$-F800]” and so on are apparently dummy values with no effect.  Apparently you can replace “F800” with an Microsoft country code to have the names of days and months translated to the language of that country.</p>

<p>However, the three standard formats that Microsoft marks with an asterisk are changed unacceptably.  The dates are changed from little endian to middle endian; the time is changed from 24 hour to 12 hour and the day of the week has been added to “* 14 March 2001”.</p>

<p>The asterisk against the dates, references the comment: “Except for items that have an asterisk (<em>) in the Type list (Number tab, Format Cells dialog box), date formats that you apply do not switch date orders with the operating system.”  The asterisk against the time, references the comment: “Except for items that have an asterisk (</em>) in the Type list (Number tab, Format Cells dialog box), time formats that you apply do not switch time orders with the operating system.”</p>

<p>If I have to, I can warn my users that standard date and time formats may not give the result desired.  However, if they want the popular format “dd/mm/yyyy”, they cannot have it.  “dd-mm-yyyy”, for example, is OK but custom format “dd/mm/yyyy” becomes date format “* 14/03/2001” becomes “m/d/yyyy”.</p>

<p>Returning to my opening point: is this strange handling of one particular date format the reason so many people claim their dates are sometimes being converted to American format and is this why the problem is so elusive?  I have come across this type of problem elsewhere of one group of Microsoft programmers not knowing what another group are doing.  Is this why some functions always work and other sometimes don’t?  Some Microsoft programmers know where to look for the correct format and others don’t?</p>

<p>More importantly, for me, can anyone suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>How I obtain the true date or time format?</li>
<li>Some other way of determining the user’s chosen display format for a date or time?</li>
</ul>

<p>BTW 1: I recall that thirty or so years ago I was told that the American military do not use month/day/year format; only American civilians use this format.  Can anyone tell me if this is true?</p>

<p>BTW 2: The similar problem is with Excel colours.  Excel holds its colours as ""ggbbrr"" while everybody else holds them as ""rrggbb"".  The programmers for the .Net Excel inter-op were not told and and did not reverse the Excel colour number before using it to control the screen.</p>

<p>I have an absolutely positioned div - #img_bg - which contains a 1440px x 900px (243kb) background and I am animating the background using the following Coffeescript code:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready -&gt;
  img_bg = $(""#img_bg"")
  jq_window = $(window)
  scroll_ok = true

  setInterval (-&gt;
    scroll_ok = true
  ), 30

  parallaxScroll = -&gt;

  jq_window.scroll(-&gt;
    if scroll_ok == true
      scroll_ok = false
      scrolledY = jq_window.scrollTop()
      new_Y = scrolledY * 0.5
      img_bg.css ""background-position"", ""0px "" + new_Y + ""px""
      img_bg.height 900 + new_Y 
  )
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I've been using the setInterval throttling suggestion as recommended in this article: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8915376/jquery-parallax-scroll-events-performance"">jQuery Parallax / Scroll Events Performance</a></p>

<p>I've also tried setting .animate on img_bg using various animation speeds, to see if it 'smoothens' the scroll. It doesn't.</p>

<p>As for rendering, the jerkiness does not disappear when all overlapping DOM elements are removed.</p>

<p>Also, I have noted that decreasing the multiplier from 0.5 to around 0.2 does improve performance a small amount, however, the effect of the parallax is then rendered useless.</p>

<p>So, the questions is, are there any more techniques to solve the jerkiness?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;EditFormSettings EditFormType=""WebUserControl"" UserControlName=""~/UserControls/MyUserControl.ascx"" &gt;
    &lt;EditColumn ButtonType=""ImageButton"" /&gt;
&lt;/EditFormSettings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Within MyUserControl.ascx, I have a button which I'd like to trigger an event handler when clicked. The two ways I know of doing this are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>OnClick=""btnOkay_Click""</code> as a button attribute, where the event handler is in the code behind</li>
<li><code>CommandName=""Update""</code> as a button attribute, where this is handled by the event handler passed into the OnUpdateCommand attribute of the RadGrid</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these work. However my problem is that they stop working when the RadGrid is within a user control within a <code>Repeater</code> ASP.NET control. In this case, the button event handlers do not get fired (in either of the methods above).</p>

<p>I notice that when I bind my repeater:</p>

<pre><code>rpt.DataSource = Data
rpt.DataBind()
</code></pre>

<p>If I wrap that in a <code>if(!Page.IsPostBack)</code>, then the edit form doesn't appear at all when I click on the RadGrid row's edit link. So I had to remove that <code>IsPostBack</code> check. I don't think think this is the cause of my problem, as I've tried explicitly not doing this when clicking my update button (by breaking into the debugger). I just thought I'd mention it incase it was related.</p>

<p>Can anyone think of a reason why this would break in a Repeater?</p>

But this works only if I make visible the frame that I've tried to render.</p>

<p>The similar question that I've found is <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8008087/how-to-paint-an-invisible-jframe-elsewhere"">How to paint an invisible JFrame elsewhere?</a> that has the same issue, but the solution wasn't provided in answer.</p>

<p>A little of code.
I've created a <strong>JFrame</strong> and insert main <em>view</em> that I want to render.</p>

<pre><code>JFrame jframe = new ShowingFrame();
jframe.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(PDFHelper.getOriginalWidth().intValue(), PDFHelper.getOriginalHeight().intValue()));
jframe.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(PDFHelper.getOriginalWidth().intValue(), PDFHelper.getOriginalHeight().intValue()));
jframe.add(view);
jframe.setUndecorated(true);
jframe.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
jframe.setState(Frame.ICONIFIED);
jframe.setState(Frame.NORMAL);
//jframe.setVisible(true);
</code></pre>

<p>If I uncomment <code>jframe.setVisible(true)</code> than everything works.
But user will see this frame that I want to avoid.</p>

<p>So the question is: How to paint hidden control?</p>

<p>Inside Swing Component.java class all paint methods first check if the component is visible:</p>

<pre>
<code>

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        if (isShowing()) {
            // rest of the code...
        }
    }

</code>
</pre>

<p>I've tried to create inherit class <code>ShowingFrame extends JFrame</code>, that override <strong>isShowing</strong> and always return true. But this not helps to.</p>

<p>The process works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>request is received</li>
<li>request gets turned into a RequestObject</li>
<li>RequestObject is passed to the dispatcher</li>
<li>Dispatcher then routes and then calls the required controller.</li>
<li>Controller returns the results in a ResponseObject.</li>
<li>Dispatcher then returns the ResponseObject to the ""Front"" of the application.</li>
<li>The output is then echoed out.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is a special case (for ajax and flash frontends):</p>

<ol>
<li>The dispatcher will see that the request is sent to the ""endpoint"" controller.</li>
<li>The endpoint controller then dispatches the request to the actual requested controller as above.</li>
<li>A requestObject is then returned to the endpoint controller.</li>
<li>Endpoint controller then does its JSON or AMF encoding and this is echoed.</li>
<li>The script then terminates with <code>exit()</code>;</li>
</ol>

<p>I have created a <code>ExceptionHandler</code> class and registered it with <code>set_exception_handler</code>. At the same time I have created an <code>ErrorHandler</code> and using <code>set_error_handler</code>, all errors are then converted and thrown as exceptions.</p>

<p>All of this works well. I am however struggling with the problem when <code>ExceptionHandler</code> catches one of these exceptions. In the <code>ExceptionHandler</code>, the ResponseObject is modified to reflect the fact that we need to throw a 500 error.</p>

<p>I would like to somehow return the ResponseObject from the <code>ExceptionHandler</code> so the returned ResponseObject can be ""caught"" by the dispatcher and then rendered or transformed into a JSON or AMF response by the ""endpoint"" controller or the ""front"" controller.</p>

<p>Is this possible? If so, what's the best way to do this?</p>

<p>The distroData array is used for the series.  The distroDates is used for the categories.  I want the categories to display in the tooltip (rather than the usual series data) and I want the tooltip to update with the category values as I hover over each bar along the x-axis.</p>

<p>The following code accomplished this using Highcharts v2.1.4/Highstock v1.2.5 (both are loaded):</p>

<pre><code>            tooltip: {
            formatter: function() {
                var s = '&lt;table class=""tooltip distro""&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;';

                var categories = chart.xAxis[0].categories; //get the categories array
                var index = 0;
                var distroDataPoint;
                while(this.x !== categories[index]){index++;} //compute the index of corr y value in each data arrays
                $.each(distroDates, function(i, categories) { //loop through categories array
                    s += '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+ categories.name +':&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + categories.data[index] + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;'; //use index to peg categories and distro data to series

<p>However, when I upgraded to Highstock 1.3.4 (which includes Highcharts) the while statement locked my browser (FF and Chrome).  The browser gave the familiar ""Script is non-responsive"" alert I assume because it was caught in an expensive loop.</p>

<p>Say I have 2 controllers in an MVC application -
1 controls viewModels related to salespeople
1 controls viewModels related to sales</p>

<p>Each have a their own repository, which access data using Entity framework (code first)</p>

<p>both repositories are set up to handle dependency injection, but also have 0 argument constructors with defaults to use the appropriate EF dataAccess.</p>

<p>the salespeople controller uses a _salesPeopleRepository.getAllSalesPeople() function which returns a List of salespeople to populate an index view.</p>

<p>the sales controller needs to access the same list to populate a dropdownlist.</p>

<p>there are several ways to get the information to the sales controller, and I was wondering which options would be considered best practice:</p>

<p>a) In the controller</p>

<pre><code>db = new DataContext();
_saleRepos = new SalesRepository(db);
_salesPeople = new SalesPeopleRepository(db);
 .....
modelA.SalePeopleSelectList = SelectList(_salesPeople.getAllSalesPeople(),""id"",""name"")
</code></pre>

<p>b) in the SalesRepository - either using EF itself:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;salesPerson&gt; getAllSalesPeople()
{ 
    return _db.SalesPeople.ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>c) or instantiating and injecting the same data access object before calling the function</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;salesPerson&gt; getAllSalesPeople()
{ 
    return (new SalesPersonRepository(_db)).getAllSalesPeople();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>If the answer is a), how should custom buisiness logic be called from 1 repository - say for instance sales has a storeId and the repository checks that the storeId entered for the sale matches the storeId for the salesPerson. Should the salesPerson object used for buisness logic purposes (within the salesRepository) be accessed via the salesPerson repository, or directly from the dataContext object? </p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughts and experience</p>

<p>I want to process a string (<code>str</code>) so that any parenthesised digits (matched by <code>rgx</code>) are replaced by values taken from the appropriate place in an array (<code>sub</code>):</p>

<pre><code>var rgx = /\((\d+)\)/,
    str = ""this (0) a (1) sentence"",
    sub = [
            ""is"",
            ""test""
        ],
    result;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>result</code>, given the variables declared above, should be 'this is a test sentence'.</p>

<p><strong>Two solutions:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/guypursey/82APF/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">This works</a>:</p>

<pre><code>var mch,
    parsed = '',
    remainder = str;
while (mch = rgx.exec(remainder)) { // Not JSLint approved.
    parsed += remainder.substring(0, mch.index) + sub[mch[1]];
    remainder = remainder.substring(mch.index + mch[0].length);
}
result = (parsed) ? parsed + remainder : str;
</code></pre>

<p>But I thought the following code would be faster. It has fewer variables, is much more concise, and uses an anonymous function expression (or <em>lambda</em>):</p>

<pre><code>result = str.replace(rgx, function() {
    return sub[arguments[1]];
});
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/guypursey/8bL8a/"" rel=""nofollow"">This works too</a>, but I was wrong about the speed;  <a href=""http://jsperf.com/match-and-substitute"" rel=""nofollow"">in Chrome it's surprisingly (~50%, last time I checked) slower</a>!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>Three questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Why does this process appear to be slower in Chrome and (for example) faster in Firefox?</li>
<li>Is there a chance that the <code>replace()</code> method will be faster compared to the <code>while()</code> loop given a bigger string or array? If not, what are its benefits outside <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf"" rel=""nofollow"">Code Golf</a>?</li>
<li><em>Is</em> there a way optimise this process, making it both more efficient and as fuss-free as the functional second approach?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd welcome any insights into what's going on behind these processes.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>[<strong>Fo(u)r the record:</strong> I'm happy to be called out on my uses of the words 'lambda' and/or 'functional'. I'm still learning about the concepts, so don't assume I know exactly what I'm talking about and feel free to correct me if I'm misapplying the terms here.]</p>

I'm trying to learn VBA as best I can, by doing, and I just need a push in the right direction. The idea is I want to write a simple macro that looks at each worksheet, evaluates whether or not there is grouping in rows 19-43,if there is grouping, gets rid of the grouping, if there is not grouping, go to the next worksheet, and if there is no more worksheets, end the loop.</p>

<p>At Recommendations window fortify says : ""The root cause of a SQL injection vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to change context in the SQL query, causing a value that the programmer intended to be interpreted as data to be interpreted as a command instead. When a SQL query is constructed, the programmer knows what should be interpreted as part of the command and what should be interpreted as data. Parameterized SQL statements can enforce this behavior by disallowing data-directed context changes and preventing nearly all SQL injection attacks. Parameterized SQL statements are constructed using strings of regular SQL, but when user-supplied data needs to be included, they create bind parameters, which are placeholders for data that is subsequently inserted. Bind parameters allow the program to explicitly specify to the database what should be treated as a command and what should be treated as data. When the program is ready to execute a statement, it specifies to the database the runtime values to use for the value of each of the bind parameters, without the risk of the data being interpreted as commands.""</p>

I am experienced in using flex and bison, however this time, firs I develop a Scanner and then Parser. I test the scanner carefully and made sure it is error less. but as I add the parser to the project many errors occurred.(for example undefined reference to <code>yylex()</code>, however I declared <code>extern int yylex()</code> and I cannot use library as I will mention) and after that when I eliminate the parser, some features which worked before are not working now! for example, now I cannot use <code>#include &lt;QDebug&gt;</code>!<br>
When I use this header file, Compiler say there are many errors(77 error) in this library! I got confused, it has been two days I am working on this and there is no progress.<br>
I used ""Custom Build Steps"" and I set the path to <code>${sourceDir}</code>. In addition I added <code>lex.yy.c</code>,<code>y.tab.c</code> in <code>SOURCES</code> and <code>y.tab.h</code> in <code>HEADERS</code> in <code>.pro</code> file.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a class is a bean, or is referenced by a bean directly or indirectly it needs to be
  serializable. Member variables need to be marked as transient, static, or have
  accessor methods in the class. Marking variables as transient is the safest and easiest
  modification. Accessor methods should follow the Java naming conventions, i.e. for a
  variable named foo, getFoo() and setFoo() accessor methods should be provided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is it currently neither checks 'class is a bean, or is referenced by a bean' condition or even checks class implements 'Serializable' interface. So having dumb simple class with couple of private fields without accessors (even if class is final) you get major defect marked by Sonar. For most classes it looks funny so currently I definitely am going to deactivate this rule.</p>

<p>But I do like to have such check for classes that are real beans. Is it possible (and how) to do similar (but smarter) checks with Sonar and 'standard set' of open sources analyzers (CheckStyle, PMD, findbugs)? Is there any other way to do so?</p>

After the first roll, if I roll a 6 then the game stops and the score is recorded (without adding the 6). If a 6 is rolled on the first roll, that's fine and it's added like any other number 1 through 5. I'm trying to run a bunch of iterations of this game such that I have a long list of scores pre-bust (a bust being a rolled 6). I rearrange those scores to be in order from smallest to largest and then find the median of the list which is the score at which it is optimal to stop.</p>

<p>For some reason I keep getting 13 when I run the program but I know for a fact that the answer should be 15. Would using Random in Java would have some sort of effect on the median? I don't exactly know how Random generates the numbers and whether it creates them with equal opportunity. Also, is there anything that just pops out that shouldn't work?</p>

<p>The problem I'm running into is pulling data from the web and syncing with iCloud producing duplicates of the movies.</p>

<p>I originally thought I could add some logic in once iCloud finished merging changes, but that doesn't look very reliable as I could end up in a loop of changes between devices.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how this could be made possible? I'm sure people have done this before, I just can't find any helpful resources on it.</p>

I found myself correcting some bugs I found in the <a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/"">source code</a> that was published.</p>

<p>Does anybody know if there is gonna be some GitHub project where one could contribute to the project or is there another way to communicate bugs and feature requests to the developer?</p>

<p>Regarding the problems I had with Volley:</p>

<p>1. It seems that redirection does not work as it should:
Volley returns an error code <code>302</code> instead of redirecting to the location given in the response header.</p>

<p>2. Getting the cache directory does not work on my emulator running 4.2.2:</p>

<p></p>

<pre><code>cacheDir = new File(context.getCacheDir(), DEFAULT_CACHE_DIR);  
final String cacheDir1 = ""/Android/data/cache/"";
cacheDir = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + cacheDir1);
</code></pre>

<p>This workaround is platform specific, though. Just wanted to add it for completions sake.</p>

<p>Besides that I think Volley is really an awesome piece of code and exactly what I was looking for until I did it myself ;)</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>

<p>Here another link to the <a href=""https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/platform/frameworks/volley"">contribution page AOSP</a>. I thought its more a standalone library. I will check that out, although I still appreciate more infos and tutorials on Volley.
The source code I suggested is just a quick and dirty fix, which did the trick in my demo project.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>I found another <a href=""http://ogrelab.ikratko.com/android-volley-examples-samples-and-demos/"">interesting blog post by Ognyan Bankov</a> mentioned as a response to another question, which could be helpful.</p>

The problem is that some of the addresses in the database I am trying to validate are something like:</p>

<p>rather than</p>

<p>In my controllers I'm using <code>$user = $this -&gt; getUser();</code> to get the current user. But this returns an instance of <code>User</code> class and I cannot access the <code>SuperUser</code> properties or methods, even if the user has the role <code>ROLE_SUPERUSER</code>.</p>

<p>For instance I would be able to do :</p>

<pre><code>if($this -&gt; get('security.context') -&gt; isGranted('ROLE_SUPERUSER')) {
    $avatar = $this -&gt; getUser () -&gt; avatar;

<p>Is there anyway to be able to do that ? I would say there's something to do with Doctrine relationships but I don't really know what to change.</p>

<p>By the way, as you can see I don't have an <code>username</code> field in my standard <code>User</code> class, it's only present in <code>SuperUser</code>, does this may cause any problems since the authentication is a priori based on <code>username</code> ?</p>

<p>EDIT :</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>I think my problem hasn't been clearly exposed, but this might be due to my current code, which is wrong.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I do NOT have two user tables, I want only one <code>User</code> class (with one <code>users</code> table in DB). The authentication is operated only on this class with email and password.
Now I have another class <code>SuperUser```that provides extra fields to users that have role</code>ROLE_SUPERUSER<code>. But ALL superusers are users and have an entry in</code>users`` table. I just want to create a left join on concerned rows, that's why I used inheritance (but maybe there's a better way to do it).</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I want to get all emails, I can request my <code>users</code> table.</strong></p>

<p>At a new workplace we are using cc.net with surround scm and I'm trying to find something similar in surround. I haven't found anything like externals, only ""shared files"", but unlike externals, the shared files doesn't allow you to point at a specific revision of a file for the external.</p>

<p>I'm interested in what other people are doing in these scenarios to lean on their continuous integration and treat it more for integration than a ""continuous build"" server. Does anyone know of a tool or something to do ""externals"" behavior without using svn?</p>

<p>I suppose having an xml registry file of which projects depend on which assemblies and if they should be using the latest version but this seems like overkill.</p>

I have to test for incoming data from the temp table which is coming from some remote db. And each row value is to be tested for specific columns that it has maximum or minimum value which can be set into the column.</p>

<p>So I was to get the column specs using its schema details. I did make a <code>proc</code> for that:</p>

<pre><code>PROCEDURE CHK_COL_LEN(VAL IN VARCHAR2,             
                       MAX_LEN IN NUMBER :=4000,
                       MIN_LEN IN NUMBER :=0,
                       LEN_OUT OUT VARCHAR2)
        IS
            BEGIN
               IF LENGTH(VAL)&lt;MIN_LEN THEN
                    LEN_OUT := 'ERROR';
                    RETURN;
               ELSIF LENGTH(VAL)&gt;MAX_LEN THEN
                    LEN_OUT := 'ERROR';
                    RETURN;
               ELSE
                    LEN_OUT := 'SUCCESS';
                    RETURN;
               END IF;
            END;
END CHK_COL_LEN;
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem is, it is not reusable and is a bit hardcoded. I have to explicitly send <code>MAX</code> and <code>MIN</code> value for each value along with the data to be checked.</p>

<p>So at the <code>proc</code> call, it's something like:</p>

<pre><code>CHK_COL_LEN(EMP_CURSOR.EMP_ID, 5, 1, LEN_ERROR_MSG);
</code></pre>

<p>I instead want something like: (If something like this exist!)</p>

<pre><code>CHK_COL_LEN(EMP_CURSOR.EMP_ID, 
               EMP.COLUMN_NAME%MAX_LENGTH, 
               EMP.COLUMN_NAME%MIN_LENGTH, 
               LEN_ERROR_MSG)
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<pre><code>select max(length(col)) from table;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a solution, but again I will have to run this query each time to set the two variables for MAX and MIN value. And running  extra two queries for each value and then setting 2 variables will cost be significant lose in performance when in have about 32 tables, each with 5-8 varchar2 columns and average rows of about 40k-50k in each table</p>

<p>Firstly, let's take some annotation. Say <code>AssertTrue</code>. Now, the specs of the annotation is provided in <code>javax.validation.constraints</code>. Now, as such, AssertTrue does not really do anything. i.e. if I were to do the following</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass{
 @AssertTrue(message = ""MyMessage"")
 public myMethod(){
 //something
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this particular piece of code is not going to do anything but save the metadata info that on this method <code>myMethod</code> I have some additional info i.e. message and annotation. How I make use of this info is upto me.</p>

<p>This is where the hibernate-validator framework comes into picture. </p>

<p>What it does is, that it provides a bunch of classes and it takes in the object that is supposed to be validated. On that object, it will check if AssertTrue annotation is there. If found, it will invoke the method <code>isValid</code> that is provided in the implementation of the <code>AssertTrueImpl</code>.</p>

<p>Is this what is happening?</p>

<p>Also, I have a few questions. say I have my own custom annotation and I want to provide a framework that checks something. For the sake of argument, let's say I want to do what the hibernate-validator is doing. Now how does one go about it?</p>

<p>Also, when the JVM encounters some annotation, what happens behind the scene? Does it look for some implementation? What exactly does it look for?</p>

<p>i.e. what will JVM do if it encountered <code>AssertTrue</code> in my code. Surely it does not have to do much but store some information, and it does not have to go looking for any implementation too, since whenever I call <code>validator.validate()</code> that's when it will look for hibernate-validator implementation.</p>

<p>let me know if I have understood it correctly.</p>

<p>I have a label and a text field in a container view using the following visual format constraints:</p>

<pre><code>H:|-(4)-[label(labelWidth)]-(4)-[editor]-(4)-|
option = NSLayoutFormatAlignAllFirstBaseline

V:|-(4)-[editor]-(4)-|
</code></pre>

<p>For these constraints, the label is positioned outside the container view in the top-left corner of the screen (actually under the navigation bar).</p>

<p>When I add these constraints:</p>

<pre><code>V:|-(&gt;=4)-[label]-(&gt;=4)-|
</code></pre>

<p>the label is positioned 4pt from the top (matching the new constraint).</p>

<p>In both cases, once I tap into the text field opening the keyboard and then closing it again (no change is needed for this to happen), the label correctly aligns with the text fields baseline.</p>

<p>[EDIT: Added some screenshots]
Initial state:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WT1rf.png"" alt=""Initial state""></p>

<p>Keyboard opened:</p>

<p>Correct display after keyboard closed:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mdow8.png"" alt=""After closing the keyboard""></p>

<p>In the Xcode debugger, the baseline constraint shows as inactive before and as active after the keyboard was opened and closed.</p>

<p>It seems as if the baseline of the textfield is not (correctly) computed until after the first edit. Initializing the textfield with nil, @"""" or some text does not affect the behavior.</p>

<p>The question is, what's causing this behavior and more importantly, what can I do about it?</p>

The library itself is in C++, but as far as I can tell I've taken the step necessary to properly export the function to load the library. In a nutshell, this is the relevant section of my C/C++ code:</p>

<pre><code>extern ""C""
{

// This line is copied from http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility
// it's actually in a header, including it here for brevity
#define EXPORT __attribute__((visibility(""default"")))

EXPORT int luaopen_foo(lua_State* L)
{
    luaL_register(L, ""Foo"", fooL_table);
    return 0;
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>In my Lua script, I have this:</p>

<pre><code>mylib = package.loadlib(""libfoo.so"", ""luaopen_foo"")
print(mylib) -- prints ""nil""
</code></pre>

<p>The library is being created from a Makefile generated by CMake, and in the CMakeLists.txt I have tried compiling with various options, such as</p>

<pre><code>add_library(foo STATIC ${foo_SOURCES})
add_library(foo MODULE ${foo_SOURCES})
add_library(foo SHARED ${foo_SOURCES})
</code></pre>

<p>And none of these options appear to work. </p>

<p>Are there any steps I'm missing to make this work? I'm having a hard time finding information on how to do this properly online so any guidance is welcome. I'm using is Ubuntu with gcc to compile. </p>

<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/J6MPl.png"" alt=""http://imgur.com/09livAb"">
You can see the custom ""Container Controller"" view houses two Container Views, one which links to a Navigation Controller via embedded segue, and another that links to a custom ""Master View Controller"" (which implements a Table View Controller) via embedded segue.  The Navigation Controller component further has a relationship with a custom ""Location Filter Controller.""</p>

<p>I need to implement delegation such that when one of the UISteppers in the Location Filter Controller is incr./decr., the table view in the Master View Controller knows to update the data it displays accordingly.</p>

<p>I am not unaccustomed to working with protocols/delegates, but this unique situation of talking between views housed in segues is really tricking me! For the most part I have had success following the example here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5210535/passing-data-between-view-controllers"">Passing Data between View Controllers</a>.  In this case however, I am not able to directly link instantiated views as he indicates to do in 'Passing Data Back' step 6.</p>

<p>I had considered using a singleton object from which each of these views could get/set the necessary data, but the issue here is that the table view would not necessarily know when to update its contents, despite having data with which it could/should update.</p>

<p>Here is a code snippet from ContainerController.m where I setup the embedded segues to function:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
{
    DataHold *data = [[DataHold alloc] init]; // &lt;-- this actually is a singleton object

    if([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@""locationEmbedSegue""])
    {

    }
    else if([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@""tableEmbedSegue""])
    {
        [[segue destinationViewController] setDelegate:data.detailTableViewController];
        // ^ This part actually sets up a delegate so that the table view (Master View Controller)
        // delegates to the detail view controller of the overarching split view controller
        // and tells it what to display when a row is pressed.
    }

So I was following the author's instruction. Suddenly I tried to play the concept of Sealed with the base class. That's why I came up with this question.</p>

"690348","1","690387","","2009-03-27 16:00:23","","3","768","<p>I'm using TPTP to profile some slow running Java code an I came across something interesting.  One of my private property getters has a large Base Time value in the Execution Time Analysis results.  To be fair, this property is called many many times, but I never would have guessed a property like this would take very long:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass{
    private int m_myValue;    
    public int GetMyValue(){
        return m_myValue;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok so there's obviously more stuff in the class, but as you can see there is nothing else happening when the getter is called (just return an int).  Some numbers for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>About 30% of the Calls of the run are
on the getter (I'm working to reduce
this) </li>
<li>About 25% of the base time of
the run is spent in this getter</li>
<li>Average base time is 0.000175s</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, I have another method in a different class that uses this getter:</p>

<pre><code>private boolean FasterMethod(MyClass instance, int value){
    return instance.GetMyValue() &gt; m_localInt - value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which has a much lower average base time of 0.000018s (one order of magnitude lower).</p>

<p>What's the deal here?  I assume there is something that I don't understand or something I'm missing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does returning a local primitive really take longer than returning a calculated value?</li>
<li>Should I look at metric other than Base Time?</li>
<li>Are these results misleading and I need to consider some other profiling tool?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> Based on some suggestions below, I marked the method as final and re-ran the test, but I got the same results.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I installed a demo version of YourKit to re-run my performance tests, and the YourKit results look much closer to what I was expecting.  I will continue to test YourKit and report back what I find.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> Changing to YourKit seems to have resolved my issue.  I was able to use YourKit to determine the <em>actual</em> slow points in my code.  There are some excellent comments and posts below (upvoted appropriately), but I'm accepting the first person to suggest YourKit as ""correct.""  (I am not affiliated with YourKit in any way / YMMV)</p>

"22747344","1","","","2014-03-30 17:36:02","","3","131","<p>Please consider the following basic network setup :</p>

<ul>
<li>Machine A and B are part of a local network, and both connected to the network router.</li>
<li>Same setup for machine C, but on another router, far far away from the first one.</li>
<li>The network router is assigned an IP address visible worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/E1Ks3.png"" alt=""Basic home network setup""></p>

<p>As you can see, machine A is running a homemade server application, called myserverapp. This application is made in C, and listens on port 5000 for incoming packets/connections. It follows basic networking concepts, through IP sockets. With the above configuration, only machines A and B can reach this application (through 192.168.1.60:5000).</p>

<p>By setting a network port forwarding rule in the first router's configuration, I can allow 1.2.3.4:5000 to resolve to 192.168.1.60:5000 locally. Please note that <em>this requires an actual router setup</em>.</p>

<p>My objective here is to allow access to ./serverapp, <strong>without</strong> setting up a forwarding rule in the router's configuration. I would like my application to request worldwide IP binding by itself. As examples, Skype (not that much of a good example these days), Transmission, and many others, are reachable worldwide, but do not require me to set up a port forwarding rule for them.</p>

<p>Now, I am aware that this is a very recurrent question, but here are some additional circumstances :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tried <a href=""http://www.rapapaing.com/blog/?p=24"" rel=""nofollow"">punching a UDP hole</a> to allow peer-to-peer communication, but apparently, my router doesn't like it. Even though I can synchronise a list of peers through a relay server, the peers cannot reach each other afterwards. I am also unable to reach them using the <code>nc</code> utility, on the port given by the server.</p></li>
<li><p>UPnP is not enabled on many routers, even nowadays, and seems to be controversial. At the moment, this is not an option. Plus, note that this would also <em>require a router setup</em> (activating UPnP).</p></li>
<li><p>(from comments) My router does <strong>not</strong> forward any port by default : only those I set up. Plus, I am looking for a solution working on more routers than just mine.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that this <strong>is</strong> programming-related : I know this is mostly a network problem, but I am looking implementation solutions. I am not looking for help setting up the network itself (actually, this is precisely what I want to avoid).</p>

<p>Now, my question would be : <em>is there a well-known technique, applicable in C, to allow peer-to-peer communication behind a router ? Are there associated libraries ?</em> Many pieces of P2P software can be ran on most computers, even mine (for which I was unable to make a UDP hole), and I just can't figure out how they achieve this.</p>

<p>The issue arises when deploying in the server, we've been debugging and have discovered another team's contexts was accessing my beans (cross-referencing them by id) because we both are using Mybatis framework, so by declaring their bean with the same id they were getting access to my mappers and had a conflict I guess. The server throws and error referencing some autowiring problem but doesn't give much more information.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we've changed this bean ID and still have problems with Spring. ¿Do you know any other reason why the contexts are failing or why this bean crossreference? Could you recommend a tool to try to find out the error?</p>

<p>Some more info: we're using Atlassian tool ""Bamboo"" to automatize jar compilation. We've checked and our last jar version seems to be in use... I don't know what else I could tell you, I'm not an expert on this issue.</p>

Yesterday I finished writing my first multiplayer game (Pong) in C++ using Winsock and Allegro5. The game consists of one server for all players and clients.</p>

<p>Every frame (FPS = 60) clients send their mouse_y coordinates to the server which passes them to their opponents' clients respectively. When I play the game on my 2 computers connecting to the server, which runs on one of them, by local network it works perfectly, opponent's paddle is moving smoothly. But when I do the same connecting through my external IP address the opponent's paddle is lagging, which ruins the game, because it's client which checks if the ball hit opponent's paddle or not. Thus synchronisation is ruined, whenever I move one paddle to bounce the ball on the other computer it lags and doesn't make it in time resulting in scoring a point for opponent... But it's not the game which is lagging. My paddle and the ball are moving smoothly. The problem is only with opponent's paddle.</p>

<p>I'm new to network programming as I've only read <a href=""http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/"" rel=""nofollow"">Beej's Guide to Network Programming</a>.
I use TCP sockets to send() and recv() coordinates of paddles and select() function to poll sockets for data.</p>

<p>I don't have a single idea what could be the cause.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Opponent's paddle lags when I connect through external IP, but it doesn't when I connect through local IP.</p>

The machine is using Windows 7 Enterprise and it is 32bit. Although i think it is not relevant, i am working on a virtual machine (using Remote Desktop Connection).</p>

<p>The problem is that when an exception is generated in the Load method of a form, both VS and the program freeze/hang (actually, i can't even show a folder or go to desktop) and it just stops when I kill the process of the application i was debugging.</p>

<p>This happens in debug mode (F5) and not in non-debug mode (ctrl+F5). I searched a lot about this and this is a known issue for x64 machines. This is why I find it really weird that it is happening, exactly as a lot of people report for 64bit computers, but in a x86 architecture.</p>

<p>By now i am getting of by running the code i want to debug in another function besides the Load one, but in the future it might be problematic.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any kind of input.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I want to create a session vairable like the $_SESSION['user']= $user_email; which i can use in other pages. The problem is i don't know how to do so and i want to select a different row from my database called points. So it will be something like 
    $sql = ""SELECT id,user_email,points FROM users WHERE 
        user_email = '$user_email' AND 
        user_pwd = '$md5pass' AND user_activated='1'""; </p>

<p>Like i say i want it to select the number of points so it can be used on all pages where the session has been start.</p>

<p>Here is an account page which echos the logged in user. But i want it to also echo the points row from my database.</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;?php
 session_start();
 if (!isset($_SESSION['user']))
 {
 die (""Access Denied"");
 }
 ?&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;My Account &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;?php if (isset($_SESSION['user'])) { ?&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Logged as &lt;?php echo $_SESSION['user']; ?&gt; 

   &lt;a href=""settings.php""&gt;Settings&lt;/a&gt;

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Is the implementation I provided viable? </p>

<p>I'm not interested in whether Multiton (or Singleton) are in general good patterns, it would result in a discussion. I just want a clean and working implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Contras</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to know how many instances you want to create at compile time .</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No lock on whole class, or whole map. Concurrent calls to <code>getInstance</code>are possible.</li>
<li>Getting instances via key object, and not just unbounded <code>int</code> or <code>String</code>, so you can be sure to get an non-null instance after the method call.</li>
<li>Thread-safe (at least that's my impression).</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The outline for a sectioning content element or a sectioning root element consists of a list of one or more potentially nested sections. A section is a container that corresponds to some nodes in the original DOM tree. Each section can have one heading associated with it, and can contain any number of further nested sections. The algorithm for the outline also associates each node in the DOM tree with a particular section and potentially a heading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the same reasoning seems applied to the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#outline"">html5 document outline algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>I've been checking my site's outline using the HTML5 outliner (h5o) [<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/h5o/"">link</a>] tool but am having difficulty achieving a clear outline that isn't overburdened with useless titles, because of the fact that elements such as <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> will appear in your outline but will do so as 'untitled' unless you give them an explicit h1-h6 heading.</p>

<p>This seems frankly overkill for things like navigation or footers.</p>

<p>One solution is to replace these elements with divs, but that seems to defeat the whole purpose of using html5.</p>

<p>Another, which I've tentatively tried on my site [<a href=""http://donaldjenkins.net/"">link</a>], is to set headings for all sectioning elements and then use CSS to hide the headings for some of them (again, basically <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, as well as some <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;nav id=""content-nav""&gt;
    &lt;h2 class=""hidden""&gt;Post navigation&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li class=""alignleft""&gt;&lt;?php next_post_link('&amp;#8592; &lt;strong&gt;Next Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;%link') ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=""alignright""&gt;&lt;?php previous_post_link('&lt;strong&gt;Previous Post&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8594;&lt;br /&gt;%link') ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This results in a nicely-diplaying site, but the issue I see with it is Google ranking.  In its Webmasters Tool help item [<a href=""http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=66353"">link</a>] on 'hidden text and links', Google clearly states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hiding text or links in your content can cause your site to be perceived as untrustworthy since it presents information to search engines differently than to visitors. Text (such as excessive keywords) can be hidden in several ways, including: […] Using CSS to hide text…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people might feel that whether Google likes the fact they use hidden text or not is immaterial, but most of my visitors come from Google searches and I'd rather not be penalized as a result of choosing to go with this setup.</p>

<p>Can anyone offer advice on the subject?</p>

<p>I have one view controller and it handles all of the alert views in my app. I have another view controller that has a UITextView that the user can edit, and a save button. </p>

<p>When they hit the save button, if the text is already saved, it triggers an alert that asks them if they're sure they want to update, and if they confirm, it updates the file and gives them a second alert that says it was a success.</p>

<p>What's happening is that the keyboard keeps popping up when the second alert appears. I've tried resigning the keyboard and turning off the user interaction enabled flag on the text field as soon as the save button is hit. </p>

<pre><code>self.storyEditorTextView.userInteractionEnabled=NO;
[self.storyEditorTextView resignFirstResponder];
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried to turn it off when the alert is responded to (since some alerts can have a textfield).</p>

<p>To make matters worse, when I comment out the resign and userInteractionsEnabled lines, including the one in the alert, the keyboard still appears after the first alert is dismissed, disappears when the second alert is dismissed (if you can tap it because the keyboard covers it), and you can't tap into the UITextView and bring up the keyboard without going back to the parent view.</p>

<p>Here's the alert code.</p>

<p>I would that each consumer will be able to consume the full queue from start. (should display 1,2,3,1,2,3 or 1,1,2,2,3,3 ... nevermind)</p>

<p>One idea should be to clone the queue before spawning, but it's not possible using copy (shallow/deep) module ;-(</p>

what do you think of that ?</p>

<p>It's based on the idea of RyanYe. There is a ""master queue"" without a dispatcher.
My master queue override the GET method, and can dispatch to an ondemand clone.
And more, a ""clone"" can be created after the start of the masterqueue (with the __old trick).</p>

<p>I have the followong ViewModel that I'm passing to the view:</p>

<pre><code>   public class RegisterStudentViewModel
        {
            public Login loginViewModel;
            public Person personViewModel;
            public PersonResume personResViewModel;
         }
</code></pre>

<p>When the form is submitted, I use some validation logic to make sure the fields entered were applicable, and if any of the validation fails, I send the ViewModel that I'm using back to the view, to make sure that the fields that had information entered correctly are stored. Before this though, I have also made sure that the file uploaded is binded to the model that it belongs to, like this:</p>

<pre><code> if (res != null)
                {
                    PersonResume resumeViewModel = createResume(res, personModel);
                    vm.personResViewModel = resumeViewModel;
                }

                SetUpView(vm, da);
                result = View(vm);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>so that when the validation fails but the resume wasn't one of the fields that failed and I want to display the uploaded resume, I can use the following code in my view:</p>

<pre><code> @if (Model.personResViewModel != null &amp;&amp; Model.personViewModel.id == 0)
{
    &lt;th class=""editAddLabel""&gt;
        @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.personResViewModel.ResumeFileName, ""Resume File Name"")

    &lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;
        @Html.ActionLink(""View your resume"", ""linkDownload"", ""Student"", new { id = Model.personViewModel.id, resume = Model.personResViewModel}, null)

    &lt;/td&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>to pass to the following controller method that will allow the link to be downloaded:</p>

<pre><code>  public FileResult linkDownload(int id, PersonResumeViewModel resume)
    {
        DataAccess da = new DataAccess();
        PersonResume displayResume = new PersonResume();
        if (id != 0)
        {
            displayResume = da.getPersonResumeByID(id);
        }
        else
        {
            displayResume.ResumeData = resume;

        }

//some more code that downloads file
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know that in the view, the personResViewModel is not null, but when I look at the controller method, it is null and I can't do anything with it. Am I not passing my argument in correctly?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>create a back up array of the existing buckets  </p></li>
<li><p>allocate a new array of the requested capacity </p></li>
<li>go over the back up array and rehash each element to get
the new position of the element in the new array and insert it in the
new array </li>
<li>when done release the backup array   </li>
</ol>

<p>And the code structure would be like:  </p>

<pre><code>public V put(Object key, Object value) {  
   //code  
   //we need to resize)
   if(condition){  
       resize(2*keys.length);

  //step 2  
  //go over each element

    put(key, value);  
  }

<p>I was testing it on myself to see if it would work and in the process set an infinite loop, and emailed myself an unknown number of times. It was on my localhost using MAMP Pro.</p>

<p>The accident looked like this</p>
