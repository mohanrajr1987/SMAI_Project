<p><em><strong>MAJOR NOTE:</strong> The major reason I'd like to do this is to allow me to rapidly prototype an application, and then, after I'm done a major prototyping phase, take the scripts I was writing and compile them at build time instead. I don't ever plan on shipping an app with an objective c interpreter in it.</em></p>

<p>The reason i ask is that I've been playing around with <a href=""http://github.com/probablycorey/wax"">iPhone wax</a>, a lua interpreter that can be embedded in an iPhone app, and it works very nicely, in the sense that any object/method/function that's publically available in your Objective C code is automatically bridged, and available in lua.</p>

<p>This allows you to rapidly prototype applications by simply making the core of your app be lua files that are in the users documents directory. Just reload the app, and you can test out changes to your lua files without needing to rebuild the app in XCode - a big time saver!</p>

<p>But, with Apples recent 3.1.3 SDK stuff, it got me thinking that the safest approach for doing this type of rapid prototypeing would be if you could use Objective C as the interpreted code... That way, worst case scenario, you could just compile it into your app before your release instead.  I have heard that the lua source can be compiled to byte code, and linked in at build time, but I think the ultimate safe thing would be if the scripted source was in objective c, not lua. That way your source is always in objective c, regardless.</p>

<p>This leads me to wondering (i've searched, but come up with nothing) if there are any examples on how to embed an Objective C Interpreter in an iPhone app? This would allow you to rapidly prototype your app against the current classes that are built into your binary, and, when your about to deploy your app, instead of running the classes through the in app interpreter, you compile them in instead.</p>

<p>With the iPad and OS 4, bluetooth and virtual keyboards can work with iPhones and iPads... That's going to make this type of rapid prototyping something much more useful, at least for dev time. If you have an interpreter built into your app and have it on your iPad, for example, you can code against the interpreter while on the road, without XCode. And to me, the most useful way to get the source back to an ""apple approved"" state would be if the scripts were Objective C.</p>

"26940749","1","","","2014-11-14 23:50:10","","11","247","<p>TL;DR: It appears that type parameters of type aliases (e.g. <code>type T[X&lt;:Serializable]</code>) do not enforce their constraints when referenced as variables, parameters and perhaps other cases. Case classes, however, do enforce the bounds correctly for their parameters.</p>

<p>Consider a type alias designed to represent a subset of generic type. For example, let us say I want a type for lists of <code>Serializable</code> things:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; type SerializableList[T &lt;: Serializable] = List[T]
defined type alias SerializableList
</code></pre>

<p>Now say that I want a case class with a parameter of these things:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; case class NetworkDataCC(things: SerializableList[_])
&lt;console&gt;:9: error: type arguments [_$1] do not conform to type SerializableList's type parameter bounds [T &lt;: Serializable]
   case class NetworkDataCC(things: SerializableList[_])
</code></pre>

<p>Well, that doesn't work. Scala (annoyingly) does not carry the parameter bounds with the type, but it's easy to fix:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; case class NetworkDataCC(things: SerializableList[_ &lt;: Serializable])
defined class NetworkDataCC
</code></pre>

<p>Alright. Looks good. Now, what if I want just a regular class with those things, but I again forget to explicitly declare the type bounds. I expect an error:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; class NetworkData(val things: SerializableList[_])
defined class NetworkData
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, wait. No error... huh.</p>

<p>So, now I can do this?</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; new NetworkData(List(1))
res3: NetworkData = NetworkData@e344ad3
</code></pre>

<p>Well, that seems quite broken. The case class, works fine of course (because the restrictions were declared):</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; NetworkDataCC(List(1))
&lt;console&gt;:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: Serializable
              NetworkDataCC(List(1))
</code></pre>

<p>In my project, I am making use of reflection to generate some metadata about my classes. The metadata for the non-case-class shows a lack of bounds on <code>things</code>: </p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; classOf[NetworkData].getDeclaredFields()(0).getGenericType
res0: java.lang.reflect.Type = scala.collection.immutable.List&lt;?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas the case class is correct:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; classOf[NetworkDataCC].getDeclaredFields()(0).getGenericType
res1: java.lang.reflect.Type = scala.collection.immutable.List&lt;? extends scala.Serializable&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I wasn't able to find any bugs in the scala compiler bug tracker for this. Am I misunderstanding how these bounds should be used?</p>

"16747000","1","16747102","","2013-05-25 06:18:23","","0","34","<p>I'll have code embedded in HTML, it will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""someDiv""&gt;
{:
    HTMLObject
    id: form
    background: blue
    font: large
    fields [
        username: usr
        password: pwd
    ]

    foo: bar
:}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to write a regular expression that will take these HTMLObjects and break them into manageable arrays. I already have the regexp that will do the lines such as </p>

<pre><code>id: form
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'm having trouble with making the regexp also match ones like</p>

<pre><code>fields [
    username: usr
    password: pwd
]
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the function I have that performs these tasks:</p>

<pre><code>function parseHTMLObjects($html) {
    $details = preg_replace('/[{:]([^}]+):}/i', '$1', $html);
    $details = trim(str_replace('HTMLObject', '', $details));

    $dynamPattern = '/([^\[]+)\[([^\]]+)]/';
    $dynamMatch = preg_match_all($dynamPattern, $details, $dynamMatches);

    print_r($dynamMatches); // nothing is shown here

    $findMatch = preg_match_all('/([^:]+):([^\n]+)/', $details, $matches);

    $obs = array();
    foreach($matches[0] as $o) {
        $tmp = trim($o);
        echo $tmp . ""\n"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I pass an HTML string like I demonstrated at the beginning of the page, the <code>$findMatch</code> regexp works fine, but nothing gets stored in the dynams one. Am I going about this in the wrong way?</p>

<p>Basically all I need is each object stored in an array, so from the sample HTML string above, this would be an ideal array:</p>

<pre><code>Array() {
    [0] =&gt; id: form
    [1] =&gt; background: blue
    [2] =&gt; font: large
    [3] =&gt; fields [
               username: usr
               password: pwd
           ]
    [4] =&gt; foo: bar
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have all the sorting and manipulation handled beyond that point, but like I said, I'm having trouble getting the same regexp that handles the colon style objects to also handle the bracket style objects.</p>

<p>If I need to use a different regexp and store the results in a different array that is fine too.</p>

The previous instance must be destroyed before I can continue. I realize that Java doesn't provide for an implicit delete, and I've been trying to force garbage collection to get rid of it using a trick with a weak reference. </p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>private static void gc() {

    WeakReference ref = new WeakReference&lt;Object&gt;(obj);
    obj = null;

<p>So far, I've had no success (for hopefully obvious reasons). So, how do I delete an instance of <code>MediaHub</code>?</p>

<p>EDIT: The reason I need it deleted is because there is an android MediaPlayer used in MediaHub and when I need to switch songs I end up with two songs playing over each other. I'm sort of in deep with the code and I don't want to rewrite a ton of code. So I'm really hoping for an answer here...</p>

<p>now if i use code first existing database design approach, should i have separate models for each business concern or one design (ADO.NET Entity Model).

<p>hide = YES because i have other methods which unhides and hides buttons, but they doesn't works because in view my button is <strong>nil</strong>, and i don't understand why? Maybe my method should return these button? Thank you.</p>

<p>Is there a module or a recommended way to get all the explicit <code>import</code> statements from a Python source file?</p>

<h3>My research so far:</h3>

<p>I tried using this gem of a module: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/modulefinder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">modulefinder</a>. The problem in my case is that this lists <em>all</em> of the modules ever used by the source file, including all the implicit and implied modules recursively used.</p>

<p>I am looking for a way to just get the imports that the source file explicitly import, and <em>not</em> the implicit/recursive ones.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Taking this one right out of the docs:</p>

<pre><code>#bacon.py
import re, itertools

try:
    import baconhameggs
except ImportError:
    pass

try:
    import guido.python.ham
except ImportError:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>Now the modulefinder code:</p>

<pre><code>from modulefinder import ModuleFinder

finder = ModuleFinder()
finder.run_script('bacon.py')

print 'Loaded modules:'
for name, mod in finder.modules.iteritems():
    print '%s: ' % name,
    print ','.join(mod.globalnames.keys()[:3])

print '-'*50
print 'Modules not imported:'
print '\n'.join(finder.badmodules.iterkeys())
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Loaded modules:

_sre:
sre_constants:  REPEAT_ONE,makedict,AT_END_LINE

I am a bit confused about OpenID OAuth stuff.
(by OAuth - i mean OAuth 2.0 here and later)</p>

<p>My target is to create a site with OpenID (or OAuth) auth as well as with legacy
email + password auth. The site will be on django framework. (python)
I understand difference between OAuth and OpenID and diff between authorization and authentification.<br>
My primary goal is to implement openid login with google as identity provider.</p>

<p>The login and register flow must be just like on many sites.
As i see:</p>

<p><strong>register scenario:</strong></p>

<p>1) user enters openid url (clicks google button)</p>

<p>2) user gets redirected to auth provider ( google ) 
    page says: 
      ""Awesome site"" ask for your:
       email, language, country...</p>

<p>3) user says yes.. gets redirected back
    behind the scenes ""Awesome site"" 
    retries email language and other user info
    using access token</p>

<p>4) User fill other stuff needed in profile..
    and this is it.. hes now registered.</p>

<p><strong>Login scenario:</strong></p>

<p>1) user enters openid url (clicks google button)</p>

<p>1.a) if  user already logged in on auth provider 
    hmm... it is unclear to me.. but somehow user
    get logged in without displaying a provider page (maybe it is closes fast? )</p>

<p>1.b) if the user not logged on provider
    then provider displays login page and redirect back
    to awesome site on success.</p>

<p>Because i have to get some user data
it is seem to me that i have to use:
OAuth or Hybrid ( OpenID + OAuth extentions )
protocol.</p>

<p><strong>The things that are not clear to me:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>  How do i get scopes for info i need..   
    i searched but cant find.. found on someones blog   
    ""https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo#email"" for email  
    but how about user language, country.. etc.. where it is documented ?  

<li> If i will use OAuth - will it be enough  
    to do both - the registration and login  
    or i will have to fetch user data wuth OAuth  
    and login with OpenID?  

<li> Is it ok to use OAuth 2.0 in my scenario ?  
    or it will be more simple to use 1.0 because i dont need  
    user data anymore after initial account registration ?   
    (i think 1.0 is more complex because it has 3 phases ..  
     but 2.0 is more complex because access token expires.. but  
     expiration wont be a problem in my scenario as i don't need user data   
     after registration)  

<li> There are few libs lying out there:  
    while reading google api docs i found:   
    <ul>
    <li>google-api-python-client  
    <li>openid-python-openid  
    <li> gdata-python-client   
            ( supposed to be api to google services dont know if it has oauth in it  
              hm.. according to this   http://code.google.com/intl/ru/apis/gdata/docs/auth/oauth.html  
              it have oauth in it  
             )  
    <li>python-oauth-client  (http://code.google.com/p/python-oauth-client/)  
    <li> i though thats a lot but then found:  
    http://your-move.appspot.com  ( source files:  https://github.com/sje397/Chess )  
    which seems to be using google.app.engine lib  
    from google.appengine.api import users  
    </ul>
   So which one to choose ?

<li> So far i came that the simplest implementation would be:  
    Like this:  
        http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/source/browse/samples/oauth2/django_sample/buzz/views.py
    But lines 38-44: in my case would fetch user email language and other stuff (and also i will use other scope .. line 29 )  
    for a new registered user.. or if it is registered user just ignore credential and   delete it. ( continue with the site session )  

  Am i wrong ?  
  I saw so many implementation on libs mentioned above that i doubt that i am right.

<li> And also another question:
my fallback legacy auth will use email as login..   
If an identity provider is email provider ( google )..   
When user tries to log in i can fetch email from provider.. and search  
email fetched from provider in database.. so i can find user.  

What if identity provider not an email provider:  
like facebook ? How i will search user in database ?

<p>The problem comes in when a lot of programs, such as OBS, Fraps and many other programs that hook directx get their hook detected too.</p>

<p>So to be able to hook directx, you will most probabbly have to call VirtualProtect. If I could determine what address this is being called from, then I could loop through all dll's in memory, and then find what module it has been called from, and then sending the information to the server, maybe perhaps even taking a md5 hash and sending it to the server for validation.</p>

<p>I could also hook the DirectX functions that the cheats hook and check where those get called from (since most of them use ms detours).</p>

<p>I looked it up, and apparently you can check the call stack, but every example I found did not seem to help me.</p>

The expires and no-cache headers are not being sent and the resource (an approximately 4 MB SWF file) is being cached by Chrome -- despite the presence of the Last-Modified header.</p>

<p>Sometimes Chrome will get a 304 code, and other times it simply does a 200 (from cache). I understand the 304 -- Chrome is likely checking the most recent Last-Modified date with the cached version to decide. But other times it does the 200 (from cache), which does not return any header information and appears that Chrome is simply assuming the file hasn't been modified instead of checking. </p>

<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html"">Google's own site states</a> the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HTTP/S supports local caching of static resources by the browser. Some
  of the newest browsers (e.g. IE 7, Chrome) use a heuristic to decide
  how long to cache all resources that don't have explicit caching
  headers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this does not provide a definitive answer. Is this heuristic published anywhere? I realize there may not be a fixed answer (like 30 days), but some general guidelines would be useful. Furthermore, if Last-Modified is being set, I don't understand why Chrome isn't bothering to check that first.</p>

<p>Recently, for another project I'm working on I had to install the Sencha Cmd. It seems that the Sencha Cmd comes with its own phantomjs binary.</p>

<p>Now my Rspecs specs are failing with this error:</p>

<p>I've tried to reinstall phantomjs but didn't work.</p>

<p>Also I tried to edit my .bash_profile and change the order of $PATH from</p>

<pre><code>import timeit

""""""Test method returns True if either argument is falsey, else False.""""""

def and_chk((a, b)):
    if not (a and b):
        return True
    return False

def not_or_chk((a, b)):
    if not a or not b:
        return True
    return False
</code></pre>

<p>...and got these results:</p>

<pre><code> VALUES FOR a,b -&gt;      0,0         0,1         1,0         1,1
        method
    and_chk(a,b)    0.95559     0.98646     0.95138     0.98788
 not_or_chk(a,b)    0.96804     1.07323     0.96015     1.05874
                                            ...seconds per 1,111,111 cycles.
</code></pre>

<p>The difference in efficiency is between one and nine percent, always in favour of <code>if not (a and b)</code>, which is the opposite of what I might expect since I understand that <code>if not a or not b</code> will evaluate its terms (<code>if not a</code> and then <code>if not b</code>) in order, running the <code>if</code> block once it encounters a true expression (and there are no <code>and</code> clauses). In contrast, the <code>and_chk</code> method needs to evaluate <em>both</em> clauses before it can return any result to the <code>if not..</code> that wraps it.</p>

<p>The timing results, however, disprove this understanding. How, then, is the <code>if</code> condition being evaluated? I am perfectly aware of the fact that this degree of microoptimization is practically, if not completely, pointless. I just want to understand how Python is going about it.</p>

<hr>

<p>For completion's sake, this is how I set up <code>timeit</code>...</p>

<pre><code>cyc = 1111111

bothFalse_and = iter([(0,0)] * cyc)

<p>As you can see - the dashed line at the top is noticeably thicker than the bottom one and I have no idea why. Below is the code used by the two <code>UIViews</code> in their <code>drawRect</code> methods. If you have any idea why this is happening then I'd appreciate your help and advice!</p>

<p>First View:</p>

<pre><code>CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(context, [[UIColor whiteColor] CGColor]);

CGFloat dashes[] = {1,1};

CGContextSetLineDash(context, 0.0, dashes, 2);

CGContextStrokePath(context);

SubUIView *view = [[SubUIView alloc] initWithFrame:rect];
[self addSubview:view];
[view release];
</code></pre>

<p><em>The view is definitely only being drawn once. I appreciate <code>drawRect</code> may not be the best place for adding a subview but the problem remains even with it added in the main <code>initWithFrame</code> method.</em></p>

<p>Second View:</p>

<p>I think this is the most I need to do, I do not need to call <code>m_stacks.clear()</code>. The reason is vector's destructor can automatically release the memory. But I still need the above code though, the reason is vector's destructor does not call its element's destructor.</p>

  <p>WHY is this correct behavior?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been working with PDO more and in particular playing with fetching data directly into objects. While doing so I discovered this:</p>

<p>If I fetch data directly into an object like this:</p>

<pre><code>$STH = $DBH-&gt;prepare('SELECT first_name, address from people WHERE 1');
$obj = $STH-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_CLASS, 'person');
</code></pre>

<p>and have an object like this:</p>

<pre><code>class person {
  public $first_name;
  public $address;

  function __construct() {
    $this-&gt;first_name = $this-&gt;first_name . "" is the name"";
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It shows me that the properties are being assigned before the __construct is being called -- because the names all have "" is the name"" appended. </p>

<p>Is this some bug (in which case I can't/won't count on it) or is this The Way It Should Be. Because it's really quite a nice thing the way it works currently.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Apparently, <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/php-bugs@lists.php.net/msg116627.html"">according to one of the maintainers</a> this is not a bug. Someone posted it as a bug in 2008, to which the reply was 'its not a bug, read the docs'.</p>

<p>However, I'd really like to know WHY this is correct behavior.</p>

I am working on a question answering system that needs to analyze if the text input by user is a question.

I think the problem can probably be solved by using opensource NLP libraries but its obviously more complicated than simple part of speech tagging. So if someone can instead tell the algorithm for it by using an existing opensource NLP library, that would be good too.

Also let me know if you know a library/toolkit that uses data mining to solve this problem. Although it will be difficult to get sufficient data for training purposes, I will be able to use stack exchange data for training.</p>

I thought about using Newton-Raphson method to perform the solution. Unlukily I didn't find a source code that can do that for me. There would be someone that knows a program like that? I'm near deciding to build it myself. Thanks</p>

<p>I would be performing lookups on this data structure. What would be the most appropriate data structure to achieve my purpose? I have heard recommendations about <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis"">Redis</a>. Would it be worth looking into it rather than the traditional python data structure? If not, please suggest other mechanisms.</p>

<p>Searching for this online, the only documentation I can find states that GAE, which uses JDO (DataNucleus), requires post-compilation ""enhancement"" (which I <em>assume</em> means bytecode generation?!?), and that this dialog gives you the ability to specify which classes get ""enhanced""?</p>

Entity
 entity_id

<p>Both tables have the same column names but only the ID column has a different name. I would like to run a query so that when i run it from SQL plus i just give it a parameter and it gets the data from one of the tables. In the above example i could run the query like this</p>

<pre><code>@archiveHistory.sql product
@archiveHistory.sql entity
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my attempt but it always failed to recognise one of the columns, i.e. if i run it with product, it says entity_id does not exist. if i run it with entity it says product_id does not exist. </p>

<p><em>Note that i am using the passed in parameter on both the column selection and the table name selection.</em> </p>

Select * from (

  when entity then entity_id

<p>Based on this information, I pass each mapPoint into a google maps marker, and label them based on their names. I then update a dynamic checkbox based on the squad names given, removing duplicates. Now, whenever I try and toggle visibility of all points associated with a squad name it only removes one point instead of all of them. Any help would be very appreciated!</p>

<pre><code>function updateCheckbox(names,markers){

var checkbox = $(""#checkBoxes"");

//check if names return null if names !=null create a dynamic list of  checkboxes
//based on live squads


if(names!=null){
var $ctrl = $('&lt;input/&gt;').attr({type:'checkbox', checked:'yes',name:'chk'});
$(""#checkBoxes"").append($ctrl);


//designate squad name to each checkbox
$ctrl.after(names);
console.log(names);
 // toggle display of the squads


 }


 $($ctrl).click(function () {
if (this.checked) {
    if (markers) {
        for (var i=0; i&lt;markers.length;i++) {
            if(markers[i].labelContent==markers){

<p>The system also has users outside of any organisation, who are able to view anything within the system. When one of these users logs in, they get given a list of organisations that they would like to view. Selecting one should then give them a view of the system as if they were logged in as a standard user, but retain their superuser privileges.</p>

<p>Is there a nice way I can have the system know that a particular organisations has been selected and not have to have a nested resource for every path?</p>

And if I do keep them in a database, how should I format my show.html.erb which is going to go into greater detail about the animal selected from my index.html.erb page? Use if, else if, etc... or make a page specific to each animal and just redirect there when the animal is selected?</p>

<pre><code>  ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger logF = (ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger) LoggerFactory.getLogger(""com.my.com.pany"");

}
</code></pre>

<p>Could somone help me with this issue?
EDIT: Upon some further investigation I can see that <code>LogF</code> has <code>appenderList</code> of size 1 which has my custom <code>RollingPolicy</code> properly set. However <code>name</code> property of this appender is set to null and I think that is the reason why I can't get it by name. </p>

It works fine in most systems and in most of the browsers. But it fails (combined with ‘scrollmagic’, ‘fullpage.js’ and other script) in safari on random system versions (iMac, MBP) and random Safari versions (occurred in Safari 6, 7 and 8). In this case the browser just showed a couple of elements, struggled while scrolling and crashed after time.</p>

<p><strong>update:</strong> It works for tested devices in uncompressed, but not in the build version (r.js)</p>

<p>While I don’t know the reason for this behavior, I try to catch every mistake. I don’t know if the wrong behavior results from my lack of knowledge, if I do something completely wrong or if there is a bug inside one of the used tools. So I want to ask you – do you have any hints for me?</p>

<p>I’m not sure about the right implementation of plugins in requirejs. I think I got the right use for ‘scrollmagic’, but I’m not sure about ‘fullpage.js’. Is it possible to write a module-like use of ‘fullpage.js’ or is the use right as per particulars given below? Already studied the documentations, since I use all the stuff the first time, I would appreciate any help!</p>

It calculates the values of Euler's totient (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function"" rel=""nofollow"">phi function</a>) from 2 to a given limit (default 1,000,000). It does so by keeping a linearly ordered list of primes from previously computed values of Euler's totient. When attempting to add the 33791st prime number (339137) to the list of primes it results in a segmentation fault. Note memory isn't realloc'd on this computation. I tried using <code>gdb</code> to locate the problem and it pointed to the line where the the prime number is added to the list (see below).</p>

<p>To store all the primes below 1 million my program would dynamically allocate <code>8192*10*4</code> bytes <code>(320KB)</code>. Requiring that much contiguous memory doesn't seem problematic to me.</p>

<p>This question is not about how to create rule engine. I'm not writing one. My goal is to find way to maintain lot of rules in one place. and make it easy. I need some expertise advice how to do so, what approach to take. Below are examples what I did already to show that I'm working on this task and not simply ask somebody to do my job.</p>

<p>So far I have 3 approaches:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Array typed</strong>:
</p>

<pre><code>item=context.GetNextItem()
if ['banana','apple','orange'].Contains(item): EatRaw(item)
if ['banana','apple','potato'].Contains(item): BakeAndEat(item)
if ['meat','egg','potato','fish'].Contains(item): FryAndEat(item)
if ['pasta','egg','potato'].Contains(item): BoilAndEat(item)
</code></pre>

<p>2) <strong>Separated file for each item</strong>:
</p>

<pre><code>item=context.GetNextItem()
execfile(str(item)+'.py') 

#banana.py:
EatRaw(item)
BakeAndEat(item)

#potato.py:    
BakeAndEat(item)
FryAndEat(item)
BoilAndEat(item)
</code></pre>

<p>3) <strong>Database stored</strong>:
</p>

<pre><code>item=context.GetNextItem()
SQL = ""SELECT rule FROM rules where item='""+str(item)+""';""
for row in cursor.execute(SQL):
    eval( row.rule+""(str(""+item+""))"" )
</code></pre>

<p>Table RULES
</p>

<pre><code>banana,EatRaw
banana,BakeAndEat
potato,BakeAndEat
potato,FryAndEat
potato,BoilAndEat
</code></pre>

<p>3.a) <strong>Data in file</strong></p>

<p>File RULES.txt
</p>

<pre><code>banana,EatRaw
banana,BakeAndEat
potato,BakeAndEat
potato,FryAndEat
potato,BoilAndEat
</code></pre>

<p>This file could be considered as a UI.</p>

<p>Each approach has it's own cons and pros but, to be honest, I'm not satisfied with any. Files grow, became bulky, hard to search, maintain and understand. Any other approach or suggestion is welcome.</p>

<p>I've tried looping over <code>outings' and calling the</code>toObject()` method on each document, but that just returns the mongoose Document object as well.</p>

<p>What's also weird is that the statement <code>console.log('##################');</code> is never executed as far as I can tell (I don't see the output in the console).

<p>Thanks!</p>

In my case I already know what the file type and extension is (MS Word .doc).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The resulting file appears to be compressed. The reason I say this is if I view the source of the file in a text editor you can see the word Compressed at the head of the file. It is otherwise binary 'gibberish' of course.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not convinced either the data stream as saved in the database is compressed or just the resulting file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've tried a couple obvious things like renaming the resulting file to .zip, .rar as well as opening the file in a decompressing application. No luck thus far.</p>

<p>The following is the T-SQL code I used, as well as an overview of how the data is laid out.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @ObjectToken INT
DECLARE @Data VARBINARY(MAX)

SET @Data = (SELECT BigBlob0 FROM dbo.EventDocuments WHERE EventDocuments = 'exgADPVFFBNLP')
EXEC sp_OACreate 'ADODB.Stream', @ObjectToken OUTPUT
EXEC sp_OASetProperty @ObjectToken, 'Type', 1
EXEC sp_OAMethod @ObjectToken, 'Open'
EXEC sp_OAMethod @ObjectToken, 'Write', NULL, @Data
EXEC sp_OAMethod @ObjectToken, 'SaveToFile', NULL, 'C:/annuity.doc', 2 --server
EXEC sp_OAMethod @ObjectToken, 'Close'
EXEC sp_OADestroy @ObjectToken

<p>The are 10 columns of data type IMAGE along with a field called Sequence, as so it appears each file depending on size is divided up across one or more of the fields, and when more than 10 columns are needed a new row is added and the Sequence incremented.</p>

<p>My goal is to end up with a script that will extract all the files, how to iterate over the rows logically is one hurdle but first I need to be able to prove out the ability to extract just one, and so I select one at random that only spanned one IMAGE column.</p>

<p>Any thoughts, suggestions, ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

Well I found neo4j very nice and very suitable for my application, but as I've already wrote I'm new to this and I have some limitations in understending how it works. I hope you guys could help me to learn.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I embed neo4j in a servlet program then the database access I create is shared among the different threads of that servet right? so I need to put database creation in init() method and the shutdown in the destroy() right? And it will be thread safe.(every dot is a ""right?"") But what if I want to create a database shared among the whole application?  </p></li>
<li><p>I heard that graph databases in general relies on a relational low level. Is that true for neo4j? But if it is then I see an high level interface to the real persistence layer, so what a Connection is in this case? Are there some techniques like connection pooling or these low level things are all managed by neo4j?</p></li>
<li><p>In my application I need to join some objects to users and many other classification stuff. any of these object has an unique id (a String). then If some one asks to view some stuff about object having id=QW then I need to load the vertex associate to object.QW. Is this an easy operation for graph datbases? </p></li>
<li><p>If I need to manage authentications, so as I receive the couple (usr,pwd) and I need to check whether exists this couple in my graph. Is the same problem as before or there exist some good variation for managing authentications?</p></li>

I am creating a chat client that connects to a server that I have previously created (it was written in C). The client program is set up so that it has an <code>outTextArea</code>, <code>inTextArea</code>, and a <code>sendButton</code> (pretty basic stuff, but still - getting the basics down). I want the chat client to open the socket when the program is opened, which is currently opened in <code>main</code> (connection information hidden):</p>

<pre><code>    Socket sock = new Socket(""theServer"", 0000);
</code></pre>

<p>I know the program connects correctly, and remains open- the server current prints when an IP connects to the server, and then seg faults when a connection is closed.</p>

<p>Here is the problem: I am trying to send a string that was typed in <code>outTextArea</code> over that socket when I click the <code>sendButton</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public void send(String outbuffer) throws Exception {
   sendButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
                sendMessage sender = new sendMessage();
                sender.send(outTextArea.getText());
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The sendMessage class:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(outbuffer);
PrintStream printer = new PrintStream(sock.getOutputStream());
printer.println(outbuffer);
</code></pre>

<p>This is where I realized I can't send over <code>sock</code>, that was created in the <code>main</code> class. </p>

<p>I'm curious as to how I can access the socket that was created, if there is an alternative way to send a message without needing to create a new connection each time. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you.</p>

        }
</code></pre>

<p>where target is the cropped image. img is the originial image and cropRect is the cropping rectangle i want to crop.
Because i maintain the image size (no zoom) there shouldn't be any information lost.</p>

<p>Afterwards i am rotating the image using </p>

<pre><code>        target.RotateFlip(RotateFlipType.Rotate90FlipNone);
</code></pre>

<p>because it is 90 degrees rotation - it should remain lossless.
Is that correct?

It should be able to have any character in the strings, if a field contains a delimiter it needs double quotes around it. In order to have double quotes in such a field, the double quotes are escaped by . </p>

<p>I used this as a starting point: <a href=""https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled2/blob/695ee6603359cfcb97734edf6dd1d27383c48727/examples/src/main/scala/org/parboiled2/examples/CsvParser.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled2/blob/695ee6603359cfcb97734edf6dd1d27383c48727/examples/src/main/scala/org/parboiled2/examples/CsvParser.scala</a></p>

<pre><code>class CsvParser(val input: ParserInput, val delimiter: String = "","") extends Parser {
  def line: Rule1[Seq[String]] = rule {record ~ EOI}
  def record = rule(oneOrMore(field).separatedBy(delimiter))

  def escapedField = rule { capture(zeroOrMore(noneOf(QUOTE) | ESCAPED_QUOTE)) ~&gt; (_.replace(ESCAPED_QUOTE, QUOTE))  } 
  def unquotedField = rule { capture(zeroOrMore(noneOf(DELIMITER_QUOTE))) }
  def whiteSpace = rule(zeroOrMore(anyOf(WS)))
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I call it with <code>""quote\""key"",1,2</code> 
I get <code>Invalid input 'k', expected whiteSpace, ',' or 'EOI' (line 1, column 9)</code></p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? How would I debug this? (And as a bonus question: How would I extend the grammar to allow the delimiter to be multiple chars like <code>##</code>?)</p>

<p>Foo can have one-to-many Bars.  However, the association has attributes, such as a date range for how long that association is valid.  So, the way I have done this is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Association&lt;S, T&gt; {
     public S getSource();

     public T getTarget();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then for something like the above:</p>

<pre><code>public class FooToBarAssociation implements Association&lt;Foo, Bar&gt; {
    public Foo getSource();
    public Bar getTarget();
    public Date getFromDate();
    public Date getToDate();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the Foo class has:</p>

<pre><code>private List&lt;FooToBarAssociation&gt; associations;
</code></pre>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this an appropriate way to model the association with attributes?</p></li>
<li><p>Where should the business logic be for adding/removing the associations to Foo?  Creating a FooToBarAssociation will sometimes require a bit of business logic and I'm wondering if that should be handled in a FooService, which then calls setAssociations rather than being in the model object.  I've always heard to keep biz logic out of the model objects as much as possible.</p></li>

<pre><code>@Root(name=""root_tag"", strict=false)
public class XMLRequest {

  @Path(""a/b"")
  @ElementList(name=""routeList"")
  private List&lt;Route&gt; routes;

  public ArrayList&lt;Route&gt; getRoutes() {
    return new ArrayList&lt;Route&gt;(routes);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have several more dependent model-classes (like <code>Route</code>) written in a similar way with the proper annotations, the parsing an mapping works fine.</p>

<p>I now want to pass the <code>Route</code> list to a new fragment and display it in a <code>ListView</code>. There are quite a lot of variables in several more model-classes, so I just wanted those classes to implement <code>Parcelable</code> and pass the list like this to my fragment:</p>

<pre><code>public static ResultFragment newInstance(ArrayList&lt;Route&gt; routes) {
    ResultFragment fragment = new ResultFragment();

    Bundle args = new Bundle();
    args.putParcelableArrayList(ROUTE_LIST_KEY, routes);
    fragment.setArguments(args);

    return fragment;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>My problem: I can't let the model-classes implement <code>Parcelable</code>, that breaks the mapping with the Simple framework. I also don't want to write new Parcelable model objects, that's redundant work which increases when I have to adjust my model classes. Putting every single variable in the bundle is also not an option, there are too many and also too many lists.</p>

<p>What I tried so far as a work-around is to pass the result string to the fragment (instead of the objects) and do the parsing and mapping there. But the process takes a while and I only want to do it once and just use my model objects from there on.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a suggestion how I can solve this? I would really like to keep the <code>Simple</code> mapping, because manual parsing and mapping via XMLPull would be a lot more work. Thanks!</p>

The work is distributed into 'outboxes' for other robots to process.  Each job is represented by a row in the table.  Each row has an id which represents the box. Each job has a priority which represents the order in which the output robot will perform the work.</p>

<p>Today the jobs in inbox 1 is distributed evenly to each of the outboxes using a cursor, inbox 2 is processed next again using a cursor and so on through each inbox, priority is not considered so one outbox may have many high priority and the other outboxes will not have any high priority jobs.  </p>

<p>What I would like to find is a way to eliminate the cursor and distribute the jobs based on how many jobs are in the outbox which have the same priority as the inbox.</p>

The 12 items, 9 of which are ""in"" and 3 are ""out"", will be distributed across two ""out"" boxes.  The target count of items in the out box for priority 10 is 6.

Additionally, the alt text is showing in place of the image sometimes. I have checked and rechecked to make sure that the images are correctly linked. And the only way for me to get the alt to stop appearing is to delete it completely. Is this perhaps due to malware on my laptop corrupting some of the images and not others? Is there a way to fix this? I'm attaching a screenshot that has two examples. Most of the images are .png. I've also tried replacing the file and even changing to .tif and .jpg without luck.</p>

I also want to hide the content when there's a click on a wrapping container (in my application it's the document itself, but I used a regular div in my example below). As there is some more logic to handle I'm also making use of custom events that I fire via <code>.trigger()</code>.</p>

<p>This works fine but I have a problem. When I show the hidden content I apply an eventlistener to document to hide the content when the user clicks anywhere on it. This eventhandler is fired straight after the content is shown resulting in my content gets hidden immediately.</p>

<p>I can only get around this by using <code>$evt.stopPropagation()</code> in my toggle buttons event handler. But that's no solution for me as I need the event to bubble up as other elements listen for that.</p>

<p>Heres the simplified HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""document""&gt;
    &lt;button id=""btn"" type=""button""&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;div id=""content"" class=""hidden""&gt;Hidden Content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And heres the JS to this:</p>

<pre><code>//trigger custom show event
var show = function () {
    $(""#document"").trigger(""show"");
};

//trigger custom hide event
var hide = function () {
    $(""#document"").trigger(""hide"");
};

//handle custom show event
$(""#document"").on(""show"", function () {
    $(""#content"").removeClass(""hidden"");
    $(""#document"").on(""click"", hide);//add listener to container, fires immediately
});

//handle custom hide event
$(""#document"").on(""hide"", function () {
    $(""#document"").off(""click"", hide);//remove listener from container
    $(""#content"").addClass(""hidden"");
});

//on toggle button click call custom events
$(""#btn"").click(function ($evt) {
    //$evt.stopPropagation(); would work but event should propagate
    $(""#content"").hasClass(""hidden"") ? show() : hide();
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/7jws1cub/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSFiddle</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>What could I do about this? Stopping event propagation on toggle button click would show my content but i need this event to bubble up as there are other elements around waiting for that. How could I avoid that the applied event listener on document fires immediately?</strong></p>

<p>PS: jQuerys <code>.show()/.hide()</code> functions are no alternative for me.</p>

<p><strong>Loop Example</strong></p>

<p>This example is based on a screen group containing 2 screens ('Screen 1' and 'Screen 2').</p>

<ol>
<li>Start screen</li>
<li>Screen 1 (in the looped group)</li>
<li>Screen 2 (in the looped group)</li>
<li>End screen</li>
</ol>

<p>Screen group properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Loop index start: 0</li>
<li>Loop index step: 1</li>
<li>Loop expression: (Integer)context.getVariable(""i"") &lt; 2</li>
<li>Loop index variable name: i</li>
</ul>

<p>As expected, clicking next repeatedly results in the following screen flow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start screen</li>
<li>Screen 1 (i=0)</li>
<li>Screen 2 (i=0)</li>
<li>Screen 1 (i=1)</li>
<li>Screen 2 (i=1)</li>
<li>Screen 1 (i=2)</li>
<li>Screen 2 (i=2)</li>
<li>End screen</li>
</ol>

<p>I would expect the back button to step backwards through the history listed above. However, the actual behaviour is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>End screen</li>
<li>Screen 2 (i=3)</li>
<li>Screen 1 (i=3)</li>
<li>Screen 1 (i=3)</li>
<li>Screen 1 (i=3)</li>
<li>Start screen</li>
</ol>

<p>Clearly this is not what any rational user would expect. To complicate matters further, the <a href=""http://www.softpedia.com/progChangelog/install4j-Changelog-172405.html"" rel=""nofollow"">change Log Install4j for 5.1 Build 5435</a> includes the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fixed wrong behavior when going back in the screen history where
  screen loops were present</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other issue raised in this example, is how do you decrement the loop counter when stepping backwards? It would appear there's no practical way of doing this when using a looped screen group.</p>

<p>If this is case, the only way of implementing a loop which can be stepped through backwards is to implement your own screens in order to override <a href=""http://resources.ej-technologies.com/install4j/help/api/com/install4j/api/screens/Screen.html#previous%28%29"" rel=""nofollow"">previous()</a>. The side effect being that you have to hand code your screens just to get the correct back button behaviour for loops, which seems ridiculous.</p>

<p>Has anyone else found a decent workaround for this problem? The install4j manual is pretty lame in that the word 'history' only appears once. There's no specification for how the back button works whatsoever.</p>

<a href=""http://www.brilliantzenaudio.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brilliantzenaudio.com</a> </p>

<p>Note that there's a logo image at the top left. I'm trying to understand where this came from. The relevant code seems to be partly in header.php and partly in app.css. From header.php,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;header class=""banner"" role=""banner""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""container""&gt;

    &lt;div class=""row""&gt;
      &lt;div class=""col-xs-12 col-lg-2""&gt;
        &lt;h1 class=""logo""&gt;&lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo home_url(); ?&gt;/""&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo('name'); ?&gt;""&gt;Brilliant Zen Audio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
          ... stuff removed here, other items in header ...             
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the app.css contains lines as follows. Looking at the php above, I see that there is a  element of class ""banner"", so clearly there is css code addressing that (giving it a color, a position, border, and z-index). I also see that the header tag is also given the ""role"" of ""banner"". Does that serve any immediate purpose or is that for screen readers? </p>

<p>We can also see that the php contains h1 elements, and 'a' elements within 'h1' elements. CSS entries are there for those things. I'm not clear on what their purpose is. For one thing, the logo is an image. Why is it put in an h1 tag? I understand the need for the  tag because the logo should be clickable (to get back to the home page). But what is put as the text of the link is some next (I'm not clear on how to parse the PHP there. What's clever is that the image gets put there because it's the background in an ""h1.logo a"" css entry. </p>

<p>I've added some general questions in comments below.</p>

<pre><code>.banner { }

header.banner {
   background:#603913;
   position:relative; // question: what does this mean and how will it effect the position of things if I start moving or changing elements?
   border-bottom:solid 1px #fff;  // question: is this bottom border important for some reason?
   z-index:9999; // what does this do?
}
h1.logo {
   margin:0;  // is there a need to define these on h1.logo?
   padding:0;
}
h1.logo a {
   display:block; // what is display:block and how does it affect appearance? How would it affect changes if I change the size or location of the logo?
   text-indent:-9999px;  // what is this?
   background:url(../img/sm-logo.png) no-repeat 0 0;
   width:101px;    // what does it mean when you set the width and height of an &lt;a&gt;

<p>I basically have two content types which I want to filter based on groups and countries. On my site, all users are assigned to one or more Organic Groups, as well as a country. I want to create the following menu structure:</p>

<pre><code>News   
    Group 1
        Country 1
        Country 2
        Country 3
    Group 2
        Country 1

        Country 3
    Group 2
        Country 1
        Country 2
        Country 3

<p>If a user clicks ""News"", all news for all groups and countries are shown. If a group is clicked the news will be filtered to only show news posted for that group but all countries. And then finally filter on country if one is clicked.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of touch events set for that RelativeLayout. However, the com.sonyericsson.zoom.ImageZoomView also have its own logic to handle touch events.</p>

<p>When I perform any touch event in the screen, the touch listeners of the com.sonyericsson.zoom.ImageZoomView class is called first (which is what I expect). The problem is that, if I return ""true"" in that touch event, the touch listeners of the RelativeLayout <strong>ARE NOT CALLED</strong>. Whereas if I return ""false"", they are called but then, the touch processing that the class ImageZoomView did <strong>simply don't happen</strong>! (I guess because I returned ""false"" in the end, so Android simply ignores any UI updates that the touch events of the class com.sonyericsson.zoom.ImageZoomView previous made).</p>

<p>In short, I want to be able to process the same touch event in both my com.sonyericsson.zoom.ImageZoomView AND in my RelativeLayout.</p>

<p>Is there any way to do that?</p>

Now for one specific page that is created in the back-end of refinery, i want to use my own controller and views. All the User can do with this page is to set the menu-position, title, meta-info etc. The URL for this page has to look the same as all the other pages.</p>

<p>So for example, the menu structure looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>menux</li>
<li>menu1
<ul>
<li>menu2
<ul>
<li>specific page</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>menux</li>
</ul>

<p>And the URL for ""specific page"" looks like ""locale/menu1/menu2/specific page""</p>

<p>The site is available in multiple languages, so i have to create these routes for all languages.</p>

<p>Currently i'm creating the routes like this:</p>

<pre><code>specific_page_id = 1
Refinery::I18n.frontend_locales.each do |lang|
  slugs = []
  page = Refinery::Page.find_by_path_or_id(nil, specific_page_id)
  # get slug for page in current language
  slugs &lt;&lt; page.translations.select { |p|  p.locale == lang  }.first.slug

  # get all slugs from parrent pages
  while !page.parent_id.blank?
    page = Refinery::Page.find_by_path_or_id(nil, page.parent_id)
    slugs &lt;&lt; page.translations.select { |p|  p.locale == lang  }.first.slug
  end

  match ""/:locale/#{slugs.reverse.join(""/"")}""  =&gt; ""controller#action"", :via =&gt; :get, :constraints =&gt; { :locale =&gt; /#{lang}/ }
end
</code></pre>

<p>With this, i'm getting a route to the specified page in every language like described above.</p>

<p>But the problem is, when the user changes the name of the page or the position in the menu, the routes have to be generated again, which isn't done too often.</p>

<p>Now my question is, how can i do this more dynamically on run-time? I've read a bit about constraints but i don't know if this is what i need.</p>

I am using open source chef server and vagrant with <code>chef_client</code> provisioner. However each time a developer node is provisioned, <code>chef_client</code> provisioner creates a client node on chef server. This is not desirable because this setup will be used by a lot of developers. Such nodes might get created and destroyed several times. So maintaining the list of such nodes on chef server is not required.</p>

<p><code>chef_solo</code> is another option but it requires the cookbook to be present in the system. We are using chef server as a repository for cookbooks as well. So a developer need not have the specific cookbook in his/her system. I have looked at berkshelf as well where I can configure <code>chef_api</code> path to the chef server. But that too requires a node. Following is my vagrant file: </p>

This separate service should be accessed by multiple clients via TCP/IP telnet-style protocol.</p>

<p>How do I go about making the transition most simple?</p>

<p>Precisely, I'd like to keep this simplicity: I want to define every function just once. For example, if I want to add a pin code Login functionality to my app, I would just need to define the</p>

<pre><code> function Login(Username: string; PinCode: integer): boolean;
</code></pre>

<p>function in some object on the server, then I can use it from clients without any additional work.</p>

<p>In the worst case, I have to implement three functions instead of one. First, the function body itself on the server, second, the unmarshaller which receives a text line from network, unpacks it and checks for validity:</p>

<pre><code> procedure HandleCommand(Cmd: string; Params: array of string);
 begin
   ...
   if SameText(Cmd, 'Login') then begin
     CheckParamCount(Params, 2);
     ServerObject.Login(
       Params[0],
       StrToInt(Params[1])
     );
   end;
 end;
</code></pre>

<p>Third, the marshaller, which when called by client, packs the params and sends them to server:</p>

<pre><code>function TServerConnection.Login(Username: string; PinCode: integer): boolean;
begin
  Result := StrToBool(ServerCall('Login '+Escape(Username)+' '+IntToStr(PinCode)));
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, I don't want this.</p>

<p>So far I have managed to rid myself of the unmarshaller. Working with Delphi RTTI, I wrote a generic unmarshaller which looks for a published method by name, checks the params and calls it.</p>

<p>So now I can just add a published method to the server object and I'm able to call it from telnet:</p>

<pre><code> function Login(Username: string; PinCode: integer): boolean;

 &gt; login john_locke
 Missing parameter 2 (PinCode: integer)!
</code></pre>

<p>But what do I do about writing a marshaller? I can't dynamically fetch server function list and add functions to the client object. I can probably keep some kind of dynamic pseudo-function collection but that would make my client calls ugly:</p>

<pre><code>ServerConnection.Call('Login', [Username, Password]);
</code></pre>

<p>Plus, this defeats type-safety as every parameter is passed as a variant. If possible, I'd like to keep compile-time type-safety.</p>

<p>Maybe client code auto-generation? I can probably write ""GetFunctionList()"" and ""GetFunctionPrototype(Name: string)"" in my server:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; GetFunctionList
Login
Logout
IsLoggedIn

&gt; GetFunctionPrototype Login
function Login(Username: string; PinCode: integer): boolean;
</code></pre>

<p>So that every time I need to update the client, I just re-query all the function prototypes from the server and automatically generate marshaller code for them. But that would mix compilation with execution: I'd have to first compile the server, then start it and query its functions, then build a client marshaller and recompile client only after that. Complicated!</p>

<p>Another option is to write a generic marshaller function and then call it from all the client prototype functions:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TServerConnection.GenericMarshaller(); assembler;
asm
  //finds the RTTI for the caller function, unwinds stack, pops out caller params,
  //packs them according to RTTI and sends to the server.
  //receives the result, pushes it to stack according to RTTI, quits
  //oh god
end;

function TServerConnection.Login(Username: string; PinCode: integer): boolean; assembler;
asm
  call GenericMarshaller
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This saves me writing manual packaging every time (less chance for errors), but still requires me to manually copy server function prototypes into the client object. Plus, writing this generic marshaller is probably going to be a living hell.</p>

<p>Then there's the option of using RPC, but I don't like it because I'd need to re-define all the functions in IDL. And Delphi's IDL editor sucks. And for OLE interfaces Delphi forcefully generates ""safecall"" functions which suck, too. And there's no way to implement auto-detect-disconnect and auto-restore-connection functionality other than checking EVERY SINGLE function call to the RPC class:</p>

<pre><code>function TServerWrapper.Login(Username: string; PinCode: integer): boolean;
begin
  try
    RealObject.Login(Username, Pincode);
  except
    on E: EOleException do
      if IndicatesDisconnect(E) then
        Disconnect;
      Reconnect;
      RealObject.Login(Username, Pincode);
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>We're back to several functions instead of one.</p>

<p>So, what would you guys suggest? What are the other choices I'm missing? Are there common patterns or ready solutions for remoting in Delphi?</p>

<p>The width of the form is 500px, but the fieldName div and the fieldInput div stack on top of each other instead of sitting side-by-side.  This is because (at least in Chrome and Firefox), the fieldName div is getting a computed right-margin of 340px, taking up the entire width of the form.</p>

<p>I can't seem to override this behavior, either.  Entering a margin-right of 10px does nothing.  And setting the width of the div either to a hard number or a percentage only changes the inside width, not the strange right-margin.</p>

<p>BTW, here's the CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.formRow{
    padding: 3px 0 3px 0;
    position: relative;
    height: auto;
    width: 100%;
}

.fieldName{
    	font-size: 12px;
    	margin-left: 10px;
    	margin-right: 10px;
    	width: 100px;

}

.fieldInput{
    	width: 200px;
}

<blockquote>
  <p>=30-(SUMIF('Formulas for point transfer'!$A$2:$A$20,B2,'Formulas for point transfer'!$E$2:$E$20))+(SUMIF('Formulas for point transfer'!$B$2:$B$20,B2,'Formulas for point transfer'!$E$2:$E$20))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is to be used to calculate point transfers for babysitting swap hours.  I start out with 30 points, then if my name appears in column A, points from column E will be subtracted...if my name appears in column B, points from column E will be added.  This formula is working on the first row of data.  But when I copy/paste it to the rows beneath, it no longer functions.  I am keeping everything the same except for the search criteria (instead of searching for the text in B2 from the original formula, I changed it to search for text in B3, B4, B5, etc...for each new row of data) What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>A little more background info:
The data is originating from a google form that members fill out.  The results are loaded into a tab on my google sheet document. I have then created a new tab with an array formula to transfer the results from the form into a new sheet where I can add in the formulas I need.  I can't add the formulas to the original results page because each new form entry creates a new row and the formulas are not automatically copied into that new row. Perhaps there is an easier way to do this but I'm not experienced enough to know how.  Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>The goal is to wire up a hierarchy of ViewModels to a similar hierarchy of Models, so that the responsibility for presenting the information in each model lies with its own ViewModel implementation. (The pattern also crops up under other circumstances but MVVM should make for a good example.)</p>

<p>Here's a simplified example. Given that I have a model that has a collection of further models:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IPerson
{
    IEnumerable&lt;IAddress&gt; Addresses { get; }
}

public interface IAddress
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to mirror this hierarchy in the ViewModels so that I can bind a ListBox (or whatever) to a collection in the Person ViewModel:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IPersonViewModel
{
    ObservableCollection&lt;IAddressViewModel&gt; Addresses { get; }
    void Initialize();
}

public interface IAddressViewModel
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>The child ViewModel needs to present the information from the child Model, so it's injected via the constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public class AddressViewModel : IAddressViewModel
{
    private readonly IAddress _address;

    public AddressViewModel(IAddress address)
    {
        _address = address;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The question is, what is the best way to supply the child Model to the corresponding child ViewModel?</p>

<p>The example is trivial, but in a typical real case the ViewModels have more dependencies - each of which has its own dependencies (and so on). I'm using Unity 1.2 (although I think the question is relevant across the other IoC containers), and I am using Caliburn's view strategies to automatically find and wire up the appropriate View to a ViewModel.</p>

<p>Here is my current solution:</p>

<p>The parent ViewModel needs to create a child ViewModel for each child Model, so it has a factory method added to its constructor which it uses during initialization:</p>

<pre><code>public class PersonViewModel : IPersonViewModel
{
    private readonly Func&lt;IAddress, IAddressViewModel&gt; _addressViewModelFactory;
    private readonly IPerson _person;

    public PersonViewModel(IPerson person,
                           Func&lt;IAddress, IAddressViewModel&gt; addressViewModelFactory)
    {
        _addressViewModelFactory = addressViewModelFactory;
        _person = person;

        Addresses = new ObservableCollection&lt;IAddressViewModel&gt;();
    }

    public ObservableCollection&lt;IAddressViewModel&gt; Addresses { get; private set; }

    public void Initialize()
    {
        foreach (IAddress address in _person.Addresses)
            Addresses.Add(_addressViewModelFactory(address));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A factory method that satisfies the <code>Func&lt;IAddress, IAddressViewModel&gt;</code> interface is registered with the main <code>UnityContainer</code>. The factory method uses a child container to register the <code>IAddress</code> dependency that is required by the ViewModel and then resolves the child ViewModel:</p>

<pre><code>public class Factory
{
    private readonly IUnityContainer _container;

    public Factory(IUnityContainer container)
    {
        _container = container;
    }

    public void RegisterStuff()
    {
        _container.RegisterInstance&lt;Func&lt;IAddress, IAddressViewModel&gt;&gt;(CreateAddressViewModel);
    }

    private IAddressViewModel CreateAddressViewModel(IAddress model)
    {
        IUnityContainer childContainer = _container.CreateChildContainer();

        childContainer.RegisterInstance(model);

        return childContainer.Resolve&lt;IAddressViewModel&gt;();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when the <code>PersonViewModel</code> is initialized, it loops through each <code>Address</code> in the Model and calls <code>CreateAddressViewModel()</code> (which was injected via the <code>Func&lt;IAddress, IAddressViewModel&gt;</code> argument). <code>CreateAddressViewModel()</code> creates a temporary child container and registers the <code>IAddress</code> model so that when it resolves the <code>IAddressViewModel</code> from the child container the <code>AddressViewModel</code> gets the correct instance injected via its constructor.</p>

<p>This seems to be a good solution to me as the dependencies of the ViewModels are very clear and they are easily testable and unaware of the IoC container. On the other hand, performance is OK but not great as a lot of temporary child containers can be created. Also I end up with a lot of very similar factory methods.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this the best way to inject the child Models into the child ViewModels with Unity?</li>
<li>Is there a better (or faster) way to do it in other IoC containers, e.g. Autofac?</li>
<li>How would this problem be tackled with MEF, given that it is not a traditional IoC container but is still used to compose objects?</li>
</ul>

An <code>Event</code> is proposed by one class of users, then approved and edited by administrators. The problem for me is that there is a subclass of <code>Event</code>, <code>ScoredEvent</code>, which the administrators should be able to specify on-the-fly. This adds a <code>ScoredEvent.competition</code> foreign key and overrides the <code>Event.participants</code> to put them through a table that includes an associated score for each participant.</p>

<p>Ideally, a normal user creates an event containing only the name and a short description (easy enough to do by limiting the fields on the non-admin CreateEventForm) then the admins can go back in and fill out the other fields when they are approving the event.</p>

<p>The problem I'm hitting is I don't know how it would be possible for an administrator to change an <code>Event</code> to a <code>ScoredEvent</code> in the approval form view when they are editing it or how to make that happen. My vision of the page is an edit view with a checkbox labeled ""Tie To Competition"" that, when checked, would allow the admin to select a competition and then save the event as a <code>ScoredEvent</code>. If that box weren't checked, the event would continue it's life as an <code>Event</code>.</p>

<p>I have a javascript app I wrote some time ago for use with Adobe AIR that gathers some login/logout data from a sever and then displays it sorted by login name on the screen.</p>

<p>The data is received in timestamp chronological order ; for example here are the first three lines of the reterned data that I then parse into my array. The line format is timestamp, name, current status, last status change</p>

<p>I recently revised the app so I could port it on mobile devices.
Note that I am using PhoneGap Build to build my mobile apps as I don't have enough knowledge to try to do it myself with SDKs so I'm not sure if this also plays a part in the issue.</p>

<p>When I run my AIR app or the mobile version in the Android emulator my output is grouped by Name and then the login/logout details are chronological within the name.</p>

<p>BUT - When I run my App on my mobile device (HTC Desire HD) the output is still grouped by Name, but the data under each name is no longer in chronologial order for some reason and seems quite random in order.  </p>

<p>The key bits of code are below;</p>

<pre><code>function byName (a, b) {return a[0] == b[0] ? 0 : a[0] &lt; b[0] ? -1 : 1}  


var HistoryArr = new Array();
z = 0;
for (var i = 2; i &lt; myArr.length - 1; i += 4) {
   HistoryArr[z] = new Array(myArr[i+1], myArr[i], myArr[i + 2], myArr[i + 3]);
   z++;
}

HistoryArr.sort(byName);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if I should be doing the sorting a different way, but what confuses me is that it works fine in AIR and the android emulator just not on the phone.</p>

<p>So any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use a TextView in a TabWidget (i.e. call <code>TabHost.TabSpec.setIndicator(View)</code> instead of <code>TabHost.TabSpec.setIndicator(String)</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>And i want to configure that TextView in XML instead of building it programatically.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So initially, in my layout XML, i had:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabHost
    android:id=""@+id/mainTabHost""
    android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
    android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
    &lt;TabWidget android:id=""@android:id/tabs"" android:layout_width=""fill_parent"" android:layout_height=""30px""/&gt;
    &lt;FrameLayout
        android:id=""@android:id/tabcontent""
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
        android:paddingTop=""30px""&gt;
    &lt;/FrameLayout&gt;
&lt;/TabHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now i want to put in the TextView configuration somewhere. It does not actually ""belong"" nested anywhere within the layout hierarchy. But, since the layout XML have to be a valid XML of course, it can't have more than one root element. So i'm forced to nest the TextView somewhere. Hence i just put it one level below the root (TabHost):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabHost
    android:id=""@+id/mainTabHost""
    android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
    android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
    &lt;TabWidget android:id=""@android:id/tabs"" android:layout_width=""fill_parent"" android:layout_height=""30px""/&gt;
    &lt;TextView
        android:id=""@+id/tvTabIndicatorPreferences""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
        android:text=""@string/tab_name_preferences""/&gt;
    &lt;FrameLayout
        android:id=""@android:id/tabcontent""
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
        android:paddingTop=""30px""&gt;
    &lt;/FrameLayout&gt;
&lt;/TabHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in my code i do:</p>

<pre><code>final TabHost mainTabHost = (TabHost) this.findViewById(R.id.mainTabHost);
mainTabHost.setup();
final TextView tvTabIndicatorPreferences = (TextView) this.findViewById(R.id.tvTabIndicatorPreferences);
final TabHost.TabSpec tabSpecPreferences = mainTabHost.newTabSpec(""tabPreferences"");
tabSpecPreferences.setIndicator(tvTabIndicatorPreferences);
tabSpecPreferences.setContent(R.id.scrlTblPreferences);
mainTabHost.addTab(tabSpecPreferences);
</code></pre>

<p>but there's a problem here. When i try to run the application, i get an exception which says</p>

<pre><code>Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: The specified child already has a parent. You must call removeView() on the child's parent first.
</code></pre>

<p>which is by all means logical and reasonable. The TextView is already a child of the TabHost. i can't just set it as the child of another element. (Note: Putting the TextView nested under the TabWidget yields the same thing.)</p>

<p>so i'm forced to call <code>mainTabHost.removeView(tvTabIndicatorPreferences)</code> before calling the <code>setIndicator</code>.</p>

<p>It works actually, but this way of doing feels very wrong to me. Firstly, i have to put the TextView in the XML where it didn't belong, then in the code remove it from where it didn't belong before using it.</p>

<p>In such a scenario, what's the Right Way to achieve this?</p>

<p>However, the associations stop working when I add the following <code>after_save</code> callback to <code>question.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>  def create_matching_surveys
    self.reports.each do |report|
      report.reviews.each do |review|
        review.competitors.each do |competitor|
          competitor.surveys.find_or_create_by_question_id(self.id)
        end
      end
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in Rails Console, you get:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; @report = Report.create :name =&gt; ""foo""
=&gt; #&lt;Report id: 13, name: ""foo"", created_at: ""2013-03-05 10:20:51"", updated_at: ""2013-03-05 10:20:51""&gt;
&gt; @question = @report.questions.create :description =&gt; ""bar""
=&gt; #&lt;Question id: 24, standard_id: nil, description: ""bar"", element_id: nil, condition_id: nil, blueprint_name: nil, blueprint_url: nil, created_at: ""2013-03-05 10:21:02"", updated_at: ""2013-03-05 10:21:02"", additive: false, instructions: nil&gt; 
&gt; @report.questions
=&gt; [#&lt;Question id: 24, standard_id: nil, description: ""bar"", element_id: nil, condition_id: nil, blueprint_name: nil, blueprint_url: nil, created_at: ""2013-03-05 10:21:02"", updated_at: ""2013-03-05 10:21:02"", additive: false, instructions: nil&gt;] 
&gt; @question.reports
=&gt; [] 
</code></pre>

<p>This happens whether or not the report has reviews that have competitors.</p>

<p>The strange thing is I thought the callback was meant to happen after the question was saved? So by rights the association should save too before any of this happens, right?</p>

<p>How do I fix it?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I think I have to call the callback in the right spot in the object's life cycle, but I can't find that spot. Here's why I think this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; @report = Report.create :name =&gt; ""foo""
=&gt; #&lt;Report id: 20, name: ""foo"", created_at: ""2013-03-05 12:29:35"", updated_at: ""2013-03-05 12:29:35""&gt; 
&gt; @question = @report.questions.create :description =&gt; ""bar""
=&gt; #&lt;Question id: 31, standard_id: nil, description: ""bar"", element_id: nil, condition_id: nil, blueprint_name: nil, blueprint_url: nil, created_at: ""2013-03-05 12:30:14"", updated_at: ""2013-03-05 12:30:14"", additive: false, instructions: nil&gt; 
&gt; @question.reports
 =&gt; [] 
&gt; @question.update_attributes :description =&gt; ""foo""
=&gt; true 
&gt; @question.reports
=&gt; [#&lt;Report id: 20, name: ""foo"", created_at: ""2013-03-05 12:29:35"", updated_at: ""2013-03-05 12:29:35""&gt;] 
</code></pre>

<p>BTW, the method is now in question_observer.rb:</p>

<pre><code>class QuestionObserver &lt; ActiveRecord::Observer

  def after_save(model)
    model.reload
    model.reports.reload
    model.reports.each do |report|
      report.reviews.each do |review|
        review.competitors.each do |competitor|
          competitor.surveys.find_or_create_by_question_id(model.id)
        end
      end
    end
    return true
  end

<p>So my code goes like this : </p>

    import resource._

    val options = new Options()

            db.put(key, value)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And all is right with the world. But then if I try to open the created database and do a <strong>get</strong> on it : </p>

<pre><code>org.fusesource.leveldbjni.internal.NativeDB$DBException: IO error: .../leveldb-data/000081.sst: Invalid argument

    org.fusesource.leveldbjni.internal.JniDB.get(JniDB.java:77)
</code></pre>

<p>I managed however to make it by, not simply opening the created leveldb database, but repairing it beforehand... (in java this time) :</p>

<pre><code>factory.repair(new File(levelDbDirectory, ""leveldb-data""), options);
DB db = factory.open(new File(levelDbDirectory, ""leveldb-data""), options);
</code></pre>

<p>So, everything's all right then ?! 
Yes, but my only question is <strong>why ?</strong>
What am I doing wrong when I <strong>put</strong> all my data into leveldb :</p>

<ul>
<li>the open-stream to the database is managed by scala-arm, therefore closed properly afterwards</li>
<li>My JVM is not killed or anything</li>
<li>There's only one process, heck even only one thread - the driver one, accessing the database (via the <strong>toLocalIterator</strong> method)</li>
<li>and finally, if I open the database using the paranoid mode, leveldb doesn't care before I try to <strong>get</strong> on it. So the database is not exactly corrupted in its eyes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've read about the fact that the <strong>put</strong> write is actually async, I did not however try to change the <strong>WriteOptions</strong> to synced, but wouldn't the <strong>close</strong> method wait for the process to flush everything ?</p>

<p>I'd like to do it right, so any help would be appreciated.
Thank you for your time !</p>

<p>Following the sample suggested in 
<a href=""https://paypal-sdk-samples.herokuapp.com/merchant/mass_pay"" rel=""nofollow"">https://paypal-sdk-samples.herokuapp.com/merchant/mass_pay</a>
I'm able to create a ""mass payment"" with ONE receiver:</p>

<pre><code>@api = PayPal::SDK::Merchant::API.new

# Build request object
@mass_pay = @api.build_mass_pay({
  :ReceiverType =&gt; ""EmailAddress"",
  :MassPayItem =&gt; [{
    :ReceiverEmail =&gt; ""enduser_biz@gmail.com"",
    :Amount =&gt; {

@mass_pay_response = @api.mass_pay(@mass_pay)

# Access Response
if @mass_pay_response.success?
else
  @mass_pay_response.Errors
end
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: <strong>how can I build a mass pay object with multiple receiver?</strong></p>

<p>Following the documentation, I tried the following code with a number of variations, but Paypal seems to considers only the last item:</p>

<pre><code>        @api = PayPal::SDK::Merchant::API.new

# Build request object
        @mass_pay = @api.build_mass_pay({


        :ReceiverType0 =&gt; ""EmailAddress"",
        :MassPayItem0 =&gt; [{
        :ReceiverEmail =&gt; ""enduser_biz@gmail.com"",
        :Amount =&gt; {
        :currencyID =&gt; ""EUR"",
        :value =&gt; ""3.00"" } }],

        :ReceiverType1 =&gt; ""EmailAddress"",
        :MassPayItem1 =&gt; [{
        :ReceiverEmail =&gt; ""enduser_biz1@gmail.com"",
        :Amount =&gt; {
        :currencyID =&gt; ""EUR"",
        :value =&gt; ""5.00"" } }]
  }

)

(...)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I have an array of emails and values, so I  need to all them in the mass pay, how can it be done?</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like something:</p>

<pre><code>@mass_pay = build_mass_pay_with_array_of_email_and_values([ARRAY_OF_EMAILS_AND_VALUES_HERE])

I can easily make my pivots dynamic by using C# to create the SQL command from another query, but I still can't decide which way to do the pivoting itself, so I would like to hear some opinions on that matter from programmers more experienced than me..</p>

<p>I have three methods in mind. Lets say we have a simple table named tData with three columns: ""row"" represents the row number of that data,""col"" represents the column number, and ""val"" represents the value.</p>

<p>The orthodox method is to use CASE expressions:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT
      row,
      sum(CASE col WHEN 1 THEN val END) AS col1,
      sum(CASE col WHEN 2 THEN val END) AS col2,
      sum(CASE col WHEN 3 THEN val END) AS col3
FROM tData
GROUP BY row
</code></pre>

<p>However, I was thinking maybe it could be faster if I ditch the CASE statements and use a logical expression directly on the value, utilizing the fact that true==1 and false==0:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT
      row,
      sum((col=1)*val) AS col1,
      sum((col=2)*val) AS col2,
      sum((col=3)*val) AS col3
FROM tData
GROUP BY row
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect this method should be faster, since the CASE expression should have some overhead, but I'm not really sure.</p>

<p>The third method is a bit more complex: it uses JOINs to do the pivoting:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT
      rows.row,
      col1.valSum AS col1,
      col2.valSum AS col2,
      col3.valSum AS col3
FROM
    (SELECT row FROM tData GROUP BY row) AS rows
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT row,sum(val) AS valSum FROM tData WHERE col=1 GROUP BY row) AS col1
    ON rows.row=col1.row
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT row,sum(val) AS valSum FROM tData WHERE col=2 GROUP BY row) AS col2
    ON rows.row=col2.row
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT row,sum(val) AS valSum FROM tData WHERE col=3 GROUP BY row) AS col3
    ON rows.row=col3.row
</code></pre>

<p>True, those JOINs have a serious overhead, but from my limited experience when dealing with large tables SQL implementations can do simple filter-group-and-sum operations much faster than custom-data-manipulation-on-each-row operations, and that more than makes up to that overhead.
The problem is, those kind of SQL statements are more complex to generate, since each column appears in two places in the statement - once in the fields clause and once in the FROM clause, instead of just in the fields clause like the first two methods. Plus I need to be careful with all those temp table's names.</p>

<p>So, any opinions?</p>

  are  stored / read in the following location:<br>
  <strong>C:\Documents and Settings\LocalService/xmlvend/test-server/</strong> 
  Message invocation may be based on the standard XMLVend 2.1 WSDL, 
  by sending POST requests to the following endpoint address: 
  <a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8080/xmlvend-server/service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8080/xmlvend-server/service</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything seems fine, but when I click on endpoint address (above) I get the following error/exception message :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>exception :</strong> javax.servlet.ServletException: Failed to get
  reference to SOAP Engine
  xmlhttp.framework.MessageReceiverServlet.init(MessageReceiverServlet.java:50)</p>
  
  <p><strong>root cause :</strong> java.lang.Exception: No SOAPProcessor in context
  xmlhttp.framework.MessageReceiverServlet.init(MessageReceiverServlet.java:45)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I try to access the wsdl file (xmlvend-full-2.1.wsdl) of the web service I receive the same exception as above.</p>

<p>I also received the wsdl from the company but where should I place it?
Should it be placed inside the webapps/test-server folder of tomcat?</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me how I can get the web application to work?
Any help much appreciated, I have even configured the server for easy
VNC/RDP remote access please contact me if you can help me out.</p>

<p>Thank You</p>

<p><strong>My setup :</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Tomcat server 7.0.20  </li>
  <li>Java SDK/SE 7</li>
  <li>java version 1.4.2_03</li>
  <li>Windows XP SP3</li>

<p>I really don't understand what this is trying to do.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The code produces a regular ASP.NET <code>HtmlTable</code> and assigns it to <code>mytable</code>. On what planet can Excel open HTML?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm really kind of loss by the XML in general here, and by the <code>&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]</code> comment. Can anyone help me understand what is going on here.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The result appears valid but I'm just not familiar with what the intent is here. Any tips appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>On further testing, the problem seems related to the extension given to the file (xls). The current version of Excel will go ahead and load the file if I indicate that. But all formatting is lost. Any suggestions on what type of file this would be?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>And it looks like the original author got the idea from <a href=""http://forums.asp.net/t/1573064.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, although that page doesn't really describe what is happening.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for everyone's response. I will credit those replies according to how they addressed the questions above. However, for my purposes the code appears to have worked all along. It just appears that newer versions of Excel now warn the user that an XLS file that contains HTML is a file of a different type than suggested by the file extension. And it appears there is nothing that can be done about this except for exporting using CSV, OpenXML or some other approach. I found more details in <a href=""http://devblog.grinn.net/2008/06/file-you-are-trying-to-open-is-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog</a>.</p>

<p>Where children with <code>type ==='Folder'</code> is of my custom Folder class and <code>type !== 'Folder'</code> is an object of my custom File class.</p>

<p>How should i parse this JSON to be able to create new custom objects and store them in my file structure?
I have tried to do this, but i get stuck at the first level. I'm not that good at recursion which I suppose that I should do.
My code so far that works when there is only files/folders in the root and no subfolders/subfiles</p>

<pre><code>function importJson(json){
    var jsonObj = JSON.parse(json);
    //This line needs to be fixed when/if recursion?
    var currentFolder = rootFolder; //a global variable which is my rootFolder

    for(var i = 0, obj = jsonObj.children; i &lt; obj.length; i++){
        if(obj[i].type === 'Folder'){
            var folder = new Folder(obj[i].name, 'Folder');
            folder.img = obj[i].img;
            currentFolder.add(folder);
            console.log('A folder, check for children?');
        }
        else{
            var file = new File(obj[i].name, obj[i].type);
            file.data = obj[i].data;
            file.img = obj[i].img;
            currentFolder.add(file);
            console.log('a file');
        }

"32123539","1","","","2015-08-20 16:27:11","","0","48","<p>I have a huge layout file called visit_registration.xml. In order to support different screen sizes, I've duplicated the file and created the files layout-sw600dp/visit_registration.xml and layout-sw720dp/visit_registration.xml.</p>

<p>There is a single small difference between the layouts:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:orientation=""vertical""

    android:paddingRight=""@dimen/app_margin""&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:id=""@+id/visitRegistrationTextView""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:text=""@string/visit_registration"" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- TONS of UI elements here! --&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The original layout file (above) shows the TextView with the id ""visitRegistrationTextView"".</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:orientation=""vertical""
    android:paddingLeft=""@dimen/app_margin""
    android:paddingRight=""@dimen/app_margin""&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:id=""@+id/visitRegistrationTextView""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:visibility=""gone""
        android:text=""@string/visit_registration"" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- TONS of UI elements here! --&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Each copy uses a different visibility. The example above uses ""gone"". Sometimes the changes are different, but small, like a UI element moved to another place in the layout. The rest of the code remains the same.</p>

<p>The main question is about layout duplication. I don't want to maintain three different layouts because of the classical duplication problems like ""What would happen if I need to change a common UI element present in three files and forget to change it in a single place?""</p>

<p>Is it possible to have a single ""base layout"" with the common UI elements and include the small layout changes on it accordingly with the current screen size ?</p>

I'm using joda-time (1.6.2) on a project and one of the things I'm doing is getting the difference between a predicted time and an actual time.  Sometimes this difference is positive, sometimes negative.  While the appropriate approach may be to use a <code>Duration</code> rather than a <code>Period</code>, using a <code>PeriodFormatter</code> to display the result led me a question about the PeriodFormatterBuilder class.  As an example:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime d1 = new DateTime(2011, 6, 17, 13, 13, 5, 0) ;
DateTime d2 = new DateTime(2011, 6, 17, 10, 17, 3, 0) ;

Period negativePeriod = new Period(d1, d2);
Period positivePeriod = new Period(d2, d1);

PeriodFormatter pf = new PeriodFormatterBuilder()
    .minimumPrintedDigits(2)
    .appendHours()
    .appendSuffix("":"")
    .rejectSignedValues(true) // Does this do anything?
    .appendMinutes()
    .appendSuffix("":"")
    .appendSeconds()
    .toFormatter();

System.out.printf(""Negative Period: %s\n"", pf.print(negativePeriod));
System.out.printf(""Positive Period: %s\n"", pf.print(positivePeriod));
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this is:</p>

<pre><code>Negative Period: -02:-56:-02
Positive Period: 02:56:02
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that <code>Period</code> stores each component of its date and time separately, but to me, the expected behavior  of the <code>.rejectSignedValues(true)</code> method for building a <code>Formatter</code> would be to only show the <code>-</code> sign for only the first element like:</p>

<pre><code>Negative Period: -02:56:02
</code></pre>

<p>Am I misunderstanding the API, or is this a bug?  JodaStephen?  Anyone?</p>

<p>The work around to display what I want is not hard, but I'm just curious about the Builder approach.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
-Manuel</p>

<p>Means when click on any link then its all parent link and the same link should be active.</p>

<p>I have tried with this <code>javascript</code> code :</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {
        $('.hmenu ul li ul').find('li').click(function () {
            //removing the previous selected menu state

        });
    });

<p>Actually i don't have any experience with <code>js</code> coding, so i am unable to find the fault.</p>

<p>So the solution I came up with was to store all my model fields into hidden fields, and provide span tags that contain the visible data (these span tags become editable due to my jquery plugin).

<p>When the data goes into the hidden field originally (page load) and into the span tags the data is properly encoded, but upon the user changing the data in the contenteditable span field, I just run </p>

{'id':'003', 'name':'john', 'item':'scissors', 'price':'12.99'},
]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to find the best way to group dicts where the value of key ""id"" is equal, then add/merge any unique key:value and create a new list of dicts like:</p>

<pre><code>list_dicts2 = [
{'id':'001', 'name':'jim', 'item1':'pencil', 'price1':'0.99'},
{'id':'002', 'name':'mary', 'item1':'book', 'price1':'15.49', 'item2':'tape', 'price2':'7.99'},

]
</code></pre>

<p>So far, I've figured out how to group the dicts in the list with:</p>

<pre><code>myList = itertools.groupby(list_dicts, operator.itemgetter('id'))
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm struggling with how to build the new list of dicts to:</p>

<p>1) Add the extra keys and values to the first dict instance that has the same ""id""</p>

<p>2) Set the new name for ""item"" and ""price"" keys (e.g. ""item1"", ""item2"", ""item3"").  This seems clunky to me, is there a better way?</p>

<p>3) Loop over each ""id"" match to build up a string for later output</p>

<p>I've chosen to return a new list of dicts only because of the convenience of passing a dict to a templating function where setting variables by a descriptive key is helpful (there are many vars).  If there is a cleaner more concise way to accomplish this, I'd be curious to learn.  Again, I'm pretty new to Python and in working with data structures like this.</p>

I am guessing that there is some online concert database that apps like shazam use that i could intergrate with. 
Any help on building this sort of app would be appreciated, most importantly the notification system and how that integrates with another concert database and the users details .
I have a basic knowledge of php/mysql, I'm guessing I should use a framewok for this, if anyone knows one useful for this task that would be appreciated too.
Thankyou!</p>

407 status code) when using the System.Net.WebClient class.</p>

<p>In the field, we see many users receiving a 407 proxy authentication 
WebException, but I'm not sure what a good default strategy is.  In .Net 
2.0/3.5, the proxy authentication settings are supposed to be inherited from 
the Internet Explorer system settings.  Firefox, Opera and Chrome use these 
same settings.</p>

<p>Here's the basic code we are using:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Net;

string url = ""http://www.mysite.com"";
WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
byte[] data = webClient.DownloadFile(url);
</code></pre>

<p>When this code fails, we open the user's browser and send them to a help 
page.  From our web logs, we know these customers can successfully connect in 
their browsers.  Perhaps they are manually entering their proxy user name and 
password before they get to our help page?  We don't know.</p>

<p>It seems that we could use WebClient.UseDefaultCredentials, but this 
seems redundant if WebClient is using the system settings anyway.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

RenderMonkey makes this easy by providing it's own predefined variables (<code>rm_tangent</code> and <code>rm_binormal</code>) for this. I am trying to add this functionality to my own 3d engine. Apparently it is possible to calculate the tangent and bi tangent of each vertex in a triangle using each vertex's xyz coordinates, uv texture coordinates and normal vector. After some searching I devised this function to calculate the tangent and bitangent for each vertex in my triangle structure.</p>

<p>When I use this function and send the calculated values to my shader, the models look almost like they do in RenderMonkey but they flicker in a very strange way. I traced the problem to the tangent and bitangent I am sending OpenGL. This leads me to suspect that my code is doing something wrong. Can anyone see any problems or have any suggestions for other methods to try?</p>

<p>I should also point out that the above code is very hacky and I have very little understanding of the math behind what is going on.</p>

I need to be able to close my end of all the pipes and then wait for the subprocesses to finish their work.  So far I've only succeeded at closing each pipe and waiting for each subprocess to finish one by one.
More concretely, I'm doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for ($i=0;$i&lt;24;$i++) {
    my $fh;
    open $fh, ""|externalprogram $i"";
    $fhs{$i}=$fh;
}

#...now I can write output to the pipes
while (moreworktodo()) {
    $whichone, $data = do_some_work();
    print $fhs{$whichone} $data;
}
#Now I just need to wait for all the subprocesses to finish.  However, they
#need to do a lot of work that can only begin when they've finished reading input.  So I need to close my end of the pipe to indicate I'm finished.
for ($i=0;$i&lt;24;$i++) {
    my $file = $fhs{$i};
    close $file;  #unfortunately, this blocks until process $i finishes
    #meanwhile all the other processes are waiting for EOF 
    #on their STDIN before they can proceed.  So I end up waiting
    #for 24 processes to finish one-at-a-time instead of all at once
}
</code></pre>

<p>One way to get all the subprocesses to finish promptly (closing their stdin) is simply to let my script exit without closing the (pipe) filehandles at all, but that's no good because the script is part of a larger job that needs the subprocess' work to actually be done before proceeding.</p>

<p>What is a simple way to close each subprocesses' stdin (so that they can all finish working) and then wait for all of them to finish before proceeding?  I've tried forking off a child to close each pipe but that doesn't seem to work -- only the parent's ""close"" actually closes the stdin of the subprocess and waits for the subprocess to finish.</p>

<p>My picker View is supposed to show A list of name from the array, but there is nothing showed in my testing.
But the button works fine</p>

However I believe my algorithm would benefit from a breadth-first search instead of a depth-first one which you get from the List monad.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt showing the interesting part of my algorithm. It is a solver for the logic puzzle Akari.</p>

<pre><code>solve :: Game -&gt; [Game]
solve game = do
        let ruleBasedSolverResult = applyRuleBasedSolversUntilSteady game
        guard $ consistant ruleBasedSolverResult
        if solved ruleBasedSolverResult
                then return ruleBasedSolverResult
                else speculate ruleBasedSolverResult

speculate :: Game -&gt; [Game]
speculate game = do
        coord &lt;- coords game
        guard $ lightableUnlit game coord
        let solutions = solve $ light game coord
        if null solutions
                then solve $ exclude game coord
                else solutions
</code></pre>

<p>Basically it applies some basic deterministic rules to see if that solves it. If not it tries putting lights in various places. If a light makes a puzzle inconsistent after recursing to solve it places an exclusion mark where the light was and proceeds. If it finds solutions while placing lights then it adds those to the list of solutions.</p>

<p>This works fine, but is slow because often there is an obvious choice for which coord to speculate on that will quickly result in an inconsistent puzzle and let you place an x with just one (or two) levels of search, but if it doesn't choose that coord until halfway through the search then it winds up chewing a bunch of uninteresting stuff first. Thus the breadth-first search idea.</p>

<p>I have googled things like ""breadth first nondetermanism monad"" and I get a few results that are difficult for me to understand, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/control-monad-omega""><strong>Control.Monad.Omega</strong></a> This seems like overkill for what I need because it seems to guard against infinitely diverging determinism which is not the case for me, and I don't completely understand it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/weighted-search-0.1.0.1""><strong>Control.Monad.WeightedSearch</strong></a>  the docs for Control.Monad.Omega suggest using this instead when using it as a Monad, but I think weighting is also a bit overkill for my needs. I would likely just have 2 weights, one for things with solutions and one for things that don't have solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/sebfisch/level-monad""><strong>Control.Monad.Level</strong></a> I don't believe this will work for what I want since only the leaves of the tree have values.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.3.0.0/docs/Data-Tree.html""><strong>Data.Tree</strong></a> I think this might be what I want to use, but I'm not sure how to convert my List monadic code to use it, though I feel like there's a beautiful way.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My next question will be about how to parallelize it :)</p>

<p>How to find estimated  value for consumption for each month like:

<p>Like this the code should be able to list all the months, years and the estimated value for corresponding Serial number.</p>

<p>The logic behind the estimation for January for serial 123 is: </p>

<pre><code>Total number of days in January = 31, 
Consumption for the first 10 days = 200
Consumption for the next 21 days = number of days for January in (2013-01-11, 2013-05-13)
* consumption per day for the period (2013-01-11, 2013-05-13)
Adding both these I get the consumption for January =  472.5

<p>I have a <code>UIView</code> subclass that follows the <code>UIKeyInput</code> protocol. It receives keyboard input to do stuff that isn't related to entering text, so I'd rather not force it to subclass the former specified views because it adds bloat and would expose a bunch of properties that don't do anything, plus I'd need to work around the text entry that occurs natively to those classes (more bloat).</p>

<p>However, my <code>UIView</code> does need an input accessory view on its presented keyboard to function correctly.</p>

<p>I need a report of the difference between two revision inside a TFS project.</p>

<p>I'm building a simple patch system, and from an article I read on <a href=""http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/11/12/a-simple-system-to-patch-your-game-content/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""#AltDevBlogADay"">#AltDevBlogADay</a> describes this system. It says that if you can get the difference between your last patched revision release and the current revision that needs to be distributed for patching, all the files should be very easy to pick up/add/delete.</p>

<p>I tried googling, even the MSDN help on the tf.exe command line calls, but none of them help. I'm using the <code>tf hist . -r /version:C1~C3</code> command but it's only producing the name of the committer, the changeset number, and the comment that was left with the changeset, but no details on the individual files, and wheter they were added, created or deleted.</p>

<li>Applying <code>async</code> with <code>Task.WaitAll(Task[])</code> but this resulting in lots of errors as all tasks get created <em>very</em> fast but almost all result in connection errors.</li>

I have worked out the WordPress action hook for when the menus are updated,
<code>add_action( 'wp_update_nav_menu', 'write_html' );</code>
, but I need to also call my function when the header or footer sections are updated via pagelines.  We have custom sections that are being used for the header and footer areas.</p>

<p>I have looked through the Action hooks here:  <a href=""http://api.pagelines.com/hooks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.pagelines.com/hooks</a> 
and watched the hook tutorial here: <a href=""http://www.pagelines.com/docs/base-child-theme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pagelines.com/docs/base-child-theme</a></p>

<p>The video is talking more about Filters than Actions (using WordPress terminology) and the list of Actions in the api page doesn't show anything that might relate to updating a specific section.</p>

<p>So I have 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a pre-exisiting Action hook for when a custom section's site wide settings are updated such as through PageLines > Page Options and selecting the section?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, how can a custom Action hook be added to a section's update? </p></li>

<p>From what I understand, you can open a file in an application using a batch file by executing something like <code>start Notepad.exe ""path to text file\test.txt""</code> or something to that effect (I currently do not have a reference to that at the moment) but my main question is:</p>

<p>Is there a way to construct a batch file that will load the file in the designated application WITHOUT having to specify a path / with it retrieving the path from the file itself rather than being specified?</p>

<p>I know this is pretty convoluted and if some clarity is required, let me know.</p>

<p>My original code did the following:</p>

<pre><code>var validAuth = false;
using (var context = new System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext(System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.ContextType.Domain))
{
    validAuth = context.ValidateCredentials(_viewModel.Username, txtPassword.Password);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, during testing it was noticed that this caused account lockouts in half the number of attempts of the AD Group Policy - so say the policy was set to 4 attempts before lockout, the user would be locked out in 2.</p>

<p>I googled and found this article <a href=""https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/e2328cb6-8764-46bf-94eb-4773e2912d74/wrong-lockout-policy-count-when-using-principalcontextvalidatecredentials?forum=netfxbcl"" rel=""nofollow"">on MSDN</a> and the TL;DR is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It sounds that bad password count increase by 2 if you use UPN format (Domain@sAMAccountName), however, the count increase 1 every time if you use sAMAccountName format (Domain\sAMAccountName).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In light of this I changed my code to this:</p>

<pre><code>var validAuth = false;
using (var context = new System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext(System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.ContextType.Domain))
{
    var usernameToAuth = string.Format(""{0}\\{1}"", Environment.UserDomainName, _viewModel.Username);
    validAuth = context.ValidateCredentials(usernameToAuth, txtPassword.Password);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this now fails to authenticate regardless of input. If I change it to use the old style UPN format of user@domain it authenticates fine - but obviously that is using up two authentication requests.</p>

<p>The MSDN post says to use the sAMAccountName format as a work around but I am struggling to work out how to do this. My original code also didn't explicitly use the old UPN format - I just passed the User Name directly to the <code>ValidateCredentials</code> method (no @ symbol anywhere to be seen) so does this method use the old UPN method first?</p>

<p>Any advice please - I don't particularly want to half the bad log on attempts our users can have.</p>

<p>i tried to do ""15-3"". </p>

<p>15 in binary is 1111
3 in binary is  0011</p>

<p>I have added a bit for the sign 0 for + and 1 for -</p>

<p>So now i have: 0 1111 + 1 0011 = 100010 and to this I make a XOR with the sign mask 1 0000. This is where I get stuck.</p>

<p>[Even later edit]</p>

<p>I think I found another way to look at the problem. 
I'll be using 2 shift registers to load the 2 numbers. The output of each shift register will be the input of a NOR gate performing a NOR with 0. (This is to transform 0101 into 1010) Then the 2 outputs of these gates will be connected to the input of the SUM.
My question is how can I transform back from 1 bit to a 8 bit data before entering the SUM ?</p>

On the first scene, if the user taps on it, it will display a UIPopover which contains a UITableView.  The popover and tableview are NOT connected to anything via segues.  This is an image of the layout:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bJMOU.png"" alt=""image showing storyboard scenes""></p>

<p>The Navigation Controller, UITableView and UIView are the three controllers framed in the red box.  The problem is that when I tap on a row in the first UITableView, it does not transfer to the UIView.  I am using only a push segue for the transfer to the next scene.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>  Embedded the UITableViewController in a NavigationController and made the necessary connections: tableViewCell to UIView, (push mode).  Now I'm getting this run-time error (if I change the mode to modal it works but fills the entire window... if I change the mode to popover, it works but now I have two popovers, which looks like a 3 year old wrote it! :-{</p>

<p>I've got several videos in different lengths and I want to extract 20 images out of every video from start to the end, to show the broadest impression of the video.</p>

<p>So one video is 16m 47s long => 1007s in total => I have to make one snapshot of the video every 50 seconds.</p>

<p>So I figured using the -r switch of ffmpeg with the value of 0.019860973 (eq 20/1007) but ffmpeg tells me that the framerate is too small for it...</p>

<p>The only way I figured out to do it would be to write a script which calls ffmpeg with a manipulated -ss switch and using -vframes 1 but this is quite slow and a little bit off for me since ffmpegs numerates the images itself...</p>

<p>Here's a bit of code that uses Core Foundation as it might be written specifically for ARC:</p>

<pre><code>CFTypeRef ref=CFCopySomething();
// At this point ref has retain count 1.
id obj=(__bridge_transfer id)ref;
// Ref still has retain count 1 but is now managed by ARC.
[obj doSomething];
// ARC will release ref when done.

<p>It seems this is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>CFTypeRef ref=CFCopySomething();
// At this point ref has retain count 1.
id obj=(__bridge id)ref;
// Now ref has retain count 2 due to assigning to strong variable under ARC.
CFRelease(ref)
// Now ref has retain count 1.
[obj doSomething];
// ARC will release ref when done.
</code></pre>

<p>The benefit of the latter being that the CFRelease call allows the GC to collect the object. But I'm not sure about calling the CFRelease after transferring to ARC with the bridge-casted assignment.</p>

<p>It certainly seems to work. Is this code OK?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>And then this is how I would implement it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Form elements={[""date""]}&gt;
    &lt;Input ref=""date"" type=""date""&gt;&lt;/Input&gt;
&lt;/Form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The magic happens in the FormContainer <code>isValid</code> method. What I want to do is for each input name thats added to the <code>elements</code> array, to be able to get the reference to it and call it's own <code>isValid</code> method.</p>

<p>However I see that self.refs is empty when I try to call it here if <code>(!self.refs[ref].isValid())</code>. I'm new to React so I'm not quite sure I understand the refs bit, but I thought that any Children of my <code>&lt;Form&gt;</code> that had a ref would be able to be accessed through the <code>&lt;Form&gt;</code> itself. How can I fix this or do it a better way? The point is to gather up all the child elements and check their validity in one place at the <code>Form</code> level.</p>

<p>I'm creating a subject of int, and when i execute OnNext it calls the other subscribers (#1 and #2).
The thing that i don't get is that i read that Subject means an object which is both observable and observer but how does this explains why when i call OnNext the other subscribers are called.</p>

<p>I would understand if OnNext of the subject would propagate it to all subscribers = publish to all others (which make sense) but when I checked the source code i couldn't see anything that does it, see below.</p>

<p>Can someone maybe understand from the code below what exactly makes the OnNext(2) propagate to the other subscriptions? (#1, #2)?</p>

    [Key, Column(Order = 0), DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey(""PhoneNumber"")]
    public int PhoneNumberId { get; set; }
    public virtual PhoneNumber PhoneNumber { get; set; }        
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've setup <code>Contact</code> and <code>Business</code> so that they have one way navigation properties. Also, the phone numbers are optional. I've also setup the many relationship for <code>Contact</code> to prevent EF from adding a <code>Contact_Id</code> column when I add a migration. The mapping is as follows (note <code>WithMany()</code> is used since <code>PhoneNumber</code> doesn't have a nav property back to <code>Contact</code>):</p>

<pre><code>modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Contact&gt;().HasMany(r =&gt; r.PhoneNumbers).WithMany()
            .Map(x =&gt; x.MapLeftKey(""ContactId"").MapRightKey(""PhoneId""));
</code></pre>

<p>When I add a <code>Contact</code> with multiple phone numbers it gets added fine. There are records for the <code>Contact</code>, the <code>PhoneNumbers</code> table, and the <code>ContactPhoneNumbers</code> link table.</p>

<p>However, the issue I'm struggling with is when I delete a contact. EF correctly deletes the entry in the <code>ContactPhoneNumbers</code> link table, and the <code>Contact</code> entry, but it doesn't delete the entries from the <code>PhoneNumbers</code> table. I've seen examples of mapping with <code>modelBuilder</code> where <code>WillCascadeOnDelete(true)</code> is used, but that option isn't available when using <code>WithMany()</code>.</p>

<p>What do I need to do to get that type of cascade delete working correctly? Is it possible with this setup? Or will I need to have a separate <code>PhoneNumbers</code> table for each entity (Contact and Business) to setup a relationship where the respective PhoneNumber table uses a FK (eg., <code>Contact_Id</code>)?</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to EF so any suggestions are welcome. I might be going about this entirely wrong.</p>

<p>EDIT: here's the related migration code...</p>

<pre><code>CreateTable(
    ""dbo.PhoneNumbers"",

<p>This file is declared at the bottom in my master layout page for faster loading.</p>

<p>However I've noticed that some of my functions don't work unless I switch their order in the file. E.g the following order of the two functions prevent the datetimepicker widget from working.</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {

<p>Note the page on which I have my datetimepicker field doesnt have a select2 dropdown list field and the page on which I have a select2 dropdown list doesnt always have a datetimepicker field. I don't want to have a dozen javascript files for each function which is why I've put them all in one file. </p>

It's quite long and I was wondering if there are any ways to optimize it. </p>

<p>The values I need to take to calculate the average are all in the same table SiteReading  so to get the 5 values for the same minute but from different days I join the table's subsets for those days so the hour and the minute would match and then the values end up on the same row. Then I add the 5 values on each row and make a new table out of that and insert it into Baseline table that stores those averages.</p>

<p>Here's the routine:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Because I need to get some additional values (site_id, contract_id, programme) to store in the Baseline that are the same for each row I was wondering that maybe I should do the insert statement in some other way? the thing is that all of the Baseline table's columns can not be null.</p></li>

<p>But the <code>PositionSensorVRDevice</code>'s state values <code>orientation</code> and <code>position</code> are always either <code>null</code> (Firefox) or VRPoint3D/4Ds with x,y,z = 0 (Chrome), so the camera orientation never changes.</p>

<p>The Firefox and Chrome VR builds I've been trying are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://vrhelloworld.com/builds/"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox 2014-10-18 version</a></li>

</ul>

<p>It is getting hold of a PositionSensorVRDevice OK, although it looks like it may not be the real one, because Chrome reports it as:</p>

<ul>
<li>deviceId: debug-0</li>
<li>deviceName: Moculus Rift</li>
<li>hardwareUnitId: debug-0</li>
</ul>

<p>And FF reports it as:</p>

<ul>
<li>deviceId: somedevid</li>
<li>deviceName: HMD Position Device</li>
<li>hardwareUnitId: unknownHMDInfo-0x1351d4000</li>
</ul>

<p>I get the same result with the <a href=""https://github.com/leapmotion-examples/javascript/tree/master/v2/vr-quickstart"" rel=""nofollow"">Leap Motion VR Quickstart demo</a> and the <a href=""http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_effects_vr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Three.js WebGL Effects VR demo</a>. I also get the same with a demo I did a couple of months back which used to work - it doesn't use VRControls, but deals with the PositionSensorVRDevice directly.</p>

<p>Needless to say the Rift is all hooked up and the Demo Scene from the Oculus Rift Config Util is working fine. I'm on Firmware version 2.12.</p>

<p>The relevant code in VRControls is the update method - I've been checking the values of <code>state.orientation</code> and <code>state.position</code> here:</p>

<pre><code>this.update = function () {

    if ( vrInput === undefined ) return;

    var state = vrInput.getState();

    if ( state.orientation !== null ) {
        object.quaternion.copy( state.orientation );
    }

    if ( state.position !== null ) {
        object.position.copy( state.position );
    }

};

With JFace components its possible if you create own equinox fragment to plugin <strong>org.eclipse.jface</strong>, (contains <code>messages.properties</code>), so let me say if I want to make Slovak NLS to <code>JFace</code> components I create <code>messages_sk.properties</code> in my fragment.</p>

<pre><code>Name       Mood
Elmo       Happy
Oscar      null (Happy)
Chris      null (Happy)

Elmo       null (Grouchy)
Oscar      Grouchy
Chris      null (Grouchy)
</code></pre>

<p>If I use this query, it will not return the additional null result rows that I want:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.Name, a.Attribute
FROM People p
LEFT OUTER JOIN Attributes a
ON p.PersonID = a.PersonID AND a.Attribute IN ('Happy','Grouchy')
</code></pre>

<p>I know union would work. Is there any other way to do this ?</p>

<p>According to IE, the 'expected JScript object' refers to <code>hideElements</code>, which is a function that takes any number of HTML objects as arguments and hide them.</p>

<p>Concretely, I retrieve an array of HTML objects via a call to <code>getElementsByTagName</code>, and I would like to pass this array as a list of arguments to the function <code>hideElements</code>. The JS function <code>apply()</code> is exactly what I need in that case.

<li><code>window</code> is not null and of type <code>Window</code>;</li>
<li><code>elements</code> is not null and of type <code>HTMLCollection</code>; and</li>

"15534064","1","15534756","","2013-03-20 20:30:20","","0","40","<p>As of Django 1.5, there's now built-in support for subclassing the User model to add custom functionality, but there are still some considerations of compatibility that mean I'd prefer not to. And prior to 1.5, subclassing was a big hassle. However, there's some functionality I need, specifically in the form of a method, .full_name(). This returns the <code>first + "" "" + middle + "" "" +last</code> name of a User. More generically, it only places spaces where appropriate, and can handle a middle name but doesn't require that the model contain one.</p>

<p>Now, rather than subclass User, I simply have the following at the top of my models.py:</p>

<pre><code>def full_name(self):                                    # Here's a useful full_name method
    '''Return the full name of an object, or else an empty string. Can be applied to objects with first_name, last_name and optionally middle_name fields'''
    fullname = self.first_name
    try:
        self.middle_name
    except AttributeError:                          # this type of object might not have a middle_name field
        pass
    else:                                           # If it has a middle_name field, append it with a conditional space
        if(self.first_name and self.middle_name):
            fullname += "" ""
        fullname += self.middle_name
    if(fullname and self.last_name):                # if fullname has stuff in it now, we'll need a space.
            fullname += "" ""
    fullname += self.last_name
    return fullname
User.full_name = full_name                              # Bless the User model with our full_name function
</code></pre>

<p>I'm relatively new to Python in general, so I was quite pleased to find that this works. I saved a bit of time by using this same function for a couple other models (simply describing full_name = full_name in their class definitions later in models.py). Perhaps now the middle_name functionality makes more sense - other models have middle names.</p>

<p>My question is, is there inherently anything <em>wrong</em> or <em>bad</em> about this practice vs subclassing? Presumably the main disadvantage is that I couldn't add fields to a model this way. But is that it? This method addition appears to persist throughout the rest of the app, and any other module that imports User (specifically, templates work as expected).</p>

<p>Basically, I think this is a quite clever and elegant (though I'm sure not novel) way of solving my problem of needing more functionality, but is it going to come back and bite me later?</p>

<p>Further detail: One reason I ask is that I have some user roles (let's call them Painter, Clerk, and Manager) with <code>models.ForeignKey(User, blank=True)</code> relationships. So for example, User.painter may return a Painter role, but it also may raise an ObjectNotFound exception if the user is not, in fact, a painter. Rather than litter my code with try: except: statements, I'd like to expand my use of the above idea to add, for example, .is_painter() and .is_manager() methods to User so I can simply query those in an if statement instead of making little try:except: messes everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>:<br>
I've found a problem, it was about cross-domain requests. I knew that there are restrictions, but thought they're relaxed for local filesystem and local servers. (and expected more descriptive error message, anyway)<br>

<p>So currently when I click a row a new row is added below but it is the same custom cell as the row clicked (clicking an A cell adds another A cell underneath).</p>

<p>What I want is to insert a new custom cell underneath when the row is clicked (click an A cell and a B cell is inserted underneath).</p>

<p>Is there any way to do this using insertrowatindexpath or is there a better/different way?</p>

<p>Simply I am attempting to use jQuery for tabs. I would like to change the text label for each tab when it is selected. And back to its original form when collapsed or another tab is selected.</p>

<p>I have been able to change the label to a new id, as seen on the <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Pelligea/q4F42/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSFiddle</a> But it actually changes the label to the actual id name.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""tabs""&gt;

&lt;div id=""tab3"" class=""tab-content""&gt;Information 3&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>With this being my current jQuery.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {
    $(function () {
        $(""#tabs"").tabs({
            option: ""selected"",

On the other hand, bunch of system libraries are working (<code>os</code>, <code>datetime</code>, <code>sys</code>, <code>stat</code>, <code>re</code>).</p>

<p>I experienced it on OS X ""brewed"" python, and also on linux and windows (tried only <code>optparse</code>, sorry).</p>

<p>Is it a bug of virtualenv?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> I also tried <code>virtualenv --system-site-packages</code> with the same result.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> If you think it's not bug, tell why? Particularly, why I lose <code>subprocess</code> with <code>-S</code> option and don't lose <code>datetime</code>? What is so special about half of the modules?</p>

<p>The 'getting from the network' bit works fine, and I can dump the retrieved data to a file with no problem, but trying to get Python to actually scan the data one byte at a time is just not working.</p>

<p>Whenever I put code in to try and work things in the 'for byte' loop, I don't get anything much to happen.</p>

<p>When I run the program below, the size of byte.out is usually twice the size of buf.out, which I think is a major symptom pointing to what has gone wrong. If the inner loop were really dealing with the data byte by byte, I would expect both output files to be the same size.</p>

<p>My feeling is that there is something wrong with ""for byte in chr(buf):"" but I really don't know what to put here.</p>

<pre><code>import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)

<p>I have a series of related models (through FK) and I need to filter through them in a complex way.</p>

<p>Suppose I have a model <code>Car</code> that has <code>Parts</code>.  I can get all the parts as <code>car.parts_set</code>.  Each part has a M2M field <code>excluded_price</code> to <code>Price</code>, with <code>related_name='excluded_prices'</code>.</p>

<p>If I create a new part I need to add prices to the part's <code>excluded_price</code> where each price has <code>excluded_parts</code> for every other part related to that car.  I'm trying to create a filter to help me find these prices.</p>

<p>Essentially I want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>parts_set = [part for part in car.parts_set.exclude(pk=new_part.pk)]
Price.objects.filter(excluded_parts__contains=parts_set)
</code></pre>

<p>Effectively I want to find all prices where the <code>excluded_parts</code> is a super set of the specific car parts (excluding the new part, obviously).</p>

<p>I've found a nifty way to do this if the ""parts_set"" were a series of strings.</p>

<pre><code>parts_set = [Q(excluded_parts__contains=part) for part in car.parts_set.exclude(pk=new_part.pk)]
Price.objects.filter(reduce(operator.and_, parts_set))

Every single solution i've found so far pointed to a simple snippet of code
in <code>Module::onBoostrap()</code></p>

<pre><code>$e-&gt;getApplication()-&gt;getServiceManager()-&gt;get('Translator')-&gt;setLocale('some_LOCALE');
</code></pre>

<p>It gives no errors, no warnings, runs smoothly with just one exception, it doesn't affect anything, the line above ( translate helper ) still uses locale defined in module.config.php, I've tried numerous a million approaches, trying to set a locale through different parts of the MVC ( god forbid I've even tried to change it directly in my view using:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;plugin('translate')-&gt;getTranslator()-&gt;setLocale('some_LOCALE')
</code></pre>

<p>So to sum up: translator works properly when locale is set from module config, setting it anywhere else doesn't seem to have any effect whatsoever.</p>

<p>I use the following code in my Rails 4.1.8 application to generate an authorization url to connect with Dropbox:</p>

<pre><code>def dropbox_web_auth()
  DropboxOAuth2Flow.new ENV['DROPBOX_API_KEY'], ENV['DROPBOX_API_SECRET'],
    authorize_account_dropbox_index_url, session, :dropbox_auth_csrf_token
end
</code></pre>

<p>This works. Both on development and production it generates an authorization URL which makes it possible to connect with Dropbox. But after I get redirected to my app I'm getting a <code>DropboxOAuth2Flow::BadStateError</code> error: <code>Missing CSRF token in session.</code></p>

<p>I run a production server behind Cloudflare with Cloudflare's SSL enabled. I first suspected this would be a caching thing because my Evernote Oauth connection also fails (which doesn't give an error whatsoever), but purging the Cloudflare cache and putting the website in Development Mode wouldn't help.</p>

<p>I suspect the error could have something to do with using ReactJS/Ajax. I'm doing an Ajax call from a React Component to a method that checks if the user has authorization. If not, it generates the authorization url:</p>

<pre><code>if current_user.customer.dropbox_access_token
  begin
    dropbox_client().account_info
  rescue
    @authorization_url = dropbox_web_auth().start()
  end
else
  @authorization_url = dropbox_web_auth().start()
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>@authorization_url</code> gets passed back to the React Component which renders the URL. Because this call is handled by an Ajax call, the Ajax call sets the session with CSRF token but the user on the page doesn't yet have access to the just set CSRF token – only on a hard page refresh (but then the Ajax call would generate a new CSRF token which renders the previous useless).</p>

<p>PS: I'm using an Ajax call because this way I can do an Ajax call per API which doesn't bottlenecks my app by having to wait for all API authorization checks to finish.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>-(NSString*)age {
    // notify core data to access value
    [self willAccessValueForKey:@""age""];
    // get primitive value
    NSString* age = [self primitiveValueForKey:@""age""];

    }
    // notify core data done access value
    [self didAccessValueForKey:@""age""];
    return age;
}

-(void)setDateOfBirth:(id)dateOfBirth {
        // change value for key
        [self willChangeValueForKey:@""dateOfBirth""];
        [self willChangeValueForKey:@""age""];
        // set primitive
        [self setPrimitiveValue:dateOfBirth forKey:@""dateOfBirth""];
        [self setPrimitiveValue:nil forKey:@""age""];
        // did change value for key
        [self didChangeValueForKey:@""age""];
        [self didChangeValueForKey:@""dateOfBirth""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see from above code, when I am sync this object and when ""dateOfBirth"" field is updated it try to set ""age"" to ""nil"" and when accessing ""age"" field and if it is ""nil"" then calculate the age and never calculate it again.</p>

<p>However the problem is when I am setting ""age"" field to ""nil"" in ""setDateOfBirth"" setting it never saved and when I am accessing age again ""age"" property still has the previous value but ""dateOfBirth"" is updated.</p>

<p>Any help remotely related to this topic would be very much appreciated, I am having big trouble about this...</p>

<p>EDIT: The logic I got above works perfect in scenario where both setter and getter calls from same context (same thread context), problem only occurs when setter called from completion block of AFNetworking api with private queue and getter called from main thread after merged.</p>

<p>It seems that when I am saving from the context where AFNetworking completion block it only saves the dateOfBirth but not age value which it sets to nil so after merge and when getter calls from the main thread ""age"" has previous value so it never get to calculated again.</p>

Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, k As Integer

'-- here we take keys column from Sheet 1 into a 1D array

'-- here we take to be cleaned-up-range from Sheet 2 into a 2D array
arrData = WorksheetFunction.Transpose(Sheets(2).Range(""A1:I100"").Value)

'-- here we iterate through each key in keys array searching it in

For i = LBound(arrKeys) To UBound(arrKeys)
    For j = LBound(arrData, 2) To UBound(arrData, 2)
            '-- when there's a match we clear up that element
            If UCase(Trim(arrData(1, j))) = UCase(Trim(arrKeys(i))) Then

            End If
    Next j
Next i

'-- replace old data with new data in the sheet 2 :)

UBound(arrData)) = Application.Transpose(arrData)

End Sub

So I tried  to use an online tool (www.freeformatter.com/xsd-generator.html) to generate a valid xsd and got the same error. I don't understand what I'm seeing.</p>

<p>Here's the XML:
</p>

        &lt;/ns1:ServiceResultObject&gt;
    &lt;/BodyMessage&gt;
&lt;/Message&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the XSD I got from the tool:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:schema attributeFormDefault=""unqualified"" elementFormDefault=""qualified"" targetNamespace=""http://www.domain.com/ws"" xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;

          &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:simpleContent&gt;
              &lt;xs:extension base=""xs:string""&gt;
                &lt;xs:attribute type=""xs:string"" name=""value""/&gt;
                &lt;xs:attribute type=""xs:string"" name=""codIsin""/&gt;
              &lt;/xs:extension&gt;
            &lt;/xs:simpleContent&gt;
          &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;/xs:element&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:attribute type=""xs:string"" name=""isin""/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After I generate the classes, I get the error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException: unexpected element (uri:""<a href=""http://www.domain.com/ws/protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domain.com/ws/protocol</a>"", local:""Message""). Expected elements are &lt;{<a href=""http://www.domain.com/ws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domain.com/ws</a>}ServiceResultObject></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do I lose all this header information? Why does the XSD not result in a schema that actually unmarshals the object? The XSD supplied by the service guys here also only defined the inner object.</p>

In the process, I followed the tutorial as explained <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>here</strong></a>. I have a little knowledge on Android, but nothing on integrating Facebook to apps.</p>

<p>I have my Android Workspace in a different path (not the same as my Android SDK), in my Windows computer. I have added the Facebook SDK library to my workspace, and loaded a few sample examples from there - as explained in the above tutorial.</p>

<p>Everytime I try to build and run any of the Facebook samples, I get into the problem <strong>'your project Contains error(s), please fix them before running your application'</strong>.</p>

<p>When I goto my Problems View, I can see 1 error -> <strong>'Error generating final archive : {Workspace-Location}\libs does not exist'</strong>.</p>

<p>I went through a few related questions on this, and I have tried the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean the project &amp; rebuild</li>
<li>Remove Automatic Building, and close eclipse, then restart, then clean, build &amp; run</li>
<li>go to .debug folder(under C:/USER/.android/), remove the debug.keystore, to generate new key</li>
<li>ensure in android properties, the uncheck on 'is library' is obeyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above has not helped me. I am stuck for more than a day, and internet search is not helping me.</p>

<p>I would be happy if someone can help me here. </p>

<p>Hello there,</p>

<p>I followed this article (<a href=""http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/automatic-image-slider-w-css-jquery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/automatic-image-slider-w-css-jquery</a>) to implement slider. The first picture is showing but about 1/4"" above the designated space (therefore taking up space where caption is added with that pic). The 2nd and 3rd pic r fine. The 4th picture doesnt even show up (in firefox it shows up) and the caption is incorrect. The titles are mismatched</p>

<p>How do I fix all of this?</p>

One of the methods I have to call uses a <code>i8</code> (a.k.a. <code>ex:i8</code>) type, i.e. extended big integer. This is supported in Zend (cf. <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.10/Zend_XmlRpc/Value/Zend_XmlRpc_Value_BigInteger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.10/Zend_XmlRpc/Value/Zend_XmlRpc_Value_BigInteger.html</a>).

<pre><code>public class SHandler implements SOAPHandler&lt;SOAPMessageContext&gt;
{

  private static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(SHandler.class);

  @Nullable
  @Override
  public Set&lt;QName&gt; getHeaders()
  {

  {
    log.debug(""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HandleMessage"");

  {
    log.debug(""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Close"");    
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I add the handler to the handler chain during the service initialisation:</p>

<pre><code>@WebServiceClient(name = ""MyService"", targetNamespace = ""http://www.whatever.com/"", wsdlLocation = ""file:/path/to/wsdl"")
public class MyService extends Service
{

    public MyService(URL wsdlLocation) {
        super(...);
        initializeBinding();
    }

    @WebEndpoint(name = ""MyOperation"")
    public MyPort getMyPort() {
        return super.getPort(new QName(""http://www.whatever.com/"", ""MyPort""), MyPort.class);
    }

    private void initializeBinding() {        
        MyPort port = getMyPort();
        BindingProvider bindingProvider = ((BindingProvider) port);
        List handlerChain = bindingProvider.getBinding().getHandlerChain();
        handlerChain.add(new SHandler());
        bindingProvider.getBinding().setHandlerChain(handlerChain);        
    }

    ...

}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this doesn't work at all on the client side. I don't see any logs and my handler is never executed when I send a request and receive a response. </p>

<p>Notice that there is no specific WSDL related to this issue because I work on an MDA platform that generates client/server artifacts from any WSDL. In addition, I cannot do this at configuration level as all is generated, so I can only do it programmatically (I've been googling this and all the solutions that I find are either the one in the original post or using the handler-chain.xml configuration file).</p>

<p>Am I missing something? Is there any other way of doing this?</p>

<p>and the adapter:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;Oggetto&gt;{

    private Context context;
    private Oggetto[] oggetti = null;
    private int layoutid;

<p>right now I'm just trying to catch the click on the checkbox in the list view but the code it's not working as it should and neither the Log or the Toast are showed when i click on any element.</p>

It was a line on my ""styles.xml"".
Something like that:</p>

<p>The curious part is: It wasn't poiting to the right part of the problem.

I came across the following solution <a href=""http://www.fwd.at/tomcat/sharing-session-data-howto.html"">http://www.fwd.at/tomcat/sharing-session-data-howto.html</a></p>

<p>The basic idea of it is that if you have more than one war file, you can set a cookie using the sessionid of the first context that is used. </p>

<p>The cookie can be set using a path that will apply to all contexts/applications. </p>

<p>For example, if i have the following configuration for 3 applicatons</p>

<pre><code>/myapp/app1
/myapp/app2
/myapp/app3
</code></pre>

<p>I can set a cookie as follows</p>

<p>/myapp sessionid. </p>

<p>The sessionid cookie will then be sent to any request with /myapp in the address. This allows the session id to then be used by any of the contexts. </p>

<p>The only problem with this approach is that it was written in 2003 and tested on Tomcat 4. </p>

<p>What are your opinions of this approach? Is there a better way of doing it?</p>

It's very simple: Just fading a user quote out, switching it to another one, and then fading it back in. The problem is that Scriptaculous's fading is a bit flickery. I'm guessing this is because the fade out, switch, fade in, is happing so quickly that the browser is having difficulties keeping up.</p>

<p>At first I thought a pause would work, but now I've read you can use <a href=""http://madrobby.github.com/scriptaculous/effect-queues/"" rel=""nofollow"">Effect Queues</a> to fix this problem, but for the life of me I can't get it to work.</p>

<p>Here's the original problematic code without any Effect Queues:</p>

<pre><code>function fadeOut() {
new Effect.Opacity('quoteContainer', {from: 1.0, to: 0.0 });
}

function fadeIn() {
new Effect.Opacity('quoteContainer', {from: 0.0, to: 1.0 });
}

function changeQuote(i) {
    fadeOut();
    $('quote').innerHTML = quoteArray[i];
    $('name').innerHTML = nameArray[i];
    fadeIn();
}

changeQuote(0); // 1stQuo

window.onload = function () {
    var i = 1;
    var pause = setInterval(function () {
        changeQuote(i);
        i++;
        if (i&gt;11) { i=0; } // Go to first quote in array
    }, 7000);
}

<p>I've got a <code>LinearLayout</code> view that has a <code>TextView</code> at the top, then a <code>ScrollView</code> and below a <code>Button</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout
    android:layout_height=""fill_parent""

            &lt;TableRow

                &lt;TextView

                &lt;TextView

                &lt;TextView
                    android:id=""@+id/c""/&gt;

            &lt;/TableRow&gt;

        &lt;/TableLayout&gt;

    &lt;/ScrollView&gt;

    &lt;Button
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""/&gt;

&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That generated a wholly filled screen with the label at the top border, the button at the bottom border, and a table between it; depending on how many rows this table has, you can scroll it or not.</p>

<p>The contents of the table are generated by Java code, I just added one row as example of what is inserted there.</p>

<p>I now need to make sure a certain row (not necessarily the last one) is visible by scrolling vertically. I can access every element from <code>s</code> to <code>c</code>, but I can't figure out the code to make the <code>ScrollView s</code> scroll at all.</p>

<p>I tried <code>requestChildRectangleOnScreen</code>, <code>scrollBy</code> and, <code>scrollTo</code>, but possibly always with the wrong arguments.</p>

<p>For now I don't care whether <code>TextView a</code> is vertically centered or at the bottom or top border, it would indeed be great if it was visible at all. X-scroll should stay 0, ideally (i. e. leftmost position).</p>

<p>In case this is important: this function is only called when the user enters the screen with a special Intent that's telling the screen to scroll to <code>TableRow</code> x (it's just to show the latest change).</p>

<p>If you need even more information, please ask.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I  have a bit of a problem with an intersection method for 2 rectangles, but I tripped with an issue that it won't allow me advance on this topic.</p>

<p>I'm using 4 objects, 2 points and 2 rectangles. Point1 is the origin of rectangle1 and point2 is the origin for rectangle2.</p>

<p>Then I call the intersect method for rectangle1 and send the rectangle2 object to see if there is an intersection or not.</p>

<p>The problem here, is that inside the method, the origin points of both rectangles wind up being the same coordinate, thus, I will not get good information if I do not have different origins.</p>

<p>Further suppose that you know in advance that there will be a few specific distinctions of <code>Item</code> (they could overlap) that require specific columns. For instance, <code>ToyItem</code> has a special column <code>MinimumAge</code> and <code>CarItem</code> has a special column <code>NumWheels</code>.</p>

<p>I want to handle this in the database as follows: create <code>Item</code> table with a primary key <code>ItemId</code>. Create <code>ToyItem</code> table whose primary key REFERENCES <code>ItemId</code> in <code>Item</code>. Create a <code>CarItem</code> table whose primary key also REFERENCES <code>ItemId</code> in <code>Item</code>.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it reasonable to use a single foreign key as the primary key of the sub-item tables?</li>
<li>Is there another approach to the design that could keep track of all the different types of <code>Item</code>? Right now I have to know in advance what these are.</li>

<p><strong>The main roadblock I have had is authenticating with my SharePoint server.</strong> Many people online have successfully used AJAX calls, however I receive the following error:</p>

<pre><code>XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://&lt;DOMAIN&gt;/_vti_bin/authentication.asmx. The request was redirected to 'http://&lt;DOMAIN&gt;/_layouts/15/error.aspx?ErrorText=Request%20format%20is%20unrecognized%2E', which is disallowed for cross-origin requests that require preflight. 
</code></pre>

<p>The following is my JavaScript code:</p>

<pre><code>function Authenticate() {
    $.support.cors = true;
    $.mobile.allowCrossDomainPages = true;

    $(""#topnavcontent"").append(""Creating SOAP envelope...&lt;/br&gt;"");

<p>I understand the browser is sending a pre-flight OPTIONS call. The SharePoint site by default does not support OPTIONS calls. Is there any workaround for this, such as disabling this OPTIONS call or a setting in the webconfig on the SharePoint site that will allow the pre-flight through. Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

To quickly summarise the gist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Model Managed-Bean: This type of managed-bean participates in the
  ""Model"" concern of the MVC design pattern. When you see the word
  ""model"" -- think DATA. A JSF model-bean should be a POJO that follows
  the JavaBean design pattern with getters/setters encapsulating
  properties.</p></li>
  <li><p>Backing Managed-Bean: This type of managed-bean participates in the
  ""View"" concern of the MVC design pattern. The purpose of a
  backing-bean is to support UI logic, and has a 1::1 relationship with
  a JSF view, or a JSF form in a Facelet composition. Although it
  typically has JavaBean-style properties with associated
  getters/setters, these are properties of the View -- not of the
  underlying application data model. JSF backing-beans may also have JSF
  actionListener and valueChangeListener methods.</p></li>
  <li><p>Controller Managed-Bean: This type of managed-bean participates in
  the ""Controller"" concern of the MVC design pattern. The purpose of a
  controller bean is to execute some kind of business logic and return a
  navigation outcome to the JSF navigation-handler. JSF controller-beans
  typically have JSF action methods (and not actionListener methods).</p></li>
  <li><p>Support Managed-Bean: This type of bean ""supports"" one or more views
  in the ""View"" concern of the MVC design pattern. The typical use case
  is supplying an ArrayList to JSF h:selectOneMenu drop-down
  lists that appear in more than one JSF view. If the data in the
  dropdown lists is particular to the user, then the bean would be kept
  in session scope.</p></li>
  <li><p>Utility Managed-Bean: This type of bean provides some type of
  ""utility"" function to one or more JSF views. A good example of this
  might be a FileUpload bean that can be reused in multiple web
  applications.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This made sense to me and for the past few hours I have been refactoring my code and came up with the following with respect to the user login:</p>

<p>The <code>AuthenticationController</code> is an example of a Controller Managed-Bean. It is request-scoped and features two getters and setters for setting a username and password, and two navigation methods, <code>authenticate</code> and <code>logout</code>, navigating the user to either their private area upon successful login, or back to the main page when logging out.</p>

<p>The <code>UserBean</code> is an example of a Support Managed-Bean. It is session-scoped and features an instance of <code>User</code> class (which would be null when you are not authenticated) with a getter and setter, nothing more.</p>

<p>The <code>AuthenticationController</code> has this user as a managed property (<code>@ManagedProperty(value = ""#{userController.user} private User user;</code>). Upon successful authentication, the <code>AuthenticationController</code> would set the managed property to the actual user instance with the corresponding username that was used for the login.</p>

<p>Any new beans would be able to grab the user as a managed property as well and pull the data they need, such as group membership for instance, if the <code>User</code> class would feature a list with group names.</p>

<p>Would this way be the proper way to go about with regard to the seperation of concerns?</p>

Language: ""English — Development Language"" 
Use Base Internalization checked.</p>

<p>I clicked + button and added ""Turkish"" language. Then it localized, Main.storyboard and LaunchScreen.xib and created corresponding strings file.(Main.stroyboard(Base) and Main.strings(Turkish) LaunchScreen.xib(Base) and LaunchScreen.strings(Turkish))
I also want to of course localize the name of App and strings used in the app. When I was developing the app, I used English so every string user interface etc is in English.  When I create ""Localizable.strings"" and hit Localize button, it tells me where should I move the File, ""Base, English, Turkish"" Here I am puzzled.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I move to Base, and check, English, Turkish and translate just Turkish?</li>
<li>Should I move to English, and check Turkish and translate just Turkish?</li>
<li>Which one of it will allow users to fallback to English or my development base language?</li>
<li>Should I add English localization to Main.storyboard and LaunchScreen.xib?</li>

<p><strong>How do I get the post data in the controller the AJAX calls to?</strong> </p>

<p>The JSON I'm sending has no identification. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: action,
    data: JSON.stringify(data),
    success: function(data){
        alert(data);
    },
    dataType: 'json'
});
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>data</code> is just <code>[{""name"":""variable_name"", ""value"":""12""}]</code></p>

<p>I'm trying:</p>

<pre><code>public function save()
{
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    $json = $this-&gt;input-&gt;post('data');        
    echo $json;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>How do I return something other than JSON?</strong></p>

<p>For example, I was testing this with the following controller:</p>

<pre><code>public function save()
{
    echo ""test"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>All I get when the success function is called is <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Any pointers?</p>

The website allows you to search for bus tickets by selecting country, state, city, date, type of bus and other parameters. I use AJAX POST to send all these criteria to the server side(python). The server side performs a NDB query and returns the available bus operators with details for the selected date. This information is returned as JSON data. After the user clicks on a bus operator, I open a popup on the same page and retrieve and display more details using AJAX POST again in the same way.<br>

<p>So I could show it like this on my site:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1* Reviews: 2</p></li>
<li><p>2* Reviews: 4   </p></li>
<li><p>3* Reviews: 3   </p></li>
<li><p>4* Reviews: 12   </p></li>
<li><p>5* Reviews: 34</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone with decent PHP knowledge will probably be able to figure this out from the code I already used for the average rating, which is below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php global $wpdb;
    $pId = $post-&gt;ID; //if using in another page, use the ID of the post/page you want to show ratings for.
    $row = $wpdb-&gt;get_results(""SELECT COUNT(*) AS `total`,AVG(review_rating) AS `aggregate_rating`,MAX(review_rating) AS `max_rating` FROM wp_wpcreviews WHERE `page_id`= $pId AND `status`=1"");
    $max_rating = $row[0]-&gt;max_rating;
    $aggregate_rating = $row[0]-&gt;aggregate_rating; 
    $total_reviews = $row[0]-&gt;total;
    $totl = $aggregate_rating * 20;
    $wpdb-&gt;flush(); 
?&gt;

&lt;div id=""overall-rating""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""sp_rating"" id=""wpcr_respond_1""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""base""&gt;
            &lt;div style=""width: &lt;?php echo $totl;?&gt;%"" class=""average""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From &lt;?php echo ' ' . $total_reviews;?&gt; reviews&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the ratings from 1 to 5 are stored in a column called ""review_rating"" inside the ""wp_wpcreviews"" table, so is there a way for me to count each rating respectively?</p>

<p>The values in the ""review_rating"" table are just stored as ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", or ""5"".</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any responses, been stuck on this for a while!</p>

<pre><code>if(cond is false)
   pthread_cond_wait
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>while(cond is false)
   pthread_cond_wait
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, we want to cond_wait only because condition is false. Then why should i take the pain of explicitly putting an if/while loop. I can understand that without any if/while check before <code>cond_wait</code> we will directly hit that and it wont return at all. Is the condition check solely for solving this purpose or does it have anyother significance. If it for solving an unnecessary condition wait, then putting a condition check and avoiding the cond_wait is similar to polling?? I am using cond_wait like this.</p>

<pre><code>void* proc_add(void *name){
    struct vars *my_data = (struct vars*)name;
    printf(""In thread Addition and my id = %d\n"",pthread_self());
    while(1){

    while(!my_data-&gt;ipt){  // If no input get in
            pthread_cond_wait(&amp;mutexaddr_add,&amp;mutexattr);  // Wait till signalled
            my_data-&gt;opt = my_data-&gt;a + my_data-&gt;b;
            my_data-&gt;ipt=1;

    if(my_data-&gt;end)
            pthread_exit((void *)0);

<p>The logic is, I am asking the input thread to process the data whenever an input is available and signal the output thread to print it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what else is possible in css. I'm thinking some sort of javascript div height matching is needed. Really, any solution would work for me, even if it's complicated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Activity has leaked ServiceConnection
  com.android.vending.licensing.LicenseChecker@471cc039 that was
  originally bound here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code responsible for this leak in <code>onCreate()</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>mLicenseCheckerCallback = new MyLicenseCheckerCallback();
mChecker.checkAccess(mLicenseCheckerCallback);
</code></pre>

<p>How do I get rid of this leak?</p>

<p>I tried not assigning MyLicenseCheckerCallback to a member, thinking perhaps when the activity goes <code>onPause()</code> the reference to the callback is responsible for the leak:</p>

<pre><code>mChecker.checkAccess(new MyLicenseCheckerCallback());
</code></pre>

<p>But that didn't get rid of the leak.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to @zapl's comment below, I looked at Google's <code>LicenseChecker.java</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/** Unbinds service if necessary and removes reference to it. */
private void cleanupService() {
    if (mService != null) {
        try {
            mContext.unbindService(this);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // Somehow we've already been unbound. This is a non-fatal error.
            Log.e(TAG, ""Unable to unbind from licensing service (already unbound)"");
        }
        mService = null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought that I may be neglecting to call it, but I double-checked and I <em>am</em> calling <code>mChecker.onDestroy();</code> in my activity's <code>onDestroy()</code>.</p>

<p>I also checked <code>onDestroy()</code> in <code>LicenseChecker.java</code> and it <em>is</em> calling <code>unbindService</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Inform the library that the context is about to be destroyed, so that
 * any open connections can be cleaned up.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Failure to call this method can result in a crash under certain
 * circumstances, such as during screen rotation if an Activity requests
 * the license check or when the user exits the application.
 */
public synchronized void onDestroy() {
    cleanupService();
    mHandler.getLooper().quit();
}

That is pretty simple, however, if an user has 8 bronze badges, 7 silver badges and 1 gold badge, he can use his 2 additional silver badges as bronze ones. </p>

<p>This happens everytime the user has available ""higher"" badges to distribute. Again, for example, if he has 8 bronze badges, 4 silver badges and 4 gold badges, he can ""transform"" 2 of his gold badges into bronze and 1 to silver, in order to earn the special badge. </p>

<p><strong>Tried</strong></p>

<p>Because the app is operating in a virtual environment I felt alright with hopping over to <code>page.py</code> and changing the default encoding from <code>ascii</code> to <code>utf-8</code>. </p>

<p>I've tried encoding and decoding and adding <code>charset=utf8&amp;use_unicode=1</code> to my SQLAlchemy URL to no avail.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that the problem lies with the <code>ensure_ascii=False</code> option in the <code>customjson.py</code> file. In fact, the documentation for the Python 2.7 JSON encoder says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if ensure_ascii is False, some chunks written to fp may be unicode instances. This usually happens because the input contains unicode strings or the encoding parameter is used. Unless fp.write() explicitly understands unicode (as in codecs.getwriter()) this is likely to cause an error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Setting <code>ensure_ascii=True</code> seems to work around the error. Given that the default encoding for the json encoder is already <code>utf-8</code> I'm not sure setting it manually will help. I need those unicode characters, so I'm not really sure how to approach the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Update/Solution</strong></p>

<p><em>Problem</em></p>

<p>As described by Biju Kunjummen in his answer. When thread is running it notifies back to the caller and pass self instance. All following calls were executed on this instance directly  bypassing proxy.</p>

<p>public class CabImpl implements ICab { 
       @Override
       public void run() {<br>
          mStationListener.onCabReady(this);
       }
   }</p>

<p><em>Solution</em></p>

<p>Because I have multiple places where I pass the instance of the original object with event, the quick solution was to store reference to the proxy object inside instance and send it. But more correct solution is to use AspectJ, this will illuminate unnecessary code modification and dependencies.</p>

<p>Modifications inside cab object</p>

<pre><code>private ICab mAopProxy;
//...
public void setAopProxy(ICab proxy) {
    mAopProxy = proxy;
}

@Override
public void run() {
    mStationListener.onCabReady(mAopProxy);
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Creation of cab</p>

<pre><code>Advised advised = (Advised)mApplicationContext.getBean(""cab"", num, whileWaiting);
Cab cab = (Cab) advised.getTargetSource().getTarget();
cab.setAopProxy((ICab)advised);

<p>what UploadVideo does is the upload procedure, copy and pasted by YouTube Code Samples. shortly, it creates the credentials and upload the video, like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (var fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open))
            {
                YTfileStream = fileStream;

                await videosInsertRequest.UploadAsync();
            }

  BeanUtils.copyProperties(old, this);

<p>In one project, I have ASP.NET MVC and WebAPI2 running together, the project is also running MVC areas.</p>

<p>Under each area, there is API folder which contains APIs. I'm facing an issue when trying to request the following url:
<strong>{host}/accesscontrol/api/reporting/bookings</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>accesscontrol</strong> here is the area name</li>
<li><strong>reporting</strong> is the controller</li>
<li><strong>bookings</strong> is a literal segment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The error I'm getting:
<strong>No action was found on the controller 'Reporting' that matches the request.</strong></p>

<p>This is the controller that should receive this request:</p>

<pre><code>[RoutePrefix(""accesscontrol/api/reporting"")]
public class ReportingController : ApiController
{
    [Route(""bookings"")]
    [ResponseType(typeof(Booking))]

    {
        //Code to get data
        return Ok(bookings);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I remove <code>[Route('Bookings')]</code> attribute, the request is working well regardless if <strong>Bookings</strong> segment is there or not.</p>

<p>This is the configuration of routing under area registration class:</p>

<pre><code>public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
{
    context.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
        ""AccessControlApi_default"",
        ""accesscontrol/api/{controller}/{id}"",
        new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
        );

    context.MapRoute(
        ""AccessControl_default"",
        ""accesscontrol/{controller}/{action}/{id}"",
        new { action = ""Index"", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I let the app to understand those literal segments under areas?</p>

I have implemented an onListItemClick handler in the activity.  When an item is clicked, I want to replace both fragments with other fragments, and populate a TextView.  However, after replacing the fragments I can't seem to get the View object I need to manipulate the TextView in the new Details fragment -- it returns null.  Here is some relevant code (onListItemSelected is the handler that processes onListItemClick in the main activity). </p>

<pre><code>@Override

    FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fm.beginTransaction();

        {
            bArray [i] = (byte)i;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting IDL/typelib is:  </p>

<pre><code>...
interface ITest : IUnknown {

<p>The goal is to be able to utilize this from a C++ COM client, which works fine using the following:</p>

<pre><code>int iSize = 10;
ITest *test;
byte *buf  = (byte*)CoTaskMemAlloc( iSize * sizeof(byte) );
CoCreateInstance( CLSID_CSTest, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, IID_ITest, (void **) &amp;test );
test-&gt;TestMethod( iSize, buf );
</code></pre>

<p>The buffer is allocated by C++ and passed to C# for population.
All works well and upon the completion of TestMethod() the C++ array (buf) contains correct values set by the C# method.</p>

<p>The question is about efficiency:<br>
Does the Interop wrapper perform array copying during marshaling (""In"" phase) and then back (""Out"" phase) OR does the C# method operate directly on the passed in memory (which may be pinned)?</p>

<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLSessionConfiguration_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/NSURLSessionConfiguration/discretionary"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLSessionConfiguration_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/NSURLSessionConfiguration/discretionary</a></p>

<p>says the following for the <strong>discretionary</strong> property:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When transferring large amounts of data, you are encouraged to set the
  value of this property to YES. Doing so lets the system schedule those
  transfers at times that are more optimal for the device. <strong>For example,
  the system might delay transferring large files until the device is
  plugged in and connected to the network via Wi-Fi.</strong> The default value
  of this property is NO.</p>
  
  <p>The session object applies the value of this property only to
  transfers that your app starts while it is in the foreground. <strong>For
  transfers started while your app is in the background, the system
  always starts transfers at its discretion</strong>—in other words, the system
  assumes this property is YES and ignores any value you specified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to imply that if a download is started in the background the OS always has discretion as to whether and when to proceed with the download. It seems that the OS is always waiting for a wifi connection before completing these tasks. My experience supports this conjecture. I find that I can send several notifications for downloads while device is on cellular. They remain stuck. When I switch the device to wifi they all go through.</p>

<p>WTF? Why Apple prohibits configuring this behaviour, especially since they HAVE the neccessary properties on the NSURLSessionConfiguration object (discretionary, allowsCellularAccess). Of course the user is not always in WiFi when download tasks are started. I need to do this in response of app wake-ups by significant location changes. I schedule download tasks on a background session and never receive delegate callbacks on cellular network until I switch to WiFi. So does that mean I cannot finish these tasks unil WiFi is available again or I bring the app back to foreground? </p>

<p>Has anybody of you a workaround for this?</p>

<p>I already thought of the following:</p>

<p>Starting a long running background task (old style) after a location update and download my stuff there by using a defaultSessionConfiguration. Any experiences if that can work? If this doesn't I will use NSURLConnection I think (even more old style).</p>

<pre><code>//after the new frag enters, clear the selection in this fragment

//set the animation listener
inFrag.setEnterAnimationListener(new Animation.AnimationListener() {

       .add(R.id.upper_container, inFrag)
       .addToBackStack(null)
       .commit();

<p>And BaseFragment has the following structure:</p>

<pre><code>public class BaseFragment extends Fragment {

private WeakReference&lt;Animation.AnimationListener&gt; enterAnimationListener =
        new WeakReference&lt;&gt;(null);

public BaseFragment() {

}

        return super.onCreateAnimation(transit, enter, nextAnim);

    Animation anim = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(getActivity(), nextAnim);
    anim.setAnimationListener(new Animation.AnimationListener() {

        public void onAnimationStart(Animation animation) {
            if (enter) {
                Animation.AnimationListener listener = enterAnimationListener.get();
                if (listener != null) {
                    listener.onAnimationStart(animation);
                }
            }

</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>However, the listener does not get called on the FIRST time the top code is hit (because, unexpectedly, enterAnimationListener.get() == null).  It does, however, get called on all subsequent instances.</p>

<p>This code DOES work on ALL occasions when the `WeakReference' is replaced with a simple 'AnimationListener.'  The question is Why?</p>

<p>It ""looks"" as though this is a multithreaded thing where the object wrapped by the WeakReference is unavailable from other threads right away.

<p>Currently when you run ""node debug"", it spawns a process to listen on port 5858. Then in the parent a connection is attempted to that port. </p>

<p>However if you have another ""node debug"" session running, currently ""node debug"" hangs because that port is in use. </p>

<p>Specifically the message you see is: </p>

<pre><code> $ node debug example/gcd.js 3 5
&lt; debugger listening on port 5858
connecting...
</code></pre>

<p>Better would be for it to detect that the port is in use (without a connecting to it which might mess up another client that is trying to connect that existing debugger). </p>

The animation is execute like I want but at the end of the animation duration the opacity go back to a wrong value.<br>
The purpose of my animation is to show an information message while playing with opacity and after some seconds hide it. It works.<br>
<strong>Actual state:</strong> Hide :: Display :: Hide :: Display<br>
<strong>Objective state:</strong> Hide :: Display :: Hide<br>
However at the end of the animation the <strong>opacity</strong> is <strong>1</strong>.<br>
I show you my stuff:  </p>

<pre><code>.pop_in_information{
  width: 100%;
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 1%;
  height: auto;

  animation-name: close-pop-in;
  animation-duration: 5s;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
  animation-iteration-count: 1;
}

@keyframes close-pop-in {
  0%{ opacity: 0; }
  20%{ opacity: 1; }
  80%{ opacity: 1; }
  100%{ opacity: 0; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see at the <strong>end</strong> of the animation the <strong>opacity</strong> is <strong>0</strong>. In fact it is not.<br>
I use Bootstrap for my HTML.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""pop_in_information""&gt;
   &lt;div class=""row text-center""&gt;
      &lt;div class=""col-sm-2""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

         &lt;div class=""alert alert-success fade in no-margin""&gt;
            &lt;a href=""#"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""alert"" aria-label=""close"" title=""close""&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;div class=""col-sm-2""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Maybe I don't understand the animation in CSS and it's a normal behavior nevertheless I'm not sure of that.<br>
Thanks for the help.  </p>

I have GridLayout item inside QML code. Initially I populate it with QQuickItems (Rectangles containing icons in fact) from C++. This works and renders properly, including sizing, wrap on QML defined columns: property etc.</p>

<p>Now I need based on user interaction (mouse clicks on Rectangles) insert new rectangles in exact positions (in fact just before the clicked Rectangle). I have no problem with MouseEvent propagation, I am even able to pass any ammount of parameters (be it values or pointers to items) into my method to process. I just can not found ""c++ wording"" to make rectangles really rearrange.</p>

<p>I use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>QQuickItem *icon = place(parent);
icon-&gt;stackBefore(insertBefore);
parent-&gt;update();   //(1)
GUI::programWindow-&gt;update(); //(2)
qDebug() &lt;&lt; ""\tCHILDS:"" &lt;&lt; parent-&gt;childItems(); //(3)
</code></pre>

<p><em>parent</em> is pointer to GridLayout item passed from QML code (verified that it points where expected). <em>place(parent)</em> is my method, which loads proper icon based on <em>this</em> object, generates surrounding rectangle and returns pointer to it (i.e. *icon is Rectangle in fact).
<em>insertBefore</em> is pointer to other rectangle inside the same GridLayout (passed through custom signal from my onClick handler). Double checked that it is child of proper GridLayout item.</p>

<p>Now I would expect, that Rectangle, that  firstly got generated as the last of GridLayout children, gets ""lighting fast"" teleported before intended other Rect and GridLayout (knowing, that visual children order changed) will redraw new arrangement to screen. In fact I face to the newly created Rect visible as the last of GridLayout items.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, that output on line (3) shows proper, i.e. <em>reordered</em> order of children. So order of output from the parent->childItems() differs from what can be seen on screen.
The lines commented (1) and(2) were my desperate attempts to make GridLayout to redraw, but no visible change appeared.</p>

<p>Does anybody have some experience with reordering GridLayout children? Is there some other, more proper, method to call instead of stackBefore()? Or am I missing some stupid, immediately visible thing :) ?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any clues.</p>

<p>As you can see if the ResultSet is empty (player does not yet exist in my database) I call registerPlayer. Register player then throws a duplicate entry for primary key error, so I know the table and the row I am looking for exist.</p>

<p>The following code shows the update queries used inside the registerPlayer method.</p>

<pre><code>    if (global){
        query=
                ""INSERT INTO""
                //+ Constants.dbName + "".""
                + "" USERS""
                + "" VALUES ('""
                + UUID + ""', 0)"";

    }else{
        query=
                ""INSERT INTO ""
                //+ Constants.dbName + "".""
                + Constants.serverName
                + ""_USERS ""
                + ""VALUES ('""
                + UUID + ""', 0)"";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Finally for completeness, the queries used for creating the tables</p>

<pre><code>    String userLocalTable=
            ""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "" //+ Constants.dbName + "".""
                    + Constants.serverName +
                    ""_USERS "" +
                    ""(UUID varchar(36) NOT NULL, "" +
                    ""RATING int NOT NULL, "" +
                    ""PRIMARY KEY (UUID))"";
    String userGlobalTable=
            ""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "" + //Constants.dbName + "".""
                    ""USERS "" +
                    ""(UUID varchar(36) NOT NULL, "" +

                    ""PRIMARY KEY (UUID))"";
</code></pre>

<p>Any insight into my issue would be greatly appreciated, as far as I can tell the SELECT queries should not be returning empty ResultSets.</p>

<a href=""http://www.killerphp.com/tutorials/object-oriented-php/php-objects-page-3.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.killerphp.com/tutorials/object-oriented-php/php-objects-page-3.php</a></p>

<p>At first he has you create a setter and getter method in the class:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

class person{
    var $name;      

    function set_name($new_name){
        $this-&gt;name=$new_name;
    }

    function get_name(){
        return $this-&gt;name;
    }
}

php?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then you create the object and echo the results:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
    $stefan = new person();
    $jimmy  = new person();

    $stefan -&gt;set_name(""Stefan Mischook"");
    $jimmy  -&gt;set_name(""Nick Waddles"");

    echo ""The first Object name is: "".$stefan-&gt;get_name();
    echo ""The second Object name is: "".$jimmy-&gt;get_name();

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Works as expected, and I understand.</p>

<p>Then he introduces constructors:</p>

<pre><code>class person{
    var $name;

    function __construct($persons_name) {       
        $this-&gt;name = $persons_name;        
    }       

    function set_name($new_name){
        $this-&gt;name=$new_name;
    }

    function get_name(){
        return $this-&gt;name;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And returns like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 

    $joel   = new person(""Joel"");

    echo ""The third Object name is: "".$joel-&gt;get_name();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is all fine and makes sense.</p>

<p>Then I tried to combine the two and got an error, so I'm curious-is a constructor always taking the place of a ""get"" function?  If you have a constructor, do you always need to include an argument when creating an object?</p>

<p>Gives errors:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
    $stefan = new person();
    $jimmy  = new person();
    $joel   = new person(""Joel Laviolette"");
    $stefan -&gt;set_name(""Stefan Mischook"");
    $jimmy  -&gt;set_name(""Nick Waddles"");

    echo ""The first Object name is: "".$stefan-&gt;get_name();
    echo ""The second Object name is: "".$jimmy-&gt;get_name();
    echo ""The third Object name is: "".$joel-&gt;get_name();

<p>With the ""traditional"" autocompletion, if I type <code>ch</code> and then press the <code>Tab</code> key, I get something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ ch
chacl  chgrp  chmod  chown  chvt

<p>But if I add the following line to my <code>/etc/inputrc</code> (which remaps the Tab key to the built-in <code>menu-complete</code> function):</p>

<pre><code>Tab: menu-complete
</code></pre>

<p>then the behavior of the shell changes: the word to be completed is replaced ""inline"" with a single match from the list of possible completions, and if I press the Tab key again, the word gets replaced with the next match.</p>

<p>I found this useful, but I still wanted to keep the traditional autocompletion and have it bound to the key combination <code>Ctrl + Tab</code>. So I added the following line to my <code>/etc/inputrc</code> file, according to what the <code>readline</code> library documentation suggests:</p>

<pre><code>Ctrl-Tab: complete
</code></pre>

<p>However, adding this line only seems to make both <code>Tab</code> and <code>Ctrl-Tab</code> call the traditional <code>complete</code> function.</p>

<p>Currently, a lot of methods in the code are just surrounded with try/catch block that catches a generic exception and then calls a utility method that just shows the user a messagebox informing him of the error, and then logging it.</p>

<p>So in a lot of cases no corrective action is taken and the exception is just logged. I know this probably isn't the best way but that's they way we're gonna have to do it for the near future.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to do this in a more generic way, so I hooked up Application.ThreadException and AppDomain.UnhandledException.</p>

<p>This seems to work well, except for one inconvenience. Whenever an error gets thrown from the .net runtime itself, or a 3rd party control, the stacktrace begins there where the exception is thrown in the framework-methods or 3rd party methods (obviously!).</p>

<p>But it would be handier if I had an easy way of finding out exactly where these exceptions cross the boundary into my code. I would like an easy way of determining (in Application.ThreadException) where in my own code an exception originated.</p>

<p>I am aware this information is contained in the Exception.StackTrace property, but I would like an easy way to get to this specific information seeing as the stacktrace property is one huge string.</p>

<p>Basically I would like the class, method and line number where the exception first bubbled up into my code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Top navigation bar: 68px tall, full-width, fixed to top.</li>
<li>Bottom navigation bar: 42px tall, full-width, fixed to bottom.</li>
<li>Content: full-height images with various widths, floated to the left.</li>
</ul>

<p>Navigating the content is done by horizontal scrolling only. It's extremely important that the images fill the full height from the bottom of the top nav bar to the top of the bottom nav bar, and are not cropped or obscured in any way. It's also very important that resizing the browser window or rotating a mobile device doesn't break this layout. My current code works perfectly in Chrome and Safari (with one <a href=""http://micho.biz/mac-osx-lion-horizontal-scroll-event/"" rel=""nofollow"">caveat</a>), but fails miserably in Firefox and Opera. I haven't tested in IE yet. Here's what I'm doing:</p>

<pre><code>#header {
  width: 100%;
  height: 68px;
}

#content {
  position: absolute;
  top: 68px;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 42px;
  z-index: -10;
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
  overflow: scroll;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

#content #frame {
  max-width: 80000px; /* (To ensure that there's enough horizontal space for images) */
}

#content #frame img {
  height: 100%;
  width: auto;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 5px;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 100;
}

#footer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 42px;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So what I'm essentially doing is creating a window within a window, and then scrolling within that window, which is what leads to the <a href=""http://micho.biz/mac-osx-lion-horizontal-scroll-event/"" rel=""nofollow"">problem</a> in Safari that I referred to above. Apart from that, this works exactly the way I want in Chrome and Safari. In Firefox and Opera, the images do not scale to the height of the window.</p>

<p>To see the site for yourself, go here: <a href=""http://peter-block.com/preface/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peter-block.com/preface/</a>. The password is ""letitrain"".</p>

<p>What I am thinking is doing away with the ""window within a window"" all together would be best (simple and fixes the Safari problem), but I can't seem to find a solution that works the way I want across all browsers. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The keychain access won't seem to let me import the key.</p>

<p>Is it possible? If so, how?</p>

<p>Their solution:</p>

<p>The sign bit is 0. The characteristic is –3 + 2^7 – 1, represented as an 8-

The client connects, performs some/many  operations (which are updated to a SQL-Database) and closes the application / disconnects from server. We're using Hibernate-JPA and manage the EntityManager-lifecycle on our own, using a ThreadLocal-variable. Actually we create a new EntityManager-instance on every client-request which works fine so far. Recently we profiled a bit and we found out that hibernate performs a SELECT-query to the DB before every UPDATE-statement. That is because our entities are in detached-state and every new EntityManager attaches the entity to the persistence context first. This leads to a massive SQL-overhead when the server is under load (because we have an write-heavy application)and we try to eliminate that leak. </p>

<ul>
<li>First, we thought about 2nd-Level-Cache. However, we discovered that hibernate invalidates it's Query- and Collection-Caches whenever a new item is added or removed. </li>
<li>On second thought, we evaluate whether to keep an EntityManager up as long as the client is logged in on the server. But I wonder if this is a ""best practice"", because there are some drawbacks: thread-safety, managing-overhead of the EntityManager-instances, etc. </li>

I want the best method to print line numbers next to each CRLF-terminated-line in a richtextbox. I am using C# with .NET. I have tried using ListView but it is inefficient when number of lines grow. I have been successful in using Graphics in custom control to print the line numbers and so far I am happy with the performance.</p>

<p>But as the number of lines grow to 50K to 100K the scrolling is affected badly. I have overridden WndProc method and handling all the messages to call the line-number printing only when required. (Overriding OnContentsResized and OnVScroll make redundant calls to the printing method).</p>

<p>Now the line number printing is fine when number of lines is small say upto 10K (with which I am fine as it is rare need to edit a file with 10000 lines) but I want to remove the limitation.</p>

<p>Few Observations</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of lines displayed in the richtexbox is constant +-1. So, the performance difference should be due to large text and not because I am using Graphics painting.</li>
<li>Painting line numbers for large text is slower when compared to small files</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the Pseudo Code</p>

<pre><code>FIRST_LINE_NUMBER = _textBox.GetFirstVisibleLineNumber();
LAST_LINE_NUMBER = _textBox.GetLastVisibleLineNUmber();
for(loop_from_first_to_last_line_number)
{
    Y = _textBox.GetYPositionOfLineNumber(current_line_number);
    graphics_paint_line_number(current_line_number, Y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am using <em>GetCharIndexFromPosition</em> and loop through the RichTextBox.Lines to find the line number in both the functions which get the line numbers. To get Y position I am using <em>GetPositionFromCharIndex</em> to get the <em>Point</em> struct. </p>

<p>All the above RichTextBox methods seem to be of O(n), which eats up the performance. (Correct me if I am wrong.)</p>

<p>I have decided to use a binary-tree to store the line numbers to improve the search perfomance when searching for line number by char index. I have an idea of getting a data-structure which takes O(n) construction time, O(nlgn) worst-case-update, and O(lgn) search.</p>

<p>Is this approach worth the effort?
Is there any other approach to solve the problem? If required I am ready to write the control from scratch, I just want it to be light-weight and fast. </p>

<p>thats what i mean.</p>

<p>we have a small set of extensions that are used in pretty much every script execution and were thinking it would just be wiser to have them inside the mod_php binary rather then  loaded via extension=ext.so @ php.d / php.ini. further more we do use a self-compiled php binary rather then a package (rpm/dpg/etc) based one. so doing this would be fairly trivial.</p>

<ol>
<li>Insert a new note into 'notes' table in DB using AJAX.  </li>
<li>If the the insertion is successful, update the notes table displayed on the page using AJAX.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>$('#form_add_btn').click(function(){

    var form_data = {
        note: $('#note_text').val(),
        type: $('#form_type_select').val(),
    }

    $.ajax({
        url: ""&lt;?php echo base_url();?&gt;admin/add_note"",

        {
            $('#note_msg').html(msg); 
        }
    });

return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment controller method add_note() adds the note via model and returns true or false, which is loaded into view and returned.</p>

<pre><code>public function add_note() {
    $note = $this-&gt;input-&gt;post('note');
    $type = $this-&gt;input-&gt;post('type');

    $data['is_success'] = $this-&gt;model_admin-&gt;add_note($note, $type);
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('admin/add_note', $data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to do another AJAX request if $data['is_success'] is true :</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
        url: ""&lt;?php echo base_url();?&gt;admin/get_notes_table"",
        type: 'POST',
        success: function(table) 
        {
            $('#wrap').html(table);
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>How can I acomplish this ? I tried placing the second request inside and after the first,  but I still need to known if the insertion was successful.</p>

<p>I'm just beginning to learn CI and AJAX in jQuery, would really appreciate your help. Thanks !</p>

<p>I'm building a small site that I'm trying to keep on a single page - in the end the site will live on a USB, so things should be as self-contained (file wise) as possible. Currently I've got a navigation menu (ie- Page 1, Page 2, Page 3) vertically, and when you select an link from the menu new content for that section comes up.  I've got this part down - more or less - thanks to modified Coda-Slider script (See here: <a href=""http://codysilfies.com/orn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codysilfies.com/orn/</a>).  </p>

<p>The part I can't figure out is that in addition to changing the content when clicking a menu item, I would like to also change the backgroun. So Menu_Item_1 will show BGImage1.jpg, Menu_Item_2 - BGImage2.jpg, and so on.  Something pretty much like this: <a href=""http://brewfestgb.com/#!/merriment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brewfestgb.com/#!/merriment</a> - though there are a bunch of additional features on that page...that I can't really figure out how to whittle out. There's got to be a simpler way to do it.</p>

<p>There are a ton of 'click a single link to change an image' tutorials around - but nothing with multiple links.  I also tried using the same slider code for the background - but I can't make the image resize to the size of the browser window AND get the slider to work (it needs a set width apparently - which is workable for the content bit, but not when I want the background to resize with the browser). </p>

<p>Any advice...or leads?  Seems to me someone should know something. Thanks in advance!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>You can find that I use the combination of <code>java.awt.Robot.mousePress(InputEvent.Button1_MASK)</code> and <code>java.awt.Robot.mouseRelease(InputEvent.Button1_MASK)</code> to perform the mouse left click behavior.</p>

<p>It works fine at most time but fails sometimes. For example, the left click behavior for a kind of software's check box will fail. I can make sure I send the click command to <strong>java.awt.Robot</strong> but just nothing happens. What's more incredible is that <strong>java.awt.Robot.mouseMove(int x, int y)</strong> still works in that situation.</p>

<p>PC's OS is Windows8.1</p>

<p>The software is not market available and it's just a Windows native app written by cpp. The button on the software can be clicked but not for check box.</p>

<p>If the situation makes you confused, pls just tell me when will the java.awt.Robot fail to click. Thanks for your help in advance.</p>

"32362033","1","32384537","","2015-09-02 19:59:10","","0","28","<p>I'm trying to implement some websocket stuff in my app. I'm using Spring Boot and Groovy to achieve that. But I have some troubles with websocket messages that are sent but not handled correctly by Spring controller. I tried to search for the same issue but didn't find any useful information.</p>

<p>Currently, to simplify I used the same classes as here: <a href=""https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-messaging-stomp-websocket"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-messaging-stomp-websocket</a></p>

<p>When I run my application, in console I see this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>INFO 3778 --- [           main] s.a.s.SimpAnnotationMethodMessageHandler : Mapped ""{[/hello/**],messageType=[MESSAGE]}"" onto public org.myapp.Greeting org.myapp.GreetingController.greeting(org.myapp.HelloMessage) throws java.lang.Exception</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so it looks good. But in fact, it isn't. My controller code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-groovy prettyprint-override""><code>@Controller
class GreetingController {

@MessageMapping(""/hello/**"")
@SendTo(""/topic/greetings"")
Greeting greeting(HelloMessage message) throws Exception {
  return new Greeting(""Hello, "" + message.getName() + ""!"")
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>and my websocket configuration is:</p>

<pre class=""lang-groovy prettyprint-override""><code>@Configuration
@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
class WebSocketConfig extends AbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {

  @Override
  void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry config) {
    config.enableSimpleBroker(""/topic"")
    config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes(""/app"")
  }

  @Override
  void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {
    registry.addEndpoint(""/hello"").withSockJS()
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I can connect to above websocket but sending any messages doesn't give any effects. I'm doing it with the following javascript code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var stompClient = null;
var socket = new SockJS('/hello');

stompClient = Stomp.over(socket);
stompClient.connect({}, function (frame) {
  console.log('Connected: ' + frame);
  stompClient.subscribe('/topic/greetings', function (greeting) {
    console.log('received message');
    console.log(greeting);
  });
  stompClient.send(""app/hello"", {}, JSON.stringify({'name': 'my name'}));
});
</code></pre>

<p>It sends messages but there is no reply. I added printing messages in controller method and it doesn't print anything so sent greeting message isn't passed to the controller method, it isn't even invoked. I tried even  setting mapping to handle all messages <code>@MessageMapping('/**')</code> but it didn't work.</p>

<p>This is Spring log (debug level) after invoking above javascript code:</p>

So, obviously some form of multi-threading is going to be needed to keep the form responsive. But, we also have the requirement that the form updates as many times per second while still remaining responsive.</p>

<p>Here is a simple test example using background worker thread:</p>

<pre><code>void bw_ProgressChanged(object sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        int reportValue = (int)e.UserState;
        label1.Text = reportValue;
        //We can put this.Refresh() here to force repaint which gives us high repaints but we lose
        //all other responsiveness with the control

    }

    void bw_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
    {
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; 100000; x++)
            {     
              //We could put Thread.Sleep here but we won't get highest performance updates
                bw.ReportProgress(0, x);                    
            }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Please see the comments in the code. Also, please don't question why I want this. The question is simple, how do we achieve the highest fidelity (most repaints) in updating the form while maintaining responsiveness? Forcing the repaint does give us updates but we don't process windows messages. </p>

<p>I have also try placing DoEvents but that produces stack overflow. What I need is some way to say, ""process any windows messages if you haven't lately"". I can see also that maybe a slightly different pattern is needed to achieve this.</p>

<p>It seems we need to handle a few issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Updating the Form through the non UI thread. There are quite a few solution to this problem such as invoke, synchronization context, background worker pattern.</li>
<li>The second problem is flooding the Form with too many updates which blocks the message processing and this is the issue around which my question really concerns. In most examples, this is handles trivially by slowing down the requests with an arbitrary wait or only updating every X%. Neither of these solutions are approriate for real-world applications nor do they meet the maximum update while responsive criteria.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of my initial ideas on how to handle this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Queue the items in the background worker and then dispatch them in a UI thread. This will ensure every item is painted but will result in lag which we don't want.</li>
<li>Perhaps use TPL</li>
<li>Perhaps use a timer in the UI thread to specify a refresh value. In this way, we can grab the data at the fastest rate that we can process. It will require accessing/sharing data across threads.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Update, I've updated to use a Timer to read a shared variable with the Background worker thread updates. Now for some reason, this method produces a good form response and also allows the background worker to update about 1,000x as fast. But, interestingly it only 1 millisecond accurate. </p>

<p>So we should be able to change the pattern to read the current time and call the updates from the bw thread without the need for the timer.</p>

<p>Here is the new pattern:</p>

<pre><code>//Timer setup
{
            RefreshTimer.SynchronizingObject = this;
            RefreshTimer.Elapsed += RefreshTimer_Elapsed;
            RefreshTimer.AutoReset = true;
            RefreshTimer.Start();
}           

     void bw_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
            {
                    for (int x = 0; x &lt; 1000000000; x++)
                    {                    
                       //bw.ReportProgress(0, x);                    
                       //mUiContext.Post(UpdateLabel, x);
                        SharedX = x;
                    }
            }

        void RefreshTimer_Elapsed(object sender, System.Timers.ElapsedEventArgs e)
        {
            label1.Text = SharedX.ToString();
        }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong> And here we have the new solution that doesn't require the timer and doesn't block the thread! We achieve a high performance in calculations and fidelity on the updates with this pattern. Unfortunately, ticks TickCount is only 1 MS accurate, however we can run a batch of X updates per MS to get faster then 1 MS timing.</p>

<pre><code>   void bw_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
    {
            long lastTickCount = Environment.TickCount;                
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; 1000000000; x++)
            {
                if (Environment.TickCount - lastTickCount &gt; 1)
                {
                    bw.ReportProgress(0, x);
                    lastTickCount = Environment.TickCount;
                }

<p>Thought I'd follow up a bit more and add the info here (as opposed to adding more comments below).</p>

<p>After installing Galileo and finding it went well and no android problems, I installed Helios.  It too went well and no Android problems (yet).</p>

<p>I did add the necessary lines to the eclipse config ini file to increase Memory size and added Garbage Collection. When I did this to Gannymede, it made a significant speed improvement but, I don't see any effect in either Galileo or Helios.  Makes me think that since they are not natively added for these two versions (at least not for 64-bit Cocoa / Mac), they may not be used. Nonetheless, they seem to have no negative affect. If anyone has knowledge to share on this, I'm all ears...</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'd like to get opinions on updating Eclipse for Android development.</p>

<p>I currently use Eclipse (Ganymede) 3.4.2. on a Mac (duo core intel)</p>

<p>I've read many posts regarding this and, while there are differing opinions, probably mostly with regard to the interface. I have read about issues with the Android SDK and ADT with Eclipse versions above 3.4.2. but, thus far, all posts seem to be prior to the Android Dev site recommending the following (they previously recommend not using above 3.4):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) or greater</li>
  <li>Eclipse JDT plugin (included in most Eclipse IDE packages)</li>
  <li><p>If you need to install or update Eclipse, you can download it from
  <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Several types of Eclipse packages
  are available for each platform. For
  developing Android applications, we
  recommend that you install one of
  these packages:
    o Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
    o Eclipse Classic (versions 3.5.1 and higher)
    o Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there an advantage in switching from 3.4.2 Ganymede to Classic 3.5.1?</li>
<li>Is it worth the trouble?</li>
<li>Is anyone having compatibility issues with Android and the ADT? using 3.5.1?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks - any input/recommendations are appreciated...</p>

<pre><code>public Task PostAsync(int id)
{
    return Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; 
    {
        // CloudBlob.UploadFromStream(stream);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does this code even make sense? I think ASP.NET is already processing the request in a worker thread, so running UploadFromStream in another thread doesn't seem to make sense since it now uses two threads to run this method (I assume the original worker thread is waiting for this UploadFromStream to finish?)</p>

<p>So my understanding is that async ApiController only makes sense if we are using some built-in async methods such as HttpClient.GetAsync or SqlCommand.ExecuteReaderAsync. Those methods probably use I/O Completion Ports internally so it can free up the thread while doing the actual work. So I should change the code to this?</p>

<pre><code>public Task PostAsync(int id)
{
    // only to show it's using the proper async version of the method.
    return TaskFactory.FromAsync(BeginUploadFromStream, EndUploadFromStream...)
}
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, if all the work in the Post method is CPU/memory intensive, then the async version PostAsync will not help throughput of requests. It might be better to just use the regular ""public void Post(int id)"" method, right?</p>

<p>I know it's a lot questions. Hopefully it will clarify my understanding of async usage in the ASP.NET MVC. Thanks.</p>

<p>After surfing through the TestNG code I understood that I can't achieve that using <code>IHookable</code> or other listeners.

<p>This is probably a basic question, and might have already been asked (say, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/2494471/459391"">here</a>); yet I still don't understand it. So, let me ask it.</p>

<p>Consider the following C++ class:</p>

<pre><code>class Obj{
    char* str;
public:
    Obj(char* s){
        str = s;
        cout &lt;&lt; str;
    }
    ~Obj(){
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Done!\n"";
        delete str;        // See the comment of ""Loki Astari"" below on why this line of code is bad practice
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>what's the difference between the following code snippets:</p>

<pre><code>Obj o1 (""Hi\n"");
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>Obj* o2 = new Obj(""Hi\n"");
</code></pre>

<p>Why the former calls the destructor, but the latter doesn't (without explicit call to <code>destroy</code>)?</p>

<p>Which one is preferred?</p>

I'm assuming that some sort of insertion sort would be best, but what is the best way to accomplish that (if it is even the best way)?</p>

<p>The constraints are that you definitely see each object, one at a time (and I definitely <em>cannot</em> put the entire set into memory).</p>

<p>I was thinking of two possible solutions:</p>

<p>1) A simple linked list.  So as the first 100 objects come in they will be sorted (takes O(n) time--but n = 100).  Then as each successive object comes in, it will be inserted correctly (again O(n), n = 100, time), and if inserted, it will kick out the tail (otherwise the linked list will be unchanged if it's above the maximum value).</p>

<p>2) Use a heap.  I figure I can keep a heap, insert into the heap, then discard the root node (the top of the heap) if the size of the heap is above my maximum number of elements (100 in my case).  This should mean O(lg(n)) runtime, right?  Since both the insertion of an element and deletion of the root is O(lg(n)), right?</p>

<p>Are there any good libraries for a heap in Java?  I really don't want to have to code my own heap structure.</p>

<p>p.s.  </p>

<p>If you're wondering why I'm doing this, it's for fantasy football purposes.  I have a program which finds the maximum projected points of a set of players under the constraint of a salaray cap (it's a brute force algorithm).  In fact that's another question entirely, which is how to solve a knapsack problem where you <em>must</em> have a set number of different types of items (i.e. 1 QB, 3 WRs, 2 RBs, 1 TE, 1 K, and 1 Defense).</p>

<p>So I have a large set (1,234) of teams which give a minimum projected amount of points, but now I'm trying to find groups of teams which have a wide range of different players.  I figure that a group of three teams is reasonable to solve (via brute force): 1,234 choose 3 = 312,419,184 (which, by my calculations will take about an hour and a half to process).  I calculate a group of teams' variance as the number of a times a player appears in each team (so the lower the value, the higher the group of teams' variance).</p>

You can view your stats, view your inventory, view item stats, and discard items. However, after the item is discarded, which ever slot the discarded item was in remains empty, and in a game it doesn't make sense to have object 2 be discarded, and then what was object number 3 remain object 3. Object 3 should become 2. So I was wondering how I could do this with my current code.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

bool running = 1;

void titleFunc();
void newGameFunc();
void menuFuncNav();
void menuFuncInfo();
void menuFuncItems();

short playerItemCount = 0;
int userInput = 0;
int talkInput = 0;
int playerInfo[3];
int playerLocation = 0;
const int MAX_ITEMS = 100;
int playerItems[MAX_ITEMS][11];




void menuFuncItems()
{
    int i = 0;
    for( int i = 0; i &lt; playerItemCount; i++ )
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; i+1 &lt;&lt; "": ""; 
        cout &lt;&lt; itemNames[playerItems[i][0]]; 
        cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    cin &gt;&gt; i;
    if( playerItems[i - 1][1] == 1 )
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Press 1 to view stats."" &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Press 2 to equip."" &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Press 3 to discard."" &lt;&lt; endl;
        cin &gt;&gt; userInput;
        cout &lt;&lt; endl;

        if( userInput == 1 )
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; ""Name: "" &lt;&lt; itemNames[playerItems[i - 1][0]] &lt;&lt; endl;
            cout &lt;&lt; ""Physical Attack:"" &lt;&lt; playerItems[i - 1][2] &lt;&lt; endl;
        }

        }

            cout &lt;&lt; ""Item discarded."" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    }

<p>So in this code, the player discards the item in the first inventory slot.</p>

<ol>
<li>Iron Longsword</li>
<li>Wooden shield</li>
<li>Hard Leather Chest-Piece</li>
<li>Hard Leather Leggings</li>
</ol>

<p>Should become, after item 1 is discarded:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wooden Shield</li>
<li>Hard Leather Chest-Piece</li>
<li>Hard Leather Leggings</li>
</ol>

<li>The problem has to begin from an unassigned or unoptimal state</li>
<li>So then, the problem facts and planning entities, which are POJOs, have to be instantiated</li>
<li>The solution class, such as CloudBalance or NQueens have to be aware of the problem facts and planning entities</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: In the examples, where are the objects of the planning entity and problem fact classes <strong>initialized</strong>?</p>

MSDN states that the decryption key and validation key is based on web application id. I am hosting two ASP.NET MVC 2 sites on my IIS 7 server but found out that the machine key are the same. I verified this by using reflection to see the ValidationKeyInternal and DecryptionKeyInternal property. I also tested it by generating an anti forgery token cookie on one site and pass it to the other and the cookie can be read.</p>

<p>After trial and error, I found the key will change if the application pool identity changes. The two sites have the same keys because they are running under network service credential. Once I change the application pool identity of one site, they begin to have different validation/encryption keys.</p>

<p>However, after I deploy the two sites to another server, I always get the same machine keys even after changing application pool identity. The two servers have the same hardware and software configuration.</p>

<p>I would like to know if there is reference for the actual logic of how the machine key is generated under AutoGenerate,IsolateApps setting. On the web, there are a lot of articles talking about setting the same machine key in a web farm scenario. But I encountered a problem on the opposite side. The per web application auto key generation does not seem to work properly. Is there anyone who has the same problem before?</p>

In the <code>UIViewController</code> I have implemented the following methods:</p>

- (NSInteger)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView numberOfItemsInSection:(NSInteger)section
- (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

<p>In addition to the above the storyboard includes a <code>UICollectionViewCell</code> that is defined in a separate class. This is all working perfectly and the CollectionView is displaying data as expected.</p>

<p>But... I want a create a separate class that implements <code>UICollectionViewDataSource</code>, <code>UICollectionViewDelegate</code> methods and I've cut and pasted the methods from above that were in the <code>UIViewController</code> class into a separate datasource class. I'm then setting the UICollectionViews delegate and datasource to point to the new class. This results in the following exception :</p>

<pre><code>Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'UICollectionView must be initialized with a non-nil layout parameter'

<p>I have tried adding the new class as an <code>NSObject</code> in the storyboard and connecting the collection view, and also programmatically in the ViewDidLoad method in the ViewController same exception with both.

<p>Am I missing something, googling suggests that the collection view initWithCollectionViewLayout is required but how is this achieved when the CollectionView is being initialized in the StoryBoard and why does it work when it's methods are in the ViewController class?</p>

"31497255","1","","","2015-07-19 01:51:37","","-1","39","<p>I am implementing a basic heightmap with simple shading (ambient + diffuse). The shading is implemented on the fragment shader, which is shown below.</p>

<pre><code>#version 330

in  vec3 fragNormal;
out vec4 outColor;

uniform vec3 lightDirection;
uniform vec3 lightColor;
uniform vec3 objectColor;

void main()
{
    float ambientStrength = 0.1f;
    vec3 ambientColor = ambientStrength * lightColor;

    vec3 norm = normalize(fragNormal);
    float diff = max(dot(norm, -normalize(lightDirection)), 0.0f);
    vec3 diffuseColor = diff * lightColor;

    outColor = vec4((ambientColor + diffuseColor) * objectColor, 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I do is to calculate a simple diffuse component based on the normal  fragNormal. This variable is passed directly from the vertex shader.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of what I currently have:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zZZFU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is this the expected result from a heightmap with pixel shading?
I am a little bit annoyed by the fact that the surface is not really smooth. </p>

<p>But if that is expected, is the any technique that improves what I currently have?</p>

<p>To calculate the normals, I used the following algorithm:

DEST[VLMAX-1:128] ← 0
</code></pre>

<p>im trying to implement the 128 version of this opcode with no success.
Here are the values before and after the function</p>

<p><strong><em>Before</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>WINDBG&gt;r xmm2
xmm2=           0 3.78351e-044 6.09194e+027 6.09194e+027
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>After</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>WINDBG&gt;r xmm2
xmm2=9.68577e-042            0 4.92279e-029 4.92279e-029
</code></pre>

<p>in python you can use 'struct' to change those from float numbers to Hex:</p>

<pre><code>hex(struct.unpack('&lt;I', struct.pack('&lt;f', f))[0])
</code></pre>

<p>So i can sort of say those are the hex values of <em>XMM2</em> before and after the <em>PSHUFB</em> opcode:</p>

<p><strong><em>Before</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>xmm2 = 0 0x0000001b 0x6d9d7914 0x6d9d7914
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>After</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>xmm2 = 00001b00 00000000 10799d78 10799d78
</code></pre>

<p>And most importantly, i almost forgot.. the value of <strong><em>XMMWORD_ADDRESS</em></strong> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>03 02 01 00 07 06 05 04 0D 0C 0B 0A 09 08 80 80 </p>
  
  <p>xmmword 808008090A0B0C0D0405060700010203h</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implementation in Python could be highly appreciated.
Implementation in C could work as well</p>

<p>or maybe some explanation of how the hell it works!
Because i couldnt understand the intel reference</p>

<p>This is the code algorithm i have so far</p>

<pre><code>x = ['00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '1b', '6d', '9d', '79', '14', '6d', '9d', '79', '14']
s = ['03', '02', '01', '00', '07', '06', '05', '04', '0D', '0C', '0B', '0A', '09', '08', '80', '80']
new = []
for i in range(16):
    if 0x80 == int(s[i], 16) &amp; 0x80:
        print ""MSB"", s[i]
        new.append(0)
    else:
        print ""NOT MSB"", s[i]
        new.append( x[int(s[i], 16) &amp; 15] )

print x
print new
</code></pre>

<p>Where x is the xmm0, and s is the SRC.</p>

<p>the output i get is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>['00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '1b', '6d', '9d', '79',
  '14', '6d', '9d', '79', '14']</p>
  
  <p>['00', '00', '00', '00', '1b', '00', '00', '00', '9d', '6d', '14',
  '79', '9d', '6d', '00', '00']</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where i should get</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>['00', '00', '1b', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '10', '79', '9d',
  '78', '10', '79', '9d', '78']</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something else i have noticed right now, in the 'output' i get the hexadecimal number 0x78
Where could it come from?</p>

<p>And, like the poster linked above, the hash of the password is the same, and the first 8 bytes of the encrypted byte array are the same.  I've got the initialization vector set to 8 bytes of zero, but I figure if the first 8 bytes of the encrypted data are the same, then the initialization vector must match.  I just can't figure out why the next 8 bytes differ.  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong here?</p>

I'm really trying to make this an answerable question, and not a discussion topic, but now I'm thinking about 'web design' - and I don't want to have to learn css and all that, because I want to speand my time programming and not designing. So what I'd like is a utility where I can visually design, say a menu bar, and just paste the code into my application where I can work with it. Or I want to format text visually, and paste the css file into my application. I guess what I want to easily design a layout with forms, images and graphics, and have them show up with my dynamic tables. So my question is - is it a good option to go with a big design program like Dreamweaver for this, or is there an easier way? I'm not really even a programmer (can you tell?), and I'm figuring this out as I go. As an aside, I'm pretty pleased with what I've got so far - I think the functions and modules are pretty useful, and the end product (however I get there) will be great. Apologies for the rambling question, and any advice is really appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>""The member ""ChordFrom"" is not recognized or is not accessible.""
""The member ""ChordTo"" is not recognized or is not accessible.""</strong></p>

<li><p>If I close all XAML windows, rebuild the project, the errors

<li><p>Even if can build the project without any errors, the properties are
not set.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ANSWER | ANSWER | ANSWER | ANSWER | ANSWER | ANSWER | ANSWER</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for all the answers, but the solution/error was inside my code. I forgot to update my grid after setting these two CLR properties. Sorry for this.</p>

<p><strong>But here some facts you may want to know:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You can use and set plain CLR properties inside WPF XAML. I checked it out and the properties are set from XAML</li>
<li>The error ""not recognized or is not accessible"" seems to be a VS bug, because the project is buildable</li>
<li>If you close the XAML files inside VS there will be no build errors anymore</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, using plain CLR properties is the best solution at this point, because the values I pass to the control are hardcoded for every instance of the control and they do not change at runtime. Of course I would want to use attached DPs, if the values changed at runtime, which they don't.</p>

<p>Thank for your quick answers, but it in the end it was a my fault.</p>

<p>When I call the <strong>StateBo.findByCountry</strong> the result is mapped to <strong>StateBo</strong>, but if I call <strong>StateBo.showIdfindByCountry</strong> the result is not mapped to <strong>StateBo</strong> because I'm only selected on the query the <em>state.id</em> instead of the fields on the table.</p>

<p>I don't want to select all the fields of the <strong>STATE</strong> table, I only want in this case the <strong>state.id</strong>, but when I customize my native query, the result is not mapped to <strong>StateBo</strong> instead of this, the result is a Long type.</p>

<p>My question is, Is possible map to an Entity the result of <strong>StateBo.showIdfindByCountry</strong>? I case that I have more fields like state.isoCode, is possible map to StateBo, the custom query? or only is possible if I return all the fields from the query, like the first query <strong>StateBo.findByCountry</strong></p>

<p>This filter returns shoulds for all of them. I get all products where the colour is white, black or blue, or where the size is M or L.</p>

<p>Summing it up how it should be:</p>

<p>in a single attribute it's all ORs and it expands the search, but when another attribute is selected, it becomes an AND between those attributes, but still ORs within them.</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;ListHelper&gt; HelperEnumerable = null
HelperEnumerable = _repository.Persons
         .Where(b =&gt; b.Age &lt; 18)
             .GroupBy(
                     n =&gt; n.FirstName

                     );
</code></pre>

<p>When I ToList() the HelperEnumerable the result is like:
Name: ""Michael"", Amount: 100,
Name: ""Eva"", Amount: 122,
Name: ""Lisa"", Amount: 71,
etc</p>

<p>How can i get a similar result but with count of all persons matching the criteria with a result like this:
Name: ""All"", Amount: 17280</p>

<p>I would like to have the key value pair so all the rest of the code could stay the same, only this query would return the count of all matchig rows instead of grouped by any particular columm.</p>

<p>I've tried this which returns only the int count:</p>

<pre><code>HelperEnumerable = _repository.Persons
             .Where(b =&gt; b.Age &lt; 18).Count();
</code></pre>

<p>And I can't add a </p>

<pre><code>.Select(a =&gt; (key,count) new ListHelper{ key = ""All"", count = a })
</code></pre>

<p>after a Count() to try to project the result to have two fields.</p>

"29885862","1","","","2015-04-27 01:44:21","","1","21","<p>I'm making an event handler that takes a couple functions, and uses them to handle events (specifically keyboard and mouse). I'm using <code>GetCursorPosition</code> to get the current mouse position on a mouse click event, but it's consistently returning 0 and 0 for the coordinates; even though I'm checking to make sure the call was successful (via the return value).</p>

<p>As far as I can tell through searching, <code>GetCursorPosition</code> doesn't require any kind of initialization. I'm venturing into (personally) unknown territory, so I'd like a little assistance.</p>

<p>The function in question:</p>

<pre><code>void EventHandler::actOnPressedKeys() {
    for (char key : keysToCheck) {
        if ( GetAsyncKeyState(key) ) {
            keyHandler(key);
        }
    }

    for (char button : mButtonsToCheck) {
        if ( GetAsyncKeyState(button) ) {
            POINT p;
            if ( !GetCursorPos(&amp;p) ) {
                throw std::runtime_error::runtime_error(
                    ""Cannot get cursor position: "" + GetLastError()
                );
            }
            mouseHandler(button, p.x, p.y);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is called inside a loop on a separate thread.</p>

<p>I know the mouse press is detected, because the position changes from <code>(0,0)</code> to <code>(1,1)</code> immediately after clicking. For whatever reason though, it won't report the correct position.</p>

    function rNWSRADAR() {

}

<p>So the first one opens the frame and the second one closes it. I call the function with a hyperlink like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href='javascript:NWSRADAR()'&gt;NWS Radar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href='javascript:rNWSRADAR()'&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is all good, but I have about 30 links I need to turn into clickable buttons and would like to know how to have one generic open and shut function that uses variables for the webpages instead of having 30 separate functions with fixed iframe sources and names.</p>

<p>It seems that it statically precalculates the <code>fib(40)</code> and stores it somewhere. Right? The strange lag at the beginning (0.8 secs) is probably because it loads that cache?</p>

<p>I'm doing this for benchmarking. The C compiler should optimize <code>fib()</code> itself as much as it can. However, I don't want it to precalculate it already at compile time. So basically I want all code optimized as heavily as possible, but not <code>main()</code> (or at least not this specific optimization). Can I do that somehow?</p>

<p>What optimization is it anyway in this specific case? It's somehow strange and quite nice.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>var Object1 = function (param) {
    this.prop1 = ""p1 "" + param;
    this.prop2 = ""p2 "" + param;
};

var Object2 = function (param) {
    Object1.apply(this, arguments);
    this.prop3 = 'p3' + param;
};

Object2.prototype = new Object1();

var b = new Object2('this is Object 2');

for (var v in b)
    print(v + "": "" + b[v] + (b.hasOwnProperty(v)?' (own)':' (inherited)'));
</code></pre>

<p>This code prints:</p>

<pre><code>--prop1: p1 this is Object 2 (own)
--prop2: p2 this is Object 2 (own)
--prop3: p3this is Object 2 (own)
</code></pre>

<p>If I take a look on the debugger I see:</p>

<pre><code>b
  Object2
    prop1: ""p1 this is Object 2""
    prop2: ""p2 this is Object 2""
    prop3: ""p3this is Object 2""
    __proto__: Object1
</code></pre>

<p>But, id I remove the <code>apply</code> line, all makes more sense, but base object it is not initialized:</p>

<pre><code>--prop3: p3this is Object 2 (own)
--prop1: p1 undefined (inherited)
--prop2: p2 undefined (inherited)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I see in the debugger:</p>

<pre><code>b
  Object2
    prop3: ""p3this is Object 2""
    __proto__: Object1
      prop1: ""p1 undefined""
      prop2: ""p2 undefined""
      __proto__: Object
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know, <code>apply</code> it's like ... execute the super class constructor, so super members are initialized correctly, but apparently that changes the shape of the child object.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? What is the correct way -or at least the less messy- to inherit in JS?</p>

<p>I am taking a look to some information about it, and apparently each developer has different feelings about how to do it.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>

This populate a gridview based on the results and the user is able to perform various actions on the records. The gridview supports paging</p>

<p>It works well unless the user changes any of the search fields without actually clicking the search button, and then clicking to a new page.</p>

<p>This is occuring because I am handling my paging kind of like this</p>

<pre><code>protected void gridview1t_PageIndexChanging(object sender, GridViewPageEventArgs e) 
{

    gridview1.DataSource = GetMyData();
    gridview1.DataBind();
}

<p>GetMyData() take values that the user entered and passes them to a stored procedure which returns a recordset. So if the search parameters are not the same when a new page is selected, the procedure will return a different set of records than was originally returned. This looks odd from the end user point of view.</p>

<p>I could store my datatable in the session but that doesn't seem like the best solution. Likewise I could stored the parameters from my initial search but that also seems like it might get sloppy. Is there a nice clean way to accomplish this?</p>

Since Android have most of the useful functionality in Java, I have no other idea to get ANDROID_ID than to use Java then. I have set up proof of concept code to do that in native and it works. But for that I have the instance jobject and of course JNIEnv. I want to somehow set it up so that I do not need to pass any java instance to my native code. That means that I somehow need to create/get the Context object. And after that I can get ContentResolver to get the ANDROID_ID. Since ANDROID_ID is constant and ContentResolver seems to be also same for all the activities I think there must be some way. I also think that Context is the same for all, but I do not have knowledge to be sure. Since I can do native code, but I do not know much Android App infrastructure, then can anyone suggest any solutions.</p>

<p>My thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create some pseudoActivity in native code and kill it momentarily after getting the id. </p></li>

If one user can't make that appointment/event ""because he/she are running behind on other appointment"" I need to be able to re-assign this appointment to a different available user. So I need to display a suggestion of the top 5 users that are available for the scheduled time frame and can take this appointment, a manager will be able to re-assign this appointment to one of the suggested users.</p>

<p>My events table looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `calendar_events` (
   `event_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
   `start_on` datetime NOT NULL,
   `end_on` datetime NOT NULL,
   `subject` varchar(255) NOT NULL,

   `all_day_event` tinyint(1) DEFAULT '0' COMMENT '1 = all day event, 0 = no',
   `phone_call_id` int(11) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,

   `owner_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,

   `status` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '1' COMMENT '0 = purged, 1 = active, 2=pass, 3 = cancled, 5 = waiting for auditor to be enabled',
   PRIMARY KEY (`event_id`),

   KEY `client_id` (`client_id`),
   KEY `account_id` (`account_id`)
 ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
</code></pre>

<p>so lets for event_id = 100 is assigned to user_id = 2 and scheduled to start_on = '2014-09-21 10:00:00' and end_on '2014-09-21 10:00:00'</p>

<p>and user_id = 5 has appointment start_on '2014-09-21 11:45:00' and end_on '2014-09-21 12:30:00'</p>

<p>and user_id = 2 can not make his appointment that is scheduled for '2014-09-21 10:00:00' so they system will suggest user_id = 5 as he will be for the following 105 minutes.</p>

<p>The the final data set will need to be</p>

<pre><code>event_id org_owner  suggested_owner   available_for
100      2          5                 105
</code></pre>

<p>The following query will give me a list of all available users to from the <code>users</code> table along with a start_on end_on value if the user have an event scheduled (one user can have multiple records.) If the start_on is null in this query that means this user does not have any event otherwise it will return the start of each event.</p>

<p>So if user ID appears in the query above and have a NULL value in the start_on column, this means that this user is available all day so this user should be 1 of the 5 users to recommend because it has one of the highest availability. But if a user has one/multiple rows in the data set with a non-null value in the start on then, we need to look at the start_on that is the closest to the event and then recommend the top 5 that have the greatest availability value.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT user_id, start_on, end_on, subject
FROM view_users AS su
LEFT JOIN calendar_events AS c ON c.owner_id = su.user_id AND c.start_on NOT BETWEEN '2014-09-30 00:00:00' AND '2014-09-30 23:59:59' AND c.status = 1
WHERE su.is_available_today = 1
</code></pre>

<p>How can I extract this data set?</p>

<p>To try and give a brief overview, to create the behavior I wanted I created the scheduler using two combined sortables, one acting as a 'canvas' - an area where we can drag the appointments around and a sortable so we can drag appointments into blocks of other appointments within the canvas. I flirted with combining draggable and sortable but this option was not giving me quite the desired behavior.</p>

<p>Now, part of the scheduler is the ability to create a new line (day) which in turn expands the canvas area, this (to look at) works fine with extra logic I've added, new line appears etc but the containment size (set to the canvas area) will not update 'on the fly' and therefore there's an area of the canvas (bottom - the size of the new day) which I can not drag over. Only when I drop the appointment onto a new line does the containment area update with the new height and I can then drag an appointment into the bottom area.</p>

<p>My question is, is this default sortable containment behavior - that the containment area size will/can only update upon stop/update, or is there a way to force an update to containment size while dragging.</p>

<p>I have searched extensively for an answer on this but cannot find anything on this particular topic, any help would be massively appreciated.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/xcopy.mspx?mfr=true"" rel=""nofollow"">xcopy reference</a> for all.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>But somehow the event is created in the calendar and other issue is while providing time for the event to be created the option button for ""am/pm"" I can choose pm but after saving it &amp; loading the error page &amp; visiting the same page it shows ""am"" even after choosing ""pm""</p>

<p>But I don't know how to detect the touch's velocity. I would think with a combination of a timer and a variable that stores the old touch's location?

<h2>DO NOT EXECUTE THIS CODE ON ANY MACHINE. IT COULD BE A MALICIOUS CODE</h2>

<p>Hi,
   I got a file on fb, from someone which obviously looked like a <code>virus</code>. So I downloaded it happy that I am not on <em>Windows</em>.</p>

<p>I scanned it on virustotal, and it said this file was just scanned sometime ago meaning this file has been circulating a while. I scanned it still and virustotal says its clean.</p>

<p>So its Zip file, with a jar file and when I decompiled the .class file in jar file to <code>java</code> code, it had hardcoded strings to <code>C:\</code> drive and a dropbox url to download a dat file. Then uses regsvr to do some registry level changes.</p>

<p>So, on that note it was nicely concealed with an innocent jar file. But even the downloaded <code>module.dat</code> file looks to virus free according to <code>virustotal</code></p>

<p>I have a flight search form with select boxes.
Select box results are populated via PHP from MySQL.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Forward flight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Departure city - ""London""</p>
  
  <p>Destination city - All cities exept London</p>
  
  <p>Flight date - All flight dates for flight London->Forward Destination
  City</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Backward flight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Departure city - Again all cities exept London</p>
  
  <p>Destination city - All cities exept Backward Departure City</p>
  
  <p>Flight date - All flight dates for flight Backward Departure
  City->Backward Destination City</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no problem making this form using only PHP and form GET method, but, of course, I'd like to get rid of page reloading. Obvious solution - AJAX.</p>

<p>My approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use onChange event on select box for calling javascript function with attribute 'this.value'</li>
<li>javascript function sends XMLHttpRequest to the server (.php file) with GET method</li>
<li>.php file contains functions with MySQL requests, that are called with simple ""if ($_GET['value_sent_with_javascript_function'])""</li>
<li>javascript function places php responce in a div - document.getElementById(""div_id"").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;</li>
</ol>

<p>This works fine for two fileds (first one is ""parent"", the second one - ""child"" - is populated depending on ""parent"" box selected value). But if i want to use same method to populate third field (the one that is dependant on ""child""), it's just doesnt' work. As I'm not the specialist in javascript, I just can't figure this out.</p>

<p>I bet there is a simple solution!</p>

<p>I have an unbound DatagridView on a form and it keeps on getting its contents jumbled/overlapped. There's no paint overriding, fewer than 20 rows and there's only text going into the cells. The problem appears when I switch tabs to the one with the form on it and also sometimes when I hide rows. When switching tabs I get a small imprint of text from the old tab stick onto the datagridview.
I've tried putting refreshes everywhere but that didn't help.</p>

<p>The jumbling after hiding rows looks similar to this guys problem: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23296390/datagridview-jumbled-text-rendering-and-setting-backcolor"">DataGridView jumbled text rendering and setting BackColor</a></p>

My problem is that i originally had a var tool with the default value ""pencil"", and i wanted to change this variable to ""rect"" (didn't start with the circle yet, since i wanted to make this work first) with clicking on the respective div so that i could have an if-statement for either drawing, rectangles or circles. This didn't work though, and i singled the variable out, since i got an alert i placed in the onclick-function. 
After that i tried using boolean variables (pencil = true, rect = false, would have been one ""state"") but that doesn't work either. I do have the if-statements already written down, so my conclusion right now is that i somehow have the booleans as constants (since pencil = true is my default state for the var), which seems unlikely. The more logical explanation is that i am not correctly changing the value of the variable with the div-click.</p>

<p>Here's the part of my code:</p>

<pre><code>var canvas = document.getElementById(""canvas"");
var ctx = canvas.getContext(""2d"");

var color = ""black"";
var drawing = false;
var pencil = true;
var rect = false;



//Pencil
var pencilDiv = document.getElementById(""pencil"");
pencilDiv.onclick = function () {
  pencil = true;
  rect = false;
}

//Rect
var rectDiv = document.getElementById(""rect"");
rectDiv.onclick = function () {
  rect = true;
  pencil = false;
}

if (pencil) {
  canvas.onmousedown = function (event) {
    drawing = true;
  }

  canvas.onmousemove = function (event) {
    if (drawing) {
      draw()
    }
  }

  canvas.onmouseup = function (event) {
    drawing = false;
  }
}

if (rect) {
  canvas.onmousedown = function (event) {
    rect()
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Both the draw and rect function work. I also tried if(pencil == true &amp;&amp; rect == false), doesn't work either.</p>

<p>Sorry if the answer is obvious and i just don't see it, this is the second time im programming in Javascript.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

I need to be able to associate a User (Id) with a Company. I have linked to SelectCompInst and have passed in the user Id.
I have a general bool flag on the companyinstitution model which I set up in the get method. The flag is correctly shown in the view.

<p>I have looked at the post back using fiddler and am getting nothing at all.. although the Post function is being hit. The IList Company is null...
I am sure this boils down to a fundamental misunderstanding on my part but having struggled with it for 2 days now.. have to throw myself on the mercy of the wiser community :)</p>

<p>I would like to put a link against each row in the table and simply pass back an id for the row and the user id.. Thanks.</p>

<p>Further edit after Stephens comment..
The scenario is in the editing of a User. A user can have a CompanyInstituion Id as part of its model. I wish to present a list of companies to the operator (not necessarily the User) to allow them to attach a company id to that user. So in concept its dead simple - present a list of companies to pick from. Press a 'select' link on the company line and return to the controller to sort it out. Hence I need to preserve the UserId in the Viewbag - yes I can create a viewmodel if needed but getting the company id alone would be a start)..
So that's it.. present the list, select one and return it.. I don't really want to use checkboxes anyway.. I kind of 'got there' after trying some things. I originally had the submit button in the loop before I added the checkbox. I did try putting the Company Id on the button but that didn't work either.</p>

<p>So far i have seen the use of subclassing but don't really understand the importance/reason of using the practice !</p>

<p>From what i understand:</p>

<pre><code>""class2.m"":
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>You make a class which inherits from the UIView.</p>

<p>""class1.m"":</p></li>
<li><p>From the superclass ""class1"" you make an instance of class one which inherits from class2 ?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what i am trying to understand is that why would you have a class which inherits from a class2.m that inherits from another (UIView), instead of inheriting UIView directly from class1 ? </p>

<p>Sorry i sound like such a stubborn person but i simply just don't get it ? I really want to know why...</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Can someone please explain using an example of something like a class called userProfile and guestProfile that subclasses Profile ?</p>

It seems that the memory is not freed when release is called on custom view controller classes I have created whose views have been added as subviews.</p>

<p>Here's an example of my situation:</p>

<p>I have created a view controller with an accompianing .xib (to add a sort of popover/menu that allows the user to select a video to play). A button in the top right hand corner of the screen/app calls a function which allocs a new instance of a videoMenu class I created, then adds it's view as a subview. When the user selects a video, a function is called to hide the popover/menu's view, then releases the instance (before displaying/playing the video). If the menu is ""open"" and the button is pressed again, I have it set up to act like a close button (hiding and then releasing the menu) ... i.e. it toggles the menu.</p>

<p>If I keep pressing the button, the menu appears, and then hides/releases ... over and over ... which is expected. I have noticed though in Instruments->Allocations that when the release is called, the allocations do not decrease. The allocations just keep increasing as I open/close/open/close/etc., as if the release doesn't actually free up memory. I've added an <code>NSLog</code> in the <code>dealloc</code> of the menu to ensure that <code>dealloc</code> is in fact being called.</p>

<p>I have noticed that if I call <code>[videoMenu.view removeFromSuperview]</code> before calling <code>[videoMenu release]</code>, the allocation does in fact reduce.</p>

<p>Is <code>removeFromSuperview</code> the solution?
Is it necessary?</p>

<p>The .xib file has many <code>UIImageViews</code> in it, and I am also wondering if they are the reason that the allocation continually increases (in my example outlined above) ... meaning do the same images just keep getting cached over and over?</p>

<p>When I change them to Integer I get errors in my switch statement. The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a> say that Integer should be ok within Switches. </p>

  <p>[Switch] also works with enumerated types (discussed in Enum Types),
  the String class, and a few special classes that wrap certain
  primitive types: Character, Byte, Short, and Integer (discussed in
  Numbers and Strings).</p>

<p>In my code below if i is a <code>int</code> then it compiles. When it is an <code>Integer</code> it doesnt saying that a <code>constant expression is required</code>. I have tried doing <code>.intValue()</code> but this doesnt work either.</p>

I will use .NET to get the data and feed it to the library using json deserialization. However I am not sure how C# classes are serialized to json. Will the built-in .NET json serializer support this json structure or do I have to invest in a more advanced library like json.net? I never used json.net. My approach is to do  several trial and error approaches creating different C# classes and looking at the output json until the json structure matches the format below.

only the Table Header displays and there is no list of Subcategories.</p>

<p>If you remove the if statement all Subcategories are listed under
the Table Header. Empties and Assigned.</p>

<p>The issue is that when I'm trying to read InputStream to BufferedImage(BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(in);) the image (img variable) turns out to be null.</p>

<p>I am aware of following rule from oracle docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If no registered ImageReader claims to be able to read the resulting
  stream, null is returned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However if I try to create file with outputstream and read the resulting file with same ImageIO.read() - everything tuns out ok. I wonder if there are specific JSCH issues which doesn't return complete inputStream with get() method (as in in = sftpChannel.get( ""/path/to/file"" + fn );)?</p>

<p>I'm using the following code in Activity2A for up navigation: </p>

<pre><code>@Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        switch (item.getItemId()) {
        // Respond to the action bar's Up/Home button
        case android.R.id.home:
            Intent upIntent = NavUtils.getParentActivityIntent(this);
            if (NavUtils.shouldUpRecreateTask(this, upIntent)) {
                // This activity is NOT part of this app's task, so create a new
                // task
                // when navigating up, with a synthesized back stack.
                TaskStackBuilder.create(this)
                // Add all of this activity's parents to the back stack
                        .addNextIntentWithParentStack(upIntent)
                        // Navigate up to the closest parent
                        .startActivities();
            } else {
                // This activity is part of this app's task, so simply
                // navigate up to the logical parent activity.
                NavUtils.navigateUpTo(this, upIntent);
            }
            return true;
        }
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It's working fine if I navigate to Activity2A on the first path (so it's logical parent is on the Activity stack already). But using the second path, clicking on the UP button takes me to MainActivity (the root), not to Activity1A (the logical parent). I'm testing this code on Android 4.2.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? </p>

<p>I have form fields which are nested within groups, where each the groups and the fields can be disabled depending on the values of other fields. Multiple parents can be disabled independent of each other.
Of course, I could query select and iteratively disable the children i.e. fields of a recently disabled parent. But to reactivate the fields I also have to iterate all the fields that are no longer within any disabled parent.</p>

<p>Or is it better to register an event on each parent? The structure has an assumed depth of 3 with about 100 elements.</p>

<p>A parent form field or an attribute aria-disabled would disable child fields, but that's no option since paper-elements are not aware of that.</p>

<p>As noted in a different question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17444338/mapping-amazon-product-category-to-the-correct-category-xsd"">Found Here</a> there is no direct mapping between them. This is complicated by the fact that Amazons XSD validation requires certain parameters to be required such as SoftwareVideoGamesGenre in the case of Software Video Games which in the UK can be found in the PC &amp; Video Games classification. </p>

However they are not found in the UK BTG. </p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>Has anyone been able to successfully map Amazon classifications to Products as at present I am only able to map to a generalized upper classification without having to manually go through the 10's of thousands of classifications checking each of the required parameters for each product type or to at least a parent more generalized classification using a more generalized product.</p>

In order to access the .rpt files I used Microsoft.InteropFormTools assembly.  This has worked OK for a number of years.  What this does is allows the user to specify what amounts to parameters to the reports in the Crystal Reports, and then click a button and out prints the report.  (The user is not interested in previewing the report, so it prints directly to the printer, using Crystal.)  The one problem, which I've never been able to figure out, is that sometimes (how, and under what circumstances I don't know, because I can reliably reproduce the error) loading the Crystal Report will cause an error flag to come up.  Next Crystal will insist that the user enter parameters to the report before it previews them.  OF course the users don't know what's going on, so what we've done in the past is just have the user start it over again, and Crystal normally is happy and sends the report to the printer.</p>

<p>However, we've got new users coming on board to do this, and they're not as forgiving. When I wrote this app 4 years ago, I let the CPU be “Any CPU”.  I'm wondering if that could be the root of my problems with these Crystal reports not coming out.  So, I've gotten into the project, and changed it from “Any CPU” to “x86”, which really is more appropriate, especially since our old version of Crystal is 32-bit.  However, now that I've done that I've got a new error message popping up.  Visual Studio 2008 is telling me that, “The system cannot find the reference specified”.  In this case the missing reference is Microsoft.InteropFormTools.  No other changes have happened to this application in 3 years, besides my changing the project configuration from “Any CPU” to “x86”.  Could that be what's causing it to not be able to find the path to Microsoft.InteropFormTools?</p>

<p>The code initially exposed collections (arrays) of a variety of ActiveRecord-style business objects - essentially objects wrapping database fields.  I'm changing the arrays to generic lists, but the aspect of the code I'm curious about is that the previous developer had Get methods for each type of object he was wrapping, thusly:</p>

<pre><code>public Thing GetThing(int i) {
    return things[i];
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are several of these methods, and I cannot for the life of me think of any possible advantage of using that mechanism over simply referring to things[i] directly. Let's assume, for argument's sake, that things is a public property, not a public field (in this case it's actually an auto-implemented property, so that assumption is actually true).</p>

<p>Am I missing something obvious? Or even something esoteric?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I should probably clarify that these collections are currently accessed from within for loops:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; thingsCount; i== ) {
    dosomthing( GetThing(i) );
    dosomethingelse( GetThing(i) );
}
</code></pre>

<p>which I am refactoring to:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; thingsCount; i== ) {
    Thing thing = things[i];
    dosomthing( thing );
    dosomethingelse( thing );
}
</code></pre>

<p>and perhaps even to use things.foreach().</p>

<p>However, (and I know its not quite released yet), there is little-to-no information, tutorials or examples out there to move you on from the simple blog tutorial.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do now is build an app that will show me the collections I have in Mongodb, and then let me work with which ever collection I choose. I can't seem to figure out:</p>

<p>a) how would I build a model that enumerates the collections - preferably according to my internal naming scheme, </p>

<p>b) how do I break the convention model so I can specify the name of the collection to use?</p>

<p>I think there are two things i'm struggling with to answer these two questions - perhaps a fundamental misunderstanding of how to move a model in MVC beyond the simple collection-model-controller-view examples, and secondly, the actual process of telling the mongo datasource what collection to use.</p>

<p>any pointers or examples, gratefully received.</p>

<p>Chris</p>

<p><strong>update::</strong></p>

<p>So I figured out how to set the collection - for reference you can set source in the $_meta array like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected $_meta = array(
    'source' =&gt; '&lt;&lt;collectionName&gt;&gt;'
);
</code></pre>

<p>still no idea how to use a Model that will list me all the collections I have in my DB though. Any ideas how to do that from a philosophical and also technological manner?</p>

<p><strong>further update::</strong></p>

<p>so I have got a bit further thanks to the comments below. At least I might now be able to re-phrase the question a bit. I can define my model something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
namespace app\models;
use lithium\data\Model;

class Posts extends \lithium\data\Model{

    protected $_meta = array('source' =&gt; false);

    public function testcolls(){
        return (self::connection()-&gt;sources());
    }
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then in my view I can use:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php foreach ($post-&gt;testcolls() as $coll): ?&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;?=$coll ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>that works - however, what I really want to do is not create a 'testcolls' method in my Model but as Medhi suggested below, I need to override the find method. I can't seem to figure out how to do that and what it would need to return. The docs are not too clear on this.</p>

<p><strong>final update</strong> </p>

<p>based on the comment below and a bit of experimentation, I came up with the following that works for being able to call find with a collection as a parameter.</p>

<p>model:</p>

<pre><code>class Dataqueues extends \lithium\data\Model{

    protected $_meta = array('source' =&gt; false);

    public static function find($filter, array $options = array()) {
        if (isset($options['collection'])){
            self::meta('source', $options['collection']);
        }
        return parent::find('all',$options);
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>controller:</p>

<pre><code>class DataqueuesController extends \lithium\action\Controller {

    public function index() {
        $dataqueues = Dataqueues::find('all',array('limit'=&gt;20,'collection'=&gt;'W501'));
        return compact('dataqueues');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>getting a model that returns a list of collections was also pretty simple in the end:</p>

<pre><code>class Collections extends \lithium\data\Model{

    protected $_meta = array('source' =&gt; false);

    public static function find($filter, array $options = array()) {

        return self::connection()-&gt;sources();
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>note that the controller won't support options or filters.</p>

"13879872","1","","","2012-12-14 13:45:44","","1","1014","<p>So I have a site under developement and a REST server behind it for a presentation,I'm checking some devices from the site and send the names through a GET on the server.The server finds some geo positioning data from a mySQL DB and returns them to the site as a response to the GET.</p>

<p>I want to dynamically draw a polyline for each different device and add to it any number of positions returned from the DB for each device.</p>

<p>Problem is for a polyline to be created I need: </p>

<p>-- a <code>markers</code> array for the markers(one marker for each position I get from the DB) </p>

<p>-- and a <code>latlngs</code> array for the position's location on a map</p>

<p>for each device!</p>

<p>The number of devices I check for or the positions I receive for each one of them are not static.I tried creating new arrays with <code>eval(""var "" + DeviceID + ""_Markers = [];"");</code> but it doesn't seem to work...</p>

<p>Besically what I do right now is:
Get the results from the DB in a very big string which has <code>$$</code> between the different devices, <code>||</code> between the different positions of the devices and <code>#</code> between the fields of each position!
Here is the code that gets and ""de-codes"" the string:</p>

<pre><code>var devArray = respData.split(""$$"");

for (i=0 ; i &lt; devArray.length ; i++)
{
    var posArray = devArray[i].split(""||"");
    for (j=posArray.length-1 ; j &gt;= 0 ; j--)
    {
        var data = posArray[j].split(""#"");
        var DeviceID = data[0];
        var Date = data[1];
        var Latitude = data[2];
        var Longitude = data[3];
        var Altitude = data[4];
        var Angle = data[5];
        var Speed = data[6];
        parent.ifr2.createLocationMarker(DeviceID,Date,Latitude,Longitude,Altitude,Angle,Speed);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>createLocationMarker()</code> calls the specific method on the htmp page that the google maps api is and as it says it creates a new location marker for each position read.</p>

<pre><code>    function createLocationMarker(DeviceID,Date,Latitude,Longitude,Altitude,Angle,Speed) {

    var newLocation =  new google.maps.LatLng(Latitude,Longitude);
    var locationMarker = new google.maps.Marker();

    locationMarker.setOptions({
      icon: locationIcon,
      shadow: newShadow,
      draggable: true,
      map: map,
      position: newLocation
    });

    if ((eval(""typeof "" + DeviceID + ""_latlngs"") === ""undefined"") {
        // latlngs Array
        eval(""var "" + DeviceID + ""_latlngs = new google.maps.MVCArray();"");

        // markers Array
        eval(""var "" + DeviceID + ""_Markers = [];"");

        // displayPath
        eval(""var "" + DeviceID + ""_displayPath = new google.maps.Polyline({ map: map, strokeColor: '#"" + Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16) + ""' ,strokeOpacity: 1.0, strokeWeight: 2, path: latlngs });"");
    }

    eval(DeviceID + ""_Markers.push(locationMarker);"");
    eval(DeviceID + ""_latlngs.push(newLocation);"");
    eval(DeviceID + ""_displayPath.setPath("" + DeviceID + ""_latlngs);"");

    locationMarker.setMap(map);

    var content = ""&lt;b&gt;Device ID: &lt;/b&gt;"" + DeviceID + ""&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Date: &lt;/b&gt;"" + Date + ""&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Latitude: &lt;/b&gt;"" + Latitude + ""&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Longitude: &lt;/b&gt;"" + Longitude + ""&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Altitude: &lt;/b&gt;"" + Altitude + ""&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angle: &lt;/b&gt;"" + Angle + ""&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed: &lt;/b&gt;"" + Speed + ""Km/h"";

    var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({
        content: content,
        disableAutoPan: true
    });

    google.maps.event.addListener(locationMarker, ""dblclick"", function() {

    });

    map.setCenter(newLocation);
}

<p>This seems to create new arrays with <code>eval</code> on every point even though they should exist after the first time they are created...
I'm sure there has to be a better way to implement this but I can't find any right now..
Any Idea on how to dynamically create a polyline for each different device and add it's positions in there? (Or a way to make this work,even though I know that <code>eval</code> is not a nice way to solve it..)</p>

"12330886","1","12615788","","2012-09-08 12:55:10","","3","547","<p>In designing my GWT/GAE app, it has become evident to me that my client-side (GWT) will be generating three types of requests:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> - ""answer me <em>right now</em>! I'm important and require a real-time response!!!""</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> - ""answer me <em>when you can</em>; I need to know the answer at some point but it's really not all that ugent.""</li>
<li><strong>Command</strong> - ""I don't need an answer. This isn't really a request, it's just a command to do something or process something on the server-side.""</li>
</ul>

<p>My <em>game plan</em> is to implement my GWT code so that I can specify, for each specific server-side request (<strong>note: I've decided to go with <code>RequestFactory</code> over traditional GWT-RPC</strong> for reasons outside the scope of this question), which type of request it is:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>SynchronousRequest</code> - Synchronous (from above); sends a command and eagerly awaits a response that it then uses to update the client's state somehow</li>
<li><code>AsynchronousRequest</code> - Asynchronous (from above); makes an initial request and somehow - either through polling or the GAE Channel API, is notified when the response is finally received</li>
<li><code>CommandRequest</code> - Command (from above); makes a server-side request and does not wait for a response (even if the server fails to, or refuses to, oblige the command)</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess my intention with <code>SynchronousRequest</code> is not to produce a totally blocking request, however it may block the user's ability to interact with a specific <code>Widget</code> or portion of the screen.</p>

<p>The added kicker here is this: GAE strongly enforces a timeout on all of its frontend instances (60 seconds). Backend instances have much more relaxed constraints for timeouts, threading, etc. So it is obvious to me that <code>AsynchronousRequests</code> and <code>CommandRequests</code> should be routed to backend instances so that GAE timeouts do not become an issue with them.</p>

<p>However, if GAE is behaving badly, or if we're hitting peak traffic, or if my code just plain sucks, I have to account for the scenario where a <code>SynchronousRequest</code> is made (which would have to go through a timeout-regulated frontend instance) and will timeout unless my GAE server code does something fancy. I know there is a method in the GAE API that I can call to see how many milliseconds a request has before its about to timeout; but although the name of it escapes me right now, it's what this ""fancy"" code would be based off of. Let's call it <code>public static long GAE.timeLeftOnRequestInMillis()</code> for the sake of this question.</p>

<p>In this scenario, I'd like to detect that a <code>SynchronousRequest</code> is about to timeout, and somehow dynamically convert it into an <code>AsynchronousRequest</code> so that it doesn't time out. Perhaps this means sending an <code>AboutToTimeoutResponse</code> back to the client, and force the client to decide about whether to resend as an <code>AsynchronousRequest</code> or just fail. Or perhaps we can just transform the <code>SynchronousRequest</code> into an <code>AsynchronousRequest</code> and push it to a queue where a backend instance will consume it, process it and return a response. I don't have any preferences when it comes to implementation, so long as the request doesn't fail or timeout because the server couldn't handle it fast enough (because of GAE-imposed regulations).</p>

<p>So then, here is what I'm actually asking here:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I wrap a <code>RequestFactory</code> call inside <code>SynchronousRequest</code>, <code>AsynchronousRequest</code> and <code>CommandRequest</code> in such a way that the <code>RequestFactory</code> call behaves the way each of them is intended? In other words, so that the call either partially-blocks (synchronous), can be notified/updated at some point down the road (asynchronous), or can just fire-and-forget (command)?</li>
<li>How can I implement my requirement to let a <code>SynchronousRequest</code> bypass GAE's 60-second timeout and still get processed without failing?</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: timeout issues are easily circumvented by re-routing things to backend instances, but backends don't/can't scale. I need scalability here as well (that's primarily why I'm on GAE in the first place!) - so I need a solution that deals with scalable frontend instances and their timeouts. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I'm inserting records with 20 threads (maybe I should use less? From what I know, the error would be Overloaded in this case, not Unavailable). I'm using a write consistency of ONE. I'm using AutoDiscoveryAtStartup and LeastActiveBalancingPolicy. The replication factor is 2.</p>

<p>I'm using Cassandra 1.2.8 (I tried with 2.0 and it's the same).</p>

<p>The error doesn't occur from the beginning. I ususally manage to insert about 2 million records before getting the error. My code is set to retry when an error occurs. After some dozens of retries, the insert usually succeeds. After that, it again works fine for some millions of inserts then I get the error again and the cycle continues.</p>

<p>Could it be because I set gc_grace = 60? Anyway, I don't get the error every 60 seconds so I don't think this is the reason.</p>

<p>Could you give me some suggestions about the reason of this error and what should I do?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>'nodetool tpstats' says I have some messages dropped:</p>

<p>Why does it not put the /Content prefix that it does locally.</p>

<p>I'm using the standard bootstrap files and it is the EXACT same websites running locally and online.</p>

<p>Also I'm bundling the content the following way:</p>

<pre><code>    bundles.Add(new StyleBundle(""~/Content/bootstrapcss"").Include(

<p>And the file structure looks the following:</p>

<p>Also bootstrap is looking for the files like this:</p>

<pre><code>url('../fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff')

<p>So I would suppose it would look in the Content folder and not root since it currently resides in the Content/bootstrapcss folder.</p>

I found a great list of open source ETL tools for Java <a href=""http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/open-source-etl"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and started reading up on them.</p>

<p>But that made me <em>really</em> confused.</p>

<p>Most of these tools (CloverETL, Pentaho, etc.) are GUI tools. Some of them, such as Smooks, are pure Java frameworks. I guess this makes sense: some ETL users may be non-technical and/or would like to use a GUI tool to set up transformations. Other users will be developers who want to tap into the raw ETL power of these tools.</p>

<p>My question(s): are there any benefits (additional features, etc.) that these GUI tools offer over the pure Java frameworks, or vice versa? Do the ""major player"" GUI tools such as CloverETL and Pentaho - which bill themselves as GUI tools - also have Java APIs that I can accomplish the same things with (programmatically)? Or are they pure GUI tools? I can't find Java Docs anywhere (for either one).</p>

"26435497","1","","","2014-10-18 01:39:01","","0","202","<p>This is a two part issue that resolves around a single objective:  <strong>Get DynamoDB to work with ServiceStack</strong> (particularly, as a <em>Session State Provider</em>, and as an <em>Authentication Provider</em>).</p>

<p>..:: Requirements ::..</p>

<p>What I must do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use DynamoDB for Session &amp; Credentials Management (an ASP.NET Identity 2.0 implementation)</li>
<li>Use ServiceStack 4.0.32 Authentication for 3rd party Federation Identity support</li>
<li>Get everything to work on a single web server (either in parallel or co-operatively)</li>
</ol>

<p>What I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon Web Services DLL for Session Management (DynamoDBSessionStoreProvider)</li>
<li>Custom ASP.NET Identity 2.0 Implementation for DynamoDB</li>
<li>ServiceStack 4.0.32 license and working example of 3rd party Federation</li>
</ul>

<p>..::  Session State ::..</p>

<p>I am using a DynamoDBSessionStoreProvider as per the <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsNET/latest/DeveloperGuide/net-dg-dynamodb-session.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>This works fine as a web.Config solution until I try to use it with Service Stack, which wires Session Providers up in code:</p>

<pre><code>Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(() =&gt; new CustomUserSession(),
                new IAuthProvider[] {
                    new CredentialsAuthProvider(appSettings),  
                    new BasicAuthProvider(appSettings)
            }));
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that CustomUserSession should inherit from AuthUserSession and override methods of interest as indicated in the ServiceStack <a href=""https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/SocialBootstrapApi/blob/master/src/SocialBootstrapApi/Models/CustomUserSession.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">SocialBootstrapAPI documentation</a>, but first I tried to access the DynamoDBSessionStateStore directly:</p>

<pre><code>Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(
                () =&gt; new DynamoDBSessionStateStore(),
                new IAuthProvider[] { 
                    new CredentialsAuthProvider(appSettings), 
                    new BasicAuthProvider()
            }));
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, this is an issue since DynamoDBSessionStateStore does not implement ServiceStack's IAuthProvider nor inherit from their AuthUserSession concrete implementation.  However, this is ultimately what I want.</p>

<p>So, I'm now back to my CustomUserSession, which extends AuthUserSession, but I am having issues getting exposure of DynamoDBSessionStateStore in the way ServiceStack expects.</p>

<p>What is going on is that ServiceStack is creating its own session cookies ss-pid while the custom session provider I've developed is using the .NET Identity session.  So, my question is this; given the latest ServiceStack 4.0.32 updates, <strong>should I conform my custom provider to use ss-pid or should I somehow get ServiceStack to recognize my custom provider via implementation of AuthUserSession?</strong></p>

<p>..::  Authentication ::..</p>

<p>I am using a custom ASP.NET Identity 2.0 implementation (a full Microsoft.AspNet.Identity implementation) for DynamoDB based strongly on <a href=""https://identitydynamodb.codeplex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">this project</a> found on codeplex.  I've made a number of alterations, but the core is basically the same.</p>

<p>The implementation makes use of the IdentityUser, IdentityRole, IdentityUserClaim, and IdentityCloudContext, etc. portions of Identity 2.0 and wraps them into a UserStore and RoleStore.</p>

<p>My question is mostly in regards to the ServiceStack 4.0.32 updates.  How should I get these two elements to play together?  How can I make the UserStore and RoleStore play nice with ServiceStack Authentication?  Implement a series of IAuthProviders? </p>

<p>Perhaps @mythz or someone else in the ServiceStack community will make use of the same DynamoDB ASP.NET Identity 2.0 implementation to start a collective (ServiceStack sanctioned) development project path that we all can agree on and contribute to.</p>

Specifically when the ChangePassword method is called as shown below I would expect that I would get a Unauthorized Access redirect to the Logon screen however I am able to step all the way through the ChangePassword method and receive a change password success. Can anyone help direct me in what I am doing wrong? </p>

<p>I have tested that in the ChangePassword method calling the IsUserInRole method does work as expected and I can redirect to the Logon screen in that condition but that seems burdensome to test for that condition in all my methods.

"9552003","1","9552181","","2012-03-04 03:14:05","","1","424","<p>So,<br>
I'm playing around with the DIRECTX API in C++ and designing a sprite interface that does clipping within parent <code>RECT</code>'s, like a UI window or another sprite or what have you.</p>

<p>This is because, later on, I'm going to make a scrolling function for a UI window.</p>

<p>I think an image would be appropriate to demonstrate what I am trying to achieve.<br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2h0G8.png"" alt=""Clipping""></p>

<p>In order to do clipping calculations, at least four variables/structs are required (from what I can discern):</p>

<ul>
<li>Parent <code>RECT</code>: the ""clipping"" bounds</li>
<li><code>D3DXIMAGE_INFO</code>: containing the image information, such as width and height</li>
<li>Sprite position</li>
<li>Draw <code>RECT</code>: for the <code>LPD3DXSPRITE-&gt;Draw()</code> function. Basically, what part of the image should be drawn. This is where the ""clipping"" is done.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I think it would be confusing if I showed you my entire interface and its inner workings and how it handles the variables. </p>

<p>So, instead,<br>
this piece of code demonstrates how I'm currently calculating the clipping.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>void ClippingCalculation(){
    RECT parent_bounds, draw_rect;
    D3DXVECTOR2 sprite_position; //Relative to parent rect
    D3DXIMAGE_INFO img_info;

    //Fill image info
    D3DXGetImageInfoFromFile(""image.png"", &amp;img_info); //Image is 100x100px

    //Define the rects
    SetRect(&amp;parent_bounds, 0, 0, 200, 200);
    SetRect(&amp;draw_rect, 0, 0, img_info.Width, img_info.Height); //Draw the entire image by default

    //Give it a position that makes a portion go out of parent bounds
    sprite_position = D3DXVECTOR2(150, 150); // 3/4 of the entire image is out of bounds

    //Check if completely within bounds
    bool min_x = (sprite_position.x &gt; parent_bounds.left),
         min_y = (sprite_position.y &gt; parent_bounds.top),
         max_x = (sprite_position.x+img_info.Width &lt; parent_bounds.right),
         max_y = (sprite_position.y+img_info.Height &lt; parent_bounds.bottom);

    if(min_x &amp;&amp; min_y &amp;&amp; max_x &amp;&amp; max_y) 
         return; //No clipping needs to be done

    float delta_top = parent_bounds.top - sprite_position.y,
          delta_left = parent_bounds.left - sprite_position.x,    
          delta_bottom = parent_bounds.bottom - sprite_position.y,
          delta_right = parent_bounds.right - sprite_position.x;

    //Check if completely outside bounds
    bool out_left = (delta_left &gt;= img_info.Width),
         out_top = (delta_top &gt;= img_info.Height),
         out_bottom = (delta_bottom &gt;= img_info.Height),
         out_right = (delta_right &gt;= img_info.Width);

    if(out_left || out_top || out_bottom || out_right){ 
         //No drawing needs to be done, it's not even visible
         return; //No clipping
    }

    if(!min_x) draw_rect.left = delta_left;

    if(!min_x) draw_rect.top = delta_top;

    if(!max_x) draw_rect.right = delta_right;

    if(!max_y) draw_rect.bottom = delta_bottom;

    return;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>My questions are:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Do you see anything immediately wrong with the code?</li>
<li>Is it efficient or inefficient?<br>
The clipping is done every time the sprite is repositioned, loaded or when a parent is added.</li>
<li>Is the math solid? Should I approach it differently?</li>
<li>Could it be done in a better way and could you provide examples?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a library I coded myself which uses an <code>nsq-go</code> type in one of the exported methods:</p>

<pre><code>func AddNsqSubscription(
    topic, channel string, 
    handler nsq.Handler, 
    config *nsq.Config) error { }
</code></pre>

<p>The library is called <code>messi</code> and I import the <code>nsq-go</code> like so <code>""messi/vendor/src/github.com/bitly/go-nsq""</code></p>

<p>The problem comes when I try to use this library in another project. For instance, in a project called <code>scribe</code> I have the following code (notice the imports):</p>

<pre><code>import (
    ""scribe/vendor/src/github.com/bitly/go-nsq""
    ""scribe/vendor/src/messi""
)

//...
nsqHandler := nsq.HandlerFunc(func(message *nsq.Message) error {
    msgHandler(MessiMessage{message})
    return nil
})

return messi.AddNsqSubscription(destination, subdestination, nsqHandler, nsq.NewConfig())
</code></pre>

<p>When I <code>go build</code> the following error is returned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>cannot use</strong> nsqHandler (type ""<strong>scribe</strong>/vendor/src/github.com/bitly/go-nsq"".HandlerFunc) as type ""<strong>messi</strong>/vendor/src/github.com/bitly/go-nsq"".Handler in argument to messi.AddNsqSubscription: 
      ""scribe/vendor/src/github.com/bitly/go-nsq"".HandlerFunc does not implement ""messi/vendor/src/github.com/bitly/go-nsq"".Handler (wrong type for HandleMessage method) </p>
  
  <p><strong>have</strong> HandleMessage(<em>""<strong>scribe</strong>/vendor/src/github.com/bitly/go-nsq"".Message) error<br>
          <strong>want</strong> HandleMessage(</em>""<strong>messi</strong>/vendor/src/github.com/bitly/go-nsq"".Message) error</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> I do not really know what is going on. The code <code>go-nsq</code> imported is exactly the same, yet golang wants that this code comes from the same folder?</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? </p>

<p>How can I change the active directory on the raspberry pi using <code>cd</code> and the <code>subprocess module</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Since I absolutely <em>hate</em> to use the command line, I am trying to create a basic GUI text-editor which can also compile my programs. For now, I am just trying to change the directory to <code>Desktop</code>. To do this, I am using the <code>subprocess</code> module. Here is my current code:</p>

<pre><code>from subprocess import *
call([""cd"",""Desktop""])
</code></pre>

<p>In the terminal, this line (<code>cd Desktop</code>) would change the active directory to <code>Desktop</code>. Oddly, when I run it through <code>subprocess</code>, I am given this error:</p>

<pre><code>OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

<p>and the structure of the solution (in terms of where the images are) looks like this;</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mGuhE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I now want to add proper disabled images for these buttons, and as it's purely ui related intend doing this in the code behind using the buttons' IsEnabledChanged event.  I'm think of code along these lines;</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub btnErsCheckSalesNote_IsEnabledChanged(sender As Object, e As DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs) Handles btnErsCheckSalesNote.IsEnabledChanged
    If btnErsCheckSalesNote.IsEnabled Then
        With btnErsCheckSalesNote

<p>The problem I'm facing is getting the correct syntax to point the where the hot images are, and then where the disabled images will be (in a folder called 'Disabled Images' under Resources). I tried doing something like this but it doesn't like it;</p>

<pre><code> .ImageSourceLarge =""/NewFishTrackerProfessional;component/Resources/Images/xml-ok232.png""
</code></pre>

<p>Is there an easy way to refer to these locations in code, or would I be better at this stage (as there aren't too many buttons to adjust) actually moving the images to a separate folder in the applications path.</p>

I want to <em>catch</em> the signal and stop it from killing the execution, just to see if I can get some useful info of the app's state at that precise moment.</p>

<p>Reading the <a href=""http://www.ofb.net/gnu/gdb/gdb_38.html#SEC38"" rel=""nofollow"">gdb documentation</a> I found the <code>handle</code> command, so I tried to apply it to the SIGKILL signal:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) handle SIGKILL stop nopass
Signal        Stop  Print   Pass to program Description
SIGKILL       Yes   Yes     No              Killed
</code></pre>

<p>So, as I understand this correctly:</p>

<pre><code>stop
    GDB should stop your program when this signal happens. This implies the print keyword as well. 
print
    GDB should print a message when this signal happens. 
nopass
    GDB should not allow your program to see this signal. 
</code></pre>

<p>once the <code>SIGKILL</code> signal is emitted, <code>gdb</code> should somehow catch it, print the message, stop the execution and don't let the app kill itself, right?</p>

<p>The problem is that this doesn't happen and the app terminates.</p>

<p>Do you know how could I <em>catch</em> the signal?</p>

<p><strong>Useful Info:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The piece of code that is running when the signal is emitted is executed <strong>in another thread.</strong></li>
<li><strong>gdb version:</strong> 4.4.3</li>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Based on the advice I've seen in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3565718/pointcut-matching-methods-with-annotated-parameters/3567170#3567170 (and correcting a couple of misunderstandings and adding space I overlooked) I've got to the point where the following works:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>@Before(""execution(public * *(.., @full.path.to.MyAnnotation (*), ..))"")
public void beforeMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println(""At least one of the parameters are annotated with @MyAnnotation"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is almost what I need - all I need to do is pass the value of the annotated argument as an parameter to the method. I can't quite work out the syntax to get Spring to do this (the linked answer does not show this).</p>

This varies even between instances with same hardware configs (instance types) because I use different amazon images (AMIs): some plain windows server and some windows server with sql server (both of them have additional costs compared with plain linux instances)</p>

<p>The EC2 Java API has a describeInstances() method which returns Instance objects with metadata such as instance id, instance type (m1.small/large...), state (running,stopped..) public ip, etc. </p>

<p>This Instance object also has a .getLicense().getPool() which according to the Java API should return ""The license pool from which this license was used (ex: 'windows')."" I thought this is were it may also give 'windows+sqlserver' or something to that effect.</p>

<p>The getLicense() method does however return null..</p>

<p>I've navigated around the EC2 web console, not being able to find this information, but I'm hoping that it is possible - otherwise it would mean that you cannot identify the true hourly cost of an particular instance unless you know which AMI was used to create it in the first place (plain windows server or windows server with sql server).</p>

I am creating a new InDesign document with &nbsp;<code>var newDoc = app.documents.add()</code>&nbsp;.
<br /><br />
I am trying to place another pre-existing InDesign document that has paragraph styles into the new document. The reason why I'm not simply using &nbsp;<code>styledDocument.execute()</code>&nbsp; is that it opens this pre-existing document, whereas I want the document itself to be ""<code>Untitled</code>"".
<br /><br />
I am attempting to do this with &nbsp;<code>newDoc.place(styledDocument)</code>&nbsp;, which is not working. The document is untitled as intended, but has the styled document as a link only, and is <strong><em>not</em></strong> populating the &nbsp;<code>Paragrah Styles</code>&nbsp; window with the styles from the styled document...
<br /><br /><hr />
It <em>is</em> possible from &nbsp;<code>File --&gt; Place...</code>&nbsp; in the InDesign menu to open another InDesign document into this one <em>manually</em>, in which the styles from this document <strong><em>do</em></strong> appear in the &nbsp;<code>Paragrah Styles</code>&nbsp; window... But I want to programmatically do this. So, I am assuming that &nbsp;<code>File --&gt; Place...</code>&nbsp; from the InDesign menu is different than &nbsp;<code>newDoc.place(oldDoc)</code>.
<br /><br /><hr />
Here is my code (which is <em>not</em> working):

<p>Later studied in Impala documentation that Impala does not support custom
SERDE. In such case how I can overcome this issue such that my CSV data
with quotes is taken care. I want to use CSV Serde because it takes of
commas in values which is a legitimate field vavlue.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot</p>

Everything remains the same except for the parameterized constructor. There are a few flaws in the code as you can see, but bare in mind that I am not fully completed with this. Currently I am more worried about the array since this is a new concept introduced yesterday. 
I have tried several different things and researched this for hours. Most of the responses say to just use the vector class but this is for homework which helps us understand memory allocation and dynamic arrays. Currently this is my .cpp and .h file that is giving me problems. Every time the delete (or the clear function) operation is triggered an error occurs that states blahblah.exe has triggered a break point. </p>

<p>1) In web service communication we use soap for cross platform communication, but I like to know why soap is needed, as XML itself is universally acceptable data exchange format than why there is need of soap which internally uses xml tags for data exchange</p>

<p>2) If I use gethttpenabled for data exchange instead of mex protocol in wcf it generates simple web service proxy for communication so like to know if my service is using  nettcpbinding instead of basic or ws http banding so whether wcf and client can communicate or will create some issues.</p>

<p>3) As soap can be used with tcp protocol,  whether tcp protocol can be used for communication between different platforms that is client in java and wcf in net</p>

<p>I have a bunch of controllers with methods that work with the resource objects.</p>

<p>When the state of retrieval matters, these methods use the $promise property of the resource to ensure that they only process the objects after they are retrieved. These all work fine with existing and updated resource objects.</p>

<p><code>
var ProposalResource = $resource(proposalUrl, {id: '@id'}, {'update': {method: 'PUT'}});
</code></p>

<p>The resource objects are obtained by <code>ProposalResource.get({id:...</code>.</p>

<p>However, when I create a new resource object in order to make a new object using <code>new ProposalResource(...</code>, the methods fail because the $promise property is undefined.</p>

<p>I've worked around this by setting the $promise property on the new resource object to a resolved promise.</p>

<p>This seems to work OK but it feels like a nasty kludge. The option of explicitly checking for whether or not the $promise property is defined in all the other methods is even less appealing though.</p>

using numerical integration methods. I am using Python 2.5.2 along with SciPy's numerical integration package. In order to get a feel for it, i decided to try integrating sin(x) and observed this behavior-</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from math import pi
&gt;&gt;&gt; from scipy.integrate import quad
&gt;&gt;&gt; from math import sin
&gt;&gt;&gt; def integrand(x):
...     return sin(x)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; quad(integrand, -pi, pi)
(0.0, 4.3998892617846002e-14)
&gt;&gt;&gt; quad(integrand, 0, 2*pi)
(2.2579473462709165e-16, 4.3998892617846002e-14)
</code></pre>

<p>I find this behavior odd because -<br />
1. In ordinary integration, integrating over the full cycle gives zero.<br />
2. In numerical integration, this (1) isn't necessarily the case, because you may just be 
   approximating the total area under the curve.</p>

<p>In any case, either assuming 1 is True or assuming 2 is True, I find the behavior to be inconsistent. Either both integrations (-pi to pi and 0 to 2*pi) should return 0.0 (first value in the tuple is the result and the second is the error) or return 2.257...</p>

<p>Can someone please explain why this is happening? Is this really an inconsistency? Can someone also tell me if I am missing something really basic about numerical methods?</p>

<p>In any case, in my final application, I plan to use the above method to find the arc length of a function. If someone has experience in this area, please advise me on the best policy for doing this in Python.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br />
<strong>Note</strong><br />
I already have the first differential values at all points in the range stored in an array.<br />
Current error is tolerable.<br />
<strong>End note</strong></p>

<p>I have read Wikipaedia on this. As Dimitry has pointed out, I will be integrating sqrt(1+diff(f(x), x)^2) to get the Arc Length. What I wanted to ask was - is there a better approximation/ Best practice(?) / faster way to do this. If more context is needed, I'll post it separately/ post context here, as you wish.</p>

Imagine you have a function from an external library (which cannot be modified!) like this:</p>

<p><code>void fortranFunction(int n, void udf(double*) );</code></p>

<p>I would like to pass as the udf function above a function member of an existing class. Please look at the following code:</p>

<pre><code>// External function (tipically from a fortran library) 
void fortranFunction(int n, void udf(double*) ) 
{ 
     // do something 
} 

// User Defined Function (UDF) 
void myUDF(double* a) 
{ 
      // do something 
} 

// Class containing the User Defined Function (UDF) 
class myClass 
{ 
public: 
    void classUDF(double* a) 
    { 
        // do something... 
    }; 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
    int     n=1; 

    // The UDF to be supplied is myUDF 
    fortranFunction(n, myUDF); 

    // The UDF is the classUDF member function of a myClass object 
    myClass myClassObj; 
    fortranFunction(n, myClassObj.classUDF);   // ERROR!! 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>The last line of the code above results in a compilation error, because you cannot declare the classUDF member function as a static function.
Do you know if it is possible to solve this issue? 
Probably Boost libraries could help me, but I do not know how (please consider that fortranFunction cannot be modified because is from an external library).
Thanks a lot!

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
#|
exec clisp -q -q $0 $0 ${1+""$@""}
exit

</code></pre>

<p>This allows more complex operations within a shebang. CLISP is one of the few languages that omits the script name from ARGV. Here, the script name is forcibly sent twice to CLISP so that the Lisp script can access its script name via ARGV.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this in Factor so that the following works?</p>

<pre><code>$ cat ios7crypt.factor 
#! /usr/bin/env factor

USING: kernel namespaces io prettyprint ;
IN: ios7crypt

: usage ( -- )
    ""Usage: ios7crypt.factor [options]"" print

MAIN: main

$ ./ios7crypt.factor
f

$ ./ios7crypt.factor -help

<p>The above line should print <code>t</code>, but Factor ignores <code>-help</code> because it came after the script name.</p>

<pre><code>$ factor ios7crypt.factor 
f

$ factor -help ios7crypt.factor 
t
</code></pre>

<p>This works because <code>-help</code> was sent before the script name. <code>./ios7crypt.factor -help</code> silently drops <code>-help</code> because the shebang expands to <code>factor ios7crypt.factor -help</code>. Unfortunately, Factor seems to require all command line options before the script name.</p>

<p>Is there a multiline shebang overriding this behavior?</p>

<p>So this way I can see that all things are there, but I can't get it to be shown right, without playing with fixed width and height numbers. AND the fact that Android Studio has a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14370745/fragmenttabhost-graphical-layout-doesnt-render"">bug</a> which causes a null reference for rendering for FragmentTabLayout make things even harder to play with, since I can't test option in real time.</p>

<p>I appreciate if anyone can help me with this, since I new to Android, I am not quite sure how to get this done.</p>

<pre><code>UIView
├── UIScrollView
│   └── &lt;subviews&gt;
├── UIButton
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to forward touch events to both the UIScrollView and UIButton.</p>

<p>The UIScrollView covers the superview and is above the UIButton. It has a transparent background so you can sometimes see the button below when the scroll view's contents are not covering it.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zc2zU.png"" width=""300""></p>

<p>Touching and scrolling anywhere on the screen pans the scroll view's contents (purple dot). However, the button doesn't receive touches because it is below the scroll view.</p>

<p><strong>What I want is for the button to be touchable as if the scroll view weren't covering it, while simultaneously keeping the scroll view's behavior of panning its contents.</strong> </p>

<p>So far I've tried overriding hitTest:withEvent: and touchesBegan/Moved/Ended/Cancelled in the superview. My technique was to let the superview handle all touches and forward them to the UIButton and UIScrollView.</p>

<pre><code>override func hitTest(point: CGPoint, withEvent event: UIEvent?) -&gt; UIView? {
    self.hitViews = []
    let subviews = self.subviews as [UIView]
    for subview in subviews {
        let subviewPoint = self.convertPoint(point, toView: subview)
        if let hitView = subview.hitTest(subviewPoint, withEvent: event) {
            self.hitViews.append(hitView)
        }
    }
    return self
}

override func touchesBegan(touches: NSSet, withEvent event: UIEvent) {
    if self.inTouchesBegan || self.hitViews == nil {
        return
    }

    self.inTouchesBegan = true
    for subview in self.hitViews! {
        subview.touchesBegan(touches, withEvent: event)
    }
    self.inTouchesBegan = false
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the UIButton is not processing the forwarded touches even though it is definitely in the array of hit subviews. Is what I am trying to accomplish possible with UIKit?</p>

<pre><code>// Original prefab
GameObject prefab = x;
prefab.tag = ""Untagged"";

// A copy of the original prefab
GameObject prefabCopy = PrefabUtility.InstantiatePrefab(prefab) as GameObject;
prefabCopy.tag = ""EditorOnly"";  // Change from initial value ""Untagged""

Debug.Log(prefab.tag);     // ""Untagged""   - expected
Debug.Log(prefabCopy.tag); // ""EditorOnly"" - expected

// Replace contents of prefab file with `prefabCopy`
PrefabUtility.ReplacePrefab(prefabCopy, prefab);

// Destroy the copy
DestroyImmediate(prefabCopy);

<p>My issue is what is best practice to extend the iterator to return a new iterator which I would like to be lazy evaluated.  Coming from a C# background I normal use <code>IEnumerable</code> and use the <code>yield</code> keyword, but such an option doesn't appear to exist in Scala.</p>

<p>for example I could have </p>

<pre><code>List(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7).iterator.map(complex time consuming algorithm).takeWhileInclusive(_ &lt; 6)

<p>so far I have:</p>

  implicit def extendIterator(i : Iterator[Any]) = new IteratorExtension(i)

<p>I'm not a windows developer per se, but have downloaded and tried to check various options (in order to not reinvent the wheel) such as Sparkle, DDay, CSAutoUpdater, Npackd and just started looking into Google Omaha - but most assume that check happens when the windows application is started using their libraries/components. I need to run an autoupdater independently of the app I'm trying to update - so I need to first get all users to run a setup.exe which should install and start my windows service so that it can run with windows daily to run a program to check, download and install the update.</p>

<p>I found some sample code for writing windows service on stackoverflow, codeproject also, but couldn't find how to autoinstall it (ideally with no UAC hassles for newer windows versions). All required using instalutil or some other manual process to install and start the service.</p>

<p>Any guidance on this would be great! Thanks - and apologies to the long winded question. Will update with additional results as I try out other products.</p>

"25212484","1","","","2014-08-08 21:24:54","","0","106","<p>There is an hour-long <code>.mp3</code> file on the local disk of an HTTP server. About 10 web clients (using recent versions of Chrome or Firefox, with a recent version of Flash installed) start downloading that file. The JavaScript or Flash ActionScript on the web page causes the audio in the <code>.mp3</code> file to be played on the speakers of the web client computers. Playback of the audio is started before the file download has completed, and the file is not saved to disk on the web client (so this is streaming).</p>

<p>Each web client user must hear the same audio at about the same time, no matter when he started downloading. (Of course, he will miss earlier parts of the audio.) The maximum allowed time difference is 30 milliseconds, i.e. if user A hears a particular piece of audio from the file, then user B should also hear it no more than 30 milliseconds later. It's not necessary to have low latency, e.g. it's OK to buffer audio for up to 5 seconds (preferably only up to 2 seconds) on the client side, but the actual playback on the speakers should happen in a synchronized way.</p>

<p>Let's suppose that the clocks on the clients and the server go at the same speed for the duration of the playback, but they can be set to very different times. The ServerDate JavaScript library (<a href=""https://github.com/NodeGuy/ServerDate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/NodeGuy/ServerDate</a>) or something similar can be used to make the client JavaScript code know about the server time at high accuracy.</p>

<p>It's OK to pre-encode the <code>.mp3</code> with any settings (e.g. low, constant bitrate). It's also OK to convert it to another lossy compression format supported by the web clients.</p>

<p>My question is: how can such a system be implemented? What existing technologies (e.g. WebRTC, JW Player, other web players) can be used? What are relevant open source and free software technologies available? Can HTML5 + JavaScript give better synchronization accuracy than a Flash-based player (or does this matter)? Is an implementation already available?</p>

<p>I've found a similar question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8844048/mp3-website-player-with-synchronized-playback-not-streaming"">mp3 website player with synchronized playback (not streaming)</a> My requirements are stricter than that: the time difference between web clients shouldn't be more than 30 milliseconds. It also doesn't deal with clock synchronization.</p>

TitleSchemaFactoryWrapper visitor = new TitleSchemaFactoryWrapper();
mapper.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(clazz, visitor);
JsonSchema schema = visitor.finalSchema();
schemas.put(clazz, mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(schema));
</code></pre>

<p>I'm generating several schemas via the above code.  One of the pojos has an internal embedded enum to limit the possible values, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {

    @JsonProperty(""name"")
    private String name;
    @JsonProperty(""startDayOfWeek"")
    private MyClass.StartDayOfWeek startDayOfWeek;

    @JsonProperty(""timezone"")
    private String timezone;
    @JsonIgnore
    private Map&lt;String, Object&gt; additionalProperties = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();

    /**
     *

    }

    public void setStartDayOfWeek(MyClass.StartDayOfWeek startDayOfWeek) {
        this.startDayOfWeek = startDayOfWeek;
    }

    public static enum StartDayOfWeek {

        MONDAY(""Monday""),
        TUESDAY(""Tuesday""),
        WEDNESDAY(""Wednesday""),

        static {
            for (MyClass.StartDayOfWeek c: values()) {
                constants.put(c.value, c);
            }
        }

        private StartDayOfWeek(String value) {
            this.value = value;
        }

        @JsonValue
        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return this.value;
        }

        @JsonCreator
        public static MyClass.StartDayOfWeek fromValue(String value) {
            MyClass.StartDayOfWeek constant = constants.get(value);
            if (constant == null) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(value);
            } else {
                return constant;
            }
        }

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code should limit the possible String values in the JSON data that's passed around to ""Monday"", ""Tuesday"", ""Wednesday"", etc.</p>

<p>When I run the schema generator on the code in question, I expect to get something like the following schema:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""type"" : ""object"",
  ""javaType"" : ""my.package.MyClass"",
  ""properties"": {
    ""startDayOfWeek"" : {
      ""type"" : ""string"",
      ""enum"" : [ ""Monday"", ""Tuesday"", ""Wednesday"", ""Thursday"", ""Friday"", ""Saturday"", ""Sunday"" ]
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but instead I'm getting this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""type"" : ""object"",
  ""id"" : ""urn:jsonschema:my:package:MyClass"",
  ""title"" : ""Lmy/package/MyClass;"",
  ""properties"" : {
    ""startDayOfWeek"" : {
      ""type"" : ""string""
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've done some digging in the Jackson Schema Module source code and figured out that what's happening is Jackson's using "".toString()"" as the default serialization method for enum types, but what I need it to do instead is create the line that looks like this based on <code>StartDayOfWeek.values()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>""enum"" : [ ""Monday"", ""Tuesday"", ""Wednesday"", ""Thursday"", ""Friday"", ""Saturday"", ""Sunday"" ]
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know how to do that?</p>

This list contains a <code>null</code> item, since i want the user to be allowed to make no choice.<br/>
Since I was playing with the converter property of the ComboBox, i wondered if I could use it to provide a nice representation for the no-choice case, for example ""[none]"" instead of an empty line.<br/>
But i've discovered that the toString(Object object) is never called for the null item. <br/>
Here follows the shortest code that reproduces the case. Version information included. <br/></p>

<pre><code>import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.ComboBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import javafx.util.StringConverter;

public class T05 extends Application {
@Override public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {

    System.out.println(System.getProperty(""java.runtime.version""));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty(""javafx.runtime.version""));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty(""os.version""));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty(""os.name""));        

    ComboBox c = new ComboBox();
    //c.setEditable(true);
    primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(c));
    primaryStage.show();

    c.getItems().add(""first"");
    c.getItems().add(null);

    c.setConverter(new StringConverter&lt;String&gt;(){
        @Override public String toString(String object) {

            System.out.print(""converting object: "");
            if (object==null) {
                System.out.println(""null"");
                return ""[none]"";
            }
            System.out.println(object.toString());
            return object.toString();
        }

        @Override public String fromString(String string) {
            throw new RuntimeException(""not required for non editable ComboBox"");
        }

    });

}

}
</code></pre>

<p>And here it's the output, as you can see the true branch of the <code>if (object==null)</code> statement is never called. Is it a bug or a feature, and is it yet possible to customize null representation?</p>

<p>i get another behavior, that is, clicking on the null item in the combo selection box, i get the method toString called, but the result is not presented in the selection box. </p>

<p>Having said that, here's the question: are there any role-based declarative authorization frameworks for rich browser-based JavaScript web apps?</p>

<p>Background: with browser-based JavaScript web apps (GWT, ExtJS, etc) there is generally no need for dynamic server-side view generation since the entire app can be downloaded as static files and all view transitions are made in the browser. Implementing role-based security therefore either requires dynamic GUI customization after the user logs in and the app loads, or dynamic generation of the app's files on the server-side after login, before anything is downloaded to the client (could be built and cached too). This SO question talks about these approaches: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1775695/how-to-use-ext-js-for-role-based-application"">How to use Ext JS for role based application</a></p>

<p>I can't manage to do synchronous producer, ie producer that waits for consumer ack. If you run the samples I've done here, you'll see that producer <em>instantaneously</em> sends all messages, then quits, with all ""true"" like ""ok"" results when calling <code>$stomp-&gt;send()</code>.
I still haven't found good examples, neither good documentation with a simple blocking sample.</p>

<p>What shall I do to make my producer blocking until the consumer sends its ack?</p>

<p>When I use <strong>JavasriptSerializer</strong> to serialize an array of arrays as follows :       </p>

<pre><code>string foo()
{
    int[][] JaggedArray = new int[5][];
    int i = 0;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 1, 10, 100 };
    i = i + 1;

    i = i + 1;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 3, 30, 300 };
    i = i + 1;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 4, 40, 400 };
    i = i + 1;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 5, 50, 500 };
    i = i + 1;
    JavaScriptSerializer js = new JavaScriptSerializer();
    string strJSON = js.Serialize(JaggedArray);
    return strJSON
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get something like this in response :</p>

<pre><code>{""d"":""[[1,10,100],[2,20,200],[3,30,300],[4,40,400],[5,50,500]]""}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>There are times when I want ASP.NET to consume the output of this function in order that it can dynamically generate Javascript into the header of the web page like this :</p>

<pre><code>HtmlGenericControl Include = new HtmlGenericControl(""script"");
Include.Attributes.Add(""type"", ""text/javascript"");
Include.InnerHtml = ""var myJSArr = "" + foo() + "";"" ;
Page.Header.Controls.Add(Include);
</code></pre>

<p>In order that I end up with the following JS within my page :</p>

<pre><code>var myJSArr = [[1,10,100],[2,20,200],[3,30,300],[4,40,400],[5,50,500]]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>What's the best way to adjust either the creation of the JSON or the processing of it at time of dynamic JS creation in order that I can easily append the array of arrays onto the string 'var myJSArr' ?</p>

<hr>

<p>In the hope of helping someone in future I'm going to edit this question in the light of the answers/comments provided to include some code here which proved to do what I wanted. Firstly foo needed to return an array not a string like this ...</p>

<pre><code>string foo()
{
    int[][] JaggedArray = new int[5][];
    int i = 0;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 1, 10, 100 };
    i = i + 1;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 2, 20, 200 };
    i = i + 1;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 3, 30, 300 };
    i = i + 1;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 4, 40, 400 };
    i = i + 1;
    JaggedArray[i] = new int[] { 5, 50, 500 };
    i = i + 1;

    return JaggedArray
}
</code></pre>

<p>This resulted in a JSON blob that looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>{""d"":[[100,101,102],[200,201,202],[300,301,302],[400,401,402],[500,501,502]]}
</code></pre>

<p>I was then able to use the following code to the dynamic build of the JS code. I'm not all sure that the following code is the best way to do it (it seems like a hell of a lot of code for something which shouldn't be terribly complex) but it does at least work</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, int[][]&gt; dd = js.Deserialize&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, int[][]&gt;&gt;(foo());
int[][] arrASRValues = dd[""d""];
List&lt;string&gt; lstASRValues = new List&lt;string&gt;(arrASRValues.Length);
foreach(int[] lstASRElement in arrASRValues)
{
    lstASRValues.Add(String.Format(""[{0},{1},{2}]"", lstASRElement[0], lstASRElement[1], lstASRElement[2]));
}
String strASRValues = String.Join("","", lstASRValues.ToArray());
strASRValues = ""val myJSArr = ["" + strASRValues + ""];"";
Include.InnerHtml = strASRValues;
Page.Header.Controls.Add(Include);

<p>To avoid this I can use SAML 2 based SSO to gain direct access to other-website.com by passing over EntityID and unique references from website.com database which correspond to other-website.com database to ensure authentication.</p>

<p>What I really don't understand is from the point that the User clicks hyperlink to other-website.com what I need to do to create and pass over the required information to other-website.com</p>

<p>I think that I have to create some form of encrypted XML document and then POST it via a form to the URL supplied by other-website.com - but I am not sure how to do this and can't find any sample / demo to help.</p>

<p>Hopefully that explains fully what I am trying to achieve!</p>

<p>I have a <code>private List&lt;String&gt; teamMemb;</code> and <code>private String teamLeader;</code> with their getter and setters</p>

<p>Now when I submit this form, I get <code>Select Team Leader: Validation Error: Value is not valid</code></p>

<p>Now, I cannot add the list in @postconstruct as I do not actually retrieve it from database. And the values of teamMemb are added using setter. So how should I solve this problem?</p>

<p>UPDATE : I Modified my code a bit and added</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p:commandButton value=""check"" ajax=""false"" action=""#{teamMaintainanceController.check}""&gt;&lt;/p:commandButton&gt; just above Add button 

&lt;p:ajax&gt;&lt;/p:ajax&gt; in selectOneMenu so as to fire the update
</code></pre>

<p>and my check id</p>

<pre><code>public void check(){
    System.out.println(teamMemb);
    System.out.println(teamLeader);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So after filling the details and selecting the items from menu, I click on Check button 
All it does is show the values in console, and surprisingly the teamMemb list is shown everytime and teamLeader is null</p>

    NSURL *loginURL = [[SPTAuth defaultInstance] loginURLForClientId:kClientId declaredRedirectURL:[NSURL URLWithString:kCallbackURL] scopes:@[@""login""]];

    // Opening a URL in Safari close to application launch may trigger an iOS bug, so we wait a bit before doing so.
    // [UIApplication performSelector:@selector(openURL:) withObject:loginURL afterDelay:0.1];

    NSLog(@""*** GOT THIS IN DEBUG CONSOLE ***"");

    // Ask SPTAuth if the URL given is a Spotify authentication callback
