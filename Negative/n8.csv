"4907024","1","4907163","","2011-02-05 13:12:06","","7","774","<p>When dealing with sizeable algebraic data types in Haskell, there is a particular recursive traversal not captured by folding over the data type. For instance, suppose I have a simple data type representing formulas in propositional logic, and a fold defined over it:</p>

<pre><code>type FAlgebra α φ =
 (φ, φ,                -- False, True
  α -&gt; φ,              -- Atom
  φ -&gt; φ,              -- Negation
  φ -&gt; φ -&gt; φ,         -- Conjunction
  φ -&gt; φ -&gt; φ,         -- Disjunction
  φ -&gt; φ -&gt; φ,         -- Implication
  φ -&gt; φ -&gt; φ)         -- Bi-implication

fold :: FAlgebra α φ -&gt; Form α -&gt; φ
fold (f,t,lit,not,con,dis,imp,iff) = fold' where
 fold' (Fls)     = f
 fold' (Tru)     = t
 fold' (Lit α)   = lit α
 fold' (Not φ)   = not (fold' φ)
 fold' (Con φ ψ) = con (fold' φ) (fold' ψ)
 fold' (Dis φ ψ) = dis (fold' φ) (fold' ψ)
 fold' (Imp φ ψ) = imp (fold' φ) (fold' ψ)
 fold' (Iff φ ψ) = iff (fold' φ) (fold' ψ)
</code></pre>

<p>This recursion scheme provides a succinct answer to recursions like evaluation or finding literals:</p>

<pre><code>eval :: (Ord α) =&gt; Map α Bool -&gt; Form α -&gt; Bool
eval v = fold (False, True, (fromJust . flip M.lookup v),
               not, (&amp;&amp;), (||), ((||) . not), (==))

literals :: (Ord α) =&gt; Form α -&gt; Set α
literals = fold (S.empty, S.empty, S.singleton, id,
                 S.union, S.union, S.union, S.union)
</code></pre>

<p>However, it doesn't fare so well when I wish to ""sweep"" the data type. In the following, simp is an auxiliary function defined by necessary pattern-matching:</p>

<pre><code>simplify :: Form α -&gt; Form α
simplify (Not φ)   = simp (Not (simplify φ))
simplify (Con φ ψ) = simp (Con (simplify φ) (simplify ψ))
simplify (Dis φ ψ) = simp (Dis (simplify φ) (simplify ψ))
simplify (Imp φ ψ) = simp (Imp (simplify φ) (simplify ψ))
simplify (Iff φ ψ) = simp (Imp (simplify φ) (simplify ψ))
simplify φ         = φ
</code></pre>

<p>Using a fold to define simplify, of course, generates incorrect results. For instance, the following is not equivalent: </p>

<pre><code>simplify = fold (Fls, Tru, Lit, (simp . Not), con Con, con Dis, con Imp, con Iff)
 where con f φ ψ = simp (f φ ψ)
</code></pre>

<p>What is the best solution to recursions like <em>simplify</em>? Should I define a generic traversal similar to the fold over the data type, or is there a standard recursion pattern for defining such functions?</p>

<p>If you need more information, just tell me what is needed. I have no idea why this is happening, so I'm not sure what kind of information I need to provide. The only way to get rid of a key hook besides unregistering it explicitly is if Windows times it out, as far as I know. All MyClassVar methods are inline to be as fast as possible, and Alt+Enter is handled from a separate thread. </p>

<p>My question now is, how can I add other elements to the frame layout? Only programmatically? I am asking because as of now I was only able to add other elements programmatically. Elements that i added in the xml layout didn't appear on screen.
Is it possible that they are just behind the surface view that i add to the frame layout? If so, would it be possible to bring them to the front?</p>

<pre><code>   def receive = _route()
   def lowerBound = 5
   def upperBound = 20
   def rampupRate = 0.1
   def partialFill = true
   def selectionCount = 1
   def instance() = Actor.actorOf[Processor]
</code></pre>

<p>And Processor is a class that processes the received message and replies with the result of the process. The app has been working normally and flawless on my local machine, however after deploying it on an EC2 micro instance (512m of memory - CentOS like OS) the OS (oom-killer) kills the process due to OutOfMemory (not JVM OOM) after 30 calls or so (regardless of the frequency of calls).</p>

<p>Profiling the application locally doesn't show any significant memory leaks, if there exist any at all. Due to some difficulties I could not perform proper profiling on the remote machine but monitoring ""top""s output, I observed something interesting which is the free memory available stays around 400mb after the app is initialized, afterwards it bounces between 380mb to 400mb which seems pretty natural (gc, etc). But the interesting part is that after receiving the 30th or so call, it suddenly goes from there to 5mb of free memory and boom, it's killed. The oom-killer log in /var/log/messages verifies that this has been done by the OS due to lack of memory/free swap.</p>

<p>Now this is not totally Akka-relevant but I finally decided I should seek some advice from you guys, after 3 days of hopeless wrestling. </p>

<p>Basically, I declare my object outside the loop.
Then I loop on an array of numeric values, which values are used to update the object property. 
Inside the loop, I store the current object state inside an external array.</p>

<p>The result is that instead of having an array containing a series of objects with different numeric values, I end up having the same numeric values in each object stored.</p>

<p>Here is the fiddle <strong><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/fAypL/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/fAypL/1/</a></strong></p>

    jQuery.each(object_container, function(index, value){

<p>My setup is like this:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseClass
{
    virtual short return_number_for_thing1(std::string thing1)=0; //note the pure virtual
    virtual short return_number_for_thing2(std::string thing2)=0;
    virtual short return_number_for_thing(std::string thing); //virtual is probably not necessary here, I can get rid of it if need be
}

short BaseClass::return_number_for_thing(std::string thing)
{ //pretend thing1 and thing2 are enum'ed somewhere
    if      (thing == thing1) return return_number_for_thing1(thing);
    else if (thing == thing2) return return_number_for_thing2(thing);
}

class DerivedClass1 : BaseClass
{
    short return_number_for_thing1(std::string thing1);
    short return_number_for_thing2(std::string thing2);
}

class DerivedClass2 : BaseClass
{
    short return_number_for_thing1(std::string thing1);
    short return_number_for_thing2(std::string thing2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, why can't I write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>short number_i_want = DerivedClass2::return_number_for_thing(thing);
</code></pre>

<p>I sort of understand that trying to call return_number_for_thing from a BaseClass pointer doesn't make sense, since it doesn't know whether to call the routines for DerivedClass1 or DerivedClass2, but if I give it the scope of DerivedClass2, shouldn't it be able to figure out what I want? For now, I create a blank instance of DerivedClass2 or DerivedClass1 when I need to, but it seems to me that I shouldn't have to do that.</p>

Since each question has a time limit, I've not provided a submit button; instead, the user can directly submit the answer by pressing the Enter key. After the enter key is pressed, the user is redirected to another URL which checks if the posted answer is correct, adds 10 points if the answer is correct and then updates the database with the user's points and then redirects the user to the trivia page where they have another question to answer. However, when a user enters the right answer and presses the enter key multiple times without letting the page reload, their answer is deemed as valid by the script and their points are added as any times as the answer was submitted. So, if I hit the enter key 40 times after typing in the right answer, it adds 400 points. I've tried preventing this by using:</p>

<pre><code>$(""form"").submit(function() {
    $(this).submit(function() {

I'm trying to understand if I could take ONE only open socket from the server A to the service B, just to gain performance and resources (on the first client connection on server A, the server will open the socket to B and maintain it open for message to flow bidirectionally).
Of course the problem is that without some kind of intervention, messages could be scrambled one over the other, resulting in a mess that service B can't understand.
I'm quite a newbie in socket programming, and I'm wondering if this is yet a ""solved"" problem, or just the wrong answer to the problem :)

<blockquote>

<p>So I can't even test my first program.
I found in a book the following command: </p>

<p>but it doesnt work either.</p>

<p>It usually just creates one branch, so for example it will create a 0 folder within a 0 folder within a 0 folder, but it will not trace back out and make the other folders.

<p>I extracted small parts of it and put it into a separate solution. Basically what I've got now, is a Account-Table and a AccountSync-Table. Both have an ID and a URL, while the ID is just a db-guid.</p>

<p>My classes are:</p>

<pre><code>public class HippoAccount
{
    public virtual Guid Id { get; set; }
    public virtual string Url { get; set; }
    public virtual HippoAccountSync Sync { get; set; }
}

public class HippoAccountSync
{
    public virtual Guid Id { get; set; }

    public virtual string Url { get; set; }
    public virtual HippoAccount Account { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I now load a object via it's guid:</p>

<pre><code>var account = session.Load&lt;HippoAccount&gt;(accountId);
Console.WriteLine(NHibernateUtil.IsPropertyInitialized(account, ""Sync""))
</code></pre>

<p>... it returns <code>false</code> and account itself is a proxy.</p>

<p>But when loading a list via the criteria API:</p>

<pre><code>var account = (HippoAccount)session
    .CreateCriteria(typeof (HippoAccount))
    .Add(Restrictions.Eq(""Id"", accountId))
    .List()[0];
</code></pre>

<p>... the property <code>Sync</code> gets initialized (firing a second select query), and the returned object is not a proxy.</p>

<p>Is that default behaviour? What am I getting wrong?</p>

<p>The mapping is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;class name=""HippoAccount"" table=""AllAccounts""&gt;
  &lt;id name=""Id"" type=""guid""&gt;
    &lt;generator class=""guid""/&gt;

<p>In UI for Employee data form, there is a combobox to allow user change the employee department.</p>

<p>So now I want to change this employee department to Marketing, it means:<br>
(1, 1, '2011-01-01')->(1, 2, '2011-01-01')</p>

<p>So logically, I should update entity EmployeeDepartment(1, 1, '2011-01-01').<br>
If I use following code:<br>
EmployeeDepartment.id2 = 2;<br>
then submitchanges, I will get error: can not change the key.</p>

<p>Then try another way: delete (1, 1, '2011-01-01') and then add (1, 2, '2011-01-01'):<br>
EmployeeDepartments.Remove( (1, 1, '2011-01-01'));<br>
EmployeeDepartments.Add( new (1, 2, '2011-01-01'));</p>

<p>then submit changes, In database, I have two records in EmployeeDepartment:<br>
(1, 1, '2011-01-01')<br>
(1, 2, '2011-01-01')  </p>

<p>not one (1, 2, '2011-01-01'). </p>

<p>how to resolve this issue?</p>

<p>All is working 100%, except, a file '\Fonts\glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff' was throwing a 404 error when using Chrome (The network tab when using F12).</p>

<p>I checked my solution, and the file IS there:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mOtN0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I googled away, and found that it was a mime type issue and Azure. I found a link that said that the fix was to add this to web.config.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;staticContent&gt;
  &lt;mimeMap fileExtension=""woff"" mimeType=""application/font-woff"" /&gt;
&lt;/staticContent&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I did that, and the 404 no longer displays. HOWEVER, my page takes an extra 1.56ms to load, because it seems it downloads that woff file every time I load the page - where all other static content seems to be cached on the server on each load. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4ViEz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>That was loading the homepage - and is the only file that gets loaded. The rest seems cached?</p>

<p>Loading another page, where other items are loaded, shows that this is the file that the cache doesn't seem interested in:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LmLzI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is there a way to get this file cached? I think maybe a mime type needs to be added to their server somewhere? I'm kind of new to caching and mime, and Azure. Hopefully there is a solution, as this file is nearly doubling my page load times on all pages on Azure. My other Cheap host did not have this issue.</p>

But this situation does not happened few month ago.</p>

<p>The Firebase library I downloaded from <a href=""https://developer.nest.com/documentation/cloud/firebase-client-libraries"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.nest.com/documentation/cloud/firebase-client-libraries</a> ,
so my firebase library version is 1.1.1.
Had anyone happen this kind of situation?</p>

<p>I had try to use <strong>authWithCustomToken</strong>(...) to replace the <strong>auth</strong>(...), but it not work.
How do I used this function to authentication in nest?</p>

<p>And I found that the firebase added SSL to their protocol, is it the reson that caused above situation?</p>

to create a *.crt or *.cer file, does anyone can help me?</p>

<p>/******************************* Update ***********************************/</p>

<p>The following are sample code as follow:</p>

<p>access_token I already get from nest via http request,</p>

<pre><code>String Access_Token_URL = ""https://api.home.nest.com/oauth2/access_token"";
URL u = new URL(Access_Token_URL);
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) u.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(true);
conn.setDoInput(true);
conn.setRequestMethod(""POST"");

String cmd = ""code=""+pincode+""&amp;client_id="" + Client_ID + ""&amp;client_secret=""+ Client_secret +""&amp;grant_type=authorization_code"";
DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(conn.getOutputStream());

wr.writeBytes(cmd); 
wr.flush();
wr.close(); // flush and close                  

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));

String line;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null){
      //do something
}
reader.close();
JSONObject stock_data = new JSONObject(line);
access_token = stock_data.getString(""access_token"");   //access_token=""c.W6o3HEpUe3a.........."";
</code></pre>

<p>and I use the access_token in auth() function,   </p>

<pre><code>String DataBase_URL = ""https://developer-api.nest.com"";
Firebase myDataBase = new Firebase(DataBase_URL);
myDataBase.auth(access_token, new Firebase.AuthListener(){

    @Override
    public void onAuthError(FirebaseError arg0) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        Log.i(TAG, ""AuthErro: "" + arg0.getMessage());
        //to do something...
    }

    @Override
    public void onAuthRevoked(FirebaseError arg0) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        Log.i(TAG, ""AuthRevoked: "" + arg0.getMessage());

        Log.i(TAG, ""AuthSuccess "" + arg0.toString());
        //to do something...
    }

<p>It spends more than 5 minutes to got the <strong>AuthSuccess</strong> message, is the behavior correct?
If not, how should I modify my code?</p>

<p>I want to show the user a list of ""all"" projects (the ones the user already made an offer for) and ""new projects"" (the ones the user has NOT made an offer for already).</p>

<p>""All"" is easy. But I struggle with the ""new"" list. </p>

<p>I need to have a query that iterates through all projects and only returns the projects that have NO entry in the offers table of the user I want to display the list for (but the table could have other offers or NO OFFERS).</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense to somebody. I was training several hours to get it right …</p>

<p>As a side note: The view so far left joins both tables and returns for every project as many rows as there are offers (the user I want to match the query to is generated at runtime).</p>

<p>Table projects:
project_id
project_owner_id
some other field</p>

<p>Table offers:
offer_id
project_id
offer_maker_id
some other fields</p>

<p>So, in the projects table, there, of course, is no id from the guy making the offer. How can I select now any project where a specific user has not many any offer for?</p>

<p>An inner join does not do the trick because then I get far too many rows back as I get every offer of every project back where the user_id is not the user in question.</p>

    Frame(vector&lt;Region&gt; regions_)
        : regions(regions_){}
    const vector&lt;Region&gt; regions;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now, at a different part in my code I want to create a <code>vector&lt;Frame&gt;</code> and created the following <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;Frame&gt; shot;
Frame currentFrame = generateRandomFrame();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
    shot.push_back(currentFrame);
    currentFrame = generateNextFrame(currentFrame); // this line gives the error
}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>generateNextFrame</code>has the following signature: 
<code>Frame FrameGenerator::generateNextFrame(Frame previousFrame)</code></p>

<p>Now, this code won't compile and give me the following error:</p>

<pre><code>copy assignment operator of 'Frame' is implicitly 
deleted because field 'regions' has no copy assignment 
operator const vector&lt;Region&gt; regions;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I don't fully understand this error message. I strongly assume that it's related to the fact that <code>currentFrame</code> is allocated on the <em>stack</em> and not on the <em>heap</em>, and thus I can't just reassign the variable. Being a novice to C++ however, I am not familiar with how to handle these kinds of situations. Should I use pointers here instead and try to allocate <code>currentFrame</code> on the heap? </p>

<p>To be clear, my goal is to generate a series of <code>frames</code> (that depend on some previous frame). Can anyone point me into the right direction here?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Thanks a lot for all the hints in the comments, I now understand that the issue comes from the fact that I declare <code>regions</code> as <code>const</code>. I rewrote the code to use pointers instead of heap variables, it now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;Frame&gt; shot;
Frame currentFrame = generateRandomFrame();
Frame *currentFramePtr = &amp;currentFrame; // the first frame in the shot is random
for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
    shot.push_back(*currentFramePtr);
    Frame tmpFrame = generateNextFrame(*currentFramePtr);
    currentFramePtr = &amp;tmpFrame; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code does compile now, however it still doesn't do what I want. According to my understanding it should now work, because I am storing the <code>currentFrame</code> in a pointer, so I can easily override it with new objects that I create. But it seems that there still is a bug, the frame generation doesn't work as expected (that is any new frame is generated with 0 regions while the number of regions should be identical to the previous frame). Can anyone see what's wrong with this updated version of my code?</p>

<p>Now the arcball related math:</p>

<pre><code>QVector3D GLWidget::getArcBallVector(int x, int y)
{
   QVector3D pt = QVector3D(2.0 * x / GLWidget::width() - 1.0, 2.0 * y / GLWidget::height() - 1.0 , 0);
   pt.setY(pt.y() * -1);

   // compute z-coordinates

   float xySquared = pt.x() * pt.x() + pt.y() * pt.y();

   if(xySquared &lt;= 1.0)

       pt.setZ(std::sqrt(1.0 - xySquared));
   else
       pt.normalize();

   return pt;

}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the part where I render everything:</p>

<p>void GLWidget::paintGL()
{
    QMatrix4x4 modelview;</p>

<pre><code>QPainter painter;
painter.begin(this);

painter.beginNativePainting();

glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

glFrontFace(GL_CW);
glCullFace(GL_FRONT);
glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);


 modelview.perspective(90.0f, 4.0f / 3.0f, 0.1f, 3000.0f);

modelview.lookAt(QVector3D(eyeX,eyeY,eyeZ), QVector3D(0,0,0), QVector3D(0,1,0));


// New Trackball code

modelview = rotationMat * modelview;

modelview.scale(1 - scrollDelta / 10);
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong? 
Is my approach unsound? </p>

<p><em>update</em> So I fixed some of the mouse handling. Now my issue is that cube is rotating around the surface of sphere, rather than the camera. Is this because I am using the lookat command? </p>

<p>Also, the cube is being occluded by background color as I turn it. Is this a projection problem? </p>

<p>start and begin nodes are same always. In this case that is (1,4).</p>

<p>Than, we would like to store those outputs to in a suitable data structure (maybe a tree) in order to reorder and reproduce new paths from current outputs (between (1,4)) without looking to the graph again. For instance,suppose that now we want to list all possible paths between (2,4) but not from the graph again, just from the list that we obtain from (1,4). which will be as;</p>

<p><strong>Gson streaming processing is fast, but difficult to code, 
because you need to handle each and every detail of processing JSON data.</strong></p>

<p>I have used a communication object for client &amp; server communication. The communication structure is  like</p>

<pre><code>class CommunicationObject
{
//Other variables
IsBean isBean; //Interface of hibernate entity bean
//Getter &amp; setter methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here isBean as a generic while accessing any single entity bean. there are no of cases</p>

<pre><code>-&gt;Do login logic then isBean has a user object
-&gt;Get organization then isBean has a Organization object.
...
etc
</code></pre>

<p>Code to process request method:</p>

<pre><code>public String processFacadeActionTest(String requestJson) { 
        Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().registerTypeAdapter(IsBean.class, new InterfaceAdapter&lt;IsBean&gt;())
                .create();
        CommunicationObject requestObj=null;
        try{

        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(outputStream);
        writeJsonStream(out, obj);
        return outputStream.toString();
    }

<p>streaming using gson</p>

<pre><code>private void writeJsonStream(OutputStream out,CommunicationObject communicationObject) throws IOException {
                JsonWriter writer = new JsonWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(out, ""UTF-8""));
                writer.setIndent(""  "");
                writer.beginArray();
                Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().registerTypeAdapter(IsBean.class, new InterfaceAdapter&lt;IsBean&gt;())

<p>I am stuck on <strong>gson.toJson(communicationObject, CommunicationObject.class, writer)</strong>
So how can I do streaming on such request object? or any other alternative available?

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I have isolated the issue being down to my vertex arrays - in particular the normals.</p>

<p>I swapped the values in the frame array with the ones in my southernHemisphere array, and bingo - the object appears in both the scene, and the shadow map!</p>

<p>After some adjustment of values, it appears that it will only work if the direction of the normals are the same as the direction of each vector itself.</p>

<p>What baffles me is that in my shadow map shader, I don't even access the normals so why do they have any effect on the rendering at all??</p>

<p>Here is my vertex shader for my shadow map:</p>

<pre><code>attribute vec4 Position;
uniform mat4 Projection;
uniform mat4 Modelview;
uniform mat4 Light;
varying vec4 TexCoord;

void main()
{
  TexCoord =  Projection * Light * Modelview * Position;
  gl_Position =  Projection * Light * Modelview  * Position;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and fragment:</p>

<pre><code>precision mediump float;
varying vec4 TexCoord;

void main()
{
  /* Generate shadow map - write fragment depth. */
  float value = 10.0 - TexCoord.z;
  float v = floor(value);
  float f = value - v;
  float vn = v * 0.1;
  gl_FragColor = vec4(vn, f, 0.0, 1.0);
}

<p>One more thing is that I'd like, when the user clicks on the item in the autocomplete, to select only the <code>Name</code> and not <code>Name</code> and <code>Position</code>.</p>

<p>I understand that if the program is moving a lot of data to/from the graphics hardware, then it would probably be better to use floats as doubles would require twice the bandwidth.

If there is invalid data in the form I want to prevent that the user is able to select a new item from the dataTable. A validation already error is shown on the details side and the form is not updated when a validation error is existing (seems to be a bulit-in behaviour).
Unfortunately I wasn't able to prevent that the user can select another row in the dataTable. I tried:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p:dataTable ...&gt;               
    &lt;p:ajax event=""rowSelect"" update=""someId"" /&gt;
    &lt;p:ajax event=""rowUnselect"" update=""someId"" oncomplete=""if (args &amp;amp;&amp;amp; args.validationFailed) return false;"" process="":detialsFormId"" /&gt;
    ...
&lt;/p:dataTable&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't work. As I know only in <code>oncomplete</code> there is the <code>args</code> variable available. I think in both <code>rowSelect</code> and <code>rowUnselect</code> it is too late.
Maybe there is another approach? Thought about a remote command which sets the t-1 selection when validation failed. But maybe there's another fancier solution?</p>

<p>I've been comparing the web.config from the client to one that works in dev and they are pretty much identical except for connection strings. I thought there might have been some Crystal Reports configuration we messed up, so we reinstalled it completely and we still get the same error.
I'm not sure where to look next, and I'm sort of waiting to hear how it looks after they restart the server so I'm asking this to see if anyone has seen something similar, where the <code>OnLoad</code> events don't fire, but <code>OnUnload</code> does. It just seems so weird that it would be trying to load something when it never loaded it in the first place, and I have no idea why it doesn't load anyway.</p>

<p>Edit: Our CrystalReport class inherits from <code>MvcContainer(Of Controllers.OnDemandReportController)</code>, which inherits from <code>DotNetNuke.Entities.Modules.PortalModuleBase</code></p>

<p>The OnLoad handler of the CrystalReport never fires, so it never calls the base classes OnLoad, so the controller for the CrystalReport class is <code>Nothing</code>, and blows up.</p>

<p>For example, PHP automatically parses the content into $_POST, which seems to indicate that x-www-form-urlencoded is expected by the server. On the other hand, I could use Ajax to send a JSON object in the HTTP request content and set the Content-Type to application/json.

I'm looking at the possibility of doing an HTML5/CS/JS app using Ember.js, perhaps with some connection to a RAils API for data update; the app would be converted to native Android/iOS mobile apps using a tool such as PhoneGap, and hopefully some sort of UI framework such as Sencha touch, or Ionic, etc  that allows for a good UX. </p>

<p>It does not work. The column remains empty after the complete list is iterated because the actual property is <code>discountStartDate</code> in the corresponding model that the <code>&lt;s:property&gt;</code> tag is missing.</p>

<p>Additional information:</p>

<p>Formatting of dates is done internally by using a <a href=""http://pastebin.com/hFvRufwM"" rel=""nofollow"">custom converter</a> but I want to display dates in this <code>dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss</code> format (which is done by the converter) which is not accepted by the jQuery date-time picker that I'm using.</p>

<p>Therefore the dates listed in the HTML table in the specified format can not be edited unless they are given the format that is accepted by the date-time picker (<code>MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss</code>) at the time of editing of rows.</p>

<p><sub>Please don't just say, <em>use another date-time picker that can accept the format <code>dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss</code></em>. This need can arise at a different place too.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>Actually I need the value of <code>formattedStartDate</code> in <code>&lt;s:param&gt;</code> inside <code>&lt;s:url&gt;</code> but I have not mentioned that for the sake of simplicity.

The Buildr website automatically generates a table of contents for each page based on the headers in the <code>textile</code> format files.</p>

<p>For example, you write a page using textile marking out the headings like so . . </p>

<pre><code>h2(#why).  Why are we doing this?

BLah blah balh etc ..


h2(#something). Some other header

BLah blah balh etc ..

<p>Currently, my MathJax configuration is to take TeX input and spit out HTML-CSS output (unfortunately MathML doesn't work too well in Chrome). I also have a jQuery function that takes the html of any <code>.latex</code> class and dumps it into the <code>title</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The following HTML...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""latex""&gt;\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with the following script...</p>

<pre><code>/* jQuery */
$('.latex').attr('title', function() {
    return $(this).html();
})
</code></pre>

<p>will output...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""latex"" title=""\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""MathJax_Display""&gt;a2+b2=c2&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- becomes prettyprint in browser --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the contents of <code>div.MathJax_Display</code> will be styled with a whole slew of spans and classes and styles. I'm just not going to type all that here. Anyway, after the math is rendered, users can hover over <code>div.latex</code> to see the TeX commands in a tooltip.</p>

<p>Now, what I want to do is define a new macro in my MJ configuration that will add a <code>title</code> attribute to a newly-created span of HTML-CSS output, given a bit of TeX input. Let's call that macro <code>\title[2]</code>. Here's what I want to be able to input:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""latex""&gt;\[ a^2 + b^2 = \title{c}{'hypotenuse'}^2 \]&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's what I want it to output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""latex"" title=""\[ a^2 + b^2 = \title{c}{'hypotenuse'}^2 \]""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""MathJax_Display""&gt;a2+b2=&lt;span title=""hypotenuse""&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- prettyprint --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If this happens, users who hover over the <code>c</code> in the math will get a tooltip that says ""hypotenuse"", but hover over any other area of the math and get the original input.</p>

<p>Here's my thinking for the algorithm:</p>

<pre>//pseudo-code: 
given the TeX input '\title{mathstr}{titlestr}':
  var thespan = document.createElement('span');
  $(thespan).attr('title', titlestr).html(mathstr);
  somehow put this into the MJ output at the right place

<p>Currently I'm looking into a way to parse this with json4s, iterating over the ""fields"" array, to be able to change the property ""value"" of the different objects in there. So far I've tried a few json libs and ended up with <a href=""http://json4s.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">json4s</a>. </p>

<p>Json4s allows me to parse the json into a JObject, which I can try extract the ""fields"" array 
from. </p>



<pre><code>    import org.json4s._
    import org.json4s.native.JsonMethods._

    // parse to JObject
    val data = parse(json)

    // extract the fields into a map
    val fields = data \ ""signatories"" \ ""fields""

    // parse back to JSON
    println(compact(render(fields)))
</code></pre>

<p>I've managed to extract a Map like this, and rendered it back to JSON again. What I can't figure out though is, how to loop through these fields and change the property ""value"" in them? </p>

<p>I've read the json4s documentation but I'm very new to both Scala and it's syntax so I'm having a difficult time. </p>

<p>The question becomes, how do I iterate over a parsed JSON result, to change the property ""value""? </p>

<p>Here's the flow I want to achieve.</p>

<ol>
<li>Parse JSON into iterable object</li>
<li>Loop through and look for certain ""names"" and change their value, for example fstname, from John to some other name.</li>
<li>Parse it back to JSON, so I can send the new JSON with the updated values back.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know if this is the best way to do this at all, I'd really appreciate input, maybe there's an easier way to do this.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,

<p>Obviously this would be overkill yet strictly speaking from a whim and wonderment would looping these methods with our password and salts and then using our return saying <code>md5</code> being our last algorithm to be ran as the store. How long would it be to crack the said password? As ive read in some documentation  <code>with a password 8 or less characters in length it takes only 6 hours to crack</code> so in reference if our stipulations and regulations to a password was</p>

<p>One uppercase letter
Two numbers
And no less than 10 characters in length</p>

<p>Then loop our password in the hash_algs essentially our password could nearly be unbreakable though I shouldn't use that since everything these days is able to be cracked. </p>

<p>So my concerns are is this feasible
Will it have a heavy page load
Regulations to passwords strength stronger like this
Is it truly overkill or is it like fort knox security? </p>

Doing so has helped to improve the structure of my content, as it forces me to think about meaningful organization. I understand that modern screenreaders make it easy to tab through the headers (h1, h2, ...) on a page.</p>

<p>In order to improve the outline (to prevent <em>untitled</em> sections) I've started to use <a href=""http://html5boilerplate.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">H5BP</a>'s <code>.visuallyhidden</code> <a href=""https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/css/main.css"" rel=""nofollow"">class</a> to add extra headers to otherwise <em>untitled</em> sections for the purpose of assistive text. Does this improve semantics? Is this actually useful for screenreader users? Is it a hindrance in any way? For example:</p>

<p>First of all, the website is multilanguage. I've created a language switcher, i pass the ""lang"" parameter as GET value in the url.</p>

<p>Then i've followed the wiki at this url: </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/294/seo-conform-multilingual-urls-language-selector-widget-i18n/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/294/seo-conform-multilingual-urls-language-selector-widget-i18n/</a></p>

<p>For the step 5 i've use the following code:</p>

<pre><code> 'urlManager' =&gt; array(

        'urlFormat' =&gt; 'path',

<pre><code>&lt;Files .htaccess&gt;
  order allow,deny
  deny from all

</code></pre>

<p>I've changed nothing.</p>

<p>Now, i've tried different rules for urlManager and tried to add other rules to htacces, without success.</p>

<p>My problem is that, some of page break with a 404 error, same thing for resources such as image or script. If i check the resources requested url from element inspector, i see that the requested url is rewrite as for the url of the site (is that correct behavior?)
I've also tried to put the entire project under a root subfolder, to create a test enviroment different from production, the result is worse, due to the subfolder.
In addition if i click on home link, the system redirect me to www.mysite.com/lang/en</p>

<p>In addition i've added a behavior that retrieve language based on ip or set statically one, so at the end of request processing, i always have a language code to put as get parameter.</p>

<p>(The GET language url parameter is called ""lang"")</p>

<p>What i need is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if someone visit the main url - www.mysite.com - i need to add the language in url, so i can have different url based on language in this manner: www.mysite.com/it/ , www.mysite.com/en/ etc etc.</p></li>
<li><p>same as above for the url create like this Yii::app()->createUrl('')</p></li>
<li><p>if someone visit www.mysite.com/index.php?r=site/index same as above and remove index.php</p></li>
<li><p>remove index.php and site in all situation</p></li>
<li><p>any kind of url always end with / character (also to avoid duplicate content, for this i've added 'urlSuffix' => ""/"")</p></li>
<li><p>for the other controller i need to delete view action (but mantaining the other) - and when is present made ""id"" as part of url in this way:</p>

<p>[www.mysite.com/controller/action/id/1?here-other-get-params]  OR </p>

<p>[www.mysite.com/controller/id/1?other-params] -> when the action is view</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please, can someone provide the step by step procedure of what i've to do?
Thank you </p>

This migration is supposed to happen once a day, or when the backend users press a button in the backend.</p>

<p>I am aware that Umbraco offers this in the Courier package, but apparently it doesn't work well enough for this case.</p>

<p>A few more details:</p>

<p>The development and live site both reside on the same server and so do their databases. The data will simply need to be transferred from one folder to another and the same with the tables in the database.</p>

<p>As I can see there are two methods of going about this.</p>

<p>1) You do a full migration, where you basically do a teardown of the live database and update it to the new version. You then copy over all the files you need as well.</p>

<p>2) You create a package containing the document types and so on you have changed on your developer site and load that package on the live site.</p>

<p>The problem with number 1 is that it seems you have to republish the entire site when you have done the transfer. As far as I have understood you can do this with a webservice, but I would prefer it if I could use a console app instead.</p>

<p>My question is then:</p>

<p>Is there a way to create packages programmatically and load them in the same way or what would be the best way to achieve this migration programmatically? </p>

<p>Any suggestions would be much appreciated as I am kind of at a loss for a way to do this :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I ended up actually doing a complete mirroring in the sense that I used Robocopy to transfer all the files that had been changed in the folders, and then I did a backup of the development site with a SQL command, and then I restored it on the live database using the RESTORE SQL command.</p>

<p>A few settings needed to be done in the SQL commands, but it runs smoothly and a complete transfer takes down to 10 seconds depending on the number of files that have been changed.</p>

<p>One last thing. If you want the changes to be visible you need Umbraco to be reloaded. This you can do by modifying the web.config file, either manually or by setting it's LastWriteTime programmatically.</p>

<p>My basic problem is that I have several different libraries that are all using the threadpool in an uncoordinated way, and running out of threads is a possibility.  I was hoping there was some way I could partition the ThreadPool up so I could give a certain class 1 thread, another 20 threads, another 5 threads, and so on.</p>

<p>I know I could write my own ThreadPool implementation.  I don't want to do that, because I'm lazy.  So, is there a simple solution already out there?</p>

My project contains one main class with three important functions.  The workflow looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// myclass.h
#include &lt;QNetworkAccessManager&gt;
class MyClass
{
    void function1();
    void function2();
    void function3();
    QNetworkAccessManager manager; // this is the object used to make network requests
}

// myclass.cpp
#include ""myclass.h""
MyClass::function1()
{
    // this function should be called to start the chain of events

    // set up the first request
    manager.get(""www.myserver.com"");
}

MyClass::function2()
{
    // this function is called with the response of the request made in function1

    // process the results of the first request
    // set up the second request
    manager.get(""www.yourserver.com"");
}

MyClass::function3()
{
    // this function is called with the results of the second request

    // process the results of the second request
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've left out most of the nitty gritty details for clarity, but the code above is a good illustration of how the class is organized.  There is one function within the class that should be called to start the process, and the other functions are called when the network requests finish so that the results of those requests can be processed.</p>

<p>I would like to test each function individually so that I can throw in a lot of different responses and different error situations, to make sure that my code reacts properly in each situation.  The problem is that I don't need or want my functions to actually make any internet requests during these tests.  I've searched online, but haven't found any really good solutions.  Here are the options that I've found:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Linker Tricks</p>

<ul>
<li>The idea here is to create a mock class that is also named QNetworkAccessReply, with a dummy <code>get</code> function that doesn't actually make any network requests.  Then during compile time I link my code to this mock class instead of the one that ships with Qt.</li>
<li>This idea seems to be the cleanest that I've found as far as not needing to modi my class, but I haven't been able to figure out how to actually pull this off in practice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Preprocessor Directives</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This idea involves creating a mock object, let's say <code>QNetworkAccessManager_Mock</code>, and defining a macro in one of my test files, something like: <code>#define TESTCASE</code>.  Then within the code that I am trying the test, I would replace an instance of <code>QNetworkAccessManager manager;</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef TESTCASE
    QNetworkAccessManager_Mock manager;
#else
    QNetworkAccessManager manager;
#endif
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This option is relatively easy to implement in small projects, but can get unruly in larger projects where your code would have to be riddled with <code>#ifdef</code> sections.  I don't like the level of modification to my original code that this option involves</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Edit my source files with a script</p>

<ul>
<li>I could create a simple script that runs through my source files to replace each instance of <code>QNetworkAccessManager</code> with a mock class instead.</li>
<li>This option allows me to leave my source code untouched, and I don't have to mess with linking properly at compile time, but it seems like a lot of extra overhead that shouldn't be needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Modify the destination url for each request</p>

<ul>
<li>I could choose a url for a local server that I know doesn't exist, such as <code>localhost:9000</code>.  In this case, each network request would fail in a predictable way, but it seems like too much of a hack just to get it to work.</li>
<li>Alternatively, my unit tests could spin up a local server from which I could return some canned responses.  This seems to me like too much overhead just to check how each individual function responds, and it still doesn't let me check how my class responds to errors having to deal with network failures.</li>
<li>In either case, I would still need a way to modify the url, either using preprocessor directives, bringing me back to the issues with #2 and #3.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Just don't write tests.</p>

<ul>
<li>This option defeats the whole purpose</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>There are plenty of examples that exist for mocking dependencies <strong>if I was the one that wrote the dependent classes</strong>.  There doesn't seem to be any clean and easy solutions, however, for mocking dependent classes that exist within other libraries.  Are the solutions that I outlined above really my only options, or have I overlooked something?  What would you recommend as my best choice?</p>

Instead it just adds it before the binary data and pushes the old data further onto the line. I want the data completely overwritten.</p>

<p>The <code>CarHashFile</code> is an outside class that creates a binary file full of the following contents when create file is invoked: <code>""Free, ""</code> <code>1900</code> <code>"", Black, $""</code> <code>0.00f</code>.
Everything enclosed in quotes was added as a string, 1900 as an int, and 0.00f as a float obviously. I added all of these through write, so I'm pretty sure it's an actual binary file, I just don't know why it only chooses to write over the first line. I know the file size is correct because if I set <code>seekp = 26</code> it will print at the beginning of the second line and push it down. <code>space</code> was created to easily add the "", "" combo to the file, there is also a <code>char dol[1] = '$'</code> array for simplicity and a <code>char nl[1] = '\n'</code> that lets me add a new line to the binary file (just tried removing that binary add and it forced everything onto one row, so afaik, its needed).</p>

<p>EDIT: Ok so, it was erasing the line all along, it just wasn't putting in a new line (kind of embarrassing). But now I can't figure out how to insert a newline into the file. I tried writing it the way I originally did with <code>char nl[1] = { '\n' }</code>. That worked when I first created the file, but won't afterwards. Are there any other ways to add lines? I also tried <code>in &lt;&lt; endl</code> and got nothing.</p>

<p>Am I doing the whole thing wrong (thou shall not derive from STL) or is there something I could do to keep the compiler happy ? (appart from stop using -Weffc++ :)</p>

<p><em>edit</em>: the derived class do not touch the vector-manipulation algorithms, but merely add some information such as ""element width/height"" for a vector of images. As an example, you could think of </p>

<pre><code>class PhotoAlbum: public std::vector&lt;Photo&gt; {

<p>where you think of a photo album primarily as a collection of pictures with some meta-data (title and time) and album-specific features such as rendering a thumbnail of some Photo onto a surface to make the album cover. So imho, the photo album IS-A collection of <code>Photo</code>, more than it HAS-A such collection.</p>

<p>I fail to see any benefit I'd gain of having <code>getPhotoVector()</code> method in a <code>PhotoAlbum</code> that would have an extra ""collection"" field.</p>

<p>I decided to use the Scriptlet functionality to give this a shot. Note that our reports are all master-detail in nature, in that there is a master report and a subreport.</p>

<p>At first, I attached the scriptlet to the master report, and tried to find a way to collect all of the product numbers in the detail report, then pass that value back to the master report. I can't figure out how to get the detail information back to the master report, as it appears that you can only pass default variables from the subreport back to the master (eg PAGE_NUMBER, COLUMN_NUMBER, PAGE_COUNT, COLUMN_COUNT).</p>

<p>So then I tried attaching the Scriptlet to the detail report. Well, the detail report doesn't know what page the master is on, so I started passing the master's page_number into a variable in the detail report. That worked great, except that sometimes the detail can overflow to the point that page numbers from the master are skipped. In other words, if a subreport returns more than two pages worth of data, you are going to miss a page number when the subreport is called the next time.</p>

<p>So how to do this? </p>

<p>I have a very simple jquery mobile app.
The app has a header, content and footer.
The footer is being generated dynamically on the 'pagecreate' event because it is always the same and I don't want to have its HTML in every page.</p>

<p>So I do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).delegate('[data-role=""page""]', 'pagecreate', function (e) {
DrawHeader($(this));
DrawFooter($(this));
SetFooterEvents($(this));
SetActiveFooter($(this));
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>DrawHeader() and DrawFooter() simply prepent the header div to the page and append the footer div.
SetFooterEvents() sets the onclick events of the footer navbar buttons and SetActiveFooter() is SUPPOSED to set the ui-btn-active to the current active footer link.
To do this, I've added the data-active-footer attribute to the page div and the data-name attribute to the navbar  elements. I'm searching for the current  element according to the data-active-footer in the page and apply the ui-btn-active class.</p>

<pre><code>function SetActiveFooter(page) {
page.children('div[data-role=""footer""]')
    .find('a[data-name=""' + page
        .attr(""data-active-footer"") + '""]').addClass(""ui-btn-active"");}
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now, say I've changed to a page and the navbar  is lit (it has successfully recieved the ui-btn-active class), and I'm clicking on the previous page, the lit item in the navbar doesnt change back! 
<br/>If i click on the the page again (ie: changed to second page [corrent  lit], changed back to first page [second page  is still lit], then clicked on first page again) it does light the navbar button.</p>

<p>What I found out was that jqm also changed the navbar of the previous page when I'm changing the navbar of the current page in the 'pagecreate' event.
I've tried to overwrite this behaviour using the 'pageshow' event, that is, trying to apply the ui-btn-active class to the current  element in the navbar but the problem is that $(this) and e.currentTarget objects in the 'pageshow' event DO NOT CONTAIN THE FOOTER ELEMENT!!!</p>

<pre><code>$("".ui-page"").live('pageshow', function (e) {
alert($(this).children('div').length); // returns 2!
alert($(this).children('div[data-role=""footer""]').length); //returns 0

alert($(e.currentTarget).children('div').length); // returns 2!
alert($(e.currentTarget).children('div[data-role=""footer""]').length); //returns 0});
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?!</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If I don't try to use animation in any of the sorting events it's fine and the tiles snap into the spots fine, but I'd really like to animate this (much like an iPhone icon rearrange). I know this has something to do with the ui.placeholder and ui.helper elements and one of the change/sort/etc events, but I can't seem to quite get it working. </p>

<p>Here's where I am, which works in that once I move to a new spot the vacated space animates away (rather than snapping), but I can't seem to simultaneously animate the new space out to show and my grid essentially collapses by one tile.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Here's a simple fiddle with my basic html list layout and the behaviour currently the best I can make it:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/RMVzj/4/"" rel=""nofollow"">-> jQuery sortable grid</a></strong></p>

<p>The only thing I want is for the non-selected blocks to animate to their new positions, not snap. It's odd as the authors recognized the need for this option with the item you are dragging (revert speed option in init), but not the rest. I tried using lots of combinations of show/hide animations on the ui.helper/ui.placeholder elements with varying degrees of success. My issue is not really understanding when and where these objects are so the animations have been dodgy at best so far.</p>

<p>I'm using Django 1.6 with GeoDjango and Postgresql+PostGIS backend.
I want to use LineStringField to save some routes.
But I can't find any documentation about how to do it. I have model, have LineStringField attribute - but what to do next?</p>

I also tried to google some examples, but it wasn't successful.
Can you please point me where to search for it?
And also I'll highly appreciate some examples of code - like creating object of model with LineStringField, saving it to DB and then getting points from it (to display on the map).</p>

<p>Like I said, the error 77 i couldn't debug because nsight is not working. I've fixed the error now, converted it into an array, now i just need to understand how the multiplication should work</p>

<p>My problem right now is that if I try to compute a matrix of size larger than 50, it doesn't compute them anymore, otherwise, if smaller it works just fine</p>

<pre><code>Edit
</code></pre>

<p>I've further edited it some more and I've managed to run 2000x2000 matrices in total times below 2 seconds. And by total time I mean that with the copying of the memory back and forth.
However, when comparing with the CPU I get something like 1900 differences between the CPU multiplication and the GPU one.</p>

<p>From doing some debugging I've noticed that it does so at the first element of a row...</p>

How to find the outline of a set of tiles? Let's assume we have three tiles, at the x/y coordinates A[20,20], B[20,30] and C[30,30] (this will make a simple L-shape).
Those points represent the centers of the tiles.
Each tile has 4 vertexes: TL (top left), TR, BL (bottom left) and BR.
Together, the 3 tiles have 8 unique (non-overlapping) vertexes.</p>

<p>We want the red line (path), defined by green dots (vertexes):
<a href=""http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/2469/lshapetiles.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/2469/lshapetiles.png</a></p>

<p><strong>Needed solution</strong> The output of the algorithm should be a path that forms the outline shape of the tiles, consisting out of these vertexes - in this order:
A TL, A TR, A BR, C TR, C BR, C BL, B BL, B TL (and optional, A TL again, to close).
See the red line.</p>

<p><strong>Possible solution(s)</strong>
One option is to iterate over all the tiles, and for each tile check:
+ does it have a neighbor above? If not, at TL and TR to path
+ does it have a neighbor on the right? If not, at TR and BR to path
+ does it have a neighbor underneath? If not, at BL and BR to path
+ does it have a neighbor on the left? If not, at TL and BL to path</p>

<p>If you only add the found vertexes to the path if they're not added already yet, you've succesfully collected the unique vertexes for the path.
However, they might be in the wrong order. This is a (the) problem.</p>

<p>Does someone know of a good solution (algorithm) for this?</p>

I have a question: in RTOS concept, we have ""context switch"" theory. 
From what I know, context switch is to describe that when some task is running and the other task has a higher priority, the higher priority task will run and the current task will be saved its state and continue to start after the higher task finish. To do this concept, I think the higher priority task will run in the interrupt functions since the interrupt functions have higher priority than other instruction, am I right?. If i am right, so i do not need to write code to save the current task's state, since as i know that after interrupt, the program will return to where it is interrupted. If I am wrong, how can I save the current task 's state? Is it necessary to write assembly code to do that since I see halogen generate an assembly code file to do this for FreeRTOS?</p>

<p>This would select all of the words where 'a' does not occur in the word. This I can get to work perfectly. The problem is if I want to further restrict the results to not include 'b' anywhere in the word. I am picturing something like this.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT word FROM table WHERE word NOT IN ('%a%', '%b%', '%z%');

<p>which this obviously does not work, but this is kinda the idea. 
And just adding an AND clause is not really an option unless that is the only way to perform this. So this code is not an option.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT word FROM table WHERE word NOT LIKE '%a%' AND NOT LIKE '%b%';

<p>If this is the only option then I will have to work with that, but I was hoping for something else. Thanks in advance for the help!</p>

<p>I fixed the problem by moving the assemblies to a subfolder under program files and re-registering (regasm) the COM assembly, then deleting the files from their existing location under the root drive. Although this works now, it is not a long term fix. </p>

    var link = links[i];
    var newlist = document.createElement( 'a' );
    newlist.href = item.php?action=activate&amp;amp;act_item_id=000029
    var the_image = document.createElement('img');
    the_image.src = '../images/image1.gif';

<pre><code>wrapper.java.initmemory=5000
wrapper.java.maxmemory=5000
</code></pre>

<p>Now coming to the question- I am trying to write a cypher query which traverses graph and calculates allocation amount. Here is a snapshot of the structure of the graph. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/j5EVr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Basically I have a department as a starting point which has certain amount and then it is allocated out to certain Product which in turn allocates out to other Products, so on. It can be n level deep allocation. Now I need to calculate amount for all the products.</p>

<p>The cypher query that I am using is as below:</p>

<pre><code>MATCH (f:financial) WHERE f.amount &lt;&gt; 0 
WITH f
MATCH f-[r_allocates:Allocates*]-&gt;(n_allocation)
RETURN 
    n_allocation.cost_pool_hierarchy_id,  
    SUM(reduce(totalamt=f.amount, r IN r_allocates| (r.allocate)*totalamt/100 )) as amt 
ORDER BY n_allocation.cost_pool_hierarchy_id 
LIMIT 1000
</code></pre>

<p>This query takes 30+ seconds with warmed up caches. I have tried going back to Neo4j 1.9 as I found on some posts that Neo4j 2.0 is not yet optimized, but the similar query in 1.9 takes 40+ seconds.</p>

<p>Here is the output from profiler:</p>

<pre><code>==&gt; ColumnFilter(symKeys=[""n_allocation.cost_pool_hierarchy_id"", ""  INTERNAL_AGGREGATE2db722c4-6400-4803-90a2-b883b0076e8b""], returnItemNames=[""n_allocation.cost_pool_hierarchy_id"", ""amt""], _rows=746, _db_hits=0)

==&gt;           NodeByLabel(label=""financial"", identifier=""f"", _rows=34272, _db_hits=0)
</code></pre>

<p>I would appreciate any help in optimizing this query. Do I need to update some configuration settings? Or do I need to change the structure of graph?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Just to add further - even the below relatively simple query takes 26 seconds:</p>

This httphandler simply renders the current time into a Bitmap.
In aspx side, the Image is inside a AJAX UpadtePanel, and I'm using a timer to refresh the image every 5 sec.</p>

<p>My problem is that :</p>

<ul>
<li>in IE9, the image is not updated at all. My HttpHandler is requested only once.</li>
<li>in chrome, the image is updated but it ""blinks"", ie every 5s it is cleared for few secs then displayed, then cleared again etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>For debugging purpose I have also added inside the UpdatePanel a label, filled by a random value. It is well updated in both web browsers.</p>

<p>Here is the code in my aspx page : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:ScriptManager ID=""ScriptManager1"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
&lt;asp:Timer runat=""server"" ID=""UpdateTimer"" Interval=""5000"" OnTick=""UpdateTimer_Tick"" /&gt;
&lt;asp:UpdatePanel runat=""server"" ID=""TimedPanel"" UpdateMode=""Conditional""&gt;
    &lt;Triggers&gt;
        &lt;asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger ControlID=""UpdateTimer"" EventName=""Tick"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Triggers&gt;
    &lt;ContentTemplate&gt;
        &lt;asp:Image ID=""TheImage"" alt=""httpHandler"" src=""getImage.ashx?id=1"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
        &lt;asp:Label ID=""Label"" runat=""server"" Font-Size=""XX-Large"" &gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt;
    &lt;/ContentTemplate&gt;
&lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my HttpHandler, I did not forget to disable caching like this :</p>

<pre><code>cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);
cache.SetNoStore();
cache.SetExpires(DateTime.MinValue);
</code></pre>

<p>And to prevent my IE9 web browser caching the image, I also tried to change ImageUrl each time the timer is invoked in the aspx.cs file, like following. But my HttpHandler is still called only once when the page is displayed for the first time :</p>

<pre><code>protected void UpdateTimer_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
Label.Text = ((System.Environment.TickCount / 100.0) % 360).ToString(""F2"");
TheImage.ImageUrl = ""getImage.ashx?id="" + System.Environment.TickCount.ToString();
}

<p>I hope my problem is well explained.
What do I do wrong? </p>

<pre><code>class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Test addEdit = Test.AddEdit;
        bool hasEdit = addEdit.HasFlag(Test.Edit);
        bool hasAdd = addEdit.HasFlag(Test.Add);
        bool hasDelete = addEdit.HasFlag(Test.Delete);
        Console.WriteLine(hasEdit);
        Console.WriteLine(hasAdd);
        Console.WriteLine(hasDelete);
        Console.Read();
    }
}

   [Flags]
    public enum Test
    {
        Add = 0,
        Edit = 1,
        Delete = 2,
        AddEdit = Add | Edit
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So I made this. The funny thing that I found is that addEdit varaible shows only the value of ""Edit"" when looking at it through the VS debugger. At first I thought it was not storing both values.</p>

<p>I used the hasFlag method and sure enough it knows about both values.</p>

<p>So is it a bug or what?</p>

<p>So, I'm looking for either an existing technique or an existing library (in C#) for parsing a SQL Schema dump and generating an implementation-agnostic description of the schema. My intuition in that some kind of intermediary language (a generic DDL) has been defined before, and that tools exist to translate RDBMS-specific SQL into this language. I can't seem to find anything useful though ...</p>

<p><strong>Why this would be useful</strong>: Having a generic DDL that maps directly to .NET data types would mean that mappings could be made from individual SQL implementations (or other, non-SQL DDLs) to this generic DDL. It is then possible to have a series of modules (one per DDL/DB type) that either take some DDL syntax, or connect to a live database, and translate this into a series of Model classes in .NET.</p>

<p>I am working on enhancing the functionality of an application that I've inherited. It is a very intensive application that runs a good portion of my company's day to day business. Because of this I am limited to the scope of what I can change--otherwise I'd probably rewrite it from scratch. Anyways, here is what I need to do:</p>

<p>I have several threads that all perform the same task but on different data input streams. Each thread interacts through an API from another software system we pay licensing on to write out to what is called channels. Unfortunately we have only licensed a certain number of concurrently running channels, so this application is supposed to turn them on an off as needed. </p>

<p>Each thread should wait until there is an available channel, lock the channel for itself and perform its processing and then release the channel. Unfortunately, I don't know how to do this, especially across multiple threads. I also don't really know what to search Google or this site for, or I'd probably have my answer. This was my thought:</p>

<p>A class that handles the distribution of channel numbers. Each thread makes a call to a member of this class. When it does this it would enter a queue and block until the channel handling class recognizes that we have a channel, signals the waiting thread that a channel is available and passing it the channel id. I have no idea where to begin even looking this up.  Below I have some horribly written PsuedoCode of how in my mind I would think it would work. </p>

<pre><code>Public Class ChannelHandler

    Private Shared WaitQueue as New Queue(of Thread)
   '// calling thread adds itself to the queue
    Public Shared Sub WaitForChannel(byref t as thread) 
            WaitQueue.enqueue(t)
    End Sub

    Public Shared Sub ReleaseChannel(chanNum as integer)
        '// my own processing to make the chan num available again
    End Sub

    '// this would be running on a separate thread, polling my database
    '// for an available channel, when it finds one, somehow signal
    '// the first thread in the queue that its got a channel and here's the id
     Public Shared Sub ChannelLoop()
           while true
               if WaitQueue.length &gt; 0 then 
                   if thereIsAChannelAvailable then '//i can figure this out my own
                        dim t as thread = ctype(WaitQueue.dequeue(), Thread)
                         lockTheChannel(TheAvailableChannelNumber) 'performed by me
                       '// signal the thread, passing it the channel number
                        t =&gt; SignalReady(theAvailableChannelNumber) '// how to signal?
                    end if
                end if
           end while


    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>'// this inside the function that is doing the processing:
ChannelHandler.requestChannel(CurrentThread)
while (waitingForSignal) '// how?
    block                '// how?

dim channelNumber as int =&gt; getChannelNumberThatWasSignaledBack

'// perform processing with channelNumber

ChannelHandler.ReleaseChannel(channelNumber)
</code></pre>

<p>I am working with the .NET Framework 3.5 in VB.NET.  I am sure there has got to be some sort of mechanism already built for this, but as I said I have no idea exactly what keywords I should be searching for. Any input pointing me in the right direction (ie specific .NET framework classes to use or code samples) would be greatly appreciated. If I need to elaborate on anything, please let me know and I will to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>Edit: The other problem that I have is that these channels can be turned on/off from outside of this application, manually by the user (or as a result of a user initiated event). I am not concerned with a channel be shut down while a thread is using it (it would throw an exception and then pick back up next time it came through. But the issue is that there are not a constant number of threads fighting over a constant number of channels (if a user turns one on manually, the count is reduced, etc). Both items are variable, so I cant rely on the fact that there are no external forces (ie, something outside this set of threads, which is why I do some processing via my DB to determine an available channel number)</p>

<pre><code>public function get_well_infowindow ($permit) {

    $query = $this-&gt;db-&gt;query($sql);
    return $query-&gt;result();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you look at the infowindow you will see a four digit number for operator and a four digit code for geologic formation.  All data is from the State of Michigan database provided by the MDEQ and I just shoved it into MySQL.</p>

<p>I want to make my infowindow say ""Encana Gas Company"" instead of ""6450"" from the 'big table' and I want it to say ""Collingwood"" for the Collingwood shale formation instead of CLGD from the 'big table'.  I have added two more tables from the State of Michigan that list all companies by code and all formations by code, but I don't know how to pull the data I need from multiple tables and make my infowindow use the more human readable information.</p>

<p>The other tables are real simple:</p>

<pre><code>column1 - OpNo     column2 - OpName
6450               Encana Gas Company

column1-ObjForm    column2 - FormName
CLGD               Collingwood Shale

<p>I echo out, currently, <code>$marker_info[0]-&gt;OpNo</code> and <code>$marker_info[0]-&gt;ObjForm</code> from the one call to the 'big table' and I want to echo out <code>$marker_info[0]-&gt;OpName</code> and <code>$marker_info[0]-&gt;FormName</code> but they come from those other tables and I don't have a clue how to do retrieve from multiple tables or echo this back out.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me: select everything from my ""big table"" like I do now which is working just fine, but swap the company code for company name and geologic formation code for long description of geologic formation and how to echo it back out?</p>

It's not a duplicate.</strong> </p>

<p>I know it covers a problem that was mentioned here multiple times but this time it's not ""how to detect collisions"" because as you will see later, it's already done. It's more about ""how to write"" this in as much optimized way as possible, because below detection will be triggered multiple times in a short delay of time.</p>

<p>Here's my fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/slick/81y70h1f/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/slick/81y70h1f/</a></p>

<p><strong>I generate random squares and detect if they collide with each other.</strong></p>

<p>HTML is generated using below way. No rocket science:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php for ($i=1; $i&lt;=$amount; $i++) { ?&gt;
    &lt;div id=""square_&lt;?= $i; ?&gt;"" class=""square"" style=""top: &lt;?= rand(0, 800); ?&gt;px; left: &lt;?= rand(0, 800); ?&gt;px;""&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;square_&lt;?= $i; ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php } ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the fiddle, <code>$amount</code> is set to 16. As you can imagine, the possible amount of unique pair combination is equal to:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rd7Nk.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rd7Nk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In the fiddle you will see that I perform the uniqueness calculation twice. Second time just for squares that don't collide.</p>

<pre><code>var squares_without_collision = $(squares).not(garbage).get();
pairs_cleaned = get_unique_pairs(squares_without_collision);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>pairs_cleaned</code> is my final array when I will perform the secret operation that is not a part of this problem. This array will be always slightly reduced with unnecessary crap.</p>

<p>When I will increase <code>$amount</code> to <code>100</code> I will get <strong>4950</strong> possible combination. When I refresh page it still works fine but I can observe the speed drops down. I even didn't try to set it to 200 because I don't want my browser to crash.</p>

<p>Question - is here still any space of the improvement and optimization? Because now I will reveal that these squares will be Google Map markers and my collision calculation will be triggered on events when:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tiles are loaded</li>
<li>Map is dragged</li>
<li>Zoom is changed</li>
</ol>

<p>In the final version, instead of changing background from green to red, I will be showing or hiding markers. I'm worried, that with more markers I will do a turtle script. I would like to keep it extra fast.</p>

<p>i think i solved my problem..</p>

<p>the solution: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4533440/android-listview-text-color"">Android ListView Text Color</a></p>

<p>i aded a style:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style name=""ListFont"" parent=""@android:style/Widget.ListView""&gt; &lt;item name=""android:textColor""&gt;#000000&lt;/item&gt; &lt;item name=""android:typeface""&gt;sans&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and added it in my manifest...</p>

<p>in my activity i used this:</p>

<p><code>ArrayAdapter&lt;CharSequence&gt; adapter = ArrayAdapter.createFromResource(getActivity(), R.array.BlaBla, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1);</code></p>

<p>i ask myself what exactly  ""android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 does? - why my textColor did not worked and why it does work now with a seperate style -  do i need to mention simple_list_item_1 then in my activity any more? </p>

<p>Im editing a custom taxonomy page. On landing on the page the page query is automatically set to return a list of posts under the custom taxonomy I'm on. In that page template I run this query posts:</p>

<pre><code>        query_posts(

<pre><code>&lt;?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?&gt;
  My Loop
&lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But inside the above loop I do another query:</p>

<pre><code>      &lt;?php $args = array('p' =&gt; $officeID, 'post_type' =&gt; ""offices""); query_posts($args); ?&gt;
      &lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?&gt;

      &lt;?php wp_reset_query(); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I use wp_reset_query(); so that the loop above is returned to its original state. Or so you would think. But what is happening is that wp_reset_query() is resetting the query to the page query and not the query I did in the first code block. Why is this happening and how can I prevent this from happening?</p>

If an element has the 'data-required-if' attribute (which has a jQuery selector as it's value), it checks to see if any elements are found that match that selector. If any are found, the field is required. It does something similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>$('[data-required-if]').each(function () {
  var selector = $(this).attr('data-required-if'),
      required = false;

<p>This works great, but there's a problem. When you use the attribute selector to filter based on the current value of a text field, it really filters on the initial value of the text field.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input
  type='text'
  id='myinput'
  value='initial text'

&lt;input

"22746200","1","","","2014-03-30 15:58:33","","3","714","<p>We have a moderately-sized SSDT project (~100 tables) that's deployed to dozens of different database instances. As part of our build process we generate a .dacpac file and then when we're ready to upgrade a database we generate a publish script and run it against the database. Some db instances are upgraded at different times so it's important that we have a structured process for these upgrades and versioning. </p>

<p>Most of the generated migration script is dropping and (re)creating procs, functions, indexes and performing any structural changes, plus some data scripts included in a Post-Deployment script. It's these two data-related items I'd like to know how best to structure within the project: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Custom data migrations needed between versions</p></li>
<li><p>Static or reference data </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Custom data migrations needed between versions</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes we want to perform a one-off data migration as part of an upgrade and I'm not sure the best way to incorporate this into our SSDT project. For example, recently I added a new bit column <code>dbo.Charge.HasComments</code> to contain (redundant) derived data based on another table and will be kept in sync via triggers. An annoying but necessary performance improvement (only added after careful consideration &amp; measurement). As part of the upgrade the SSDT-generated Publish script will contain the necessary <code>ALTER TABLE</code> and <code>CREATE TRIGGER</code> statements, but I also want to update this column based on data in another table: </p>

<pre><code>update dbo.Charge 
set HasComments = 1 
where exists ( select * 
               from dbo.ChargeComment 
               where ChargeComment.ChargeId = Charge.ChargeId ) 
and HasComments = 0 
</code></pre>

<p>What's the best way to include this data migration script in my SSDT project? </p>

<p>Currently I have each of these types of migrations in a separate file that's included in the Post-Deployment script, so my Post-Deployment script ends up looking like this: </p>

<pre><code>-- data migrations
:r ""data migration\Update dbo.Charge.HasComments if never populated.sql""
go
:r ""data migration\Update some other new table or column.sql""
go
</code></pre>

<p>Is this the right way to do it, or is there some way to tie in with SSDT and its version tracking better, so those scripts aren't even run when the SSDT Publish is being run against a database that's already at a more recent version. I could have my own table for tracking which migrations have been run, but would prefer not to roll-my-own if there's a standard way of doing this stuff. </p>

<p><strong>Static or reference data</strong> </p>

<p>Some of the database tables contain what we call static or reference data, e.g. list of possible timezones, setting types, currencies, various 'type' tables etc. Currently we populate these by having a separate script for each table that is run as part of the Post-Deployment script. Each static data script inserts all the 'correct' static data into a table variable and then inserts/updates/deletes the static data table as needed. Depending on the table it might be appropriate only to insert or only insert and delete but not to update existing records. So each script looks something like this: </p>

<pre><code>-- table listing all the correct static data
declare @working_data table (...)

-- add all the static data that should exist into the working table
insert into @working_data (...) select null, null null where 1=0
union all select 'row1 col1 value', 'col2 value', etc...
union all select 'row2 col1 value', 'col2 value', etc...
...

-- insert any missing records in the live table
insert into staticDataTableX (...)
select * from @working_data
where not exists ( select * from staticDataTableX
                   where [... primary key join on @working_data...] )

-- update any columns that should be updated
update staticDataTableX
set ...
from staticDataTableX
inner join @working_data on [... primary key join on @working_data...]

-- delete any records, if appropriate with this sort of static data
delete from staticDataTableX
where not exists ( select * from staticDataTableX
                   where [... primary key join on @working_data...] )
</code></pre>

<p>and then my Post-Deployment script has a section like this: </p>

<pre><code>-- static data. each script adds any missing static/reference data:
:r ""static_data\settings.sql""
go
:r ""static_data\other_static_data.sql""
go
:r ""static_data\more_static_data.sql""
go
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a better or more conventional way to structure such static data scripts as part of an SSDT project?</p>

   In Expressjs, the helpers' scope does not extend to the helpers themselves when they are called from a view.</p>

<p>Is there a sollution for this? I would like to not have to pass the helpers to the view as parameters, or have to require the helper's file.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>I have </p>

app.helpers({ CharCounter  : require('./CharCounter.js'  ) });

<p>in my server. When I'm rendering a view, I use jshtml view engine and to call a helper, I just have to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>@TextBoxHelper()    //I can do this because all helpers are present in this scope
</code></pre>

<p>When the helper is called, it exits the view scope, and there will be no access to the other helpers there.</p>

<p>Now, I would like this helper ""TextBox"" to call ""CharCounter"". This second helper, is supposed to be called by several other helpers, so, it would be great if I could just call it from the helpers' "".js"" files, without having to require the script, or send it as a parameter.</p>

</ul>

<p>The docs from <code>RescaleOp</code> clearly state for instances of <code>BufferedImage</code>, alpha channel is <strong>not</strong> scaled in the single factor constructors -- I interpret as either <code>float</code> or <code>float[1]</code>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/image/RescaleOp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Quote from JDK6</a>: (emphasis added)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For BufferedImages, rescaling operates on color and alpha components.
  The number of sets of scaling constants may be one, in which case the
  same constants are applied to all color (<em>but not alpha</em>) components.
  Otherwise, the number of sets of scaling constants may equal the
  number of Source color components, in which case <em>no rescaling of the
  alpha component</em> (if present) is performed. If neither of these cases
  apply, the number of sets of scaling constants must equal the number
  of Source color components plus alpha components, in which case all
  color and alpha components are rescaled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a <code>BufferedImage</code> with type <code>BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB</code>, there are four channels (R-G-B-A), where alpha is the last channel.  (Why didn't they call it <code>BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGBA</code>?)  I tried these <code>RescaleOp</code> transformations without success: (assume <code>float scaleFactor = 1.25f</code> and <code>float offset = 0.0f</code>)</p>

<pre><code>new RescaleOp(scaleFactor, offset, (RenderingHints) null)

new RescaleOp(new float[] { scaleFactor },
              new float[] { offset },
              (RenderingHints) null)

new RescaleOp(new float[] { scaleFactor, scaleFactor, scaleFactor },
              new float[] { offset, offset, offset },
              (RenderingHints) null)
</code></pre>

<p>Only this works: (assume <code>float alphaScaleFactor = 1.0f</code>)</p>

<pre><code>new RescaleOp(new float[] { scaleFactor, scaleFactor, scaleFactor, alphaScaleFactor },
              new float[] { offset, offset, offset, offset },
              (RenderingHints) null)
</code></pre>

<li>Do I misunderstand the official JDK docs?</li>
<li>Or, is this a bug that could/should be fixed in future JDKs?</li>
<li>Is there a way to find (at runtime) the alpha channel index?

<p>I've tried to bind the event to just the form that gets generated and, as you can see above, I've tried just catching any submit event. Any help on this is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here's what my index page looks like</p>

<pre><code>schedule a task, using the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.schedule() method
when the schedule time is reached, the task is executed and a new schedule is started

<p>Thus, the service continuously has a timer in place (except during execution of the task); sometimes 2 (independent) timers are in place, depending on the result of the task. The service should be running all the time and executes different tasks from time to time. </p>

<p>All seems to work ok (at least when running with DDMS), but after a while (something like an hour without connecting the device via DDMS) the timer tasks are not executed anymore. The only way to get it working again is either stopping and starting the service again or by connecting the device with DDMS (using Eclipse); waking up the device only does not trigger this. </p>

<p>It looks like, Android sets the service in a kind of sleep mode (service is still running when looking at the Active Services on the device).</p>

<p>My question is: how do I prevent this behavior and keep the service working all the time?</p>

<p>I did some research and I found something which theoretically could give a solution, by acquiring a (PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK) WakeLock in the service, but as far as I understand, using this solution, I have to acquire the lock at the onStartService() method and release it at onDestroy(), meaning that I keep the lock during the lifetime of the service (which is forever); I suspect a battery drainage using this method.</p>

This means that my activity or WebView was destroyed? But why there is no onCreate call to activity which should re-initialize WebView?

The problem I have is that the registration form must use properties that are defined in the vendor role. I cannot figure out how to make MVC use those role properties for register purposes. I've tried assigning the appropriate role to the applicationuser but, after assigning it the role it still says it doesn't exist. Is there anyway of doing this, or am I going to have to split this into two register screens (ie one to handle initial user creation and a second one to handle role specific implementation)?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I split the views, the first view deals solely with the creation of the Application User, while the second view is where I add the VendorUser Role fields to the user created in the first view. It now errors, and says that I am not able to add VendorUserRole attributes to IdentityUserRole.</p>

<p>Error Code ""Error 2 Argument 1: cannot convert from 'Project1.Models.VendorUserRole' to 'Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework.IdentityUserRole'""</p>

<p>I clearly failed to update or override something in my roles implementation. Does anyone have any idea of where this can be fixed? I thought I altered all of them to work properly.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I clearly need more understanding of Identity, before I try any more code; can someone tell me if my basic premise is correct?:</p>

<p>I need two different users: vendors and administrators which have different properties, I have one user class ApplicationUser which came with Identity 2. I have created roles with the different properties for each, and am now stuck. I cannot figure out how to reference the different roles to the main user class. According to my research in .NET a user is simply the entity that logs in, out, etc. Properly defined roles are supposed to allow you to attach the roles to a user instance, thereby creating the necessary role. </p>

<p>I hope I have not done hours of coding based on a faulty premise...</p>

The activity that is started by the start button, is suppposed to obtain the user's current location, then proceed to find the distances between the user's current location and 5 set locations. Then it processed these distances. </p>

<p>Here is my logCat:(<strong>I am really sorry but I just joined and I can't add pictures</strong>)</p>

<p>When this is run, it calls getTracks() fifty times and makes quite some (server) CPU load in very short time until it all gets done. What I would like to do is to group AJAX getTrack() queries by for example 5 at a time, wait until those five are done, then call the next five, wait until the next five are done, call the next five etc. The purpose of this would be to make fewer queries at basically the same time (less and more evenly spread CPU load). </p>

<p>I am unsure how or even if this can be done since it kind of partially beats the point of AJAX, but I would still like to make this work if possible. Could someone please point me into the right direction? Thank you.</p>

<p>To better understand what I need this for and what the app does, here is a link to the <a href=""http://lastfm.cmikavac.net/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>app</strong></a>. it can be tried out with any lastfm nick (if you don't have one, you can use mine - ""pootzko"").

<li>client project with the WEB-APP structure (like a regular dynamic web project).

<li>server project with the ejbs. This should be a JAR file.</li>
<li>ear project which joins both projects together.</li>

<p>I tried that with help of the integrated maven plugin in eclipse. Since (I believe Helios) maven is already integrated in eclipse. So I go to</p>

<p>So how can I create all three projects are build them together?</p>

<p>A standard webcam fits into the category of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class"">'USB Video Device Class', or 'UVC'</a>.</p>

<p>And in linux, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video4Linux"">Video4Linux (V4L, V4L2)</a> encapsulates all video capture devices. V4L(2) provides two APIs: one is for programs that want to get and use the data from the capture devices. The other API is internal, for the drivers themselves, so those drivers can then be accessed by programs via V4L(2)'s external API.</p>

<p>One of those V4L(2) drivers is the <a href=""http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/"">UVC driver</a> which encompasses all standards-compliant USB webcams.</p>

<p>Looking at that homepage of the <a href=""http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/"">UVC driver</a>, it shows a list of supported devices. Has each one of those devices been catered for individually within the UVC driver? Or only if a device had a peculiarity that needed to be dealt with? In other words, should all standards-compliant USB webcams automatically work with the UVC driver, whether or not they're on that list?</p>

<p>The bump API is included as a native library into my application (<code>libandroid-api.so</code>). In order to connect to the bump server I’m using a service and during the <code>onStop</code> (when I press home button) I am <strong>unBinding</strong> the service and during <code>onStart</code> (when resuming it from background) I will be <strong>Binding</strong> the service. So if I continue this UnBinding and Binding for 2 or 3 times I am getting this error.</p>

<p>I have done some searching about this signal 11 (SIGSEGV), fault addr, and found out it is happening when application makes an invalid memory reference. I didn’t have any access to this native library. I don’t know what to do.</p>

# Now run some command that actually installs io.js on the system.

<p>The problem seems to be that the io.js ""source"" that I download from this distribution appears to just contain executables build for different systems, which isn't what I want.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can get the source files for iojs-v2.5.0 so I can go in there and do <code>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make check &amp;&amp; make install</code>? It seems it would be way easier if I could do it this way on Docker.</p>

<p>Now, this site I'm building is a business profile site of sorts, built with PHP and MYSQL. The profile page can query based on either the id number, or the unique slug id, which acts as an easy-to-read URL for the businesses to use when they want people to link to their profile. So I have the rewrite engine putting the string into a variable in the URL so the profile page can get the string and use it to query. As of right now, it's going to rewrite any URL or file that doesn't exist and send it to the profile page. This seems a little sloppy, as I wouldn't want a user who enters an incorrect URL for, say, the contact page, and instead get's sent to the invalid profile page. Here's the rule:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

RewriteRule .* profile.php?uniqueID=$0 [L] 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'm thinking the only real way I could do this instead is to make the urls more unique, so instead of <code>www.bizprofiles.com/uniqueprofilename</code> as the basic structure, I do <code>www.bizprofiles.com/profils/uniqueprofilename</code> and instead write the condition to exact match the url up until the unique name.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if anyone has any better of an idea?</p>

At best the solution is also possible with object-arrays that are a property of another object (aggregation).</p>

<p>In my project there are a lot of entities which have to be identified by their manifold features. Matlab objects with their properties provide a clear data foundation for this purpose. The alternative of using structs (or cells) and arrays of indices seems to be too confusing. Unfortunately the access to the properties of objects is a little bit complicated.</p>

<p>For Example, all Objects in myArray with Element.val==3 should be returned:</p>

<pre><code>elementsValIsThree = myElements(Element.val==3);
</code></pre>

<p>Best solution so far:</p>

<pre><code>find([myElements.val]==3);
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't return the objects and not the absolute index if a subset of myElements is input.</p>

<p>Another attempt returns only the first Element and needs constant properties:</p>

<pre><code>myElements(Element.val==3);
</code></pre>

<p>A minimal example with class definition etc. for clarification:</p>

<pre><code>% element.m
classdef Element
    properties
        val
    end
    methods
        function obj = Element(value)
            if nargin &gt; 0 % to allow empty construction
                obj.val = value;
            end
        end
    end   
end
</code></pre>

<p>Create array of Element-Objects:</p>

<pre><code>myElements(4) = Element(3)

<p>Spits out a nice hash string. In my php I have been executing it as such:</p>

<pre><code>$crunch = '~/domains/somewhere.net/html/api/crunch';
        $code = `$crunch $code`;
        $code = mysql_real_escape_string(trim($code));
</code></pre>

<p>$code is initially a string which is an URL. It has been returning a hash but not any more.</p>

<p>I have recompiled the C a few times. Just don't get it, I have tried php exec() , passthru().</p>

<p>FIXED:</p>

<p>The issue was the difference between my Mac Unix distros and the linux server. The fix was to log into my server and compile the .c file there.</p>

<p>Bobs your Uncle, works again.</p>

<p>Thanks peeps, I did check everyones advice. Sometimes ruling out possible breaks helps focus on the issue. Virtual beers(or sparkling water) all around!</p>

<p>When I display the form and perform the editing once, everything's OK. However, I'd like to keep the form displayed and allow the user to edit it again. With my approach, immediately after sending the updated record to the server, when the <code>startEditing</code> method tries to add the band to the transaction again, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught Error: assertion failed: Once a record has changed, you cannot move it into a different transaction

<p>I understand I cannot create another transaction with the same object. But why? And how can I fix this? </p>

<p>(Btw, is there any simplier approach for updating the records than those transactions, startEditing and stopEditing methods? It seems a bit overkill to me.)</p>

<p>This really gives me a hard time. Really appreciate if anyone has a solution for this.
PS:</p>

<p>Ohkay, I've just realized the problem lies within the Authentication Library that I'm using which is AG_auth.  It requires the controller to extends Application instead of CI_Controller, and when I remove it and extend the controller back to CI_Controller, it works on IE. But this is really not secured. So the problem is why doesnt it work with IE when i use extend Aplication but works on chrome and firefox?</p>

<p>What I am trying to a click a <code>.btn-tab</code> element, and from there add an <code>.active</code> class to the closest <code>.tab-content</code> that also has the same class as the <code>.btn-tab</code> data-item attribute.</p>

<p>All I seem to be able to do however is add an active class to all the tab-content element that also have the matching class and data-item.</p>

<p>** Example **</p>

<p>If I click on the first Sub Items link then all the <code>.tab-content .items</code> elements get the active class however I just want the one closest to click to get the class.</p>

<p>Here is my javascript,</p>

<pre><code>var clicked = $(e.currentTarget),
        clickedTab = clicked.data(""tab"");

    var clickedParent = clicked.parents('.item');

    clickedParent.css(""border"", ""1px solid red"");

    clickedParent.find("".item-tabs"").find("".tab-content."" + clickedTab).addClass(""active"");

The first engineer on the project was following the default Django code layout. As things have grown we've recently split out models into their own directory with one file per model.</p>

<p>It's time to start doing the same for views. However, I don't want/need to do it all in one go. I'd like to just start moving things out of the default <code>views.py</code> one by one as I work on them. However, I'm having difficulty getting <code>urls.py</code> to work with both a views directory and  <code>views.py</code> </p>

<p>Is this just going to cause a naming collision when I try to import 'views' in my <code>urls.py</code> file? Is the simple answer just to call ""views"" something else while I make the transition? Or just bite the bullet and do it all at once?</p>

<p>I have a JUnit4 TestSuite  that runs one JUnit test class.    My JUnit test class has 10 test methods in it that fill out a webpage.   In this JUnit test class I have a List object that holds data for tests.   I can currently drive the Unit test by accessing List object like so:</p>

<pre><code>// all data for my tests can be grabbed using the get(0) method
testListObject.getPersonEntity.get(0).getName();
</code></pre>

<p>My question for StackOverflow users is:</p>

<p>How do I refactor my JUnit test so that it will run through multiple tests in my Object list?</p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it possible to create a method that loops through the list and somehow gets all the test methods to fire off each time in the loop?  Would this make sense?  Then the unit test wouldn't be finished each time it fills out a page, but instead only after it fills out the page for every test case in the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Or, should I move the test list out to the TestSuite object and somehow call the Unit test class multiple times?  If so, how?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am unsure how to accomplish this, not being very familiar with how JUnit works.  In other words, not knowing the underpinnings of how the ""test"" methods get fired off, I don't currently know the proper way to get a JUnit test to run multiple times.   Another way to ask: how would I get the TestSuite class to call the unit test class multiple times, each time with a different testentity argument (from a List) that drives the test?</p>

"12250029","1","","","2012-09-03 14:45:27","","0","459","<p>This is a basic OO design question. I'm writing classes in C++ to represent items in a flow chart according to an input C file that have been parsed.</p>

<p>Simply we have 2 types of items (classes) : <strong>FlowChartActionItem</strong> and <strong>FlowChartConditionItem</strong>. 
These represent Actions and Decision/Condition elements of a flowchart respectively. And they also represent Statements and If-conditions respectively, that existed in the input C file. Both classes inherit <strong>FlowChartItem</strong>.</p>

<p>Each sub-classes has a number of pointers to the items that comes after them; yes, we have a graph, with nodes(items) and links(pointers). But the <strong>FlowChartActionItem</strong> has only one outward pointer while the <strong>FlowChartConditionItem</strong> has 3 outward pointers (for the then-statements branch, the else-statements branch and a pointer to whatever comes after the both branches of the if-condition.</p>

<p>My problem is writing a neat setter for the outward pointers (nextItems). Take a look at the classes :</p>

<pre><code>class FlowChartItem
{
public:
    //I **need** this setter to stay in the parent class FlowChartItem
    virtual void SetNextItem(FlowChartItem* nextItem, char index) = NULL;
};
</code></pre>

<p>-</p>

<pre><code>class FlowChartActionItem:public FlowChartItem
{
public:
    FlowChartItem* nextItem; //Only 1 next item
public: 
    void SetNextItem(FlowChartItem* nextItem, char index);
};
</code></pre>

<p>-</p>

<pre><code>class FlowChartConditionItem: public FlowChartItem
{
public:
    FlowChartItem* nextItem;
    FlowChartItem* trueBranchItem;
    FlowChartItem* falseBranchItem; //we have 3 next items here
public:
    void SetNextItem(FlowChartItem* nextItem, char index);
};
</code></pre>

<p>I needed a generic setter that doesn't depend on the number of pointers the sub-class is having.
As you see I've used char index to tell the setter which pointer is to be set. But I don't like this and I need to make things neater. Because code won't be readable e.g :</p>

<pre><code>item1.setNextItem(item2,1);
</code></pre>

<p>we don't remember what the 1 means? the then-branch ? the else ? ??</p>

<p>The obvious answer is to define an enum in FlowCharItem, but then we'll have one of two problems :</p>

<p>1- Enum values will be defined Now and will thus be tailored for the current sub-classes FlowChartActioItem and FlowChartConditionItem, so calls to SetNextItem on future sub-classes will have very bad readability. And even worse, they cannot have more than 3 outward pointers!</p>

<p>2- Solve the 1st problem by making developers of the future sub-classes edit the header file of FlowChartItem and add whatever values in the enum ! of course not acceptable!</p>

<p>What solution do I have in order to keep
-good readability
-neat extensibility of my classes ??</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;span id=""put-stuff-here""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span id=""put-stuff-here2""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span id=""put-stuff-here3""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var itemSelected = { 'fields': [ 'Test1', 'Test2', 'Test3' ] }
    document.getElementById('put-stuff-here').innerHTML = itemSelected.fields[0];

    })
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>However, when I attempt to define the variable ""itemSelected"" using a form field, nothing renders in the destination div.  Here is the non-working code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;select id=""getItem""&gt;
            &lt;option value=""{ 'fields': [ 'Test1', 'Test2', 'Test3' ] }""&gt;ItemName&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;option value=""{ 'fields': [ 'Test4', 'Test5', 'Test6' ] }""&gt;ItemName2&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;span id=""put-stuff-here""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span id=""put-stuff-here2""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span id=""put-stuff-here3""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(""#getItem"").change(function () {
        var itemSelected = $(this).val();
        document.getElementById('put-stuff-here').innerHTML = itemSelected.fields[0];
        document.getElementById('put-stuff-here2').innerHTML = itemSelected.fields[1];
        document.getElementById('put-stuff-here3').innerHTML = itemSelected.fields[2];      
    })
    .change();
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason the value passed to ""itemSelected"" doesn't get processed as an array.  I'm hoping someone here will be kind enough to take a look and perhaps suggest a solution.</p>

I use boost::thread for threading and the clutter library 1.0.</p>

<p>To be specific, the thread contains a looped function that emits boost::signals2::signal with parameters of x and y coordinates every once in a while.
That signal is connected to a function that hands those variables to clutter, i.e. x,y in</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>clutter_stage_get_actor_at_pos(CLUTTER_STAGE(actor),
  CLUTTER_PICK_ALL, x, y);</p>

<p>And that is where i get a segfault.</p>

<p>Apparently clutter has some thread-handling routines. I tried calling</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g_thread_init(NULL);</p>
  
  <p>clutter_threads_init();</p>
</blockquote>

<p>before starting clutter_main(). I also tried enclosing the clutter function in</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>clutter_threads_enter();</p>
  
  <p>clutter_stage_get_actor_at_pos(CLUTTER_STAGE(actor),

<p><strong>Addendum</strong></p>

<p>I just forged a minimal sample of what I am trying to do. I already 'protected' the clutter_main() routine as suggested. Some functions of clutter seem to work (e.g setting stage color or setting actor position) from the seperate thread.  Is there still something wrong with my code?</p>

<p>Why is it allowed in safe context?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It allows you to handle value types, as different value type - as you would achieve with:  </p>

<p>float f = 2.5f;<br>
int binaryIdenticalInt = *((int*)&amp;f);</p></li>
<li><p>It allows you to reference an object of type X, as it was of type Y, EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO RELATION BETWEEN THOSE TYPES.</p></li>
<li><p>It allows you to create types which the CLR won't even load (if at least one of overlapping fields is a reference type, and at least one of them is value/pointer type - the CLR would refuse to load it). I would expect the C# compiler to be more picky about what it allows, than the CLR. not less.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, why the compiler allow such things in safe context in the first place? Why doesn't it require unsafe context for types with explicit layout, which have overlapping fields?  </p>

<p>I hope someone out there has an answer - because it has to be interesting.</p>

<p>Examples (all compiled without unsafe block, nor even unsafe switch):</p>

<pre><code>[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]
struct ValueUnion
{
    [FieldOffset(0)]
    public int i;

<p>If I understand this correctly, the article says that if my program is not running with elevated permissions, it will generate a WIN32 exception with <code>NativeErrorCode</code> equal to 5 if you try to get an elevated process's <code>StartTime</code> or <code>HasExited</code> properties.
I feel like this could be an easy workaround for my issue - try to get <code>StartTime</code> or <code>HasExited</code> from a non-elevated program and if it produces that error, it is an elevated process.</p>

<p>Problem is, I can't seem to get this to work reliably, <code>HasExited</code> errors unreliably when I've manually right-clicked notepad and selected ""Run as Administrator"", and used <code>GetProcessesByName(""notepad"")</code></p>

<p>Even more troublesome is I can't isolate individual Explorer Windows. Explorer.exe is always running, and <em>can</em> be elevated, but even if it is running WITHOUT elevation you can still manually start the process as elevated a number of different ways, none of which effect the parent explorer.exe process.</p>

<p>So I guess I need to find WindowHandles from the spawned processes, or their child threads, and somehow see if the window is elevated?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>This is my scenario:<br>
I have a <code>UITableView</code> with 5 sections and 12 cells. This view is opened with a <code>push segue</code> and everything works fine, it scrolls, etc.</p>

<p>Three of those cells open a <code>MKMapView</code> view (through a <code>push segue</code>) another pops up a <code>MFMailComposeViewController</code>.</p>

<p>When I try to <em>go back</em> to my <code>UITableView</code> I'm no longer able to scroll to the bottom. I can only scroll <em>a bit</em> and then it returns to the top of my tableview.</p>

<p>I tried to set the frame size on <code>viewWillAppear</code>, I tried to reload the <code>tableView</code> but it doesn't work!<br>
What could cause this issue?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
My implementation are:</p>

<p>I created a control that inserts a record into a Database and writes a cookie to the user's machine.  Here is the cookie writing code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>protected void CreateCookie(Guid id, DateTime expires)
{
    var oCookie = new HttpCookie(""gsow"");

    oCookie.Value = id.ToString();
    oCookie.Expires = expires;

    HttpContext.Current.Response.Cookies.Add(oCookie);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Very simple, nothing fancy.  The ID is passed from the function that writes the entry into the database and this ID is generated on the fly.  Now here is the code for my cookie reading:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

    var oCookie = HttpContext.Current.Response.Cookies[""gsow""];

    output.Text = ""I am Here&lt;br /&gt;"";

    if (oCookie != null)
        output.Text += oCookie.Value;
    else
        output2.Text = ""No Cookie."";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, very simple. Here are the steps I have taken and duplicated several times:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create cookie/db entry by launching first page.</li>
<li>Verify cookie/db entry exist (they do at this step, checked via Chrome's cookie manager)</li>
<li>Launch second page</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I load up the second page, which should spit out the ID that I set earlier, the cookie still exists but it is Unset.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the cookie after I load the first page:</p>

<p><img src=""http://imgur.com/66Z8O.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

<p>And once I load the second page:</p>

<p><img src=""http://imgur.com/DUeEx.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

<p>So from what I am seeing, the cookie's value/expiration get stripped out when I load the second page. Anyone have any ideas on why this is happening?</p>

<p>When I debug in the browser, it shows that all the raphael functions get skipped. I havent a clue as to why.</p>

<p>The console says : ""ReferenceError: raphael is not defined"",
but when I watch Raphael I get a running version : 
""Raphael: Your browser supports SVG. You are running Raphaël 2.1.2""</p>

<p>So I'm trying to get the div with id ""svg"", and draw the image inside that. This does not happen and the div remains empty. </p>

<p>I have injected the new factory </p>

<pre><code>angular.module('timeAppApp')
.controller('ProjectDetailController', function($scope, $meteor, $state, $stateParams, svgFactory)
</code></pre>

<p>and try to draw the image in the matching view. <code>&lt;div id=""svg""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<p>I know I'm probably doing 127things wrong and raphael/angular enthousiast are crying blood, but I really don't know what :(</p>

<p>As an added plus, I also kinda need to be able to pass 3 values to the factory, instead of having them hardcoded.</p>

<p>Then I'd call <code>initMap()</code> once in my code and be done.</p>

<p>Now I've read several Questions here already and it seems non-trivial to achieve const-ness for the map.</p>

<p>Making it a <code>std::map&lt;std::string, const int&gt;</code> won't allow me to fill it in the <code>initMap()</code>.
Filling it with a non-const temp and the copy constructor on definition doesn't work either, as the copy constructor doesn't easily take the non-const version as input.</p>

<p>Making it a <code>const std::map&lt;std::string, int&gt;</code> (which I could fill with a non-const copy during definition) would disable the use of the <code>[]</code> operator for value access.</p>

<p>So is there a way to achieve (value) const-ness and initialize the structure (preferably in the header file)?</p>

    $sth = $this-&gt;prepare(""UPDATE $table SET $fieldDetails WHERE $where"");

    foreach ($data as $key =&gt; $value) {
        $sth-&gt;bindValue("":$key"", $value);
    }

    foreach ($whereBindArray as $key =&gt; $value) {
        $sth-&gt;bindValue("":$key"", $value);
    }


    $sth-&gt;execute();
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's my php code:</p>

<pre><code>$rpath = realpath(dirname(__FILE__)) . '/' . basename( __FILE__ );

$db-&gt;update(
 'as_texts', array(
 ""content"" =&gt; $_POST['content'],
 ""lastupdate"" =&gt; date(""Y-m-d H:i:s""),
 ""rpath = :r"",
 array( ""r"" =&gt; $rpath )

<p>and there goes my table sql</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `as_texts` (
`ID` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
`name` VARCHAR(75) NOT NULL,
`rpath` VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
`content` TEXT NOT NULL,

They often don't have primary keys, or they have extra fields that had some purpose in the nineties, etc., or the new tables have new fields, etc.</p>

<p>I need to find records - based on a set of fields specified at runtime - that are in one table but not another.</p>

<p>So, I do this kind of query all the time in SQL, when I'm comparing data in different tables:</p>

<pre><code>dim fields_i_care_about as string = ""field1, field2, field3"" 
'This kind of thing gets set by a caller, can be any number of fields, depends on the 
'table

dim s as string= """"

dim flds = fields_i_care_about.split("","")
for i as integer = 0 to ubound(flds)
    if s &gt; """" then s += "" AND ""
    s += "" dysfunctional_database_table."" &amp; flds(i) &amp; ""=current_database_table."" &amp; flds(i)
next

s = ""SELECT * from dysfunctional_database_table where not exists (SELECT * from current_database_table WHERE "" &amp; s &amp; "")""
</code></pre>

<p>====</p>

<p>I'm trying to do this using Linq because it seems like some of the datatype problems with two different database types become less of a headache, 
but I'm new to Linq and totally stuck.</p>

<p>I got as far as this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Put old and new tables into datatables as dt1 and dt2</p>

<pre><code> Dim new_records = _
            From new_recs In dt2.AsEnumerable
            Where Not ( _
                From old_recs In dt1.AsEnumerable Where old_recs(field1) = new_recs(field1) AndAlso old_recs(field2) = new_recs(field2)).Any
             Select new_recs
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>But I can't figure out how to put this part in on the fly - 
    old_recs(field1) = new_recs(field1) AndAlso old_recs(field2) = new_recs(field2)</p>

<p>So far I've tried:
putting the fields I want to compare and making them a string and just putting that string in as a variable ( I thought I was probably cheating, and I guess I was)</p>

<pre><code>dim str = old_recs(field1) = new_recs(field1) AndAlso old_recs(field2) = new_recs(field2)

 From new_recs In dt2.AsEnumerable
            Where Not ( _
                From old_recs In dt1.AsEnumerable Where str).Any
             Select new_recs
</code></pre>

<p>It tells me it can't convert a Boolean - </p>

<p>Is there any way to do this without Linq expressions?  They seem far more complex than what I'm trying to do here, and they take a lot of code, and also I can't seem to find examples of Expressions where we're comparing two fields in a subquery.</p>

<p>Is there a simpler way?  I know I could do the usual EXISTS query using JOIN or IN - in this case I don't need the query to be super fast or anything. And I don't need to use a DataTable or DataSet - I can put the data in some other kind of object.  </p>

<p>Copying the example from the <a href=""http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/development/sessions.html#built-in-session-handlers-configuration"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>, I set the session type to php, and set the timeout to 3 days (4320 mins). However, after reading various articles, it seems that even after setting the timeout to 3 days in Cake, PHP may destroy the session in GC if  PHP.ini is set with a shorter timeout for the session or GC.</p>

<p>So, I changed the Session default to cake, with the same timeout.</p>

<pre><code>Configure::write('Session', array(
   'defaults' =&gt; 'cake',
   'timeout' =&gt; 4320,
));

Configure::write('Security.level', 'medium');
</code></pre>

<p>However, while this should leave me logged in for 3 days, I find I barely get 3 hours before I need to log in again.</p>

<p>Is there an issue with Session timeouts that I should be aware of, or is the timeout in seconds (not minutes?) or is it being influenced by the Security.level like in 1.3? I haven't been able to find any hard documentation about how this works in 2.0, or what could be causing the issues.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
For anyone coming in later and seeing this. There is a bug in 2.0.5 where the Session timeout was not saving the value in Config.write();</p>

<p>To solve, update to 2.0.6 (or 2.1 when it leaves beta)</p>

<p>This shouldn't work as <code>file2.py</code> is in <code>subdir1</code>, but my current working directory is two levels above that. Additionally, all of the <code>__init__.py</code> files are empty.</p>

A really <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11085308/changing-the-background-drawable-of-the-searchview-widget"">insightful so answer</a> to this problem has already been posted, and I learned immensely from it.</p>

<p>There is one gap in my understanding though, and I'm hoping someone can explain it to me.  When I create a theme, such as the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;resources xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
    &lt;style name=""MyCustomTheme"" parent=""android:Theme""&gt;
        &lt;item name=""android:searchViewTextField""&gt;@android:color/white&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Eclipse compiles with an error saying it doesn't know about the attribute:</p>

<pre><code>error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name: attr 'android:searchViewTextField'.
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I re-declare the attribute:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;resources xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
    &lt;declare-styleable name=""CustomSearchView""&gt;
        &lt;attr name=""android:searchViewTextField"" format=""reference"" /&gt;
    &lt;/declare-styleable&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Eclipse responds with an error saying:</p>

<pre><code>error: Attribute ""android:searchViewTextField"" has already been defined
</code></pre>

<p>Eclipse seems to be aware of the attribute, but conveniently forgets about that attribute when I want to use it.  (I wonder if there is some context switching going on in the background)</p>

<p>At any rate, if I delete the problem code then I can see my custom theme inheriting searchViewTextField from its parent.  I just don't understand why I can't supplant it with my own.</p>

<p>(The other answer mentions android.R.stylable, but that file is obsolete in api 16)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

now, i tried a lot of different ways to call some function in my code but the ways i find it works (performselector:withobject:afterdelay) are get into the function immediately and i need the function to make some ""if's"" after random times.
Well you can see the code in here-</p>

<pre><code>{ 
    ""_id"" : 0, 
    ""nome"" : ""CIDADE0"", 
    ""qtdhab"" : 1231043

<p>So, here's what I want to do. I'm trying to do the equivalent of this SQL query in MongoDB:</p>

<p>Basically, I want the <strong>biggest</strong> value of the field <strong>qtdhab</strong> from the collection <strong>cidade</strong> which follows the condition of being <strong>lower than the average value</strong> of the same field <strong>qtdhab</strong> on the same collection <strong>cidade</strong>. So, I have mapped this into 3 queries, like this:</p>

<pre><code>var resultado = db.cidade.aggregate({""$group"": {""_id"": null, ""avgHab"": {""$avg"": ""$qtdhab""}}}).toArray()
var resultado2 = db.cidade.find({qtdhab: {$lte: resultado[0].avgHab}}).toArray()
resultado2.aggregate({""$group"": {""_id"": null, ""maxHab"": {""$max"": ""$qtdhab""}}})
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, as I found out the hard way, that there is no <strong>.aggregate</strong> method for an array such as <strong>resultado2</strong>, so the last query returns an error. Is there any other way for me to get the <strong>biggest value</strong> for the field <strong>qtdhab</strong> out of this array of documents that was generated by these 2 queries?</p>

<p>Doing a hexdump on the data file I'm reading in shows the spaces are spaces as expected and no stray characters before or after the text I'm matching.  Any suggestions on debugging this?</p>

<p>I've done a bit of a code change just to test my expression itself, and now I'm more confused.  Within the loop, I'm now checking to see if the string matches the pattern first, then running it through the compiled version:</p>

<p>Solution is to add "".matches()"" check as below:</p>

<pre><code>Matcher Dmatch = DLVRYrx.matcher(DATAstr);
Dmatch.matches();
String data1 = Dmatch.group(0);

<p>Yes, I'm using that in an 'if' statement in my code, but leaving it free-hanging as above works fine.</p>

<p>When the user informs a Vimeo URL i do the following steps:</p>

<p>1- Get the XML file from ""vimeo.com/api/oembed.xml?url=[encoded_url]""</p>

<p>2- Get the ""video_id"" property from the file, with the video id (i can open the video in the browser with ""vimeo.com/[video_id]"", for instance)</p>

<p>3- Generate the embed video URL from the video id, just doing ""player.vimeo.com/video/[video_id]""</p>

<p>4- Get the XML file from ""vimeo.com/api/v2/video/[video_id].xml""</p>

<p>5- Get the ""thumbnail_medium"" property from the file, with the video thumbnail</p>

<hr>

<p>WORKS FINE:</p>

<p>When i try, for instance, with the video ""vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/130537730"" i do:</p>

<p>1- Get the XML file from ""vimeo.com/api/oembed.xml?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fchannels%2Fstaffpicks%2F130537730"" - OK</p>

<p>2- Get the ""video_id"" property from the file - OK - Returns ""130537730"" (the video ""vimeo.com/130537730"" works fine) </p>

<p>3- Generate the embed video URL from the video id: ""player.vimeo.com/video/130537730"" - OK - Works fine</p>

<p>4- Get the XML file from ""vimeo.com/api/v2/video/130537730.xml"" - OK</p>

<p>5- Get the ""thumbnail_medium"" property from the file - OK - Returns ""i.vimeocdn.com/video/536785976_200x150.jpg""</p>

<hr>

<p>ERROR (THE FILE DOESN'T EXIST):</p>

<p>If i try it with the video with the URL ""vimeo.com/ondemand/bendingsteel"" (it's a trailer) i do:</p>

<p>1- Get the XML file from ""vimeo.com/api/oembed.xml?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fondemand%2Fbendingsteel"" - OK</p>

<p>2- Get the ""video_id"" property from the file - OK - Returns ""134429740"" (the video ""vimeo.com/134429740"" works fine) </p>

<p>3- Generate the embed video URL from the video id: ""player.vimeo.com/video/134429740"" - OK - Works fine</p>

<p>4- Get the XML file from ""vimeo.com/api/v2/video/134429740.xml"" - ERROR - I don't get the file</p>

<hr>

<p>Workaround (I don't think it's a good alternative):</p>

<p>The XML file from ""vimeo.com/api/oembed.xml?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fondemand%2Fbendingsteel"" have a ""thumbnail_url"" property that returns a video thumbnail, and i got ""i.vimeocdn.com/video/527925293_1280.jpg"", but I wanted a smaller image for thumbnail. </p>

<p>Based on the thumbnail of the first video I manually changed the thumbnail of the second video to ""i.vimeocdn.com/video/527925293_200x150.jpg"" and it worked fine, but I don't think that this is a good approach and I don't know if this will work in all cases.</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't know if i did something wrong, or if there's a better approach, or if this occurs because the video is a trailer, but i think this is a weird behaviour because everything else works fine. </p>

<p>I also tried with the video ""vimeo.com/36031564"" (it's not a trailer) and it worked fine, but with the video ""vimeo.com/ondemand/ashestoagassiz"" (it's a trailer) the same error occured, so i think this error will happen with trailers.</p>

<p>I tried with other types than XML but i still didn't get the file.</p>

<p>Any suggestion?</p>

<p>After this rendering is done, I would like to invoke a javscript. How to do that? I am using a form_remote_tag from the view.</p>

<p>The render partial is done in Ajax context, no page reloads will happen. The form_remote_tag has a :success method where I can call a javascript. Unfortunately, the javascript that I put in the success method is getting called 'before' the rendering is done. But, I need to invoke a javascript 'after' the rendering is complete.</p>

<p>I have simply put an alert message for clarity in Question. Actually I am calling a facebox() method on the DIV element that I am rendering. The facebox() (jQuery's) method should be applied to the DIV element after it is rendered only then it will be effective.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I have added the complete code. If you can see, I am calling the javascript method handle_success once the Ajax returns. (I apologize for putting the :success method inside the partial). The handle_success is called before the actual rendering completes. That should be 'after' it completes</p>

<p>I am testing (with the sandbox of course) and have found that notifications are often delayed or not received at all. I am not talking about sending multiple messages and only the last one arriving, as the documentation indicates, but any notification never showing up.</p>

<p>Also, I noticed that if I send a notification with an alert, and then send one with just a badge number, that the second notification will close the alert even after it's already opened.  Does this happen between apps as well?  For instance, if I send an alert for my app, and then the Facebook app sends a badge, will the Facebook badge close my alert window?</p>

So here's my analogy from what I have learnt..</p>

<p>A society is like a Computer.</p>

<p>A building is like a Chip.</p>

<p>A floor on a particular building is a Core on that Chip. </p>

<p>So a building can be one floor (single core on single chip),</p>

<p>One building multiple floors (multicore on a single chip), </p>

<p>Many building, many floors each(multiprocessor with multicore)</p>

<p>A flat in a particular floor is a Process.</p>

<p>A person living in a room in a particular flat is a thread.</p>

<p>People living in a particular flat, share the same space. i.e. each thread in a process share the same address space.</p>

<p>Each person shares few common things in the room like a kitchen, shower area etc i.e. each thread in a process share code, data, files</p>

<p>Shower room in a particular flat needs synchronisation between people (threads) living in that flat. As only one can use at a time.</p>

<p>Each person has its own personal set of things which he does not share with others, his underwear for example ;) (a thread has its own stack, registers)</p>

<p>A person can call new friends to his flat. i.e. A thread may spawn new threads for his her wishes (maybe the thread is bored lol)</p>

<p>The owner of the building, can shut down any room, create new rooms, or assign new tenants or chuck them out. Kernel can assign new process, and create destroy threads too.</p>

<p>......</p>

<p>Guys let me know if I got the analogy right. If anything else I can add to make it more clear or make it correct. </p>

<p>The only problem I see is when a process having many threads run on different cores... Any ideas how to include that in the analogy..?</p>

<p>Let me know. Thanks a lot. :)</p>

<p>I have a listbox filled with items from an ObservableCollection.
It is showed in my first view. </p>

<p>By selecting an item in the list the user goes to a another view.
I swap this view in, so the first one is not in the xaml tree.</p>

<p>In the second view they can perform actions.
One of the actions makes the item go away from the top list (like passing the item on to another user).</p>

<p>The first view listens for that event and can remove the item from the list.
Items.Remove(item)
Problem is that the item doesn't always disappear from the ListBox (but it does from the underlying list, I've checked with debug). I think it might have something to do with the view not being displayed at the moment the collection is updated. I've tested with setting SelectedItem to null, thinking that selection might keep it there after removal, but it made no difference.</p>

<p>Using this method I came up with this detection:</p>

def wall_detect(x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2):
    if (x2+w2&gt;=x1&gt;=x2 and y2+h2&gt;=y1&gt;=y2):
        return True
    elif (x2+w2&gt;=x1+w1&gt;=x2 and y2+h2&gt;=y1&gt;=y2):
        return True
    elif (x2+w2&gt;=x1&gt;=x2 and y2+h2&gt;=y1+h1&gt;=y2):
        return True
    elif (x2+w2&gt;=x1+w1&gt;=x2 and y2+h2&gt;=y1+h1&gt;=y2):
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>I have been trying to use for loops to loop through trees to detect if player (a rectangle) crosses into the trees but I cant think of anything.</p>

<p>I've tried</p>

<pre><code>    for i in trees:
        collision = wall_detect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height, i.x, i.y, i.width, i.height)
    player.update(collision)
</code></pre>

<p>player.update(collision) changes the rectangle to red if collision = true and leaves it black if false.</p>

<p>I've tried using for and if e.g:</p>

<pre><code>for i in trees:
        if wall_detect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height, i.x, i.y, i.width, i.height) == wall_detect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height, t1.x, t1.y, t1.width, t1.height):
            collision = wall_detect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height, t1.x, t1.y, t1.width, t1.height)
           player.update(collision)

        if wall_detect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height, i.x, i.y, i.width, i.height) == wall_detect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height, t2.x, t2.y, t2.width, t2.height):
            collision = wall_detect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height, t2.x, t2.y, t2.width, t2.height)
            player.update(collision)

<p>I have a Wordpress site hosted with 1and1.com, and since upgrading to Wordpress 3.7.1 I have been experiencing errors with the uploaded media - specifically images.</p>

<p>When large images are uploaded and inserted in the post, they are given <code>width='1'</code> and <code>height='1'</code> values, which I have diagnosed to be an error caused by a failure of the media upload/crunching in the first place.</p>

<p>By testing uploads of varying filesizes and dimensions, I have discovered the errors occur when an image is over approximately 2.2 megapixels (tested successfully at 1700x1275, failure at 1800x1350) regardless of filesize. When an image is too large, the image uploads successfully in its original form, but the processing of thumbnails, medium and large versions fails and the Media Uploader returns ""An error occurred in the upload. Please try again later.""</p>

<p>After researching the problem, I have tested the following to no avail:</p>

<p>1) Disabling all plug-ins</p>

<p>2) Re-installing WordPress</p>

<p>3) Creating a php.ini file to increase memory-limit (tested <code>memory-limit = 64M</code>, <code>memory-limit = 128M</code>, <code>memory-limit = 256M</code> and <code>memory-limit = 1024M</code>). N.B. I also altered the maximum upload size in the php.ini file to test whether it was in the right directory, which it was.</p>

<p>I don't have access to Apache Error Logging as the hosting is on a shared server.</p>

<p>Also looking back through media/posts, it seems large images have been uploading incorrectly since the site was launched a few years ago, so the error is nothing to do with Wordpress 3.7.1. However, only in 3.7.1 are they displayed with <code>width='1'</code> and <code>height='1'</code> values, seemingly when it can't find medium, large or thumb versions? </p>

<p>If I can't find a way to get the image uploading/crunching to work, is there a workaround that could help with the <code>width='1'</code> and <code>height='1'</code> being outputted?</p>

<p>If so, does that also mean that if I want to handle more than 3 concurrent web requests, then I'll have to get more servers to handle the load using a load balancer?

I am using this bit of code from <a href=""http://codyhouse.co/gem/3d-rotating-navigation/"" rel=""nofollow"">Codyhouse</a> to add a navigation to my page.  The basics of it are, clicking the hamburger opens it, then when you click on a link, it should scroll the page to that location, while closing the menu.  </p>

<p>This all works fine, but because the animation is using transform: <code>translateY(170px);</code>, the link is finding it's position, but when it gets to it, the page has been moved 170px, resulting in being 170px below where it needs to be on screen.</p>

<p>My idea for the fix was to delay the clicking on the link until the animation was finished, which lasts .5 seconds, and then go to the point on the page.  </p>

<p>This is my script,</p>

<pre><code>$('.nav-click').click(function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();                   
    var goTo = this.getAttribute(""href""); 
    setTimeout(function(){
        window.location = goTo;
    },2000);       
}); 
</code></pre>

On the first fire of my code it works perfect but I reload the submit button using javascript (rather then refreshing the page).  Everything that doesn't have to do with ajax runs fine on the second click but I can not for the life of me get the ajax to run the next time the button is clicked.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#edit_company_basic"").live('click', function()
    {
        //get current value of button
        var btnText = $(""#submit_company_update"").val();

//on click the button becomes disabled and value changes to Please Wait
        $(""#submit_company_update"").attr(""disabled"", true);
        $(""#submit_company_update"").attr(""value"", ""Please wait"");

//this one add a loader gif and a updating company message

        var tickets = $(""#tickets :selected"").text();

            type: ""POST"",  
            url: ""library/update_company.php"",  
            data: dataString,  
            success: function() 
            {  

//On success I give the loader a little more time before anything happens I then re-enable the button allowing the user to be able to click it and give them a message that the copmany has been successfully updated.
            setTimeout(function(){$(""#submit_company_update"").attr(""value"", btnText); $(""#submit_company_update"").removeAttr('disabled'); $(""#update"").html(""&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color='green'&gt;Company has been updated&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;""); }, 1550);

//Here I just give the company updated message a few seconds before I remove it.
                setTimeout(function(){$(""#update"").fadeOut(1000); }, 2200);
            }
        });  

    });
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my html that is involved in all that jscript</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td colspan=""2"" id=""submit_form""&gt;&lt;div id=""button_container""&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submit_company_update"" id=""submit_company_update"" value=""Edit Company"" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas how I can make the ajax run again once the button is re-enabled?  Whats happening is once I re-enable the button to be clicked again it won't run the ajax.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

I have a <code>Question</code> object, setup with spring-boot, spring-data-rest and spring-hateoas. All the basics work fine. I would like to add a custom controller that returns a <code>List&lt;Question&gt;</code> in exactly the same format that a GET to my <code>Repository</code>'s <code>/questions</code> url does, so that the responses between the two are compatible.</p>

<p>Here is my controller:</p>

<pre><code>@Controller
public class QuestionListController {

    @Autowired private QuestionRepository questionRepository;

    @Autowired private PagedResourcesAssembler&lt;Question&gt; pagedResourcesAssembler;

    @Autowired private QuestionResourceAssembler questionResourceAssembler;

    @RequestMapping(
            value = ""/api/questions/filter"", method = RequestMethod.GET,
            consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE,
            produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public @ResponseBody PagedResources&lt;QuestionResource&gt; filter(
            @RequestParam(value = ""filter"", required = false) String filter,
            Pageable p) {

        // Using queryDSL here to get a paged list of Questions
        Page&lt;Question&gt; page = 
            questionRepository.findAll(
                QuestionPredicate.findWithFilter(filter), p);

        // Option 1 - default resource assembler
        return pagedResourcesAssembler.toResource(page);

        // Option 2 - custom resource assembler
        return pagedResourcesAssembler.toResource(page, questionResourceAssembler);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 1: Rely on the provided <code>SimplePagedResourceAssembler</code></strong></p>

<p>The problem with this option is none of the necessary <code>_links</code> are rendered. If there was a fix for this, it would be the easiest solution.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: Implement my open resource assembler</strong></p>

<p>The problem with this option is that implementing <code>QuestionResourceAssembler</code> according to the <a href=""https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas"">Spring-Hateoas documentation</a> leads down a path where the <code>QuestionResource</code> ends up being a near-duplicate of <code>Question</code>, and then the assembler needs to manually copy data between the two objects, and I need to build all the relevant <code>_links</code> by hand. This seems like a lot of wasted effort.</p>

<p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>

<p>I know Spring has already generated the code to do all this when it exports the <code>QuestionRepository</code>. Is there any way I can tap into that code and use it, to ensure the output from my controller is seamless and interchangeable with the generated responses?</p>

    The problem is that when I used the above template and views.py, by        clicking the div area, it doesn't link to any website. But without using ajax, I can make the div area link to other website using div onclick event.
I think I may have something wrong with the above ajax in the template or     views.py when using ajax.</p>

<p>Did I write my template right? How do I modify views.py to connect views.py and ajax?</p>

Pretty sure I'm getting a segmentation fault because of an incorrect pointer or something, but for the life of me, I don't understand where I'm doing it wrong. The program works when the user input is '5 5', anything other than that causes the program to act weird and often times fail with a segmentation fault. Matrix A and B should be filled with random numbers, and Matrix C should sum matrix A and B, all the while using dynamic memory allocation. I'm not familiar with allocs, I've just started to understand pointers and 2D arrays. Can somebody explain what I'm doing wrong. Here's the whole code.</p>

<p>I'm trying to include a <code>.so</code> library that came with a <code>.jar</code> wrapper for the native functions in the <code>.so</code>. When I extract the jar with winrar I can see that it only contains <code>.class</code> files - is this normal?</p>

<p>I am working with Eclipse and have created a new project and added the <code>.so</code> file to the <code>libs/armeabi</code> folder and the <code>.jar</code> to my project. <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YAzTG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I've set the properties so that the Native library location is set to the <code>libs/armeabi</code> folder.</p>

<p>I've also removed the Build Options to <code>Automatically refresh Resources and Assets folder on build</code> aswell as <code>Force error when external jars contain native libraries</code> though I believe the second is not my error at the moment.</p>

<p>I'm using this code to try to load the program to my phone.</p>

<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    static {
        Log.w(""MYAPP"", ""About to load library."");
        System.loadLibrary(""libjdns_sd"");
        Log.w(""MYAPP"", ""Library loaded."");
    } 

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    }

    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_main, menu);

    }

For that I have gone through <a href=""http://www.androidhive.info/2014/02/android-login-with-google-plus-account-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a> and I could implement it in my app. But the problem here is , whole code is within the activity itself. I need to have a seperate class which handles the Google Plus login , so that from the activity , once the sign in button clicked ,  I can call the instance of that class for sign in and after login i would get one one callback in the activity. So my activity won't be mixed up with login code. I tried the same by creating a class <code>GoogleLogin</code> and in the constructor  I replaced all the 'GoogleApiClient' initialization which were there in the onCreate() and onStart() of the activity.
But it gives me NullPointerException here</p>

<pre><code> private void resolveSignInError() {
    if (mConnectionResult.hasResolution()) {
        try {
            mIntentInProgress = true;
            mConnectionResult.startResolutionForResult(this, RC_SIGN_IN);
        } catch (SendIntentException e) {
            mIntentInProgress = false;
            mGoogleApiClient.connect();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>here i'm getting NullPointerException in <code>mConnectionResult</code></p>

<p>Then I followed <a href=""https://dzone.com/articles/jrebel-unloaded"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>. Here they have made a seperate class for it and it is working fine. But problem here is I can't set the sign in button click listener in activity. They are passing the sign in button to Login handler class and there implementing click listener.</p>

<pre><code>gLogin = new GooglePlusLoginUtils(this, R.id.activity_login_gplus);
</code></pre>

<p>What I need is I need to implement the sign in button click in the activity itself. Is there any simple way to implement this.</p>

When user scrolls to the end of the list, he taps on ""load more items"" and then another 30 elements are loaded and appended to the existing list. When he taps on an element, a dialog is shown with info,etc! When the user closes the dialog, the list is refreshed and first 30 items are loaded. This is annoying because it's a very long list (~1300 elements). </p>

<p>After some googling the only good implementations I can find are based around having using the machine key for security or the question and answer functionality.</p>

<p>The problems with those implementations is I already have a rather large userbase.  I cannot swap my passwords to machine key now as I am using a hash system already.</p>

<pre><code>passwordFormat=""Hashed""
</code></pre>

<p>I also do not want to force existing users to add a question and answer after the fact.  Question and answer is also less ideal as if they forget that info as well they are out of luck.</p>

<p>My ideal implementation is a user would click forgot password, enter their username or email(ideally email).  They would then receive an email with either their current password(I believe this is impossible with the hash method I am using), a new randomized password they are told to change, or a link with a token that lets them reset the password once clicking it.</p>

<p>Are there any good guides out there for doing this quickly?  Everything I can find either relates to using a machine key method or question and answer.  I'm quite surprised I couldn't find anything as this is very common web functionality.  I was surprised it's not even a part of the default membership provider that MVC comes with.</p>

<p>I realize the token is the most secure followed by the randomized password, but for now I'm pretty open to any of those 3 scenarios.</p>

<p>If you need any more info please let me know.</p>

<p>Lucene's own <code>QueryParser</code> seems to evaluate <code>""AND (NOT""</code> into the same kind of object trees.</p>

<p>This is my simple example with datetime (i know there are more efficent way for clone datetime object, but that is not my concern, what i need to do is clone a generic built object, datetimes are only an example) that semplificate my real clone method to a method that only shallow copy function and array but deep copy object (except for internal array and function) and not avoid circular reference.
This is only a dimostration of the error (the same error i obtain with the complete clone function).</p>

<p>CODE :</p>

</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>But this cause this type error when try to access to getDay method :
Uncaught TypeError: this is not a Date object. </p>

<p>But i still do not understand why, cloned appear like date object, i know that methods are shared, i'am expecting strange behaviour when invoked (method refer to the object called ""date"", so the object internal state is ""date"" not ""cloned"") but not an error.</p>

<p>So why this error?</p>

<p>Thanks for help and sorry for my bad english.</p>

<p>Edited</p>

<p>According with the new idea suggested (both form RobG and form article posted by jfriend00 in the comment) to me i rewrite the clone function i that way.</p>

<pre><code>                    function clone ( obj )
        {
            if ( obj instanceof Array )
                return [] ;

            if ( obj instanceof Function )
                return obj ;

            if ( obj instanceof Object )
            {
                var result = new obj.constructor() ;

                result.__proto__ = clone ( obj.__proto__ ) ;

                var elems = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj) ;
                var len = elems.length ;
                for ( var i = 0 ; i &lt; len ; i++  )
                {
                    var prop = elems[i] ;

            }

<p>Now seems to work how i expected, but i do not understand why this piece of code :
    var result = new obj.constructor() ;
make the difference.</p>

<p>I have several question, 
the first one is how should i architecting the python and QML interaction.</p>

<p>The second is i'm using a Loader to switch some panel on click event. But if i switch panel1 to panel2 and i switch again panel2 and panel1 my click event isn't connect anymore with my PyQtSignal. I guess i'm using the loader the wrong way and i should drive it from python but i don't know how. What should i do ? </p>

<p>I know i'm doing something wrong and can't find good resources to help me.
If you know some good tutorial or source code, i'll take it !</p>

<p>I have lot of information but this is little description:</p>

<pre><code>http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/ed2dd/4
</code></pre>

<p>Here my models:</p>

<pre><code> class Policy &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   has_many :insurances
 end

 class Insurance &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   belongs_to :policy
 end
</code></pre>

<p>This is my controller:</p>

<pre><code>class PolicyController &lt; ApplicationController
     def calculator

        @business = PolicyBusinessUnit.find(:all)

        @euros = Policy.find_by_sql([""SELECT i1.type_money, SUM( i1.net_insurance ) total

        WHERE i1.type_money = 2 
        AND p.deleted= 0 
        AND p.policy_business_unit_id = ? AND p.state = ?
        GROUP BY i1.type_money"" ,params[:busi].to_i,params[:state].to_i  ])
     end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is my view showing my status in a combobox:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;% form_tag :controller=&gt;""policy"",:action=&gt;""calculator"" do %&gt;
      Business:
      &lt;%= select_tag ""busi"",options_for_select(@business.collect {|t| [t.name.to_s,t.id]},  params[:busi].to_i ) %&gt;

      Status:
      &lt;%= select_tag ""state"",options_for_select([ [""OK"",0],[""CANCEL"",1] ],params[:state].to_i) %&gt;
      &lt;%= submit_tag ""SEARCH"", :name =&gt; nil %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;

  Sum Euros:
  &lt;input id=""euros"" readonly=""readonly"" value=""&lt;%= @euros[0].total""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I'm getting this message:</p>

<pre><code>  undefined method `total' for nil:NilClass
</code></pre>

<p>But, when I tried this it's working fine when I don't use <code>params[busi]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    @dolares= Policy.find_by_sql([""SELECT sum(i1.net_insurance) total 
        FROM (SELECT max(id) id FROM insurances GROUP BY policy_id)i2
        JOIN insurances i1 USING (id)
        JOIN policies p ON p.id = i1.policy_id
        WHERE i1.type_money = 2 
        AND p.deleted= 0 
        AND p.policy_business_unit_id = 2 AND p.state = ?
        GROUP BY i1.type_money"" , params[:state].to_i  ])
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing, when I removed <code>total</code> here and I used my controller with 2 params:</p>

<pre><code>    @dolares= Policy.find_by_sql([""SELECT sum(i1.net_insurance) total 
        FROM (SELECT max(id) id FROM insurances GROUP BY policy_id)i2
        JOIN insurances i1 USING (id)
        JOIN policies p ON p.id = i1.policy_id
        WHERE i1.type_money = 2 
        AND p.deleted= 0 
        AND p.policy_business_unit_id = ? AND p.state = ?
        GROUP BY i1.type_money"" , params[:busi].to_i,params[:state].to_i  ])

   &lt;input id=""euros"" readonly=""readonly"" value=""&lt;%= @euros[0]""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I GOT <code>#&lt;Policy:0x7f41d09909d0&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>After that i added 'total' again and i got the value without problems</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;input id=""euros"" readonly=""readonly"" value=""&lt;%= @euros[0].total""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe I need to add a conditional? What is wrong?</p>

It is a date and time at the end.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is using a regex I would like to find the / and :

<pre><code>[0-9]{2}[/][0-9]{2}[/][0-9]{4}:[0-9]{2}[:][0-9]{2}
</code></pre>

<p>This finds 2 digits then <code>/</code> followed by 2 digits then <code>/</code> and so on.</p>

<p>I would like to replace <code>/</code> and <code>:</code> with <code>_</code>.</p>

<p>Can I do this in Python using import re? I need some help with the syntax please.</p>

<p>My method which returns the date is:</p>

<pre><code>def get_datetime_now(self):
            dateTime_now = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(""%x%X"")
            print dateTime_now #prints e.g. 05/20/1515:11:38
            return dateTime_now

<p>My code snippet for entering the project name into the text field is:</p>

<pre><code>project_name_textfield.send_keys('LADEMO_IE_' + self.get_datetime_now())

Those days it was easy making the backgrounds of the game pieces transparent using TImage.Transparent := true, but in Firemonkey I don't find it so easy. I have learned that designtime allows you to easily set the TransparentColor, and then the object background is just as transparent as you wanted it to, but how can one make this happen runtime?

<p>However, when trying to select number-type inputs in jQuery with <code>$('input[type=""number""]')</code>, IE9 doesn't actually select anything because its type-attribute has changed to text.  This is not the case for other input types it does not support, such as date and time, where it will leave the type-attribute as-is but just change its type-property to text.</p>

<p>This is where i get a little stuck, while executing the build using gradle, i get the following error:</p>

<p>Though when you enter in:

Let me elaborate it further. I have a ""MergeSort.h"" file in which I have my mergesort algorithm as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef _MSORT_H_
#define _MSORT_H_

void merge(int a[],int lo,int mi,int hi){
    int n1 = (mi - lo) +1;
    int n2 = hi - mi;
    int left[n1];
    int right[n2];
    int i;
    int j;
    int k;
    for(i = 0;i &lt; n1;i++){
        left[i] = a[lo+i];
    }
    for(j = 0;j &lt; n2;j++){
        right[j] = a[mi+j+1];
    }
    i = 0;
    j = 0;
    for(k = lo;k &lt;= hi;k++){
        if(left[i] &lt; right[j]){
            a[k] = left[i];
            i = i + 1;
        }else{
            a[k] = right[j];
            j = j+1;
        }
    }

}

void msorthelper(int a[],int p,int r){
    if(p &lt; r){
        int mid = (p + r)/2;
        msorthelper(a,0,mid);
        msorthelper(a,mid+1,r);
        merge(a,p,mid,r);
    }
}

void msortex(int a[],int size){
    msorthelper(a,0,size-1);
    int counter;
    for(counter = 0;counter &lt; size;counter++){
        printf("" %d "",a[counter]);
    }
}
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>I have my corresponding sort tester in sorttester.c:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include ""mergesort.h""

int main(){

    int out[] = {8,1,6};
    msortex(out,3);

}
</code></pre>

<p>The output from running the sorttester is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1  0  0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now here's the interesting part, when I put any printf statement to the beginning of the merge, the correct output is generated. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>    #ifndef _MSORT_H_
    #define _MSORT_H_

    void merge(int a[],int lo,int mi,int hi){
        printf(""Hello\n""); 
        int n1 = (mi - lo) +1;
        int n2 = hi - mi;
        int left[n1];
        int right[n2];
        .................Rest of the code.....
</code></pre>

<p>The output now is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HelloHello 1  6  8</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the correct sorted order for the array 8 6 1.</p>

<p>Can somebody tell me what I might be doing wrong here that is causing the output to be drastically by the presence of a printf?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

I've set it up to work in a subfolder, so I access it with localhost/zftutorial URL.</p>

<p>Now the time came for debugging, but when I execute debugger in Eclipse, it appends debug URL params (like XDEBUG_SESSION_START=ECLIPSE_DBGP) which break everything and I start getting this message:</p>

<p><strong>> *Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Exception: Invalid controller specified (index.php) in C:\Program Files\VertrigoServ\www\library\Zend\library\Zend\Controller\Dispatcher\Standard.php on line 241*</strong></p>

<p>I've tried to set both localhost/zftutorial and localhost/zftutorial/public/index.php as start URLs for debugger, but still getting the same message.</p>

<p>Looks like ZF likes clean URL names, but Eclipse wants scripts with php extensions, but controller names.  Whichever debug options I use, Ecplise tries to start debugging from
not Zend-style URL - <em><a href=""http://localhost/zftutorial/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/zftutorial/index.php</a></em></p>

<p>I guess this can be solved 2 ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>configuring Eclipse somehow to use a proper URL with debug params, like localhost/zftutorial</li>
<li>setting rewrite rule for localhost/zftutorial/public/index.php to be rewritten as localhost/zftutorial (right?) </li>

A button is pressed on my home page that executes some code via Ajax, and returns its results beneath the button without loading a new page. The results wait for a user to input some text in a field and press ""submit"". Those results Look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li class=""item""&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Email: &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a&gt;@email.tail.init&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Name: &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a&gt;@name&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Linkedin: &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;form class=""linkedinForm"" action=""@routes.Application.createLinkedin"" method=""POST""&gt;
                &lt;input type=""number"" class=""id"" name=""id"" value=""@id"" readonly&gt;
                &lt;input type=""text"" class=""email"" name=""email"" value=""@email"" /&gt;
                &lt;input type=""text"" class=""emailsecondary"" name=""emailsecondary"" value="""" /&gt;
                &lt;input type=""text"" class=""name"" name=""email"" value=""@name"" /&gt;
                &lt;input type=""text"" class=""linkedin"" name=""linkedin"" value="""" /&gt;
                &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""submit"" class=""hideme""/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;form action=""@routes.Application.delete(id)"" method=""POST""&gt;
                &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""delete"" /&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Along with some jquery that slides up a li after submission:</p>

<pre><code> $(document).ready(function(){
        $("".hideme"").click(function(){
               $(this).closest('li.item').slideUp();
                });
            });
</code></pre>

<p>However, since a form POST goes inside an Action that must a return an Ok(...) or Redirect(...) I can't get the page to not reload or redirect. Right now my Action looks like this (which doesn't compile):</p>

<pre><code>newLinkedinForm.bindFromRequest.fold(
errors =&gt; {
  Ok(""didnt work"" +errors)
},
linkedin =&gt; {
  addLinkedin(linkedin.id, linkedin.url, linkedin.email, linkedin.emailsecondary, linkedin.name)
    if (checkURL(linkedin.url)) {
      linkedinParse ! Linkedin(linkedin.id, linkedin.url, linkedin.email, linkedin.emailsecondary, linkedin.name)
      Ok(views.html.index)
    }else{
     Ok(views.html.index)
    }
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to return Ok(...) without redirecting or reloading? If not how would you do a form POST while staying on the same page?</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is my attempt at handling form submission with jquery so far:</p>

<pre><code> $(document).ready(function(){
        $("".linkedinForm"").submit(function( event ) {
            var formData = {
                'id'                : $('input[name=id]').val(),
                'name'              : $('input[name=name]').val(),
                'email'             : $('input[name=email']).val(),
                'emailsecondary'    : $('input[name=emailsecondary]').val(),
                'url'               : $('input[name=url]').val()
            };

            jsRoutes.controllers.Application.createLinkedin.ajax({
                type     :'POST',
                data     : formData

            })

            .done(function(data) { 

                console.log(data);

            });

            .fail(function(data) {

                console.log(data);
            });

            event.preventDefault();
            };

<p>The subtasks I fire off using <code>race</code> themselves invoke <code>runInteractiveProcess</code> to run (non-Haskell) executables. The idea is to run different external programs and take the result of the first one to finish. In a sense, Haskell ""orchestrates"" a bunch of external programs.</p>

<p>What I'm observing is that while <code>race</code> works correctly by killing the Haskell level ""slower"" thread; the sub-processes spawned from the slow thread itself continue to run. </p>

<p>I suspect expecting <code>race</code> to kill processes spawned this way is a bit unrealistic, as they probably become zombies and get inherited by init. For my purposes however, keeping the external processes running defeats the whole purpose of using <code>race</code> in the first place.</p>

<p>Is there an alternative way of using <code>race</code> so the subprocesses created this way get killed as well? While I don't have a use case yet, it'd be best if the entire chain of processes created from the <code>race</code>d tasks get killed; as one can imagine those external programs themselves creating a bunch of processes as well.</p>

<p>Then I could use a ""use"" statement to reference these elements.
ie. use my_lib.
But would the my_library_file need to be located in the same project?</p>

<p>I would like to be able to make this library once and be able to reference in
any project with a call. </p>

<p>Ideally it could be called like an IEEE library but with many vhd files being referenced.</p>

<p>I would prefer not to explicitly add/include these individual source files to the project, but would instead prefer to just be able to use the “use” clause with library and/or package…if possible.</p>

I am approaching the problem by focusing on Identifying all the resources that I have and what the various HTTP verbs will do them, their URI and the JSON representations of those resources. </p>

<p>I am looking for the best design for securing the backend. Here is the list of designs I have considered. I am looking for alternative designs not listed below, and pros, cons recommendations. The system will be implemented with Spring 3.0 and possibly Spring Security 3.0, SSL will be used for many parts of the system but not for all of them, so some requests may come on SSL and some might not. </p>

<p>Option 1: Use the HTTP session</p>

<p>Show a standard login screen, create a server side session and let tomcat send back a jsessionid cookie and have the ajax client include the JSESSIONID cookie on every XHR request. This options just feels like it's the wrong approach for the following reasons. </p>

<ul>
<li>The connection becomes statefull which is against the rules of REST</li>
<li>I want to be able to split the bakcend into multiple seperate WAR files which means i could have multiple HTTP sessions on the backend, if that is the case then this approach does not work. While I don't need the ability to split the backend into multiple apps today, I would prefer a design that allows for that possibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Option 2: Find an open source Java based security library that does this</p>

<p>Other than Spring security I have not found any other Java libraries, any recommendations are highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Option 3: Try to use an existing protocol like OAuth </p>

<p>In my very brief look at OAuth it seems that it is designed for authentication across sites where each site has it's own user database. In this system i want a global user database shared across all the backend ajax services.</p>

<p>Option 4: Use SAML and Shiboleth </p>

<p>This options seems over kill and hugely complex to setup and maintain. </p>

<p>Option 5: Send the username and password with every request</p>

<p>This requires that user sends their username and password with every request, which means that the front end AJAX app must store the username and password as a JavaScript object and if the user navigates away from the page then back the username/password combo will be gone and the user might be forced to log in again. I don't want the front end to try and put the username and password into cookie as that would comprise security. </p>

<p>Option 6: Implement my own authentication / Authorization protocol </p>

<p>Create a REST service that users can present their username/password combination to and then get back and security token, which they must send back to the service with every request. The security token would be digitally signed by the service and would have an expiry time. The token would be only good for most operations high security operations would require a new login screen as port of confirming the operation. </p>

<p>Problem with this approach is I have to invent yet another security protocol which seems like a total waste of time.</p>

<p>I am sure I am not the only person up against this problem, I hope the stack overflow community can point to some options and tools that I have not found yet.</p>

<p>I'm working on a web application utilizing AJAX to fetch content/data and what have you - nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>On the server-side certain events can happen that the client-side JavaScript framework needs to be notified about and vice versa. These events are not always related to the users immediate actions. It is not an option to wait for the next page refresh to include them in the document or to stick them in some hidden fields because the user might never submit a form.</p>

<p>Right now it is design in such a way that events to and from the server are riding a long with the users requests. For instance if the user clicks a 'view details' link this would fire a request to the server to fetch some HTML or JSON with details about the clicked item. Along with this request or rather the response, a server-side (invoked) event will return with the content.</p>

<h2>Question/issue 1:</h2>

<p>I'm unsure how to control the queue of events going to the server. They can ride along with user invoked events, but what if these does not occur, the events will get lost. I imagine having a timer setup up to send these events to the server in the case the user does not perform some action. What do you think?</p>

<h2>Question/issue 2:</h2>

<p>With regards to the responds, some being requested as HTML some as JSON it is a bit tricky as I would have to somehow wrap al this data for allow for both formalized (and unrelated) events and perhaps HTML content, depending on the request, to return to the client. Any suggestions? anything I should be away about, for instance returning HTML content wrapped in a JSON bundle?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Do you know of any framework that uses an approach like this, that I can look at for inspiration (that is a framework that wraps events/requests in a package along with data)?</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/28619434/971583"">This answer got me started</a>, but things seem to be different within a DataGrid.  The code works fine if I leave out the value converter, but if I put in the value converter, all I receive as input are empty strings.</p>

<p>Good but imperfect:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;DataGridTextColumn 
                Header=""Length"" 
                Binding=""{Binding XPath=length/@value}}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Junk:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;DataGridTextColumn 
                Header=""Length"" 
                Binding=""{Binding XPath=length, 
                          Converter={StaticResource valueFormattingConverter }}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have a theory that the above is giving me the element content for element ./length (it's an empty element), but I actually want the element ./length because the attributes need to be processed.</p>

<p>Good but for combo boxes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ComboBox Style=""{StaticResource ComboButtonStyle}"" Width=""200"" 
        Text=""{Binding Path=., Converter={StaticResource valueFormattingConverter }}""
          IsEditable=""True"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So with the Combo example, valueFormattingConverter.Convert gets called with an XmlElement (yay!).  With the DataGridTextColumn example, it's called with an empty string.</p>

<p>EDIT: ongoing research points to IMultiValueConverter as something I might want.</p>

After it finishes, you can see in the log that it sets the new video URL, but then SurfaceView throws an error and the VideoView just freezes with the last frame of the first video. Nothing else happens.
Any thoughts ? Thanks !</p>

<p>LE: Surprisingly, the OnPreparedListener gets called for the second video.</p>

<p>LE2: Sometimes the second video plays just fine, sometimes it doesn't... and I haven't changed a line of code between when it worked and when not. It's purely random... </p>

<p>LE3: Quick solution is add this line before you set the new video URL:</p>

<pre><code>mVideoView.setVisibility(View.GONE);
</code></pre>

<p>Code from OnCompletionListener:</p>

<pre><code>setCurrentPlaybackUrl(); // sets mCurrentMediaUrl to the second video URL
mVideoView.setVideoPath(mCurrentMediaUrl);
mVideoView.start();

<p>After reading <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13295609/how-generate-nodejs-express-dependencies-package-json"">this question on SO</a> I needed to add that dependency in the <code>package.json</code> . And to the version of ejs I ran <code>npm list</code> and got this, which looks like there might be more errors to address.  </p>

<p>After a couple tutorials I decided to try and build an event management system. Nothing like ambition, right? Events, Artists and Companies all should be able to upload a single image using Paperclip and nested forms. I've made a polymorphic Picture class and it works great for uploading/editing a picture for the Artist, but when I try to set it up for the Event, using the exact same code, I get an ""Unpermitted parameter: picture_attributes"" error...and nothing saves to the db. </p>

<p>I've been searching/reading for answers for the last 3 days and I'm totally stuck so I thought I'd throw my code up here and see if anyone can spot what I might be missing and help me figure out how to get this to work. </p>

<p>Here's the actual error code from my last attempt to upload an image to an event:</p>

<p>So...to me it looks like everything SHOULD work...but it doesn't. I'm probably missing something simple and hope someone out there can point it out for me.</p>

<p>FWIW...Last night while searching for answers I had a thought that it might be better to create a polymorphic Profile model and attach all images to those with a has_one relationship but even if that's the case...I'd really like some help figuring out why I can't get this to work now so I can learn what to look for going forward.

}

<p>I can tell you that it got the job done. But I also found some bad feedback at the forum where I found the idea for that algorithm, saying that ""it'll make your loop busy wait"" and that was a bad idea.

<li>Based on <code>RetrieveVirtualItemEventArgs.ItemIndex</code>, get the message from Cache</li>
<li>Set <code>RetrieveVirtualItemEventArgs.Item</code> = retreived item above</li>
</ol>

<p>It appears that what's done in the event handler is important because, if I take it out, ListView cries. What is the significance of this event?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Or let me re-phrase the question... My concern is, Why, after Sorting (and <code>RetrieveVirtualItem</code> event handler), the selected item remains at the location where it was before sorting. I.e, If I select item #5 and sort, and if sorting makes this item as the last item, I would prefer the LAST item to be selected after Sort. But in my case 5th item is selected after sort. So what is the default behavior of <code>RetrieveVirtualItem</code> WRT selected item?</p>

We are building an app using Mortar and Flow to simplify things and then all of the sudden we see that we can use some of the old fragments. This fragments are a little bit complex so we would like to somehow inject them to our Views.</p>

<p>Would that be possible if we have our Mortar View like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;com.foo.myMortarView xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:id=""+id/mortar_view""
    android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
    android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
    android:baselineAligned=""false""
    android:orientation=""horizontal"" &gt;

    &lt;fragment
        android:id=""@+id/myFragment""
        android:layout_width=""0dp""
        android:layout_weight=""2""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        class=""com.example.MyFragment"" &gt;
    &lt;/fragment&gt;

&lt;/com.foo.myMortarView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And our Fragment like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyFragment extends Fragment{
   @Override
   public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater,
      ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      /**
       * Inflate the layout for this fragment
       */
      return inflater.inflate(
      R.layout.my_fragment, container, false);
   }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>This of course doesn't work out of the box so how can we accomplish that? Thanks!</p>

<p>I intiialize them in a config file i include in every page:</p>

<pre><code>$user = new uFlex(false);
$admin = new admin();
</code></pre>

<p>But when using <code>$admin-&gt;adm_getUsers();</code> $row array it's empty.</p>

<p>Before to try to split the functions between 2 classes, i was using the same function on the main class, and was working.</p>

<p>It is the first time i try to extend a class.. i searched on google, and also readed some question here, but it is just too complicated for me to understand, since i'm still learning PHP.</p>

<p>It's my understanding that when I click the generated ""select"" link, the page posts back and the URL gets a parameter ""VendorClassID = selectrowindex"" added on. However, the value of the parameter seems to be the index of the selected row, which isn't particularly useful to me. Is there anyway to have the parameter value be set to a value from the selected row (ClassID, etc)? The @grid.SelectedRow doesn't seem to know anything about the row's data either, but I am new to MVC so perhaps there is a way to get the row data from there?</p>

The requirements was to make this form work via Ajax, all examples I found on Internet was form that related to node. </p>

<p>So when I tried to apply the same concept, I faced the problem of rendering the form, so I have passed it to the template as a parameter like this:</p>

<pre><code>$vars['node']-&gt;contactForm = drupal_get_form('nilecode_form');
</code></pre>

<p>When I render the form by using <code>drupal_render_children($node-&gt;contactForm)</code>, all the fields were rendered but with no wrapping form tag.</p>

<p>So after frustration, and not very useful IRC chats, I am thinking to do it by using normal Ajax request.</p>

<p>Before doing so is there any solution, before doing it the bad way?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<li>Restart the simulator.</li>

<p>Long explanation:</p>

<p>I have two ports open on web server: one is for normal HTTP communication, other is for Web Sockets, for instant server-to-browser communication. Currently I initialize socket with</p>

<pre><code>var UserID = &lt;%= current_user.id %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but consider this way to be insecure. Every authenticated user can replace user ID and receive messages intended for other user.</p>

<p>So I think that SessionID stored in cookie is much harder to guess and it could be extracted by JavaScript in some way and passed through Web Socket during initialization.</p>

<p>The task is to convert SessionID to UserID on server side.</p>

<p>Is sessionID storage accessible as a whole through some Devise methods?</p>

So, i have an abstract class for the towers that has an int for the range, the rate of fire, etc. 
And then i have a few child classes for the different type of towers. 
Im in the doubt of having an attribute of type GameObject in the tower class, that contains the Tower Game Object itself (for spawning the projectile, move the tower if necesary) or having the class with the attributes and then having a controller that controls the tower class atributes and also controls the game object itself(when need to move it, set active or not, etc).</p>

<p>I wish i made my self clear!
Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>Im not sure wich option would be better. </p>

<hr>

<p>Option 1:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Tower{
       private int health;
       ...
       private GameObject object;

      public HealthDown(){
          if(health &gt;1){ health -= 1;}
          else { object.SetActive(false);}
      }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Option 2:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Tower{
       private int health;
       ...

       public HealthDown(){
          if(health &gt;1){ health -= 1;}
      }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then a script that controlls the tower:</p>

<pre><code>public class Controller : MonoBehaviour {

     Tower tower;
     ...
     void Update(){ 
        if(tower.health &lt;= 1){this.gameObject.SetActive(false);}
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I wish now its more clear!</p>

<p>I've got a whole bunch of code that gets conditionally compiled for the SIMD level to be supported ( SSE2, AVX, AVX2 ).  This works fine if the build platform is the same as the runtime platform.  But it hinders reuse across different processor generations.</p>

<p>One thought is to have <code>executable</code> which calls <code>function</code> link to <code>libloader.so</code> that does not directly implement <code>function</code>. Rather, it resolves(binds?) that symbol from another loaded library e.g. <code>libimpl_sse2.so</code>, <code>libimpl_avx2.so</code> or so on depending on cpuflags.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of functions that need to be dynamically bound in this way, so changing the declarations or calling code is not practical.
The program linkage is fairly easy to change.  The runtime environment variables could also be changed, but I'd prefer not to.</p>

<p>I've gotten as far as making an executable that builds and starts with unresolved external symbols (UES) via the ld flag  <code>--unresolved-symbols=ignore-all</code>.  But subsequent loading of the impl lib does not change the value of the UES function from NULL.</p>

www.domainA.com/subfolderB/

</code></pre>

<p>On the pages (all pages are HTML5 doctype) I have added the following code:</p>

<p>For <strong>www.domainA.com/</strong>:</p>

<p>head:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html lang=""en"" prefix=""og: http://ogp.me/ns#""&gt;

&lt;script&gt; ... Facebook SDK all.js script, same as for root domain ... &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The fb:app_id and og:site_name are the same on all pages. The og:title, og:description are different on each page.</p>

<p>My problem is now that some pages do link (Moderation Tool) to the correct Facebook app under developers.facebook.com/tools/comments/fbappid/ and some do not. They link e.g. to developers.facebook.com/tools/comments/url/{long_number}/pending/descending/ and I would like them all to link to the correct Facebook app under developers.facebook.com/tools/comments/fbappid/ to moderate them.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a solution for this? I have tried everything Facebook suggests and some other SO posts do suggest.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>I right clicked on sections that i wanted formatted on CR Designer.  I specified a CSS class name.  I then created a .css file with the styles--however i did not see any changes to my report. 
I also tried creating an HTML file with some CSS to see if that would perhaps affect the outcome of the look/feel of the report.  Again, nothing.</p>

<p>My question is, will I have to implement the same <code>initialize()</code> and <code>parseClassName()</code> functions for <code>Speaker</code>?</p>

<pre><code>    var dirx = 0;  
    var spdx = 35; 
    var imgLeftInt; 
    var imgTopInt; 
    var imgHeight; 
    var imgWidth; 
    var divWidth; 
    var divHeight; 
    var t;
    var tempX;
    var tempY;
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm pretty sure I'm not missing any variables...</p>

<pre><code>    function animBall(on) {               
        imgLeftInt = parseInt(document.images['logo'].style.left); 
        imgTopInt = parseInt(document.images['logo'].style.top); 
        imgHeight =  parseInt(document.images['logo'].height); 
        imgWidth =  parseInt(document.images['logo'].width); 
        divWidth = parseInt(document.images['container'].width);        
        if (tempX &gt; 779){
            dirx = 1;
        } 
        else if(tempX &lt; 767){
            dirx = 2;
        }
        else {
            spdx = 0;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>So if tempX, which should be the x coordinate of the mouse location, is bigger than 779, which is the halfway point of the div tag, the image should go right. If it's less than that, it should go left, and otherwise, the speed should be zero, as in it should stay still.</p>

<pre><code>        if(dirx == 1){                            
            goRight(); 
        } else if(dirx == 2) {                                      
            goLeft(); 
        }        
    }
    function getMouseXY(e) {
        tempX = e.clientX;
        tempY = e.clientY;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I found hundreds of different ways to get the mouse location, but this was off W3C so I assume it works.</p>

<pre><code>    function goRight() { 
        document.images['logo'].style.left = imgLeftInt+spdx +""px""; 
        if (imgLeftInt &gt;  (divWidth-imgWidth)){ 
            dirx = 2; 
            spdx= 20; 
        } 
    } 

    function goLeft() { 
        document.images['logo'].style.left = (imgLeftInt-spdx) +""px""; 
        if (imgLeftInt &lt;  5){ 
            dirx = 1; 
            spdx= 20; 
        } 
    } 

    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So that's my whole script.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div id=""container"" onmousemove=""getMouseXY(event);"" width=""1546"" height=""423""&gt;
        &lt;a href=""javascript:var t=setInterval('animBall()', 80)""&gt;Start Animation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""javascript:clearInterval(t);""&gt;Stop Animation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
        &lt;img src=""http://qabila.tv/images/logo_old.png"" style=""position:absolute;left:10px;top:20px;"" id=""logo"" /&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I left the dependency on the mouse location to the very end so the animation script works fine (or at least worked, unless I broke something trying to get it to read the mouse location).</p>

<p>Any ideas what I'm doing wrong??</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<pre><code>(-&gt; (jquery ""body"")         
  (.append (crate/html [:h1{:class ""red""} ""Test inside a jquery""]) ))))
</code></pre>

<p>Where the red class simply defines:</p>

<pre><code>.red {
color:red;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried several variations of crate here including defpartial, defhtml with the same results. 
Same results using jayq or non-wrapped jquery. 
Similarly, using different jquery methods (inner, append, html, etc).</p>

<p>Am I missing something very obvious?</p>

Some of these repositories are very slow or don't answer until a timeout, leading to ridiculously long build times.</p>

<p>Another problem is that Maven tries to download our own internal artifacts from remote repositories where they are of course not hosted. I think this is a huge privacy concern.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to configure Maven in such a way that it downloads dependencies only from particular repositories?</strong></p>

<p>I know that you can setup your own Maven repository manager (like Nexus) but I want to know if it's possible with plain Maven.

Even encrypting it in EXE would only slow down the process (although I'm not sure how much time would it take to get an encrypted password from an EXE file). </p>

<p>So, from my understanding, I need something in the middle that would do the add, edit, delete etc to the database. Seems like a job for REST API or maybe SOAP services. </p>

<p>My question is, which one should I use? Or should I use something else? I was thinking Zend Framework to create those REST APIs. Then, I would use Qt to create a desktop application to call those APIs. But if I proceed with REST, my application would be a 3 tier application. Wouldn't it be better if I just create a web application? Maybe I should just stick to desktop application call those APIs since the application is already finished and I just need to change from connecting directly to MySQL to calling those APIs to perform tasks rather than changing the whole application to a web.</p>

<p>Any advice would be very helpful. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for a <strong>security that would protect my MySQL password connection.</strong> </p>

<p>Obfuscator would only obfuscate the code, it won't hide my string database information which In my opinion can be easily found using grep after decompiling the JAR using tools like JAD.</p>

Let's call them a,b,c. I have equivalent aCtrl,bCtrl,cCtrl and aSvc,bSvc,cSvc to manage these CRUD operations. 
So in this example, aCtrl manages CRUD for 'a'. aSvc helps persist the data to the backend with an ajax call.
I also have an allCtrl and allSvc which pulls all the objects a,b,c together from the backend in one json object when the application loads for the first time (instead of pulling them separately, I designed the backend to push one unified json object with embedded a,b,c in it.</p>

And when the app loads for the first time, I want to list the objects of type 'a' and then give the user options to edit/delete/add. Similarly, I have drop down navigation to do take the user to other pages that do exactly the same for object 'b', 'c'.</p>

<p>Here are some snippets of what I did so far and how I fail miserably :)</p>

<p>index.html</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html lang=""en"" ng-app=""myApp""&gt;
 ...
 ...
 &lt;div class="""" ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>js</p>

<pre><code>var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute','restangular']);  
myApp.controller('aCtrl', function($scope, aSvc) 
myApp.controller('bCtrl', function($scope, bSvc) 
myApp.controller('cCtrl', function($scope, cSvc) 
myApp.controller('allCtrl', function($scope, allSvc) 
</code></pre>

<p>routes</p>

<pre><code>myApp.config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
$routeProvider.when('/a/list', {templateUrl: 'partials/a/list.html',controller: 'aCtrl'});
$routeProvider.when('/a/add', {templateUrl: 'partials/a/add.html', controller: 'aCtrl'});
$routeProvider.when('/a/edit/:id', {templateUrl: 'partials/a/edit.html', controller: 'aCtrl'});
$routeProvider.when('/a/delete/:id', {templateUrl: 'partials/a/list.html', controller: 'aCtrl'});
.... similary I have routes for b &amp; c to perform crud
$routeProvider.otherwise({redirectTo: '/a/list'});

}]);
</code></pre>

<p>aCtrl</p>

<pre><code>myApp.controller('aCtrl', function($scope, aSvc,allSvc) {
$scope.allCollection= allService.getAll();
$scope.aCollection = allCollection.a;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm unable to meaningfully setup routeParams in this design to perform edit/delete properly. I also have to account for the userId (the user who logs in for whom the CRUD operations need to be performed). How do I better manage the routes? should I use something like /a/edit/userId/aId for editing 'a' and /a/delete/userId/aId to delete 'a' as an example?</p>

<p>Please help me polish this turd. </p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Basically, a load of computers on the same network will run small ""servers"" (like, really small - maximum about 2 connections?). Then, a client (also on that network) can be run that will connect to as many as it can.</p>

<p>This would be easy to code if you knew the IP addresses of the computers in advance, but I'm trying to get it to find available computers itself - by scanning through the possible IP addresses (by taking the client's local network IP and iteratively changing the final few digits).</p>

<p>Finally, I need it to be able to do it fairly quickly - even with a mere 2 second timeout, that's 255 x 2 = 510 seconds. And that's just for the final part of the IP - ideally, this would run over the final 2 portions, a full 65025 attempts (though this would obviously take a lot longer!).</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>First off, is this possible? Can one ""client"" socket throw out connection attempts to multiple computers at a time? And if it can, how can it do so efficiently? I've thought of threads, but they're a real pain to synchronise and keep track of, and I've looked into the <code>select</code> function, but can't work out how to get it working in this scenario. </p>

<p>Any help or advice is really appreciated!</p>

I expected that <code>str</code> applied to a <code>Decimal</code> would always give me a string of the form <code>-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)</code>, which is what I want.</p>

<p>Firstly, if I understand correctly, the scientific notation <code>'0E-1000'</code> represents 0 x 10^-1000, i.e. zero. Why am I getting this particular representation of zero? Why not <code>'0E-42'</code>, which is the same?</p>

<p>Secondly, I cannot manually construct a <code>Decimal</code> which reproduces this bug. The buggy <code>Decimal</code> instance comes from an external source. The expression <code>str(Decimal(0))</code> evaluates to <code>'0'</code> in the REPL. How can I construct an instance <code>d</code> of <code>Decimal</code> for which <code>str(d)</code> evaluates to <code>'0E-1000'</code>?</p>

<p>EDIT: Thirdly, how can I convert an arbitrary <code>Decimal</code> instance to a string in, you know, <em>decimal</em> notation?</p>

<p>I have content that displays with different width size. Sometimes the content spans across the browser while some content spans a quarter of the browser. I want to set the accordion width size to something like 50% but expands to 100% when clicked to accomodate for the large content.</p>

<p>Right now having all of the accordion width set to 100% looks very awkward.</p>

<p>I am using the example found in this tutorial: <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/accordion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqueryui.com/accordion/</a></p>

<p>By default the style sets the width to 100%. I had to do a wrapper class to override that style to 50% but again, when I expand an accordion with big content it doesn't display all of it so you'll have to side scroll to see it.</p>

<p>So currently my accordion function is this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  $(function() {
    $( ""#accordion"" ).accordion({
      collapsible: true,
      heightStyle: ""content""
    });
  });

<p>My goal is to see how long it takes to the PC to do such operation using 1 and 2 CPUs; in order to to compile the program I type the following line in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -fopenmp main.c -o main

<p>And then I select the number of CPUs like so:</p>

<pre><code>export OMP_NUM_THREADS=N

<p>Currently I intend to use ab as the origin.

If it is the same or the dot product is zero then it must be in (a, ab, ca)... Continue with this procedure with the other outer triangles (b, ba, ab) &amp; (c, ca, ba). In the end if it didn't match with these it must be contained within the inner triangle (ab, bc, ca).</p>

<p>Here is a little more info of the intended application of the algorithm:</p>

<p>I'm using this as a subdivision mask to generate a fine mesh over which I intend to interpolate. Each of the triangles will be subdivided similarly up to a specified depth. I want to determine the triangle (at the maximum depth) within which the point p lies. With this I can evaluate a function at the point p using interpolation over the triangle. There is a class of triangles which is right-angled and they do comprise a significant portion, but they're much easier to work with and this algorithm isn't intended for them.</p>

"31277130","1","","","2015-07-07 18:59:06","","15","320","<p>I'm wondering if it is possible to create a lock-free, thread-safe shared pointer for any of the ""common"" architectures, like x64 or ARMv7 / ARMv8.</p>

<p>In a talk about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmxkPChOcvw"" rel=""nofollow"">lock-free programming at cppcon2014</a>, Herb Sutter presented a (partial) implementation of a lock-free singly linked list. The implementation looks quite simple, but it relies on an atomic <code>shared_ptr</code> implementation that doesn't exist in the standard library yet or on using the specialized <code>std::atomic...</code> functions. This is especially important as single push/pop calls potentially invoke multiple atomic loads/stores and <code>compare_exchange</code> operations.  </p>

<p>The problem I see (and I think some of the questions in the talk went into the same direction) is that for this to be an actual lock-free data structure, those atomic operations would have to be lock-free themselves. I don't know of any standard library implementation for the <code>std::atomic...</code> functions that is lock-free and - at least with a short google / SO search - I also didn't find a suggestion of how to implement a lock-free specialization for <code>std::atomic&lt;std::shared_ptr&gt;</code>.   </p>

<p>Now before I'm wasting my time on this I wanted to ask: </p>

<ul>
<li>Do you know, if it is possible to write an lockfree, atomic shared pointer at all?</li>
<li>Are there already any implementations that I've overlooked and - ideally - are even compatible with what you would expect from a <code>std::atomic&lt;std::shared_ptr&gt;</code>? For the mentioned queue it would especially require a <code>CAS</code>-operation.</li>
<li>If there is no way to implement this on current architectures, do you see any other benefit in Herb's implementation compared to a ""normal"" linked list that is protected by a lock?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>For reference, here is the code from Herb Sutter (might contain typos from me):</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt; 
class slist {
    struct Node { T t;  std::shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; next; };
    std::atomic&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt;&gt; head;        
public:
    class reference{
        std::shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; p;
    public:
        reference(std::shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; p_){}
        T&amp; operator*(){ return p-&gt;t; }
        T* operator-&gt;(){ return &amp;p-&gt;t; }
    };
    auto find(T t) const {
        auto p = head.load();
        while (p &amp;&amp; p-&gt; != t) {
            p = p - next;
        }
        return reference(move(p));
    }
    void push_front(T t) {
        auto p = std::make_shared&lt;Node&gt;();
        p-&gt;t = t;
        p-&gt;next = head;
        while (!head.compare_exchange_weak(p-&gt;next, p)) {}
    }
    void pop_front() {
        auto p = head.load();
        while (p &amp;&amp; !head.compare_exchange_weak(p, p - next)) { ; }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Note, that in this implementation, single instances of a <code>shared_ptr</code> can be accessed / modified by multiple different threads. It can be read/copied, reset and even deleted (as part of a node). So this not about whether multiple different <code>shared_ptr</code> objects (that manage the same object) can be used by multiple threads without a race condition - this that is already true for current implementations and required by the standard - but it is about concurrent access to a single pointer instance, which is - for standard shared pointers - no more threadsafe than the same operations on raw pointers would be.</p>

<hr>

<p>To explain my motivation:<br>
This is mainly an academic question. I've no intention of implementing my own lock free list in production code, but I find the topic interesting and at first glance, Herb's presentation seemed to be a good introduction. However, while thinking about <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31254767/atomic-reference-counting"">this question</a> and @sehe's comment on my answer, I remembered this talk, had another look at it and realized that it doesn't make much sense to call Herb's implementation lock-free, if it's primitive operations require locks (which they currently do). So I was wondering, whether this is just a limitation of the current implementations or a fundamental flaw in the design.</p>

<p>I want to use <code>setFile:withFileName:andContentType:forKey:</code> from ASIFormDataRequest since in my experience it's faster than trying to submit an image using <code>UIImageJPEGRepresentation</code> and submitting raw NSData. To that end I'm using <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGImageDestination/Reference/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>CGImageDestination</code></a> and creating an image destination with a url, saving that image to disk, and then uploading that file on disk.</p>

<p>In order to create the thumbnail I'm using <code>CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex</code> (see <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGImageSource/Reference/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a>) and creating an image source with the path of the file I just saved.</p>

<p>My problem is that no matter what options I pass into the image destination or the thumbnail creation call, my thumbnail always comes out rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. The uploaded image is also rotated. I've tried explicitly setting the orientation in the options of the image using <code>CGImageDestinationSetProperties</code> but it doesn't seem to take. The only solution I've found is to rotate the image in memory, but I really want to avoid that since doing so doubles the time it takes for the thumbnail+saving operation to finish. Ideally I'd like to be able to rotate the image on disk.</p>

<p>Am I missing something in how I'm using <code>CGImageDestination</code> or <code>CGImageSource</code>? I'll post some code below.</p>

<p><strong>Saving the image:</strong></p>

<pre><code>NSURL *filePath = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:self.imagePath];
CGImageRef imageRef = [self.image CGImage];
CGImageDestinationRef ref = CGImageDestinationCreateWithURL((CFURLRef)filePath, kUTTypeJPEG, 1, NULL);
CGImageDestinationAddImage(ref, imageRef, NULL);

NSDictionary *props = [[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                        [NSNumber numberWithFloat:1.0], kCGImageDestinationLossyCompressionQuality,
                        nil] retain];
//Note that setting kCGImagePropertyOrientation didn't work here for me

CGImageDestinationSetProperties(ref, (CFDictionaryRef) props);

CGImageDestinationFinalize(ref);
CFRelease(ref);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Generating the thumbnail</strong></p>

<pre><code>CGImageSourceRef imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL((CFURLRef)filePath, NULL);
if (!imageSource)
    return;

CFDictionaryRef options = (CFDictionaryRef)[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                                            (id)kCFBooleanTrue, (id)kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform,
                                            (id)kCFBooleanTrue, (id)kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageIfAbsent,
                                            (id)[NSNumber numberWithFloat:THUMBNAIL_SIDE_LENGTH], (id)kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize, nil];
CGImageRef imgRef = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(imageSource, 0, options);
UIImage *thumb = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:imgRef];

CGImageRelease(imgRef);
CFRelease(imageSource);
</code></pre>

<p>And then to upload the image I just use</p>

<pre><code>[request setFile:path withFileName:fileName andContentType:contentType forKey:@""photo""];
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>path</code> is the path to the file saved with the code above.</p>

<p>I've tested the service with both WCF test client and a separate .NET console application. In both cases the service works as expected.

<p>As you can see the first exception is skipped which means <code>doc</code> argument itself is not null but for some reason, the Citizen property is null. The guy who generates the request in java client confirms that the InwardDocument.Citizen property is not null by debugging the code. In fact we've had a problem generating the proxy class in that java client which I describe in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32011067/string-type-in-wcf-service-interpreted-as-jaxbelement-in-javaclient"">this SO thread</a>.

<p>Now, it doesn't specify how to indicate a value. So, since the default is true, that means that excluding it won't indicate false, because… true is the default.

I have a configuration file that has variables and value separate by spaces.  I want to take the value (in the second column) of certain matches and inline edit the file, dividing this match by 2.  I also would like to preserve spacing and use a ceiling function on the value.  </p>

<p>For example, the file:
To recap, using an actual example file, if my file was:</p>

<pre><code>OTHER TEXT 1
OTHER TEXT 2
restartfreq        325
dcdfreq            325
xstFreq            325
outputEnergies     325
outputPressure     325
OTHER TEXT 3
</code></pre>

<p>Would become:</p>

<pre><code>OTHER TEXT 1
OTHER TEXT 2
restartfreq        163
dcdfreq            163
xstFreq            163
outputEnergies     163
outputPressure     163
OTHER TEXT 3
</code></pre>

<p>I would prefer to do this all in a Bash script using Linux commands.  I've considered switching to a small c++ program, but for now am sticking with a scripted tool-based solution.</p>

<p>Working towards this, I posted this inquiry last week:<br>
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3686204/how-can-i-mix-math-with-regexs-in-awk-or-sed/3687341#3687341"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3686204/how-can-i-mix-math-with-regexs-in-awk-or-sed/3687341#3687341</a></p>

<p>I came eventually to a long-winded solution, but ghostdog74 proposed this more eloquent solution:</p>

<pre><code>awk '$1==""restartfreq""{$2=$2/2;}1' file &gt; t &amp;&amp; mv t file
</code></pre>

<p>This does what I want... almost.</p>

<p>As I said, I also need to implement a ceiling function, and preferably preserve white space -- and I'd like to make it capable of dividing the values of multiple matches, not just one.</p>

<p>Can I do this in a one-liner or small nested awk script?  Any tips??</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>I've taken Ghostdog's answer:</p>

<pre><code>awk '$1~/[fF]req|output/{ n=$2/2; sub(/ [0-9][0-9]*$/,n)}1' file
</code></pre>

<p>And modified it slightly to allow comments on the end of the line and to perform the ceiling as per my request.  I'm going to ask a separate function about how to use short functions in awk one liners.</p>

<pre><code>awk '$1~/restartfreq|dcdfreq|xstFreq|outputEnergies|outputPressure/{ a=$2/2; n= (a== int(a)) ? a : int(a)+1; sub(/ [0-9][0-9]*.*$/,n)}1' file &gt; temp &amp;&amp; mv -f temp file
</code></pre>

<p>Good work Ghostdog!</p>

<p>In the placeholder example, the options available in the dropdown are hardcoded in the HTML.
What I need is that when you open, it goes to the jSON file and returns the info available on the json.</p>

<p>To attempt to solve this, I have created a custom converter, and exposed a dependency property on that converter:</p>

<pre><code>public class InstanceToBooleanConverter : DependencyObject, IValueConverter
{
    public object Value
    {
        get { return (object)GetValue(ValueProperty); }
        set { SetValue(ValueProperty, value); }
    }

    public static readonly DependencyProperty ValueProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register(""Value"", typeof(object), typeof(InstanceToBooleanConverter), null);

    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
    {
        return value != null &amp;&amp; value.Equals(Value);
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
    {
        return value.Equals(true) ? Value : Binding.DoNothing;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to set this value using a binding (or style setter, or other crazy method) in my XAML?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=""{Binding Properties}""&gt;
    &lt;ItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type local:SomeClass}""&gt;
            &lt;DataTemplate.Resources&gt;
                &lt;!-- I'd like to set Value to the item from ItemsSource --&gt;
                &lt;local:InstanceToBooleanConverter x:Key=""converter"" Value=""{Binding Path=???}"" /&gt;
            &lt;/DataTemplate.Resources&gt;
&lt;!- ... -&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The examples I've seen so far only bind to static resources.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I got some feedback that there is only one converter instance with the XAML I posted.</p>

<p>I can work around this by placing the resource in my control:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=""{Binding Properties}""&gt;
    &lt;ItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type local:SomeClass}""&gt;
            &lt;RadioButton Content=""{Binding Name}"" GroupName=""Properties""&gt;
                &lt;RadioButton.Resources&gt;
                    &lt;!-- I'd like to set Value to the item from ItemsSource --&gt;
                    &lt;local:InstanceToBooleanConverter x:Key=""converter""
                                                      Value=""{Binding Path=???}"" /&gt;
                &lt;/RadioButton.Resources&gt;
                &lt;RadioButton.IsChecked&gt;
                    &lt;Binding Path=""DataContext.SelectedItem""
                             RelativeSource=""{RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type Window}}""
                             Converter=""{StaticResource converter}"" /&gt;

            &lt;/RadioButton&gt;
&lt;!- ... -&gt;

<p>So this problem isn't blocked by having to share an instance of the converter :)</p>

This is something similar to what Moodle can do, where users can enrol themselves on a course.</p>

<p>My thinking is that I'd setup a list that allows all users to have contribute permissions. A user would then add a very basic list item which would start a workflow. The workflow would add the said user to a group that already has contribute permissions to a document library.</p>

<p>If it helps, here's the reason:
We have a lot of students accessing our SharePoint site (well over 2000), and all students are under a general AD group. To use the SharePoint Learning Kit (and therefore make use of SCORM content), there has to be a SharePoint group with specific rights, and that group should, ideally, contain individual users rather than AD groups (depending on the size of the AD group). Unfortunately, there isn't a way to get our learner record system to expose a field which SharePoint could 'see' which is why all students are under a general AD group. Because there are so many students (some with similar names), it would be a hard task to get lecturers to filter through each student to add them manually to the SLK group that's needed. Which is where this idea comes in. A student could enrol themselves into the SLK group and get access to the SLK material.</p>

if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &lt; 16) {
   temp.setBackgroundDrawable(Drawable.createFromPath(filePath.toString()));
} else {
   temp.setBackground(Drawable.createFromPath(filePath.toString()));
}
</code></pre>

<p>When logging it out, it shows that setBackgroundDrawable is running and not setBackground, but I get the same nosuchmethod error (setBackground).</p>

<p>The other option is setBackgroundResource, but it accepts an int and not a drawable.  Can I convert from drawable to int for this purpose?  </p>

<p>What can I do here to set the background of the button to a file in internal storage for APIs &lt; 16?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>***EDIT - ok, this is working.  just missed a little part elsewhere in the code that had the same problem.  However, is using a deprecated method really the only way?  </p>

<p>Here's the podfile:</p>

pod ""TMCache""
pod ""SVProgressHUD""

<p>However, after using CocoaPods, building targets for iPhone 5 always fails, but succeeds for simulator.</p>

<p>Here's the error log:</p>

<p>I've tried solutions mentioned in <a href=""http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CocoaPods Troubleshooting</a>, including adding the <code>Pods</code> static library on top of the list, but it still fails.</p>

<p>Later we found that in ""Pods Project Settings"" > ""Build Settings"" > ""Architectures"", ""Base SDK"" is set as ""No SDK (Latest OS X)"", ""Build Active Architecture Only"" > ""Debug"" set as ""Yes"" and ""Supported Platforms"" set as ""OS X"". After changing them to ""Latest iOS (iOS 7.0)"", ""No"", ""iOS"" respectively, building for iPhone 5 and simulator both work fine.</p>

<p>However, each time we do <code>Pod update</code>, all of the three settings are reverted to their previous states, which is annoying.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this case by design or something is wrong with my project/workspace setting?</li>
<li>How to prevent these settings from being reverted to the wrong states?</li>

<p>As specified in <a href=""http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.2.x/tutorials/crontrigger"" rel=""nofollow"">the documentation of Quartz CronTrigger</a>, the sixth field of the expression represents the day of week, which can be either a number from 1 to 7 or an abbreviation, such as <code>SUN</code>, <code>MON</code>, <code>TUE</code> etc. So, both the expression</p>

<pre><code>0 0 12 ? * MON *
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>0 0 12 ? * 2 *
</code></pre>

<p>would execute the action every Monday at noon.</p>

<p>However, if I add an increment to the day of weeks, the behavior changes depending on the notation. First of all, adding an increment to the first expression will always repeat the event every Monday, instead of, for example, every two or three Mondays. The expressions below behave in the same way!</p>

<pre><code>0 0 12 ? * MON/1 *
0 0 12 ? * MON/2 *
0 0 12 ? * MON/3 *
</code></pre>

<p>If I use the numeric values for days of week, however, the events are repeated <em>daily</em> instead of weekly. So, if today is Monday, the expression</p>

<pre><code>0 0 12 ? * 1/1 *
</code></pre>

<p>will repeat tomorrow (Tuesday), after tomorrow (Wednesday) etc. etc. ad infinitum. The expression below will understandably repeat each three days until next Sunday (Wednesday, Saturday and then Sunday, Wednesday and Saturday, and so on).</p>

<pre><code>0 0 12 ? * 1/3 *
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sense in an unexpected way (repeat each day after the weekday) but I would expect it to run every three Sundays. Anyway, the fact that the two formats have different behaviors just blew my mind.</p>

<p>I tested it with <a href=""http://www.cronmaker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CronMaker</a> and now I have some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why both notations have different behaviors?</li>
<li>How to express ""repeat after every three Mondays""?</li>

I want a method argument to implement several interfaces.</p>

<p>Not sure why this doesn't work, the ng-scroll should iterate rows putting an array into video_list, ng-repeat should grab each object from the row and get values.</p>

<p><strong>Error:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Store Model:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class StoreDetailsViewModel

    &lt;/table&gt;
}

<p>What I cannot get to work is passing the StoreID for selected row in list of stores (ActionLink would work easily but I need to also pass back List_StoreIDs).</p>

<p>I expected the @Html.Hidden(""id"") to work but this is <em>always 1</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Controller</strong></p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Details(int? id, int[] List_StoreIDs, string submit, string book)
{
    if (id == null)
    {
        return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
    }
    Store store = db.Stores.Find(id);
    if (store == null)
    {
        return HttpNotFound();
    }
 ... do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any suggestions please?</p>

I've been trying to figure this out for the past 3 hours now, and I have no clue as to why this isn't working how i'm expecting it to. Please know that i'm still very new to Javascript, so I apologise if anything is blatantly obvious.</p>

<p>My question is, what is the proper way to create a object, set some properties values, and then later in your code, your conditional check means that the original object and property values that were set, will be overwritten by a new instance of the object like;</p>

oCar.Id = 1;

Car oCar1 = new Car();

<p>This works just fine in the browser but I'm having trouble writing Jasmine tests to validate the behavior. What I have is some minimal fake HTML and I call this function on it. I want to mock out the AJAX call so that I can return some fake data and validate that it displays in the div with the appropriate formatting (Yes - I know that this is basically testing the JSTree widget but this is so we then add additional behavior and tests for click events on those nodes in the future)</p>

<p>Normally in Jasmine whenever I want to stub out the AJAX request so I can put some fake data into my code - I can just use a simple spyOn like this.</p>

<pre><code>spyOn($, ""ajax"").andCallFake(function(params){
params.success(
    [
        {""data"":""Solid"", ""attr"": {""id"":""dhValue521f6364fe334d21c3917da6"",""valueId"":""521f6364fe334d21c3917da6"",""value"":""Solid"",""title"":""Solid"",""selectable"":false},""state"":""""},
        {""data"":""Polka Dot"",""attr"":{""id"":""dhValue521f6364fe334d21c3917da8"",""valueId"":""521f6364fe334d21c3917da8"",""value"":""Polka Dot"",""title"":""Polka Dot"",""selectable"":false},""state"":""""},
    ]
)
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>But for some reason this isn't working with JStree - it still keeps trying to make a real AJAX call from my unit tests. I've even validated that in the JStree source it does call $.ajax to get the data from the server, so this <em>should</em> work. Tried just about every possible alternative I could think of and searched everywhere. </p>

<p>Has anyone been able to do this? Or able to point me in the direction of what's wrong with my AJAX stub? Is it the fact that JStree was coded as a JQuery Widget that's causing these issues?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have been asked by a friend to help him design a control system for production line. The project sounds really interesting, and I can't stop thinking about it.</p>

<p>I have already found that I can control the system using a node.js server. So far so good (HTML5 interface here we come)! But where I really want this system to stand out is in the collection of system metrics. The system reports all kinds of things such as temperature, flow etc, and these metrics are reported up to several hundred times per second per metric... and this runs 24/7. </p>

<p>My thought is to persist this in a MongoDb database, and do some realtime statistics on this. The ""competition"", if you will, seems to save this in a SQL server database and allow the operators to export aggregated data to Excel, and do statistics in Excel.</p>

<p>What are the strategies for doing real time statistics using a MongoDb?</p>

<p>I would really like to provide instant feedback and monitoring based on these metrics. Such as average temperature over the last 24 hours, spikes etc, and also enable alerts. There will not be much advanced statistics done on the server. If that is needed, I would enable export of data to a program such as SPSS.</p>

<p>Is MongoDb a good fit for that? I would love to use a Linux machine instead of a Windows machine with SQL Server and a WinForms Control Interface. The license fees alone are enough to put me off, although I know it probably isn't the case for the people buying the machinery.</p>

<p>This will not be placed in the cloud, but rather on a single server on the network. Next to the machine being operated, I will place a touch interface that through a browser will contact the node.js server to invoke PLC commands. There can be multiple machines that need controlling, and they would all be controlled by the same central node.js server.</p>

<p>The machinery is controlled by PLC controllers from <a href=""http://beckhoff.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beckhoff.com/</a>.</p>

<p>I am not a complete novice when it comes to MongoDb, but I have never put anything I have made into production, and I wouldn't put MongoDb on my CV... yet!</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems that the $inc operator is the way to go. But what if I wan't both the daily and hourly averages as well as a continuous feed that updates a chart on screen with data every second using socket.io. Is is a good idea to update a document for each of the aggregates I need. I really also want to save every measurement, but maybe I could aggregate that on a per second basis, so I don't store up to a 1000 records per second per metric?</p>

But when I try to read the items I'm getting the following error -</p>

<li>I'm using SharePoint 2007 x64 in

<p>I'm writing PHP files, and then preview them running from file, not server. This was working fine till I tried PHP includes. These don't work as a relative path, only as an absolute from the root of the drive.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can use statements like </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>include_once ""common/header.php"";  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>without specifying my entire file path like so : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>include_once ""/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/neil/Desktop/Website/ColoredLists_v1.0/common/base.php"";</p>
</blockquote>

<p>,where ColoredLists_v1.0 is the directory with all the website files in it. I tried solutions like prepending _SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT] or dirname(<strong>File</strong>) to the file paths, but that didn't work as the variables were not set. Is there any easy way to do this, or a configuration I can change so that it looks in a specific directory by default instead of looking at the drive root? Currently, echo_include_path shows .:</p>

<p>When I include this line at the start of the script, it works:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>set_include_path('/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/neil/Desktop/Website/ColoredLists_v1.0');</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if I want to do this for all my scripts, I can't seem to make the change permanent. Even after I edited the Unix include_path in my php.ini, it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I finally decided that the easiest sureshot way was to run the Apache server locally. It comes preinstalled with Mac, so didnt face much trouble there. I modified the httpd.conf to only allow connections from localhost, thus alleviating my security fears. Ofcourse, this still opens up port 80, but I'm behind a router, so I'm gonna hope I'm not very exposed. And Coda includes a great features in 'Sites', where I can set the local url, so it works brilliantly now. Only downside is, now, after code edits, I need to manually refresh the preview.</p>

<p>I have an issue with ssh connection on my Debian 7 system to a remote OpenSSH server located on the same network. It looks like there is some network configuration problem but I cann't find where it lays. This two debian machines are connect with a switch that is NOT connected to a router. So the two machines have no internet connection.</p>

<pre><code>A-Debian 7
IP: 192.168.1.2

B-Debian 7
IP: 192.168.1.3
MASK: 255.255.255.0
GW: 192.168.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>With that configuration the ssh command prompts my for a password in less then a second. But the with the following network configuration I get the password prompt after a 10+ second delay:</p>

<pre><code>A-Debian 7
IP: 10.10.1.83
MASK: 255.255.255.128

B-Debian 7
IP: 10.10.1.82
MASK: 255.255.255.128
GW: 10.10.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>The ssh connection from the server A -> B runs with both configs on custom 1111 port.
The B machine has also a Web server running on port <code>8080</code> that has no delays with both net configurations.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any clues or tips how to solve that problem.</p>

<p><strong>SOLVED: Removing of the gateway parameter ""GW: 10.10.1.1"" in the network settings has solved the problem.</strong></p>

Once the code is run, it unfreezes and everything as it showed be (the vba performed the required actions, it opens up a final query as coded etc.)</p>

<p>This was fine up until now because I've implemented (or want to implement) a ""progress status"" function of the VBA script. This is because due to new requirements the table being analyzed jumped from about 4,000 records to about 50,000 records.</p>

<p>I've done this by using a simple modal dialog form that refreshes after each record.</p>

<p>The Modal Dialog is initially opened:</p>

<pre><code>DoCmd.OpenForm (""ProgressReport"")
Forms(""ProgressReport"").Controls(""ProgressLabel"").Caption = ""0 of "" &amp; RecordCount &amp; "" records analyzed.""

<p>Then after each iteration:</p>

Forms(""ProgressReport"").Controls(""ProgressLabel"").Caption = RecordsAnalyzed &amp; "" of "" &amp; RecordCount &amp; "" records analyzed.""
Forms(""ProgressReport"").Repaint
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to allocate 'memory' to the modal form so even if Access freezes, this is kept alive? The code is slightly complicated but its just Do Until (EOF) and If Statements - pretty basic VBA functions. Any thoughts on how I can get this progress bar to work? Without or without the Modal Dialog.</p>

<p>I've looked into editing the Status Bar however, that won't work either given Access freezes.</p>

<p>Please note when <code>\n</code> is regex then the length of string array is  expected but when <code>\\\\n</code> as regex it is showing the length as 1 but
    the contents split are same as previous. Why  discrepancy in the length calculation when regex expression changes??

"32635049","1","","","2015-09-17 16:06:19","","0","31","<p>I am very new to this site and I am having an issue using sprintf in R. Briefly what I am trying to do is the following:</p>

<p>I need to create a text file with a header (which is space delimited and has to maintain that particular space), below which I need to copy some numbers made of X rows (depending on the data, I will read a big table made of thousands of line, but for each ID there will be a variable number of rows; this is not a major problem as I can loop through them). My problem is that i cannot align the numbers below the header. </p>

<pre><code>setwd(""C:\\Example\\formatting"")
</code></pre>

<p>My data are in a CSV format so I read:</p>

<pre><code>s100 = read.csv(""example.csv"", header=T)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I take the columns I am interested in and transform it in this way:</p>

<pre><code>SID1 = as.vector(as.matrix(s100$Row1))
SID2 = as.vector(as.matrix(s100$Row2))
SID3 = as.vector(as.matrix(s100$Row3))
SIDN = as.vector(as.matrix(s100$RowN))
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have the following (do not worry about the letters, that part up to a certain point is really easy, I got stuck at the end when I need to read the SID:</p>

<pre><code>sink(""Example.xxx"", append = T)
cat(""*Some description goes here\n"")
</code></pre>

<p>This goes on an on until I need to put the numbers down. So, when I arrive to this piece:</p>

<pre><code>cat(""@  SAB   SSD   TAR....."", sep = ""\n"")
</code></pre>

<p>I now need to have aligned the numbers under SAB, SSD, TAR... and so on.
So, now I do the following ( I only tried using one column and one header first):</p>

<pre><code>cat(""SAB "", sep = ""\n"")
cat(sprintf(""%s\n"", SID1, sep=""\n"" ))
</code></pre>

<p>But, what I get in the end is the following:</p>

<pre><code>SAB
0.30
 0.40
 0.50
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of </p>

<pre><code> SAB    SSD     TAR
0.30   0.40      10
0.40   0.80      40
0.50   0.90      00
....   ....      ...
</code></pre>

<p>So my two questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to solve the above problem?</li>
<li>Since at the beginning of that header I have a ""@"" spaced before the ""SAB"" how do I align all my numbers accordingly? </li>
</ol>

<p>I hope I have been clear and not messy, it seems as a simple solution but my knowledge of R and programming go only up to a certain point. </p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any help!</p>

In this view I'm displaying some information about a geo-location point:</p>

<ul>
<li>The address</li>
<li>The map + the pin</li>
<li>A first label (calculated)</li>
<li>A second label (calculated)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the view is loading I need to do some calculation to update the labels. 
This calculation are taking few seconds (I need to call an API) so I've put them in a queue:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
    let loc = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: self.place!.location.latitude, longitude: self.place!.location.longitude)
    let tmp = Int(Geo.apiCall(self.currentPosition, coordTo: loc));
    self.label1.text = "" = \(tmp) unit"";
})
</code></pre>

<p>I've used the main thread <code>dispatch_get_main_queue()</code> because I need to update the label.
The problem is that it's blocking the rendering of the map and it's also blocking the other async function from <code>CLGeocoder</code> that is gathering the address from the geo-location point.</p>

<pre><code>let loc = CLLocation(latitude: self.place!.location.latitude, longitude: self.place!.location.longitude)

CLGeocoder().reverseGeocodeLocation(loc, completionHandler:
    {(placemarks, error) in
        if error != nil {
            println(""reverse geodcode fail: \(error.localizedDescription)"")
        }
        let pms = placemarks as [CLPlacemark]
        if pms.count &gt; 0 {
            let pm = placemarks[0] as CLPlacemark
            self.address.text = ABCreateStringWithAddressDictionary(pm.addressDictionary, false)
        }
})
</code></pre>

<p>So the view is displayed correctly, but all the label are updated at the same time, few seconds after the view is displayed, and the map is loading only when the label are rendered.</p>

<p>What would be the best work around to avoid this blocking when the view is rendering?</p>

            // do some stuff

        }

    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>I need to be able to reference the EUNode instance from inside the <code>touchStartEventHandler</code>, so I tried the following</p>

<pre><code>var EUNode = Class.extend({

    // Methods
    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    init : function(){

            this._super();
            // Store a reference to 'this' globally
        self = this; 
        self.div = this.createDiv();
        self.canDoStuff = true;
        self.div.addEventListener(touchstart, self.touchStartHandler, false);

    },

    touchStartHandler : function(event){

        if(self.canDoStuff){

            // Now I can do stuff, but 'self' is now a global variable
                    // which isn't what I want. If there's more than one instance
                    // of EUNode, 'self' references the newest instance.

        }

    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm stuck in a loop. It seems that in order to limit the scope of ""self"" globally, I need to use the ""this"" keyword, but ""this"" means something else inside event handlers. Any tips?</p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22877380/ffmpeg-to-send-rtsp-encoded-stream-c"">FFMPEG to send RTSP encoded stream C++</a></p>

<p>I've been using it as a reference to my program.</p>

<p>However I'm keep getting AVCodec type ""MPEG"", I've been trying to change <em>filename</em> extension and tried different approaches with <em>avformat_alloc_output_context2</em></p>

<p>This is the relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>const char *filename = ""rtsp://127.0.0.1:7003/live.sdp"";
AVOutputFormat *fmt;
AVFormatContext *oc;
AVStream *video_st;
AVCodec *video_codec;
video_st = NULL;

av_register_all();
avformat_network_init();
// format context:
avformat_alloc_output_context2(&amp;oc,NULL,""rtsp"",filename);
</code></pre>

<p>After calling <em>avformat_alloc_output_context2</em> oc->oformat->video_codec is generated as MPEG codec.
I've tried changing filename extension to:</p>

<pre><code>const char *filename = ""rtsp://127.0.0.1:7003/live.264"";
const char *filename = ""rtsp://127.0.0.1:7003/live.h264"";
</code></pre>

<p>and a bunch of other extensions.</p>

<p>How can I generate a H264 stream?</p>

Now I'd like to publish it to my private Bitbucket repository so that I can use it in different projects and once it is ready I also like to publish it to GitHub. But I have no idea how to publish only the contents of the new package to a new Bitbucket repo.</p>

<p>Hope somebody can point me in the right direction?</p>

<p><strong>Update based on Kacy Raye suggestions</strong></p>

<p>These are the steps I took. To avoid troubles, I created a new dir and cloned the repo to the dir and pushed the repo to a new repo.</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir &lt;application&gt;
sudo chown &lt;user&gt; &lt;application&gt;
git clone git@bitbucket.org:&lt;user-name&gt;/&lt;old-repo&gt;.git
git remote set-url origin git@bitbucket.org:&lt;user-name&gt;/&lt;new-repo&gt;.git
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>With the new repo set-up I now want to push the package (<code>src</code> dir is located in <code>workbench/user-name/package-name/</code>) to a newly created package repo. These are the steps I took.</p>

<pre><code>git remote add &lt;package-name&gt; git@bitbucket.org:&lt;user-name&gt;/&lt;package-name&gt;.git
git checkout -b &lt;package-name&gt;
git rm -r app/ artisan bootstrap/ bower.json composer.json CONTRIBUTING.md phpunit.xml public/ readme.md server.php # all files removed except the workbench dir
git rm -r --cached workbench/ # need only the package
git add workbench/&lt;user-name&gt;/&lt;package-name&gt;/
git commit -m'init'
git push &lt;package-name&gt; master # want the package pushed to the new repo on its master banch
</code></pre>

<p>And then all files are pushed to the server, not just the files of my repo (not even as i mentioned before just the workbench dir) :(</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>
On the Laravel IRC chat I discussed the problem and found the solution! I just needed to do a <code>git init</code> in the <code>wordkbench/&lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;package&gt;</code> dir, add the new remote, git commit, and git push.</p>

I tried simple things, but I don't quite understand how it works...</p>

#pragma omp parallel for num_threads(nthread)
for(int i=0;i&lt;24;++i)
  std::cout &lt;&lt; omp_get_thread_num() &lt;&lt; std::endl;

<p>On my computer, nthread = 6. I don't understand why the output is:</p>

<pre><code>0
0
0
... (24 times)
</code></pre>

<p>Why doesn't it give my numbers from 0 to 5 ?</p>

<p>If I understand it well (correct me if I'm wrong), in this code, there are 6 threads which will execute the std::cout command.
Then, why do I have only ""0"" as an output ?</p>

<p>Second thing: I would like to execute in each thread a certain part of the loop. I want to divide my loop in 6 (nthread) different parts, so that each can be executed by a different thread.</p>

<p>Here, I want each of my 6 threads to execute</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; omp_get_thread_num() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>4 times.</p>

<p>How can I do it? I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma omp parallel for num_threads(nthread)
for(int i=omp_get_thread_num()*(24/nthread);i&lt;(omp_get_thread_num()+1)*(24/nthread);++i)
  std::cout &lt;&lt; omp_get_thread_num() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>Is it right? The output I have is:</p>

<pre><code>0
0
0
0
</code></pre>

<p>Is it normal to have only the ""0"" thread and no other in the terminal?</p>

<p>I was building an app that uses ""Parse"", when I run it on iPhone 6 Simulator i have no problems,it works fine, when I try to run it on my device I got this error:</p>

<p>I'm now finding that if I have a struct with bytes mixes with a byte array it doesn't pack correctly.</p>

<p>Example Code:</p>

<pre><code>struct exampleStruct {
    var ModelNumber: Byte
    var MajorVersion: Byte
    var MinorVersion: Byte
    var Revision: Byte
    var Message: [Byte]
}

var myStruct = exampleStruct (
    ModelNumber: 1,
    MajorVersion: 2,
    MinorVersion: 3,
    Revision: 4,
    Message: [0x48, 0x45, 0x4C, 0x4C, 0x4F] // HELLO
)
</code></pre>

<p><code>println(myStruct.Message)</code> returns correct array with values of [72,69,76,76,79]</p>

<p>However, when I convert this struct to NSData using:</p>

<pre><code>// Struct to NSData.
var data = NSData(
    bytes: &amp; myStruct,
    length: sizeof(exampleStruct)
)
</code></pre>

<p>I get unexpected results of:
""data: &lt;01020304 00000000 108c91fd a87f0000>"".  I was expecting ""data: &lt;01020304 48454c4c 4f>""</p>

<p>It seems like this is because the [Byte] Array length is not set.   Can it be set in SWIFT?  When I try the following:</p>

<pre><code>struct exampleStruct {
   var ModelNumber: Byte
   var MajorVersion: Byte
   var MinorVersion: Byte
   var Revision: Byte
   var Message: Byte[5] // &lt;&lt; Set array length 5
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get a warning that states: ""Fixed-length arrays are not yet supported"".</p>

<p>Anyway to work around this limitation?</p>

<p>Quoting the <a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/testing/unit-test-helpers/#toc_unit-testing-setup"" rel=""nofollow"">Unit Test Helpers</a> page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The setupForTesting() function call makes ember turn off its automatic
  run loop execution. This gives us an ability to control the flow of
  the run loop ourselves, to a degree. Its default behaviour of
  resolving all promises and completing all async behaviour are
  suspended to give you a chance to set up state and make assertions in
  a known state.</p>
  
  <p><code>App.setupForTesting();</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that auto run loops are disabled with a call to setupForTesting(), I would have expected to have to explicitly create one by wrapping my <code>store.find</code> calls in <code>Ember.run</code> since promise resolution occurs as part of a runloop's actions queue. However, this test passes just fine.</p>

<p>Is there an implicit runloop here? If so, when is an <code>Ember.run</code> wrapper legitimately required (async callbacks external to the Ember API for example)?</p>

<p>In one database table, let's call it Table A I want to do a select statement to get the values of a few columns (Subject, Name, Description, Date). Though I also want a relation name. The problem is however that the relation name (which is set in the relation table, Table B) is displayed in Table A as a string value (D0001001) - so not as a literal name. </p>

<p>To get the literal relation name there is a link with Table B that has an ID column 1001 - 1000~ and a relation 'literal' name column. So for example in table B ID 1001 matches company name MC DONALDS and in table A the RelationID is D0001001 (MC DONALDS).  </p>

<p>Don't ask me why the RelationID in table A is with the weird D000 in front of it,  I don't know either but it had some functionality. </p>

<p>So back to the problem. I want to get a few fields from table A but also the literal relation name from table B where it matches the table A relationID values.  </p>

<p>So the question is, how can I <code>INNER JOIN</code> on these 2 different values/types? <code>RelationID</code> in table A is of string type (<code>nvarchar</code> to be precise) and in Table B the <code>ID</code> that matches the relation name is an <code>Integer</code> type. </p>

<p>I thought I could fix it by:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do a LIKE statement in the query where the ID of table B (1001 integer) partly matches the RelationID of table A (D0001001 string). This however didn't work </p></li>
<li><p>do a <code>REPLACE</code> statement by replacing the RelationID 'D000' values by nothing: """". This would probably still require some sort of cast to integer for the table A value. Had some error here probably because of a syntax error.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    TableA.subject, TableA.Name, TableA.Description, TableA.Date, 
    TableB.RelationName 
INNER JOIN 
    TableB ON TableA.RelationID = TableB.ID
</code></pre>

<p>This returned a conversion that isn't possible (string / integer).</p>

<p>So then I tried:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    TableA.subject, TableA.Name, TableA.Description, TableA.Date, 
    TableB.RelationName 
INNER JOIN 
    TableB ON TableB.ID LIKE '% TableA.RelationID  %'
</code></pre>

<p>This didn't work either (EOF). </p>

<p>To make it a bit clearer my tables:</p>

<p><strong>Table A</strong>
    +------------+-----------+------------------+---------------------+-----------+
    | RelationID |  Subject  |   Description    |        Name         |   Date    |
    +------------+-----------+------------------+---------------------+-----------+
    | D0001001   | Fast Food | Some description | Name of form filler | 13-3-2015 |
    | D0001002   | Drinks    | Some description | Name of form filler | 10-3-2015 |
    | D0001003   | Cars      | Some description | Name of form filler | 7-3-2015  |
    +------------+-----------+------------------+---------------------+-----------+</p>

<p><strong>Table B</strong></p>

<pre><code>+------+--------------+
|  ID  | RelationName |
+------+--------------+
| 1001 | MC DONALDS   |
| 1002 | COCA COLA    |
| 1003 | MERCEDES     |

<p>Just to clarify I bit.

        _repo = repo;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>WebApi - mvc web api project. Should call Service layer to load and save models. No reference to Dal.</p>

<p>In WebApi i have added SimpleInjector. And my CompanyCo troller has 1 constructor like so</p>

<pre><code>class CompanyController  : ApiController
{
    public CompanyController(ICompanyService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now in my application_start code i register ICompanyService to inject CompanyService. Now i get an error saying that CompanyService expects ICompanyRepository to inject. But my webApi project doesnt reference the dal layer.</p>

<p>How can i get this to work? I shouldnt have to reference the dal from the webapi.  I am guessing i am going to get same problem with repos as they have IDbContext in constructor.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>When an <code>async</code> method in ASP.NET Web API throws an exception, however, the exception details are less useful, since the stack trace doesn't show where the exception was thrown from:</p>

<pre><code>System.ArgumentException: title must not be empty.
Parameter name: title    
at System.Web.Http.Filters.ActionFilterAttribute.&lt;CallOnActionExecutedAsync&gt;d__1.MoveNext()
--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---
at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)
at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)
at System.Web.Http.Controllers.ActionFilterResult.&lt;ExecuteAsync&gt;d__2.MoveNext()
--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---

at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)
at System.Web.Http.ApiController.&lt;InvokeActionWithExceptionFilters&gt;d__1.MoveNext()
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, I have to look at all the exceptions with this message and guess which one was thrown based on the request URI and what's going on behind the scenes, or try and reproduce the bug locally with a debugger attached.</p>

<p>MSDN has an article detailing a couple strategies for getting a casualty chain: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj891052.aspx3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj891052.aspx3</a>.  From my understanding, I have two choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use System.Diagnostics.EventListener and take a performance hit at run-time</li>
<li>Create an extension method and use it with every <code>await</code> call</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a better way to log more helpful details about what threw this exception? Having the casualty chain would be nice, but just getting the exception source would be fine (what type and method this was thrown in).</p>

I would like to be called back when the IME is shown/hidden so that I can resize the <code>View</code> accordingly.  I understand that <code>onSizeChanged()</code> should be called each time the IME is shown or hidden, but in my code this is not happening.</p>

<p>I've written a test application in order to get the functionality I'm after, and it contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>Button</code> to toggle the IME (show/hide).</li>
<li>A <code>ScrollView</code> containing several <code>TextView</code>s.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I click on the button (in this test app), then the IME is shown and the <code>ScrollView</code> is resized accordingly.  This is the behaviour I want.  I note that in the test app, the <code>ScrollView</code>'s <code>onSizeChanged()</code> gets called by the framework requesting a layout, and then an <code>invalidate()</code> to redraw
the screen.  This behaviour is missing in my incorrectly-functioning application; there is no call to the <code>ScrollView</code>'s <code>onSizeChanged()</code> or to my implemented <code>View</code>'s <code>onSizeChanged()</code>.</p>

<p>My manifest contains the <code>android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize""</code> attribute, and I've also added <code>isScrollContainer=""true""</code> to the <code>ScrollView</code>'s attribute in the layout xml, but this doesn't appear to make any difference.</p>

<p>Could someone please suggest what it is that I could look at in order to get the <code>onSizeChanged()</code> callback in my <code>View</code>?</p>

<pre><code>[2, 4, 6, 8] since ""String"" is not a number it never got pushed into the array.

        originalBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),R.drawable.colors,opts);
        filteredBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(originalBitmap.getWidth(),originalBitmap.getHeight(), originalBitmap.getConfig());

        //RENDERSCRIPT ALLOCATION
        mRS = RenderScript.create(this);
        mInAllocation = Allocation.createFromBitmap(mRS, originalBitmap,Allocation.MipmapControl.MIPMAP_NONE,Allocation.USAGE_SCRIPT);
        mOutAllocation = Allocation.createTyped(mRS, mInAllocation.getType());

        ScriptC_brightnessfilter helloworldScript = new ScriptC_brightnessfilter(mRS);

        helloworldScript.set_brightnessValue(4.0f);
        helloworldScript.bind_gPixels(mInAllocation);

        helloworldScript.set_gIn(mInAllocation);
        helloworldScript.set_gOut(mOutAllocation);

        helloworldScript.invoke_filter();

    float factor = brightnessValue;
    pixel = pixel + factor;
    pixel = clamp(pixel,0.0f,1.0f);
    *v_out = rsPackColorTo8888(pixel.rgb);

    mImageWidth = rsAllocationGetDimX(gIn);
    rsDebug(""Image size is "", rsAllocationGetDimX(gIn), rsAllocationGetDimY(gOut));

<p>I have a data set that can be accessed here: <a href=""https://github.com/bgurcay/GJT-/blob/master/data.csv"" rel=""nofollow"">data</a>.</p>

<p>The data comes from a study of making estimations. The variables of interest are the question.no (questions), condition, estimate.no (tr.est1 or tr.est2) and  estimate.</p>

<p>The code below makes the plot look almost the way I want it to look at least for one question, yet the median dots generated by stat_summary() are displayed in between the ""violins."" </p>

<pre><code> v.data&lt;-read.csv(""data.csv"")

 # loop through each question number
 d_ply(v.data, c(""question.no""), function(d.plot){
 q.no &lt;- v.data$question.no

   geom_violin() + 
   stat_summary(fun.y=""median"", geom=""point"") + 
   scale_y_continuous('Change Scores') + 
   scale_x_discrete(""Conditions"")

ggsave(filename=paste(q.no,"".png"",sep=""""))

})

<p><strong>My Question:</strong> How can I make the median dots display correctly on the ""violins"" rather than in between them?</p>

<p>I searched the previous questions asked on ggplot2 on this site and looked at the ggplot2 documentation as well as other R forums but have not been able to find anything relevant. </p>

<p>I would appreciate any comments and suggestions as to how I can fix it. Also, if the questions I ask are already answered somewhere else, I would appreciate the links to the threads,too. Many thanks in advance.   </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I changed my method, I tried inject and autowired but it's not suitable for my needs.
What I've done was to implement ApplicationContextAware and set it up as a bean, in the code I use it as follows:</p>

BannerGenericDAO bdao = (BannerGenericDAO) ctx.getBean(""dao"");

<p>I'm new to Spring and in general the servlet world..
Questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>what's the best way of doing this? Is this considered a ""best-practice""?</li>
<li>How do you inject an object, keeping other method fields that are not supplied by autowiring?</li>
<li>How do you get an object to be used throughout the entire application?</li>

else if (pixelData[i] &gt; wLevel - 0.5 + (wWidth - 1) / 2)

<p>The logcat does display Hello, but for some reason, music won't start. But when I move it to another location it does start. Is there a way to do it this way, or do I have to do it another way? I want the music application to pop up once the user clicks the icon. That is why I did the if c.equals(""Music"") part. The reason why it is inside of the try is because this line:</p>

<p>I have set up a network that I'm managing (I'm not mainly a developer) to use Thunderbird as their email client since I have seen repeated mail corruption and loss with Apple Mail.app (in fact, during migration we found that Mail had already mangled some of their folders), but Thunderbird as default client does not seem to work with FileMaker in sending email. Which is strange, because it seems to work on Windows.</p>

<p>Now my questions for FileMaker developers:</p>

<p>Is there a way to make FMP 9 either use SMTP (for free) or to actually send emails (not just open one and fill the fields like with the mailto: protocol - this is needed for mass-mailings like customer newsletters) using Thunderbird as the default client?</p>

<p>Failing that, is there a way to set a mail client to be the default <em>only for FileMaker</em>?
I guess even Mail would be acceptable if it's only used for sending from Filemaker, I could just let it write its sent mails to a specific IMAP folder...</p>

<p>I have a label named <code>welcome</code> in my kernel that points to a string. While testing I tried to look at that string, which gave the following result:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/32b welcome
0x1e &lt;welcome&gt;: 0x00    0xf0    0xa5    0xfe    0x00    0xf0    0x87    0xe9

<p>The label is defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>welcome: db ""System started. Happy hacking!"", 10, 0
</code></pre>

<p>So you can see, gdb is pretending welcome starts with a null byte but by definition it's not. However the kernel uses the label correctly, so it doesn't seem like a poblem with my code. Examining other parts of the memory doesn't match the loaded kernel at all.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why the memory of the virtual machine doesn't match the loaded kernel, while the machine still behaves corectly?</p>

<p>Hi I'm building my first application for android and I've reached a point where I can't find a solution even have no idea what to search for in Google.</p>

<p>So the problem: I am pinging a remote server with GET request through the application passing some parameters like file_id. Then the server gives back confirmation if the file exists or error otherwise, both in plain text. The error string is $$$ERROR$$$. Actually the confirmation is JSON string that holds the path to the file. If the file doesn't exists on the server it generated the error message and start downloading the file and processing it which normally takes 10-30 seconds. What would be the best way to check if the file is ready for download? I have DownloadFile class that extends AsyncTask but before I reach the point to download the file I need the URL which is dependant on the previous request which is in the main class in the UI thread. Here is some code:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity {        
        private String getInfo() {
        // Create a new HttpClient and Post Header
        HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();
        HttpGet httpPost = new HttpGet(infoUrl);
        StringBuilder sb = null;
        String data;
        JSONObject jObject = null;

        try {
            HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpPost);
            // This might be equal ""$$$ERROR$$$"" if no file exists
            sb = inputStreamToString(response.getEntity().getContent());
        } catch(ClientProtocolException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            Log.v(""Error: pushItem ClientProtocolException: "", e.toString());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            Log.v(""Error: pushItem IOException: "", e.toString());
        }

        // Clean the data to be complaint JSON format
        data = sb.toString().replace(""info = "", """");
        try {
            jObject = new JSONObject(data);
            data = jObject.getString(""h"");
            fileTitle = jObject.getString(""title"");
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        downloadUrl = String.format(downloadUrl, fileId, data);

        return downloadUrl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my idea was to get the content and if equal to $$$ERROR$$$ go into loop until JSON data is passed but I guess there is better solution. Note: I don't have control over the server output so have to deal with what I have.</p>

<p>Now when if I inside my NServiceBus Message Handle method I do something like this</p>

<pre><code>using(var trans = session.BeginTransaction())

<p>What is the effect of this on the transaction scope? 
Is trans1 now counted as a nested transaction in terms of its relationship with the Nservicebus transaction even though we have done nothing to marry them up?  (if not how would one link onto the transaction of NServiceBus?</p>

<p>Looking at the second block (trans2), if I uncomment the throw statement, will the NServiceBus transaction then rollback trans1 as well? In basic scenarios, say I dump the above into a console app, then trans1 is independent, commit, flushed and won't rollback. I'm trying to clarify what happens now we sit in someone else's transaction like NServiceBus?</p>

<p>The above is just example code, im wouldnt be working directly with session, more like through a uow pattern.</p>

For example, what is the probability that a patient with 80 <code>karno</code> value, 10<code>diagtime</code>, <code>age</code> 65 and <code>prior=10</code> and <code>trt = 2</code> lives longer than 100 days?</p>

<p>In this case the design matrix is <code>x = (1,0,1,0,80,10,65,10,2)</code></p>

<p>It is possible to <code>autoload</code> classes if the directory structure matches the one of the <code>namespace</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    spl_autoload_extensions("".php""); // comma-separated list
    spl_autoload_register();

<p>However, when I have the following structure:</p>

<p><code>* classes/someclass.php</code></p>

<p><code>* index.php</code></p>

<p>Where <code>someclass.php</code> contains the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    class someclass {

            echo 'It works!';
        }

<pre><code>&lt;?php

<p>Then I get the following error: </p>

<p>I have a table list
I have set up all the delegate so that it displays information from a plist </p>

<p>that works</p>

<p>however when I switched to my custom view for the internal layout, I get the default text of the view but not the text form the plist</p>

<p>Here is some code of the table view controller:</p>

<pre><code>    - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
     UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@""DefaultCell""];

    if(cell == nil){
        cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:@""DefaultCell""];
    }

        EmergencyContactItemConrtroller *genericViewController = [[EmergencyContactItemConrtroller alloc] initWithNibName:@""EmergencyContactItemConrtroller"" bundle:nil];

[genericViewController setInitialParametersWithTitle:[[emergencyArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]objectForKey:@""Title""]
                                        withCatption:[[emergencyArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]objectForKey:@""Caption""]
                                          withNumber:[[emergencyArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]objectForKey:@""Number""]
                                       withOtherInfo:nil];

[cell.contentView addSubview:genericViewController.view];

return cell;

}
</code></pre>

<p>and here is the code of setInitialParametersWithTitle in the cell view controller.</p>

<pre><code>-(void) setInitialParametersWithTitle:(NSString *)title
                         withCatption:(NSString *)caption 
                           withNumber:(NSString *)number
                        withOtherInfo:(NSDictionary *)otherInfo{
    self.titleLable.text = title;
    self.captionLable.text = caption;
    [self.numberButton setTitle:number forState:UIControlStateNormal];
}
</code></pre>

<p>I checked that the xib IBOutlet are linked correctly.</p>

<p>when I try to debug I get he right values send to the function, how ever when I printout self.titleLable.text <strong>before</strong> assigning a value to it, there is no value in it. </p>

<p>Any Ideas ?</p>

<p>I have two tables that contain addresses, delivery and the other invoice, their structure is identical. One table contains invoice addresses and the other contains delivery.</p>

<p>What would be the implications of merging these together into one table simply called ""addresses"", and create a new column called addressTypeId? This new column references a new table that contains address types like delivery, invoice, home etc.</p>

<p>Is having them how they are now, separate, better for performance as requests for the different types of addresses (delivery and invoice) make use of two tables as opposed to one table which might mean delays when requesting address data?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>And I have the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>div.arealist { display: block; clear: both; margin-top: 40px; }
div.arealist&gt;span { display: inline; padding: 25px; }
div.arealist&gt;span label { display: inline; }
div.arealist&gt;span.group { width: 75px; border: 1px solid #d0d0d0; }
div.arealist&gt;span.areas { width: 300px; border: 1px solid #d0d0d0; }
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like so:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/k8fGw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There's two issues with this.  First, the checkboxes on the right side <em>bleed over</em> into the left box, along with the border as well.  The <em>Select All</em> text should be in its own span, and the list of items would all be in the right box.  The second issue is the <em>Item 4</em> checkbox gets broken up into two lines.  I want to treat a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag as a single unit, never to span across multiple lines.</p>

"29536940","1","","","2015-04-09 11:12:57","","1","127","<p>I have a piece of code that marshals synchronizations. There are two types of sync's that need to happen, low priority (initiated by navigation events on a treeview) and high priority (initiated by an exclusive Synchronize from a context menu).</p>

<p>I use a Queue collection to keep track of the items to be Sync'd. With a high priority queue to be processed before items on the low priority. Also, I want to put a limit of say 20 or 30 items on the low priority queue.</p>

<p>So I wrote this code:</p>

<pre><code>// Queue for high priority items.
Queue&lt;SyncItem&gt; syncQueueHighPriority = new Queue&lt;SyncItem&gt;();

// Queue for low priority items.
Queue&lt;SyncItem&gt; syncQueueLowPriority = new Queue&lt;SyncItem&gt;();

// Sync in progress flag.
Boolean syncInProgress = false;

public void SyncHighPriority(object data)
{
    // Add item to queue to be sync'd when ready.
    SyncItem item = new SyncItem { SyncPriority = Priority.High, SharePointListItem = data };
    syncQueueHighPriority.Enqueue(item);

    // Iniate a sync.
    ProcessSync();
}

public void SyncLowPriority(object data)
{
    // Add item to queue to be sync'd when ready if within the limit of the queue.
    SyncItem item = new SyncItem { SyncPriority = Priority.High, SharePointListItem = data };
    if (syncQueueLowPriority.Count &lt; 20)
        syncQueueLowPriority.Enqueue(item);

    // Iniate a sync.
    ProcessSync();
}

private void ProcessSync()
{
    if (syncInProgress)
        return;

    SyncItem item = null;

    // The item will be set by a high priority sync before a low priority item.
    if (syncQueueHighPriority.Count &gt; 0)
        item = syncQueueHighPriority.Dequeue();
    else
    {
        // Set low priority if there are no high priority items.
        if (syncQueueLowPriority.Count &gt; 0)
            item = syncQueueHighPriority.Dequeue();
    }

    // If we have an item to sync, then sync it.
    if (item != null)
        Sync(item);
}

private void Sync(SyncItem itemToSync)
{
    syncInProgress = true;

    // Do sync operations.
    // SYNCSTUFF!

    syncInProgress = false;

    // then process the next item if one exists.
    ProcessSync();
}


// Data classes sample
public class SyncItem
{
    public Priority SyncPriority { get; set; }
    public object SharePointListItem { get; set; }
}

public enum Priority
{
    High = 1,
    Low = 0
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't necessarily think this is the cleanest code because of the fact I have two queues to manage. I would like one collection essentially that always processes high priority items first and limits the amount of low priority items that can be queued.</p>

<p>From reading, I believe C# reactive extensions would be a much better way to approach this.  I'm a complete newbie to it though and it seems very complicated. I've read a few articles but not sure the best way to convert what I have to something that works how I need. Could anyone point me in the right direction of how to convert this to use reactive extensions?</p>

<p>All the tags are closed correctly. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is set to <code>display:block</code> in the CSS.</p>

<p>The W3C validator validates the document and does not mark this structure as incorrect.</p>

<p>The spec states that an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element may be classed as flow content when it contains other flow content. The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> is flow content.</p>

<p>Retrieving them in Python or via the command line produces the correct encoding and all special characters show up the way they are supposed to. However, after retrieving them in Java, most special characters get mangled. </p>

<p>The result looks like this:
RT @okay_password: à¸—à¸µà¹ˆà¹€à¸£à¸²à¹€à¸ˆà¹‡à¸šà¹€à¸£à¸²à¹€à¸ªà¸µà¸¢à¹ƒà¸ˆà¸à¹‡à¹‚à¸—à¸©à¹€à¸‚à¸²à¹„à¸¡à¹ˆà¹„à¸”à¹‰à¸­à¸µà¸à¸™à¸±à¹ˆà¸™à¹à¸«à¸¥à¸° à¸à¹‡à¹€à¸«à¹‡à¸™à¸­à¸¢à¸¹à¹ˆà¸§à¹ˆà¸²à¹€à¸‚à¸²à¹„à¸¡à¹ˆà¹„à¸”à¹‰à¹à¸„à¸£à¹Œà¹€à¸£à¸² à¹à¸•à¹ˆà¹€à¸£à¸²à¸¢à¸±à¸‡à¹€à¸¥à¸·à¸­à¸à¸ˆà¸°à¸­à¸¢à¸¹à¹ˆà¸•à¸£à¸‡à¸™à¸±à¹‰à¸™à¹€à¸­à¸‡ <a href=""http://t.co"">http://t.co</a>/uIâ€¦</p>

<p>or in bytes (from resultSet.getBytes):
52 54 20 40 6F 6B 61 79 5F 70 61 73 73 77 6F 72 64 3A 20 C3 A0 C2 B8 E2 80 94 C3 A0 C2 B8 C2 B5 C3 A0 C2 B9 CB ...</p>

<p>Whereas the correct result should be:
RT @okay_password: ที่เราเจ็บเราเสียใจก็โทษเขาไม่ได้อีกนั่นแหละ ก็เห็นอยู่ว่าเขาไม่ได้แคร์เรา แต่เรายังเลือกจะอยู่ตรงนั้นเอง <a href=""http://t.co/uI"">http://t.co/uI</a>…</p>

<p>(retrieved from the same MySQL table via command line)</p>

<p>or in bytes:
52 54 20 40 6F 6B 61 79 5F 70 61 73 73 77 6F 72 64 3A 20 E0 B8 97 E0 B8 B5 E0 B9 88 E0 B9 80 E0 B8 A3 E0 B8 B2 ...</p>

<p>Note how the first 19 bytes that correspond to western characters match and then it diverges.</p>

<p>Also, the actual output is 2103 bytes long, as opposed to 1047 as it should be.</p>

<p>I've set useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF8 and -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 as recommended by some other post but it does not seem to have any effect.</p>

<p>I've also tried decoding the string with every encoding supported by Java but was not able to decode any substring of the mangled part correctly.</p>

<p>I'm at my wits end; what am I missing? Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The table was created as 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <code>mydb</code>.<code>tweet</code> ( ... )DEFAULT CHARACTER SET = utf8;</p>

<p>MySQL shows:</p>

<p>show variables like 'char%';</p>

<pre><code>+--------------------------+----------------------------+

<p>Does this look like an issue?</p>

<p>Edit2:</p>

<p>Tried the ALTER commands. Now the char sets looks like this but the bytes still come out the same way:</p>

<pre><code>        mysql&gt; show variables like 'char%';
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| Variable_name            | Value                      |

| character_set_connection | latin1                     |

</code></pre>

<p>8 rows in set (0.10 sec)</p>

<p>Meanwhile I realized, I can reproduce the issue in Python. If i run the query via the regular mysql connector, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    import MySQLdb
...
        conn = MySQLdb.connect(host=MySQL_host , user=MySQL_user, passwd=MySQL_pass, db=MySQL_db__)
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(""""""select * from tweet where user_id = '426586170' and time = '2014-03-21+15:10:30';"""""")
        data = cursor.fetchall()
print data[0][3]
</code></pre>

<p>the result shows up fine. On the other hand, if I use Oracle's connector like this:</p>

<pre><code>import mysql.connector
...
            cursor = cnx.cursor()

query = (""SELECT * from tweet WHERE user_id = '426586170' and time = '2014-03-21+15:10:30'"")

cursor.execute(query)

for (tweet_id, user_id, time, text) in cursor:
    print text
</code></pre>

<p>I get the garbled output again:  RT @okay_password: à¸—à¸µà¹ˆà¹€à¸£à¸²à¹€à¸ˆà¹‡à¸šà¹€à¸£à¸² ...</p>

<p>Can anyone make sense of this?</p>

I now have a desktop set up with the same version of MySQL to recover the data but my question is: what do I do? I have about 160 of these files. I haven't yet reinstalled the server in case I need anything else.</p>

<p>Also, as I'm using PhotoRec, it doesn't provide the original filenames. If this is important, how can I get the raw data out of the files and manually rebuild the database?</p>

<p>Edit: I managed to get ahold of the PhotoRec source and add the capability to recover the .myd files (which a bit of digging reveals to be the actual data files), but I can't get the thing to compile, and it ain't because of my mods! Can anyone help with a 'No rule to make target' error in PhotoRec? file_http.o's the culprit.</p>

<p>Here's what I do:</p>

<ol>
<li>nUnit [SetUp] spins up the WebAPI project in IISExpress</li>
<li>SetUp also creates the bus</li>
<li>Send  a HTTP request to the API</li>
<li>Verify whatever I want to verify</li>
</ol>

<p>The WebAPI part of the whole test works fine. The creation of the bus and kicking it off seems great too. It even finds my fake message handler. The problem is the handler never receives the command from the queue, they just stay in the RabbitMQ queue forever.</p>

<p>Here's how the bus is being configured:</p>

<pre><code>var bus = Configure.With()
                   .DefineEndpointName(""Local"")
                   .Log4Net()
                   .UseTransport&lt;global::NServiceBus.RabbitMQ&gt;()
                   .UseInMemoryTimeoutPersister()
                   .RijndaelEncryptionService()
                   .UnicastBus();
                   .CreateBus();
</code></pre>

<p>In the log from NServiceBus starting up, I see that my fake handler is being associated with the command:</p>

<pre><code>2014-09-24 15:29:59,007 [Runner thread] DEBUG NServiceBus.Unicast.MessageHandlerRegistry 
[(null)] &lt;(null)&gt; - Associated 'Bloo.MyCommand' message with 'Blah.FakeMyCommandHandler' handler
</code></pre>

<p>So seeing as the message lands in the correct RabbitMQ queue, I'm assuming everything up until the handler point is working fine.</p>

<p>I've tried putting waits in my [TearDown] so that the bus lives a little longer - hoping to give the handler time to receive the message. I've also tried spinning off the in-memory bus for the consumer part of the interactoin into a new thread with no luck.</p>

<p>Has anyone else tried this?</p>

<p>This is only the first step, what I would love to do is create a fake bus that records messages being sent to it. The need for RabbitMQ is just to get myself going (the bounds of my solution are WebAPI on the front and the bus at the back).</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>When I first tried to fetch all the <i>entry_id</i>s with particular tag, I made query like</p>

<pre><code>SELECT entry_id FROM entry_tag et, tag t 
WHERE t.id=et.tag_id AND t.name LIKE 'Something';
</code></pre>

<p>For no apparent reason query took over 6 secs on Adobe Air app on Win7 x64 (i5-2500K, 8GB RAM, 7200rpm hdd), which is way too slow (particularly with more complex <code>INTERSECT</code> queries). In SQLite command line tool query returned results immediately. I compared <code>EXPLAIN</code> and <code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</code> between cli and Air (using Air based SQLite Sorcerer) and the results where identical. Both queries were using indices.</p>

<p>After I restructured the query by switching the order of the tables, performance got multiplied in Air to 250ms, which is satisfactory:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT entry_id FROM tag t, entry_tag et
WHERE et.tag_id=t.id AND t.name LIKE 'Something';
</code></pre>

<p>So I was left wondering, why the cli tool was so much faster than Adobe Air environment? For background information I have generated the db file with PHP (all columns <code>INTEGER</code> or <code>TEXT</code>). </p>

<p>Here is the query plan for the original slow query:</p>

<pre><code>sele  order          from  deta
----  -------------  ----  ----
0     0              0     SCAN TABLE entry_tag AS et USING INDEX idx_et_eid (~1000000 rows)
0     1              1     SEARCH TABLE tag AS t USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?) (~1 rows)

<p>I'm trying to dynamically cast an object at runtime. (I know a lot of you are going to say it can't be done, and I'm not actually sure if it can...) My problem is that I have a dynamically created <code>TreeView</code> in a <code>Windows Forms Application</code> to display an <code>Org Chart</code>.</p>

<p>The data in the <code>TreeView</code> pulls from 3 tables: <code>Departments</code>, <code>Jobs</code>, <code>Employees</code>.</p>

<p>Importing the <code>Tables</code> as a <code>Local DataSource</code> gives me all 3 Tables as <code>DataSet</code> Objects, and templates for <code>DataRow</code> objects type casted to the table it comes from (including all columns as properties). (Similar to linq - except for Oracle DB)</p>

<p>I create <code>TreeNode</code> objects, use a description field from my <code>DataRow</code> as the <code>TreeNode.Text</code> Property and then attach the <code>DataRow</code> itself as the <code>TreeNode.Tag</code> property. This way, I can access the data from directly within the <code>TreeNode</code> simply by casting:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>dsMyDataSource.DepartmentRow = 
    (dsMyDataSource.DepartmentRow)treeview1.SelectedNode.Tag;
</code></pre>

<p>I have a method that runs whenever the User selects a <code>Node</code> on <code>treeview1</code> that populates a <code>Details</code> window with some of the underlying objects data. As of right now, I have a single method with a switch statement as such:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>private doSomething()
{
    switch(treeview1.SelectedNode.Tag.GetType().Name)
    {
        case ""dsMyDataSource.DepartmentRow"":
            dsMyDataSource.DepartmentRow department = 
                (dsMyDataSource.DepartmentRow)treeview1.SelectedNode.Tag;
            lblDetailsTitle = department.Title;
            break;
        case ""dsMyDataSource.JobRow"":
            //etc...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do, is to have overloaded methods for each type and get rid of my switch statements. Like so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>this.doSomething(treeview1.SelectedNode.Tag);
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is, this returns a base object (thus the cast). But I don't know at compile time what type of TreeNode the User will select. Thus I want to be able to do something like:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>this.doSomething((treeview1.SelectedNode.Tag.GetType())treeview1.SelectedNode.Tag);

private void doSomething(dsMyDataSource.DepartmentRow department)
{
    lblDetailsTitle = department.Title;
    // etc...
}

private void doSomething(dsMyDataSource.JobRow job) {..}

private void doSomething(dsMyDataSource.EmployeeRow employee) {..}

<p>I wanted to test the writing and reading to this db with android test cases so I developed it is follows:</p>

<pre><code>import android.content.ContentValues;
import android.content.Context;
import android.database.Cursor;
import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase;
import android.test.InstrumentationTestCase;
import android.util.Log;

import com.etlie.stockclient.DBManager.DBManager;

public class SQLiteTest extends InstrumentationTestCase {

    DBManager databaseManager;
    SQLiteDatabase dbWrite;
    SQLiteDatabase dbRead;

    ContentValues contentValues;

    protected void setUp() throws Exception{
        super.setUp();

        databaseManager = DBManager.getInstance(getInstrumentation().getContext());

        //TABLE AUTH TEST
        dbWrite = databaseManager.getWritableDatabase();
        dbRead = databaseManager.getReadableDatabase();
        contentValues = new ContentValues();
    }

    public void testReadWriteAuthTable() throws Exception{

        contentValues.put(databaseManager.AUTH_CODE, ""auth code"");
        contentValues.put(databaseManager.SESSION_ID, ""session id"");
        contentValues.put(databaseManager.AUTH_TIME, System.currentTimeMillis());
        contentValues.put(databaseManager.ENCRYPT_KEY, ""encrypt key"");

        dbWrite.insert(databaseManager.TABLE_AUTH, null, contentValues);

        String selectQuery = ""SELECT * FROM "" + databaseManager.TABLE_AUTH;

        Log.i(databaseManager.LOG_TAG, selectQuery);

        Cursor c = dbRead.rawQuery(selectQuery, null);

        if(c!=null)
            c.moveToFirst();

        String authCode = c.getString(c.getColumnIndex(databaseManager.AUTH_CODE));
        String sessionId = c.getString(c.getColumnIndex(databaseManager.SESSION_ID));
        String encryptKey = c.getString(c.getColumnIndex(databaseManager.ENCRYPT_KEY));

        Log.i(""AUTH CODE: "", authCode);
        Log.i(""SESSION ID: "", sessionId);
        Log.i(""ENCRYPT KEY: "", encryptKey);

        assertEquals(authCode, ""auth code"");
        assertEquals(sessionId, ""session id"");
        assertEquals(encryptKey, ""encrypt key"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I ran the test suite it crashed where I tried to initialise the dbWrite</p>

<pre><code>dbWrite = databaseManager.getWritableDatabase();
</code></pre>

<p>and I got the error ""error code = 14, unable to open db"". I had thought that it was something wrong with my db create code etc. </p>

<p>I then tested in a different way by creating a test activity:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.test_activity_layout);

        Button button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);

        button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                DBManager dbManager = DBManager.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
                SQLiteDatabase sqLiteDatabase = dbManager.getWritableDatabase();
                SQLiteDatabase sqLiteDatabase1 = dbManager.getReadableDatabase();

                ContentValues contentValues = new ContentValues();
                contentValues.put(dbManager.AUTH_CODE, ""auth code"");
                contentValues.put(dbManager.SESSION_ID, ""session id"");
                contentValues.put(dbManager.AUTH_TIME, System.currentTimeMillis());
                contentValues.put(dbManager.ENCRYPT_KEY, ""encrypt key"");

                sqLiteDatabase.insert(dbManager.TABLE_AUTH, null, contentValues);


                String selectQuery = ""SELECT * FROM "" + dbManager.TABLE_AUTH;
                Cursor c = sqLiteDatabase1.rawQuery(selectQuery, null);
                if(c!=null)
                    c.moveToFirst();

                String authCode = c.getString(c.getColumnIndex(dbManager.AUTH_CODE));
                String sessionId = c.getString(c.getColumnIndex(dbManager.SESSION_ID));
                String encryptKey = c.getString(c.getColumnIndex(dbManager.ENCRYPT_KEY));

                Log.i(""AUTH CODE: "", authCode);
                Log.i(""SESSION ID: "", sessionId);
                Log.i(""ENCRYPT KEY: "", encryptKey);
            }
        });   
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This logged each entry in the db no problem so I know that data was written and read successfully.  </p>

<p>Can anyone see what might be wrong with the test suite code?  I want to write test cases for this project going forward and if I can't figure this out I can't do so...</p>

<p>I just installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse SDK Ver 3.7.2 (Indigo)</li>
<li>CDT</li>
<li>MinGW</li>
</ul>

<p>I have those two so that I can start to develop C++ on my machine, which is using Windows-XP 32-bit.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got a simple hello-world up and running, and all is peachy... BUT, the problem I have noticed is that everytime I make a new C++ project, it starts it off under Debug mode. I do not know how or why this is, I have gone through just about every option I can see on the menus. </p>

<p>I also do not know how to quickly switch between the modes, and maybe this is hurting me as well, since I am new to Eclipse. </p>

<p>What I want is simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start Eclipse.</li>
<li>Make a new C++ project.</li>
<li>Hit build.</li>
<li>Hit run. (The play button)</li>
<li>Have it run as a release.</li>
<li>""Do something(?)"" to switch to debug mode.</li>
<li>Put a breakpoint somewhere.</li>
<li>Hit build.</li>
<li>Hit debug button (the cockroach)</li>
<li>Have me stop over lines of code.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will cause my hair to remain on my head.</p>

<p>So, When there is a click on this image, the link www.example.com should open in a new tab, since there is target=""_blank"". Also, the onCLick event will call the function ga_track_link which is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>function ga_track_link(action, id, name, source) {
    _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'category 1', action, id+': '+name]);
    _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'category 2', 'example', source, 15]);
}

<p>This function is defined in the script section at the end of the html (inside the body section)</p>

<p>I'm observing in GA, there both events are tracked (category 1 and 2), but the amount of times that both are tracked is not equal. Category 2 appears almost half of times, which makes me think that the 2nd event is not always being fired.</p>

<p>I found this link <a href=""http://support.google.com/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=55527"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.google.com/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=55527</a>
that suggests to put the function ""ga_track_link"" in the head section of the html and use a return False in the onClick function. </p>

<p>According to some other answers like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/855360/when-and-why-to-return-false-in-javascript"">When and why to &#39;return false&#39; in javascript?</a> , the return false statement would tell the event (onClick) not to be fired, which is not what I want, since I do want it to be fired but after my 2 GA events were fired.</p>

<p>So, I have 3 questions:</p>

<p>1) Is there any problem firing more than 1 GA event (with _trackEvent) on 1 click? What is the best way to do it?</p>

<p>2) Why Google Analytics link above states that the function should be placed in the head section of the html?</p>

<p>3) Can someone please clarify the ""return false"" statement's goal and how to use it correctly?</p>

"22556599","1","22628987","","2014-03-21 10:47:08","","7","377","<p>My question is about the conditional test in trial division.  There seems to be some debate on what conditional test to employ.  Let's look at the code for this from  <a href=""http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Primality_by_trial_division#C"" rel=""nofollow"">RosettaCode</a>.</p>

<pre><code>int is_prime(unsigned int n)
{
    unsigned int p;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    /* comparing p*p &lt;= n can overflow */
    for (p = 3; p &lt;= n/p; p += 2)
        if (!(n % p)) return 0;
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Wheel factorization or using a predetermined list of primes will not change the essence of my question.</p>

<p>There are three cases I can think of to do the conditional test:</p>

<ol>
<li>p&lt;=n/p</li>
<li>p*p&lt;=n</li>
<li>int cut = sqrt(n); for (p = 3; p &lt;= cut; p += 2)</li>
</ol>

<p>Case 1: works for all n but it has to do an extra division every iteration (<strong>edit: actually it does not need an extra division but it's still slower.  I'm not sure why.  See the assembly output below)</strong>.  I have found it to be twice as slow as case 2 for large values of n which are prime (on my Sandy Bridge system).</p>

<p>Case 2: is signficantly faster than case 1 but it has a problem that it overflows for large n and goes into an infinitive loop.  The max value it can handle is </p>

<pre><code>(sqrt(n) + c)^2 = INT_MAX  //solve
n = INT_MAX -2*c*sqrt(INT_MAX) + c^2
//INT_MAX = 2^32 -&gt; n = 2^32 - c*s^17 + c^2; in our case c = 2
</code></pre>

<p>For example for uint64_t case 2 will go into an infinite loop for x =-1L-58 (x^64-59) which is a prime.</p>

<p>Case 3: no division or multiplication has to be done every iteration and it does not overflow like case 2.  It's slightly faster than case 2 as well.  The only question is if <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22546534/accuracy-of-sqrt-of-integers"">sqrt(n) is accurate enough</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Can someone explain to me why case 2 is so much faster than case 1?</strong>  Case 1 does NOT use an extra division as I though but despite that it's still a lot slower.</p>

<p>Here are the times for the prime 2^56-5;</p>

<pre><code>case 1 9.0s
case 2 4.6s
case 3 4.5s
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code I used to test this <a href=""http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/69497863a97d8953"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/69497863a97d8953</a>.  I also added the functions to the end of this question.</p>

<p>Here is the assembly output form GCC 4.8 with -O3 for case 1 and case 2.  They both only have one division.  Case 2 has a multiplication as well so my first guess is that case 2 would be slower but it's about twice as fast on both GCC and MSVC.  I don't know why.</p>

<p>Case 1:</p>

<pre><code>.L5:
  testl %edx, %edx
  je  .L8
.L4:
  addl  $2, %ecx
  xorl  %edx, %edx
  movl  %edi, %eax
  divl  %ecx
  cmpl  %ecx, %eax
  jae .L5
</code></pre>

<p>Case 2:</p>

<pre><code>.L20:
  xorl  %edx, %edx
  movl  %edi, %eax
  divl  %ecx
  testl %edx, %edx
  je  .L23
.L19:
  addl  $2, %ecx
  movl  %ecx, %eax
  imull %ecx, %eax
  cmpl  %eax, %edi
  jae .L20
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the functions I'm using to test the time:</p>

<pre><code>int is_prime(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t p;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    /* comparing p*p &lt;= n can overflow */
    for (p = 3; p &lt;= n/p; p += 2)
        if (!(n % p)) return 0;
    return 1;
}

int is_prime2(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t p;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    /* comparing p*p &lt;= n can overflow */
    for (p = 3; p*p &lt;= n; p += 2)
        if (!(n % p)) return 0;
    return 1;
}

int is_prime3(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t p;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    /* comparing p*p &lt;= n can overflow */
    uint32_t cut = sqrt(n);
    for (p = 3; p &lt;= cut; p += 2)
        if (!(n % p)) return 0;
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Added content after the bounty.</strong></p>

<p>Aean discovered that in case one saving the quotient as while as the remainder is just as fast (or slightly faster) than case two.  Let's call this case 4.  The following following code is twice as fast as case 1.</p>

<pre><code>int is_prime4(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t p, q, r;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    for (p = 3, q=n/p, r=n%p; p &lt;= q; p += 2, q = n/p, r=n%p)
        if (!r) return 0;
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why this helps.  In any case there is no need to use case 2 anymore.  For case 3, most versions of the <code>sqrt</code> function in hardware or software get the perfect squares right so it's safe to use in general.  Case 3 is the only case that will work with OpenMP.</p>

<p>It looks like it hinges on the fact that, my <code>Mage</code> model holds a FK to the django defined <code>User</code>, and django-rest-frameworks needs to do some magic to connect the two up. But the fact that I'm using inheritance is somehow blocking django-rest-frameworks mojo.</p>

I got a table view, that works like a stack of ""albums"". Each cell redirect the user to the corresponding collection view, where I load the images.

<p>The ""albumList"" is a NSMutableDictionary, and each value of a key (that represents a folder) is a NSMutableArray. After each new picture taken, I reload the collection view and place the picture there.
But, as expected, this way I'll get a memory warning, mainly because I'm saving the original image in the array, I guess.</p>

<p>So my question is, what's the best way to accomplish this?
I thought about saving the URL of the image in the array, and then when I need it I would retrieve this images with the URL and show them in the collection view.
Another thought was to save directly to a document, without needing a array, but I think that way I would have too much processing each time I would retrieve and show the images.</p>

<p>So, anyone knows which approach I should take?
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>Idea</strong></p>

<p>Maybe the writer closes and unlinks the pipes before the data is read from them? If so, what should I do to prevent that?</p>

<p>If put a <code>sleep(10)</code> before that, it wont' change behaviour, it will just read the two first strings, but it will take more time and then it will hang up (because it waits the ending strings).</p>

<pre><code>[assembly: NeutralResourcesLanguage(""en-US"")]
</code></pre>

<p>Under a \Resources\ directory, I have <strong>FrameworkResources.resx</strong> and <strong>FrameworkResources.fr-FR.resx</strong></p>

<p>In a helper class, I am using this as my resource manager:</p>

<pre><code>private static ResourceManager manager = new ResourceManager(""Framework.Resources.FrameworkResources"", Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
</code></pre>

<p>In code, if I do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>String message = manager.GetString(""ArgumentNullExceptionMessage"", CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);
</code></pre>

<p>I can debug and hover over CurrentCulture and it (and UICulture) are set to fr-FR, yet this ALWAYS brings back my default, english message - NOT the French message from the fr-FR resource file.</p>

<p>Should ResourceManager automatically wire that up, or should I be writing code to query the current culture, then open the right file? Am I incorrect in assuming that Resource Manager will know to get the fr-FR string, because that is the current culture?</p>

<p>I'm not sure why this isn't working.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I have satellite assemblies, so believe the compilation part is going OK. I think the problem is in my resource manager. I tried using ResourceSets and using ResourceManager explicitly like this:</p>

<pre><code>ResourceManager manager =
    new ResourceManager(""Framework.Resources.FrameworkResources"",
        Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());

Debug.WriteLine(""de-DE : "" + manager.GetString(resourceName, new CultureInfo(""de-DE"")));
Debug.WriteLine(""el    : "" + manager.GetString(resourceName, new CultureInfo(""el"")));
Debug.WriteLine(""es-MX : "" + manager.GetString(resourceName, new CultureInfo(""es-MX"")));
Debug.WriteLine(""fr-FR : "" + manager.GetString(resourceName, new CultureInfo(""fr-FR"")));
Debug.WriteLine(""hi    : "" + manager.GetString(resourceName, new CultureInfo(""hi"")));
Debug.WriteLine(""zh-CN : "" + manager.GetString(resourceName, new CultureInfo(""zh-CN"")));
</code></pre>

<p>That results in this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>de-DE : Argument '%ArgumentName%' cannot be null or empty.
el    : Argument '%ArgumentName%' cannot be null or empty.
es-MX : Argument '%ArgumentName%' cannot be null or empty.
fr-FR : Argument '%ArgumentName%' cannot be null or empty.
hi    : Argument '%ArgumentName%' cannot be null or empty.
zh-CN : Argument '%ArgumentName%' cannot be null or empty.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So, even though everything is in place, my resource manager simply isn't trying to look in those satellite assemblies. And to be clear, in those assemblies, I have the translated version of the string above - so it's definitely reading from my default FrameworkResources.resx file, instead of the culture-specific ones.</p>

"16824189","1","16824373","","2013-05-29 21:30:02","","0","1724","<p>I have a database (MySQL 5.1) that uses a cross reference table (local_ref in the example below) to get an numerical ID for a value. I've introduced another cross reference table (foreign_ref, below) to reference these numerical IDs to an index in another database. Normally that's not a complicated join, however, I have multiple columns that use the keys from the cross referenced table (val1 and val2, below).</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select * from foo;
+-----+------+------+
| id  | val1 | val2 |
+-----+------+------+
| 100 | A    | B    |
| 200 | A    | D    |
| 300 | B    | C    |
+-----+------+------+

mysql&gt; select * from local_ref;
+----+-------+
| id | value |
+----+-------+
|  1 | A     |
|  2 | B     |
|  3 | C     |
|  4 | D     |
|  5 | E     |
+----+-------+

mysql&gt; select * from foreign_ref;
+----------+------------+
| local_id | foreign_id |
+----------+------------+
|        1 |         10 |
|        2 |         20 |
|        3 |         30 |
|        4 |         40 |
+----------+------------+
</code></pre>

<p>What I need is the following:</p>

<pre><code>+-----+---------+---------+
| id  | val1_id | val2_id |
+-----+---------+---------+
| 100 | 10      | 20      |
| 200 | 10      | 40      |
| 300 | 20      | 30      |
+-----+---------+---------+
</code></pre>

<p>Knowing that the original table isn't normalized as it should be, I've achieved the results the following two ways:</p>

<p>Aliasing both cross-reference tables twice:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
FOO.id, F_R1.foreign_id, F_R2.foreign_id
FROM FOO 
JOIN
Local_Ref as L_R1 ON (FOO.val1 = L_R1.value)
JOIN
Local_Ref as L_R2 ON (FOO.val2 = L_R2.value)
JOIN
Foreign_Ref as F_R1 ON (L_R1.id = F_R1.local_id)
JOIN
Foreign_Ref as F_R2 ON (L_R2.id = F_R2.local_id)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Joining the cross-reference tables twice and aliasing each join.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
FOO.id, joint1.foreign_id, joint2.foreign_id
FROM
FOO
JOIN
(
SELECT * FROM Local_Ref JOIN Foreign_Ref ON Local_Ref.id = Foreign_Ref.local_id
) as joint1
ON FOO.val1 = joint1.value
JOIN
(
SELECT * FROM Local_Ref JOIN Foreign_Ref ON Local_Ref.id = Foreign_Ref.local_id
) as joint2
ON FOO.val2 = joint2.value
</code></pre>

<p>I feel like both approaches are pretty inefficient and could be improved. Aside from reconstructing the database, are there any more efficient solutions?</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct tree_s{
    struct tree_s *a;
    int b;
}tree_t;
</code></pre>

<p>Which, at the moment, I am initializing in this way:</p>

<pre><code>tree_t branch_n = {
    .a = NULL,
    .b = 2
};

tree_t root = {
    .a = (tree_t*) &amp;branch_n,

<p>Now, it annoys me that I have to initialize the lower branches before the root because the complete structure is quite large, with the branches having branches on their own, making my code hard to manage.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>tree_t root = {
    .a = 
     //The first branch
     {                 
        .a =

         { //Since the following is actually an array, I need the 
           // ""a"" above to point to the first index
             {  
                 .a = NULL,         //Maybe this will have its own branch

                     .b = 5
                 }
                 .b = 4  
             }
         }
        .b = 2
     }, 
    .b = 1
};
</code></pre>

<p>How can I achieve an initialization like this?</p>

<p>The main reason I want to do this is to greatly enhance the overview of my code and immediately visually see the structure of the ""Tree"".</p>

<p>Note that the structure of the complete ""Tree"" is know from the start which is why I consider the structure constant. The value b however may be changed at any time.</p>

Updated PHP to version 5.3 and it now gives me this message,</p>

<p>Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'You cannot serialize or unserialize PDO instances' in [no active file]:0 Stack trace: #0 [internal function]: PDO->__sleep() #1 {main} thrown in [no active file] on line 0</p>

<p>However, I'm not using the serialize or unserialize function...</p>

<p><strong>Update!</strong></p>

<p>This works, but it is the incorrect and ugliest way of doing it. And I don't want to do it like this, but I figured that it might help</p>

<pre><code>$db    = new PDO(""mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=dbname;"", ""user"", ""pass"");
public function login($user, $pass) {
    global $db;
    //stuff

<p><strong>ORIGINAL POST</strong></p>

<p>I just switched over my project files to my web host (it works perfectly locally).</p>

<p>I'm getting this error, Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0.</p>

<p>It is oh so helpful. I am only including one file right now, it's a class with one function which counts the IDs of the entered username and password and then either returns true or false depending on what it found. (1 = true, anything but 1 = false).</p>

<p>I'm using PDO (mysql), and if I don't connect to my database I don't get the error but if I remove the session_start(); from the top of my document I also don't get the error.
    private $db;</p>

<pre><code>public function __construct() {
    $this-&gt;db = new PDO(""mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=dbname;"", ""user"", ""pass"");
    $this-&gt;db-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is where I set the session,</p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_POST[""submit""])) {
    $errors = array();
    if($user-&gt;login($_POST[""user""], $_POST[""pass""]) === false) {
        $errors[] = ""Username or password is incorrect"";
    }
    if(empty($errors)) {
        $_SESSION[""user""] = $_POST[""user""];
        header(""Location: index.php"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am not actually throwing an exception, anywhere. I don't know what this error means. I am running PHP Version 5.2.17</p>

<p>Here is my login function,</p>

<pre><code>public function login($user, $pass) {
    $sql = $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare(""SELECT COUNT(`id`) FROM `users` WHERE `username` = :user AND `password` = :pass"");
    $sql-&gt;bindParam("":user"", $user);

The problem is, I want to ""move"" this COM object entirely on a different thread.</p>

<p>What I do is this: </p>

<ul>
<li>create the new thread I want to move the object into (with CreateThread API)</li>
<li>after entering this thread, I'm calling PeekMessage to setup a message queue for it</li>
<li>calling CoInitialize, CoCreateInstance to create the COM object, QueryInterface to get the interface I want</li>
<li>finally I call a method on the interface that displays a MessageBox with the value returned by GetCurrentThreadId() (I have access to the VB6 code of the COM library within which the object resides).</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is, as this message box shows, the object methods are still executed on the original UI thread, not on the thread I created and done all those steps into. One more thing to mention, after calling the interface method, I'm also setting up a classic message loop in it.</p>

<p>How can I change this behaviour and achieve what I want? (that is, I want the COM object calls that originate from my newly created thread to be executed ON IT, not on the original application thread)</p>

<p>Here's some pseudocode to make it even more clearer:</p>

<pre><code>void myMainUIMethod(){
  MessageBox(GetCurrentThreadId()); // displays 1
  CreateThread(&amp;myCOMObjectThreadProc);
}
void myCOMObjectThreadProc(){
  MessageBox(GetCurrentThreadId()); // displays 2
  CoInitialize(NULL);
  myObject = CoCreateInstance(myObjectsCLSID);
  myObjectInterface = myObject-&gt;QueryInterface(myObjectInterfaceCLSID);
  myObjectInterface-&gt;showThreadIDMessageBox(); // this would be the COM object method call
}

And, in the VB6 code of the object, here's the pseudo-definition of showThreadIDMessageBox.
Public Sub showThreadIDMessageBox()
  Call MessageBox(GetCurrentThreadId()) //displays 1, I want it to display 2
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I have achieved what I wanted by CoUninitalizing on the main thread, before creating the new thread. But why does this happen? If COM was initialized ON THE MAIN THREAD before I'm creating the new thread, maybe for some reason it had to be..I would't want the application to crash later because I had to call CoUninitialize before creating my new thread. Here's some pseudocode that illustrates that whichever thread calls CoInitialize first will be the one picked by the STA objects.</p>

<pre><code>void myMainUIMethod(){
  MessageBox(GetCurrentThreadId()); // displays 1
  CoUninitialize(); // uninitialize COM on the main thread
  CreateThread(&amp;myCOMObjectThreadProc);
  ***i: MessageBox(""When you want to initialize COM on main thread, confirm this"");
  CoInitialize();
}
void myCOMObjectThreadProc(){
  MessageBox(GetCurrentThreadId()); // displays 2
  ***ii: MessageBox(""When you want to initialize COM on the new thread, confirm this"");
  CoInitialize(NULL);
  myObject = CoCreateInstance(myObjectsCLSID);
  myObjectInterface = myObject-&gt;QueryInterface(myObjectInterfaceCLSID);
  myObjectInterface-&gt;showThreadIDMessageBox(); // this shows 2 IF ***ii is confirmed before ***i, 1 otherwise
}

<p>I have few questions related to this exception. </p>

<ol>
<li>Was this exception thrown due to some error occurred in my end or the remote end? Is this because I might be trying to write to a closed TCP connection?</li>
<li>I see <code>Mono.Security.Protocol....</code> at the bottom of the stack. Is it some issue with the SSL wrapper that I am using instead of the underlying TCP stream?</li>
<li>Is this because the remote server seems to be not allowing more than one connection from the same host at a time? (I sometimes try to create more than one SSL connection to the server.)</li>
<li>I am using Mono 4.0.1 + Monodevelop 5.9 on Ubuntu 14.04 x64. I referred to <a href=""https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=25402"" rel=""nofollow"">this bug</a> in Xamarin, I doubt that is related to this very exception that I am getting and I need to know whether this is because of a bug in mono implementation of SslStream.</li>
</ol>

Random numbers being, well, random, ideally I'd like to generate them on multiple cores, since random number generation is > 50% of my runtime in profiling.  However, I'm having difficulty distributing a large number of small tasks in a way that's not slower than the single-threaded approach.</p>

<p>My code currently looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0;i&lt;1000000;i++){
    for(RealVector d:data){
        while(!converged){
            double[] shortVec = new double[5];

            double[] longerVec = new double[50];
            for(int i=0;i&lt;50;i++) longerVec[i]=rng.nextGaussian();
            /*Do some relatively fast math*/
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Approaches I've taken that have <i>not</i> worked are:</p>

<ul>
<li>1+ threads populating an ArrayBlockingQueue, and my main loop consuming and populating the array (the boxing/unboxing was killer here)</li>
<li>Generating the vectors with a Callable (yielding a future) while doing the non-dependent parts of the math (it appears the overhead of the indirection outweighed whatever parallelism gains I got)</li>
<li>Using 2 ArrayBlockingQueue, each populated by a thread, one for the short and one for the long arrays (still roughly twice as slow as the direct single-threaded case).</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not looking for ""solutions"" to my particular problem so much as how to handle the general case of generating large streams of small, independent primitives in parallel and consuming them from a single thread.</p>

I'm using an skaction to move it in the direction I clicked on and didbegincontact to find when it collides with the wall, but it often starts to go through the wall before it registers the collision.</p>

<p>Here's how I shoot:</p>

<pre><code>var offset: CGPoint = rwSub(location, b: player.position);
                var direction = rwNormalize(offset);
                var shootAmount = rwMult(direction, b: 1000);

                var realMoveDuration = Double(self.frame.size.width) / velocity;
                var actionMove:SKAction =  SKAction.moveTo(realDest, duration: realMoveDuration)

                firstFormed = true
                portal1.runAction(actionMove)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the physics body of the projectile:  </p>

<pre><code> body.affectedByGravity = false
            body.categoryBitMask = firstPort
            body.collisionBitMask = wallCategory
            body.contactTestBitMask = wallCategory

            body.allowsRotation = false
            body.restitution = 1
            self.physicsBody = body
</code></pre>

<p>I need to get the point where the projectile first strikes an object and determine if its the bottom left, bottom right, center left, center right, top left, or top right of the object.  Right now it sometimes strikes the bottom of the object, but doesn't recognize the collision until its part of the way through the object, resulting in it being added to the top.</p>

<p>The tests complete fine in these scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the remote page is accessed directly from any browser <em>without</em> Fiddler or another proxy running</li>
<li>When Phantom runs the tests from a command prompt <em>with</em> Fiddler open and running</li>
</ul>

<p>Oddly if I don't have fiddler open monitoring the requests, the AJAX requests I'm testing never seem to initialize. I've checked my default IE LAN Settings and there is no proxy enabled, I've also tried flipping the Auto Detect Settings checkbox there and no change.</p>

<p>Any thoughts??</p>

<p>Details on my setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>Node v0.10.4</li>
<li>Latest <code>grunt-contrib-qunit</code></li>
<li>Windows 8</li>
<li>QUnit is divided into 4 or 5 modules with setup and teardown tasks in some modules, asynchronous and synchronous tests, and autorun is set to false.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>If I turn off the options in Fiddler for ""Reuse client connections"" and ""Reuse connections to servers"" I seem to get the same failure behavior as when Fiddler is off. This led me to believe its a problem with connections being closed prematurely, so I tried setting a custom keep-alive header -- but it still errors out.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>I still question this because the page itself loads fine, but the requests fail, but it looks like this could possibly be related to NTLM authentication. Fiddler might somehow facilitating the handshake. There is an <a href=""https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11037"" rel=""nofollow"">open issue for NTLM on the Phantom github page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong></p>

<p>After continued troubleshooting this evening it looks like the issue is only with authentication on POST requests. GET requests seem to work fine. I'm working <em>around</em> this for now by routing all requests through an ASHX handler and thus dropping the auth component. Only thing I had to change was to disable web security on phantom to allow the cross-domain requests through.</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEMATIC</strong>
If I have to return 20 rows of ordered messages (notifications and chats) I can either :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get 10 last notifications, then 10 last chats, but then the 9th chat might be much older than the 11th notification</p></li>
<li><p>check the date of the newest chat, if the 20th newest notification is older, get only notifications, otherwise ... I don't know</p></li>
<li><p>Get 20 newest notifications, 20 newest chats order them and send hem to the client but it could be a heavy task for a server that serves many requests at the same time.</p></li>

<p>If you wanted to count number of lines it contains you could do <code>cat foo.txt | wc -l</code> and unsurprisingly enough the output would presumably be <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>But if you’d open the file with a pager, such as <code>less</code>, like <code>less foo.txt</code> then what your eyes would actually see are two lines instead (AFAIK, unless you don’t say <code>--chop-long-lines</code>, <code>less</code> will “wrap"" lines that are longer than your terminal’s width).</p>

<p>Again, if you’d try to see line numbers, using <code>less</code>, like <code>less --LINE-NUMBERS foo.txt</code>, than the output would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>1 something something...
1 more stuff
</code></pre>

<p>Basically <code>less</code> is “aware” that the only line in <code>foo.txt</code> is longer than your terminal’s width, so it will “wrap” it to visualize, but will tell you that actually first and the second lines that you see are actually the same line #1 in <code>foo.txt</code>.</p>

<p>So, my question is: how could you “calculate” (say, in bash) number of lines <em>after</em> wrapping (number of lines that your eyes see), rather than number of lines that the file actually contains? (In scenario above, the number would be <code>2</code> instead of <code>1</code>.)</p>

        render: function() {
            $(this.el).html(this.template({alphabetlist:this.collection.toJSON()}));
            return this;
        }

    });

    return AlphabetListView;

}
</code></pre>

<p>So, what I want to do is, to create an API for each letter, using the RESTful API plugin from Codeigniter. I create an API for each letter. For example like this for the letter <strong>C</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;?php

  require(APPPATH.'libraries/REST_Controller.php');

 class Cartists extends REST_Controller{

 public function index_get()  
 { 
  $this-&gt;load-&gt;database();
  $sql = 'SELECT id, name FROM artists WHERE name LIKE=""C%""';
  $query = $this-&gt;db-&gt;query($sql);
  $data = $query-&gt;result();

  if($data) {
      $this-&gt;response($data, 200); // 200 being the HTTP response code
    } else {
     $this-&gt;response(array('error' =&gt; 'Couldn\'t find any artists with letter c!'), 404);
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in my Backbone Model I do:</p>

<pre><code>function($, Backbone) {
var CartistsModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
    url: ""../ci/index.php/api/cartists/index"",

    defaults: {
        ""id"": '',
        ""name"": ''
    }
});

return CartistsModel ;
});
</code></pre>

<p>And my Collection:</p>

<pre><code>function(Backbone, CartistsModel ) {
var CartistsCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: CartistsModel ,
    url: ""../ci/index.php/api/cartists/index""
});

return CartistsCollection;
 });
</code></pre>

<p>Now my goal is that I get the right collection after clicking the relevant letter. For example clicking the letter C, it shows me all artists with the letter C. When I click letter M, it shows me all artists with M etc etc. I feel i'm close, but right now I'm kind of lost or dont really know how to solve this... </p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>So, I was trying to create a backbone application using requireJS by following <a href=""http://backbonetutorials.com/organizing-backbone-using-modules/"">Thomas Davis's tutorial</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do I go create Backbone collections out of an ajax call to a server that provides data in XML? collections.fetch() seem to be expecting a JSON backend.</p></li>
<li><p>while trying some things, I ended up with the following code, in which the page doesn't refresh upon populating the collection ""bookStore"" from within Ajax success-callback.</p>

<p>Here is how far I have gotten so far.</p>

<pre><code>var bookListView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: $(""#books""),

        thisView = this;
        $.ajax({
            type: ""GET"",

                    var bookTitle = $(this).find('name').text();
                    bookStore.add({ title: bookTitle });

                    console.log(seid);
                });
                thisView.collection = bookStore;
                thisView.collection.bind('add', thisView.tryBind);

            }
        }).done(function (msg) {
            alert(""Data retrieved: "" + msg);
        });

        this.collection = bookStore;
        this.collection.bind(""add"", this.exampleBind);
        this.collection.bind(""refresh"", function () { thisView.render(); });
        /*
        // This one works!
        bookStore.add({ name: ""book1"" });
        bookStore.add({ name: ""book2"" });
        bookStore.add({ name: ""book3"" });

    },
    tryBind: function (model) {
        console.log(model);

    render: function () {
        var data = {
            books: this.collection.models,

    }
});

</ol>

<p>Here, the success call-back in the ""initialize"" function seems to be processing the data properly and adding to the collection. However, the page doesn't refreshed. </p>

<p>While I was stepping through the Firebug console, the page gets refreshed however. How do I solve this problem? </p>

Note that the post request is made continuously. So the session variable keeps on changing. Well here is the little code for that-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?PHP
session_start();
include 'db.inc.php';

if(isset($_POST['data']){
$data_decode = (array)json_decode($_POST['data']);
$data_var1 = $data_decode['var1'];
$data_var2 = $data_decode['var2'];
$data_var3 = $data_decode['var3'];
$date = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
$_SESSION['time'] = $date;  //Set the session with current time
$sql = ""UPDATE `table` SET row1=$data_var1, row2=$data_var2 WHERE row3=$data_var3"";
$result = mysqli_query($db,$link) or die('Table could not be updated');
echo ""Following data inserted: row1=$data_var1, row2=$data_var2, at $_SESSION['time']""; //Echoing the data and time as expected
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I have another page on the same domain, which makes the ajax request and fetches out the data every second from the SQL table I just inserted the data into. So here is the whole scenario- The client python script makes the post request to the webpage, which updates the sql with the received data, sets the session variable. Another page simultaneously fetches that data out using ajax and shows it. </p>

<p>Now I am calling the session variable on another page as shown-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
session_start();
if(isset($_SESSION['time']){ echo $_SESSION['time']; } //Didn't echoes anything
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I used <code>&lt;?php print_r($_SESSION) ?&gt;</code> to check whether the session variable is set or not, it echoed ""Array()"", which means my session variable is not set. So my question is, What I am doing wrong and how can I correct it?</p>

The most obvious was  <a href=""http://www.musicalnerdery.com/net-programming/reading-a-file-sequentially-using-multiple-threads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> but in the end what im wondering is how well my code is implemented.</p>

<p>I have basically two classes. One is the <strong>Converter</strong> and the other is <strong>ConverterThread</strong></p>

<p>I create an instance of this Converter class that has a property ThreadNumber that tells me how many threads should be run at the same time (this is read from user) since this application will be used on multi-cpu systems (physically, like 8 cpu) so it is suppossed that this will speed up the import</p>

<p>The Converter instance reads a file that can range from 100mb to 800mb and each line of this file is a tab-delimitted value record that is imported to another destination like a database.</p>

<p>The ConverterThread class simply runs inside the thread (new Thread(ConverterThread.StartThread)) and has event notification so when its work is done it can notify the Converter class and then I can sum up the progress for all these threads and notify the user (in the GUI for example) about how many of these records have been imported and how many bytes have been read.</p>

<p>It seems, however that I'm having some trouble because I get random errors about the file not being able to be read or that the sum of the progress (percentage) went above 100% which is not possible and I think that happens because threads are not being well managed  and probably the information returned by the event is malformed (since it ""travels"" from one thread to another)</p>

<p>Do you have any advise on better practices of implementation of threads so I can accomplish this?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>My biggest problem here is the way ROS is hooked to PCL. Even though PCL is now more or less officially an external dependency the way ROS handles the situation is...Well, not very nice. I've experienced similar (maybe even the same - can't remember) issues with OpenCV - yet another dependency that was decided to be made completely external - when I decided to build it from source in order to add support Qt, OpenGL etc, which are not in the upstream packages of the library in the Ubuntu repositories. There is this thing <strong>ROS perception</strong>, which is supposed to add the glue between ROS and PCL.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Adding NURBS (part of the <strong>surface</strong> module)</p>

<p><strong>What I have done so far:</strong></p>

<p>I have</p>

<ul>
<li>downloaded and built PCL 1.7.1 (the same version as the one shipped with Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS) with NURBS enabled</li>
<li>(1) installed PCL from source - ROS' PCL support broke</li>
<li>(2) replaced only the surface library (also added all the includes etc. dependencies for it and nurbs from my build) - ROS' PCL support broke</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently I'm struggling to find out how to manually force CMake (and thus also <strong>catkin_make</strong>) to use my own version (not installed, only built). But I fear this will again interfere with ROS.</p>

<p>What is your advice for me in this situation? How can I proceed without yet again breaking my ROS installation? I would really like to learn how to add such missing bits and pieces - as mentioned above - I have already faced this issue once, now this and it will probably happen again.</p>

<p><strong>PS for those who say ""This is a ROS issue"":</strong> I've already posted on ROS answers a week ago but there is still no reply and the views indicator of 11 (became so shortly after posting there - a week ago) is discouraging to say the least. The chances of any development there a week after posting the question are slim to none. I have been struggling with this issue for more then 2 weeks now...</p>

Initially I had relative links for the navigation but after integrating my forum system, I was forced to switch to absolute links since the header was being included in sub directory files. Unfortunately, I now need to include a file via a relative link in order for it to work with my forums system due to a security feature that I can't change. If I try it with an absolute link, it simply returns a 403 error. Is there some way that I can have a ""variable"" relative path depending on the location of file that the header is included in?

<p>which is implemented in my SurfaceView. In the activity of this view, I get a Camera instance:</p>

<p>public class CameraActivity extends Activity {</p>

<pre><code>private Camera mCamera;
private CameraView mPreview;

@Override

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_camera);

    // Create an instance of Camera
    mCamera = getCameraInstance();      
    // Create our Preview view and set it as the content of our activity.
    mPreview = new CameraView(this, mCamera);
    FrameLayout preview = (FrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.camera_view);

    mPreview.pause();

}



@Override

    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    super.onResume();
    mPreview.resume();
}



/** A safe way to get an instance of the Camera object. */
public static Camera getCameraInstance(){
    Camera c = null;
    try {
        c = Camera.open(); // attempt to get a Camera instance

        // Camera is not available (in use or does not exist)
    }
    return c; // returns null if camera is unavailable
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>which is then passed to the SurfaceView constructor as an argument. In the LogCat, when I print the Camera object (like in the first code block I posted), I get several times a valid Camera object, but now and then there are some nulls which appear for reasons beyond my comprehension.

Both controls are data bound to properties on a data class instance.  The textbox is for price, the check box to indicate that the price is a price override.  Also on the data class is a property that holds the item's original price.</p>

<p>I would like the controls to respect the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the user enters a value into the price textbox, the checkbox is automatically checked to indicate they are overriding the price value</li>
<li>When the check box is un-checked, the item's price is restored to the original price.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the user unchecks the checkbox, the event handler tests the checked state, and sets the item's price property to the original price value.  However, the price value being databound, a bind event is fired, which updates the textbox value, which fires the text changed event handler which re-checks the checkbox. </p>

<p>I've attempted to trap the conditions where I'm explicitly updating something that would trigger a control change event.  This only works for part of it though.  The textbox change event fires other times that are outside my control, such as when databinding fires when the form is initially shown.</p>

<p>I've been searching around and I guess I'm just not coming up with the right search terms to find what I'm looking for.  It seems that databinding is all wonderful and nifty until you need to do something pratical with it, like having two bound controls interact with each other.  There just doesn't seem to be a way to discriminate between what triggered the control events.</p>

<p>I've also looked at the events available on the binding source component but there doesn't seem to be anything there that is any more useful.  I can handle the event that fires after binding is complete, but that's after the problems occur.</p>

<p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>

The network server is developed for .NET 4.5, it uses:</p>

<ul>
<li>IOCP (Socket.xxxAsync)</li>
<li>a Buffer Pool of preallocated SocketAsyncEventArgs (used for SendAsync and ReadAsync)</li>
<li>a Buffer Pool of preallocated byte[] (used only for read)</li>
<li>System.Collections.Concurrent</li>
<li>Less than zero locks (well, actually there is one :))</li>
<li>some other stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>My concerns are related to the garbage collection, infact, as far i understand, while i avoid the memory fragmentation preallocating all the buffers i need, the garbage collector check if them must be collected or not because they aren't allocated inside the large heap.</p>

<p>Would be better, instead to allocate 10.000 byte[8192] would be better allocate a big byte[81920000] and use ArraySegment to use slices?</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>I switched to server mode garbage collection and it seems that my system works better than before (actually i'm able to handle up to 4GiB of traffic with 5000 clients on the same machine, this means 10000 sockets).
I'll start to test the architecture on more machine in short.</p>

I then experimented by setting the <code>Copy Files</code> to <code>Product Directory</code>; this copied the assets folder to the build folder, but the .app file still won't load in the assets.</p>

<p>Did I miss something? Could some XCode vets help me out here, I've attempted to fix this for the past few days. Thanks.</p>

<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/Xq4Hxh4d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/Xq4Hxh4d</a> (Here's the top of my DataLoader as mentioned above. EDIT: Added in my check for nullptr return, yes, it returns true if failed).</p>

<p>P.S I can only give out snippets of my code, I have given what I feel is most likely the problem, resource loading :)</p>

<p>The full crash report is in the comments below.</p>

<p>The fix, thanks to the help from Brad Allred:</p>

<p>The resources are located within the .app file, specifically {Application}/Contents/Resources ; in my case I wanted to access a file within assets. I did a build phase to copy the data to the resources folder, making my directory {Application}/Contents/Resources/Assets/../. Using SDL_GetBasePath I'm able to create a string which is the absolute path from your base directory up to the Resources folder.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>if(Doc.LoadFile(""assets/Data.xml""))
{
    std::string path = (std::string)SDL_GetBasePath() + ""assets/Data.xml"";
    if(Doc.LoadFile(path.c_str()))
    {
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I concat the base path + whatever data I need, and pass the .c_str() version to tinyXML. If I find a better/cleaner version I'll be sure to update it here.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have been developing using the Spring MVC framework for some time now however I am struggling to come up with a 'nice' way to pass errors that are raised in the service layer back to the JSP.</p>

<p>Basically, I don't believe that business logic (beyond ""this field is mandatory"") should be in the Validators, especially any logic that requires access to the DB. So, what I have been doing is placing further, more complicated validation and business logic in the service layer.</p>

<p>For example, lets say I have a page that allows a user to buy a Book. They click ""Purchase"" on the JSP and the controller calls the service to make it all happen... Now, what happens if the service sees that they have insufficient funds - how do I get this message back to the JSP so a nice little ""Insufficient funds"" message can be displayed to the user? I have considered two ways and I'm not sure which is correct...</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>The first way I thought was to raise an exception in the service layer, trap it in the controller and add a message to the BindingResult.</p>

<p>Service:</p>

<pre><code>public void pay(Book book) throws InsufficientFundsException {
    // Some logic goes here, which ends up throwing the above exception
}
</code></pre>

<p>Controller:</p>

<pre><code>public ModelAndView(@ModelAttribute(""book"") Book book, BindingResult errors) {
    try {
        pay(book);
    } catch (InsufficientFundsException ex) {
        errors.reject(""insufficient.funds"");
    }
    return new ModelAndView(blahblahblah);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 2: Pass BindingResult to Service layer</strong></p>

<p>The second way was to pass the BindingResult object to the service layer and raise further errors against it.</p>

<p>Service:</p>

<pre><code>public void pay(Book book, BindingResult errors) {
    // User has insufficient funds, so...
    errors.reject(""insufficient.funds);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can see problems with both of these ways. Option 1 feels awkward because not only do I have to catch the exception, I then have to add the error to the binding result so it feels like I'm doing the same thing twice. And Option 2 seems to bind the service layer too tightly to the controller.</p>

<p><strong>Finally</strong>, I realise there is the <code>SimpleMappingExceptionResolver</code> that could be used in conjunction with Option 1, but I'm not sure how appropriate it is (perhaps I have not seen a proper example?). In the above example, lets just say for argument's sake that I'd like the user returned to the original form with a red error above the form, not redirected to an entirely different page. The SimpleMappingExceptionResolver seems to me to be useful when you want to redirect a user to a standard error page when a certain exception is raised (which is not quite what I want to know how to do).</p>

Now, Apache is being hosted on a separate server. As far as I can tell, not much has changed, but my configuration no longer works. On certain URLs the client certificate is null, however this was not previously the case.</p>

<p>From Apache I am using mod_ajp_proxy to forward api calls to my Tomcat server:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Location /api&gt;
    SSLVerifyClient require
    ProxyPass ajp://192.168.x.x:8009/myapp
    ProxyPassReverse ajp://192.x.x.131:8009/cdpe
    ProxyPassReverseCookiePath /myapp /api
    ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain 192.168.x.x www.myapp.com
&lt;/Location&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The app uses client certificate authentication. There is a custom filter built as part of the Spring Security filter chain that pulls out the X509Certificate from the request and logs in the user. If the user does not have an account, it creates an account based on their certificate information. All this works well and we use expressions to secure the API. The Spring configuration is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;http entry-point-ref=""http403"" use-expressions=""true""&gt;
    &lt;intercept-url pattern=""/register/*"" access=""isAuthenticated()"" /&gt;
    &lt;intercept-url pattern=""/**"" access=""hasRole('ROLE_user')"" /&gt;
    &lt;custom-filter position=""PRE_AUTH_FILTER"" ref=""x509Filter"" /&gt;
&lt;/http&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We use the /register API for new users and we use the isAuthenticated() expression because new users have no roles initially, but we can authenticate them based on the certificate. However, when this is invoked the x509Certificate in the HttpRequest object shows as null. All other calls that use the hasRole('ROLE_user') expression see the certificate just fine. If the expression is changed to hasRole('ROLE_user'), the certificate is seen as well. I cannot determine if the issue is Apache or Spring Security related, but this does behave as desired on a single server configuration, which as I can tell, has no other configuration differences.  </p>

<p>How do I start and what do I need to learn?</p>

<p>Should I set up a Tomcat + a RESTful hosting software in front at server side?</p>

<p>Please give me some guidance and hints.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<hr>

<p>I think Google Reader API / Facebook API / Twitter API is a kind of good example for the RESTful service I am going to implement. How did Google and other company achieve that?</p>

<p>While going through Developer Guide and various tutorials about updating an Item in Table, what I understand is that whenever we update an Item, It first check whether that Item is present in the Table or not. If present it will update that Item, otherwise it will create a new Item and insert it.</p>

<p>Now, My doubt is how does it check about the availability of Item in Table.</p>

<p>Is it on the basis of primary key only ?</p>

<p>Well, I tried to code it, and what I found was interesting that If I will change any of the <code>key attibute (GSI,LSI)</code>. It just creates a new Item.</p>

<p>So what should I do to update <code>GSI/LSI</code> of any Item ?</p>

<p>Let me elaborate it using an example, Say I have a Table named <code>TEST</code>. The schema of table is :</p>

<pre><code>ID(PK/HK) - ""101""
Date(RK) -""200415""
Name(GSI) -""foo""
Add(LSI) -""foo1""
orderNo(normal attribute ) -""foo2""
</code></pre>

<p>So when I tried to update orderNo as <code>""foo3""</code> it is working fine. It just updates the table as:</p>

<pre><code>ID(PK/HK) - ""101""
Date(RK) -""200415""
Name(GSI) -""foo""
Add(LSI) -""foo1""
orderNo(normal attribute ) -""foo3""
</code></pre>

<p>But If I try to change some key attribute say add as <code>""some add ""</code>. It creates a new Item and my Table now consists of two items:</p>

<pre><code>ID(PK/HK) - ""101""
Date(RK) -""200415""
Name(GSI) -""foo""
Add(LSI) -""foo1""
orderNo(normal attribute ) -""foo3""


ID(PK/HK) - ""101""
Date(RK) -""200415""
Name(GSI) -""foo""
Add(LSI) -""some add""
orderNo(normal attribute ) -""foo3""
</code></pre>

<p>A solution to solve this issue may be Deleting that Item and then insertin a new Item.</p>

<p>Isn't there any other way to solve this ?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Some abbreviations used :</p>

<p>PK - Primary Key</p>

<p>HK - Hash Key</p>

<p>RK - Range Key</p>

<p>GSI - Global Secondary Key</p>

<p>LSI - Local Secondary Key</p>

<p>I am using java as my programming language.</p>

<p>The Picture Box on the form, shows a calendar and the class inheriting from Picture Box, is for the occurring Events.</p>

<p>When the user clicks on the Calendar, the Event shows up where he clicked.</p>

<pre><code>    private void pbCanvas_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var clickLocation = panelCanvasHolder.PointToClient(Cursor.Position);

        EventPart part = new EventPart(clickLocation, panelCanvasHolder.Size);
        panelCanvasHolder.Controls.Add(part);
        part.BringToFront();
        part.Focus();
    }        
</code></pre>

<p>When the user now clicks somewhere else on the calendar, i want the old Event to disappear and a new one to appear.</p>

<pre><code>    class EventPart : PictureBox
{

    public EventPart(Point originPoint, Size parentSize)
    {

    ...

    this.GotFocus += EventPart_GotFocus;
    }

    void EventPart_GotFocus(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        this.LostFocus += EventPart_LostFocus;
    }

    void EventPart_LostFocus(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        this.Dispose();
    } 
</code></pre>

<p>What happens is, the first time i click the Calendar, the Event appears.
The second time i click, the first event disappears and a new one appears.
On the third click, the 2nd Event <strong>stays</strong> and a third one appears.
Fourth click, 3rd event disappears and a fourth comes forth.
Fifth click, 4th Event stays and fifth appears.</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Basically, the Events only disappears every second time.</p>

<p>I didn't find anything specific to my question after some research, but to be honest, i wasn't exactly sure <strong>what</strong> to ask.</p>

<p>One thing i did find though, is that apparently it is not very good to use the <code>GotFocus</code> and <code>LostFocus</code> Events, which kind of splits my question here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would really like to know, why this is happening, to possibly prevent it in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>What would be a ""better"" solution?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I fixed the issue by using <code>OnLeave</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    protected override void OnLeave(EventArgs e)
    {
        base.OnLeave(e);

        this.Dispose();
    }

<p>Excerpt of Route believe where the problem lies:</p>

<pre><code>// #/listings/:listing_id/videos

    model: function(params) {
        return this.modelFor('listing');
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>If I select a ""videos"" link, the url is '/listings/1/videos' (for example) and my content loads just fine.  If I were to visit this url directly though through the address bar, no videos are retrieved.  I've been playing around with calls to serialize() but can't get it working and I'm not sure I'm even on the right path.  I've also noticed that once I visit the url directly and get no videos, if I then go directly to the '/listings' url (which loads content just fine) and select any of the ""videos"" links, the video content is no longer loaded for any of entries.  However, if I refresh my browser/app while on the '/listings' url then content exists under the ""videos"" links.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></p>

<p>If I change the original code segment above to instead be</p>

<pre><code>// #/listings/:listing_id/videos
App.VideosRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
    model: function(params) {
    return App.Listings.find(params.listing_id);

<p>it works as expected, although I do not understand why.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>It did break the ""View Video"" link however when accessing the '/listings/1/videos' url directly and not via a link.  It is now displaying as '/listings/null/videos/1' even though when you click on it the individual video loads just fine.  Using the back button takes you back to '/listings/1/videos' where all of the ""View Video"" links no longer have a 'null' in them.</p>

<p>Attempting to go to a '/listings/1/videos/2' url directly, for example, throws the error of ""Error: assertion failed: You used the dynamic segment video_id in your router, but App.Video did not exist and you did not override your state's <code>model</code> hook."" which I am now working to hunt down as well.  Selecting the ""View Video"" link though will load the data just fine.</p>
