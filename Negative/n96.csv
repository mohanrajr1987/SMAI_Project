<p>I'm getting the output <code>randomdeck.Card@10ed7f5c</code> but with different addresses for every card. </p>

<p>I did a size check and there are 52 objects in the stack, meaning I filled it and it actually exists. </p>

<p>If there was a way to directly pass the String array into the Card so what it's pushed into the Deck I could pop it off and instantly see the contents that would be great. But I fear that's not possible and I'm failing to grasp something fundamental about Stacks/Queues. </p>

<p>i can not: <strong>call more that 1 saved task</strong></p>

<p>If i understood right, to restore a task i need cpu register 4 to 15, the variables what are pushed onto the stack (who does this? nothing mentioned in the datasheet), and the SR/PC what are pushed onto the stack by the ISR aswell. Additionally, i allocate every task

Example: when a button in pageA is clicked, I want Javascript on page B to react on this.</p>

<p>I've tried to accomplish this using the jQuery $().load() function, but this doesn't allow me to call the javascript of page B from page A.</p>

my page B contains this: </p>

    jQuery('#mycarousel').jcarousel({
        initCallback : carousel_callback

<p>This works for static content (so when I have static tabs in the carousel). Now I want that this also works for the tabs which are added dynamically. </p>

<p>As one of the reactions suggested, I tried putting the javascript into a separate file and link both the main page as the page which gets loaded to this script. However this doesn't make them share the context.</p>

<p>It works this way but I have to wait 1 sec. When I reduce the interval to 100 the pointer is visible on the image.<br>
I can only assume that the hide method is slower than the CopyFromScreen method...
Is there any way to make it work without the 1 sec delay??</p>

Does anyone know how to get the raw html unmodified from the webbrowser control??? I know IE modifies HTML so I want to know how to get the raw html returned from the web server. It's annoying because I write the scraper on my windows 7 dev box and then it won't work when I host it on a Windows XP box. If you answer don't tell me to use WebClient and download the page, I want to easily support browsing pages and not have to worry about other little webpage stuff that is taken care of by a webbrowser control.

<pre><code>http://myserver/api.php?action=projects

<p>In my api.php file I have a simple if statement to detect the action, and then react accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_GET[""action""])
{
    switch($_GET[""action""])
    {
        case ""projects""
          dostuff();

<p>However, I of course wanted to clean this up, so I could go to this url:</p>

<pre><code>http://myserver/api.php/projects

<p>and get the same outcome.  I was able to accomplish this by reading up on a previous SO post:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8291712/using-clean-urls-in-restful-api"">Using Clean URLs in RESTful API</a></p>

<p>And ultimately got it working by making an .htaccess file in my root directory and using the rewrite engine like so:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^action/([^/\.]+)/?$ api.php?action=$1 [L]
</code></pre>

<p>This worked great!  Except for one problem, because I am using the clean URL, it no longer seems to recognize the GET parameter exists.</p>

<p>I've found I can use
    $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];</p>

<p>And then parse the URL to get my parameters.  I don't see how this could work out though once I start introducing multiple parameters.  Is there something I'm missing here, or do I need to look at it a different way and change how I format the parameters instead?</p>

<p>Now I would like to merge the *.mov file with a music from the ipod/iphone music library (most likely *.mp3). So my initial idea is to use AVAssetReader to get samples from the *.mp3 and *.mov file and pass the samples to an AVAssetWriter. Will this work? Just by reading the documentation i think that its possible.</p>

<p>I played with the idea for a bit but i cant make it to work.</p>

<p>My first attempt is to use 2 AVAssetReaders, one for each file. I used AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput as an output for the 1st reader and then an AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput for the 2nd one. The problem is using the AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput requires that you pass it an AVVideoComposition. I had problems creating AVVideoComposition/AVMutableVideoComposition so I gave up on this solution. I dont get why I need to pass an AVVideoComposition, I just want to get samples of the movie.</p>

<p>So my 2nd attempt is similar but instead of using AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput as an output for the 2nd reader, I used 2 AVAssetReaderTrackOutput instead. So now I have 2 readers with total of 3 outputs, and I tried using the sample from the outputs and pass it to an AVAssetWriter to create a *.mov file. I was able to run it, without errors/crashes. But I cant play the resulting *.mov file. Its play duration is 0.So again, no luck with the AVAssetReader+AVAssetWriter idea.</p>

<p>So my question/s: Can you use AVAssetReader and AVAssetWriter to merge two files? Has anybody tried doing this and make it to work? Should I just use AVMutableVideoComposition instead?</p>

<p>I will post my code if necessary.</p>

<p>Does someone know or can come up with a way to use pure Numpy arrays and functions to draw as well as fill colored polygons on top of a numpy array grid? </p>

<p>This I think would take two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ability to fill the grid array with color values so that the
polygon filling could be written in one color, and the outline in
another one. What would be ideal and fastest for such a system, eg
tuples of rgb values, color name strings, etc?</li>
<li>The ability to draw and fill the inside of a polygon based on an
array of its pixel coordinates. Drawing the outline of it I think
should be pretty easy by just using the coordinates as indexes to
the grid array and setting them to the outline color values. More
difficult would be to fill the polygon. One way would be to iterate
through all pixel cell coordinates (or better yet only for the
neighboring cells of each polygon coordinate point) and test if its
coordinates are within the polygon pixel coordinates. I know there
are some simple inside-outside/biggerthan-smallerthan algorithms to
test for point in poly using regular Python, but for my purpose this
would be too slow and I am wondering if someone has the numpy skills
to set up such an advanced linked code using only the speed of the
numpy builtin functions to return True if a numpy pixel coordinate
is inside a polygon.</li>
<li>Lastly, if someone would know how to draw a line between two
pixel/grid/array coordinates by filling in all the cells in between
two pixels with a True or color value?</li>
</ol>

<p>I know this is a tall order, but I was just curious to see if anyone would know. If so, then this could make for a pretty powerful and fast Numpy-based drawing library. In the end I would like to save the grid array as an image which is easy by passing it to PIL. </p>

<p>I am aware that PIL and Aggdraw can do the polygon drawings and that this has been suggested in many similar posts, but they are not very effective when receiving a numpy array of xy polygon/line coordinates. The assumption here is that my polygon coordinates are already in a numpy array format and I want to avoid the overhead of having to copy them into lists for every drawing (when we're talking about thousands of polygons frequently). So the difference in this post is about <em>how to fill a polygon using pure Numpy.</em></p>

<p>Context:  I have a website (we'll call it www.mysite.com) and I have gotten a valid certificate from a major CA.  HTTPS is working fine and the certificate is all kinds of valid.</p>

<p>Objective:  I, now, want to issue certificates to the people I am authorizing to use my site so that I can add an extra layer of security to it and let Apache reject unauthorized users before they even see the result of the PHP site or have logged in with those credentials.</p>

<p>What I have done:  I have followed at least three different tutorials and read a half a dozen more on how to issue these certificates but, in short, they fail to validate.  Most of the tutorials have talked about establishing my own self-signed CA cert, and then using that cert's key to sign additional certificates requested by the users.  I have tried this and both Firefox (version 19.02) and IE (version 8 :( ) fail to connect and I don't understand why anymore.</p>

<p>So specific questions:</p>

<p><strong>1. Are the Apache commands wrong?</strong>
when I include:</p>

<pre><code>    SSLEngine on    
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/path/to/www.mysite.com.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/path/to/www.mysite.com.key
    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/path/to/www.mysite.com.cabundle
    SSLVerifyClient require
    SSLVerifyDepth 10
</code></pre>

<p>in my httpd.conf file, the server, appropriately rejects visits that do not have a certificate.  However, I have generated what I believe to be a valid certificate for the end user and it is still being rejected.  If the files shown above are what were given to me by the major CA (VeriSign), then am I just creating a bad user certificate?  What are those apache commands actually checking for?</p>

<p><strong>2. How do the flags for openssl really work?</strong>
I am creating the user's certificate with:</p>

<pre><code>openssl ca -in ./path/to/usersrequest.csr -cert ./etc/path/to/www.mysite.com.crt -keyfile ./etc/path/to/www.mysite.com.key -out ./path/to/userscert.crt
</code></pre>

<p>Am I, perhaps, using the wrong key or something?  Should I be using the public or private key that I got from VeriSign's certificate?
If I understand what I have read correctly, I should be able to simply issue a new certificate to my end user, signed with the same key that is in my 'official' certificate and it should just work... but it's not :(</p>

<p>I have also tried:</p>

<pre><code>openssl x509 -req -CA /etc/path/to/cert.pem -CAkey /etc/path/to/cert.pem -CAcreateserial -in usersrequest.csr -out user.crt
</code></pre>

<p>and I get an error that reads <code>unable to load CA private key</code>... and I don't even know what that means.</p>

<p>In the end, I know these are probably n00b questions and the answer is staring me in the face, but I have been trying to learn about this subject and write the code for two days now and my brain is just fried... I will keep trying, but if anyone out there can point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.</p>

<p>TIA,
Kvorak</p>

<li><p>I read that <a href=""http://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/77637"">a view can't be coupled with the controller</a>, in other words it can't have a controller object inside, but then how does it use the proper controller if a view is supposed to trigger something in it?</p></li>
<li><p>How can the model update the view if its unique job is to represent data?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the business logic inside the controller or the model? I have read conflicting points of view</p></li>

<p>The reason for this is that a particular problem I'm working on deals with parsing data from purely arbitrary coordinate systems (I'm importing models), and it would be nice to be able to have these models conform to the standard set by the renderer I'm working with, which uses the z-axis as the up-axis.</p>

<p>Some of these models being imported don't have any view information associated with them, so in cases such as this I end up creating it, more or less, on the fly. That said, their <em>root</em> transformations are structured in such a way which appears to dictate the intended coordinate system - I'm just not sure exactly what to search for in this sense.</p>

<p>To elaborate, let's assume these two matrices represent their respective basis formats, and any transformations which are right-multiplied by these will as such be represented in relation to the basis set by either of these matrices:</p>

<p><strong>Z-Up Identity Matrix</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1 0 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 0 1]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Y-Up Identity Matrix</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1 0 0 0]
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 0 0 1]
</code></pre>

<p>However, there have been moments where the root transformation matrix for a model was of the form found in what I've stated to be the z-up identity matrix, and under the guise of the above assumption, the results of the model's orientation were unexpected. For example, one model would initially have a transform set similar to that of the z-up identity form, and as a result would be rendered with an improper orientation, where as setting its root transformation to the y-up identity form would cause it to be oriented properly...within a renderer which uses a z-up axis as its default coordinate system.</p>

<p>As such, it appears that this assumption is actually incorrect, and has little to do with dictating the up-axis for a particular coordinate system.</p>

<p>I appreciate any insight on this.</p>

Ive got some questions regarding the transaction management in general. I personally use declarative transaction management from spring. It would be great if you could answer my questions with yes/no (or correct/incorrect) and maybe, if necessary, give short explanations. It would be nice if several people would answer in case that there are different opinions. Thank you :-)</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Would you say this sentences is correct: A DBMS is responsible for the generally implementation of transactions and their behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>1) B)</strong> Maybe it would be better to say: A DBMS is responsible for the generally implementation of transactions and the behaviour of the Database (for example when a transaction is rolled back).</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Hibernate just uses the Database Connection. It needs Transactions, but it doesnt configurate any(!) settings regarding the transactions and their behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> But: to work with Transactions, Hibernate needs to KNOW, where Transactions start, are commited and need to be rolled back.</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> Does Hibernate also need to know what in case of roll back happens? I think no, because this should be defined in the DBMS. (that means: which tables shall be locked, which database operations shall be made undone, and so on, correct?)</p>

<p><strong>5)</strong> For <strong>3)</strong>, programmatic or declarative transaction management can be used. </p>

<p><strong>6)</strong> When using programmativ transaction management, everything which Hibernate needs to know (<strong>3)</strong>) can be written in the source code manually by the developer.</p>

<p><strong>7)</strong> For declarative transaction managament an additional framework to hibernate is necessary, FOR EXAMPLE Spring.</p>

<p><strong>8)</strong> Spring manages transactions. Its like a frame for them. It triggers the actions, like starting and rolling back a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>9)</strong> Spring can also define for which exceptions rollback must or must not happen</p>

<p><strong>10)</strong> Does Spring any additional things when roll back happens? I think the database is responsible for roll back, spring just triggers it, right? Its just to make sure....</p>

<p>[EDIT]
This is an answer to duffymo, it was too long for a comment and I am not allowed to answer my own question within 8 hours, thats why for now Ive got to put it here. Sorry.</p>

<p>@duffymo</p>

<p>Interesting answers, here are my thoughts about it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So we agree, that the behaviour of the database (of course!) in case when transactions are rolled back or commited is implemented or defined directly by the DBMS, correct? 
I know the Transaction Manager, (PlatformTransactionManager), but I really think that it just initiates transactions, roll back, and commit. That means, it is not reponsible to HOW transactions are handled by the database, correct?
I guess my verbalization was mistakable, I updated it (1B)</p></li>
<li><p>Thats a little bit abstract to me. Does it mean my sentences was correct or wasnt it :-)</p></li>
<li><p>How can it mark this by itself? I think this must be done by the developer? I think of ""start tx, commit..."" which can be done in the source code by a developer</p></li>
<li><p>I agree. Thats one thing I find a little bit difficult to understand in all those documentations. They tell about which transactions are catched and which arent, but in case to find out how to handle them, you have to find out by yourself. I was confused in the beginning, because I was not sure if I could even surround the call of a transactional-annotated method with a try/catch-block in order to catch an exception and to inform a user. Its simply not enough to have a transaction rolled back, I need the user to be informed. Thats why I almost everywhere use try/catch - how do you handle this?</p></li>
<li><p>This is one point I dont understand. Spring offers programmatic and declarative transaction management. If Spring itselfs manages the transactions, of course declarative transman is used. Programmatic is... in my eyes.. simply programmatic. Im not sure if you can say ""Hibernate==programmatic"", because you can use Hibernate with both, programmatic and declarative transaction management. Maybe its possible to say that hibernate does not offer ITSELF declarative transaction management.</p></li>
<li><p>I didnt even know it was possible to do this ""in JDBC"" - I must admit I dont know how this works in detail then. Somehow funny, that while reading you thought Im against the use of declarative transactions (if I did not misunderstand you), I really appreciate declarative transaction management. :-) I think its very easy to use and when reading through the code it is very understandable.</p></li>
<li><p>If I want to use Hibernate with declarative transaction management, I need an additional framework like Spring. Because declarative means, that an additional framework ""does all the work you would have to do programmatically"". (like starting tx, commit, roll back). And I also guess Spring might not be the only framework which offers declarative transaction management for hibernate. But the main point in my question was, that it is not possible to use declarative transaction management for hibernate without using an additional framework. I hope I verbalized it correctly now :-)</p></li>
<li><p>ok, correct. so the transaction manager triggers roll back, starting tx, and so on</p></li>
<li><p>ok..</p></li>
<li>sorry :-)</li>
</ol>

<p>I just like to understand how things work. I read through the documentations again and again, but if you are learning everything by yourself, its important to understand the essential facts. Thats why Im asking :-) Thank you for your help! :-)</p>

<pre><code>git remote add -f coda-oss_remote https://github.com/mdaus/coda-oss.git
git subtree add --prefix externals/coda-oss coda-oss_remote master --squash
</code></pre>

<p>This worked fine.  Then I wanted to get rid of some of the unneeded directories (necessary for a variety of reasons).  This was actually simpler than I expected; I just removed them similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>git rm -r externals/coda-oss/modules/drivers/pcre

<p>In subsequent pulls...</p>

<pre><code>git subtree pull --prefix externals/coda-oss coda-oss_remote master --squash

<p>git was smart and just pulled in updates to that other repo and didn't try to recreate the removed directories.  Everything worked exactly like I wanted it to.</p>

<p>The other day was the first time that I've tried to pull when there's been a modification to one of the files in a directory that I've removed in this second repo.  I got a merge conflict because git saw that the file had been modified in the original repo but wasn't present in my repo.  This was simple enough to resolve - I just had to do another 'git rm' of the file - but I'd like this process to be something I can script up and automatically merge everything in.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to accomplish what I'm trying to do or at least an automatic way to do it so I can script it (I could parse the merge conflicts and run the 'git rm' off of that I suppose).</p>

where the text contained within the HTML tags is in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,
French, etc... (these languages AFAIK don't make use of capitalizing the first
letter of every word as this is specific to English and not to these locales).
I was thinking of the case where you have a multi-lingual site where you can
select the language for the content to be extracted from the database and
displayed on the pages from a drop-down menu in the upper-right hand corner.
In this scenario, since the CSS should likely be the same and indpendent of
the language, what should the effect be when the opening tag is, say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt; html lang=""fr"" >, &lt; html lang=""pt"" >, &lt; html lang=""es"" >, &lt; html lang=""it"" >, etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>instead of </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt; html lang=""en"" ></p>
</blockquote>

<p>?</p>

<p>IMHO this should turn off the behavior of ""text-transform: capitalize"",
please correct me if I'm wrong, or if this should be achieved in some
other way, perhaps only by overriding the base CSS file with another
CSS file for each supported language.</p>

<pre><code>const std::vector&lt; std::string &gt; Database::getRecordNames() {
    // Get the number of recors
    int size = this -&gt; getRecordCount();

    // Create container
    std::vector&lt; std::string &gt; names;

    // Get some strings

        // Add to container

    }

    // Return the names
    return names;

<p>And then somewhere else, I use this method</p>

<pre><code>void Game::doSomething() {
    const std::vector&lt; std::string &gt; &amp; names = mDatabase -&gt; getRecordNames();

    // Do something about names
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, on the method <code>Database::getRecordNames()</code>, it returns a temporary object <code>std::vector&lt; std::string &gt;</code>. However, on the method <code>Game::doSomething()</code>, I placed the return value to a  <code>const std::vector&lt; std::string &gt; &amp;</code>-type object.</p>

<p>Is this unsafe, or is it perfectly normal to use them like this? AFAIK, temporary variables are destroyed on the end of their scope. But in our case, we reference this temporary variable, in which I believe will be destroyed after it returns the value.</p>

<p>Is it better to rewrite the other method so that it would use a copy of the returned value instead of a reference?</p>

    const std::vector&lt; std::string &gt; names = mDatabase -&gt; getRecordNames();

<p><code>python2 foo.py</code></p>

<p>Occasionally, when this is not sufficient and I need to inspect the problem more thoroughly, I just launch the program in ipython:
<code>ipython -pylab foo.py</code>, and then inspect the variables, test some commands and so on. I like <code>ipython</code>, because of the tab completion and the availability of <em>bash</em> commands.</p>

<p>This worked well enough for me, but now my programs grew bigger and include many subroutines (in multiple files). The <code>ipython</code> approach doesn't work any more, because it always runs the <strong>complete code</strong> till the end of <code>foo.py</code> (when it drops into the pylab shell). What I'd like to do instead is, stop execution at a given line in a subroutine (could be in another file) and inspect variables there. <strong>I.e. set a break point at which the pylab shell kicks in.</strong></p>

<p>Is there an <em>easy way</em> to adapt my <code>ipython</code> way of working? E.g. stop at a line in <code>bar.py</code></p>

<p>I use rectangles to represent every tile, so I made the <code>BoardTile</code> class (which inherits from <code>QGraphicsRectItem</code>) so that I can define a <code>mousePressEvent</code>.</p>

<p>Here's a little test code that I associated with the mouse click:</p>

<pre><code>void BoardTile::mousePressEvent(QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent *event) {
    QMessageBox mesg;
    std::stringstream mesgText;
    mesgText &lt;&lt; ""Clicked tile ("" &lt;&lt; this-&gt;row_id &lt;&lt; "", "" &lt;&lt; this-&gt;col_id &lt;&lt; "")."";
    mesg.setText(QString::fromStdString(mesgText.str()));
    mesg.exec();
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I click the first tile on the second row, I get the following message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clicked tile (1, 0)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, when I click any other tile, I get the exact same message. The contents of the message depends on whichever tile I clicked first. Why is this? Did I bind the <code>mousePressEvent</code> incorrectly?</p>

<p><strong>Full code</strong>
<a href=""http://www.box.net/shared/4m6nrvuxa4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.box.net/shared/4m6nrvuxa4</a> <em>(update 1)</em></p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I noticed that if I put <code>event-&gt;ignore();</code> after <code>mesg.exec()</code>, it works fine. I know it's not a solution (because it will probably lead to all kinds of weird behavior), but I do wanna know why that does work. Does this reveal anything crucial about any possible mistakes I've made in my implementation?</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: Someone told me I should try changing <code>mousePressEvent</code> to <code>mouseReleaseEvent</code>. Oddly enough, that works. As far as I know, the only difference between the two events is that the first is triggered when you press the mouse button and the latter when you release that button. So why does <code>mouseReleaseEvent</code> trigger the desired behavior and <code>mousePressEvent</code> doesn't?</p>

<p>The models are all in <em>models.py</em>, and I have added several properties and methods to the default ORM properties and methods of most model classes.
For example; my ""contract"" model has an extra property contract.first_possible_termination that returns a date.</p>

<p>The problem is that this property accesses a <em>utilities</em> module that has a function to calculate a range of dates. And that function needs to use different configuration options that are stored in the database, in a ""configuration"" table.  </p>

<p>So the utilities module needs to use the ORM models again, to access the Configuration table and thus we have a circular import:</p>

<pre><code>ImportError: cannot import name Configuration
</code></pre>

<p>I'm wondering what the standard way is to avoid a circular import here. I imagine more people run into this as one adds methods and properties to ones models.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT, PLEASE NOTE:</strong><br>
I think plantians answer is the best way to go in general, because it promotes SoC, but in my specific case I'm working with a legacy database that has values that influence business rules spread across the different tables in the database.<br>
A lot of the functionality I'm adding to my models will depend in some way or another on these values/business rules, so I will not be able to avoid accessing the database in these functions without refactoring considerably and passing a lot of extra external values to my helper functions.  </p>

<p>I can only accept one answer, but both are valid, so an upvote for both, but Blubber's answer is my personal solution for now.<br>

<pre><code>  MOCK_METHOD5(getDictItem,
  bool(WORD wIndex, BYTE bSubIndex, void * pObjData, DWORD dwLength, CSdo&amp; sdo));
</code></pre>

<p>in code it is called as </p>

<pre><code>if( !can.getDictItem(wIndex, bSubIndex, pObjData, dwLength, tSdo) )
</code></pre>

<p>I want to pass a string to this <code>pObjData</code> (3rd argument in the list).</p>

<p>In my google tests, I'm doing like this.</p>

<pre><code>char szDeviceName[30]= {0};
snprintf(szDeviceName, sizeof(szDeviceName), ""%s"", ""Device Name"" );

EXPECT_CALL( mockCan, getDictItem(_,_,_,_,_) )

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>error: 'void</em>' is not a pointer-to-object type*</strong></p>

<p>Hence I'm trying with <code>ACTION_P</code></p>

<p>Now with this implementation, I only get the first letter of the <code>szDeviceName</code> variable (into this <code>pObjData</code>) i.e., ""D"" followed by 29 0's in the real code flow after this mock object is called. </p>

As only small portions of the page need to be loaded for such an expansion, it's done via JavaScript, and not by directing to a new URL/ HTML page. However, as a bonus the user is able to permalink to such expanded sections, i.e. send someone else a URL like</p>

<p><em><a href=""http://example.com/#foobar"">http://example.com/#foobar</a></em></p>

<p>and have the ""foobar"" category be opened immediately for that other user. This works using parent.location.hash = 'foobar', so that part is fine.</p>

However, doing so using <code>parent.location.hash = ''</code> causes a reload of the whole page (in Firefox 3, for instance), which I'd like to avoid. Using <code>window.location.href = '/#'</code> won't trigger a page reload, but leaves the somewhat unpretty-looking ""#"" sign in the URL.

<p>Under Quota Details in the GAE dashboard all of the resources are under quota, with ""Okay"" in the rate column. I have billing enabled on the app as well, even if it were over quota I shouldn't be receiving this error. What is the problem here? I'm not even calling a <code>Put()</code> method in this service call. I'm only querying data.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As the next reset of my quotas is drawing close with 0 hours remaining (probably midnight pacific time in 20 minutes), still no actual exceeding of any quota either, I do get this new error:</p>

<p>

<p>This error now comes up when I do anything in the app, the HTML code popping up in a dialog box.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> My quota just reset and my app is functioning normally again. But this doesn't answer my question as to why this occurred in the first place. Luckily I am still developing the app and I was the only one inconvenienced by this server glitch. What am I to do in these situations to get my server back online? Is this a common occurrence? Is there some way to receive an email notification if the server is throwing errors and my app is not functioning? Obviously waiting 24 hours for the server to reset is not a valid solution.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify an object used as the scope object for the script being executed.

<p>This answer recommends to use <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Components.utils.Sandbox"" rel=""nofollow"">Components.utils.Sandbox</a> as an alternative.</p>

<p>However, this mechanism apparently enables security restrictions. For <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=876089"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla bug 876089</a>, I tried out simply replacing the regular JS object with a sandbox.

<p>Now the question: In the Mozilla environment, how can I best load scripts in a way that just prevents leaking of symbols via the caller's global object, but still allows it to use all the symbols explicitly placed in the scope object without imposing any security restrictions?</p>

<pre><code>jQuery('.footer-pre-home.box.s5,.footer-two.box.s5').appendTo('.footer .copyright');

<p>This works fine. However, when they are removed, they are leaving a single whitespace character in their previous parent node ""pre-footer"". This is preventing me from using the css :empty psuedo class on the pre-footer element.</p>

<p>After the appendTo, the computed pre-footer html looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""pre-footer""&gt;

There are such tools like OpenCV, but it have a lot of filters and is too slow if you want to detect <strong>each blob in binary image</strong>, there is also CvBlobsLib but the support is outdated(last version is before 5 years) and I coudnt set it up for <strong>Visual Studio 2013</strong> (it must be compiled with Cmake, and it is giving errors). In wikipedia there are two types of algorithms - ""one component of a time"" and ""two-pass"" <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling"" rel=""nofollow"">conected-component</a> , but they both use labels, wich mean you will have another 2D array of integers, but this will take a lot of memory because of the size of int(4 bytes), and we need int because of the image size and possibility of more than 65535 labels(wich is short). If it is eaven short it will take twise less memory, wich is again a lot of it. I found a ""quickblob"" written in C <a href=""http://kmkeen.com/quickblob/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">quicblobsalgol</a> but I coudnt run it from the source(but exe is working properly), tried to amalyse the code, and I got something, but the whole idea behind it staied vague for me, so I tried also something like <strong>floodFill algorithm and something like ""disjoined-set data structure""</strong> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> which to hold the blobs, and this means the used memory teoretically is defined of the number of blobs(single black pixels are not recognise as blobs).

<p><strong>The main question is why before end of the main function so much RAM is still in use(147 MB).</strong> The tail recursion ""recurciveMarkBlob()"" is using parameters by value i,j, group, and dynamic allocation of memory and that is why the memory temporary jumps to 600 MB(mostly from the parameters),  after freeing the dynamicly allocated memory it still takes 148 MB, the image is 4 000 x 4 000 x 2 bytes = 16 000 000 bytes = 16 MB. I have read about ""function taken memory"" <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13485967/how-much-memory-does-a-function-use"">here</a> but I still cant understand why.

This data is fairly complex and lengthy, so we have been using the Import from XML feature in Excel.  Because of the issues with running Excel on a server, we are now looking into moving to a 3rd-party solution for our workbook creation, such as SpreadsheetGear or Aspose.  </p>

<p>SpreadsheetGear and Aspose do not support XML Import. Does anyone know of another 3rd-party, server-friendly tool that does?</p>

<p>--Edit--
The data is coming from an DB2 database that we are putting into C# classes and then serializing into XML.  We are then importing the XML into around 30 tables and other cells.  Then we copy and paste the tables to an output sheet and reuse the originals to import more. </p>

<p>--Edit--
The output is a form with multiple tables and fields on one sheet. Part of what the XML map helps with is keeping track of the locations of the cells, without having to massively hard-code cell-coordinates into the code.</p>

My project is setup with AngularJS with Spring which is working fine end to end.

If I want mock the <code>DBContext</code> derived <code>MyModelContainer</code> which contain <code>DBSets</code> of entity classes. Read some where that in order to unit test, you need to change it to <code>IDBSet</code>. Whether its possible to do it especially in a class that gets auto generated when I do ""Run Custom Tool"" is one concern. But as of now I modified it.</p>

<p>But the real problem is: when I try to Stub <code>MyModelContainer</code> to return a mock generated from <code>IDBSet</code>. Rhino mock is firing an InvalidOperationException: ""Invalid call, the last call has been used, or no call has been made(make sure that you are calling a virtual(C#)/Overridable(VB) method.""</p>

<p>Here is my unit test code.</p>

<pre><code>MyModelContainer dbMock = MockRepository.GenerateMock&lt;MyModelContainer&gt;();
IDBSet&lt;Models.MyEntity&gt; entityMock = MockRepository.GenerateMock&lt;IDBSet&lt;Models.MyEntity&gt;&gt;()
dbMock.Stub( x=&gt;x.MyEntities ).Return( entityMock );
</code></pre>

<p>The last statement is triggering the exception. I tried using the fake implementation of <code>IDBSet&lt;&gt;</code> specified <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3463017/unit-testing-with-ef4-code-first-and-repository"">here</a>, But no luck!</p>

<p>I use MVC 4, Rhino Mocks 3.6. Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>After some trials and research, I found a fix. I changed the code to:</p>

<pre><code>MyModelContainer dbMock = MockRepository.GenerateMock&lt;MyModelContainer&gt;();
IDBSet&lt;Models.MyEntity&gt; entityMock = MockRepository.GenerateMock&lt;IDBSet&lt;Models.MyEntity&gt;&gt;()
//dbMock.Stub( x=&gt;x.MyEntities ).Return( entityMock );
dbMock.MyEntities = entityMock;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the <code>InvalidOperationException</code> is gone.
The test fails only due to <code>ExpectationViolationException</code> which should be normal.</p>

<p>As for auto generated Model class, it is found out that editing the <code>DbContext's</code> <strong>T4 template (.tt extension)</strong> will do the trick.

<p>In the documentation of Lumen, they only thing that is being mentioned is:
The QUEUE_DRIVER option in your .env file determines the queue ""driver"" that will be used by your application.</p>

<p>I have set this to SQS as suggested, however I'm a bit puzzled about the actual amazon credentials. How am I supposed to define those? The only ""relevant"" thing I've seen is from Amazon's documentation <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/guide/latest/credentials.html#credential-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/guide/latest/service-sqs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. I have also installed the ""aws/aws-sdk-php"": ""~3.0"" package.</p>

<p>However these resources refer to using SQS's API directly. I want to be able to invoke the queue as it is being described in Lumen, so something like <code>Queue::push()</code> or <code>$this-&gt;dispatch()</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant code that I have.</p>

<p>This is in my .env file</p>

<pre><code>QUEUE_DRIVER=sqs
AWS_KEY=key
AWS_SECRET=secretstuff
AWS_QUEUE=https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
</code></pre>

<p>This is my controller</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Jobs\GuestEmailJob;
use Laravel\Lumen\Routing\Controller as BaseController;
use Log, Queue;
use Aws\Sqs\SqsClient;

class NotificationEmailController extends BaseController
{
    public function pushToQueue($id)
    {
        Queue::push(new GuestEmailJob($id));
        //$this-&gt;dispatch(new GuestEmailJob($id));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally this is my job</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Bus\SelfHandling;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Log;

abstract class GuestEmailJob implements SelfHandling, ShouldQueue
{
    use InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public function handle($id)
    {
        Log::info('within handle');
        $user = User::find($id);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried it both with <code>Queue::push</code> and <code>$this-&gt;dispatch()</code>. When a request hits the controller, everything goes fine until pushing to the queue and then nothing happens (no exceptions either). Anybody has any idea what am I doing wrong/missing?</p>

     If I invert the order, the index page page is loaded by the resource handler, which means, If I activate directory listings, it gives me a list of all directories, otherwise it's just a blank page

     I tried working with a WebAppContext to load JSP pages but I still had some problems with which handler should handle which requests

*/

</code></pre>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>**EDIT : **</p>

<p>The problem I have is that my HTTP servlet behaves in the following way : 
Handles all requests leaving nothing for the resource handler, so when a script requests a .js script, it returns an empty html page instead.
Here is an example : </p>

<pre><code>    WebAppContext root = new WebAppContext();

    root.setParentLoaderPriority(true);
    root.setContextPath(""/"");
    root.setResourceBase(""."");
    root.setWelcomeFiles(new String[] {""test.jsp""});
    root.addServlet(new ServletHolder(new Main()),""/*"");

    HandlerList handlerList = new HandlerList();
    handlerList.setHandlers(new Handler[] { root });
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, when using the root handler without the Main servlet, It loads all static content and jsp pages, but when adding the main servlet, it no longer loads any static content, and responds to all request for static content with an empty html page.</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> to return dates to the datepicker, because they will be disabled dates. I expect a return of JSon array of strings that are dates that are then fed into the datepicker.</p>

<p><strong>Relevance to others:</strong>
Returning JSon data from a call to Controller/Action/ID seems like it would be a common thing to do. I see other questions regarding routing issues, as well as JSon, and jQuery seems to be a popular way to enhance web development.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong>
I have a jQuery-UI datepicker that calls a Controller/Action/ID and returns json data to the datepicker. It works perfectly when running within Visual Studio, but fails when built and deployed to the Dev environment.  The code passes the URL that is generated and passed to the jQuery is:
/Secure/Validation/getDisabledDates/999</p>

<p>We are using Umbraco, with a directory called /Secure within the Umbraco area to hold our MVC code. The URL that the code tries then generates on the Dev environment is:
/Secure/Validation/getDisabledDates/999
If I watch the call and the errors in Firebug, I see that an error for the following:
POST <a href=""http://dev.ourcompanyname.com/Secure/Validation/getDisabledDates/999"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.ourcompanyname.com/Secure/Validation/getDisabledDates/999</a>       302 Found (if I investigate further, I find it was really a 404, that got sent to the error page, and that's what was found.)</p>

<p>I'm using @Url.Action in the view to get the correct (hopefully) URL to the action, but when the javascript request is made in the Dev environment, the return is a 404. The code gets into the javascript code and displays the URL in an alert, which looks right to my eyes. The code does not seem to get as far as the MVC controller (I tried putting a messagebox there).</p>

<p>This seems to be because the controller isn't actually a distinct, real page within a directory, because the MVC code is compiled into a DLL. I've heard this and it makes sense, but other people in the world seem to be calling controllers, so I'm not sure what my problem is here.</p>

<p>Originally there was only one set of dates, so some code calls only say GetDates, but then it was broken up by Widget, so calls then reflect ByWidget, so an ID is passed. All of the calls trace correctly, and the code works in Dev.</p>

<p>SetDates that gets called on success in the javascript function is another javascript function, but I have put alerts in SetDates, in the Dev environment the code does not get that far, presumably because it will not find the code in the ValidationController.</p>

<p>Any helpful suggestions would be very greatly appreciated!</p>

All I want to do is log in and have the cookie for my user_id stored. 
It works on all of my other pages, except my index page which is one directory up.</p>

<p>So on my index page, I have this if statement: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

if (!isset($_COOKIE['user_id'])) {

    sign_in();
} else {
    echo ""You're already logged in!"";
}

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>No matter what I do, the sign_(); function always shows. </p>

<p>But here's the kicker: 
On my login script, the whole thing goes through as if I successfully logged in. 
I send it back to this page using: </p>

<pre><code>header(""Location: ../index.php"");
</code></pre>

<p>(It is up one directory)
However, when I make it link to a page in the same directory, it registers the cookie and everything is alright.</p>

<pre><code>header(""Location: show_user.php"");

And notice how the index page doesn't register the cookie. </p>

<p>How I tried to set the cookie:</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_POST['usernamelogin'])) {
        $user_login = $_REQUEST['usernamelogin'];
        $pass_login = $_REQUEST['passwordlogin'];
        $pass_login = trim(crypt($pass_login, $user_login));
        $login_query = sprintf(""SELECT username, user_id FROM user WHERE username = '%s' and password = '%s';"", mysql_real_escape_string($user_login), mysql_real_escape_string($pass_login));
        $loginresult = mysql_query($login_query, $dbConn);

        echo $login_query;
        if (mysql_num_rows($loginresult) == 1) {
        $userinfo = mysql_fetch_array($loginresult);
        $username = $userinfo['username'];
        $userid = $userinfo['user_id'];
        setcookie('username', $username);
        setcookie('user_id', $userid);
        header(""Location: show_user.php"");
        exit();
        } else {
            echo ""Couldn't find your account!"";
        }

<p>I'm not clear on the relationship between Test::Unit and MiniTest, especially since I see test/unit.rb referencing MiniTest::Unit</p>

<p>I can patch this issue in a couple ways, but I'm not sure which project is to blame (e.g. where I should submit the patch):</p>

<ol>
<li>In test/unit.rb in ruby, I can replace the call to <code>size</code> with a call to <code>count</code>, but this only seems appropriate if <code>Test::Unit</code> expects a <code>ParallelEach</code> being part of the test suite</li>
<li>In minitest, I can alias <code>count</code> to <code>size</code>, which makes sense if minitest is responsible for sending <code>ParallelEach</code> objects to <code>Test::Unit</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Are either of these appropriate, or is there something else going on here (like a naming conflict)?</p>

<p>When I get rid of the UIScrollView and simply place a UIImageView in the ViewController and constrain the UIImageView to the borders of the ViewController, I get the desired effect in terms of sizing. The usage of the UIScrollView somehow screws this all up. I can't find the proper minZoomScale that makes the UIImageView completely constrained within the borders of the ViewController. The image is always either too wide (I have to scroll from side to side to see either end) or it doesn't use the full height of the ViewController (the width is now fully in view but the height takes up much less than it could if it filled the ViewController).

<p>I think the best way to demonstrate the problem is by way of example. If I create two simple tables:</p>

<pre><code>create table table1 (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  random INT,
  value INT,
  KEY (value)
);

create table table2 (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  table1 INT,
  random INT,
  CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (table1) REFERENCES table1 (id)
);
</code></pre>

<p>and then populate them with basic data (the procedure I used for doing this is at the bottom of the question) – I can then compare the performance of the following two queries:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select t1.id, t2.id from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id where t1.value = 1 order by t2.id desc limit 1;
+---------+----------+
| id      | id       |
+---------+----------+
| 1109700 | 11097000 |
+---------+----------+
1 row in set (1.23 sec)

mysql&gt; select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id where t1.value = 1 order by t2.id desc limit 1;
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| id      | random | id       | random |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| 1109700 | 749465 | 11097000 | 538840 |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
1 row in set (4.06 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the only difference between these two queries is the inclusion of the two 'random' fields in the select statement – yet it is over three times slower. Also note that I have cleared the linux disk cache via <code>echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code> and innodb buffer pool by restarting mysql before executing each query</p>

<p>Here are the query plans for these two queries:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; desc select t1.id, t2.id from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id where t1.value = 1 order by t2.id desc limit 1;

|  1 | SIMPLE      | t2    | ref  | table1        | table1 | 5       | test.t1.id |     4 | Using index                                  |
+----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+--------+---------+------------+-------+----------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql&gt; desc select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id where t1.value = 1 order by t2.id desc limit 1;
+----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+--------+---------+------------+-------+---------------------------------+
| id | select_type | table | type | possible_keys | key    | key_len | ref        | rows  | Extra                           |

|  1 | SIMPLE      | t2    | ref  | table1        | table1 | 5       | test.t1.id |     4 | NULL                            |
+----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+--------+---------+------------+-------+---------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>So the inclusion of the random fields in the select statement seems to cause the query plan to drop the use of indexes (that's my reading of the 'Extra' column anyway).</p>

<p>I should point out – that whilst in the example above the performance difference is three fold - on my production database the impact is far more pronounced; at closer to 40 times slower. This is because the size of the tables in production are far greater and the table indexes are generally cached (but the record data is not).</p>

<p>I've considered a work around – once I have the output of the first query - I can run the following:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id where t1.value = 1 and t2.id = 11097000 order by t2.id desc;
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| id      | random | id       | random |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| 1109700 | 749465 | 11097000 | 538840 |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>For completeness – I've included the procedure I used to populate the table data (note you might want to alter the value of <code>rows_to_insert</code> if you plan to run this yourself – 1,000,000 rows took four hours for me):</p>

<pre><code>DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE random_fill()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter1, counter2, table1_id, rows_to_insert INT;

    SET counter1 = 0;
    SET rows_to_insert = 1000000;

    label1: LOOP
        SET counter1 = counter1 + 1;

        INSERT INTO table1 ( random, value ) VALUES ( CEIL( RAND() * rows_to_insert ), CEIL( RAND() * 99 ) );
        SET table1_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();

        SET counter2 = 0;
        label2: LOOP
           SET counter2 = counter2 + 1;

           INSERT INTO table2 ( table1, random ) VALUES (  table1_id, CEIL( RAND() * rows_to_insert ) );
           IF counter2 &lt; 10 THEN
              ITERATE label2;
           END IF;
           LEAVE label2;
        END LOOP label2;

        IF counter1 &lt; rows_to_insert THEN
           ITERATE label1;
        END IF;
        LEAVE label1;
    END LOOP label1;
END$$
DELIMITER ;

<p><strong>UPDATE 09/09</strong></p>

<p>I should point out that I've only included the one column in my example to keep it simple. In my production environment - the table in question has 69 columns. We are also using Hibernate - which will select all 69 columns in its select statement. As a result - a covering index is not practical.</p>

<p>My expectation was for MySQL to recognise that - through the use of the 'limit 1' clause - I only need data from 1 row and therefore it would:</p>

<ol>
 1. Use the indexed values to find the PRIMARY KEY for this one 1 row; and<br/>
 2. Go to the disk to only read the value for this 1 row.
</ol>

<p>Instead it seems to be scanning the data for every row on disk - making the query particularly expensive (I don't know for sure this is what it is doing - but something is causing a three second delay when I ask for the values of those two additional columns).</p>

<p>I tried the same example described above on PostGres and found it was doing what I had expected from MySQL and was <strong>incredibly</strong> fast (over 200 times faster):</p>

<pre><code>#     select  t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random
    from  table2 t2
    join  table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id
    where  t1.value = 1
    order by  t2.id desc
    limit  1;

   id   | random |   id    | random 
--------+--------+---------+--------
 999984 | 614113 | 9999840 | 622718
(1 row)

Time: 17.973 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the query plan from PostGres:</p>

<pre><code># explain select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id where t1.value = 1 order by t2.id desc limit 1;
                                                  QUERY PLAN                                                   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   -&gt;  Nested Loop  (cost=0.86..63819201.12 rows=106672 width=16)
         -&gt;  Index Scan Backward using table2_pkey on table2 t2  (cost=0.43..313745.06 rows=10000175 width=12)
         -&gt;  Index Scan using table1_pkey on table1 t1  (cost=0.42..6.34 rows=1 width=8)
               Index Cond: (id = t2.table1)
               Filter: (value = 1)
(6 rows)

Time: 2.407 ms
</code></pre>

<p>So you can see it uses the indexes to find the right row and then reads the data for just this one row.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can force MySQL to take the same approach?</p>

<p>Or will I need to put a work around in the code (i.e. get the primary index first and then get Hibernate to fetch this one row)?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-09-12</strong></p>

<p>OK - I think I understand what you are saying. The <code>Using index</code> statement means that MySQL is <em>only</em> using the index. That it doesn't need to go to the data to get the values for the resultset. In otherwords - <code>Using index</code> indicates MySQL is using a covering index (with 'id' - the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> - being implicitly included in the 'value' key).</p>

<p>So actually I was interpreting that wrong. I originally thought that it meant the use of indexes had been abandoned all together.</p>

<p>Here is the result from the <code>SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Handler%'</code> (the output was the same for both queries):</p>

<pre><code>+----------------------------+--------+
| Variable_name              | Value  |

+----------------------------+--------+
18 rows in set (0.25 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>But thanks to your explanation I think I now have a better understanding of the explain output from MySQL. For the second query it is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Starting with 'table1' and the 'value' key. Using this key it finds all the t1.id values from rows that match the <code>t1.value = 1</code> criteria; then it</li>
<li>Finds all the 'table2' values that have a 'table1' value in the set returned by step 1. It's taking care of the <code>t2.table1=t1.id</code> criteria</li>
</ol>

<p>So the last bit that needs to be satisfied is the <code>order by t2.id desc</code> clause and application of the <code>limit 1</code> clause. And it's here that I think MySQL could do better. It's creating a temporary table and then doing a filesort. But it appears to be getting the values for all the rows before making the temporary table. But because the <code>order by</code> clause is on a <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> - technically it doesn't need to get the data yet. It could satisfy the <code>order by</code> clause, then apply the <code>limit</code> clause and then fetch the data required to complete the resultset. Effectively this:</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION 1 (1.30 sec - a bit faster)</strong></p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select t1.id, t2.id
    -&gt; from table2 t2
    -&gt; join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id
    -&gt; where t1.value = 1
    -&gt; order by t2.id desc
    -&gt; limit 1;
+---------+----------+
| id      | id       |
+---------+----------+
| 1109700 | 11097000 |
+---------+----------+
1 row in set (1.29 sec)

mysql&gt; select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random
    -&gt; from table2 t2
    -&gt; join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id
    -&gt; where t2.id = 11097000;
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| id      | random | id       | random |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| 1109700 | 749465 | 11097000 | 538840 |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>A total of 1.30 sec.</p>

<p>But the most efficient approach is the plan created by PostGres - which is to start with table 2 and move backwards through it until you find your one row that fits the <code>t2.table1=t1.id</code> and <code>t1.value = 1</code> clause. Effectively this:</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION 2 (0.04 sec - the fastest)</strong></p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random
    -&gt; from table2 t2
    -&gt; straight_join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id
    -&gt; where t1.value = 1
    -&gt; order by t2.id desc
    -&gt; limit 1;
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| id      | random | id       | random |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| 1109700 | 749465 | 11097000 | 538840 |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
1 row in set (0.04 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment - the default behaviour of MySQL and Hibernate produces this:</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION 3 (3.82 secs - the slowest)</strong></p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random
    -&gt; from table2 t2
    -&gt; join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id
    -&gt; where t1.value = 1
    -&gt; order by t2.id desc
    -&gt; limit 1;
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| id      | random | id       | random |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
| 1109700 | 749465 | 11097000 | 538840 |
+---------+--------+----------+--------+
1 row in set (3.82 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>With Hibernate - I can't use the <code>straight_join</code> clause so I don't believe <strong>SOLUTION 2</strong> is an option.</p>

<p>But I can get <strong>SOLUTION 1</strong> by putting in place a work around where I get the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> from table 2 first and then get Hibernate to fetch this one row.</p>

<p>Have I got this analysis right? Is there any other options I've missed?</p>

<p>Just for completeness I've included the MySQL query plan for <strong>SOLUTION 2</strong> (there is no more <code>Using temporary; Using filesort</code>):</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; desc select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random
    -&gt; from table2 t2
    -&gt; straight_join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id

<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-09-14</strong></p>

<p>Once I better understood the difference between the MySQL and PostGres query plans - I could immediately see a scenario where the MySQL query plan would perform better:</p>

<p>Default MySQL query:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random
    -&gt; from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id
    -&gt; where t1.value = 111
    -&gt; order by t2.id desc limit 1;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>

<p><code>straight_join</code> MySQL query:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random
    -&gt; from table2 t2
    -&gt; straight_join table1 t1 on t2.table1=t1.id
    -&gt; where t1.value = 111 order by t2.id desc limit 1;
Empty set (6.29 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>The queries are the same as my original examples - the only difference being that I'm now looking for a <code>value</code> of 111 (which isn't in this dataset).</p>

<p>So the PostGres query plan will be faster only if it finds a hit early as it rolls backwards through table2. Which - with my production data - I know will be the case. So <strong>SOLUTION 2</strong> would be ideal but I don't think it is possible via Hiberate.</p>

<p>Here's the output of the JSON explain:</p>

<p>It is effectively creating a derived table (derived2) which has all the t2.id's and the order I need them in - and then joining the t1 and t2 tables so I can get the 'random' values. But the good thing about this approach is when MySQL creates the temporary table (during the 4th item of the explain) it is 'Using index' - thus it is quicker than <strong>SOLUTION 3</strong>. But I don't think you can create derived tables in Hibernate so I tried one last solution.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION 5 (same speed as SOLUTION 3)</strong></p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select t2.id, t2.random
    -&gt; from table2 t2
    -&gt; where (t2.table1, t2.id) IN (select it1.id, it2.id
    -&gt;                              from table1 it1
    -&gt;                              join table2 it2 on it1.id = it2.table1
    -&gt;                              where it1.value = 1
    -&gt;                              order by t2.id desc)

<p>Unfortunately this didn't produce any benefit over <strong>SOLUTION 3</strong>. The difference between this solution and <strong>SOLUTION 4</strong> isn't obvious from the output of the explain plan. The only thing I can think of is that the <code>order by</code> is taking place on the derived table in <strong>SOLUTION 4</strong> (which is only indexed values) and only once every value has been fetched for <strong>SOLUTION 5</strong> (including all the non-indexed <code>random</code> values).</p>

<p>So my preferred solutions (most preferred listed first) are:</p>

<ol>
<li>SOLUTION 2</li>
<li>SOLUTION 4</li>
<li>SOLUTION 1</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think I can implement <strong>SOLUTION 2</strong> or <strong>SOLUTION 4</strong> when using Hibernate - so that leaves <strong>SOLUTION 1</strong>.</p>

<p>Anything else I should try before I proceed with <strong>SOLUTION 1</strong>?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-09-17 - The Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>OK - I've gone with <strong>SOLUTION 1</strong>.</p>

<p>But thank-you Rick. Your assistance has been invaluable. With my new knowledge I've been able to optimise a number of existing queries.</p>

<p>For anyone who is reading this having ran in to the same problem - here's a summary of the problem and a means for resolution.</p>

<p>The simple yet problematic query being generated by Hibernate was:</p>

<pre><code>select tran_.id as id13_1_, tran_.deleted as deleted13_1_, join_item1_.id as id9_0_
from tran tran_
inner join item join_item1_ on tran_.item=join_item1_.id
where join_item1_.itemType=120
order by tran_.id desc
limit 100;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I've reduced the number of fields in the select list and changed the table names to make the example easier to read and more relevant.</p>

<p>I have 17,286,852 rows in <code>tran</code> and 971,020 in <code>item</code> with 105 different item types.</p>

<p>The above query took 20 min 47.32 sec to execute. Way, <em>way</em> too long.</p>

<p>The reason it took so long is because of the order MySQL is processing the steps. It would:</p>

<ol>
<li>First use the index on <code>itemType</code> within the <code>item</code> table to find all the items of the right type (<code>where itemType=120</code>)</li>
<li>Then use the index on <code>item</code> in the <code>tran</code> table for the <code>join</code> (<code>join item on tran.item=item.id</code>)</li>
<li>It would then (not sure of order):

<ul>
<li>a) load the data from every column of every row hit so far; and</li>
<li>b) sort based on <code>tran_.id desc</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reduce the resultset based on the <code>limit 100</code> clause</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, at step 3a) - it is loading a lot of data that isn't in the final resultset. There are 69 columns in the <code>tran</code> table - and prior to applying the <code>limit</code> clause - this resultset has 376,652 rows. It's a very expensive and unnecessary IO exercise!</p>

<p>Once I understood this - I recognised that step 3a) should be applied after step 4. I wanted the order of execution to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>First use the index on <code>itemType</code> within the <code>item</code> table to find all the items of the right type (<code>where itemType=120</code>)</li>
<li>Then use the index on <code>item</code> in the <code>tran</code> table</li>
<li>Sort based on <code>tran_.id desc</code></li>
<li>Reduce the resultset based on the <code>limit 100</code> clause</li>
<li>Load the data from every column for the remaining 100 rows (avoiding the need to load the other 376,552 rows)</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that this order can only be achieved if all the fields used from steps 1 to 4 are included in the indexes used by the query plan. In my example they are (with <code>tran.id</code> being implicitly included in the <code>tran.item</code> index).</p>

<p>To get MySQL to do this - you first want to do steps 1 through 5 with only indexed values in your select list (so your query plan will show <code>Using index</code> at each step). For example (only the select clause is changed):</p>

<pre><code>select tran_.id as id13_1_
from tran tran_
inner join item join_item1_ on tran_.item=join_item1_.id
where join_item1_.itemType=120
order by tran_.id desc
limit 100;
</code></pre>

<p>I can then use this resultset as a derived table to feed my original query both:</p>

<ul>
<li>the 100 rows I need; and</li>
<li>their order.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>select tran_.id as id13_1_, tran_.deleted as deleted13_1_, join_item1_.id as id9_0_
from tran tran_
inner join item join_item1_ on tran_.item=join_item1_.id
inner join (select tran_.id as id13_1_
            from tran tran_
            inner join item join_item1_ on tran_.item=join_item1_.id
            where join_item1_.itemType=120
            order by tran_.id desc
           ) as ids
limit 100;
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to remove the <code>order by</code> clause from your outer query. Otherwise MySQL falls back in to its bad habits. The <code>where</code> clause is no longer necessary in the outer. The <code>limit 100</code> clause can actually be on the inner or outer query.</p>

<p>The query plan for this new query shows the the derived table being created using only index values. It then completes the outer query by starting with <code>tran_.id</code> - so it can quickly find and only load the 100 rows.</p>

<p>You might think that I may as well have written the query like so:</p>

<pre><code>select tran_.id as id13_1_
from tran tran_ force key (PRIMARY)
straight_join item join_item1_ on tran_.item=join_item1_.id
where join_item1_.itemType=120
order by tran_.id desc
limit 100;
</code></pre>

<p>And you would be right - this is much quicker. But only when the 100 rows I need are in the top half of the <code>tran</code> table. It quickly becomes inferior if, for example, I change the limit clause to <code>limit 376552, 100</code> (which took 46 min 11.87 sec to execute).</p>

<p>However - you can't (I don't think) create derived tables in hibernate. You can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) convert the inner table in to a view (and create an additional entity class); or</li>
<li>b) run the inner table first and put the resultset in a <code>in</code> clause</li>
</ul>

<p>I went with option b. Here is the Java code that I originally had:</p>

<pre><code>result = getCriteria().setResultTransformer(Criteria.ROOT_ENTITY).setFirstResult(index).setMaxResults(ROW_BUF_SIZE).list();
</code></pre>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>getCriteria()</code> returns a <code>org.hibernate.Criteria</code> object (pointing at the root entity) which includes the <code>join</code>, <code>where</code> and <code>order by</code> clauses</li>
<li><code>index</code> is the first digit of the <code>limit</code> clause</li>
<li><code>ROW_BUF_SIZE</code> is the second digit of the <code>limit</code> clause (hardcoded to 100)</li>
</ul>

<p>I changed it to be:</p>

<pre><code>    Criteria crit = getCriteria().setResultTransformer(Criteria.ROOT_ENTITY).setFirstResult(index).setMaxResults(ROW_BUF_SIZE);
    List&lt;?&gt; ids = crit.setProjection(Property.forName(""id"")).list();
    crit.setProjection(null).setResultTransformer(Criteria.ROOT_ENTITY);
    if(!ids.isEmpty()) crit.add(Restrictions.in(""id"", ids)).setFirstResult(0);
    result = crit.list();
</code></pre>

<p>So lines 1 and 2 produce the inner query and get the resultset. I reuse the same <code>crit</code> object - so line 3 just reverts the projection created on line 2. Line 4 will add the new <code>in</code> clause (but not if the resultset is empty - as this results in a MySQL exception). Line 5 now gets the same resultset the previous code was getting - but it just gets it a <em>lot</em> faster (in 2 seconds vs. the previous 20 min 47.32 sec in my case).</p>

        let dateFormatter = NSDateFormatter()
        dateFormatter.dateFormat = ""yyyy-MM-dd""
        var date = dateFormatter.dateFromString(survey_date) as NSDate!
        let outputDate = dateFormatter.stringFromDate(date)

        println(outputDate)

        let start = outputDate
        let end = NSDate()

        let dateFormatter2 = NSDateFormatter()
        dateFormatter2.dateFormat = ""yyyy-MM-dd""

        let startDate:NSDate = dateFormatter2.dateFromString(start)!
        let endDate:NSDate = dateFormatter2.dateFromString(end)!

        let cal = NSCalendar.currentCalendar()

        let unit:NSCalendarUnit = .CalendarUnitDay

        let components = cal.components(unit, fromDate: startDate, toDate: endDate, options: nil)

        println(components)

<p>Secondly, I also want to be able to convert the date when possible to a different format - for example d m, Y. This is pretty simple to do in PHP but I can't find a way of doing it in Swift?

I am building a weather data acquisition system. One of the things I would like to do would be to animate the satellite data that is arriving every 15 minutes. In fact, I have already devised a script (called <code>animate</code>) that successfully joins eight hours worth of PNG images into an AVI video file. This runs fine when run manually from the terminal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said when run from my (as in my user, not root) crontab.</p>

<p>Below is the cron job that I mentioned:</p>



<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>1,16,31,46 * * * * /home/daniella/bin/anim_all &gt; /home/daniella/logs/anim_all.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p><code>anim_all</code> simply calls animate for each distinct data product:</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/bash
set -x
cd /home/daniella/data/imager

rm -rf HRIT_MSG3_*.avi

animate HRIT_MSG3_CTT
animate HRIT_MSG3_IR108
animate HRIT_MSG3_VIS006
animate HRIT_MSG3_WV062
</code></pre>

<p>And animate itself calls <code>ffmpeg</code>.</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/bash

set -x
cd /home/daniella/data/imager
product=$1
hl=""$product.8hl""

declare -i i=0
for file in $(cat $hl); do
    link=$(printf ""images%02d.png"" $i)
    ln -sf $file $link
    i=$((i+1))
    echo $i
done

ffmpeg -sameq -r 15 -i images%02d.png $product.avi
rm -rf images*.png
</code></pre>

<p>Just to be clear, the .8hl file is simply a list of PNG file paths that refer to that last 8 hours of data. Since there is new data every 15 minutes, that is a text file with 32 lines. Finally, this is the error that is returned when examining anim_all.log (referred in the crontab) file.</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>+ animate HRIT_MSG3_CTT
animate: unable to open X server `' @ animate.c/AnimateImageCommand/365.
+ animate HRIT_MSG3_IR108
animate: unable to open X server `' @ animate.c/AnimateImageCommand/365.

animate: unable to open X server `' @ animate.c/AnimateImageCommand/365.
+ animate HRIT_MSG3_WV062
animate: unable to open X server `' @ animate.c/AnimateImageCommand/365.
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that <code>anim_all</code> works fine, when called manually from the terminal. This error exists only when called by cron. I would imagine that this has to do with environment variables, but I have sourced my <code>.bashrc</code> inside the script to no prevail. </p>

<p>EDIT - 
Investigating the <code>animate.c</code> file itself (see the full <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/api/MagickWand/animate_8c_source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">code here</a>), at lines 365-368, there is this:</p>

<p>In response, I have attempted to export the <code>$DISPLAY</code> variable to 127.0.0.0:0 in the <code>animate</code> script, but this has not worked. </p>

<p>Everything is working in <strong>Firefox</strong> (I got the array in the new child window page).</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> when I test it in <strong>IE 7</strong>, it does not work, in the new popped up page, IE shows an error =><strong>""Length"" is null or not an object</strong> which complain about ""<code>elements.length</code>"" in <strong>new.js</strong>. It seems IE does not support pass data in this way <code>childWin.parentElements=[1,2,3]</code></p>

<p>How to make this code working in IE?</p>

<p>First time poster here...  I have been searching not only SO, but the entire internet for an answer for the last 2 days.  I am wanting to have a batch file( .bat ), that runs during an uninstall, open a config( .cfg ) file, find an entry, and remove it, then finish the uninstall.</p>

<p><strong>What I have so far:</strong></p>

<p>I have a Installer that runs a Batch file to add the entry into the config file:</p>

<pre><code>[Area.01]
Title=Unique to entry
Location=Unique to entry
Active=Required but in all entries
Layer=Required with Unique Number
Required=Required but in all entries

[Area.02]
Title=Unique to entry
Location=Unique to entry
Active=Required but in all entries
Layer=Required with Unique Number
Required=Required but in all entries
</code></pre>

<p>I have the Install Batch file scan the config and add the next entry number, the content of the Entry, and a REGISTRY key that saves the index of the entry; so logically the next entry would be <code>[Area.03]</code>.  However this file contains over 100 entries.</p>

<p>What I want is for the batch file to read the registry entry, <strong>which it does</strong>, find the entry, <strong>which it does</strong>, and remove the entire entry, <strong>which is why I am here</strong>.  Here is what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>@echo off

REG QUERY ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Name of File"" /v SceneryCFGPath
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO ERROR1
FOR /F ""tokens=3 skip=2"" %%i IN ('REG QUERY ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Name of File"" /v SceneryCFGPath') DO SET VAR1=%%i
CD ""%VAR1%""

REG QUERY ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Name of File"" /v SceneryIndex
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO ERROR2
FOR /F ""tokens=3 skip=2"" %%i IN ('REG QUERY ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Name of File"" /v SceneryIndex') DO SET VAR2=%%i
TYPE scenery.cfg | FINDSTR /V Area.%VAR2%
REG DELETE ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Name of File"" /F
GOTO END

:ERROR1
ECHO There was an Error while changing to Directory ""%VAR1%""...
PAUSE
GOTO ERROR2

:ERROR2
ECHO There was an Error while unregistering from Scenery Library ! Please delete the Area manually...
PAUSE
GOTO END

:END
del ""%~f0""
</code></pre>

<p>When using the <code>FINDSTR</code> it successfully finds the entry, but <strong>ONLY</strong> removes the fist line: <code>[Area.03]</code>.  What I need it to do is remove that and the other portions of that entry.</p>

<p>When I tried to include the other entries in the FINDSTR:</p>

<p><code>TYPE scenery.cfg | FINDSTR /V /N Area.%VAR2% | Title | Active | Layer | Required</code></p>

<p>it removes <strong>ALL</strong> of those lines for every entry.</p>

<p><strong>I really prefer this to be a batch file, as this will run on Windows XP, Vista and 7, 32 and 64 Bit systems.</strong>  As these particular Windows Systems all have <strong>CMD.EXE</strong>, there would be no need for any additional libraries or programs.</p>

<p>I have everything working perfectly, <strong>EXCEPT</strong> removing the whole entry in the config file.  I hope I did not confuse anyone, but any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21866382/java-udp-send-receive-packet-one-by-one"">Java UDP send - receive packet one by one</a></p>

<p>As I indicated there, basically, I want to receive a packet one by one as it is via UDP.</p>

<p>Here's an example code:</p>

<pre><code>ds = new DatagramSocket(localPort);
byte[] buffer1 = new byte[1024];
DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer1, buffer1.length);

ds.receive(packet); 
Log.d(""UDP-receiver"",  packet.getLength() 
                             + "" bytes of the actual packet received"");
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the actual packet size is say, 300bytes, but the <code>buffer1</code> is allocated as 1024 byte, and to me, it's something wrong with to deal with <code>buffer1</code>.</p>

<p>How to obtain the actual packet size <code>byte[]</code> array from here?</p>

<p>and, more fundamentally, why do we need to preallocate the buffer size to receive UDP packet in Java like this? ( node.js doesn't do this )</p>

<p>Is there any way not to pre-allocate the buffer size and directly receive the UDP packet as it is?</p>

<p>Thanks for your thought.</p>

I want one column for each trait with different colours. I have everything figured out, I have the legend, the headings for each column, I have the exact order of the tip labels associated with the right traits, but I have problems plotting it in a nice way in the graph.</p>

<p>I used a plot.phylo2 command to plot the tree so that the tip labels are nicely aligned on the right side, because otherwise the tip labels are associated with the end of the tree branches and this doesn't look nice. However, when I map the traits - it places them right at the end of the branches, so they are in no way aligned and I don't know how to align them nicely in a column. Using the adj command doesn't help, because it just moves them to the right or left, without aligning them in one column.</p>

<p>I hope it is clear what the problem is, otherwise I can make a screenshot of the tree.
Here is a subset of the traits data:</p>

<pre><code>id  host
P_fluorescens   red

<p>The server is PHP 5.2.6 running on Windows NT PDP-IIS 5.2 build 3790.</p>

<p>First I have confirmed sessions ARE working via this test script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
session_start(); 
if (!isset($_SESSION['counter'])) $_SESSION['counter']=0;
echo ""Counter "".$_SESSION['counter']++."".&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="".$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'].""&gt;reload&lt;/a&gt;""; 
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The counter increments - it works.</p>

<p>My site is using a custom built MVC framework (I wrote it), and I put the last code of the app function to this for testing purposes:</p>

<pre><code>echo session_id(); echo '&lt;pre&gt;'; var_dump($_SESSION); echo '&lt;/pre&gt;';
session_write_close(); exit();
</code></pre>

<p>The first few lines of this file are:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', '1');
session_start();
</code></pre>

<p>The session dumps and looks as expected.  Now I go to the server and open up the session file - and the result appears to depend on what browser I'm using.  For Chrome and Safari, the session file was empty.  For Opera and IE8 the session file looked fine.  I'll get to FireFox in a minute - but at this point FireFox appeared fine.</p>

<p>So for testing purposes immediately following session_start() I added the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['bogus'] = -5;
$_SESSION['test'] = 'other';
</code></pre>

<p>I closed my browsers and tried the site again so I could be sure I had a new session.  Again Opera and IE8 session files appeared fine.  Both Chrome and Safari had the 'bogus' and 'test' values, but my other SESSION value was missing.  FireFox at first had the same problem as Chrome and Safari at this point - but upon refreshing the page, the rest of the session showed up.  Refreshing did not help Chrome or Safari.</p>

<p>Here is what the var_dump looks like at this point:</p>

<pre><code>array(3) {
  [""bogus""]=&gt;

<p>I created a different website with a different subdomain, and copied my code exactly over - and it works fine 'saved_form' shows up perfectly in the session files.  So I tried deleting the original website and recreating it - didn't help the problem.</p>

<p>Anyone know what is going on and/or how I can fix it?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

Session session = factory.getCurrentSession();  
session.beginTransaction();  

A a1 = new A(); // Create transient object  
a1.setCode(1);  
a1.setInfo(10);  
session.save(a1); // Persist it  

// Something happening in another layer (see below)

// Continuing with the transaction
Object b = ... // Recover object
session.save(b); // Persist it using transient a2 object as a link but don't change/update its data

System.out.println(b.getA().getInfo()); // Returns 0 not 10;  
session.commit();  
</code></pre>

<p>This happens in another layer (don't have access to the session here):</p>

<pre><code>// * Begin in another layer of the application *  
A a2 = new A(); // Create another transient object same *code* as before  
a2.setCode(1);  
B b = new B(); // Create another transient object  
b.setCode(1);  
b.set(a2);  
// * End and send the b Object to the persistence layer *

<p>Is there any way load/get the persistent child object before saving parent one or is there other way to save the child object without change the info and flush it all? I'm not using JPA. Sorry if I'm terrible wrong.</p>

One thing that concerns me is under the <strong>Security Considerations for XmlSerializer Applications</strong> section it reads: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The XmlSerializer creates C# (.cs)
  files and compiles them into .dll
  files in the directory named by the
  TEMP environment variable;
  serialization occurs with those DLLs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A user may have multiple instances of my application running at the same time.  My concern is that the 2 different instances will be serializing to different XML files, however, the <code>XmlSerializer</code> class in application instance 2 could over write the DLLs generated by the <code>XmlSerializer</code> class in application instance 1.  Should this be a concern, or are temp/unique file names used for these DLL names?</p>

<p>FYI: I need to use XML instead of binary serialization as we need to edit values in the files by hand sometimes.</p>

<p>I've tried several variations on the theme:</p>

<p>Now I would like to create a C++ addon which is exactly the same as the derived
<code>Dog</code> JavaScript function:</p>

<pre><code>void Dog::Init(Handle&lt;Object&gt; exports, Handle&lt;Object&gt; module) {
  Isolate* isolate = Isolate::GetCurrent();

  Local&lt;Function&gt; require = Local&lt;Function&gt;::Cast(module-&gt;Get(
    String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, ""require"")));

  Local&lt;Value&gt; args[] = {
    String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, ""./animal"")
  };  

  Local&lt;Value&gt; animalModule = require-&gt;Call(module, 1, args);

  Local&lt;Function&gt; animalFunc = Local&lt;Function&gt;::Cast(animalModule);   

  Local&lt;FunctionTemplate&gt; tpl = FunctionTemplate::New(isolate, New);
  // tpl-&gt;Inherit(animalFunc); // &lt;-- HERE
  tpl-&gt;SetClassName(String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, ""Dog""));
  tpl-&gt;InstanceTemplate()-&gt;SetInternalFieldCount(1);  

  NODE_SET_PROTOTYPE_METHOD(tpl, ""bark"", Bark);

  constructor.Reset(isolate, tpl-&gt;GetFunction());
  exports-&gt;Set(String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, ""Dog""),
    tpl-&gt;GetFunction());    
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I get a <code>FunctionTemplate</code> from <code>animalFunc</code> / <code>animalModule</code> to be able to inherit from it in <code>tpl</code> function template? Or maybe I should somehow assign <em>animalFunc.prototype</em> to <em>tpl.prototype</em>?</p>

<p>The best way that I can fathom doing this is to grab the stream and dump it to a file which is easy enough to do. My main challenge would be follow the external resources and include them in the zip file. I would like to include stylesheets and images, and images included in the style sheet. I need the stream at request time because the stream that generated is dependent on things like the current session.</p>

<p>I'm wondering also if perhaps all these locations should be normalized, in other words, reroute the references to the same directory with the main document resides.</p>

<p>I can guarantee that all external resources will be located on the same server.</p>

Is there any such approach?</p>

<p>I'm working on a Titanium app right now and bumping into this real world scenario:</p>

<p>I have a set of facilities for which I need to the calculate distance from the user's current location. This entails getting the user's current position (which only needs to happen once) and, while looping through the facility locations, getting the position for each one and calculating the distance. The APIs that retrieve locations (long/lat) are asynchronous so the ""easy"" approach looks like this (pseudo-code follows):</p>

<pre><code>foreach facility {
  API.getCurrentLocation( function( location ) { // async, takes a callback fxn arg
    var here = location.coordinates;

    API.getFacilityLocation( function( e ) { // async, takes a callback fxn arg
      var there    = e. coordinates;
      var distance = API.calculateFrom( here, there );
    });
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because this is all in a loop, though, I'm calculating my current position each time -- more work than I really need to do. I haven't yet managed to refactor this in such a way that I'm only getting the current location once and still having that location available for the distance calculation.</p>

<p>Given the explosion of languages that support lambdas and closures, I keep thinking that someone must have found an approach to keep these waterfalls manageable, but I have yet to find a good explanation of how to organize such a solution.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or hints?</p>

<p>Any insight would be tremendously appreciated.</p>

<p>How do we implement a less ridiculously rigid, more extensible FormsAuthentication framework that will allow us to integrate into a custom MembershipProvider?  Has there been any work on this?  Ultimately, I'd like to put in my web.config something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;authentication mode=""Forms""&gt;
    &lt;forms membershipProvider=""MyCustomMembershipProvider""&gt;
        &lt;events&gt;
            &lt;add event=""AuthenticatedRequest"" action=""OnAuthRequest"" /&gt;
            &lt;add event=""UnAuthenticatedRequest"" action=""OnRequest"" /&gt;
            &lt;add event=""UnAuthorizedRequest"" action=""UnAuthRequest"" /&gt;
        &lt;/events&gt;
    &lt;/forms&gt;
&lt;/authentication&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This shouldn't be taking up all my time.  The Forms Authentication seems to be pretty low-level in the ASP.NET page lifecycle, but there's got to be a way to cleanly circumvent it.</p>

<p>This is not about the custom membership provider.  I want to implement things in my membership provider class like the implied ""IsOnline"" and ""LastActivity"" functionality, but the FormsAuthentication sets the cookie and doesn't look back.  I want to inject my own code when it checks that cookie, but I can't.  There has to be a way other than layering my own cookie on top.</p>

<pre><code>class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
  def testFirstThing(self):
    with GetResource() as resource:
      u = UnderTest(resource)
      u.doStuff()
      self.assertEqual(u.getSomething(), 'a value')

  def testSecondThing(self):
    with GetResource() as resource:
      u = UnderTest(resource)
      u.doOtherStuff()
      self.assertEqual(u.getSomething(), 'a value')
</code></pre>

<p>When this gets to many tests, this is clearly going to get boring, so in the spirit of SPOT/DRY (single point of truth/dont repeat yourself), I'd want to refactor those bits into the test <code>setUp()</code> and <code>tearDown()</code> methods.</p>

<p>However, trying to do that has lead to this ugliness:</p>

<pre><code>  def setUp(self):
    self._resource = GetSlot()
    self._resource.__enter__()

  def tearDown(self):
    self._resource.__exit__(None, None, None)
</code></pre>

<p>There must be a better way to do this. Ideally, in the <code>setUp()</code>/<code>tearDown()</code> without repetitive bits for each test method (I can see how repeating a decorator on each method could do it).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Consider the undertest object to be internal, and the <code>GetResource</code> object to be a third party thing (which we aren't changing).</p>

<p>I've renamed <code>GetSlot</code> to <code>GetResource</code> here—this is more general than specific case—where context managers are the way which the object is intended to go into a locked state and out.</p>

<p>So I have a situation where I normally have gz files over 30 GB I split on 2GB using split and then push each split to S3.</p>

<p>Unfortunately now I run the split and then when it is finished I move each split in parallel.</p>

<p>I would like to split and as soon as the first part file is finished being written, execute the push command and do the same for each part file as it is finished. This would save me allot of time and lower the amount of time I am flooding the systems outgoing band.</p>

<p>Anyway I looked for --exec or something like it on split and it just does not exist. I can and will write a script to watch the split-to dir and act accordingly but I thought I would ask if anyone had a command that already does this that I just am unaware of.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>By flexible I mean</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose what should be compressed, minified, and combined</li>
<li>Add exceptions. E.g. if debug don't compress XYZ.JS or don't minify ABC.CSS</li>
<li>Caching</li>
<li>In the end, it should help offer the best YSLOW score.</li>

<p>The code compiles and runs perfectly on the native system, by the way.</p>

<p>Is this issue because of lack of support of the basic C++ library?
Do I need to provide a different include PATH?
Since this is a huge code, the option to handle these warnings manually it's kinda out of the question.</p>

<p>I have investigated further and according to a comment to <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5731"" rel=""nofollow"">GAE Issue 5371</a> the Files API closes the file every 30 seconds. I have not seen this documented anywhere else.  </p>

<p>I have tried to work around this by closing and opening the file at intervals but now I get an WrongOpenModeError. The code below is edited from the first version of this post I have added a 0.5 second pause between the close and the open of the file. It now throws a WrongOpenModeError.</p>

<p>My code (updated):</p>

<pre><code>PATH = '/gs/backupbucket/'
for df in DocumentFile.all():           
  fn = df.blob.filename
  br = blobstore.BlobReader(df.blob)
  write_path = files.gs.create(self.PATH+fn.encode('utf-8'), mime_type='application/zip',acl='project-private') 
  fp = files.open(write_path, 'a')
  c = 0
  while True:       
    if (c == 5):
      c = 0
      fp.close()
      files.finalize(write_path)
      time.sleep(0.5)
      fp = files.open(write_path, 'a')
    c = c + 1
    buf = br.read(100000)
    if buf=="""": break
    fp.write(buf)
  files.finalize(write_path)

<p>I have tried to find information about the WrongOpenModeError but the only place it is mentioned is in the appengine.api.files.file.py itself.</p>

<p>Suggestions on how to  get around this and be able to save also large files to Google Cloud storage would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>If I use <a href=""http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">MySQLdb</a> to do a Table Join in python, then there may be problems, </p>

print result       
#{'name':'blah blah'}
</code></pre>

<p>The finale result will be a dictionary with only one key <code>name</code>, that is because <code>cur.description</code> has no information about table name, only table colum name, so the table2.name overwrites the table1.name.</p>

<p>Is this a bug?</p>

<p>Why is this the case and why does a loop with in a Callback procedure stop it from executing after its initial firing?</p>

<p>I have made a workaround by using a while(true) infinte loop and using the Thread.Timer to pause the process after x amount of milliseconds.</p>

<p>My new vised code with the while loop looks like this:</p>

<p>I've been searching around for quite a time and I'm still unclear as to what direction to take.  It seems there are a billion* libraries that I could use, but I want to know what would be the correct, proper supported method of achieving this.</p>

<p>Essentially, I have a very simple requirement to list and download files from Sites on our Office 365 subscription to an iOS application. </p>

<p>Initially, I looked at the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/dn450841.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">REST interface for Sharepoint</a> and, from a browser, was able to easily perform a GET to our site and receive and receie a response with meta data about the file, for example:</p>

<pre>
https://mytenantid.sharepoint.com/_api/web/getfilebyserverrelativeurl('/MyFile/Here/Document.txt')
</pre>

<p>I could also retrieve JSON output  instead of XML by specifying an Accept header of application/json using the POSTMAN REST client for Chrome.</p>

<p>So far, so easy.  Just the authentication to do outside of the browser and that's it.</p>

<p>Phew!!</p>

<p>I started by looking at Basic authentication, but wasn't sure if this is the right way to do it and even if it would work?</p>

<p>On looking further, it seems that actually, using OAuth might be the way to go.  Apparently, you can either do this yourself (no idea how), or use a library (ADAL?) from Microsoft?  Unfortunately, this all looks half baked will very little documentation that seems to work.  It also requires the use of CocoaPods and workspaces and isn't just a simple library that I can copy to my project and start using (a la SwiftyJSON).  There also seems to be a lot of other libraries around too.</p>

<p>I should mention that I'm using Swift, so I've tried converting code from Objective C to Swift (unsuccessfully) too.  Apparently I can't use ""readWithCallback"" with an argument list that the code tells me I should actually use -- even a sample application I downloaded had the same issue.</p>

<p>I've also tried using node.js with a script (not a Web Application) and the documentation and number of libraries available for that is almost worse.</p>

<p>Any assistance to achieve this really simple capability would be hugely appreciated -- it's been driving me nuts.</p>

<p>Many thanks,
D.</p>

But, in my case, instead of using an <code>Image</code> to override background image for that buttons, I wanted to add my own template.</p>

<p>So I created a <code>ResourceDictionary</code> that applies a style for Maximize/Minimize/Restore/Close buttons.</p>

<p>The thing is that I override the template. As an example, see the <strong>PART_MINIMIZE</strong> button:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;Button x:Name=""PART_MINIMIZE"" 
      Width=""30""
      Height=""20""
      Margin=""0,0,4,0""
      HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" 
      Template=""{DynamicResource MinimizeButton}"" 
      VerticalAlignment=""Center"" 
      DockPanel.Dock=""Right""&gt;
  &lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>DynamicResource</strong> called <strong>MinimizeButton</strong> stablishes the full template. The problem comes when I click the button. As I override the <code>Template</code> part, it has no behaviour defined by me by default. But I want to keep Maximize/Minimize/Restore/Close behaviour by default, without overriding it. So...</p>

<p>How can I say in the template to inherit the behaviour of the button? Or how to simulate them?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I have the following sql insert statement that I'd like to clean up:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO [lttadev].[dbo].[GameInst]
           ([GameInstId]
           ,[GameSetId]

           ,[ModifiedOn]
           ,[ModifiedBy])
     VALUES
           (&lt;GameInstId, uniqueidentifier,&gt;
           ,&lt;GameSetId, uniqueidentifier,&gt;
           ,&lt;UserInfoId, uniqueidentifier,&gt;
           ,&lt;GameLevelId, uniqueidentifier,&gt;

           ,&lt;ModifiedOn, datetime,&gt;
           ,&lt;ModifiedBy, uniqueidentifier,&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>To alter the values clause I have the two following regular expressions:</p>

<pre><code>,[^,]*,\&gt;
\&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>Both are replaced by an empty string to delete the unwanted text.  The first one strips out the comma, type, second comma and final angle bracket.  The second one strips out the initial angle bracket.  Both work as expected.</p>

<p>However if I join the regexes up into a single expression to speed the text processing, they select different text:</p>

<pre><code>(,[^,]*,\&gt;|\&lt;)
</code></pre>

<p>The first expression selects the expected text.  However the second expression gets the first angle bracket as well as the preceding comma.  Is this a defect in the regular expression engine or am I not understanding something here?</p>

<p>So the way I approached it works like this:</p>

<p>First I map a method to receive the post data sent by the user, then generate the URL of the actual PDF converter and pass it to the model:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public String formPost(Model model, HttpServletRequest request) {
      //Gather parameters and generate PDF url
      Long idPdf = Long.parseLong(request.getParam(""idPdf""));
      //feed the jsp the url of the to-be-generated image
      model.addAttribute(""image"", ""getImage?idPdf="" + idPdf);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in getImageMethod I download the PDF and then generate a PNG out of it:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(""/getImage"")
    public HttpEntity&lt;byte[]&gt; getPdfToImage(@RequestParam Long idPdf) {
      String url = ""myPDFrepository?idPDF="" + idPdf;
      URL urlUrl = new URL(url);
            URLConnection urlConnection;
            urlConnection = urlUrl.openConnection();
            InputStream is = urlConnection.getInputStream();
       return PDFtoPNGConverter.convert(is);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My JSP just has an img tag that refers to this url:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""${image}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far this work perfectly. But now I need to allow the possibility of viewing multi page PDFs, converted as PNGS, each of them in a different page. So I would add a <code>page</code> parameter, then feed my model with the image url including that page parameter, and in my <code>getImage</code> method I would convert only that page. </p>

<p>But the way it is implemented, I would be downloading the PDF again for each page, plus an additional time for the view, so it can find out whether this specific PDF has more pages and then show the ""prev"" and ""next"" buttons.</p>

<p>What would be a good way to preserve the same file during these requests, so I download it just once? I thought about using temp files but then managing its deletion might be a problem. So maybe storing the PDF in the session would be a good solution? I don't even know if this is good practice or not.</p>

<p>I am using Spring MVC by the way.</p>

<li><p>Even with the <code>-MD</code> option enabled, <code>as</code> attempts to assemble the source code, which could generate an error and halt the entire build process. I would expect it to output the dependencies instead of assembling the code, rather than performing both actions.</p></li>

<p>While these are little more than annoyances right now, I can see this significantly affecting my builds as the project grows larger—particularly the latter. Is there a way to get <code>as</code> to output dependencies without trying to assemble the code?</p>

<p>I am having trouble understanding how to set this up in the AWS.</p>

<p>ElasticBeanStalk provides 2 types of environments,
1. worker and 2. webserver.</p>

<p>Thought the worker type environment fits the bill, according to the documentation. AWS deploys a daemon in ec2 instances, and pulls off the message from SQS and envelopes that into a message body of the http post request. This post request can be used to post to a web server.</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features-managing-env-tiers.html#worker-environ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features-managing-env-tiers.html#worker-environ</a></p>

<p>However the component I wrote does that. Pulls off the message from the queue, and does some background processing.</p>

<p>In this case which environment type should i opt?</p>

<a href=""http://www.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/</a> ? <br></p></li>

<p><br>
 &nbsp;So how to <b><em>always</em></b> load pages in current window despite the attribute

"27735139","1","27743616","","2015-01-01 22:07:19","","1","79","<p>In the last months I've created a very simple access application to keep track of expenses in the company I work for, (just to be clear: it is a REALLY simple database, but it gets the job done and my colleagues are quite happy to use it instead of the old PenAndPaper method they were used to, anyway...) one of the feature my application has is that it allocates every expense to one or more cost center (for example, if we buy 1000€ of material, we register the expense and then we can register that we used 600€ in Cost center A and 400€ in cost center B).</p>

<p>I've got 3 tables (I will write only the tables and fields that are relevant for the problem at hand):</p>

<p>Expenses(<strong>idExpense</strong>, cost)</p>

<p>Centers(<strong>idCenter</strong>,canterName)</p>

<p>Allocation(<strong>idAllocation</strong>,idExpense,idCenter,allocatedCost)</p>

<p>in the ""Expenses"" table the field cost is what has been spent, , while the Allocation table establish a many-to-many relationship between Centers and Expenses. So, in the examble above we will have:</p>

<pre><code>Center
IDCenter name
1        Center A
2        Center B

Expenses
IDExpenses cost
1          1000

Allocations
IDAllocations IDCenter IDExpense AllocatedCost
1             1        1         600
2             2        1         400
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is that I don't know how to validate the data in the AllocatedCost Field: suppose I add another expense</p>

<pre><code>Expenses
IDExpenses cost
1          1000
2           100
</code></pre>

<p>nothing prevents the user to allocate it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Allocations
IDAllocations IDCenter IDExpense AllocatedCost
1             1        1         600
2             2        1         400
3             1        2          60
4             2        2          50
</code></pre>

<p>In this case I end up with an invalid entry 110€ are allocated for an expense that is only of 1000! I need to prevent this in the data entry phase, since are most likely typing errors but I have no idea about how to do it. All I've managed to do is to prevent a single allocation to exceed the expense's amount and I've written a simple query that finds this cases, so I can check them manually, but I would like the form to check it when the data are fed to the DB.</p>

<li>Creating thousands of threads immediately</li>
</ul>

<p>In taskmgr.exe you may see about ~1,5 of threads and about ~50kb of allocated memory.
Also, I compiled program as 32 bit, but in vmmap utility you may see a lot of 64 bit stacks. My OS is 64 bit, but in taskmgr.exe you may see *32 , I don’t know how 32 bit program uses 64 bit stack, maybe it’s normal for launching 32 bit program in 64 bit OS, but I have no knowledge about this design of OS, so I shall be very pleased , if you give me a piece of advice on this question.</p>

<p>So, why did my program creates immediately a lot of threads? <em>( I guess , cause of while(true) block )</em>.</p>

<p>But , I want the next:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create each thread for each new request</li>
<li>When request has been handled, then terminate the thread and free the memory</li>

<p>The Problem: 
I have some UIViewControllers with table views being pushed into the navigation stack, since my Tab Bar is part of the view and not the navigation stack the TableViews are cut off at the buttom because the Navigation Controller does not know of the tab bar because its in its view and n ot the navigation stack. Without a navigation controller i would just resize the ViewControllers view and it would work fine, but when i try to do that it seems like the NavigationCOntroller just ignores my frame and sets its own and therefore the table views are cut off. I found one solution which was to add some extra cells and hide them and that works sort of OK but its kind of hackerish, anyone have any suggestion of how  to go about this in a different non -hackerish way? </p>

Item Name: David Blaine<br>

<p>Code for this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;sql:query var=""result""&gt;

&lt;/sql:query&gt;

&lt;table border=""1"" width=""100%""&gt;

<p>What I want to do is clicking on Image hyperlink should redirect user to another page (jspimage.jsp) were the specific image is displayed. </p>

<p>Code for jspimage.jsp</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sql:query var=""fa""&gt;
select item_image_loc from inventory 
where item_image_loc='${param.itemCode}';
&lt;/sql:query&gt;
&lt;c:out value=""You have bought the item:"" /&gt;

&lt;c:out value=""${fa.rows[0]['item_image_loc']}"" /&gt;

<p>In IE, if body (or another html div has focus), then you keypress &amp; click on flash at the <strong>same time</strong>, then release... <em>a keyup event is never fired</em>.  It is not fired in javascript or in flash.  Where is this keyup event?</p>

<p>This is the order of event firing you get instead:</p>

<ol>
<li>javascriptKeyEvent: bodyDn ** currentFocusedElement: body</li>
<li>javascriptKeyEvent: docDn ** currentFocusedElement: body</li>
<li>actionScriptEvent : activate ** currentFocusedElement: [object]</li>
<li>actionScriptEvent : mouseDown ** currentFocusedElement: [object]</li>
<li>actionScriptEvent : mouseUp ** currentFocusedElement: [object]</li>
</ol>

<p>Subsequent keydown and keyup events are captured by flash, but that initial keyUp is never fired..  anywhere.  And I need that keyup!</p>

<p>What does not work:</p>

<ul>
<li>checking if the key is up without a listener.  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828613/check-if-a-key-is-down"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828613/check-if-a-key-is-down</a></li>
<li>wmode opaque or direct.  Although, with opaque, it is far more difficult to reproduce.</li>
<li>pushing the focus back to javascript asap to catch the up event.  (tried this with a blur listener in javascript and setting focus when as3 is activated.)</li>
<li>neither jquery or prototype capture the missing keyup</li>
<li>both static and dynamic swfobject publishing</li>

<p>Say I have 2000 files that need to be processed by a single-threaded executable. For each file, the executable reads it, does its thing and outputs it to a correspoinding output file, then exits. </p>

<p>For instance: </p>

<pre><code>FILES=/path/to/*
for f in $FILES
do
    # take action on each file
    ./executable $f outFileCorrespondingTo_f
done
</code></pre>

<p>The tools are not coded for multi-threaded execution, or looping through the files, nor do we wish to change anything in their code for now. They're written in C with some external libraries.</p>

<p>My questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Could this kind of ""script-looping"" be run on the Xeon Phi's native OS in such a way that it parallelizes the calls to the executable, so they run concurrently on all of its cores? Is it ""general-purpose"" enough for that?</p></li>
<li><p>The files themselves are rather small, so its 8GB memory would be more than enough for storing the data at runtime, but not for keeping all of the output on the device, so I would need to output on the host. So my second quetion is: is this kind of memory exchange possible ""externally""? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>i.e. not coded into the tool, but managed by the host OS and the device, for every execution of the executable.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>If this is possible, could it provide a performance boost in any way, or would the memory and thread allocation bottlenecks be too intensive? Basically each execution takes a few seconds, depending on the length of the input file, but I'm pretty confident this is a few orders of magnitude longer than how much it would take to transfer the file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for your time!</p>

<p>We have a few CF's that we did not place secondary indices on because we were under the impression that secondary indices would (eventually) cause significant performance issues for heavy read/write CF's. We are trying to turn to Solr to allow for searching these CF's but it looks like loading an index schema modifies the CF's to have secondary indices on the columns of interest.</p>

<p>Would like to know if Solr indexing is different than Cassandra's secondary indexing? And, will it eventually cause slow queries (inserts/reads) for CFs w/ large data sets and heavy read/writes? If so, would you advise custom indexing (which we wanted to avoid)? Btw -- we're also using (trying to use) Solr for its spatial searching.</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice/links you can give. </p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE: To better understand why I’m asking these questions and to see if I am asking the right question(s) – description of our use case:</p>

<p>We’re collecting sensor events – many!  We are storing them in both a time series CF (EventTL) and skinny CF (Event).  Because we are writing (inserting and updating) heavily in the Event CF, we are not placing any secondary indices.  Our queries right now are limited to single events via Event or time range of events through EventTL (unless we create additional fat CF’s to allow range queries on other properties of the events).</p>

<p>That’s where DSE (Solr+Cassandra) might help us.  We thought that leveraging Solr searching would allow us to avoid creating extra fat CF’s to allow searches on other properties of the events AND allow us to search on multiple properties at once (location + text/properties).  However, looking at how the definition of the Event CF changes after adding an index schema for Event via Solr shows that secondary indices were created.  This leads to the question of whether these indices will create issues for inserting/updating rows in Event (eventually).  We require being able to insert new events ‘quickly’ – because events can potentially come in at 1000+ per sec.</p>

        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""DestinationAirportID"" id=""DestinationAirportID"" /&gt;

<p>When someone types in ""LHR"" in the OriginAirportID field the following is sent:</p>

<pre><code>        term=LHR
</code></pre>

<p>This is the response:</p>

<pre><code>        [{""AirportID"":16420,""Name"":""London Heathrow Airport""}]
</code></pre>

<p>In my $.ajax is below:</p>

<pre><code>                $.ajax({
                    url: ""/Flight/&lt;MethodName&gt;"",
                    type: ""POST"",
                    dataType: ""json"",
                    data: { term: request.term },
                    success: function (data) {
                        response($.map(data, function (item) {
                            return { label: item.Name, value: item.Name };

</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if this is not clear or confusing and I will try and provide more information.</p>

<p>EDIT: 4/12/14 1844 GMT</p>

<p>Thank you for the three responses so far regarding the model looking like the js object and also the hidden field technique. I shall tinker away with each of the suggestions and see whether it finally accepts the model. StuartLC - I guess I was thinking it was clever but just realised the code you pointed out has no AirportID what so ever! This will definitely compound the problem.</p>

<p>It doesnt seem to get <code>tasklist</code> from the script block in the nested template block, but prints it out in the <code>ready</code> block.</p>

<a href=""https://to-do-prateekjadhwani.c9.io/demo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://to-do-prateekjadhwani.c9.io/demo.html</a></p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>*****EDIT****</p>

<p>Since, it was using localstorage, it was using data in tasklist from LocalStorage rather than updating itself with the code iteration. 
So, I believe that this issue is resolved. But feel free to add comment(s) if you think that my reasoning isn't correct.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

But my app got rejected from the marketplace due to error 5.2.3 i.e Application Responsiveness After Being Deactivated. 
What I found was : 
After a user successfully completes the game(a puzzle), I am showing him a dialog : </p>

<pre><code>MessageBoxResult mr = MessageBox.Show(""You have won! Do you want to start another game?"", ""Information"", MessageBoxButton.OKCancel);
if(mr==MessageBoxResult.Cancel)

<p>Now the point is - If the user presses the start button after this dialog box is displayed, the app stops throwing an exception -<br>
  Navigation is not allowed when the task is not in the foreground. Error: -2147220990</p>

<p>It seems to me a valid error, though I am not sure how my other apps successfully passed the certification process though they had the same flaw. I have just started developing WP apps so I dont have much knowledge of things to do. Please could you help me a workaround. </p>

<p>When I click on the button it executes the phing buildfile (runs cmd), saved the console output into a txt file and shows the output in one textbox.</p>

<p>The problem is I have some tasks that need user's input, like SVN commit that needs user to input the commit message.</p>

<p>When I executed the commit task, was showed an empty cmd for the user write the commit message, but the question is not showed, so the user have to guess what's expected to him to write in the console.</p>

<p>I created a input box with the question and the textbox for user answer, but how can I assign the text from the Textbox to the variable within xml file ?
Sorry for some English errors ...</p>

        &lt;echo msg=""Revisao do Commit numero: ${svn.committedrevision}""/&gt;

     &lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So it shows the message ""Introduza a mensagem do Commit"" and the answer is assigned to commit_message.
In C# I've got an inputbox and I want the text from the textbox to be the value of the ""commit_message"" in the xml file</p>

<p>I could see the jars signed with the s1as key, but javaws still complains.
The JNLP is generated by Glassfish automatically using the settings from our sun-application-client.xml</p>

"24903432","1","","","2014-07-23 06:37:57","","0","188","<p>I'm going to describe my scenario:</p>

<p>I have a <code>UIViewController</code> that is always loaded whenever a user signs in the app because it manages an <code>UIView</code> that is always shown once the user is logged in. This <code>UIView</code> disappears when the user logs out. This <code>UIViewController</code> has a <code>@property (strong, nonatomic) NSTimer *timer;</code> declared. I want this timer to show the user a countdown that may take several minutes long. This timer should start whenever the <code>UIView</code> is shown and restarts its counting for every 20 secs in order to refresh the countdown displayed each 20 secs until it reaches 0:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)start
{
   if (self.timer != nil) {
      [self.timer invalidate];
       self.timer = nil;
   }

   // Some operations here
   self.countdown = untilTime;    // countdown total secs

   self.timer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:20
                                                  target:self
                                                selector:@selector(notifyTimerTick:)
                                                userInfo:nil
                                                 repeats:YES];
}

- (void)notifyTimerTick:(NSTimer *)timer
{
   self.countdown -= 20;

   if (self.countdown &lt;= 0) {
    [self start];
   }

   [self updateCountdown];    // Countdown label shown to user
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is, whenever the countdown reaches 0, a new countdown starts again for N minutes depending on certain operations I perform in <code>-(void)start</code> method. And this scenario should keep working as long as the user is logged in the app.</p>

<p>In <code>AppDelegate</code>, I stop this timer when the app becomes inactive or goes to background (or user logs out):</p>

<pre><code>- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
   if (isUserLogged) {
      [self.countdownViewController stopTimer];
   }
}

- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application
{
   if (isUserLogged) {
      [self.countdownViewController stopTimer];
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>stopTimer</code> method is this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)stopTimer
{
   if (self.timer != nil) {
      [self.timer invalidate];
      self.timer = nil;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I start again the timer in <code>applicationDidBecomeActive:</code> method by calling <code>-(void)start</code> method I already described, method that I also call when the user logs in the app.</p>

<p>This is working for me the 95% of times, but I've found in a couple of times during testing that sometimes the countdown goes faster than it should. I mean, for example: if countdown should take 6 min, it took more or less 3 min to reach the 0 value the last time I saw this weird effect, and the countdown shown to user was updating faster as well. It was like there were more than one timer performing the countdown, but I don't understand why, because it is usually working fine and I don't find what circumstances are causing this.</p>

<p>I found this fast countdown while testing a beta version of the app in a real iOS 7 device. When I wanted to see what was happening, and I connected the device to <code>Xcode</code> and <code>Instruments</code>, the app launching caused the timer working fine again, so I couldn't debug nor see anything in 'Instruments' of this scenario. </p>

<p>I think I'm managing the timer correctly, am I missing something? Has somebody experienced something like this? I've read some posts about releasing timers, but they only say that you have to invalidate the timer and I'm already doing it:</p>

<p>I need help to analyze this issue. Thanks a lot in advance</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Does my code ensure that only one <code>NSTimer</code> object can be running? Should I manage something related to the timer in <code>dealloc</code> method?</p>

"1888539","1","1889564","","2009-12-11 14:48:09","","2","1922","<p>I am looking for advice for an application I am developing that uses Google Map.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
A user has a list of criteria for searching a street segment that fulfills the criteria. The street segments will be colored with 3 colors for showing those below average, average and over average. Then the user clicks on the street segment to see an information window showing the properties of that specific segment hiding those not selected until he/she closes the window and other polyline becomes visible again. This looks quite like the Monopoly City Streets game Hasbro made some month ago the difference being I do not use Flash, I can’t use Open Street Map because it doesn’t list street segment (if it does the IDs won’t be the same anyway) and I do not have to show Google sketch building over.</p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong>
I have a database of street segments with IDs, polyline points and centroid.
The database has 6,000,000 street segment records in it. To narrow the generated data a bit we focus on city. The largest city we must show has 250,000 street segments. This means 250,000 line segment polyline to show.</p>

<p>Our longest polyline uses 9600 characters which is stored in two 8000 varchar columns in SQL Server 2008.</p>

<p>We need to use the API v3 because it is faster than the API v2 and the application will be ported to iPhone. For now it's an ASP.NET 3.5 with SQl Server 2008 application.
Performance is a priority.</p>

<p><strong>Problems:</strong>
Most of the demo projects that do this are made with API v2. So besides tutorial on the Google API v3 reference page I have nothing to compare performance or technology use to achieve my goal.
There is no available .NET wrapper for the API v3 yet.</p>

<p>Generating a 250,000 line segment polyline creates a heavy file which takes time to transfer and parse. (I have found a <a href=""http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/EncodePolyline/fractalLog5Log4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">demo</a> of one polyline of 390,000 points. I think the encoder would be far less efficient with more polylines with less points since there will be less rounding.)
Since streets segments are shown based on criteria, polylines must be dynamically created and cache can't be used.</p>

<p><strong>Some thoughts:</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>KML/KMZ:</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Pros:</em>
Since it is a standard we can easily load Bing maps, Yahoo! maps, Google maps, Google Earth, with the same KML file. The data generation would be the same.</p>

<p><em>Cons:</em>
LineString in KML cannot be encoded polyline like the Google map API can handle. So it would probably be bigger and slower to display. Zipping the file at the size it will take more processing time and require the client side to uncompress the data and I am not quite sure with 250,000 data how an iPhone would handle this and how a server would handle 40 users browsing at the same time.</p>

<p><em><strong>JavaScript file:</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Pros:</em>
JavaScript file can have <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/polylinealgorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">encoded polyline</a> and would significantly reduce the file to transfer.</p>

<p><em>Cons:</em>
Have to create my own stripped version of API v3 to add overlays, create polyline, etc. It is more complex than just create a KML file and point to the source.</p>

<p><em><strong>GeoRSS:</em></strong>
This option isn't adapted for my needs I think, but I could be wrong.</p>

<p><em><strong>MapServer:</em></strong>
I saw some post suggesting using MapServer to generate overlays. Not quite sure for the connection with our database and the performance it would give. Plus it requires a plugin for generating KML. It seems to me that it wouldn't allow me to do better than creating my own KML or JavaScript file. Maintenance would be simpler without.</p>

<p><em><strong>Monopoly City Streets:</em></strong>
The game is now over, but for those who know what I am talking about Monopoly City Streets was showing at max zoom level only the streets that the centroid was inside the Bounds of the window. Moving the map was sending request to the server for the new streets to show. While I think this was ingenious, I have no idea how to implement something similar. The only thing I thought about was to compare if the long was inside the bound of map area X and same with Y. While this could improve performance significantly at high zoom level, this would give nothing when showing a whole city.</p>

<p><em><strong>Clustering:</em></strong>
While cluster is awesome for marker, it seems we cannot cluster polylines. I would have liked something like <a href=""http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2009/04/markerclusterer-solution-to-too-many.html"" rel=""nofollow"">MarkerClusterer</a> for polylines and be able to cluster by my 3 polyline colors. This will probably stay as a “would have been freaking awesome but forget it”.</p>

<p><em><strong>Arrow:</em></strong>
I will have in a future version to show a direction for the polyline and will have to show an arrow at the centroid. Loading an image or marker will only double my data so creating a custom overlay will probably be my only option. I have found that <a href=""http://wtp2.appspot.com/ArrowLine.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">demo</a> for something similar I would like to achieve. Unfortunately, the demo is very slow, but I only wish to show 1 arrow per polyline and not multiple like the demo. This functionality will depend on the format of data since I don't think KML support custom overlays.</p>

<p><em><strong>Criteria:</em></strong>
While the application is done with ASP.NET 3.5, the port to the iPhone won't use the web to show the application and be limited in screen size for selecting the criteria. This is why I was more orienting on a service or page generating the file based on criteria passed in parameters. The service would than generate the file I need to display the polylines on the map. I could also create an aspx page that does this. The aspx page is more documented than the service way. There should be a reason.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Should I create a web service to returns the street segments file or create an aspx page that return the file?</li>
<li>Should I create a JavaScript file with encoded polyline or a KML with longitude/latitude based on the fact that maximum longitude/latitude polyline have 9600 characters and I have to render maximum 250,000 line segment polyline. Or should I go with a MapServer that generate the overlay?</li>
<li>Will I be able to display simple arrow on the polyline on the next version.</li>
<li>In case of KML generation is it faster to create the file with <code>XDocument</code>, XmlDocument, <code>XmlWriter</code> and this manually or just serialize the street segment in the stream?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is more a brainstorming Stack Overflow question than an actual code problem. Any answer helping narrow the possibilities is as good as someone having all the knowledge to point me out a better choice.</p>

<p>I am calling Type.GetProperties(), but after running Dotfuscator, it is returning zero items, when it returned more than zero before.</p>

<p>If I exclude the ""Number"" property from renaming within Dotfuscator, then it works, but otherwise it doesn't.  However, it is not possible for me to do this for all properties in my project, as it would lead to possible bugs.</p>

<p>Are there any workarounds for this method?  Or even other ""free"" obfuscation applications I could use?</p>

<p>It looks like the part that is blowing up is <code>multiparty</code> and I've looked into that code a little bit to no avail. I'm not certain if I'm making the request incorrectly or if there's something wrong with my server code. I don't think it has anything to do with my S3 bucket, but I suppose it could be that as well.</p>

It runs, but it fails to do the ""HAVING row_number = 1"" part, so I'm getting all the records, instead of just the first record from each group.  A quick description of the query: it is finding hotel deals with various criteria, and in particular, priortizing them being paid, and then picking the one with the highest dealrank.  So, if there are paid deal(s), it'll take the highest one of those (by dealrank) first, if no paid deals, it takes the highest dealrank unpaid deal for each hotel.  Using MAX(dealrank) or something similar does not work as a way to pick off the first row of each hotel group, which is why I have the enclosing temptable and the creation of the row_number column.  Note, this query works correctly when run directly in MySQL. Here's the query:</p>

<pre><code>
SELECT *, 
       @num := if(@hid = hotel_id, @num + 1, 1) as row_number,
       @hid := hotel_id as dummy
  FROM (
    SELECT hotel_deals.*, affiliates.cpc,

      FROM hotel_deals 
      INNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id = hotel_deals.hotel_id  
      LEFT OUTER JOIN affiliates ON affiliates.id = hotel_deals.affiliate_id 
      WHERE ((hotel_deals.percent_savings >= 0) AND 
             (hotel_deals.booking_deadline >= ?))   
      GROUP BY hotel_deals.hotel_id, paid DESC, hotel_deals.dealrank ASC) temptable 
  HAVING row_number = 1

<p>I'm currently using Rails' find_by_sql to do this, although I've also tried putting it into a regular find using the :select, :from, and :having parts (but :having won't get used unless you have a :group as well).  If there is a different way to write this query, that'd be good to know too.</p>

<p>Trying to grab the Chat History between 2 users on my OpenFire server and I read that I plugin was needed to do this.</p>

      &lt;/set&gt;
   &lt;/retrieve&gt;
&lt;/iq&gt;

<p>In code, this is achieved via the following:</p>

<pre><code>NSXMLElement *iQ = [NSXMLElement elementWithName:@""iq""];
[iQ addAttributeWithName:@""type"" stringValue:@""get""];
[iQ addAttributeWithName:@""id"" stringValue:@""page1""];

NSXMLElement *retrieve = [NSXMLElement elementWithName:@""retrieve""];
[retrieve addAttributeWithName:@""xmlns"" stringValue:@""urn:xmpp:archive""];

NSXMLElement *set = [NSXMLElement elementWithName:@""set""];
[set addAttributeWithName:@""xmlns"" stringValue:@""http://jabber.org/protocol/rsm""];
NSXMLElement *max = [NSXMLElement elementWithName:@""max""];
max.stringValue = @""100"";
[set addChild:max];

[retrieve addChild:set];
[iQ addChild:retrieve];

[[[self appDelegate] xmppStream] sendElement:iQ];
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns the following error:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;iq xmlns=""jabber:client"" type=""error"" id=""page1"" to=""username@server.com""&gt;

&lt;/iq&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My Xcode project can successfully send/receive messages to the user I'm trying to receive chat history from so I really don't know what I'm doing wrong. Also the Plugin enables me to search through Chat Messages (via OpenFire admin) with successful results so it seems to be working and storing the messages.</p>

<p>It looks like this</p>

<pre><code># My project | @home
- Do this this | @home

<p>I think sync this file across my devices and use tasker / grep on android to show me the todo based on where I am.</p>

<pre><code>- Do this thing in the future | @home @2014-02-01

<p>How could I exclude that line until the date is 2014-02-01?
My current command for just extract @home todos is</p>

<pre><code>grep -e ""@home"" myfile | cut -d '|' -f1

Using C++, I would like to start a thread from a void method and then return before the thread may have finished. For example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;thread&gt;
using namespace std;

void longFunc(){
  //stuff
}

void startThread(){
  thread t(longFunc);
}

int main(void){
  startThread();
  //lots of stuff here...
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the <strong><code>startThread()</code></strong> finishes, t tries to be deleted, and fails. How can I do this? </p>

<p>generally the code works fine;
the product is displayed
I can select to buy 
login request </p>

<p>then as per the code above the download works and is processed (moved to the Document directory).</p>

<p>However, if i finishTransaction in updatedTransactions then the download will not occur. (makes sense!)</p>

<p>if I call [self completeTransaction:transaction] to finishTransaction from updatedTransactions I get the same.</p>

<p>If i neglect to call completeTransaction (as per the code) then content is downloaded but then I can't seem to call finish transaction.</p>

<p>where/how do I call finish transaction?</p>

<p>so close but so far!!!</p>

<p>I'm finding that it's actually working a little too well.  Because of the pattern ""example.com"", I'm seeing that it's now redirecting to our live site on dev and staging because our URLS are laid out like so : dev.example.com &amp; staging.example.com.  For the time being, I have just commented out the rewrite on these other web.configs but I'm wondering if there's a better pattern or option to get around this issue.</p>

This is because when the <code>viewDidLoad</code> method is called, the table has not been completely loaded, so I need that extra scroll in <code>viewDidAppear</code>. This code makes the trick. However, what I want is not an animated scroll (setting <code>animated</code> to <code>NO</code> does not solve this), I want the table to be displayed always from the bottom, not load the table and then go to the last row. </p>

 $debtor_id_invoice=$_POST['debtor_id_invoice'];</p>

<p>My whole point is,
I do get the dropdown list with correct values extracted from SQL. But I'm not quite sure how to store the selected value in the POST information. Because at the minute my variable stays empty. (I did a double check to echo the variable to see if it was really empty).</p>

<p>Can anybody point towards a solution to store the dropdown selection in the POST variable?
(Been googling but probably on the wrong values or something, I'm stuck :-S)</p>

I don't understand if there is some class which implements ILaunchConfigurationDelegate that I can extend to automatically launch my .bat (or in general, to launch a program!).</p>

<p>Have you any hint, or is there some simple example about implementing an external tool that simply launches a .bat (or program in general), using Eclipse launching API?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Marco</p>

<p>at first I thought it might be some crazy XSS filter, but even setting the second parameter false doesn't affect this, and doing a $_POST doesn't either so what the heck is up with this issue?</p>

<p><strong>To reproduce</strong>
You can test it yourself by going to <a href=""http://e-%C3%B8nsker.dk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://e-ønsker.dk</a> and then click ""Tilføj ønske"" - if you then click the link-chain icon to the left, insert a URL and hit the ""GEM"" (save) button you will see both the ajax post and response, and the response is simply an output of $this->input->post()</p>

<p>I want use this array to calculate FFT energy , but these numbers doesn't looks like a complex number ..
I want write a function like this :</p>

<pre><code>def get_energy(input):
  energy = 0
  for e in input:
    energy = energy + sqrt(pow(e.real,2)+pow(e.imag,2))
  return energy

I use a linked list to store data for threads to pick and process. A node is a simple <code>typedef</code> </p>

<pre><code>struct QueueNode;

typedef struct QueueNode {
    struct QueueNode* next; // pointer to the next node
    void* data;
} QueueNode;
</code></pre>

<p>The list </p>

<pre><code>typedef struct LinkedQueue {
    QueueNode* head;   // pointer to the first Node
    QueueNode* tail;   // pointer to the last Node
    long long k;       // the number of nodes in the queue
} LinkedQueue;
</code></pre>

<p>Both are initialized by corresponding functions that use <code>malloc</code>. When a thread needs data to process it calls one function that pops the head of the queue and returns the <code>void* data</code> pointer. </p>

<pre><code>void* pop_data(LinkedQueue* queue) {
    /*
     Pops the head node from a queue, extracts data out of it and
     frees the memory allocated by that node
     */
    assert(queue-&gt;head &amp;&amp; ""Can't pop data from an empty queue"");

    void* data = queue-&gt;head-&gt;data;            // extract data from head
    QueueNode* old_head_pointer = queue-&gt;head;
    queue-&gt;head = queue-&gt;head-&gt;next;           // replacing head with a new one
    destroy_node(old_head_pointer);            // destroying the old head

    return data;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is that <code>destroy_node</code> is supposed to free the memory allocated for the node without destroying the <code>void* data</code> pointer, because the data are used later. This is were my case becomes different. All the examples I've already read described a case of completely freeing everything inside a node, while I need to save that one pointer.  </p>

<pre><code>void destroy_node(QueueNode* node) {
    /*
     Frees memory allocated by a node.
     */
    free(node-&gt;next);
    free(node);
};
</code></pre>

<p>In my tests this works fine, but since I know that <code>free()</code> doesn't actually erase the piece of memory and since my machine has tons of memory the fact that I can still access that <code>void* data</code> pointer without any segmentation errors can't be relied on. So the question basically is am I doing this right or are my concerns really reasonable? If this indeed might lead to memory leaks or other memory-related problems, how am I supposed to do this stuff?</p>

<p>I was able to send a very small data set by utilizing the method discussed at <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2008/04/17/wcf-raw-programming-model-web.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2008/04/17/wcf-raw-programming-model-web.aspx</a>, which explains how to utilize a ""RAW"" programming model to send the response -- I'm using the MemoryStream class.</p>

<pre><code>public Stream ReturnCSVSample()
{
    string csv = ""Hello, World\nGoodBye, For, Now\n"";
    byte[] csvBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(csv);

    WebOperationContext.Current.OutgoingResponse.ContentType = ""text/csv"";

    return new MemoryStream(csvBytes);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine.  However, in reality, I'm retrieving about 144,000 records from a SQL database table, two columns wide, and using string concatenation to format it into CSV.  Then, I take this string,encode it as a bytes array and return it as a MemoryStream object.  I let the service run for over 20 minutes and it still does not finish!  I've determined the bottleneck is the string concatenation.  Why?  Because I performed the operation of retrieving these 144,000 records and storing it to a class I created and it took a few minutes, at most, to complete.</p>

<p>Either a string that large is inefficient or there is a better method to perform string concatenation for the amount of records I specified.</p>

<p>How can I send a CSV stream over a web service with such as a large data set?</p>

I am pulling data from a camera into an app using WIA 2.0 on a windows 7 machine using c#. The problem involves the timestamp. I don't want to transfer the image until I check if its timestamp is within a range. Here is the chopped down important part of the code. The sample here is from my test harness where I just do everything in one fell swoop, not from the real code. Again, I can make everything work fine if I ignore time, but that isn't an option.</p>

<pre><code>WIA.DeviceManager devMgr = new WIA.DeviceManager();  
foreach (DeviceInfo info in devMgr.DeviceInfos)   
{  
   if (info.Type == WiaDeviceType.CameraDeviceType) //grab the first camera   
   {   
     cameraDevice = info.Connect();   
     break;   
   }   
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Here there is a loop of i items in the camera (each item is a pic at this point)   </p>

<pre><code>WIA.Item item = cameraDevice.Items[i];    
timestamp = item.Properties.get_Item(""Item Time Stamp"").get_Value().ToString();

<p>I am looking for a solution to do the following: <br>
Have a dropdown containing a list of existing regions (Bundesland).
If I find my region in that list, select from the dropdown and I am fine. <br>
If I do not find my region, I need to manually type in a new region into a text field. This will create a new entry in the database as well. <br>
To have this userfriendly and easy to use without switching between fields, I prefer to have this in one field if possible.</p>

<p>Here is the code for my actual dropdown, but without any option for 
free-text and manual input. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;
= ai3.input :area_id, label: ""Bundesland/Kanton"", :as =&gt; :select, :collection =&gt; option_groups_from_collection_for_select( @area_countries_dach, :area_regions, :name, :id, :name)
</code></pre>

<p>Now this needs to be expanded to a combination of a select-box (dropdown) and a free-text input field.</p>

<p>It would be great to have the user typing into the field the beginning chars for the region. if found, select by click or leaving the field. If not found use the already typed chars for the creation of the new region.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to solution this?
Thanks.</p>

<p>On a <code>click</code> of a <code>button</code> I wish a menu (via a <code>ul</code>) to hide if it's open, or show if it's closed, so I chose to use the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/toggle/"" rel=""nofollow"">toggle</a> function in it's most basic form, on <code>click</code>, <code>toggle()</code>. Simple as that, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>button.click =&gt;
  autocomplete = input_field.data(""ui-autocomplete"")
  menu = autocomplete.menu
  ul = menu.element
  ul.toggle()
</code></pre>

<p>(it's coffeescript, but you get the gist)</p>

<p>What actually happens is that when the <code>ul</code> is displayed at first (not via the button) it has <strike>display property set</strike> the display property set to <code>display: block</code>.</p>

<p>Then, on first click of the button if I check within the click function what the current status of the display property is via:</p>

<pre><code>console.log ""display = #{ul.css('display')}""
ul.toggle()
console.log ""display = #{ul.css('display')}""
</code></pre>

<p>the output is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>display = none<br>
  display = block  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for some reason the property is being incorrectly picked up initially.</p>

<p><strike>it adds the display property as <code>display: block</code> and then on the next click sets <code>display: none</code>.</strike></p>

<p>I'm not in control of the <code>ul</code> directly as it is rendered by the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete"" rel=""nofollow"">autocomplete widget</a> and I'm not keen on having to fiddle about with that.</p>

<p>Is this expected behaviour, and what is the best way to work around this? I'm thinking of passing a function to <code>click</code> that checks if there is a display attr set and then show or hide dependent on that, but if there's an easier way or better function, maybe a newer version of toggle, then please let me know. The jQuery docs are, in my view, some of the worst of any tech project so I consider it quite likely that I'm using the wrong function entirely.</p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>

I mention this because I've noticed that you can style a specific activity. I actually don't see a way to force have multiple ""wigets"" have their own ""theme"" while they all exist on the same activity. </p>

<p>Please advise if so then I my need to make my ""little creations"" as whatever ""fragment"" or ""wigets"".

<p>So regarding the style xml file,   I've read that,,, its important that,,,, my parent be some all encompassing Android theme and I override individual ""properties"" in this section::  </p>

<p>Could that mean that although I'm concerned with text size, since I have labels and editcontrols present the absence of a ""parent"" style that addresses these will cause me an error as I attempt to use this referenced parent style ??

<p>In the first case, most of tottime is spent in ""string:1(module)"", which is, to my understanding, the way the profiler tells ""I'm in the string statement you gave me"".
The second case however, shows more specifically the time spent in ""pow""</p>

<p>I thought pow and ** were equivalents, ** being simply syntactic sugar, and ** was actually calling pow. It's not the case ? Or cProfile does not display built-in operators unless specified in some option ? </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>EDIT :
I understand that the profiler showing all the time spent in ""+"", ""-"" etc... is not desired behavior. My question is more about where this distinction come from : Is it because pow and ** are intrinsically different ? or because cProfile is treating them differently ?</p>

<p>The code is called via 2 identical methods as the one above (2 different XML files to download from different URIs). Both methods are called in a sequence when the Windows Phone page loads. Sometimes when I'm am on a bad wireless connection it tends to take a while to download. 
I was wondering, how would I be able to check if the HttpWebRequest has finished downloading the files and initiate a ProgressBar until it was finished downloading?
Do you maybe suggest a different approach to the problem?</p>

<p>EDIT - Additional info:
The reason why I would need to have a progress bar is because the data is needed in order for the user to advance. If the user would try to advance in the application and he was on a bad wireless connection and the data was still downloading, the method would of course return null. Thus the progress bar would lock the user out of the app until it finished downloading.</p>

<p>The first two items (Households &amp; Municipality) are always present, the subsequent items - there may be any number of them (minimum one).</p>

<p>I can generate this by using a <code>List&lt;dynamic&gt;</code> object on the server. However, when I upload to the shared hosting environment, I get the error:
<code>The 'ObjectContent' type failed to serialize the response body for content type 'application/json; charset=utf-8'.</code> with innerException <code>""Request for the permission of type 'System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' failed.""</code></p>

<p>I can't change the trustlevel in web.config to full, because the host company has locked that down. </p>

<p>I thought this is because a dynamic object needs reflection to check the property names (other webapi calls returning POCOs work fine). </p>

<p>So I tried changing it from a <code>List&lt;dynamic&gt;</code> object to a <code>List&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;</code> - but I still get the same error.</p>

<p>Is there a workaround to creating this 'dynamic' object without needing reflection to serialize it? </p>

I want to combine the two into one range into a different column. I am assuming that this will have to be implemented in vba... however, I have been having minimal luck. I have values that indicate what row number I want to make my ranges within my worksheet. I've tried making VBA macros, but I have been having no luck.

"7543612","1","","","2011-09-25 04:13:32","","1","989","<p>I am trying to solve a network flow problem by C++ multithreading. </p>

<p>Given a network (all nodes are connected by arcs, each arc is connected to 2 and only 2 ending nodes, one is input node and another is output node, each node can have multiple input arcs and output arcs), each node needs to do some computing and then exchange 
computing result data to its connected input and output nodes. </p>

<p>Multiple nodes can be grouped into one task, which is run by one thread. In this way, the 
whole network computing workload can be partitioned into multiple tasks. All these tasks 
are pushed into a boost thread pool such that all threads can run the tasks at the same 
time. </p>

<p>But, if a node (in a thread task) needs to do data exchange with another node (in another 
thread task), there is a synchronization problem. Data receiver needs to wait for data 
available in the data buffer of the data sender. </p>

<p>My proram needs to partition the network such that each thread's task workload is assigned 
as evenly as possible.
If all threads share the one-large data buffer structure, the program parallelism is not 
good because the critical section is too large. Some threads have to wait the the 
one-large data buffer structure unlocked even though the part of the data structure (which 
is useful to them ) has been available for read or write. </p>

<p>For example, the one-large data buffer structure has the following buffer cells: 
cell1 , cell2,  cell3 , cell4. </p>

<p>When thread 1 is trying to write cell 1, it must lock the whole  data buffer structure so 
that thread 2 cannot read or write cell 2 and so on. </p>

<p>So, I want to break the one-large data buffer structure into multiple distinct data cells 
according to the thread number so that each cell holds the data only needed by one thread 
task. </p>

<p>For example, if we have 2 threads, we create 2 data cells that hold data needed by the 4 
thread separately. 
If we have 4 threads, we create 4 data cells that hold data needed by the 4 thread separately. 
and so on. </p>

<p>My questions are: </p>

<p>(1) How to design the data cell ? You can see that its size is based on the number of threads. </p>

<p>(2) How to reduce synchronization overhead ? The critical section is small but the 
overhead of geting and releasing mutex may be very high if the inter-node data exchange frequency is high. </p>

<p>(3) When a node's computing is done and data is written to its cell how to notify the data 
receiver node such that the notification messgae is only received by the waiting thread 
that run the receiver node computing task. All other unrelated nodes and threads are not 
impacted. </p>

<p>The program is very time-sensitive and the latency of message exchange should be 
controlled very toughly and reduced as much as possible. </p>

<p>Any help is really appreciated. </p>

[controller dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}
</code></pre>

<p>But what I want to do is set the recipient and message to an NSUserDefaults string. This is what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *messageNumbers = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@""phoneNumber""];
NSString *textMessage = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@""messageText""];
[self sendSMS:textMessage recipientList:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:messageNumbers, nil]];
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of the usual popup message composer, it hangs for a moment and then the screen goes black so you have to quit the app. The console gives me this:</p>

<pre><code>2013-10-27 17:29:45.428 *APP*[4006:60b] &lt;CKSMSComposeRemoteViewController: 0x1844fb90&gt; timed out waiting for fence barrier from com.apple.mobilesms.compose

</code></pre>

<p>Can somebody please tell me what i've done wrong or whether I need to use different code?</p>

<p>The Accordion works fine in Explorer and Firefox. 
However, in <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Opera</strong> and <strong>Safari</strong> the border of the ""js_button"" gets highlighted once you click on it.
Furthermore, when you want click on the last accordion (in this case ""Part2"") the animation of the content (in this case ""Content2"") is not working correctly because the border-lines are ""drawn"" slowly by the browser.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how to solve this issue with the highlighting and the border animation?</p>

<p>I send ""TEXT\n"" to the serial while in the limits of the timeout and i have ""String read from serial port : TEXT"" appearing on the terminal copy in gtkterm followed by ""running etc/profile"". Like i said before i suspect the fact that i am using the serial with gtkterm at the same time i send the string but i must have it working to use the board and i would like your opinion on this issue.</p>

    mSeekBar.setProgress(progress);
</code></pre>

<p>2) Adding the following lines to the <code>setValue()</code> method:</p>

        mProgress = value;
        mSeekBar.setProgress(mProgress);
        notifyChanged();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Alas this does not work, the progress of the <code>mSeekBar</code> stays at 0.</p>

<p>Also, there is a <a href=""https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/preference/SeekBarPreference.java"" rel=""nofollow"">SeekBarPreference by Google</a> - but I don't understand how it works there (or if it works at all).</p>

However often these apps occasionally need to access each other's models, so I was thinking of ""externalizing"" my models so that they can be accessed more elegantly from any app. So the idea is to do have directory structure resembling something like this:</p>

+ models

<p>Is there a functional point to doing that (other than code maintainability), since the applications can cross-reference each other? </p>

"6802256","1","6802513","","2011-07-23 17:58:57","","0","788","<p>I've got a DialogPreference (more precisely an EditTextPreference) and want to perform some checks on the value the user has input. These checks shall be made when the user clicks ok, not already while he is typing. If everything is ok, the dialog shall close. If there is an error, an AlertDialog shall appear with an explanation what is wrong and an ok-button. This AlertDialog shall come into view ""on top of"" the DialogPreference's dialog, and when the ok-button is clicked, the first dialog shall come into view again.</p>

<p>I tried to extend EditTextPreference and override the onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) method to do this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
    boolean invalidData = false;
    // check input
    if (true) {
        invalidData = true;
    }
    if (which == DialogInterface.BUTTON_POSITIVE &amp;&amp; invalidData) {
        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(getContext());
        builder.setMessage(""Some message."")
        .setCancelable(false)
        .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {
                dialog.cancel();
            }
        }).create().show();
        //super.showDialog(new Bundle());
    } else {
        super.onClick(dialog, which);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this does not have the desired effect:</p>

<ul>
<li>With the code above, the AlertDialog is shown and the value is not
saved when the EditTextPreference's positive button is clicked, but
the EditTextPreference's dialog is immediately closed.</li>
<li>If super.showDialog(new Bundle()); is uncommented, the AlertDialog<br>
is shown and above it immediately also the EditTextPreference's<br>
dialog pops up again.</li>
</ul>

<p>So how can I reach the desired behaviour?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As according to hackbod this is not possible, I will use a solution that gets close. This is far from a good user experience, but as my app will be used by less than 100 people and I develop this in my spare time, I don't want to put too much effort in it - like creating my own DialogPreference.

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include ""tstr.h""
using namespace std;

//Default constructor to initialize the string to null
TStr::TStr() {
    strPtr = 0;
    strSize = 0;
}  
//constructor; conversion from the char string
TStr::TStr(const char *str) {
    int i=0;
    while (str[i] != '/0') {
        strPtr = new char [strlen(str)+1];
        for (i=0; i &lt;strSize;++i) {
            strPtr[i] = str[i];
        }
        ++i;
    }
    strSize = i;
} 
//Copy constructor
TStr::TStr(const TStr&amp;) {
}
//Destructor
TStr::~TStr() {
    if (strPtr) {
        delete[] strPtr;
    }
}

//subscript operators-checks for range
char&amp; TStr::operator [] (int i) {
    assert (i &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; i &lt; strSize);
    return strPtr[i];
}
const char&amp; TStr::operator [] (int i) const {
    assert (i &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; i &lt; strSize);
    return strPtr[i];
}

//overload the concatenation oprerator
TStr TStr::operator += (const TStr&amp; str) {
    //this-&gt;strPtr += str.strPtr;
    //this-&gt;strSize += str.strSize;
    return *this;
}
//overload the assignment operator
const TStr&amp; TStr::operator = (const TStr&amp; str) {
    if (this != &amp;str) {
        delete[] strPtr;
        strPtr = new char[strSize = str.strSize];
        assert(strPtr);
        for (int i=0; i&lt;strSize; ++i) {
            strPtr[i] = str.strPtr[i];
        }
    }
    return *this;
}

//overload two relational operators as member functions

}
bool TStr::operator &lt; (const TStr&amp; str) const {

}
//the length of the string
int TStr::size() {
    return strSize;
}

<p>Thanks for any replies/help! :)</p>

<p>EDIT 1: Okay the constructor is now working but I am still getting a runtime error and I'm 90% sure it is to do with my overloaded += operator. It looks fine though and compiles okay. What am I missing? </p>

<p>(Note: Only small changes have been made to the above code, but let me know if you want to see the whole lot.)</p>

<pre><code>//overload the concatenation oprerator
TStr TStr::operator += (const TStr&amp; str) {
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; strSize; ++i) {
        strPtr[i] += str.strPtr[i];
    }
    return *this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT 2: Okay this what I have now. Compiles fine but doesn't actually add the two strings together with the += like it should. Anyone got any ideas? </p>

<pre><code>//overload the concatenation oprerator
TStr TStr::operator += (const TStr&amp; str) {
    char *buffer = new char[strSize + str.strSize + 1];
    strcpy(buffer, strPtr);
    strcat(buffer, str.strPtr);
    delete [] strPtr;
    strPtr = buffer;
    return *this;
}

//overload the assignment operator
const TStr&amp; TStr::operator = (const TStr&amp; str) {
    if (this != &amp;str) {
        delete[] strPtr;
        strPtr = new char[strSize = str.strSize];
        assert(strPtr);
        for (int i=0; i&lt;strSize; ++i) {
            strPtr[i] = str.strPtr[i];
        }
    }
    return *this;
}

<p>I have a dataframe that I am filtering in multiple ways (within a shiny app in case it matters).  This leads to often no observations of the group I am coloring data points by being present in the resulting filtered dataframe.   This obviously results in different colors appearing in different plots which is confusing.</p>

<p>Is there a way, when doing multiple filters on the same df, to always ensure the same color for each level of the factor/group ?     </p>

<p>One trick that has worked in ggplot before has been to add one NA observation to the end of the dataframe for each factor level.  At first glance, this works ok as the colors are back in the right order, but notice the rogue data point in the top left !</p>

<pre><code>dfvis1 &lt;- rbind(dfvis, data.frame(x=NA, y=NA, mygroup=""A""))

<p>It looks like my dev site itself works fine, using the development settings. But although the tests seem to load the settings OK (both defaults and development) <code>settings.DEBUG</code> is set to <code>False</code>. I don't know why, or whether that's the cause of the problem. </p>

I want to be able to track when a download is completed (i.e. the file has been fully downloaded to the user's computer) and then invoke a Google Analytics script that reports a completed download as a 'Goal' (obviously, one of my goals is to increase file downloads).</p>

<p>The problem is that I need to support direct file URLs, as opposed to the ""redirect page"" solution. This is because a lot of traffic comes from software download sites that explicitly demand a direct file URL when submitting a product. Perhaps, they do their own file analysis (i.e.  virus checking). But with this set of limitations, a typical scenario is:</p>

<ol>
<li>The user visits my product listing on a software download site</li>
<li>The user clicks the ""Download"" button on this site</li>
<li>The ""Download"" page is typically a redirect that finally brings the user to my file via the direct URL I've initially submitted, i.e. <code>http://www.ko-sw.com/somefile.exe</code></li>
</ol>

<p>If under these conditions, an exact solution for monitoring is not possible, maybe there exists a workaround? What comes to my mind is temporarily storing the number of performed downloads on the server and then accessing an administrative page that somehow reports this number to Google Analytics and finally sets it back to zero. With this workaround, there is at least no need to try to attach a javascript handler to a non-HTML resource. But even then there are issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to track if a download has completed?</li>
<li>How to track user geolocation and browser capabilities to make them further visible in the reports?</li>

<ol>
<li><p>I can clone it and push in it via ssh auth with private and public
keys (on gentoo), but windows users which are using Git Extensions
can not. SSH keys placed in $HOME/.ssh, and ssh asks for a password.
Nor password, nor passphrase (from private ssh key) don't match.</p></li>
<li><p>Redmine needs for a bare repo, so i cloned repo from gitosis on my
local machine and moved it to server (redmine + git), then tried to
sync like showed here
<a href=""http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/HowTo_keep_in_sync_your_git_repository_for_redmine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/HowTo_keep_in_sync_your_git_repository_for_redmine</a>
But it asks for a password again! Of course I didn't make apache his
own ssh keys to auth gitosis =_= (Apache is owner of redmine bare
repo, cause it access it through http auth)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway the question is how to use private ssh key from file when accessing to gitosis?</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>Partially solved!
<code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code> generates keys, which names are exactly <strong>id_rsa</strong> and <strong>id_rsa.pub</strong>. 
if you run <code>ssh -vvv gitosis@your-server.com</code> you should see something similar to</p>

<pre><code>debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,keyboard-interactive
…
debug3: authmethod_is_enabled publickey
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Offering RSA public key: user@domain-user
debug3: send_pubkey_test
debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,keyboard-interactive
debug1: Trying private key: /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
debug3: no such identity: /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Trying private key: /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa
debug3: no such identity: /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: Trying private key: /home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa
debug3: no such identity: /home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa
debug2: we did not send a packet, disable method
debug3: authmethod_lookup keyboard-interactive
</code></pre>

<p>So, ssh client wants exactly named files or will switch to next auth method (password). Now i renamed keys on my home machine and:</p>

<pre><code>user@home ~ $ git clone ssh://git@your-gitosis-server/reponame.git
Cloning into reponame...
Enter passphrase for key '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa':
</code></pre>

<p>Hurray, it asks for a <em>passphrase</em>! BTW, ШIИDOШS™ users are still having problems with their tens of generated keys.</p>

<p><strong>Upd</strong></p>

<p>If you use OpenSSH, then in ~/.ssh you may create a file named ‘config’ and put there something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Host mygitosisserver.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private-key-for-mygitosisserver-com

<p>One partial page that renders inside the <strong>#content</strong> div is for a user's <strong>Profile</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""profile.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;input type=""file"" name=""profile-picture""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The contents of <strong>profile.js</strong> are similar to:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('input').change(function() {
        // upload profile picture asynchronously
    });
});
</code></pre>

<h2>User settings</h2>

<p>Another partial page that is loaded inside the <strong>#content</strong> div of the <strong>master template</strong> is the user's <strong>Settings</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""settings.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""first-name""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""last-name""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The contents of <strong>settings.js</strong> are similar to:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    setInterval(function() {
        // auto-submit form every 10 seconds
        $('form').submit();
    }, 10000);
}
});
</code></pre>

<h2>The problems</h2>

<ul>
<li>Certain <em>javascript</em> functions continue to run (e.g. <strong>setInterval</strong>) after the partial page that called them has been replaced by another.</li>
<li>This business of loading new <em>javascript</em> for each partial page feels messy; but for the life of me, I can't find any recommendations for best practices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the better way to achieve this effect of dynamic partial-page loading/unloading while allowing page-specific scripts for each partial page?</strong></p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

I need to call a method that will execute when the user completes the search in the AutoCompleteBox either by keyboard or mouse.  The first solution I thought about was using the keyDown and MouseDown, that seems more work.  Putting logic to determine if a valid option is picked for both keyboard and mouse.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

<p>Edit:
With @elgonzo advice tried the SelectionChanged event.  The issue is when the user ""arrows down"" the list.  So for example say the user typed something in, saw the desired results 3 down in the list and uses the down arrow key.  The user would hit the down arrow key 3 times, this would result in the event firing 3 times. </p>

The problem is that it doesn't occur every time.</p>

<p>I'm using :active_record_store as a session storage in rails 3.2.9</p>

<p>To configure session_store I've added such line to /config/initializers/session_store.rb</p>

<pre><code>PublicRor::Application.config.session_store :active_record_store

<p>I've had to use this kind of storage, because 4KB limit for cookie storage was too small for me.</p>

<p>Sample use case:</p>

<p>I'm storing data in session like this:</p>

<pre><code>session[:some_key] = ""some value""
</code></pre>

<p>And sometimes on next page views this this key doesn't occur (session contains various values, but not :some_key). 
The only solution to this problem that I've found is to clean sessions table manually (from sqlite browser), but guess that there're more clever ways :)</p>

<p>Is that is capacity of sessions array? Maybe it's getting overflowed?</p>

This other program could be another executable, or a script, and could take any number of command line parameters. We've built a GUI to do this and, in the basic functional case, it works.</p>

<p>We're using apache exec to do this, though at this point I'm not actually sure what value its giving us.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is with known script file types.</p>

<p>If you open powershell and type <code>./myVisualBasicScript.vbs</code> it will, internally, translate that into the command something like <code>wscript.exe ./myVisualBasicScript.vbs</code>. Similarly, iirc, in bash if you type <code>./someTCShellScript.tcsh</code>, it will invoke that script under tcshell.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there's a library that will provide this mapping for me. Ideally this library is one where I could do something like</p>

<pre><code>CommandLine cmd = new com.awesome.library.CommandLine(
    pathToExecutableOrScript,
    args
);

cmd.execute();
</code></pre>

<p>It would be nice if such a library sported watchdogs and timeouts and signal handling etc, but the main feature I'm looking for is some kind of method to map from file types (preferably using both extensions and meta properties) to the executable that runs them.</p>

<p>I've been building a map inside our application, and I'm at least aware of javas <code>java.awt.Desktop.open()</code> method, which almost does this job for me, though its more tailored toward GUI'd applications. I'm not sure if it has the facilities to capture standard in, out, and error, or have watchdogs and timeouts, etc.</p>

Obviously the words (characters) are different in width. One functionality of the App is to replace random words in the text with hyphens. Currently, length of each line is similar in size and properly aligned and it should be always. So, the issue is, whenever I replace any word with hyphen, the length and alignment of the line is getting messed up. One solution is, we have to give a hyphen which is similar in word width. So can we change size of hyphen dynamically? Or can we do anything with underline by setting its color black and words color as background color say white (then it will be invisible)? Or any other solution to achieve this? Thanks in advance.</p>

I wanted to change this to be defined in a new layout, so I wrote this (it is named display_message.xml):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

    &lt;TextView android:id=""@+id/text_view""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" /&gt;


&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in the DisplayMessage class, I changed it to this:</p>

<pre><code>public class DisplayMessage extends Activity {

        @Override
        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
        {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        // Get the text view
        TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.text_view);
        textView.setText(message);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>However, Eclipse says that it doesn't know what <code>R.layout.display_message</code> is, nor does it know what <code>R.id.text_view</code> is. Is there somewhere else I need to define them or something? Where did I mess up?</p>

<p>I have 2 activities (ActivityA, ActivityB). In ActivityA I have overridden the <code>onStop()</code> function and I change value X in a singleton. When I go to ActivityB and <code>onStart()</code> is called I check the value X. The problem is that <code>onStart()</code> is called before <code>onStop()</code> and the value I check in the <code>onStart()</code> function is still the old value before <code>onStop()</code> changes it.</p>

<p>I know why <code>onStart()</code> is called before <code>onStop()</code>. What I am asking you guys is an alternative solution to this problem I am currently having.</p>

<p>I need to save a value in ActivityA before I close it and I need to check for the same value in ActivityB. ActivityB can be accessed from several other activities not just ActivityA. And the otehr activities dont change the value.</p>

<p><strong>SOLVED</strong>
I changed onStop() to onPause() That worked. Thanks guys!</p>

<p>Within it I have a main label image at the top, and then some buttons underneath, the buttons change their images (animate) when mouse goes over them, but the main label image does so when mouse enters the main window altogether, and revert to off image when mouse leaves the app.</p>

<p>This is working just fine to a point.</p>

<p>When I move my mouse from main image to a button, or from a button to a button the program seems to think that I've actually left, and then re-entered the main window, which is clearly not the case. This malfunction causes the program to re-animate the main label each time this happens (which is often), thus producing an ugly-looking gui.</p>

<p>My theory is that the space between the buttons (1px wide for idk what reason it is there, but I can't get it to go away...) is actually read by the program as not being a piece of the main window, thus causing this problem.</p>

I tried to follow <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21381/Spell-Checking-Edit-Control-Using-HunSpell"" rel=""nofollow"">this codeproject tutorial</a> which is for Visual Studio 2008 and HunSpell 1.2.1.</p>

<p>I don’t want to use the provided code, since I intend to write my own.
Furthermore I want to add HunSpell as a dll, not as a static library.</p>

<p>Following are the steps I took:</p>

<ol>
<li>Created a Win32 console (empty) project with the name myproject.</li>
<li>Downloaded HunSpell 1.3.2 from SourceForge.org.</li>
<li>Copied <strong>hunspell-1.3.2\src\hunspell</strong> and <strong>win_api</strong> to <strong>myproject\myproject\HunSpell-Src</strong></li>
<li>Added and converted project libhunspell <strong>myproject\myproject\HunSpell-Src\win-api\libhunspell.vcproj</strong>
to the solution.</li>
<li>Made my debug build use debug_dll and my release build release_dll of libhunspell in the Configuration Manager.</li>
<li>Rebuilt the libhunspell project, <em>libhunspell.dll</em> is generated in debug_dll and release_dll folders respectively.</li>
<li>Made my console project depend on libhunspell. (Added reference to libhunspell)</li>
<li>Copied dictionary files en_US.aff &amp; en_US.dic to <strong>myproject\myproject\HunSpell-Dic</strong> after downloading them from SourceForge.org.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can’t figure out how/where to add the processor define HSPELLEDIT_DLL that is mentioned in the codeproject tutorial.</p>

<p>Following the steps listed under “To use the functionality from the class library in the console application” on <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235636%28v=VS.100%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a> didn’t changed the result.</p>

<p>I want to test it with a program like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include ""HunSpell-Src/win_api/hunspelldll.h""

using namespace std;

void main()
{
    void *spellObj = hunspell_initialize(""HunSpell-Dic\\en_us.aff"", ""HunSpell-Dic\\en_us.dic"");

    char str[60];

    cin &gt;&gt; str;

    int result = hunspell_spell(spellObj, str);

    if(result == 0)
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Spelling error!"";
    else
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Correct Spelling!"";

    hunspell_uninitialize(spellObject);
}

<p>Hunspell.hxx is present in myproject\myproject\HunSpell-Src\hunspell. IntelliSense marks the #include ""hunspell.hxx"" as an error while the tab hasn’t focus with the message “Error: cannot open source file hunspell.hxx”, but after giving  focus  to it the error disappears.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the relevant HTML:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""component container w100 noEdit"" id=""contentWrapper""&gt; 
&lt;div class=""component container w50"" id=""container1""&gt; 
   &lt;div class=""component text w50"" id=""text1""&gt; 
      Text1 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div class=""component container w25"" id=""container2""&gt; 
   Container2 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div class=""component container w25"" id=""container3""&gt; 
   Container3 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div class=""component container w25"" id=""container4""&gt; 
   Container4 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And the relevant JavaScript:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () { 
   //Add the Grab Bar to container components on the page. 
   $('.component').each(wrapComponentForEdit); 
   $('#contentWrapper').sortable(); 
   $('#contentWrapper').disableSelection(); 
}); 

var wrapComponentForEdit = function() 
{ 
   if (!$(this).hasClass('noEdit')) { 
      $(this).html('&lt;div class=""componentBorder""&gt;' + $(this).html() + '&lt;/div&gt;'); 
      $(this).prepend('&lt;div class=""grabBar_l""&gt;&lt;div class=""grabBar_r""&gt;&lt;div class=""grabBar""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'); 
      alert($(this).attr('id')); 
   } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The end result of this is that I see an alert pop up for container1, text1, container2, container3, container 4. And yet only the containers (not the text) end up with the visual changes that the $().each() is supposed to make. </p>

<p>Anyone have any idea what the heck is going on?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - A different way to do it, that still fails</strong></p>

<p>I tried this, with the same result:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {
    //Add the Grab Bar to container components on the page.
    var matched = $('.component');
    var componentCount = $(matched).size();
    for (i = 0; i &lt; componentCount; i++)
    {
    	wrapComponentForEdit($(matched).eq(i));
    }
    $('#contentWrapper').sortable({ handle: '.grabBarBit', tolerance: 'pointer'});
    $('#contentWrapper').disableSelection();
});

var wrapComponentForEdit = function(component)
{
    if (!$(component).hasClass('noEdit')) {
    	$(component).html('&lt;div class=""grabBar_l grabBarBit""&gt;&lt;div class=""grabBar_r grabBarBit""&gt;&lt;div class=""grabBar grabBarBit""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""componentBorder""&gt;' + $(component).html() + '&lt;/div&gt;');
    	alert($(component).attr('id'));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 2: Another alternate method, but this one works</strong></p>

<p>I tried another way of doing things, and this way it works.  However, the initial question still stands.  Judging by how this new way works, it seems to me that the DOM is being updated, but jQuery isn't updating with it, so it loses track of the child element.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {
    //Add the Grab Bar to container components on the page.
    var componentCount = $('.component').size();
    for (i = 0; i &lt; componentCount; i++)
    {
    	wrapComponentForEdit($('.component').eq(i));
    }
    $('#contentWrapper').sortable({ handle: '.grabBarBit', tolerance: 'pointer'});
    $('#contentWrapper').disableSelection();
});

var wrapComponentForEdit = function(component)
{
    if (!$(component).hasClass('noEdit')) {
    	$(component).html('&lt;div class=""grabBar_l grabBarBit""&gt;&lt;div class=""grabBar_r grabBarBit""&gt;&lt;div class=""grabBar grabBarBit""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""componentBorder""&gt;' + $(component).html() + '&lt;/div&gt;');

""2010-11-21""</p>

<p>So I am thinking about the DateListString comprehension ""comprehending"" to an existing list with ""-"" after the first and second element.</p>

<p>Any suggestions accompanied with concrete code samples much appreciated.</p>

I have 2 global variables:</p>

<p>And i have this code:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($cartasxml-&gt;children() as $child) {

<p>And at the end of foreach i do:</p>

<pre><code>$type="""";

<p>Both virtual machines have a NAT configuration, with the following port forwarding rules:</p>

<pre><code>PROTO    HOST    GUEST
TCP      40022   22
TCP      45432   5432
TCP      9999    9999
</code></pre>

<p>I can connect to both PostgreSQL instances just fine using PGAdmin III, both from the host and guest OS. The pgpool2 service also starts without errors, but I can't connect to it using either pgAdmin or psql. </p>

<p>This is what happens when I try to connect to pgpool using psql:</p>

<pre><code>psql -p 9999 -U postgres -h localhost dbname
psql: server closed the connection unexpectedly
        This probably means the server terminated abnormally before or while processing the request.
</code></pre>

<p>Both backends are defined in pgpool.conf:</p>

<pre><code>backend_hostname0 = 'localhost'
backend_port0 = '5432'
backend_data_directory0 = '/var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main'
backend_weight0 = 1
backend_flag0 = 'ALLOW_TO_FAILOVER'

backend_hostname1 = '192.168.7.25'
backend_port1 = '45432'
backend_data_directory1 = '/var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main'
backend_weight1 = 1
backend_flag1 = 'ALLOW_TO_FAILOVER'
</code></pre>

<p>In the same file, both replication_mode and load_balance_mode are set to true.</p>

<p>I believe there might be some configuration issue with pgpool because, when ran manually with debug flags enabled, I can see the backends are being picked:</p>

<p>The following <code>TableLayout</code> gives the correct behaviour :</p>

            android:paddingTop=""2dp"" /&gt;
    &lt;/TableRow&gt;
&lt;/TableLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>TableLayout</code> uses 3 columns, the last being the hack : the <code>strechColumns</code> property makes it take all available space, so the second <code>TextView</code> is always immediatly to the right of the first one.
The first <code>TextView</code> ellipsize correctly because of the <code>shrinkColumns</code> property.</p>

<p>However, I don't like the idea of using a <code>TableLayout</code> to achieve that.
Does anybody know a better way ?</p>

<p>Can you please explain the rules involved to obtain a correct answer of the above code (overloading and overriding in connection with templates, integral promotion, ...)? Is it valid? If the rules are too lengthy please provide literature pointers. The latest compilers disagree about the correct result. gcc-4.6 and icpc-12.1.0 claim ""11"" is the correct answer but VS2010 refuses to compile <code>d &lt;&lt; c;</code> due to ambiguities but accepts <code>d.operator&lt;&lt;( c );</code>. The latter outputs <code>1</code> iirc. So who's right and who's wrong?</p>

<p>For Example, if the search criteria is ""ABCD"", then both ""ABCD Co."" and ""XYX ABCD"" have identical Edit Distance. However I want to add weight to the fact that the initial parts of the first string matches the search criteria more closely than the second string.</p>

<p>One way of doing this might be to modify the insert/delete/replace costs to be higher at the beginning of the strings and lower towards the end. Does anyone have an example of a successful implementation of this? Is using Levenshtein distance still the best way to do what I am trying to achieve? Is my assumption of the approach accurate?</p>

                &lt;/itemtemplate&gt;
                &lt;/asp:repeater&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
       &lt;/itemtemplate&gt;
&lt;/asp:repeater&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The imperative code-behind looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
        SqlConnection cnn = new SqlConnection(""asdf"");
        SqlDataAdapter cmd1 = new SqlDataAdapter(""select * from tblNames"", cnn);
        DataSet ds = new DataSet();
        cmd1.Fill(ds, ""names"");
        SqlDataAdapter cmd2 = new SqlDataAdapter(""select * from tblThings"", cnn);
        cmd2.Fill(ds, ""things"");
        ds.Relations.Add(""myrelation"",
        ds.Tables[""names""].Columns[""id""],
        ds.Tables[""things""].Columns[NameID""]);
        parentRepeater.DataSource = ds.Tables[""names""];
        Page.DataBind();
        cnn.Close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>So that will set up the parent repeater, and the child repeater, and when the child repeater has an itemdatabound, the following happens which binds the gridview:</p>

<pre><code> public void getNestedData(Object Sender, RepeaterItemEventArgs e)
    {
        GridView subGridView = (GridView)e.Item.FindControl(""Grd"");
        DataRow rowView = (DataRow)e.Item.DataItem;
        Int32 key = (Int32)rowView[""id""];

        SqlConnection cnn = new SqlConnection(""asdf"");
        SqlDataAdapter cmd1 = new SqlDataAdapter(""select * from tblSubThings WHERE ThingID = "" + key, cnn);
        DataSet ds = new DataSet();
        cmd1.Fill(ds, ""subThings"");
        subGridView.DataSource = ds.Tables[""subThings""];

        TemplateField edit = new TemplateField();
        edit.ItemTemplate = new editGridViewTemplate(DataControlRowType.DataRow, ""edit"");
        subGridView.Columns.Add(edit);

        TemplateField Notes = new TemplateField();
        Notes.ItemTemplate = new GridViewTemplate3(DataControlRowType.DataRow, ""Notes"");
        Notes.HeaderTemplate = new GridViewTemplate3(DataControlRowType.Header, ""Notes"");
        Notes.EditItemTemplate = new NotesEditGridViewTemplate(DataControlRowType.DataRow, ""Notes"");
        subGridView.Columns.Add(Notes);

        subGridView.DataBind();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code all works fine. It shows gridview inside two repeaters, with an edit button. And when the edit button is fired, the gridview is supposed to go into edit mode (and use the EditItemTemplate). However, the gridview does not go into editmode when EditRecord is called. This is what EditRecord looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public void EditRecord(object sender, GridViewEditEventArgs e)
{
        GridView subGridView = (GridView)sender;
        subGridView.EditIndex = e.NewEditIndex;
        subGridView.Rows[e.NewEditIndex].RowState = DataControlRowState.Edit;
        DataBind();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know how I can get my GridView into edit mode?</p>

<p>The extension i have already set correct.
What i have done regarding the suggestet Points on the link:</p>

<p>Point 1: I have looked in  my cmake file and ffmpeg, libavutil etc is all chosen.</p>

<p>Point 2: I thought all files are installed automatically in usr/src if you don't change it, isn't it?</p>

<p>Point 3: It is a new installation. But btw. how can i deinstall the lib?</p>

<p>Point 4: Shouldn't be the problem.</p>

I have used socket module, SocketServer module and twisted. In each one I had different problems.</p>

<p>Using socket module I was getting more than one messages combined. I reduced the buffer size of the recv() function but I was then getting only one package and after that nothing.</p>

<p>Then I started using twisted. I was still getting the packages as a collection and not one by one. Moreover when a delay was inserted in C file my python script crashed.</p>

<p>Then i moved to SocketServer and I created a thread to run the server on. The messages were coming as I wanted to but I can no longer interact with the GUI.</p>

<p>All I want to do is send a string of 4 values to the Python script, strip it and the plot it, having an interactive UI and I can't find an example of server,matplotlib and wxPython collaboration.</p>

<p>My code-behind, where I call the web service:</p>

<pre><code>myServiceHandlerClient o = new myServiceHandlerClient();
// This WORKS:
string[] products = o.getproducts();
// This does NOT work, data is returned with all null fields:
ModisData data = o.getsubset(-34, 140, ""MCD12Q1"", ""LC_Property_1"", ""A2001001"", ""A2001001"", ""5"", ""5"");
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so from my research there can be a mismatch in namespace, but I cant find it. The namespace in the wsdl file and the namespace from the soap response are the same(that's why all other functions work). Also, I dont see any typo or anything wrong with the element names either.</p>

<p>What can be wrong here? Please help.</p>

<p>ps: I even tried to use WCF by adding service reference from visual studio to generate the proxy class. However, none of the functions work, they all return null.</p>

<p>I've already tried this:</p>

<pre><code>has_many :paragraphs
has_many :images

def items
   (self.paragraphs + self.images)
end
</code></pre>

<p>But then it isn't possible to order the objects by position.
Is there a method, that i can use, so it would be:
has_many :items, (combine here the 2 has_many relations).order(:position)</p>

<p>Thankyou!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Here's my complete setup:</p>

<pre><code>class Page &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :containers
end

class Container &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :paragraphs, -&gt; { order(:position) }, class_name: 'Content::Paragraph'
  has_many :images, -&gt; { order(:position) }, class_name: 'Content::Image'

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :paragraphs
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :images

  def items
    items = self.paragraphs + self.images
  end
end

class Content::Paragraph &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :container, class_name: 'Container'
end

class Content::Image &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :container, class_name: 'Container'
end
</code></pre>

<p>An container belongs to an page. </p>

<p>I want to show on a page all the items, so paragraphs + images and sort them by position.
Also the most Acts_as_list -ish gems are usable for single models and not for multiple models (my case). I think i need a parent model (reversed polymorphic association?) to easily get all the belonging items in correct order. </p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>Container:
  - Alinea (position 1)
  - Image (position 2)
  - Alinea (position 3)

<p><em>See <a href=""http://www.delphikingdom.com/asp/viewitem.asp?catalogid=453&amp;mode=print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.delphikingdom.com/asp/viewitem.asp?catalogid=453&amp;mode=print</a> and start with 3d listing to grasp the idea.</em></p>

<p>However having two inter-dependent INC-files in units' <code>interface</code> and <code>implementation</code> sections leads to troubles: seems like XE2 compiles those include files as independent units instead and implementation cannot find functions declared in interface. It does not happen every time, but i failed to determine the conditions and thus failed to make a workaround.</p>

<p>Trying to re-formulate this in Delphi generics unit with as little changes as possible (i had to move huge legacy project to XE2 and ""working"" should be 1st, optimizations and refactoring later), i stuck into the following pit:</p>

<pre><code>  TemplateList&lt;_DATA_TYPE_&gt; = class  
  public
    const MaxListSize = Maxint div (sizeof(Integer)*sizeof(_DATA_TYPE_));    
    type
      TIntList = array[0..MaxListSize - 1] of _DATA_TYPE_;   
      PIntList = ^TIntList;                                  
  private
    FList: PIntList;
    FCount: Integer;
</code></pre>

<p>This gives an error that Low-bound for <code>TIntList</code> is upper than High-bound. Which, i think, means that <code>const MaxListSize</code> is evaluated to zero, but the <code>TIntType</code> tries to be evaluated immediately, not when actually instantiating the type.</p>

<p>I wonder if XE3 or XE4 fixed this. And if there is a way to make this compile in XE2 without major re-working</p>

<p><em>PS. making the array 0..0 and suppressing bounds checking is usual solution, yet it make a lot of fragile non-checked code. Maybe i'd end up using real <code>TList</code> or <code>TList&lt;integer\&gt;</code> instead...</em></p>

<p>PPS. Funny thing, reformulating inner type with copy-paste</p>

<pre><code>TIntList = array[0..Maxint div (sizeof(Integer)*sizeof(_DATA_TYPE_)) - 1] of _DATA_TYPE_;
</code></pre>

<p>changes the error into ""const expression required"".</p>

<p>So the same expression is considered const-enough in one branch of compiler and non-const in another... I wonder if it constitutes an inconsistency bug per se.</p>

<p>I have used MFMailComposeViewController numerous times without issue, but always within a View Controller.</p>

<p>However, in this case, I make a call to an NSObject Class which will run, whilst the user is normally on one ViewController. However, this code is run from a number of View Controllers, hence the use of the NSObject, and my need to allow the composer to present over ANY view controller.</p>

<p>The issue is that when complete, it needs to throw up an email composer, and I am unable to get this to work. Instead, it never launches the Mail Composer view. </p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried to shift the code to AppDelegate, and use a notification from the NSObject class to fire the composer, however, using this method I find that the composer WILL display over a pushed VC, but if a modal view is currently displaying, it does NOT display the composer.</p>

<p>Finally, I tried adding an entirely separate view controller, adding the mail composer to it, and adding this via AppDelegate, but this too will only display over a pushed VC, and not a modal VC.</p>

<p>My thinking is that I need to find the 'top' of the navigation stack, in order to display the composer above this, but I am not 100% sure.</p>

<p>I would welcome comments from anyone who is able to throw any light on how I can achieve this, as I feel sure it must be possible, as I AM able to add the MailController to a modal view if the code is within the View Controller itself, but clearly this would mean I would need to add such said code to multiple VC's, which, whilst I could, seems to be an odd way to have to proceed.</p>

<p>The code is written in Java, but I guess this issue could happen in other languages such as C# as well.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, he suggested using a chain-of-responsibility pattern.
He proposed having a base ""Handler"" class. Then, ""Handler1"", ""Handler2"", etc. would extend ""Handler"".<br />
Then, handlers would have a ""getSuccessor"" method, which would either return null(if it was the last of the chain) or the next Handler of the chain.<br />
Then, a ""handleRequest(Request)"" function would either deal with Request, or pass it to the next of the chain and, if none of the previous solutions worked, it would return just null or throw an exception.<br />
To add a new Handler to the chain, the coder would go to the last element of the chain and tell it there was a new element. To do something, he'd just call handleRequest on the first element of the chain.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, I suggested using a different approach.<br />
I'd have a base ""Handler"" class as well, with ""Handler1"", ""Handler2"", just like the previous method mentioned.<br />
However, there would be no ""getSuccessor"" method. Instead, I'd have a Collection class with a list of handlers(a Vector, an ArrayList, or whatever is best in this case).<br />
The handleRequest function would still exist, but it wouldn't propagate the call to the next handlers. It would just process the request or return null.<br />
To handle a request, one would use</p>

<pre><code>for(Handler handle : handlers){
    result = handle.handleRequest(request);
    if(result!=null) return result;
}
throw new CouldNotParseRequestException(); //just like in the other approach
</code></pre>

<p>Or, to prevent code duplication, a ""parseRequest(request)"" method could be added to the collection class.
To add a new handler, one would go to the collection constructor(or static{} block, or something equivaleng) and simply add the code ""addHandler(new Handler3());"".</p>

<p>Exactly what advantages of chain-of-responsibility am I missing with this approach? Which method is best(assuming there <em>is</em> a best method)? Why? What potential bugs and issues can each design method cause?</p>

<p>For those who need context, here is what the original code looked like:</p>

<pre><code>if(x instanceof Type1)
{
//doSomething1
} else if(x instanceof Type2)
{
//doSomething2
}
//etc.
</code></pre>

The download failed for some reason and I got around the issue with a few searches around. Once I resolved the plugin issues, my application stopped to work. I tried a lot of things including re-installing STS. I was maintaining a GIT repository and I reverted all my changes to the last known working one. This did not help either. I created a new Grails project and copied all my source files over there and everything was working fine.</p>

<p>I compared all the build paths and properties files between the working one and the non working one and they seem to be the same except the .classpath which is getting changed every time I try to run the application like the below</p>

<pre><code>+       &lt;classpathentry exported=""true"" kind=""con"" path=""GROOVY_DSL_SUPPORT""/&gt;
        &lt;classpathentry kind=""con"" path=""com.springsource.sts.grails.core.CLASSP

<p>Can anyone please help me with where I should be looking to get this application back on track??</p>

<p>[UPDATE]:</p>

<p>When I tried to install the mail plugin in my new working project again, The same error is reproduced if I try to run my application. Somehow the plugin is screwing up my application. Now I don't know how the plugins are installed and what they change in a project :-(</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>

If a $_SESSION is like a cookie, then once a user clears his or her cookies from the browser then the $_SESSION should be destroyed. Also, if session_destroy() is called then the $_SESSION variable will be destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Are there other instances where a $_SESSION variable can be destroyed, like maybe a website crash?</strong> If PHP is overloaded on a website, does it directly have to affect the $_SESSION or any other functions and variables dealing with it, or does it affect everything as a whole?</p>

<p><strong>Why am I asking?</strong> 
I'm almost finished writing an abandoned cart script for my ecommerce site and I wanted to redirect the customers back to the site where their order will still be saved in a $_SESSION. The only way the $_SESSION can be destroyed is if the customer completes the purchase. Of course, the customer can also clear the cookies on his or her browser.</p>

<p>But I'm wondering if there is another instance where the $_SESSION can be destroyed aside from those two mentioned above. </p>

<p>A lot of abandoned cart systems store the order info into a database and include that into the email the user receives so they can see the order inside the email. Sure I can write the order into a database, but it's easier to just retain everything in a $_SESSION and have the customer return to the site with their order still in an active $_SESSION.</p>

<p><strong>What can a $_SESSION survive?</strong></p>

<p>Please guide. I'll be very thankful.</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>I think I forgot to add </p>

<pre><code>@Bean
    @Scope(value=""request"", proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)   
    public Twitter twitter() {
        Connection&lt;Twitter&gt; twitter = connectionRepository().findPrimaryConnection(Twitter.class);
        return twitter != null ? twitter.getApi() : new TwitterTemplate();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>to the XML file. Any idea how it would be represented in the XML context. I'm new to Annotation based config &amp; hence using xml based ones. Please help.</p>

<h2>EDIT 2</h2>

<p>I settled for a workaround. Decided to use both Annotation based config and XML based config together.
Just adding the thing I did for everyone:</p>

<p>I added a config:</p>

<pre><code>public class SocialApiConfig {
    @Bean
    @Scope(value=""request"", proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)   
    public Facebook facebook(ConnectionRepository connectionRepository) {
        Connection&lt;Facebook&gt; facebook = connectionRepository.findPrimaryConnection(Facebook.class);
        return facebook != null ? facebook.getApi() : new FacebookTemplate();
    }

    @Bean
    @Scope(value=""request"", proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)   
    public Twitter twitter(ConnectionRepository connectionRepository) {
        Connection&lt;Twitter&gt; twitter = connectionRepository.findPrimaryConnection(Twitter.class);
        return twitter != null ? twitter.getApi() : new TwitterTemplate();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then included this in my XML based config</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean class=""com.joinups.config.SocialApiConfig"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With all of those done, the proguard folder in my project that is created does not contain any files and the Android documentation claims it will contain several.</p>

"32783582","1","","","2015-09-25 13:42:02","","8","146","<p>So I have a booking system. Agents (the people and organisations submitting bookings) are only allowed to make booking in the categories we assign them. Many agents can assign to the same categories. It's a simple many-to-many. Here's an idea of what the models look like:</p>

<pre><code>class Category(models.Model):
    pass

class Agent(models.Model):
    categories = models.ManyToManyField('Category')

class Booking(models.Model):
    agent = models.ForeignKey('Agent')
    category = models.ForeignKey('Category')
</code></pre>

<p>So when a booking comes in, we dynamically allocate the category based on which are available to the agent. The agent usually doesn't specify.</p>

<h3>Can I select Bookings where Booking.category isn't in Booking.agent.categories?</h3>

<p>We have just noticed that —by the grace of a silly admin mistake— some agents were allowed submit Bookings to any category. It has left us with thousands of bookings in the wrong place.</p>

<p>I can fix this but the I can only get it to work by nesting lookups:</p>

<pre><code>for agent in Agent.objects.all():
    for booking in Booking.objects.filter(agent=agent):
        if booking.category not in agent.categories.all():
            # go through the automated allocation logic again
</code></pre>

<p>This works but it's super-slow. It's a lot of data flying between database and Django. This isn't a one-off either. I want to periodically audit new bookings to make sure they are in the correct place. It doesn't seem impossible that another admin issue will occur so after checking the Agent database, I want to query for <strong>Bookings that aren't in their agent's categories.</strong></p>

<p>Again, nested queries will work not but as our datasets grow into millions (and beyond) I'd like to do this more efficiently..</p>

<p>I feel like it should be possible to do this with a <code>F()</code> lookup, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db.models import F
bad = Booking.objects.exclude(category__in=F('agent__categories'))
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't work: <code>TypeError: 'Col' object is not iterable</code></p>

<p>I've also tried <code>.exclude(category=F('agent__categories'))</code> and while it's happier with the syntax there, it doesn't exclude the ""correct"" bookings.</p>

<p>What's the secret formula for doing this sort of <code>F()</code> query on a M2M?</p>

<hr>

<p>To help nail down exactly what I'm after I've set up <a href=""https://github.com/oliwarner/djangorelquerytest"">a Github repo with these models</a> (and some data). Please use them to write the query. The current sole answer hits and issue I was seeing on my ""real"" data too.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/oliwarner/djangorelquerytest.git
cd djangorelquerytest
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install ipython Django==1.9a1

./manage.py migrate
./manage.py shell
</code></pre>

<p>And in the shell, fire in:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db.models import F
from querytest.models import Category, Agent, Booking
Booking.objects.exclude(agent__categories=F('category'))
</code></pre>

<p>Is that a bug? Is there a proper way to achieve this?</p>

You do this by returning a reference to a custom view controller from your UIActivity subclass's <code>activityViewController</code> method.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIActivity_Class/Reference/Reference.html"">UIActivity class reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>activityViewController</strong></p>
  
  <p>The default implementation of this method returns <code>nil</code>. Subclasses that provide additional UI using a view controller can override this method to return that view controller. If this method returns a valid object, the system presents the returned view controller for you, instead of calling the <code>performActivity</code> method. On iPad, your view controller is presented inside of a popover. On iPhone and iPod touch, your view controller is presented modally.</p>
  
  <p>Your custom view controller should provide a view with your custom UI and should handle any user interactions inside those views. Upon completing the activity, do not dismiss the view controller yourself. Instead, call the <code>activityDidFinish:</code> method and let the system dismiss it for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that bit at the end of the first paragraph: <strong>On iPad, your view controller is presented inside of a popover. On iPhone and iPod touch, your view controller is presented modally.</strong></p>

<p>However, on iPad the view controller returned by <code>activityViewController</code> always displays modally, no matter how I present the UIActivityViewController (either modally or via a popover).  When presenting via a popover, it causes it to crash since it doesn't think it's been dismissed.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Is this a bug in iOS 6?</p>

<p>But the problem is that, none of the plugin works in all browsers, meaning Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari and IE.</p>

<p>So this is my question: Is there any method using jQuery or Javascript or without them in HTML5 to use webcam to take pictures?</p>

<p>Webrtc is a good one, but it's not working in IE and Safari. How can I make this function in all browsers?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I need to extract the gps points. I first ask for a contain of a certain regex (found here in SO, see below) to match all cells that have a ""valid"" lat/long value. However, I also need to <code>extract</code> these numbers and either put them on a series of their own (and then call split on the comma) or put them in two new pandas series. I have tried the following for the extraction part:</p>

<p><code>ids_with_latlong[""loc""].str.extract(""[-+]?([1-8]?\d(\.\d+)?|90(\.0+)?),\s*[-+]?(180(\.0+)?|((1[0-7]\d)|([1-9]?\d))(\.\d+)?)$"")</code></p>

<p>but it looks, because of the output, that the reg exp is not doing the matching greedily, because I get something like this:</p>

<pre><code>    0   1            2      3   4           5   6       7    8

    188 33.442101   .442101 NaN 70.650327   NaN 70  NaN 70  .650327
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously it's matching more than I want (I would just need cols 0, 1, and 4), but simply dropping them is too much of a hack for me to do. Notice that the extract function also got rid of the +/- signs at the beginning. If anyone has a solution, I'd really appreciate.</p>

It's an app that allows about 12 social workers to communicate collaboratively and privately. Thus, I need to password protect it.</p>

<p>However, it also needs to be easy to use, very easy to use. A few of these people haven't used a computer before, and having logging on and sign-up processes would put them off completely.</p>

<p>Thus I want to create a landing page, where they have to type a password in (the same password for everybody), then it redirects to the 'discussion pages.' My first idea was to use some obfuscated javascript such that upon typing in the password, it redirects them to the discussion pages, but this doesn't sound very secure.</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend me a better way to do this in rails? Ideally they would only have to type it in once, and then it would authenticate them for all the pages automatically (by setting a cookie?) and anyone trying to access a page directly would be redirected to the authentication page.</p>

  I've learned MVC moslty from CodeIgniter and it was fairly simple to understand the logic behind ""M"", ""V"" and ""C"". However in ExtJS it's not like that mostly because we have stores which are the topic that confuses me most.What's the logic ot having store in MVC model, shouldn't it be a part from the ""M"" or the ""C"" and if someone want to spare the time, I would pretty much appretiate an explanation why exactly we need a store defined outside the main MVC structure.</p>

<pre><code>var wordCreated = new CustomEvent(

    }
);

<p>I'm wondering how to do this without using <code>new</code>, with the <code>Object.create</code> pattern?</p>

<p>The problem I’m not seeing a solution to is that the <code>CustomEvent</code> takes two arguments: a string specifying a name for the event, and a configuration object containing <code>bubbles</code>, <code>cancelable</code>, and <code>details</code> properties. I’m not sure how to pass both the string and the object to <code>Object.create</code>.</p>

<p>Ultimately I expect to be able to use this custom event in the following standard way:</p>

<pre><code>var p = document.querySelector('p'); // a random node
p.addEventListener('newWord', function(ev){ console.log(ev) });
p.dispatchEvent(wordCreated);

Is there a way of doing this (for example luvcview allow me to enter luvcview -f YUVY)?</p>

I've got these POCO classes autogenerated by ""EF POCO reverse code first"" (the same for mappings) and for each one there's also a repository that i use to query or do simple CRUD operations:</p>

<pre><code>    public class Order
    {
        public int IdOrder { get; set; }
        public int IdCustomer { get; set; }
        public int IdOrderType {get; set;}
        public string ChOrder { get; set; }
        public decimal Total { get; set; }

        public Customer Customer { get; set; }
        public OrderType OrderType {get; set;}
    }

    public class OrderType 
    {
        public int IdOrderType {get; set;}
        public string ChOrderType {get; set;}
        public string Description { get; set; }
    }

    public class Customer
    {
        public int IdCustomer { get; set; }
        public string ChCustomer { get; set;}
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string City { get; set; }
        public CustomerType CustomerType { get; set;}
    }

    public class CustomerType
    {
        public int IdCustomerType { get; set; }
        public string ChCustomerType { get; set; }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now i'd like to query OrderRepository and show all results in a DataGridView (in real case, its the DevExpress XtraGrid). This DataGridView must show ""direct"" Order informations (ChOrder, Total) but also ""indirect"" informations such the ones reachable by using navigation properties (ex. Customer.Name, Customer.City, Customer.CustomerType.ChCustomerType). 
What i want is a thing like that:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5UPaV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In a ""Readonly DataGridView"" scenario, this task is fairly simple. You only have to create a linq query that flattern the resultset of the repository and bind it to the grid like that:</p>

<pre><code>this.OrderRepository.AsQueryable().Select(x =&gt; new { .ChOrder = x.ChOrder, 
                             .Total = x.Total, 
                             .ChOrderType = x.OrderType.ChOrderType, 
                             .ChCustomer = x.ChCustomer, 
                             .Name = x.Customer.Name, 
                             .City = x.Customer.City, 
                             .CustomerType = x.Customer.CustomerType}).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>But the grid must have to be editable. In particular i'd like to add new orders, modify ChOrderType (and consequently its description), modify the ChCustomer (and consequently his Name, City and Type) and delete orders. I cannot bind LINQ result because:</p>

<ol>
<li>LINQ anonymous type result are immutable (so the grid would be readonly)</li>
<li>LINQ generates a list where items can change (user can delete items, add new one, modify etc..) and, because of it is a list, it can't track wheter items has been deleted, added and modified (even if i use a better suitable BindingList or ObservableCollection). So i won't know which entities delete, update or insert.</li>
<li>LINQ result item does not implement INotifyPropertyChanged, so, if i change for example ""ChCustomer"" its relative data (Name, City ec..) won't be updated on the screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to those problems, i tought to bind directly the POCO OrderClass in this way:</p>

<pre><code>this.OrderRepository.AsQueryable().Select()
</code></pre>

<p>And set ""indirect"" fields ""DataPropertyName"" like that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Column ""Name"" -> Customer.Name </p>
  
  <p>Column ""City"" -> Customer.City</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But again, it doesn't fit because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My POCO classes does not implement INotifyPropertyChanged, so, if i change for example ""ChCustomer"" its relative data (Name, City ec..) won't be updated on the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>When i edit for example ChCustomer, obviously databinding doesn't know how to get a Customer instance from its repository according on the ChCustomer the user has inserted and assign it to the current Order ""Customer"" property.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes editable fields (as ChCustomers) are part of composite keys and actually the edit of a composite key of an entity is not allowed in EF. This introduces more problems.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, at the end of the story, it turns out that it is a difficult task to manage when EF is involved with databinding (and in our software there are thousand case like this).</p>

<p>I'd like to know if there is a good strategy to accomplish this task.</p>

<p>I tought about how to handle this by using a ViewModel (that also implement INotifyPropertyChanged) object to bind to the gridView like that:</p>

<pre><code>public class OrderViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged{

        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

        //Order info
        public string ChOrder { get; set; }
        public decimal Total {get; set;}
        public string ChOrderType {get; set;}
        public string Description { get; set; }

        //Customer info
        public string ChCustomer { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set;}
        public string City { get; set;}
        public string ChCustomerType {get; set;}
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It works very well, but i don't know how to sync data with repositories.
In particular how to track deleted items and delete them using repository? 
how to track added items? And the edit changes? 
And also...how to set all those properties that comes from navigation properties (such as name, city and so on)?
When i call SaveChanges() of my UnitOfWork i'd like to have all my chages correctly persisted to DB.</p>

<p>Sorry if i talk lenght, but i tried to be the clearest i can.
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I seem to need a way to get values from this sequence, but not in order. For example, if Random had a method like <code>.get(X)</code> which would return whatever the value would be on the Xth invocation of <code>.next()</code>.</p>

<p>One way I can think of is to use a <code>for</code> loop X times, calling <code>.next()</code> on each cycle but not assigning a variable. This won't work well because of A. performance and B. it leaves the Random sequence at X, meaning if your next X is less than the original X, you'll have to reconstruct the <code>Random</code>.</p>

<p>Here's another way I thought of to solve this problem. Maybe you can derive a temporary new seed from the old seed and X, invoke <code>next()</code> one time and store the value, and then return the <code>Random</code> to its original seed. I don't know the typical way of getting this new seed out of two values, probably some crazy bitwise operations. All of my experimenting with this method has not been sufficiently random.</p>

<p>Is there a way to see the diff of the saved version and the edited version of the same file in VIM?</p>

<p>This is the scenario: I've opened a file, editing something and I went away from the computer due to some work. After sometime I returned back and I forgot what I was editing and I would like to see the difference between the last saved and the current unsaved version of the same file. Is there a way to do it?</p>

<p>Of course, I can keep undoing till the last change and start redoing to go back to my unsaved version. But what I would like to see is a diff.</p>

<p>I have a class <code>Media</code> with 3 fields and another class <code>Mediatheque</code> with 1 field(which is an ArrayList).</p>

<p>Let's say I have: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <code>Mediatheque media = new Mediatheque</code></p></li>
<li><p>An <code>equals(Media m)</code> method in class <code>Media</code> &lt; (important method)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I need to write a method <code>add(Media m)</code> which: </p>

<ul>
<li>If the <code>media.contenu</code> does contain an element <code>equals</code> to the <code>Media m</code> I want to add, I must NOT add it and increase the <code>nbEx</code> field of the element contained in <code>media.contenu</code></li>
</ul>

<p>-Else I can add it using the <code>add</code> method provided by the <code>ArrayList</code> ( This doesn't seem too hard)</p>

<p>So I tried to write a <code>contains(Media)</code> method which uses the <code>equals(Media m)</code> method I wrote for the <code>Media</code> class and then use the <code>contains</code> method in the <code>add</code> method.</p>

<p>My question is that how am I supposed to write the <code>add</code> method? &lt; (The Question)</p>

<p>I must write this using <code>ArrayList</code>, it is a school assignment
Sorry about the long code and the bad English, I'm a complete noob.</p>

<p>Here is my <code>Media</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>package Ex1;

public class Media {
    private final String support; // Format: Book, CD, DVD,etc...
    private final String titre; // Title
    private int nbEx; // Number of copy

    public Media(String titre, String support){
        this.titre = titre;
        this.support = support;
        this.nbEx = 1;
    }

    public Media (){
        titre = """";
        support = """";
        nbEx = 0;
    }

    public boolean equals(Media m){
        boolean equality = false;
            if (m instanceof Media){
                equality = (this.titre.equals(m.titre) &amp;&amp; this.support.equals(m.support));
            }
        return equality;
    }

    public Media(Media m){
        this.titre = m.titre;
        this.support = m.support;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my <code>Mediatheque</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Mediatheque {
    ArrayList&lt;Media&gt; contenu;

    public Mediatheque(){

    }

    public Mediatheque(Mediatheque m){
        this.contenu = m.contenu;
    }

    public boolean contains(Media m){
        int i = 0;
        boolean contain = this.contenu.get(i).equals(m);
        for(i = 0; i&lt;this.contenu.size(); i++){
            if(contain)
                break;
        }
        return contain;

    public int indexOf(Media m){
        boolean retVal = this.contenu.get(i).equals(m);
        for(Media i : contenu){
            if(contain)
                break;
        }
        return i;
    }

    public void add(Media m){
        if(this.contains(m)){
            this.contenu.get(this.contenu.indexOf(m)).setNbEx(this.contenu.get(this.contenu.indexOf(m)).getNbEx()+m.getNbEx());
        }else{

<p>I have the WSDL loaded into ESB fine, and I think I have found doco that will cover getting it to use the certificate (<a href=""http://www.soasecurity.org/2012/11/how-to-invoke-secured-backend-service.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soasecurity.org/2012/11/how-to-invoke-secured-backend-service.html</a>) so it's just this part that really has me stumped.</p>

There are a few similar posts on stack overflow that I've tried but to no avail. I've been having issues trying to get a logo displayed when using the bootstrap navbar. My logo displays perfectly fine in development but when I push to heroku the logo and navbar overwhelm the upper portion of the page. I've also precompiled my assets so I don't think that is the issue.</p>

<p>The code in my _header.html.erb view looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;header class=""navbar navbar-fixed-top""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""navbar-inner""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""container""&gt;
      &lt;%= link_to root_path, id: ""logo"" do %&gt;
      &lt;%= image_tag('doneLogo.jpg') %&gt;
      &lt;% end %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My CSS styling for the logo, in custom.css.scss, is as follows:</p>

<p><code>#logo {
  padding-top: 1px;
  width: 180px;
}</code></p>

<p>Any thoughts or idea are much appreciated. Let me know if any other information would be useful.</p>

<p><strong>Main application:</strong></p>

<p>C# (4.0), AnyCPU.</p>

<p><strong>Library:</strong></p>

<p>Wrapper for native .dll written in C++/CLI. Compiled in two versions; x86 and x64, both signed with the same .snk key (using <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/03/11/10140139.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> workaround)</p>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>

<p>In the end a single distribution package is required for x86 and x64 platforms.
Main application needs strong name due to references to other strongly named libs.
Rewriting the library using managed C# and P/Invoke is an absolute last way out.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<p>As long as the main application, at compile time, references the version (x86 or x64) of the library that is needed when run, this is all working fine.</p>

<p>Moving the same compiled output - and exchanging the library with the right platform version during installation - does not work since the signature of the library changes from that of the referenced one.</p>

<p>In a test application without any strong naming I can switch between them as needed.</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong></p>

<p>Is there a way to enable switching between the x86 and x64 libraries within the set limitations, or is strong naming preventing any possible solution other than rewriting the lib?</p>

<p>Let me clarify that it is not a question about finding the correct .dll (as discussed <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/108971/using-side-by-side-assemblies-to-load-the-x64-or-x32-version-of-a-dll/156024#156024"">here</a>) but about being able to load the .dll once found.</p>

<p>I have to use apache thrift to integrate two systems. But instead of the usual, which have a client / server files that communicates with each other (like the thrift examples).

$protocol = new TBinaryProtocol($stdout);

<p>But I don't know how to get the serialized data in order to create the zip file.</p>

This record and replay must use the same timing (up to a sensible resolution, hardly perceivable by a human user, let's say 10ms): if the original stream had data for seconds 00:00 to 00:35, then went mute till 00:55, and then sent more data from 00:55 to 01:34, the same distribution must be observed when my application replays that stream.</p>

<p>If it were just a matter of saving the udp stream to disk and then replaying it, without this timing, it would be trivial by either using Socket, NetworkStream or UdpClient. The issue is I cannot get around to devise a way to modify the standard receive algorithm to include that timing in a way that it's somehow easily replayed later by the send algorithm. As a bonus, a way to start the replay at any time mark (from 00:15 on, for example) should also be supported.</p>

<p>1) Is there any way to easily implement this functionality on C#? We do not have any severe non-functional requirement for this, we just need for it to simply work. Any hint about a way to implement it would be really appreciated.</p>

<p>2) If this is indeed not a simple matter and anyone suggests the use of any third-party component for this, the requirements would be for it to have an API for C# (or a way to operate the component from code), and hopefully be opensource or freely used software.</p>

<p>Doing it inside a function like this works:</p>

<pre><code>func main() {

    client, err := redis.Dial(""tcp"", "":6379"")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer client.Close()

    client.Do(""GET"", ""test:1"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>But bringing it outside doesn't:</p>

<pre><code>var Client = redis.Dial(""tcp"", "":6379"")
defer Client.Close()

func main() {

        Client.Do(""GET"", ""test:1"")
    }

<p>With the following error(s) returned:</p>

<pre><code>./main.go:1: multiple-value redis.Dial() in single-value context
./main.go:2: non-declaration statement outside function body
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried putting the connection as a <strong>const</strong>(ant), putting <strong>defer</strong> inside the main function to my dismay not working too.</p>

<p>This is an even bigger concern as I have many other functions that have to communicate to Redis, but recreating the connection to Redis everytime seems silly.</p>

<p>The Redigo API just shows how to create a <strong>Dial</strong> instance but doesn't go further by explaining how to re-use it.</p>

<p>You may've been lost in my talk, but I wanted to put a bit of context here, so my clear and concise question is: <em>How do you go about re-using (not recreating everytime) a Redigo connection?</em></p>

<p>Both the <code>DataSet</code> and <code>DataTable</code> have the <code>CaseSensitive</code> property set to false which should perform a case-insensitive search.</p>

<p>I have been searching for a couple of days now on why I get these results but cannot find the answer. With the same scenarios I have also tried using <code>string.Compare()</code> with <code>ignoreCase</code> set to <code>false</code> which brings back the same results. </p>

<p>I feel like I am over looking something but just cannot work it out. I'm using .NET 4.0.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain the logic as to how the equality operator works in this situation?</p>

<p><strong>Additional info:</strong></p>

<p>The data is retrieved from a stored procedure from a SqlServer database. Below are a few examples of the rows I get back:</p>

<p>Not sure if this helps but <code>Name</code> column stores the value as a <code>varchar</code> with Collation set to <code>SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS</code></p>

But since it's a partial view, that has no absolute controller to handle it's propagation of dynamic data (from db), how would I call, and where would I code the propagation of data from the db into the view (or model?), if lets say the partial view was to dynamically render content for <code>table.id=n</code>, etc.</p>

After fiddling about, I discovered I am confusing my tools.  With a <code>DataSet.xsd</code> I can drag a table onto the Dataset Designer and click the *TableName*TableAdapter.  If you view the properties window you will see ""DeleteCommand, InsertCommand, SelectCommand, UpdateCommand"".  Is there a way to accomplish this task with Entity Framework too? </p>

<p>I've been able to get both the api and the impl using this, but im still not sure which impl i should really use :</p>

<p>My question is: how do you pass data to that daemon when new mail arrives?</p>

<p>========================</p>

<h1>Rails API Snippet</h1>

<pre><code>To receive emails, you need to implement a public instance method called receive that takes a tmail object as its single parameter. The Action Mailer framework has a corresponding class method, which is also called receive, that accepts a raw, unprocessed email as a string, which it then turns into the tmail object and calls the receive instance method.

Example:

  class Mailman &lt; ActionMailer::Base
    def receive(email)
      page = Page.find_by_address(email.to.first)
      page.emails.create(
        :subject =&gt; email.subject, :body =&gt; email.body
      )

      if email.has_attachments?
        for attachment in email.attachments
          page.attachments.create({
            :file =&gt; attachment, :description =&gt; email.subject
          })
        end
      end
    end
  end

This Mailman can be the target for Postfix or other MTAs. In Rails, you would use the runner in the trivial case like this:

  ./script/runner 'Mailman.receive(STDIN.read)'

However, invoking Rails in the runner for each mail to be received is very resource intensive. A single instance of Rails should be run within a daemon if it is going to be utilized to process more than just a limited number of email.

<pre><code>- (CGFloat)tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView sizeToFitWidthOfColumn:(NSInteger)column;

<p>Implementing it is easy, but when your table is filled with <strong>thousands</strong> of entries, you start to see <strong>performance issues</strong>, and calling this method makes the app <strong>unresponsive</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Here is what the documentation states regarding implementing the method:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Implement this method if you want to control how wide a column is made
  when the user double clicks on the resize divider. By default,
  NSTableView iterates every row in the table, accesses a cell via
  preparedCellAtRow:column:, and requests the ""cellSize"" to find the
  appropriate largest width to use.     </p>
  
  <p><strong>For large row counts, a monte carlo simulation is done instead of interating every row.</strong> For performance and accurate results, it is
  recommended that this method is implemented when using large tables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So i began crawling the web, searching for ""Monte Carlo Simulations"".  </p>

<p>I now have a brief understanding of what a Monte-Carlo simulation is,
but i don't understand how it can apply to this particular problem.</p>

<p>I mean, the max content size is something <strong>totally random</strong>. It won't follow any equation or rule, it's solely based on the content that will be inserted into the cells, so how does a Monte-Carlo method apply here, how will it help me find the adequate content size ?</p>

FROM    @MyXML.nodes('/Students/Student[Nickname = ""Cat""]') T(Students)
JOIN    dbo.MyStudents CLASS ON T.Students.value('Name[1]', 'varchar(20)') = CLASS.StudentName
</code></pre>

<p>I want to update the records that get returned from this SELECT statement, replacing the Nickname with CLEARED.  So, if dbo.MyStudents has Joseph but not Catherine, the resulting @MyXML variable would be:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;Students&gt;
    &lt;Student&gt;
      &lt;Nickname&gt;Cat&lt;/Nickname&gt;
      &lt;Name&gt;Catherine&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;/Student&gt;
    &lt;Student&gt;
      &lt;Nickname&gt;CLEARED&lt;/Nickname&gt;
      &lt;Name&gt;Joseph&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;/Student&gt;
  &lt;/Students&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to do this by modifying the XML variable directly?  Or will I need to put the XML variable into a temp table and perform a .modify on the temp table?  </p>

<p>So far, examples that I have found do not have the conditional update with .modify based on the join.</p>

Everything works good so far i can send and recieve objects and i use some serialization/deserialization code. Now i started working on the encryption code and i am not so familiar with this stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li>I work with bytes , is DES-CBC a good
way to encrypt this stuff? Or are
there other more performant/secure
ways to send my data? Note that
performance is a must :).</li>
<li>When i call: <strong>ReadAmf3Object</strong> with the decrypter specified i get an: InvalidOperationException thrown by my ReadAmf3Object function when i read out the first byte the Amf3TypeCode isn't specified ( they range from 0 to 16 i believe (Bool, String, Int, DateTime, etc) ). I got Typecodes varying from 97 to 254? Anyone knows whats going wrong? I think it has something to do with the encryption part. Since the deserializer works fine w/o the encryption. I am using the right padding/mode/key?</li>
</ul>

crypter.Padding = PaddingMode.Zeros;
crypter.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;
crypter.Key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""TESTTEST"");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>AS3</strong></p>

<pre><code>private static var _KEY:ByteArray = Hex.toArray(Hex.fromString(""TESTTEST""));

<p>However, I am not sure how to pass the list between the panes. Is there some way to push the array to pane #2 when the update button on the first pane is pressed?</p>

<p>The first panel instantiates a button listener that applies all of the logic to the array list ""compList""</p>

<pre><code>private class ButtonListener implements ActionListener

            }
        }

<p>My jar uses httpClient &amp; httpCore, httpClient also has some dependencies on httpCore. The problem happens when httpclient references httpcore without being referenced from my jar. I have proven that is the external jar referencing the other one by editing the manifest of httpclient to have the httpcore jar. All works if I do this but I do not want to be manually editing external jars as you would expect!</p>

<p>The code creates a process with a frozen main thread, changes the whole process data and finally resumes it so it runs the byte[] of the PE. But it seems like the process dies if the thread is resumed, i don't really know whats wrong.</p>

The code which i am using for starting and stoppin is in this <a href=""https://github.com/roman10/roman10-android-tutorial/tree/master/AndroidWaveRecorder"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>.
Is there any other way to stop the recorder automatically after 30 secs</p>

<p>But in Design Time there seems to be no chance to scroll down to positioning the (now hidden) Controls accuratly.</p>

<p>One Solution for this is to expand the Control to show the complete content. But that can't be the best Solution. Does anyone have a clue for proper scrolling in design time?</p>

I have zero experience to fall back on and am finding the documentation a little light on what I want to achieve.</p>

<p>I can read the header line and body lines no problem (using <code>FixedLengthTokenizer</code> and <code>PatternMatchingCompositeLineMapper</code>). However, when it comes to building the domain objects, I need to do two things which are less obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li>The object storing the header ID, filename etc also needs the total number of records in the file (not the number written to DB - this is to facilitate manual checks if needed)</li>
<li>The object storing the individual records needs to reference the header ID of the file</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, item-by-item reading, processing and writing isn't enough. The data corresponding to each row depends on other rows in the file.</p>

<p>I'm sure there must be a clean Spring-based approach, I'm just not sure where to start looking.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>HDR 12345
ROW 2013-08-01 Lorem ipsum
ROW 2013-08-01 dolor sit amet
</code></pre>

<p>The three domain objects I need to build are:</p>

<pre><code>Header {id: 12345, records: 2}
Record {header_id: 12345, text: Lorem ipsum }
Record {header_id: 12345, text: dolor sit amet }
</code></pre>

<p>In production the files would be significantly more complex and very large - it wouldn't be ideal to write them out in an intermediate state, for instance, although I wonder if the solution might involve processing them in two passes, somehow building the required data that way?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>I didn't really get what the state object parameter is all about in <code>pushState</code>, and the page over at MDN only gave a simple object as an example. But I thought, hey, why don't I use this object to store the AJAX response HTML and load that when <code>onpopstate</code> fires? So I'm doing something like this:</p>

<p><strong>On XHR status 200/304 (AJAX success)</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>if (history.pushState) {
    var state = {
        html: xhr.responseText
    };
    history.pushState(state, null, url);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>onpopstate</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>window.onpopstate = function(event) { 
    if(event &amp;&amp; event.state) {
        someDivInTheDoc.innerHTML = event.state.html;
    } else {
        location.reload();
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This, of course, would load (old) content that might have gotten updated, making it something similar to when you go back and get the browser's cache, I guess.</p>

<p>Over at MDN, it says that the object can hold up to 640k characters in its JSON representation. </p>

<p><strong>So, was the state object meant for something like this? Or should I just force a reload/do an AJAX request again when history moves position?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My app.js looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.application({
    name: 'YogaNow',

controllers: ['Main', 'C1','C2','C3'],
    views: ['Main'],
    stores: ['S1', 'S2', 'S3','S4'],
    models: ['M1', 'M2', 'M3','M4'],

    launch: function() {
        console.log('launch');
        Ext.Viewport.add({
            xtype: 'mainpanel',
        });
    },
});


if(Ext.os.deviceType == 'Desktop') {
    setTimeout(function() {
        var e = document.createEvent('Events');
            e.initEvent('deviceready');
            document.dispatchEvent(e);
    }, 250);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As stated, the app runs fine (without errors) on the Desktop.  If I remove the cordova reference from index.html and comment out the ""if(Ext.os.deviceType) {...}"" it also runs without error in Safari under iOS (Simulator and Device).</p>

<p>Removing the reference to cordova also makes the app work in the PhoneGap/Cordova shell when run in Simulator or on Device.</p>

<p>Why would including cordova-2.0.0.js and then building in Xcode cause the ST2 code to not update the view?</p>

I initially tried using the following function to read the table, but it wasn't ideal because I want to separate each species name into its component parts (genus/species/infraspecies/author etc).</p>

<pre><code>library(XML)
readHTMLTable(""http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-419248"")
</code></pre>

<p>I used SelectorGadget to identify a unique XPATH to each table element that I want to extract (not necessarily the shortest):</p>

<p>For genus names : //<em>[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""Synonym"", "" "" ))]//</em>
[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""genus"", "" "" ))] </p>

<p>For species names: //<em>[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""Synonym"", "" "" ))]//</em>[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""species"", "" "" ))] </p>

<p>For infraspecies ranks: //*[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""infraspr"", "" "" ))] </p>

<p>For infraspecies names: //*[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""infraspe"", "" "" ))] </p>

<p>For confidence levels (image): //<em>[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""synonyms"", "" "" ))]//img For sources: //</em>[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""source"", "" "" ))]//a </p>

<p>I now want to extract the information into a dataframe/table.</p>

<p>I tried using the xpathSApply function of the XML package to extract some of this data:</p>

<p>e.g. for infraspecies ranks</p>

<pre><code>library(XML)
library(RCurl)
infraspeciesrank = htmlParse(getURL(""http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-419248""))
path=' //*[contains(concat( "" "", @class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""infraspr"", "" "" ))]'
xpathSApply(infraspeciesrank, path)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this method is problematic because of gaps in the data (e.g. only some rows of the table have an infraspecies rank, so all I have returned is a list of the three ranks in the table, with no gaps). The data output is also of a class that I have had trouble attaching to a dataframe.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a better way to extract information from this table into a dataframe? </p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

I have two entities that I would like to tie together: Playlists and Songs. Each playlist will have a variety of songs, but each song can also be on several playlists, hence the many-to-many. After some looking around, I found that it may be easiest to do this by implementing a third entity which is essentially the ""relationship"" between the two. The Playlists would have a one-to-many relationship with the third entity, as would the Songs.. The reason for this would be so I could create / remove that third ""relationship"" entity when I want to add / remove a song from a playlist, and is better overall for organizing, at least in my opinion.</p>

<p>Last thing to note is that I have three basic tables in my window: A table that lists every playlist, a table that lists every song, and then a table that lists all the songs under whatever playlist is selected in the first table. </p>

<p>I'm currently stuck on how to create the ""relationship"" third entity based on the objects that are selected in both the playlists and songs arrays/tables. I understand how to create the entity, but don't know how I can call the array controller to give me the selected object. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance,</p>

<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Have solution consisting of several C++ projects (Test.sln),</li>
<li>Add a brand new project to your solution (BuildInstaller.vcxproj),</li>
<li>Open BuildInstaller.vcxproj in text editor and append following xml fragment right before closing <code>&lt;/Project&gt;</code> tag:</li>
</ol>

<pre class=""lang-msbuild prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;Target Name=""Build""&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""..\Test.sln"" Properties=""Configuration=Release;Platform=Win32"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""..\Test.sln"" Properties=""Configuration=Release;Platform=x64"" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
</code></pre>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>Above code overrides default <code>Build</code> target of the BuildInstaller project and everytime the project is being built, it builds its parent solution with Release configuration for both Win32 and x64 platforms,</li>
<li>To prevent unbounded recursion, open Configuration Manager in Visual Studio and uncheck ""Build"" checkbox for BuildInstaller project for all combinations of Debug/Release and Win32/x64,</li>
<li>Then, still in Configuration Manager, create a new configuration, e.g. Installer for which you should uncheck all the other project's Build checkbox and leave it checked for BuildInstaller only,</li>
<li>Now build your solution for Installer configuration.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would expect this build to finish successfully, but it simply hangs, even though BuildInstaller should not be built recursively as we are recursively building the Test.sln only for Release configuration.</p>

<p>I am not asking whether this is a good approach or how to work around it, I am just curious why the build hangs. Setting output window verbosity to Diagnostic was of no help to me.</p>

<p>I am using Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate.</p>

I'm onto my next project (you may be wondering why I'm not just switching languages but that's not why I'm here) and I've decided to try doing it right, or at least better, this time.</p>

<p>I've got some models defined, and I've started on a main controller. I'm at a fork in my decisions about how to implement the view. So far, the main controller can be given lists of display functions to call, and then it can spew out the whole page with one call. It looks like:</p>

<pre><code>function Parse_Body()  
{  
    foreach ($this-&gt;body_calls as $command)  
    {  
        $call = $command['call'];  
        if (isset($command['args'])) $call($command['args']);  
        else $call();  
    }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>My dilemma is this:</p>

<p>Would it be better to have all of my display functions <em>return</em> the HTML they generate, so that the main controller can just <code>echo $page;</code> or should the display files use raw HTML outside of PHP, which gets output as soon as it's read?</p>

<p>With the former, the main app controller can precisely control when things get output, without just relinquishing complete control to the whim of the displays. Not to mention, all those lists of display functions to call (above) can't really be executed from a display file unless they got passed along. With the latter method, I get the benefit of doing HTML in actual HTML, instead of doing huge PHP string blocks. Plus I can just include the file to run it, instead of calling a function. So I guess with that method, a file is like a function.</p>

<p>Any input or advice please?</p>

"12440392","1","12441420","","2012-09-15 19:41:37","","2","116","<p>I'm writing a PHP application which makes use of a modular structure. To modules are basically folder names, and those folders contain PHP files.</p>

<p>It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>/modules
   /module1
   /module2
   /module3
</code></pre>

<p>My PHP application reads the content of the <code>modules</code> folder and saves the folder names to a table in my database. My <code>modules</code> table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>id | module  | active | order
1  | module1 | 1      | 2
2  | module2 | 0      | 1
3  | module3 | 1      | 3
</code></pre>

<p>After the <code>modules</code> folder have been read and the folder names have been saved to the database, i then fetch the rows from the table again. That way i can easily see which modules are active, and in which order i have to show them.</p>

<p>The problem with this method is that i have to do all of the above everytime a page is visited. Because the system doesn't know when a <code>module</code> have been added or removed from the <code>module</code> folder. So by ""reading the folder / saving it to the DB / and reading the DB again"" seems to give to most up to date version. But i can imagine that this method is inefficient. I think this can be done better.</p>

<hr>

<p>There's one solution i've came up with. But i still don't think that this is the best solution.</p>

<h2>Solution 1</h2>

<p>When a user visits the site, then do all of the above. Read the <code>modules</code> folder, save the folder names to the table (after clearing the table first) and then get the rows from the table and store that in a <code>session</code>. When the user navigates through the site i can simply iterate over the <code>session</code>.</p>

<p>Cons: Removed/Added modules will only be visible when the browser is closed and re-opened.</p>

<h2>Improvements?</h2>

<p>I'm sure there's a more elegant way of doing this. Anyone any ideas?</p>

My custom listener:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyHttpSessionListener implements HttpSessionListener {

    @Override
    public void sessionCreated(HttpSessionEvent se) {
        if (FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getSessionMap()

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is giving me a stack overflow error. It appears that the <code>put()</code> method in the <code>SessionMap</code> class tries to create a new <code>HttpSession</code>, thus causing an infinite loop to occur with my listener. How can I initialize a JSF session-scoped bean when my application's session first starts, without running into this issue?</p>

However, there is a disconnect between what Intellisense interprets as the ""this"" keyword and what it actually resolves to during runtime.  For example, consider the following TypeScript ajax call:</p>

<pre><code> getAgencies() {
            var self = this;          
            $.ajax(liveString + ""/Home/GetSupportedAgencies"",

                dataType: ""json"",
                error: Utilities.Logger.displayAjaxError,
                success: this.onGetAgenciesComplete
            });

        }

<p>and its corresponding callback:</p>

<pre><code>   onGetAgenciesComplete(agencies) {

                    else {
                        $.each(agencies, function (i, a) {
                            self._indexViewModel.agencies.push({ name: a.Name, fullName: a.FullName, shortName: a.ShortName, bbox: a.BBox, countryCode: a.CountryCode });

<p>this is what i have now:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  datepart(m,clickDate), sum([clicksEmail]) TotalWeb 
FROM tblCompanyClicks  A WHERE companyID = 1129 
GROUP BY datepart(m,clickDate)
ORDER BY datepart(m,clickDate) DESC

<p>which works great.  just that i would also like to display the year - not just the month.
but as soon as i add the year into the SQL, its ruins the aggregate function. I tried using a sub select, but that too didnt seem to work. </p>

I would like implement a next/previous option on my keyboard.
I have managed to implement it UI-wise, with some code examples i saw online, but all of them are assuming we need to add code to each view controller to implement the actual transition between the text fields.  </p>

<p>My question is: is there a general way to know, given some text field, who is the next field in order? (i.e without refactoring each of my view controllers)</p>

<p>I ask this question because when i use the iPhone simulator and press the computer's Tab key - the switch between the fields happen, so i wonder if there is a built-in or generic way to implement it on iOS.</p>

<p><strong>clarification:</strong>
is there a way of doing it without adding a specific code for each type of view controller? (adding a generic code is acceptable) </p>

I <em>think</em> the way to do that is through KML. If that's not the way to go, I'd love to hear other approaches (other than displaying the text as images). If KML is the way to go, then I wonder what I'm doing wrong:</p>

<p>I'm trying to load this example KML file into a test GoogleMap through GWT: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/KML_Samples.kml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/KML_Samples.kml</a></p>

<p>The main tag in that file I care about is this one:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;Placemark&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Simple placemark&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Attached to the ground. Intelligently places itself at the
      height of the underlying terrain.&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;Point&gt;
      &lt;coordinates&gt;-122.0822035425683,37.42228990140251,0&lt;/coordinates&gt;
    &lt;/Point&gt;
  &lt;/Placemark&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I render that KML file on Google Earth, the name (Simple placemark) is displayed directly on the map. Hooray!</p>

<p>However, when I render that KML file on GoogleMaps, the name is not displayed on the map, and only shows up in an InfoWindow when I click on the placemark. Everything else seems to display fine, except no text is rendered directly on the map, which is my entire goal.</p>

<p>I've included the example map code I'm using, and I'm hoping there's a way to tell the GoogleMap to display the name, or really any text, on the map directly.</p>

<p>Is there a good way to do this or should I be taking a different approach. Any ideas?</p>

With dynamic linking the linker adds to the executable ELF header all the references of the libraries which it needs and the operating system loads these libraries before executing the binary.</p>

<p>Now I have used the option of the linker to set RPATH -Wl,-rpath,\$$ORIGIN/lib (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath</a>) and so before the execution the linker looks as the first path the RPATH. This is true if the DT_RUNPATH is not set (<a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/RpathIssue"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/RpathIssue</a>). On my Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit, if I check with ldd this is correct all the libraries points to the right path.

<p>I followed the Oracle instructions to sign the jar and then used the jarsigner tool to verify the jar. Supposedly, it was fine.</p>

<p>In the .jnlp file, I included the security tag with all-permissions:  </p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>    &lt;security&gt;
        &lt;all-permissions/&gt;
    &lt;/security&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the program launches, however, <strong>I never see a dialog prompting the user to accept the certificate</strong> or asking for some kind of permission to run on the client computer.  It was my understanding that I should see such a dialog, according to Oracle documentation.</p>

<p>I have read this page on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10918777/jnlp-get-a-permission"">JNLP get a permission</a></p>

<p>and I have a similar situation in that I get a security exception.  In my case, the exception is thrown when the app attempts to show a filechooser dialog:</p>

<pre><code>java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission user.home read)
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the user was never asked to provide permission.  I believe I followed the advice on that stackoverflow page, but it doesn't seem to be working for me.  It's like the jar appears to be unsigned.  I even tried removing the all-permissions tag and got exactly the same behavior.</p>

<p>I have looked inside the jar and I can see that the two required files are in there:  MYKEY.DSA and MYKEY.SF.  I looked inside the readable one (.SF) and it contains the text that should be there.  I believe that is all the jar needs in order to be signed.  </p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) Does it matter what the names are of the .DSA and .SF files are, with respect to the app?  Currently they just have the name of the alias I used with keytool.</p>

<p>2) Does it matter if the java version on my server is 1.7 while the java version on my development computer is 1.6?  I need to compile in 1.6 because our school has not upgraded to 1.7, so when it runs on client computers it needs to be 1.6.</p>

<p>3) Is there a way to determine which version of jarsigner I am using when I run it from the terminal?  I tried jarsigner -version, but that is not one of the options.  I notice that the top of the MYKEY.SF file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Signature-Version: 1.0

    Name: org/arps/tranz/TranzActionMap.class
    SHA1-Digest: dSI3RKfgUrRHbwnZLyXbkiJLWdU=
</code></pre>

<p>Does this mean that there is actually some older version of jarsigner running?  I didn't think Java 1.4 was still on my computer.  In any case, my version of jarsigner seems to create the same kind of file as seen here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/intro.html</a></p>

<p>I don't know if files created by a 1.6 jarsigner or 1.7 jarsigner look any different, or if it should matter.</p>

<p>4) If the version of jarsigner is the culprit, how do I force a newer version of jarsigner to run from the terminal (Ubuntu)? </p>

<p>Thanks for your help.  As I said at the start, I am an amateur programmer.  All I really want to do is to be ready for my classes next week.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>After struggling for quite a time with a jar tool that couldn't find libjli.so, I have now successfully used the 1.6 jar tool and jarsigner tool, so that the top of the MYKEY.SF file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Signature-Version: 1.0

    Created-By: 1.6.0_03 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
    SHA1-Digest-Manifest: ZPS3aOyPW/tymxbGdfe4/qBVK/g=
</code></pre>

<p>But I still get the same behavior, where the app starts to launch without asking the user to accept the certificate.  So now my main question is:</p>

<p><strong>Does it matter that the jar was created with 1.6 while my server is running 1.7?</strong>  </p>

<p>I don't know how much java activity actually happens on the server.  At some point, it switches over to the client computer but I assume parts of jnlp happen on the server first.</p>

                        }

</code></pre>

<p>The output is then echoed later in the script. So one user has told me to use document instead of #teamTab_addPlayerForm and it works, but I'm wondering why this previous code worked fine and that one didn't:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(""#teamTab_teamListForm"").on('change', 'select#teamTab_teamSelect', function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    jQuery(this).attr('disabled', true);
    var teamID = jQuery(this).val();
    jQuery('select#teamTab_leagueSelect').attr('disabled', true);
    var leagueID = jQuery('select#teamTab_leagueSelect').val();
    data = { action: ""leagueDesignerTeamsTabLoadTeamPlayers"", leagueID: leagueID, teamID: teamID };
        jQuery.ajax({
            type: 'POST', url: ajaxurl, data: data, dataType: 'html', success: function(response) {
                if (response == ""error"") {
                    jQuery('select#teamTab_teamSelect').attr('disabled', false);
                    alert('There was an error processing your request');
                }
                else {
                    jQuery('select#teamTab_teamSelect').attr('disabled', false);
                    jQuery('select#teamTab_leagueSelect').attr('disabled', false);
                    jQuery('.ld_teamEdit').remove();
                    jQuery('#ld_addPlayerFunction').remove();
                    jQuery('div#ld_teamTabTeamInfo').remove();
                    jQuery('#teamTab_teamListForm').after(response);
                }
                }});
});
</code></pre>

<p>That was the code that is dealing with select boxes in the same way. And here is the PHP code:</p>

<pre><code>function leagueDesignerTeamsTabLoadLeagueTeams () { 
global $wpdb;
$leagueID = $_POST['leagueID']; //Pull the POST'd leagueID
$output = '&lt;select id=""teamTab_teamSelect"" name=""team""&gt;&lt;option value=""""&gt;Choose a Team&lt;/option&gt;'; //Output...
$errors = 0; //Error checking...
$teams = $wpdb-&gt;get_results('SELECT * FROM ' . $wpdb-&gt;prefix . 'leagueDesigner_teams WHERE leagueID = ' . $leagueID);
foreach($teams as $team){
    $output .= '&lt;option value=""' . $team-&gt;teamID . '""';
    if ($_POST['team'] == $team-&gt;teamID){
        $output .= ' selected';
    }
    $output .= '&gt;' . $team-&gt;teamID . '. ' . $team-&gt;teamName . '&lt;/option&gt;';
}
if (!$teams) {
    $errors++;
}
$output .= '&lt;/select&gt;';
if ($errors == 0) { echo $output; } else { echo 'error'; }
die(); // this is required to return a proper result

<p>A user is working on a project in our system. In order to publish the project on our system, they must first pay some fees so the project can be published. When the user clicks publish they are then taken to a shopping cart. The shopping cart has two line items. The line items represent the costs associated with the publishing. When the payment goes through, I then run my stored procedures to update a porject and insert the order with the details. How I have it currently is not in a transaction. I have 3 separate SPs to handle the flow. First, the project data is updated, then an order is inserted, i then use the ID generated by the order insert to insert the data for the details. I am currently looping through the shopping cart and performing each detail insert separately.</p>

<p>I began to create a stored procedure that would execute all the stored procedures, but I got stumped with what to do about the order line items or details. </p>

<p>What is a good solution to bundle all of these tasks into one transaction? </p>

<h2>Need for better solution</h2>

<p>That's just not manageable for larger maps and sets of labels. <strong>How to add force repulsions to these both classes: <code>.place-label</code> and <code>.subunit-label</code>?</strong></p>

<p>This issue is quite a brain storming as I haven't deadline on this, but I'am quite curious about it. I was thinking about this question as a basic D3js implementation of Migurski/<a href=""https://github.com/migurski/Dymo"">Dymo.py</a>. Dymo.py's README.md documentation set a large set of objectives, from which to select the core needs and functions (20% of the work, 80% of the result). </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Initial placement:</strong> Bostock give a good start with left/right positionning relative to the geopoint. </li>
<li><strong>Inter-labels repulsion:</strong> different approach are possible, Lars &amp; Navarrc proposed one each,</li>
<li><strong>Labels annihilation:</strong> A label annihilation function when one label's overall repulsion is too intense, since squeezed between other labels, with the priority of annihilation being either random or based on a <code>population</code> data value, which we can get via NaturalEarth's .shp file.</li>
<li>[Luxury] <strong>Label-to-dots repulsion:</strong> with fixed dots and mobile labels. But this is rather a luxury. </li>
</ol>

<p>I ignore if label repulsion will work across layers and classes of labels. But getting countries labels and cities labels not overlapping may be a luxury as well.</p>

<p>Here is simple example:</p>

<pre><code>-module(my_module).
-compile(export_all).

    do_apply( X, F ) -&gt; F( X ).
</code></pre>

<p>First of all - test on single node:    </p>

<pre><code>1&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X) -&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], lists:seq(1,10000)] ).
{208198,
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>After that I've connected second node (second erlang shell process in my OS):</p>

<pre><code>(foo@Stemm.local)24&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X) -&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], lists:seq(1,10000)] ).
{446284,
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally I've connected third node:</p>

<pre><code>(foo@Stemm.local)26&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X) -&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], lists:seq(1,10000)] ).

  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>So - I've got <strong>worse performance with three nodes vs. single node</strong>. </p>

<p>I'm realize that there is some overhead for communication between nodes. But how can I understand in which cases is better to perform calculations on multiple nodes?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>My step-by-step test from shell:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; c(my_module).
{ok,my_module}
2&gt;  
2&gt; List = lists:seq(1,10000).
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
 23,24,25,26,27,28,29|...]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Test performance on single node:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>3&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X)-&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], List] ).
{207346,
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>Entrance to network environment:</p>

<pre><code>4&gt; net_kernel:start([one]).
{ok,&lt;0.20066.0&gt;}
(one@Stemm.local)5&gt; erlang:set_cookie(node(), foobar).
true
</code></pre>

<p>Add second node:</p>

<pre><code>(one@Stemm.local)6&gt; net_kernel:connect('two@Stemm.local').
true
(one@Stemm.local)7&gt; 
(one@Stemm.local)7&gt; nodes().
['two@Stemm.local']
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Test performance with two nodes:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(one@Stemm.local)8&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X)-&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], List] ).
{510733,
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>Connect third node:</p>

<pre><code>(one@Stemm.local)9&gt; net_kernel:connect('three@Stemm.local').
true
(one@Stemm.local)10&gt; nodes().
['two@Stemm.local',
 'three@Stemm.local']
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Test performance with three nodes:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(one@Stemm.local)11&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X)-&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], List] ).

  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I guess that performance decreases because I'm creating each node as a new erlang-shell process in the same physical machine. But I don't know exactly if I'm right.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am using Linux, I don't think its possible to do what I want to do from the command line (However, Firefox command-line options are not fully documented so it could be possible). One solution to my problem would be to use JavaScript to open the tabs once the browser has been executed. I think changing the default profile to the profile I want to open each time I want to load a new URL may work also. This will require changes to profiles.ini each time a new URL is loaded. I haven't tested this but it looks promising.</p>

    db.open(db_open);
};

for(var i=0; i&lt;100; i++){
    module.exports.insert({name : ""test""});
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I'm running this code I get the error <code>db object already connecting, open cannot be called multiple times</code>
To resolve the problem, I decided to create a new instance of <code>Server</code> and <code>Db</code> at each call of the function :</p>

<pre><code>module.exports.insert = function(document){
    var database;
    var server = new Server(""xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"", 27017, {auto_reconnect: true, poolSize: 100});
    var db = new Db(""testDb"", server, {safe: false}); 

    function db_open(err, db_local){
        if(err) throw err;
        database = db_local;
        database.collection(""rooms"", handle_insert);
    }
    function handle_insert(err, collection){
        if(err) throw err;
        collection.insert(document);
        database.close();
    }
    db.open(db_open);
};

for(var i=0; i&lt;100; i++){
    module.exports.insert({name : ""test""});
}
</code></pre>

<p>But now I'm getting <code>connection closed</code> thrown by the db_open function
I really don't understand why my connection is closing between the moment when I'm creating <code>db</code> and when my code call <code>db_open</code>.<br>
Have you an idea of what is happening?<br><br>
Thank you :)<br><br>

<p>My approach is using <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902"" rel=""nofollow"">rfc6902 (JSONPatch) specification</a> with <a href=""https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch#user-content-usage"" rel=""nofollow"">jsonpatch</a> library for patching JSON document. All such documents store in MongoDB database and as you know the last one very slow for frequent writes.</p>

<p>To get more speed and highload application I use redis as queue for a patch operations like the following:</p>

<pre><code>{ ""op"": ""add"", ""path"": ""/comments/2"", ""value"":  {text: 'Comment test3', tags: ['tag4']}"" }
</code></pre>

<p>I just store all such patch operations in queue and at midnight run cron script to get all patches and construct full document and update it in MongoDB database.</p>

<p>I don't understand yet what should I do in case corrupted patch like:</p>

<pre><code>{ ""op"": ""add"", ""path"": ""/comments/0/tags/5"", ""value"": 'tag4'}

<pre><code> The specified index MUST NOT be greater than the number of elements in the array.

<p>So when user is online he don't get any errors because his patch operations get stored in redis queue but next day he get broken document due broken patch that don't got applied in cron script.</p>

<p>I would like to perform searches on the tree to return a reference to a specific node. For example, suppose there is some <code>Company</code> tree, which contains <code>Department</code> nodes amongst other types of nodes. <code>Department</code> nodes consist of <code>Employee</code> nodes. It is assumed that an employee must be part of a department, and can be in exactly one department.</p>

<p>Currently, it is designed so that each node has a list of child nodes of type <code>NodeBase</code>. A tree can become quite large, with hundreds of thousands of nodes at times. Insertion/deletion operations are seldom used, while search operations should not take ""too long"" for these big trees.</p>

<p>Suppose I want to get a reference to an employee node whose <code>employee ID</code> field equals some string that I provide. I don't know which department the employee is in, so I'd have to perform a search through all of the nodes hoping to find a match. Not all nodes have an <code>employee ID</code> field; departments, for example, do not have them.</p>

<p>I am not sure what is the best way to implement the search functionality, given this tree structure design.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;neo4j:config graphDatabaseService=""graphDatabaseService"" /&gt;
&lt;bean id=""graphDatabaseService"" class=""org.springframework.data.neo4j.rest.SpringRestGraphDatabase""&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg index=""0"" value=""http://localhost:7474/db/data"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At the beginning I was using notations on my domain objects (<code>@NodeEntity</code>, <code>@RelatedTo</code>, etc.) and repositories to save nodes and relationships. My domain objects are <strong>User</strong>(id, name), <strong>Item</strong>(id, name, description, list of terms), <strong>Term</strong>(content, count). So there not so many properties out there, but even so, saving the object through repository, for example a User with defined id and name lasted for <strong>25 seconds</strong>. </p>

<p>I read that this kind of communication with neo4j database is not yet well optimized, so I <strong>switched on using the Neo4jTemplate</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a example of saving the user (constraints in User are Strings (""id"", ""name"", ""USER""):</p>

<pre><code>public Node saveUser(User user) {
    Node node = template.createNode();
    node.setProperty(User.ID, user.getId());
    node.setProperty(User.NAME, user.getName());
    node.setProperty(""_type"", User.LABEL);

    template.index(INDEX_ID, node, User.ID, user.getId());
    return node;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is a example of saving the item with relationships to its terms. So each term is a node which is connected to the item:</p>

<pre><code>public Node saveItem(Item item) {
    Node node = template.createNode();
    node.setProperty(Item.ID, item.getId());
    node.setProperty(Item.NAME, item.getName());
    node.setProperty(Item.DESCRIPTION, item.getDescription());
    node.setProperty(""_type"", Item.LABEL);

    template.index(INDEX_ID, node, Item.ID, item.getId());

    for(String termContent : item.getTerms()) {
        Node term = termRepository.getNodeByContent(termContent);
        if(term == null) {
            term = termRepository.saveTerm(new Term(termContent));
        } else {
            termRepository.addCountToTerm(term);
        }

        int frequency = 1;          

        Relationship contains = node.createRelationshipTo(term, RelationshipTypes.CONTAINS);
        contains.setProperty(Term.FREQUENCY, frequency);            
    }
    return node;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The object <code>termRepository</code> (it isn't extending <code>GraphRespository&lt;Term&gt;</code>) has methods which are similar to the method of saving the user. Fetching the term is done like this:</p>

<pre><code>public Node getNodeByContent(String content) {
    if(!template.getGraphDatabaseService().index().existsForNodes(INDEX_ID))
        return null;
    return template.lookup(INDEX_ID, Term.CONTENT, content).to(Node.class).singleOrNull();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, <strong>finally what is my problem</strong>. Even now it is <strong>still slow</strong>, inserting user (only parameters id and name) and indexing it takes for <strong>3 seconds</strong>, and inserting item where it is being connected to terms takes <strong>for 30 seconds</strong> (for 4 terms - which is very small ammount according to the number of 60-70 which I will have in real situation).</p>

<p>Please, can you give me some hint or anything else that could help me with this kind of issue?

&gt;&gt;&gt;y = x
&gt;&gt;&gt;x,y
([1,2,3],[1,2,3])
&gt;&gt;&gt;x is y
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;x[1] = 14
&gt;&gt;&gt;x,y
([1,14,3],[1,14,3])
</code></pre>

<p>Deep copying creates a new object with equivalent value :</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;import copy
&gt;&gt;&gt;x = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;y = copy.deepcopy(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt;x is y
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;x == y
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;x[1] = 14
&gt;&gt;&gt;x,y
([1,14,3],[1,2,3])
</code></pre>

<p>My confusion is if <code>x=y</code> creates a shallow copy and the copy.copy() function also creates a shallow copy of the object then:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = x
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = copy.copy(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x is y
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; x is z
False

<ul>
<li><p>The syntax appears to be different, for no obvious reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Function types cannot have class instances. (Seems a rather odd rule...)</p></li>
<li><p>The language spec says something about implementing superclasses in a subclass instance declaration. (But not if you have diamond inheritance... it won't be an error, but it's not guaranteed to work somehow?)</p></li>
<li><p>Frege is less fussy about what an instance looks like. (Type aliases are allowed, type variables are not required to be distinct, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Methods can be declared as <code>native</code>, though it is not completely clear what the meaning of this is.</p></li>
<li><p>It appears that you can write <code>type.method</code> to access a method. Again, no indication as to what this means or why it's useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Subclass declarations can provide default implementations for superclass methods. (?)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, it would be useful if somebody who knows about this stuff could write an explanation of how this stuff works. It's listed in the language spec, but the descriptions are a little bit terse.</p>

<p>(Regarding the syntax: I think Haskell's instance syntax is more logical. ""If X is an instance of Y and Z, then it is also an instance of Q in the following way..."" Haskell's class syntax has always seemed a bit strange to me. If X implements <code>Eq</code>, that does not <em>imply</em> that it implements <code>Ord</code>, it implies that it <em>could</em> implement <code>Ord</code> if it wants to. I'm not sure what a better symbol would be though...)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Per Ingo's answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm assuming that providing a default implementation for a superclass method only works if you declare your instances ""all at once""?</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, suppose <code>Foo</code> is a superclass of <code>Bar</code>. Suppose each class has three methods (<code>foo1</code>, <code>foo2</code>, <code>foo3</code>, <code>bar1</code>, <code>bar2</code>, <code>bar3</code>), and <code>Bar</code> provides a default implementation for <code>foo1</code>. That should mean that</p>

<pre>
instance Bar FB where
  foo2 = ...
  foo3 = ...
  bar1 = ...
  bar2 = ...
  bar3 = ...
</pre>

<p>should work. But would this work:</p>

<pre>
instance Foo FB where
  foo2 = ...
  foo3 = ...

instance Bar FB where
  bar1 = ...
  bar2 = ...
  bar3 = ...
</pre>

<ul>
<li>So if I declare a method as <code>native</code> in a class declaration, that just sets the <em>default</em> implementation for that method?</li>
</ul>

<p>So if I do something like</p>

<pre>
class Foobar f where
  foo :: f -> Int
  native foo

  bar :: f -> String
  native bar
</pre>

<p>then that just means that if I write an empty instance declaration for some Java native class, then <code>foo</code> maps to <code>object.foo()</code> in Java?</p>

<p>In particular, if a class method is declared as <code>native</code>, I can still provide some <em>other</em> implementation for it if I choose to?</p>

<ul>

"16451962","1","16454317","","2013-05-08 23:36:08","","1","732","<p>I'm trying to implement a simple like/unlike function. All the examples I have seen here seem to apply to ajax or jquery. I.m still a beginner and I don't fully understand either yet, I just want a simple solution.</p>

<p>My idea is, I have books and I have users. Users can like books. So I have created a many-to-many association through a Like model. The Like model has a corresponding database with book_id and user_id columns. Thus: </p>

<pre><code>class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :likes
  has_many :users, through: :likes

class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base 
  has_many :likes
  has_many :books, through: :likes

class Like &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :book
  belongs_to :user
end
</code></pre>

<p>unfortunately, this is as far as my understanding goes. I do not know how to utilize this relationship to create likes and associate them with the appropriate book and user.</p>

<p>My idea is to present the user a 'like' button if he has not liked the book, or unlike if he hasn't. So basically, I want to have something this simple:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%  if user likes? %&gt;

&lt;div class=""unlike_button""&gt;&lt;%= link_to ""Unlike"", '#' %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;% else %&gt;

&lt;div class=""like_button""&gt;&lt;%= link_to ""Like"", '#' %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I used the # stub because I have no idea what route it should use. But whatever the solution is, I would like it to redirect to the same page with a flash notice saying ""liked"" or ""Unlike"". 
I already have div background images for the like_button and unlike_button classes, which is why I implement them as image links above.</p>

<p>Any sort of guidance or help, would be deeply appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p><em>UPDATE</em></p>

<p>I'm following Bennick's guidance here below but I', still stuck in the rails console. I figure there's no point moving forward if I'm getting errors in the console.</p>

<p>As suggested, I tried this in the console:</p>

<p>As I already have users I did <code>user = User.find(1)</code>and <code>book = Book.find(1)</code></p>

<p>But on the next line  <code>like = Like.create(:user =&gt; user, :book =&gt; book)</code>the returned a mass assign error. <code>Can't mass-assign protected attributes: book, user</code>
I figured maybe this would help <code>attr_accessible :book_id, :user_id</code> in the like model but I still get errors. Am I missing something?</p>

<p><em>SOLVED</em></p>

<p>I finally got it to work! Using <code>like = Like.create(:user =&gt; user.id, :book =&gt; book.id)</code>. </p>

<p>Now I have been overloaded with the amount of virdirs I have had to create (over 500 and quickly growing) and I feel I need to move these to one (or several) application pools.

<p>I have two Entities, Person and Flag. Flag has a ManyToOne relationship to Person. Where I'm running into an issue is that Person's id field is a bigint, not a type int.</p>

<p>So, with syntax like this on the ManyToOne field on the Flag entity:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""Person"", inversedBy=""flags"")
 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""personId"", referencedColumnName=""id"")
 */
protected $person;
</code></pre>

<p>I get a Foreign Key error, something along the lines of </p>

<pre><code>An exception occurred while executing 'ALTER TABLE flags ADD CONSTRAINT FK_B0541BAA20C4B1C FOREIGN KEY
</code></pre>

<p>I believe I've exhausted all other possibilities of this error besides it being generated because the personId field is an integer and the person's ID field is a bigint. These foreign key relationships have been working fine among other entities in this bundle, its only the Person and its bigint primary key that is causing issues.</p>

<p>I can't add type=""bigint"" to JoinColumn without getting an error like:</p>

<pre><code>The annotation @ORM\JoinColumn declared on property Acme\AcmeBundle\Entity\PersonFlag::$person does not have a pro
  perty named ""type""
</code></pre>

<p>And, if I add Column annotation in order to declare the type, it just ignores the JoinColumn, as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""Person"", inversedBy=""flags"")
 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""personId"", referencedColumnName=""id"")
 * @ORM\Column(type=""bigint"")
 */
protected $person;
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't generate any errors, but it creates a column named ""person"" that has no foreign keys.</p>

<p>So, what am I missing, how can I go about adding this ManyToOne relationship to an entity that has a bigint as it's primary key?</p>

<p>Here is the annotation for the Person entity's ID field:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @ORM\Id
 * @ORM\Column(type=""bigint"")
 * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy=""AUTO"")
 */
protected $id;

<p>I need to check the values that can be accepted to a column through a check constraint. I need to use the check constraint, because this is for a college assignment.</p>

<p>I use this code to create and add the constraint to the table.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE Ereignis(
  E_Id Serial PRIMARY KEY,
  Typ varchar(15),
  Zeitpunkt timestamp,
  Ort varchar(32),
  Anzahl_Pers int
);

ALTER TABLE Ereignis ADD 
CONSTRAINT typ_ch CHECK (Typ in (’Verkehrsunfall’, ’Hochwasser’, ’Sonstiges’));
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the error I get: </p>

<pre><code> ERROR:  column ""’verkehrsunfall’"" does not exist
</code></pre>

<p>As I get from this error it tries to compare column typ with column verkehrsunfall, where as I try to check the values that column try can get is one of the (’Verkehrsunfall’, ’Hochwasser’, ’Sonstiges’) strings.</p>

<p>This is exactly the same syntax what our lecturer showed us at the lecture. I am not sure if it is possible to compare varchars with check? Or what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Here is the example from the lecture:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE Professoren

 Rang CHAR(2) CHECK (Rang in ('C2' ,'C3' ,'C4')) ,

This is done by having a placeholder string somewhere in the executable that is replaced with something user-specific upon download.</p>

<p>The webserver that has to do these string replacements is a Linux machine. For Windows, the executable is not compressed in the installer .exe, so the string replacement is easy.</p>

<p>For uncompressed Mac OS X .dmg files, this is also easy. However, .dmg files that are compressed with either gzip or bzip2 are not so easy. For example, in the latter case, the compressed .dmg is not one big bzip2-compressed disk image, but instead consists of a few different bzip2-compressed parts (with different block sizes) and a plist suffix. Also, decompressing and recompressing the different parts with bzip2 does not result in the original data, so I'm guessing Apple uses some different parameters to bzip2 than the command-line tool.</p>

<p>I understand that the Skype API allows me to answer and receive keypad input, but I'm stuck on actually sending the sound of the call to a SIP client.</p>

<p>Is there an <strong>API/library</strong> that would allow me to take the Skype receiving audio as input in the SIP client? </p>

<p>Is this even possible?</p>

<p>I'm not tied to a language but I had planned on using Python.</p>

The problem I could not fix so far is, that the tab content does not get updated after AJAX calls. In the debugger I see that GetData() gets called and returns the up to date stats but the Glimpse UI is still showing the old tab content.</p>

<p>Here is the simplest of my pages returning a plain object with a few prop in it (database command counter, etc. - nothing fancy).</p>

<pre><code>public class GlimpseTabOverview : TabBase
{
    public override string Name

        return WebStatisticsHelper.GetBasicStatsData();
    }
}

<p><strong>For example:</strong> 
I want to make a database for a group of workshops I am offering with a form users can fill out online. Each workshop has its own table to collect user information (name, email, address etc.) that I can use to create individual reports from for internal company uses. As the user information is the same for each workshop, I ideally want just one form that users can fill out and choose which workshop they want to register for using a drop down menu rather than having to create a registration form for each workshop. This form I would like to integrate into my webpage. </p>

<p>Can access use this drop down menu to record the data into the specific workshop table? Or would I need one table that gathers the information entered by the user that will then transer the data to the workshop specific table via table relationships?</p>

The idea is to serve up a system configuration/control interface through a web browser so clients never need to install software. We can communicate with the appliance by sending and receiving serial data through the embedded module. Since the appliance can also be controlled from a front panel UI, it creates a challenge to keep a remote web interface in sync with very low latency. It seems like websockets or some sort of Push is what we need for handling real time events from the server to clients.</p>

<p>I am using a Lantronix Mathport AR embedded device server. Out of the box the unit will serve up any custom HTML and java servlets/applets. We have the option to install a lightweight Linux distro if we need more flexibility. I am not sure how to implement any server side apps since the device is not running standard Apache. I believe it is using Boa.</p>

<p>Can anyone guide me in the right direction of how to do this? </p>

WRITE(*,*) some_array(1)%p ! I see some_vector1
WRITE(*,*) some_array(2)%p ! I see some_vector2

<p>Now it's cumbersome for me to actually declare each of these <code>some_vector</code> arrays to correspond to each element in my array of arrays.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is have in a separate subroutine where a temporary vector is set as a target, and that subroutine sets up my array of arrays to point to that temporary vector.</p>

<p>This way I can have anonymous arrays.</p>

<p>However, this doesn't seem to be working and I wonder if first if I am doing something that Fortran doesn't support.</p>

<li>There will be nothing in the string except digits and lower-case letters</li>

How can I keep a ""running count"" of letters such that when it passes three, it becomes a non-match?  Right now all I can think of is to write <code>[a-z]+</code> a bunch of times, but this can get ugly if I want to match say, five or more letters.</p>

<p>This gets me there, but you can see how this could be ugly for longer strings.</p>

<p>My Wordpress parent theme adds a custom metabox. I need to add additional options to the metabox but I need to add the key values options from within my child theme...not in the parent theme where the array is created.</p>

<p>Adding the additional options (key values) in the parent theme is simple, but core theme files have to be changed and therefore will break when the partent theme is updated by the theme developer.</p>

<p>So I have made a child theme that handles all my custom adds...but I have no clue how to inject key vales into an array that is crated in the parent theme.</p>

<p><strong>Example Controller</strong></p>

<pre><code>define(['app/module'], function (module) {
    lazy.controller('header-controller', ['$scope', function ($scope) {
        // stuff here
    }]);
});
</code></pre>

<p>On a side note I plan on implementing something better than attaching lazy variable to window.</p>

<p>When I code the router like the first example it works.  When I use my lazyLoader the one of the two views loads it's controller, the second view's controller's file is started to load (console.logs at the beginning show this) but it cannot resolve ""module"" in the example above.</p>

<p>link to error: <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/error/ng/areq?p0=lead-download-controller&amp;p1=not%20aNaNunction,%20got%20undefined"" rel=""nofollow"">AngularJS Error</a></p>

<p>Again this issue only happens when using my lazyloader which is producing the same resolve object that I have hard coded in for the version that works.</p>

<p>I have searched high and low and there are a lot of resources out there but I could not find anything that addressed this issue.</p>

<p>Any advice is appreciated!</p>

<p>I'm fiddling around with some PHP and AJAX at the moment, to try and get the code working for an auto refreshing div (every 10 seconds), that contains comments.</p>

<p>Here is javascript code I am using to refresh the div..</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;// &lt;![CDATA[
$(document).ready(function() {
        $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false }); 
            setInterval(function() {
                    $('#content_main').load('/feed_main.php');
        }, 5000);  
});
// ]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code that will populate the div called ""content_main"", which is in feed_main.php, essentially accesses the database and echo's out the latest comments ...</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Is it possible, to only load the div ""content_main"" if the data inside of it, hasn't changed since the last time it was loaded? </p>

<p><strong>My logic</strong></p>

<p>Because I'm relatively new to javascript and AJAX I don't quite know how to do this, but my logic is:</p>

<p>For the first time it is run..</p>

<ul>
<li>load data from feed_main.php file</li>
<li>Create a unique value (perhaps a hash value? ) to identify say 3 unique comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Every other time it is run...</p>

<ul>
<li>load the data from feed_main.php file</li>
<li>create a NEW unique value</li>
<li>check this value with the previous one </li>
<li>if they're the same, don't refresh the div, just leave things as they are, but if they're different then refresh..</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason why I want to do this is because the comments usually have pictures attached, and it is quite annoying to see the image reload every time.</p>

<p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

I use <code>Youtube Data API v3</code> to retrieve videos with the following parameters:</p>

<p><code>part=id&amp;type=video&amp;order=relevance&amp;safeSearch=strict&amp;videoSyndicated=true&amp;maxResults=1&amp;videoEmbeddable=true</code></p>

<p>However, I often get videos that throw error code 150 when played from my embedded player.
One example is the following video:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXd9MPXb6Vs"" rel=""nofollow"">Turn down for what</a></p>

<p>when played from an embedded player, it throws error 150, and the error message shown in the iframe is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the video contains content from SME. It is restricted from playback on certain sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I try the same video with the same embedded iframe player in <a href=""https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube_player_demo"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube Player demo</a> website hosted on <code>developers.google.com</code>, and it plays without the error code.</p>

<p>Therefore, I suspect the above error happens because I am trying to play the video <strong>from chrome extension</strong>, not because I am playing it from an embedded player. When I play it from the webpage hosted on my local machine (ex: file:///home/testing.page.html), I get the same error message.</p>

<p>To resolve the issue, I attempted to make YouTube think that I was a normal webpage instead of a chrome extension. By using <code>chrome.webRequest</code>, I added a referer information to the request header.</p>

<p><code>{ name: 'Referer', value: ""https://www.youtube.com"" }</code></p>

<p>Even after the requestHeader was fixed, the error remained. I assume it's because there's <code>origin</code> property attached to youtube iframe player that specifies where the embedded player is from, regardless of the requestHeader.</p>

<p>My objective is either to find videos that are absolutely playable, or play videos that are only playable from a webpage (can't be played from chrome extension).</p>

<p>I would appreciate any help. Thank you.</p>

<p>There are, of course, additional columns representing the status etc but I don't think they are relevant at this point.</p>

<p>In theory, the start_timestamp and end_timestamp in each record are supposed to indicate the date and time of the start and end of each status with a NULL end_timestamp indicating that the status is ongoing (in this case rows 3, 7 and 8 indicate ongoing statuses).</p>

<p>The problem I have is that in some cases (rows 4 and 5 in the example) the end_timestamp hasn't been set and to get our reporting system working properly I need to go back and set that timestamp from the start_timestamp in the next record for that resource in the set if it exists.  I.E. update row 4 from row 6 and row 5 from row 7.  Rows 3, 7 and 8 shouldn't be modified since they represent the current state of the resource.</p>

<p>Note that the row missing the end_timestamp may not be the first row for that resource_id and there may be multiple rows for one or more resources that have incorrectly NULL end_timestamps.</p>

<p>I need to do this both for the existing data and on an ongoing basis when data is added to the table (I know the creator of the data should be fixed, but for various reasons that isn't on the table at this point).</p>

<p>In case it's relevant, we're using MS SQL Server 2008 and the table currently contains just over two million rows and obviously is growing on a daily basis.</p>

"28991051","1","","","2015-03-11 15:40:27","","1","34","<p>I am working through the Zend Framework 2 tutorials in preparation to attempting to port a rather large existing application. I'm taking it piece by piece and just trying to get all the parts in their proper places inside the framework before buckling down to re-write all the code. A number of things are currently a mystery to me conceptually.</p>

<p>My existing application (circa 2006) used PHP constants to setup some basic mode/status flags that were persistent given the user's current session. The main config file did some tests to determine, for example, if the site was hosted on a production server or devel server, whether the site was in embedded mode, mobile browser mode, etc. The result of these tests was a number of boolean constants getting set.</p>

<pre><code>// Decide if we are on a development server or not
// (enables debug features and experimental functionality)
define('DEVEL', !preg_match('!^(www.)?example.com$!', $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']));

// Figure out what protocol to use when making CDN calls
define('PROTOCOL', ($_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] == 80) ? 'http' : 'https');

// Mark which DB server to use
define('DB_SERVER', DEVEL ? 'localhost' : 'db.example.com');

// If we're running inside somebody else's frameset, various bits of the
// template get left out along the way (set with URL parameter)
define('EMBEDDED', check_if_embeded());

// Determine if the browser is a mobile device
define('MOBILE', mobile_device_detect());

// Check to see what features the user has (dis|en)abled
define('SOCIAL', get_user_pref('social'))
define('COMPACT_THEME', get_user_pref('compact_theme'));
</code></pre>

<p>These various factors are then taken into consideration as the template is built and in various parts of the app as they decide how much information should be spit out.</p>

<pre><code>if (!MOBILE) {
    // Include code only runs on the full site
    if (SOCIAL) {
        // Include links social media tools
    }
}

if (COMPACT_THEME) {
    // Include extra style-sheet with smaller margins
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some of these have more logical places for them to be. For example the database server details go in the config for the module that will be making database calls. The embedded flag was, in this case, coming out of the URL, so I think that's going to get transfered into the router system somehow, and I'm thinking will be a different view altogether, although this seems like a good way to repeat code.</p>

<p>What isn't clear to me is what do do with the more generic state flags. A lot of these were used in the page layout templates. I could just hack some of them into the main application views and layout template, but that doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>At a conceptual level for a site attempting to follow an MVC pattern with ZF2, what would these flags be? Where would they be set and at what point in the pattern would they be checked?</p>

<p>I've this layout in my project and AndroidStudio underlines in red the part (@+id/mylistview)  but everything works fine,
I can inflate the XML and also findViewById(R.id.mylistview);
Can't figure out the problem, by placing the mouse over I get this message
""Top level element is not completed"".
By changing ListView with ExpandableListView the error disappear.</p>

<p>Because I want to add a field in my ProfileFormType that depends on the value of an attribute of the user. Since you cant get the user from a FormType, I wanted to override the formFactory in order to pass the current user through the option array. So, that's exactly what have been done  in the previous subject.</p>

<p>But I get an error : ""The option ""user"" does not exist. Known options are: ""action"", ""attr"", ""auto_initialize"", ""block_name"", ""by_reference"", ""cascade_validation"",etc...""
So I guess that I could have made a mistake or that it could have been a typo in services names in the previous post. So I'd like that you check if you find anything suspicious in my code (IMO, I am not sure with buildForm/buildUserForm thing). Here are my sources, thank you!</p>

<pre><code>singleFunction {
   // code to sort
   // code to sum

   return sumAndSquare();
}

sumAndSqaure() {
   // sum
   return square();
}

square() {
   // return square.
}

<p>Now I realize sort, sum and square can be used as <code>utility methods</code> rather than simply <code>helper</code> methods.</p>

<p>Now I break down functionality into 3 functions (1) sort (2) sum x (3) square()</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Looks like option 3 is the best of the lot, still so many times we find a function calling another. What is an advantage of option 2 over option 3 ? </p></li>
<li><p>A method by definition is supposed to do a single task/responsibility. but <code>somefunction</code> is doing  3 different things. What are such functions called ? </p></li>

<p>I want to have my own Utility Navigation in my application, sounds easy enough, there is some documentation pointing to this on the main <a href=""http://www.activeadmin.info/docs/1-general-configuration.html#utility_navigation"" rel=""nofollow"">ActiveAdmin documentation page</a>.</p>

<p>Makes sense, and should probably simple enough...</p>

<pre><code>ActiveAdmin.setup do |config|
  config.namespace :admin do |admin|
    admin.build_menu :utility_navigation do |menu|
      menu.add label: ""ActiveAdmin.info"", url: ""http://www.activeadmin.info"", html_options: { target: :blank }
      admin.add_logout_button_to_menu menu # can also pass priority &amp; html_options for link_to to use
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>BUT, I have...</p>

<pre><code>config.default_namespace = false
</code></pre>

<p>which sort of turns off the</p>

<pre><code>config.namespace :admin do |admin|
</code></pre>

<p>bit of code.</p>

<p>My assumption was to just go back to using the standard non-namespace version for configuration, much like so many other parts of the configuration system and just use.</p>

<pre><code>ActiveAdmin.setup do |config|
  config.build_menu :utility_navigation do |menu|
    menu.add label: ""ActiveAdmin.info"", url: ""http://www.activeadmin.info"", html_options: { target: :blank }
    config.add_logout_button_to_menu menu # can also pass priority &amp; html_options for link_to to use
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>BUT, of course I get <code>undefined method 'build_menu'</code>.</p>

<p>So, I have to assume that I am missing something simple, and at the moment I am not sure what that simple thing is.</p>

<p>If anyone out there has any suggestions, please let me know.</p>

<pre><code>unsafeWindow.dojo.version // 1.7 (wrong version)
unsafeWindow.frames[0].dojo // undefined 
unsafeWindow.frames[0].window.dojo // undefined
window.frames[0].window.dojo // undefined
window.frames[0].unsafeWindow // undefined

        amt = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.i_have_row_amount);
        icon.setOnClickListener(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        delete(getPosition());        
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The delete method is as follows</p>

<pre><code>public void delete(int position){
    data.remove(position);
    notifyItemRemoved(position);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now what I want is, whenever an item gets deleted from <code>i_have</code>, it should automatically get added to the <code>to_buy</code> and vice verse. </p>

<p>I have created an <code>add</code> method in the adapter of <code>to_buy</code> class </p>

<pre><code>public void add(String s){
    Information2 information2 = new Information2();
    information2.name2 = s;
    information2.iconId2 = R.drawable.potatoes;
    information2.amount = ""1KG"";
    data2.add(0,information);
    notifyDataSetChanged();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I am confused how to call this method from the adapter of <code>i_have</code> class. As it is a non-static method, which object should I use to call the add method? I created an object of another class but I am not sure where should I reference it to?</p>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>I implemented what yshahsk said in the answer but I need to add a parameter in <code>MyViewHolder</code> call. </p>

<p>The <code>onCreateViewHolder()</code> is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public MyViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.i_have_row, parent, false);

    MyViewHolder holder = new MyViewHolder(view);
    return holder;
}
</code></pre>

<p>[EDIT2]</p>

<p>As requested</p>

<p>here is my adapter file <code>infoAdapter</code> for the i_have fragment.</p>

<p>If I use the default registration controller I get redirected:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>/users/edit</strong> to <strong>root</strong> when user update <strong>succeeds</strong></li>
<li><strong>/users/edit</strong> to <strong>/users</strong> when update <strong>fails</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the default controller update action looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>if resource_updated
  sign_in resource_name, resource, bypass: true
  respond_with resource, location: after_update_path_for(resource)
else
  clean_up_passwords resource
  respond_with resource
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>after_update_path_for</code> is set by default to <code>root</code></p>

<p>If update <strong>fails</strong> I get the devise error messages and <code>hasError</code> div wrappers for the fields with error</p>

<p>In my <code>registrations controller</code> in the <code>edit</code> action I attribute values to a variable <code>@myvar={2, 3}</code></p>

<p>This variable is used in the <code>registrations_edit</code> <strong>view</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Whenever user update fails I get error <code>no method .each for nil</code></strong> for my <code>@myvar</code> </p>

<p>How should I declare my view variables such that they are accessible even when update form fails?!</p>

<p>I have tried:</p>

<p>Forcing the controller to redirect to <code>edit</code> view no matter what:</p>

<pre><code>if resource_updated
  sign_in resource_name, resource, bypass: true
  redirect_to edit_user_registration_path
else
  clean_up_passwords resource
  redirect_to edit_user_registration_path

<p>1 - I'm using the BorderLayout. Do I need to have 2 JPanels to separate components (JLabel and JButtons) if I want to have the JLabel in the North and the JButtons in the Center? Or is there any way to use just one JPanel?</p>

<p>2 - I want to take out the setBounds used in my JButtons and use some Layout in order to have my JButtons like that in the middle of the screen. How could I do that?</p>

If you run this code and move your mouse really fast or change directions fast, the coordinates might look this: 50 and then 40. It seems that when the mouse moves fast it doesn't track all the points the pointer covers, like in this example there are 10 coordinates that it skips. If I move it slowly, there's no problem. I need a way to track all the pointer coordinates with no skips. I've tried the sample on Code Project that uses global hooks, with the same result. How can I do this? Is there a registry change that can be made that forces windows to track all the coordinates. Is it possible? I would prefer to do it with C# but will consider other ways too. Thanks.</p>

<p>The problem is that in English, it's ok to say ""less than a minute ago"" but in Japanese, ""1分以内 前"" doesn't work. That ""ago"" translation shouldn't be there basically, but it should after one minute (without a space between characters).</p>

<p>Right now I'm generating that text with <code>&lt;%= ""#{distance_of_time_in_words_to_now(message.created_at)} #{t(:ago, scope: 'datetime.distance_in_words')}"" %&gt;</code> but this is incorrect for different locales, so I am thinking of either writing my own helper method to support this slight i18n issue.</p>

<p>Before I do so, however, I'm wondering if there already is something like this included in Rails 4?</p>

<p>One of the reasons I'm reluctant to write my own is because I'm having problems with time zones and ranges:</p>

<pre><code>from_time = Time.zone.now
to_time = t1 + 30
range = t1..t2
range.include? Time.zone.now
</code></pre>

<p>returns <code>~/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247/gems/activesupport-4.0.0/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:368: warning: Time#succ is obsolete; use time + 1</code></p>

<p>So I believe i must be doing this the wrong way.
Anyone know if this is already inbuilt somewhere in Rails 4 or if not, any tips on a good way to deal with the time range?</p>

<p>I am writing a program in Delphi that is a TUI menu-driven program for a local business client. They have asked me to keep the user interface the same as in the old program (written in BASIC for MS-DOS, dated in 1982) so it is all menu driven with global data being stored in files and reloaded by the program. Each sub-menu is a program in and of itself run by the active menu (also a program).</p>

<p>I have written my own TUI framework and UI manager for displaying menus and sub-menus.  The UI manager contains an overridden method called ""Draw"" to display the menu and another overridden method called ""OnEvent"" which handles keyboard events in the UI.  <strong>My first question is would you consider this to be an appropriate method for making a menu-driven program containing sub-menus?</strong> An example of how this works is such:</p>

<pre><code>type
  TMenu1 = class(TExtendedUIManager)
  private
    procedure OnEvent (c: Char); override;
  end;

type
  TSubMenu1 = class(TExtendedUIManager)
  end;

procedure TMenu1.OnEvent (c: Char);
var
  Next: TExtendedUIManager;
begin
  if c = '2' then begin
    Next := TSubMenu1.Create;
    Self.Start(Next);
    Next.Free;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My other question is what would be an appropriate way of sharing data between menus?</strong> For example, if I wanted my TSubMenu1 class to return a string when a method is called, how would I make it accessible to other sub-menus that do not interact with it? (Sorry if the question is vague). I have the Singleton pattern in mind but I've also thought of having the UI manager store a reference to some object for data storage and each time a new sub-menu is run, pass in the reference to the new sub-menu (UI manager). The conundrum is finding out which one works best. Or even if my menu-driven framework is decent.</p>

<p>Opinions are welcomed and any advice is appreciated.  Thanks for your time and help!</p>

<p>The idea is to be able to allow users to retrieve a simulated record from the database, interact with it by adding child records that represent procedure notes, messages to other people and the like, and at the end of the session display the changes and additions that were made. After all of that the ""template"" record will need to be able to be reset to its original state, returning to the state it was in before the user worked with it.</p>

<p>Multiple users will use the same ""template"" record in different simulation rooms, so changes made by one user should not affect the data available to other users.</p>

<p>I have already developed much of the application using generated scaffolding that I have modified to produce the basic functionality of the record system. </p>

<p>Now I need to figure out the ""simulation mode"" functionality which allows a user to ""tear off"" a copy of a record that will be thrown away after changes are made at the end of a session.</p>

<p>I am thinking I will need to store copies of the patient and its child objects in session variables. Are there any examples available to that show how to store copies of objects in session variables and modify and add to those objects using forms? Any help and advice would be very appreciated.</p>

<p>how can I handle it, to get Javascript is working after the Ajax call?   </p>

<p>On my page (wordpress) - I have all posts on startpage. I have built in a filtersystem with which the user can filter the posts after specific stuff - like ""newest, most viewed, highlighted"" </p>

<p>I use this function beneath to make this filter work:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
    $.ajaxSetup({cache:false});
    $(""#new"").click(function(){

        var post_id = $(this).attr(""rel"")
        $("".postbox_wrapper"").html('&lt;span class=""filter_posts""&gt;
&lt;img src=""&lt;?php bloginfo ('template_directory'); ?&gt;/images/287.gif""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;');
        $("".postbox_wrapper"").load(jQuery(this).attr(""href"") + "" .postbox_wrapper"")
        return false;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The visitior clicks on the button ""new"" and the posts are filtered - only the newest posts show up. But I use Javascript to have the post count of disqus, lazy image loader, etc. these JS Files are not loaded on the filtered posts. (taxonomy.php)</p>

<p>this here is e.g. an JS File, which would be neccessary to make lazy loader available to the filtered posts: </p>

<pre><code>http://myurl/../plugins/bj-lazy-load/js/bjll.min.js?ver=0.4.0
</code></pre>

<p>The question is: How can I tell in the function above, to also use the JS script on the new loaded ""filtered"" page.</p>

<p>It's a bit like this: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1628065/use-ajax-function-in-jquery-to-load-part-of-an-external-page-into-div"">Use Ajax() function in Jquery to load PART of an external page into div</a></p>

I narrowed the problem down to a single type of computation: assigning to multiple struct properties.</p>

<p>For example, even self assignment of this form eventually causes a seg fault when executed several thousand times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[my_class_instance.my_struct_vector.my_property] = my_class_instance.my_struct_vector.my_property;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I initially assumed this must be a memory leak of some sort, so tried printing out java's free memory after every iteration, but this remained fairly constant.</p>

<p>So yeah, completely at a loss now as to why this breaks :-/</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: the following changes fixes the seg faulting:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>temp = [my_class_instance.my_struct_vector];</p>
  
  <p>[temp.my_property] = temp.my_property;</p>
  
  <p>[my_class_instance.my_struct_vector] = temp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The question is now why this would fix anything. Something about repeated accessing a handle class rather than a struct list perhaps?</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2: THE PLOT THICKENS</strong></p>

<p>I've finally replicated the problem and the work around using a dummy program simple enough to post here:</p>

<p>a simple class:</p>

<pre><code>classdef test_class
    properties
        test_prop
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And a program that makes a bunch of vector assignments with the class, and will always crash.</p>

<pre><code>test_instance = test_class();
test_instance.test_prop = struct('test_field',{1 1});
for i=1:10000

    [test_instance.test_prop.test_field] = test_instance.test_prop.test_field;
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3: THE PLOT THINS</strong></p>

<p>Turns out I found a bug. According to Matlab tech support, repeated vector assignment of class properties simply won't work in R2011a (and presumably in earlier version). He told me it works fine in R2012a, and then mentioned the same workaround I discovered: use a temporary variable.</p>

<p><strong>So yeah...</strong></p>

<p>pretty sure this question ends with that support ticket, but if any daring individuals want to take a shot as to WHY this bug exists at all, I'd definitely still be interested in such an answer. (learning is fun!)</p>

<p>The method itself performs rather well and both the RegExp and String based searches are quite comparable as to the execution time (both ~2ms on the entire vast Ray Bradbury's ""451 Fahrenheit"" searching for all the ""the""s).</p>

<p>What sort of bothers me, though, is the impossibility of changing the flag of the supplied RegExp instance. There is no point in calling <em>String.prototype.match</em> in this function without the global flag of the supplied Regular Expression set to true, as it would only note the first occurance then. You could certainly set the flag manually on each RegExp passed to the function, I'd however prefer being able to clone and then manipulate the supplied Regular Expression's flags.</p>

<p>Astonishingly enough, I'm not permitted to do so as the <em>RegExp.prototype.global</em> flag (more precisely all flags) appear to be read-only. Thence the commented-out line 8. </p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>Is there a <em>nice</em> way of changing the flags of a RegExp object?</strong></p>

<p>I don't really wanna do stuff like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(!expression.global)
  expression = eval(expression.toString() + ""g"");
</code></pre>

<p>Some implementations might not event support the <em>RegExp.prototype.toString</em> and simply inherit it from the <em>Object.prototype</em>, or it could be a different formatting entirely. And it just seems as a bad coding practice to begin with.</p>

    navigationBar = UINavigationBar.appearance

<p>I have defined an abstract entity class which includes the graph id:</p>

<pre><code>@NodeEntity
public abstract class DBEntity {
  @GraphId private Long id;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is a data model with a parent and a child both defined as Spring components.
I have simplified the data model here, in reality it is a tree with several child nodes and levels:</p>

<pre><code>@Component(""DataModel"")
@Scope(""prototype"")
public class DataModel extends DBEntity {
  @Autowired private DataStructure dataStructure;
  public TestDataStructure testDataStructure;
}

@Component(""DataStructure"")
@Scope(""prototype"")
public class DataStructure extends DBEntity {
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>For testing purposes, I have also defined a test data structure without Spring annotations:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestDataStructure extends DBEntity {
  private String test;
  public TestDataStructure() {
    this.test = ""test"";
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is also the definition of my repository and the database service implementation:</p>

<pre><code>@Repository
public interface DataModelRepository extends GraphRepository&lt;DBEntity&gt; {
  DBEntity save(DBEntity entity);
}

public class DatabaseServiceImpl implements DatabaseService {
  @Autowired private DataModelRepository modelRepository;
  public void putModel(DBEntity entity) {
   modelRepository.save(Entity);    
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when I call putModel with an Spring-managed instance of DataModel, it will save the
DataModel instance and also an instance of TestDataStructure as nodes with 1:1 relationship. The instance of DataStructure and the relationship to the instance of DataModel will not be saved, although it is not null in the program.</p>

<p>How can I achieve to save the whole DataModel? Probably Spring interferes with the Neo4j mapping. I am not sure, why autowired properties might get lost in the cloning process or whatever Neo4j uses to get the data. Maybe someone can shed some light on this?</p>

My data-set is based on group membership (i.e a list of people and the groups to which they belong).  For example:</p>

<pre>
   G1 G2 G3 G4
P1 1     1  
P2 1     1  
P3    1     1
P4    1     1
</pre>

<p>I'm looking for a sorting algorithm that will give me this:</p>

<pre>

   G1 G3 G2 G4
P1 1  1     
P2 1  1    
P3       1   1
P4       1   1
</pre>

<p>Another example of ""sorted"" data can be found here: <a href=""http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/ex/matrix.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/ex/matrix.html</a>
In this example, the creators reference a ""community-detection algorithm"" used for sorting.  My data is different since there will be no memberships between dimensions (i.e. the first dimension (persons) are members of the second dimension (groups).</p>

<p>I've found a paper that discusses this in great detail: <a href=""http://ricerca.mat.uniroma3.it/users/colanton/docs/visual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ricerca.mat.uniroma3.it/users/colanton/docs/visual.pdf</a> (warning: PDF)</p>

<p>So in summary I'm taking membership data, trying to find ""communities"" within the data, and representing that visually.</p>

Installer copies all files of my program to <code>c:/Program files/Program_name</code>. When I run it from shortcut, an error appears that <code>can't overwrite some file</code>. I think this is a permission error because my program is in OS partition. I have some functions like <code>mget</code> , <code>mput</code> and <code>fprintf</code> for some text files in that directory and some times my software download some files from <code>FTP</code> and copy them in discoursed directory.</p>

<p>When you copy some codes that have functions like these and run your code from <code>C:/ (OS partition)</code>, you have this problem (without using any installer). I need an automatic solution because this program is going to install on some computers.</p>

<p>We have developed a RESTful API to our Drupal application, and we currently have an iOS app out in the App Store that's using ASIHTTPRequest to connect to it.  However, as some of you may know, it's no longer being supported. So we decided to transition over to AFNetworking and would like to build it in such a way that we can open source it as a library to use with our API.  </p>

<p>Our current application is using CoreData and stores all data coming in to a SQLite database.  The workflow at the moment looks something like this:</p>

<p>Get Request 
Receive JSON
Parse and map JSON to CoreData NSManagedObject
Save Context</p>

<p>I have several questions on what path you guys would suggest for me to open source as a library.</p>

<p>Just to give a rough overview:</p>

<p>We have Members, Groups, Events, Messages (at its simplest).</p>

<p>There are several ways I've been thinking of going about this:</p>

<p><strong>Add the AFNetworking api calls and the parsing / mapping methods to the NSManagedObject</strong></p>

<p>I like this concept, but I'm not sure if it makes sense.  Core data schema then becomes the schema to the API and that's wonderful.  But my concern is - what if other developers using this don't want to use core data in their app? On top of that, I'm not sure how it would look with methods that return more than one instance.  For example if I have an NSManagedObject Group, where do I put the call to get an index of groups? Also, are we then locking someone into a specific core data model, and is that a good thing?</p>

<p><strong>Have separate objects that know how to retrieve their own data from an API, parse it to their own properties, and then somewhere out of the public library do the mapping to the NSManaged Objects</strong></p>

<p>This way sounds good too, but then I have very similar objects with very similar properties.</p>

<p><strong>Categories</strong></p>

<p>I read something up here where I can use a category to add methods
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9900155/add-additional-properties-to-nsmanagedobject-with-secondary-h-m-files"">add additional properties to NSManagedObject with secondary .h .m files</a>
I'm not sure if that even makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>An API Class, A Core Data Class, and mapper classes.</strong></p>

<p>Definitely messy.</p>

<p><strong>Better suggestions welcome!</strong></p>

<p>I've tried to look at some other examples, but I don't think I have enough Objective C knowledge to dissect them properly.  </p>

<p>The main goals are:</p>

<p>Abstract to a request library that's re-usable in other apps.
Enforcing a schema for objects is a plus

<li>While editing, then I click on a link, the input element in the cell loses focus and editing is stopped. It seems like the input element is removed from the dom.</li>

There are 4 events on a CellEditing plugin: beforeedit, canceledit, edit and validateedit. None of them is fired while the input element is displayed.</li>
<li>There is a method Ext.grid.plugin.CellEditingView.startEditByPosition but I think this selects only the cell which should be edited.</li>

<p>I'm stuck on implementing the following callback.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>Ok thanks to @Chris I got it working. <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/B5BrE/5/"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is the code on JsFiddle</a></p>

<p>The solution is to use a CustomEditor (a Picker to be precise) which overlays the normal TextField:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('CustomEditorField', {
    extend: 'Ext.form.field.Picker',
    alias: 'widget.customeditorfield',
    // ...
    createPicker: function() {
        var me = this,
            format = Ext.String.format;
        return Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {
            // ...
            items: [
                {
                    xtype: 'textfield',
                    name: 'description'
                }, Ext.create('Ext.view.View', {
                    listeners: {
                        itemclick: function(view, link) {
                            var textToInsert = link.data.placeholder,
                                textInField = me.picker.getForm().getValues()['description'],
                                position = me.picker.getEl().query('input')[0].selectionStart;

                            var changedText = textInField.substring(0, position) +
                                              textToInsert  + textInField.substring(position);

For an exercize, I want to write a Huffman encoding. Currently I'm trying to write a proof that the ""flattening"" of the code tree produces a prefix code, but has got stuck with the quantifiers.</p>

<p>I have a simple inductive proposition that one list is a prefix of an another:</p>

<pre><code>using (xs : List a, ys : List a)
    data Prefix : List a -&gt; List a -&gt; Type where
        pEmpty : Prefix Nil ys
        pNext  : (x : a) -&gt; Prefix xs ys -&gt; Prefix (x :: xs) (x :: ys)
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this a valid approach? Or something like ""<em>xs</em> is prefix of <em>ys</em> if there is <em>zs</em> such that <em>xs</em> ++ <em>zs</em> = <em>ys</em>"" would be better?</p></li>
<li><p>Was it the right way to introduce a ""forall"" quantifier (as far as I can understand, in Agda it would be something like <code>pNext : ∀ {x xs ys} → Prefix xs ys → Prefix (x :: xs) (y :: ys)</code>)? Should the pNext first argument be implicit? What is the semantic differences between two variants?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then, I want to build one for a vector where none of elements forms a prefix of another:</p>

<pre><code>data PrefVect : Vect n (List a) -&gt; Type where
</code></pre>

<p>Empty vector has no prefixes:</p>

<pre><code>    pvEmpty : PrefVect Nil
</code></pre>

<p>and given an element x, a vector xs, and proofs that none element of xs is a prefix of x (and vice versa), x :: xs will hold that property:</p>

<pre><code>    pvNext  : (x : [a]) -&gt; (xs : Vect n [a]) -&gt;
              All (\y =&gt; Not (Prefix x y)) xs -&gt;
              All (\y =&gt; Not (Prefix y x)) xs -&gt;
              PrefVect (x :: xs)
</code></pre>

<p>This is an unvalid type which I hope to fix after dealing with the first one, but there is similar question about quantifiers in pvNext: is this variant acceptable, or there is a better way to form a ""negation on relation""?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I've created a simple test API controller:</p>

<pre><code>public class HomeApiController : ApiController
{
    [HttpPost]
    public string Test(TestObject test)
    {
        return test.name + ""asdf"";

    public class TestObject
    {
        public string name;
    }
}

<p>And I'm trying to get the following $.post() working. This is exactly how I did it in MVC4 and it worked fine. </p>

<pre><code>var data = { name: 'owen' };
$.post('/api/HomeApi/Test/', data)
.done(function (result) {
    console.log(result);
});
</code></pre>

<p>But the name always comes through as null and I just get ""asdf"" as the result. I've also tried JSON.stringify(data).</p>

<p>But if I use $.ajax() like this, it works fine and I get ""owenasdf"" as the result.</p>

<pre><code>var data = { name: 'owen' };
$.ajax({
    url: ""/api/HomeApi/Test/"",
    type: ""POST"",
    data: JSON.stringify(data),
    dataType: ""json"",
    contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
    success: function (result) {
        console.log(result);
    },
    error: function () {
        alert(""An error has occured!!!"");
    }
});

<p>I've spent half a day looking through google and all I can find is examples of $.ajax(), and I really don't want to have to go through all my old code and change $.post() to $.ajax(). $.post() is so much easier!</p>

<p>Can someone tell me why $.post() is no longer working?</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>When I inspect the posts in fiddler, these are the differences:</p>

<p>POST (using JSON.stringify() and without, same result)</p>

<p>I've echoed all of the POSTS and know they have the proper data. The important POST variable here, is $_POST['query'] because it contains:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM crts WHERE id='$crtid'

<p>Then, from another file (excuse the sloppy variable names, this is a WIP):</p>

<pre><code>    $that = mysqli_fetch_assoc(mysqli_query($conn,""SELECT * FROM awards WHERE id=2""));
echo $that['query'].'&lt;br&gt;';

<pre><code>&lt;section id=""introduction""&gt;
&lt;h2 class=""h2Article"" id=""a1"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#b1""&gt;&lt;span class=""Article""&gt;&lt;span class=""label label-primary""&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span   class=""only-collapsed glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=""only-expanded glyphicon glyphicon-remove-sign""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=""divArticle collapse in article"" id=""b1""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>But I have hundreds of articles to put into my database, and writing all that code would take forever. So I put this in my database instead... </p>

<pre><code>&lt;section id=""introduction""&gt;
&lt;h2 class=""h2Article""&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=""divArticle""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I want to use regex or DOM to insert the missing values (preferably regex, as it's easier to work with). In fact, it was working, but now it isn't. </p>

<hr>

<p>This is my regex script: </p>

<pre><code>$Content = preg_replace('/&lt;h2 class=""h2Article""&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/h2&gt;/', '&lt;h2  class=""h2Article""&gt;&lt;span class=""Article""&gt;&lt;span class=""label label-primary""&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=""only-collapsed glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=""only-expanded glyphicon glyphicon-remove-sign""&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/small&gt; $1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;', $Content);
$Content = preg_replace('/&lt;h3 class=""h3Article"" id=""(.*?)""&gt;(.*?) &lt;\/h3&gt;/', '&lt;h3 id=""$1"" class=""Article""&gt;&lt;span class=""label label- default""&gt;$2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;', $Content);
$Content = preg_replace('/&lt;div class=""divArticle""&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/div&gt;/', '&lt;div  class=""divArticle""&gt;$1&lt;div style=""margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 150%;  text-align: center;""&gt;&lt;span class=""only-expanded glyphicon glyphicon-remove- sign""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', $Content); 

$Content = str_replace('&lt;!-- EndMainDiv --&gt;', '&lt;div class=""divClose""  style=""margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;""&gt;&lt;span  class=""only-expanded glyphicon glyphicon-remove-sign""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--  EndMainDiv --&gt;', $Content); 
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what the resulting HTML looks like: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;section id=""introduction""&gt;
&lt;h2 class=""h2Article""&gt;&lt;span class=""Article""&gt;&lt;span class=""label label- primary""&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=""only-collapsed glyphicon glyphicon-chevron- down""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=""only-expanded glyphicon glyphicon-remove-sign""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=""divArticle""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>This is my DOM script: </p>

<pre><code>$i = 1; // initialize counter
// initialize DOMDocument
$dom = new DOMDocument;
@$dom-&gt;loadHTML($Content); // load the markup 

$sections = $dom-&gt;getElementsByTagName('section'); // get all section tags
if($sections-&gt;length &gt; 0) { // if there are indeed section tags inside
// work on each section
foreach($sections as $section) { // for each section tag

// $section-&gt;setAttribute('id', '#a' . $i); // set id for section tag
// get div inside each section

foreach($section-&gt;getElementsByTagName('h2') as $h2) {
if($h2-&gt;getAttribute('class') == 'h2Article') { // if this div has class maindiv
$h2-&gt;setAttribute('id', 'a' . $i); // set id for div tag
$h2-&gt;setAttribute('data-target', '#b' . $i);
// $h2-&gt;setAttribute('data-target', '#b' . $i . ',#c' . $i);
}
}

foreach($section-&gt;getElementsByTagName('div') as $div) {
if($div-&gt;getAttribute('class') == 'divArticle') { // if this div has  class divArticle
$div-&gt;setAttribute('id', 'b' . $i); // set id for div tag
}

if($div-&gt;getAttribute('class') == 'divClose') { // if this div has class maindiv
$div-&gt;setAttribute('data-target', '#b' . $i); // set id for div tag
}

}

$i++; // increment counter
}
}

// back to string again, get all contents inside body
$Content = '';
foreach($dom-&gt;getElementsByTagName('body')-&gt;item(0)-&gt;childNodes as $child) {
$Content .= $dom-&gt;saveHTML($child); // convert to string and append to  the container
}

$Content = str_replace('data-target', 'data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target', $Content);
// $Content = str_replace('data-target', 'class=""SecCon"" data- toggle=""collapse"" data-target', $Content);
$Content = str_replace('&lt;div class=""divArticle', '&lt;div  class=""divArticle collapse in article', $Content); 
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what the HTML looks like: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;section id=""introduction""&gt;
&lt;h2 class=""h2Article"" id=""a1"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data- target=""#b1""&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=""divArticle collapse in article"" id=""b1""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>The weird thing is, it works when I use the regex and DOM script BOTH, but that's going to be kind of sloppy to work with. Can anyone tell me how to modify either my regex or my DOM to make it do the job by itself?</p>

My only apparent option is something that runs periodically checking all the users signatures against what my script would generate and updating if needed, but that's hardly efficient and creates a potential timelapse in the waiting period meaning when people want things 'done now' (which is of course, every request), it will mean I manually trigger the job; effectively bringing me back to my original solution.</p>

I'm using a code generator to generate structs and serialization code for a message passing system I wrote. In order to have a way of easily allocating a message based on it's message id I have my code generator ouput something similar to the following for each message type:</p>

<pre><code>MessageAllocator s_InputPushUserControllerMessageAlloc(INPUT_PUSH_USER_CONTROLLER_MESSAGE_ID, (AllocateMessageFunc)Create_InputPushUserControllerMessage);
</code></pre>

<p>The MessageAllocator class basically looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>MessageAllocator::MessageAllocator( uint32_t messageTypeID, AllocateMessageFunc func )
{
    if (!s_map) s_map = new std::map&lt;uint32_t, AllocateMessageFunc&gt;();
    if (s_map-&gt;insert(std::make_pair(messageTypeID, func)).second == false)
    {
    	//duplicate key!
    	ASSERT(false, L""Nooooo!"");
    }
    s_count++;
}

MessageAllocator::~MessageAllocator()
{
    s_count--;
    if (s_count == 0) delete s_map;
}
</code></pre>

<p>where s<code>_</code>map and s<code>_</code>count are static members of MessageAllocator. This works most of the time but sometimes messages are not added to the map. For example, this particular message is not added unless i call Create<code>_</code>InputPushUserControllerMessage() somewhere in my startup code, however other messages work fine. I thought this might be something to do with the linker incorrectly thinking the type is unreferenced and removing it so I disabled that using the /OPT:NOREF switch (I'm using Visual Studio 2008 SP1) but that had no effect.</p>

<p>I'm aware of the problem of the ""static initialization order fiasco"" but as far as I know the order in which these objects are created shouldn't alter the result so this seems ok to me.</p>

<p>Any insight here would be appreciated.</p>

But it seems that I get IOException in approximately about 5 minutes (I tried different file size, sleep the thread for 30s for each file etc, and only the time seems to be consistent). </p>

            out.close();
            writeChannel.closeFinally();
            Thread.sleep(30000);

<p>In the google cloud storage bucket, 11 files are written and are good (each has 160 bytes), and the request fails on creation of the twelfth file. For my real application, it will fail on writeChannel.closeFinally(). </p>

<p>My two arrays:</p>

<pre><code>    var arr = new Array(""Sally works at Taco Bell"", ""Tom drives a red car"", ""Tom is from Ohio"", ""Alex is from Ohio"");

    var keywords = new Array(""Tom"", ""Ohio"");
</code></pre>

<p>How can I filter the <code>arr</code> array using the <code>keywords</code> array in jQuery? In this situation it would filter out ""Sally works at Taco Bell"" and keep the rest.</p>

<p>Below is the actual code I am using.  </p>

<pre><code>var keywords= [];
var interval = """";
var pointer = '';
var scroll = document.getElementById(""tail_print"");

$(""#filter_button"").click(
function(){
    var id = $(""#filter_box"").val(); 
    if(id == ""--Text--"" || id == """"){
        alert(""Please enter text before searching."");
    }else{
        keywords.push(id);
        $(""#keywords-row"").append(""&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=\""images/delete.png\"" class=\""delete_filter\"" /&gt; "" + id + ""&lt;/td&gt;"");
    }
}
);

$("".delete_filter"").click(
function(){
   ($(this)).remove(); 
}
);

function startTail(){
clearInterval(interval);
interval = setInterval(
function(){
    $.getJSON(""ajax.php?function=tail&amp;pointer="" + pointer + ""&amp;nocache="" + new Date(),
        function(data){
            pointer = data.pointer;
            $(""#tail_print"").append(data.log);
            scroll.scrollTop = scroll.scrollHeight;
        });
}, 1000);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The whole purpose of this is to allow the user to filter log results. So the user performs an action that starts <code>startTail()</code> and <code>$.getJSON()</code> retrieves a JSON object that is built by a PHP function and prints the results. Works flawlessly. Now I want to give the user the option to filter the incoming tailing items. The user clicks a filter button and jQuery takes the filter text and adds it to the <code>keywords</code> array then the <code>data.log</code> from the JSON object is filtered using the <code>keywords</code> array and then appended to the screen.</p>

<p>I also have a delete filter function that isn't working. Maybe someone can help me with that. </p>

The complexity here is that the <strong>filter can contain</strong> <strong>more than once the same object</strong>. Here is my code:</p>

    #loop over each cs variable
    for nb in range(1,4):

        if code_sect is not None:
            qs_acts._result_cache.append(act)
print ""qs_acts""
for act in qs_acts:
    print act.pk, act.act.com_proc, act.propos_origine
</code></pre>

<p>I use a dynamic <code>queryset</code> with <code>_result_cache</code> because each object can be present in the filter up to three times (once for each <code>cs</code> variable). I don't know how to reproduce that with a normal filtering.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>9429 Oral procedure COM
9429 Oral procedure COM
9697 Written procedure COM
12352 Written procedure COM
12362 Oral procedure COM
</code></pre>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>...
print filter_vars_periods
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>{'act__com_proc': 'Written procedure', 'propos_origine': 'COM', 'act__adopt_conseil__gte': datetime.date(2009, 12, 1), 'act__adopt_conseil__lte': datetime.date(2013, 12, 31)}
</code></pre>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>temp_filter=qs_acts.filter(**filter_vars_periods)
for act in temp_filter:
    print act.pk, act.act.com_proc, act.propos_origine

<pre><code>9429 Oral procedure COM
9429 Oral procedure COM
9697 Written procedure COM
12352 Written procedure COM
12362 Oral procedure COM
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the filtering by the <code>com_proc=""Written procedure""</code> did not work, I get the same queryset at the end. Why?</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>I think I know why two successive filterings do not give the expected output:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8164675/chaining-multiple-filter-in-django-is-this-a-bug/8164920#8164920"">Chaining multiple filter() in Django, is this a bug?</a>
It is said that using two filters is not the equivalent of the logical <code>AND</code> but is the equivalent of the logical <code>OR</code>. So that could be the reason why my second filter doesn't filter anything...
Anyway, I still don't know how to solve my problem :(.</p>

<p>The main goal is to develop and small client  with an embedded ActiveMQ broker, the embedded broker is started by this client application
in order to receive JMS messages from several third parties applications on the same site. The client application is connected to the server through an JMS connection with a
main installation of an ActiveMQ Server(this already exists). 
I need to provide the client with an off-line capability, it means that if the client is disconnected it
should store the messages received from the third clients on the same site and send them when the server is online again. 
All seems to work right when there is no transactionality involved, but I'am having problems about the transaction boundaries of the channels configured in spring-integration.</p>

<p>The main flow is :</p>

<p>When there is not a JTA transaction manager configured and the <code>remoteJms</code> is not <code>session-transacted</code>  all works just fine, even when I simulate an offline situation the messages are correctly stored on the <code>store</code>, and when the connection with the server comes alive again (<code>remoteJms</code>) the messages are send them correctly.
But when a JTA transaction manager is configured (atomikos) and the ActiveMQ main server goes down the messages are not been stored on the <code>store</code>. I thought as soon as the pooler in <code>remoteJms</code> receive the message it starts a new  transaction, but this is not happening, it seams like the whole way from <code>jmsEventsFromClient</code> to the <code>jmsOut</code> looks like a single transaction and is failed because the <code>remoteJms</code> is down.</p>

<p>What I want is to have 2 transactions, the first should started when a message is receive on the <code>eventQueue</code> and finished when the message is leave it in the <code>remoteChannel</code> and the second should start when the message is take it from the <code>remoteChannel</code> and leave it on the <code>remoteJms</code>.
Thanks for your comments and help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> <br/>
This is happening only when the remote server is down, and the message is removed from the <code>store</code>, but that is what I don't want. </p>

<p>Add the log error.</p>

<p>iOS dev noob here..</p>

<p>I have a bunch of buttons on my main ViewController, what I want to happen is when the user clicks on one of those buttons, I want it to take them to a separate view that has a label and I want the text in that label to change according to which button they press.</p>

<p>So basically I want to be able to pass data from a button press on the main ViewController to a label in a second view.</p>

<p>That might be a bit confusing and I apologize, but any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello</p>

<p>I made a console applicaiton in C# which uses a database with Entity framework.</p>

<p>The program works just fine on my own computer, but i need the program to run 24/7, so i rented a VPS through azure.</p>

<p>The problem is, that the program is not working on the VPS. The VPS is all new, and totally clean. The only thing i installed is Microsoft SQL Server 2014 LocalDB Express 64 Bit. I get the exception in the top of this post.</p>

<p>I really have no clue whats wrong, or what i should try to do. I've been searching around, and found other threads with problems like this, but none of the solutions work so far.</p>

<p>My connectionstring in the program if that is relevant:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;add name=""BotDb""
    connectionString=""Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=BotDb;User Id=""usernameonvps"";Password=""passwordtovps"";Integrated Security=SSPI;""

The form simply collects some data, and upon submit, a PHP script compiles the data into a formatted email and sends to a designated address.</p>

<p>I am using a ""Blank Web Part Page"" (for plain HTML) and using the ""Form Web Editor"" part to place my form's code.</p>

<p>Currently what happens is after I fill out all the fields (properly), I click ""submit"", in which the action should take me to the PHP script (which has HTML within it for a confirmation page), but the page simply reloads (I assume - I just see the ""loading"" symbol on the browser tab) and then does nothing. And I get no email, so I know it's not reaching the script.</p>

<p>I have tested this using plain HTML pages, so I know that my code works (both the form code and the PHP script), so clearly there is something with Sharepoint/ASPX that is not allowing me to get the form to function properly.</p>

<p>I have tried to insert the PHP script into an actual page, but apparently neither the plain HTML editor nor the Form Editor Part will accept PHP code, because it just shows all my PHP code as plain text while the HTML for the confirmation page is intact. I have tried wrapping it in HTML tags to no avail.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have tried to simply upload the PHP script as it's own page (without embedding it, just uploading it to site content under Pages) - this didn't work. I tried the same thing again, but under Documents instead of Pages.</p>

<p>Here is my HTML Form Code:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;FORM id=""RegForm2013"" name=""htmlform"" action=""/members/member-homepage/Documents/html_form_send.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""text/plain"" &gt;

</code></pre>

<p>I pasted my code just for reference, but I'm fairly certain the issue is with Sharepoint and not the code, does anyone have any insight on how to get custom forms to function properly in Sharepoint Designer 2007, as well does anyone have guidance on how to handle getting my PHP script to be recognized by the form when submit is clicked? Any overview of how Sharepoint forms works will help! Even if it is to say that it's not possible...</p>

<p>If anyone should need to see the PHP script, let me know</p>

Declaring my bean there, everything worked as expected.

<p><em>Every time</em> I refresh the page where the table is, the AJAX request to the server <em>works</em> <strong>however</strong> if I replay the same XHR request (with Google Dev Tools) or even just doing any other action (ie. sorting, searching) the route <strong>MAY NOT</strong> work (note carefully, I have used <em>may</em> because it's really random).</p>

<p>This is the route:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>Route::group(['before' =&gt; 'auth', 'prefix' =&gt; 'api'], function()
{
    Route::get('announcements', 'AnnouncementsAPIController@getAnnouncements');
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is the controller:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>class AnnouncementsAPIController extends BaseController {

    public function getAnnouncements()
    {
        $queries = $this-&gt;request-&gt;query('queries');

        $office = (isset($queries['office']) === true) 
            ? Office::find(preg_replace(""/[^0-9]/"", """", $queries['office'])) 
            : Office::find(Auth::user()-&gt;office-&gt;id);

        $builder = $office-&gt;announcements();

        $columns = [
            'announcements.id',
            'announcements.extractor_task_id',
            'announcements.user_id',
            'announcements.office_id',
            'announcements.phone_status',
            'announcements.phone_recall',
            'announcements.created_at',
            'announcements.name',
            'announcements.phone',
            'announcements.date',
            'announcements.trademark',
            'announcements.model',
            'announcements.price',
            'announcements.city',
            'announcements.kilometers',
            'announcements.crmstate',
            'announcements.extractor_updated_at'
        ];

        $announcements = Datatablefy::prepare($builder, 'Announcement', ['columns' =&gt; $columns], Input::all());
        $announcements = $announcements-&gt;datatablefy();
        return $announcements-&gt;make(true);
    }

}

<p>This is an example URL that Datatables generates:</p>

<p>Which sometimes may randomly give:</p>

<pre><code>{

<p>Something even more weird is that using the route <em>without</em> any query string, it <em>always</em> works.</p>

<p>Something I have also noted is that if I try to decode the URL and use it, it automatically forces me out the website, logging me out.</p>

<p>Here's the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I fix the issue?</li>
<li>Why does the query string give issues?</li>
<li>Why using a decoded URL it forces me to logout?</li>

<p>The thing is the ID column of few entities is in Integer 16, but I need to be changed to Integer 32.</p>

<p>It was clearly my mistake, the model was created very long time ago, and it was only being reused. To my surprise (now) on iOS 4, Integer 16 in Core Data could easily keep number as big as 500 000 (bug?), but it doesn't work like that now - it gives me invalid numbers. </p>

<p>Application is live, has it success and Core Data is also used to keep the users scores, achievements and so on, what I don't want to remove, forcing them to reinstall the application. What is the best approach to simply change about ten of properties in different entities from Integer 16 to Integer 32? </p>

<p>Of course I know the names and entities for those properties.</p>

<p>If I just change the Type column for those properties in the xcdatamodeld file it will work, for new user, but what about existing users, that already have sqlite file in their Documents folder. I believe I need to change the persistent store coordinator somehow.</p>

<p>And also what do you thing about the performance, there are about 10 properties that news to be changed from 16 to 32, but Core Data have in usual cases more than 100 000 objects inside.</p>

<p>The only problem that I have with the program is that after inputting the size of the sides in order to calculate the area, it waits for me to input another number (to make the choice) before displaying the answer.  I don't know where the problem is.  I thought that before moving to another function, C makes sure that it executes the whole function at hand.  Could you please help me solve this problem?  Thanks.</p>

<p>The database will be accessed by C# software (max 10 at the same times) and web application (2-3 at the same times), </p>

<p>I have a Project, Membership, Bucket, Upload, and Document models, all are ActiveRecord models. A Project has many memberships and many buckets. A bucket has many uploads, and an upload has many documents. I would like to track activity on memberships, buckets, uploads, and documents (updates, deletions, creations, etc...).</p>

<pre><code>class Project
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :buckets
  has_many :documents, through: :buckets
end

class Bucket
  belongs_to :project
  has_many :uploads
  has_many :documents, through: :uploads
end

class Upload
  belongs_to :bucket
  has_many :documents
end

class Document
  belongs_to :upload
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is fairly easy in itself. But some buckets are private, and only visible to admins. This means that their activities, and activities on their uploads and their documents can only be visible to admins.</p>

<h2>Approach 1: A polymorphic Activity class</h2>

<p>Activity would belong to a trackable object, in this case <code>Membership</code>, <code>Document</code>, <code>Upload</code>, and <code>Bucket</code>.</p>

<pre><code>class Activity
  belongs_to :project
  belongs_to :trackable, polymorphic: true
end
</code></pre>

<p>This lets me do things like <code>@project.activities</code>. To solve the privacy issue, I can use scopes.</p>

<pre><code>scope :public, -&gt; { joins(:trackable).where(trackable: { private: false }) }
</code></pre>

<p>But only Bucket objects, and by extension their Upload and their Document objects have a privacy flag. Membership does not. I must add privacy flag to all trackable models just so that they can speak to the same interface.</p>

<pre><code>class Membership
  def private; false; end
end

class Upload
  delegate :private, to: :project
end

class Document
  delegate :private, to: :upload
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can do this in some policy object.</p>

<pre><code>@activities = if current_user.admin?
  @project.activities
else
  @project.activities.public
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Approach 2: Add a private flag on activities</h2>

<p>I can add a privacy flag on Activity.</p>

<pre><code>@bucket.activities.build(project: @project) do |a|
  a.private = @bucket.private?
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can do this in some policy object.</p>

<pre><code>@activities = if current_user.admin?
  @project.activities
else
  @project.activities.public
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is easy, but not flexible. If we add an accesses table to buckets, so that their visibility is now based on access rather than user role, we would have to refactor painfully.</p>

<p>Are there better ways to model this feed? How would you do it? I can't use any gems like public activity, so please do not suggest them.</p>

<p>But I have some doubts about it:</p>

<p>I understand that REST does not depend directly on HTTP, but that HTTP is a smart way to implement a REST web API.</p>

<p>I also understand that the focal point of a REST web API is the <strong>resource</strong> concept, which is something like a programming element that manages data, state, performs processing, and that a resource is represented by a URL. For example, something like this: <a href=""http://mybank.com/banking/accounts/123456789"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mybank.com/banking/accounts/123456789</a>
can be a resource representing a home banking account.</p>

<p>Moreover, I know that with REST a resource is accessible on the Web from a URL and we can interact with it using a <strong>predefined set of methods</strong> and that if my REST API is based on the use of HTTP, this set of methods are the methods provided by the HTTP protocol (<code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code>).</p>

<p>I think all of that is pretty clear for me.</p>

<p>What I have some doubts about is the concept whereby the REST web API <strong>provides a set of resources that exchange representations</strong>. I think I understand what a resource represents, but after reading the previous article, I can't understand exactly what is meant by <strong>""representations.""</strong></p>

<p>Further, the posted article says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The formats of exchanged data correspond to representations. The
  latter provides for the managed data kind. We can notice that a
  representation defines a structure of data and isn't linked to a
  particular format such as <code>JSON</code>, <code>XML</code> or <code>YAML</code>. This concept is called
  variant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is meant by: <strong>formats of exchanged data</strong>?  Can anyone explain exactly what the previous paragraph means?</p>

<p>upon investigation with gdb I found all of child registers of eax and ebx contain the same values, look here:</p>

<pre><code>info register eax
0x64636261 //dcba

info register ebx
0x64636261 //dcba
</code></pre>

<p>They are the same!</p>

<p>In Jeff Duntemann's book (Assembly Language step-by-step  programming with Linux) He shows an example of words and double words into registers, but for some reason loads the offset (ie the address of the value like so)</p>

<pre><code>DoubleString: dd 'Stop'
mov edx, DoubleString
</code></pre>

<p>Investigation into the contents of edx show that it contains an address, presumably an address of the first four letters in the string, as apposed to the address of just the first, although I am speculating here.</p>

<p>I would like clarification of what is really happening here and is this statement in fact loading the address of the first letter in the string into a register:</p>

<pre><code>Fin: db 'Final'
mov ecx, Fin

<p>I don't want a library as I'd prefer to code it myself. Plus I don't want to loose my L&amp;F that I have. Examples welcome.</p>

<p>Actually it will be to view a large text file or a long jtable, and does anyone have any good ideas for how I could have an efficient scroll bar to view this?
... should I have a double scroll bar one beginning to end and an inner one which scrolls over a short range???</p>

<p>(sorry it's kind of a double question but it's the coloured scroll bar that will get the tick)</p>

<p>Thanks for all your possible help and ideas.</p>

<p>EDIT: No code example sorry as I'm trying to plan this out in my head before hand... You see it will be a long text pane with a quick search. Users will need to load in this large file and get quick access to details. For the moment I'm keeping it light for loading speeds. Secondly the text will be dynamic so by clicking on a word it will put a stripe in the scroll bar as if the search was activated. For the moment lets just say it is a simple text area with scroll bar.</p>

<p>I end up with a whole bunch of undesirable results i.e. <em>'Toys', 'Tools', 'Touch'</em>. Presumably because the token <em>'to'</em> matches the start of those words. I can't use <code>text_start</code> because I want <em>'advertising'</em> to match <em>'mobile advertising'</em>. Ideally, I would just like to prevent the partial match of the query, but allow partial matches on the index.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write (subclass) a new SimpleMembershipProvider overwriting the existing createuserAndAccount method to verify the email address. But i would also have to implement the login-logout features (just as websecurity does) and a few others.</p></li>
<li><p>Add uniqueness constraints on the database and catch them on my code. However this would cause me to be DataBase dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>This might be a little bit cheap, but i could copy/paste the WebSecurity source code (since its open) on a new class, and modify the createUserAndAccount method.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any other option? I'm aiming for the option 3 at the moment, would be the fastest way.
On a side note, on the future I will be requiring roles as well and I'm not sure if WebSecurity provides support for them.</p>

My custom sort on SQL level is working well, in a given page I get exactly those elements which should be there. However, when I sort a column which is essentially a DateTime but is represented as hh:mm:ss, default telerik sort also occurs which sorts the rows in the given page. This is incorrect, because '09-12-2012 20:20:20' &lt; '09-13-2012 10:10:10', but '20:20:20' > '10:10:10'. How can I prevent default telerik sort for my RadGrid?

The api IS returning views for that day however.</p>

<p>2 reasons for this come to mind:
1. The data is not available yet because it is still being processed.
2. There is no known demographics for that (i.e. the gender and age of the user are not known)?</p>

<p>Am I safe to assume it's not (1) in this case because a query for views did return results? If I can't assume on then is it true that there's no difference in the response/results between ""not processed"" and ""processed but all users are of unknown demographics?"" </p>

<p>In other words if, when (2) were the case, the API would return a row with all zero's 0 for each demographic, that would enable us to interpret things correctly (but I'm pretty sure that's not how API queries with a dimension work).</p>

<p>If possible, I would prefer Python since that's what I have been using lately. Plus, I would finish the coding part much faster. But it all depends on Python's speed.

But I'm having trouble getting it to work as described.</p>

<p>Here's a simplified snippet of the relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>var firebase_root = new Firebase('https://example.firebaseio.com');

firebase_root.authAnonymously(function(error, authData) {
    var page = firebase_root.child(uid).push(); // create a unique reference for this pageload

    page.child('loaded_page').set(Firebase.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP);
    page.child('left_page').onDisconnect().set(Firebase.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP);
});
</code></pre>

<p>In the docs for anonymous authentication, it says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If not specified - or set to default - sessions are persisted for as long as you have configured in the Login &amp; Auth tab of your Firebase's Dashboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've set my <code>Session Length</code> to 12 months in my settings so I would expect that if I load this page and then refresh the page I would get a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    someRandomUserId: {
        randomPageId_1: {
            loaded_page: timestamp_1,
            left_page: timestamp_2
        },
        randomPageId_2: {
            loaded_page: timestamp_3
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it looks like it is actually re-assigning the user ID rather than persisting it across page loads. So I'm actually getting a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    someRandomUserId_1: {
        randomPageId_1: {
            loaded_page: timestamp_1,
            left_page: timestamp_2
        }
    },
    someRandomUserId_2: {
        randomPageId_2: {
            loaded_page: timestamp_3
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That question features a number of very useful answers. One of the answers refers to the entry for <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures"" rel=""nofollow"">Closures at the Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript guide</a>, which does indeed provide a succinct and understandable explanation (specifically, that a closure stores a <strong>function</strong> and its <strong>environment</strong>).</p>

<p>However, the MDN entry under Practical Closures has me perplexed... specifically, where is the need for a closure in their example for resizing text? Can someone clarify for me why they need closure for the makeSizer function?</p>

<p>As a beginner programmer I can only assume that my alternative that does not use closures, shown below, is somehow naive and incorrect (despite seeming more succinct and efficient)? </p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in the justification for a text size closure when the MDN entry reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is unwise to unnecessarily create functions within other functions
  if closures are not needed for a particular task, as it will
  negatively affect script performance both in terms of processing speed
  and memory consumption.</p>

<p>The two Lists are:</p>

<p>Let's say primaryBrokers = <code>[{ID:1, 'Sai'}, {ID: 2, 'Sam'}, {ID:3, 'Soo'}]</code></p>

<p>Let's say <code>ng-model = 1</code> i.e. Sai is Selected</p>

<p>Let's say <code>secondaryBrokers = [{ID: 2, 'Sam'}, {ID:3, 'Soo'}, {ID:4, 'Mike'}]</code></p>

<p>Lets say  <code>ng-model = 4</code> i.e. Mike is selected.</p>

<p>I have a Master List as well which has combination of both:</p>

<pre><code>brokers = [{ID:1, 'Sai'}, {ID: 2, 'Sam'}, {ID:3, 'Soo'}, {ID:4, 'Mike'}]
</code></pre>

<p>The Markup is as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select class=""form-control""
    ng-options=""broker.ID as broker.Name for broker in controller.primaryBrokers""
    ng-model=""controller.primaryId""
    ng-change=""controller.setPrimaryJllContact()""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""""&gt;Select Primary Broker&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;


&lt;select class=""form-control""
    ng-options=""broker.ID as broker.Name for broker in controller.secondaryBrokers""
    ng-model=""controller.secondaryId""
    ng-change=""controller.handleSecondaryJllContactChange()""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""""&gt;Select Secondary Broker&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Another point to note is whoever is selected in one List does not appear in the other list. That is as Sai is selected in primary brokers he does not appear in secondary brokers List and as Mike is selected in the secondary brokers list he does not appear in the primary brokers List.</p>

<p>So when I change Mike to Sam in the Secondary Brokers List in the ng-change method controller.handleSecondaryJllContactChange(), I refresh the Primary Brokers List <strong>(I am doing it because anyone who is selected in secondary should not appear in primary. Since Mike is no longer selected as secondary, he can appear in primary and sam who is selected as secondary cannot appear in primary)</strong> using lo dash as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>handleSecondaryBrokersChange:()=&gt;
  primaryBrokers = _.where(brokers, (broker)=&gt; broker.ID != controller.secondaryID)
</code></pre>

<p>However when I do this the ng-option doesn't set to the right ng-model. I get <code>&lt;Select Primary Broker&gt;</code> instead of Sai. I examined the console and ng-model of primary brokers is set correctly i.e. controller.primaryID is equal to 1, however 
it shows as <code>&lt;Select Primary Broker&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>This works perfectly in chrome. However in IE 11 it doesn't.</p>

<p>Any ideas and suggestions are appreciated!!!!</p>

When the user then clicks on any links in the app, they are redirected to the login page. After successful authentication, they are redirected to the main page.</p>

<p>I have implemented a system where the user is redirected to the page they were trying to reach before being redirected to the login page.</p>

<p>The system works like this: when the user with an expired session clicks an internal link, Deadbolt determines they are not logged in and redirects them to the login page. Before the redirect, it grabs the target url from the request header and stores it in the session. After the user fills out the login form on the following page, they submit the details to the authentication action. If the authentication is successful, the action checks to see if a target url exists in session; if so, it clears the item from the session and redirects to the target url, if not, it redirects to the main page.</p>

<p>The target url exists as a String for the duration and is fed into the <code>play.mvc.Results.redirect( String url )</code> method as such.</p>

I have some issues with sorting countries names in different languages. For example, countries names in french are sorted like that :
 - États-Unis
 - Éthiopie
 - Afghanistan</p>

<p>I don't have this issue on my local server using MAMP.
My database's character set is configured as utf8 and the collation is utf8_unicode_ci. I have exactly the same configuration on the distant server.</p>

<p>I created a my.cnf file on my local server with the following instructions in order to correctly display special characters :</p>

<pre><code>[mysqld]
skip-character-set-client-handshake
collation_server=utf8_unicode_ci
character_set_server=utf8
</code></pre>

<p>On the distant server, the my.cnf file does not contain these lines. When I tried to add them, MySQL did not recognise special characters anymore like if it was interpreting them as latin1.
I checked collation_database and all character_set variables but they are all set as utf8 / utf8_unicode_ci.</p>

<p>Here is the SQL code for the creation of the table :</p>

<p><code>CREATE TABLE esth_countries (
  country_id varchar(2) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  name varchar(100) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  region varchar(40) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  language_id varchar(2) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (country_id,language_id),
  KEY language_id (language_id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci;</code></p>

<p>Special characters are correctly displayed on my distant server. The only problem concerns sorting using ORDER BY clause.</p>

<p>It seems like there is something wrong with the distant server's configuration but I can't figure out what.</p>

<p>after following the advices from there, in GUI programming, infinite loops have to be avoided at all costs, in order to keep the widgets responsive to user input, for example mouse clicks.</p>

<p>Instead of using:</p>

<pre><code>while 1:
    ball.draw()
    root.update()
    time.sleep(0.01)
</code></pre>

<p>I managed using <code>self.canvas.after(1, self.draw)</code> inside my <code>draw()</code> function.</p>

<p>So my code now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code># Testing skills in game programming

from Tkinter import *

root = Tk()
root.title(""Python game testing"")
root.resizable(0, 0)
root.wm_attributes(""-topmost"", 1)

canvas = Canvas(root, width=500, height=400, bd=0, highlightthickness=0)
canvas.pack()
root.update()

class Ball:
    def __init__(self, canvas, color):
        self.canvas = canvas
        self.id = canvas.create_oval(10, 10, 25, 25, fill=color)
        self.canvas.move(self.id, 245, 100)

        self.canvas_height = canvas.winfo_height()
        self.x = 0
        self.y = -1

    def draw(self):
        self.canvas.move(self.id, self.x, self.y)

        pos = self.canvas.coords(self.id)
        if pos[1] &lt;= 0:
            self.y = 1
        if pos[3] &gt;= self.canvas_height:
            self.y = -1

        self.canvas.after(2, self.draw)


ball = Ball(canvas, ""red"")
ball.draw()

root.mainloop()
</code></pre>

<p>However, time inside <code>self.canvas.after()</code> does not work properly...
If set to 1 it's exetremely fast! Is set to 10, 5 or even 2, it's too slow!
I didn't have that problem while using the above while loop in my code since the <code>time.sleep()</code> worked as it should!</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I can now report that the time inside the after function of Tkinter does not work properly in my Windows 8.1 tablet, and in my Windows 8.1 laptop, while in the same laptop when running Ubuntu through <em>virtual machine</em> it does work as it should.</p>

<p>I dropped a simple ""Hello World!"" index.html file at the root of the WCF services application. I am able to serve that .html file. My services are under a sub-directory named ""Hosts"". I also dropped a simple index.html file under that sub-directory - I am able to serve that file as well. I cannot serve any of my .svc files though.</p>

<p><a href=""http://localhost/mywcfapplication/Hosts/IncidentService.svc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/mywcfapplication/Hosts/IncidentService.svc</a></p>

<p>Anonymous Authentication -- ""Application pool identity"" is selected</p>

<p>The services are running in their own application pool. About the app pool: </p>

<ul>
<li>.NET Framework Version: v2.0</li>
<li>Enable 32-bit applications: false</li>
<li>Managed Pipeline Mode: Classic</li>
<li>Identity: ApplicationPoolIdentity</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently set these services up on a new Windows Server 2012 R2 web server in our test environment (old test server was decommissioned). On the server I had to give the app pool user permission to the directory in the file system (IIS_IUSRS\apppoolname), but my laptop doesn't seem to like this.</p>

<p>I'm receiving a 404.0 error when I attempt to browse to any of my .svc files under this application. IIS tells me the most likely causes are: •The directory or file specified does not exist on the Web server.
•The URL contains a typographical error.
•A custom filter or module, such as URLScan, restricts access to the file.</p>

<p>I have checked and re-checked the URL, and I can serve the .html files. I verified that the .svc files do exist. I'm at a loss. What have I overlooked?</p>

<p>But, I was relying pretty heavily on the ""apply"" tag inside my templates in order to bring in boilerplate components, like my site header and menus.  For me, a typical template looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt; &lt;PageTitle /&gt; &lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/styles/style.css"" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel=""alternate"" type=""application/rss+xml"" title=""${PageTitle} Feed"" href=""http://www.savannidgerinel.com/rss"" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body class=""center""&gt;

&lt;apply template=""header"" /&gt;

&lt;div id=""content""&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;PageTitle /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;PageMetadata /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;PageContent /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And, I'm now loading the templates like this:</p>

<pre><code>setup_heist template_dir = do
    templates &lt;- Heist.loadTemplates template_dir
    hs &lt;- Heist.initHeist (Heist.HeistConfig [] [] [] [] templates)
    return hs
</code></pre>

<p>This is not too much different from how I used to load templates (still using the <code>loadTemplates</code> function), but it is a different way of setting up the Heist state that I'm not accustomed to.</p>

<p>But, now none of the <code>apply</code> tags have any effect.  My ""included"" templates just never load and within the resulting HTML I see this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;apply template='header'&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;

Here i include this <a href=""http://www.aspdotnet-suresh.com/2012/03/jquery-ui-autocomplete-textbox-with.html"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> for more reference of my code detail.</p>

<p>Here I modify method for auto complete. In article this calls from css class and I want from the ID of the control. </p>

<p>This is my jQuery script :</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
       $(document).ready(function () {
           SearchText();
       });
       function SearchText() {
           $(""#&lt;%=txt_reason.ClientID %&gt;"").autocomplete({
               source: function (request, response) {
                   $.ajax({
                       type: ""POST"",
                       contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
                       url: ""Raise_Ticket.aspx/SearchReasons"",
                       data: ""{'prefixText':'"" + $(""#&lt;%=txt_reason.ClientID %&gt;"").val() + ""'}"",
                       dataType: ""json"",
                       success: function (data) {
                           response(data.d);
                       },
                       error: function (result) {
                           alert(""Error"");
                       }
                   });
               }
           });
       }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is my method:</p>

<pre><code>[System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptMethod(ResponseFormat = System.Web.Script.Services.ResponseFormat.Json)]
[System.Web.Services.WebMethod]
public static List&lt;string&gt; SearchReasons(string prefixText)
{
    using (DataClassesDataContext db = new DataClassesDataContext())
    {
        var query = db.Reasons.Where(r =&gt; r.ReasonText.Contains(prefixText)).Select(r =&gt; r).ToList();
        List&lt;string&gt; reasons = new List&lt;string&gt;();
        foreach (var item in query)
        {
            reasons.Add(item.ReasonText.ToString());
        }
        return reasons;
    }
}

<p>The problem is not detecting this textbox not displaying result.</p>

The (quite strong) advice given there is not to do so.  In one post it is stated ""The Office APIs all assume you are running Office in an interactive session on a desktop, with a monitor, keyboard and mouse and, most importantly, a message pump.""  I'm not sure what that is.  (I've been programming in C# for only about a year; my other programming experience has primarily been with ColdFusion.)</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>My program runs through a large number of RTF files to extract two pieces of information used to construct a medical report number. Rather than try and figure out how the formatting instructions in RTF work, I decided to just open them in Word and pull the text out from there (without actually starting the GUI). Occasionally, the program hiccuped in the middle of processing one file, and left a Word thread open attached to that document (I still have to figure out how to shut that one down). When I re-ran the program, of course I got a notification that there was a thread using that file, and did I want to open a read-only copy? When I said Yes, the Word GUI suddenly popped up from nowhere and started processing the files. I was wondering why that happened; but it looks like maybe once the dialog box popped up the message pump started pushing the main GUI to Windows as well?</p>

<p>And now I'm puzzling about something else. Yesterday I posed this question as an unregistered user - and then cleared my cookies so that it couldn't figure out who I was; now as a registered user I have to start over from scratch :-/ Why don't they make it easier to connect cookie-based registration with OpenID-based? Hmf.</p>

<p>I believe that, under transaction pooling, every command is a transaction by itself, just the way it is when you're connected directly to the server, and perhaps every command is getting a different connection from the pool.

<p>This will produce a cardinal xpath string given a org.w3c.dom.DOMElement: <code>/html/body/p[3]/a</code></p>

<p><code>getElementXpath</code> works fine if I comment out the <code>getElementIdx()</code> function and the conditional. Problem seems to be located in <code>getElementIdx()</code>, but I don't see what I am doing wrong, the Java code below is nearly same as the Javascript version.</p>

<p>What happens is that an empty string is returned! I tried printing out the path inside the <code>getElementXpath</code> function but to no avil. Expected output is a cardinal xpath string!</p>

<p>Update:  </p>

<pre><code>public static String getElementXpath(DOMElement elt){
        String path = """"; 

        for (; elt != null &amp;&amp; elt.ELEMENT_NODE == elt.getNodeType(); elt = (DOMElement) elt.getParentNode()){

            path = ""test"";
            System.out.println(path); //this prints out fine.
        }
        System.out.println(path); //nothing is printed!
            return path;

<p>The problem Im having is that I have tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>items</li>
<li>quests</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I HAD tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>item_has_quest_requirements</li>
<li>quest_has_item_requirements</li>
<li>quest_has_item_rewards</li>
<li>quest_has_item_recommends</li>
</ul>

<p>Which are just HABTM tables with 2 primary keys connecting these 2 tables. Now, some of them also have their OWN specific columns also which is why I had not put them into the same table. For example, <strong>item_has_quest_requirements</strong> has just the keys, but <strong>quest_has_item_requirements</strong> has also <em>amount</em> field as do rewards and recommends aswell.</p>

<p>However, if I follow CakePHP naming conventions, I should NOT use composite primary keys and if I wanted to connect 2 tables together as HABTM tables, I should name the tables in alphabetical order by table names. Which means AFAIK that these tables would ALL become: <strong>items_quests</strong> tables which is impossible. </p>

<p>Would the only way be then to create totally new extra table like:
<strong>quest_requirements</strong> which would have the <em>amount</em> column and then make the HABTM table like: <strong>items_quest_requirements</strong> ? </p>

<p>This is what I have been rolling in my mind so could you enlighten a bit what would be the best approach? </p>

<p>I have XML fields like: </p>

      &lt;Field name=""camera"" value="""" /&gt;

<p>However I have many more  elements to many to list here , I have one for everything imaginable metadata that you would want to include in a Video or audio file.</p>

<p>So my question and problem is how do I specify in my XSL which Field names to grab , it is currently grabbing everything within the tags, which is good but its not right.Here as a bit of my XSL. </p>

<pre><code>         &lt;!--MasterClip--&gt;
 &lt;xsl:template match=""MasterClip""&gt;
    &lt;MasterClip&gt;

    &lt;/Field&gt;

<p>I have about 50 fields then outputting , however I only want to select ones I specify (10 of them) . I have tried a few examples but most relate to searching and sorting, any help would be great. Even just a quick example showing me how to select one of them and i can just replicate it out for the rest!. </p>

<p>SOLVED </p>

<p>According to the documentation the patchEntity was created for you to use the existing entity, creating a new I would be creating a line at the database, then the solution was:</p>

<p>Just update UsersController, use a entity with the a user's id that you want to update</p>

<p>UsersController</p>

<pre><code>$user_data = $this-&gt;Users
                        -&gt;find()
                        -&gt;where(['id' =&gt; 2])
                        -&gt;first();

 $user = $this-&gt;Users-&gt;patchEntity($user_data, 
                        [
                        'password' =&gt; $this-&gt;request-&gt;data['new-password']                        
                        ]);
                    /*debug($user);
                    exit();*/
                    if ($this-&gt;Users-&gt;save($user)) {
                        $this-&gt;Flash-&gt;success('Success, GG EASY');
                    } else {

<p>The program appears to crash on a call to ChoosePixelFormat.  I'm passing in a non-null handle.  It works on most systems, so I'm guessing its a graphics driver issue, but it appears to be up to date.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why this function would crash instead of, say, returning an error code?  I understand the PIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR may have values that don't exist on a given system:</p>

<pre><code>  .nSize = Len(glPFD)
  .nVersion = 1
  .dwFlags = PFD_DRAW_TO_BITMAP Or PFD_SUPPORT_OPENGL Or PFD_SUPPORT_GDI

  .iLayerType = PFD_MAIN_PLANE

<p>But would that make it crash?</p>

<p>Edit: On the system on which this fails, it works with a previous version in which this code was identical.  I read a forum somewhere that said loading/unloading opengl32.dll can cause gdi32.dll to break things.  This might be the case.</p>

<p>Edit: I've attached the full code below (it's kind of ugly, but it helped me narrow down where the crash was).  No functions return 0 before ChoosePixelFormat crashes.</p>
