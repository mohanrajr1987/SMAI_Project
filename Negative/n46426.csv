"11445647","1","11445757","","2012-07-12 05:45:23","","2","532","<p>I try to extend the <code>boost::dynamic_bitset</code> class with some functionality I need, such as counting bits after an AND operation, etc. Also I need access to the private members (m_num_bits, etc) because I want to be able to ""override"" the <code>set()</code> method to ensure the bitset's capacity with the resize() fct, if the <code>pos</code> of the bit to set is greater then the current bitset capacity. If I use the native <code>set()</code> fct it throughs an assertion error in that case (because the <code>set()</code> method does not resize in such case)</p>

<p>I am not very experienced with templates, also I am just getting back into C++ since a few weeks, it's a bit rusty, maybe somebody can help me out. </p>

<p>I started doing this: </p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename Block, typename Allocator&gt;
class ExtendedBitSet : public boost::dynamic_bitset&lt;Block, Allocator&gt; {
    typedef boost::dynamic_bitset&lt;Block, Allocator&gt; super;
public:
    void set(std::size_t pos) {
        if (pos &gt; super::size())
            super::resize(pos);
        set(pos);
    }
    bool get(std::size_t pos) const {
        return super::test(pos);
    }
};

// ...

ExtendedBitSet&lt;&gt; * bs = new ExtendedBitSet&lt;&gt;(128);
bs-&gt;set(33);
// ...
std::wcout &lt;&lt; ""Bit 48 is "" &lt;&lt; ((bs-&gt;get(48) == true) ? ""true"" : ""false"") &lt;&lt; std::endl;
// ...
delete bs;
</code></pre>

<p>Ofcourse this is not compiling, the error is:</p>

<pre><code>dynamic_bitset.cpp: In function ‘int main(int, char**)’:
dynamic_bitset.cpp:50: error: wrong number of template arguments (0, should be 2)
dynamic_bitset.cpp:7: error: provided for ‘template&lt;class T, class Allocator&gt; class ExtendedBitSet’

..
dynamic_bitset.cpp:57: error: request for member ‘get’ in ‘* bs’, which is of non-class type ‘int’
</code></pre>

<p>Can somebody give a hint how to get that running? Also is there maybe a better way than deriving from the dynamic_bitset class or is this OK to do?</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I have added the following files to my application:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Default.png - (iPhone) </p>
  
  <p>Default@2x.ping - (iPhone Retina)</p>
  
  <p>Default-Portrait~ipad.png - (iPad) </p>
  
  <p>Default-Portrait@2x~ipad.png -(iPad Retina)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the application starts it seems that it selects the correct Default.png image to use for each occasion. However in my AppDelegate I have a simple splash screen to make smoother the loading of the application and the transition to the app, doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>UIImageView *splashView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,window.frame.size.width, window.frame.size.height)]; 
splashView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""Default""]; 

[window addSubview:splashView]; 
[window bringSubviewToFront:splashView];

<p>However the <code>[UIImage imageNamed:@""Default""]</code> in turn does not select the correct file for each device, and I believe the problem is the <code>-Portrait</code> part of the filename.</p>

<p>So as a quick solution I did this:</p>

<pre><code>if( ([UIDevice currentDevice].userInterfaceIdiom == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad) ) {
    // Force the image used by ipads
    if( [[UIScreen mainScreen] respondsToSelector:@selector(scale)] &amp;&amp; [[UIScreen mainScreen] scale] == 2.0) {
       splashView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""Default-Portrait@2x~ipad""];
    }
    else {
        splashView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""Default-Portrait~ipad""];
    }
}
else
   splashView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""Default""];

"14562001","1","16011028","","2013-01-28 12:25:22","","3","613","<h2>The Situation</h2>

<p>I often see Node.js applications with the following structure:</p>

<p><em>Common pattern:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><code>lib/</code> or <code>src/</code> - the self-written code
<ul>
<li><code>index.js</code> - main code</li>
<li><em>internal modules</em>... (e.g. self-written for this project)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>node_modules</code>
<ul>
<li><em>external modules</em>... (e.g. taken from another project)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>package.json</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>My Problem</h2>

<p>What I don't like about this pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I <strong>don't feel comfortable</strong> about it because you have to <strong>explicitly specify the directory path</strong> of the internal modules when <code>require()</code>ing:</p>

<pre><code>// /lib/index.js

var internalMod = require('./internal'); // `require('internal')` (without path) wouldn't work
internalMod.doSomething();
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>My Idea</h2>

<p>So I think it would be a good idea also to <strong>place internal modules in an <code>node_modules</code> folder (somewhere</strong> in the project). So <code>node</code> would be able to find them, even if you don't explicitly specify the path.</p>

<p><em>For example:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><code>src/</code> - the self-written code
<ul>
<li><code>index.js</code> - main code</li>
<li><code>node-modules</code> - for internals
<ul>
<li><em>internal modules</em>...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>node_modules</code> - for externals
<ul>
<li><em>external modules</em>... (e.g. taken from another project)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>package.json</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Are there any cons about my plan?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there another idea where to place internal modules in folder structure?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I want to use the clustering ability of mysql to store related records beside each other on disk. Mysql clusters by the primary key on the table, which for a default rails model is ID.</p>

<p>However, for a lot of tables, it may make sense for the primary key of the table to be, for example, user_id, subscription_id, clustering the related records beside each, and making for a very efficient lookup when you ask the database for all of a user's subscriptions.</p>

<p>To do this, I created a mysql table like:</p>

<pre><code> execute('create table subscriptions (
             id         integer not null auto_increment,
             user_id    integer not null,
             feed_id    integer not null,
             folder_id  integer,
             created_at     datetime,
             updated_at     datetime,
             primary key (user_id, feed_id),
             key id (id)
          ) engine=InnoDB default charset=utf8');
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that my PK is user_id, feed_id but I still have the ID column present, and I want rails to still use that as what it believes is the PK for the table.</p>

<p>First off, this didn't work at all until I set:</p>

<pre><code>class Subscription &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

  self.primary_key = 'id'
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now comes the strange part.</p>

<p>When I run my tests, I get a strange error:</p>

<pre><code>Mysql::Error: Field 'id' doesn't have a default value: INSERT INTO `subscriptions` 
</code></pre>

<p>However - if I stick the application in development mode and do operations through the webpage, it works just fine.</p>

<p>After a lot of googling, I found a monkey patch to stop Rails setting MySQL into a stricter mode:</p>

<pre><code>class ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::MysqlAdapter

private
  alias_method :configure_connection_without_strict_mode, :configure_connection

  def configure_connection
    configure_connection_without_strict_mode
    strict_mode = ""SQL_MODE=''""
    execute(""SET #{strict_mode}"", :skip_logging)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If I add this, my test suit appears to work (for most tests, but not all), but any models that get created have an ID of zero.</p>

<p>Again in production mode, through the webpage things work just fine, and the models get an auto_increment ID as expected.</p>

<p>Has anyone got any ideas on what I can do this make my test suite work correctly in this setup?</p>

The service should keep a bunch of connections to various databases for faster performance. I'm suggesting using connection pool for that. There may be connection problems to DB because we have a lot of remote access to the DB through VPN. As I have said, service should retain connection as long as possible. </p>

<p>What is the connection pool management algorithm? </p>

<p>I have a connection string:
Code:</p>

<pre><code>User Id=inet;Password=somePassw0rd;Data Source=TEST11;Min Pool Size=5;Max Pool Size=15;Pooling=True
</code></pre>

<p>Then I simply open and close connection in my code. That's it.</p>

<p>At this moment everything is OK. There are five sessions on DB side. So I would kill a session to simulate connection problems. And in some cases the connection will be restored by pool manager and in some cases it won't.</p>

<p>If I kill all five connections they are never restored back.</p>

<p>How can I confiure pooling manager? Any settings for duration between checking DB connections?</p>

<p>I have used <code>validate connection=true;</code> it seems to work fine for me, but it would need some effort if reconnect to DB is needed, and therefore it would be more efficient to have an already good connection.</p>

<p>I think that <strong>the issue has something to do with products that contain struckthrough prices before showing the new, lower price.</strong> These struckthrough prices (marked by the  tags) seem to confuse the sorting algorithm, as it groups them all together as having the lowest possible price.</p>

<p>I'm not very familiar with Shopify, so I'm really sure how to correct this sorting issue.</p>

<p>I've included some pictures to show how it sorts them. In these examples, the products are all sorted by 'Prices: Lowest to Highest'.</p>

<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/PrX7Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/PrX7Y</a></p>

<p>As you can see, these are definitely not sorted from the lowest price to the highest and I really need to figure out why. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>If I remove isFinished accessor methods, then the completion block gets called but way before <code>ImportWordOperation</code> finishes.</p>

<p>I've read code that I've found that uses its own completion block but then what's the use for the completion block in NSOperation subclasses anyway?</p>

<p>Any ideas or point to a similar solved situation would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Ideally I'd like to just call stats.norm.rvs(loc=blah,scale=blah,size=blah) and then also set the skew and kurt in addition to the mean and variance. The norm function takes a 'moments' argument consisting of some arrangement of 'mvsk' where the s and k stand for skew and kurtosis, but apparently all that does is ask that the s and k be computed from the rv, whereas I want to establish the s and k as parameters of the distribution to begin with.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm not a statistics expert by any means, perhaps this is a simple or misguided question. Would appreciate any help.</p>

<p>EDIT: If the four moments aren't enough to define the distribution well enough, is there any other way to draw values that are consist with an empirical distribution that looks like this: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/3yB2Y.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/3yB2Y.png</a></p>

<p>I now that the problem occur cause I am giving only id of parent element instead of whole object. But I would like to do not repeat objects it there is no need.</p>

<p>All of the related elements (children, parents) are in this list of json objects. I would like gson use this id to find object in json string and applied it.</p>

<p>More code of mine releated to this issue is in this post:

<p>Now I'd like to squeeze a little bit more juice of that and return a even smaller JSON file from the server.</p>

<p>Considering that my data would be bound to a grid on the front-end with that format</p>

key1    1   2   3
key2    4   5   6

    { ""id"": ""key2"", ""a"": ""4"", ""b"": ""5"", ""c"": ""6"" },

<pre><code>UINavigationController* adsl_navctl = [[[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:adsl_newnedit] autorelease];
self.adsc_current_popover = [[[dsd_popover_controller alloc] initWithContentViewController:adsl_navctl] autorelease];
_adsc_current_popover.delegate = self;
[adsl_newnedit.tableView layoutIfNeeded];
_adsc_current_popover.popoverContentSize = CGSizeMake(_adsc_current_popover.popoverContentSize.width, adsl_newnedit.tableView.contentSize.height + 38);
[_adsc_current_popover presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem:sender permittedArrowDirections:UIPopoverArrowDirectionAny animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>Here's how i resize my popover. self.contentSizeForViewInPopover isn't set anywhere else yet.<br>
This is in all viewcontrollers, which are presented in the uinavigationcontroller. The size isn't the same everytime of course.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];
    if (UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad) {
    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.3 animations:^{
        [self forcePopoverSize];
    }];
}
}
- (void)forcePopoverSize {
    CGSize currentSetSizeForPopover = CGSizeMake(320, self.tableView.contentSize.height);
    CGSize fakeMomentarySize = CGSizeMake(currentSetSizeForPopover.width - 1.0f, currentSetSizeForPopover.height - 1.0f);
    self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = fakeMomentarySize;
    self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = currentSetSizeForPopover;
}
</code></pre>

The content still is the size of the previous popover size even when the popover already resized. Normally it should resize both at the same time<br></p>

<p>Edit: After some time, i tried to look onto this again and i finally found a solution for me.
In this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2752394/popover-with-embedded-navigation-controller-doesnt-respect-size-on-back-nav"">Question</a> the answer by ""adnako"" solved my problem.</p>

<pre><code>   if (floor(NSFoundationVersionNumber) &gt; NSFoundationVersionNumber_iOS_5_1) {
        int j = 2;
        j++; //This is just some code so I can use breakpoints for testing.

    }

<p>I am testing on iOS 5.1.1. Now if I comment out the NSLog, line, the app works without problem. But if I uncomment it the app crashes almost immediately within the main method:</p>

<p>int retVal = UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, @""AppController"");</p>

<p>I guess its not crashing when it is commented out because the compiler ""optimises out"" the code since its not used. But then what is the correct way to make sure the code isn't used, and the app doesn't crash ?</p>

<p>EDIT: I edited the code, the if block is not optimised out:</p>

<pre><code>        int j = 2;

   if (floor(NSFoundationVersionNumber) &gt; NSFoundationVersionNumber_iOS_5_1) {
        j++; //This is just some code so I can use breakpoints for testing.
        NSLog(@""Google Mobile Ads SDK version: %@"", [GADRequest sdkVersion]); //Commenting out the line prevents the crash
    }else{
        j--;
    }

    NSLog(@""%d"",j);
</code></pre>

<p>The output is ""1"", so the code in the else block executes. So even thought the function call <code>[GADRequest sdkVersion]</code> is not made, why does it crash ? Again, if I comment out the function call the app does not crash.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is with FastScroll.  I have everything working for the most part.  The list is grouped by first letter and when using FastScroll the letter appears in the popup and goes to the correct group.  The issue is when I let go of the FastScroll after going to the desired section the FastScroll ""Jumps"" to a random part of the list.  It doesn't stay in the location where I let go of it.  I think it is going to an arbitrary place in the section because I do not have the SectionIndexer implemented right.  I think the problem is with this method.  </p>

Those <code>CALayer</code>s comprise of <code>CGImage</code>s and text rendered through CoreGraphics. Another OpenGL texture source is a screenshot of a <code>UIView</code> taken using <code>-[CALAyer renderInContext:]</code> and <code>UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext</code>. Currently, I'm running completely on the main thread.</p>

<p>The latter case in particular is pretty bad because it halts the OpenGL rendering for the whole time it takes to create the <code>UIView</code> and its screenshot.</p>

<p>Now I'm considering to move the OpenGL code into a separate thread hoping to get around this blocking. Ideally, the screenshot would be taken on a different thread (main thread if needed) than the OpenGL rendering.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to find a complete coverage in the documentation about what requires running on the main thread and what not.

Essentially this is the first time that the App loads after it has been installed.</p>

<p>I've spent hours on SO trying various different solutions (including the one I linked to) but I'm just not getting anywhere and it seems that many of the solutions are either for WP7 or WP8 and nothing similar has been solved for the new WP8.1.</p>

<p>This is the basic check, using Windows.Storage that I'm doing to see if a password has been set or not.</p>

<pre><code>Windows.Storage.ApplicationDataContainer localSettings = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings;
Windows.Storage.StorageFolder localFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;

if (localSettings.Values[""myPassword""] == null)
{
    Debug.WriteLine(""Password not set"");
    this.Frame.Navigate(typeof(SetPassword));
}
else
{
    Debug.WriteLine(""Password is set, continuing as normal"");
}

<p>If I add this to <code>public MainPage()</code> class I have no problem in the app returning ""Password is not set"" in the debug messages however the <code>this.frame.Navigate(typeof(SetPassword))</code> navigation never loads the SetPassword view.</p>

<p>I have also tried this method in the <code>OnNavigatedTo</code> with exactly the same results.</p>

<p>In my App.xaml file I've also tried a number of different methods, again, with the same results. I can get the debug message but not the navigation I'm looking for. I looked at implementing a method on <code>Application_Launching</code> <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/19169740/1322242"">over here</a> as well as implementing conditional navigation on <code>RootFrame.Navigating+= RootFrameOnNavigating;</code> <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/19170032/1322242"">over here</a> but clearly I am missing something.</p>

<p>Hopefully you smarter people can help me get my navigation working based on a conditional value?</p>

<p>But with the C++0x move constructor i run into a problem. Since the destructor is also called on the ""unloaded"" object i need to prevent the cleanup of the resource handle.

<p>I'm not sure if Task.Factory.StartNew is the best way to do this either, would be grateful for any suggestions.</p>

<pre><code>public boolean validateVuoti(){
    //Controlla che i campi del form non siano vuoti
    boolean result=true;
    if(tipo.equals("""")){

<p>When validation fails this line calls an action called preload that retrieves some data from DB and shows again the insert.jsp page with the combobox filled in with the data that the previsious action has got.</p>

<pre><code>@Result(type=""chain"", name=""input"", location=""preload""),,
</code></pre>

<p>When the actions were mapped using the ""classic"" struts.xml file this system worked correctly and when the validation control failed the program used to show me the errors. now the validation control fails and the preload action is performed but no error message is shown.</p>

<p>So far so good. The last step is to pull the branch <code>backport-cs2</code> of <code>specific</code> into the <em>default branch</em> of <code>generic</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ../generic
$ hg pull -b backport-cs2 ../specific
$ hg glog 
o  changeset:   1:1405acc4a121
|  branch:      backport-cs2

|
@  changeset:   0:d516ded3bf0a
   summary:     generic project commit
</code></pre>

<p>Now in <code>generic</code> there is the changeset I want, but it's in a new branch while I'd like to have it in default. Any suggestion how to do that? Ideas for a better approach to backporting are appreciated as well.</p>

I have been working on a django application, and now that my application is running pretty well I am staring into the face of the monster that is deployment, and wondering which direction to take. </p>

<p>My application is running Django 1.7 and Python 3.4. I want to use PostgreSQL with Postgis as my database. I was originally thinking of using Amazon AWS for deployment, using their Elastic Beanstalk PaaS service, although now I am wondering if something like Heroku may be better for me as a beginner to all of this. I need my application to scale easily, without me having to dive into too much configuration that I am very likely to mess up. </p>

<p>What I am wondering is which service would be best for a newcomer developer deploying an application running the platforms I mentioned above. Heroku seems like it is a bit easier to use than AWS, but I am concerned that the pricing with Heroku would ramp up more quickly than with AWS. How difficult would it be to initially deploy using one service and migrate to another as I become more familiar with the process of maintaining web applications and/or as my needs change?</p>

<p>Any recommendations or info to help me decide on a service to go with would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>The problem is styling my results between Chrome and Firefox
I set the padding and I achieve this result in Chrome: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/dmV13Xw.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/dmV13Xw.png</a>
As you can see the text is nicely aligned with the start of the input field.</p>

<p>I've only just started really so it's frustrating to run into such intractabilities early on!</p>

<p>The HTML markup for the result bit is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""results-sec`enter code here`tion""&gt;
&lt;div id=""results-container"" class=""uk-container uk-container-center uk-width-1-2""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""result""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p></p>

<p>And the CSS I'm applying to it:</p>

<pre><code>    #results-container {
      margin-top: 9px;
      margin-bottom: 6px;
      padding-left: 40px;
      padding-right: 160px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried inserting tons of snippets from around SO et al but nothing seems to work. Tried a seemingly infinite variation of CSS resets too, but the UI kit using integrates normalise.css anyway.</p>

<p>It's annoying because it seems like such a trivial amount of HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>I'm guessing it's something to do with moz/webkit CSS properties but I wouldn't know where to begin to rectify this issue.</p>

<p>My pair programming partner stopped me at this point and explained that this wouldn't work, because <code>find_all_by_lifecycle_id</code> could only be resolved successfully if called by the <code>Deliverable</code> model, which inherits from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> (which is, in turn, the class responsible for providing such magical functionality). The <code>self.deliverables</code> method returns an <em>array</em>, which doesn't offer the same capabilities. The alternate solution he suggested was to use a <strong>named scope</strong>.</p>

<p>I protested: ""But... I'm pretty sure I <em>tried</em> it already... and it <em>worked</em>.""</p>

<p>Sure enough, it <em>does</em> seem to work, as we discovered when we tested it out just to humor me. What was my teammate missing? I certainly don't have the expertise to see what could've been wrong about what he said (it made sense to me).</p>

<p>All I have done is following:-</p>

<p>1) The body is static initially and is positioned at ccp(size.width*0.5, size.height*0.75).</p>

<p>2) After 1.5 seconds, It becomes kinematic and starts moving with a linear speed of 0.5 m/s.</p>

<p>3) It checks it's current distance (from screen width center keeping height same), evaluates the time needed to reach that spot, and then starts moving in that direction horizontally.</p>

<p>4) After reaching that spot, it starts it's signature motion, it starts moving from Left to right, if at any time helmet(another game object) passes underneath it, it starts moving down and stops after 1.0 seconds, then whole cycle repeats.</p>

<p>5) It moves LTR &amp; RTL until it starts to move down when it finds the helmet underneath it.</p>

<p>Now the problem is, sometimes the behavior is exactly same as expected.
And many many times, it starts moving upwards and I have never set the y bit for motion vector in positive direction.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest me what Am I doing wrong here?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance...!!</p>

<p>We add all the FontFamily objects from ""Fonts.SystemFontFamilies"" as the ItemsSource of the combo box.  We need to be able to show the localized names of these fonts if they exist within each FontFamily.</p>

<p>I'm currently assuming that the text we see displayed for each ComboBoxItem is the Source property of the FontFamily objects we set as the ItemsSource.  Is there a simple way to localize this source?  I have been able to get the localized names using:</p>

<pre><code>font.FamilyNames.TryGetValue(XmlLanguage.GetLanguage(""ja-JP""), out name);
</code></pre>

<p>but as FontFamily.Source is readonly, I am unable to assign this new name to the FontFamily objects.</p>

<p>-- UPDATE --</p>

<p>We have decided not to use a class that contains a font family due to complications with integrating it with the application.  I want to try using a value converter to avoid having to change the underlying code.</p>

<p>I have the following value converter class:</p>

<pre><code>class FontValueConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        FontFamily font = (FontFamily)value;
        string localizedName = font.FamilyNames[XmlLanguage.GetLanguage(culture.Name)];

        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(localizedName))
            return localizedName;

        return font.ToString();
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        throw new NotSupportedException(""ConvertBack not supported"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to bind this to the ComboBoxItem objects. We set the ItemsSource in the code behind file; basically ""ItemsSource = collectionOfFonts"".  What I want to do is bind my converter to each item in ItemsSource so that it will converter to the localized font family name.</p>

<p>I have been considering the following XAML:</p>

<pre><code>         &lt;Style
            x:Key=""ComboBoxItemStyle""
            TargetType=""{x:Type ComboBoxItem}""&gt;
            &lt;Setter
                Property=""Template""&gt;
                &lt;Setter.Value&gt;
                    &lt;ControlTemplate
                        TargetType=""{x:Type ComboBoxItem}""&gt;
                        &lt;ContentPresenter
                            Content=""{Binding Source=..., Converter={StaticResource FontValueConverter}}"" /&gt;
                    &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
                &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
            &lt;/Setter&gt;
        &lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I am confused as to how I can bind so it retrieves a FontFamily object and converts it to a string to return as the value to be displayed.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>i am a bit confused with the <code>#include *.h</code> file inclusion in both the header and cpp files. I see that some .h files are included in the header file and some in the corresponding cpp file. I would guess that all needed .h files would need to be included in the header file and thus do not see a reason why they have been included in the cpp file. Is there any specific reason for this?</p>

<p>Also, I see that some needed classes have been included in the header file using <code>Class ClassName;</code>. How is this different from just including the <code>ClassName.h</code> in the header file?  </p>

The <a href=""https://github.com/guidog/pyzmq-mdp/blob/master/mdp/myclient.py"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a> in the repository for the client, is something I don't quite understand.</p>

<p>In the myclient.py, the example creates a socket manually without using the MDPClient API. And to make matters worse the mdp_request method is used for making a request. But I tried this so far:</p>

        print ""Client Timed out.""

    try:
        mdp_client.request([""hello""], timeout=5000)
    except RequestTimeout:
        print ""Timed Out.""

<p>I am solely running the client. No broker. But this is not raising the RequestTimeout exception. I have the following doubts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why isn't the example implementing the MDPClient API?</li>
<li>What is the purpose of mdp_request method when there is a request method available?</li>
<li>What is wrong with my approach?</li>

Does anyone know a good way of doing this? At the moment I am using Altova Mapforce, but the sheer size of the XSD to Database mapping that I am doing results in Mapforce crashing.</p>

<p>I am open to any suggestions that would get the xml files into our SQL 2005 Database.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>To elaborate. We have received around 150,000 xml files from a data provider, along with the 39 accompanying XSDs. I am trying to create database structure from the XSDs and then import the XML files. Currently I have used MapForce to create the object structure in C#, and i've then created the database structure from the objects. I am now using MapForce to map the XSD structure to the database structure - This then creates some C# code which you can run to populate the data from your xml files to the database by supply a directory location which contains your XML files.
The problem I am having at the moment, is that the Mapforce generated code now crashes (System.OutOfMemoryException) when ever I run it. I can only assume this is to do with the level of complexity there is now, as it used to work fine when the mappings were still being built up (and quite simple).</p>

<p>I am know open to suggestions of differing ways to build up my database structure from the 39 XSDs and populate it with the 150,000 xml files.</p>

<p>I've written a simple MovieClip replacement that converts an existing imported MovieClip to a sequence of BitmapData. This removes the requirement for Flash to render vector data in the MovieClip on each frame.</p>

<p>But BitmapData has a huge memory footprint. I've tried converting the BitmapData to a ByteArray and using the compress() method. This results in a significantly smaller memory footprint. But it has proven impractical. For each redraw, I tried uncompressing()'ing the ByteArray, then using SetPixels to blit the data to the screen, then re-compressing() the frame. This works but is terribly slow.</p>

<p>So I was wondering if anybody else has an approach I could try. In Flash, is it possible to compress bitmap data in memory and quickly blit it to the screen?</p>

<p>I wonder how native animated GIFs work in Flash. Does it uncompress them to BitmapData behind the scenes, or is frame decompression done on the fly?</p>

<p>Perhaps there is an Alchemy project that attempts to blit compressed images?</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice you can offer :)</p>

This type as a User Reference Field called ""Project Author(s)"" and another user Reference Field called ""Project Supervisor(s)"". These fields are mutivalue fields (can have 1 to unlimited values) and belong to a FieldGroup called ""Project Info"".</p>

<p>I also have installed the Content Profile Module, which enables me to add cck fields to user profile pages. So, I added two Custom Fields to user profile content type called ""First name"" and ""Last Name"".</p>

<p>Using panels3, I created a custom content pane with a table (code below)</p>

<p>Problem: Although %node:field_project_authors, %node:field_project_supervisors and %node:field_project_coop are muti value fields, only the first item (delta) is shown.For instance, if Project A has 2 authors (john and marie) only john is shown.<br />
Same happens when I try to show user's first name and last name instead of %node:field_project_authors. Only the first author's names are shown. (I'm using author's user reference as relationship)</p>

<p><strong>Question: How can I show all values (deltas) of a mutivalue cck field?</strong></p>

<p>Side-notes:<br />
1)In my first approach, I used views2 to pull authors and supervisors from the database and then add them to panels but I had a lot of issues regarding formatting and duplicated information that I couldn't really address.&lt; br />
2) I'm open to any suggestions that you think might solve this issue. I'm even open to hardcode it in PHP if you can point me in the right dirrection (i'm pretty new to Srupal so...)</p>

<pre><code>void repturno(void){

<ol>
<li><p>I can't get the cursor to go down to the next line and print it (need to do this 4 times), everything just gets messy and I end up with the same string and its line printed all over the screen many times. </p></li>
<li><p>I can't save all the data pertinent to each employee in a single line (it would solve the problem in this function, but would create other problems); there's too much info for each employee, way more than the 80 characters allowed in the console and it messes up other parts of my program where I have to display the information on the screen and it looks really bad when i print it, even when trying to use <code>gotoxy</code> or <code>'\t'</code> for proper spacing.  I had to save the data line by line, each category in a different line, so I can properly display it in other parts of my programs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I came with 2 solutions in pseudo-code, but i don't know how to translate them into C++ sentences:
<strong>NOTE:</strong> the search loop is already defined in the code above, so won't break it down step by step in the pseudo-code, will refer to it as <em>SEARCH LOOP</em></p>

<h2>Pseudo-code #1</h2>

<pre><code>START SEARCH LOOP
  SEARCH for the desired string(`codemp`) line by line
  IF string is found
    PRINTLINE containing the STRING
    MOVE CURSOR one line below
    PRINT the entire line
    MOVE CURSOR one line below
    PRINT the entire line
    MOVE CURSOR one line below
    PRINT the entire line
    MOVE CURSOR one line below
    PRINT the entire line
    Move CURSOR one line below
RESTART SEARCH LOOP in the current line
  IF NO matching string is found AND EOF
  END IF
END SEARCH LOOP
END PROGRAM
</code></pre>

<h2>Psuedo-code #2</h2>

<pre><code>  START SEARCH LOOP
   SEARCH for the desired string(codemp) line by line
     IF string is found
       PRINTLINE containing the string
       PRINTING LOOP
         MOVE CURSOR one line below
         ASSIGN line to a temp_string
           IF temp_string = ""\n\n"" 
             //each employee is separated by 2 whitelines after its info
             DO NOTHING
           ELSE 
             PRINTLINE temp_string
             RESTART PRINTING LOOP
           END IF
       END PRINTING LOOP
 RESTART SEARCH LOOP
 IF NO string is found AND EOF
 END SEARCH LOOP
 END PROGRAM

<p>I hope this is clear and detailed enough. That's what I want to do with my program, but I can't find a way to translate it into c++ sentences. Please let me know if there's a better, or more efficient way to do what I want to do.</p>

"15179407","1","","","2013-03-02 21:03:06","","2","331","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I am currently prototyping a (very straight-forward?) multi-tenant web-application where users (stored in database <strong>1</strong>) can register to different tenants (stored in a database <strong>per</strong> tenant (same db schema). An architecture that I thought would apply to a lot of multi tenant solutions. </p>

<p>Sadly, I found out that cross database relations are not supported in Entity Framework (I assumed it's still the case for EF6). I provided the links below. </p>

<p>The next short sections explain my problem, and ultimately my question(s).</p>

<h2>The rational behind the design</h2>

<p>I choose to have separate databases; one for users (1), and one for each tenant with their customer specific information. That way a user does not have to create a new account when he joins another tenant (one customer can have different domains for different departments).</p>

<h2>How it's implemented</h2>

<p>I implemented this using two different <code>DbContext</code>s, one for the users, and one for the tenant information. In the <code>TenantContext</code> I define <code>DbSet</code>s which holds entities which refer to the <code>User</code> entity (navigation properties).</p>

<p>The 'per-tenant' context:</p>

<pre><code>public class CaseApplicationContext : DbContext, IDbContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;CaseType&gt; CaseTypes { get; set; } 
    public DbSet&lt;Case&gt; Cases { get; set; }

    // left out some irrelevant code
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Case</code> entity:</p>

<pre><code>[Table(""Cases"")]
public class Case : IEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public User Owner { get; set; } // &lt;== the navigation property
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }

    public Case()
    {
        Tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>User</code> entity</p>

<pre><code>[Table(""Users"")]
public class User : IEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string EmailAddress { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>User</code> entity is also contained by the <code>Users</code> database by my other DbContext derivative:</p>

<pre><code>public class TenantApplicationContext : DbContext, IDbContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;Tenant&gt; Tenants { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; } // &lt;== here it is again

    // left out irrelevant code
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Now, what goes wrong?</h2>

<p><strong>Expected:</strong></p>

<p>What I (in all my stupidity) <strong>thought</strong> that would happen is that I would actually create a cross database relation:</p>

<p>The 'per-tenant' database contains a table 'Cases'. This table contains rows with a 'UserID'. The 'UserID' refers to the 'Users' database.</p>

<p><strong>Actual:</strong></p>

<p>When I start adding <code>Case</code>s I am also creating <em>another</em> table 'Users' in my 'per-tenant' database. In my 'cases' table the <code>UserID</code> refers to the table in the same database.</p>

<h2>Cross database relations do not exist in EF</h2>

<p>So I started googling, and found that this feature simply is not supported. This made me think, should I even use EF for an application like this? Should I move towards NHibernate instead? </p>

<p>But I also can't imagine that the <strong>huge</strong> market for multi tenant applications simply is ignored by Microsoft's Entity Framework?! So I most probably am doing something rather stupid. </p>

<h2>Finally, the question...</h2>

<p>I think the main question is about my 'database design'. Since I am new to EF and learning as I go, I might have taken the wrong turn on several occasions (is my design broken?). Since SO is well represented with EF experts I am very eager to learn which alternatives I could use to achieve the same thing (multi tenant, shared users, deployable in azure). Should I use one single <code>DbContext</code> and still be able to deploy a multi tenant web-application with a shared <code>Users</code> database? </p>

<p>I'd really appreciate your help!</p>

<p>Things learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>NHibernate does support cross database relations (but I want to deploy into Azure and rather stick to microsoft technologies)</li>
<li>Views or Synomyms can be an alternative (not sure if that will cause more difficulties in Azure)</li>

"29567069","1","","","2015-04-10 17:12:02","","1","533","<p>One thing I do not understand when using <strong>ControllerLinkBuilder</strong> with <strong>methodOn</strong> feature is what are you suppose to do when your Controller has method signature like so:</p>

<pre><code>public HttpEntity&lt;ResourceSupport&gt; update(@PathVariable(USER_ID) Long userId, @Valid @RequestBody UserUpdateRequest userUpdateRequest, BindingResult bindingResult)
</code></pre>

<p>So whenever I wish to use <strong>methodOn</strong>, how am I to fill the blanks like <strong>UserUpdateRequest</strong> argument and <strong>BindingResult</strong> (I use binding result to handle bad request exceptions with @ControllerAdvice and JSR 303 to make output messages human readable).</p>

<p>When I wish use out of the box spring HATEOAS <strong>ControllerLinkBuilder</strong> for more ease with <strong>methodOn</strong> I end up writing something like this (mind me I do not know if this will not backfire but the code does not look comforting): </p>

<pre><code>resource.add(linkTo(methodOn(UserController.class).update(userId, null, null)).withSelfRel());
</code></pre>

<p>Ofcourse I can omit the <strong>methodOn</strong> part and just use <strong>linkTo</strong> which would then require me to play around building the path.</p>

<p>Is it appropriate to just pass on <strong>null</strong> refs ? Plus how is it convenient using <strong>methodOn</strong> as if you decide to remove say: <strong>BindingResult</strong> or add something like <strong>HttpServletRequest</strong> to the controller method signature so that spring could pass me more info about request if I wanted to log an IP address for some security reason. This would require me to go and change the link construction part using <strong>methodOn</strong>.</p>

<p>Another question that is bit boggling me is say I pass a legitimate ref to <strong>methodOn</strong> like <strong>userUpdateRequest</strong> filled with data - does that data suppose to go anywhere with the generated link ? I've seen some Hypermedia that include along with rel and href a body of what you pass - is that possible with Spring HATEOAS and is it a good practice to create links with ready to post/put payloads in them ?</p>

<p>But getting back to <strong>ControllerLinkBuilder</strong> using only <strong>linkTo</strong> method building links with <strong>.slash(""..."")</strong> - is it potentially less maintenance costly ?</p>

<p>In day to day practice what would you recommend and what do you think about link construction ? Maybe someone could provide professional tips/advices.</p>

<p>Thank You,</p>

<p>Each row has different labels, one like button and one dislike button. </p>

<p>I do know how to use NSIndexPath.row to detect which row is pressed, but In this case I need to know both which row and which buttton in that row is pressed. </p>

<p>I have searched all over SO for a good solution to detecting which row a button is clicked when having multiple buttons per row. </p>

<p>From what I understand reading the other posts, using button.tag can be very unpredictable so I rather use a different method if possible. </p>

<p>I have seen many apps that have this implemented, so there has to be an optimal way to do this. Does anyone have any good suggestions?</p>

@property (nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UILabel *album_label;

@property (nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UIButton *likebutton2;
@property (nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UIButton *dislikebutton2;

<p>The issue that comes up has to do with the individual dependencies of the plugin libraries. An example is Ionic.Zip and Newtonsoft.Json. Since Nugget is used when developing these external parts, different plugins tend to reference different version of these libraries. The application may even load its own (in the case of Newtonsoft.Json). </p>

<p>What I've realized it that the plugin libraries are looking for a specific version of these libraries and hence throw errors when certain tasks are run.</p>

<p>Is there a way to indicate during development that a plugin should not be bound to any particular version of the library so that it will just make use of whatever is loaded?</p>

<p>That way it does not matter which version of Newtonsoft.Json or Ionic.Zip a plugin is linked to, it will just use the version that has been loaded by the main application.</p>

<p>If I set a breakpoint and try to debug pressing (F10) it is returning before the method finished with error, if I don't do that it workds fine, it looks like a time out, I guess that if you use your method async it has a specific time to wait and if it doesn't get a response then it goes back, but If it'd be a timeout I guess textStatus would say ""timeout"" instead of error so I want to know what is going on.</p>

<p>Anothing detail is that if I use ""async: false"", everything works perfectly. </p>

Nodejs uses sockets.io to ""talk"" to the HTML page listening to it. As new data arrives for a hashtag I subscribed to, nodejs emits the data out to HTML page. Here is little bit of implementation:</p>

<p><strong>nodejs server.js</strong></p>

<pre><code>var clientID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
    clientSecret = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';

var hashtag = ""love"";
Instagram.set('client_id', clientID);
Instagram.set('client_secret', clientSecret);
Instagram.set('callback_url', 'https://mynodeurl.com/callback');
Instagram.set('redirect_uri', 'http://mynodeurl.com');
Instagram.set('maxSockets', 10);

//Subscribe to hashtag
Instagram.subscriptions.subscribe({
    object: 'tag',
    object_id: hashtag,
    aspect: 'media',
    callback_url: 'http://mynodeurl.com/callback',
    type: 'subscription',
    id: '#'
});

var io = require('socket.io').listen(app.listen(port));
io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
console.log(""Client Connected"");
});

app.get('/callback', function(req, res){
    var handshake =  Instagram.subscriptions.handshake(req, res);
    io.socket.emit('log', { message: 'handshake acquired' });
});

app.post('/callback', function(req, res) {
    var data = req.body;
    var url = 'https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/' + hashtag + '/media/recent?client_id='+clientID;
    console.log(""New data has arrived. Going to post to HTML page"");
    sendMessage(url); //Sends the data to HTML page via socket
});

function sendMessage(url) { 
  io.sockets.emit('newdata', { show: url });
}
</code></pre>

<p>HTML page listening to socket is implemented as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instagram realtime demo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""newdata&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://mynodeurl.com/sockets.io/sockets.io.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
(function($){
  $(document).ready(){
    socket = io.connect(""http://mynodeurl.com"");
    if(socket){
      socket.on('newdata', function (data) {            
         shownewpics(data.show);
      });
    }

  function shownewpics(url){
       $.ajax({
            url: url,
            type: 'POST',
            crossDomain: true,
            dataType: 'jsonp'
        }).done(function (data) {
            showImages(data.data);
        }); 
  }

  function  showImages(images){
    for(var i=0;i&lt;images.length;i++){
     $(""#newdata ul"").prepend(""&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src='""+images[i].images.thumbnail.url+""' /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"");
    }
  }
  });
})(jQuery);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

<p>New data comes up pretty fast for some tags(ex- nyc). Say 10 data per 2 seconds. Making that much ajax request would be too extreme. I am confused what alternative(or algorithm?) could I use to refresh data only after some time? I could think of waiting 2 seconds before making subsequent requests but what if the data comes up after delay. How should a timer wait for such scenarios?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>As you can see, the letters are clustered into groups of two and three.

The only way is to catch the exception, check the identifier, and rethrow the error if this particular error can not be handled. That's acceptable though inconvenient. However, when I use Matlabs <code>dbstop if error</code>, I end up at the <code>ME.rethrow()</code> line. I'm then unable to <code>dbup</code> back to the place where the <em>original</em> error was caused.</p>

<pre><code>function test_excc

try
    sub_test()
catch ME
    if strcmp(ME.identifier, 'test:notsobad')
        fprintf(1, 'Fine\n');
    else
        ME.rethrow();
    end
end

end

function sub_test
sub_sub_test();
end

function sub_sub_test()
if rand&gt;0.5
    error('test:error', 'Noooo!');
else
    error('test:notsobad', 'That''OK');
end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; test_excc()
Error using test_excc&gt;sub_sub_test (line 21)
Noooo!

Error in test_excc&gt;sub_test (line 16)
sub_sub_test();

Error in test_excc (line 4)
    sub_test()

9           ME.rethrow();
K&gt;&gt; dbstack
&gt; In test_excc at 9
</code></pre>

<p>Although the Matlab desktop environment prints the entire stack trace back to <code>sub_sub_test</code>, the debugger does not give me the possibility to go up the stack trace and debug inside this function.</p>

<p>I am aware of <code>dbstop if caught error</code>. However, this will debug into <em>any</em> caught error, which may be many if software makes heavy use of exceptions. I only want to stop on uncaught errors, but I want to stop where the error is generated — not where it's rethrown.</p>

<p>My question:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Matlab, how do I conditionally catch an error (based on error identifier) and debug into the place where the error is originally thrown?</li>

<p>Also If I want to increase the number of mappers and reducers then how to set it and upto what value do I set it. Is it depend upon the number of instances (Lets say 10)?</p>

<p>Please reply me I want to try this and check the performance.

<p>It works perfectly, so the following redirects work:</p>

<pre><code>example.com                 -&gt; example.com/public/
example.com/foo/            -&gt; example.com/public/foo/
example.com/foo/about.html  -&gt; example.com/public/foo/about.html
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, the following redirect has a problem:</p>

<pre><code>example.com/foo             -&gt; example.com/public/foo
</code></pre>

<p>Although it redirects correctly, the actual URL in the address bar is:</p>

<pre><code>example.com/public/foo/
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<h3>How can I have a <em>clean URL</em> when redirecting from a URL without a forward slash?</h3>

<p>Hope it makes sense. </p>

I have a main activity - and about activity, in which I show the paypal button. About activity accessed from the main Activity.
Paypal object is initialized in a thread, created from the OnCreate of the Application object.</p>

<p>I am now facing 2 issues:
1. Paypal button works only the first time I click on it. The second time does not work. I have to go back to the main menu and then back to the about Activity, then it works again.
Here is:</p>

<p>Code to add the paypal button to the layout:</p>

<pre><code>mDonateButton = AppObj.Instance().GetPayPalObj().getCheckoutButton( mCaller, 
                                                                            PayPal.BUTTON_152x33, 
                                                                            CheckoutButton.TEXT_PAY );
LinearLayout.LayoutParams params = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(   LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, 
                                                                    LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT );
mDonateButton.setLayoutParams(params);
mDonateButton.setGravity( Gravity.CENTER_HORIZONTAL );
mDonateButton.setOnClickListener( this );

LinearLayout container = (LinearLayout) findViewById( R.id.donateLayout );
container.addView(mDonateButton);
</code></pre>

<p>The OnClick related code:</p>

<pre><code>                PayPalPayment newPayment = new PayPalPayment();
                newPayment.setSubtotal(new BigDecimal(Integer.parseInt(info)));
                newPayment.setCurrencyType(""USD"");
                newPayment.setRecipient(""xxx@xxx.com"");
                newPayment.setPaymentType(PayPal.PAYMENT_TYPE_NONE);
                newPayment.setMerchantName(""xxx"");
                Intent paypalIntent = PayPal.getInstance().checkout(newPayment, mCaller);
                (mCaller).startActivityForResult(paypalIntent, 1);
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Second issue I have.... Since I init the paypal obj in the BG, if I access the About activity (in which the paypal button created) BEFORE the paypal finished initializing, the I crash......
Any ideas about it?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks

<p>Kernels is a <code>namedtuple('Kernel', 'mean covariance weight')</code>, mean is a vector, covariance is a <code>3x3</code> matrix with everything but the diagonal being zero and weight is a float <code>0 &lt; weight &lt; 1</code>.

<p>This is the code to get the number from the UITextField:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumberFormatter * f = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
[f setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterDecimalStyle];
NSNumber *currentNumber = [f numberFromString:self.textfield.text];
[f release];

<p>The lower bound is often 0.1 (<code>lowerBound</code> is an NSNumber)</p>

<p>If I have this code and I enter 0.1 into the textfield, then <code>isValid</code> remains <code>YES</code>.</p>

<pre><code>BOOL isValid = YES;
if ([currentNumber floatValue] &lt; [self.lowerBound floatValue]) {
    isValid = NO;
}

<p>However I though it would be better to do:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL isValid = YES;
if ([currentNumber compare:self.lowerBound] == NSOrderedAscending) {
    isValid = NO;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However I enter 0.1 again (and the lowerBound is still 0.1) the if statement evaluates to true (as if currentNumber is less than self.lowerBound).</p>

<p>The code works as expected for 0.11 and above. I also have a higher bound:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL isValid = YES;
if ([currentNumber compare:self.higherBound] == NSOrderDescending) {
    isValid = NO;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this works as expected, including when I enter the same value as the higherBound (10 in most cases)</p>

<p>As I understand it the <code>compare:</code> method on NSNumber compares the values and not the addresses of the objects, so why doesn't it work on the lower bound?</p>

<p>Is there any difference in speed? Does using imageByFilterImage allow you to set up filters as a 'pipeline' which you can re-use or something like that?

The Wordpress (WP) Multi-site (MU) that I want to point to is aquizone.net/blogs/pra where that directory is virtually handled by the WP MU and the .htaccess under aquizone.net/blogs.</p>

<p>I am assuming that I can change the .htaccess file under aquizone.net/blogs/link/pra to point to aquizone.net/blogs/pra and have the subdomain wind up resulting at aquizone.net/blogs/pra.  Only everything I have tried does not work.  Here is my currect .htaccess file:</p>

<pre><code># Use PHP5 Single php.ini as default
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5s .php

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^pra.*$ http://aquilone.me/blogs/pra/ [R=301,L]
</code></pre>

<p>The AddHandler was placed there by the subdomain creation and taking it out or leaving it makes no difference.  It does not work. You can go to <a href=""http://aquilone.me/blogs/links/pra/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aquilone.me/blogs/links/pra/</a> and see it does not redirect.</p>

I use to receive Jsons from a server and I extract some information from them. Everything is working perfectly, except for one user account : I only get the first character of the attributes.</p>

<p>For example, if the Json is like that :</p>

<pre><code>{
    name : ""Joey""
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I extract the name attribute, I get the string ""J"".
I have to precise that it works perfectly with all other user accounts.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about an encoding problem ?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your answers.</p>

<p>EDIT :</p>

<p>Here is how I get the server's response :</p>

<pre><code>+ (void)getDataFromServ:(NSString *)urlServ withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(NSDictionary *dataDic))completion {

   NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:urlServ]];
   [request setHTTPMethod:@""GET""];

   NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sharedSession];
   NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [session dataTaskWithRequest:request completionHandler: ^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
       if (error) {
           return;
       }

       NSDictionary *serDataDic = nil;
       NSError* parseError;
       if (data) {

           serDataDic = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:0 error:&amp;parseError];
           completion(serDataDic);
       }
   }];

   [task resume];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is how I process the response : </p>

<pre><code>...

[self getDataFromServ:urlServ withCompletionHandler:^(NSDictionary *dataDic) {

        NSDictionary *response = [dataDic objectForKey:@""data""];

        NSLog(@""Response : %@"", response);
        NSLog (@""Name : %@"", [response objectForKey:@""name""]);

...
}

<p>Here are the related logs :</p>

<pre><code>Response : 
{
    name = ""Joey"";
}

Name : J
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT 2 :</p>

<p>An other thing I just noticed, when I extract an attribute and calculate its length, the length is longer than the attribute.
For example, when I have a attribute with 15 characters, the calculated length is 29 but the attribute still appears with only one character.</p>

<p>EDIT 3 :</p>

<p>I tested something else : </p>

<pre><code>for (NSInteger j = 0; j &lt; displayNameStr.length; j++) {

<p>As you can see, ive logged the height and width of the label. The width stays a constant 280 which is correct and the height changes dynamically depending the text. Everything looks as if it should be working fine. But sadly it doesnt. The cell resizes fine. The label (judging from the NSLogs) seems to resize fine, so why does my text get cut off? </p>

<p>I am not sure how to make it synchronously, which means redirect to my controller only after the post back is called by Google! 
Also, how do I test post back with localhost?</p>

<p>Or is there a method which I can call on Google API which will give me status of the transaction?</p>

<p>---EDIT---</p>

<p>I wonder, if google wallet popup only shows success after calling the post back. Even if that's true how do I test it with localhost?</p>

<p>The reason for the above two questions is, if someone tries to read the same memory (a memory

<p>It seems like when I create a new project, it is targeted for the iPhone 5 (The UI editor has a taller screen in the layout) but the simulator is an iPhone 4 (the screen is not as long)  All so When I layout the UI in Xcode, the simulator sometimes draws things at different vertical positions.  </p>

<p>Is there a way to get a simulator for iPhone 5?
Can you create a project that has it so the UI editor is targeted for the older iPhone, iPhone 4?</p>

I understand this is a very basic question and it would be incredibly easy for me to do in something like java, but I'm having difficulty understanding SML.  I need to write a function intsFromTo. It should take a pair of integers, low and high, and return a list of consecutive integers in ascending order, namely all those that are greater than or equal to low and less than or equal to high.</p>

<p>Here's what I have so far</p>

<pre><code>fun intsFromTo (low,high) = val intList = []
if low &gt;= high then nill
else intList::low intsFromTo(low+1,high);

<pre><code>YUI().use(""node"", function(Y){
  var node = Y.one(""#my_element_id"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>It works great, cross-platform, cross-browser, etc. in almost every case. However, I was testing yesterday, and I came across one time it didn't work. It made no sense to me, the element I was trying to grab was:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""component_form"" method=""post"" action=""&lt;?php echo $_SERVER[""PHP_SELF""];?&gt;""&gt;
...
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I know for sure it is well-formed markup, so that's not the issue. If I do:</p>

<pre><code>YUI().use(""node"", function(Y){
  var node1 = Y.one(""#component_form"");
  var node2 = document.getElementById(""component_form"");
  var node3 = Y.one(document.getElementById(""component_form""));
});

<p>node1 is null, and node2 is the element I was looking for, and so is node3. </p>

<p>Hello, i just want to ask why the sql statement didn't read the first statement which is if there have the same username and s_id the user should change it. But it will print successful inserted into database but the data didn't have in the database because the username or s_id already have in database. Is there have any syntax error? Please help me</p>

<p>This is almost exactly as I would have hoped save for the fact that the detail lines are being duplicated for both sale lines when in reality they should only appear for their relevant sale line.  Matching the landingid's is clearly pulling out the right detail lines, just not sure what extra little tweak I'm missing.</p>

<p>At least the detail lines now match the sale lines, but it's producing a separate sale line for each detail line.  There's clearly one small bit missing.  I have tried a Group By LandingHeaders.LandingId but that seems to cause more problems.</p>

<p>It may seem a bit like I am going against the spirit of Lua but I really want to bullet proof the interface that I have between Lua and C++.

</code></pre>

<p>(The common criterion that all sources use to identify the user is the Windows AD principal in the form user@domain)</p>

<p>Do you know of a way to achieve this ? Implementing RFC4511 could be the solution but I don't want to start from scratch because the RFC is quite lengthy. Perhaps it is a viable solution to build something based on OpenDS/OpenDJ or ApacheDS but I have no idea they were designed with this in mind. On the other side an elegant solution might be persisting the API results in the LDAP but I don't know if this data must be retrieved using JPA again or if its valid to retrieve it using a LDAP query. I read something about the uboundid LDAP server SDK, perhaps this is another option.</p>

<p>All of this are just ideas, I have no experience in this area. Ideas are very appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks a lot for this information. I took a look at unboundid sdk and the example that starts up a ldap server and imports a ldif.
But your remarks about productive use make me think I perhaps consider a different solution although I definitely will come back to unboundid when I need to write jndi or ldap unit tests.</p>

<p>I'm now able to describe my needs better, perhaps this can be achieved by unboundid or you know another solution that makes me achieve this.
I will need to intercept queries, then invoke the API (see example above) in order to retrieve the data and then feed it to the underlying ldap directory. Perhaps unboundid offers an interface to this. Do you know something about this ? Or more about the design of ApacheDS ?
The reason for this interception is that the applications I can query contain some 100000 entries and I only want to copy those to the ldap who are needed.</p>

<p>Writing about this I see another option: perhaps it is possible to do some aop in order to intercept the call. What do you think ?</p>

<p>The updates are being made to the URLS node.  The user clicks an ""Add URL"" link and I add the new URL to this node like this.</p>

<pre><code>       &lt;URL ID=""u002""&gt;

          &lt;URL&gt;http://www.yahoo.com&lt;/URL&gt;

<p>There are no errors, everything seems to work, but the URLS node is empty.  Here is the PHP script.</p>

<pre><code>function add_url( $nodeid, $urlid, $urlname, $urllink ) {

if ($nodes-&gt;length) {
   $node = $nodes-&gt;item(0); 

   $xurl = $dom-&gt;createElement(""URL""); 
   $xurl-&gt;setAttribute(""ID"", $urlid);

   $xuname     = $dom-&gt;createElement(""NAME"");  
   $xunameText = $dom-&gt;createTextNode(mysql_escape_mimic($urlname));  
   $xuname-&gt;appendChild($xunameText); 

   $xulink     = $dom-&gt;createElement(""URL"");

   $xulink-&gt;appendChild($xulinkText); 

   $xurl-&gt;appendChild($xuname); 
   $xurl-&gt;appendChild($xulink); 

   $xurls = $xpath-&gt;query(""//COMMUNITY[@ID='$nodeid']/URLS"");

   if ($xurls-&gt;length) {
   }
   else {
      $xurls = $dom-&gt;createElement(""URLS""); 
   }

   $xurls-&gt;appendChild($xurl);

   /* $node-&gt;appendChild($xurls); */

}

$dom-&gt;save('communities.xml');
}
</code></pre>

<p>I thought the problem was that I was appending the URLS node when it already existed.  But I commented out that line.  I am sure the problem is simple, but I am new at this.  I looked on the site and did not find that specific situation.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

Rather than making multiple translate calls, I instead want to translate the triangle downward once and rotate around the Z axis at 60 degrees six times (my sketch may help with that explanation: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/SrrXcA3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/SrrXcA3.jpg</a>). After repeating the drawTriangle() and rotate() methods six times, I should have a hexagon.</p>

<pre><code>public void onDrawFrame(GL10 unused) 
{
    GLES20.glClear(GLES20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); //start by clearing the screen for each frame

Does not expect exact code to copy - paste, but if somebody can point me to good article / course section somewhere on the infinite web that would be perfect (what`s the point of copy paste if you not learn?)</p>

<p>1) I remember from my Uni times (need to submit some projects in ASP.NET MVC) there was something like partial views ... they where useful to generate interface etc.</p>

<p>Currently my view got 2 parts (navbar and main view). My every view passing for example:</p>

<pre><code>    template = loader.get_template('resultsetlist.html')
context = RequestContext(request, {
    'resultsets' : resultsets,
    'instance_list': instance_list,
    'latest_resultset': latest_resultset
})

return HttpResponse(template.render(context))
</code></pre>

<p>In this example my current view needs only resultsets object ... latest_resultset and instance_list objects are needed to generate navbar.</p>

<p>Template working like that:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div class=""row""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""col-md-11""&gt;
        {% include 'navbar.html' %}
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""row""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""col-md-11""&gt;
        {% block content %}

        {% endblock %}
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Can I generate my navbar in some other view (name it master) and create small views to any other actions (partial ones that will extend master)? Instead of copying the same line of codes in every of my view just to generate this navbar ...</strong></p>

<p>2) I<code>m not hidding as I may have idea about first questions ... I</code>m complete green in second one (no webdeveloper experience ajax, js etc.).</p>

<p>One of my views using for loop to go through list of results. Let`s say every of my result got 3 attributes:
- Name 
- Surname
- Description</p>

<p>I`m generating table with results:</p>

<pre><code>{% for resultset in resultsets %}
                        &lt;td&gt;{{ resultset.Name }}&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;{{ resultset.Instance.Surname }}&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I`m using only 2 fields and want to make a a button to show me last field in the popup ? This is my current try:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;{%  if resultset.Description %}
                    &lt;button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-primary btn-xs"" data-toggle=""modal"" data-target=""#descriptionmodal""&gt;
                            View SQL
                    &lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And modal:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=""modal fade"" id=""descriptionmodal"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""myModalLabel"" aria-hidden=""true"" data-id=""{{ resultset.Description }}""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""modal-dialog""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""modal-content""&gt;
      &lt;div class=""modal-header""&gt;
        &lt;button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""modal"" aria-label=""Close""&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=""true""&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;h4 class=""modal-title"" id=""myModalLabel""&gt;Modal title&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=""modal-body""&gt;
        {{ resultset.Description }}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=""modal-footer""&gt;
        &lt;button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-default"" data-dismiss=""modal""&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<pre><code>private static string AmpRemove(string str)

<p>Here I am trying to get text from a string until <code>&amp;</code> character is found. My senior modified this method to </p>

<pre><code>private static string AmpRemove(string str)
{
    if (str.IndexOf('&amp;') &gt; 0)
        str = str.Substring(0, str.IndexOf('&amp;'));
    return str;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So instead of storing the <code>index</code>, it will calculate it twice, and his reasoning was that since that method would be called in multiple threads, there could be invalid value stored in <code>index</code>. </p>

<p>My understanding of thread is limited, but I believe each thread would have its own stack, where the parameter <code>str</code> and <code>index</code> would be pushed. I have tried reasoning with him, that this is a reentrant code and there is no way that multiple threads could modify a local variable in this method. </p>

<p>So, my question is, Am I right in assuming that <strike>caching</strike> storing <code>index</code> is a better solution, since it will not involve calculating index twice and since it is local variable and <code>str</code> is a parameter local to method, there is no way that multiple threads could modify/change <code>str</code> and <code>index</code> ? </p>

<p>Is that correct ?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;audio id=""audioclip"" preload=""auto"" loop &gt;
    &lt;source src=""audio/music01.ogg"" type=""audio/ogg""&gt;
  &lt;/audio&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The same HTML document features an iframe containing a few Images. Clicking on one of these images browses to a page containing an autostart HTML5 video clip.</p>

<p>Of course now the audio from the parent AND the audio from the iframe video play at the same time.</p>

<p>Is there an EASY way to stop the parent audio playback from <em>inside</em> the iframe automatically when the autoplay video triggers?</p>

<p>I found some pretty complicated stuff for parent/child communication. Far to sophisticated for me. But I also found this little snippet:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function($) {  
    parent.$(""#parent_element"").trigger(event); 
} (window.jQuery)); 
</code></pre>

<p>Could I put that to use in my case?</p>

<p>Or are there alternatives?</p>

<p>Just getting into JavaScript a little more, atm I'd consider myself a newbie. :-\</p>

<p>Many Thanks!</p>

<p>PS: On video end the iframe page automatically browses back to the previous page. It would be super-nifty if the audio would resume playing at the Point IF it was playing before. If not then...well...not.  But I reckon that would be much more complex?</p>

<p>I have a body width of 960px so divided I divided it into 3 columns each of 300px X 3 so total of 900px and margin of 30px X 2 b/w two columns total of 60px.All together it sums upto 960px.</p>

<p>Now I have given 1st column width of 300px and used float property,so the second boxes alligns next to it so I have given a margin of 330px that is 20px so I get the job done.So i have a space left about 330px on the right,I gave the 3rd box a margin of 660px which is 20px and width of 300px.</p>

<p>I want the 3rd box to sit next to second which is not happening instead it goes to second line,I know I can use float-left two second box or use a float right to 3rd box.I want to know why this method is not working tough their is space.</p>

<p>In the second 1 I have used aside and section as inline-block even then it works,but the problem is,I have used 300px on all three boxes which has consumed 900px [300X3=900]My 'body' width is 960px when I give margin of 30px and 30px on the right the third box moves to second line but when I used 30px and 20px it stays why is that ?</p>

<p>The strange part is that I am able to connect to the API (http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2) with no problems when I do a GET request but there must be something I must be doing wrong with my signature when I try to create a POST.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

$consumer = new OAuthConsumer($consumer_key, $consumer_secret, null); 
$token = new OAuthConsumer($access_token['oauth_token'], $consumer_secret); 
$req_req = OAuthRequest::from_consumer_and_token($consumer, $token, 
""POST"", 'http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/MY_URL/post', $params); 
$req_req-&gt;sign_request(new OAuthSignatureMethod_HMAC_SHA1(), 
$consumer, $token, null); 
$result = $req_req-&gt;to_postdata(); 

$ch = curl_init('http://www.tumblr.com/api/write');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://www.tumblr.com/api/write'); 
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); 
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $result); 
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>var_dump</code> of <code>$result</code> echoes the following</p>

<pre><code>oauth_consumer_key=xxxxxxxx&amp;oauth_nonce=xxxxxxx&amp;oauth_signature=xxxxxx
&amp;oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&amp;oauth_timestamp=1325033502&amp;oauth_token=xxxxxx
&amp;oauth_version=1.0""e=test&amp;type=quote
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure the <code>curl_init</code> must be calling <code>http://www.tumblr.com/api/write</code> but I also tried with <code>api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/{base-hostname}/post</code> with no luck</p>

<p>I guess this is language-dependent, and probably defeats the purpose of using JSON as a ""standard"" exchange format in the first place, but if we, <em>at least</em>, consider using the same language on both sides, how would you do this?</p>

<p>A typical use case would be for example: how to exchange date time objects without resorting too much on ad-hoc code when serializing/deserializing.</p>

<p>I would like to have groups of nodes, in a tree-like structure where each root is either the main root, or is a descendant of a leaf from another tree.</p>

<p>Generating what you see below is easy, but what I'd really like to see is complete circles around each root. However, since the nodes are repelling each other the below gaps are present between each cluster. <em>I assume the solution involves ignoring the repulsion caused by charges between leaves coming from different roots</em>.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RAxxo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>My ideas</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set some sort of radius around each root which repels other nodes in all directions beyond that radius, allowing the leaves to be circular within it</li>
<li>Use linkDistances and linkStrengths to somehow arrange the clusters in a way that they do not interact significantly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is this possible?</strong></p>

<p>Other than my vague ideas, I really have no clue how to do this!</p>

<p>From reading the D3 docs, I found that unlike the dynamic linkDistance and linkStrength methods, node charge manipulations seem to be universal:</p>

<pre><code>""All nodes are assumed to be infinitesimal points with equal charge and mass.""
</code></pre>

<p>If this statement is true, can one of you guys please guide me in the right direction?</p>

<p>The <code>Username</code> can be anything. Same goes for the end part <code>this is a message</code>.</p>

<p>What I want to do is extract the <strong><em>Username</em></strong> that comes after the pound sign <code>#</code>. Not from any other place in the string, since that can vary aswell. I also want to get the <strong><em>message</em></strong> from the string that comes after the semicolon <code>:</code>. </p>

<p>I tried that with the following regex. But it never outputs any results.</p>

<pre><code>regex rgx(""WEBMSG #([a-zA-Z0-9]) :(.*?)"");
smatch matches;

for(size_t i=0; i&lt;matches.size(); ++i) {

I need to get the resulting image url to save it in a database and then I will use that url to send the image to the server (that is done this way only when the is no internet connection available). All this works I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info
{
UIImage *image=[info objectForKey:@""UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage""];

NSURL *url=[info objectForKey:@""UIImagePickerControllerReferenceURL""];
NSLog(@""%@"",url);

//(.....)
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I save the url to database I just pass it as if it was a string parameter and it works and I have looked in the database the url is there in the form:</p>

<p>assets-library://asset/asset.JPG?id=5A900026-5994-4F93-8A49-D2C96BDA2659&amp;ext=JPG</p>

<p>my problem is when I try to use this url either to get image or to get data it gives me error or empty object:</p>

<pre><code>NSData *dataForFile =[[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[url path]];
UIImage *img=[[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[url path]];

<p>url path=asset.JPG/ strange....</p>

<p>I also tried like this:</p>

<pre><code> NSData *dataForFile =[[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:url];
 UIImage *img=[[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:url];

<p>but it also doesn't work. I only need either of them a data object or an image (from image I can get data), how could I do that? Thanks a lot</p>

Here is the source code of that <a href=""http://www.cs.smith.edu/~nhowe/research/code/FGseg.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.smith.edu/~nhowe/research/code/FGseg.zip</a>.
When I compiled this source code in matlab (I mean the gcut.cpp file) I faced with this error:</p>

<p>After receiving these errors, with consideration, I've found the sources of the problems:(Here's the essential part of the code that generates the problem)</p>

<pre><code>bool sparse;
int *ir, *jc;
double *cost, *ss;

// check format of arguments
if (mxIsSparse(prhs[0])) {
   sparse = true;
} else if (mxIsDouble(prhs[0])&amp;&amp;!mxIsComplex(prhs[0])) {
   sparse = false;
} else {
   mexErrMsgTxt(""Cost matrix must be type double or sparse."");
}
n = mxGetM(prhs[0]);
if (mxGetN(prhs[0]) != n) {
mexErrMsgTxt(""Cost matrix must be square."");
}
cost = mxGetPr(prhs[0]);
if (sparse) {
ir = (int *)mxGetIr(prhs[0]);*// before alteration ( ir = mxGetIr(prhs[0]); )*
jc = (int *)mxGetJc(prhs[0]);*// before alteration ( ir = mxGetIr(prhs[0]); )*
</code></pre>

<p>finally after above alteration:
I received these errors:</p>

The bounce messages are always cryptic saying to make sure the email is RFC 5322 compliant, ensure I have a valid RDNS entry, emsure my HELO is valid, and a myriad of other random suggestions.  But the rejection message never tells me precisely what is wrong or that any of these things are indeed not correct, just that I should 'check them' (I figure they don't want to expose their algorithms and checks).  I have a reasonable grasp of how all of this works.  But I'm not a complete guru on the details of all of the RFCs and specs.  And even taking weeks to read the spec will not likely help me catch that I have a ';' where I needed a '>'.</p>

<p>Before I start just shooting in the dark, I'd like to find out if there is a service that I can send a dummy email to and have it report back to me all of the areas where I am not in compliance with RFCs, etc.  This is not just the format of the email headers, etc, although I need that as well.  I need to know if my server is completely compliant with SMTP specs, DNS specs, etc. And if not, what I need to fix.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to get around spam rules.  I just have client email that needs a reasonable guarantee that it will get there.  I figure I'll still have hurdles to overcome after I'm 100% compliant.  But verifying that I am indeed fully compliant with all of the rules and specs is the first step.</p>

<p>So, can anyone suggest a site that I can send an email to and get a report back on all of the SMTP, RFC, DNS, DKIM, SPF, etc things that aren't correct or could be improved?</p>

As a test I am simply trying to replicate the code found in the jBPM Full Installer's evaluation sample into the template code produced by a Maven JavaEE6 Archetype.  I have noted my steps below so that the problem can be easily reproduced.</p>

<p>1) Add to the JBoss standalone.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;datasource jndi-name=""java:jboss/jdbc/jbpm-ds"" pool-name=""jBPMDS"" enabled=""true"" use-java-context=""true""&gt;
    &lt;connection-url&gt;jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1&lt;/connection-url&gt;
    &lt;driver&gt;h2&lt;/driver&gt;
    &lt;security&gt;
        &lt;user-name&gt;sa&lt;/user-name&gt;
        &lt;password&gt;sa&lt;/password&gt;
    &lt;/security&gt;
&lt;/datasource&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2) JBoss Central > Maven Project > filter on ""javaee6"" (to create the ""myservlet"" Project):
    Archetype = jboss-javaee6-webapp
    Accept all defaults</p>

<p>3) Set src\main\resources\META-INF\persistence.xml to contain:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;persistence version=""2.0""
   xmlns=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
   xsi:schemaLocation=""
        http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence
        http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd""&gt;
   &lt;persistence-unit name=""primary""&gt;
      &lt;!-- If you are running in a production environment, add a managed 
         data source, the example data source is just for proofs of concept! --&gt;
      &lt;jta-data-source&gt;java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS&lt;/jta-data-source&gt;
      &lt;properties&gt;
         &lt;!-- Properties for Hibernate --&gt;
         &lt;property name=""hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto"" value=""create-drop"" /&gt;
         &lt;property name=""hibernate.show_sql"" value=""false"" /&gt;
      &lt;/properties&gt;
   &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;
&lt;/persistence&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>4) Add a jBPM Runtime by pointing at the \runtime folder from the jBPM Full Installer.</p>

<p>5) Select the jBPM Perspective, right click the myservlet Project > Convert to jBPM Project.</p>

<p>6) Add to the Deployment Assembly the Java Build Path Entries > jBPM Library.</p>

<p>7) In src\main\java\com\mycompany\mywebapp\controller add to (arbitrarily chosen) MemberRegistration.java (which was automatically created as part of the Project) the following which comes from the evaluation sample code:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import org.drools.KnowledgeBase;

import org.drools.logger.KnowledgeRuntimeLoggerFactory;
import org.drools.runtime.StatefulKnowledgeSession;
import org.jbpm.process.workitem.wsht.HornetQHTWorkItemHandler;
</code></pre>

<p>8) In this same module, in register() add the following which also comes from the evaluation sample code:</p>

<pre><code> try {
    // load up the knowledge base
    KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
    kbuilder.add(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource(""Evaluation.bpmn""), ResourceType.BPMN2);
    KnowledgeBase kbase = kbuilder.newKnowledgeBase();
    StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession();
    HornetQHTWorkItemHandler humanTaskHandler = new HornetQHTWorkItemHandler(ksession);
    humanTaskHandler.setIpAddress(""127.0.0.1"");
    humanTaskHandler.setPort(5153);
    ksession.getWorkItemManager().registerWorkItemHandler(""Human Task"", humanTaskHandler);
    KnowledgeRuntimeLogger logger = KnowledgeRuntimeLoggerFactory.newThreadedFileLogger(ksession, ""test"", 1000);
    // start a new process instance
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; params = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
    params.put(""employee"", ""krisv"");
    params.put(""reason"", ""Yearly performance evaluation"");
    ksession.startProcess(""com.sample.evaluation"", params);
    System.out.println(""Process started ..."");
    logger.close();
    } catch (Throwable t) {
    t.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Upon deploying along with the six jBPM WARs we get this error:
...
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: JBAS011470: Persistence unitName was not specified and there are 2 persistence unit definitions in application deployment ""myservlet.war"".  Either change the application to have only one persistence unit definition or specify the unitName for each reference to a persistence unit.</p>

<p>I have confirmed that there is exactly one persistence.xml file anywhere in the deployed myservlet folder (it is in jboss-as-7.1.1.Final\standalone\deployments\myservlet.war\WEB-INF\classes\META-INF).</p>

I'm at the stage where D3 renders fine, but mouse events that I want to affect this layer are caught by (I think) the overlayMouseTarget layer. This means I can't have any interaction with my D3 layer.</p>

<p>I've searched here and elsewhere for fixes, however after implementing several suggestions I found I am still left without a working solution. Are there any supported methods for either overloading mouse interactions or removing/hiding the mouse interaction layer in Google Maps? Or perhaps there is a more elegant solution?</p>

Or figure out how to send events down several layers to where my D3 code currently lives.</p>

<p>Now how can I set how many elements are shown at first and how can I trigger to start loading the next elements with infinite scoll? Please help</p>

<p>I have found a lot like this:</p>

<pre><code> jQuery(window).load(function(){

jQuery('.hfeed').masonry({
    singleMode: true, 
    itemSelector: '.box'
});

jQuery('.hfeed').infinitescroll({
  navSelector  : '.pagination',  // selector for the paged navigation 
  nextSelector : '.pagination .next',  // selector for the NEXT link (to page 2)
  itemSelector : '.box',     // selector for all items you'll retrieve
  loadingImg : '/wp-content/themes/sprppl/images/loader.gif',
  loadingText  : ""Loading..."",
  donetext  : 'No more pages to load.',
  debug: false,
  errorCallback: function() { jQuery('#infscr-loading').animate({opacity: .8},2000).fadeOut('normal');   }
  },
  // call masonry as a callback
  function( newElements ) { jQuery(this).masonry({ appendedContent: jQuery( newElements ) }); }
);      

});
</code></pre>

<p>But when I insert it, nothing happens.. How to start here?</p>

<pre><code>Table: Member

memberID int(11) PK AI
desiresID int(11)
email
firstName
lastName
password

Table: MemberDesire

desireID int(11) PK AI

with ForeignKey constraint between Member and MemberDesire
using Member.desireID and MemberDesire.desireID
</code></pre>

<p>In Eclipse I let those tables be imported automatically and it recognizes the linking perfectly. Those two classes look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    @Entity
    public class Member implements Serializable {
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private int memberID;

private String email;

private String firstName;

private String lastName;

private String password;

//bi-directional many-to-one association to MemberDesire
@ManyToOne(cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
@JoinColumn(name=""desiresID"")
private MemberDesire memberDesire;
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>    @Entity
    @Table(name=""MemberDesires"")
    public class MemberDesire implements Serializable {
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

@Id
private int desireID;

private int maximumAge;

private int minimumAge;

//bi-directional many-to-one association to Member
@OneToMany(mappedBy=""memberDesire"")
private List&lt;Member&gt; members;
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I'm trying to persist a new Member with an included MemberDesire to the database the following error appears:</p>

<pre><code>Internal Exception: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`test`.`member`, CONSTRAINT `desireKey` FOREIGN KEY (`desiresID`) REFERENCES `MemberDesires` (`desireID`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION)
Error Code: 1452
Call: INSERT INTO MEMBER (EMAIL, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, PASSWORD, desiresID) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?,)
    bind =&gt; [5 parameters bound]
</code></pre>

<p>The persisting itself is done in this way:</p>

<pre><code>EntityManager em = Persistence

                .createEntityManagerFactory(""TestProject"")
                .createEntityManager();
        EntityTransaction entityTransaction = em.getTransaction();

        entityTransaction.begin();

        member = new Member();
        member.setFirstName(firstName);
        member.setLastName(lastName);
        member.setEmail(email);
        member.setPassword(password);

        MemberDesire desire = new MemberDesire();
        member.setMemberDesire(desire);

        List&lt;Member&gt; members = new ArrayList&lt;Member&gt;();
        members.add(member);
        desire.setMembers(members);

        em.persist(member);

        entityTransaction.commit();

        em.close();

<p>I have 2 tables that I need to ""merge"" together.</p>

<p>First table contains info about products (product-color-size), and the other tables has info about stock, sold, avilable (quantity) etc on product-season-color-size niveau.</p>

<p>I need my view to return available pr product.
The same product-color-size can be multiple times (It can be on multiple seasons), and therefore I can't just sum on ex available.</p>

<p>My query looks like this</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    SUM((
        SELECT
            SUM(products_details.available)
        FROM
            products_details
        WHERE
            products_details.product_id = products.id
    )) AS available
FROM
    products
</code></pre>

<p>But, this will not work. If one size has 6 in available and another has -5, the query will return 1 available. But, I actually got 6, I can sell.</p>

<p>Therefore I need to do some adjustments</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    SUM((
        SELECT
            SUM(
                IF(
                    products_details.available &gt; 0,
                    products_details.available,
                    0
                )
            )
        FROM
            products_details
        WHERE
            products_details.product_id = products.id
    )) AS available
FROM
    products
</code></pre>

<p>But, this will also not work. If the size has 6 in available on one season, and -5 on another, the query will return 6 available. But, these two rows I need to sum, because it's the same product. Therefore it needs to return 1 available.</p>

<p>So, I came up with</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    SUM(
        IF(
            (
                SELECT
                    SUM(
                        IF(
                            products_details.available &gt; 0,
                            products_details.available,
                            0
                        )
                    )
                FROM
                    products_details
                WHERE
                    products_details.product_id = products.id
            ) &gt; 0,
            (
                SELECT
                    SUM(
                        IF(
                            products_details.available &gt; 0,
                            products_details.available,
                            0
                        )
                    )
                FROM
                    products_details
                WHERE
                    products_details.product_id = products.id
            ),
            0
        )
    ) AS available
FROM
    products
</code></pre>

<p>But, that will be very (!!) slow. Can I somehow use the same subquery multiple times? So I can use it in the If-statement, and if it's positive I can use the same value to use in the sum?</p>

<p>It's pretty complex, but I hope someone can help me</p>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>I just found out, that I can write</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    SUM((
        SELECT
            IF(
                SUM(products_details.available) &gt; 0,
                SUM(products_details.available),
                0
            )
        FROM
            products_details
        WHERE
            products_details.product_id = products.id
    )) AS available
FROM
    products
</code></pre>

<p>That could work okay</p>

<h1>Edit2</h1>

<p>I found a new and much quicker way to write it, and it works just fine :-)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT

            products_details.product_id = products.id
    ))) AS available
FROM
    products
GROUP BY
    products.id

<p>This is very quick - from about 10 sec to just above 1 sec.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;     Sub GetFileNames()
&gt;          
&gt;     Dim r As Integer, F As String, Directory As String
&gt;     Directory = ""G:\My Path\database\""
&gt;     
&gt;     r = 2
&gt;     'Get Directory
&gt;     F = Dir(Directory) ', 7)
&gt;     Do While F &lt;&gt; """"
&gt;     r = r + 1
&gt;     'Cells(r, 1) = F
&gt;     
&gt;         Cells(r, 1).Select
&gt;         ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=Selection, Address:=F, TextToDisplay:=F
&gt;     
&gt;     'Get next File
&gt;     F = Dir()
&gt;     Loop
&gt;     
&gt;     End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Now I need <code>certain data from those files as well.</code> Every file is exactly the same and I need the values from the cells <strong>E12,E13,E15,E16,E18,E19.</strong></p>

<p>I just started last week with VBA in excel so pretty new to the game and got all the other things from tutorials or answers from here. But I just could not find the the answer to this.</p>

<pre><code>function abc() {
  if (some_condition) {
    message('blah');
    return; // early exit
  }
  // otherwise do stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>Coming here to pose this question I found Mehdi's answer in this post is essentially where I'm at
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13687076/jquery-javascript-avoid-running-function-on-condition"">jquery javascript avoid running function on condition</a></p>

<p>However I'd like to modularise the condition so I can use it in a number of places, and the best I've gotten is this (I'm a long time PL/SQL programmer, which may show as I understand this event based world)</p>

<pre><code>function check_condition() {
  if (some_condition) {
    message('blah');
    return false; // early exit
  }
  else
    return true;
}

function abc() {
  if (!check_condition()) {return;}

  // otherwise do stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>In reading articles such as <a href=""https://css-tricks.com/dangers-stopping-event-propagation/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> I realise that there is possibly a grander scheme of not entering the function in the first place, but I wonder if there is a tidier way to propagate the message out of check_condition() to exit early from abc()</p>

<p>I still feel that I'm repeating just as much code with the (!check_condition()) call.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

But sometimes when I run and use the app, my battery runs out faster than usual.</p>

<p>A critical feature that I'm pretty sure that is causing this excessive consume of battery is the timer. Code is below this description, but to make it short, after some seconds, it repeats the <code>HttpClient</code> request to the Web Interface to receive the correct current time of player.</p>

<p><strong>My question is</strong>: Am I right thinking that <code>HttpClient</code> behavior could be generating excessive requests and stacking then even if the App is not running anymore? And, if <code>HttpClient</code> isn't the right or the better object to use and interact with a web server, what would it be? Suggestions of what I should know about requests in C# are welcome (methods, objects, books about theses objects, etc)</p>

Everything was working brilliantly until I got a requirement to scrape a website that uses the data-reactid javascript attribute tag. The problem is that Nokogiri seems to be getting confused with the attribute id format this website is using (several periods, some dollar signs and some other invalid xml/css characters):</p>

<p>An example of what I need to scrape would be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td data-reactid="".3.3.1:$contract_23.$=1$dataRow:0.1""&gt;94.280&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I need the value (94.280) inside of the attribute with an id of "".3.3.1:$contract_23.$=1$dataRow:0.1""</p>

<p>which usually in nokogiri we would select by doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>doc.css(""type[attributename=attributeid]"")
</code></pre>

<p>in my example it would be:</p>

<pre><code>doc.css(""td[data-reactid=.3.3.1:$contract_23.$=1$dataRow:0.1]"")
</code></pre>

<p>but no matter what I do to escape the invalid characters, it keeps telling me there is an invalid character after my equals sign:</p>

<p>Error message for code above:</p>

<pre><code>nokogiri-1.4.3.1/lib/nokogiri/css/parser.rb:78:in `on_error': unexpected '.3' after 'equal'
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a) Getting my string defined as a variable and forced into a string</p>
  
  <p>b) Escaping it with backslashes (.3.[...])</p>
  
  <p>c) Prefixing it with a hash (#.3.3[...])</p>
  
  <p>d) Escaping it using cgi escapedString</p>

<p>ok, i found out why. i had a console.log in the code right before the animation, and because console is only available when the debugger is opened, it would crash right before the animation. thanks again guys.</p>

<p>I really need to make it single process because I use a complex data-structure in-RAM (kd-tree) and if I make it multi-process, I couldn't share it easily between the different processes.

Previously when I made a GIS application, what I need are : </p>

<ol>
<li>XAMPP</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Google Map Api V3 or Leaflet (as the base map) and</li>
<li>some files maps with smaller sizes in the form file * .geoJSON to layer.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could complete application and all running smoothly. <br/></p>

<p>Now, when I'm working on a new project of GIS application, I still use the same composition, but with a more complex map and make the filesize of <code>*.geoJSON</code> become larger (more than 50 MB), consequently it can not be seen on the map layer, I think the problem on the size. <br></p>

<p>Then I tried to change the file format into <code>*.TopoJSON</code>. It make the size can be reduced to approximately 1-10 MB, but unfortunately I can not load maps onto the layer (if I replace using file with size under 100KB, the map can be loaded onto the layer).<br></p>

<p>Maybe, anyone here can give me an advice to answer my question ""<em>what should I do with this issue ?</em>"", maybe I should add the composition or how ?.<br></p>

<p><strong>If anyone can give me some informations/tutorials related to my issue, it would be very helpful.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you</p>

Then I tried to add a button AFTER the for loop without using handler. This time the button was shown on the top of the layout i.e BEFORE the items added in for loop. This does not happen if I add the button using handler.</p>

<p>So, if I use the following code with a handler after the loop then the button is added on the bottom of the layout:</p>

<pre><code> private void fillFeedWithData(final List&lt;ParseObject&gt; feedObjectList) {

    LayoutInflater inflaterOfFeedItem = (LayoutInflater) getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; feedObjectList.size(); i++) {

        final String jokeTitle = feedObjectList.get(i).getString(""content"");

        final View cvFeedItem = inflaterOfFeedItem.inflate(R.layout.feed_item_theme_card, null);

        final TextView tvJoke = (TextView) cvFeedItem.findViewById(R.id.tvFeedJoke);

        Handler h2 = new Handler();
        Runnable update2 = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                tvJoke.setText(jokeTitle);
                llFragmentFeedParent.addView(cvFeedItem);
    // llFragmentFeedParent is acquired in OnCreate() method
            }
        };
        h2.post(update2);
    }


    final Button bNext = new Button(this);
    bNext.setText(""Next &gt;"");
    bNext.setLayoutParams(new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT));

    Handler h3 = new Handler();
    Runnable update3 = new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            llFragmentFeedParent.addView(bNext);
        }
    };
    h3.post(update3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I used the following code after the loop then the button is added on the top of the layout:</p>

<pre><code>    Button bNext = new Button(this);
    bNext.setText(""Next &gt;"");
    bNext.setLayoutParams(new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT));
    llFragmentFeedParent.addView(bNext);
</code></pre>

<p>So now my app is working as intended with the handler but I am concerned as to why this was happening. I think the handlers are mixing up the timings/sequence of execution? If I keep using the logic, is it possible that the button might, in a slow mobile phone, appear on top or even in between the items added in the loop?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CursorIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 requested, <strong>with a size of 0</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Top level declarations:</p>

<pre><code>private DatabaseHelper DBHelper;
private SQLiteDatabase db;

public DBAdapter(Context ctx) 
{
    this.context = ctx;
    DBHelper = new DatabaseHelper(context);
    this.db = this.DBHelper.getWritableDatabase();
}
</code></pre>

<p>My function:</p>

<pre><code>public String getRandomEntry()
    {
    int rand;
    Random random = new Random();
    int numEntries = (int)this.getCount();

    if(numEntries == 0)
        return ""ERROR: Database is empty."";
    rand = random.nextInt(numEntries);

    Cursor cursor = DBHelper.getWritableDatabase().rawQuery(
            ""SELECT * FROM "" + DATABASE_TABLE 
            + "" WHERE "" + COLUMN_A + "" = "" + 0, null);

    Log.i(""numEntries"", Integer.toString(numEntries));
    Log.i(""rand"", Integer.toString(rand));
    Log.i(""cursor"", Integer.toString(cursor.getCount()));

    cursor.moveToFirst();
    return cursor.getString(0);
}

<p>I've also tried grabbing the cursor as such:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(
            ""SELECT * FROM "" + DATABASE_TABLE

<p>Attached are the relevant portions of my code:</p>

<p>(This code is in a view controller)
(back is called when a button is pressed)</p>

<pre><code>- (void)back {

    [timestep invalidate];
    exiting = YES;

    [self release];

}

}

- (void)physicsThreadMethod {

    }

    [pool release];

}

- (void)dealloc {
    if ([self.view superview]) {
        [self.view removeFromSuperview];
    }

    [super dealloc];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The engine (the step: function) runs fine, but when I try to exit the loop by running the method back, it would appear that the thread does not release its retain on my view controller (dealloc is not called). I think my thread didn't exit the physicsThreadMethod method as the NSLog does not appear in the console. Dealloc was only called when I run 'back' a second time.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure why this is happening, so I would really appreciate any help. Thanks!</p>

I still want to go through all the links, however, just in a random and slow manner.</p>

<pre><code>productLink # A list of all the links that I'll be scraping
 x&lt;- length(productLink)  
 randomNum &lt;- sample(1:x, 10)
library(rvest)

for(i in 1:10){
url &lt;- productLink[randomNum[i]]

specs

message&lt;- ""\n                Temporarily unavailable\n            ""

if(specs == message){
  print(""Item unavailable"")
}
else{
  print(""Item available"")
}


}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the next time I run this for-loop I want to exclude all the random numbered indices that have already been tried in the previous running of the loop. That way this for loop runs through 10 new links each time until all the links have been used. There is another aspect to this that I'd like some input on. Since I can raise alarm flags by brute force scraping the particular company's website, is there any way I can slow down this loop so that it only runs every couple of minutes? I'm thinking of a timeout function or such where the code runs the for-loop once, waits a few minutes then runs it again (with new links each time as mentioned above). Any ideas?</p>

The problem is, you can only read 8 bit integers from textures.
I would ideally like to get 32 bit numbers out of the texture.
I had the idea of using the 4 color channels to get 32 bits per pixel, instead of 4 times 8 bits.</p>

<p>My problem is, glsl doesn't have a ""%"" operator or any bitwise operator!</p>

<p>My first thought was for the <code>Get()</code> member function to return another class that figures out the type on its own, probably by comparing <code>typeid(Foo).name()</code> to values in some precomputed list.  That still has to happen before runtime, though, and I couldn't figure out a way to iterate through anything like that at compile-time.</p>

<hr>

<p>The queries in my database are based on levels and each higher level of query is dependent on the previous level. level 1 would be a base level query, and would contain the most general information, lets say this category is electronics. </p>

<p>The level 2 query, would be a slightly more refined query and would be a sub-category of electronics so something like electronics->televisions. <em>Think of it as a breadcrumb.</em> This seems difficult in itself to do, but in this case, the product needs to be able to relate to several different category <em>groups</em> which can contain the same level or different levels. I hope this makes sense.</p>

<hr>

<p>How would I structure my database for this type of relationship? Initially I had the category levels separated under different columns in the lookup table, which worked nicely but there were too many NULL values.</p>

I originally wanted to use boost for ASIO, but then found that ASIO won't work with VC++ 6.0 (which is a requirement).  While incorporating boost, I found use for Multi_Index_Container and Signals.  Aftering finding that ASIO was not compatible, I downgraded boost to version 1.34.1 so that it would support VC6.  Now I'm trying to iron out all of the other compile errors.</p>

<p>At first, I had this code and error:
I am trying to use Boost Multi_Index from build 1.34.1 to set up a
collection of structs.  This Multi Index container will have 2 unique keys
(ID and Name), since I have to be able to search it with either key.  I
made the compiler-specific corrections for VC++ 6.0 SP5:</p>

<pre><code>boost::multi_index::multi_index_container
member_offset&lt;A,int,offsetof(A,x)&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My complete declaration is:</p>

<pre><code>enum RESPONSE_CODES
{
    Pass = 200,
    Fail = 201,
    Hex = 202,
    Decimal = 203,
    String = 204,
    Help = 205,
    None = 255
}

struct PDCUTestMessage
{
    string name;
    char id;
    RESPONSE_CODES responseType;
    int numberOfParameters;
    string errorString;
    vector&lt;char&gt; response;
    string param1Name;
    string param2Name;
    string param3Name;
    string param4Name;
    string param5Name;
    boost::function2&lt;bool, vector&lt;char&gt;, PDCUTestMessage &amp;&gt; process;

    // constructors not listed
};

struct ID();
struct Name();

typedef boost::multi_index::multi_index_container&lt;
    PDCUTestMessage,
    boost::multi_index::ordered_unique&lt;
        boost::multi_index::tag&lt;ID&gt;,
        boost::multi_index::member_offset&lt;PDCUTestMessage, char, offsetof(PDCUTestMessage, id)&gt; &gt;,
    boost::multi_index::ordered_unique&lt;
        boost::multi_index::tag&lt;Name&gt;,
        boost::multi_index::member_offset&lt;PDCUTestMessage, string, offsetof(PDCUTestMessage, name)&gt; &gt;
    &gt;
&gt; PDCUMessageList;
</code></pre>

<p>Later, I attempt to set up indicies for both of these keys, according to
VC++ 6.0 compiler-specific syntax to bypass the Get/Tag issue:</p>

<pre><code>typedef index&lt;PDCUMessageList, ID&gt;::type IDIndex;
typedef index&lt;PDCUMessageList, Name&gt;::type NameIndex;
</code></pre>

<p>using the above code, I got the following error:</p>

<p>error C2039: 'type': is not a member of ""global namespace"" referencing the two typedef lines above.</p>

<p>This issue I fixed by clarifying the namespaces:</p>

<pre><code>typedef boost::multi_index::index&lt;PDCUMessageList, ID&gt;::type IDIndex;
typedef boost::multi_index::index&lt;PDCUMessageList, Name&gt;::type NameIndex;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I've got another error occuring in one of the boost classes: 
lambda_traits.hpp.  I'm not explicitly using lambda_traits, so it must be 
multi_index that is using it.  Here's the error and location:</p>

<p>C2039: 'access_traits': is not a member of 'tuples'</p>

<p>line 106 in lambda_traits:</p>

<pre><code>104  template&lt;int N, class T&gt; struct tuple_element_as_reference {
105    typedef typename

108      &gt;::non_const_type type;

I have the following problem: I have a GUI and with a button I need to launch a c++ program that is on the same machine. This program uses a particular framework called SSM (ROS like) for sharing data. <strong>The program itself works fine when started from terminal</strong> but when I start it with java process builder I cannot access to any data but I can still see the process running.</p>

<p>I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and OpenJDK7. The code that I'm using is the following (<strong>Updated according to the comment</strong>):</p>

<pre><code>ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(command);
builder.redirectOutput(Redirect.INHERIT);
builder.redirectError(Redirect.INHERIT);    
builder.start();
</code></pre>

<p>where command comes from some data that I receive via UDP:</p>

<pre><code>command[0] = Main_gui.getHomePath()+""PFforAEV_autoCalib_20140418/PFforAEV0.2.2"";
command[1] = String.valueOf(initialPosition[0]);
command[2] = String.valueOf(initialPosition[1]);
command[3] = String.valueOf(initialPosition[2]);
command[4] = ""walllandmark_F41_20130125"";
</code></pre>

<p>To be more specific the process <strong>PFforAEV0.2.2</strong> is there, running, but it seems that it does not use any CPU or memory. I can't access the data via the framework. Looks like if it is just hanging.</p>

<p>If you need more detail just ask.</p>

<p>Can someone help me?
Thank you.</p>

If the client changes the object, it can have an IsDirty flag on there so when it gets sent back to the server I know to update it.</p>

<p>But what if I have an Order object? This has the main header informaton, customer, supplier, required date, etc. Then it has OrderItems which is a List&lt; OrderItem>, being the items to be ordered. I want to be able to use this business object on my UI. So I have some textboxes hooked up  to the location, supplier, required date, etc and a grid hooked up to OrderItems. Since OrderItems is a List I can easily add and delete records to it. But how do I track this, especially the deleted items. I don't want the deleted items to be visible in my grid and I shouldn't be able to iterate over them if I used foreach, because they have been deleted. But I still need to track the fact there was a deletion. How do I track the changes. I think I need to use a unit of work? But then the code seems to become quite complex. So then I wonder why not simply use DataTables and get the change tracking for free? But then I read how business objects are the way to go.</p>

<p>I’ve found various examples on simple Person examples, bnut not header-detail examples like Orders.</p>

<p>The MATLAB script has the function <code>vec2mat</code> from the Communications systems toolbox. (See <a href=""http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/comm/ref/vec2mat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/comm/ref/vec2mat.html</a>)  This works by changing a vector into a matrix by specifying the vector you wish to convert and the number of columns you wish to have. <code>mat = vec2mat(vec,matcol)</code>.</p>

<p>I would usually just use <code>numpy.reshape</code>. However, vec2mat adds zeros to the last row if there are not enough values in your vector to completely fill the last row.</p>

<p>The padding I require will vary depending on the csv file I input.</p>

<pre><code>    atbmat = vec2mat(atbvec,nb);

<p>In this example case <code>nb</code> is five and the length of <code>atbvec</code> is 4806. Therefore four zeros are added to the bottom row.</p>

<p>How would I go about adding the extra zeros in python to create a 2D array? I would have the 1D array  <code>atbvec</code> of length 4806 and <code>nb</code> equal to five (I want nb columns).</p>

<p>The way I have it working right now, you tap the current user image, and it brings up a menu asking if you want to upload a different picture from the camera or the library. Choosing camera calls the following (and the library version is basically the same):</p>

<pre><code>- (void) onGetCameraImage
{
    UIImagePickerController* imagePicker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];
    imagePicker.delegate = self;
    imagePicker.allowsEditing = NO;

    imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera;
    [imagePicker presentViewController:[CCDirector sharedDirector] animated:YES completion:NULL];
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try and test this (picking library, of course, since the simulator can't do camera, and yes I do intend to implement the check for no camera), I get the following crash:</p>

<pre><code>2013-04-07 19:21:50.248 prototype1[20897:c07] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'Application tried to present modally an active controller &lt;UIImagePickerController: 0x9e87ac0&gt;.'
</code></pre>

<p>I think it's crashing on the <code>presentViewController</code> call, but I'm having a terrible time trying to find out what I'm doing wrong because all of the tutorials and stackoverflow answers use the deprecated modal function call! I suspect I'm just doing all sorts of crazy BS in my previous code? Either way, I have no idea how to get my code to work.</p>

<p>A lot of this code has been gleaned from stack overflow, so I can't guarantee the sensibility of any of it - I'm very new to iOS coding, was basically thrown into this project and we're just trying to make it work. Please help!</p>

My current theory is that the best way to do this was to find what book series they have ordered. then build a list of all the books in those series and then find all the books in that list that they haven't ordered. However in my attempts to word a messy triple query I get the above error after only getting to the second part. Here's my query so far: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT books.bookid
FROM books, bookseries, series
WHERE books.bookID=bookseries.bookID 
      AND bookseries.bookID=series.seriesID
      series.seriesID IN (SELECT series.seriesID, COUNT(series.seriesID) as cnt
                          FROM customers, orders, orderlines, books, bookseries, series
                          WHERE customers.custID=1
                                AND customers.custID=orders.custID

                                AND bookseries.seriesID=series.seriesID
                          GROUP BY series.seriesID
                          ORDER BY cnt desc LIMIT 1)
</code></pre>

<p>I know for a fact that inside query works; only it returns two columns, seriesID and cnt and I think that might be my problem but I'm not sure. I also saw that a lot of people have had this issue and joins usually work but I don't quite know enough about them. Can someone help/teach me? Perhaps suggest a better way? Speed isn't too important, this is to test some things out on a fun project I'm working on. Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Ok let me know if I'm doing this wrong but: <a href=""http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/6816c/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/6816c/1</a> is what the database looks like. I'm trying to get an output of book titles that are in the same series that I know a customer likes and that they don't own. So for user 1 I know they have harry potter 1, 2, 6, 7. So my query will find that they like the harry potter series and output the titles they don' t own which in this case is Harry Potter 3, 4, 5. Or Azkaban, Goblet of Fire and order of the phoenix. </p>

<p>In summary: Step one: find all the series that customer has books from. Step two: Find all the books from all those series. Step three: find the books in that list that the customer doesn't own. </p>

<p>We are planning on developing this functionality using a combination of PHP scripts and libraries:</p>

<p>GD or ImageMagick PHP extension

<p>My question is whether something like this can be integrated directly into a Shopify website given that we’re developing in PHP, and if so, what's the best way to approach this integration?  </p>

<p>They would like the image upload/cropping functionality to be a separate section of the site and it does not need to be integrated into the ui for viewing products – I’m hoping that this simplifies matters a bit.</p>

<p>If the user, click on ""EMPRESA"", on the page <code>empresa.asp</code> the <code>QUEM SOMOS</code> menu need to be opened.

<p>I am using mutexes to protect some variables in a function which is the entry point of a set of threads. I think the mutex will protect the variables which are in the same scope, but will it protect the function arguments? Especially if the arguments are <i>pointers</i>.</p>

<h1>Example Code</h1>

<p><strong>Edit: Mutex is declared in main, otherwise it doesn't work - silly me.</strong></p>

<p>I have a function like this:</p>

<pre><code>void threadfunction(int index, char* const flag)
{
    //std::mutex m;
    std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(m);

    // Is this thread safe?
    if(*flag) { *flag = 0; index ++; }
}

int main()
{
    std::mutex m;
    std::vector&lt;std::thread&gt; threadvec;
    threadvec.push_back(std::thread(threadfunction)); // Or whatever it is
    ... join ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I guess you can see the problem: Since the arguments are in the same scope of the mutex, I would assume index is protected. However, although I would assume the address stored in 'char* const flag' is thread-safe, I am guessing that '*flag' is not. is this correct, and is there a solution?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>PS: Sorry to anyone who edits the question and has to deal with my horrendous attempt at html.</p>

The core of most of these techniques is setting a perspective and <code>overflow-y</code> on a container element:</p>

<pre><code>.parallax {
    perspective: 1px;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    overflow-y: auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then on the top-most element setting:</p>

<pre><code>.top {
    transform: translateZ(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on the bottom element setting:</p>

<pre><code>.bottom {
    transform: translateZ(-1px) scale(2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where a more negative <code>translateZ</code> indicates slower scrolling and <code>scale</code> is <code>perspective + -1 * translateZ</code>.</p>

<p>This works well, but surprisingly, achieving the following effect proves difficult.  </p>

<p>Given two content blocks, a background and a foreground, of varying widths (it is possible for height of the background > height of the foreground, height of the foreground > height of the background, or even height of the background = height of the foreground), use <code>transform</code> to create a parallax effect where the following holds:</p>

<ol>
<li>The main content (foreground) scrolls normally (as if it was regular content). In other words, page scrolling correlates directly to scrolling the content.</li>
<li>As you scroll, the background content scrolls appropriate (faster, slower, or the same speed as the foreground) such that when the bottom of the foreground content is reached, the background content has scrolled completely to the bottom as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have determined the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>translateZ</code> and <code>scale</code> property are dependent on the ratio of the foreground to background heights and/or the height of the document (because of this javascript is necessary to do these calculations, but I would prefer to not just outsource everything to javascript and attach an onscroll since the browser can likely do it much more efficiently).</li>
<li>For the foreground content to scroll normally, the the background must have a <code>translateZ</code> between <code>0px</code> and <code>1px</code>.</li>
<li>For the background to maintain the correct scale, <code>Abs(translateZ) + scale = 1</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To simplify the problem, I chose to first tackle the case when the background height is twice the foreground height. Logically, <code>translateZ(0.5px) scale(0.5)</code> should work, but it fails to line the background and foreground when the page is scrolled to the bottom.</p>

<p>I've also done some experimenting with trying to figure out a linear function to predict the proper values for these given the document, foreground, and background height, but I couldn't find a function which produced correct numbers for anything but the x=0 case (the one that I manually determined by manipulating the values in Dev Tools).</p>

<p>You can see <a href=""http://jsbin.com/lopumaqulapu/1"" rel=""nofollow"">the results of my trials</a>. Light grey is the foreground. The dark grey is the background. The parallel lines are to ensure that the transform does not distort the scaling of the background. The red outlines mark the top and bottom of each of the content blocks. To satisfy the above, when completely scrolled the red line at the bottom of the background and foreground must be the last pixel visible at the bottom of the viewport (this is not the case now).</p>

<p>I've also consulted the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/#mathematical-description"" rel=""nofollow"">W3C Spec on CSS Transforms</a>, but the mathematical definitions don't lead to an obvious mapping between <code>translateZ</code> and scroll speed.</p>

<p>So given all of this: <strong>is there a function that given the heights of the document, background, foreground, it returns the appropriate <code>translateZ</code> and <code>scale</code> such that the points above hold?</strong></p>

<p>I want the system to at least try twice in case it attempts an operation during changes to the system, so if a process thread fails, The now flagged qBit is queued again, then when processed again, the thread performing that operation will know that another thread has already tried this operation once, and if it fails, ship this particular one off to a remediation queue for outside intervention.</p>

<p>So.... to the actual question, I realize that the state of the queue could change between contains() and a queue operation, like sockets checking is just a form of error control, not a substitution. I did t this way because two producer threads may otherwise toss an error when two of the same id (identified by GUIDs) try and queue what would otherwise be different object instances of a qBit.</p>

<p>The question is, is this a reasonable implementation? I cannot see it ever becoming deadlocked because all the methods would return regardless of the result of processing a qBit, and this allows me to somewhat prevent some of those..</p>

<p>Thoughts and or second set of eyes please? </p>

<p>I was able to build a quick hello world app on Glass. I changed this app that way, that this app connects to my localhost (which is 192.168.42.1. in my case) to the specific Web RTC Page running on a local Webserver.</p>

<p>Here's the buildView method: </p>

<pre><code>private View buildView() {
String url = ""http://192.168.42.1/mobilertc"";
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
intent.setData(Uri.parse(url));
startActivity(intent);
return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This WebRTC enabled html page works if a tablet connects to it.
However, the build in Browser of the Glass does not support the GetUserMediaAPI of WebRTC (that's what the error message says).</p>

<p>My question is now, if somebody knows a working approach to establish a WebRTC connection to a PC. Is ""pure browser based Web RTC"" generally possible on Google Glass?</p>

<p>Ideas that come to my mind are
1) Using Chrome browser on Glass that supports Web RTC -> is a Chrome installation on Glass possible?
2) Using a App for WebRTC like Bistri (but that is not a pure browser based solution)</p>

<p>Some comments / working approaches / ideas / alternative approaches from you would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>The main feature of my application will be users reading the ""top"" stories, which have the most votes (and might eventually have other algorithms going on).</p>

<p>My first thought for the structure of the Azure table is:</p>

<ul>
<li>RowKey = unique id</li>
<li>PartitionKey = ??? (maybe User Id, because you can view a User's list of stories)</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>User Id</li>
<li>Url</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I effectively query against stories considered the ""top"" stories? Most of the traffic is going to be querying the top stories, and doesn't need to pull out ranges of stories otherwise. What I'm wanting is a way to index the top stories, but indexes are not a feature of table storage. I thought about keeping a second table, but that could get hairy if the user updates the story in the other table.</p>

<p>This is my first hangup using Azure Table Storage, the rest of the app is going to work great. I'd hate to upgrade to using full SQL Azure because of this one issue.</p>

<p>PS - I'm open to storing the ""top"" stories in another place besides an Azure table if it makes sense. My server will be running C# web api, but probably makes no difference.</p>

The problem in the end is deciding which classes should dispose the bitmaps. Most of the time the end classes don't know if they can indeed dispose the bitmap as the same bitmap can be used in several places. Also, I can't just copy the bitmaps because this is a kind of resource intensive algorithm and doing it would be dead slow.</p>

<p>I looked up on reflector for Image/Bitmap's implementations and they seem to use the Dispose Pattern. So, even if I don't call Dispose(), the CLR will eventually call it some other time.</p>

<p>Is it too bad if I just let the bitmaps be as they are, and let the finalizer take care of them?</p>

<p>We have been tasked to design a tool that will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read a file (of account IDs), CSV format</li>
<li>Download the account data file from the web for each account (by Id) (REST API)</li>
<li>Pass the file to a converter that will produce a report (financial predictions etc) [~20ms]</li>
<li>If the prediction threshold is within limits, run a parser to analyse the data [400ms]</li>
<li>Generate a report for the analysis above [80ms]</li>
<li>Upload all files generated to the web (REST API)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now all those individual points are relatively easy to do. I'm interested in finding out how best to architect something to handle this and to do it fast &amp; efficiently on our hardware.</p>

<p>We have to process roughly around 2 Million accounts. The square brackets gives an idea of how long each process takes on average. I'd like to use the maximum resources available on the machine - 24 core Xeon processors. It's not a memory intensive process.</p>

<p>Would using TPL and creating each of these as a task be a good idea? Each has to happen sequentially but many can be done at once. Unfortunately the parsers are not multi-threading aware and we don't have the source (it's essentially a black box for us).</p>

<p>My thoughts were something like this - assumes we're using TPL:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load account data (essentially a CSV import or SQL SELECT)</li>
<li>For each Account (Id):
<ul>
<li>Download the data file for each account</li>
<li>ContinueWith using the data file, send to the converter</li>
<li>ContinueWith check threshold, send to parser</li>
<li>ContinueWith Generate Report</li>
<li>ContinueWith Upload outputs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Does that sound feasible or am I not understanding it correctly? Would it be better to break down the steps a different way?</p>

<p>I'm a bit unsure on how to handle issues with the parser throwing exceptions (it's very picky) or when we get failures uploading.</p>

<p>All this is going to be in a scheduled job that will run after-hours as a console application.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The event on frmRun is defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Public Event FiducialMachineSettingsUpdated(ByVal StationData As cLensPLCData)
</code></pre>

<p>If I change this to a Shared event, the error goes away, but I also get similar errors where public functions in frmRun are being called from other forms. Making those shared, generates new errors stating ""Cannot refer to an instance member of a class from within a shared method..."".  </p>

<p>So basically adding the constructor is generating many errors the way the code is written.  Is there a way that I may add the constructor as shared to have the form initialized/created the same as without the constructor to alleviate all the sharing issues?</p>

<p>Now the problem arises when I want to catch some errors:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Invalid address</p></li>
<li><p>Unable to connect to server</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these cases are caught on (MessagingException e). Is there a way to split them in different exceptions. </p>

<p>The thing is that if email address of receiver is invalid, my program should continue with other recipients. But if the program is unable to connect to mail server, then the program should terminate. But in my case it terminates even when email address is invalid. Since (MessagingException e) throws error as shown in the code. </p>

<p>Is there any other exceptions to catch INVALID EMAIL ADDRESS? (AddressException e) is not catching the error with invalid email.</p>

<p>CakePHP writes it's own session id cookie besides the PHPSESSID. This is used to authenticate a request. Then an SWFupload sends a file, and that token to authenticate, and is picked up as a new user agent - so in cakephp you must disable the ""check-user-agent"" security feature. </p>

<p>On many browsers this is enough. IE7 version and SWF version seem to have no corelation to this bug. In our case IE7 was storing/sending two versions of the same cookie. So the first question is why? How?</p>

<p>Further explanation:</p>

<p>Because these duplicate cookies are stored at the beginning and end of the header string, PHP/Cake receives the one end if it's a dupe so it ""chooses"" one, and the manual cookie I set and send in swfobject is the other cookie. I can think of a few hacks to fix this - but really I'd like to know how this condition could arise in the first place.</p>

<p>CakePHP also seems to not generate unique CakeSession ids on logout and login, which might be the cause, and the solution could be to force cake to use PHPSESSID everywhere, or it may be just to make sure that swfupload sends the correct SESSID... </p>

<p>Edit one:
The headers for cookies sent by CakePHP are:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Cookie: CAKEPHP=gqlpa88blmhmdsmv9e99ga16b3; expires=Thu, 13-Aug-2009 13:21:02 GMT; path=/

A customer can have many credit_cards and a credit_card belongs to a customer.  Also, a customer can have many addresses and an addresses belongs to a customer.</p>

<p>In my creditcard table I have a column that indicates if a particular credit card is primary.  The column name is <strong>primary</strong>.  A customer can have many creditcards but only <strong>ONE</strong> can be primary.</p>

<p>I was hoping that this could be done via validations but so far I am coming up empty.  I've done numerous searches but nothing seems to work :(</p>

<p>My creditcard.rb model file is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>class Creditcard &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

  validates :card_type,  presence: true
  validates :card_number,  presence: true
  validates :card_exp,  presence: true

end

<p>When I create a new customer with an address and a credit card I always get an validation error message that states the following:</p>

<p><strong>Primary creditcard can't be blank</strong></p>

<p>I would appreciate any help on this.</p>

<p>As per the request, adding in the code from the controller that saves the data:</p>

else
  flash[:error] = ""Member was not updated, please see errors.""

This service will take parameters that identifies a service to invoke and a payload string it simply passes on to ""the implementation"". The ""gateway"" takes care of authentication of the external client and provides the identity of the user and other ""context"" information to ""the implementation"".</p>

<p>I want external clients that provide an invalid request to get an error indicating as much. But since the ""gateway"" service has no idea what the requests (or responses) should look like, this has to rely on the ""real"" service giving a response that reliably indicates ""bad request"". An error message (human-readable description of what's wrong with the request) also needs to be provided. There are some cases where ""the implementation"" has it's own authorization logic, so similarly it must also be able to indicate ""not authorized"", something I thought HttpException with status 403 could nicely represent.</p>

<p>All implementators will be written in .net as WCF services.</p>

<p>I thought I could get away with specifying the service contract and have the implementations throw HttpException with status code 400 or 403 to provide error information back to the ""gateway"" - that it would not be necessary to specify a fault contract (isn't there some generic SOAP fault, and doesn't this allow at least an error code and a message string??).</p>

<p>Now I've tried to build a POC. The ""normal"" case where the request is valid and the implementation returns normally it works fine. But I can't see any way to obtain the error information when things go wrong.</p>

<p>In a console app to test one service implementation:</p>

<pre><code>private string GetResponse(string req)
{
    try
    {
        using (var proxy = new MapperProxy())
        {
            return proxy.Map(null, req);
        }
    }
    catch (FaultException fe)
    {
        int status = GetStatus(fe);
        switch (status)
        {
            case 400:
                return ""400 BAD REQUEST - "" + fe.Message;

            case 403:
                return ""403 FORBIDDEN - "" + fe.Message;

            default:
                return ""501 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR"";
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        return ""Exception caught: "" + ex.ToString();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Assume the WCF service threw HttpException with status code 400. (The service implementation is configured to ""include exception details in fault"".) How can GetStatus(FaultException ex) be implemented?</p>

The filtering needs to be dynamic so I have broken the setup of the query into four stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find visible clients (basically apply a coarse grained filter)</li>
<li>Filter clients by search criteria</li>
<li>Sort and page the clients</li>
<li>Retrieve additional client data</li>
</ol>

<p>The code goes along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>// Step 1
var visibleClientQuery = from x in xs
                         from y in ys
                         from z in yas
                         where
                             ...
                         select new
                         {
                             id = z.Client.Id,
                             a = z.Client.a,
                             b = z.Client.e.f.g.b
                         };

// Step 2
if (filterByA)
{
    visibleClientQuery = visibleClientQuery.Where(client =&gt; client.a &gt; 10);
}
else
{
    visibleClientQuery = visibleClientQuery.Where(client =&gt; client.b.StartsWith(""ABC""));
}

// Step 3
visibleClientQuery = visibleClientQuery.Distinct();

if (filterByA)
{
    visibleClientQuery = visibleClientQuery.OrderBy(client =&gt; client.a);
}
else
{
    visibleClientQuery = visibleClientQuery.OrderBy(client =&gt; client.b);
}

visibleClientQuery = visibleClientQuery.Skip(50).Take(30);

// Step 4
var fullQuery = from filterClientDetail in filteredClientQuery
                 join client in Clients on filterClientDetail.Id equals client.Id
                 ...;
</code></pre>

<p>LINQ to SQL does a great job of combining these elements together to produce an efficient query. But one thing I want to do is reduce the number of joins created in the first, coarse query. If I'm filtering and sorting by A, there is no need for the first query to populate b using the line:</p>

<pre><code>b = z.Client.e.f.g.b
</code></pre>

<p>Not populating b would save all that extra joining. I tried replacing the line with:</p>

<pre><code>b = filterByA ? string.Empty : z.Client.e.f.g.b
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst this functionally works, when filterByA is true, the excess joins are still present in the query... slowing it down. My workaround is to introduce another interim query that wraps the Step 1 query:</p>

<pre><code>// Step 1
var visibleClientQuery = from x in xs
                         from y in ys
                         from z in yas
                         where
                             ...
                         select z.Client;

// Step 2
var filteredClientQuery = from client in visibleClientQuery
                          select new
                          {
                              id = client.Id,
                              a = client.a,
                              b = string.Empty
                          };
</code></pre>

<p>Then if we need to filter by B, this is replaced with:</p>

<pre><code>filteredClientQuery = from client in visibleClientQuery
                      select new
                      {
                          id = client.Id,
                          a = 0,
                          b = client.e.f.g.b
                      };
</code></pre>

<p>So long as the replacement query returns an anonymous class with the same properties, this works, but seems like an unnecessary, heavyweight hack and doesn't allow easy mixing and matching of filters... what if we need to filter by A and B? The real query has several more possible filters.</p>

<p>Is there any way to programtically change how an individual property is populated within the anonymous class returned from a query... in much the same way that the where clause can be changed?

<pre><code>class Invoice(models.Model)
    number = models.CharField(verbose_name=""Number"", max_length=16)
    issue_date = models.DateTimeField(verbose_name=""Issue date"", default=datetime.now)
    total = models.FloatField(verbose_name=""Total"", blank=True, null=True)
</code></pre>

<p>And then, I have the class InvoiceLine, which represents the line/lines that a invoice can have:</p>

<pre><code>class InvoiceLine(models.Model):
    invoice = models.ForeignKey(Invoice, verbose_name=""Invoice"")
    description = models.CharField(verbose_name=""Description"", max_length=64)
    line_total = models.FloatField(verbose_name=""Line total"")
</code></pre>

<p>InvoiceLine is an inline of the Invoice, and what I want to achieve is that, when in the admin somebody save the invoice with its lines (one ore more) the total of the invoice is calculated. I've tried to do it by overriding the method save:</p>

<pre><code>class Invoice(models.Model)
    number = models.CharField(verbose_name=""Number"", max_length=16)
    issue_date = models.DateTimeField(verbose_name=""Issue date"", default=datetime.now)
    total = models.FloatField(verbose_name=""Total"", blank=True, null=True)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
         invoice_lines = InvoiceLine.objects.filter(invoice=self.id)
         self.total = 0
         for line in invoice_lines:
             self.total=self.total+line.line_total
         super(Invoice, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I add elements in the InvoiceLine, the first time I save and the functionsave  is called, the new elements in the inline (InvoiceLine) aren't stored yet, so when I do <code>InvoiceLine.objects.filter(invoice=self.id)</code> , they are not taken into account. So, the only way this works is saving twice.
I've also tried:</p>

<pre><code>def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(Invoice, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
    invoice_lines = InvoiceLine.objects.filter(invoice=self.pk)
    self.total = 0
    for line in invoice_lines:
        self.total=self.total+line.line_total
    super(Invoice, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>But has the same result. Any idea?
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Now in web.xml, I have a URL mapping of <code>/mobile</code>  pointing to <code>&lt;jsp-file&gt;/mobile/index.jsp&lt;jsp-file&gt;</code>. In my <code>index.jsp</code>, I used relative addressing to reference all the required resources like JS files, CSS files and images; and this works well if I type <code>our_domain/mobile/index.jsp</code> in the browser. But when I type <code>our_domain/mobile</code>, it serves the correct file (index.jsp) but every relative address breaks which means no CSS, no JS, no image.
From my investigation, it seems that <code>web.xml</code> doesn't actually redirect but rather calls a specified JSP/Servlet to answer to a specific URL pattern. This does not work well with relative addressing as path information that would be correct with a real redirect is left at the root. How do I ensure that relative addresses work as expected in this kind of scenario?</p>

<p>[edit]
I've tried sevral configurations. Now <code>/mobile</code> URL works properly and all my CSS gets loaded but <code>/mobile/</code> doesn't load my CSS. Here's my mapping: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;servlet&gt; &lt;description&gt;Landing page on mobile site&lt;/description&gt; 
 &lt;display-name&gt;MobileIndex&lt;/display-name&gt;
 &lt;servlet-name&gt;MobileIndex&lt;/servlet-name&gt;

<p>When one of these people view the Relationship, they see the other person's name. Does it make more sense from a time-standpoint to store just the references? Or does it make more sense to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Relationship
t.string :person_one

<p>Each person is also able to view all the relationships which they're part of. I.e., every person has_many relationships.</p>

<p>It seems that t.references is just a way to abstract adding a person_id column, but it returns the desired Person object, rather than the id. I can definitely see the pros and cons of each. In the former, it seems like it may be easier (code-wise) to get all of a single person's relationships using person.relationships, but it also seems that a lot of behind-the-scenes querying seems to be happening under that implementation, and what I'm interested in is optimizing for time complexity/reducing the number of times I have to go through my SQL databases.

The variable <code>courses</code> is an array saved by Session from the previous page. Here is what <code>courses[]</code> looks like if I var_dump it. I have selected 3 courses to be put into the session.</p>

<pre><code>array(3)

<p>My <code>$selectedYear</code> variable varies between 2012 to 2014. The is also saved by session. Below is where I have the problem. My query is fine, there is no need to check that. I cannot get <code>$courseCode</code> to show up as my <code>Course.CourseCode='$courseCode'</code>, therefore my query doesn't work. </p>

<p>This is what I found to be where it gets kinda confusing. The <code>$courses</code> array returns a normal array. but when I do <code>$courses[0] = $courseCode;</code> then <code>var_dump($courseCode) = null</code> <strong>This is what leads me to believe that data I need as my course ID's are the keys to the <code>$courses[]</code> array. When trying to access the <code>$courses[1]</code>, the code thinks its a multidimensional array with the key as the first data. But I could be wrong</strong>
 Is there better way to extract the key of my array?</p>

When its terminated the record will be deleted from the database so the song won't get played again. And the timer i have made will begin again and will wait 5 minutes to play the next song. This works fine, but the problem is that when there is no record in the database the program crashes, how can i get it to restart the timer again?

<p>My machine is running a dual core.</p>

<p><strong>Expectations</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>I was expecting to see a huge increase in performances between 1 and 2 threads (to make use of the dual core)</li>
<li>I was also expecting to see a slowdown after that for a large number of threads.</li>

<p>Background is that I need to do some SEO on a legacy Smarty based PHP site, with bunch of content pages with <strong>no head section defined</strong>.</p>

<p>I.e., the main <code>index.php</code> page loads a shared <code>index.tpl</code> template which contains the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section along with <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and meta description tags <strong>for all pages</strong>, and then just grabs the content from individual <code>pXXX.html</code>, based on an <code>id</code> parameter in the url. Each ""content"" page has an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag where the relevant title is stored, but the page title remains fixed all the time.</p>

<p>Since there is too many of them to edit each of them individually, I wanted to see if I could get their each by parsing the page on request. I guess I could make a script which would do some batch processing, but I am looking for a quick solution which wouldn't modify these content pages.</p>

<p>I am open to other suggestions, also. To be honest, I never used Smarty before, so I might be missing something here.</p>

<p>I'm reading the <a href=""http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Little Book of Semaphores</a>. There is an implementation of semaphores in C in the book that I don't completely understand. See below for code. There is this <em>wakeups</em> variable. The author explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>wakeups counts the number of pending signals; that is, the number of threads that have been woken but have not yet resumed execution. The reason for wakeups is to make sure that our semaphores have Property 3, described in Section 4.3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Property 3: if there are threads waiting on a semaphore when a thread executes signal, then one of the waiting threads has to be woken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, I think I understand the meaning of the property. One of the waiting threads should get the mutex and not another one (for example the signaling threads.) Correct me if I'm wrong. What I do not understand is how this property is guaranteed with this mechanism. I'd say the property is not guaranteed. It's still possible that a non-waiting process gets the mutex. What am I missing?</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
  int value, wakeups;
  Mutex *mutex;
  Cond *cond;
} Semaphore;

// SEMAPHORE

Semaphore *make_semaphore (int value)
{
  Semaphore *semaphore = check_malloc (sizeof(Semaphore));
  semaphore-&gt;value = value;
  semaphore-&gt;wakeups = 0;
  semaphore-&gt;mutex = make_mutex ();
  semaphore-&gt;cond = make_cond ();
  return semaphore;
}

void sem_wait (Semaphore *semaphore)
{
  mutex_lock (semaphore-&gt;mutex);
  semaphore-&gt;value--;

  if (semaphore-&gt;value &lt; 0) {
    do {
      cond_wait (semaphore-&gt;cond, semaphore-&gt;mutex);
    } while (semaphore-&gt;wakeups &lt; 1);

<pre><code>int ack(int m, int n) {
  if (m == 0) return n+1;
  if (n == 0) return ack(m-1, 1);
  return ack(m-1, ack(m, n-1));

<p>works fine, but when given an obvious optimization (which helps elsewhere) and given the argument (4,2) -- which is of course algorithmically cruel -- ends with <code>Segmentation fault: 11</code> : </p>

<pre><code>int ack(int m, int n) {

<p>If I comment out the 'optimizing' line <code>if (m == 1) return n+2;</code>, the program runs on and on as it does in other languages, but doesn't have the same effect -- at least not after say 5 minutes of operation. [Correction, it seems it does -- after 8m41s] (I should note that I am using gcc that comes with os x, but the same seems to be happening with e.g. the <code>gcc-4.7.2</code> on <code>ideone.com</code>.) </p>

<p>I agree the program doesn't deserve even to be compiled, but wonder why a segmentation fault, which is generally viewed with horror and as a language flaw or compiler fault in other languages I am familiar with, is here the appropriate response for the <code>gcc</code> .  </p>

<p>So I've to use the REQ/REP pattern, but I can't figure out the proper way to initialize the ZeroMQ context in the ASP.NET pipeline.</p>

<p>Moreover, can I share a single connection among the different ASP.NET threads and if so how?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: After some study it looks to me that an <a href=""http://zguide.zeromq.org/page%3aall#Shared-Queue-DEALER-and-ROUTER-sockets"" rel=""nofollow"">inproc router</a> in a dedicated thread should be the way to go, since it would handle sincronization.</p>

<p>But more questions arise:</p>

<ol>
<li>The other end of such an inproc node should be a DEALER? If so, should it connect to the REQ node? Or it should bind to a tcp port and I should code the REP server node to connect to it (the latter would be a bit cumbersome, since I could have different servers exposing the service)?</li>
<li>As an alternative, is it correct to build an inproc node bound to a ROUTER socket at one end, and connecting with REQ on the other? If so, should I code the node so that it handles a manual envelop of each message just to be able to send responses back to the correct requesting thread?</li>
<li>Is Application_Start the correct pipeline point to initialize the thread handling such router?</li>
</ol>

<p>At the moment a ROUTER/DEALER inproc node that connect to the REQ server looks like the best option, but I'm not sure that it's possibile to <strong>connect</strong> from a DEALER socket. But this is still just a speculation and could be entirely wrong.</p>

What is the most proper way to extend icu data library and add a new KZ locale? I read icu documentation a bit and there is described that data library contains multiple <code>res</code> files, which is binary format. So, one possible way is to create res file for KZ, add it to data library and rebuild the icu4j. This process can be very painful and instead of this approach I would prefer to load KZ data from ""outside"". According to this part of the documentation I believe it is possible to do so.</p>

  <p>ICU can load data from individual data files as well as from its
  default library, so building a customized library when adding

<p>When the user submits the form, the server needs to figure out which request parameter belongs to which row. The method I've been using for years is to prefix or suffix each HTML input element's name to indicate the row it belongs to. For example, all input elements would have the suffix ""row1"" so that the server would know that request parameters whose names end with ""row1"" are field values for the first row.</p>

<p>While this works, one caveat of the suffix/prefix approach is that you're adding a constraint that you can't name any other elements with a particular suffix/prefix. So I wonder if there's a better, more elegant approach. I'm using JSP for the presentation layer, by the way.</p>

<p>It works well when I don't use layouts or when my layouts don't use any variable. The problem is my layout uses a variable named <code>$title</code>. When I load the view and the layout without redirect it works well, the title set in the controller is passed to the layout, but after processing a form and redirecting to the same route which uses the same layout and the same controller method I get a <strong>""Undefined variable: title""</strong> error coming from my layout file.</p>

<p><strong>The controller in charge of rendering that view is exactly the same before the redirect than after the redirect, and it has no business logic at all, so why it only works on the first case but not in the second?</strong></p>

<p>My question is how can i load and add the embed dlls to my project using MEF ?
Before i have used this approach which works :</p>

<pre><code>        var catalog = new AggregateCatalog();
        catalog.Catalogs.Add(new DirectoryCatalog(@""R:\DNN\Extensions"", ""*.dll""));

        var container = new CompositionContainer(catalog);

        catch (CompositionException compositionException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(compositionException.ToString());
        }  
</code></pre>

<p>But with this solution is very dificult to mantain ! I can not update the dlls in the Extansions folder when they are in use. </p>

<p>The only way is to restart the DNN cms or charge the updated dlls in a new folder ExtensionsBis. </p>

<p>I have to find a new solution to compose the project with the extarnal dlls. I have try this solution with embeded dlls :  </p>

<pre><code>        var catalog = new AggregateCatalog();
        var resourceNames = GetType().Assembly.GetManifestResourceNames();
        foreach (var resourceName in resourceNames)
        {
            using (var stream = GetType().Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName))
            {
                if (stream == null) continue;
                var ba = new byte[(int)stream.Length];
                stream.Read(ba, 0, (int)stream.Length);
                catalog.Catalogs.Add(new AssemblyCatalog(Assembly.Load(ba)));
            }
        }
        var container = new CompositionContainer(catalog);
        try
        {
            container.ComposeParts(this);
        }
        catch (CompositionException compositionException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(compositionException.ToString());
        }
</code></pre>

<p>The dlls are loaded and added in the catalog, I have no exception at the composition.</p>

<p>But, when I try to execute the exported functions or acces the class at runtime i have an exception ""Object reference not set to an instance of an object"".</p>

<p>The catalog.catalogs.count give the rite number of charged dlls, but the MEF composition seems to fail somewhere.</p>

<p>Is it posible to load MEF dlls plugins that way ?
What is the best practice to use MEF inside a dll ?</p>

It isn't for real use, so I thought this naive implementation is a good start:</p>

<pre><code>data Matrix2d a = M2 a a a a
</code></pre>

<p>I want this to be a <code>Num</code> instance</p>

<pre><code>instance Num a =&gt; Num (Matrix2d a) where
    (M2 a0 b0 c0 d0) + (M2 a1 b1 c1 d1) = M2 (a0+a1) (b0+b1) (c0+c1) (d0+d1)
    -- ....
</code></pre>

<p>This does not seem right. I don't want to type <code>+</code> five times for this obvious definition. Certainly there's room for more abstraction. I'd prefer something like</p>

<pre><code>(+) = fzipWith (+) -- f does not mean anything here
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually easy to implement:</p>

<pre><code>class Zippable z where
    fzipWith :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; z a -&gt; z b -&gt; z c

instance Zippable Matrix2 where
    fzipWith f (M2 x y z w) (M2 a b c d) = M2 (f x a) (f y b) (f z c) (f w d)
</code></pre>

<p>however, I couldn't find anything ready-to-use in hoogle. I find it odd because this kind of abstraction seems quite natural. There's <code>Foldable</code>, there's <code>Functor</code> --- why not <code>Zippable</code>?</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any module that provides this functionality?</li>
<li>If not (I believe this is the case), what options do I have? Is defining my own class the best choice, or is there any better alternative?</li>

<p>The above code works perfectly for one autocompletetextview - showing registration nos of vehicle,when I start typing.</p>

<p>But what I want is , when I select on any vehicle nos , driver name(autocomplete) and driver code(autocomplete) should get set.</p>

<p>So I have written for the above logic , but gets an error here:</p>

<pre><code>editVehicleNo1.addTextChangedListener(new TextWatcher() {

                    @Override
                    public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int 
                    before, int count) {


                    }

                    @Override
                    public void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, 
                            int count,
                            int after) {

"15092673","1","","","2013-02-26 15:16:40","","0","677","<p>I am trying to solve a mathematical problem that is in the form of this function:</p>

<p>f(x) = c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + q<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + q<sub>2</sub>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + q<sub>3</sub>x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Now I have created an interface where the user can input the values of c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, and q<sub>3</sub></p>

<p>Now what we need to solve this function are the values of x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> to be substituted in the equation.
In other parts of the algorithm, the values of x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> usually ends up with something like x<sub>1</sub> = (0 - 0.8&rho;<sub>1</sub>) and x<sub>2</sub> = (0 - 0.6&rho;<sub>1</sub>) </p>

<p>Now assuming the user keyed in the values of c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, and q<sub>3</sub> as 0, 2, -1, 2 and -2 respectively, this will make the function to appear as:</p>

<p>f(x) = 0x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> + -1x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + -2x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></p>

<p>This can be re-written as:</p>

<p>f(x) = 2x<sub>2</sub> - 1x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> - 2x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Now if we substitute x<sub>1</sub> = (0 - 0.8&rho;<sub>1</sub>) and x<sub>2</sub> = (0 - 0.6&rho;<sub>1</sub>) in the equation above we will have:</p>

<p>f(x) = 2(0 - 0.6&rho;<sub>1</sub>) - 1(0 - 0.8&rho;<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + 2(0 - 0.8&rho;<sub>1</sub>)(0 - 0.6&rho;<sub>1</sub>) - 2(0 - 0.6&rho;<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>As you can see if we solve further we will eventually find the value of &rho;<sub>1</sub></p>

<p>So the problem now is how can one write a program to solve this kind of problem and get the value of &rho;<sub>1</sub>
 in Java, or is there such a program already written?
I've tried so many things already but can't come up with a solution.</p>

<p>Any help will be highly appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>Everything works as intended.  I am able to issue commands to my target process (audacity). </p>

<p>My issue is, I basically want to wrap a C# GUI around this code, but am not sure how to modify it so that the communication is done without having to use the console, as commands would be issued via the GUI or from the code.</p>

<p>I have tried turning the streamWriter sw into a class variable, exposing it via property and calling sw.WriteLine() with a method, but that doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>So I am unsure how to encapsulate the stream back and forth nicely within an object.</p>

<p>I found this article which seemed like it was spot on, <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/231903148"" rel=""nofollow"">Using Named Pipes to Connect a GUI to a Console App in Windows</a>, but unfortunately it does not seem to come with any code and is kind of over my head without any to refer to.</p>

<p>So how can I use named pipes without having to use the console to issue the commands ?</p>

That is, they do not inherit from System.Object.</p>

<p>Assuming my logic holds up to this point, are nullable types, such as int?, objects.  Do they inherit from Object?</p>

<p>If so, are they subject to all the same rules and constraints as other objects, or are there special rules governing their behavior?</p>

<p>Just as reference, this question comes from an inquiry into the workings of the null coalesce operator.</p>

<p>After importing, date fields look correct but are displayed surrounded with doublequotes.  Is there a way to tell if they are actually stored internally as date values ? If they're strings, I don't think range lookups will be very efficient.</p>

<p>For example, an entry in a <code>properties</code> jsonb field looks like this:</p>

<p><code>""founded_on"": ""Sep 1, 2012 12:00:00 AM"",</code></p>

<p>I can now search on, say, </p>

<p><code>SELECT CAST(properties-&gt;&gt;'founded_on' AS DATE</code> </p>

<p>and</p>

<p><code>SELECT extract('year' from cast(properties-&gt;&gt;'founded_on' as timestamp))</code></p>

<p>and both work fine, but don't tell me whether Postgres is reparsing a string value in the jsonb field each time, as a date.</p>

<p>I could create an index where I cast these values to dates, and use that to search, but it seems somewhat inelegant.  I'd really prefer to know that the value stored is a date. Integers and floats appear to be their actual native values, not strings, as in these:</p>

<p><code>shares_sold"": 5900000,</code></p>

<p><code>""latitude"": 33.561467,</code></p>

<p>so in first case of models I make the following edit:</p>

<pre><code>int[] selectedIndexes = professorTable.getSelectedRows();
            if (selectedIndexes.length == 1) {
                int selectedIndex = professorTable.convertRowIndexToModel(professorTable.getSelectedRow());

                ProfessorFrame professorFrame = ProfessorFrame.show(professor);
                if (professorFrame.getDialogResult() == DialogResult.OK) {
                    professorTableModel.replaceRow(selectedIndex, professorFrame.getProfessor());
                }
            }   
</code></pre>

<p>and in second case I do almost the same:</p>

<pre><code>int[] selectedIndexes = lessonTable.getSelectedRows();
                    if (selectedIndexes.length == 1) {
                        int selectedIndex = lessonTable.convertRowIndexToModel(lessonTable.getSelectedRow());
                        Lesson lesson = lessonTableModel.getRow(selectedIndex);
                        LessonFrame lessonFrame = LessonFrame.show(lesson);
                        if (lessonFrame.getDialogResult() == DialogResult.OK) {
                            lessonTableModel.replaceRow(selectedIndex, lessonFrame.getLesson());
                        }
                    }

<p>But in first case the table get update correctly, and in second case the update is applied after I click the table.

"3863773","1","","","2010-10-05 12:53:13","","1","230","<p>Here's the scenario:</p>

<p>I have an ASP.NET user control that runs a LINQ query, stores the results in a generic List, then dynamically loads another user control (into a Placeholder) and passes one of the objects from the List to the control through a property on the control.</p>

<p>The child control displays data from the object and allows the user to alter various fields. A Save button on the parent control calls a ""SaveInput"" method on the child control which updates the object's properties from the inputted data (no DataContext has been created at this point).</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't seem to use the DataContext's SubmitChanges method to save the updated object. Here is what I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I call SubmitChanges from the parent control, it doesn't recognise that there are changes to save, even though when you examine the original object (in the parent control's List) it has clearly got new property values. I guess this is because the changes were not made through the parent control's DataContext.</p></li>
<li><p>If I try (in the parent control's code) to Attach the object to the DataContext I get an error that it is already attached (well it is, so fair enough).</p></li>
<li><p>If I create a DataContext (in the child control's code) then try to Attach the object to it, I get an error that it is already attached to another DataContext (again, this is true)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So my clunky solution is to create a DataContext (in the child control's code) then create a new instance of the object's type, then set each property on this new object from the equivalent on the altered object, then SubmitChanges. Not elegant, but it works.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

<li>Set of data where the id does not match but name DOES</li>
</ul>

<p>I am retrieving MORE rows than exist in T1 when adding up the number of results returned from all three queries which I don't think is logically possible, plus this means I must be duplicating rows (if it is logically possible) somewhere which prevents me from executing different commands against each set (since a row would have another command executed on it).</p>

  <p>It returns the number of bytes read (0 &lt;= n &lt;= len(p))[...]</p>

<p>In C the reason to use <code>int</code> was the in-band value <code>-1</code> to signal an error condition (see <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#multiple-returns"" rel=""nofollow"">Effective Go: Multiple return values</a>). Because of multiple return values, special in-band values are not necessary.</p>

"3333810","1","","","2010-07-26 10:00:21","","2","352","<p>I'm currently working out the best structure for a document I'm trying to create. The document is basically a core data document that uses sqlite as its store, but uses the Apple provided NSPersistentDocument+FileWrapperSupport to enable file wrapper support.</p>

<p>The document makes heavy use of media, such as images, videos, audio files, etc. with potentially 1000s of files. So what I'm trying to do is create a structure similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>/myfile.ext/
/myfile.ext/store.sqlite
/myfile.ext/content/
/myfile.ext/content/images/*
/myfile.ext/content/videos/*
/myfile.ext/content/audio/*
</code></pre>

<p>Now, first of all I went down the route of creating a temporary directory and placing all of my media in there. Basically creating the paths and file names '/content/images/image1.jpg' as I wanted them to appear in the saved file wrapper, and then upon save I attempted to copy these all into the filewrapper...</p>

<p>What I found was that the files were indeed copied into the wrapper with the file structure I wanted, but when the actual wrapper was saved, these files all magically disappeared.</p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>So, I trashed my existing solution and tried to use file wrappers instead. This solution involved creating a content wrapper file directory when a new document was created, or loading in a content directory file wrapper upon opening a document.</p>

<p>When an image was added/modified, I created the necessary directory wrappers inside this root content wrapper (i.e. an images directory wrapper if it didn't already exist, or any other intermediary directory wrappers that needed to be created) and then created a regular file wrapper for the media, removing any existing wrapper for that file name if one was there.</p>

<p>Saving the document was just a case of making sure the content file wrapper was added to the document file wrapper, and the document would save.</p>

<p>Well... it did. The first time. However, any attempts to make any subsequent changes i.e add an image, save. Then replace image, save. Did not behave as expected, only showing the image from the first save.</p>

<p>So, my question is... first of all, which of the above approaches is the correct one, if at all, and what am I doing that wrong for them to fail.</p>

<p>And secondly, as I expect to be managing 1000s of images, is using file wrappers the correct way to go about things at all.</p>

The thing is, I'm trying to add text at timed intervals and said interval can be adjusted by the user by hitting one of two buttons at the bottom of the screen. Everything is in place, but no matter what I do, I can only get it to display all of the text at once after the whole duration. Say I'm trying to add text every half second for ten seconds. Running it results in nothing for ten seconds, and then everything shows up. I've tried for/while loops with counters and keeping track via system time. Nope. Recursion blows the stack in no time, which wasn't much of a surprise. Using wait() or Thread.sleep() don't work and wouldn't be ideal anyway as the buttons need to be live at all times. Making a separate thread in a private inner class didn't work as you can't touch Views created in another thread. Trying to create a custom View in separate thread refused to work for reasons I can't figure out just yet.</p>

<p>How in the heck would I do this so each entry is added in real time?</p>

In looking around, it seems that the only way to avoid it, other than restructuring (I did some of that too), is to use property injection. I tried this, and it doesn't seem to help, but I'm not sure why. Here is the path that's causing issues.</p>

<pre><code>Activation path:
  6) Injection of dependency IUserRepository into property UserRepository of type ModelFactory{UserRole}
  5) Injection of dependency IUserRoleFactory into parameter userRoleFactory of constructor of type UserRoleService
  4) Injection of dependency IUserRoleService into property UserRoleService of type InternalUserBehavior
  3) Injection of dependency IInternalUserBehavior into parameter internalUserBehavior of constructor of type UserRepository
  2) Injection of dependency IUserRepository into parameter userRepository of constructor of type HomeController
  1) Request for HomeController
</code></pre>

<p>Now, it seems to know it's using property injection, and all of the behaviors and factories are in the same scope (call scope right now, but I've tried thread scope too), as well as the UserRepository. </p>

<p>My understanding of the process is that it should be getting to 4, and be able to actually create the objects. At this point, it should have a reference to a HomeController, IUserRepository, and IInternalUserBehavior. Then it should work on 5, and insert the completed IUserRoleService into the InternalUserBehavior. Finally, it should insert the the previously instantiated user repository (since it's in the same scope) into the property in the ModelFactory</p>

<p>So I guess the short version of my question is: Why isn't property injection solving my cyclic dependency issue?</p>

<p>Hi, 
Please see the above picture.</p>

<p>I need a link, in the shape of a circle:
- The whole circle should be the active area of the link
- Corners of the square 'behind' the circle should not be active
- Must allow for multiple lines of text in the circle</p>

<p>Note: I can do this fairly easily with table-cell but I need the active area to be only the circle. I dont want the user to be able to hover over the corner of the square behind the circle and click the link.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Any ideas on what to do about this? I've tried these to no avail:</p>

<pre><code>myField.htmlText = myString;
myField.autoSize = TextFieldAutoSize.LEFT;
myField.wordWrap = true;
</code></pre>

<p>Surely more people have had this problem - any ideas? Thanks heaps.</p>

<p>We use Spring and DI so we can't just create the implementation with new.</p>

<p>The subclass will know which bean to provide only after Spring is initialized so using a super constructor won't work. </p>

<p>I also don't want to use q <code>@PostConstruct</code> setup method in the subclass as that requires the subclass developer to know how to set up the superclass. </p>

<p>I want the superclass to demand the subclass to provide the reference to the implementing bean so that it can setup its member:</p>

<hr>

<p>The superclass uses the UrlBuilder Interface:</p>

<pre><code>public class JsonConnection{

    private UrlBuilder urlBuilder;
}
</code></pre>

<p>the subclass provides the implementation (<code>UrlBuilderFacebook</code>) via dependency injection.</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public class FacebookJsonConnection extends JsonConnection {

    @Inject
    private UrlBuilder urlBuilderFacebook;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>the superclass can be abstract or a component, it doesn't matter. What matters is that I want to be able to create lightweight subclasses that provide the <code>UrlBuilder</code> to the superclass and <code>@Inject</code> them where needed.</p>

<pre><code>@Inject
private JsonConnection facebookJsonConnection;
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>@Inject
private JsonConnection redmineJsonConnection;
</code></pre>

<p>Also I don't want the superclass to know anything about which subclass is using it.</p>

<p>So here's my problem. I have tools I've distributed across my internal LAN and my external web servers serve up jobs/data to the internal LAN.  As a result I'm often passing data I'd rather snoopy people didn't see. In other words, it's not the end of the world if someone sees my SQL string but I'd rather they didn't.  I know, it's like a deadbolt on a sliding glass door. It won't keep anyone truly determined out but it should discourage the random curious script kiddie.</p>

<p>So I have a set of simple ciphers I've written in PHP. Recently I've determined that my next extension to my toolset needs to be in Ruby but those new tools need to communicate with my previously built set of PHP tools - I don't want to rebuild all of the PHP tools. So I need my PHP ciphers to be exactly reproduced by my Ruby code so that when Ruby encrypts a string my PHP tools and decipher it, then pass back an encrypted string for my Ruby tools to decipher.</p>

<p>My simple ciphers are just modified Caesar ciphers. A Caesar cipher (for those unfamiliar with the name) is where you shift all characters by a single known number of letters - i.e. a shift of 3 turn A into D, B into E, C into F, etc. A true Caesar cipher would require wrapping so that a shift of 3 would turn a Z into a C.  However, mine doesn't do that, it simply adds 3 to Z and uses the utf8_encode and utf8_decode functions in PHP.</p>

<p>Now I need an equivalent in Ruby. I thought I'd found it in </p>

<pre><code>str.encode('utf-8')
</code></pre>

<p>But that returns this error</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>undefined method 'encode' for #
</blockquote>

<p>My Googling suggests there is no single solution to this in Ruby for some reason. Ruby needs to know the current encoding of the string before encoding it into UTF-8. At least that's the way I understood the issue.</p>

<p>So the string coming in would be whatever Ruby 1.8.7 defaults to. (In case this is useful... I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 desktop, US, English and I think I grabbed Ruby using apt-get with the default repositories.)  I need a variety of strings like SQL query statements - ""SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?"" and strings produced by PHP's md5() output.  Every other string should fall into the category of upper case letters, lower case letters, and numbers all of it in US English.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This generates unobtrusive client side validation perfectly for the two properties Name and Age, but nothing for the properties on the ChildModel.</p>

<p>Any ideas what I'm doing wrong here?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It seems to work ok if I just annotate the ChildModel with the Validator attribute, however I want to apply the validation conditionally, hence the use of SetValidator().</p>

I'm using the PHP and Objective-C 2.0 libraries from <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/oauth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/oauth/</a> . The problem is that when I'm trying to issue a GET request with Objective-C, it doesn't include the OAuth parameters in the request URI, like the PHP library does when issuing an OAuth GET request:</p>

<p><code>http://www.mysite.com/oauth/index.php?oauth_consumer_key=key&amp;oauth_nonce=XXXXXXXX&amp;oauth_signature=XXXXXXXXXXX%3D&amp;oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&amp;oauth_timestamp=1309863754&amp;oauth_version=1.0</code></p>

<p>Instead it puts the OAuth parameters in an Authorization header:</p>

<pre><code>Authorization: OAuth realm="""", oauth_consumer_key=""XXXXX"", oauth_token=""XXXX-XXXX"",
oauth_signature_method=""HMAC-SHA1"", oauth_signature=""XXXXXXXX"", 
oauth_timestamp=""1309863855"", oauth_nonce=""XXXX-XXX-XX-XX-XXXXXXX"", oauth_version=""1.0""

We cannot state when GC will occur(even if we explicitly call System.gc()). But we can explicitly call finalize() on an Object.</p>

<pre><code>Will the function be executed immediately(memory freed) or it waits till GC
occurs like System.gc() call?

<p>Also as per the docs the finalize method is never invoked more than once by a Java virtual machine for any given object.</p>

<p>The issue that I'm experiencing is that even though the client might be dead, the callbacks from the SendAsync method indicate ""SocketError.Success"" and the Socket.Connected property is true, even though the client is no longer ""alive"". So, to the server it looks like the heartbeat data was sent properly and the client is still alive.  </p>

<p>I'm seeing this issue every time, the client side PC is either put to sleep/hibernate or e.g. when the client is running in a VMWare instance and that instance becomes suspended. I do not see this issue when the client shuts down the application, kills it from the taskmanager, etc.</p>

<p>I'm building a website for a client. This website should contains a catalog with an ajax complex filtering system.</p>

<p>Basically there is a main vocabulary (2 levels) calls ""Catalog"" wich contain a main term ""Catalog"" and sub-terms (same level). By creating a node, my client should be able to select only one term here.</p>

<p>There are a few others vocabulary wich are going to filter the products of my Catalog like ""Type"", ""Certification"", …
All those vocabulary are a part of my content type ""Catalog"" and <strong>will be display as filter to the user</strong>.</p>

<p>It should be simple but there is a problem.
Each sub-term must have his own filtering system : depend on the sub-term's page of ""Catalog"" we are there is only a few vocabulary that will be present for filtering the products and of course each vocabulary will not display all of his terms.</p>

According to my web research, this cannot happen in new() because it is only allocating raw memory, and as far as I have gotten, I have not quite been able to figure out how this could be done in the constructor with functions (rather than function pointers).  Also, I assume that because of the existence of the keyword static, without this keyword, it is allocated as part of the parent class.  How and where does this happen?  </p>

<p>Also, if the functions are included in the memory of the class, does the function sizeof() give the size of just the class and its members, or does it also include the related functions? </p>

I'd like to add a window that shows a progress bar displaying the time that the chords play for and how much they have completed. To play the chords, I've been using a slightly modified version of the <a href=""http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdAudio.java.html"" rel=""nofollow"">StdAudio class</a>. So far, I have the following code to be run when I ask a chord to play. </p>

<pre><code>public static void playNotes(double[] frequencies, double duration, double amplitude)
{
    PlayAudioGUI g = new PlayAudioGUI(duration);
    g.run();

    amp = amplitude;
    ArrayList&lt;double[]&gt; chord = new ArrayList&lt;double[]&gt;();
    for(double freq : frequencies) {
        double[] note = StdAudio.tone(freq, duration);
        chord.add(note);
    }

    double[] chordCombined = new double[chord.get(0).length];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; chordCombined.length; i++) {
        for (double[] note : chord) {
            chordCombined[i] += note[i];
        }
        chordCombined[i] /= chord.size();
    }
    StdAudio.play(chordCombined);
}

<p>I've never attempted multithreading before, so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. When I run the code, It shows an empty window while it plays the chord, then afterwards displays the window properly. I'd like for it to display the window at the same time as playing the audio.</p>

If someone edits an empty row in <strong>A</strong>, I make an API call to get <strong>B</strong> then i make a DB call to get all rows where <strong>B</strong> exists.If someone edits an empty row in <strong>B</strong>, i make the same call as the will be retrieved from the DB for that row as well. The call returns 0-N rows. If 0 rows were returned, I change the values of all row except <strong>B</strong> to N/A otherwise i populate the rows using the data.Once populated, i make all columns non-editable. The DB call occurs in its own thread as once the call is return i create my own record object which I add to the tablemodel.</p>

<p>I have my own <code>TableModel</code> and a <code>TableModelListener</code> to keep the data and handle changes in values.</p>

<p>Here is my issue. I am using <code>TableCellRenderer</code> and using the <em>cellrenderer</em> to see if the value was changed, if so then i make the calls and populate as needed. When a large number of rows is being pulled from DB, it takes a while to load and making all that records so I tried to use a <code>ProgressBar</code> to show the user that the screen isn't just frozen, it is progressing and by how much. However the frame that comes up is blank and nothing gets displayed. I get the feeling i am doing something either improperly or missing something.Any help much appreciated.</p>

            MyTableModel.ACCOUNT_INDEX);
    account.setCellRenderer(new MyTableRenderer(
            MyTableModel.ACCOUNT_INDEX));

            int column) {
        Component c = super.getTableCellRendererComponent(table, value,

        if (column == interactiveColumn &amp;&amp; hasFocus) {

<p>Coming from C/C++ I can't help but think about memory management, and it's hard to put it out of my head.  So I'm trying to think of it from a Java perspective and think of everything but primitives as a pass by reference.</p>

<p>Problem, I have a list, containing a bunch of instances of a user defined class.</p>

<p>If I use the for-each syntax, ie.:</p>

<p>for member in my_list:

<p>Is it the equivalent of doing:</p>

while i &lt; len(my_list):
   print(my_list[i])
   i += 1

<p>I think it's NOT, because when I'm looking to do a replace, it doesn't work, that is, this doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>for member in my_list:
   if member == some_other_obj:
      member = some_other_obj

<p>A simple find and replace in a list.  Can that be done in a for-each loop, if so, how?  Else, do I simply have to use the random access syntax (square brackets), or will NEITHER work and I need to remove the entry, and insert a new one, ie.:</p>

<pre><code>i = 0
for member in my_list:
   if member == some_other_obj:

<ul>
<li>We have a Windows 2008 R2 Server (IIS7)</li>
<li>SSL Certification</li>
<li>.NET 4</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried looking for a good resource online, but most of them are incomplete and different enough from each other that they don't really mix and match. I'm looking to use WCF Services to pass messages from my client/server encrypted. I'm going to implement some custom authentication scheme as well. The authentication scheme will verify the user/pass on the first time authentication. Then from then on the client will use a randomly generated code as their authentication instead.</p>

<p>From what I gather I need to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[ServiceContract(ProtectionLevel = ProtectionLevel.EncryptAndSign)]</code></li>
<li>Use WSHttpBinding</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's where I'm a bit overwhelmed. There are so many sources stating how the config files for the server and client should be that I'm just really confused. What are my server/client config files supposed to look like so that my service sends/receives messages encrypted and can point to a custom authentication?</p>

<p><hr>
Alternatively, if I can't use this custom authentication as a parameter of the WCF client object, I'll just pass the authentication credentials as part of the message itself as long as the message is encrypted.</p>

<p>If there is an actual, <b>fully complete</b> (i.e. not partial info) resource out there, that would be great. Or, if anyone knows the necessary client/server App.config/Web.config settings to use that would also be great.</p>

"11274913","1","11491278","","2012-06-30 14:34:44","","8","1240","<p>I want to write a module (framework specific), that would wrap and extend Facebook PHP-sdk (<a href=""https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/</a>). My problem is - how to organize classes, in a nice way.</p>

<p>So getting into details - Facebook PHP-sdk consists of two classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>BaseFacebook - abstract class with all the stuff sdk does</li>
<li>Facebook - extends BaseFacebook, and implements parent abstract persistance-related methods with default session usage</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I have some functionality to add:</p>

<ul>
<li>Facebook class substitution, integrated with framework session class</li>
<li>shorthand methods, that run api calls, I use mostly (through BaseFacebook::api()),</li>
<li>authorization methods, so i don't have to rewrite this logic every time,</li>
<li>configuration, sucked up from framework classes, insted of passed as params</li>
<li>caching, integrated with framework cache module</li>
</ul>

<p>I know something has gone very wrong, because I have too much inheritance that doesn't look very normal. Wrapping everything in one ""complex extension"" class also seems too much. I think I should have few working togheter classes - but i get into problems like: if cache class doesn't really extend and override BaseFacebook::api() method - shorthand and authentication classes won't be able to use the caching. </p>

<p>Maybe some kind of a pattern would be right in here? How would you organize these classes and their dependencies?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 04.07.2012</strong></p>

<p>Bits of code, related to the topic:</p>

<p>This is how the base class of Facebook PHP-sdk:</p>

<pre><code>abstract class BaseFacebook {

    // ... some methods

    public function api(/* polymorphic */) 
    {
        // ... method, that makes api calls
    }

    public function getUser()
    {
        // ... tries to get user id from session
    }

    // ... other methods

    abstract protected function setPersistentData($key, $value);

    abstract protected function getPersistentData($key, $default = false);

    // ... few more abstract methods

}
</code></pre>

<p>Normaly Facebook class extends it, and impelements those abstract methods. I replaced it with my substitude - Facebook_Session class:</p>

<pre><code>class Facebook_Session extends BaseFacebook {

    protected function setPersistentData($key, $value)
    {
        // ... method body
    }

    protected function getPersistentData($key, $default = false)
    {
        // ... method body
    }

    // ... implementation of other abstract functions from BaseFacebook
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, then I extend this more with shorthand methods and configuration variables:</p>

<pre><code>class Facebook_Custom extends Facebook_Session {

    public function __construct()
    {
        // ... call parent's constructor with parameters from framework config
    }

    public function api_batch()
    {
        // ... a wrapper for parent's api() method
        return $this-&gt;api('/?batch=' . json_encode($calls), 'POST');
    }

    public function redirect_to_auth_dialog()
    {
        // method body
    }

    // ... more methods like this, for common queries / authorization

}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure, if this isn't too much for a single class ( authorization / shorthand methods / configuration). Then there comes another extending layer - cache:</p>

<pre><code>class Facebook_Cache extends Facebook_Custom {

    public function api()
    {
        $cache_file_identifier = $this-&gt;getUser();

        if(/* cache_file_identifier is not null
              and found a valid file with cached query result */)
        {
            // return the result
        }
        else
        {
            try {
                // call Facebook_Custom::api, cache and return the result
            } catch(FacebookApiException $e) {
                // if Access Token is expired force refreshing it
                parent::redirect_to_auth_dialog();
            }
        }

    }

    // .. some other stuff related to caching

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now this pretty much works. New instance of Facebook_Cache gives me all the functionality. Shorthand methods from Facebook_Custom use caching, because Facebook_Cache overwrited api() method. But here is what is bothering me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I think it's too much inheritance. </li>
<li>It's all very tight coupled - like look how i had to specify 'Facebook_Custom::api' instead of 'parent:api', to avoid api() method loop on Facebook_Cache class extending.</li>
<li>Overall mess and ugliness.</li>
</ul>

<p>So again, this works but I'm just asking about patterns / ways of doing this in a cleaner and smarter way.</p>

Artist: &lt;input type=""text"" name=""artist"" /&gt;
&lt;input type=""submit""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which as you can see calls <code>formhtml.php</code>, which is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
global $wpdb;

$wpdb-&gt;insert( $table_name, array( 'album' =&gt; $_POST['album'], 'artist' =&gt; $_POST['artist'] ), array( '$s', '$s' ) );
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I submit the form, I get an <code>Error 500.0</code> when running the plugin in Worpdress on <code>IIS7.0</code>, and a <code>""Page Not Found""</code> when running on another web server which runs <code>apache</code>.</p>

<p>If I change <code>formhtml.php</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

echo $_POST['album'];
echo $_POST['artist'];

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Works fine - I get the album and artist that I put in the form. Obviously something I'm doing wrong when inserting the data (in a new row) into the database.</p>

<p>Any thoughts as to what that might be?</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>Ok, so if I update <code>formhtml.php</code> with this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
require_once('../../../wp-config.php');
$table_name = $wpdb-&gt;prefix . ""imlisteningto"";
$wpdb-&gt;insert( $table_name, array( 'album' =&gt; $_POST['album'], 'artist' =&gt; $_POST['artist'] ), array( '$s', '$s' ) );
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I no longer get an error message, but data still doesn't get put into the database.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>This worked for me:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
require_once('../../../wp-config.php');
global $wpdb;
$table_name = $wpdb-&gt;prefix . ""imlisteningto"";
$wpdb-&gt;insert( $table_name, array( 'album' =&gt; $_POST['album'], 'artist' =&gt; $_POST['artist'] ) );
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>as did this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
require_once('../../../wp-load.php');
global $wpdb;
$table_name = $wpdb-&gt;prefix . ""imlisteningto"";
$wpdb-&gt;insert( $table_name, array( 'album' =&gt; $_POST['album'], 'artist' =&gt; $_POST['artist'] ) );
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, for some reason <code>$wpdb</code> was not working unless I required either <code>wp-config</code> or <code>wp-load.php</code>. If include <code>wp-load.php</code>, <code>$wpdb</code> gets values and all is well.</p>

In the Generics chapter, they suggest an input that is purposely wrong, in order to have a look at what the compiler says. My problem is: not only the compiler doesn't give me the same error, but it will keep on giving me errors also when I correct the input as stated in the book. Here's the deal:</p>

<pre><code>public class PairTest1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double middle = ArrayAlg.getMiddle(3.14, 1729, 0);
    }
}

class ArrayAlg {
    public static &lt;T&gt; T getMiddle(T[] a) {
        return a[a.length / 2];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The book says I should get the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>found: java.lang.Number&amp;java.lang.Comparable>, required: double.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, Eclipse won't let me run the program, saying </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method getMiddle(T[]) in the type ArrayAlg is not applicable for
  the arguments (double, int, int)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book then says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the remedy is to write all parameters as double values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I therefore changed 1729 to 1729.1 and 0 to 0.1. Now Eclipse says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method getMiddle(T[]) in the type ArrayAlg is not applicable for
  the arguments (double, double, double)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mmmhh... I didn't get what is going on. Suggestions?</p>

<p>Thank you &amp; regards</p>

<p>EDIT: I tried to create the array <code>double[] doubles = { 3.14, 1729.1, 0.1 };</code> and to give it as parameter, but now I get the error <code>The method getMiddle(T[]) in the type ArrayAlg is not applicable for the arguments (double[])</code></p>

My goal is to render a texture on a ""sheared rectangle"" that is to say a parallelepiped.
But with the code below, the vertical lines are pixellised.
I tried with no success to change the glShadeModel, the glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR); with GL_LINEAR, GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR, etc.
In the ""InitializeGL"" sequence, I tried adding ""glEnable(GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH);"" but I guess it's for polygons and not textures. I found articles about using mip-mapping, or ""close-up"" filters, but did not understood how to code it in OpenGL.
What is the best way to render a texture on a parallelepiped without aliasing ?
Here below, you can see the ""yTanAngle"" that I had to obtain a shearing effect :</p>

<pre><code>glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureId);
glBegin(GL_QUADS);
glColor4ub(255,255,255,incrustInfo-&gt;atexte);
glTexCoord2d(0.0, 0.0); glVertex2d(x0, y0);
glTexCoord2d(1.0, 0.0); glVertex2d(x1, y0);
glTexCoord2d(1.0,1.0);  glVertex2d(x1 + yTanAngle, y1);
glTexCoord2d(0.0,1.0);  glVertex2d(x0 + yTanAngle, y1);
glEnd();
glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried to apply a shearing matrix :</p>

<pre><code>//--- Shearing
GLdouble shearing[16] = {1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0, tan(angle*M_PI/180.0),1.0,0.0,0.0, 0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, 0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0};
glMultMatrixd(shearing);
</code></pre>

<p>But I still have a pixellised image. And another problem is that I want to apply this shearing only to this gl_quad, and not to the global matrix (all elements get sheared).</p>

<p>As asked by Nils Pipenbrinck, here is a screenshot (but it's done from a Windows screenshot saved to .BMP and loaded to freeimagehosting which provides a .PNG link ... however we can see the pixelisation of the flag):

Our Sonar now complains about a high cyclomatic complexity (of about the number of case statements, naturally) of this method.</p>

<p>I know, large switch case statements are not really best style in OOP, but sometimes it is quite opportune to use them (in my case a parser evaluating operator tokens) instead of building a complex object tree.</p>

<p>My concern now how to deal with that? Is there any design pattern to split such a switch case meaningfully? Or can I (and should I) exclude the class from measuring CC (as there may be other methods in it where a high CC can easily be avoided)?</p>

I created a multi step form, and yes the javascript and all is already functional but i have this one problem. also the user has 2 options of navigating trough the form, either using the next button or directly clicking the steps at the header. let's say the user has a form with 3 groups, ergo he has 3 steps. In my code  he can't move to step 2 when he is currently in step 1 and required fields are empty, same applies with the next button. now the problem is that if he is in step 1 and he clicks step 3 he is able to proceed to it even though there are required fields that are empty in between them. I am already at lost on how do I trap this bug.</p>

<p><b>The Format of the groups</b><br/>
The groups are divided by table ergo 1 group is under 1 table.</p>

<p><b>How I formatted my JS</b><br/>
I formatted my JS by passing 3 values to it. the first value is the current category name, the second is the category list, the third is the next category after the current.</p>

<p>The first value is used to check whether all the required fields are filled before moving to the next step, the array is there to hide all other categories except the third value ""this is done when the user clicks the next step"", while the third value is used for displaying the next step.</p>

<p>First I identified that <code>StateT A M</code> appears often in other contexts and thus I decided it would be best to wrap that alone in a monad <code>M1</code> and then wrap <code>ExceptT a M1</code> into <code>M2</code>.</p>

<p>The desired property is to make <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> instances of <code>MonadState</code> and the class of <code>M</code> (lets assume it is called <code>MyMonadClass</code>). Also <code>M2</code> should be an instance of <code>MonadError</code>.</p>

<p>First I started by simple type synonyms:</p>

<pre><code>type MyState    = StateT A M
type MyBranch a = ExceptT a MyState
</code></pre>

<p>then I thought that I would first sketch the instance declarations (without implementing the instance) and thats where I first got stuck. <code>instance MonadState A (MyState)</code> seemed to not be the right syntax. I thought I would have to create <code>newtype MyState' a = StateT a M</code> and then <code>type MyState = MyState A</code> (Lets not use language extensions where not necessary).</p>

<p>However once I started converting the synonyms into <code>newtype</code> declarations I started to lose the connection to the <code>StateT A M</code> and <code>ExceptT ...</code> types.</p>

<pre><code>newtype MyState' s a = MyState' { runMyState :: s -&gt; (s, a) }
type MyState = MyState' A
newtype MyBranch e a = MyBranch { runMyBranch :: MyState (Either e a) }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the transformers that are already implemented disappeared and I think I am trying to do something that does not make much sense. So my question is: How would one correctly wrap this kind of behaviour into new compound monads that make accessible the layers underneath so that one avoids unnecessary lifting and keeps things clear and well-organized.</p>

However, I'm confused as how to place the data into the angular array to display, as examples show from angular-ui that this is the way to go. Below is a service defined for a rails api call</p>

<pre><code>  app.factory('ProviderMedicalService', ['$resource', function($resource) {
     function ProviderMedicalService() {
       this.service = $resource('/api/provider_medical_services/:providerMedicalServiceId',      {providerMedicalServiceId: '@id'});
     };
     ProviderMedicalService.prototype.all = function() {
       return this.service.query();
     };
   return new ProviderMedicalService;
 }]);
</code></pre>

<p>this snippet of code was taken from a tutorial that integrates rails with  angular. the <code>$resource</code> is the json data that is made from a custom rails api call. I'm assuming the <code>return new ProviderMedicalServices</code> returns the json data</p>

<pre><code>(function() {
 app.controller('ModalDemoCtrl', ['$scope', 'ProviderMedicalService', '$resource', '$modal', function($scope, ProviderMedicalService, $resource, $modal) {
$scope.provider_medical_services = ProviderMedicalService.all();
</code></pre>

<p>In the controller that wraps the table, the tutorial states that the <code>$scope.provider_medical_services</code> helps us extend the api later down the road.</p>

<p>currently my json data is displaying properly, except that it is not being formatted into the table format because of my setup.The following code is just what i'm trying to attempt, and i understand that the data should be inside the controller passed to the array</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""gridStyle"" ng-grid=""gridOptions""&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li ng-repeat=""service in provider_medical_services""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;{{service.name}}  {{service.cash_price | currency}} {{service.average_price |   currency}}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>basically, my question is how do i pass from the factory into the array like this example?</p>

<pre><code>  $scope.myData = [{name: ""Moroni"", age: 50},
                 {name: ""Tiancum"", age: 43},
                 {name: ""Jacob"", age: 27},
                 {name: ""Nephi"", age: 29},
                 {name: ""Enos"", age: 34}];
$scope.gridOptions = { data: 'myData' };
})

<p>When trying to unit test my models with phpUnit how can I stub the database?</p>

<p>I'm using a PHP framework CMS which has a number of classes which inherit from a class (""Model"") which inherits from ADODB_Active_Record. Model's constructor grabs a db object (from ADOConnection) and passes it to Active_Record's constructor.</p>

<p>It might not be Best Practice, but in order to change the code as little as possible, I'm thinking of tweaking grabDBObject()  to return a stub object when in testing. That stub gets passed to ADODB_Active_Record, and, in theory, I can test my models.</p>

<p>However, I can't figure out how to create the stub. ADODB_Connection isn't simple. It's not going to be a matter of replacing Execute(). There are a bunch of other functions, like qstr(), that it appears I'll have to worry about and rewrite as necessary.</p>

<p>What's surprising is I can't find any discussions of people doing this. This has got to be a common problem. Am I going in the wrong direction? I understand that I can use something like dbUnit to actually do db queries rather than stubbing ADODB_connection, but I also understand that I should stub as much as possible, and that it's bad to rely on a db for unit tests of a model's methods.</p>

<p>So,
1. Should I be stubbing the db connection for unit testing?
2. How?</p>

<p>When <code>test2</code> is <code>public method</code> I can call it on <code>self</code> (fair enough, a method sent to self object). But when <code>test2</code> is <code>private method</code> I cannot call it on self. So where is the object that I am sending method on?</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10597849/drop-down-menu-for-tbutton"">Drop down menu for TButton</a></p>

<p>I have wrote a generic code for DropDown memu with <strong>any</strong> <code>TControl</code>, but for some reason it dose not work as expected with <code>TPanel</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var
  TickCountMenuClosed: Cardinal = 0;
  LastPopupControl: TControl;

type
  TDropDownMenuHandler = class
  public
    class procedure MouseDown(Sender: TObject; Button: TMouseButton;
      Shift: TShiftState; X, Y: Integer);
  end;                            
  TControlAccess = class(TControl);

class procedure TDropDownMenuHandler.MouseDown(Sender: TObject; Button: TMouseButton;
  Shift: TShiftState; X, Y: Integer);
begin
  if LastPopupControl &lt;&gt; Sender then Exit;
  if (Button = mbLeft) and not ((TickCountMenuClosed + 100) &lt; GetTickCount) then
  begin
    if GetCapture &lt;&gt; 0 then SendMessage(GetCapture, WM_CANCELMODE, 0, 0);
    ReleaseCapture;
    // SetCapture(0);
    if Sender is TGraphicControl then Abort;
  end;
end;

procedure RegisterControlDropMenu(Control: TControl; PopupMenu: TPopupMenu);
begin
  TControlAccess(Control).OnMouseDown := TDropDownMenuHandler.MouseDown;
end;

procedure DropMenuDown(Control: TControl; PopupMenu: TPopupMenu);
var
  APoint: TPoint;
begin
  LastPopupControl := Control;
  RegisterControlDropMenu(Control, PopupMenu);
  APoint := Control.ClientToScreen(Point(0, Control.ClientHeight));
  PopupMenu.PopupComponent := Control;
  PopupMenu.Popup(APoint.X, APoint.Y);
  TickCountMenuClosed := GetTickCount;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This works well with <code>TButton</code> and with <code>TSpeedButton</code> and with any <code>TGraphicControl</code> (like <code>TImage</code> or <code>TSpeedButton</code> etc) as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>BUT does not work as expected with <code>TPanel</code> </p>

<pre><code>procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  DropMenuDown(Sender as TControl, PopupMenu1);
end;

procedure TForm1.Panel1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  DropMenuDown(Sender as TControl, PopupMenu1); // Does not work!
end;

procedure TForm1.SpeedButton1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  DropMenuDown(Sender as TControl, PopupMenu1);
end;

procedure TForm1.Image1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  DropMenuDown(Sender as TControl, PopupMenu1);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like <code>TPanel</code> is not respecting <code>ReleaseCapture;</code> and not even <code>Abort</code> in the event <code>TDropDownMenuHandler.MouseDown</code>. What can I do to make this work with <code>TPanel</code> and other controls? What am I missing?</p>

<p>I'm building a db that is supposed to allow supervisors to see the information on the people they are in charge of and I want to restrict the access so they can only see the info regarding the people that has their name as Supervisor. Here is the example followed by the code:</p>

<p><strong>name1</strong>: John Paul
  -  <strong>age</strong>: 34
  -  <strong>Department</strong>: IT
  -  <strong>Supervisor</strong>: Peter M.</p>

<p><strong>name2</strong>: Steve Dan

  -  <strong>Department</strong>: Sells
  -  <strong>Supervisor</strong>: Mike P.</p>

<p>I want Mike P. to be able to check just the name(s) that have the Field <strong>Supervisor</strong> as Mike P.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far on the firebase rules:</p>

<pre><code>{
""rules"": {
  ""people"":{
    ""$supervisor"":{
    "".read"":""data.child($supervisor).child('Supervisor').val() === auth.super_name""
}}}}
</code></pre>

<p>But it does not work :'(
It only works if I use an exact name (Ex: Steve Dan) and eliminate the variable $supervisor. </p>

<p>I will appreciate any help, tips, tricks, any thing.</p>

<p>If I remove all the code related to Bitmap then the program can take a picture without any error. How can I save both frame images and the better image produced with Camera.takePicture?
I tried to save photo from camera when a button is touched and start another activity to edit the photo. </p>

For example, the byte code generation facility of Javassist is really easy to use since it is as simple as generating your program in a string and compile it on the fly. 
However, sometimes the visitor approach of ASM seems more convenient for other kind of tasks (e.g., such as translating a Java routine to another language).</p>

<p>Is it possible to use both libraries in the same Java project so I could  profit from the most convenient library according to the requirements of each different scenario ?.

Price for 1 - 2 days in Season 2 - 20$ per day.
Price for 1 - 2 days in Season 3 - 30$ per day.

Price for 1 - 2 days in Season 2 - 5$ per day.
Price for 1 - 2 days in Season 3 - 10$ per day.

</code></pre>

<p>And the season dates are - </p>

<pre><code>Season 1: 1 January to 10 June and 21 September to 31 December
Season 2: 11 June to 30 June and 1 September to 20 September
Season 3: 1 July to 31 August
</code></pre>

<p>So let's do a test calculation.
If I choose a date from 1st July to 25 September the calculation will be for bike 3 as following -</p>

<p>62*5 + 20*2 + 5*1 = 310 + 40 + 5 = 355$</p>

<p>And this sum should automatically add in text field ""Price"". If I change the dates, the price should automatically change too. Is there any easy way to create something like that? If you have any questions - ask, I will be happy to answer to them, so you can help me solve this question more easily.</p>

<p>Since the app doesn't require top security and the 4 digit pin would work I wasn't sure how to implement this on the controller side as I would like to have each parts to the pin in their own input field.</p>

<p>The fields I have are..</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= u.password_field 'pin[]' %&gt;
&lt;%= u.password_field 'pin[]' %&gt;
&lt;%= u.password_field 'pin[]' %&gt;
&lt;%= u.password_field 'pin[]' %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'll run some client side validation to make sure all fields are input, and perhaps some Model validation if I sent an <code>attr_accessor</code> on the model for the 4 parts to the pin? - Would that work?</p>

<p>Basically from the inputs above I just want access to a <code>pin</code> variable but all previous attempts have lead me to receiving a <code>no implicit conversion of Symbol into Integer</code> error.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone new can shine a light on my troubles!</p>

If H1 contains {h11,h12,h13...h1n} hypothesis and H2 contains {h21,h22,h23...h2n} hypothesis, the union of H1 and H2 contains {h11,h12,h13...h1n,h21,h22,h23...h2n} hypothesis.

It does not seem to be a diff between H1, H2 and H1UH2...Need help to understand the meaning of union of hypothesis sets...Thanks</p>

<p>Background: I have client applications (in .NET) using XMS.NET API to read messages from WebSphere MQ. I use the ClientAcknowledge mode. If the client reads the message and does not ack it, WebSphere MQ waits for 300 seconds before timing out and makes (backout) the message available in the original queue for other clients to read the message.</p>

<p>Task: I want to lower the timeout from 300 seconds. </p>

<p>Our MQ Admin suggested to change the HearBeatInterval property on the channel. But changing it is making no difference. </p>

<p>Apparently, somehow setting the Channel's HeartBeatInterval property on client side (along with the server side channel setting) will make it work. I am attempting to set this value in the client application. But the <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.msc.doc/prop_defns.html%23prop_defns"" rel=""nofollow"">XMS API</a> does not have a property that corresponds to <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.dev.doc/q108450_.htm?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">MQCD.HeartBeatInterval</a> property</p>

<p>Any insight in accomplishing this task of lowering the message ack timeout? or even setting the HeartBeatInterval on the client side - if that's the way to do it.</p>

<p>The correct keycode is being captured, however I appear to be unable to get the correct value of the 30th bit when using the bitmask taken from the answer to this StackOverflow question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6176566/get-30th-bit-of-the-lparam-param-in-wm-keydown-message"">Get 30th bit of the lParam param in WM_KEYDOWN message</a></p>

<pre><code>    int vkCode = Marshal.ReadInt32(lParam);
    int lastKeyState = (vkCode &amp; LAST_KEY_STATE_BITMASK);

<li><p>Apply a value to a <code>sold_at_same_place</code> column base on the value in <code>place</code>:</p>

<pre><code>df['sold_at_same_place'] = \
    df.apply( lambda row: row[str(row['place'])], axis = 1)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Remove the temporary column values ('1' and '0'):</p>

<pre><code>fields_to_drop = [str(field) for field in df['place'].unique()]

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main ()
{
    char c;
    while (1) {
        c = getchar();
        printf(""%x\n"", c);
    }
   return(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I execute this command, it just iterates indefinitely this way:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo -n ""A"" | ./binary
41
ffffffff
ffffffff
ffffffff
ffffffff
...
</code></pre>

<p>From what I know and what I read (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22444932/confusion-about-how-a-getchar-loop-works-internally"">Confusion about how a getchar() loop works internally</a>), I thought <code>echo -n ""A""</code> would send a <code>A</code> to <strong>stdin</strong> and then trigger an EOF <em>event</em> (I'm not sure what EOF really is) <strong>once</strong>, thus my loop would iterate twice at most, and then would sleep waiting for a new input in <strong>stdin</strong>.</p>

<p>But no, it iterates over EOF, and I don't understand why.</p>

<p>I ran this command to try to understand :</p>

<pre><code>$ echo -n ""A"" | strace ./binary
read(0, ""A"", 4096)                      = 1
fstat(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 4), ...}) = 0
mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7ffff7ff6000
write(1, ""41\n"", 341
)                     = 3
read(0, """", 4096)                       = 0
write(1, ""ffffffff\n"", 9ffffffff
)               = 9
read(0, """", 4096)                       = 0
write(1, ""ffffffff\n"", 9ffffffff
)               = 9
...
</code></pre>

<p>So it appears read() is reading nothing, and returns 0, which is interpreted by getchar() as EOF. But why, oh why does it iterate like this, whereas when I execute this binary the normal way, it works as expected :</p>

<pre><code>$ ./binary
A
41
a
B
42
a
^C
$
</code></pre>

<p>(Above output could be a bit confusing, but when I entered <kbd>A</kbd> then <kbd>Return</kbd>, I sent <code>A</code> then <code>\n</code> (0x0a) to stdin, so the binary just displays these in their hexa representations ,<code>41</code> and <code>a</code>)</p>

<p>Could someone explain this to me ? What did I miss ?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for reading !</p>

<p>Stock ID   |  Product  |   Regular Price   |    Sale Price</p>

<p>The issue I am facing is that when I click on the values in the rows and append them to another table, or shopping cart, my for loop appends the whole line.
What I am looking for is to append only the Product, Sale Price, and then my calculated ""amount saved"" price. How do I append the index eq(1) [Product] and eq(3) [Sale Price] instead? From what I understand I should use another .find method but not sure how to do this exactly. (still getting the whole .find and child nodes down)</p>

<p>Code snippet: <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/ko828bcs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jsfiddle.net/ko828bcs/</a></p>

<p>Ps: I have jquery not javascript so it doesn't run in jsfiddle(I just wanted you to be able to see the formatting)</p>

<pre><code>//add the selected item in table
var variable = ""&lt;tr class='s-list' id='s-""+id +""'&gt;"";
for (var i=0; i&lt;child_nodes.length; i++){
        // add a table cell for each node using its content
        variable += ""&lt;td&gt;"" +child_nodes.eq(i).text() + ""&lt;/td&gt;"";
} // end for
    variable += ""&lt;/tr&gt;"";
    // add msg to the selected courses list
    $('#selected-list').append(variable);

<p>Changed the code as suggested by J... also added critical sections but the problem i am facing now is that when i am trying call multiple task only one thread is being used, Lets say if i added 5 threads in the pool then only one thread is being used which is thread 1. Please check my client code as well in the below section.</p>

However when dealing with forms and inputs, if I give my input an ng-model, instead of being added to the scope of the form, its added to the same scope on which the form resides.  Is there any way to change this behavior?  Here's an example of what I mean</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eQQHj.png"" alt=""AngularJS Model View""></p>

<p>And here's the code that created it</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""login-form"" name=""loginForm""&gt;
            &lt;label for=""login-username"" class=""hidden""&gt;Username &lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input id=""login-username"" ng-minlength=""5"" type=""{{Login.settings.login}}"" name=""username"" ng-model=""username"" placeholder=""Username"" required ng-class=""{error: !Login.validate(loginForm.username)}"" /&gt;
            &lt;span class=""error"" ng-class=""{hidden: Login.validate(loginForm.username)}""&gt;{{loginForm.username.validation[1]}}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;label for=""login-password"" class=""hidden""&gt;Password &lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input id=""login-password"" type=""password"" name=""password"" ng-model=""password"" placeholder=""Password"" required ng-class=""{error: !Login.validate(loginForm.username)}"" /&gt;
            &lt;span class=""error"" ng-class=""{hidden: Login.validate(loginForm.password)}""&gt;{{loginForm.password.validation[1]}}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;input class=""button expand radius"" type=""submit"" value=""Login""/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see there is an object on the form for both the username and password fields, namespaced as <code>[form name].[field name]</code> this object holds all the errors for that input and other information, and I'm saving some custom values to it like the validation array for instance; but the actual values of the field seem to be populated on the same scope as the loginForm, instead of as part of the child object.  What I'd like to be able to do is something like <code>{{[form name].[field name].value}}</code> to get the value.  I hope what I'm saying makes sense, I'd be happy to clarify if needed.</p>

I know with 3.0's connection pooling this is possible, and I have been able to successfully push a job onto the correct Redis DB, but the problem is the Sidekiq web UI is not showing these jobs in the queue (I have mounted a separate Rack app for this that points exclusively to the other Redis DB). The ""Busy"" tab in the admin interface also shows my sidekiq workers that I have pointed at this DB, with correct PIDs. </p>

<p>Here's my sidekiq.rb:</p>

<pre><code>Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  if ENV['REDIS_DB'] == ""2""
    config.redis = { :url =&gt; ""redis://#{SIDEKIQ_HOST}:6379/2"", :namespace =&gt; 'drip' }
  else
    config.redis = { :url =&gt; ""redis://#{SIDEKIQ_HOST}:6379"", :namespace =&gt; 'drip' }
  end
end

Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  if ENV['REDIS_DB'] == ""2""
    config.redis = { :url =&gt; ""redis://#{SIDEKIQ_HOST}:6379/2"", :namespace =&gt; 'drip' }
  else
    config.redis = { :url =&gt; ""redis://#{SIDEKIQ_HOST}:6379"", :namespace =&gt; 'drip' }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>My use case is that I need to have fine grain control over the jobs that go into the second database, so I need the workers configured precisely so they are only using as many resources as I need them to. I only want the workers that are configured in this way to pick up these jobs.</p>

<p>First.. what if I wanted to edit the event? For example I listen for the keyDown event and if it's an ""a"" I turn it in a ""b"", or edit the mouse position in real time, or for example simply capture an event and make it have no effect (disabling a particular key for example..)</p>

<p>Second.. CGEventType is defined with an enum that lists only a few types.. for example when I hit CMD I get a 12, but that doesn't match the value specified in the enum.. what I'm I missing??</p>

<ul>
<li>ThrottleEvent is inaccurate since flash must render in view, then go out of view for this event to be triggered. It is not automatically dispatched if flash is below the fold.</li>
<li>Detecting a reduction of frame rate: Also inaccurate for the same
issue. Flash if renders below the fold, the frame rate is going to
read as if it is not suppressed. Flash must scroll into view then out
of view for the frame rate to read properly as suppressed.</li>
<li>Event enter frame for frame rate also inaccurate for issues above;
needs to be in view and go out of view to see the slow down.</li>
<li>Activate/Deactivate -- needs focus so that doesn't help. I need to
detect without focus.</li>
<li>Event.Render...useless.</li>
<li>Timer... no help there.</li>

<p>I've gone through tons of permutations of those above, combinations but nothing seems to be accurate enough. I know that Flash is being suppressed but I can't detect it. If I could know that Flash is playing at its proper operating speed (not suppressed) as in the viewport I could know the alternate. Flash has to already be in the viewable area to know if its being suppressed.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can go about this?</p>

        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    });

    request.fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus) {

<p>Maybe I got the Jquery Mobile ""we replace just the <code>page-div</code> with the other <code>page-div</code> from the new URL"" thing wrong, but I understand it in that way that my whole JS logic will also be pulled from the new ressource.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Thanks. I have updated my JS code, which looks now like that:</p>

    });

    request.done(function(msg) {
            if(parseInt(msg.status)==1)
            {
                //top_notification(""Willkommen zurück!"",""success"");

            {

<p>Is there another method to ensure that the Cygwin ssh environment has the ""CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning"" variable set? I'm open to other ideas for working around this in (ant, different ssh, etc), though I'd prefer to just have Cygwin not issue the warning.</p>

<p>I then click the green zoom button in the title bar. The window subsequently maximizes and fills the entire desktop. I then click the zoom button again. The window shrinks to the original width but not the original height. It's not as tall as it was when it was maximized, but much taller than the original height:</p>

<p>I then right-click on the toolbar and hides it. The toolbar animates away but is then immediately visible again. However, the buttons can't be clicked and the window can't be moved by dragging it. It's just as if the toolbar actually deactivated. In order to illustrate it this is what it looks like if the window is resized in this state:</p>

<p>I would like to parse this pgm file into the data structure (ASCIIGreymap) to compare two images later. But like i said i don't know how to get there. If my approach is wrong or if there are better ways of parsing a pgm image please let me know.</p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Since i haven't made any progress with parsing a pgm file i am not so sure anymore if my approach is correct.<br>
Can someone please comment on my general idea to take the content of the file and put it in a data structure to further work with the data? Or is there a better way?</p>

<p>What I mean is that the tables are this,</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[UndergroundFacilityShape]
([FacilityID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
[FacilityTypeID] [int] NOT NULL,
[FacilitySpatialData] [geometry] NOT NULL)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[UndergroundFacilityDetail]

[FacilityID] [int] NOT NULL,
[Name] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
[Value] [nvarchar](255) NOT NULL)
</code></pre>

<p>So each UndergroundFacilityShape can have multiple UndergroundFacilityDetail. The problem is that the FacilityID is not defined until the insert is done because it is an identity column. If I bulk insert the data into the Shape table then I cannot match it back up the the Detail data I have in my C# application.</p>

<p>I am guessing the solution is to run a SQL statement to find out what the next identity value is and popuplate the values myself and turn off the identity column for the bulk insert? Bear in mind that only one person is going to be running this application to insert data, and it will be done infrequently so we don't have to worry about identity values clashing or anything like that.</p>

<p>I am trying to import thousands of records, which takes about 3 minutes using standard inserts, but bulk insert will take a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>In the future I am expecting to import data that is much bigger than 'thousands' of records.</p>

<p>The major part of that is detecting relationships, provided that the database has all relevant constraints in place and you have no naming conventions at all — I want to be able to have this ORM work with a database made by any crazy DBA which has his own views on what the columns and tables should be named like. And I'm stuck at many-to-many relationships.</p>

<p>First, there can be <strong>compound keys</strong>. Then, there can be <strong>MTM relationships with three or more tables</strong>. Then, a MTM intermediary table might have its own <strong>data apart from keys</strong> — some data common to all tables it ties together.</p>

<p>What I want is a method to programmatically detect that a table X is an intermediary table tying tables A and B, and that any non-key data it has must belong to both A and B (and if I change a common attribute from within A, it should affect the same attribute in B). Are there common algorithms to do that? Or at least to make guesses which are right in 80% of the cases (provided the DBA is sane)?</p>

It's mostly gone well, but the last ""gotcha"" is that the application needs a class loader policy of ""parent last/application"". I'd like to automate this because currently, when I use the <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/was6-maven-plugin/"" rel=""nofollow"">WAS plugin for Maven</a>, it seems to uninstall and reinstall the application completely, and so I have to go through the admin console every time the code changes and the application is redeployed. If I could have the class loader settings built in to the deployed EAR, work would go much faster.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, class loader configuration is controlled in a RAD-managed file, ""deployment.xml"" which is located in my EAR project's ""META-INF/ibmconfig"" folder. I am guessing that I can include this directory structure in my EAR and it will work fine when it's deployed to WebSphere, but I'm more concerned about the contents of this file. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;appdeployment:Deployment xmi:version=""2.0"" xmlns:xmi=""http://www.omg.org/XMI"" xmlns:appdeployment=""http://www.ibm.com/websphere/appserver/schemas/5.0/appdeployment.xmi"" xmi:id=""Deployment_1460348645719""&gt;
  &lt;deployedObject xmi:type=""appdeployment:ApplicationDeployment"" xmi:id=""ApplicationDeployment_1460348645719"" startingWeight=""10"" warClassLoaderPolicy=""SINGLE""&gt;
    &lt;modules xmi:type=""appdeployment:WebModuleDeployment"" xmi:id=""WebModuleDeployment_1460348645719"" startingWeight=""10000"" uri=""MyWarProject1.war""/&gt;
    &lt;modules xmi:type=""appdeployment:EJBModuleDeployment"" xmi:id=""EJBModuleDeployment_1460348645719"" startingWeight=""5000"" uri=""MyEJBProject1.jar""/&gt;

    &lt;classloader xmi:id=""Classloader_1460348645719"" mode=""PARENT_LAST""/&gt;
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>All of the modules in the application have IDs such as <code>EJBModuleDeployment_1460348645719</code>, and I'm guessing these were created when the application was originally published to WAS via RAD. If I give the new Maven-ized project to a new developer, would they be able to use this <code>deployment.xml</code> file or are there parts of it that are specific to a particular WAS instance that are usually managed by RAD?</p>

<p>Also, if I add more modules to the application later on, how would I generate new module IDs with Maven? Can I just make up an ID, like <code>EJBModuleDeployment_123</code> or is this something that really should be managed by RAD/WAS? I was also wondering if I could write a Jython script to do this and somehow integrate that with Maven, but I'm not sure if that would work or if it's even necessary.</p>

<pre><code>/app/connections/mysql.rb
/app/connections/twitter.rb

<p>Then, in those models, I would make the appropriate connection, whether it would be to MySQL, or an API like Twitter. Either way, the model would make the connection to the source and return whatever data I need. </p>

<p>What I <strong>REALLY</strong> am working for is the ability to <strong>highlight/select</strong> these images if tapped, and <strong>highlight/deselect</strong> them if tapped again.  I will have another button on screen that will navigate to the next page (irrelevant here).</p>

<p>Am I going down the right path here? Obviously I will populate an <code>NSArray</code> of <code>UIImages</code> and populate the <code>scrollView</code> that way, but just spiking it out for now.

class readonly
{
    friend OWNER;

public:
    explicit readonly(const T &amp;t) : m_t(t)
    {

<p>Which works great, to optimize performance a little I use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>class A

    {
    }

    ~A()
    {
    }

#else
    int m_x, m_y;
#endif
};
</code></pre>

<p>However I would love to eliminate the precompiler switch which checks if we're doing a debug or release build... Does anyone see a solution using a macro or clever template trick?</p>

<p>EDIT: I've checked the performance in a loop, it generates about 15~20% overhead using VS2010. It does not result in the same code, automatic inlining enabled.</p>

<p>EDIT #2: I've created a unit test, eliminating all other stuff. I have no performance loss anymore, so great, there was no problem after all. Thanks for the help! And I've fixed the constructor, good call.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/taAFa.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The 3 drag-able parts will be UIImage's with CapInsets to keep the arrow looking normal when stretched. The canvas UIImageView will have the same aspect as the actual image ensuring no black space is visible.</p>

<p>My questions is this. After a drag-able part has been stretched, how do I save the results of the UIImageView (the smaller drag-able parts) to disk/memory for later modifying of the background image (the background UIImageView canvas). It is important to ensure what image I used to modify the canvas looks exactly the same as the UIImageView drag-able part that represented it. That means that it must retain exactly how the image is displayed, including the CapInsets.</p>

<p>I am ignoring rotation of the drag-able parts for now because I suspect that would be the easy part.</p>

<p>To reiterate, when ran in java web start, the window pops up and the program runs correctly with no error messages, but it does not write the files properly to the users system. At the same time, when test data is provided in .txt files, it reads it correctly.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>My question is, why can't we make the compiler smarter? The authors say that &ldquo;but the programmer will always know things that the compiler cannot figure out&rdquo;. However, that's not a valid answer because the compiler can indeed figure out that <code>map f (map g xs)</code> is equivalent to <code>map (f . g) xs</code>, and here is how:</p>

<pre><code>map f (map g xs)
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><code>map g xs</code> unifies with <code>map f [] = []</code>.</p>

<p>Hence <code>map g [] = []</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>map f (map g []) = map f []</code>.</p>

<p><code>map f []</code> unifies with <code>map f [] = []</code>.</p>

<p>Hence <code>map f (map g []) = []</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>map g xs</code> unifies with <code>map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs</code>.</p>

<p>Hence <code>map g (x:xs) = g x : map g xs</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>map f (map g (x:xs)) = map f (g x : map g xs)</code>.</p>

<p><code>map f (g x : map g xs)</code> unifies with <code>map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs</code>.</p>

<p>Hence <code>map f (map g (x:xs)) = f (g x) : map f (map g xs)</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hence we now have the rules:</p>

<pre><code>map f (map g [])     = []
map f (map g (x:xs)) = f (g x) : map f (map g xs)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see <code>f (g x)</code> is just <code>(f . g)</code> and <code>map f (map g xs)</code> is being called recursively. This is exactly the definition of <code>map (f . g) xs</code>. The algorithm for this automatic conversion seems to be pretty simple. So why not implement this instead of rewriting rules?</p>

<p>If <strong>I save open the content aspx file in Visual Studio and re-save it, the error goes away, but then re-occurrrs later</strong>. I'm guessing the saving forces a re-compile which fixes the error.</p>

<p>I've tried placing the content page in debug mode when the error happens.<br>
However, re-saving fixes the problem and it' not happened again since the page has been in debug mode - so I can't get a specific line number for the error.<br>
My guess anyway is that it's erroring whilst trying to combine the master page and the content page - so I doubt I'd get a line number anyhow.</p>

<p>When the error happens, some other content pages that use the same master page still work OK.</p>

<p>Any ideas anyone?</p>

<p>So I figured I should create such function which looked like;</p>

<pre><code>- (CGFloat)fontSizeWithText:(NSString*)text andFont:(UIFont*)font constrainedSize:(CGSize)size LBM:(UILineBreakMode)LBM
{
    // check if text fits to label

<p>Until recently I've just used a single MySQL datasource for my domain, which Cloudfoundry detects and automagically creates and binds a MySQL service instance to.</p>

<p>I now have a requirement to store potentially large files somewhere, so I figured I'd take a look at MongoDB's GridFS. Cloudfoundry supports MongoDB, so I'd assumed Cloudfoundry would do some more magic when I deployed my app and would provide me with a MongoDB datasource as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I'm not prompted to create/bind a MongoDB service when I deploy my app, and I think this may be down to the way I'm connecting to Mongo.</p>

<p>I'm not using the MongoDB plugin, as this conflicts with another plugin I'm using, and in any case I don't need to persist any of my domain to Mongo - just some large files - so I'm using the Mongo java driver directly (similar to this - <a href=""http://jameswilliams.be/blog/entry/171"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jameswilliams.be/blog/entry/171</a>).</p>

I want this macro to create a sheet after the 102014 one with the name 112014, but I can't use select or active sheet because it is actually part of a big macro and I switch back and forth between workbooks. Here is what I tried to do, with no success:</p>

<pre><code>dim wbname as string
dim thismonth as string
dim lastmonth as string

thismonth = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(""Sheet2"").Cells([address of a cell with the name of the sheet).Value
lastmonth = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(""Sheet2"").Cells([address of a cell with the name of the sheet).Value

wbname = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(""Sheet2"").Cells([address of a cell with the file name here])
Workbooks(wbname).Sheets.Add(After = wbkname.Sheets(lastmonth)).Name = thismonth
</code></pre>

<p>The macro simply passes this last line and goes to the other one, no error, no nothing. As you  can see, I have a list with the sheet names and file names, and this is where I get the <code>thismonth</code>, <code>lastmonth</code> and <code>wbname</code> variables from. </p>

<pre><code>private AutoResetEvent block;
private ThreadedQueue&lt;Message&gt; messageQueue;        

private void DoSend()
{
    try
    {   
        while(!this.disposing)

            {                       
                this.block.Set();
            }                   

            if(message != null)
            {
                this.Send(message);                 
            }
        }
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        // Log
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a <code>Queue</code> method that adds one or more new message to the messageQueue and calls <code>block.Set()</code> so that one of the 5 threads can send the message.  When one of the threads is allowed to run, so long as there are messages in the queue, <code>block.Set()</code> is called so that the next message can be de-queued and another of 5 threads will work to send it.  And so on, until the queue is empty.  This all works OK.</p>

<p>However when I dispose my object, I set the disposing variable and then for each thread:</p>

<pre><code>if(thread.ThreadState == ThreadState.Running)
{
    thread.Join();
}
else if(thread.ThreadState == ThreadState.WaitSleepJoin)
{
    thread.Abort();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Most of the time, the threads are sleeping due to the <code>block.WaitOne</code> and so the above code aborts the thread.  However this causes thread abort exceptions to be logged.  I could catch thread abort exceptions separately to other exceptions and choose not to log, but it doesn't seem very clean.</p>

<p>What is the best way to clean up these threads without causing this excess logging?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I've changed the above to:</p>

<pre><code>private ManualResetEvent block;
private ThreadedQueue&lt;Message&gt; messageQueue;        

private void DoSend()
{
    try
    {   
        while(!this.disposing)
        {
            this.block.WaitOne();

            Message message = null; 
            if (!this.messageQueue.TryDequeue(out message) &amp;&amp; !this.disposing)
            {                       
                // There's nothing else to send for now to block the sending threads
                // unless we're disposing as we want the other threads to exit too
                this.block.Reset();
            }                   

            if(message != null)
            {
                this.Send(message);                 
            }
        }
    }
    catch(Exception ex)

<p>Consider I have three scripts to work with: homepage.php, list.php, form.php.</p>

<p>Conceptually, from the homepage, the user will indicate that they want to view a list. The user can then click on elements of the list, to bring up a form allowing them to alter attributes of the list item. The user submits the form and is returned back to the list, so that they can continue to view the list and make changes to the list items if needed.</p>

<p>Now here is the problem, when the user hits back a this point, I want them to return to the homepage, since they are currently viewing the list, and in the context of the web app, going backwards at this point should return the user to the homepage. Instead, if they hit back they go back to the form (PRG is used so no problems with double post), and then back to the list, and then back to the homepage.</p>

<p><strong>Currently what happens:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>openbrowser   -> Get homepage.php</li>
<li>homepage.php  -> GET list.php</li>
<li>list.php      -> GET form.php</li>
<li>form.php      -> PRG (POST to form.php, Redirect back to list.php)</li>

Also when you go back to the purchased controller after viewing the game controller it resets back to 0 from whatever number it was, but if you view any other controller then back to purchased then the number will store and not reset back to 0.</p>

<li>The followers receive the entry and append it to their

<li>The leader then commits the entry by writing it to a durable

<li>The followers then commit the entries based on leader's
commit index by storing the entry to their durable store (file)</li>

<p>I am defining some strings, sometimes based on other strings.  As in the example below which is a simple example:</p>

private static final String X2 = X1 + ""//table[contains(@id,'tony')]"";

<p>but that's not what actually happens since it is unused, you get this message:
<strong>The value of the field ViewProviderDemographicsPage.X3 is not used</strong></p>

<p>So I always have to put something like <strong>String dummy = X3;</strong> so I can avoid that message.  I tried putting @SuppressWarnings(unused) at the top of the file (I may have the syntax wrong here but it was correct in the file).  But that appears just to suppress the warning only for the line directly under it.  Is there any way to have it show the value when you hover even if it is unused?</p>

<p>What else would be optimal is if when you hover it just showed the value without the ="" and "" around it, and the name of the variable.  I can never select just the xpath so when I copy and paste into firefox inspect I have to paste and then remove the ="" and ""</p>

<p>I am planning on implementing a statistical distribution class, using templates.
I want to make Distribution a property of an Entity class. This Distribution class can take a few different forms - TriangleDistribution, NormalDistribution and WeightedDistribution, but these are only known at runtime. They share most methods, but each type may have some custom methods too eg. setMean for NormalDistribution, setWeights for WeightedDistribution.</p>

<p>As I understand it, C++ templates refer to a type, which is then used to determine which implementation to use. It was suggested that I implement the different distribution types using templates.</p>

<p>While I think I understand the concepts of C++ templates, I'm not sure how I would go about implementing them to solve this Distribution problem. Do I use template specialialization create something like the following?:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;WeightedDistribution&gt;
class Distribution {
    WeightedDistribtion wd;
  public:
    Distribution () {}
    double sample () {
      // Custom implementation of sample
      // for weighted distribution
    }
};

// class template specialization:
template &lt;&gt;
class Distributionr &lt;NormalDistribution&gt; {
    NormalDistribtion nd;
  public:
    Distribution () {}
    double sample ()
    {
      // Custom implementation of sample for 
      // a normal distribution
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This would necessitate creating numerous types for each distribution type.
TIA guys.

"4296675","1","","","2010-11-28 12:14:04","","0","406","<p>Here's yet another question on Core Data and multithreading:</p>

<p>I'm writing an application on the iPhone that retrieves XML data from the internet, parses it in a background thread (using NSXMLparser) and saves the data in Core Data using its own NSManagedObjectContext. I have a class - let's call it DataRetriever - that does this for me.</p>

<p>There are different UIViewControllers that then retrieve the data to display it in their respective UITableViews, of course this happens on the main thread using  NSFetchedResultsControllers and a single managed object context that is used for reading.</p>

<p>I've read the answer to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3090039/core-data-save-crashes"">this question</a>, which tells me that I need to register for NSManagedObjectDidSaveNotifications on the background thread (this will be done by the DataRetriever class I suppose) and then call the mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification method on the reading context from that class on the main thread. This, I think, is totally thread-unsafe. I might have interpreted this the wrong way, though.</p>

<p>I've also read <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdConcurrency.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003385-SW1"" rel=""nofollow"">this part</a> of Apple's documentation on the subject (<em>Track Changes in Other Threads Using Notifications)</em>, and it tells me to simply register for NSManagedObjectDidSaveNotifications <em>coming from</em> the reading context <em>in</em> the view controller <em>on</em> the main thread and then it would have to call mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification to update its reading context.</p>

<p>I went with Apple's recommendations: I now have my view controllers register themselves to NSManagedObjectDidSaveNotifications on the main thread using the reading managed object context as the source of the notifications. Doing this on the writing context probably isn't thread safe, and Apple's documentation isn't very specific on this.</p>

<p>Result: No crashes, but I am not receiving any notifications either.</p>

<p>Side note: I've read in Apple's documentation that notifications don't automatically propagate to other threads and I might even be listening for notifications from the wrong context, but why is Apple telling me to do it this way, then?</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>-- EDIT --</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I'm registering for notifications coming from a <em>particular</em> NSManagedObjectContext, Apple's documentation specifically states (<a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreDataFramework/Classes/NSManagedObjectContext_Class/NSManagedObjectContext.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>) that some system frameworks may use an instance of Core Data themselves, so I could be receiving notifications from contexts that don't concern me if I don't specify a source. The documentation I referred to earlier on doesn't say anything about this, though. Any comments on this design choice are welcome.</p>

<p>When trying to do a Update-Database statement. it first sais that there still are code changes.</p>

<p>So i execute the Add-Migration xxx Command and fire the Update-DAtabase command again. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: </p>

<p>Solving some difference in my Code-first code an viewcode solved this issue!</p>

<p>The c code is to capture the real-time events(very frequent) of the system and java code runs as a server to receive the request. When there is an event captured by the c code, we need to send request to java code and wait for the reply. I have tried JNI to call java from c, but it seems that it will stuck after running for several seconds. JNI needs to initialize jvm and search the handler in the class file. Is there any better way to communicate between c and java? Can I compile java code into binary and link it with the c code?

<p>In control's OnLoad event, a reference to application instance is used
(which was passed as a parameter to its Initialize method), but sometimes
control is not initialized before OnLoad event is fired. It is just created,
but Initialize method is never invoked.</p>

<p>Does somebody has similar experiences? Is this usual behavior?</p>

<p>The audio gets imported as numpy array. I take this array and play it using the scikits.audiolab module:</p>

<pre><code>import scikits.audiolab as audiolab

# This is how I import my wav file. ""frames"" is the numpy array, ""fs"" = sampling 
# frequency, ""encoder"" = quantizing at 16 bits

frames, fs, encoder = audiolab.wavread('audio.wav')

# This is how I play my wav file. audiolab plays the frames array at a frequency of 
# 44100 Hz
audiolab.play(frames, fs=44100)

<p>I've recently switched to using the Images.xcassets for the AppIcon and everything looked good from Xcode. No warnings about app icons or archiving errors, however, when they submit to Apple it doesn't get past the Meta-data review because of missing app icons. Specifically, the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Icon specified in the Info.plist not found under the top level app
wrapper:AppIcon40x40</li>
<li>Icon specified in the Info.plist not found under the top level app
wrapper:AppIcon60x60</li>
<li>Icon specified in the Info.plist not found under the top level app
wrapper:AppIcon50x50</li>
<li>Icon specified in the Info.plist not found under the top level app
wrapper:AppIcon72x72</li>
<li>Icon specified in the Info.plist not found under the top level app
wrapper:AppIcon76x76</li>
<li>iPad:AppIcon57x57.png: icon dimensions (57x57) don't meet the size
requirements. The icon file must be 72x72, in .png format</li>
</ul>

<p>All the other icons (building for iOS 6/7 universal app) appear to be fine. I made sure the .xcassets was part of my target and all the other various suggestions here.</p>

<p>So I opened up the .ipa and Payload to check out what Xcode had done. With the exception of AppIcon60x60, it changed the names of my files to AppIcon40x40~iPad and simliar for the rest of them. AppIcon60x60 was actually called AppIcon60x60@2x (which makes sense because it is 120x20 px). The file names in the Info.plist did not contain the ~iPad suffix for the iPad icons, which I feel lead the the issue of rejection.</p>

<p>I was under the impression when you use the Images.xcassets that Xcode would automatically name the icons and fill out the Info.plist appropriately. I am left wondering if it is a problem with archiving the app with a wildcarded distribution profile.</p>

<p>I eventually got the submission to be a success by removing the Images.xcassets and manually assigning the icons and then going into the Info.plist and deleting a few extra entries that were lying around. Any input would be appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>However, when I modify the code, to get slightly closer to the situation I face, so that </p>

<pre><code>integer function addtwo(a, b)

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>real function addtwo(a, b)
  integer, intent(in) :: a, b
  addtwo = a + b
end function
</code></pre>

<p>i.e., the function is now <code>real</code>, not <code>integer</code>, the value returned is always <code>0</code>. Can anyone explain what's going on and how I should get around this?</p>

<p>(PS. I'm using a 64-bit gfortran compiler on mac os snow leopard)</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em>: The function I'm struggling with looks like:</p>

<pre><code>real function ykr(seed)

  integer, intent(in) :: seed
  real ykr0
  ykr= real(seed)
end function

<p>Really, <code>ykr</code> calls another function, <code>ykr0</code>, recursively, but since I'm struggling even with this basic aspect I'm ignoring that for now. I can't see what's different between this code and the above, but calling <code>ykr_(byref(c_int(4)))</code> returns <code>0</code>, not <code>4</code> as expected...</p>

<p>Also I noted that acceptance and functional test cases are exactly the same with the difference that in the functional.suite.yml file, phpBrowser is missing which is present in the acceptance.suite.yml file, and on the codeception website they say that phpBrowser has the following drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can click only on links with valid urls or form submit buttons,</li>
<li>you can't fill fields that are not inside a form,</li>
<li>you can't work with JavaScript interactions: modal windows, datepickers, etc. </li>

<p>I have my war file, which is built by Spring Boot. I just need to run <code>java -jar &lt;file&gt;.war -config=config/</code> to run my app.</p>

<p>I recently started experimenting with Chef, and getting to write recipes that do this job.</p>

<p>The code from my recipe is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#Some code has been omitted intentionally.

directory ""#{home}"" do
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
  recursive true
end

directory ""#{home}/config"" do
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
end
cookbook_file ""#{home}/config/ehcache.xml"" do
  source ""ehcache.xml""
  mode ""0644""
end
# Get the war file from the repo
remote_file ""#{home}/app.war"" do
   source ""#{node['baseos']['files_repo_url']}/wars/app.war""
   owner 'root'
   group 'root'
   mode '0644'
end

execute 'Run the war file' do
  command ""java -jar '#{home}/app.war' -config='#{home}/config/'""
  action :run
end
</code></pre>

<p>The war file, and the related config folder along with its contents are successfully being copied to their respective destinations before the <code>execute</code> command gets fired. The problem is when the machine gets freshly created with <code>kitchen create</code>, the first <code>kitchen verify</code> would fail, saying <code>'Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - java -jar /opt/com/app.war -config=config/'</code>. 
This only happens for the first time. Surprisingly, after saying <code>kitchen verify</code> again, the app starts up, and successfully runs.</p>

<p>This is weird because of the fact that the required file app.war and the config/ are [or should be] already there in the machine with appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>I know Chef processes these things sequentially, so given that the execute command is the very last line in my recipe, it should already have what is required to run the war file. I'm going nuts, can anyone provide some insight into this one?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>The module being tested is</p>

<pre><code>var foam = require('./foam-promise.js');

module.exports = {
    createUserRequest: function(url, operation, action, message, namespace) {
        var actionOp = action + '/actionRequestOp',

        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

<pre><code>return myRequest(url, operation, action, data, namespace)
    .should.finally.be.exactly('12345678');

It sets several variables that are dependent on another incremental variable <code>$i</code>.  I am trying to find a way to call these variables in my template file so it displays their values.  I am envisioning using something like <code>&lt;?php echo $tzDesc; ?&gt;</code>.  </p>

<p>The defined variable look like this: <code>$tzDesc = $custom[""slide{$i}-desc""];</code> where it is referring to the value saved in a custom field.  Each slide has a custom field of a similar name only differing by the incremental number, the value of <code>$i</code>.  I can display them here in this line <code>$page = ""&lt;h2&gt;{$tzTitle}&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src='{$tzImage}' /&gt;"";</code> and it shows up on my page correctly, however I want more flexibility to call the values in different parts of my template file rather than having to define the entire template file in that one line of the function.</p>

<p>Here is the function:</p>

<pre><code>add_action( 'the_post', 'paginate_slide' );

function paginate_slide( $post ) {

    global $pages, $multipage, $numpages;

    if( is_single() &amp;&amp; get_post_type() == 'post' ) {

    $id = get_the_ID();
    $custom = array();
    $pages = array();
    $i = 1;

    foreach( get_post_custom_keys() as $key )
        if ( false !== strpos( $key, 'slide' ) )
            $custom[$key] = get_post_meta( $id, $key, true);

    while( isset( $custom[""slide{$i}-title""] ) ) {

        $page = '';
        $tzTitle = $custom[""slide{$i}-title""];
        $tzImage = $custom[""slide{$i}-image""];

        $i++;
    }

    $numpages = count( $pages );
    }
}

<p>I have tried defining the variables outside the function and declaring them in the function as global but that doesn't seem to work.  </p>

This <strong><em>almost</em></strong> works but it seems to loose the <code>$i</code> variable which defines which slide description to return (eg, slide1-desc or slide2-desc...) and just returns the value for the last slide for every slide.  </p>

I have an Activity, activity has 4 EditText components, 2 of them has popup menu (AlertDialog) which contain the list, next one - is disabled for edit, and last one - is editable, and should show the soft keyboard, when user is tapping on it.</p>

<p>Also, my root LinearLayout has LinearLayout which contain inside RelativeLayout. The last one is need for AdvBanner. Last LinearLayout(RelativeLayout) is aligned to the bottom of root layout.</p>

<p>The part of XML that describes it:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;LinearLayout
      android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
      android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
      android:layout_gravity=""bottom""
      android:focusable=""false""
      android:focusableInTouchMode=""false"" 
      android:gravity=""bottom""&gt;
  &lt;RelativeLayout 
      android:id=""@+id/AdvLayoutReserveArea"" 
      android:layout_width=""fill_parent"" 
      android:layout_height=""50dp"" 
      android:background=""#FFFFFF""
      android:focusable=""false""
      android:focusableInTouchMode=""false"" 
      android:gravity=""bottom"" /&gt; 
  &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>When activity is start, editable EditText has focus with <strong>GREEN</strong> border and cursor is blinking. After few seconds left, the AdvBanner is loaded and shown. When it happens, editable EditText lost  focus.. from this moment, my life be like a nightmare.</p>

<p>Let's look step by step.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1.</strong> 
If in <strong>THIS MOMENT</strong> (when Adv loaded and appears) user is editing an EditText field via the soft keyboard, focus is lost, border take a <strong>GRAY</strong> color, and if user continue to typing  a text is have no result - symbols are not printed (CURSOR in EditText is too lost). </p>

<p>I THINK any user will be annoyed  - when you typing text, and cursor is inactive, because in background some adv is loaded and it take focus for self.</p>

<p>To solve this, in method when Adv is loaded (is shown) I try to back focus manually to EditText by requestFocus method.</p>

<pre><code>public void onAdLoaded() 
    {
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
// add app specific code for this event here...
// called when an ad is successfully displayed on device            
    CountEdit1.requestFocus();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, the cursor is returned to EditText field, and if soft keyboard is active, user can still typing text, but border of EditText field stay GRAY...</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> actually I'm not sure about the difference between GREEN and GRAY border of focused EditText.. GREEN is usually when user is tapping on it, and GRAY, probably, when we want to request a focus manually (using requestFocus() etc)</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2.</strong> (As result of solvation Problem #1).
After soft keyboard was closed, if user tap on editable EditText field, it take focus and cursor appears inside, but no reaction for showing soft keyboard again! Tapping of it do not show soft keyboard, but looks like the edit field in copy mode - when user can select a text and cut/copy it to clipboard.</p>

<p>My goal is easy for a first look. I just want to SAVE the cursor and focus to editable EditText field (CountEdit1) while soft keyboard is shown and user typing some text.
And normal reaction when user tapping EditText - as usually, just show me the soft keyboard!</p>

<p>I read all issues here, I combined different methods (clearFocus, requestFocusFromTouch etc), just not enough of time and space to describe all that I tried to do to solve this. The main problems are described above.</p>

<p>Hope for help and solving the problem...

As starting client again takes a little while and address already in use is thrown. But after a minute it is allowed to bind and listen which was not happening. Is this TTL time i need to wait ?</p>

<p>I wrote a server socket program in which I have server and client running on same host . The server only writes (no read operation by server) while client only reads from server ( no write done by client). When I kill server process and try to run again it says Address already in Use. When using SO_REUSEADDR it allows me to reuse the port but client no more receives data from server. Part of server code </p>

<pre><code>while(1)
{
  write(newsockfd,""I got your message"",18); //Server Publishes data all day
}
</code></pre>

<p>part of client code:-</p>

<pre><code>while(1)
{ 
   n = read(sockfd,buffer,255);//Read all server publishes and store them
   if (n == 0) 
        error(""ERROR reading from socket"");
   printf(""Here is the message: %s \n"",buffer);
   bzero(buffer,256); //Buffer set to Null again
}

<p>If on connection I try netstat -a I can see my server listening to port say 20001 to which i bind it. But I cannot still see establish connection even when both client ans server are running . Client keeps printing data received from 
server. As I kill server process, I see client just printing newline as buffer set to NULL after every read. Now my question is if there is connection already establish which is now terminated does this prevents Server from listening on same port ? My main Question If so why is no other process listening to that port ? SO_REUSEADDR allows server to bind and REUSE ADDR . Is this because Server and client running on same host ? How to handle in case the termination is ungraceful (secondary question). After adding read check as in comment I still see client running and netstat gives me below output:-</p>

<pre><code>  xyz@xyz:~$ netstat -a | grep -i 2001

I'm using sl4 and links in mediaelement are just simple uri's, i need to make it working in this way that when some mp3 was downloaded it will be cached on the client browser and further click on button will use a cached version of file instead of downloading it again and wasting my bandwidth.

I have this ""schema"", where db.pages holds the config for each section of my website:</p>

<pre><code>db.pages = [
   {name: 'contacts', settings:{...}},
   {name: 'blog', settings:{...}, posts: ""blogPosts""},
   {name: 'media', settings: {...}, posts: ""mediaPosts""}

  {title: 'post2', date: '2011-11-22', author:'me', content: '...'},
  {...............................................................}
];
</code></pre>

<p>What i'm doing here is, in each page, i define if i have a posts collection and, in node, when i load the page, i check if <code>page.posts</code> is defined and, if so, load the appropriate collection.</p>

<p>Maybe i'm wrong, but this is looking too much as a relational thing so, my idea, would be to 
put the content of <code>blogPosts</code> directly as the value for the prop <code>posts</code> of the <code>pages</code> collection, like so:</p>

<pre><code>db.pages = [
       {name: 'contacts', settings:{...}},
       { name: 'blog', 
         settings:{...}, 
         posts: [
            {title: 'post1', date: '2011-10-22', author:'me', content: '...'},
            {title: 'post2', date: '2011-11-22', author:'me', content: '...'},
            {...............................................................}
         ]
       },
       {name: 'media', settings: {...}, posts: [...]}
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>I really think this makes much more sense, in a NOSQL environment, but i might be wrong. 
The problem i am having is that using the latter configuration, i can't seem to make nodejs treat the <code>posts</code> field as a mongo collection.</p>

<p>I hope this makes any sense to you and, if so, what i need to know is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I right or wrong to think the second way is the right way?</li>
<li>How can i use node to read that 'sub-collection' as collection so i can apply a cursor and use <code>find()</code>, <code>sort()</code>, <code>limit()</code>, <code>skip()</code>, etc, on it...</li>
</ol>

<p>and 3 customers </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{A,B,C}.</p>

<p>Each customer has a requirement for a set of items. He will either buy all the items in the set or none. There's just one copy of each item.
For example, if </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A requires {1,2,4}, Total money earned = 2+5+1= 8</p>
  
  <p>B requires {2,5,10,3}, Total money earned = 5+5+10+1 = 21</p>
  
  <p>C requires {3,6,7,8,9}, Total money earned = 1+1+1+3+4 = 10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if we sell A his items, B won't purchase from us because we don't have item 2 with us anymore. We wish to earn maximum money. By selling B, we can't sell to A and C.
So, if we sell A and C, we earn 18. But just by selling B, we earn more, i.e., 21.</p>

<p>We thought of a bitmasking solution, which is exponential in order though and only feasible for small set of items. And other heuristic solutions which gave us non-optimal answers. But after multiple tries we couldn't really come up with any fast optimal solution.</p>

<p>We were wondering if this is a known problem, or similar to any problem? Or is this problem NP Hard and thus a polynomial optimal solution doesn't exist and we're trying to achieve something that's not possible?</p>

<p>Also, does the problem change if all the items cost the same?</p>

<p>I noticed that the log files are different for the tserver. All other accumulo log files end up using somename.somedomain.com in their name (master_somename.somedomain.com.log). tserver keeps using localhost.log.</p>

<p>My firewall is disabled.</p>

<p>Then, if I restart it using </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/etc/init.d/accumulo restart</p>

<p>Everything works fine... Tablet Server is started properly.</p>

<p>Any idea what is wrong with this?</p>

<p>I've spent a good amount of time doing my ""due diligence"" hereto pertaining by rereading the chapter text and thinking hard about what this 
""undefined: distance"" error might mean, but so far to no avail.
As you can see, I have defined a ""Distance struct"", created a new() instance of 
it called <code>d</code>, initialized its fields with the <code>.</code> operator, and created a <code>distance()</code> func, but, clearly, I'm not grokking some relevant piece(s) of information.</p>

So far so good... My problem is I don't know how to implement authentication and authorization correctly. </p>

<p>Question 1: If I have an asp.net application that uses asp.net Identity for authentication (Forms Based Authentication) and authorization. Is it possible to pass in those credentials to the WCF service automatically i.e. so that I can perform role based authorization on each service within my service layer? If this is indeed possible can someone provide me with some sample code or point me in the right direction for further reading? If it is not possible? Is there an alternative solution? </p>

<p>Question 2: Do I need two separate databases? i.e. one database for the web application that contains all the users, roles etc and then another database for my service layer that contains all the business data of the application? </p>

<p>I have two tableviews in my app, and they both have practically the same code on the <code>tableView:commitEditingStyle:forRowAtIndexPath</code>: method. One is working fine, the other one has this issue: let's suppose I have more than, I don't know, X rows on my table view, so the cell reuse and scroll are both enabled. If I delete a row on the top of the list, the cells that are showing up on the bottom of the screen are being all duplicated by the bottom cell prior hitting the delete button. So if I delete 5 rows, for example, I'll have identical cells on my tableview. Then if I scroll the tableview they will all go back to normal. (or if I change viewcontroller and then go back to the tableview's one)</p>

<p>Here is the code of the working tableview:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
if (editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete) {
    if (search.text.length == 0) {
        [tableArray removeObjectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
        [goalTable deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
        [self setBG];
        tempArray = [NSArray arrayWithArray:tableArray];
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]setObject:tempArray forKey:@""currentArray""];
        totalGoals = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] integerForKey:@""totalGoals""];
        totalGoals = totalGoals - 1;
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setInteger:totalGoals forKey:@""totalGoals""];
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];
    } } }
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the code of the defective tableview:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
if (editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete) {
    if (search.text.length == 0) {
        [tableArray removeObjectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
        [goalTable deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
        [self setBG];
        tempArray = [NSArray arrayWithArray:tableArray];
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]setObject:tempArray forKey:@""completedArray""];
        completedGoals = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] integerForKey:@""completedGoals""];
        completedGoals = completedGoals - 1;
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setInteger:completedGoals forKey:@""completedGoals""];
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];
    } } }
</code></pre>

<p>Well, it's pretty much the same, so I'm a little lost here - They have the same code and one is working fine and the other isn't. Could it be an issue at the <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> method? I'm wondering that, but couldn't find nothing on this method, plus they are practically the same too.</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    static NSString * identifier = @""Cell"";
    UITableViewCell * cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:identifier];
    if (cell==nil) { 
        //here I'm setting up the cells, labels, and stuff.
    }

    if (search.text.length == 0 &amp;&amp; [filteredArray count] == 0) {
        NSDictionary * dict = [tableArray objectAtIndex:[tableArray count] - 1 - indexPath.row];
        //here I use the values on the dict to do some stuff with labels, etc.
    }
    return cell;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, I'm ""fliping"" the array with this line:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary * dict = [tableArray objectAtIndex:[tableArray count] - 1 - indexPath.row];
</code></pre>

<p>If I don't do that, ie, when I do something like <code>[tableArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]</code> only, the deleting issue won't happen at all! It's something that happens cause of the reversed array. 
Oh, just to mention, when I'm populating the cell (when the view is loading, for example), the cell reuse is working just fine, no duplicate cells or anything like that. It's something that only happens when deleting rows.</p>

<p>But: Do I have to use any JS library to really make it work, like HTML5shim, Modernizr or HTML5 Boilerplate (although I know that HTML5 Boilerplate isn't a library)?</p>

<p>I mean, what are these projects about if I don't have to use them - I've read using HTML5shim would be a so called 'best practice', is this true?
What happens if I don't use any of them? Will some browsers ignore markup-elements like <code>section</code> and <code>aside</code>?</p>

<p>I've also read that using these libraries is essentially bad, because if the user has deactivated JS, the site breaks - but on the other hand: Who has JS deactivated nowadays? I could just include a <code>noscript</code> tag, couldn't I?</p>

<p>Also, I've read in an article that these libraries cause more problems then they give us a benefit. To me it seems like the personal opinion of the author, or do they really cause so many problems?</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>Alright, after testing Modernizr together with the HTML5 Boilerplate I have to say that this is a great solution so far. But one thing bugs me, I am not sure if I am doing it right.
Example: I want to use <code>border-radius</code> on a div called <code>#form-box</code>. For this example I assume that the round corners are essential for the website. If they weren't essential I wouldn't see a problem if IE users don't see them.</p>

<p>So I've got the class, giving the box the basic styling every browser should be able to interpret:</p>

<pre><code>#form-box {
    background-color: #f0eeee;
    width: 400px;
    height: 300px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    margin-top: 50px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, for browsers that know <code>border-radius</code>:</p>

<pre><code>.borderradius #form-box {
    -webkit-border-radius: 8px; /* Saf3-4, iOS 1-3.2, Android ≤1.6 */
    -moz-border-radius: 8px; /* FF1-3.6 */
    border-radius: 8px; /* Opera 10.5, IE9, Saf5, Chrome, FF4, iOS 4, Android 2.1+ */
    /* useful if you don't want a bg color from leaking outside the border: */
    -moz-background-clip: padding; -webkit-background-clip: padding-box; background-clip: padding-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And for browsers that don't know <code>border-radius</code> (i.e. the IE6), I use the polyfill ""PIE"" that adds round corners, even in IE using JS the .htc-file:</p>

<pre><code>.no-borderradius #form-box {
    behavior: url(PIE.htc);
    -webkit-border-radius: 8px; /* Saf3-4, iOS 1-3.2, Android ≤1.6 */
    -moz-border-radius: 8px; /* FF1-3.6 */
    border-radius: 8px; /* Opera 10.5, IE9, Saf5, Chrome, FF4, iOS 4, Android 2.1+ */
    /* useful if you don't want a bg color from leaking outside the border: */
    -moz-background-clip: padding; -webkit-background-clip: padding-box; background-clip: padding-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is how I do it at the moment. It's cool, but: So much repeating code? Is it true that this is really neccessary? Or am I doing something wrong?</p>

    'page callback' =&gt; 'get_form_ajax',
    'access arguments' =&gt; array('access content'),

<p>I have two arrays and I'm iterating through the elements of array. One array is <code>arrAllDetailsConstantData</code> and the other one is <code>arrAllDetails</code>. I want to <strong>compare</strong> using <strong>arrAllDetailsConstantData</strong>  and <strong>update</strong> using <strong>arrAllDetails</strong>. </p>

<p>I am using nested loops. But what is happening is that while updating array <strong>arrAllDetails</strong>, array <strong>arrAllDetailsConstantData</strong> is also getting updated. I assume this is somehow related to scope of parent this (though I am just guessing). Can you please help me with this?</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>$.each(privateVariables.arrAllDetailsConstantData, function() {

<p>I have json data from an url which I display in the table cell using a switch statement. Since I have only 6 cells, I had  used a switch statement but I am curious to know if there is any other method in place of switch statement to do so. </p>

<pre><code>switch(indexPath.row)
    {
        case 0 :
            cell.textLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@ %@"",[dictionary valueForKey:@""firstname""],
                                   [dictionary valueForKey:@""lastname""]];
            break;

        case 1:
            cell.textLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@ : %@"",@""Address"",[dictionary valueForKey:@""address""]];
            break;

        case 2:
            cell.textLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@ : %@"",@""Age"",[dictionary valueForKey:@""age""]];
            break;

        case 3:
            cell.textLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@ : %@"",@""Occupation"",[dictionary valueForKey:@""occupation""]];
            break;

            cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator;
            cell.textLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@ : %@"",@""Rating"",[rate valueForKey:@""average""]];

<p>We've decided to use asynchronous sockets and a single (UI) thread. Consequently, there are 2 ways to go:  </p>

<p>1) state machine -- if we get a block on socket reading, just remember the current state and quit. Later on, a socket notification will arrive and the interrupted logic will resume from the proper stage;</p>

<p>2) inner message loop -- once we determine that reading from the socket would block, we enter an inner message loop and spin there until all the necessary data is finally received.
UI is not thus frozen in case of a block.</p>

<p>As experience showed, the second approach is bad, as any message can come while we're in the inner message loop.  I cannot tell the full story here, but it simply is not reliable enough. Crashes and kludges.</p>

<p>The first option seems to be quite acceptable, but it is not easy to program in such a style.  One has to remember the state of an algorithm and values of all the local variables required for further processing.</p>

<p>This is quite possible to use multiple threads, but we just thought that the problems in this case would be even much harder: synchronization of frame-buffer access, multi-threading issues, etc.  Moreover, even in this variant it seems necessary to use asynchronous sockets as well.</p>

<p>So, what way is in your opinion the best ?</p>

<p>The problem is quite a general one.  This is the problem of organizing asynchronous communication through stateful protocols.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> We use C++ and MFC as UI framework.</p>

<p>We're using Flask to develop a fairly simple application to ""scratch an itch"" we realized we had while working on a previous project. Session management is handled through the <a href=""https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">Flask-Login</a> extension, coupled with the <a href=""https://github.com/cenkalti/github-flask"" rel=""nofollow"">Github-Flask</a> extension which we use for user authentication. The app uses Flask-SQLAlchemy and Psycopg2 (2.6.3) to connect to a PostgreSQL 9.1 database where user data is stored.</p>

<p><strong>Issue</strong></p>

<p>When the app is run locally (or deployed to a remote server) for testing we're seeing a strange condition during the first login attempt. The first time I log in I successfully get through the Github authentication sets, but immediately see this error.</p>

<pre><code>DataError: (DataError) invalid input syntax for integer: ""None""
LINE 3: WHERE ""user"".id = 'None'
                      ^
'SELECT ""user"".id AS user_id, ""user"".date_created AS user_date_created,

user_github_id \nFROM ""user"" \nWHERE ""user"".id = %(param_1)s' {'param_1': u'None'}
</code></pre>

<p>I can close the browser tab and then revisit the application URL and see the same message. However, if I close the browser window, completely clear my browser's cache, and then attempt to log back in, it works as expected and I'm able to use the application. From that point on I can log out, switch browsers, clear browser cache again, etc., and there don't appear to be any problems -- it's only that first login until browser cache is cleared that this happens.</p>

<p>My testing shows that this happens on any user and two different users can be in two different states at the same time (one has cleared cache and now isn't having problems, the other who hasn't taken those steps is still stuck in the error state.</p>

<p>Originally we used a local SQLite database instead of Postgres. The issue does not exist there. It only has occurred since the switch to Postgres.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss for what steps I can take to remedy this situation. So far the questions I know to ask haven't been able to lead to the right answers when I search online.</p>

<p>For reference, I'll include the full stack trace as well.</p>

<p>Now without committing anything to the newly created submodule, I'm still left with the complete duplicate history of the binary files in my original repository.

<p>In addition it gets stored in a cookie. I check in the run function if the token exists, if so i store it in the service.</p>

    }

<p>I now wanna show the login-screen if the cookie is expired (with an interceptor).</p>

<p>The cookie gets deleted correctly from the browser when it expires. But my token is still stored in the service. How can i know that the cookie is not present? Should i check for the cookie on each $http request? 
This looks like a overkill for me.</p>

<p>Whats the best practice to solve this problem?</p>

But here is my question:</p>

<p>For this example, I will explain what I see, ask the question, and the provide an example. (I will be using the word <code>Method</code> because that's the word I think is appropriate until told otherwise)</p>

<p>Do you know how you you can have a variable, and for the sake of this example, it's an <code>String</code>. Now for this string you could use a method like <code>myString.setText(""String"");</code>, or <code>myString.equalsIgnoreCase(otherString);</code></p>

<p>My question is, is it completely possible to create your own method?</p>

<p>For the sake of this example, lets say <code>myString.setText(""Knife"");</code>, now since we know <code>myString</code> is a knife, could I create a method where I could call <code>myString</code> to see if it was equipped, or to make it equipped? For example: <code>myString.setEquipped(true);</code> and if I wanted to check if it was equipped or not, I could call <code>myString.getEquipped();</code></p>

<p>Am I using the word <code>Method</code> properly? And if my original question is possible, could we provide a small example?</p>

My problem is that the obstacles generate, but don't position correctly, and then they won't move. I'm trying to move them with jQuery's <code>css()</code> - the <code>css</code> method works fine on anything else but when used with <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> doesn't.</p>

<p>The problem functions (generate and move obstacles):</p>

<pre><code>game.background.generateObs = function() {
var top = Math.floor(Math.random()*game.canvas.height);
var left = game.canvas.width-10;
var $obs = $(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"")
$obs.addClass(""obs"").appendTo(""#canvas"");
$obs.css({
    background: ""black"",
    position: ""absolute"",
    height: game.obstacle.height,
    width: game.obstacle.width,
});
$obs.css(""top"", $(""#canvas"").offset().top  + top )
    .css(""left"",$(""#canvas"").offset().left + left);
game.obstacle.width = Math.floor(Math.random()*200);
if(game.gameState==""running"") {
    setTimeout(""game.background.generateObs()"",obsInterval);
}
else {
    return;
}
}

game.background.moveObs = function() {
var currentPos = $(""#canvas div.obs"").css(""left"");
var newPos = currentPos - game.obstacle.frameWidth;
$(""#canvas div.obs"").css(""left"",newPos);
if(game.gameState==""running"") {
    setTimeout(""game.background.moveObs()"",interval);
}
else {
    return;

<p>The other thing is that jsFiddle is now telling me that <code>game</code> is undefined, when I have defined it right at the start.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Here's the <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Nf4n3/"" rel=""nofollow"">fiddle</a>.</p>

<p>Running the webapp from homepage in iOS4.3.3 and iOS5.1.1 runs fine, fullscreen and I am able to select the audio and subtitle tracks.</p>

<p>Now I have an iPod 5th generation with iOS6.0.1. If I run the same webapp on that device from the homescreen, it runs fullscreen but when I press the subtitle button, the menu does not appear on top of the video. When I press the subtitle button (only available when in landscape orientation), then move back to portrait and press the done button, I can see that the adiotrack/subtitle menu was behind the video.</p>

<p>My minimal testcase</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no""/&gt;

   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I open this in the browser, save it to homescreen and then start it from the homescreen, the audiotrack/subtitle menu is not visible (apparently behind the movie)
When I remove the line with comment <code>&lt;!-- THIS LINE --&gt;</code>, open the page in the browser, save it to homescreen and start it from there, I can see the audiotrack/subtitle menu without problems. However, the webapp is not fullscreen anymore.</p>

<p>Anyone knows a workaround to keep the webapp fullscreen when started from homepage -AND- being able to see the audiotrack/subtitle menu?</p>

<p>NOTE: This only fails on iPod. Testing on iPad3 with iOS6.0.1 simply shows the menu.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
A member of the class came over and we looked through the code. Here was the problem:</p>

<pre><code>ostream &amp; operator &lt;&lt; (ostream &amp; out, const Giant &amp; giant)
{
   for(int i = giant.chunks.getNumItems() - 1;
      i &gt;= 0; i -= 1)
   {
      if (i != giant.chunks.getNumItems()-1)
         out &lt;&lt; setw(9) &lt;&lt; setfill('0');
      out &lt;&lt; giant.chunks.getData(i);
   }
   return out;
}

<p>I forgot to force display the leading zeros which caused problems. The solution has been found.</p>

<p>The way I did it was like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(class).animate(
    {something},
    {
        duration: 1000,
        complete: function(){
                      $(class).animate(

                              complete:  function(){
                              // More to animate when previous animation is done
                          }
                  });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Until now, this worked quite well. My problem is the following:</p>

<p>To trigger this chain of animations, I am using a click on an element. When you click on that element, there is a variable ""ongoing"" that becauses true so that it is not possible to reclick on that element because the end of the animation has not yet been reached.</p>

<p>The deepest animation in this chain of animations is the following.</p>

<pre><code>complete: function(){
    $(few divs).each(function(){
        $(this).delay(delay).animate(
            {""opacity"": 1},
            {
                duration:2000,
                complete: function(){
                      console.log(i + "" finished""); //
                      if(i == 2){ // 3 divs
                          ongoing = false; // All the animations are finished, allowed to reclick
                      }
                }
                delay += 2000;
            });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that it shows 3 times 0,1,2.</p>

<pre><code>0 finished
1 finished
2 finished
0 finished
1 finished
2 finished
0 finished
1 finished
2 finished
</code></pre>

<p>I then tried this:</p>

<pre><code>complete: function(){
    selected = text;

    $(few divs).each(function(i){
        $(this).delay(delay).animate({""opacity"": 1}, 2000);
        delay += 2000;
    }).promise().done(function(){ // All each's are finished
        ongoing = false;
        console.log(""finished"");
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this example, there is also an infinite loop with the ""finished""...</p>

<p>What exactly is going on in my code and why doesn't it work?</p>

<p>The app has a relational grid it displays with entities used for analysis. The way to add entities in mobile safari and other desktop browsers is to click a link on the top of the app, which opens a popup with a search box. The user searches for the topic, and then checks off which entities to add to the grid. The user then hits a button within the popup, and the window disappears and populates the grid with the selected entities.</p>

<p>However, I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to have the two windows communicate. As of now, I have a new UIWebView open up when that particular link is clicked, but the parent-child connection is not made like it is in the browser version. Therefore I can select entities to add, but when I hit the button, the entities are not added to the grid. I'm not sure how to get around this.</p>

<p>Another issue is that after the link at the top of the page is clicked, I attempt to add entities, and then I go back to the original page, the link that should trigger the popup doesn't work anymore.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p>I'm running Arch Linux on a raspberry pi and I want a quite fast loaded gui for my project. I have decided to go with tkinter. I have installed xorg and some other needed xorg packages, and when I run ""startx"" I get three windows and a litte clock with some green/blue colored borders and i can move the widows with drag and drop. If I run my tkinter py-file from any window it works just fine. </p>

<p>I came over the ""xinit"" command and this loads a little faster and just gives me one window without borders. This actually suits me better since my ""base window"" will work as some kind of desktop and from here I will pop up other windows. Since there's no borders or title bars on the windows, they are not moveable. Is there any way to achieve this? That is, I want just some windows to have a border and a title bar. </p>

<p>And; how can I run the tkinter py-file automatically when I run the xinit/startx? I have tried the other approach by run the xinit/startx in the pyfile, but this does not work. I guess this will be called as some kind of sub command in another thread, or something? Any suggestions how I do this?</p>

That means that theoretically the threads I create in <code>someMethod()</code> are not collected until <code>someMethod()</code> ends. If we assume the while loop runs for a very long time, the application would run out of memory and crash.</p>

<a href=""http://jqeedu.tuxfamily.org/pmr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqeedu.tuxfamily.org/pmr/</a></p>

<p>After opening the landing, click on <code>post your apartment</code>, a form is loaded via ajax, and the page automatically scrolls to the bottom and if you scroll up, it returns to the bottom again!</p>

<p>What is causing this?</p>

<p>Edit:<br>
Sorry about this but I waited a few hours and then as it had to be fixed started experimenting with it and changed several things and ultimately fixed the issue. What I learned during the process is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>I had an zero-width-and-height <code>iframe</code> on the page which served as the <code>target</code> for upload form, so that we could upload photos without page refresh. This <code>iframe</code> was the last element in the <code>body</code>. When I changed its place to top, the scrolling changed from insisting on the bottom position to insisting on page top position. Now the page wouldn't allow you to scroll down the page!</li>
<li>That was good news, because now I knew whatever it was, it was caused by the <code>iframe</code>. The <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>iframe</code> was set to <code>#</code>; I suspected this, and changed it to point to a real file (a blank html frame), made the file and the problem disappeared!</li>
</ol>

<p>So, my analysis is this: The browser gets stuck on <code>loading</code> the file into the <code>iframe</code> and the process responsible for <code>loading</code> the content is left running. This process somehow does not let us scroll to an area where the <code>iframe</code> would go out of the <code>viewport</code>. This is a misbehavior of <code>webkit</code> engine and browsers built with <code>webkit</code> demonstrate this issue.</p>

<p>Finally, this is the snippet below shows the code of the <code>iframe</code> before and after the change, and the content of the new target file.</p>

<p>Buggy:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;iframe id=""control_target"" name=""control_target"" src=""#""
 style=""width:0;height:0;border:0px solid #fff;""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Good:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;iframe id=""control_target"" name=""control_target"" src=""blank.html"" 
style=""width:0;height:0;border:0px solid #fff;""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>blank.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I do not like to mark my own answer as accepted answer, so I put this in the body of the question, I wait for someone to explain a bit more about the nature of this issue or provide a better analysis. If such answer is provided, I'll mark it as the accepted answer.</p>

<p>Here is my problem: when I start typing something, when the time comes to cout the int value, my input gets erased from the input field, and put into the console with the int value. So when I want to type in ""hello"" it looks something like this:</p>

I have searched around on the interweb, and found a reference to a class called <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/undo/UndoManager.html"" rel=""nofollow"">UndoManager</a>. I have no idea how to apply it to a graphics object, though (given my condition).</p>

<p>I can still store the co-ords, but that is useless to me as I draw them on directly, unless anyone could think of a way to overlay a black colored line w/ a transparent one to replace it (Currently, for that purpose I use BufferedImage.setRGB(x,y,color), but that only helps when the shape I want to replace is a circle (x^2 + y^2 = r^2) or rectangle).</p>

<p>To clarify, I'm looking for semantics like ArrayList in Java or C#, i.e some abstract container that I can put things into and will grow if needed, but generaly remain the same ""object"" (i.e if passed around etc).</p>

To be simple : I have a datagrid which is bound on a list of object, and SelectedItem property of my Datagrid is bound to an instance of my object's type.</p>

<p>When I open my edit window from datagrid, I pass the SelectedItem as parameter (which is object, so a reference to my object). In my edit window, I make a clone of my object by creating a new instance and copy every properties of my source object in this clone (value type and struct are duplicated, string are copied with String.Copy, no object as properties) and save the item as class properties. Some my class have two instance of object, one is DataSource, the working one, bind to all my edit window controls, and one is Backup, the original object clone.</p>

<p>If the user click cancel, before closing my form, I just copy backupItem created in original item properties.</p>

<pre><code>DataSource = Backup;
</code></pre>

<p>Because every object in C# is reference, it should work, BUT it doesn't, and I don't see why.</p>

<p>Some code to be more clear :</p>

<p>DataGrid Declaration :</p>

              BorderThickness=""1""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Clone method :</p>

<pre><code>RSSItem oClone = new RSSItem();
        oClone.Author = this.Author.Copy();
        oClone.Category = this.Category.Copy();
        oClone.Content = this.Content.Copy();
        oClone.CreateDate = this.CreateDate;
        oClone.CreateUser = this.CreateUser;
        oClone.Disabled = this.Disabled;
        oClone.EditDate = this.EditDate;
        oClone.EditUser = this.EditUser;
        oClone.FEEDLIST_RecordID = this.FEEDLIST_RecordID.Copy();
        oClone.Filter = this.Filter.Copy();
        oClone.Important = this.Important;
        oClone.Link = this.Link.Copy();

<p>I've encountered this practice in a recent project - almost every procedure and function is wrapped into try/except clause like so:</p>

<pre><code>function TMyClass.DoFoo(aBar: Integer): Boolean;
begin
  try
    .. do something .. // Proper checks for common errors inside
    Result := True;
  except
    LogException(ClassName + '.DoFoo'); // Write exception to log
    Result := False; // Indicate function did not performed what it was asked for
    // Exit without re-raising exception
  end;
end;

procedure TMyClass.Buzz(Sender: TObject);
begin
  try
    .. do something .. // Proper checks for common errors inside
  except
    LogException(ClassName + '.DoFoo'); // Write exception to log
    // Exit without re-raising exception
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This looks like a lot of repetition. However I can see some kind of logic behind it. If you wrap every procedure and function into <code>try..except</code> you would know approximate location of the exception and let the program continue working without popping crash messages at the user, but write them to a log for future analysis.</p>

<p>However this practice is considered to be evil. Why exactly is that?</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<ul>
<li>This is a question about project I'm going to work with, I did not invented it myself</li>
<li>I'm well aware about madExcept and I use it in other projects</li>
<li>Functions and procedures in that project are layed out as usual, there are no signs of procedures being written as functions for sole purpose of <em>replacing</em> exceptions flow</li>

<p>I've found that we're having problem seeing locked files in Subclise if the file isn't configured with ""svn:needs-lock"".</p>

<p>If a file has ""svn:needs-lock"" then the Navigator pane clearly shows whether you have a lock or if you don't have a lock in the file icon.
If a file does not have ""svn:needs-lock"" then the Navigator pane shows the same icon for both locked and unlocked files.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way to change this (either in Subclipse or by using a new plugin?)</p>

<p>Anyone can help me?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p><strong>------------ SOLUTION ------------</strong></p>

<p>It was not a DB problem. It was just an HTML problem, because the <code>value</code> element inside the input named <code>upload_image</code> was setted on <code>""""</code>. So change the code, inside the form in the <code>function.php</code> file, from:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""upload_image"" type=""text"" size=""36"" name=""upload_image"" value="""" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""upload_image"" type=""text"" size=""36"" name=""upload_image"" value=""&lt;?php echo esc_html( stripslashes( $options[""upload_image""] ) ); ?&gt;"" /&gt;

<p>Chatrooms (Mongo)</p>

<li>_id: ObjectId</li>
<li>name: string</li>
<li>users: array</li>

<p>With redis I need something abit more complex</p>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>chatrooms:&lt;&lt;id&gt;&gt;:users</code> to store the set of users</li>
</ul>

<p>To retrieve chatroom details for mongo is straightforward, with mongo I need to incur 2 queries in this case. In a more complex use case, maybe more</p>

<p>So I wonder from a performance point of view, which is more efficient? From a development point of view, definitely, its simpler to use Mongo for example. </p>

<p>I have coredata entities - 'Project' and 'Drawing'.  A Project has many Drawings. The relationship is One-to-Many and Ordered, hence my Project object contains an NSOrderedSet of Drawings.</p>

<p>My app is single-threaded and is causing me headaches if wish I re-order my Drawing objects.</p>

<p>I re-order the Drawings with the following code...</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)onTestReOrder:(id)sender
{
    NSMutableOrderedSet *exchange = [self.currentProject.drawings mutableCopy];
    [exchange exchangeObjectAtIndex:0 withObjectAtIndex:1];
    self.currentProject.drawings = exchange;

    // Save
    id delegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication]delegate];
    NSManagedObjectContext *managedObjectContext = [delegate managedObjectContext];
    NSError *error = nil;

    if( ![managedObjectContext save:&amp;error] )
    {
        NSLog(@""%@ Save: Unresolved Error on Save %@, %@"", methodName, error, [error userInfo] );
        abort();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This all seems to work well. My underlying Sqlite datastore appears to be updated to reflect the re-order.</p>

<p>My problem arises when I try to write a change to a property within my Drawing after the re-order. For instance...</p>

<pre><code>drawing = [self.currentProject.drawings objectAtIndex:1];
drawing.current = [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES];

// Save....causes NSMergeConflict
id delegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication]delegate];
NSManagedObjectContext *managedObjectContext = [delegate managedObjectContext];
NSError *error = nil;

// BANG ON SAVE....NSMergeConflict
if( ![managedObjectContext save:&amp;error] )
{
    NSLog(@""%@ Save: Unresolved Error on Save %@, %@"", methodName, error, [error userInfo] );
    abort();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Save call here creates an NSMergeConflict. Looking at the snapshots, it seems the Drawing's Project is different between Old and New but this is a single-threaded app and only one ManagedObjectContext. How can I have different references to the 'Project'?</p>

<p>I'm pulling my hair on this one and any hints to help me resolve the NSMergeConflict are greatly appreciated.</p>

The circle diameter is the square's  width, their centers are the same, and the circle is on top of the square.  How do I set things up such that if I trigger any event on layer1 the same even will be executed at the same location in layer2.  So in this case if I click on the circle, the square's click event will also be triggered.  Of course, this doesn't mean I simply want to hook up the circle's events to the square's, but rather I basically want the events to be triggered on both layers.</p>

<p>I'm reading an XML file into a GUI form, where certain elements are paths to files that are entered into TextBox objects.  I'm looping through the controls on the form, and for each file path in each TextBox (lol there's like 20 of them on this form), I want to use File.Exists() to ensure it's a valid file.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that the file path can potentially contain spaces, and can potentially be valid; however File.Exists() is telling me it's invalid, based entirely on the spaces.  Obviously I can't hard-code them and do something like</p>

<p><code>if (File.Exists(@""c:\Path To Stuff""))</code></p>

<p>and I tried surrounding the path with "", like</p>

<p><code>if (File.Exists(""\"""" + contentsOfTextBox + ""\""""))</code></p>

<p>but that didn't make a difference.  Is there some way to do this?  Can I escape the spaces somehow?</p>

This is a bit of a loaded question, and I'm not sure where to begin. I was wondering if someone could clarify the following details.</p>

<p>First, my setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have installed node locally with a non-sudo user because running node with admin is a bad idea:</p>

<pre><code>/home/appuser
    |--- nodejs/               # node install
            |--- bin/
            |--- include/
            |--- lib/
            |--- share/

    |--- app/
            |--- node_modules/
            |--- public/        # holds html templates, static files , uploaded files
            |--- core/          # holds main app js files
            |--- app.js         # Main Nodejs program
            |--- config.js      # Configuration that holds authentication details, other config stuff
            |--- package.json
</code></pre>

<p>I can run the application using <code>PM2</code> by doing <code>pm2 start app.js</code>.</p>

<p>My <code>nginx</code> configuration:</p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;

    server_name mydomainname.com;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>My concerns are:</p>

<p><strong>(1) APPLICATION</strong> - Should the main <code>app/</code> live inside <code>/home/appuser</code>?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any danger in having my app files live inside my non-sudo user home? If so, where should my app files live?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm wondering if <code>public/</code> should be in a different place and not live in the same folder as the application files. I wouldn't want the application source files to leak out, especially my <code>config.js</code> which holds some sensitive information like my database auth details and email auth details.</p>

<p>If it should be moved, where <code>/public</code> live relative to <code>app/</code>?</p></li>
<li><p>Right now permissions on <code>app/</code> are <code>chown -R appuser:appuser app/</code>, so that user owns all the files. Are there other permissions I should set on my application folder?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(2) PM2</strong> - Since I installed nodejs and its modules locally, how would I safely get <code>pm2</code> to restart my nodejs app after a server restart?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My understanding is that <code>pm2-init.sh</code> will live in <code>/etc/init.d/</code>, and this happens automatically if I had installed <code>pm2</code> globally with sudo. </p>

<p>How should I get <code>pm2</code> to restart my app safely using my non-sudo user?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(3) NGINX</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How can I safely serve <code>public/</code> through <code>nginx</code> if they are served like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://mydomainname.com/public
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>My app handles routes and should throw <code>404</code> if a route is not found. But is it possible for someone to work around that and maliciously make my app or <code>nginx</code> browse other directories? </p>

<p>ie, outside of app directory</p>

<pre><code>http://mydomainname.com/../../etc/path/to/secrets
</code></pre>

<p>I can return the second dataset using Lookup/LookupSet however I am using this data in a bar chart so (somehow) need both sets of data to display on it. If I was using a tablix I would be able to ""hack"" it by putting a second tablix without headers underneath the main tablix and show it like that. Unfortunately being a graph I cannot do this.</p>

<p>I also tried running it as one dataset, returning all values and then running ""filters"" based on category groups in the chart however for whatever reason [bug in SSRS?] the filter on these filters the whole result set, not just the one category group.</p>

There is also a secondary timer in the child that prevents it from running for too long in the background, like so:</p>

<pre><code>Fork execution
In the fork's child:
    Start a thread to execute a task
        If that thread runs for longer than X milliseconds:
             thread.stop(), a custom method that softly stops the thread.
In the fork's parent:
    If the child's PID stays running for longer than Y milliseconds:
        return -1
    else:
        return 0
</code></pre>

<p>After returning a value, I want the script to terminate. The child can and should keep running if it isn't done.</p>

<p>The code I have tried (abbreviated) is:</p>

<pre><code>class MyCustomThread(threading.Thread):
    abort = False
    def run(self):
        counter = 0
        while True:
            if self.abort: break
            counter += 1
            if counter == 30: self.stop()
            sleep(1)
        return 0

    def stop(self):
        self.abort = True

def test():
    X = 2000
    Y = 500
    pid = os.fork()
    if pid == 0:
        thread1 = MyCustomThread() #Sleeps for 30 seconds and ends.
        thread1.start()
        print ""Started 1!""
        timeout = X # say, 1000ms
        while timeout &gt; 0:
            if not thread1.is_alive(): return ""custom thread finished before the deadline!""
            timeout -= 1
            sleep(0.001)
        if thread1.is_alive():
            return ""custom thread didn't finish before the deadline!""
            thread1.stop()
        exit()
    else:
        print pid
        thread2 = Thread(target = os.waitpid, args = (pid, 0))
        thread2.start()
        print ""Started 2!""
        timeout2 = Y # say, 500ms
        while timeout2 &gt; 0:
            if not thread2.is_alive(): return ""child PID finished!""
            timeout2 -= 1
            sleep(0.001)
        if thread2.is_alive():
            return ""child PID didn't finish yet!""
print test()
print ""all done!""
</code></pre>

<p>The output is correct, in that I get </p>

<pre><code>1171
Started 2!
Started 1!
child PID didn't finish yet!
all done!
custom thread didn't finish before the deadline!
all done!
</code></pre>

<p>But then the script doesn't exit! It sleeps for the remaining 28 seconds before  </p>

<p><strong>How do I make the main execution of this script complete after the <code>fork</code>ed parent returns a value?</strong> As I said before, the child can and should keep running in the background, it just shouldn't block execution of the next task on the parent. </p>

<p>I really don't even care if the child can print output to standard out--in the actual implementation, all it's doing is talking to a database, so it doesn't need to report anything interactively. The parent, however, needs to dispatch the child, wait <strong>at most</strong> Y seconds for the child to finish, and then (as far as whoever invoked the script is concerned) end the script's execution so that the next thing can be done. The other timer (X) isn't relevant, I think; it only exists to keep the child from running too long in the background.</p>

<p>Any ideas? I'm probably approaching this totally wrong, so ""start over and do it <em>_</em> way"" ideas are welcome.</p>

<p><a href=""http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/19/exceptions.html?page=1"">Best Practices for Exception Handling</a></p>

<p>Let's go through the mentioned article:</p>

<p>It states that one should generally avoid using checked exceptions <em>if ""Client code cannot do anything""</em>. But what does it exactly mean? Is displaying error message in GUI sufficient reason for bubbling up checked exception? But it would force GUI programmer to remember to catch RuntimeExceptions and their descendants to display potential error info.</p>

<p>Second view presented in this article is that one should evade inventing own exception classes unless I want to implement some customs field/methods in them. 
I generally disagree with this, my practice up today was just the opposite: I wrapped exceptions in my own exception structure to reflex goals realized by classes I write, even if they just extend Exception without adding any new methods. I think it helps to handle them more flexibly in the higher layers when thrown plus it's generally more clear and comprehensible for programmer who will use these classes.</p>

<p>I implemented some code today 'new way' presented in the article throwing RuntimeException here and there, then I let <a href=""http://www.sonarsource.org/"">Sonar</a> analyze it. To confuse me even more Sonar marked my RuntimeExceptions as Major errors with a message like <em>""Avoid throwing root type exceptions, wrap'em in your own types"".</em></p>

<p>So it looks quite controversional, what do you think?</p>

<p>I also heard from one of tech-leads today that just wrapping exceptions is bad, 'because it's a really costly operation for JVM'. For me, on the other side throwing SQLExceptions or IOExceptions everywhere looks like a bit of breaking encapsulation..</p>

<p><strong>So what is your general attitude to questions I presented here?</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>When to wrap exceptions in my own types, when I shouldn't do this?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Where is that point of <em>'client cannot do anything about this, throw
runtime exception?</strong>'</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What about performance issues?</strong></p></li>

Currently I'm working on creating a networking port for the Java DataOutputStream class in C#. The last thing I have to do is fix this issue with sending segmented information.</p>

<p>Here's my <strong>WriteInt</strong> method in C# (<strong>ClientOutput is an instance of BinaryWriter</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>public void WriteInt(int v)
{
    ClientOutput.Write (((uint)v &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF);
    ClientOutput.Write (((uint)v &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF);
    ClientOutput.Write (((uint)v &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF);
    ClientOutput.Write (((uint)v &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 0xFF);
    IncCount (4);
}
</code></pre>

<p>For anyone who wants to compare; here's the original in <strong>Java</strong></p>

<pre><code>public final void writeInt(int v) throws IOException {
       out.write((v &gt;&gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF);
       out.write((v &gt;&gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF);
       out.write((v &gt;&gt;&gt;  8) &amp; 0xFF);
       out.write((v &gt;&gt;&gt;  0) &amp; 0xFF);
       incCount(4);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Normally in java you would have to call ""<strong>Flush()</strong>"" before the data would be sent to the server or client; However it appears that the BinaryWriter automatically flushes whenever you call ""<strong>Write()</strong>""</p>

<p>Here's the ""<strong>ReadInt()</strong>"" code in Java.</p>

<pre><code>public final int readInt() throws IOException {
        int ch1 = in.read();
        int ch2 = in.read();
        int ch3 = in.read();
        int ch4 = in.read();
        if ((ch1 | ch2 | ch3 | ch4) &lt; 0)
            throw new EOFException();
        return ((ch1 &lt;&lt; 24) + (ch2 &lt;&lt; 16) + (ch3 &lt;&lt; 8) + (ch4 &lt;&lt; 0));
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the Java code is executed to ""<strong>WriteInt</strong>"" and <strong>ReadInt</strong> is called on the server, the value is displayed properly; However currently the server is processing the integer 4 different times and displaying an integer value based on the segments.</p>

<p>Example Input (<strong>C#</strong>): </p>

The server is for the enterprise and resides in the customer internal network.
Each customer has obviously a different IP address assigned to the server.
This is an off the shelf product, meaning we don't build it per customer.
The client need the server IP in order to connect and start working.</p>

<p>Currently the client ask the user for the server IP, but the users usually don't know it.</p>

<p>I am looking for an easy way to be able to configure the client with a different server IP address per costumer.</p>

<p>We are deploying the client from the costumer internal web server (no market).
Is there a way for the client to know where was it downloaded from? than i can use this IP?
Is there a way for the client to know the apk name that was used to start the installation process? than i can rename the apk name to include the server IP.</p>

<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

What I want to do is when someone changes the first select area, the second is autopopulated, and the third is also autopopulated based on the first option in the second box.</p>

<p>Here is the code I'm using so far:</p>

<pre>function loadTypes(sel)
{
    var whichCurr = sel.options[sel.selectedIndex].value;
    if(whichCurr.length>0){
        var theIndex2 = newAjax2.length;
        newAjax2[theIndex2] = new sack();

        newAjax2[theIndex2].requestFile = 'getTypes.php?theType='+whichCurr;    // Specifying which file to get
        newAjax2[theIndex2].onCompletion = function(){ createTypes(theIndex2) };    // Specify function that will be executed after file has been found
        newAjax2[theIndex2].runAJAX();      // Execute AJAX function

    }


}


function createTypes(theIndex2)
{
    var obj3 = document.getElementById('types');
        document.getElementById('types').options.length = 0;    // Empty city select box
        eval(newAjax2[theIndex2].response); // Executing the response from Ajax as Javascript code
            getModelList('types');

}
</pre>

<p>You'll notice at the end of createTypes, the function calls getModelList() which is the function that is called when the SECOND select box is called.  It (getModelList()) works fine when manually changing the second box, but when I try to call it from createTypes, it just won't work.  Here's the code for getModelList:</p>

<pre>
function getModelList(sel)
{
    var manuCode = sel.options[sel.selectedIndex].value;
        var mytext = manuCode.length;
    if(manuCode.length>0){
        var index = ajax.length;
        ajax[index] = new sack();
        ajax[index].requestFile = 'getModels.php?manuCode='+manuCode;   // Specifying which file to get
        ajax[index].onCompletion = function(){ createModelList(index) };    // Specify function that will be executed after file has been found
        ajax[index].runAJAX();      // Execute AJAX function

    } 
}

function createModelList(index)
{
    var obj = document.getElementById('sub_types');
        $numOpts=(document.getElementById('sub_types').length);
        if($numOpts>1){
            document.getElementById('sub_types').options.length = 0;    // Empty select box
            eval(ajax[index].response); // Executing the response from Ajax as Javascript code
            $num_of_entries=(document.getElementById('sub_types').length);
            if($num_of_entries>1){

            }
            else
            {
                hidediv('p_sub_types');
            }

        }
        else
        {
            document.getElementById('sub_types').options.length = 0;    // Empty select box
            eval(ajax[index].response); // Executing the response from Ajax as Javascript code
            $num_of_entries=(document.getElementById('sub_types').length);
            if($num_of_entries>1){
                showdiv('p_sub_types');
            }
            else
            {

            }


        }
}
</pre>

<p>Again, everything works fine when MANUALLY changing the select box.  But when I try to automatically call getModelList() from createTypes() I get an error in Firebug saying: sel.selectedIndex is undefined.</p>

<p>So I'm guessing that it is trying to call that before the select box has been populated... however, I tried adding a pause (of up to 2 seconds!) before calling the function and the same thing happens.</p>

<p>I'm very very novice with JS so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

The key is <code>employee number</code>, and value is an object with <code>employee information</code>, and the <code>location</code> field in the value is <strong>unique</strong>, for example,</p>

<pre><code>mapA = {12: {name: 'John Ma', location: 'US'}, 25: {name: 'Richard Yan', location: 'Eng'}, ...}
</code></pre>

<p>Also there is another map, the key is <code>location</code>, and value is another objects with something else. such as,</p>

<pre><code>mapB = {'US': objectS1, 'Eng': objectS2, ...}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to build one map between <code>employee number</code> and <code>objectS</code> which name is mapC. </p>

<pre><code>mapC = {12: objectS1, 25: objectS2 ...}
</code></pre>

<p>I must find the location in the object of mapA, then get the key which points to this object. Then use this key and objectS in mapB to build the new mapC. In this way, the time complexity is O(N^2).</p>

<p>To reduce time complexity, first I build mapD which key is <code>location</code> and value is <code>employee number</code> through traversing mapA, then I can get mapC easily. </p>

<p><strong>Is there any better solution for that question?</strong></p>

<p>BTW, another question come into my mind: <strong>what's best data structure for primary key and secondary key in database?</strong></p>

<p>For example, here is one table,</p>

<pre><code>| Username  | Password  | Email_Addr |
--------------------------------------
| Username1 | Password1 | Email 1    |
| Username2 | Password2 | Email 2    |
| Username3 | Password1 | Email 3    |
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>username</code> is first primary key and <code>Password</code> is secondary key, what's best data structure to store them to get best performance?</p>

<p>IMO, to simply, combine username and password as one compound key. and we sort those records according to the following compare function,</p>

<pre><code>bool key_compare(string key1, string key2){
    return key1+key2 &gt; key2+key1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and those information are stored in <strong>B_tree</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>
From <a href=""http://courses.cs.vt.edu/cs2604/Summer2000/projects/Indexing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> document, we know, those two indexes can be implemented with <strong>hash table</strong> and <strong>inverted table</strong>. In the table above,
The hash table save the information of <code>Username</code> and the address of each record, </p>

<p><code>{Username1: 'record1 address', Username2: 'record2 address'}</code>
and the inverted table hold the information of <code>Password</code> and record address table.</p>

<p><code>{Password1: ['record1 address', 'record3 address'], Password2: ['record2 address']}</code></p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>
I want to know how database to handle them, for example, MySQL... 
Is there any hashMap beside B_tree? thanks in advance.</p>

There are some alchemy models in my project. I often select them, rarely update. So I have two engines, one to master, other to slave. My model has method save(self, session), which I use to store changes in database. </p>

<p>Other code selects objects from db by primary key, on each pk it checks, if it has mapped objects in cache, if not it selects row from db via s.query method, pickles mapped object and put into cache (memcache in my case, but it doesn't matter). If it is already in cache, just unpickle it from cache, do session.merge and returns.
After each self.save call I invalidate cache for current instance and do one selection, to precache it, so I have always actual objects in cache.</p>

<p>If I didn't do session.merge calls I would have exception on each attribute resolving if I would get object from cache in another process (or in this process after restart):</p>

<pre><code>/var/lib/python-support/python2.5/sqlalchemy/orm/attributes.py in __get__(self, instance, owner)

I want to highlight areas of the photo that are completely burned out (maximum values in all components, pure white) using a color like red, as some digital cameras and image processing apps do, to help the user see whether the image is overexposed, and how badly.</p>

<p>I've been scratching my head as to how to do this.  Options I've considered:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I could probably write a Core Image filter to do it; none of the built-in filters look up to the task.  That seems like overkill, though; I've been reading through the docs, and it looks fairly complicated.  Big learning curve.</p></li>
<li><p>I could scan through the bitmap data for the image and modify it as necessary.  This is easy enough to code for one bitmap format, but the multitude of bitmap formats make it a rather annoying exercise, and speed is important here, so writing general-purpose code that renders the image up to some maximal common format and works on that bitmap would be too big a speed penalty.</p></li>
<li><p>As it happens, I am already scanning through images (handling all the different bitmap formats) at an earlier point in the code, to generate histogram data for the images.  I could pretty easily add code at that point that would remember the burned-out pixels for later use.  I'm not quite sure what the best way is to do that, though.  A 1-bit-per-pixel NSBitmapImageRep?  How would I draw it later, making the 1-pixels draw red and the 0-pixels draw transparent, for example?  I don't want to make a 32-bit NSBitmapImageRep with an alpha channel and everything just for this purpose, as memory is not infinite and images are large.  But there must be a way to draw a 1-bit mask in a given color, somehow.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Before forging ahead with one of these approaches, I thought I'd see whether anybody here has a better idea.  Or maybe has implemented the CI filter in question already?  Apart from the learning curve, that seems like the best approach I've thought of so far – no memory overhead, and probably faster than other options, too.</p>

<p>Thanks...</p>

<p>OK, I implemented my own Core Image filter to do this.  Wasn't as hard as I expected, although the documentation is not great for this stuff.  The doc examples all assume you're using ARC, so if you're not, following those examples will give you various retain/release bugs.  There was also a little weirdness with the CIFilterConstructor stuff, which did not quite go as documented.  But overall pretty easy.  CI is cool.  My code is below, for anybody who might find it useful:</p>

<pre>
Header:

    #import 

    @interface SSTintHighlightsFilter : CIFilter
    {
        CIImage *inputImage;
        CIColor *highlightColor;
    }
    @end

Implementation file:

    #import ""SSTintHighlightsFilter.h""

    static CIKernel *tintHighlightsFilter = nil;

    @implementation SSTintHighlightsFilter

    + (void)initialize
    {
        [CIFilter registerFilterName:@""SSTintHighlightsFilter"" constructor:(id )self
                     classAttributes:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@""Tint Highlights"", kCIAttributeFilterDisplayName, [NSArray arrayWithObjects:kCICategoryColorAdjustment, kCICategoryStillImage, nil], kCIAttributeFilterCategories, nil]];
    }

    + (CIFilter *)filterWithName:(NSString *)name
    {
        CIFilter *filter = [[self alloc] init];

        return [filter autorelease];
    }

    - (id)init
    {
        if (!tintHighlightsFilter)
        {
            NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]];
            NSString *code = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:[bundle pathForResource:@""tintHighlightsAndShadows"" ofType:@""cikernel""] encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding error:NULL];
            NSArray *kernels = [CIKernel kernelsWithString:code];

            tintHighlightsFilter = [[kernels objectAtIndex:0] retain];
        }

        return [super init];
    }

    - (NSDictionary *)customAttributes
    {
        NSDictionary *attrs = @{
              @""highlightColor"" : @{ kCIAttributeClass : [CIColor class], kCIAttributeType : kCIAttributeTypeOpaqueColor }
        };

        return attrs;
    }

    - (CIImage *)outputImage
    {
        CISampler *src = [CISampler samplerWithImage:inputImage];

        return [self apply:tintHighlightsFilter
                 arguments:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:src, highlightColor, nil]
                   options:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[src definition], kCIApplyOptionDefinition, nil]];
    }

    @end

tintHighlights.cikernel:

    kernel vec4 tintHighlights(sampler inputImage, __color highlightColor)
    {
        vec4 originalColor, tintedColor;
        float sum;

        // fetch the source pixel
        originalColor = sample(inputImage, samplerCoord(inputImage));

        // calculate the color component sum as a way of testing whether we are black or white
        sum = originalColor.r + originalColor.g + originalColor.b;

        // replace pixels that are white with the highlight color
        tintedColor = (sum > 2.99999999999999999999999) ? highlightColor : originalColor;

        // preserve alpha
        tintedColor.a = originalColor.a;

        return tintedColor;
    }

using the filter:

    + (NSImage *)showHighlightsInImage:(NSImage *)img dstRect:(NSRect)dstRect
    {
        NSGraphicsContext *currentContext = [NSGraphicsContext currentContext];
        NSRect dstRectForCGImage = dstRect;     // because the method below wants a pointer, and I don't trust it not to modify my rect...
        CGImageRef cgImage = [img CGImageForProposedRect:&dstRectForCGImage context:currentContext hints:nil];
        CIImage *inputImage = [[CIImage alloc] initWithCGImage:cgImage];

        [SSTintHighlightsFilter class];     // get my filter initialized

        CIFilter *highlightFilter = [CIFilter filterWithName:@""SSTintHighlightsFilter""];

        [highlightFilter setValue:inputImage forKey:@""inputImage""];
        [highlightFilter setValue:[CIColor colorWithRed:1.0 green:0.0 blue:0.0] forKey: @""highlightColor""];
        [inputImage release];

        CIImage *outputImage = [highlightFilter valueForKey:@""outputImage""];

        NSImage *resultImage = [[NSImage alloc] initWithSize:[img size]];
        [resultImage addRepresentation:[NSCIImageRep imageRepWithCIImage:outputImage]];

        return [resultImage autorelease];
    }

</pre>

<p>I'm not sure that I'm handling the alpha entirely robustly, with premultiplication issues and so forth, but apart from that possible glitch it is working great.</p>

<p><code>f4</code> is <strong>faster</strong> by a <strong>factor 2</strong> than the rest. However when I go to <code>x.^6</code> there is very little difference between  <code>(x.*x.*x).^2</code> and <code>x.*x.*x.*x.*x.*x</code> (while all other options are slower).</p>

<p>Is there away to tell what will be the most efficient way to take a power of a vector?
Can you explain why there is such a big difference in performance?</p>

<p>I was playing around with some code that re-hydrates POCO's. </p>

<p>The code iterates around rows returned from a SqlDataReader and and uses reflection to assign properties from column values.  Down my call stack I had a code a line like this :-</p>

<pre><code>poco.Set(""Surname"", ""Smith""); // uses extension method ...
</code></pre>

<p>The Set method was written as an extension method.</p>

<p>It would be great to have been able to write code like this</p>

<pre><code>poco[""Surname""] = ""Smith"";  // extension methods for indexers ?
</code></pre>

<p>ie I wanted to write an extension method for indexer</p>

<p>Are there good reason why .Net does not have extension methods for indexers?
Do other people have other good uses for extension method indexers ?</p>

<p>as an aside ...
If we could write extension methods for indexers then we could write code like this …</p>

    poco.Surname = “Smith”; // is this JavaScript ...
    poco[Surname] = “Smith” ; // … or is this c# or both

<p>I am having difficulty converting a column of data in a Pandas dataframe, loaded from an hdf5 file, to a datetime object.  The data is too large to work with has a text file, so I converted it to an hdf5 file using the following code:</p>

<pre><code># get text file from zip file and unzip
file = urllib.request.urlretrieve(file, dir)           
z = zipfile.ZipFile(dir)             
data = z.open(z.namelist()[0])

# column names from text file
colnames = ['Patent#','App#','Small','Filing Date','Issue Date', 'Event Date', 'Event Code'] 

# load the data in chunks and concat into single DataFrame        
mfees = pd.read_table(data, index_col=0, sep='\s+', header = None, names = colnames, chunksize=1000, iterator=True)
df = pd.concat([chunk for chunk in mfees], ignore_index=False)

# close files        
z.close()
data.close()

# convert to hdf5 file
data = data.to_hdf('mfees.h5','raw_data',format='table')
</code></pre>

<p>After this my data is in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>data['Filing Date']

<p>I want to know :<br/></p>

<p>1) How the portlet is adhering to JSR specifications?<br/></p>

<p>2) What are the major dependency (technology wise) without which the porlet cannot be migrated? <br/></p>

<p>or whether liferay offers an alternative or a bridge to do so<br/></p>

<p>or what's the equialent for websphere 6.1(JSR 286) in liferay? <br/></p>

<p>Please help!!                </p>

<p>private function firstOver(e:MouseEvent):void { rotate1=true;}<br>
private function onEnter(e:Event):void {if (rotate1){ this.doRotate(1); } }  </p>

<p>This will rotate the carousel as an infinite loop. However - I need the function to stop at a certain angle e.g. 45% (and/or reset itself to 0%). Another option would be to stop the carousel at a certain thumbnail container or frame.</p>

<p>I have a Neighbour class. In another class, I instantiate 3 separate instances of the Neighbour class, stored into an array (collisionArray_Neighbour). There is a function (randomisePosition) in Neighbour class.</p>

<p>The problem is: the randomisePosition() function is only called by one Neighbour instance. Even though I iterate through the instances with an array, to call the Neighbour update() function on each. This update function calls the randomisePosition() function.</p>

<p>It may be due to the arrays, as if I remove an the one instance calling randomisePosition() from the array, by colliding with an instance in-game, another instance, but still only one out of the array, calls the function randomisePosition.</p>

<p>This is the code that adds the instances to an array:</p>

<pre><code>public function populateNeighbourCollisionArray()
{
    for (var iN:int = 0; iN &lt; enemyMaxAmount; iN++)
    {
        if (collisionArray_Neighbour.length &lt; 3)
        {
            collisionArray_Neighbour.push(new Neighbour(this));
            level01.addChild(collisionArray_Neighbour[collisionArray_Neighbour.length - 1]);        
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This calls the update function for each instance:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; collisionArray_Neighbour.length; i++)
{
    collisionArray_Neighbour[i].update();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The update function in Neighbour class:</p>

<pre><code>public function update()
{
    if (animationComplete)
    {
        trace(""randomise position..."");
        randomisePosition();
        gotoAndPlay(""startFading"");
        //startTimer();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>randomisePosition function that seems to be only called on one Neighbour instance:</p>

<pre><code>private function randomisePosition()
{
    trace(""position randomised"");
    var randomX = Math.ceil(randomRange(0, 100));
    var randomY = Math.ceil(randomRange(50, 400));
    this.x = parentClassRef.player.x + randomX;
    this.y = randomY;

I am connecting successfully, and am able to (for example) create directories. However, I can't seem to write files to the folders! When I look at the directory permissions using an FTP client, I noticed that they are all 0000, and cannot be changed. Apparently, Windows-based servers do not use the same FTP permission system.</p>

<p>So... what's up? What do you recommend? I am able to upload files to the directory using an FTP client, but when I attempt to write files with PHP, nothing happens.</p>

<p>I am at a complete loss as to why this may be occurring. I have confirmed my script works by writing to UNIX-based servers, so that is not a problem. Is it possible that the fact the destination server does not have PHP installed matters? I would not think so, but I'm open to any ideas at this point!</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> - What's really getting me is that I AM able to create directories, so it doesn't make any sense that writing shouldn't be working. On Windows servers, is there some setting that would prevent just the writing of FILES, but not folders?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong> - More research has told me that, though you cannot CHMOD on Windows servers, PHP's CHMOD still somehow does something with the permissions. However, this does not appear to be working for me. Is there a way to change the permissions directly with PHP code, or is this something that has to be done directly on the server, outside of my reach?</p>

<p>I have following issue: I'm parsing file which contains sets which contains atoms (smallest unbreakable information). Basically represented by:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>class Atom {
    // Some data
    virtual void Hash(const char *dst); // Calculates checksum of data contained

    int Load(std::istream &amp;stream) {} // Do stuff

};

class Set {
    std::vector&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;Atom&gt;&gt; atoms;

    // Creates multiple atoms based on data in istream
    int Load(std::istream &amp;stream)
    {
         while(/*...*/){
             Atom *atom = new Atom(); // Here's the problematic line
                                      // And I'd like to replace it by factory.Create()
             atom-&gt;Load(istream);
             atoms.push_pack(std::shared_ptr&lt;Atom&gt;(atom));
         }
    }
};

class File {
    std::vector&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;Set&gt;&gt; sets;

    // Loads multiple Sets from istream
    int Load(std::istream &amp;stream)
    {
         while(/*...*/){
             Set *set = new Set();
             set-&gt;Load(istream);
             sets.push_pack(std::shared_ptr&lt;Sets&gt;(set));
         }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>There are several other classes which are not important. The problem is that I have many different types of atoms (mostly differ in what type of hash they use to generate checksum), co I've got something like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>class AtomMd5 : public Atom {
   virtual void Hash(const char *dst) {md5(dst, data); }
};

class AtomSha1 : public Atom { /* . . . */ };
class AtomSha256 : public Atom { /* . . . */ };
/* . . . */
</code></pre>

<p>And user chooses which <em>Atom type</em> should be used trough whole application. <em>Atom type</em> is set once and is never changed.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Factory pattern</h2>

<p>I've decided to solve this using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_pattern"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Factory pattern</em></a> and I'm stuck with it. I want all instances of all classes be aware of which factory is in use, so I've came up with following ideas and I don't really like any of them:</p>

<h3>Singleton</h3>

<p>This just came to mind and I've killed this idea very quickly. The resulting product is a library which can be used by many threads by one application with different settings. I'd like to use dependency injection.</p>

<p>Neither <strong>using templates</strong> like <code>Set&lt;class Factory&gt;</code> and <code>File&lt;class Factory&gt;</code> is an option... Some new Atom implementations may come from user (outside library) in the future.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Implementation that would work in php/python, but won't work in C++</h3>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>class AtomFactory {
    virtual Atom *Create() {return new Atom(); }
};

class AtomMd5Factory {
    virtual Atom *Create() {return static_cast&lt;Atom*&gt;(new AtomMd5()); }

<h3>Implementation using <code>new</code></h3>

<p><em>This is the first one I've considered for real application</em> and it's basically the same as previous one except <code>*</code>: </p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>AtomFactory *Set::factory; // Added to class
Set::Set(AtomFactory *factory)
{
    factory-&gt;Create(); // This would work
    this-&gt;factory = factory; // This would too
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm not a fan of untraced references to objects on heap and this whole implementation screams for invalid pointer or memory leak.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Implementation using <code>std::shared_ptr</code></h3>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>std::shared_ptr&lt;AtomFactory&gt; Set::factory; // Added to class
Set::Set(std::shared_ptr&lt;AtomFactory&gt; &amp;factory)
{
    factory-&gt;Create(); // This would work
    this-&gt;factory = factory; // This would too
}
</code></pre>

<p>But isn't this much overhead? I don't know, it feels like overkill to me.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Container containing just function pointer:</h3>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>class AtomFactory {
    typedef Atom *(*Callback) ();
    Atom* Create() { return callback(); }

    Callback callback;
};

AtomFactory Set::factory; // Added to class
Set::Set(AtomFactory &amp;factory)
{
    factory.Create(); // This would work
    this-&gt;factory = factory; // This would also work
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a Array of objects from which I display data using ng repeat.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;div ng-repeat=""computer in workbench.computers | orderBy:'computer.benchid'""&gt;
     &lt;computer ng-show=""tab.isSelected({{ computer.computer.benchid }}) || tab.isSelected(0)""&gt;&lt;/computer&gt;

<p>And inside the computer element I have an attribute that is <code>{{ computer.benchid }}</code> which I can display just fine. </p>

<p>Here is the Computer element: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""widget col-lg-4""&gt;
&lt;div class=""widget-head br-green""&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;&lt;i class=""fa fa-desktop""&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;{{ computer.computer.make }} - &lt;/b&gt; {{ computer.computer.benchid }}&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=""widget-foot""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Last updated at...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>My problem is that <code>benchid</code> is an Integer from 1 to 10 and I want change the value to the name of the bench example with pseudocode:
<code>if benchid === 1 show: ""Workbench #1""</code>
How would be the best approach to do it? </p>

<p>Here is my controller: </p>

<pre><code>    app.controller('WorkbenchController', ['$http', function($http){
    var workbenches = this;
    workbenches.computers = [];
    // Request the computers
    // Each of them has an object that has a computer
    $http.get('/api/computer').success(function(data) {
        workbenches.computers = data.computers;
    });
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>The getWorkbenchName() function: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
function getWorkbenchName(workbenchNumber) {
    switch(workbenchNumber) {
        case 1:
            return ""Workbench #1"";

So it goes like this :</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Boss&gt; bossList = new ArrayList&lt;Boss&gt;();
Boss b = null;
for(Employee e : List&lt;Employee&gt; myList){
    b = new Boss();
    b.setEmployee(e);
    bossList.add(b);
    b = null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So in above scenario, I am creating lot of Boss objects and then de-referencing them(I know I don't need to write ""b = null"", but i did it for clarity of my question). In normal scenario, I would have marked them to garbage collection, by doeing this, but because in this scenario, I am adding those Boss objects in List collection, are they marked for GC or not? If not then why? And how does List collection work internally to hold references for each Object added, so as to avoid garbage collection?</p>

<pre><code>[EDIT] 
</code></pre>

<p>The scope of question is only limited to the individual Boss objects created in FOR loop, considering that this method returns the reference of the  List to the outside world.</p>

<p>On Linux, you can create a timer that delivers expiration notifications via a file descriptor (see timerfd.h man), so it's great to use it for example with epoll if your application is based on epoll. </p>

<p>On Windows, you can use ""waitable timers"" with an asynchronous procedure call (ACP) (see <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686898(v=VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686898(v=VS.85).aspx</a>)</p>

<p>If you are interested, kqueue (BSD, Mac OS) supports timers by default (see EVFILT_TIMER).</p>

<p>With I/O Completion Ports, we have to use objets that support overlapped I/O. So, is there such a timer for IOCP ?</p>

<p>This is my use case:</p>

<p>I am using JAX-RS (Grizzly) to create a REST API. I have an interface that has many various implementations. My solution should be able to add new implementations at any time. </p>

<p>Based on some form of input, I have to get a hold of one these specific instances. For example, lets say I register two interface implementations with Felix <code>Interface A</code> and <code>Interface B</code>.  A user should be able to ask for <code>Implementation B</code></p>

<p>By using the command line we get from running <code>felix.jar</code>(Apache Felix Gogo ) I have been able to install and start my own bundles. The problem I now face is how I from one of my controllers is supposed to retrieve any of these implementation.</p>

<p>Here is the code for the activator of one of my implementations.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassActivator implements BundleActivator {

@Override
public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
    System.out.println(""Starting ImplementationA"");
    Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt; props = new Hashtable&lt;&gt;();
    props.put(""Identifier"", ""ImplementationA"");

    context.registerService(MyInterface.class.getName(), new MyClassA(), props);
}

@Override
public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
    System.out.println(""Stopping ImplementationA"");

}

private class ImplementationA implements MyInterface { 
     /*my implementation*/ 
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>From one of my JAX-RS classes, I want to, somehow, do this:</p>

<pre><code>MyInterface myclassA = getBundle(""ImplementationA"");
</code></pre>

<p>The String <code>ImplementationA</code> is the same string I placed in the props map.</p>

<p>What I have tried so far is</p>

<pre><code>BundleContext bc = FrameworkUtil.getBundle(MyInterface.class).getBundleContext();
</code></pre>

<p>This however just returns null, it doesn't seem to actually be ""talking"" to my felix instance.</p>

<p>It does make sense to me, but the question I have is, how would you do this with a UISegmentControl that has four views.  I know you can check for the selectedSegment and create that view when needed.  But how would I know what the last view was in order to remove it from the superview beforing adding my new view as a subview?  Thanks!</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why in 1 instance 280MB/s take 34.0% si, but in 2 instance 320MB it increase great to 60.3% si? Soft interrupt maybe the bottleneck, but in my opinion it must be proportional relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Result of 3 instances test seems that multiple instances cannot use more than one physical CPU core (<code>cpu0</code> and <code>cpu1</code> in the same physical core)?</p></li>

<p>Background:
I work on a piece of software that has ~500 users.  A small number (maybe 25?) of these users are running into memory problems when doing multiple large searches.  The application is 32bit and is being run on everything from Win XP machines with 2 gigs of ram (if they are lucky) to users who are running 64bit Windows 7 with 4+ gigs of ram.</p>

<p>My team considered setting LAA after compile using the post build events, but a few of the websites I came across said there could be problems on older systems.  If this information is wrong though and it would work with the old (small amount of ram) machines I wouldn't need the tool.</p>

<p>Thanks all.</p>

<p>If I start and stop it without making any requests to the server, I can start back up on the same port with no problem.</p>

<p>When started, a netstat looks like this:</p>

<pre>
sam@hersheezy:server$ sudo netstat -na --program | grep 8001
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8001            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      23392/python
</pre>

<p>After a request is made, netstat looks like this (even after the request has completed):</p>

<pre>
sam@hersheezy:server$ sudo netstat -na --program | grep 8001
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8001            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      23392/python

</pre>

<p>Then, I kill the server using C-c and netstat looks like this (at this point I cannot restart the server because port is already in use):</p>

<pre>
 sudo netstat -na --program | grep 8001
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8001          127.0.0.1:48674         TIME_WAIT   -

I'm programming a mid-size C++/C program that's highly modularized.  It has a common interface, which allows you to drop in a number of different sources with the same function declarations, but different implementations and get executables with different functionalities.</p>

<p>I'm working out a make system that can handle the building responsibilities.  Currently it's able to grab specialized sources based on contents of a configuration file (for the make process) and dump them in a temporary folder with the proper generic names.  Now, I only have to compile the project.</p>

<p>The problem is I have a variable number of sources and the headers that the sources depend on can change with the individual implementations.  In other words a static makefile won't do the trick.</p>

<p>'1.'
Using the Makefile system alone, is there some way to autogenerate the list of objects (.o) files that Main.cpp needs to compile?</p>

<p>I know I could do this by writing a little python script that my makefile calls, which subsequently makes a custom makefile by parsing the c-files examining their dependencies, starting with the base Main.cpp file.</p>

<p>But I didn't want to turn to this hackish solution if there was a more standardized solution or some way to do this within make.</p>

<p>'2.'<br>
If the makefile system is incapable of this, should I go ahead with my custom python script, or is there a more elegant solution?</p>

<p>...............</p>

<p>To be perfectly clear, again I do NOT have a constant list of dependencies/sources/headers/objects and I do NOT want to force my end user to maintain such a list.</p>

<p>I need some way of autogenerate this tree, based on the contents of my C-files.</p>

<p>Apologies if this is a ""dumb"" question, I'm relatively new to the world of make -- and like most am self-taught.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Feel free to ask any questions.  </p>

<p>FYI, though, my project has too many sources, though, to just post them all and I cannot do so for proprietary/research reasons.</p>

<p>Currently I have to find the view in SSMS Object Explorer, right click it and generate the create script, then search for the name of the view's column.  Then I note which ordinal position it is in the view (let's say 4th column), and have to find the corresponding 4th column in the select statement.  The select statement will most likely be using a table alias, so then I have to look through the JOIN statements to find the table name based on the alias.  </p>

<p>I'm writing a Python module that provides an interface to my C++ library, which provides some specialized image manipulation functionality. It would be most convenient to be able to access image buffers as CGImageRefs from Python, so they could be manipulated further using Quartz (using PyObjC, which works well). </p>

<p>So I have a C++ function that provides a CGImageRef representation from my own image buffers, like this:</p>

<p><code>CGImageRef CreateCGImageRefForImageBuffer(shared_ptr&lt;ImageBuffer&gt; buffer);</code></p>

<p>I'm using Boost::Python to create my Python bridge. What is the easiest way for me to export this function so that I can use the CGImageRef from Python?</p>

<p>Problems:  The CGImageRef type can't be exported directly because it is a pointer to an undefined struct. So I could make a wrapper function that wraps it in a PyCObject or something to get it to send the pointer to Python. But then how do I ""cast"" this object to a CGImageRef from Python? Is there a better way to go about this?</p>

ViewPager has a method setOffscreenPageLimit(n) in which you can set the number of ViewPager fragments that are created in advance, but n=0 is not allowed. The reason behind that is to garantee a 'smooth user experience'. In my case however then content of page n+1 is determined by what the user has done on page n. For instance if the user has clicked on a checkbox on page n, it can happen that some widget should not be shown on page n+1. My question is: how can I ensure that page n+1 is recreated? If that goes at the cost of a 'smooth user experience' so be it. I am able to intercept the swipe event in:</p>

<pre><code>pager.setOnPageChangeListener(new ViewPager.SimpleOnPageChangeListener()
</code></pre>

<p>In that method I can call a refresh() method of the current fragment. The problem is: what do I do in that refresh() method or is this the wrong approach? The user interface I want to recreate is in the onCreate method, a callback method. Or can't this work and do I need to replace the Fragment (n+1) in memory with a new one and if so, how do I do that?</p>

<p>This question may be more relevant to Microsoft Product Development but anyone knowledgeable please reply too....</p>

<p>I am using EF 5, POCO, Code First, DbContext API from C# to access SQL Server and in future Oracle.
I find that I need to use native SQL to get access to underlying database features, performance and control. So I use context.Database.SqlQuery and context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand (with SqlParameters) a lot. I also need precise control over my Begin Transaction and Commit/Rollback/Set Transaction. </p>

<p>Are the above mentioned SQL Native facilities likely to be deprecated and removed in future EF versions?</p>

<p>Am I better off using ADO.Net and forget about using EF ?
Or perhaps ADO.Net will eventually get deprecated in favour of EF so I should stick to DbContext despite using mostly native SQL access?</p>

This is great, and helps ensure that privacy violations do not occur with such sensitive data, such as writing them to a logger (in debug).</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but we have cases of passwords being passed into the system through other variable names such as 'credential', as well as other confidential information that needs to be treated with the same level of strictness in handling, as Fortify does with variables containing the string 'password'! </p>

<pre><code>    [""Adventure"", ""Sci-Fi""]
</code></pre>

<p><br>
What would be the best way to iterate through the <em>items</em> in the ng-repeat and compare the <em>categories</em> array... to the <em>categoriesFiltered</em> array, and push the <em>items</em> that match to the new <em>filtered</em> array?</p>

<p><br>
This is how far I have come</p>

<pre><code>categoryFilter.filter('filterCategories', function () {
    return function (items, categoriesFiltered) {
        var filtered = [];

        for (var i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {
            for (var j = 0; j &lt; items[i].categories; j++) {
                if (filtered.indexOf(items[i].categories[j]) === -1) {
                    filtered.push(items[i]);
                };
            };
        };
        return filtered;
    };
});

My interest is, what is the probability that a sequence contains errors, given the error rate per base, number of mismatches and the number of bases in the amplicon.</p>

<p>I came across an article <strong>[Cummings, S. M. et al (2010). Solutions for PCR, cloning and sequencing errors in population genetic analysis. Conservation Genetics, 11(3), 1095–1097. doi:10.1007/s10592-009-9864-6]</strong> 
that proposes this formula to calculate the probability mass function in such cases. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/hZkXn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I implemented the formula with R as shown here </p>

<pre><code>pcr.prob &lt;- function(k,N,eps){
  v = numeric(k)
  for(i in 1:k) {
    v[i] = choose(N,k-i) * (eps^(k-i)) * (1 - eps)^(N-(k-i))
    }
  1 - sum(v)
}
</code></pre>

<p>From the article, suggest we analysed an 800 bp amplicon using a PCR of 30 cycles with <code>1.85e10-5</code> misincorporations per base per cycle, and found <code>10</code> unique sequences that are each <code>3</code> bp different from their most similar sequence. The probability that a novel sequences was generated by three independent PCR errors equals <code>P = 0.0011</code>.</p>

<p>However when I use my implementation of the formula I get a different value.</p>

<pre><code>pcr.prob(3,800,0.0000185)
[1] 5.323567e-07
</code></pre>

<p>What could I be doing wrong in my implementation? Am I misinterpreting something?</p>

  left join person on junior = person.id
  left join person_studylevel on level = person_studylevel.id
group by junior

<p>part of it seems to have something to do with the concat_group function, because if i remove it, it shows the description field correctly.</p>

<p>however I noticed is that even if the new data is valid and no validation error occured, it doesn't update the custom user meta.</p>

<p>below is a sample of my codes:</p>

<p>call back to the user_profile_update_errors action hook, I intentionally did not check if the $errors object has errors to illustrate the somehow the update_user_meta does not get triggered. also this is a function of a class</p>

<pre><code>public function updateCustomUserMeta($errors,$update,$user){

    // Check if user has authority to change this
    if(!current_user_can('read',$user-&gt;ID)){
        $errors-&gt;add(""permission_denied"",""You do not have permission to update this page"");
    }

    // Var declaration and default values
    $mn = """";

    // Validation
    if(isset($_POST[""alumni-middlename""])){
        $mn = trim($_POST[""alumni-middlename""]);

        if(empty($mn)){
            $errors-&gt;add(""middlename_empty"",""Middle Name Empty"");
        }
    }else{
        $errors-&gt;add(""middlename_not_passed"",""Middle Name Field Not Passed"");
    }

    update_user_meta($user-&gt;ID,""Middle Name"",$_POST[""alumni-middlename""]);

}// end updateCustomUserMeta
</code></pre>

<p>and this is my plugin in bootstrap code:</p>

<pre><code>add_action( 'user_profile_update_errors',array(AlumniUserRolesAndCapabilities::getInstance(),""validateCustomUserMeta""));
</code></pre>

<p>To sum up, I want to be able to validate the custom user meta via php and prevent updating of values if there are errors and display it appropriately normally just like what wordpress does. Also if there are no validation errors, udpate the specified custom user metas.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

receiver programmatically, but the event is not firing.  I can,
however, successfully register and capture this intent filter if I
declare it in a manifest.xml  activity section.  Here's the code for
the receiver that's not working:</p>

<pre><code>BroadcastReceiver br;

br = new BroadcastReceiver() {
       @Override

intf.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_HOME);
intf.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT);

registerReceiver(br, intf);

<p>Does anyone know why this doesn't capture the home button click?</p>

<p>By the way, I tried working around this by creating another activity
and specifying its intent filter in the manifest.  I set the activity
enabled=""false"" in the manifest but I couldn't figure out how to
enable that activity at run time.  Bottom line, I only want to
register the home button intent filter for my application only when my
application is running, and I can't figure out how to do that.</p>

<p>It is working fine for lessons CPT, but...on posts and pages, it disables ""publish"" button, substituting it for ""send to review"". I don't know why, but it is no good at all.</p>

<p>Current code:</p>

<pre><code>    if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) exit;


    //Function to prepare excerpt

    function mltrib_prepare_excerpt($excerpt) {

//Execute shortcode on the excerpt  
    $excerpt = do_shortcode($excerpt);

    $excerpt = strip_tags($excerpt);
//Removing unwanted strings, shortcode not executed and empty lines
    $excerpt = str_replace(array('Toggle', 'Title', 'Envie suas transcrições para nós. Saiba mais aqui.', '[ninja_forms_display_form id=1]', '&amp;nbsp;'), '', $excerpt);
//Trimming words, allowing only 100, followed by ""...""
    $excerpt = wp_trim_words($excerpt, 100);
//Returning result
    return $excerpt;

}

add_filter( 'wp_insert_post_data', 'mltrib_populate_excerpt', 99, 2 );

/** 
 * Checks if the the post field ""excerpt"" was filled or not. If not, using ""content"" to fill it.
 * Code reference: http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/52897/12615
 */

function mltrib_populate_excerpt( $data, $postarr ) {   
// check if it's a valid call
//    if ( !in_array( $data['post_status'], array( 'draft', 'pending', 'auto-draft' ) ) &amp;&amp; 'lesson' == $data['post_type'] ) 

// Checking if it is a ""lesson"" post type
    if ( 'lesson' == $data['post_type'] ) 
    {
// if the excerpt is empty, call the excerpt creation function
        if ( strlen($data['post_excerpt']) == 0 ) {

// using prepare excerpt function   
    $data['post_excerpt'] = mltrib_prepare_excerpt($data['post_content']);

        }

    return $data;
    }
}?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I was thinking if the problem is related to the add_filter, so I tried adding it only on Lesson CPT, with this:</p>

<pre><code>add_action('wp', 'mltrib_islesson');

    function mltrib_islesson() {
        if ('lesson' == get_post_type()) {

            add_filter( 'wp_insert_post_data', 'mltrib_populate_excerpt', 99, 2 );          

        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>But with this the plugin won't work on lesson CPT.</p>

<p>So, I am clueless. Any guess?</p>

<p>I have a texture with grayscale colors and an alpha channel with either 0f or 1f (nothing in between). I want to draw the texture in green but only when alpha is 1 and draw nothing when alpha is 0. To select green, so I've set glColor4fv green_opaque with GLfloat green_opaque .5 1 .5 1</p>

<p>Now, I use this fragment shader:</p>

<pre><code>const char * fragment_shader_source=
        ""uniform sampler2D tex;""
        ""void main() {""
        ""       vec4 color=texture2D(tex,gl_TexCoord[0].st);""

        ""               gl_FragColor=color*glColor;""
#else
        ""               gl_FragColor=color;""
#endif

        ""               discard;""
        ""       }""
        ""}""
;
</code></pre>

<p>Without A, the shader respects the alpha channel but the rendered texture obviously remains gray. Now, I define A and the shader now colorizes the texture as I want, but alpha channel gets ignored now.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong here? Or is it a driver/hardware bug?</p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<p>""Do you mean ""gl_Color"" instead of ""glColor"" in your shader?""</p>

<p>Exactly that was the problem - which btw I figured out myself yesterday already, but due to java script issues i couldn't post the answer yet.</p>

<p>Mirroring functionality is provided by official docker-registry image but only for the Public Registry.
See <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker-registry#mirroring-options"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>:
""Beware that mirroring only works for the public registry. You can not create a mirror for a private registry.""</p>

<p>My use-case:
A bigger development team that is working in an office with a limited network. They only pull docker images from registries. Pushing is occasional and handled by Jenkins box hosted in AWS. Most of the images they use resides in our password protected Private Registry (served over https). So it's only natural to mirror/cache the Registry on a machine in a local network. If not for https I would just go for HTTP_PROXY and local squid install.</p>

<p>I have tried </p>

<pre><code>Good_df &lt;-subset(All_df, Originator %in% Bad_df$Originator) 
</code></pre>

<p>however nrows of each df looks a little off!</p>

<pre><code>&gt; nrow(All_df)

&gt; nrow(Bad_df)
[1] 1,452

<p>From my understanding replications gives you load balancing and redundancy, since it is a straight copy.
Sharding gives you load balancing and acquires half the memory for the index but you are dependent of both working.</p>

<p>So when they set up the cluster like this with 4 servers, would the requests be approximately 4 times faster?
If you only have 1 shard with 4 replicas, does it get 4 times faster with more redundancy?</p>

<p>I took for granted that there is no point in having virtual servers because it wouldn't give you more CPUs to work simultaneously.</p>

The external HTML is from a trusted source, and includes what ever is between two specific <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags from a number of different pages.  </p>

<p>My problem is that some of the pages contain inline javascript event handlers.  So when I am working in the WYSIWYG editor, certain events cause the execution of this js.  </p>

<p>Mostly it doesn't do anything other than fill up the console with errors saying <code>... is not defined</code>, and this may be all it is, and that wouldn't be a problem.  But still, it's messy, and I don't know if there isn't a page somewhere that might execute something like <code>alert(...)</code> which could get extremely annoying.  The code is all trusted, but detached from its intended context, it could produced undesirable results.  </p>

<p>I want to find a way to globally prevent this execution, preferably without modifying the inline script.  I could do something like attach <code>=false;</code> to each handler, but then I have to check all the incoming elements, and even with regular expressions, this will degrade performance.  Also, I then would have to remove it before submitting the edited HTML back to the server, which seems like a major pain, and difficult to do flawlessly.</p>

<p>Is there a way to prevent this online code from being executed within this particular context?</p>

<p>My thought was to use jquery to listen to click events on the .special-sharing link and then… preventDefault(); and change e.g. the content attr of my meta tag in the head to a new image src. Then call the facebook?sharer= blabla.</p>

I was using Cocos2d-2.0 with CocosBuilder 2.1, testing a tutorial project called cocosdragon code.zynga.c om/2012/10/creating-a-game-with-cocosbuilder/.
However I found that the CCLayerGradient that created is not compatible with cocos2d 2.0, I googled and found others had similar issue. github.c om/cocos2d/CocosBuilder/issues/129</p>

<p>Then I upgrade my cocos2d-iphone to 2.1 version. But this time there're much more problems, because CocosBuilder 2.1 is not 100% compatible with cocos2d 2.1 either. <a href=""https://github.com/cocos2d/CCBReader/issues/3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cocos2d/CCBReader/issues/3</a></p>

<p>And I saw someone says that cocosbuilder v2.1-rc3 can work with cocos-iphone 2.1 beta2, someone recommends to use cocos2d-iphone-2.1-beta4. <a href=""https://github.com/cocos2d/CocosBuilder/issues/129"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cocos2d/CocosBuilder/issues/129</a>  I haven't tried out these two suggestions yet.</p>

<p>Because I'm a newbie, and not familiar with Github, nor do I have many knowledge of coding or compiling. So I would like to have suggestions from whoever have related experience. What version of cocos2d-iphone and cocosbuilder should I use?</p>

<p>I'm not willing to use rc(I don't even know what does rc mean) or beta version of cocos2d-ihpone, since there're stable version of cocos2d 2.0 and 2.1.
I'm not willing to use cocosbuilder 3 either because it says there maybe some bugs which would beyond my ability to deal with. (I tried cocosbuilder 3 but can't even find where to get the right CCBReader files)</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this long story. I've taken several days to deal with this problem, but failed. I even messed up my old project in the process of updating cocos2d from 2.0 rc1 to 2.1 without keep a napshot. I just don't know where to ask, any suggestions would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>My temporary workaround is using curl to basically login as myself through a proxy and access the external data I need.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of advanced php setting I can set so that internally whenever it tries to invoke something like <code>file_get_contents()</code> it always goes through a proxy? I'm on Windows ATM so it'd be a pain to recompile if that's the only way.</p>

<p>The reason my workaround is temporary is because I need a solution that's generic and works for multiple users instead of using one user's credentials ( Ive considered requesting a separate user account solely to do this but passwords change often and this technique needs to be deployed throughout a dozen or more sites ). I don't want to hard-code credentials basically to use the curl workaround.</p>

I have been given an application that run as a service, with a specific service account (not admin on the server), and try to open an Excel workbook.</p>

<p>The problem is not with the initial application, as I can reproduce it with the generic C# code below (embedded in a service structure):</p>

<pre><code>try{
    this._exApp = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ApplicationClass();
    this._exApp.Visible = false;

    Log.Logger.Info(""Opening workbook..."");

                );
    Log.Logger.Info(""Workbook opened!"");

    //Do something with the result
    Log.Logger.Info(""Closing workbook..."");
    workbook.Close(false, thisFileName, null);
    Marshal.ReleaseComObject(workbook);

    this._exApp.Quit();
}
catch(Exception ex){
    Log.Logger.Error(ex.Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>(nothing special about *this._exApp* and <em>thisFileName</em>, which are just respectively casted to a Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application, and as a string with the path of the file to open. Log.Logger is a a logger class using log4net to allow me seeing when the problem occurs)</p>

<p>The service is running as a service account, which is a user on the server, not an admin. It has access to the target file and to files on the server (as Read access). The server is a Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition SP2 (could not try yet on a 2008 R2 server).</p>

<p>The problem I am facing is that it just hangs when trying to open the workbook, so in terms of tracing the last line I have is ""Opening workbook..."", never reaching the ""Workbook opened"" line. No exception is raised.</p>

<p>So the code is very simple, it is just trying to open an excel workbook. I have done already some investigations, and here are my findings:</p>

<ul>
<li>I know that Microsoft does not support a server side Excel automation, but I have been given the service as it, and do not have a choice about the technology used.</li>
<li>I have configured all the Component Services/DCOM/Microsoft Excel Application security settings so that the service account has all the permissions possible.</li>
<li>The service does the job correctly if the service account is local admin on the machine. This is not really on option for production.</li>
<li>The service does the job correctly if the file it tries to open is a local file. Unfortunately, the file we tries to access is on a remote file server, and it does not work in that situation.</li>
<li>The code above run from a command line with the same user on a remote file works fine, but not any more when run as a service.</li>
<li>I have read about the <em>C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\Desktop</em> bug, but the folder exists.</li>
<li>Excel open correctly when lauched with the service account.</li>
</ul>

<p>So basically, the situation is the Workbooks.Open method hangs when run as a service, under a service account that is not admin, and when accessing a remote file.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any input or idea on this topic.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Jonathan</p>

<p>EDIT: As per Matt's workaround below, we have implemented a local copy of the remote file, so I am accepting it as an answer, but I remain interested in any suggestion on how to make it work directly on the remote file.</p>
