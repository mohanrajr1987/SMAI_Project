<p>The obvious solution is to use different uploaders for those fields.

I'm trying to use EF with a legacy database that uses a ""pk/fk"" prefix rather than an ""id"" suffix to mark keys.  Also, it's not uncommon to have multiple foreign keys to an Address table, for example, called ""fkAddressHome"" and ""fkAddressWork"".</p>

<p>I would prefer a method for changing this behavior in a systematic way so that I don't have to specify these changes for every table.  I looked into the option of overriding the column names in the OnModelCreating method, but it was disappointing to see that if you add one column that way, then you have to add them all.  And that violated my DRY sensibilities.</p>

<p>However, any solution would be appreciated.  EF4, and particularly CTP4's Code First enhancements, are really, really nice.  I look forward to seeing what else makes into the next version of EF.  Thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I was able to map the relationship by adding the following to my OnModelCreating method:</p>

<pre><code>modelBuilder.Entity&lt;User&gt;()
    .HasRequired&lt;Address&gt;(p =&gt; p.Address)
    .HasConstraint((p, u) =&gt; p.fkAddressHome == u.pkAddress);

<p>One idea would be to have scripting language do this for me after querying the SQL database - but that seems horribly inefficient, perhaps.</p>

<p>The second idea would be to have views in the database that represent business weeks and months -- this might be the best way to do it.</p>

<p>But my final idea is -- couldn't a SQL client simply run a query that aggregates all the daily data into weeks (or months) and store them in a separate table? The advantage of this is that it would reduce querying time of any user, since all the query work is done before a website or button is even loaded/ pushed. Even with a view, I guess that aggregation calculation would have to be done as soon as the view was queried.</p>

<p>The only downside to having the queries aggregated from the weeks/ months perhaps even once a day (instead of every time the website is loaded) -- is that it won't be up-to-date/ may reflect inconsistencies.</p>

<p>I'm not really an expert when it comes to this bigger picture stuff -- anyone have any thoughts? thanks</p>

<p>The context here is error logging. I'd like to develop a generic CATCH clause, or sub-clause, that grabs all parameter values as well as other error and execution info and logs it to a table (one or more).</p>

<p>The basic version looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROC dbo.Proc1 @Param1 INT, @Param2 INT
AS
BEGIN TRY
  SELECT 1/0
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
  DECLARE @params XML
  SET @params = (
    SELECT 
      @Param1 AS [Param1]
    , @Param2 AS [Param2]
    FOR XML PATH('params'), TYPE
    )
  EXEC dbo.LogError @procid = @@PROCID, @params = @params
  EXEC dbo.RethrowError
END CATCH
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this template does work, except that for each individual procedure, I would have to edit the <code>SET @params</code> section manually.</p>

<p>I could script it out easily enough, but then I would still need to copy it in.</p>

<p>I could leave some sort of placeholder, and then dynamically update each definition w/ a correct <code>SET</code> statement. I could even write a database trigger that listens for CREATE and ALTER PROC statements and have it do this for me automagically.</p>

<p>But what I really want is just to grab the collection of parameters directly and be done with it. Is there any way?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: getting parameter metadata from the system tables is not enough. For example:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX)
SET @sql = 
  'SET @params = (SELECT '
+ STUFF((
    SELECT ', '+name+' AS '+STUFF(name,1,1,'') 
    FROM sys.parameters WHERE object_id = @@PROCID
    FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE).value('.','NVARCHAR(MAX)')
    ,1,2,'')
+ ' FOR XML PATH(''params''), TYPE)'
-- inline execute here....alas, there's isn't a mode for that
EXEC sp_executesql @sql, N'@params XML OUTPUT', @params OUTPUT
</code></pre>

<p>This, of course, generates an error, since I haven't declared parameters for the nested scope of <code>sp_executesql</code>. While I could script out the second param of <code>sp_executesql</code>, I can't assign them without explicitly assigning them one at a time by name.</p>

<p><strong>Original question, rephrased</strong>: is there another flavor of <code>sp_executesql</code> that inherits variable ""context"" from the outer scope, that executes in the same frame, that inlines the command, rather than executing in a nested scope?</p>

<pre><code>#mycontainer{ min-height:450px;top:20%;bottom:20%;}

<p>then scroll only happens when mouse is over or focus is on <code>#mycontainer</code>,</p>

<p>so by applying padding :</p>

<pre><code>#mycontainer{ height:100%;padding:20% 0 20% 100px;}
</code></pre>

<p>my scroll works everywhere on a page but this not keeps elements in center.</p>

<p>So, for now i achieve this by using jquery :</p>

<pre><code>var padding = ($(window).height() - content_height) / 2;

$('#mycontainer').css({ 'padding': (padding+'px') + ' 0 ' + (padding+'px') + ' 100px' });

<blockquote>
  <p>""An <em>array</em> is a linear allocation of memory in which elements are
  accessed by integers that are used to compute offsets. Arrays can be
  very fast data structures. Unfortunately, JavaScript does not have
  anything like this kind of array.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I keep finding examples of people doing incredible things with JavaScript, so I'm curious to know whether we can (or can't) emulate this true array data structure in JavaScript. <strong>How can it be done, or why can't it?</strong></p>

<p>For example, I thought of using a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob"" rel=""nofollow"">Blob</a> for building and working on this data structure, since any object-based structure will just be bound by the usual core Object speed/performance constraints. </p>

<p>I am currently setting the page control's <code>numberOfPages</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>scrollEnabled = false</code> on the <code>collectionView</code>, and this does stop the user from 3-finger swiping to go to the other page, but it doesn't prevent accessing that page using other methods. If they tap the button that comes after the collection view then they swipe left to go to the previous element, it focuses on the last cell on the second page of the collection view. </p>

<p>I then tried also setting <code>pagingEnabled = false</code>, but then if the user highlights the last cell in the first row then swipes right, then it will scroll over so you can see half of the first page and half of the second page and it highlights the first character of that second page.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AaqOl.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AaqOl.png"" alt=""Start page""></a></p>

<p>This will be the start page for my application.</p>

<p>There will be two interested parties using the application.</p>

<p>One of them lets us call it the creator, see a screen similar to the image above, introduce a specific number on the input box, and generate a matrix like the above one. Only the creator can see this screen.</p>

<p>After the matrix is created, the creator will be able to send an email to a pre-defined list of users containing a link to a page where the users (the second interested party using the application) will be able to add content to each one of the cells of the matrix above. Then, once all the cells have content on them, the users will press a ""Submit"" button which should save and store the filled matrix into a MongoDB database from where I can query the results of and perform some statistical analysis.</p>

<p>I have two (three) issues now:</p>

<p>1) I first developed this matrix using only HTML+Javascript using SVG figures because it was simple and more intuitive to me;</p>

<p>2) I then tried to convert the HTML+Javascript version to AngularJS for two reasons:</p>

<p>2.1 - I thought it would be easy to integrate it with MongoDB if I was already using a component of the MEAN stack;</p>

<p>2.2 - The matrix could be stored in JSON or more precisely, I could add a series of <code>JSON.parse(""string that represents a line of the matrix"")</code> strings into a matrix instead of just appending SVG string into a single huge SVG picture;</p>

<p>3) In AngularJS (maybe I'm doing something very wrong) I cant get the desired behavior as some things don't work (namely, inside an if/else statement some of the branches dont work), I'll show the code below soon.</p>

<p>After all this explanation, my questions are simply two:</p>

<p>Second question(s):</p>

<p>Is there a decent way to improve this in order to make it easier for me to add MongoDB into this small project?</p>

<p>And secondly, I'm devising all the code using the IDE WebStorm 10. If I need support for MongoDB/Node.JS and all the other server-side code dependencies, should I add more JS source files under a normal project tree? Or create separated files?</p>

<p>As you can see I'm still new to web design and web projects but, I'm eager to learn!</p>

<pre><code>//header

//implementation file
@synthesize currentDate;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my app, I call a refreshData method which passes that object to another helper class to get some data from a remote service:</p>

<p>(note the above call is on the background thread)</p>

<p>now, in side that helper class, I have added these lines</p>

<pre><code>- (NSMutableArray*) refreshForAddress:(NSString *)address

<p>But I get the classic error: ""<em>*</em> -[__NSDate timeIntervalSince1970]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x71beea0""</p>

<p>There are Question in ""array"" I had in homework. when I write my answer
the output is not true ..!</p>

<p>help me please to correct my code :$ </p>

<p>Q1:
Write a program that looks for vowels in a given word, the program
counts the occurrence of each vowel in the word. For example, if the
entered word was “expedition” the program outputs: Vowel ‘a’ occurred
0 times Vowel ‘e’ occurred 2 times Vowel ‘I’ occurred 2 times Vowel
‘o’ occurred 1 times Vowel ‘u’ occurred 0 times Vowel ‘y’ occurred 0
times </p>

<p>Your program should include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Array of characters to store the word. </li>
<li>Function vowels that receives an array of characters. The
function counts and prints the occurrence of each vowel.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My Answer</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std ;
void vowels(char const arrayv[],int L)
{
    int a=0,e=0,i=0,o=0,u=0,y=0;
    for(int j=0;j&lt;=L;j++)
    {   
        if( arrayv[j]=='a'||'A')
        {a+=1;}
        else if( arrayv[j]=='e'||'E')
        {e+=1;}
        else if( arrayv[j]=='i'||'I')
        {i+=1;}
        else if( arrayv[j]=='o'||'O')
        {o+=1;}
        else if( arrayv[j]=='u'||'U')
        {u+=1;}

    string word(arraya);
    L=word.length();
    vowels(arraya,L);

</code></pre>

<p>Q2:</p>

<p>Write a program that reads from the user two words (as array of
characters) the program then copies the shortest word into an array
and prints the word to the user along with number of characters in the
word. As an example: Word1: “example” Word2: “tutorial” The program
would output: the shortest word is “tutorial” with 8 characters. </p>

<p>Your
program should include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Three character arrays . </li>
<li>Function readArray which takes an array of characters and asks the user to
input a word. </li>
<li>Function findShortest which receives array of the two
words, compares between them and prints the shortest one along with
the number of characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: Using string built-in functions are allowed.</p>

<p><strong>My Answer:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

const int size=100;
int i=0,j=0;

        arrayx[i]=string1[i];
    }
    return 0;}
else
{
    for( j=0 ; j&lt;100 ;i++)
    {   arraya[j]=string1[j];}
return 1;}
}

int main()
{
int a,b;
char string1[size] ;
char string2[size] ;
char string3[size];

<p>And they are checking to see if the user already has a frontend cookie with the following:</p>

<p>So, how do I deal with the cases where one or more of the following are occurring:</p>

<ul>
<li>Varnish is adding the frontend= cookie for Magento (Turpentine)</li>
<li>The backend is returning one or more cookies</li>
<li>The client already has one or more cookies</li>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> I have an API-driven rails 3 application utilizing DataMapper(DM) and a DM adapter to interface with the API. Each DM model has a corresponding REST-ish API endpoint much like you get with rails scaffolding. The API requires various headers for requests, including API tokens, keys, ids etc. The headers have nothing to do with the requested data, they exist for authorization and tracking purposes only. A number of these tokens are stored in the session. I want a clean way to make these API headers available to any model during a request.</p>

<p>Possible solutions:</p>

<h2>1. Passing session variables from the controller to the models</h2>

<p>The obvious answer is passing the tokens in a hash or other object from the controller to the models. A controller action might have the following: <code>@user = User.find(params[:id], api_headers)</code>. </p>

<p>The problem is needing to override any model method to accept the additional <code>api_headers</code> object. Not counting methods defined by Rails and DataMapper, there are hundreds of methods already defined in the application models that would need to be rewritten. So I'm ruling out a rewrite, and this also doesn't seem like a good solution since it would require overriding a ridiculous number of DM methods like the <code>User#find</code> example above.</p>

<h2>2. Some metaprogramming hack</h2>

<p>I could catch any <code>ArgumentError</code>'s on DM's base class and check if the last argument is the <code>api_headers</code> object, then set the values as instance variables and invoke the requested method. This thought exercise already has me cringing at dealing with optional arguments etc. If given long enough I could probably create a functional Frankenstein that should get me fired but probably wouldn't.</p>

<h2>3. Use a singleton (current preferred solution)</h2>

<p>In the application controller set a <code>before_filter</code> to dump the session-stored API headers into a singleton <code>ApiHeaders</code> object. Then any model making an API request can get that singleton with the required API headers. </p>

<p>An additional <code>after_filter</code>* on the application controller would set all attributes to <code>nil</code> on the <code>ApiHeaders</code> singleton at the end of the request to prevent leaking headers between requests.</p>

<p>This is currently my preferred solution but I don't like that the API header values could potentially carry over into other requests if the <code>after_filter</code> doesn't get invoked. I don't know in which scenarios this might happen (in an application error perhaps?) which raises concerns. All I know is the values don't necessarily die with the request.</p>

<h2>4. Custom code</h2>

<p>Drop support of DataMapper and the custom API adapter and manually make all API calls, passing through all required API headers. Besides the fact I don't have time for this level of rewrite, why use a framework at all if you have to throw a huge chunk out to support a custom auth scheme?</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>What's the cleanest way to get these pesky API tokens from the session into the bowels of the application where they can be sent with each API request? I'm hoping for a better solution than those listed above.</p>

I know that I could accomplish this by checking conditions -- if I'm changing font colors, then I can just ""scroll"" by using conditional logic (if color1, then change to color2; if color2, then change to color 3; etc.). I was wondering if there might be a more elegant way to accomplish this -- specifically, is there a way to store custom attributes for cells in VBA? </p>

<p>For example, if I set cell B3 to a certain border style (thin line for top,left,right but double line for bottom), is there a way to create and set a VBA attribute of Cell.CustomBorderStyle = 1? Otherwise, I believe I would have to build logic into my macro for the precise formatting (if top,left,right = thin and bottom = double then change to second style, etc.). I'm not sure if creating a custom class in VBA would allow me to do this, or if there's any way at all to do this.</p>

<p>Google hasn't been able to explain to me what the purpose of this command is, but I don't think it's working. My gut feeling is that it should copy the <em>targetFile</em> to <em>self.tmpFolder</em>, but I'm not sure, since for the source file none of this subprocess.open stuff seen in the executeCommandList method was used, but instead, the file sourceConvert took care of it directly like this:</p>

<pre><code>def sourceConvert(self):
    self.sourceExtHeader = '.'+self.sourceText.GetValue().split('.')[-1]
    self.sourceExtBinary = self.getBinaryFileExtension( self.sourceExtHeader )

    self.sourceFile = 'source'+self.sourceExtHeader
    self.logOutput.AppendText('Copy source T2 to tmp/ folder.\n')

    shutil.copyfile(self.sourceText.GetValue()[:-4] + self.sourceExtHeader, self.tmpFolder + self.sourceFile[:-4] + self.sourceExtHeader)
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone help me shed some light on this issue, i.e., what is the command passed to the shell through the executeCommand-method supposed to do, and what could be the problem with the implementation that I'm experiencing?</p>

<p>Everything actually works fine except when I enter ""quit"" the program doesn't break from the for loop and continues until it is finished.

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> little hack to work around</p>

<pre><code>def saveFile(self,filename):
    """"""
        save svg with updated image tag id's
    """"""
    data = StringIO()
    self.fig.savefig(data,format='svg',transparent=True)
    data.seek(0)
    img = minidom.parse(data)
    it=0
    for i in img.getElementsByTagName('image'):
        i.setAttribute('id','img_'+self.gids[it])
        it+=1
    fw = open(filename,""w"")
    img.writexml(fw)
    fw.close()
    data.close()
    img.unlink()

<p>I've a local application that process the user input for 3 second (approximately) and then return an answer (output) to the user.</p>

<p>(I don't want to go into details about my application in purpose of not complicate the question and keep it a pure architectural question)</p>

<h2>My Goal:</h2>

<p>I want to make my application a service in the cloud and expose API
 (for the upcoming website and for clients that will connect the service without install the software locally)</p>

<h2>Possible Solutions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Deploy WCF on the cloud and use my application there, so clients can invoke the service and use my application on the cloud. <strong>(RPC style)</strong></li>
<li>Use a Web-API that will insert the request into queue and then a worker role will dequeue requests and post the results to a DB, so the client will send one request for creating a request in the queue, and another request for getting the result (which the Web-API will get from the DB).</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Problems:</h2>

<ul>
<li>If I go with the WCF solution (#1) I cant handle great loads of requests, maybe 10-20 simultaneously.</li>
<li>If I go with the WebAPI-Queue-WorkerRole solution (#2) sometimes the client will need to request the results multiple times its can be a problem.</li>
<li>If I go with the WebAPI-Queue-WorkerRole solution (#2) the process isn't sync, the client will not get the result once the process of his request is done, he need to request the result.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>In the WebAPI-Queue-WorkerRole solution (#2), can I somehow alert the client once his request has processed and done ? so I can save the client multiple request (for the result).</li>
<li><p>Asking multiple times for the result isn't old stuff ? I remmemeber that 10 - 15 years ago its was accepted but now ? I know that <a href=""https://www.virustotal.com/he/documentation/public-api/#getting-file-scans"" rel=""nofollow"">VirusTotal API</a>  use this kind of design. </p></li>
<li><p>There is a better solution ? one that will handle great loads and will be sync or async (returning result to the client once it done) ? </p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>&lt;select&gt;    
&lt;option value=""Zinksulfat"" selected=""selected""&gt;Zinksulfat&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""Zypressen&amp;ouml;l"" selected=""selected""&gt;Zypressenöl&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""Wirkstoff&amp;quot;Mit'Anf&amp;uuml;hrungszeichen"" selected=""selected""&gt;Wirkstoff""Mit'Anführungszeichen&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For HTML encoding of variables in jQuery I´m using this simple function:</p>

<pre><code>function htmlEntities(str) {
    return String(str).replace(/&amp;/g, '&amp;amp;').replace(/&lt;/g, '&amp;lt;').replace(/&gt;/g, '&amp;gt;').replace(/""/g, '&amp;quot;').replace('ü', '&amp;uuml;').replace('ö', '&amp;ouml;');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I try to <strong>get the option object by it´s value</strong> (""select"" is the select box):</p>

<pre><code>// Set the element value
var elementValue = 'Wirkstoff""Mit'Anführungszeichen'; // Invalid I know - only for description purpose
    elementValue = htmlEntities(elementValue);

return select.find('option[value=""'+elementValue+'""]')[0];
</code></pre>

<p>So for elements without HTML characters it works like a charm (eg. ""Zinksulfat""). But for the elements with HTML Characters it doesn´t work. although the value in ""elementValue"" and the value field are exactly the same I receive ""<strong>undefined</strong>"".</p>

<p>Has anybody an idea what magic thing has to be done so that I can use HTML characters in the selector?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,

<p>Entrants basically specify which kind of drink they'd like and enter a barcode (relating to the type of biscuit).</p>

I have few questions regarding frequent code changes using WSP packages</p>

<ol>
<li>Do we need to retract a WSP package before installing updated WSP package? What happens to previous code deployment through this package. Do we need to keep all previous changes in wsp package, so that when we retract and remove old version we get all code changes from previous version and new version.</li>
<li>Keeping all the code changes in wsp package through various deployments can cause issues in case we have content type and list instances included in the package, how to manage this kind of changes?</li>

<p>First of all, every time we allocate memory we simply get a pointer to that memory.</p>

<pre><code>int * dynInt = new int;
</code></pre>

<p>So what is the difference between doing what I did above and:</p>

<pre><code>int someInt;
int* dynInt = &amp;someInt;
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand, in both cases memory is allocated for an int, and we get a pointer to that memory. </p>

<p>So what's the difference between the two. When is one method preferred to the other.</p>

<p>Further more why do I need to free up memory with </p>

<pre><code>delete dynInt;
</code></pre>

<p>in the first case, but not in the second case.</p>

<p>My guesses are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When dynamically allocating memory for an object, the object doesn't get initialized while if you do something like in the second case, the object get's initialized. If this is the only difference, is there a any motivation behind this apart from the fact that dynamically allocating memory is faster.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason we don't need to use delete for the second case is because the fact that the object was initialized creates some kind of an automatic destruction routine.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Those are just guesses would love it if someone corrected me and clarified things for me.</p>

<p>I have a layout with a few <code>EditText</code> boxes, and the bottom of which is fairly big and stretches from about halfway down the page to the bottom.

<p>Is there a way that I can wrap my layout into a <code>ScrollView</code> to allow the box to stay the same size, and let the user just scroll the page to see any items hidden by the keyboard (i.e. making the area above the keyboard the ""window"" but keeping the same sized views inside)?</p>

<p>A good example of what I mean is in the HTC's Mail setup screen where when creating a new account, you can scroll the screen to see the content hidden behind the keyboard when it's active. There are probably others, but that came to mind.</p>

<p>This is probably quite an easy question, but I've got this HTML layout:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button class=""btn btn-large btn-inverse""&gt;&lt;i class=""icon-white icon-shopping-cart""&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Add to bag&lt;/button&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>This is an add to cart button, I'm following along the book Agile Web Development to create a cart. Question is, with embedded HTML between the button tag, how do I get it to render like that? I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>%= button_to raw('&lt;i class=""icon-white icon-shopping-cart""&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Add to bag'), line_items_path(product_id: product) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But firstly it prints an ""input"" not a button, and the text is all askew in the html and not between opening and closing tags.</p>

<p>I know I can just write it all manually, but was hoping to figure out if there's a shortcut way to do this HTML to output using the rails tags, mainly because with twitter bootstrap I see this type of HTML pattern all the time...</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>I have a systemFailureType table that maps to a SystemFailureProblem table via a cross table.</p>

<p>Here is my designer layout for the tables:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nzN8m.png"" alt=""Designer Layout"">
And here are my models:</p>

<pre><code>     [MetadataType(typeof(SystemFailureProblemMetadata))]
    public partial class SystemFailureProblem
    {        
        private class SystemFailureProblemMetadata
        {
            public int ID { get; set; }

            [Required]
            [StringLength(200)]
            [DisplayName(""Problem Description"")]
            public String Description { get; set; }

            public IList&lt;xSystemFailureProblemToType&gt; FailureTypeCategories { get; set; }

        }        

}



[MetadataType(typeof(SystemFailureTypeMetaData))]
    public partial class SystemFailureType
    {
        private class SystemFailureTypeMetaData
        {
            public int ID { get; set; }

            [Required]
            [StringLength(200)]
            public String Description { get; set; }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>My current view code uses a view model that contains a problem object. So the current code I have for generating the checkbox list looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> @for(int i=0;i &lt; Model.problem.FailureTypeCategories.Count(); i++)
 {
       @Html.CheckBox(""FailureTypeCategories[""+i+""].ID"", false)

 }
</code></pre>

<p>My main issue is that I'm getting some errors when I try to generate the checkbox list saying that the FailureTypeCategories collection doesn't exist. I suspect it may be related to how I have the models set up currently. My initial thoughts are leaning towards implementing a model for the cross table, though I'm not quite sure how I would integrate that. Is there an different way I should be going about this, or am I on the right track and just missing something?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Here is the ViewModel</p>

<pre><code>        public SystemFailureProblem problem { get; set; }

        public SystemFailureProblemViewModel() { }

        public SystemFailureProblemViewModel(SystemFailureProblem problem)
        {
            this.problem = problem;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>The controller method is very simple. It just returns a partial view of the form.</p>

<pre><code> public ActionResult Edit(int id)
    {            
        try
        {
            return PartialView(""Form"", context.SystemFailureProblems.Single(p =&gt; p.ID == id));
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ModelState.AddModelError("""", ex.Message);
            return PartialView(""Form"", null);
        }
    }

<p>We have an update proc that updates all the fields on a record - some of them possibly to the same value that they currently are.</p>

<p>The issue we have is that we have an indexed view where this table is a parent to many thousands of child records and some of this tables fields are in that indexed view. Every time we do an update, even if it is effectively unchanged, it still does a lot of work in maintaining that indexed view.</p>

<p>I want to be able to do an UPDATE SET and have some way of only setting if there value is different. Not a where clause because I still want the other fields updated.</p>

<p>I guess Entity Framework does something like this in creating a dynamic update statement? Is there a simple solution for ADO.NET users using a stored proc for an update?</p>

<p>An example HTML link would be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""dir/newapge.html"" onclick=""idemo('dir/newpage.html'); return false;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As the onclick returns false it causes the browser to ignore the href... which is there for the search engines to find.</p>

<p>My idemo function just adds the id to the URL as a query string as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function idemo(whereto)
{
  location.href = whereto + ""?"" + escape(my_id_is);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The variable my_id_is has been declared and is set prior to this to a simple alphanumeric string such as ""myId"". It is displayed on the web page and debugging calls to alert() have confirmed that when idemo() is called that my_id_is correctly holds the expected string.</p>

<p>My problem is that with IE8 this very simple way of passing the Id to the new page does not always work. Sometimes, despite the call to idemo constructing the correct URL with the correct search string, the page displayed in IE8 does not include the search string... as if it has reverted to using the anchor tag href value.</p>

<p>So for example, instead of displaying the page ""dir/newpage.html?myId"" it simply displays ""dir/newpage.html""... note without even the question mark character.</p>

<p>My code worked for previous versions of IE (I believe) and works for Firefox.</p>

<p>I guess my question boils down to... is it OK to pass data between web pages by setting location.href to a URL containing a query string from within an anchor tag onclick event handler, and if so can you think of any reason why IE8 would have a problem with it ?</p>

<p>I'm thinking that because my custom action runs and waits for a long running process to end, maybe it's blocking whichever thread is responsible for updating the action text. </p>

<p>Now I write it, it doesn't seem to make sense, but I don't know what else might do it!</p>

<p>The main details of the Custom Action are:</p>

In-Script Execution:     Commit Execution in System Context

<pre><code>CreateObject(""Wscript.Shell"").Run """""""" &amp; WScript.Arguments(0) &amp; """""""", 0, True
</code></pre>

<p>The above line should hide the shell window and the 'True' ensures the shell doesn't return until the batch file has finished running.</p>

<p>I've also added my custom action to the Action Text list as per the link and associated it with a string.</p>

<p>Should work right?</p>

<p>Because the user get's different amounts of points for different fields, it checks certain fields on a model and whether or not the user put a value in them. It then multiplies these values with their weights to give a total score.</p>

<p>Nothing says it better then a bit of code:</p>

<pre><code>class UserContribCounter(object):
    """"""Can count the number of points a user got for his contributions""""""
    weight_dict = {'poster':2, 'title':1}

    def __init__(self, user):
        if isinstance(user, User):
            self.user = user
        else:
            raise Exception('Not a valid user instance.')

    def set_contrib_points(self):
        """"""Some dark magic counts the number of times a certain field was filled out""""""
        self.unweighted = Movie.objects.filter(user = self.user).aggregate(poster=Count('poster'),title=Count('title'))

    def get_contrib_points(self):
        """"""Multiplies the number of times a field was filled out with their weights to calculate the total number of points""""""
        try:
            self.unweighted
        except AttributeError:
            self.set_contrib_points()

        return sum([self.weight_dict[key] * value for key, value in self.unweighted.items()])
</code></pre>

<p>I also want to show a top 10, so I need to get the top 10 users. This means I will either have to write a complex aggregation which at the moment I keep failing to do, or I could use a signal in the following way:</p>

<p>When a model gets saved, catch the post_save signal. Then use my existing class to recount the points for the user, and store it in the users profile. This way I can sort the users by the value in their profile, which is trivial.</p>

<p>The question is, what will be more efficient, doing a recount every time a model get's saved, or a rather complex aggregation function. I know this will depend on a lot of things, but I am sure that from a conceptional point of view, there should be reasons to choose one over the other. Please note that some of the field I will check in the aggregate will also be relational, so I am not sure how that will effect performance.</p>

<p>This sort of works but despite creating the format for the separate columns, the rows get populated with only the last column's format. i.e.:</p>

The site is like a ""job application manager"" with multiple components such as an admin component and an end-user component. The component I'm working with is the part where the user would actually fill out a job application. The way things are structured with the other components, it makes the most sense to put all of the job application stuff in the same controller. All of these actions perform similar things but on different models, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class ExampleController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Action1() 
    {
        Guid appId = new Guid(Session[""AppId""].ToString());
        ... // logic to pull up correct model
        return View(model)
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult Action1(FormCollection formValues)
    {
        Guid appId = new Guid(Session[""AppId""].ToString());
        ... // logic to update the model
        return RedirectToAction(""Action2"");
    }

    public ActionResult Action2()
    {

        ... // logic to pull up the correct model
        return View(model)
    }

    ... // on and on and on for 74 more actions
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to reduce some of the constant redundancy that's in every one of the actions? Here is what I am thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a member variable Guid to store the appId and then overriding OnActionExecuting to populate this variable. Is this a good idea?</li>
<li>Implementing some kind of paging to cut down on the number of actions. Any suggestions on how to do that?</li>

<p>I would like to implement a notification system which shows stuff like ""X added you as a friend"", ""Y invite you to the party"", ""Z has taken the lastest quizz""... and i don't know how to do.</p>

<p>I wonder what is the best solution :</p>

<ul>
<li>Solution 1, aka ""logging"".</li>
</ul>

<p>A dedicated table ""notification"". I add rows in this table everytime something that rise a notification happend (friend adding, quizz answering, etc.). The table ""notification"" has fields that contains different information, according to what kind of notification is added to the table.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong> : easy to code, separation between notification feature and ""normal"" features, not too much resources-consuming when i need to read the table.</p>

<p><strong>Bad</strong> : Notification table will grow probably very big (i think I will add 10k rows/day in the table), ""duplicated"" information : informations in the notification table can be found in all other table using date/list/whatever comparison.</p>

<ul>
<li>Solution 2, aka ""look everywhere"".</li>
</ul>

<p>Everytime i need to show the notification list or the show how much new notifications there are, I look to all the concerned table, compare date/etc to know if something new happened since the last time the user checked the notification.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong> : Not a too big table compared to solution 1, no ""redundancy"" of information.</p>

<p><strong>Bad</strong> : I am affraid because of the number of user (~1k+), it make the server explode because it is resource/time consuming, little harder to code/maintain.</p>

<p>Can you please tell me what you think the better and why, or do you have a solution i didn't imagined ?</p>

Let's say i use a really basic DB design : users have friends, can do quizzes. 1 table for user list, quizz list, 1 table quizz&lt;->user relation, 1 table user&lt;->user for friendship.
Everytime a user visit his own profile, he can see what happened : new quizz&lt;->user relation, new user&lt;->user relation, etc. 
How would you design a notification like that ?</p>

<p>If I query by the 'ad_spot' and total 'view_count' for the six rows returned, dividing by six and taking the remainder would tell me which of the ads should be used.</p>

<p>I'm relatively new to the Visual Basic realm (although a traditional web based script developer), i've come to ask you a question.  I am reading data from an XML file.  This local XML file will be updated by another application, and I will need to periodically re-evaluate the XML file, and only import new data into a list box.  Furthermore, I want to be able to click on a particular item in the listbox, and display the other values about that particular XML entry.</p>

<p>So, I suppose this is a multi part question.  What is the proper way to import only NEW data into the program, what is the proper way to store the data, and how do I associate a value in a listbox with the data stored elsewhere?</p>

<p>I've considered multidimensional arrays, but have been told that strings to char arrays and then back to strings is a terrible way to manage the data, but was never offered an alternative.</p>

<p>I will be satisfied with a list of topics to study up on and/or an example for an answer to this question.</p>

Numbering the table 1 to 25 (lowest to highest precedence), I see the two key tokens used for composing lambda expressions: <code>fun</code> is non-associative 6, and <code>-&gt;</code> is right-associative 8. That is, <code>fun ... -&gt; ...</code>. This might be my first mistake in understanding, since I'm not even sure if precedence plays a role in the body of a lambda expression (the right hand side of <code>-&gt;</code>) I can only think of precedence playing a role in the entire expression, so I'll move on to there. According to this table, the sequence operator, <code>;</code>, has lower precedence, 4, than the <code>fun</code> ""operator"". Which I believe says that</p>

<pre><code>fun (x:int) -&gt; x + 3 ; 2;;
</code></pre>

<p>should be equivalent to </p>

<pre><code>((fun (x:int) -&gt; (x + 3)) ; 2);;
</code></pre>

<p>yet it is actually equivalent to </p>

<pre><code>(fun (x:int) -&gt; (x + 3 ; 2));;
</code></pre>

<p>I appreciate any help clarifying my interpretation of the rules of precedence given by the referenced table vs. the actual rules of precedence for lambda expressions! Thanks!</p>

<p>Obviously this isn't returning an actual error, just a web page telling me there was an error.
Have a missed a way to retrieve the actual error code from the service?
Is it possible that the service could be sending the error as a response somehow?</p>

I forgot to mention, the actual errorResponse is nil, I'm assuming because HTML was returned that the actual request is classed as successful.</p>

<p>This is all fine, I have no problem with any thing here. The only issue I have is I've had to create a div to wrap everything comments related in which is what wraps around the code in comments.php. I do this because I don't want to touch the /wp-includes files even though it includes comments_template.php which is where I'd like to stick mytheme-body, box and form styles as it's where it get's made.</p>

<p>The reason being is because when I go into wordpress and turn off comments for a page, I'm left with an empty box where the comments use to be, and this is highly annoying. Is there anything I could do to fix this?</p>

<p>A way to maybe assign additional classes just to one already created element? Can I totally make my own comments_template.php and not rely on the core one?</p>

I have tab-delimited file which the R sever script reads, this file contains 5 columns of data (Job_Types, Job_Order, Task_Number, Activity_Number, Activity_Type)
Here is how the data table would look like
Completed   JO_1    JO_1_TN_1   JO_1_TN_1_AN_1  Drawing

The user is provided an interface (pull-down menu) to select Job_Types, based on the Job_Types selected by the user the Job_Order Pull-down menu gets populated, now I want to populate the next pull-down menu of selection of Task_Number based on the Job_Order selection that the user makes, on similar lines I would want to provide the user the Activity_Number selection based on the Task_Number selection the user makes.
E.g: Say User Selects ""Current"" (Job_Types) from the first pull-down menu. 
The second Pull-down menu should have only JO_2 and JO_3 listed as option to select; now lets say user selects ""JO_2 and JO_3""
The third Pull-down menu should have only  JO_2_TN_1, JO_2_TN_2, JO_3_TN_1 Task number listed for selection, say the user selects ""JO_2_TN_1, JO_3_TN_1""
The Fourth Pull-down menu should have only JO_3_TN_1_AN_3 as options</p>

<p>I figured that there must be a memory leak, so I ran the server while monitoring it with JProfiler and noticed that when I get a peak in traffic, my memory usage shoots up (as expected), but then quickly drops back down.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the issue is less of a memory leak, and more that Glassfish expands its heap size when the spikes occur (this does seem to be happening) but never decreases the heap size when the actual memory usage declines.</p>

I would like to be able to introduce a new thread for every child node that I find with an iterator. I currently pass the node into the recursive method when I call it. I would like to be able to start a thread and tell that thread to call that method. How would I do something similar to saying new thread, thread.callMethod()? I need to have a Runnable interface and a run method apparently? However this seems to complicate things much more than necessary (I already have method names). Does anyone know a good way to do this using run(..), or does anyone know a better way to do this without using run(..). Thanks. </p>

<p>Thank you for your answers. I had been thinking that I need to somehoe get a new instance of a node running on a new thread, but that is not the case. The node just occupies space in memory and the thread is reference to the method code that is executed on the instance living in memory (my CS 302 TA is already disagreeing with me in my head). So.. I had been thinking about enums, but I was thinking that I might somehow need to have all my nodes running on separate threads during instantiation, or else, have the methods actually written in new classes that implement runnable. </p>

<p>In other words, </p>

<pre><code>public class TreeMethods implements Runnable
{

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>I am currently writing template for queue/buffer of variable-size records/objects with this signature:</p>

<pre><code>// current:
template &lt;typename R = byte, class Alloc = std::allocator&lt;byte&gt;,
  class... Opts&gt; class rqueue;
// what I want:
template &lt;class... Opts&gt; class rqueue;
</code></pre>

<p>I have few other possible options which I described like this:</p>

<pre><code>namespace tag {
    struct allocator {};        ///&lt; specify allocator for data storage
    struct virtual_offset {};   ///&lt; manage offset in virtual memory
    struct fill_empty {};       ///&lt; fill empty space (security or reconstruction)
    struct reconstructible {};  ///&lt; fill empty and leave one slot between wp&amp;rp
} namespace opt {
/// allocator for data storage
    template &lt;class Alloc&gt; struct allocator: tag::allocator {
        typedef Alloc type; };
/// type for offset in virtual memory
    template &lt;class Off&gt; struct virtual_offset: tag::virtual_offset {
        typedef Off type; };
/// type and value to fill empty space
    template &lt;class T, T V&gt; struct fill_empty: tag::fill_empty {
        typedef T type; static constexpr T value = V; };
/// make state pointers reconstructible by leaving one slot between wp&amp;rp
    template &lt;class T, T V&gt; struct reconstructible
      : tag::reconstructible, fill_empty&lt;T, V&gt; {};
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre><code>// basic queue for custom record class
rqueue&lt;record&gt;;
// advanced record storage that can be written to a file and reconstructed back
rqueue&lt;opt::virtual_offset&lt;unsigned&gt;, opt::reconstructible&lt;byte,0xFF&gt;&gt;;
// specialization for strings with custom allocator

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>I was searching the complex boost parameter / metaprogramming library and ended in <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/parameter/doc/html/reference.html#metafunctions"" rel=""nofollow""><code>metafunctions</code></a> which can do the same work as my small helper (and of course much more), but didn't find a solution for <strong><em>extracting untagged options by index.</em></strong></p>

<p><b><ol>
<li>Did I miss it? Is it there somewhere?</li>
<li>Can you offer me some different solution?</li>
</ol></b></p>

<p>Maybe I should just forget about it and stick with those tags, or write some complex helper to <strong>filter out all tagged options and acces those left by index</strong>... But before I surrender or go the long way, here is nice place to ask :)</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> If you refer to some library, leave a description how to use it, please. Thank you.</em></p>

<p>I created a class Tasks which shall update a <code>TextView</code> every second in the <code>BatteryStatus</code> Activity. I found out that there are two options to update the text:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pass reference to a Context interface</li>
<li>Make a getter function in the activity class</li>
</ol>

<p>For solution 1 I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>09-30 20:08:29.635: W/System.err(14515): android.view.ViewRoot$CalledFromWrongThreadException:      Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views.

<p>For solution 2 this error comes up:</p>

<pre><code>09-30 21:23:07.110: W/System.err(16344): java.lang.NullPointerException

Recently, the entire system came to a standstill during a big sale event because the payment gateway had some kind of problem, and responses from their API took 17 seconds to respond instead of the normal 2-3 seconds.  There were hundreds of people attempting purchases simultaneously.  This caused all of the web worker threads in every web server in the production cluster to get tied up waiting for API responses from the payment gateway.  The entire production cluster was locked up and could not serve any page.</p>

<p>One solution to this problem would be to use Resque to process the payments in the background.  The web servers would immediately return a response to the user that would say something like, ""Your payment is processing...""  The web server would be able to move on to the next web request.</p>

<p>The problem is continuing the checkout once the payment has been processed.  I can't use AJAX to poll for whether the transaction has completed, because many of the customers don't have JavaScript.  I can't depend on it.  I don't want to use JavaScript or any kind of server push technology with a low reliability rate because it would create an expensive customer support problem if a percentage of checkouts were to become stalled on the 'processing...' page.</p>

<p>How can I engineer the page flow so that the transactions can be processed in the background, reliably?</p>

<p>After trudging a bit on Google I found out that the gem <strong>activerecord-deprecated_finders</strong> seems to not have been released on Rubygems yet, which would explain that last error. <a href=""http://yehudakatz.com/2010/12/16/clarifying-the-roles-of-the-gemspec-and-gemfile/"" rel=""nofollow"">Yehuda Katz</a> suggests that these kind of dependencies can be declared on the Gemfile and would override the gemspec definition, which the good folks that develop Rails have indeed done:</p>

<pre><code># rails/Gemfile
...
gem 'activerecord-deprecated_finders', github: 'rails/activerecord-deprecated_finders', branch: 'master'
...
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried the suggestion of one of the commenters on Yehuda's post but it also didn't work:</p>

<pre><code># rails/Gemfile
...
@dependencies.delete_if{ |d| d.name == 'activerecord-deprecated_finders'  }
...
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm a bit of at a loss as to why the <code>bundle install</code> didn't go work. I found a reference to that gem on <code>activerecord/activerecord.gemspec</code> and commenting out that solves the issue but that hardly seems like an acceptable solution. Does anyone know where I might have gone wrong? I'm using Ruby 1.9.3p286 and Bundler 1.2.3.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: I saw plenty of info regarding this very gem while generating a new Rails 4.0.0.beta application, which is not what I'm trying to accomplish here.</p>

<p>I've done just that on the iOS side by using Google's gdata library (in combination with the public Calendar RSS) to parse and display the public calendar feed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, gdata is not compatible with Android.  Google has the new google-api-java-client libraries, but all the sample code is used in tandem with a google account living on the device that then authenticates through OAuth.</p>

At this point in time, replacing hardware is not an option, but we need to code such that we can see this video feed real-time regardless of any hardware or underlying operating system changes occur in the future.</p>

<p>Along this line, we've chosen Qt to implement a GUI to view this camera feed. However, if we move to a linux or other embedded platform in the future and change other hardware (including the physical device where the camera/video sampler lives), we will need to change the camera display software as well, and that's going to be a pain because we need to integrate it into our GUI.</p>

<p>What i proposed was migrating to a more abstract model where data is sent over a socket to the GUI and the video is displayed live after being parsed from the socket stream.</p>

<p>First, is this a good idea or a bad idea?</p>

<p>Secondly, how would you implement such a thing? How do the video samplers usually give usable output? How can I push this output over a socket? Once I am on the receiving end parsing the output, how do I know what to do with the output (as in how to get the output to render)? The only thing I can think of would be to write each sample to a file and then to display the contents of the file every time a new sample arrives. This seems like an inefficient solution to me, if it would work at all.</p>

<p>How do you recommend I handle this? Are there any cross-platform libraries available for such a thing?</p>

<p>Now here we have two queries. <strong>data</strong> and <strong>data1</strong></p>

<p><strong>data</strong> is simply querying one single table with a criteria and its returning results as expected. All good here.</p>

<p>But, in <strong>data1</strong>, it is also technically returning exactly the end result that I want BUT I also have a raw SQL logger in place to see what's happening behind the scenes and what it's doing is to query both ads table and resorts table separately using a <strong>select *</strong> equivalent statement and then when the results return from both tables, it's applying the joins within memory and returning the result after filtering through the where clause. So basically its scanning through around 100000 rows even though I have join and where clause in place and in the end, it returns one single row with ad id 413.</p>

<p>One thing to note down is that I'm calling <strong>Query</strong> method of the repository class while doing the join for <strong>data1</strong> which is returning an IEnumerable. I was not able to change it to IQueryable because then an exception was being thrown having some message like the linq query has references to different contexts.</p>

<p>Can anyone guide me to modify this code so that I can apply real sql joins between the repositories or if there's a way to modify this code by adding a middle layer to act as a bridge. I need something to go forward from this point. I've been looking everywhere but no avail. I'm sure that I'm not the first one ever in this world who could have this problem. There definitely would be others having similar issue and may be someone who have found a real way.</p>

<p>We have a server in our central office running SQL Server 2005 Enterprise that has several large (large in the sense that DSL is the limiting factor) databases that we need local copies of at each of our locations.  We currently have a few dozen locations, and are needing to bring even more online.  The total number of locations we'll need to sync these databases to will be in the several hundreds in the next 2 years.</p>

<p>We are trying to overcome issues with the WAN connection at each location.  These are DSL lines and the wiring at the locations isn't always the best.  We currently have issues with some of the locations going down as often as every hour.  While we are working to resolve these issues with rewiring and assistance from the local telcos, it mainly highlights the problem at hand: we need a two-way sync that can handle being occasionally-connected.</p>

<p>We tried transactional replication for a while, and while it worked some of the time, it was too high maintenance for us, and it seemed to randomly error out often with no possible explanations, forcing us to reinitialize subscriptions (which could take upwards of 4 hours assuming the location would stay connected long enough to get the entire snapshot in one go).  We've looked at rolling our own solution from scratch, but I don't feel this would be the best idea given the scale and reliability we are needing.</p>

<p>So far we've also looked at Sync Framework, and as suggested by someone else, Service Broker.  Sync Framework seems a better fit, but I was told that Service Broker scales better and is more reliable?  I can't find any empirical data on the overhead involved with Sync Framework or Service Broker, so it's proving impossible to compare the two in this regard.</p>

<p>What we really need is a two-way sync between the central office server and a remote client that can run autonomously and can report to an admin in the event of a failure that requires our intervention.</p>

<p>There are so many possible solutions to this problem, all involving completely different technologies, that I need a fresh eye on this.</p>

<p>What do you think would be the optimal solution for our situation, and why?</p>

<p>EDIT: Obviously, upgrading to SQL Server 2008 would solve this problem easily.  However, we would like to try to less expensive options first.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When creating a new record, ""waypoints"" does not appear in the view.</p></li>
<li><p>When updating a record that already has waypoints saved in the database, the ""waypoints"" multiple select box repeats in the view. For example, if I have saved three addresses as waypoints in the database, I get three multiple select boxes on the screen, each with a different option highlighted.

<p>I am providing valid hostname along with port(9160) in addContactPointsWithPorts. Also the hostnames are pingable.</p>

<p>PS:-  The following properties are already set in cassandra.yaml.</p>

After changing the port to 9042, I was able to connect to Cassandra. BUT I see that the connection is getting dropped by this exception soon after.</p>

"5501786","1","","","2011-03-31 14:52:03","","4","693","<p>I've created an iOS tab bar app with a navigation controller in one of the tabs. It uses a flip animation when it pushes or pops views from the stack (I found out how to do that <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2506647/iphone-flip-animation-when-controller-pushed/2917465#2917465"">here</a>).</p>

<p>It's looking great, except for a problem with the tab bar. The view at the root of the stack shows the tab bar, but for the next one I've set <code>hidesBottomBarWhenPushed</code> to <code>YES</code>. Pushing works great; the issue is popping back to the root view controller. My view flips from the left, except the tab bar, which slides in.</p>

<p>Here's my code for popping the view controller:</p>

<pre><code>[UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil];
[UIView setAnimationTransition:UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromLeft
                       forView:self.navigationController.view
                         cache:NO];
[UIView setAnimationDuration:flipDuration];
[self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:NO];
[UIView commitAnimations];
</code></pre>

<p>The weird thing is that if I comment out all except the fourth statement, the tab bar behaves itself - it doesn't slide in, it just appears instantly with the rest. For some reason, adding the transition has allowed the tab bar to say to itself, 'Well, everyone else is animated. Why shouldn't I be animated? But no poncy flipping for me. I think I'll stick to a slide.'</p>

<p>What can I do? Ideally, I'd like the tab bar to flip in with the rest, but I'd also be happy with it fading in afterwards.</p>

I'm working on a project where I have an excel report file of sales for the past year.  I can read this and find the information I need just fine, but I can't figure out how to get the number of sales for a particular item (SKU) each day without using a bunch of nested for loops.  I know there has to be an easier way, but I can't think of one at the moment.</p>

<p>For example, there's a bunch of information on 30,000 items that have sold over the past year.  I have created an array of 'Item' objects that pulls and sets string values for 'sku' and 'timestamp' (when the purchase was made).</p>

<p>Now I have to cycle through this and check how many items were sold each day, but I'm not for sure what the best way of doing this is.</p>

<p>My Item array could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>//item[0] ; sku=""AKD123""; timestamp=""2012-02-01"";
//item[1] ; sku=""REN134""; timestamp=""2012-02-01"";
//item[2] ; sku=""PIK383""; timestamp=""2012-02-01"";
//item[3] ; sku=""REN134""; timestamp=""2012-02-01"";
</code></pre>

<p>There are about a million other items in this array, but from this, you can see that AKD123 sold 1, REN134 sold 2, PIK383 sold 1.  I'm not for sure how to get this output.    There has to be some sort of array method that can help me sort this in to day figures, but that may cause another problem because if a particular sku sold 0 units on 2012-02-01 then it wouldn't show up on the excel report.  I also don't know how many different skus there will be on a given report, so that's troubling me as well.</p>

<p>Code would be fantastic, but even a recommendation on what I need to search for would be great.  I feel like I should already know how to do this, but I'm lacking sleep and haven't been able to figure it out for the past 2 hours without VERY time consuming nested for loops, so I decided to turn to the community.</p>

Which also is a block. I have a working collision between the two objects and it works. However, when the bullet hits the enemy it should go away. And when all enemies are ""killed"" you win. This is basicly what I got so far.</p>

<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Enemy&gt; enemy;
ArrayList&lt;Bullet&gt; bullets;

[...]

public void collision (){

    for(Bullet b : bullets){

        Rectangle r1 = b.getBounds();

        for(Enemy e : enemy){

            Rectangle r2 = e.getBounds();

            if(r1.intersects(r2)){

                enemy.remove(e);

            }

        }

    }

<pre><code>else if(mark == 'E'){
    enemies.add(new Enemy(x * 20 + 10, y * 20 + 35, 40));
}
</code></pre>

<p>So when you hit the enemies with a bullet i get a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException firstly at <code>for(Enemy e : enemy){</code></p>

<p>However if I hit the enemies in a specific order I am able to delete all but 1 enemy. And then the error occurs. The collision method is placed in the ""gameloop"".</p>

<p>I have a design question (sort of). I have a set of machines against which users can perform tasks. Each task may take about 5-20 minutes to finish on the machine. Any number of users can perform tasks - however, they may not care if their tasks are queued and are not performed instantly.</p>

<p>As a software developer, I would like to limit the number of tasks that I execute to 10 per batch to prevent crashing the end system. This was what I was thinking would be my way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>a) Submit all jobs/tasks to a file.
b) Daemon wakes up every x minutes, checks if there is work to be performed.
b) Get 10 jobs that were submitted earliest and spawn processes to handle the tasks.
c) Daemon sleeps, wakes up again after x minutes and checks how many additional tasks can be performed (given that some of the 10 tasks may still be running), launches the corresponding tasks and goes back to sleep.

<p>Basically, i'm writing a little sockets client that is making a connection to a sockets based server. After scouring the web, I finally found what I believe is the right approach - to make use of the NSStream functionality.</p>

<p>In my attached view controller code (which is attached to a basic view with a couple of labels), the code works, in that it connects and can receive data from the server; the println() call in the stream function works.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is that as soon as my application receives any data, it seems to block the UI. I do see the data in the All Output window, but my interface is no longer working. For example, I have a button (as part of the navigation controller), that works until I receive data...</p>

<p>The error has been fixed by setting <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. The question is how and why? What am i missing? Why is <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> required when my installation looks just fine.</p>

<p>There was a problem with Runnable, so there were acually TWO game threads running at the same time. (Equals problem!) So the second thread that hit the audio player made the error, and thats why it sounded echoy- it was playing from two different threads!</p>

<p>I also am using SourceDataLine, as suggested, to enable longer sound clips.</p>

<p>Original post-</p>

<hr>

<p>When this code fires, an error pops up saying</p>

<p><code>IllegalStateException: Mixer is already open</code></p>

<p>at the <code>clip.open()</code> line. I have put in every measure to check if the code is being ran twice, it is not. However, even with the error, the sound still plays. On longer clips (30 seconds) it sounds like theres 2 sounds playing, one right after the other. On REALLY long clips (3 minutes) the sound stutters.</p>

<p>(<code>stringFile</code> is a <code>String</code>, such as <code>""example.wav""</code>)</p>

<pre><code>File soundFile = new File(stringFile);
AudioInputStream inputStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(soundFile);
AudioFormat format = inputStream.getFormat();
DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(Clip.class, format);
clip = (Clip) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
clip.open(inputStream);
clip.start();

After various combinations, I followed <a href=""http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/sourcedocs/xml-catalogs.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/sourcedocs/xml-catalogs.xml</a> by using just catalog variable, like:</p>

-s systemId     Sets the system identifier.
-a              Makes the system URI absolute before resolution
-u uri          Sets the URI.
-d integer      Set the debug level.

                doctype, document, entity, notation, public, system,
                or uri.

<p>Currently I am trying to implement the user store in a relational database using Play's Ebean. I found that <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16093023/play-securesocial-persistance-with-java"">this SO anwser</a> does not apply anymore. Therefore, I am rolling my own implementation. Token store was quite simple, however I am having problems with storing the user profiles.</p>

<p>This is my entity:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class DbUser extends Model {

  @EmbeddedId
  public DbUserId id;

  @ManyToOne
  public DbUser mainProfile;

  @OneToMany(mappedBy = ""mainProfile"")
  public Set&lt;DbUser&gt; profiles;

  public String firstName;
  public String lastName;
  public String fullName;
  public String email;
  public String avatarUrl;

  @Constraints.Required
  public AuthenticationMethod authMethod;

  public OAuth1Info oAuth1Info;
  public OAuth2Info oAuth2Info;

  public PasswordInfo passwordInfo;

  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the ID entity:</p>

<pre><code>@Embeddable
public class DbUserId {

  @Constraints.Required
  public String providerId;

  @Constraints.Required
  public String userId;
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I understand this is probably not the ideal way to go, translating between this and SecureSocial's Option'ed fields is painful to say the least.</em></p>

<p>I have adapted the <code>InMemoryUserService</code> to work with these entities and even guessed how the <code>doLink()</code> method should work. I am, however, having problems with running this. Right before the new evolution should be applied I get the following error:</p>

<p><em>In other words can the sub class detail be 'lazy' loaded.</em></p>

<p>I have a class heirarchy mapped using fluent nhibernate and ClassMap/SubClassMap mapping classes. Each derived class (most of them anyway) have their own table. So it's a table per concrete class.</p>

<p>I have not specified discriminator values because they are used when all the sub classes are contained in the same table. I do however have an integer value in the base class table that indicates which type it is. Is nhibernate capable of using this data and issuing a lazy load for the derived class data. The discriminator value is an integer in the database that corresponds to an enum in the base class.</p>

<h3>example.</h3>

<pre><code>public sealed class PartyMap : ClassMap&lt;Party&gt;
{
  public PartyMap()
  {
     Table(""Party"");
     // I thought this might do it, but it doesn't :-(
     Polymorphism.Explicit();
     Id(x =&gt; x.Id).Column(""PartyId"");
     Map(x =&gt; x.PartyType).CustomType&lt;PartyType&gt;().Column(""PartyTypeId"");

     // to be in the base class table, above Table(...) is the only one used.
     // DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;int&gt;(""PartyTypeId"", 0).AlwaysSelectWithValue();
   }

<p>As It's mentioned in spring documentation the <a href=""http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#csrf-timeouts"" rel=""nofollow"">CSRF timeout</a> is an issue that should be handled. One way to handle this scenario is to have custom AccessDeniedHandler where we an intercept CSRF exception. Something like: </p>

<pre><code>static class CustomAccessDeniedHandler extends AccessDeniedHandlerImpl{

    @Override
    public void handle(HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response,
            AccessDeniedException accessDeniedException)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        if (accessDeniedException instanceof MissingCsrfTokenException
                || accessDeniedException instanceof InvalidCsrfTokenException) {

            //What goes in here???

        }

        super.handle(request, response, accessDeniedException);

    }
}

<p>If I move all 3 fragments together this does not occur.</p>

<p>I have made a simple application to demonstrate this issue, perhaps someone can shed some light on a solution. Here are the relevant files:</p>

<p>I don't know how to access those elements on the iPad (Movies and iTunes U).</p>

<p>I've played with everything mentionned in the Apple documentation ""IPod Library Access Programming Guide"":</p>

<ul>
<li>MPMediaItem</li>
<li>MPMediaPickerController</li>
<li>MPMediaQuery</li>
<li>MPMoviePlayerController
…etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I was close with MPMediaItem and MPMediaQuery, as two of the Flags seemed promising:</p>

<p>MPMediaTypeMovie        = 1 &lt;&lt; 8
MPMediaTypeVideoITunesU = 1 &lt;&lt; 12</p>

<p>However, all the results I get only include songs.</p>

<p>Am I using the right classes to access those items?  Considering the results I get, it seems like those classes can only access media items which are part of the iPod library, which I am not sure is the case for Movies and iTunes U videos.</p>

<p>I know that this is possible, because I've seen another app which accesses it (It's called ""VideoPix"").  It presents the ""Video Library"" in a Popover view, so at first I suspected it was using the MPMediaPickerController, because on the iPad, you can only use it in a Popover, but again, when I tried it, all I saw was songs, no Movies or iTunes U items :(</p>

<p><em>I might have the complete wrong approach on this, so please tell me if I should do this differently.</em></p>

<p>I send an event from my Android app to track DB load times. </p>

<ul>
<li>Event Category: 'DB'</li>
<li>Event Label: 'DBLoadTime'</li>
<li>Event Value: 2356 (Or however long the DB took to load in
milliseconds)</li>

<p>In Analytics I would like to get a table view of all the different load times, listed under each other. From the analytics <a href=""https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide#Values"">documentation</a> I could see that they seem to accumulate all the event values as they are received. This means I can only get the total value, or an average value. however, they also use a similar example to what I have, where they use the event value to store 'doanload time' for a video.</p>

<p><strong>My question</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is this at all possible, or are values from similar event labels accumulated by default, and there is no way to get them listed as separate values.</li>
<li>If it is not possible, how can I get this info? Maybe by sending the load time as an event label?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why I need to know:</strong></p>

<p>Highest value does not really serve me any purpose, as there might be one guy with one really slow device experiencing long load times, where the 2nd longest load time is already half of that.
Average value does not tell me much either, as there are many people trying the app out, with just one or two records in the DB, which will always load fast.</p>

For authenticating into the service, I have a PEM pair of key-certificate files. I'm using a slightly expanded version (see the bottom) of <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577548-https-httplib-client-connection-with-certificate-v/"" rel=""nofollow"">this client</a> to connect to the service.</p>

<p>My issue is: After processing the contents of a request, I will issue further requests over the same socket/connection. The code structure goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>conn = HTTPSClientAuthConnection(""a host name"", 443,
                                 key_file=a_key_file,
                                 cert_file=a_cert_file,
                                 ca_file=None)

full_page, response = conn.do_request(the_main_url)
further_requests = process_page(full_page)

for ref in further_requests:
    new_data, response = conn.do_request(ref)
    print process_data(new_data)
</code></pre>

<p>The annoyance is that for every invocation of <code>do_request</code>, the passphrase for the cert/key pair is requested. <strong>How can I</strong> make that persistent? I'm attempting to implement this client with only Python's stdlib, as the machines I'll be running it are not easily modified. But if that's not possible, a good library suggestion is welcome as well...</p>

<pre><code>$ python get-ssl-data.py 
Enter PEM pass phrase: &lt;I enter the passphrase&gt;
&lt;the first request has no output to stdout&gt;

Enter PEM pass phrase: &lt;I enter the passphrase&gt;
&lt;output of this step&gt;

Enter PEM pass phrase: &lt;I enter the passphrase&gt;

<p>Currently, when i add a Sitecore user, for example 'UserA' to multiple target audiences, lets say 'TargetAudience_A' and 'TargeAudience_B', after I send out these two target audiences, 'UserA' clicks the link in the email which comes from 'TargetAudience_A', then the link will bring user to the site, user visits several pages, Sitecore Analytics will be able to track 'UserA' VisitPageCount and Value, and creates the corresponding campaign of 'TargetAudience_A' with that data. </p>

<p>When the user opens the email sent from 'TargetAudience_B' and clicks the link, visits the site, <strong>NO</strong> campaign is created for 'TargetAudience_B' in the database, I can see all the data should use to create a new campaign for 'TargeAudience_B' is used to update campaign of 'TargetAudience_A'.</p>

<p>The whole link in the sent email has been modified by Sitecore, the corresponding campaign id is added, which makes the link looks like this:'httP:xx.domain.com/?ec_camp=xxxx&amp;ec_as=xxxx'.  </p>

<p>It seems that Sitecore just adds an Id to the url, but does not create a campaign for the 'TargeAudience_B' with that Id. </p>

<p>I use this sql query to check the visits data:</p>

<pre><code>  Select * From Visits join Automations on Visits.CampaignId = Automations.CampaignId
  Where Automations.data = '{EmailTemplateId}'
</code></pre>

<p>the data column on Automations table is the email template id of the target audience.</p>

<p>Does any one know, how to track one user's activities for multiple campaigns? Is this possible to do? Or is this something which needs to be fixed by Sitecore?</p>

<p>Any help will be much much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Sitecore <strong>does</strong> create <code>Campaign</code> for each target audience, but <strong>does not</strong> create <code>Visits</code> record for every one of them; Sitecore associates <code>Campaign</code> with the <code>Visits</code>, Sitecore cannot find\create <code>Visits</code> of 'TargeAudience_B', it finds the <code>Visits</code> of 'TargeAudience_A',  for some reason it just updates the <code>Visits</code> record of 'TargetAudience_A'. </p>

<p>This does look right, does Sitecore create just one visit for a visitor a day no matter how many target audience this visitor in?</p>

<p>I have a helper.php file that includes the string:</p>

<pre><code>$specific_fields_text = '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""key""&gt;'.$specific_field_title.': &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""kr_sidecol_subaddress""&gt;'.$specific_fields[$i]-&gt;text.' '.$specific_fields[$i]-&gt;description.'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>In my template override is the code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table border=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" cellspacing=""0""&gt;
  &lt;?php echo koparentHTML::getHTMLSpecificFields($this-&gt;specific_fields); ?&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The output is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table border=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" cellspacing=""0""&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=""key""&gt;title&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=""kr_sidecol_subaddress""&gt;value&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=""key""&gt;title&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=""kr_sidecol_subaddress""&gt;value&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
    //.....etc......//
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I want to get rid of the table and turn it into a definition list but I cannot modify the helper.php file. I am thinking that the answer is to do with str_replace</p>

<p>I have tried using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;?php
    $spec_fields = koparentHTML::getHTMLSpecificFields($this-&gt;specific_fields);
    $spec_fields_dl = str_replace(""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class='key'&gt;'.$specific_field_title.': &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='kr_sidecol_subaddress'&gt;'.$specific_fields[$i]-&gt;text.' '.$specific_fields[$i]-&gt;description.'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;'"", ""&lt;dt class='key'&gt;'.$specific_field_title.': &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class='kr_sidecol_subaddress'&gt;'.$specific_fields[$i]-&gt;text.' '.$specific_fields[$i]-&gt;description.'&lt;/dd&gt;'"", $spec_fields);
    echo $spec_fields_dl;
  ?&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This returns all of the text but with no html tags (no tr, td, dt, etc).</p>

Making things fixed an scroll to an anchor is not the problem. </p>

<p>The problem is that my nav is almost on the bottom of the screen. So what happens if you scroll down the nav gets a <code>fixed</code> class. When then clicking an anchor link the script scrolls to far to the anchor block. I tried offsetting the nav to the height of the navigation. That works but only when you click a second time on the same link. First time clicking an anchor link still makes the link scroll too far!</p>

<p><strong>I created a Fiddle to explain what happens -> <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/meules/wcmoLe5j/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">Fiddle</a></strong></p>

<p>I personally think that the scrollTo and making the nav fixed at the same time is interfering with each other.</p>

<p>Does anybody know what can cause this?</p>

<p>What I have is this:</p>

            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#reviews"" class=""goSmoothly""&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#related"" class=""goSmoothly""&gt;Related products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""description"" class=""block""&gt;description&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""reviews"" class=""block""&gt;reviews&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""related"" class=""block""&gt;related&lt;/div&gt;

var fixmeTop = $('.anchor-links').offset().top;

$(window).scroll(function() {
    var currentScroll = $(window).scrollTop();
    if (currentScroll &gt;= fixmeTop){
        $('.anchor-links').addClass(""sticky"");
    } else {

<p>I've looked at a number of solutions however they all seem to be related to WinForms or web <em>application</em> projects or other technology slightly different than what I'm using, so I haven't figured out how apply them.</p>

<p>The application is like a discussion.  It's a web <em>site</em> project based on code originally written under VS2005, and there's no budget (or personal talent!) for major changes at this time.  The app is written in vb.net; I can understand answers in c#. I'm working in VS2013.</p>

<p>The app has three typed datasets pointing to one MDF, call it ""MainDB.mdf"".  There are dozens of tableadapters among the three datasets.  </p>

<p>I'm going to deploy the app it as an ""alpha/demo"" version.  I would like to use the same code base for all users, and a separate physical version of MainDB for each user, to reduce chances that the users crash each other.</p>

<p>The initial demo access URL will contain query string information that I can use to connect the user with the right physical database file.  I should be able to identify the database name and thus the connection string parameters from the query string information (probably using replace on a generic connection string).  If necessary I could use appsettings to store fully formed connection strings, however, I would like to avoid that.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to change the connection strings for all the datasets at the time that the entry point pages for the app are accessed.  </p>

<p>Changing the tableadapter connection strings at each instantiation of the tableapters would require too much code change (at least a couple of hundred instantiations); I'd just make complete separate sites instead of doing that.  That's the fall back position if I can't dynamically change the connectionstrings at runtime (or learn some other way to make this general scheme work).</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to approach this would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Per comments, here is a sample instantiation of tableadapter</p>

<pre><code>    Public Shared Sub ClearOperCntrlIfHasThisStaff( _
    varSesnID As Integer, varWrkprID As Integer)

    Dim TA As GSD_DataSetTableAdapters.OPER_CNTRLTableAdapter

    Dim DR As GSD_DataSet.OPER_CNTRLRow
    DR = DB.GetOperCntrlRowBySesnID(varSesnID)

    If IsNothing(DR) Then
        Exit Sub
    End If

    If DR.AField = varWrkprID Then
        DR.AField = -1
        TA.Update(DR)
        DR.AcceptChanges()
    End If

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE:  Below is the test code I tried in a test site to modify the connectionString in a single instantiation of a tableadapter.  It feeds a simple gridview.  I tried calling this from Page_Load, Page_PreLoad, ObjectDataSource_Init, and Gridview_Databind.  At the concluding response.writes, the wrkNewConnString looks changed to TestDB2, and the TA.Connection.ConnectionString value looks changed to TestDB2, but the displayed gridview data is still from TestDB1.  Maybe it needs to be called from somewhere else?</p>

<pre><code>Sub ChangeTableAdapter()

<p>UPDATE:  the following post has lots of solutions, however, they seem to focus on web application projects, that have a project file with settings, which this web site project does not. </p>

<p>UPDATE:  this next link was brought to my attention, and in working on it I did get it to work, however, it still relies either on having a web application project (with project file) or modifying each table adapter as they are instantiated.  So, while I'm not going to implement it, I believe that is the technical answer.</p>

<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13631908/flask-sessions-not-persisting-on-heroku"">Flask sessions not persisting on heroku</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12915989/flask-session-not-persisting"">Flask session not persisting</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13614877/flask-login-and-heroku-issues"">Flask-Login and Heroku issues</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Except I'm not dealing with AJAX or multiple workers here (it's a single heroku free dyno, with a single line in the Procfile). I do get the feeling that using <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/75/"" rel=""nofollow"">server side sessions with redis</a> or switching from Heroku to something like EC2 might solve my problem though.</p>

<p>Also, here's my git repo if it helps <a href=""https://gitlab.com/collectqt/quirell/tree/develop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.com/collectqt/quirell/tree/develop</a>. And I'm testing session stuff with</p>

<p>What this servlet is doing is simply get a user id from the main jsp page and then run an object which connects to the database and pulls out all the required information. All this is working sweet. Now by pull, what I mean is that when the user clicks the lookup button on main jsp, it should run(not redirect) to servlet, the servlet will do all the above and then display the info it has obtained in the textboxes in the main jsp.</p>

<p>Right now my problem is, that the main thread does not wait for the two background tasks that check if username or email already exist, but keeps going so every user object is sent to the server, even though they already exist. </p>

<p>Here is my code to check username and email: </p>

System.out.println(emailadressInUse);

        }

    }

<p>same goes for checking the username. This works fine. The problem is, boolean emailadressInUse does not change fast enough for the main thread to change action. </p>

<p>here is the method that initiates those two methods </p>

<pre><code>public void submitNewUser(View view){
    EditText edittext1 = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.chose_username);
    EditText edittext2 = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.chose_realname);
    EditText edittext3 = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.chose_emailadress);
    EditText edittext4 = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.chose_password);

    username = edittext1.getText().toString();
    realname = edittext2.getText().toString();
    emailadress = edittext3.getText().toString();
    password = edittext4.getText().toString();

    checkUsername(username);
    checkEmailadress(emailadress);



    }
</code></pre>

<p>this is called from inside checkEmail. The two booleans should have changed state by now. And according to System.out.println in checkEmail they did. So why is my method finishSubmittingUser not picking up on that change?</p>

<p>I have a ViewFlipper which has 50 pictures (random frequence of 4 pictures) in ImageViews. Then I have 4 Buttons with the same 4 pictures which can appear in the ViewFlipper.</p>

<p>The task is to click the right button when the right picture appears.
(When Picture 1 appears Button 1 has to be pressed and so on)</p>

<p>My Problem is I don't know how to get the displayed ImageView id.</p>

<pre><code>flipper.getCurrentView().getId() 
</code></pre>

<p>gives me ""-1"" as Id. But I want to have the Id of ""R.drawable.pic1""</p>

<p>My code so far:</p>

<p>my Loader-Method:</p>

<pre><code>protected void loadPicturesIntoFlipper() {

    Random generator = new Random(); 
    pictures = new ArrayList();

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 50;i++){

        int number = generator.nextInt(4) + 1;

        if(number == 1){
            pic = R.drawable.pic1;

        }

        pictures.add(pic);  
    }


    for(int i=0;i&lt;pictures.size();i++)
    {

        setFlipperImage((Integer) pictures.get(i));
    }



}

<p>My Insert-Method:</p>

<pre><code>private void setFlipperImage(int res) {

    image = new ImageView(getApplicationContext());
    image.setBackgroundResource(res);
    flipper.addView(image);
}

<p>My Check-Method :</p>

<p>I thought it should be enough to check <code>GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()</code>, but obviously it isn't. This is the code snippet were it goes wrong:</p>

<pre><code>if(!GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()) {
    final UIDefaults lookAndFeelDefaults = UIManager.getLookAndFeelDefaults(); // SwingFont.java:50
    if (lookAndFeelDefaults!=null) {

<p>I tried in the following in Hudson:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Setting Java Options to <code>-Djava.awt.headless=true</code> in the ""Build"" section</p></li>
<li><p>Entering a line ""java.awt.headless=true"" in the Build Properties</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All of that doesn't work. It seems those are only passed on to <code>ant</code>, but not onwards when invoking <code>java</code> to run the JUnit tests.</p>

<p>Is there any way to tell ant that I want my tests be run in headless mode? </p>

I am working on re-implementing a version of the histogram approximation found in Section 2.1 of <a href=""http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/ben-haim10a/ben-haim10a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a>, and I would like to get all my ducks in a row before beginning this process again. Last time, I used <code>boost::multi_index</code>, but performance wasn't the greatest, and I would like to avoid the logarithmic in number of buckets insert/find complexity of a <code>std::set</code>. Because of the number of histograms I'm using (one per feature per class per leaf node of a random tree in a random forest), the computational complexity must be as close to constant as possible.</p>

<p>A standard technique used to implement a histogram involves mapping the input real value to a bin number. To accomplish this, one method is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>initialize a standard C array of size N, where N = number of bins; and</li>
<li>multiply the input value (real number) by some factor and floor the result to get its index in the C array.</li>
</ol>

<p>This works well for histograms with uniform bin size, and is quite efficient. However, Section 2.1 of the above-linked paper provides a histogram algorithm without uniform bin sizes.</p>

<p>Another issue is that simply multiplying the input real value by a factor and using the resulting product as an index fails with negative numbers. To resolve this, I considered identifying a '0' bin somewhere in the array. This bin would be centered at 0.0; the bins above/below it could be calculated using the same multiply-and-floor method just explained, with the slight modification that the floored product be added to two or subtracted from two as necessary.</p>

<p>This then raises the question of merges: the algorithm in the paper merges the two closest bins, as measured from center to center. In practice, this creates a 'jagged' histogram approximation, because some bins would have extremely large counts and others would not. Of course, this is due to non-uniform-sized bins, and doesn't result in any loss of precision. A loss of precision does, however, occur if we try to normalize the non-uniform-sized bins to make the uniform. This is because of the assumption that m/2 samples fall to the left and right of the bin center, where m = bin count. We could model each bin as a gaussian, but this will still result in a loss of precision (albeit minimal)</p>

<p>So that's where I'm stuck right now, leading to this major question: <strong>What's the best way to implement a histogram accepting streaming data and storing each sample in bins of uniform size?</strong></p>

<p>I hacked some code a long time ago, which (I think) worked on an earlier version of emacs, but it does not work any more on emacs 23 that I use now (It might be possible that I messed up the code).</p>

<p>The difficulty at the time I wrote it was that the number was large to be handled as one argument for certain functions, so I had to divide it, do something, and put them together. For example, if you give a large number to <code>string-to-number</code>, it gives back a float even though I want an integer.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a rewrite of it?</p>

<p>Following is the broken code that I wrote. It does not work, but may give you an idea of what I am trying to do. First, these are all subroutines that are used below:</p>

<pre><code>(defun seconds-since-origin ()
    (string-to-number (concat
        (number-to-string (- (string-to-number
            (substring (format-time-string ""%s"") 0 5)
         ) 10000))
    (substring (format-time-string ""%s"") 5)
)))

(defun hexatridecimal (decimal)
(concat
    (let ((quotient (/ decimal 36)))    (if (&gt; quotient 35)
        (hexatridecimal quotient)
        (hexatridecimal-digit quotient)
    ))
    (hexatridecimal-digit (% decimal 36))
))

(defun hexatridecimal-digit (number)
    (nth number (list
""0"" ""1"" ""2"" ""3"" ""4"" ""5"" ""6"" ""7"" ""8"" ""9"" ""a"" ""b"" ""c"" ""d"" ""e"" ""f"" ""g"" ""h"" ""i"" ""j""
    ""k"" ""l"" ""m"" ""n"" ""o"" ""p"" ""q"" ""r"" ""s"" ""t"" ""u"" ""v"" ""w"" ""x"" ""y"" ""z""))
)
</code></pre>

<p>The following will be the main function that will be called:</p>

<p>However, I can't seem to find one that allows to set options per image. The auto/random thing is nice, but that doesn't work for every image.</p>

<p>I would love to see something that would allow to set the effects in the markup. Maybe something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""kbslider""&gt;
    &lt;li class=""left-right fade""&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<pre><code>$('#dialogNewCrm input, #txtNotes, .riTextBox').focusin(function() {

$('#dialogNewCrm input, #txtNotes, .riTextBox').focusout(function () {

<p>The <code>.riTextBox</code> is the class assigned to the RadDatePicker control. I tried adding an alert to the functions and it hits the alert, so I know the event functions are firing correctly. I also used the Chrome debugger to inspect the controls. On all my textbox controls, the class is being added, but just not the <code>.riTextBox</code> control.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions? Everything seems to be okay, but its simply not applying the class to the control. This leads me to believe that maybe its firing my event, applying the class, then Telerik might have their own <code>focusin</code> event handler thats firing after my event and its clearing all CSS styles and applying their own. If this is the case, my question should probably be, is there a way to make my event fire last, after Telerik's?</p>

Differences are in file permission. On R2 server has access to file Application pool identity (e.g. ""MyWebSite""), but on R1 only IIS_IUSRS with ""Special permission"".</p>

<p>I'm asking this as from my current (weak) understanding of how reading / writing to launched processes work, it surely looks as it attaches the input / output streams to my program's console input / output stream.</p>

<p>Is this, indeed, the case? If that's the case, then reading/writing different data to several launched command lines would prove complicated, if not impossible, not achieve.</p>

<p>Is my understanding correct? How to deal with several launched command lines?</p>

<p>For example, I have a 60+ mB file. I read all of it into a scintilla box, let's call it sci_log. The program is using roughly 200mB of memory with this and other features. This is still acceptable (and less than the amount of memory used by Notepad++ to open this file).</p>

<p>I have another scintilla box, sci_splice. The user inputs a search term and the program searches through the file (or sci_log if the file length is small enough--it doesn't matter because it happens both ways) to find a regexp.match. When it finds a match, it concatenates that line with a string that has previous matches and increases a temporary count variable. When count is 100 (or 150, or 200, any number really), then I put the output in sci_splice, call GC.Collect(), and repeat for the next 100 lines (setting count = 0, nulling the string).</p>

<p>I don't have the code on me right now as I'm writing this from my home laptop, but the issue with this is it's using a LOT of memory. The 200mB mem usage jumps up to well over 1gB with no end in sight. This only happens on a search with a lot of regexp matches, so it's something with the string. But the issue is, wouldn't the GC free up that memory? Also, why does it go up so high? It doesn't make sense for why it would more than triple (worst possible case). Even if all of that 200mB was just the log in memory, all it's doing is reading each line and storing it (at worst).</p>

<p>After some more testing, it looks like there's something wrong with Scintilla using a lot of memory when adding lines. The initial read of the lines has a memory spike up to 850mB for a fraction of a second. Guess I need to just page the output.</p>

<li>simpleXml_load_file</li>
<li>simplexml_load_string</li>
<li>Converting the simpleXML object to an array</li>
<li>Converting simpleXML to cache</li>

<p>I am using simpleXML to parse a very large XML document that will return relevant search results requested by users. </p>

<pre><code>$XMLproducts = simplexml_load_file(""products.xml"");
</code></pre>

<p>Along with ultimately producing requested search results, the simpleXML request will also produce links to further refine the obtained search results …</p>

<pre><code>foreach($XMLproducts-&gt;product as $Product) {
if ($user_input_values == $applicable_xml_values) {
// all refined search filter links produced here, then displayed later
$refined_search_filter_Array1[] = URL code + (string)$Product-&gt;applicable_variable;
$refined_search_filter_Array2[] = URL code + (string)$Product-&gt;applicable_variable2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>… as well as help produce search results pages (because there will be 20 search results per page).</p>

<pre><code>foreach($XMLproducts-&gt;product as $Product) {
//coding to produce pages number links for the search results pages number
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then we ultimately get to the actual search results requested by the user:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($XMLproducts-&gt;product as $Product) {
if ($user_input_values == $applicable_xml_values) {
echo $Product-&gt;name ……    
}}
</code></pre>

<p>Since the user can click on a number of refined search filter links as well as page number links to go to the next search results page, is it correct that it would be more constructive to turn the initial simpleXML request into an array or into cache until the user finishes using the search results? This way, when the user clicks on a refined search filter link or clicks on a link to go to the next search results page, s/he would be accessing the array or cache to do so, instead of loading the entire XML file (with another simpleXML request) to do so.</p>

<hr>

<p>What's happening is when I click off the textField -OR- when I hit return on the keyboard, then the tableView seems to scroll to whatever I set in keyboardWillHide, but then immediately afterwards it will quickly scroll up to where the tableView is completely up and offscreen.</p>

<p>I tried setting the animation of <code>setContentOffset</code> to 2.0f seconds in <code>keyboardWillHide</code>, to see what happens, and this will cause the contentOffset I specify to scroll over 2 seconds, but then immediately afterwards it will shoot offscreen.</p>

<p>Something is scrolling the tableView after my code scrolls it but I have no idea what it is.</p>

<p>However I don't understand how the <em>debian/packagename.dirs</em> files relate to what goes in the <em>debian/rules</em> file. I tried downloading and looking at the source package for freedict, which is very similar to what I want to do, but its rules file is very complex.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate a bit, Given two components A and B and A uses B, then we have a certain ""upwards-contract"" for B and a certain ""downwards-contract"" for A. Basically this means: If A uses B correctly and B behaves correctly, then both contracts will be fulfilled and things will work correctly. </p>

<p>I think mocks are a way to guarantee a subset of an upwards-contract that is required for a given testcase. For example, a database connection might have the upwards contract to retrieve data records if they have been inserted earlier. A database connection mock guarantees to return certain records, without requiring their insertion into the database.</p>

<p>However, I am currently wondering if there is a way to verify the downwards-contract as well. Given the example of the database connection, the downwards-contract might be: You must connect to the database and ensure the connection exists and works and enter correct SQL-Queries. </p>

<p>Does anyone do something like this? Is this worth the work for more complicated contracts? (For example, the database connection might require an SQL-parser in order to completely verify calls to the database layer)</p>

<p>So what i am trying to do is enable each Test object to store a value in the jni using setValue and get getValue, using this c++ code.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;jni.h&gt;
#include ""Test.h""
int value;

JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_Test_setValue(JNIEnv *, jobject, jint newValue)
{
value = newValue;
}

JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Java_Test_getValue(JNIEnv *, jobject)
{
return value;
}

<p>However, the problem is that when i use setValue on test2 and then i print test1's value it has changesd to what i set test2 to.  How do i fix this.  I tried mapping each jobject to an int value but that did not work either.</p>

I'm trying to align an image to the top right side of my page, with title text on the top left.</p>

<p>I can do this, but when I resize the browser window the image always wants to overlap the title text before either of them resize. If I remove the margins that I've used to place the image then the image sits under the title text (and to the right) instead of just to the right of it, but I feel removing this (while keeping the positioning) might be key. I do need the image to be overlapped by some other elements though.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of my code for the image:</p>

<pre><code>img#site-logo {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    clear: both;
    position: relative;
    z-index: 0;
    margin: -12.87em 2em -16em 0px;
}

<pre><code>#site-title a {
    font-size: 4.875em;

<p>No better explanation than some GIFS :</p>

<p><a href=""http://fredericborrel.com/pro/Android4.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">Android 4</a></p>

<p>I have a custom ArrayAdapter where I display questions. Each item has its own layout depending on its type :</p>

<ul>
<li>Numeric value : Label + Numeric EditText</li>
<li>Text value : Label + EditText multi row</li>
<li>Boolean value : Label + Checkbox</li>
</ul>

<p>Every item of the Array Adapter is inflating the same exact layout by overwriting <em>getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)</em>. I just show or hide the fields depending on the question's type by using <em>setVisibility(true)</em> or <em>setVisibility(false)</em>.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent){
    mView = convertView;
    if(mView == null){
        LayoutInflater mLayoutInflater;
        mLayoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(getContext());
        mView = mLayoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.item_liste_question,null);
    }

    final Question mQuestion = getItem(position);
    if(mQuestion != null){

        TextView tvQuestion = (TextView) mView.findViewById(R.id.tv_question_nom);
        EditText questionNombre = (EditText) mView.findViewById(R.id.et_question_nombre);
        EditText questionTexte = (EditText) mView.findViewById(R.id.et_question_texte);
        CheckBox questionBool = (CheckBox) mView.findViewById(R.id.cb_question_bool);

        tvQuestion.setText(mQuestion.getQuestionLB());

        if(mQuestion.getTypeReponse().equals(""Num"")){
            questionTexte.setVisibility(View.GONE);
            questionNombre.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            questionBool.setVisibility(View.GONE);
        }
        else if(mQuestion.getTypeReponse().equals(""Text"")){
            questionTexte.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            questionNombre.setVisibility(View.GONE);
            questionBool.setVisibility(View.GONE);

        else if(mQuestion.getTypeReponse().equals(""Bool"")){
            questionBool.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            questionNombre.setVisibility(View.GONE);
            questionTexte.setVisibility(View.GONE);
        }
    }
    return mView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But when I click on a EditText field, the Keyboard is showing up, reducing the screen's size, forcing the ArrayAdapter to withdraw items that are out of the screen. Here, nothing wrong, but those views are recycled and reused mixing the old layout with the new one.</p>

<p>For example : I have 5 initially questions :</p>

<ul>
<li>Question1 - EditText (Numeric)</li>
<li>Question2 - EditText (Numeric)</li>
<li>Question3 - EditText (Numeric)</li>
<li>Question4 - EditText (Multilines)  </li>
<li>Question5 - Checkbox</li>
</ul>

<p>I click on the first Question and here is what I obtain :</p>

<ul>
<li>Question1 - EditText (Numeric) + Weird ghost field</li>
<li>Question2 - EditText (Numeric)</li>
<li>Question3 - EditText (Numeric)</li>
<li>Question4 - EditText (Multilines)  </li>
<li>(Question5 - Checkbox OUT OF THE SCREEN)</li>
</ul>

<p>After a lot of test, I realized that because the fifth question is going out of the screen, when I try to edit the first one, the convertView will give me the recycled view of the fifth question. And despite the fact that I am reformatting it as I wish, I still have this mysterious ghost field that mess with my keyboard (not numeric as I would wished).</p>

<p>What can I do to have the same proper behavior I have on Android 5+ on Android&lt;5?</p>

<p>What is the best way to accomplish this?</p>

<p>With modified code like the following? (lines marked with ""//new"")</p>

<pre><code>ConcurrentQueue&lt;TaskClass&gt; cq = new ConcurrentQueue&lt;TaskClass&gt;();
for (int x = 0; x &lt; TaskList.Count; x++)
    cq.Enqueue(TaskList[x]);

List&lt;TaskClass&gt; NewTaskList = new List&lt;TaskClass&gt;(); //new
object lockObject = new Object(); //new

Parallel.For(
    0,
    cq.Count,
    new ParallelOptions { MaxDegreeOfParallelism = DISystem.MaxConcurrentThreads },
    x =&gt;
    {
        TaskClass tc = null;
        if (cq.TryDequeue(out tc))
        {
            TaskTypeManager ttm = new TaskTypeManager();
            tc.Working = true;
            tc.Started = DateTime.Now;
            ttm.ProcessTaskItem(tc);
            lock (lockObject) //new
            {
                NewTaskList.Add(tc);
            }
        }
    }
);

NewTaskList.Sort(); //new
TaskList.Clear(); //new
TaskList = NewTaskList.ToList(); //new
</code></pre>

Users are able to upload some images and videos. Uploading media is a two step action, first user uploads the file and receives an ID then in a separate request uses that ID to refer to the media (for example (s)he can use it as profile picture or use it in a chat message). </p>

<p>I need to know <em>who</em> is uploading the media for both HMAC authentication middleware and setting owner of media in database. All other requests are in JSON format and include a <code>username</code> field that it used by HMAC middleware to retrieve the secret shared key.</p>

<p>It first came to my mind that media upload api may look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""username"":""mjafar"",
  ""datetime"":""2015-05-08 19:05"",
  ""media_type"":""photo"",
  ""media_data"": /* base64 encoded image file */
}
</code></pre>

<p>But i thought that base64 encoding may have significant overhead for larger files like videos; or there may be some restrictions on size of data that can be parsed in json or be created in user side. (This webservice is supposed to communicate with a Android/iOS app, they have limited memory)! Is this a good solution? Are my concerns real problems or i shouldn't worry? Better solutions?</p>

I want to, as a coding exercise, write a short method that will generate a Ruby file containing either a few method definitions or, ideally, an entire class or module definition.</p>

<p>I was thinking that perhaps just building up a string representation of the file and then merely writing it out might be a way to accomplish that, but that way doesn't really necessitate the use of metaprogramming, and since my goal is a metaprogramming exercise, I would like to figure out a way to incorporate it into that process or else do it another way.</p>

<p>I guess, if I was to take the string-building approach, I would like to start with something like</p>

<pre><code>klass_string = ""class GeneratedClass\n\t&lt;BODY&gt;\nend""

<p>and then somehow save the output of something like this</p>

<pre><code>define_method( :initialize ) do

end
</code></pre>

<p>in a string that could replace '' in <code>klass_string</code> and then written out to a file. I know I could just put the above code snippet directly into the string, and it would workout fine, but I would like to have the output in a more standard format, as if it'd been written by hand and not generated:</p>

<pre><code>class GeneratedClass
  def initialize

<p>This is working fine. However, since this is a favorite button when I present the screen second time and it contains some items that are favorite to begin with, I want to change the default from <code>heart</code> to <code>heart_pressed</code></p>

<p>I tried doing it programmatically like this in <code>getView</code> of my <code>ArrayAdapter</code>, however, with this I lose the ""toggle"" capability of the button. </p>

<pre><code>if (item.isFav())

else
         holder.hButton.setBackgroundDrawable(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.ic_heart));

<p>The <code>%setup</code> command successfully unfolds compressed folder under <code>%{_topdir}/BUILD/</code>. Then I copied these files to <code>%{buildroot}</code> (because <code>%files</code> tag was expecting files to be present under <strong>BUILDROOT</strong> to package).

My understanding is that I need to setup the environment variables correctly.</p>

  <p>Class templates also have injected class names, However, they are stranger than ordinary injected class names: They can be followed by template arguments (in which case they are injected class template names ), but if they are not followed by template arguments they represent the class with its parameters as its arguments (or, for a partial specialization, its specialization arguments).</p>

"32187102","1","32189952","","2015-08-24 16:22:04","","0","28","<p><strong>The question:</strong>
Is there any way to write a type annotation in TypeScript that allows any object literal, but doesn't allow built-in types <code>number</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>Function</code> or <code>Array</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>I have been working on improving some type definitions on DefinitelyTyped for some libraries I am using on my projects at work.  A common pattern I have noticed in many JS libraries is to pass an 'options' object used to configure the library or plugin.  In these cases, you will often you will see type definitions looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>declare module 'myModule' {
    interface IMyModule {
        (opts?: IOptions): NodeJS.ReadWriteStream;
    }
    interface IOptions {
        callback?: Function;
        readonly?: boolean;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>var myModule = require('myModule');
myModule();
myModule({});
myModule({ callback: () =&gt; {} });
myModule({ readonly: false });
myModule({ callback: () =&gt; {}, readonly: false });
</code></pre>

<p>Which all are valid use cases.  The trouble is that these type definitions also allow for these non-valid use cases:</p>

<pre><code>myModule('hello');
myModule(false);
myModule(42);
myModule(() =&gt; {});
myModule([]);
</code></pre>

<p>In many cases, the above calls would result in a runtime error, as the library JS code may try to set default values on the object, or pass the options to another library.  Although I have tried many things, I haven't been able to constrain the parameter to accept only objects and not any of those other invalid cases.</p>

<p>It seems that if you have an interface with only optional members (as no one option is required), the compiler will widen acceptable types to accept <code>any</code>.</p>

<p>You can see a TypeScript Playground demonstration of this problem here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1Js7tLr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1Js7tLr</a></p>

<p><strong>Update: An example of a solution that doesn't work</strong></p>

<pre><code>interface IOptions {
    [name: string]: any;
    callback?: Function;
    readonly?: boolean;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This attempt requires an indexing operator to be present on the object, which means that it now complains about <code>number</code>s, <code>string</code>s, <code>boolean</code>s, <code>Function</code>s, and <code>Array</code>s.  But this creates a new problem:</p>

<pre><code>var opts = {};
myModule(opts);
</code></pre>

<p>This now fails when it should be a valid scenario. (See this in Playground: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1MPbxfX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1MPbxfX</a>)</p>

There, I had to code a web page in PHP with Drupal, that needed to get data from another site by RSS. What happened was that there was no way to get the data beforehand: the data depended on the content of the page which itself was dynamic, so the page stopped loading for a couple of seconds while PHP went to get the RSS data. That was bad. The page depended on a couple of parameters out of a huge list. So fetching all possible combinations in davance was out of the questions. It was some sort of search page, that included the results of a sister site, I think.</p>

<p>The first thing I did to improve that was to set up a caching system. When the page was loaded, it launched a Javascript method that saved the RSS data back into the database for this specific page, using AJAX. That meant that if the same page was requested again, the old data would be sent immediately. and the AJAX script would get the cache updated with the new data, if needed. The Javascript pretty much opened a hidden page on the site with a GET instruction that matched the current page's parameters. It's only a couple of days later that I realised that I could have cached the data without the AJAx. (Trust me, it's easier to spot in hindsight.) But that's not the issue I'm asking about.</p>

<p>But I was told not to do any caching at all. I was told that my AJAX page ""exposed the API"". That a malicious user could hit the hidden page again and again to do a Denial of Service attack. I thought my AJAX was a temporary solution anyway, but that caching was needed. But mostly: <strong>wasn't the DoS argument true of ANY page on the site?</strong> Did the fact that my hidden page did not appear in the menus and returned no content make it worse?</p>

<p>As I said, there was a lot of competition between programmers, so the people around me, who were unanimous, might have been right, or they may have tried to stop me from doing something that was bad because they were not the ones doing it. (It happened a lot.) But I'm still curious. I was fully aware that my AJAX thing was a hack. I wanted to change that system as soon as I found something better, but I thought that no caching at all was even worse. Which was true? Doesn't, by that logic, ALL AJAX expose the API? If we look past the fact that my AJAX was an ugly hack, was it really that dangerous?</p>

<p>I'll admit again and again that it was an ugly, temporary fix, but my question is about having a ""hidden"" page that returns no content that makes the server do something. How horrible is that?</p>

<pre><code>Order ID    Client ID   Amount  
1           100001        10

7           100001        6

<p>The result should be:</p>

4            100001       33    100001C         33

<p>Here, if we can also come up with a way to ad orders numbered 5,6,7 to joined order 10001B it would be great. But even this solution will be enough.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion</strong>: </p>

<ol>
<li>Fedora 17 seems to use new ""firewalld"" for GUI which I dont care about. I just want to use a shell script.</li>
<li>If the server has both IPV4 and IPV6, will rules applied to IPV4 automatically apply to IPV6 too or do I have to run separate rules? I want them to be shared. </li>
<li><p>I downloaded the ""puppetlabs-firewall"" module - and it refers to <code>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</code>  which I dont find in fedora. Also it only refers to RedHat|CentOs and not fedora:</p>

<pre><code>exec { ""persist-firewall"":
    command =&gt; $operatingsystem ? {
    ""debian"" =&gt; ""/sbin/iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4"",
    /(RedHat|CentOS)/ =&gt; ""/sbin/iptables-save &gt; /etc/sysconfig/iptables"",
  }
  refreshonly =&gt; true,
}
Firewall {
  notify =&gt; Exec[""persist-firewall""]
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>I am open to using either puppet (will be preinstalled) or bash but <strong>I just want a simple script that initializes a server with a master set of ports (maybe allowed IPs) that I provide</strong>. If this works also for amazon linux, its a bonus.</p>

<p>Idempotent script would be best!</p>

<p>May seem quiet simple to some experts, but lot can go wrong with lot at stake for novices like me :)

I've got the function to remove punctuation working perfectly and I'm fairly certain my insert code works properly, but I can't seem to get around the line number part. I've included this section of my code as follows:</p>

<p>The problem seems to be related to the <code>stringstream</code>. It doesn't seem to clear when I use <code>keystream.str("""")</code>. This particular method only seems to read line 1 in and then exits the loop, whereas some other variations I've tried (I can't remember exactly what I did) read the entire file but don't flush the <code>stringstream</code> so it reads like word 1, word 1, word 2, word 1, word 2, word 3, etc..

<p>This redirects to the tab.matches-detail view as expected but a back button is not present. I would like the back button to redirect back to the parent view being <code>tab.matches</code>, or the view I originally redirected from. If I navigate from <code>tab.matches</code> to <code>tab.matches-detail</code> (when I have not redirected by <code>$state.go</code>) the back button is present. I however am going direct to <code>tab.matches-detail</code> when <code>$state.go</code> is called. As such I can no longer access <code>tab.matches</code> as if I click on another tab and then return to <code>tab.matches</code> it displays <code>tab.matches-detail</code> with no way to access the parent state of <code>tab.matches</code>. I can't figure out how to get the back button to display. I need this to be controlled from the controller rather than a href in the view as I need to call similar functionality from an Actionsheet where the logic is all controller side.</p>

<p>I've got a site with a couple of fancybox galleries (link <a href=""http://www.izzyhodge.com/portfolio"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). The client wants a like button on each image, which will link back to that specific image. As the site is live I've taken down the like button for now.</p>

<p>I've added anchor links to each image so I can open them from a URL no problem - like so <a href=""http://www.izzyhodge.com/portfolio/index.html#image01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.izzyhodge.com/portfolio/index.html#image01</a>. I can also get the actual like button up no problem, as I'm already using a bit of java to add the ""poem"" hover over thing (it just includes the contents of a bunch of divs in respect to each image). However, when I add a like button using the Facebook code, not only does it add another like button on the next image in a different position, but the button likes the main portfolio page not the anchor link.</p>

<p>The only solutions I could find for using an anchor link with the Facebook button used meta tags in the header of the liked page, which of course I can't do. </p>

<p>I'd really appreciate some help with this one! BTW, I'm using Fancybox 2.0, and I'm using the HTML5 method of adding a button (not sure if I have to change doctype for this?).</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm now trying to do this using the Social Buttons JSfiddle here, however I'm using the alt tag as the title and I'm not sure how to combine the two pieces of code. My JS now looks like:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
  $("".fancybox"").fancybox({
   helpers : { 
    title : { type : 'inside' }
   }, // helpers
       beforeShow : function() {
            if (this.title) {         
                // New line
                this.title += '&lt;br /&gt;';

                // Add FaceBook like button
                this.title += '&lt;iframe src=""//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=' + this.href + '&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;show_faces=true&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;font&amp;amp;colorscheme=light&amp;amp;height=23"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none; overflow:hidden; width:110px; height:23px;"" allowTransparency=""true""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';
            }
        var alt = this.element.find('img').attr('alt');

        this.inner.find('img').attr('alt', alt);

        this.title = alt;

        var toolbar = ""&lt;div id='tools'&gt;"" + $(""#appendContent div"").eq(this.index).html() + ""&lt;/div&gt;"";

   $("".fancybox-inner"").append(toolbar);
}
  }); // fancybox
 }); // ready
</code></pre>

<p>If I remove;</p>

<pre><code>this.title = alt;
</code></pre>

<p>I get a div which appears about the right size for the like button, but there's nothing in it! This could be due to my custom title formatting in the CSS. </p>

<p>HTML for Fancybox:</p>

<pre><code>                &lt;div id=""thumb-container""&gt;

<p>I should note that $upass is already in MD5 when pulled from the database, hence the reason I only MD5'd the username. No matter what I try I cannot get them to match at all. </p>

In Visual Studio, double-click this warning (or select it and press Enter) to fix the conflicts; otherwise, add the following binding redirects to the ""runtime"" node in the application configuration file:

  &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On our development machines and current build servers, we don't receive the error. But on some brand new build machines we're setting up, we're seeing it. I'm thinking this could be related to .NET 4.5.1 or the new separated out MS Build tools package?</p>

I have included a binary within my app before, that app is in the Mac App Store but this unix binary is giving me troubles.</p>

<p>I have compiled 2 different versions of this binary on a i386 machine and the other on x86_64 machine. 
Using ""file appname"", I get for the 64 bit binary </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64</p>

<p>and the 32 bit binary</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mach-O executable i386</p>

<p>At runtime I try to execute the correct binary but I noticed doesn't seem to matter? Which binary I use, I can execute the x86_64 on and i386 machine and things work fine.</p>

<p>My application build settings are what comes with the default project (standard 32/64 bit intel).</p>

<p>The question is should I attempt to run the 32 bit binary when I the app is running on an i386 machine?<br>

The problem with this, however, is that I can't seem to reach the level of ambiguity necessary. The sample code I have is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt; typename T, typename... Arguments&gt;
struct FunctionPtrWrapper
{
    FunctionPtrWrapper(T(*funcIn)(Arguments...), Arguments... args)
    {
        funcPtr=std::bind(funcIn, args...);

    void go()
    {
        funcPtr();
    }
    std::function&lt; T(Arguments...)&gt; funcPtr;
};
</code></pre>

<p>It compiles fine and even runs when passed functions without arguments, but when passing a function that requires arguments, it will fail to compile if go() is called, so that:</p>

<pre><code>FuctionPtrWrapper&lt;void&gt; pointerOne(&amp;foo);
pointerOne.go();
</code></pre>

<p>works perfectly, but:</p>

<pre><code>FunctionPtrWrapper&lt;void, char&gt; pointerTwo(&amp;foo, 'c');
pointerTwo.go();
</code></pre>

<p>Fails to compile with the following error:</p>

<p><code>error: no match for call to '(std::function&lt; void(char)>) ()</code></p>

<p>Which I assume means that somehow in the constructor, the argument fails to expand and pass to the call to std::bind. Is this a syntactical error, misuse of the used functions or simply not possible?</p>

//or
await ReleaseAsync(tasks.ToArray());

<p>However, recently I have been noticing some strange behavior and set to see if there was a problem with the ReleaseAsync method. I managed to narrow it down to this simple demo, it runs in linqpad if you include <code>System.Threading.Tasks</code>. It will also work slightly modified in a console app or in an asp.net mvc controller.</p>

<pre><code>async void Main()
{
 Task[] TaskArray = new Task[]{run()};

<p>What I don't understand is why the Exception never shows up anywhere. I would have figured that if the Tasks with the exception were awaited, it would throw. I was able to confirm this by replacing the while loop with a simple for each like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach( var task in TaskArray )
{
  await task;//this will throw the exception properly

<p>There is one for Size and Colour. This can change depending on the product, e.g. a curtain might have a size, length and colour (three select menus).</p>

<p>The array is created dynamically (based on each select menu and its options): </p>

<pre><code>var dynamicArr = [],
    i,
    j,
    opt,
    $('.select');

for (i = 0; i &lt; select.length; i += 1) {

<p><strong>My problem starts here. A dynamic array might have a length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (depending on the select options on the page). I therefore can't do this as there won't always be two selects</strong></p>

for (i = 0; i &lt; dynamicArr[1].length; i += 1) {

<p>How would I go about finding out the length and looping individually like the above e.g. if there are three selects, it will automatically know there are this many and loop through them like above.</p>

I'm a little embarrassed in asking this because I'm certain it's something simple I'm just overlooking but it's one of those kind of ""don't know what you're looking for to search for a solution"" kind of things, so I'm turning to you all and your talents.</p>

<p>The ""origin: '123 Easy Street' will always be hard coded, so that isn't a problem.   The problem is the ""destination: "" which I would like to populate with the information getaddress.php pulls from the database, which looks like ""1234 Easy Street 46142"" in the HTML body.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get that address string into the ""destination: "" portion of the route variable in the JavaScript?</p>

<p>I graciously appreciate any alternative ideas you all can suggest.  I'm stumped.</p>

  MiniProfilerEF6.Initialize();

}
protected void Application_EndRequest() {
  MiniProfiler.Stop();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the default <a href=""https://github.com/MiniProfiler/dotnet/blob/master/StackExchange.Profiling/WebRequestProfilerProvider.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">WebRequestProfilerProvider</a>, which stores the actual profile object in <code>HttpContext.Current.Items</code>.</p>

<p>When I ask for <code>MiniProfiler.Current</code>, it looks to <code>HttpContext.Current</code>.</p>

<p>When I make a request for one of my web api URLs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Application_BeginRequest</code> creates the profiler, store it in <code>HttpContext.Current</code></li>
<li>in a web api <code>MessageHandler</code>, I can see <code>HttpContext.Current</code></li>
<li>in a web apu <code>IActionFilter</code>, <code>HttpContext.Current</code> is now null, and my attempt to <code>MiniProfiler.Current.Step(""controller:action"")</code> fails</li>
<li>my EF queries run from various services do not get recorded, as that miniprofiler hook relies <code>MiniProfiler.Current</code>, which relies on <code>HttpContext.Current</code>, which is null right now</li>
<li><code>Application_EndRequest</code> fires, and <code>HttpContext.Current</code> is magically back, and so it wraps up the profiler and tells me how long it's been since the request began</li>
</ul>

<p>I dug through the code, and I can create my own <code>IProfileProvider</code>, to store the profiler object somewhere more reliable than <code>HttpContext.Current</code>, but I don't know where that could be.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours trying things out, but couldn't find a workable solution. The problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>IProfileProvider</code> is a global variable; all worker threads in either the MVC or Web API pipeline all have to use the same <code>IProfileProvider</code></li>
<li>I can dig around in web api RequestContext.Properties to pull out the HttpContext for that request, but that doesn't really help because my <code>IProfileProvider</code> is global across the entire app; If I tell it to store the profile in HttpContext A, then any simultaneous requests for other HttpContexts are going to pollute the profile</li>
<li>I can't rely on any kind of threadstorage because of async/await re-using threads dynamically</li>
<li>I can't stick the profiler object in an Ninject binding with <code>InRequestScope</code> because <code>InRequestScope</code> doesn't seem to work with web api 2.1, but even if I could</li>
<li>everyone says <code>HttpRequestMessage.Properties</code> is the new <code>HttpContext.Current.Items</code>, but again, <code>IProfileProvider</code> is a global variable and I don't know of a way to ensure each request is looking at their version <code>HttpRequestMessage</code>. <code>MiniProfiler.Current</code> can be called from anywhere, so I guess a global <code>IProfileProvider</code> would have to somehow inspect the call stack to and find an <code>HttpRequestMessage</code> there? That sounds like madness.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm at a loss. What I really want is a <a href=""http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/CommonLISP/HyperSpec/Body/dec_special.html"" rel=""nofollow"">special variable</a>.</p>

<p>I made a small Flash file using AS 3.0, and this is the first time I've really been able to stick to the OOP way of doing things and not hack together a mix of stuff from the timeline to get around not having everything work in the classes.</p>

<p>So I'd like to keep it that way, but one thing is eluding me: I can't call a method of an instance of another class (than the one I'm calling from) without resorting to ""DocumentClass(root).instanceName.method.""</p>

<p>Intuition tells me there has to be a better way of doing this (like, without having to reference the document class every time I call another class instance's function; and CERTAINLY without having to use the word ""root"" - that just seems so Flash 5 to me.</p>

<p>Consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>An existing defined class that derives from an abstract base class ""interface"".</li>
<li>Class is a part of a library that is compiled into multiple dlls that talk to each other through the interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then add:</p>

<ul>
<li>A second ""interface"" from which the defined class would now be derived (so now it has two interfaces).</li>
<li>New virtual methods to the defined class that are accessed by the new interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do I need to recompile every dll that links this library, or only the dlls that use the new methods?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>My original interface exposes a dynamic method which is <code>Dynamic(int OP, void* args)</code> would it be possible to add an op that casts to the new interface? </p>

<p>How does COM manage to add new interfaces to objects without corrupting the existing interfaces? Does it stack interfaces, use multiple-inheritance, etc???</p>

<p>Let me lay out the way this works.</p>

<p>Statically Linked Library Interfaces</p>

<pre><code>In statically linked library

class Interface1
{
    virtual Method1() = 0;
    virtual Method2() = 0;
}
class NotReallyInterface2 : Interface1
{
    virtual Method1() = 0;
    virtual Method2() { // does something }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In dlls</p>

<pre><code>In A.dll

Load statically linked library
class A : NotReallyInterface2
{
    virtual Method1() { // does something }
}

In B.dll

Load statically linked library
class B: NotReallyInterface2
{
     virtual Method1() { // does something different }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to add</p>

<pre><code>class Interface3
{
     virtual Method3() = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have some problem here because my inheritance structure looks like.</p>

<pre><code>[a.dll [ library : Interface1 &lt; NotReallyInterface2 ] &lt; A ]
[b.dll [ library : Interface1 &lt; NotReallyInterface2 ] &lt; B ]
</code></pre>

<p>so I'm afraid</p>

<pre><code>[ a.dll [ library : Interface1 &lt; NotReallyInterface2 ] &lt; Interface3 &lt; A ]
</code></pre>

<p>won't work.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>So I found my problem. Apparently, other dlls and executables are referencing my <code>NotReallyInterface2</code>. This means that multiple dlls and exes are building the same base class. So if those ""copies"" of the base class get out of sync, down goes the ship. Which means I can't change a single method signature in <code>NotReallyInterface2</code>.</p>

<p>This would have worked had no one referenced <code>NotReallyInterface2</code> and I now get that out of the answers and the whole thing makes sense.</p>

<p>As such, I already have this script:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $('img.KeikkaNuoli').click(function() {
        if(this.src == ""images/Arrow.png"")
        {
            this.src = ""images/Arrow2.png"";

            this.src = ""images/Arrow.png"";
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Idea is, that when the user clicks the image, AKA arrow, it flips down and shows the list. However, as it happen, at the moment this script does not work. Image does not change between two. if I set if statement as if(this.src = ""images/Arrow.png"") then it will work the first time, but refuses to work the second time.</p>

<ol>
<li>Real threads are preallocated according to the pool capacity. The actual work is free to use the standard .NET thread pool, if needed to spawn concurrent tasks.</li>
<li>The pool must be able to return the number of idle threads. The returned number may be less than the actual number of the idle threads, but it must not be greater. Of course, the more accurate the number the better.</li>
<li>Queuing work to the pool should return a corresponding <code>Task</code>, which should place nice with the Task based API.</li>
<li><strong>NEW</strong> The max job capacity (or degree of parallelism) should be adjustable dynamically. Trying to reduce the capacity does not have to take effect immediately, but increasing it should do so immediately.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rationale for the first item is depicted below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The machine is not supposed to be running more than N work items concurrently, where N is relatively small - between 10 and 30.</li>
<li>The work is fetched from the database and if K items are fetched then we want to make sure that there are K idle threads to start the work right away. A situation where work is fetched from the database, but remains waiting for the next available thread is unacceptable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last item also explains the reason for having the idle thread count - I am going to fetch that many work items from the database. It also explains why the reported idle thread count must never be higher than the actual one - otherwise I might fetch more work that can be immediately started.</p>

<p>It is a very simple implementation and it appears to be working. However, there is a problem - the <code>BJEThreadPool.Run</code> method does not accept asynchronous methods. I.e. my implementation does not allow me to add the following overloads:</p>

<pre><code>public Task Run(Func&lt;CancellationToken, Task&gt; action)
{
    return Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; action(m_cts.Token), m_cts.Token, TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach, m_ts).Unwrap();
}
public Task Run(Func&lt;Task&gt; action)
{
    return Task.Factory.StartNew(action, m_cts.Token, TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach, m_ts).Unwrap();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The pattern I use in <code>InternalTaskScheduler.RunInline</code> does not work in this case.</p>

<p>So, my question is how to add the support for asynchronous work items? I am fine with changing the entire design as long as the requirements outlined at the beginning of the post are upheld.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I would like to clarify the intented usage of the desired pool. Please, observe the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if (pool.IdleThreadCount == 0)
{
  return;
}

foreach (var jobData in FetchFromDB(pool.IdleThreadCount))
{
  pool.Run(CreateJobAction(jobData));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>The code is going to be run periodically, say every 1 minute.</li>
<li>The code is going to be run concurrently by multiple machines watching the same database.</li>
<li><code>FetchFromDB</code> is going to use the technique described in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3641703/using-sql-server-as-a-db-queue-with-multiple-clients"">Using SQL Server as a DB queue with multiple clients</a> to atomically fetch and lock the work from the DB.</li>
<li><code>CreateJobAction</code> is going to invoke the code denoted by <code>jobData</code> (<strong>the job code</strong>) and close the work upon the completion of that code. The job code is out of my control and it could be pretty much anything - heavy CPU bound code or light asynchronous IO bound code, badly written synchronous IO bound code or a mix of all. It could run for minutes and it could run for hours. Closing the work is my code and it would by asynchronous IO bound code. Because of this, the signature of the returned job action is that of an asynchronous method.</li>
</ol>

<p>Item 2 underlines the importance of correctly identifying the amount of idle threads. If there are 900 pending work items and 10 agent machines I cannot allow an agent to fetch 300 work items and queue them on the thread pool. Why? Because, it is most unlikely that the agent will be able to run 300 work items concurrently. It will run some, sure enough, but others will be waiting in the thread pool work queue. Suppose it will run 100 and let 200 wait (even though 100 is probably far fetched). This wields 3 fully loaded agents and 7 idle ones. But only 300 work items out of 900 are actually being processed concurrently!!! </p>

<p>My goal is to maximize the spread of the work amongst the available agents. Ideally, I should evaluate the load of an agent and the ""heaviness"" of the pending work, but it is a formidable task and is reserved for the future versions. Right now, I wish to assign each agent the max job capacity with the intention to provide the means to increase/decrease it dynamically without restarting the agents.</p>

<p>Next observation. The work can take quite a long time to run and it could be all synchronous code. As far as I understand it is undesirable to utilize thread pool threads for such kind of work.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>There is a statement that <code>TaskScheduler</code> is only for the CPU bound work. But what if I do not know the nature of the work? I mean it is a general purpose Background Job Engine and it runs thousands of different kinds of jobs. I do not have means to tell ""that job is CPU bound"" and ""that on is synchronous IO bound"" and yet another one is asynchronous IO bound. I wish I could, but I cannot. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>At the end, I do not use the <code>SemaphoreSlim</code>, but neither do I use the <code>TaskScheduler</code> - it finally trickled down my thick skull that it is unappropriate and plain wrong, plus it makes the code overly complex.</p>

<p>Still, I failed to see how <code>SemaphoreSlim</code> is the way. The proposed pattern:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task Enqueue(Func&lt;Task&gt; taskGenerator)
{
    await semaphore.WaitAsync();
    try
    {
        await taskGenerator();
    }
    finally
    {
        semaphore.Release();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Expects taskGenerator either be an asynchronous IO bound code or open a new thread otherwise. However, I have no means to determine whether the work to be executed is one or another. Plus, as I have learned from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25654498/semaphoreslim-waitasync-continuation-code"">SemaphoreSlim.WaitAsync continuation code</a> if the semaphore is unlocked, the code following the WaitAsync() is going to run on the same thread, which is not very good for me.</p>

<p>Anyway, below is my implementation, in case anyone fancies. Unfortunately, I am yet to understand how to reduce the pool thread count dynamically, but this is a topic for another question.</p>

<p>I'm writing an application where performance is very important. (Specifically: A raytracer)</p>

<p>I want to have an option for something called ""Adaptive Supersampling"" in my program. It's fairly simple to implement but I want to have an option to turn it on or off. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I only see two options, which are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put an if/else around two separate procedures (which are fairly similar) like so:</p>

<pre><code>void renderLoop() {
    if(adaptive) {
        doAdaptiveLoop();
    } else {
        doNormalLoop();
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Put specialized if/else statement scattered around the code.</p>

<pre><code>void renderLoop() {
    if(adaptive) something();
    else somethingElse();

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; LOOP_1; i++) {
        if(adaptive) something1();
        else somethingElse1();

        for(int j = 0; j &lt; LOOP_2, j++) {
            if(adaptive) something2();
            else somethingElse2();
        }
    }
    //... So on and so forth
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these methods are fairly terrible. Method 1 repeats a lot of code, and Method 2 is both messy and inefficient. Both of them make it very difficult to add on many features. If I want to add more features, I have to add more if/else statements at a factorial rate with Method 1, and in a very confusing way in Method 2.</p>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>I've run across this problem many times in performance dependent applications, but I've never really been able to solve it.</p>

<p>The questions is: How do I add toggleable features to my program which is centered around many loops, whose performance will decrease with many boolean tests, and whose code will become messy with those tests?</p>

<p>Now, everything works fine except I cannot get a list of checked items from the list when I click the button. And what I actually need is a list of city_IDs from the checked items so that I can start a new thread to delete them from the database.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to do this? I have searched through StackOverflow questions and other tutorials, but I can't seem to make it work.</p>

<p>I'm writing a program in C# (or VB) that will require a rules engine to calculate a set of dynamic properties on a set of objects retrieved from a DB <strong>based upon rules that are external to the program</strong>.</p>

<p>So, for example, suppose I have a list of, say, 250,000 objects / records returned from a DB. 
Each of which has 20 set properties / values that I need to run through a rules engine to calculate a further 15 dynamic properties (per object).</p>

<p>Each of those 15 dynamic properties will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use complex logic such as <code>If / Then</code>, <code>Between x and y</code>, <code>BeginsWith()</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Be based upon some of the other 20 original / 14 dynamically created properties (so the program would need to order the calculations if, say, <code>DynamicPropertyA</code> was reliant on the value obtained for <code>DynamicPropertyB</code>, then <code>DynamicPropertyB</code> would have to be calculated first)</li>
</ol>

<p>to obtain its value.</p>

<p>And, what I'm looking for, is not to hard-code these rules into the program, but, rather, to have them in a file / table separate from the program that is parsed in at run-time, so any rule updates would not require re-coding / re-compilation.</p>

<p>Also, of course, since this would be run over a large dataset, it would be GREATLY preferred that the rules are compiled once at the start rather than re-processed on a record-by-record basis.</p>

<p>I've looked into <a href=""http://www.richard-banks.org/2007/08/how-to-use-windows-workflow-rules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Windows Workflow Rules engine</a> and other tools such as <a href=""https://csharpeval.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">C# Expression Evaluator</a>, but was wondering if anyone here has done something similar / has any experience with these / any other library that can offer any help or point me in the right direction.</p>

<pre><code>function switchTab(toActivate, toDeactivate) {
    var $toActivate = $(toActivate);
    var $toDeactivate = $(toDeactivate);

    if ($toDeactivate.is("":visible"")) {
        $toDeactivate.css(""visibility"", ""hidden"");
        $toActivate.css(""visibility"", ""visible"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have also created a function for deleting one of the existing orders, this same function is to delete a order when your one the screen when creating one.</p>

<pre><code>function delete_order() {
    if (confirm(""Are you sure you want to delete this order?"")) {
        if ($(""#new-order"").is("":visible"")) {
            switchTab(orderListScreen, newOrderScreen);
            switchTab(orderInformationScreen, availableProductsScreen);

            alert(""Only this is getting called"");
        } else if ($(""#list"").is("":visible"")) {
            $("".selectedRow"").remove();

            alert(""Why doesnt this get called?"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>Whenever i'm creating a order, and im deleting it then by the delete button (where the <code>delete_order()</code> function is getting called) its working fine, because its calling the right part of the code ( <code>if (newOrderScreen.is("":visible""))</code> ).</p>

<p>But whenever i'm trying to delete an existing order, it doesnt work. It just calls the same upper part of the code again.</p>

<p>The code for creating a new order (actually just bringing up the screen) is this:</p>

<pre><code>function new_order() {
    switchTab(newOrderScreen, orderListScreen);
    switchTab(availableProductsScreen, orderInformationScreen);
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Note: The <code>.selectedRow</code> class is given when selecting a row.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: The <code>#list</code> screen is standard displayed, the <code>#new-order</code> screen is only displayed when clicking the button for it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The CSS for the 2 screens that are switching is:</p>

<pre><code>#new-order {
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 40%;
    z-index: 1;
    visibility: hidden;
}

#list {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How does it come that it doesnt take the right part of the <code>if</code> statement? And why does it work in the first place when bringing up the screen for a new order?</p>

<p>To me, the file has some very weird delimiting rules. the delimiting seems to be all commas but other parts just do not make any sense. here is a few examples:</p>

<pre><code>"" "","" "","" "","" "","" ""

"" "",,,,,,,"" ""

"" "",0.00,"" ""

"" "",,"" "",,"" "",,"" ""
</code></pre>

<p>What I do know is that all fields containing letters will be the normal <code>,""text"",</code> format.</p>

<p>all columns that only have numerals will follow this format: <code>,0.00,</code> except for the first column which follows the normal format <code>""123456789"",</code></p>

<p>Then anything with no data will alternate between <code>,,</code> or <code>,"" "",</code></p>

<p>I have been able to get the program to read correctly with java.sql.Statement but I need it to work with java.sql.PreparedStatement</p>

<p>Sorry if it's not formatted correctly, I am still learning and after being flustered for several days trying to figure this out, I didn't bother making it look nice. </p>

<p>My question is would something like this be possible with such a jumbled up file? if so, how do I go about making this a possibility? Also, I am not entirely familiar with prepared statements, do I have to declare every single column or is there a simpler way?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> To clarify what I need is I need to upload a txt file to a MySQL database, I need a way to read and split(unless there is a better way) the data based on either <code>"",""</code>, <code>,,,,</code>, <code>,0.00,</code> and still keep fields together that have commas in the field <code>Some Company, LLC</code>. I need to do this with 100+ columns and the file varies from 3000 to 6000 rows. Doing this as a prepared statement is required. I'm not sure if this is possible but I appreciate any input anyone might have on the matter.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2 :</strong> I was able to figure out how to get the messy file sorted out thanks to rpc1. instead of <code>String data[] = line.split(""\"",\"""");</code> I used <code>String data[] = line.split("",(?=([^\""]*\""[^\""]*\"")*[^\""]*$)"");</code> I still had to write out each variable to link it to the <code>data[]</code> then write out each <code>statement.setString</code> for each column as well as write the <code>replaceALL(""\"""", """");</code> for each column but I got it working and I couldn't find another way to use prepared statements. Thank you for all your help!</p>

I do this because the user's expecting the file to save with a language specific name (French or English) and the date.</p>

<p>When using Firefox set to prompt before executing an action (Open in reader or Save as file), the filename I passed is used as expected ('statsReport_20110718.pdf').

<p>If I execute it, RavenDb will return not only Id, Title and CommentsCount but the whole Post document. But I don't need the whole document (let's imagine it contains a lot of other stuff).</p>

<p>As I unserstand, there are two solutions now:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mark index fields as Stored and call
AsProjection for the query. I don't like
this solution by performance and extra disk space consuming reasons.
It's more like workaround than solution. </li>
<li>Convert Map index to MapReduce index by introduction of some fake Reduce part (equal to Map) which
    actually won't reduce anything. It looks like better solution but it
    is annoying to implement this fake Reduce part.</li>
</ol>

<p>So why there is no more natural solution for that (or may be I just don't know about it)? Is it a conceptual solution?</p>

<p><strong>The error</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User clicks on a link browser prompts
user to ""save as...."" (e.g. in
Firefox ""You have chosen top open
thread.jsp which is a
application/octet-stream""...What
should firefox do with this file)</li>
<li>User says ""Huh?"" and presses ""Cancel""</li>
<li>User clicks again on the same link</li>
<li>Browser displays the page correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>This error occurs intermittently, but unfortunately rarely on our test server and frequently on production.</p>

<p>In firefox's LiveHttpHeaders I see the following in the above usecase:</p>

<ul>
<li>first page download (i.e. click on link) is ""text/plain""</li>
<li>second download is ""text/html""</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought the problem may stem from ProxyPassReverse  (i.e. muddling up whether to use http or ajp), but all these proxypassreverse settings resulted in the same error:</p>

<ul>
<li>ProxyPassReverse /ajp://localhost:8080/</li>
<li>ProxyPassReverse /pe <a href=""http://localhost/pe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/pe</a> </li>
<li>ProxyPassReverse /pe <a href=""http://forumstest.company.com/pe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forumstest.company.com/pe</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I've checked the apache error logs (set to debug) and see no warnings or errors...</p>

<p>** But it works with mod_proxy_http ?? **</p>

<p>It appears that switching to mod_proxy_http 'solves' the problem. Limited testing, I have not been able to recreate the problem in the test environment.</p>

<p>Because the problem is intermittent, I'm not 100% sure that mod_proxy_http ""solves"" the problem</p>

<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Apache 2.2 Windows</li>
<li>Jboss 4.2.2 back end (tomcat 6)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>One other data point</strong></p>

<p>For better or worse, a servlet filter in tomcat gzips the html before sending it to apache. (which means extra work as apache must unzip before it performs ProxyPassReverse's ""find and replace"").  I don't know if ""gzip"" messes up.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>anyone seen this before?</li>
<li>what tools help analyze the cause?</li>
</ul>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>I'm trying to reply to the \0 a flash app is requesting in order to allow a crossdomain http GET request.</p>

<p>The flash policy request, is made to port 843 by default and i'd like to keep it that way.</p>

<p>The port should get a \0 (ending with a null char,\0 is just for the reference) and replying with something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM ""/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd""&gt;
    &lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;
        &lt;site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies=""master-only""/&gt;
        &lt;allow-http-request-headers-from domain=""*"" headers=""*"" secure=""true"" /&gt;
      &lt;allow-access-from domain=""*"" to-ports=""*"" /&gt;
    &lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As far as i know, the request should be return as a plain text, although Content-type, might be needed as well.</p>

<p>I've tried using the following: <a href=""http://socketpolicyserver.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://socketpolicyserver.com/</a> and although it listens to the port and accepts connections, it doesn't reply with the specified xml upon request.</p>

<p>Any methods / ways of achieving a proper reply will be appreciated,</p>

<p>with regards,</p>

<p>Mike.</p>

<p>!---UPDATE---></p>

<p>I wrote a simple C# web server which listens to port 843, and serves the aforementioned policy - it worked out just fine, however, when using a SecureSocket connection for a secure connection (i.e opening a socket to a HTTPS/SSL protocol) - the request that is sent is encrypted using the hosts certificate. As far as i know, there's no way of listening or acquiring the servers certificate and decrypting the data via an external app hence, the only way is to somehow 'teach' Apache to respond with the crossdomain policy after a proper request is sent via an appropriate port.</p>

<p>Another idea i have is to read the server's certificate file stored in the Apache directory regardless of what happens on the server itself, though imo it's an overkill.</p>

<p>Would love to hear your comments,</p>

<p>Mike. </p>

"14568013","1","","","2013-01-28 17:48:03","","0","165","<p>I am currently trying to figure out the best way to access entities in different <code>UIViewControllers</code>. I am currently using the following which seems to have the least live bytes:</p>

<p>View Controller 1 calls this when it wants to present the next view:</p>

<pre><code>fdvc = [[FormDescriptionViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""FormDescriptionViewController"" bundle:nil andDescriptionEntity:mapEntity.desc];
</code></pre>

<p>and View Controller 2 (<code>FormDescriptionViewController</code>) is setup using the following:
<BR><BR><code>.h</code></p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, retain) DescriptionEntity *descriptionEntity;
- (id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil andDescriptionEntity: (DescriptionEntity *)descE;
</code></pre>

<p><code>.m</code></p>

<pre><code>- (id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil andDescriptionEntity: (DescriptionEntity *)descE
{
    self = [super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil];
    if (self) {
        // Custom initialization
        self.descriptionEntity = descE;
    }
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When using this method I perform the following in viewDidLoad:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.

    [self setTitle:@""Form Description""];

    [self.textViewTitle setText:[NSString stringWithString:self.descriptionEntity.map.sName]];

    [self.textViewTitle addObserver:self forKeyPath:@""contentSize"" options:(NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew) context:NULL];

    [self.textViewDescription setText:[NSString stringWithString:self.descriptionEntity.sDescription]];

    if (self.descriptionEntity.map.dImage != nil)
    {
        [self.imageView setImage:[UIImage imageWithData:[NSData dataWithData:self.descriptionEntity.map.dImage]]];
    }
    else
        [self.imageView setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""wildform.gif""]];

    if ([self.descriptionEntity.map.bDownloaded boolValue] == YES)
        [self.buttonUseForm setTitle:@""Use Map""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>These calls are the only calls I have relating to the <code>DescriptionEntity</code>, however when I pop the view controller the memory is never freed. I have performed a heap analysis and it tells me that the DescriptionEntity is the culprit. To confirm this within the dealloc method I tried calling <code>self.descriptionEntity = nil</code> after the <code>[descriptionEntity dealloc]</code>. This frees up the memory when the controller pops, however when I try to push the controlled again I get a bad access so I presume this must now be the only reference to the DescriptionEntity. </p>

<p>I have also tried using an <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> however this uses over double the live bytes of my current method, and it also fails to free up the memory again when popping the view.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain the best way to access this data in the next view, and does anyone know why my memory wouldn't be freed up again when dealloc is called?</p>

<p>If you need any further information feel free to ask.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1 (Where descriptionEntity is declared):</strong></p>

<p>I am currently using NSFetchedResultsController to grab a subsection of my MapEntities and display them within a UITableView. When one of the rows is selected I perform the following to pass the DescriptionEntity into the DescriptionViewController:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    self.viewHasToolbar = YES;

    MapEntity *mapEntity = [_fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];

    FormDescriptionViewController *fdvc;

    if ([[UIDevice currentDevice] userInterfaceIdiom] == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone) {
        fdvc = [[FormDescriptionViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""FormDescriptionViewController"" bundle:nil andDescriptionEntity:mapEntity.desc];
    } else {
        fdvc = [[FormDescriptionViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""FormDescriptionViewController_iPad"" bundle:nil andDescriptionEntity:mapEntity.desc];
    }

    [self.navigationController pushViewController:fdvc animated:YES];
    [fdvc release];

    [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath animated:NO];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The _fetchedResultsController is setup as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, retain) NSFetchedResultsController *fetchedResultsController;
</code></pre>

<p>.m</p>

<pre><code>- (NSFetchedResultsController *)fetchedResultsController {

    if (_fetchedResultsController != nil)
        return _fetchedResultsController;

    NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""MapEntity"" inManagedObjectContext:[singleton managedObjectContext]];

<p>The problem is bigger yet, because there are 2 installations on my server, one in my local home folder, and one in the server's bin folder.</p>

<p>That makes the commands doesnt execute without error.</p>

<p>For example, for this step:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log into the SSH, run “rake gems:install” from the Ruby Apps path</li>
</ol>

<p>I get this error...</p>

<p>And if i try executing the command using my local installation:</p>

<pre><code>[trebolbi@air6 RedMine]$ ./../../ruby/gems/bin/rake gems:install
</code></pre>

<p>I get a lot of errors, all related to ""Gem::SourceIndex#add_spec called from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/source_index.rb:91."" ... as you can see, it looks for the gems in the server bin directoy (/usr/local/bin) and not in my local user installation of ruby (/home/user/ruby/gems/bin).</p>

<p>I just have to execute this commands to get the installation done...</p>

<pre><code>gem install mysql

<p>My initial intuition is to compare the 2 pictures pixel by pixel, and find a range of normal differences for ""normal"" stuff between the 2 light sources, and then get pixels that are abruptly beyond the range to assert they only react to UV light. However, I don't have good knowledge in how images work under different light sources and couldn't find relevant answers, so any help would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

<pre><code>dt {
    float:left;
    clear:left;
}
dd {
    float:left;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In IE7, however, if the clearing element has float, subsequent floats are not affected. (<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/bmNQe/"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>) Is there any workaround for this bug? I've been looking around, but none of the solutions usually suggested seem applicable:</p>

<ul>
<li>since this is a definition list, I can't wrap elements on the same rows in a <code>div</code>.</li>
<li>I don't want to use an invisible non-floated clearing element - it would have to be a <code>dt</code> or <code>dd</code>, and the whole point of using a definition listr instead of a table or <code>span</code>-<code>br</code> soup is to have semantic markup, which would be messed up by purely presentational <code>dt</code>/<code>dd</code> elements.</li>
<li>as far as I can see, approaches based on triggering <a href=""http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html"" rel=""nofollow"">hasLayout</a> (thus triggering inline-block behavior) such as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3365401/ie7-clear-float-issue/3365509#3365509"">this</a> don't work when the number of elements per row is not fixed.

I've already achieved this by setting up a One-To-Many relation in my Doctrine entites.

The ideal solution would easily scale to large numbers of columns, such that the names of the columns would not need to be included in the function call. Thanks!</p>

If a view raises an exception, the transaction is rolled back, which is handy. The problem is, you have to allow the exception to propagate past the view, and you would get HTTP 500 as a result.</p>

<p>Therefore to utilize <code>ATOMIC_REQUESTS</code>, it deems necessary to override <code>handler500</code> with our own implementation, which would check the exception causing the error and provide a normal user-friendly HTTP 200 response where appropriate, otherwise falling back to the default response, which is a stack trace in <code>DEBUG</code> mode or the default Django <code>handler500</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre><code>class UserFriendlyError(Exception):
    pass

def my_view(request):
    # Do some database work here...
    if request.GET['foo'] == 'bar': # Some condition
        # The idea is to show this to user. my_custom_handler500 would handle this
        raise UserFriendlyError(""Don't do this, this is deprecated -- do that instead"")
    # Normal exceptions can happen too and would provide a real HTTP 500 instead
    # ...

def my_custom_500(request):
    ex = sys.exc_info()[1]
    if isinstance(ex, UserFriendlyError):
        # Return a normal 200 response
        return render(request, 'user_friendly_error.html', {'exception': ex})
    # Otherwise fall back to the default handler
    return django.views.defaults.server_error(request)
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20682954/atomic-request-and-transactions-in-django-1-6%5d"">this question</a> for more background.</p>

<p>The problem is, when <code>DEBUG</code> mode is active, the <code>handler500</code> machinery is <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/views/#the-500-server-error-view"" rel=""nofollow"">circumvented with the stack trace debug handler</a>. However, to make this work, the custom 500 handler should still be called in <code>DEBUG</code> mode, but fall back to the debug stack trace handler instead of the default 500 handler.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make this work, preferably without hacking Django's guts? Or perhaps there's a better way to do the same thing, isn't there?</p>

<p>I need to read a string from a file and store it in an array. I need to read only one line of string, and each element of the array should be a character of the string. For example, if I read 'ABCDABC' into an array, then array[3] should be 'D'. But I don't really know how to do it, I modified some other's code, and get the above code. But I don't want to involve pointers and address stuff in my code. So could anyone tell me how to realize it without using pointers? Thank you!</p>

Using frames the resizing of this sidebar was built in.   However, I'm having some difficulty emulating this capability in jQuery.</p>

<p>I don't wish to use jQuery UI to do this, I have no need for all the extra functionality that the UI suite provides, and would rather just write a few lines of code to take care of this.</p>

<p>I only need to resize in the horizontal plane, vertical dimensions are fixed.</p>

<p>Currently I have a solution that (sort of) works.   The sidebar div can be resized, but only if a user clicks on the resizable div, drags the mouse, then clicks on the div again (to remove the mousemove event).</p>

<p>The experience I want is this:  A user hovers over the resizable div, presses the mouse button down, then drags the div to be larger/smaller, and releases the button.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is this:   If a user clicks on my resizable div, then tries to drag it to make it smaller/larger, the mouse becomes the ""no"" icon, and there is a transparent version of my div that is drug around with the mouse.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is better explained by checking out my code:.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
var i = 0;
   $('#dragbar').mousedown(function(){
        $('#mousestatus').html(""mousedown"" + i++);
       $(document).mousemove(function(e){
          $('#position').html(e.pageX +', '+ e.pageY);
          $('#sidebar').css(""width"",e.pageX+2);
       })
       console.log(""leaving mouseDown"");
    });
   $(document).mouseup(function(){
       $('#clickevent').html('in another mouseUp event' + i++);
       $(document).unbind('mousemove');
       });
});
</code></pre>

<p>First thing, i know i should use a server side language to accomplish this not client side like jquery but that's not the point, i'm just trying to learn how to use it to manipulate html. Heres the html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""items""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""1.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""2.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""3.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""4.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""5.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""6.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to wrap every 3 <code>&lt;divs&gt;</code> within the <code>&lt;div class=""items""&gt;</code> with yet another div: <code>&lt;div class=""row""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>. So it end up like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""items""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""row""&gt;  
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""1.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""2.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""3.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class=""row""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""4.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""5.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""boxgrid""&gt;&lt;span class=""cushycms""&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;img src=""6.jpg"" alt=""""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=""cover""&gt;&lt;span class=""film_title""&gt;Title 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>How can i accomplish this with jquery's selectors? I thought i can use something like:</p>

<pre><code>$(""div.items:nth-child(3n)"").wrap('&lt;div class=""row""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't work. Any ideas please?            </p>

This is how my code looks:  </p>

$test = ""asdf""
$arrtest = @(""one"", ""two"", ""three"")

Function Write-Log($message)

<p>Now I want to pass single items of the array to the Write-Log function like this:</p>

<pre><code>Write-Log ""first arr item: $arrtest[0]""
Write-Log ""second arr item: $arrtest[1]""
Write-Log ""third arr item: $arrtest[2]""

<pre><code>first arr item: one two three[0]
second arr item: one two three[1]
third arr item: one two three[2]

<p>When the user clicks on the facebook login button on the website, he or she is taken to a facebook login page. After logging in with facebook, the user is taken to the app authorization page where the user asks for permission to connect with the app. Once necessary permissions are granted, a local account (account at my website) is automatically created for the user and the user is brought back to a welcome page to set password. The user won't even have to verify their email address. On subsequent visits, when the user clicks on the login link, he/she is taken to the same facebook login page where they supply their login credentials. On successful login, they are brought back to the website. So far, everything works fine with the <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/fboauth"" rel=""nofollow"">fboauth</a> module.</p>

<p>What I am trying to achieve now is a functionality similar to what is found with the <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/fbconnect"" rel=""nofollow"">fbconnect</a> module. The user is provided with a block/page where the user can import the list of his friends who has authorized with the app, and see the links to their local accounts (accounts at the website). How to achieve this functionality? The fboauth module has its own API which can be utilized. Here is what I already have, written using the API of fboauth.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
module_load_include('inc', 'fboauth', 'includes/fboauth.fboauth');
module_load_include('module', 'fboauth', 'fboauth');
module_load_include('php', 'fboauth', fboauth.api');
module_load_include('inc', 'fboauth', 'includes/fboauth.field');
module_load_include('inc', 'fboauth', 'includes/fboauth.pages');
module_load_include('inc', 'fboauth', 'includes/fboauth.profile');
/**
 * Implements hook_menu().
 */
function mymodule_menu() {
  $items['my-friends'] = array(
    'title' =&gt; t('Your Friends'),
    'page callback' =&gt; 'friend_import',
    'access callback' =&gt; TRUE;
  );
  return $items;
}
function friend_import() {
          $result = fboauth_graph_query('me/friends?fields=id', $access_token);
          drupal_set_message(t('Import complete!'));
          $accounts = array();
          $output = """";
          foreach($result-&gt;data as $fbuid){
            $accounts[] = user_load(fboauth_uid_load($fbuid-&gt;id));
            $output = l($account-&gt;name, ""/user/"" . $account-&gt;uid);
          }
          dpm($accounts);


   return $output;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will import all the friends of a user who have authenticated for the app as an object into $result (having name and user id). However, what I am finding it difficult is to display those names with the user's corresponding local accounts (accounts at the website). This is because of my lack of knowledge in php. What I am looking for is here is the exact lines of code that can be inserted after $result recieves its value so that the names of the users are displayed along with the links to their profile pages at the website. </p>

I was writing a small method for DFS:</p>

<p>Where TreeNode41, is a Binary node, with left and right references. It does not even need to check for visited, or non visited, when the recursive function has nowhere to go, it pops off, which sort of acts like a stack.
This Algorithm traverses a binary tree, in a DFS fashion. However I feel like I am missing something. Is the stack data structure needed when one implements DFS Non-recursively? Or is it that, this algorithm will not work for cyclical graphs or something that's not trees?</p>

<li>i move the cursor to 13</li>
<li>the interval looks like xxx13xxx</li>
<li>if i now move the cursor to 14 then 15,16,17 would be marked too, but what if 16 is the starting point of a reservation? then it would look like xxx14x</li>

<li>how to make that the difference (16 and 17) is getting prepended on the left end so it would look like xxxxx14x?</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because there is no guaranteed order in which locks are acquired, a
  problem in threaded programs is that a particular thread never
  acquires a lock, even though it seems that it should.</p>
  
  <p>This usually happens when the thread that holds the lock releases it,
  lets a small amount of time pass, and then reacquires it. Because the
  lock was released, it might seem that the other thread should acquire
  the lock. But, because nothing blocks the thread holding the lock, it
  continues to run from the time it releases the lock until it
  reacquires the lock, and so no other thread is run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to make sure I understood this, I tried to write this out in code (let me know if this is a correct interpretation):</p>



<pre class=""lang-c++ prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;mutex&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

std::mutex m;

void f()
{
    std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(m); // acquire the lock
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; "" now has the mutex\n"";

    lock.unlock(); // release the lock
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2)); // sleep for a while

    lock.lock(); // reacquire the lock
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; "" has the mutex after sleep\n"";
}

int main()
{
    std::thread(f).join(); // thread A
    std::thread(f).join(); // thread B
}
</code></pre>

<p>So what the quote above is saying is that the time during which the lock is released and the thread is sleeping (like the code above) is not sufficient to guarantee a thread waiting on the lock to acquire it? How does this relate to deadlocks?</p>

<p>Javascript seems to not view these as individual objects:</p>

<p>When alerting playerPos[4] for example it will simply alert the 4th character in the string above.</p>

<p>I realise the above is very difficult to read but I wanted to show you an actual copy of the alert.</p>

<p>This is the bit from the php file it accesses:</p>

<pre><code>if($type==""db_request""){
    $team = new Team;
    $team = $team-&gt;buildTeam(101, 'A');
    ChromePhp::log($team);

    $response = json_encode($team);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my log above looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qlIHE.jpg"" alt=""Print Screen of my Console Log""></p>

<p>So you can see that the php file views ""$team"" as containing multiple nested objects</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>From there, I'm trying to set the value (T/F) via a converter. Based on the converter value, I would like to update the nested TextBox style in the setter of the DependencyProperty. Explicitly setting the property in the XAML (IsReadOnly=""True"") works fine, and the setter fires and updates the style. However, doing this via the converter does NOT fire of the setter of the DependencyProperty. I seem to be having trouble pasting code snippets here (first time poster).. so I'll do my best to give an quick code run through:</p>

<p>Property on AutoCompleteBox:</p>

<p>IsReadOnly=""{Binding Converter={StaticResource IsReadOnlyVerifier}, ConverterParameter='Edit Client'}""</p>

<p>Which calls out to the Converter, which returns either true or false based on the User's permissions. This however does not call the setter of the registered DependencyProperty.</p>

<p>Example 1 (helper assigned to object):</p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var myObject = {
    doSomething: function (a) {

<p>Example 2 (helper NOT part of the object):</p>

<pre><code>npm install websocket
</code></pre>

<p>Starting from <a href=""http://cjihrig.com/blog/creating-your-own-node-js-websocket-echo-server/"" rel=""nofollow"">this guide</a>, I decided to extend it sharing the sent messages between all the clients.</p>

<p>Here is my (simplified) server code:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env node
var WebSocketServer = require('websocket').server;
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
    console.log((new Date()) + ' Received request for ' + request.url);
    response.writeHead(404);
    response.end();
});
server.listen(8080, function() {
    console.log((new Date()) + ' Server is listening on port 8080');
});

wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
    httpServer: server,
    autoAcceptConnections: false
});

var connectedClientsCount = 0; // ADDED
var connectedClients = []; // ADDED

wsServer.on('request', function(request) {
    var connection = request.accept('echo-protocol', request.origin);
    connectedClientsCount++;
    connectedClients.push(connection);
    console.log((new Date()) + ' Connection accepted.');
    connection.on('message', function(message) {
        if (message.type === 'utf8') {
            console.log('Received Message: ' + message.utf8Data);
            for(c in connectedClients) // ADDED
                c.sendUTF(message.utf8Data); // ADDED
        }
        else if (message.type === 'binary') {
            console.log('Received Binary Message of ' + message.binaryData.length + ' bytes');
            connection.sendBytes(message.binaryData);
        }
    });
    connection.on('close', function(reasonCode, description) {
        // here I should delete the client...
        console.log((new Date()) + ' Peer ' + connection.remoteAddress + ' disconnected.');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this case I can get the <code>connectedClientsCount</code> value, but I can't manage the <code>connectedClients</code> list.</p>

<p>I also tried with <code>((eval)c).sendUTF(message.utf8Data);</code> as for statement but it doesn't work.</p>

<p>On Android 2, if the phone was sleeping, it would wake the phone up and display a ""Snooze or Dismiss"" screen over the lock screen.</p>

<p>On Android 4, it wakes the phone up, but you have to unlock it, then open the notifications area, then click the alarm's notification, before you can hit ""Dismiss.""</p>

<p>I have always been using this code to do the waking:</p>

<pre><code>getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED
            | WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD
            | WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON
            | WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON);
</code></pre>

<p>I have read 8 different stackoverflow questions on this matter.  Most of them give the code above, which worked for me years ago in Android 2 but doesn't work in Android 4.  But none of them have helped me solve this problem.  Here are the questions that I read and tried:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas about what's changed in Android 4 that may have caused this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here is one of the simplest examples I've seen of an alarm dialog that doesn't come up ""minimized."" It does not, as written, appear over the lockscreen, but you can fix that with <code>WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED</code></p>

<p>It's written with a FragmentActivity and a DialogFragment, but it still works as an Activity. It uses an AlertDialog.Builder to make the dialog, and if you try to do it with an XML layout, it won't work.  Why?</p>

I ran into a basic problem which I can not seem to solve. Here is the issue stripped down to a minimum test case:</p>

<p>I have two packages, 'one' and 'two' (created with 'meteor create --package' and added to the project subsequently) Package two holds a variable and exports this variable. Package one logs the contents of this variable to the console:</p>

<p>two.js:</p>

<pre><code>two_var = 'two'
</code></pre>

<p>package.js (two):</p>

<pre><code>Package.describe({
  name: 'two'
});

Package.onUse(function (api) {
  api.addFiles('two.js', 'client');
  api.export('two_var', 'client')
});
</code></pre>

<p>one.js:</p>

<pre><code>Meteor.startup(function() {
    console.log(two_var) //two_var found, unexpected
})

setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(two_var) //two_var found, unexpected
}, 3000)

console.log(two_var) //two_var not found, expected
</code></pre>

<p>package.js (one):</p>

<pre><code>Package.describe({
  name: 'one'
});

Package.onUse(function(api) {
  //api.use('two', 'client');  //not using two, but two_var found in certain situations
  api.addFiles('one.js', 'client');
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the variable from package two can be accessed in situations I would not expect so. Am I overlooking something or do I misunderstand the concept of the package?</p>

I know that index is used to speed up searching, but is the difference between this situations ? => let's bring some example. first => mysql query <code>""SELECT name FROM BIO WHERE LIMIT 0,100""</code> and second => (let's consider that dx is index of name column) mysql query <code>SELECT dx FROM BIO LIMIT 0,100</code>
I think that in that situations there is no difference and want to hear from you guys your opinions :)
Correctly I should written in second example like so yes <code>""SELECT name FROM BIO LIMIT 0,100""</code> ? 
I've made some changing in examples to express data searching speed
I don't know indexes well and because of it I'm asking ...

<p>In controller, a destroy method is defined and in view, you can use :action => ""delete"" to fire that method. Isn't the action name has to be the same as the method name? Why delete is mapped to destroy?</p>

<p>Again, in my controller, I define a method called destroy to delete a record. In a view, I have &lt;%= link_to ""remove"", :action => 'destroy', :id => myrecord %>. But it never works in practice. Every time I press the remove link, it redirects me to the show view, showing the record's content. I am pretty sure that my destroy method is:</p>

<p>def destroy
    @myobject = MyObject.find(params[:id])
    @myobject.destroy
    @redirect_to :action = 'index'
end</p>

<p>If I change the method name from destroy to something like remove_me and change the action name to remove_me in the view, everything works as expected.</p>

<p>In the above two wired problems, I am sure there is no tricky rountting set in my configuration.</p>

<p>All in all, seems the destroy and delete are mysterious keywords in rails. Anyone can explain this to me? Thank you very much. </p>

<p>So, I would like to request something <em>like</em> this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>Entry.objects.filter(everyoneof__required_perms__in=['create', 'delete'])

Basically, if you have a resource with a field <em>status</em>, you just put a new version of that resource with an update <em>status</em> field.</p>

<p>In this topic, I would like to extend this model. Say you have a resource which can be in two states: 1 and 2. In contrast with the simple model as described in the cited post, there are three transitions to traverse from state 1 to state 2, instead of just one.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>how would you model state transitions in REST?</strong></p>

<p>I myself cannot come up with an RPC-like POST, which isn't very RESTian probably:</p>

<pre><code>POST http://server/api/x
     target_state=2&amp;transition=3
</code></pre>

<p>This changes resource <em>x</em> from state 1 to state 2 by using transition 3.</p>

<p>When a page is loaded, if the links are middle-clicked or Ctrl-clicked the 1st time, they only open in a new tab/window like they should, but the 2nd time they act as though they were left clicked and use the same tab/window.  For some reason this problem doesn't happen when I use Hyperlink or Anchor widgets.  It also isn't an issue in Firefox or IE8.</p>

<p>I've verified that the final HTML of the Hyperlinks and my manually scripted tags are exactly the same.  I applied the same styles to the HTML widget to do this.  I even tried creating a Hyperlink and calling toString() to generate the HTML, but the bug still occurs.</p>

<p>Does anybody know why this could be happening or have any ideas of how to remedy it?  This is a situation where I can't use Widgets so I need to create the tag HTML manually.  I'm not a GWT expert, but I don't understand how the compiled code be handling the Hyperlink and Anchor widgets differently than the ones inside the HTML widgets.  Any incite into this could be helpful.</p>

<p>I'd be interested in knowing if anybody else could reproduce this as well.  I'm running Chrome 23.0.1271.97 and GWT-2.5.0.  I know this happens in older versions of Chrome and GWT because it's been a problem for a while, at least since GWT-2.4.</p>

<p>Uninteresting nuances:
If there are two different links inside the same HTML, they bug will happen independently.  Meaning that you can middle-click each one, and they will both work correctly, just not the 2nd time.  Refreshing the page also resets them so the bug won't happen on the next middle-click.  I also found that if the same link is twice contained in the HTML widget, they actually wont work independently.  Meaning middle-clicking one will cause the other to incorrectly handle it's 1st middle click.</p>

<p>The <code>models</code> table lists different types of car models that exist.</p>

<p>The <code>colors</code> table lists different types of colors that a car can come in.</p>

<p>Now, it might not be evident right away, but there exists a relationship between the two. A <strong>color</strong> may only be available for a certain model, or more likely several models of the same make. A <strong>model</strong> certainly doesn't come in a specific color, but it does come with a selection, or choice, of colors that I do want to store in the database.</p>

<p>So there exists a many-to-many relationship between them, which suggests that I should store the details of that relationship in a join table. So, if you forgive my own notation, it would look something like this:</p>

<p>Obviously, my appDelegate implements <code>[applicationShouldTerminate:]</code> and I see it invoked when developing/debugging. Even in the field there are only a small % of reports which suggest this might not be getting invoked. </p>

<p>Three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does anyone know of cases where <code>[applicationShouldTerminate:]</code> will not be invoked but the app still be terminated?</li>
<li>Is there any other better method to do cleanup in? The cleanup I do could potentially take some time, so I'm not sure if doing it in <code>[applicationWillTerminate]</code> is any different/better than what I have.</li>
<li>Does the stack above imply that <code>[applicationShouldTerminate:]</code> was already definitely invoked and that this could be a bug someplace else in my cleanup logic?</li>

<p>So I was just thinking if there is a way to store these values on the server, access/modify them based on admin action.

Is there a way to do something without having a database and achieving what I want ?</p>

<p>This is a number of answers about warnings, errors and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in adding to and maintaining this list. </p>

<h3>Why is this?</h3>

<p>Questions like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12769982/reference-what-does-this-error-mean-in-php/12770075#12770075"">""Headers already sent""</a> or <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12769982/reference-what-does-this-error-mean-in-php/12769983#12769983"">""Calling a member of a non-object""</a> pop up frequently on Stack&nbsp;Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in his/her particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error can not easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad, because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply.</p>

<h3>What should I do here?</h3>

<p>If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute, please add your ""favorite"" error message, warning or notice, one per answer, a short description what it means (even if it is only highlighting terms to their manual page), a possible solution or debugging approach and a listing of existing Q&amp;A that are of value. Also, feel free to improve any existing answers.</p>

    [myArray addObject:myImageView];

    [UIView animateWithDuration:.5 
                          delay:0 
                options:(UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction) // | something here?)

                         myImageView.frame = CGRectOffset(myImageView.frame, 500, 0);    
                     }

                     }
     ];
}
</code></pre>

<p>then to detect the current CGPoint of the imageView I call this method every 60th of a second</p>

<pre><code>-(void)findPoint{

    for (UIImageView *projectile in bullets) {        
         label.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%f"", projectile.center.x];
         label2.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%f"", projectile.center.y];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However this only gives me the point where the animation ends, I want to get the current CGPoint of the image that is animating across the screen. Is there an option that I need to apply other than UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction to do this?  If not, how do I get the current position of an animating imageView?</p>

I've developed a simple wrapper that I pass in the parameters and it creates the FileHandler with the correct format every time so that I don't have to recreate the logging in every project.</p>

<p>My test app functions exactly as intended, but when I import the library into other projects I seem to be getting one (only one so far) unique error: Every single time, it adds a "".0"" to the end of the log file. </p>

<p>It does this even when there is no conflicts and the Filehandler has been configured to append to the end an existing file (which it does fine). I've played with various file names, most recently I've been using the simple ""mylog.log"" and the log file still gets output as ""mylog.log.0"". I've checked and the fileHandler is being passed the correct file (""mylog.log""), but it isn't logging there.</p>

<p>This does not happen in my logging test, only in the project I actually want to use it in. Even when using the exact same parameters, I get different file names.</p>

<p>Is there some quirk about JUL that I'm missing? Code is very simple. Relevent code:</p>

<p>I have a MySQL database with a <code>Users</code> table. This table has a column for ""firstname"" which collation is set to <code>utf8_general_ci</code> (all varchar columns is). I have then inserted a row where the firstname-column is set to ""Løw"", with the scandinavian special character ""ø"".</p>

<p>I now use the php-ActiveRecord library, where the connection string is to "";charset=utf8"", to retrieve the row and afterwards outputs the user as json, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$user = User::find($ID);
$userArr = $user-&gt;to_array();
header('Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8');
print(json_encode($userArr));
</code></pre>

<p>Now the wired things starts. The firstname is now NOT ""Løw"" as displayed in the MySQL Database , but <strong>""L\u00f8w""</strong>. I then tried to see if this was also the case without the <code>json_encode</code> function, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$user = User::find($ID);
$userArr = $user-&gt;to_array();
header('Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8');
print_r($userArr);
</code></pre>

<p>But here the output was correct, firstname was ""Løw"". I then tried to encode the fields in the array to <code>utf-8</code>, since everybody told me if the strings was <code>utf-8</code> it should work, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$return[] = array_map('utf8_encode', $userArr);
print_r(json_encode($return));
</code></pre>

<p>But this gave me <strong>""L\u00c3\u00b8w""</strong>, so that didn't work. I then tried, since i was out of ideas to utf8_decode it:</p>

<pre><code>$return[] = array_map('utf8_decode', $userArr);
print_r(json_encode($return));
</code></pre>

<p>But that made the string return as <strong>""null""</strong>. I then tried to check what encoding my vars was when they came out of the database, like so:</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8');
print(mb_detect_encoding($userArr['firstname']));
</code></pre>

<p>But this returned <code>UTF-8</code>.</p>

<p>So as you, hopefully, can see, i have tried everything and i still don't know why my <code>json_encode</code>, changes the ""ø"" charcter to <strong>""\u00f8""</strong>. Please help, i don't want to make my own json_encode-method.</p>

<p>I have tested it with a simple node server and client and it works fine. The code is:</p>

<p><strong>NODE SERVER:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var app = require('express')();
var server = require('http').Server(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(server);

var port = 9000;

server.listen(port, function(){
  console.log('Express server listening on %d port', port);
});

// __dirname is the directory where this file is placed
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/browserSocketAppClient.html');
});

io.on('connection', function (socket) {
  console.log( 'THE SOCKET: ' + socket.toString());

  socket.emit('NODE SOCKET SERVER', { SERVER: 'NODE SOCKET SERVER' });

  socket.on('NODE SOCKET CLIENT', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NODE CLIENT:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var io = require('socket.io-client');

var socket = io.connect('http://192.168.0.101:9000');

socket.on('connect', function() {
  console.log( 'NODE SOCKET CLIENT has connected with the server');
});

socket.on('NODE SOCKET SERVER', function (data) {
  console.log(data);
  socket.emit('NODE SOCKET CLIENT', { CLIENT: 'NODE SOCKET CLIENT' });
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>THE SERVER CONSOLE:</strong></p>

<pre><code>D:\003_IOT\CODE_EXAMPLES\TestSocketIO&gt;node nodeSocketServer
Express server listening on 9000 port
{ CLIENT: 'NODE SOCKET CLIENT' }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>THE CLIENT CONSOLE</strong></p>

<pre><code>D:\003_IOT\CODE_EXAMPLES\TestSocketIO&gt;node nodeSocketClient
NODE SOCKET CLIENT has connected with the server
{ SERVER: 'NODE SOCKET SERVER' }
</code></pre>

<p>But when I want to use the same NODE CLIENT: with the Angular-Fullstack project, it doesn't work.</p>

<p>I have added this code to myproject/server/config/socketio.js</p>

<p><strong>socketio.js</strong></p>

<pre><code>function onConnect(socket) {

  socket.emit('NODE SOCKET SERVER', { SERVER: 'You are connected with NODE SOCKET SERVER' });
  socket.on('NODE SOCKET CLIENT', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
............................
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I get in the <strong>console of the server</strong> this recursive message,</p>

<pre><code>Express server listening on NaN : 9000 in development mode

It has to be something in the configuration in the server side of the Angular-Fullstack project, but I can't fid it.</p>

<p>But that obviously fails for the above mentioned sentence and other such. Others suggest using Stanford Text Parser or OpenNLP. They are really cool, but not useable for typical application. You would not install Java on your Ruby/PHP server, just to trim a text, right. So I'm looking for some 80/20 solution, that would be language-agnosic and would be able to handle typical cases that appear. </p>

<p>I couldn't think of more problematic sentence than this (contains a date, non-dot sentence ending and non-ascii character at the begining of the next sentence and non-ending dot in the middle of the ""limit"" sentence). </p>

<p>I also created a GIST (https://gist.github.com/4051035) for you to fork and play with - forking assures that users can click-through to different solutions of this problem, so please use it ;) I wanted to make this question comunity-wiki, but it seems it does not work for questions - only for answers.

<p>I've tried various places. The most correct place I've tried seems to be in the templates <code>onAfterAction</code> callback, in a <code>Meteor.defer</code>. This works about 95% of the time.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyController = RouteController.extend({
     waitOn:  function () {
        return Meteor.subscribe('post', this.params._id);
     },
     onAfterAction: function () {
        Meteor.defer(function () {
            $('.make-wysiwyg').wysiwyg();
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, occasionally it doesn't. If I start bouncing between posts really quick, occasionally one will apparently run before the <code>textarea</code> has data and fail to display property (it'll be empty, because it needs the value before <code>wysiwyg()</code> is called).</p>

<p>I've eliminated the <code>wysiwyg()</code> function itself as the culprit by replacing that line with:</p>

<pre><code>$('.make-wysiwyg').each(function () {console.log($(this).val())});
</code></pre>

<p>And I can clearly see every so often it'll print empty value fields for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the template or <code>publish()</code> function could be a culprit, so I'll supply them as well.</p>

<p>Any ideas greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;template name=""adminPostsEdit""&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Edit Post&lt;/h1&gt;

<pre><code>class Student(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, unique=True)
    ra = models.IntegerField()

class Discipline (models.Model):
    description = models.CharField(max_length=150)

class Enrollment (models.Model):
    discipline = models.ForeignKey('disciplines.Discipline')
    student = models.ForeignKey(Student)
    enroll_date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
</code></pre>

<p>And for these models I've these serializers:</p>

<pre><code>class StudentSerializer (serializers.ModelSerializer):
     ra = serializers.IntegerField(source=Student.ra)
     disciplines = EnrolledDisciplinesSerializer(source=""enrollment_set"", many=True)
     activities = RealizedActivitiesSerializer(source='activities_set', many=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Enrollment
        fields = ('id', 'ra', 'enroll_date')
</code></pre>

<p>And on my views.py for my students app I've the following code:</p>

<pre><code>class StudentList (generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    model = Student
    serializer_class = StudentSerializer
    permission_classes = [
        permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,

    serializer_class = EnrolledDisciplinesSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        queryset = super(StudentDisciplineList, self).get_queryset()
        return queryset.filter(student__pk=self.kwargs.get('pk'))

    def get_queryset(self):
        queryset = super(StudentActivitiesList, self).get_queryset()
        return queryset.filter(student__pk=self.kwargs.get('pk'))
</code></pre>

<p>After creating the views I added the following to my urls.py file in my students app:</p>

<pre><code>url_patterns = [
    '',
    url(r'^/(?P&lt;pk&gt;\d+)/disciplines$', StudentDisciplineList.as_view(), name='studentdiscipline-list'),
    url(r'^/(?P&lt;pk&gt;\d+)/activities$', StudentActivitiesList.as_view(), name='studentactivities-list'),
    url(r'^/(?P&lt;pk&gt;\d+)$', StudentDetail.as_view(), name='student-detail'),
    url(r'^$', StudentList.as_view(), name='student-list'),
]
</code></pre>

<p>Then I added this to my main urls.py file:</p>

<pre><code>import students.urls

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
    url(r'^students/', include(students.urls)),
]
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this I went to <a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8000/students"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8000/students</a> and got the following:</p>

<p>I would like to write a Python script to run this program multiple times for different inputs and write outputs to a file. I am planning to run the program with exhaustive inputs.</p>

<p>However, I don't have any experience in writing scripts or programming in Python. So, I was wondering if I could get some pointers where to start.</p>

<p>As an example, I would like to write a script for doing:</p>

<pre><code>./program -flag1 [val1] -flag2 [val2] -arg1 -arg2 -arg3 ...
Append the output to Output.txt
./program -flag1 [val1] -flag2 [val2] -arg1 -arg2 -arg4 ...

...
./program -flag1 [val1] -flag2 [val2] -arg1000 -arg1000 -arg1000 ...

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I am running the program on Linux through command line, bash.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2 SLN</strong>: Just for a future reference to others who might be a beginner, doing something similar, the solution looks like following. I stripped all the parts that only affects my case.</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

for commands in listArgs:

    # Build command through for loop in listArgs.
    # Details are omitted.

    # Open/Create the output file
    outFile = open('/path/to/file/Output.txt', 'a+')

    result = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    out = result.stdout.read()

            return true;
        }

        //Other actionmode methods...
    });
</code></pre>

<p>The Contextual Action Bar shows up ok, but when picking an item from it I get a NullPointerException at the AdapterContextMenuInfo line, since this was obviously made for context menus and not action bars. Is there some equivalent for this for Action bars perhaps? Or how can I get the ListView item text in this case? Thanks.</p>

<p>It is not clear how to ask for the Name <strong>Start</strong> because this is one tier under the <em>TestCaseElement</em> wich i want to ""group""? </p>

<p>So I look around and find some <strong>third-party</strong> controls that <strong>emulate</strong> the menu control, like <a href=""http://slmenu.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">this one at codeplex</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.deviantsart.com/upload/1adt6b3.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>But then I decided to <strong>take advantage of this situation</strong> and think of some <strong>new metaphors</strong> besides the standard menu we have been using since <strong>Windows 3.0</strong>, e.g. I like the following <strong>enabled/disabled buttons</strong> for a small number of choices, which also work well as a vertical stack, and will try to integrate a <strong><a href=""http://www.tanguay.info/web/index.php?pg=codeExamples&amp;id=140"" rel=""nofollow"">drop-down button</a></strong> idea to allow it to hold the number of nested choices that a standard menu control could hold:</p>

I've been able to do everything so far except for importing the date.  The problem I'm having is that the data is structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=gameDay-Container&gt;
    &lt;h4 class=""games-date""&gt;Thursday, August 28 2014&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;div class=mod-ncf-scorebox&gt; Containing games that I have scraped, which I want to add the date (Aug 28) to  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h4 class=""games-date""&gt;Friday, August 29 2014&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;div class=mod-ncf-scorebox&gt; containing the next games that I will scrape, which I want the date (Aug 29) appended to &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The top section scrapes for the number of games within each date and places it into an array, and then the bottom section compiles the data for the table. (This is messy as I write it via trial and error; is there an easier way to do this?)</p>

<pre><code>foreach($html_base-&gt;find('.gameDay-Container') as $dates) {
    $rows = $dates-&gt;find('.mod-ncf-scorebox');
    $count = count($rows);
    $supercount=$count.',';

    $megacount=explode(', ',$supercount);

    print_r($megacount);
}

foreach($html_base-&gt;find('.mod-ncf-scorebox') as $event) {
    $item['Date'] = ''; 
    $item['Away Team'] = $event-&gt;find('.team-name', 0)-&gt;plaintext;
    $item['Away Team'] = substr($item['Away Team'], 0, -1);
    $item['Away Score'] = $event-&gt;find('li.finalScore', 1);
    $item['Home Team'] = $event-&gt;find('.team-name', 1)-&gt;plaintext;
    $item['Home Team'] = substr($item['Home Team'], 0, -1);
    $item['Home Score'] = $event-&gt;find('li.finalScore', 2)-&gt;plaintext;
    $item['Game Status'] = $event-&gt;find('div.game-status', 0)-&gt;plaintext;
    $item['Game ID'] = $event-&gt;find('p', 0)-&gt;id;
    $item['Game ID'] = substr($item['Game ID'], 0, strpos( $item['Game ID'], '-'));
    $item['Week'] = $week;
    $item['League'] = 'NCAA Football';

    $NCAAFscores[] = $item;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The question</strong>:  can I get the date of the game to be added to each line within the table? If I have to use the array setup, can I take the values from it and do some sort of count?  Is there an easier way that I'm just completely overlooking? </p>

<p><strong>The answer</strong>: </p>

<p>Per Enissay's suggestion below, I nested the foreach statements, which worked out perfectly.  Here is the final snippet of code in case anyone out there has similar things.</p>

<pre><code>foreach($html_base-&gt;find('.gameDay-Container') as $event2) {

    $date1 = $event2-&gt;prev_sibling()-&gt;plaintext; 
    $date2 = new DateTime($date1);
    $ymd = ($date2-&gt;format('Y-m-d'));


    foreach($event2-&gt;find('.mod-ncf-scorebox') as $event) {
        $item['Date']     = $ymd;
        $item['Away Team']     = $event-&gt;find('.team-name', 0)-&gt;plaintext;
        $item['Away Team'] = substr($item['Away Team'], 0, -1);
        $item['Away Score']     = $event-&gt;find('li.finalScore', 1);
        $item['Home Team']     = $event-&gt;find('.team-name', 1)-&gt;plaintext;
        $item['Home Team'] = substr($item['Home Team'], 0, -1);

<p>I'll note that the script is working fine and downloads work fine... it is the file delete after download which isn't.</p>

<p>According to the docs you need to set a flag on the file path to allow deletes.  Here is my current setup :</p>

        header('Content-Length: '.filesize($file_path).'');

        // set the mime type based on extension
        $ctype_default = 'application/octet-stream';

        $content_types = array(
            'exe' =&gt; 'application/octet-stream',

        return true;
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am wondering if it matters that my filepath is not exact... meaning in this download the file path would have been <code>/home/test/user-data/user1/downloads/text.zip</code>... not exactly in the <code>user-data</code> folder which was set in virtual hosts?</p>

<p>A side question to go along with this... can I use a wildcard in my file path like <code>XSendFilePath /home/test/user-data/*/downloads/ AllowFileDelete</code> which would handle the 'downloads' folder for each user (every user has their own specific download folder location).</p>

<p>To be more practical: My Web-App serves a two-steps registration process. So for example I´ve got these routes: </p>

<pre><code>http://myapp.com/registration/step-one
http://myapp.com/registration/step-two
</code></pre>

<p>If someone directly enters the route of step-two before step-one is completed he should be redirected back to step-one. There will be alot of session-storage-logic to do but that´s not my problem. To ensure that step-two cannot be reached before step-one I´m thinking about an extra class which is sending the user to step-one if a defined session-boolean isn´t true. </p>

<p><strong>So my basic question is: How to implement a class to control access to the routes?</strong></p>

<p>I read about various architectures but I´m new in the most of them.</p>

<p>So here is my setup:</p>

<p><strong>routes.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>Route::controllers([
    'registration' =&gt; 'Registration\RegistrationController',
]);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>RegistrationController.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php namespace App\Http\Controllers\Registration;

use App\Http\Requests;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class RegistrationController extends Controller {

    public function getStepOne()
    {
        return view('registration.step-one');
    }        
    public function getStepTwo()
    {
        return view('registration.step-two');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>RegistrationLogic.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php namespace App\Http\Controllers\Registration\Logic

class RegistrationLogic {

    private $statusOfStepOne = 0;
    private $statusOfStepTwo = 0;

    public function $getStatusOfStepOne()
    {
        return $this-&gt;statusOfStepOne;
    }

    public function $getStatusOfStepTwo()
    {
        return $this-&gt;statusOfStepTwo;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned I´m a bit confused about all the possibilities (some are laravel-specific, some basic php).
Here is a list of various approaches (correct me if I´m wrong):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Simply add <code>use App\Http\Controllers\Registration\Logic\RegistrationLogic;</code> to the RegistrationController</p></li>
<li><p>Use dependency injection via constructor-magic-method of the RegistrationController</p>

<pre><code>protected $logic;

public function __construct(RegistrationLogic $logic)
{
    $this-&gt;logic = $logic;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Bind the RegistrationLogic class to the IoC-Container. Maybe in <strong>bootstrap/app.php</strong>?</p>

<pre><code>$app-&gt;resolving(function(App\Http\Controllers\Registration\RegistrationController $registrationController, $app)
{
    $app-&gt;bind('RegistrationLogic', new RegistrationLogic);
});
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add the RegistrationLogic class to the providers array in <strong>config/app.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>'providers' =&gt; [
    'App\Http\Controllers\Registration\Logic\RegistrationLogic',
]
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>I tend to use dependency injection because each method of the RegistrationController will automatically have access to $this->logic</p>

<p>I made sure all the sql server assemblies from (list below) are in %windir%\assembly (I think that’s the GAC), but no good. I added the assemblies to the visual-studio project; no good.

<pre><code>e = [1738738.0, 2019461.0, 1488842.0, 2272588.0, 1506046.0, 2448701.0, 3554207.0, 1659395.0, ...]
$redis.lpush ""analytics:math_test"", e
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, our lists of numbers max in the thousands to tens of thousands per list per day, with number of lists likely in the thousands per day. (This is not actually that much; however, we're growing, and expect much larger sample sizes very soon.)</p>

<p>For each of these lists, I'd like to be able to run stats. I currently do this in-app</p>

<pre><code>def basic_stats(arr)
  return nil if arr.nil? or arr.empty?
  min = arr.min.to_f
  max = arr.max.to_f
  total = arr.inject(:+)
  len = arr.length
  mean = total.to_f / len # to_f so we don't get an integer result
  sorted = arr.sort
  median = len % 2 == 1 ? sorted[len/2] : (sorted[len/2 - 1] + sorted[len/2]).to_f / 2
  sum = arr.inject(0){|accum, i| accum +(i-mean)**2 }
  variance = sum/(arr.length - 1).to_f
  std_dev = Math.sqrt(variance).nan? ? 0 : Math.sqrt(variance)

  {min: min, max: max, mean: mean, median: median, std_dev: std_dev, size: len}
end
</code></pre>

<p>and, while I could simply store the stats, I will often have to aggregate lists together to run stats on the aggregated list. Thus, it makes sense to store the raw numbers rather than every possible aggregated set. Because of this, I need the math to be fast, and have been exploring ways to do this. The simplest way is just doing it in-app, with 150k items in a list, this isn't actually too terrible:</p>

<pre><code>$redis_analytics.llen ""analytics:math_test"", 0, -1
=&gt; 156954
Benchmark.measure do
  basic_stats $redis_analytics.lrange(""analytics:math_test"", 0, -1).map(&amp;:to_f)
end 
=&gt;   2.650000   0.060000   2.710000 (  2.732993)
</code></pre>

<p>While I'd rather not push 3 seconds for a single calculation, given that this might be outside of my current use-case by about 10x number of samples, it's not terrible. What if we were working with a sample size of one million or so?</p>

<pre><code>$redis_analytics.llen(""analytics:math_test"")
=&gt; 1063454 
Benchmark.measure do
  basic_stats $redis_analytics.lrange(""analytics:math_test"", 0, -1).map(&amp;:to_f)
end
=&gt;  21.360000   0.340000  21.700000 ( 21.847734) 
</code></pre>

<h2>Options</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use the SORT method on the list, then you can instantaneously get min/max/length in Redis. Unfortunately, it seems that you still have to go in-app for things like median, mean, std_dev. Unless we can calculate these in Redis.</li>
<li>Use Lua scripting to do the calculations. (I haven't learned any Lua yet, so can't say I know what this would look like. If it's likely faster, I'd like to know so I can try it.)</li>
<li>Some more efficient way to utilize Ruby, which seems a wee bit unlikely since utilizing what seems like a fairly decent stats gem has analogous results</li>
<li>Use a different database.</li>

<p>Using a gem seems to gain me nothing. In Python, I'd probably write a C module, not sure if many ruby stats gems are in C.</p>

<pre><code>require 'statsample'
def basic_stats(stats)
  return nil if stats.nil? or stats.empty?
  arr = stats.to_scale

  {min: arr.min, max: arr.max, mean: arr.mean, median: arr.median, std_dev: arr.sd, size: stats.length}
end

Benchmark.measure do
  basic_stats $redis_analytics.lrange(""analytics:math_test"", 0, -1).map(&amp;:to_f)
end
=&gt;  20.860000   0.440000  21.300000 ( 21.436437)
</code></pre>

<h2>Coda</h2>

<p>It's quite possible, of course, that such large stats calculations will simply take a long time and that I should offload them to a queue. However, given that much of this math is actually happening inside Ruby/Rails, rather than in the database, I thought I might have other options.</p>

<p>Consider the following table:  </p>

<p><strong>EMPLOYEES</strong><br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4HE9s.png"" alt=""Employees table data"">  </p>

<p><em>married</em>, <em>certified</em> and <em>religious</em> are just boolean fields (in case of Oracle, they are of type NUMBER(1,0)).  </p>

<p>I need to come up with SQL that displays for each hire_year, count of married, certified and religious employees within the following salary categories:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> <code>SALARY &gt; 2000</code></li>
<li><strong>B</strong> <code>SALARY BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000</code></li>
<li><strong>C</strong> <code>SALARY &lt; 1000</code>  </li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the above dataset, here is what I expect to get:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pwSOj.png"" alt=""Expected result"">  </p>

<p>So far, I've only come up with the following SQL:  </p>

<pre><code>SELECT
COUNT(CASE WHEN married = 1 THEN 1 END) as MARRIED,
COUNT(CASE WHEN certified = 1 THEN 1 END) as certified,
COUNT(CASE WHEN religious = 1 THEN 1 END) as religious,
hire_year
FROM employees
GROUP BY hire_year;
</code></pre>

<p>The result of executing this SQL is:  </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aXC7o.png"" alt=""Actual result""></p>

<p>Which is almost what I need, but I also need to divide these counters further down into the groups based on a salary range.  </p>

<p>I guess that some <em>analytic</em> function, that divides groups into the buckets based on some SQL expression would help, but I can't figure out which one. I tried with <strong>NTILE</strong>, but it expects a positive constant as a parameter, rather than an SQL expression (such as <code>SALARY BETWEEN X and Y</code>).</p>

<p>But after the video starts playing, when I tap ""Done"" to close it, the video doesn't close/minimize to the frame/CGRect that the web view is in, it jumps to the bottom right for whatever reason, causing this really ugly effect where the user closes the video and the minimizing of it looks really glitched.</p>

<p>As you can see, Time 3 is missing. Often one or more could be missing. I can solve this on my own but am afraid I wouldn't be doing this the most efficient way. My approach would be to create a function that:</p>

<p>Generate a sequence of time periods from <code>min(Time)</code> to <code>max(Time)</code></p>

<p>Then do a <code>setdiff</code> to grab missing <code>Time</code> values.</p>

<p>Convert that vector to a <code>data.frame</code> </p>

<p>Pull unique identifier variables (<code>Id</code> and others not listed above), and add that to this data.frame. </p>

<p>Merge the two. </p>

<p>Return from function.</p>

<p>So the entire process would then get executed as below:</p>

<pre><code>   # Split the data into individual data.frames by Id.
    temp_list &lt;- dlply(original_data, .(Id)) 
    # pad each data.frame
    tlist2 &lt;- llply(temp_list, my_pad_function)

<p>Then I do a ton of looping and use tons of classes. The pointers to these monster objects get passed through about 6 or 7 classes.. one of which I need to set to NULL when its HP hits 0.</p>

<p>The URL includes <code>app_id=&lt;a href=""tel:178966552261433""&gt;178966552261433&lt;/a&gt;</code> which is exactly the error message. </p>

<p>Is it facebook API issue? I already grab <code>facebook.js</code> from <code>//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js</code></p>

<p>But the result is still the same.</p>

<p>I am unable to debug, for some strange reason my debugger auto-closes as soon as I start debugging. </p>

<p>Any suggestions on what could be the reason? I would like to mention that I have received the three .csi signature files from BlackBerry, but whenever I try to sign the application it fails: <strong>The Signature information in the code signing register request is not of appropriate length</strong>. Could this error be due to signing the application? </p>

<p>So I try to create de service file (nginx1.service):</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=MyTry
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=0
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill nginx
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm nginx
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/docker pull nginx-example
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx-example  
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop nginx
</code></pre>

<p>I submmited and started it but when I do:</p>

<pre><code>fleetctl list-units
nginx1.service  cbbed2c1.../IP  failed      failed
</code></pre>

<p>And I cant run the web server.
I think that the problem is in the service file but I dont know how to construct it.
Thank you.</p>

<p>like the title says, I'm in a bit of a pickle.</p>

<p>so here's the outline of my problem. I have this ship right. It rests in the center bottom of the screen (240,0). When the user touches to the right at a point greater than 240 the ship moves right. And left if the user touches at a point less than 240. HOWEVER this is great when there's only one finger on the screen at a time. I need it to where if the user touches right, doesn't lift their finger, then touches left (OH CRAP THERE'S TWO FINGERS ON THE SCREEN) the ship keeps moving right until they lift their right finger, then suddenly the ship moves left towards the second touch.</p>

<p>I'm using timers to add/subtract a number from the current x coordinate to get it to move.</p>

<p>This is what I have in a nutshell: (Don't laugh or hate I'm a noob)</p>

<pre><code>-(void)moveShipLeft:(id)sender {

 shipView.center = CGPointMake(shipView.center.x - 2, 320 - (shipView.image.size.height / 2));

}
-(void)moveShipRight:(id)sender { 

 shipView.center = CGPointMake(shipView.center.x + 2, 320 - (shipView.image.size.height / 2));

}
- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { 

 UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject];
 CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view];

 if (240 &lt; location.x){rightTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.01 target:self selector:@selector(moveShipRight:) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];}
 if (240 &gt; location.x){leftTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.01 target:self selector:@selector(moveShipLeft:) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];}

 [shipView setCenter:shipView.center];
 }
- (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {


  if (rightTimer != nil)               //Kill the timer that goes right upon touch removal
   [rightTimer invalidate];
  rightTimer = nil;

  if (leftTimer != nil)                //Kill the timer that goes left on touch removal
   [leftTimer invalidate];
  leftTimer = nil;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to fully replicate the controls for the game ""Radiant"" if its any help.
I will seriously love you forever if you help.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I want this to happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>user touches the right side of screen</li>
<li>ship moves right</li>
<li>user touches left side of screen with second finger</li>
<li>while the ship is still moving right because the user hasn't lifted their first touch, the user then lifts the first touch</li>
<li>THEN the ship instantly changes course to move left towards the second touch</li>
</ol>

<p>right now I have multi touch enabled, so now it works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>user touches the right side of screen</li>
<li>ship moves right</li>
<li>user touches left side of screen with second finger</li>
<li>ship moves left then user lift first touch</li>
<li>ship is stopped in its tracks even though the user hasn't lifted the second touch</li>
</ol>

"11493803","1","","","2012-07-15 16:54:32","","1","983","<p>I'm trying to get django setup on my greengeeks shared hosting account.</p>

<p>I (mostly) followed the instructions <a href=""http://www.codekoala.com/blog/2008/installing-django-shared-hosting-site5/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, and in addition have installed flup to my local python 'site-packages' directory.  </p>

<p>My python is 2.4.3, and I created a 'local' copy of it in <code>~/bin</code> and <code>~/lib/python2.4</code>.</p>

<p>I'm using django 1.3 (latest release that still supports python 2.4.x).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: 
ok, so last time it was about getting python working (and calling django)....</p>

<p>SO, I've got django working - if I run:</p>

<p>python /home/icebreak/www/cgi-bin/mysite.fcgi</p>

<p>then the django output gets printed to stdout.  Great!</p>

<p>HOWEVER, when I navigate to <a href=""http://www.icebreakersent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.icebreakersent.com</a>, whatever is printed to stdout from django doesn't appear!  Only the output that is printed in the mysite.fcgi file makes it to the browser.</p>

<p>To get around this issue, I edited the flup cgi server file to SAVE the data being sent to the stdout as a file.  Then, I load this file in the mysite.fcgi script and print it to the screen.  <strong>This WORKS</strong>.  <em>However</em>, it's a workaround for an issue I don't understand.</p>

<p>So, my question to you guys is - why is data that is being printed to stdout from within flup/django NOT showing in the browser?  And why is it showing just fine in the console?</p>

<p>My cgi file is called 'mysite.fcgi' and is located in my <code>~/public_html/cgi-bin</code> directory.
It's contents are:</p>

<pre><code>#!/home/icebreak/bin/python

<pre><code>Class A { virtual intfB(){} ; virtual intfC(){}; };
Class B : public A { int fB(){}; };
Class C : public A { int fC(){}; };
</code></pre>

<p>Then i have a class E that uses a list to store B and C objects. </p>

<pre><code>Class E 
{
public:
    insert(A* obj){ l.push_front(obj);}
    print(){ /* uses iterator i to cout the fB() and fC() of the objects in l */ };

private:
    list &lt;A*&gt; l;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I set different functions of the <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> objects as <code>virtual</code> in <code>A</code> and then use an iterator i to access the l objects from within the <code>print()</code> function. My problem is that i cannot find a proper way to call <code>B::fB()</code> and <code>C::fC()</code> because the iterator can point to either a <code>C</code> or <code>B</code> object so i have to do something like this for each object that i don' t think is that practical: </p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; (*i) -&gt; fB();
cout &lt;&lt; (*i) -&gt; fC();
</code></pre>

<p>So basicaly i call both <code>fC</code> and <code>fB</code> for every object regardless of type and the virtual function of the base class is called when it is not the correct object called. </p>

<p>This cannot be right tho, is it? How else can i achieve that? </p>

<p>On a side note should i use composition for classes E, C and B?</p>

<p><strong>What would be the best strategy to pass this cookie from a WCF client to our WCF services?</strong> The preferred method would be as tightly coupled with WCF's security architecture as possible.</p>

<p>So far I was leaning on either using <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/avnerk/archive/2006/04/26/Adding-custom-headers-to-every-WCF-call-_2D00_-a-solution.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">custom HTTP headers</a>, or <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WCF/Custom_Authorization_WCF.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">custom authorization</a> but I'm not convinced which is the more appropriate method, if any.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that for the ASP website, a new channel would be created for every request, while it would be reused on the Windows app.</p>

<li>use an <em>API key</em> and <em>google.load</em></li>

<p>I already use an API key to load jquery and it seemed like the best way to go about it when I read the following line:</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> they go on to say that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""the first method [webfont.js technique] is <strong>quicker</strong>""</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Q1</h3>

<p>They say that the webfont.js method is quicker but advise me to use the slower method on the grounds that I'm already using it to load other files from their network. Should I ignore their advice as a simple mistake on their part and use the faster method?</p>

As I have written above we are exporting big tables. They are very different and because of that we can't use static compiled templates (.jasper) and have to create jasper template dynamically. We are adding fields, text fields to JasperDesign using java. 
Recently we have discovered that after several exports we get OutOfMemory Error for PermGen space. 
After application profiling we have find out that when exporting data using JasperReports, for each export JRClassLoader loads new temp classes and they are never unloaded. See attached <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/hOW4i.png"" rel=""nofollow"">screenshot</a>. So every time the loaded classes count is rising and finally JVM throws an out of memory error!</p>

<p>This works great draws all the colored circles in random throughout the screen as I want it. Looks good. Here is the code for the Ball.java where the circles are drawn.</p>

<pre><code>Ball.java

package com.myapp.android;

import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.view.MotionEvent;
import android.view.View;

 }

        super.onDraw(canvas);
        canvas.drawCircle(x, y, r, mPaint);
    } 

}
</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to do is let the user touch any one of the colored circle and drag it on the screen wherever they want to but I cannot get them to move. I have not posted any trial code here.</p>

<p>What would be the best way to detect the user touch (this can be onTouch or onLongClick) on any of the circles drawn on screen (one circle at a time especially the one that is touched by the user) and thereafter make the circle (which is essentially a view added to the main Relative Layout View group at run time) to follow the users touch drag action (ACTION_MOVE - my guess) until they release the drag (ACTION_UP - my guess).</p>

<p>I have read some tutorials on this topic but none has been really helpful or applicable to my use case. Also I wanted to ask you knowledgeable guys should I use the 2D Graphics Canvas or OpenGL API in my case so that the drag operation on the circles are very smooth and instantaneous. Feel free to run my simple code, it works fine until the balls are drawn on the screen.</p>

b. The node once visited cannot be visited again. </p>

<p>White cells are represented by 0, black cells by 1 and grey cell by 2. </p>

<p>Based on my research, BFS won't work. I am not sure how to get DFS to work on this problem. Some people suggested A* search, but I am not sure how to deploy it here. Some suggest that first find the shortest path to grey cell, then from grey cell we find the shortest path to N-1, N-1. But I believe this will not work in some cases where the shortest path to grey cell blocks the path from grey cell to destination cell. For instance,</p>

<pre><code>-1 =&gt; start 
-2 =&gt; destination
0 =&gt; white space
1 =&gt; black space
2 =&gt; grey space

-1 0 0 0 0

0  1 0 2 0 
0  1 1 1 1 
0  0 0 0 -2

<ol>
<li>get 2 addresses from the user: One must be an ip address from the local machine and another a remote address ( a google address for example).</li>
<li>The application i'm writing will bind to the local address</li>
<li>The application will connect to the second address.</li>
</ol>

<p>I got some code from the Internet. You can see all the sources i had consulted on the comments.</p>

<pre><code>This application will only accepts a string from the client (which specifies the local
address which the application will bind), then, the app will connect to a remote service
google, youtube or whatever. The main purpose that this app serves is to know if, when
 binded to a local address, the operative system (in this case Windows Based system) gives priority to:
- SA/DA rule
- Forwarding table

<p>All translates work fine except one <code>'%value%' does not match the expected structure for a DNS hostname'</code>.

<p>I've <a href=""http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html"">read through the geolocation API spec</a> and from what I can understand, if you set the maximumAge to zero, you should always get a fresh position. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maximumAge attribute indicates that the application is willing to
  accept a cached position whose age is no greater than the specified
  time in milliseconds. If maximumAge is set to 0, the implementation
  must immediately attempt to acquire a new position object. Setting the
  maximumAge to Infinity must determine the implementation to return a
  cached position regardless of its age. If an implementation does not
  have a cached position available whose age is no greater than the
  specified maximumAge, then it must acquire a new position object. In
  case of a watchPosition(), the maximumAge refers to the first position
  object returned by the implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this is my code: </p>

<pre><code>function gpsSuccess(pos) {
   var positionDate = new Date(pos.timestamp);
   var currentDate = new Date();
   console.log(positionDate.toLocaleString(), currentDate.toLocaleString());
}
watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(gpsSuccess,
    gpsFail, {
        enableHighAccuracy: true,
        maximumAge: 0,
        timeout: 27000
});
</code></pre>

<p>And I'm seeing the following: </p>

<pre><code>Wed Nov 23 2011 10:25:43 GMT+0000 (GMT), Wed Nov 23 2011 10:52:16 GMT+0000 (GMT)
</code></pre>

<p>So that's half an hour's difference between the position obtained and the current time. </p>

<p>I thought it might just be the difference between the satellite time and the local time, but I've been hitting refresh repeatedly, and the positionDate isn't changing, even though the currentDate is. </p>

<p>Why is the same, cached position being reused, even though maximumAge is set to zero?</p>

<p>This is in Chrome, BTW. </p>

<pre><code>private JobSchedule scheduleExistingJob(JobSchedule schedule) throws SchedulerException
{
  JobInfo jobInfo = schedule.getJobInfo();

  Trigger trigger = QuartzUtils.createTriggerFromJobSchedule(schedule);

  trigger.setJobName(jobInfo.getName());
  trigger.setJobGroup(jobInfo.getGroup());
  DateTime nextRunDateTime = new DateTime(m_scheduler.scheduleJob(trigger));
  JobSchedule newSched = updateScheduleNextRunDateTime(schedule, nextRunDateTime);
  return newSched;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this old code, there are two syntax errors: one on <code>trigger.setJobName(jobInfo.getName());</code> and the other on <code>trigger.setJobGroup(jobInfo.getGroup());</code></p>

<p>Both are complaining that <code>The method setJobName(String) is undefined for the type Trigger</code>. No surprise there.</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out how to make this compatible in Quartz 2.x and this is what I've come up with so far:</p>

<pre><code>private JobSchedule scheduleExistingJob(JobSchedule schedule) throws SchedulerException
{
  JobInfo jobInfo = schedule.getJobInfo();

  JobDetail job = newJob()
      .withIdentity(jobInfo.getName(), jobInfo.getGroup())
      .build();

  Trigger trigger = QuartzUtils.createTriggerFromJobSchedule(schedule);

  Trigger t = newTrigger()
      .forJob(job)
      .build(); 

  DateTime nextRunDateTime = new DateTime(m_scheduler.scheduleJob(trigger));
  JobSchedule newSched = updateScheduleNextRunDateTime(schedule, nextRunDateTime);
  return newSched;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out how to incorporate the job info/group with the trigger.  It seems that in the new API I can't specify a generic trigger, it has to be either a Cron or a Simple. I may be over thinking everything too.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Here's the class and exception declaration:</p>

<pre><code>  QProcess* p = new QProcess();
  // ...maybe set QProcessEnvironment, set up stdout/stderr, etc....
  p-&gt;start(""cmd.exe"");
  p-&gt;write(""dir\n"");

  p-&gt;waitForReadyRead(-1/*forever*/);
  p-&gt;waitForFinished(-1/*forever*/);
  // ...read all text from process
</code></pre>

<p>The above works fine.  I could not get it to work properly under any permutation without <code>QProcess::closeWriteChannel()</code>, but I'd be interested if anyone is aware of an option (see below).</p>

<p>My understanding is that since I called <code>QProcess::closeWriteChannel()</code>, I can never re-open that channel.  However, since I went through the work of instantiating the <code>QProcess</code> and setting the <code>QProcessEnvironment</code>, I could merely start the process again (which re-opens the write-channel).</p>

<pre><code>// ...after previous run:
p-&gt;start(""cmd.exe"");
// ...use it again...
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine too.</p>

<p>So, I'm comparing TWO design options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Instantiate <code>QProcess</code> each time.</strong>  No re-use beyond a single command-line invocation.  Simple.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-use <code>QProcess</code>.</strong>  Do the work of ""remembering"" which <code>QProcess</code> instance has which <code>QProcessEnvironment</code> already set-up, so I can run commands in the appropriate environment.  Faster (no re-instantiation of <code>QProcess</code>, no re-set-up of <code>QProcessEnvironment()</code>), but requires more ""book-keeping"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>QUESTION:  How significant is the runtime overhead for instantiating <code>QProcess</code> and setting up the <code>QProcessEnvironment</code>?</strong>  </p>

<p>Significant?  I need to execute many thousands of command-line operations across many threads.  If it is ""big"", that steers me towards (2) (do-able, I've figured out how).  Otherwise, (1) is really simple, and I don't want to complicate things for no reason.</p>

<p>Yes, <em>""Premature optimization is the root of all evil.""</em>  I'm not trying to do that.  This system needs to massively scale.</p>

<h3>Example #1</h3>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;
void foo(T) {}

template &lt;class T&gt;
void foo(T&amp;) {}

int main()
{
  int i;
  foo&lt;int&gt;(i); // error: call is ambiguous! 
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Question:</em> Both functions are viable, that's obvious, but isn't the one taking <code>T&amp;</code> more specialized than <code>T</code>? Instead, the compiler raises <em>ambiguous call</em> error.</p>

<h3>Example #2</h3>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

template &lt;class T&gt;
struct X {};

template &lt;&gt;
struct X&lt;int&gt; 
{
  X() {}
  X(X&lt;int&amp;&gt; const&amp;) {} // X&lt;int&gt; is constructible from X&lt;int&amp;&gt;
  // note: this is not a copy constructor!
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct X&lt;int&amp;&gt; 
{
  X() {}
  X(X&lt;int&gt; const&amp;) {} // X&lt;int&amp;&gt; is constructible from X&lt;int&gt;
  // note: this is not a copy constructor!
};

template &lt;class T&gt;
void bar(X&lt;T&gt;) { std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; std::endl; }

template &lt;class T&gt;
void bar(X&lt;T&amp;&gt;) { std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; std::endl; }

int main()
{
  bar&lt;int&gt;(X&lt;int&gt;());   // calls void bar(X&lt;T&gt;) [with T = int]

  bar&lt;int&gt;(X&lt;int&amp;&gt;());  // calls void bar(X&lt;T&amp;&gt;) [with T = int]
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Question:</em> If the <code>T&amp;</code> and <code>T</code> are ambiguous in Example #1, then why here none call is ambiguous? <code>X&lt;int&gt;</code> is constructible from <code>X&lt;int&amp;&gt;</code>, as well as <code>X&lt;int&amp;&gt;</code> is constructible from <code>X&lt;int&gt;</code> thanks to provided constructors. Is it because compiler generated <code>X&lt;int&gt;::X(X&lt;int&gt; const&amp;)</code> copy-constructor is a <em>better conversion sequence</em> than <code>X&lt;int&gt;::X(X&lt;int&amp;&gt; const&amp;)</code>, (if so, what makes it better, note that arguments are passed by value), and so the ordering of specializations does not matter at all?</p>

<h3>Example #3</h3>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// note: a new type used in constructors!
template &lt;class U&gt;
struct F {};

template &lt;class T&gt;
struct X
{
  X() {}

  template &lt;class U&gt;
  X(F&lt;U&gt; const&amp;) {}  // X&lt;T&gt; is constructible from any F&lt;U&gt;
  // note: it takes F type, not X!
};

template &lt;class T&gt;
void qux(X&lt;T&gt;) { std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; std::endl; }

template &lt;class T&gt;
void qux(X&lt;T&amp;&gt;) { std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; std::endl; }

int main()
{
  qux&lt;int&gt;(F&lt;int&gt;());  // calls void qux(X&lt;T&amp;&gt;) [with T = int]

  qux&lt;int&gt;(F&lt;int&amp;&gt;()); // calls void qux(X&lt;T&amp;&gt;) [with T = int]
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Question:</em> Now this is similar scenario to <em>""matching lambda <code>[](int){}</code> against <code>std::function&lt;void(int&amp;)&gt;</code> and <code>std::function&lt;void(int)&gt;</code>""</em> from question linked. Why in both calls the <em>more specialized</em> function template is picked? Is it because the conversion sequence is the same, so partial ordering starts to matter?</p>

<p>The problem is that the first button in this layout does not align correctly with the other two. I have determined that this is caused by having medium text size on the first button.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/51ll9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I would like to display a longer string in the first button by simply using smaller sized of text and keeping the 3 buttons the same.</p>

<p>How can I fix the alignment?</p>

<p>I have used below two ways</p>

<p>//Create canvas, draw image in context and get the data url</p>

<pre><code>imgToDataURL =  function (img, outputFormat){
        var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
        canvas.width = 20;
        canvas.height = 20;
        var c = canvas.getContext('2d');
        c.height = img.height;
        c.width=img.width;
        c.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
        c.save();
        var dataurl = canvas.toDataURL(outputFormat);
        return dataurl;

    }

var img = new Image();
img.crossOrigin = 'Anonymous';
img.src = ""image path""
img.height= 60;
img.width=60;
var dataURL = this.imgToDataURL(img,""image/jpeg"");
renderer.pdf.addImage(dataURL, 'png',x+padding,y + this.internal.getLineHeight(),imageWidth,imageHeight);
</code></pre>

<p>This is printing wrong dataURL I am getting a white image. If I hard code the base64 code i.e return a hardcoded dataURL then addImage works fine. So the issue is with canvas.toDataURL which is giving me wrong output</p>

<p>this is the 2nd way</p>

<pre><code>convertImgToBase64URL =  function (url, callback, outputFormat){
    var img = new Image();
    img.crossOrigin = 'Anonymous';
    img.onload = function(){
        var canvas = document.createElement('CANVAS'),
        ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'), dataURL;
        canvas.height = this.height;
        canvas.width = this.width;
        ctx.drawImage(this, 0, 0);
        dataURL = canvas.toDataURL(outputFormat);
        callback(dataURL);
        canvas = null; 
    };
    img.src = url;
}

this.convertImgToBase64URL(""Image Path"",function(base64){

    renderer.pdf.addImage(base64, 'PNG', 20, 20,48,48);
})

<p>For API LEVEL >= 11 and API_LEVEL &lt; 11 fragment usage and base libraries are very different. 
For API_LEVEL>= 11 an activity class supports fragment 
however For API_LEVEL &lt;11 you need to use fragmentactivity class, which is derived from support library. 
So should I duplicate all activities ? Or should i create duplicate pacakages ? Or different projects ? </p>

I honestly need a tutor or someone to talk to in person to clear up some of these concepts, but I'm taking this c# class online and the professor refuses to communicate with me so my next step is to come here. I know this is a lot of material, but any guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>First of all the purpose of this assignment is to utilize inheritance in classes. Essentially you are supposed to created a base class called Account that initializes all your variables and set up get and sets for each one (which I'm not completely how to utilize these) as well as setting up Credit and Debit methods. Finally create a PrintAccount method that is going to be modified in the derived classes.</p>

<p>Next, create a SavingsAccount class that inherits everything from Account (I think I did this correctly by using "": Account"" when creating the class). Within it you are supposed to modify the PrintAccount method using override to have it provide additional information when it's called. After that, create a CheckingAccount class that inherits from Account as well. Now you have to modify Debit and Credit as well as PrintAccount. The directions say to modify Debit/Credit by ""invoking the Account class and use a boolean value to see if money was withdrawn."" No idea what that means. Also you're supposed to override PrintAccount again to make it display information specific to the class.</p>

<p>After all of that, make a test class to test everything that's been put into place. My initial problem is making sure all of my classes inherit correctly and I'm not doing anything unnecessary. Next when I override the PrintAccount classes I'm clearly doing something wrong. Finally, invoking the Account class to boolean test the Debit/Credit methods. </p>

<p>I'm fairly new to the using OAuth verification process and I'm having a minor issue getting a response from twitter. I followed along with <a href=""http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-authenticate-users-with-twitter-oauth--net-13595"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>I installed the Abraham TwitterOAuth php files using Composer.</p>

<p>composer file in my root with:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""require"": {
    ""php"": ""&gt;=5.5.14"",
    ""abraham/twitteroauth"": ""0.5.2""
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>updated and downloaded the package with</p>

<pre><code>composer update
</code></pre>

<p>Then I added my consumerKey, consumerSecret, oauthToken and oauthTokenSecret and then called the file with the following code</p>

<pre><code>$request_token = $twitterOAuth-&gt;oauth('http://localhost.com/twitter_oauth.php');
</code></pre>

<p>Running that I get:</p>

<pre><code>Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Abraham\TwitterOAuth\TwitterOAuthException' with message ' in /Webroot/workspace/twitter-auth-example/vendor/abraham/twitteroauth/src/TwitterOAuth.php on line 141
</code></pre>

<p>I can see the TwitterOAuthException.php file in the same folder as where it's being called from and not sure why the Exception can't be created. I've checked the Composer library version and whether it works with PHP 5.5.14 but I can't get further than this.</p>

<p>Extra: the url that gets sent off for the request is <strong><a href=""https://api.twitter.com/http://localhost.com/twitter_oauth.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://api.twitter.com/http://localhost.com/twitter_oauth.php</a></strong> so I'm not sure why the library would use</p>

<pre><code>$url = sprintf('%s/%s', self::API_HOST, $path);
</code></pre>

<p>in the preceding line. Is there more updates to the library I need to install. Running another update on Composer says there's nothing further to install. </p>

<p>Sorry for the few noob question but I'm missing something simple, I know it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The problem is that the main image is wraped in <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and when I add a class to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag the resize don't work.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Here is my markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a class=""thumb resize2"" name=""imagen1"" href=""images/400x400-1.jpg"" title=""imagen1""&gt;
&lt;img class=""resize1"" src=""images/400x400-1.jpg"" alt=""Title #0"" /&gt;

&lt;div class=""caption""&gt;
Any html can be placed here ...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
$(function() {
    $( "".resize1"" ).aeImageResize({ height: 70, width: 70 });
    $( "".resize2"" ).aeImageResize({ height: 10, width: 10 });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The resize script is perfect, but I need it to funcion on <code>&lt;a&gt;</code></p>

<p>P.D. I'm begginer in jQuery and scripting in general.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Here is screenshot how it is shown in browser:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RxJ5s.jpg"" alt=""Screen shot of the code""></p>

<p>Here is a fraction from galleriffic.js file</p>

<pre><code>var newSlide = this.$imageContainer
                    .append('&lt;span class=""image-wrapper current""&gt;&lt;a class=""advance-link"" rel=""history"" href=""#'+this.data[nextIndex].hash+'"" title=""'+imageData.title+'""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;')
                    .find('span.current').css('opacity', '0');

                newSlide.find('a')

                        gallery.clickHandler(e, this);
                    });
</code></pre>

<p>It ads advance-link class. </p>

<p>The question is: How can I add a class to the image in advance class container? I hope I've expressed myself correctly.</p>

<p>And then for example i want to search Velg..
And i get only Velg because the idCat has '2' and i using LIKE '2%'</p>

<p>But the problem is.. when i search BAn that the idCat is 1, i get
Bridgestone A and Bridgestone B, because the Bridgestone B has idCat 12 and it will be matched if i using LIKE '1%'</p>

<p>My question is, how to query to perform a search that only match with "","" separated..</p>

The vb.net dll communicates with a Fluke scope meter via an RS232 connection.  I have created a program that communicates correctly via RS232, giving me the anticipated value.  Though, when I package this up as a dll and access the dll from my Delphi program I always receive a value of ""1"", rather than the value I was expecting (most cases a value in and around 240).</p>

<p>I know that my delphi program is definitely communicating correctly with the dll and that my dll is definitely communicating with the scope meter.  It is just the value that is returned which is the issue!  Hopefully I have simply done something very silly here, but I can't see it and it is starting to drive me mad!</p>

<p>and let's say I want to do something with its series elements and that I would like to put in practice the advice 'vectorize the vectorizable'...  I import the XML library and do the following:</p>

<pre><code>R&gt; library(""XML"")
R&gt; doc &lt;- xmlTreeParse('/home/mario/Desktop/sample.xml')
R&gt; TimeSeriesNode &lt;- xmlRoot(doc)
R&gt; seriesNodes &lt;- xmlElementsByTagName(TimeSeriesNode, ""series"")
R&gt; length(seriesNodes)
[1] 3
R&gt; (function(x){length(xmlElementsByTagName(x[['series']], 'event'))}
+ )(seriesNodes)
[1] 6
R&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and I don't understand why I should only get the result of applying the function to the first element: I had expected three values, just as the length of seriesNodes, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>R&gt; mapply(length, seriesNodes)
series series series 
     7     10      6
</code></pre>

<p>oops!  I already came with the answer: ""use <code>mapply</code>"":</p>

<pre><code>R&gt; mapply(function(x){length(xmlElementsByTagName(x, 'event'))}, seriesNodes)
series series series 
     6      9      5
</code></pre>

<p>but then I see the following problem: the R-inferno tells me that I'm ""loop-hiding"", not ""vectorizing""!  can I avoid looping at all?  ...</p>

<p>How would you rewrite this in Ruby? Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Handling the intermixed <code>break</code> and <code>break loop</code>, and</li>
<li>Handling the occasional ""fall throughs"" that occur in the switch</li>
</ul>

<p>Presumably a good general strategy for these will get me through other situations, like the nested <code>object_init</code> breaking that also occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: How silly of me; a JavaScript ""fall through"" like this:</p>

<pre><code>switch(xxx){
  case a:
    aaa;
  case b:
    bbb;
  break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>can easily be rewritten in Ruby as:</p>

<pre><code>case xxx
  when a, b
    if a===xxx
      aaa
    end
    bbb
end

<p>Similarly, when I use the JS API, as in:</p>

<pre><code>var query = FB.Data.query('SELECT count FROM comments_info WHERE xid=""' + [...] + '""');
query.wait(function(rows){});

<p>I even tried recreating the application several times.</p>

<p>At this point, I've invested more hours than I'd care to admit :)
So, if anyone has experience with this problem, I'd be very appreciative — Facebook's documentation is no help at all, and their dev forums are pretty much dead.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I am using a tool called Robolectric for Eclipse to test Android applications on the host PC without emulation.  Robolectric requires a test project be created, but the tests themselves to be run from the Android project under test.  This is accomplished by from Eclipse, setting the run configuration to the project under test in the setting: ""Run all tests in the selected project, package or source folder.""</p>

<p>I want to do this from the JVM command line options, if possible, because another tool I use, <a href=""http://infinitest.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Infinitest</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/infinitest/infinitest/issues/39"" rel=""nofollow"">doesn't allow</a> you to specify the working directory of the tests.  It does, however, let you specify JVM command-line options.</p>

<p><strong>Workaround:</strong></p>

<p>Until I find a better workaround, a successful kluge has been to copy the AndroidManifest.xml and res folder from the Android project.  </p>

<pre><code>{

        two,

}

<p>That's the gist of what I'm trying to do. This is sort of a menu system for some context (and takeInput(5), will pause for input, stopping the loop until someone inputs a number). </p>

<p>What the problem is, is that using return in that way is apparently wrong. I figured that seeing as how (i thought) return is a function, i can't see why it wouldn't be able to be put into a function pointer array in order to break out of the menu. I suppose I could make a dummy function that basically just returns true when called, and check for that (the problem with that being that all the other functions return void).

<p>I have a Gridview in which the columns are mostly 'Itemtemplates' without any specific ID's assigned to them apart from the client ID given for the control inside them when rendered.</p>

<p>I am currently making changes to the existing page and few Client Id's for controls in the gridview appear in the Request.Form collection and few dont. 
 I need to add the client ID to the Request.Form collection and access it's value from there when posted back to the server.</p>

<p>How/when  do controls get added to the Request.Form collection? I am confused on this.

<p>/videos/video001 - nested route</p>

<p>/videos/video001/slide001 - not nested. It is on the same level as /videos.</p>

<p><strong>How I am doing this:</strong>  </p>

<p>I have following router: </p>

<pre><code>App.Router.map(function () {

});

<p>To make 'slide' route work as expected I am overriding 'serialize' method, and 
return 'video_id' and 'slide_id'</p>

<p>And at this point everything seems to be ok. At least page loads as expected. </p>

<p><strong>What is the issue?</strong></p>

<p>When I navigate to ""/videos/video001"" from ""/videos/video001/slide001"" via ""link-to' helper,
I see following error: ""Error while processing route: video"".
And nothing more. I can't understand what kind of error happens and 
why ember can't process route correctly. However I see that URL has been changed to ""/videos/video001"".</p>

How to debug this situation or at least get any useful error message? </p>

I already created a corpus for the title, remove punctuation, converted it to lowercase, etc. as follows:</p>

<pre><code>title = Corpus(VectorSource(posts$title))
title = tm_map(title, tolower)
title = tm_map(title, PlainTextDocument)
title = tm_map(title, removePunctuation)
title = tm_map(title, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
title = tm_map(title, stemDocument)
dtm = DocumentTermMatrix(title)
sparseTerms = removeSparseTerms(dtm, 0.99)
title = as.data.frame(as.matrix(sparseTerms))
title$great = posts$great
</code></pre>

<p>I did the same process for the <strong>body</strong> variable. After that, I used sample.split to separate a training and a testing set (for the title) and used the glm() function to use a logistic regression:</p>

<pre><code>library(caTools)
spl = sample.split(title$great, 0.7)
train = subset(title, spl = TRUE)
test = subset(title, spl = FALSE) 
Log = glm(great ~ ., data=train, family=binomial)
summary(Log)
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I use summary() I can see which variables are significant (3 stars). And, as you can see, I only used the <strong>title</strong> variable at glm(). So I'd like to know:</p>

<p><strong>1) How to keep only the variables with 3 stars?</strong><br>
<strong>2) How to combine the title and the body corpus so that I can use the glm() function with all the data?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I want the first function to execute, and then signal the second function to execute, which in turn signals the first function to execute again etc. </p>

<p>Two events were created, one initialized to a signaled state, the other unsignaled. The only way I can get the execution to flow as expected is when putting the each thread to sleep for 10 ms. I read about some caveats about using SetEvent:
<a href=""http://cboard.cprogramming.com/windows-programming/100818-setevent-resetevent-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cboard.cprogramming.com/windows-programming/100818-setevent-resetevent-3.html</a></p>

<p>My question is must I put my threads to sleep because these function calls require extra time to actually signal the events? When debugging sometimes an event that is set still remains unsignalled. I verify this using process explorer. My code basically looks like this:</p>

<p>in the main:</p>

<pre><code>//1. FinCalcpidUpdatestruct &lt;&lt;  initialize to unsignalled
//2. FinUpdatestructCalcpid &lt;&lt; initialize to signalled
FinCalcpidUpdatestruct = CreateEvent (NULL, FALSE, FALSE, TEXT(""FinCalcpidUpdatestruct""));
FinUpdatestructCalcpid = CreateEvent (NULL, FALSE, TRUE, TEXT (""FinUpdatestructCalcpid""));


void function1()
{
    int n;
    int noGoCode;
    n=0;

    noGoCode = 0;
    while(1)
    {
    //Sleep(10);
    noGoCode = WaitForSingleObject (FinCalcpidUpdatestruct, INFINITE);
    if (noGoCode == WAIT_OBJECT_0) {

    //wait for FinCalcpidUpdatestruct to be signalled
    BufferOut[n] = pid_data_array -&gt; output;

    //signal FinUpdatestructCalcpid 
    if(!SetEvent (FinUpdatestructCalcpid))
        printf(""Couldn't set the event FinUpdatestructCalcpid\n"");
    else{
        printf(""FinUpdatestructCalcpid event set\n"");
        Sleep(10);
        }
    }
    else
        printf(""error\n"");
    }
}

void function2()
{
    int nGoCode = 0;
    while(1)
    {
    //wait for FinUpdatestructCalcpid to be signalled

    // Sleep(10);
    nGoCode = WaitForSingleObject (FinUpdatestructCalcpid, INFINITE);
    if (nGoCode == WAIT_OBJECT_0) {
    if(!SetEvent (FinCalcpidUpdatestruct))
        printf(""Couldn't set the event FinCalcpidUpdatestruct\n"");
    else{
        printf(""FinCalcpidUpdatestruct event set\n"");
        Sleep(10);
        }
    }
    else
        printf(""error\n"");
    }//end while(1)

<p>If the sleep is not used then sometimes the same function will run through the while loop a couple of times instead of ping ponging back and forth between the two functions. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out the best way to tackle situations like this, in terms of code efficiency, compactness, and programmer ease.  Note that separate solutions addressing each of those points are fine, indeed preferable, as I doubt one solution hits all three.</p>

<p>For example, one possible solution that came to mind seems like it would be ungainly and slow, especially on a mobile device like android, plus it would only work if the variables were instance variables, and not merely local (which may very well be the case).  The idea involved a for statement whose initialization expression would use double-brace initialization to fill a hashmap with strings corresponding to the variables involved (e.g. ""installText"" maps to ""installPermission""), then the for-loop would contain one of the if--else-if--else-if clauses below, which would use reflection to access the variables by their names stored in the hashmap.</p>

<p>How can I do this better?  Thanks in advance for your time and advice!</p>

<p>I have a ""library"" of tools (Tools.c, Tools.h), shared by different teams. This library depends on a second one, providing XML-capabilities. Lets call that one XML.h Now one team uses a plain version of the second library (XML.h), while another team uses an extended version (XMLEx.h) in their project. The second team doesn't want to include the XML.h because they already have XMLEx.h included, providing all functions of XML.h.</p>

<p>Is there a mechanism to implement something like:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef XML_EX
#include ""XMLEx.h""
#else
#include ""XML.h""
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>only with the <code>#define XML_EX</code> on a higher (project) level? Like</p>

<pre><code>#include ""Tools.h""
</code></pre>

<p>for Team 1 and</p>

<pre><code>#define XML_EX
#include ""Tools.h""

<p>for Team 2? (I know that simple solution would not work, it's more to illustrate the desired ""workflow"".)</p>

<p>Boundary conditions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows system</li>
<li>CVI/LawWindows IDE </li>
<li>no make files </li>
<li>Tools.h should compile without an outer project.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:
For the suggested solution and the hint, that it is the common way, maybe it has something to do with my build process, but it doesn't work. The IDE is complaining about missing XML.h for team 2. I guess, it's because the IDE tries to compile each source standalone first, not knowing about the ""outer"" #define.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Let's pretend, team A is bunch of morons how could only hit the ""RUN"" button in the IDE. Therefore it best has to work out of the box.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Okay, it puzzled me. All I've learned tells me, it should work. Here is a minimal set, I've tested:</p>

<p>main.c</p>

<pre><code>#define XML_EX
#include ""Tools.h""

void main(void)
{
  test();
}
</code></pre>

<p>then Tools.h</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef XML_EX
  #include ""XMLEx.h""
#else
  #include ""XML.h""
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>XMLEx.h has the test function und XMLEx.c implements it. If I try to build, I get an ""XML.h not found"". Everything builds fine with a <code>#define XML_EX</code> in the Tools.h.</p>

        chart.draw(data, options);
    }; 
</code></pre>

<p>And in my case, the data is from a ajax request. So I change my code as:</p>

<pre><code>function drawRegionsMap() {
var jsonData = $.ajax({
        url: ""json/geo.pl"",
        dataType: 'json',
        async: false
        }).responseText;

            var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable(jsonData);

            var options = {};

            var chart = new google.visualization.GeoChart(document.getElementById('chart_div'));
            chart.draw(data, options);
        }; 
</code></pre>

<p>But it not works for me. The Error message in Firefox is ""Error: Not an array"". 
Hope someone can help me. Thanks!</p>

<p>The output of json/geo.pl is:
-bash-4.1$ json/geo.pl </p>

<p>Open a form in a lightbox to create a new ""event""; the opened form should be bookmarkable.</p>

<h2>The road blocks:</h2>

<ol>
<li>There are examples of opening a lightbox using <code>{{action}}</code> tags, but could not find one that opened in its own route.</li>
<li>There are many examples using older versions of ember.js.</li>
<li>There is not a lot of documentation related to ember-data and REST (I know, I know...it isn't ""production ready"").</li>
</ol>

<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>The fields in the form were not being tied to a backing model so ""null"" was being posted to my servlet (a Spring controller).</p>

<p>My very first iteration was not too far off from the <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/6thJ4/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">final outcome (jsfiddle)</a>. The thing that finally made it works swapping this:</p>

<pre><code>EP.EventsNewRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
    ...
    setupController : function(controller, model) {
        controller.set(""model"", model);
    },
    ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>...for this:</p>

<pre><code>EP.EventsNewRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
    ...
    setupController : function(controller, model) {
        this.controllerFor(""events-new"").set(""model"", model);
    },
    ...
});
</code></pre>

<h2>The question:</h2>

<p>Why does the setupController function need to call <code>controllerFor</code> in order to properly set up the model?</p>

<hr>

<p>And finally, since I struggled to find a fully-functional example, I wanted to make this accessible (and hopefully discover improvements).</p>

<p>Here's the fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/6thJ4/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/6thJ4/1/</a></p>

<p>Here are a few snippets.</p>

<h2>HTML:</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/x-handlebars""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            {{#linkTo ""events.new"" tagName=""li""}}
            Add Event
            {{/linkTo}}
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    {{outlet events-new}}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/x-handlebars"" data-template-name=""events-new""&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Event Name:&lt;/label&gt;
            {{view Ember.TextField valueBinding=""name""}}
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Host Name:&lt;/label&gt;
            {{view Ember.TextField valueBinding=""hostName""}}
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>JavaScript:</h2>

<pre><code>...
EP.Router.map(function() {
    this.resource(""events"", function() {
        this.route(""new"");
    });
});
EP.EventsNewRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
    model : function() {
        return EP.Event.createRecord();
    },
    setupController : function(controller, model) {
        //controller.set(""model"", model); // Doesn't work? Why not?
        this.controllerFor(""events-new"").set(""model"", model); // What does this do differently?
    },
    ...
});
EP.EventsNewController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({
    save : function() {
        this.get(""content.transaction"").commit(); // ""content.store"" would commit _everything modified_, we only have one element changed, so only ""content.transaction"" is necessary.
    }

any relevant answers to my problem.</p>

<p>I am trying to generate a dynamic sidebar for my website. I would like the controller to specify which sidebar
to load. As most of my pages use the same templating style, i have created template pages (header,footer,sidebar) which are included via
a the template view. I  pass the required sidebar  string to the template, which in turn loads the correct sidebar file.. 
 So far so good, or so i thought.</p>

<p>Using this method to generate a sidebar leaves me with a few problems..</p>

<p>1.) Each and every controller needs to pass the correct data down to the sidebar. As the number of controllers grow, this may
become problematic. It seems to be a sidebar controller is in order.. Everything i read however tells me that calling a controller from
within a controller is bad. </p>

<p>2.) The alternative seems to be to call models directly from the view.. Again as i understand it this breaks MVC login as 
processing and logic enters the view..  </p>

<p>Any input would be great.. Example code from a Controller, Template View and Current (incorrectly constructed) sidebar.. </p>

<pre><code>###### CONTROLLER EXAMPLE

      // Default settings

This might be the most complex piece of code I've ever started designing, and it has a requirement for easy upgrading, so I'm wanting to make sure I'm on the right track before I even start coding anything.</p>

<p>Essentially, there will be 3 main levels of classes. These two classes will need to talk with each other. </p>

<p>The first is the input source data. There are currently 2 main types of input data, which produce similar, but not identical output. The main goal of these classes will be to get the data from the two difference sources and convert it into a common interface, for use in the rest of the program. </p>

<p>The second set will be an adapter for an external library. The library has been periodically updated, and I have no reason to suspect that it will not continue to be updated throughout the years. Most likely, each upgrade will remain very similar to the previous one, but there might be some small changes made to support a new library version. This level will be responsible for taking the inputs, and formatting them for a use of an output class.</p>

<p>The last class is the outputs. I don't think that multiple versions will be required for this, but there will need to be at least two different output directories specified. I suspect the easiest thing to do would be to simply pass in an output directory when the output class is created, and that is the only level of abstraction required. This class will be frequently updated, but there is no requirement to support multiple versions.</p>

<pre><code>test:   var ?= foo

test:
        echo $(var)
</code></pre>

<p>make's docs say that <code>?=</code> assigns a variable that has not been
assigned before (undefined).
but if assigned via commandline:</p>

<pre><code>make var=1234
</code></pre>

<p>some random (ASCII, non-ASCII, whitespace only) characters instead of <code>1234</code> are printed to the terminal.
Using <code>=</code> instead of <code>?=</code> works as expected but cannot be used in my
case because it overrides 'inherited', exported assignments from a calling make.
Also if not using target-based but global assignment, the output
is as expected.
Where do these character sequences come from ?</p>

<p>I'm adding SSL to a TCP client I've written on my Android phone. I can
successfully connect to servers with properly signed certificates, and I can
connect to self-certifying hosts by cooking up a TrustManager implementation
that always thinks everything is fine.</p>

<p>I now have a decorator TrustManager capturing the certificates (before
delegating to its decoratee) for self-certifying hosts and presenting them for
my breathless perusal, but what I can't work out is how to implement ssh's 
behaviour of warning that a host is unknown and offering to remember it for
next time - and doing so.</p>

<p>I presumed all I needed was to store the public key - as ssh does with 
known_hosts - and re-represent it, but with this code and 'sslTrust' holding
the public key:</p>

<pre><code>TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(
    TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
ks.load(null, null); // initialise!
ks.setKeyEntry(""dbentry"", Base64.decode(sslTrust, Base64.NO_WRAP), null);
tmf.init(ks);
tms = tmf.getTrustManagers();
ss.stm = new SnoopyTrustManager((X509TrustManager) tms[0]);
// ...
SLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance(""SSL"");
context.init(null, new TrustManager[] { ss.stm } , null);
ss.factory = context.getSocketFactory();
// ...
SocketFactory factory = ss.getFactory();
mSocket = factory.createSocket(host, port);
</code></pre>

<p>attempting to establish a connection results in</p>

<pre><code>SSLHandshakeException: InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: trustAnchors.isEmpty()
</code></pre>

<p>which is fair enough: I don't know how to cook things up from the certificate 
offered by the remote server. I'm also fairly sure this isn't how I tell a
TrustManager about a remote server's public key anyway.</p>

<p>Since the site is self-certifying, I imagine could probably just verify that
the public keys match in a trivial TrustManager, but I'd like to understand
how this 'should' be done - adding a CA on a per-connection basis, since
I won't trust that CA for anything else.</p>

It jumps (no surprise as I am translating by a factor of 1) to each of the translated locations.  My question is how can I get the model to move across the screen without showing this jerky/jumping animation effect.
I have tried reducing the translation factor but that of course slows down the movement too much.
The following code block is in the display(GLAutoDrawable drawable){} routine:</p>

<pre><code>for (float x = -8;x &lt; 8; x+=2){
    for (float z = -8; z &lt; 8; z+=2){

        view2 = rotate(view,(float)20,(float)1,(float)0,0); //rotate 30deg on x

        //rotate the model. spin on Y. (rotate is a custom func - not using 
        //old glRotate)
        view2 = rotate(view2,(float)rotAngle,(float)0,(float)1,0); 

        //transX and transY are incremented/decremented by 1 every time
        //the KeyPressed event is fired.  Animator running at 60fps.
        //translate() is a simple matrix multiplier.  This is where
        //the model gets its new co-ordinates (that it jumps to...)
        view2 = translate(view2, (float)transX - x, 0, transZ - z);

        //pass transform to the vertex shader
        gl.glUniformMatrix4fv(iView, 1, false, view2, 0);

        //the projection matrix (static)
        gl.glUniformMatrix4fv(iProj, 1, false, projection, 0);

        gl.glDrawArrays(GL3.GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 36); //draw 12 triangles (36 vertices).

<p>There are a couple of things I don't like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the EventRegistry class I store storing them twice, once in an Event Dictionary key being the name, and value a list of categories.  The second is the opposite Category dictionary keyed by category name and a list of events.   Is there a better way to achieve this?  I basically need an easy way to look up by name or category.</p></li>
<li><p>Should I just create two registries?  One for Categories one for Events?</p></li>
<li><p>When it comes to using the Events we do it like:</p>

<p><code>self.subscribe(Event.MyComponent.Useful)</code>
 <code>self.subscribe(Category.MyComponent.Useful)</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>we then use the registry to validate the event exists, as well as deliver the message.  Is there an easier way to achieve the package like namespaces?</p>

<p>Just looking for some feedback on better ways to do it, or a pattern to follow.  I have searched around and can't find anything.  Even if you know of some module i can look at and get a better feel for a better way to do it, ill be glad to look into that as well.</p>

<pre><code>mysql_query(""SELECT u_id FROM posts WHERE id IN (SELECT p_id FROM post_groups WHERE g_id='"" . $group['id']. ""') AND date &gt;= '"" . $d_start . ""' AND date &lt;= '"" . $d_end . ""'"");

<p>To better explain this, say a user with <code>u_id = 6</code> posts five workouts this week. The array generated by the above query should contain <code>6</code> a total of five times. This is done for every workout posted by users in the week - so I end up with a large array full of duplicate user ids.</p>

<p>What I am looking to do is, instead, return an array of size 10 that contains the <code>u_id</code>s that appear most frequently in the array above. So, if <code>u_id = 6</code> appeared the most frequently in the above array, let's say 10 times, and <code>u_id = 8</code> appeared the second most frequently, let's say 9 times, then the array that I wish to return would have a value of <code>6</code> at [0] and a value of <code>8</code> at [1], etc.</p>

<p>I am not sure how to trim down this array and sort it by most frequent occurrences of <code>u_id</code>, as my SQL skills are a little lacking at this moment. I was hoping someone would be able to shed some light on the ideal query that I am looking for. I appreciate your help!</p>

<pre><code>private void FormMain_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

} 

private void FormMain_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)
{
    Properties.Settings.Default.Save();
}
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance, this looks reasonable. However, once you consider what actually transpires inside the save and (implicit) load operations, namely disk I/O, it appears a bit suspect. Doesn't it stand against the principle of avoiding potentially long running operations in general and especially I/O on the GUI thread?</p>

<p>I realize that in the vast majority of cases we're talking about very small files located on a local hard drive, but I can come up with scenarios where the operation would take some time to complete if I really wanted to (disk was put to sleep, disk is under stress, disk is actually network storage, etc).</p>

<p>Also, it's not clear what I should do about it. Startup is easy enough to handle, disabling the GUI while the settings are loading asynchronously. But what about the close event? Sure, I could cancel the event, save asynchronously, and then close it myself but it gets a little messy as I need to take care of cases where the user tries to close it again before I finished saving (so I don't initiate another save, or exit while in the middle of saving etc). And I'm not sure it can even be done (at least simply) in other frameworks, say GTK# where the OnDeleteEvent is typically used when it's too late. I suppose I could fire a foreground thread and save it there, but then the user might think the application is closed and run it again before the settings were actually saved (and there could be other consequences for having multiple instances of it alive regardless).</p>

<p>Should I be worried about such scenarios or am I overthinking it?</p>

<p>This runs the select query and if no results are returned, runs the begin/end block. It declares a message variable and sends this, along with some other values, to a logging stored procedure before returning from the method.</p>

<p>I'm on a project now though where I have to convert all of this stuff into Oracle (which I have zero familiarity with). I ran it through the scratch editor in Sql Developer and got this:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
    SELECT 1
    INTO v_temp
    FROM DUAL
    WHERE NOT EXISTS
      ( SELECT ID FROM ID WHERE IDTABLE = v_ID
      );

  IF v_temp = 1 THEN

      v_RETVAL := 0 ;
      RETURN;
    END;
  END IF;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I get what it's trying to do - it's just taking a few more steps to do it, saving the results of the select statement into v_temp and then if it is set to equal 1, running the if block.</p>

<p>However, I've a few queries. Firstly, some simple googling has taught me that the first Exception block (when others then null) is terrible practice. What would an alternative be in this situation, or is it acceptable given the following if statement? Secondly, is this entire rewrite necessary, or is it possible to amalgamate the if and select statements (similar to the SQL above) to make things a little more succinct?</p>

<p>What I need to do is quite simple, I want to manually display preview from camera using camera callback and I want to get at least 15fps on a real device. I don't even need the colors, I just need to preview grayscale image.
Images from camera are in YUV format and you have to process it somehow, which is the main performance problem. I'm using API 8.</p>

<p>In all cases I'm using camera.setPreviewCallbackWithBuffer(), that is faster than camera.setPreviewCallback(). It seems that I cant get about 24 fps here, if I'm not displaying the preview. So there is not the problem.</p>

<p>I have tried these solutions:</p>

<p><strong>1. Display camera preview on a SurfaceView as a Bitmap.</strong> It works, but the performance is about 6fps.</p>

<pre><code>baos = new ByteOutputStream();
yuvimage=new YuvImage(cameraFrame, ImageFormat.NV21, prevX, prevY, null);

yuvimage.compressToJpeg(new Rect(0, 0, prevX, prevY), 80, baos);
jdata = baos.toByteArray();

bmp = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(jdata, 0, jdata.length); // Convert to Bitmap, this is the main issue, it takes a lot of time

canvas.drawBitmap(bmp , 0, 0, paint);
</code></pre>

<p><hr/></p>

<p><strong>2. Display camera preview on a GLSurfaceView as a texture.</strong> Here I was displaying only luminance data (greyscale image), which is quite easy, it requires only one arraycopy() on each frame. I can get about 12fps, but I need to apply some filters to the preview and it seems, that it can't be done fast in OpenGL ES 1. So I can't use this solution. Some details of this in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8198455/adjusting-contrast-of-a-texture-in-opengl-es"">another question</a>.
<hr/></p>

<p><strong>3. Display camera preview on a (GL)SurfaceView using NDK</strong> to process the YUV data. I find a solution <a href=""http://nhenze.net/?p=253"">here</a> that uses some C function and NDK. But I didn't manage to use it, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8303370/how-to-use-c-function-on-android-with-ndk"">here some more details</a>. But anyway, this solution is done to return ByteBuffer to display it as a texture in OpenGL and it won't be faster than the previous attempt. So I would have to modify it to return int[] array, that can be drawn with canvas.drawBitmap(), but I don't understand C enough to do this.
<hr/></p>

<p>So, is there any other way that I'm missing or some improvement to the attempts I tried?</p>

<p>-UIView
--UIScrollView
---UIView</p>

<p>I'm using autolayout and storyboards. I've designed the storyboard to layout correctly on an iPhone5, and tried to use constraints to make this outer view expand and contract to the other screen sizes. It expands perfectly for the 6 / 6+, but it does not contract correctly for the 4. Here is a screenshot of my storyboard along with some of the constraints:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ooPx6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The outer view may seem excessive, but I need it to draw a rounded border as I was unsuccessful drawing the border directly around the scrollview. Here is what the screen looks like when rendered on the 4"" screen (this is what it should look like):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UHzT2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But then when I run it on a 3.5"" screen, that view does not shrink. It just spills off the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>I've been going in circles trying to figure this out for hours now, and am getting nowhere. I've played with content hugging and compression resistance, along with modifying just about every constraint in the storyboard. I don't want to get into fixed heights, since that defeats the very purpose of autolayout. Can anyone suggest what I should look at? Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: I should also point out that I know that the the bottom button will be truncated when the outer scrollview and view are shortened. That's fine for now.

<p>To my knowledge, there is no clear statement as to how weak references influence the lifetime of an object in .NET. If they are true weak refs they should not influence it at all, but that would also render them pretty useless for their, I believe, main purpose of caching (am I wrong there?). On the other hand, if they act like soft refs, their name is a little misleading.</p>

<p>Personally, I imagine them to behave like soft references, but that is just an impression and not founded.</p>

<p>Implementation details apply, of course. I'm asking about the mentality associated with .NET's weak references - are they able to expand lifetime, or do they behave like true weak refs? </p>

The dataset ranges over several orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to ~1000. So far I've written code for the packages NNet, NeuralNet, and RSNNS. With all of them, my network can fit the training data superbly, with R2 values of >0.95 and small error margins. When applied to a test dataset (~20% of my total available data), the models falls over with terrible predictive capabilities. My code is below; please be gentle on my programming skills! Very new at this ;)</p>

<p>I normalize in this code using the normalizeData function inherent to RSNNS, and mix up my rows at the start with a simple sample function.</p>

<pre><code>library(neuralnet)
library(RSNNS)

mydata &lt;- read.csv(""NewforNeuralNet.csv"")
my.dta &lt;- data.frame(mydata[,10:27])
smy.dta &lt;- my.dta[sample(nrow(my.dta)),]

y &lt;- smy.dta[,1]
x &lt;- smy.dta[,2:18]

ny &lt;- normalizeData(y,type=""norm"")
nx &lt;- normalizeData(x,type=""norm"")

ytrain &lt;- ny[0:115,]
xtrain &lt;- nx[0:115,]

ytest &lt;- ny[116:143,]
xtest &lt;- nx[116:143,]

RS &lt;- mlp(xtrain,ytrain, size=c(5),linOut=T, maxit=500)
RSPRED &lt;- predict(RS,xtrain)
RSPRED &lt;- denormalizeData(RSPRED, getNormParameters(ny))

plot(ytrain,RSPRED)
model &lt;- lm(ytrain~RSPRED)
summary(model)
</code></pre>

<p>This results in a nice model with RSE=~0.25, AR2 = 0.944 etc etc. 
Now to the blind data set:</p>

<pre><code>blind &lt;- predict(RS,xtest)
blind &lt;- denormalizeData(blind,getNormParameters(ny))
ytest &lt;- denormalizeData(ytest,getNormParameters(ny))
plot(ytest,blind,log=""xy"")
model2 &lt;- lm(ytest~blind)
summary(model2)
</code></pre>

<p>This results in very poor predictions with very high errors. As stated in the code, 16 predictors, 143 rows of data. Not sure whats going on here, perhaps it is simply not a large enough dataset. Any input would be welcome at this stage! Thanks guys</p>

This time, however, it probably represents a crutch that keeps me from understanding what's going on in the back end in order to know what to feed named_scope.</p>

<p>I'm trying to return the top 10 records of a table that represent the highest scoring ""actors"" in a game. Score is calculated via Actor>Acts>Decsisons.point_value</p>

<p>I can get the score for any individual actor easily enough, but the joins and sum are above my SQL understanding in order to scope it for the top 10 out of the whole db.</p>

<p>Here is the Actor model as I have it currently:</p>

<pre><code>class Actor &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :acts, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :decisions, :through =&gt; :acts, :order =&gt; 'created_at'

  named_scope :high_scores, {
    :conditions =&gt; {:finished =&gt; true}, 
    :joins =&gt; ""INNER JOIN acts ON actor.id = acts.actor_id INNER JOIN decisions on decision.id = decision.act_id"", 
    :group =&gt; 'actor.id',
    :select =&gt;'actors.*, SUM(acts.decisions.point_value) AS score', 
    :order =&gt; ""score DESC"", 
    :limit =&gt; 10
  }

end
</code></pre>

<p>After trying out a few things based on some posts here and on some other sites, I'm obviously not grasping what's going on or what named_scope needs to connect the dots. Some clarity would be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>*Edit: Updated named_scope to what I currently have</p>

<p>This now gives me the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mysql::Error: Unknown column 'acts.decisions.point_value' in 'field list': SELECT actors.*, SUM(acts.decisions.point_value) AS score FROM <code>actors</code>  INNER JOIN acts ON actor.id = acts.actor_id INNER JOIN decisions on decision.id = decision.act_id WHERE (<code>actors</code>.<code>finished</code> = 1)  GROUP BY actor.id ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10</p>

<p>Take underscore.  It would be nice if within some fixed scope we could avoid having to define a variable for each any every function but be able to call them without the namespace.</p>

<pre><code>//protect global namespace
(function(){
  var map = _.map, filter = _.filter; //etc. -- gimme all the methods
  function toUpperCase(x){
    return x.toUpperCase();
  }
  function minSize(len){
    return function(size){
       return size &gt;= len;
    }
  }
  var stooges = map(filter([""Larry"", ""Curly"", ""Moe""], minSize(4)), toUpperCase);

})();
</code></pre>

<p>The desire would be this:</p>

<pre><code>import * from 'underscore';
...
var stooges = map(filter([""Larry"", ""Curly"", ""Moe""], minSize(4)), toUpperCase);
</code></pre>

<p>See that I'm using <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> without having explicitly imported them.</p>

<p>Other languages allow this.</p>

<p>In the ES6 spec, I saw this:</p>

<pre><code>import {sum, pi} from 'math';
</code></pre>

<p>but not this:  </p>

<pre><code>import * from 'math';
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using <code>*</code> to signify ""everything"" not that it's real <code>import</code> syntax.</p>

<p>I know even is SQL you're told to avoid <code>SELECT *</code> and to be particular; however, when you're developing an application you're not necessarily sure what specific methods you'll need and it can be painful to have continually check and update the import statement.  When the application/library stabilizes, you can narrow the <code>import *</code> to the specifics.</p>

<p>So my goal is to have PNG icons in my WPF app to display clearly under the default 100% Windows DPI settings (96 DPI) as well as for 125% (120 DPI), 150% (144 DPI), and 200% (192 DPI) to support the more and more popular hi-res 2K and 4K displays.</p>

<p>So this is what I have been testing:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have 4 variations of a 32 x 32 PNG image, they are set to 96, 120, 144, and 192 DPI respectively.</li>
<li>I loaded all 4 with an <code>Image</code> control like this:
<code>
&lt;StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;Image Source=""image_96_dpi.png"" Stretch=""None"" /&gt;
    &lt;Image Source=""image_120_dpi.png"" Stretch=""None"" /&gt;
    &lt;Image Source=""image_144_dpi.png"" Stretch=""None"" /&gt;
    &lt;Image Source=""image_192_dpi.png"" Stretch=""None"" /&gt;
&lt;/StackPanel&gt;
</code></li>
<li>The rendering result I got is as follow:

<ul>
<li>Render size for image_96_dpi.png: 32 x 32</li>
<li>Render size for image_120_dpi.png: 26 x 26</li>
<li>Render size for image_144_dpi.png: 32 x 32</li>
<li>Render size for image_192_dpi.png: 16 x 16</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The result for 96, 120, and 192 dpi make sense, they all get scaled down properly but I don't get how the 144 dpi image also gets rendered as 32 x 32. The dpi is literally 150% to the default Windows dpi but it is rendered as a 96 dpi image.</p>

<p>Is this some sort of a bug?</p>

The COUNTRIES array also comes from there.</p>

            textView.showDropDown();

<p>I have a ClassA that contains an inner ViewClass that extends view.  From ClassA, I call DialogCreator Class that extends ClassA and displays a dialog.  From the dialog listview, you can select an item that needs the ViewClass to redraw.  No matter how I send context, I get a null pointer context error.</p>

<p>ClassA constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassA extends Basclass{ // Baseclass extends Activity
   public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
      context = this;
   }
</code></pre>

<p>ClassA relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>// Coming in from Menu for deleting or changing database tables
DialogCreator dc = new DialogCreator(context, id);
dc.onCreateDialog(title, list, mode);

    protected class ViewClass extends View{
         // Constructor
        public ViewClass(Context context){
             super(context); // Mainly crashes HERE
        }
           // Initializes rects, then draws via an OnDraw method
   }
</code></pre>

<p>DialogCreator constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public class DialogCreator extends ClassA {
    DialogCreator(Context context, int dialogID){
     this.context = context;
     this.dialogID = dialogID;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside DialogCreator: </p>

<pre><code>protected Dialog onCreateDialog(String title, final ArrayList list, final String mode) {
   // build alertdialog listView
   public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view, int position, long id) {
       // User choices, etc... 
       ViewClass v = new ViewClass(context);
       setContentView(v); 
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternate OnCreateDialog would not try to setContentView... it calls a method in ClassA that tries to set it.  Both fail.</p>

<p>I've tried passing the activity into DialogCreator, I've tried using the getXcontext() from both classes.  I've even tried to stick a method in the ClassA that is called from DialogCreator class that uses the ClassA context.  Clearly I am missing a very important understanding of context somewhere.  Every way I try to define context, I crash with similar error as per LogCat below:</p>

<pre><code>FATAL EXCEPTION: main
java.lang.NullPointerException
at android.app.Activity.startActivityForResult(Activity.java:3351)
at android.app.Activity.startActivityForResult(Activity.java:3312)
at android.app.Activity.startActivity(Activity.java:3522)
at android.app.Activity.startActivity(Activity.java:3490)
</code></pre>

<p>I'd be grateful for an unspin in the right direction.</p>

<p>Everything works perfectly if I keep all the code in the ClassA.  Once I move the call to redraw into the DialogCreator, I get the context errors.</p>

<p>My code will create the graphs, and size them perfectly, but it won't actually graph any of the data points. In my code, I also add and delete series, and I notice that the number of series is correct on the side, but that the series didn't retain the custom names I gave them.</p>

<p>But here's the twist. When I right click on the chart and click ""select data"", all of the data immediately pops up, including all of my custom names for the series. I don't even go into select data or anything. The moment I click it, all of the values just pop up immediately.</p>

<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/WPJFO"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is an imgur album of what it looks like before/after. Note that I do absolutely nothing other than right click and select the option ""select data"".</a> It's like the data is already selected, but just doesn't show up until I click 'select data"".</p>

<p>Why would Excel 2013 be doing this? How do I make these values actually show up via VBA methods? I'll add a sample of the graphing code I use below.</p>

<p>Each message should look like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;int id&gt;&lt;float array data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On the receiver side, it knows exactly how many arrays are there, and thus sets up exact number of recvs.  Upon receiving a message, it parses the id and put data into the right place.  The problem is that a message could be sent from any other processes to the receiving process.  (e.g. the producers have a work queue structure, and process whichever id is available on the queue.)  </p>

<p>Since MPI only guarantees P2P in order delivery, I can't trivially put integer id and FP data in two messages, otherwise receiver might not be able to match id with data.  MPI doesn't allow two types of data in one send as well.  </p>

<p>I can only think of two approaches. </p>

<p>1) Receiver has an array of size m (source[m]), m being number of sending nodes.  Sender sends id first, then the data.  Receiver saves id to source[i] after receiving an integer message from sender i.  Upon receiving a FP array from sender i, it checks source[i], get the id, and moves data to the right place.  It works because MPI guarantees in-order P2P communication.  It requires receiver to keep state information for each sender.  To make matter worse, if a single sending process can have two ids sent before data (e.g. multi-threaded), this mechanism won't work.  </p>

<p>2) Treat id and FP as bytes, and copy them into a send buffer.  Send them as MPI_CHAR, and receiver casts them back to an integer and a FP array.  Then I need to pay the addition cost of copying things into a byte buffer on sender side.  The total temporary buffer also grows as I grow number of threads within an MPI process.  </p>

<p>Neither of them are perfect solutions.  I don't want to lock anything inside a process.  I wonder if any of you have better suggestions.</p>

<p>Edit: The code will be run on a shared cluster with infiniband.  The machines will be randomly assigned.  So I don't think TCP sockets will be able to help me here.  In addition, IPoIB looks expensive.  I do need the full 40Gbps speed for communication, and keep CPU doing the computation.  </p>

<p>When I click on a QLabel, I can use the mousePressEvent in QWidget. But when I click on QLineEdit, I can't detect the mousePressEvent in QWidget - only in the QLineEdit. I think that it is related to how QLineEdit works - I don't know the way to get mouse events within the whole region.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/uUxKH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I have made a custom channel box for Maya like above. I try to select multiple channels by dragging the mouse. But as I mentioned, in the QLineEdit regions I can't do this.</p>

<pre><code>class channelWidget(QtGui.QWidget):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
    super(channelWidget, self).__init__(parent)
    self.resize(180, 20)        
    self.setMinimumSize(180, 20)
    self.setMaximumHeight(20)
    self.attr_label = QtGui.QLabel(self)
    self.attr_label.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(5, 0, 110, 20))
    self.attr_label.setAlignment(QtCore.Qt.AlignRight|QtCore.Qt.AlignTrailing|QtCore.Qt.AlignVCenter)
    self.value_field = focusLineEdit(self)
    self.value_field.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(120, 0, 60, 20))
    self.value_field.setAlignment(QtCore.Qt.AlignLeft|QtCore.Qt.AlignLeading|QtCore.Qt.AlignVCenter)
    self.value_field.setValidator(QtGui.QDoubleValidator())
</code></pre>

<p>Each element consists of a QLabel and a QLineEdit.</p>

<pre><code>class channelContainerWidget(QtGui.QWidget):
  def updateChannel(self, node="""", attrList=[]):
    _l = self.channel_layout
    _list = []
    for w in [_l.itemAt(i).widget() for i in range(_l.count()) if _l.itemAt(i).widget()]:
      if w in self._selectList: _list.append( str( w.attr_label.text() ) )
        sip.delete(w)

    _selList = []

      _item.attr_label.setText(at)
      _item.value_field.setText(value)
      _l.insertWidget(_id, _item)

<p>And the containing widget works as above. When I click on QLabel region, I can get mouse events, but when I click on the QLineEdit region, I can't.</p>

Does anyone know if this is possible, and, if so, how to go about it?</p>

<p>More specifically, we'd like to add education data for our people. We kind of envision one education entry as including the degree / course of study, concentration / major, year, and institution. We'd also like for each user to be able to have multiple entries. It seems to me that, in an ideal, world, we'd be able to create a custom field control to handle the editing.

<p>My plan B would be to simply pass the datasource as an Enumerable and then order by in the report itself, but I wanted to have all the logic in the code, not in the RDLC..</p>

<p>I am using custom Dataset to build the report as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    public byte[] GetReport(ReportFormat reportFormat)
    {
        MyReportDataSource myReportDataSource = GetMyReportDataSource(reportFormat);

        ReportDataSource dsDetails = GetDetailsDataSource(myReportDataSource);
        ReportDataSource dsRows = GetRowsDataSource(myReportDataSource);

        LocalReport localReport = new LocalReport();
        localReport.ReportPath = ""pathToMyRdlc.rdlc"";
        localReport.DataSources.Add(dsDetails);
        localReport.DataSources.Add(dsRows);

        Warning[] warnings;
        string encoding;
        string fileNameExtension;
        string[] streams;

        byte[] reportBytes = localReport.Render(""pdf"", null, PageCountMode.Actual,
                        out mimeType, out encoding, out fileNameExtension, out streams, out warnings);

        return reportBytes;
    }

    private MyReportDataSource GetMyReportDataSource(ReportFormat reportFormat)
    {
        MyReportDataSource r = new MyReportDataSource();
        r.ReportFormat = ReportFormat.A;
        //some test rows
        Row row1 = new Row
        {
            Name = ""Joe"",
            LastName = ""Doe"",
            Age = 42
        };
        Row row2 = new Row
        {
            Name = ""Jane"",
            LastName = ""Doe"",
            Age = 26
        };
        Row row3 = new Row
        {
            Name = ""Joe"",
            LastName = ""Smith"",
            Age = 31
        };
        r.AddRow(row1);
        r.AddRow(row2);
        r.AddRow(row3);
        return r;
    }

    private ReportDataSource GetDetailsDataSource(MyReportDataSource myReportDataSource)
    {
        //ReportDataSource only accepts dataTable or IEnumerable, use IEnumerable but with single element as workaround
        List&lt;MyReportDataSource&gt; listSingleItem = new List&lt;MyReportDataSource&gt;();
        listSingleItem.Add(myReportDataSource);

        ReportDataSource detailsDataSource = new ReportDataSource(""DSDetails"", listSingleItem.AsEnumerable());
        return detailsDataSource;
    }

    private ReportDataSource GetDeclarationRowsDataSource(MyReportDataSource myReportDataSource)
    {
        ReportDataSource rowsDataSource = new ReportDataSource(""DSRows"", myDataSource.Rows);
        return rowsDataSource;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>so basically I'm passing to the local report two datasources, one <code>DSDetails</code> is for the details (where the specified format is) and the other <code>DSRows</code> for an internal Enumerable which has the data I want to display in the table. This would be my custom datasource object</p>

<pre><code>public class DeclarationReportDataSource
{
    public ReportFormat ReportFormat { get; set; }

    private decimal _totalAge;
    public decimal TotalAge
    {
        get
        {
            return Math.Round(this._totalAge, 2);
        }
    }
    private List&lt;Row&gt; _Rows = new List&lt;Row&gt;();
    //HERE IS THE PROBLEM
    //This is the method that returns an IEnumerable ordered by
    //depending on the format
    //There is no problem to display data if I return an IEnumerable&lt;Row&gt;
    public IEnumerable&lt;IGrouping&lt;string, Row&gt;&gt; Rows
    {
        get
        {
            if (this.ReportFormat == ReportFormat.A)
            {
                return this._Rows.GroupBy(r =&gt; r.Name);
            }
            //else group by different field
            return this._Rows.GroupBy(r =&gt; r.LastName);
        }
    }

    public void AddRow(Row row)
    {
        this._Rows.Add(row);
        this._totalAge += row.Age;
    }
}

<p>I'm pretty new with RDLC, so any guidance or good article on how to do something similar would be much appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> My table in the report is displaying 2 empty rows, so the group by in the code works good but the rows don't display anything. So I suspect I'm missing some concept on how to render grouped rows. I'll keep investigating.</p>

<p>Now, when I am trying factor 18 digit numbers I am receiving memory error while creating the list. However, Windows task manager shows only 1.48 GB RAM used, while I have around 2.2 GB usable RAM. 
 What is the reason behind this? </p>

<p>I have added a screenshot of the task manager when the memory error occurred.(cannot post images yet here so here is the link - <a href=""http://postimg.org/image/ek69ebkgv/"" rel=""nofollow"">Image</a>) </p>

<p>Also, I know that there are other methods for factoring primes faster, but I would just like to know why this memory error is happening before the RAM is totally utilised.</p>

To do this I made this function:</p>

<pre><code>private void AddAllControl()

    GroupBox TestGroupBox = new GroupBox();
    TestGroupBox.AutoSize = true;
    TestGroupBox.Text = ""valami"";
    TestGroupBox.Height = 500;

<p>This function is processed when a button been pressed. After that The groupbox appear correctly, but only 1 label the first (with text = 0) appear instead of 21 label.
When I stop to debug the program I see all the labels are exists and all the property are correct, however they do not appear.
There must be something that I didn't noticed.
And now my question? What did I wrong?

 1. Get the XML to have a last modification date with time, and check that is the same. Problem is that someone may forget to change it and then it is useless.
 2. Create a hashcode of the xml file/structure. </p>

<p>I use a build in library in java, but the hash implementation can change from run to run which is not helpful </p>

<pre><code>File model = new File(fileLocation);
DocumentBuilderFactory dbFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
DocumentBuilder dBuilder = dbFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
Document doc = dBuilder.parse(model);
doc.getHash();
</code></pre>

<p>is there an easy way to do this, and hopefully without importing another library.</p>

<p>Sometimes an message comes up with an question if i would like to debug an running process (probably from iis but that is not mentiont)</p>

<p>As long as i don't not press yes or no the sites keep running but on the second i press no the site restarts. I tested this by check all response times form the sites which are running on the server.</p>

<p>I have the following Development Software installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual studio 2013 ultimate with blend for visual studio</li>
<li>SQL Server Management studio 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried the following things (found on similar questions):</p>

<ul>
<li>Disabeling JIT debugger in visual studio</li>
<li>Try to remove the registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger.</li>
<li>try to set the registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script\Settings\JITDebug</li>
<li>disabled script debugging in internet options</li>
</ul>

<p>And i stumbled upon the following problems trying the above things:
Both the registries named did not exist on the server.
I also disabled the JIT debugger in VS 2013 but there is still an instance of the JIT debugger of VS2010, which is strange since its not installed.</p>

<p>Disabling JIT debugger in VS2013 did help some, at first i could choose between an 2013 or a 2010 instance. But now i would like to remove the JIT debugger of the VS2010 instance to.</p>

<p>What can i try more, or what did i do wrong with the things i tried so far?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xf4J4.png"" alt=""screenshot installed software"">
Could it be the visual studio 2010 shell (Islotated), if i try to open it it gives an error on a licence. If it is this program is it save to remove it?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE3:</strong></p>

<p>Since this question is marked as duplicate i would lie to explain why it is not. The answer given in the question which is said to be the same do not apply for my problem. As said in my question i tried all those things but none of them worked. or the given registries did not exist. I really would liken answer on my problem, and if there is anything i can do to help or to make my question better please say so</p>

<p>been stuck for a while now. What im trying to do comes down to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have developed a little library which i am deploying in form of a jar-file. it contains a file i need to access, which is located in ""json2/json.js"" (yep, doin jscript/rhino things)</li>
<li>I import the jar-file into a classical java-project, it works fine. File is found and read</li>
<li>I import the SAME jar-file into tomcat-project which looks as follows:
<i></li>
<li>a .jsp that calls a java-class</li>
<li>inside the java-class i call my library, which is located in the tomcat/lib-directory</li>
<li>now when i try to access the file i cant (null-pointer)
</i></li>
</ul>

<p>sources:</p>

<pre><code>        InputStream in = ClassLoader.getSystemResourceAsStream(""json2/json.js"");
</code></pre>

<p>when i run it inside the tomcat, (in==null).</p>

<p>for diagnosis i improvised the following:</p>

<pre><code>        File fu = new File(new URI(this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource("""").toString()));
        String[] l = fu.list();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(i+""||""+l[i]);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>with the classic java-class it only produces my main-class-file. in tomcat it shows me the content of the ""tomcat/lib""-directory.</p>

<p>any ideas? would be greatly appreciated...</p>

<p>one detail that i forgot to add (and that really grinds my gears):</p>

    this.getTimerCountDown();

<pre><code>$db = new PDO(""java:comp/env/jdbc/mysql"");

<p>To see if it worked I commented out the above and then wrote:</p>

$db_list = mysql_list_dbs($link);

while($row = mysql_fetch_object($db_list)) {

<p>And I saw that my new database was there:</p>

<pre><code>information_schema
mysql
kitty_db
performance_schema
test
</code></pre>

<p>And so my first question is, did I even need to make a new database next to mysql just to get started on something?  I don't recall ever having to do that a couple of years ago (7 actually) when I was setting up MySQL before (sans via PHP).</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm wondering why I can't create a table now.  If kitty_db isn't a good idea, let's take it out.  But I may be having trouble putting a TABLE 'milk_bowl' (with an index or key or whatever 'bowl_name' field).</p>

<p>Project ""X"" is an MFC app also developed in VS2013, and its <code>Platform Toolset</code> value is set to <code>VS2013</code>. It happens to be a Win32 application.</p>

<p>I now have to include the library in a different project ""Y"" (which was a VS2010 project, but I (believe I) converted it using VS to 2013).</p>

<p>Project ""Y"" is NOT an MFC app, instead a .dll, and its <code>Platform Toolset</code> value is also set to <code>VS2013</code>. It is an x64 application.</p>

<p>However, when I try to build ""Y"", I get tons of compiler errors, mostly because the library uses C++11 features, and apparently VS isn't allowing it. The errors are mostly vector bracket-initialization syntax problems. E.G. <code>non-aggregates cannot be initialized with initializer list</code>. But in addition, it also can't find symbols for <code>strtoll</code> and <code>report_rangecheckfailure</code>.</p>

<p>But I don't understand. To my knowledge, VS2013 should support these features, and it appears to in my other projects. What could be the issue here? Is there something else I need to do to use the 2013 compiler?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Just to be extra clear, it's assignments like this that give the aggregate compiler message:</p>

<p>That's not a very well-thought-out interface, but the idea is that you can use a value for <code>bind</code> and the driver handles the details of escaping (if the underlying API doesn't handle bound variables natively) without the caller having to reimplement it [badly].</p>

In order to read them, I submit a form with the user's ID, get the path to their resume from the database and display it to the admin in a new tab as a PDF.  Below is the code for displaying the PDF.  </p>

<pre><code>$file = ""file_name.pdf"";
$path = ""C:/path/to/file/"" . $file;
header('Content-type: application/pdf');
header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename=""' . $file . '""');
header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary');
header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($path));
header('Accept-Ranges: bytes');
readfile($path);
</code></pre>

<p>In order to submit the form to get to this code, I do the following in javascript.</p>

<pre><code>$(""#resume-user-id"").val(ui.target.attr(""id""));
$(""#resume-form"").submit();
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the form code.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""resume-form"" method=""post"" action=""/account/profile/preview_resume.php"" target=""_blank""&gt;
    &lt;input id=""resume-user-id"" type=""hidden"" name=""user_id""&gt;&lt;/input&gt; 
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this all works just just fine and dandy and the PDF is displayed correctly because I have hard coded in the file name and path.  However, as soon as I access a post variable at all, the PDF doesn't load.  Even if I keep the file name hard coded and just check if the post variables are set by using the isset function, everything just breaks.  The page looks like it is trying to load a PDF, but it just keeps loading, and loading, and loading...</p>

<p>Any ideas what might be causing this?</p>

<p><strong>--UPDATE--</strong></p>

<p>I removed the <code>header('Accept-Ranges: bytes');</code> line, and now it works fine (mostly).  What exactly does this header do, and why would it be causing issues in this situation?  I say 'mostly' fine because all but one of my test PDF's work.  One of them however, I just get a message that says ""Cannot load PDF""... Not sure why this is, or how it is different from the others.</p>

<p>Currently, I add the new node data to force.nodes(), and the appropriate links to force.links() (as references to the actual vertexes, not numerical indices). My approach is then to render the nodes on the HTML canvas, and animate their expansion (without binding the data from the layout, yet). I then bind the data from the layout to the HTML elements representing the nodes. (The data shows up in their <code>__data__</code> element). </p>

<p>When I call force.start() to have the force layout start taking into account the new nodes in calculating the positions of all vertices in the graph, however, the HTML elements which I bound the force node data to do not update. When I check their <code>__data__</code> properties, the data has the appropriate x and y values for nodes in a force layout, but the HTML elements <code>""cx""</code> and <code>""cy""</code> attributes are not being updated.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

RewriteRule ^portfolio\/?(.*)$ ""http\:\/\/i\.colorspace\.am\/portfolio$1"" [R=301,L]

<p>I want to move all the content from my root directory into a subdomain (which I've done) but I don't want the links people have to not work. www.colorspace.am/portfolio needs to redirect to i.colorspace.am/portfolio, and all the sets contained therein (ie /portfolio/YYYYMMDD) also need to be 'adjusted' on the fly (www.colorspace.am/portfolio/YYYYMMDD -> i.colorspace.am/porfolio/YYYYMMDD</p>

<p>NOTE: i.colorspace.am contain's 2011's content; ii.colorspace.am will contain 2012. They're two entirely different WP installs with their own respective databases. Not sure if it's relevant but..</p>

<p>What seems to be happening is that /portfolio is instructed to redirect to i.colorspace.am/portfolio, but for whatever reason it's ending up at i.colorspace.am</p>

<p>IF there's a way I can make any www.colorspace.am/folder/sub-folder redirect to i.colorspace.am/folder/sub-folder (wildcard?) ..that would be amazing. But I'd be just as happy with a single fully working redirect at this point. </p>

<p>NOTE: the redirect code was generated by my administration panel. I tried </p>

<pre><code>Redirect /portfolio http://i.colorspace.am/portfolio

<pre><code>if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Enter)
      {
        e.Handled = false;
        return;
      }
</code></pre>

<p>But I know there are probably a few more keys I don't care about that do something important in the system handler, so I don't want to handle them.</p>

Since the system is quite complex I'm having trouble tracing all the code paths that value goes through - there are multiple threads involved, it can be saved and then loaded from a DB and so on. I'm going to try to use a code graph generator to see if I can spot the problem by looking at the ways the setter can be called, by may be there's some other technique. Perhaps wrapping the value with a class that traces the places and changes it goes through? I'm not sure the question is clear enough, but I'd appreciate input from somebody who encountered such a situation.</p>

<p>[Edit] The problem is not easily reproducible and I can't catch it in a debugger. I'm looking for a static analysis or logging technique to help track down the issue.</p>

<p>[Edit 2] Just to make things clearer, the value I'm talking about is a timestamp represented as the number of milliseconds from the Unix epoch (01/01/1970) in a 64-bit long variable. At some unknown point the top 32 bits of the value are truncated generating completely incorrect (and unrecoverable) timestamps.</p>

<p>[Edit 3] OK, thanks to some of your suggestions and to a couple of hours of pouring through the code, I found the culprit. The millisecond-based timestamp was converted into a second-based timestamp by dividing it by 1000 and stored in an <code>int</code> variable. At a later point in code, the second-based timestamp (an <code>int</code>) was multiplied by 1000 and stored into a new <code>long</code> variable. Since both 1000 and the second-based timestamps were <code>int</code> values, the result of the multiplication was truncated before being converted to long. This was a subtle one, thanks to everyone who helped.</p>

<p>e.g. The user gives read access to a folder:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE Folders SET ReadAccess = 1
WHERE FolderID = 7
</code></pre>

<p>As far as the user is concerned i want that to be the end of the atomic operation. In reality i have to now go find all child files and folders and give them <code>ReadAccess</code>. </p>

<pre><code>EXECUTE SynchronizePermissions
</code></pre>

<p>This is a potentially lengthy operation (over 2s). i want this lengthy operation to happen ""<em>later</em>"". It can happen 0 seconds later, and before the carbon-unit has a chance to think about it the asynchronous update is done.</p>

<p>How can i run this required operation <em>asychronously</em> when it's required (i.e. <em>triggered</em>)?</p>

<p>The <em>ideal</em> would be:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.Folders FOR INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE AS
   EXECUTEASYNCHRONOUS SynchronizePermissions
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.Folders FOR INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE AS
   EXECUTE SynchronizePermissions WITH(ASYNCHRONOUS)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Right now this happens as a trigger:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.Folders FOR INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE AS
   EXECUTE SynchronizePermissions
</code></pre>

<p>and the user is forced to wait the 3 seconds every time they make a change to the <code>Folders</code> table.</p>

<p>i've thought about creating a <strong>Scheduled Task</strong> on the user, that runs every minute, and check for an <code>PermissionsNeedSynchronizing</code> flag:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.Folders FOR INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE AS
   UPDATE SystemState SET PermissionsNeedsSynchronizing = 1
</code></pre>

<p>The scheduled task binary can check for this flag, run if the flag is on:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @FlagValue int
SET @FlagValue = 0;

UPDATE SystemState SET @FlagValue = PermissionsNeedsSynchronizing+1
WHERE PermissionsNeedsSynchronizing = 1

IF @FlagValue = 2
BEGIN
   EXECUTE SynchronizePermissions

   UPDATE SystemState SET PermissionsNeedsSynchronizing = 0
   WHERE PermissionsNeedsSynchronizing = 2
END
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with a scheduled task is:
 - the fastest it can run is every 60 seconds
 - it's suffers from being a <em>polling</em> solution
 - it requires an executable </p>

<p>What i'd prefer is a way that SQL Server could trigger the scheduled task:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.Folders FOR INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE AS
   EXECUTE SynchronizePermissionsAsychronous


CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SynchronizePermissionsAsychronous AS

   EXECUTE sp_ms_StartWindowsScheduledTask @taskName=""SynchronousPermissions""
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is:
- there is no <code>sp_ms_StartWinodowsScheduledTask</code> system stored procedure</p>

<p>So i'm looking for ideas for better solutions.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The previous example is a problem, that has has no good solution, for five years now. A problem from 3 years ago, that has no good solution is a table that i need to update a meta-data column after an insert/update. The metadata takes too long to calculate in online transaction processing, but i am ok with it appearing 3 or 5 seconds later:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.UpdateFundsTransferValues FOR INSERT, UPDATE AS

UPDATE FundsTransfers
SET TotalOrderValue = (SELECT ....[snip]....),
    TotalDropValue = (SELECT ....,[snip]....)
WHERE FundsTransfers.FundsTransferID IN (
    SELECT i.FundsTransferID
    FROM INSERTED i
)
</code></pre>

<p>And the problem that i'm having today is a way to asychronously update some metadata after a row has been transitionally inserted or modified:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.UpdateCDRValue FOR INSERT, UPDATE AS

UPDATE LCDs
SET CDRValue = (SELECT ....[snip]....)
WHERE LCDs.LCDGUID IN (
    SELECT i.LCDGUID
    FROM INSERTED i
)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: i've thought about creating a native, or managed, dll and using it as an extended stored procedure. The problem with that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can't script a binary</li>
<li>i'm now allowed to do it </li>
</ul>

<p>What it does? give you (what I think) a apache2 simple binary that can be run with your user. A ~6M setup with apache binaries, log directorie, you own conf files and modules.</p>

<pre><code>$ tree -d -L 2

|-- apache2
|   |-- bin
|   |-- conf
|   |-- lib
|   |-- logs
|   `-- modules

</code></pre>

<p>This is very convenient! having your own apache2 instance, you can add your modules do your settings, almost everything at user leve.</p>

<p>What I am asking, <strong>¿How can I get this same setup?</strong>. I am compiling apache2 and php with the next configure settings.</p>

<pre><code>./configure \
    --prefix=$HOME/webapp/apache2 \
    --enable-module=so \
    --enable-rewrite

./configure \
    --prefix=$HOME/webapp/apache2/php5 \
    --with-apxs2=$HOME/webapp/apache2/bin/apxs \
    --with-config-file-path=$HOME/webapp/apache2/php5/etc \
    --enable-zip \
    --with-pgsql \
    --with-mysql
</code></pre>

<p>What I am missing is the setup size, webfaction has a 6MB for apache2 installation, and I get more than 22MB. Also would like to have the binary results from webfaction.</p>

<pre><code>$ tree apache2

The goal is that the users get <em>all settings</em> displayed and can change <em>all settings within one view</em> and save <em>all settings using one single button</em>. The setting should be updated using Ajax.</p>

<p><strong>My current approach:</strong></p>

<p><em>View:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;script language=""javascript""&gt;
    $(function() {
        $('#editSettings').submit(function () {
            if ($(this).valid()) {
                $.ajax({

                    type: this.method,
                    data: $(this).serialize(),
                    success: function (result)
                    {
                        alert(result);

            }
            return false;
        });
    });
&lt;/script&gt;

[ ... ]

@using (Ajax.BeginForm(""Edit"", ""Settings"", new AjaxOptions {UpdateTargetId = ""result""}, new { @class = ""form-horizontal"", @id = ""editSettings"" } ))
{
    foreach (Setting item in ViewBag.Settings) 
    {

    }
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""modify"" /&gt;

<p><em>Partial View to load the setting:</em></p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=""control-group""&gt;

            &lt;div class=""controls""&gt;
                @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.Value)
                &lt;span class=""help-inline""&gt;@settingDescription&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

<p><em>Model:</em></p>

<pre><code>[Table(""Settings"")]
public class Setting
{
    [Key]
    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]

    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Required(AllowEmptyStrings = true)]
    [DisplayFormat(ConvertEmptyStringToNull = false)]
    public string Value { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am setting the ViewBag using <code>ViewBag.Settings = _db.Settings.ToList();</code></p>

<p>The jQuery parses the Data to the following method:</p>

<pre><code>    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult Edit(IList&lt;Setting&gt; setting)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(setting.Count);
        return Content(""""); // Currently for testing purposes only. Breakpoint is set to setting.Count
    }
</code></pre>

<p><code>Count</code> throws an error because setting is <code>null</code>. I am quite unsure how to fix this problem. </p>

<p>Can someone can give me a hint?</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7419742/how-to-updating-ienumerablemyobject-in-mvc"">This</a> topic on SO already covers updating a Collection without Ajax. But I won't get the point.</p>
