"18978698","1","","","2013-09-24 10:10:44","","3","1201","<p>I am attempting to fire a jQuery function when the window scrolls using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>$(window).scroll(function(){
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I set a body height of 100% (needed for formatting on the site), the scroll function does not fire. The body height is set to 100% so that the background image fills the entire browser window. </p>

<p>Is there any way that I can have the scroll function fired when scrolling, or an alternate function or alternate code to have a background image stretch the entire page?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p><strong>Edit (My solution):</strong></p>

<p>This was a bit of a weird question, as it had strict conditions - ie) the body heights, and other coding I've put in whilst playing around.</p>

<p>However I found that I had</p>

<pre><code>overflow:auto;
</code></pre>

<p>set on a parent div just inside the body.</p>

<p>The solution was to remove the overflow and add a</p>

<pre><code>position:relative;
</code></pre>

<p>to the div surrounding all the content.</p>

<p>This probably won't apply to anyone else, however I thought I'd post the solution just incase!</p>

<hr>

<p>Elaboration of the problem:</p>

<p>Say that there is a static/global variable <code>x</code> in <code>a.cpp</code>. Both the exe <code>foo.exe</code> and the dll <code>bar.dll</code> have <code>a.cpp</code>, so the variable <code>x</code> is in both images.</p>

<p>Now, <code>foo.exe</code> dynamically loads (or statically) <code>bar.dll</code>. Then, the problem is whether the variable <code>x</code> is shared by the exe and dll, or not.</p>

<p>In Windows, these two guys <em>never</em> share the <code>x</code>: the exe and dll will have a separate copy of <code>x</code>. However, in Linux, the exe and dll do share the variable <code>x</code>. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I want the behavior of Linux. I first considered using <code>pragma data_seg</code> on Windows. However, even if I correctly setup the shared data segment, <code>foo.exe</code> and <code>bar.dll</code> never shares the <code>x</code>. Recall that <code>bar.dll</code> is loaded into the address space of <code>foo.exe</code>. However, if I run another instance of <code>foo.exe</code>, then <code>x</code> is shared. But, I don't want <code>x</code> to be shared by different processes. So, using <code>data_seg</code> was failed.</p>

<p>I may it use a memory-mapped file by making an unique name between exe and dll, which I'm trying now.</p>

<hr>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why the behavior of Linux and Windows is different? Can anyone explain more about this?</li>
<li>What would be most easiest way to solve this problem on Windows?</li>

<h2><strong>Qestion is: How extend expiration of value 'id' with keeping consistency of value? Keep in mind that everytime some client can come to increment the value.</strong></h2>

<p>Some ideas how solve this problem:</p>

<h2>Try to be fast</h2>

<pre><code>memcache_set( 'id' , memcache_get( 'id'  ) , 0 , 60 );
</code></pre>

<p>But here is time hole between get and set and other client at time can change the value.(?)</p>

<h2>Use semaphore e.g.:</h2>

<p>not much effective...</p>

<pre><code>memcache_set ( 'lock' , 1 , 0 , 60 );
memcache_set( 'id' , memcache_get( 'id'  ) , 0 , 60 );
memcache_delete( 'lock' ); 
//client will not increment if the lock is present and wait for lock will get out
</code></pre>

<h2>use memcache_delete:</h2>

<pre><code>memcache::delete  ( 'id' , 60 );
</code></pre>

<p>documentation is lack of what happened if you call it twice. Should it extend Expiration of first call or not?</p>

<p>Last surprising example (try it your self):</p>

<pre><code>$memcache_obj = new Memcache;
$memcache_obj-&gt;connect('127.0.0.1', 11211);

I'm working on a rails project where we tend to re-design things quite frequently, which leads to a tonne of deadweight css. What's the best way to find and remove it?</p>

<p>Now, I do know that there is a rails plugin called deadweight built specifically for that purpose. However, here's my problem with deadweight: first of all, it completely ignores selectors used in javascript. Next, it scans only those pages that you configure it to scan which means there's a risk of removing something that is used on pages that you didn't scan for some reason. Finally, it finds unused selectors only in compiled css (we use LESS) - matching these against the actual code is a bit too involved.</p>

<p>I have also tried <a href=""http://unused-css.com/"">http://unused-css.com/</a> - they're great, but can't access localhost and, again, can only scan compiled CSS.</p>

<p>I really think there must be a better way of doing this. Actually, some time ago I decided to optimise one particular css file by grepping each selector in the entire project directory (emacs + rinari mode make it super-easy and super-fast), and each time I didn't see any html or css in the results I removed the style. Zero problems, worked like a charm. Obviously, I'm not going to do that for the entire site. However, I really don't believe that this couldn't be automated. Now, before I fire up my python and code this up, can anyone actually tell me if I'd be reinventing the wheel?</p>

<p>I assume there is also a number of common web app libraries/frameworks in Python. Is there an equivalent there ?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>=== ADDENDUM ===</strong></p>

<p>On the good advice of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/49993/kevin-davis"">Kevin Davis</a>, I just want to quickly elaborate on what Java Servlet Filters are. It is basically an HTTP request interceptor. A chain of filters can be configured between the raw receipt of the request and the final destination of the request. The request parameters (and cookies, headers etc. etc.) are passed to the first filter in the chain and each filter does something with them (or not) and then passes them up the chain (or not. eg. a caching filter may simply return the result, bypassing the rest of the chain and the endpoint).</p>

<p>One of the advantages is the ability to modify or enhance the web app without touching the original endpoint code.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

            View v = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_location_info, container,
                    false);

            mMapView = (MapView) v.findViewById(R.id.mapView);
            mMapView.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

            mMapView.onResume();// needed to get the map to display immediately

            try {
                MapsInitializer.initialize(getActivity().getApplicationContext());
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

            MapsInitializer.initialize(getApplicationContext());

            googleMap = mMapView.getMap();
            // latitude and longitude
            double latitude = 17.385044;
            double longitude = 78.486671;


            // create marker
            MarkerOptions marker = new MarkerOptions().position(new LatLng(latitude, longitude)).title(""Hello Maps"");

            // Changing marker icon
            marker.icon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.defaultMarker(BitmapDescriptorFactory.HUE_ROSE));

            // adding marker
            googleMap.addMarker(marker);

            CameraPosition cameraPosition = new CameraPosition.Builder().target(new LatLng(17.385044, 78.486671)).zoom(12).build();

            googleMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newCameraPosition(cameraPosition));

            // Perform any camera updates here
            return v;

<p>There must be a way for notifyfs to determine the filesystem, as reported in /proc/self/mountinfo, is a system related filesystem, or a ""real"" filesystem. For example cpuset, cgroup, devtmpfs and sysfs are what I call system filesystems, and ext2, ext3 and tmpfs, vfat and nfs, cifs are ""real"" filesystems.</p>

<p>A difference between system and real filesystems are that real filesystems are watchable via inotify, system ones are not. Place a inotify watch on a ""file"" in /proc, and you'll see that is does not work.</p>

<p>When looking at /proc/filesystems the only extra info is ""nodev"", which says that the mountsource is a blockdevice or not. When it's a blockdevice, then it's not a system filesystem. But when it's not a blockdevice (and nodev is specified) it's not always a system filesystem, for example the network filesystems cifs and nfs, or tmpfs and ramfs.</p>

<p>Is there a way to determine that a ""nodev"" filesystem behaves like a real filesystem, eg is watchable via inotify?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name='input' method='post' action=''&gt;
&lt;textarea cols=75 rows=17 name='desc'&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's how I insert the text (stored in the $desc variable) into the file:</p>

<pre><code>$file-&gt;fileTruncate($parent2.""/projectfiles/"".$data[ID].""/description.html"", $desc);
</code></pre>

<p>Some of my fileHandle class, accessed by the $file object:</p>

<pre><code>function fileTruncate($path, $write){

    if(file_exists($path)){

        $this-&gt;fp = fopen($path, 'w');

        fwrite($this-&gt;fp, $write);

        fclose($this-&gt;fp);

        return true;

    }else{

        return false;

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's how I display the text, stored in the $desc_contents variable ($file->fileContents basically gets the contents of the given file, ""all"" means it gets the entire file):</p>

<pre><code>    $file = new fileHandle;

echo ""&lt;div id='project_description' style='overflow:scroll;'&gt;"";

echo ""&lt;div id='project_description_text'&gt;"";

echo ""&lt;br/&gt;"".$desc_contents = $file-&gt;fileContents(""projectfiles/$projectid/description.html"", ""all"");

echo ""&lt;/div&gt;"";

echo ""&lt;/div&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an example of the text which has been cut off:</p>

<p><h1> XaocRPG </h1></p>

</ul>

<p><em>Some other text</em></p>

<p><em>More invisible text</em></p>

<p>The italic text should be visible and in the file, but isn't. I checked whether or not it is actually truncated to the file, but it isn't, therefore there's no error with the actual displaying of the text.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated</p>

The app needs a reliable authentication method that must guarantee that only authorised users access the system.</p>

<p>In the registration, the users generate a key pair and send their username and public key to the central server of the system. A system admin, which has access to this central server, approves the registration and asks a certificate authority to issue a public key certificate that binds the username to the public key. A x509 certificate is generated and stored at a certificate server.</p>

<p>When the user wants to authenticate, he enters his username and the app creates a digital signature for him, with his private key. This signature is sent to central server, which requests the x509 certificate for the matching private key. If a x509 is found at the certificate server, it sends the certificate for the central server and the user is authenticated.</p>

Recently, we've started looking at multithreading to speed up the calculations. Some of the algorithms can be made to run parallel without much effort, and I use a fixed thread pool to run each of the sub tasks.</p>

<p>What I was wondering is: how is the number of threads (the size of the pool), typically specified for these kinds of algorithms? I suspect this is typically done by using either a configuration file, or a commandline parameter, but I haven't seen any examples like that, so I was wondering if there are better ways.</p>

<p>Related to this: Is it even relevant to specify the number of threads? I was thinking that setting the pool size to the number of assignable cores will likely run the fastest, but is the thread-contention for processing power in the case of over assignment even relevant for performance? Eg: will setting 20 max threads on a 4 core machine be worse than setting 4 max threads?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> the application is intended for sale, so I have no idea what computers it will be run on. I'm looking for general guidelines, and best practices.</p>

<p>This works exactly as I intend if the Chrome window is say, half the vertical height of my screen - so I initially assumed it was working perfectly.</p>

<p>I then realised however that is does <em>not</em> work if there is 'not much' to scroll down to - when <code>scroll_top == nav_offset_top</code> the whole thing 'jumps' back up.</p>

<p>This is the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13905700/sticky-nav-wont-scroll-on-short-pages?rq=1"">same issue as posted here</a> - but that went unsolved, and the OP 'resolved' it by not using a fixed navigation...</p>

<p>Probably <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17470892/not-able-to-scroll-to-the-bottom-of-the-page-when-sticky-headers-position-chang?rq=1"">also the same issue as asked about here</a>, but that too was abandoned without answer.</p>

<p>I ran <code>sh Configure</code> without the <code>-des</code> switch, trying my best to give reasonable answers, but got the same result. </p>

<p>A search for truncl128 and/or copysignl128 yields almost no hits. Seemingly an astrophysicist <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2010-08/msg00051.html"" rel=""nofollow"">patched gcc 4.5 because of that</a>. I did try to compile gcc 4.5 on my own but there is too much stuff I would need to install for that (e.g. binutils, which I had to compile first, too). RPM binaries of a more up-to-date gcc lead me into dependency hell. So I'm stuck to IBM's toolset. </p>

<p>Coudn't find a hint in Perl's README for other config/compiler options on this issue. Did I overlook something?</p>

<p>The ""128"" seems to point to the precision of integers/numbers in some math libraries. I don't need that. If there is some ""forget super high precision"" switch, it would be just fine.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a clue about getting around the compiler error? If possible with AIX's standard tools?</p>

<p>I believe the reason is, the external dependencies don't exist on the client's machine.</p>

<p>I don't have much experience with C++.</p>

<p>Lead up to question:<br/>
When you compile (and I'm just compiling in debug at the moment), there is a whole bunch of header files in the external dependencies and a dll (mscorlib.dll).</p>

<p>The mscorlib.dll exists in the same place on the client machine, so I'm kind of discounting that as the problem, but the headers do not exist.</p>

<p>Question:<br/>
Do I need to ship these headers off with the dll I've created or should they be compiled into my dll?</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of some of the external dependencies. Most of them seem to be in the project by default when the project was created.<br/>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>After changing the project to release it seems to be running on another machine as well as my dev machine, have to wait untill tomorrow to test on the client's.</p>

<p>Although it has worked so far, I checked out DependencyWalker and got the following when looking at my dll, is this anything to be worried about?</p>

<p>I am new to <code>Tkinter</code>. I wanted to make a button that pretty much lets the user choose two buttons and then I will perform a function with that button. </p>

<p>I simplified it to this.</p>

<pre><code>import Tkinter as tk

        self.button1.grid(column=1,row=9,columnspan=2)
        self.button2 = tk.Button(self, command=self.OnButtonClick2, text=""Apples"",width=15)
        self.button2.grid(column=3,row=9,columnspan=2)

app = simpleapp_tk()
app.title('my application')
app.mainloop()
</code></pre>

<p>So there would be some other <code>randomFunction</code> in <code>simpleapp_tk</code> that does something given an input, but that's unimportant. </p>

<p>Does something like this exist that waits for the user to click a button and then stores what is returned by clicking that button into a variable? Ideally I would then be able to do this for multiple variables. </p>

<p>However, I want to use it to do something a bit more complex: attempt to predict stock prices. I know that neural networks aren't necessarily the best choice and may not be accurate at all, but I would still like to try.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to get 10 days of past closing prices for a specified stock (GOOG, for example). I then hoped to train the neural network with this data and then predict the next day's closing price, but then I realized something: I only had 1 input value, and would not have any input to provide when trying to get the prediction. This is the root of all my confusion, the number of input/hidden/output nodes.</p>

<p>In a paper <a href=""http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~hashemi/papers/CISIM2010_HBHashemi.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, they mention using the lowest, the highest, and the average value of a stock in  the last <code>d</code> days as input. This is 3 inputs (or 4? if you count <code>d</code>), yet in order to <strong>predict</strong> the next day's price you wouldn't be able to provide any of this as input (except maybe <code>d</code>?).</p>

<p>How do you account for this variation in the number of inputs when training and predicting with a neural network? Am I missing some fundamental part of NN's and how they're used? Thanks!</p>

We have migrated all of our 'data' over to Neo4j, which has gone really well and everything works, but we are not sure at this point the best way of managing the authentication system.</p>

<p>So the question is, what is the standard way to store/retrieve credentials and other sensitive information and perform authentication using a graph database.
Is it ideal to store the credentials data in the graph, or should we still use MSSQL and the Membership provider we already have?</p>

<p>I have the following classes:</p>

<pre><code>public class Category
{
    public Category()
    {
        Products = new List&lt;Product&gt;();
    }
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Product&gt; Products { get; set; }
    public override string ToString()
    {
        return String.Format(""{0}{1}"", Id, Name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public Category Category { get; set; }
    public override string ToString()
    {
        return String.Format(""{0}{1}"", Id, Name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've got some code which attempts to update both a product and it's category:</p>

<pre><code>        using (var ctx = GetCtx())
        {
            var beverages = new Category {Id = 1 };

            var milk = new Product { Name = ""MILK"", Id = 4, Category = new Category { Id = 1} };       
            ctx.Entry(milk).State = System.Data.EntityState.Modified;
            ctx.SaveChanges();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>this results in the following sql statement:</p>

<pre><code>update [dbo].[Products]
set [Name] = @0, [Price] = @1
where ([Id] = @2)

@0: MILK
@1: 0
@2: 4
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out how to make sure that the Category for the particular product is updated. I thought about adding a property to Product for Category_Id but this results in an additional column being generated in my database.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I think I figured this out-- after watching Julia Lerman's series on EF (Pluralsight)-- the way to set up this class is like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [Required]
    [MaxLength(200)]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual Category Category { get; set; }
    public int CategoryId { get; set; }

}
</code></pre>

<p>This results in only one foreign key column in the Products table. The Category of the Product gets updated when updating the CategoryId property.</p>

<p>Here is what I'm doing.. i have a single table 3 column table</p>

<p>Column 1 contains a static text actually says ""Select Account""<br>
Column 2 contains a header title<br>
Column 3 contains the select account name<br></p>

<p>Column 1 has a static width of 220px<br>
Column 2 needs the header to be centered in middle of screen<br>
Column 3 needs to grow depending on size of text</p>

<p>Table is 100% across screen.</p>

<p>Can't seem to figure out how to get it to work.. Column 1 works fine.. column 3 i have centered right, took out width, but middle column wont center correctly...</p>

<p>Any ideas? Maybe a way to do this using a div? Reason I used table is because if browser is small, don't want columns to fall under each other like they do with divs</p>

<p>Sample Code:</p>

<pre>
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;width: 220px;&quot;&gt;
       &lt;span&gt;Please Select Your Account&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

I had a design where <code>NSOperation</code> subclasses create and manage their own <code>NSURLConnection</code>. The <code>NSOperation</code> subclass is instantiated by a <code>NetworkManger</code> class which adds it to the <code>NSOperationQueue</code>. Once the request is finished the delegate(ex:<code>ViewController</code> will be called). This is the flow:</p>

<p>The Network Manger instantiates <code>NSOperation</code> subclass (which encapsulates URL, parameters etc) and adds it to a <code>NSOperationQueue</code> it maintains.
NSOperation subclass instantiates <code>NSURLConnection</code> (which performs <code>asynchronous</code> request and retrieves data)
<code>NSURLConnection</code> dumps data to NSOperation-subclass
NSOperation-subclass executes the completion block supplied by the delegate( view controller).
I'm trying to implement the same pattern with <code>NSURLSession</code> now. I want to be able to encapsulate the url and parameters required to make a network request inside a single object.</p>

<p>Is it fine if i use the same pattern if I use <code>NSURLSession</code>. I checked <code>AFNetworking</code> classes. But, they have not subclassed NSOperation for <code>NSURLSession</code>. And, moreover where should the session object go. Will it be a part of the NSOperation class.</p>

<p>Can someone give some expert advice on this. I should be able to cancel requests, do uploading(POST/PUT), downloading of data. The Network Manager class would be the single point of contact for any network request.</p>

For reasons mentioned in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20919502/updating-a-jar-library-does-not-reflect-in-tomcat"">my other question</a>, I sometimes need to delete the Tomcat from the Servers list and re-add it.

<p>The weird thing is: after I re-add the server, two configuration files <code>server.xml</code> and <code>context.xml</code> revert to a previous state! let's call it <strong>S</strong>. I cannot really tell what <strong>S</strong> is - it definitely is a state I once had, but it lacks some newer changes. For this reason my webapp does not work and I have to revert these two files in the <code>workspace/Servers</code> folder.</p>

<p>I'd love to fix this by updating <strong>S</strong>. However, I am unable to find the source of <strong>S</strong>, where Eclipse takes it from - I tried fulltext-searching my computer for files that look like the <code>server.xml</code> and <code>context.xml</code>, but to no avail. Specifically, I updated these two files in the <code>conf/</code> folder of my Tomcat installation, but it did not help.</p>

<p>Where could Eclipse be keeping <strong>S</strong>? In some weird DB in the workspace metadata? Could it be using the local history?...</p>

<p>It works ok when testing on my desktop but in testing on my Android phone, the dropdown menu will appear but no amount of clicking will make it go away even though the links do work.  So is there a way to get a dropdown menu to disappear on a smartphone similar to a desktop?  I am not coding in Android, I am merely displaying the webpage on a smartphone.</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 32; i &gt; 0; i--)

   a = a &gt;&gt; 1;
   b = b &lt;&lt; 1;

<p>In the code &amp; is used to ""mask"" a bit and the result would have been completely different if <code>&amp;&amp;</code> had been used instead. In that case the expression <code>1</code> had been interpreted as a truth value (<code>TRUE</code>) instead of a one-bit position that is used to keep one of the bits. Correct? But what would instead happen if I did like this:</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 32; i &gt; 0; i--)
 {
   if(a|1 != 0) //bit mask
     total += b;
   a = a &gt;&gt; 1;
   b = b &lt;&lt; 1; 
 }
</code></pre>

<p>In the first case the <code>1</code> is used to keep only the LSB (least significant bit) i.e. rightmost bit and nothing else. What would <code>|</code>do in its place? What would be the difference if I did this change?</p>

Mostly people suggest that the javascript V8 engine is much faster than php in terms of running speed of a single file calculation. </p>

<p>I worked on some javascript code for Node.js, now I have this idea I don't know if it is correct. </p>

<p>In my opinion, Node.js runs a javascript application and listen on a port. so this javascript application is an application that is running on server computer. Therefore, the application code is all copied in the memory of the computer. stuff like global variables are declared and saved at the beginning when node.js execute this program. So any new request come in, the server can use these variables very efficiently. </p>

<p>In php, however, the php program execute *.php file based on request. Therefore, if some request is for www.xx.com/index.php, then the program will execute index.php, and in which, there may be stuff like </p>

<pre><code>require(""globalVariables.php"");
</code></pre>

<p>then, php.exe would go there and declare these variables again. same idea for functions and other objects...</p>

<p>So am I correct in thinking that php may not be a good idea when there are many other libraries that need to be included?</p>

<p>I have searched for the comparison, but nobody have talked about this.</p>

I have had some success so far but I am unable to delete an email because I keep getting this error: TypeError: object is not a function.</p>

<p>My Angular knowledge is limited.</p>

<p>In my html I call the function deleteEmail and pass an email id.</p>

<p>Here is the controller:</p>

<pre><code>app.controller('InboxController', function($rootScope, $scope, $cookies,
    $location, InboxService) {

$rootScope.loggedIn = true;

$scope.emails = InboxService.getMessages().success(function(jsonData) {

    $scope.emails = jsonData;
});

$scope.deleteEmail = function(id) {

    $scope.id = {

        'id' : id
    };

    // Parse to JSON
    var responseJSON = angular.toJson($scope.id);

    // Make call to InboxService
    var response = InboxService().del(responseJSON).success(
            function(jsonData) {

                response = jsonData;

                if (response == 'success') {

                    alert('Message deleted');
                } else {

                    alert('Message not deleted');
                }
            });
}
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>The method $scope.emails works fine. It is the $scope.deleteEmail that is giving the error.</p>

<p>Here is the service:</p>

<pre><code>app.factory('InboxService', function InboxService($http) {

var exports = {};

// Get a list of all emails
exports.getMessages = function() {

    return $http.get('resources/inbox/get').error(function(data) {
        console.log('There was an error!', data);
    });
};

// Delete an email
exports.del = function(id) {

    console.log('id ' + id);

    return $http({

        method : 'POST',
        url : 'resources/inbox/delete',
        data : id,
        headers : {
            'Content-Type' : 'application/json'
        }
    });
};

return exports;
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>I don't think I am getting as far as the service though. The problem seems to be with the controller.</p>

    private Service service;

</code></pre>

<p>ContractServiceLocationPK.java</p>

<pre><code>@Embeddable
public class ContractServiceLocationPK implements Serializable {
    //default serial version id, required for serializable classes.
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Column(name=""CONTRACT_ID"", insertable=false, updatable=false, unique=true, nullable=false)
    private long contractId;

    @Column(name=""LOCATION_ID"", insertable=false, updatable=false, unique=true, nullable=false)
    private long locationId;

    @Column(name=""SERVICE_ID"", insertable=false, updatable=false, unique=true, nullable=false)
    private long serviceId;

    //getters &amp; setters &amp; equals &amp; hashcode
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Since I'm using JpaRepository for all other entities I thought that it'd support entities with composite keys. So I defined my Dao as such:</p>

<p>ContractServiceLocationDao.java</p>

<pre><code>@Repository
public interface ContractServiceLocationDao extends
        JpaRepository&lt;ContractServiceLocation, ContractServiceLocationPK&gt; {

}
</code></pre>

<p>However, upon calling the save method on a ContractServiceLocation entity I get a:</p>

<pre><code>org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaSystemException: null id generated for:class hr.kingict.telco.model.ContractServiceLocation; nested exception is org.hibernate.id.IdentifierGenerationException: null id generated for:class hr.kingict.telco.model.ContractServiceLocation
</code></pre>

<p>I've checked in debug that all composite key properties(contract, service and location) are not null. However the exception says ""null id <strong>generated</strong> for class..."" so I'm assuming it somehow tries to generate an id(even though I haven't set the @GeneratedValue annotation).</p>

<p>What can I do to solve this issue? Do I have to write a dao manually instead of relying on JpaRepository?</p>

<p>I want to the userids, status and ""count"" of the login_failures for each userid. I did this:</p>

<p><code>ddply(mytbl, c('userid', 'status'), function(x) c(count=nrow(x)))</code> , but this gives the count for all userids. I want to restrict my output to only those userids whose status is 'login _failed'. Any ideas? I have seen questions on grouping by numeric fields, but, none on strings.</p>

<p>I am not very familiar with all the plyr features. It will great to see how this can be done using summarize, aggregate, sqldf, data.table etc. Slowly understanding each of them.</p>

<p>This works if I create a new Web Forms project in VS2012. However, if I create a new project in VS2013, it doesn't work. It goes into success, but in says UNDEFINED for the data. Also, in VS2012 it triggers the break point in the web method, and in VS2013 it does not. What is the difference and how do I fix this? I already have a whole project in VS2013 where I need to implement this.</p>

<p>My classes:</p>

<pre><code>IXService
CXService
CServiceLauncher
</code></pre>

<p>(Yes, I know the C prefix does not meet current standards, but it is required by my client's standards.)</p>

<p>My service functionality can be tested directly against <code>XService</code>, but I need to test <code>CServiceLauncher</code> as well.  All I want to do is connect to a URI and discover if there is a service running there and what methods it offers.</p>

<p>Other questions I read:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14563557/unit-test-wcf-service"">Unit test WCF service</a> -
starts service host in unit test</li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152338/wcf-unit-test"">WCF Unit Test</a> - recommends
hosting the service in unit test, makes a vague reference to
connecting to service via HTTP</li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2691066/wcf-msmq-unit-testing"">WCF MSMQ Unit testing</a> -
references MSMQ, which is more detailed than I need</li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7929882/unit-test-wcf-method"">Unit test WCF method</a> - I never knew I could auto generate tests, but the system isn't smart enough to know what to assert.  </li>

<pre><code>    public void StartUiTest()

        Uri baseAddress = new Uri(""http://localhost:8080/MyService"");
        string soapAddress = ""soap"";
        IUserInterface target = new CServiceLauncher(baseAddress, soapAddress);
        try

            Assert.AreEqual(true, target.StartUi());
            /// @todo Assert.IsTrue(serviceIsRunning);

After these updates occur, an exportion is done, so i can get a excel worksheet with the entire table updated.</p>

<p>But now I need to do the inverse. Some people will open this document and add lines manually to it, and I need to find some way to append these new lines to a Access table, with an identifier to say if it was inputed manually or not.</p>

<p>My table consists in a ""Student"" database. Each line corresponds to a ""Name"", so when someone adds a new name manually in the worksheet, there is a new student in it, so I need its row to go to the database in a new table. I also need those students that are inputed manually to be updated if they change, somehow.</p>

<p>I made my TestRootCA and used it to issue a server certificate (localhost) and a client certificate (TestUser). I first wanted to establish and test transport security only, so I configured IIS to use https, configured SSL certificate (localhost cert that I made), and configured IIS to <em>require</em> a client certificate from clients. I then modified service web.config, made the corresponding  svcutil.conf and ran svcutil that successfully made client proxy class and app.config for my test WinForms app. I set the certificate when creating proxy client by calling:</p>

<pre><code>var client = new ServiceClient();
client.ClientCredentials.ClientCertificate.SetCertificate(System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.StoreLocation.CurrentUser, System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.StoreName.My, System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509FindType.FindBySubjectDistinguishedName, ""CN=TestUser"");
MessageBox.Show(client.GetData(42));
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good. But when I modify service's web.config to use TrasportWithMessageCredential (instead of Transport) and specify ""Certificate"" as the clientCredentialType for message security I get <code>HTTP 403 - The HTTP request was forbidden with client authentication scheme 'Anonymous'</code>, even though I specified ""Certificate"". </p>

<p>My final web.config looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;
    &lt;bindings&gt;
        &lt;wsHttpBinding&gt;
            &lt;binding name=""wsHttpEndpointBinding""&gt;

                    &lt;message clientCredentialType=""Certificate""/&gt;
                &lt;/security&gt;

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I've managed to get it working by changing IIS SSL settings for Client certificate from <em>require</em> to <em>accept</em>. It seems that when I introduce message security using certificates over transport security using SSL, the client uses the certificate for message signing but <em>not</em> for mutual authentication over SSL (it tries to log on as <em>anonymous</em> even though it has a certificate assigned). </p>

<p>Not sure why this is happening, I'd like some comment from an expert :).</p>

My cousin gave me the idea of looping through a couple of times, generating about 10 study schedules and assigning values to them and the highest value is the chosen timetable to give to the user. </p>

<p>I am trying to generate a random table, where it plots the timetable with some preloaded subjects, their exam dates and their score (% the user got) which will all be populated later dynamically. I am just testing now. </p>

<p>My issue I am facing now is: It only loads the first subject, it does not set the next subject. I have tried to put in constraints such as the maximum amount of time that can be allocated to the one subject, but it does not work for some reason (probably bad code). </p>

<p>So what needs to happen is it needs to see how long we have to study per subject according to what subject is before the other in terms of exam dates (so english more than IT for example which is where the score comes in. That was inverted from the lowest percentage to a higher percentage). </p>

<p>Here is the code for the weighting class:</p>

<pre><code>public void dayCounter() {
    days = new ArrayList&lt;Day&gt;();
    // loop through for how many days we have to study
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; nodays; i++) {

        DateTime d = startDate.plusDays(i);
        // create new day with how many hours we have to study that day
        Day day = new Day(2);
        // set the date and time for the new day object
        day.setDateTime(d);
        // get monday - sunday, what day it is
        DateTime.Property dayOfWeek = d.dayOfWeek();
        // set the day of the week (mon - sun) as name of day object
        day.setName(dayOfWeek.getAsText());
        for(int j = 0; j &lt; day.getMaxNumberOfHours(); j++ ) {
            Subject sub = getSubject();
            try {

                    if(sub.getExamDate().isBefore(day.getDateTime())) {

<p>The line that initializes <code>rand</code> is:</p>

<p>Also, how can I make sure that once the exam has happened, you do not need to study for that subject anymore?</p>

<p>As mentioned <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21557341/three-js-get-world-rotation-from-matrixworld"">here</a>, I can get the world-rotation from my original <code>child1</code> like this:</p>

<p>I think this can be done by getting the difference of the world-rotation from <code>parent2</code> and <code>child2</code> and substracting this from the world-rotation of <code>child1</code>, to correct the offset generated by the rotation of <code>child2</code>.
But my knlowledge of quaternions and matrices is to bad to get it working.</p>

Thanks a lot.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I tried the approach of WestLangley. If my Objects are only rotated around x-axis it works like this (<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/laurid/uocx3bua/36/"" rel=""nofollow"">see fiddle</a>)</p>

<pre><code>//calculate the relative rotation of child2
THREE.SceneUtils.detach( child2, parent2, scene );
var rotX=parent2.rotation.x-child2.rotation.x;
var rotY=parent2.rotation.y-child2.rotation.y;
var rotZ=parent2.rotation.z-child2.rotation.z;
THREE.SceneUtils.attach( child2, scene, parent2 );

//combine the relative rotation of child2 and the 'world' rotation of child1
THREE.SceneUtils.detach( child1, parent1, scene );
rotX+=child1.rotation.x;
rotY+=child1.rotation.y;
rotZ+=child1.rotation.z;
THREE.SceneUtils.attach( child1, scene, parent1 );
parent2.rotation.set(rotX,rotY,rotZ);//assign it to parent2
</code></pre>

<p>If my Objects are rotated around x,y,z this is NOT working anymore (<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/laurid/uocx3bua/37/"" rel=""nofollow"">fiddle</a>). Is this a problem with gimbal lock? Do I need to do the calculation with quaternions instead of Euler Objects?</p>

isSpeakWait(ttsDE);
ttsDE.speak(strDE, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH, null);

<p>To do that, I introduced ScrollViewer as the layout root - the idea was to show appropriate scrollbars when screen is lower then the fixed minimum so the user can scroll the main layout. The problem is, now the whole layout grows without any bounds and scrollbars appear regardless of screen size.</p>

<p>One solution is to set the content's fixed size equal to the minimum supported size. This, however, kills the graceful growing if screen is larger. Or, I imagine, I could programmatically set the maximum size to what I determine is screen resolution.</p>

<p>I found this in the <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/release-9-2.html#AEN113100"" rel=""nofollow"">9.2 release notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Increasing the length limit for a varchar or varbit column, or removing the limit altogether, no longer requires a table rewrite. Similarly, increasing the allowable precision of a numeric column, or changing a column from constrained numeric to unconstrained numeric, no longer requires a table rewrite. Table rewrites are also avoided in similar cases involving the interval, timestamp, and timestamptz types.</p>

<h2>The situation is equal to this:</h2>

<p>There are four files for two classes A and B. Every class has got its header file (e.g. ""A.hpp"") and its implementation file (e.g. ""A.tpp"").</p>

<h2>The dependencies are as follows:</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>A's header requires B' header</em></li>
<li><em>A's impl requires B's header</em></li>
<li><em>B's header requires nothing but a forward declaration to A</em></li>
<li><em>B's impl requires A's header</em></li>
</ul>

<p>So in a source-based library everything would be fine with the following order of source file inclusion and compilation:</p>

<ul>
<li>B.hpp</li>
<li>A.hpp</li>
<li>A.tpp or B.tpp (order here is not important)</li>
</ul>

<p>My files are structured in this way:</p>

<h2>File content for A.hpp:</h2>

<pre><code>#ifndef A_H
#define A_H
#include ""B.hpp""
class A { ... };
#include ""A.tpp""
#endif
</code></pre>

<h2>File content for A.tpp:</h2>

<pre><code>#ifndef A_H
    #error ""Do not include this file directly.""
#endif
// ... some implementations for A.hpp
</code></pre>

<h2>File content for B.hpp:</h2>

<pre><code>#ifndef B_H
#define B_H
class A;
class B { ... };
#include ""B.tpp""
#endif
</code></pre>

<h2>File content for B.tpp:</h2>

<pre><code>#include ""A.hpp""
#ifndef B_H
    #error ""Do not include this file directly.""
#endif
// ... some implementations for B.hpp
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is: Is there a solution for breaking this unnessesary circular dependency which only happens due to the fact that I am using a header-only solution for my library?</p>

Although this is throw-away code, I'm concerned that I'll repeat this in the future.  I've never had to manage memory in PHP, but with the number of rows in the db, it's blowing up my php instance (already upped the memory to 1Gb).</p>

<p>The california table is especially larger than the others (currently 2.2m rows, less as I delete duplicate rows).  I get a memory error on line 31 ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($res))</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 1073741824 bytes exhausted (tried
  to allocat e 24 bytes) in C:\Documents and Settings\R\My Documents\My
  Webpages\cdiac\cdiac_ dup.php on line 31</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PHP 5.3.0, mysql 5.1.36.  part of a wamp install.</p>

<p>here's the entire code.  the purpose of this script is to delete duplicate entries (data was acquired into segmented tables, which was far faster at the time, but now I have to merge those tables.) </p>

<p>what's causing it?  something I'm overlooking?  or do I just need to watch the memory size and call garbage collection manually when it gets big?</p>

I used to do this to create a class,</p>

<pre><code>CoverFlowClass coverFlow = new CoverFlowClass(this)
coverFlow.setAdapter(new ImageAdapter(this));
</code></pre>

<p>But now I want to use XML so I can do layouting. I create an XML code like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;id.co.ajsmsig.display.CoverFlowClass
    android:id=""@+id/coverflow""
    android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But when I create from the code like this :</p>

<pre><code>CoverFlowClass coverFlow=  (CoverFlowClass) findViewById(R.id.coverflow);
coverFlow.setAdapter(new ImageAdapter(this));
</code></pre>

<p>My app force closed.
The error log in LogCat i found is : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>04-18 07:46:34.804: E/AndroidRuntime(1847): at id.co.ajsmsig.display.CoverFlowMain.onCreate(CoverFlowMain.java:76). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the line 76 is : </p>

<pre><code>coverFlow.setAdapter(new ImageAdapter(this));
</code></pre>

<p>I think because the class is using a parameter in it constructor (= new CoverFlowClass(this)) while findViewById does not give any parameter. I still have no idea, how to make this work? Any idea is appreciated.</p>

<p>There are 2 problems on this approach within my code</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>JQuery library</strong> is located at the bottom line of the Master Page (_Layout)
There's a <strong>wrapper</strong> over all the plugins inside the famous <code>ready()</code> function which is located there.</p></li>
<li><p>As an alternative way I placed the <code>$('#myModal').show();</code> inside the <code>JQuery.ready()</code> in the Wrapper which when it calls everything if it should have found the <code>""#myModal""</code> based on my conditions then it'll fire the function I desired.
but again that won't fire.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think this approach seems to be more logical and may be the only logical between these 2 approaches cause the first one the function isn't located in the <strong>JQuery ready</strong> function, and if I use another ready function here it's also wrong because of the duplicate of ready function.</p>

<p>I understand the error is caused by the fact the the password field does not exist. However, I'm not quite sure how to go about getting the tests to invoke the Account method so the passwords would be encrypted. Can anyone help with this?</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION ANSWER (Thanks @Joe)</strong></p>

<p>I had to add a setter method for the password field:</p>

<pre><code>public void setPassword(String password) {
        this.passwordhash = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt());
}
</code></pre>

<p>My <code>Account</code> model now looks like this:

        this.email = email;
        this.username = username;
        this.passwordhash = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt()); 
    }

        account.save();
        return account;
    }

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        this.passwordhash = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt());

<p>How to implement a thread-safe collection property?</p>

<pre><code>var handle = Process.GetProcessById(appProcId).MainWindowHandle;
</code></pre>

<p>I then create an <code>IWin32Window</code> using that handle:</p>

<pre><code>IWin32Window owner = new MyWindowHandleWrapper(handle);
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>MyWindowHandleWrapper</code> is a trivial implementation of the <code>IWin32Window</code> interface.)</p>

<p>I then create a form and show it modal over the <code>IWin32Window</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var form = new ...
form.ShowDialog(owner);
</code></pre>

<p>This works like a treat if everything works OK. However, if the application that creates the modal form crashes, or is killed (from the task manager, for example), then the application window for which the form was shown modal on top of, remains frozen.</p>

<p>Is this really just another Windows brain damage that I need to live with, or is there something I can do about it?</p>

<p>I can't seem to replicate the issue on my windows 7 machine to see what's happening.</p>

<p>Here's what I'm using for ejecting the CD.  It works fine on my win 7 machine and on win xp machines.</p>

<pre><code>mciSendString(""set CDAudio door open"", null, 0, IntPtr.Zero);
</code></pre>

<p>Both the XP machines and the win 7 machine have multiple cd drives, including the one I'm trying to replicate the issue with.  The XP machines seem to know which drive to eject after it's done copying the files from the disc.</p>

<p>On one particular win 7 machine, it seems to throw the ""Access is Denied"" exception when it gets to the line to eject the cd drive.  The line with mciSendString.</p>

<p>I'm curious if anyone has seen this exception before or know of a better way to handle the call to eject an external cd drive as opposed to using mciSendString which seems to choose the lower drive letter when ejecting.</p>

<p>@xxbbcc - Getting device id on the event arrived method:</p>

<pre><code>            _watcher = new ManagementEventWatcher(scope, q);
            _watcher.EventArrived += new EventArrivedEventHandler(watcher_EventArrived);
</code></pre>

<p>And for the event arrived method we have:</p>

<pre><code>            PropertyData pd = e.NewEvent.Properties[""TargetInstance""];

            if (pd.Value != null)
            {

                _driveName = (string)wmiDevice.Properties[""DeviceID""].Value;
            }
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:::  Figured out the answer.  It turns out the drive was bad.  We took the bad drive and tried in a good win7 machine, and it was still bad.  Took a good drive and tried in the original machine and the good one worked.  </p>

<p>Access is denied was a bit misleading because we could still eject the tray from the disc management window and the button on the front of the drive still ejected and closed it.</p>

<p>Also, for anyone interested, mciSendString way of ejecting a disc drive will eject the tray for the lowest drive letter.</p>

<p>In this example, <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/xReHA/"">http://jsfiddle.net/xReHA/</a>, I am able to fade out all of the links and nodes then fade in the connected links, but, so far, I haven't been able to elegantly fade in the connected nodes that are children of the currently mouseover'd node.</p>

<p>This is the key function from the code:</p>

<pre><code>function fade(opacity) {
    return function(d, i) {
        //fade all elements
        svg.selectAll(""circle, line"").style(""opacity"", opacity);

        var associated_links = svg.selectAll(""line"").filter(function(d) {
            return d.source.index == i || d.target.index == i;
        }).each(function(dLink, iLink) {
            //unfade links and nodes connected to the current node
            d3.select(this).style(""opacity"", 1);
            //THE FOLLOWING CAUSES: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'setProperty' of undefined
            d3.select(dLink.source).style(""opacity"", 1);
            d3.select(dLink.target).style(""opacity"", 1);
        });
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am getting a <code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'setProperty' of undefined</code> error when I try to set the opacity on an element I loaded from the source.target. I suspect this is not the right way to load that node as a d3 object, but I can't find another way to load it without iterating over all of the nodes again to find the ones that match the link's target or source. To keep the performance reasonable, I don't want to iterate over all the nodes more than necessary.</p>

<p>I took the example of fading the links from <a href=""http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/chord.html"">http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/chord.html</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SKHiG.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"26223280","1","","","2014-10-06 19:18:46","","3","219","<p>I've been using Eigen in my software, and I've run into an issue today, caused by changing my code from building a static library to dynamic library in Windows, using Visual Studio 2013.  The reason for this switch was not related to Eigen.</p>

<p>I am embedding Eigen in my own library file, which itself is then linked into my application(s).  As mentioned before, this library had been a static library until today; I have just updated my codebase to generate a DLL file instead.</p>

<p>Since making this change, I am now getting the following error message from Visual Studio:</p>

<p><strong>The Block at -------------------- was allocated by aligned routines, use _aligned_free()</strong></p>

<p>(that this message pops up numerous times with different addresses each time; I've used dashes above, as I don't believe that the specific addresses are relevant to this issue).</p>

<p>choosing ""retry"" opens the debugger to line 255 on Memory.h</p>

<p>Visual studio IntelliSense (when not debugging) suggests that EIGEN_ALIGN and EIGEN_HAS_MM_MALLOC are both defined as 1, EIGEN_MALLOC_ALREADY_ALIGNED and EIGEN_HAS_POSIX_MEMALIGN are both undefined.  Accordingly, it should be running _mm_free(ptr), which (again-based from IntelliSense) is an alias for _aligned_free(a).  As such, it appears that this code should be running the correct function, but it isn't.</p>

<p>When I change the code back to a static library, this issue goes away.</p>

<p>The only thing remotely relevant that I found from numerous Google searches was an article from Intel Fortran Compiler saying that this error message might come from a library which was compiled in an earlier version that is called by code compiled with the latest version.  Aside from the fact that I am using Visual Studio C++ 2013, I have rebuilt the code numerous times to be sure that it is all fully recompiled from a clean state and this error message persists.</p>

<p>I have downloaded the latest code from the mercurial repo (default branch), but this did not solve the problem.</p>

<p>I've tried to be as thorough as I could be.  If you need any more information, please let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Further context:</p>

<p>The 'client code' which utilizes the DLL in this case is Google Test; the error message is raised after testing an expectation -- i.e. the class in the DLL file is running the destructor to cleanup a temporary object.  I am not attempting to do evil things like allocate memory in the DLL file and then de-allocate it in the driver app -- that's partly why I find this to be so confusing....</p>

<p>Thanks-</p>

<pre><code>require 'socket'

port = 3333

server = TCPServer.new(port)
puts ""Starting TCPServer @ port #{port} with PID=#{Process.pid}""

loop do
  client = server.accept

    end
    client.close_write
    exit 0
  end
  if(pid &gt; 0)
    Process.detach(pid)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I started with <a href=""http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/server.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/server.c</a> and I changed the forking part to:</p>

<pre><code>if (!fork())
  {             // this is the child process
    FILE *client = fdopen (new_fd, ""r+"");
    close (sockfd);     // child doesn't need the listener
    char buffer[BUFSIZ];
    while (fgets (buffer, BUFSIZ, client))
      {
    fputs (buffer, stdout);
      }
    fclose (client);
    exit (0);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I'm wrapping the file descriptor of the socket in a FILE structure (<code>fdopen(...)</code>) in order to get <code>fgets(...)</code>. 
Is this the wrong thing to do to begin with?</p>

<p>This whole approach seems to work if I do <code>nc localhost 3333</code> (with the compiled server running) and simply type the input on the command line (lines get echoed back). However, if I do <code>cat a_multiline_file.txt|nc localhost 3333</code>, I only get the first 
line back because in that case, all except the first call to <code>fgets()</code> fail (I tried doing the same <code>fgets</code> in an infinite loop).</p>

<p>I'm curious to know what the cause of the problem is and how I can do line-by-line reading on a socket correctly.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>On JoeManiaci's advice, I added:
<code>perror(""Last failure"");</code> after the while loop, which got me ""Last failure: Illegal seek"" for the second case.
So that makes sense -- seeking doesn't make sense on sockets, and if fgets does not only buffering but seeking too, that makes the fdopen approach out of the question for sockets.</p>

<p>Part 2 of my question remains--how do I do line-oriented reading on sockets correctly in C?</p>

<p>In the beginning I was told to use the sessionFactory and openSession together with beginTransaction to do db calls.</p>

<p>Later I heard about dao's so I started using it by creating an interface, implementing this interface in a class and then have this class extend HibernateDAOSupport.</p>

<p>I figured this was pretty solid until a colleague told me that this way is deprecated and that I should not use the HibernateDAOSupport class. But instead work with a SessionFactory instance in my dao implementation class and an instance of that class in a new seperate service class. Since this also seemed like a good way to do it, I decided to follow this path.</p>

<p>Just now I've read that this method is also deprecated with the new version of spring...
So my question is: What on earth is the correct up-to-date way to bring hibernate and spring together??</p>

<p>I've also heard talk about an entity manager, what is that about?</p>

Assumptions in this context would be preconditions for a test, such that if the assumption evaluated to false, the test would be skipped rather than executed (and handled accordingly by the runners).</p>

<p>In this particular case, I'm thinking about dependencies between tests - so there might be a basic test that validates whether a method returns <em>anything at all</em>, followed by later tests that drill into the specifics of the response.  If the former test fails, I'd rather have the latter test marked as ""not runnable"" in some way, rather than have them fail as well.</p>

<p>That said I can imagine using this in future to define some unconnected preconditions (such as the hard drive must have at least 20MB of space free), so if there's a general way of skippin a test at runtime (as opposed to using <code>ignore</code> or <code>pending</code>) I'd prefer to hear that.</p>

<p>Specialised syntax is welcome, though if I have to manually throw a certain kind of exception that's OK too.</p>

<pre><code>UIImage *photo = [self.selectedDictionary objectForKey:@""ProfileImage""];

<p>Does anything look wrong here? What could be the problem?</p>

<p>Edit1:
It is crashing when I do this to call a method:
Code:</p>

<pre><code>if(actionSheet.tag == 1) {
            [self showAchievements];
        }

<p>This is the showAchievements method:
Code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)showAchievements {
    GKAchievementViewController *achievements = [[GKAchievementViewController alloc] init];
    if (achievements != nil)
    {
        achievements.achievementDelegate = self;
        [self presentModalViewController:achievements animated:YES];
    }
}

- (void)achievementViewControllerDidFinish:(GKAchievementViewController *)viewController
{
    [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
    [viewController release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can this crash be because I have not properly hooked everything up in iTC? I am definitely sure it crashes in that method and I do not know why.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>Edit2: I am getting down to it here, in my console, right before it crashes it has a line saying Missed Method. So I search for where this NSLog is and it is in GameCenterManager.m, a file necessary for Game Center I think. Here is the method:</p>

<pre><code>    - (void) callDelegate: (SEL) selector withArg: (id) arg error: (NSError*) err
{
    assert([NSThread isMainThread]);
    if([delegate respondsToSelector: selector])
    {
        if(arg != NULL)
        {
            [delegate performSelector: selector withObject: arg withObject: err];
        }
        else
        {

<p>So I am using a Go package for handling my mongodb stuffs, but I don't want to import that package into every model and what not. I'd like to keep as many of my sub packages (like models) to just the standard library. So I thought I would lay out some interfaces like so:</p>

<pre><code>type m map[string]interface{}

type collectionSlice interface {
    One(interface{}) error
}

type collection interface {
    Upsert(interface{}, interface{}) (interface{}, error)
    Find(interface{}) collectionSlice
}

type database interface {
    C(string) collection
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, when I go to use a function like:</p>

<pre><code>func FindItem(defindex int, d database) (*Item, error) {
</code></pre>

<p>that is found in the package that is using the interfaces by passing in my mgo.Database:</p>

<pre><code>item, err := dota.FindItem(int(defindex), ctx.Database)
</code></pre>

<p>I get a compiler error:</p>

<p>controllers/handlers.go:35: cannot use ctx.Database (type *mgo.Database) as type dota.database in function argument:
        *mgo.Database does not implement dota.database (wrong type for C method)
                have C(string) *mgo.Collection
                want C(string) dota.collection</p>

<p>The trigger code is:</p>

<pre><code>delimiter |
CREATE TRIGGER calc_ttl_cost AFTER INSERT ON buybox_rec
  FOR EACH ROW 
  BEGIN
      UPDATE buybox_rec SET total_cost = (price+shipping_cost);

<p>I'm using phpMyAdmin to run the SQL commands, so I know that the trigger is being created successfully.  Furthermore, if I run the <code>UPDATE buybox_rec SET total_cost = (price+shipping_cost);</code> SQL statement alone, it works as expected. (I've also tried the same code with back-ticks around the field names, but I wouldn't be writing all this if that worked)</p>

<p>The problem is that when I insert a new row, the trigger doesn't work and this error is thrown:</p>

<pre><code>#1442 - Can't update table 'buybox_rec' in stored function/trigger 
because it is already used by statement which invoked this stored 
unction/trigger.

<p>The error seems like some sort of recursive or circular reference problem, but I can't figure out where/what the problem is.</p>

<p>I also tried creating a stored procedure and calling it from within the trigger to try obtaining the same result, but I got the same error.</p>

<p>I checked a bunch of other SO questions related to MySQL UPDATE triggers and did some Googling, but here I am.</p>

<p>Is this out of the scope of MySQL? It seems like such a common and easy task to allow for.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I accomplish this task autonomously? (AKA I don't want to hear about summing the fields after the fact via PHP, for example)</p>

<p>Edit: I should note that this only happens in Debug version. In Release it works like a charm
I've tracked the problem back to the mysqlpp_d.dll, the MySQL++ object are crashing on there destructors due to reference counting. It complains about not being capable of accessing the memory of the ref counter, and when it tries to decrease it, it crashes. At least thats what I think happens.</p>

   #ifdef PINNED_MEMORY
      // allocate pinned memory

I can't find an answer for this anywhere.</p>

<p>I'm writing a little plugin for my web app and I want all the select boxes to have a disabled default option: <code>&lt;option disabled='disabled'&gt;-Select-&lt;/option&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>That would be easy to do, except the user can come back in and edit their information. So i need to check if the select has a value selected:</p>

<pre><code> if ($this.val()) {
                            ...
                        } else {
                            $this.prepend(""&lt;option disabled='disabled' class='disabled'&gt;-Select-&lt;/option&gt;"")[0].selectedIndex = 0;
                        }
</code></pre>

<p>I have attempted other solutions, that is just an example.</p>

<p>Edit: The idea is that the first time they come in or if they haven't previously selected it will be defaulted to that disabled select option</p>

<p>A problem arises where the browser sets a default option itself (the first one). Then the $this.val() has a value, when in fact the user has not selected a value.</p>

<p>So the question is:<br>
<strong>How do you place a default option into a select that can still retain a previously selected value using jquery?</strong></p>

<p>I can get the core sqlite4java library downloaded easily, but I'm not sure what the best (any!) way to get gradle to download the native libraries and put them in the right place.</p>

<p>This is my build.gradle file:</p>

    test {

<p>(I'm building from within IntelliJ, but am using the gradle build options - so I don't think it's ItelliJ stuffing up the class path when running the tests...)</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the first time I tried to build I got some message about being unable to unpack the libsqlite4java-osx ZIP file, (not surprisingly as maven central says its a dylib file).</p>

<p>What do I need to do to make gradle do the right thing?</p>

<p><strong>ASIDE</strong>: I'm able to get the code to run by manually copying the downloaded <code>.dylib</code> from the maven cache into somewhere listed in my <code>java.library.path</code> (Think I used <code>$HOME/Library/Java/Extensions</code> on my mac). But this seems contrary to the whole point of packaging all setup and dependencies in the <code>.gradle</code> file, and wont let me distribute anything easily later.</p>

Leaving aside the whys and wherefores of loops for the moment (I know the arguments against them very well), can anyone explain what's happening?</p>

<p>Imagine two users, SourceUser and DestUser both in the same database, each with their tables in the same tablespace. A bunch of stored procedures in SourceUser populate data from SourceUser into DestUser for reporting purposes. As part of this, the first procedure to be run drops all the tables in DestUser and re-creates them. Again, not debating the relative merits of doing that here.</p>

<p>SourceUser has Drop Any Table and Create Any Table privileges on DestUser. There is one table in DestUser that we want to keep. So, the SQL I constructed in the procedure looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Begin
  For T In (SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM all_tables WHERE TABLE_NAME != 'MIDBLOG' AND OWNER = sTarget_DB) Loop
    Begin
      Execute Immediate('Drop Table ' || sTarget_DB || '.' || T.TABLE_NAME);

    Exception
      When Others Then
        --Don't care if we get an exception here as most likely the table wasn't there to be dropped in the first place.
        NULL;
    End;
  End Loop;
End;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case sTarget_DB is set to DestUser, and this code is being run against SourceUser.</p>

<p>When the procedure is run I find that no tables have been deleted (I confirmed that there were a couple of dozen tables including one named MIDBLOG before starting). I ran it in SQL Developer debug mode and the execution never even gets to the inside of the loop as it appears to think it has no rows to process but I know for certain that the select statement would return a couple of dozen table names.</p>

<p>Next I amended it to this:</p>

<pre><code>Begin
  For T In (SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM all_tables WHERE OWNER = sTarget_DB) Loop
    Begin
      If T.TABLE_NAME != 'MIDBLOG' THEN
        Execute Immediate('Drop Table ' || sTarget_DB || '.' || T.TABLE_NAME);
      End If;
    Exception
      When Others Then
        --Don't care if we get an exception here as most likely the table wasn't there to be dropped in the first place.
        NULL;
    End;
  End Loop;
End;
</code></pre>

<p>After running this the only table that WAS removed was the very one I didn't want removed! Even more odd was that the loop only executed once, as though the select query was only returning one row. I could see it happening if I ran the procedure in debug on SQL Developer 3.2. We did the same thing on a colleagues PC on SQL Developer (possibly 3.1) and again the loop only executed once but this time it correctly decided not to drop the table MIDBLOG and again left everything else alone.</p>

<p>If I run either of the above examples as an anonymous block in SQL Developer it does exactly what I expect it to do. I tried the more verbose explicit cursor declaration and had the same results as before. At no time did I get any exceptions. </p>

<p>All this was on Oracle 10g Enterprise Edition Release 10.2.0.4.0 (64bit). As soon as tried it on Oracle 11g Enterprise Edition Release 11.2.0.1.0 (64bit) it worked just fine. Why on earth should such a basic requirement exhibit such wildly different behaviour across the two versions? Can it work as I want in both versions with the same bit of code?</p>

Each application is using reporting services functionality.
The average load per server per month is about 40.000 reports, taking an average of 3.1 secs to deliver a report.</p>

<p>At this moment the the situation is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application A has his database on SQLServer A and is using Reporting
Services on SQLServer A. (SQL 2008) </li>
<li>Application B has his database on    SQLServer B and is using
Reporting Services on SQLServer B. (SQL 2008R2)</li>
<li>Application C has his database on SQLServer C and is using<br>
Reporting Services on SQLServer C.  (SQL 2008R2).</li>
</ul>

<p>We have just bought a new server, runnning SQL 2012.
Would it be wise to move all reporting to the Reporting Server 2012?
My idea is that there would be a significant performance-gain. Also, There would be only one reporting server to manage. But is that so? Are there penalties when running reports on one server while the database feeding the reports is on another server? Is it a problem if the Reporting Services version is different then that of the database server?</p>

<p>I would like very much to hear your thoughts on this.
Performance and manageability are two key-components.</p>

<p>Obviously these are different - one is using form/post params (<code>-d</code> switch) and one is using query params.</p>

<p><strong>I've been poring over the HTTP 1.1 spec, and I can't see how the <code>-d</code> option should be allowed with a GET request?</strong> Is there documentation that GET requests should support form/post params?</p>

<p>The closest I've come to is <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.3"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC1866, page 46, section 17.13.3</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the method is ""get"" and the action is an HTTP URI, the user agent takes the value of action, appends a `?' to it, then appends the form data set, encoded using the ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" content type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... but that makes it sound like curl is doing it wrong?</p>

<p>or switching the definition but then I receive this error </p>

<pre><code>You cannot search for the association field '\Entity\EditedBooks#section', because it is the inverse side of an association. Find methods only work on owning side associations.

<p>but to me it seems like sclr17 exists, am I missing something?</p>

<p><strong>The ugly Workaround</strong>
I know it is not the right thing to do but sometimes a man has to to what a man has to do:</p>

<pre><code>    $noSection = new Sections();      
    $noSection-&gt;setTitle(""Sectionless"");
    //add all the books 
    $noSection-&gt;setEditedBook(new ArrayCollection($books));

        foreach($sBooks as $b){
            $noSection-&gt;removeEditedBook($b);

<p><strong>Note: In my app i am getting the image into gallery then split the image and <code>shuffle the image pieces(chunks)</code>, and then merge the image, and create a **canvas for drawing</strong> all those small(chunks) images .**</p>

<ol>
<li>after splitting the 420*320 size of image,need the image block(chunk) size 50*50 or 40*40.</li>
<li>the remaining 20*20 block(chunk) assign to the last block or any of the other block.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the original image before splitting and it's dimension is 420*320:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6cqUJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>and this is the image after splitting,the overall image dimension is same 420*320,but the piece(chunk) of image block size is 84*64,<strong>and i want to block size is 50*50 or 40*40</strong> and overall image size will also be same 420*320,and the remaining size will be assign to the last block.</p>

Basically I need to take the current time, and a predetermined event time, and see if the current time is 10 minutes prior to the event time.  This is my test file, it gets the current time into a variable, then pulls the eventTime from the database table, sets the event time to a variable, subtracts the current time from the event time, and prints the difference.  The problem is that I need the minutes, and it just prints the hours.</p>

<p>For example 11:00 - 9:15 gives me 1, where I need it to say 105 (amount of minutes), I have really looked all over, and can't find anything that wouldn't involve changing the db structure.</p>

<p>The database stores event time in 24h format in hours and minutes ex 13:01, and the current time is set in the same format in php using date(""H:i"")</p>

<p>Here's some test code, the include dbconnect.php is just how I'm connecting to my database.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help you can offer!</p>

<pre><code> &lt;?php
include 'dbconnect.php';

$the_time = date('H:i');
echo $the_time."" &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"";

$sql=""SELECT eventTime FROM events"";

<pre><code>Could not connect to data source 'New Data Source':
The network connection was terminated because the host failed to send any data.

<p>When putting the settings in a regular connection string and opening with .NET code, that is fine. I am new to BizTalk and DB2. Can anybody suggest what to look out for when this error surfaces?</p>

<p><strong>24 Aug 08:</strong></p>

<p>Well, if normal .NET code with a regular DB2 connection string is used, the connection can be made and queries submitted. What this DB2 adapter is reporting is it cannot even make a proper connection handshake, let alone submitting queries. I am unsure of what are the actual mechanisms involved to make a DB2 connection happen.</p>

<p>I have seen that and that is not the case here. If we put the user name as the Package Collection it still hits the same problem.</p>

<p><strong>26 Aug 08:</strong></p>

<p>Because of the scarcity of information regarding connecting to mainframe DB2 databases from Microsoft products, I undertook the task of inspecting raw network packets to get a clue what is going on between the .NET DB2 provider's connection (which works) and the BizTalk 2006 DB2 adapter (which bombs). I observed DB2 traffic is done using the DRDA protocol. And ultimately concluded the BizTalk adapter method fails because of what's recorded in the server's reply SECCHKRM packet</p>

<p>Why the same credentials fails here while succeeding in the .NET provider is beyond me. Right now, what I can observe is a marked difference between each method when it comes to the sequence of packets transferred.</p>

<p>It is interesting to witness the .NET provider issue out various DRDA protocol packets within in a single TCP segment. The BizTalk adapter on the other hand, places only one protocol packet per TCP segment. I do not know why this is so. However, I at the moment think that is a red herring and the true difference causing the failure in authentication is in the DRDA data exchange. I do not know the DRDA protocol so will have to study it before I can make more sense of it.</p>

<p><strong>18 Sep 08:</strong></p>

<p>At this stage the problem is still not solved, as getting cooperation from the DB2 DBA team and help from Microsoft have been met with many obstacles.</p>

<p>What I do want to report is, I have observed perhaps one crucial difference between all the cases of successful connection versus the failed attempt:</p>

<p>The BizTalk DB2 adapter is underlyingly using <strong>Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2</strong>. The other software tests that succeed make use of <strong>IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER</strong> or <strong>IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER – IBMCL1</strong>. The IBM driver's parameter configuration is different from Microsoft's driver. But we do not see any obviously critical difference that may lead to a failed authentication for the Microsoft driver.</p>

<p>So yeah, obviously I need a <code>wchar_t *</code> here, but I don't see any reason why <code>char *</code> would not do the job here.</p>

<p>What is the best practice here?
Convert <code>char *</code> to <code>wchar *</code> and deal with locales (<a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/mbstowcs/"" rel=""nofollow"">mbstowcs</a>), which would also introduce unnecessary dynamic memory allocs?</p>

<p>Also, if Python decided to go for <code>wchar</code> entirely, why does <code>Py_GetVersion()</code> return a <code>char *</code> as I expected it? </p>

<p>I found a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18245140/how-do-you-use-the-python3-c-api-for-a-command-line-driven-app"">similar question for Python &lt;3.3 </a>, but I hope Python 3.3 is different (PEP 393?).</p>

<p>The code has to be cross-platform capable.</p>

<p>=> What's a fast and efficient solution to pass C strings (<code>char *</code>) to Python 3.3?</p>

I'v read that the most commonly used way to organize trunk/branches/tags is to do it per project.</p>

<p>Question #1: So to make a release with this structure will I have to tags each and every project separatly?
What I'm thinking is that I could create several levels of trunk/branches/tags, one in the root and one for each project. This would allow me to create a tag for all my code from the root trunk.</p>

<pre><code>would look something like this:
/rep
    /trunk
        /office
            /project1
                /trunk
                /branches
                /tags
            /project2
                /trunk
                /branches
                /tags
        /shared
            /shared_project
                /trunk
                /branches
                /tags
    /tags
    /branches
</code></pre>

<p>Question #2: If my solution to Q#1 is a bad idea and I have to tag each project for itself, what then, if we later find a bug in v.1 and need to make a hotfix. Do I then again have to manually switch each project to the v.1 tag and branch each of them to a development branch?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your answers. I've decided that I'm gonna convince my team to move to Mercurical, seems like the right VCS for how we want to work. I've also looked at git but hq looks more smooth.</p>

Then enabled MSMQ HTTP feature, however, ""MSMQ"" virtual directory still gets created under our site XYZ.</p>

<p>Note: XYZ was created before enabling MSMQ HTTP support. I am not sure if the sequence matters!</p>

<li>""date"" bigint(16)</li>
<li>""uploads"" (text)</li>
<li>""session"" (text)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have simplified the problematic code into its own area so I could test and replicate my issues. It does replicate my problem which is that my SELECT statement does not return false when there is no matching record as I thought it should.</p>

<p>Here is some of the code I am now working with...</p>

<pre><code>    $connect = mysqli_connect('localhost','ampache','xxxxxxxxxxx','ampache');

    if (!$connect) {
        echo '&lt;br /&gt;ERROR: Could not connect to database.&lt;br /&gt;';
        die;
    }

    if (!mysqli_query($connect, ""SELECT uploads FROM upload_history WHERE session='test'"")) {

        if (!mysqli_query($connect, ""INSERT INTO upload_history (user, date, session) VALUES ($user, '$date_time', '$session')"")) {
            echo '&lt;br /&gt;ERROR: Could not INSERT INTO database.&lt;br /&gt;';
            die;
        }
    }

    $thread_id = mysqli_thread_id($connect);
    mysqli_kill($connect,$thread_id);
    mysqli_close($connect);
</code></pre>

<p>...I get no sql errors running this but, the SELECT statement does not return anything that evaluates to false and so does not run through the if statement that inserts a new record.</p>

<p>I then change the <code>SELECT uploads FROM upload_history WHERE session='$session'</code> to <code>SELECT * FROM upload_history WHERE session='$session'</code>. Even though I don't want to pull all the records in the long run. This doesn't make a difference.</p>

<p>I then change the former change to <code>SELECT FROM upload_history WHERE session='$session'</code>. This creates the new record but gives the following error...</p>

<pre><code>Error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'FROM upload_history WHERE session='test'' at line 1
</code></pre>

<p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you for your time.</p>

<h2>SOLUTIONS <em>(added to introduce my findings in retrospect-Seminecis)</em></h2>

<p>The answer given below by Shaun Hare is a correct solution to my issue above though, I still wasn't satisfied that SELECT wasn't behaving as I expected. I continued to look into what I was doing wrong.</p>

<p>Seeing that Shaun Hare used ""<strong>num_rows</strong>"" I realized a gap in my knowledge, of which there are many. I was trying to use the mysqli result as if it contained only the information that I asked the database for. Since there was a command to return the number of rows from the result I thought there might be a command for pulling the data I wanted out of result. I found ""<strong>mysqli_fetch_assoc</strong>"" to my liking. I can't believe that after pouring over the php online manual for weeks I had apparently misunderstood how to use sql with php. The online manual isn't always easy to find what you want and teaching myself leaves some to be desired.</p>

<p>In retrospect I see that my issue seems stupid to more experienced users however, I am editing here in case someone else ends up needing this information.</p>

<h2>I found this to work...</h2>

<pre><code>    $connect = mysqli_connect('localhost','ampache','xxxxxxxxxxx','ampache');

    if (!$connect) {
        echo '&lt;br /&gt;ERROR: Could not connect to database.&lt;br /&gt;';
        die;
    }

    $result = mysqli_query($connect,""SELECT uploads FROM upload_history WHERE session='test'"");

    if (!mysqli_fetch_assoc($result['uploads'])) {

        if (!mysqli_query($connect, ""INSERT INTO upload_history (user, date, session) VALUES ($user, '$date_time', '$session')"")) {
            echo '&lt;br /&gt;ERROR: Could not INSERT INTO database.&lt;br /&gt;';
            die;
        }
    }

    $thread_id = mysqli_thread_id($connect);
    mysqli_kill($connect,$thread_id);
    mysqli_close($connect);
</code></pre>

<p>...so, in the end, I was looking for ""<strong>mysqli_fetch_assoc</strong>"" or ""<strong>mysqli_fetch_array</strong>"" because that solves more than one issue for me. I am uncertain whether this solution or Shaun Hare's solution would work better, quicker or any different for the issue I listed above but, they both work.</p>

<p>Thank you for your indulgence.</p>

<p>So, most of us have heard by now of the cool features Java 8 will bring, but Android will not support it. This is because of Google using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Harmony"">Apache Harmony</a> for Android. This is what is keeping us (the android app developers) from improving our code with lambdas, default implementations in interfaces, switching on a String and a lot more. Surely, we will handle for some time, but what if some libraries we use in our apps start to use Java 8 features? As far as I know, this will not work (please correct me if wrong). This creates incompatibility between <em>Standard</em>-Java and <em>Android</em>-Java. It cannot be what Google intends, or at least I can't think of a reason why a company, developing a widely adopted operating system, would wan't to permanently stay with an <em>old</em> Java version.</p>

<p>Questions to you:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Why do they use Apache Harmony?</li>
<li>Why can't they adopt a newer version of java?</li>
<li>If they don't want Oracle's Java, why can't they use a subset of <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/"">OpenJDK</a> (licensing noob here)?</li>
<li>Do you know of any plans to update the used Java version?</li>
<li>Do you know of any way to use Java 8 classes on current Android systems?</li>

I have a few questions about parsing SO RSS feeds.</p>

<p>I've chosen to use <strong>RSS.NET</strong> to parse the RSS, but I have a few questions about my code (which I have provided further down in this post). </p>

<hr>

<h2>My Questions:</h2>

<p>First of all, am I <strong>parsing those attributes correctly</strong>? I have a class named Question, which has those properties.</p>

<p>Next, how can I <strong>parse the <code>&lt;re:rank&gt;</code> RSS property</strong> (used for # of votes)? I'm not sure how RSS.NET lets us do that. As far as I understand, it's a element with a custom namespace. </p>

<p>Finally, do I have to add all the properties manually, like currently in my code? Is their some sort of <strong>deserialization</strong> that I can use?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Code:</h2>

<p>Below is my current code for parsing recent question feeds: </p>

<pre><code>   /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Utilises recent question feeds to obtain recently updated questions on a certain site.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;

        RssChannel channel = (RssChannel)feed.Channels[0];
        foreach (RssItem item in channel.Items)

            &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I want to calculate the average of a set of angles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know it has been discussed before (several times). The accepted answer was &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Compute unit vectors from the angles and take the angle of their average&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However this answer defines the average in a non intuitive way. The average of 0, 0 and 90 will be &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;atan( (sin(0)+sin(0)+sin(90)) / (cos(0)+cos(0)+cos(90)) ) = atan(1/2)= 26.56 deg&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would expect the average of 0, 0 and 90 to be 30 degrees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I think it is fair to ask the question again: How would you calculate the average, so such examples will give the intuitive expected answer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

        &lt;/summary&gt;

Since the RNG is for an embedded system, there is no initial entropy from the system hence the error. (<a href=""https://polarssl.org/kb/how-to/add-entropy-sources-to-entropy-pool"" rel=""nofollow"">LINK</a>) I get no errors when I try out the same RNG on other standard OS's like Windows. Here is some of the code pertinent to it. </p>

<pre><code>    // Global Variables.
ctr_drbg_context ctx;
entropy_context etx;

// Inside Main
entropy_init( &amp;etx );
// Add entropy sources

// Initializing CTR_DRBG
printf(""Before ctrdrbg: %d"", err);
err = ctr_drbg_init( &amp;ctx, entropy_func, &amp;etx,  (const unsigned char *) ""RANDOM_GEN"", 10 );
if( err != 0 )
{
   printf(""Failed in ctr_drbg init!: %d"", err);
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 
<code>Error on Ctr_drbg init: -52</code></p>

<p>I have pored over this for about a week now with no headway. Almost giving up!! Anybody out there willing to help? </p>

I think the use case is really good, but the problem is that if I would replay every event one by one it would take to much time to build up the graph. So what's the best to rebuild a graph from ~1.000.000 events? The resulting graph is approx. 100.000 nodes and a lot of relations. The first naive attempt was to do it one by one but it takes way to much time since this is something that we might want to do more than one time. </p>

<p>Is the best approach to build an inmemory list of all nodes and then build a large cypher query for all nodes and one for the relationships? Or is the best way to use the batch API?</p>

<p>In an ideal situation the logic for rebuilding should be the same as when I handle the event one by one but for live handling a ""commit"" should be done after each event.</p>

<p>When I add or remove associations, new associations(rows) are created in the table, which is fine.

<p>Background: whenever I connect a new ""Teensy 3.1"" (Arduino-compatible ARM Coretex-M4 board) to a Windows 7 computer via USB, it triggers the Windows ""Found New Hardware"" Wizard and a USB enumeration process and search for drivers ensues, taking often > 10 seconds during which the USB device is blocked from user software.

<p>I managed to get jstree's <em>rename</em> context menu item to ""work"", meaning: I bound an ajax call to the jstree rename event, so when the user renames a node, it tells a WCF method to update the database (to ""save"" the new name).</p>

<p><strong>Problem: If I go to another page and then come back later, the node has reverted to the old name!</strong></p>

<p>It looks like there is some kind of caching going on, either in jstree or the browser, or WCF, and the tree isn't being refreshed somehow.</p>

<p>The data is coming from a database via a WCF service method over JSON. When you first visit the page, the data is loaded. But when you come <em>back</em> to the page, it isn't: the breakpoint in the server-side load method is never hit. It seems likely to me that either:</p>

<ul>
<li>jstree has cached the data and doesn't try to load it again (but why doesn't it stay renamed?) </li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>jstree asks the service, but WCF just gives the same data again from a cache rather than actually running the service method. </li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>The browser is caching the request and giving the same result back to jstree without calling the WCF method.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    CAShapeLayer *mask = [[[CAShapeLayer alloc] init] autorelease];

    mask.fillColor = [[UIColor blackColor] CGColor];

    CGFloat height = self.triangleView.frame.size.height;

    CGMutablePathRef path = CGPathCreateMutable();

    // draw the triangle
    CGPathMoveToPoint(path, NULL, 0, height);
    CGPathAddLineToPoint(path, NULL, width, 0);
    CGPathAddLineToPoint(path, NULL, width, height);
    CGPathCloseSubpath(path);

    mask.path = path;
    CGPathRelease(path);

    self.triangleView.layer.mask = mask;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works so far, cause I now have an table view shaped like a triangle. But I now have the problem, that I can't scroll the table view. The superview doesn't route the touches to the table view inside. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I'm working on a XNA game and I'm trying to make this work there. <code>Activator.CreateInstance</code> is available but than I need a default constructor, what's ugly.</p>

<p>I thought of if there is no default constructor, I take the shortest and pass in any values (for example when it requires an <code>int</code> and an <code>object</code>, I pass in <code>0</code> and <code>null</code>).
But the problem on that is that the constructor could throw an exception if it works with the objects passed in. Well I still could write it in a try catch block and maybe it works that way. But I really unlikely would do that. Is there any other solution?</p>

<p>What I am in the process of doing is implementing a staging area - somewhere where I can make changes to these websites without affecting the live site. So, I've duplicated the table structure with the intent of editing the duplicates, and pushing changes to the live version when the changes are ready. I would like to do this push in one stored procedure, but I can't figure out how to maintain the relationship between the subjects and their questions.</p>

<p>The website has identifying features other than its ID, so it's easy enough to find the live version of the site, and update its information, and even to transfer that website's subjects from the staging tables to the live tables.</p>

<p>Here is some pseudocode for what my plan is for the push:</p>

<pre><code>-- pass in the ID of the staging website
-- get the ID of the live website
-- update live website data from staging website data
    -- this is a strict update - if there is a staging version, there will necessarily be a live version
-- delete all live subjects
-- delete all live questions
-- copy subjects from staging to live
-- copy questions from staging to live
</code></pre>

<p>Note that subjects and questions may be added or removed, in addition to being edited (thus, deleting and reinserting seems the best course of action).</p>

<p>I've been able to write actual code for most of this, as it's relatively simple. But figuring out how to maintain the relationship between the subjects and the questions has been a problem. If I were doing this in a server-side scripting language, I would do something like this (again, pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>for each subject
    copy information from staging subject to live subject
    get id of new live subject
    for each question in this subject
        copy information from staging to live, setting subject ID to new live ID
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, I'd like to keep this all in the same stored procedure. If this is not possible, then I'll obviously go for the above version, but for efficiency's sake, I'd rather not have several database hits.</p>

<p>when you first go to the website on CMSMS the embedded font shows, but when you switch pages it gets stuck on arial.

"32548602","1","","","2015-09-13 10:17:16","","0","24","<p>I am creating tones in my Java-program.
So there is a number of oscillator modules which produce the samples I need so that I can play more than one tone at a time. These samples are added and played. 
If I select a low amplitude, e.g. 100, everything works fine (normalized it in Audacity):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/fmh4aMv.png?1"" alt=""Sinus""></p>

<p>But if I select a higher amplitude, in this case Short.MAX_VALUE, the created tone looks and sounds strange:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/E4inOjs.png"" alt=""Sinus2""></p>

<p>The samples are created here (source: <a href=""http://www.wolinlabs.com/blog/java.sine.wave.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolinlabs.com/blog/java.sine.wave.html</a>):</p>

<pre><code>    short value;
    if (type == TYPE_SINE)
    {
        cycleIncrease = frequency / parent.getSamplingRate();
        value = (short) (amplitude * Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * cyclePosition));
        cyclePosition += cycleIncrease;
        if (cyclePosition &gt; 1)
            cyclePosition -= 1; 
        return value;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>With sawtooth waves I have the same problem: </p>

<pre><code>    else if (type == TYPE_SAW)
    {
        cycleIncrease = frequency / parent.getSamplingRate();
        double doubleValue = cyclePosition - Math.floor(cyclePosition);
        cyclePosition += cycleIncrease;
        value = (short) (amplitude * doubleValue);
        if (cyclePosition &gt; 1)
            cyclePosition -= 1; 
        return value;
    }
</code></pre>

<p><code>amplitude</code> has the value I mentioned above, so in these two cases <code>100</code> and <code>Short.MAX_VALUE</code>.</p>

<p>The samples are summed up in this way, where <code>sum</code> is the output sample and <code>value</code> is the calculated sample (0 if no tone is played):</p>

<pre><code>    int n = 0;
    int sum = 0;

    for (Wire inputWire:inputWires)
    {
        short value = inputWire.getNextSample();
        if (value != 0)
        {
            n += 1;
        }
        sum += value;
        x++;
    }

    if (n != 0)
        sum = sum / n;
</code></pre>

<p>I also made sure that there is just the one sample from one oscillator if just one tone is played, so <code>sum = value</code>.</p>

<p>But I don't understand why different tones are created for different amplitudes with the same code, so why is this happening?</p>

<p>I also have a second question: If I end playing a sine tone with low amplitude, I can hear a short noise, which looks like this: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/LzC8rue.png"" alt=""noise""></p>

<p>Where does this come from and how can I fix it?</p>

So the class MovableObject has the updated coordinates but since I'm calling it from Car it's not getting the right coordinates to the moving car. I need to pass the variables from <code>move()</code> to more than one class also, that should be the same since the Iterator takes care of what is updated right or is this way very complicated? </p>

<p>I am trying to add a has_and_belongs_to_many association only to some instances of my User model. Here is the relevant part of the code:</p>

<p>In my User Model:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  ...
  after_initialize :setup_trainer

  def setup_trainer
    return true unless trainer?
    self.class.instance_eval {include TrainerMethods}
  end

  module TrainerMethods

    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    included do
      has_and_belongs_to_many :trainings
    end

  end
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then in my Training Model:</p>

<pre><code>class Training &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :trainers, class_name: ""User""
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is only one of the several techniques I tried and the issue here is that not just trainers but every User is added the habtm association.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can add the habtm association only to trainers? </p>

<p>UPDATE: 
If I simply add the association to the User model as suggested. both regualar users and trainers that don't have trainings would return [] 
Do you think this is fine and in case we need to clarify what kind of user we are looking at we call the @user.trainer? method?</p>

<p>Thank you very very much.</p>

<p>There is a custom memory manager that uses memory mapped files to achieve reading of such a huge data. The files are mapped into the process memory space only when needed and with this the process memory is well under control. But what is observed is, with memory mapping, the system cache keeps on increasing until it occupies the available physical memory. This leads to the slowing down of the entire system.</p>

<p>My question is how to prevent system cache from hogging the physical memory? I attempted to remove the file buffering (by using FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING ), but with this, the read operations take considerable amount of time and slows down the application performance. How to achieve the scalability without sacrificing much on performance. What are the common techniques used in such cases?</p>

<p>With regards to character classes, comparison, sorting, normalization and collations, what Unicode version or versions are supported by which .NET platforms?</p>

<p><strong>Original question</strong></p>

<p>I remember somewhat vaguely having read that .NET supported Unicode version 3.0 and that the internal UTF-16 encoding is not really UTF-16 but actually uses UCS-2, which is not the same. It seems, for instance, that characters above U+FFFF are not possible, i.e. consider:</p>

<pre><code>string s = ""\u1D7D9""; // (""Mathematical double-struck digit one"") 
</code></pre>

<p>and it stores the string <code>""ᵽ9""</code>.</p>

<p>I'm basically looking for definitive references of answers to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>If it isn't true UTF-16 in .NET, what is it?</li>
<li>What version of Unicode is supported by .NET?</li>
<li>If recent versions are not supported or planned in the near future, does anybody know of a (non)commercial library or how I can workaround this issue?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>¹) I updated the question as with passing time, it seems more appropriate with respect to the answers and to the larger community. I left the original question in place of which parts have been answered in the comments. Also the old UCS-2 (no surrogates) was used in now-ancient 32 bit Windows versions, .NET has always used UTF-16 (with surrogates) internally.</p>

Then I want to take that set of 8 frames and put them into a larger array to store all the frames from the beginning of recording (so I can rewind and look at previous frames).   </p>

<pre><code>tmp_vis = [0]*8
frame_tracker = []

while True:
  for i in xrange(8):
     rets, frame = cap[i].read()
     try:
       tmp_vis[i] = cv2.resize(frame, (self.w, self.h))
     except:
       continue

  print ""\nbreak""

  frame_tracker.append(tmp_vis)

  print hashlib.sha1(frame_tracker[0][0].view(np.uint8)).hexdigest()

  if len(frame_tracker) &gt; 1:

  if len(frame_tracker) &gt; 2:
    print hashlib.sha1(frame_tracker[2][0].view(np.uint8)).hexdigest() 
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I go back to look at previous frames they appear to just be the last set of 8 frames that I appended. So what I expect to see is something like:</p>

<pre><code>break

<p>Instead what I see is:</p>

67bb20b6ad6c14bc99e9f27456d9ec898a1e0eeb
</code></pre>

<p>Now I assume this falls into a mutable default value issue and I've looked at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1132941/least-astonishment-in-python-the-mutable-default-argument"">“Least Astonishment” in Python: The Mutable Default Argument</a> but was unable to figure out a solution.  The help is greatly appreciated.  I've tried to prune the code to the needed stuff, but let me know if I've pruned too much.</p>

<p>The need is to have an infinit number of content items (loaded from a server), showing exactly two at a time. As the user advances through the list of items, they appear to scroll to the left with new items transitioning in from the right pushing the current items to the left. </p>

<p>the items should get their width according to the current responsive layout. </p>

<p>The general idea is to have viewport which is a part of the page layout and can accept any width stated in <code>px</code> or in <code>%</code>, a container which gets <code>width: 100%</code> so that it fill the size of the viewport. and items which are arranged horizontally side by side without wrapping, the items get a width of 50% so exactly two items fit into the container/viewport and the rest of the items overflow (and are hidden.) </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""viewport""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""container""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""item""&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""item""&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;!-- more items get loaded as the user advances through the content --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>""scrolling"" is achieved by setting a negative margin on the first item - which this technique i can always set a negative margin which is: &lt;<em>number of items</em>> * 50%</p>

<p>I got this mostly working in the following jsfiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/gZBEV/5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/gZBEV/5/</a>
The items are arranged correctly and they get their width according to the width of the surrounding viewport. (use the buttons to emulate moving/scrolling through the items)</p>

<p>The problem is a horizontal gap (shown by the arrow) which appears between each item which screws up the layout. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eOQ1E.png"" alt=""The problem""></p>

<p>The solution to this would be to find a way were the items have no horizontal gap between them like so:</p>

<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>

<p>I'm using VS2013 and used NUGET to download EF 6.0.2, but when I
    look at EF in the references area is tells me it's still Version
    4.0....</p>

<p>My system has both SQL Server 2012 and 2014 (Local DB) installed.  This must be root cause of issue.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Visual Studio 2013, EF 6.0.1 and SQL Express 2012 do not work well together when using Code First.  The problem is the MDF file is generated but any attempt to connect using the Server Explorer Data Connections fails with the 782 error message above as well as in SSMS for SQL 2012.  Even if your system does not have SQL 2014 installed the MDF file version thinks it is a 2014 file version!</p>

<p>If you delete an MDF file (as I did and subsequent) attempts to create MDF fail (Cannot Attach File error), then simply rename the DBContext class name and you will get a new MDF file!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I have tried taking the min and max datetime value from each of the DataFrames and putting them into a new DataFrame but when I try and plot them I get an error that there are no values to plot.</p>

<p>I have also tried to taking just the 'Time' column, and assigning an Integer to a 'value' column (i.e. sensor 1 get's the Int 1 broadcast to the 'value' column, sensor2 get's the Int 2 broadcast and so on), then merging these DataFrames.</p>

<p>But this results in lots of duplicate values in the 'Time' column and Nan values in the 'value' column.</p>

<p>I have run out of ideas of how to get this to work.</p>

<p>So, i am asking if anyone knows a better solution for my Problem.</p>

<p><strong>Here is what should happen:</strong></p>

<p>I got a private Object <strong>(foo)</strong> with many private Methods which returns an Object with the public Methods:</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    foo = function(){
        var prop1,
            prop2;
        private1 = function(){}
        private2 = function(){}
        return{
            bar: function(){},
            bar2: function(){}
        }
    }
}(this));
</code></pre>

<p>It has to be that way, so that many instances with diffrent properties of this Object can be constructed. </p>

<pre><code>var Foo = new foo();
var Foo2 = new foo();
</code></pre>

<p>Next, i got a public Method within this Object which contains an asynchronous function and calls an given callback</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    foo = function(){
        // Here are Private Functions within this Object
        return{
            bar: function(callback){
                if(typeof callback === ""function"") callback();
            },
            bar2: function(){}
        }
    }
}(this));
</code></pre>

<p>In this callback it is possible that a <strong>Method of the same Object gets called</strong> where something different should happen then just calling the function.</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    foo = function(){
        // Here are Private Functions within this Object
        return{
            bar: function(callback){
                if(typeof callback === ""function""){
                    //if(callback !== foo.methods){
                    //if(!(callback instanceof foo))
                        callback();
                    //}
                }
            },
            bar2: function(){}
        }
    }
}(this));


var Foo = new foo();
var Foo2 = new foo();

Foo.bar(function(){
    alert('!');     //Should be executed
}); 

Foo.bar(function(){
    Foo2.bar()      //Should be executed
}); 

Foo.bar(function(){
    Foo.bar()       //Should Not be executed
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>Yesterday i thought comparing the function names (arguments[0] or with this.constructor.name) would be the easiest. but since the callback is an isolated scoped function in the most cases <code>foo(function(){bar();});</code> it isn't going to work!</p>

<p>Then after i asked the community here for help i got a way to look after the Argument via RegExp. But since it can't differentiate from the different instances of this object and would require a lot of Regular Expressions i think its the best to ask you guys for help.</p>

<p><em>As i wrote this the idea came into my mind of giving every constructed Object an Unique ID which is accessable public.</em> </p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    foo = function(){
        var id =123;
        // Here are Private Functions within this Object
        return{
            bar: function(callback){
                if(typeof callback === ""function""){
                    if(callback.id() !== this.id){
                        console.log(callback); &lt;========== This would return function (){alert('!');}
                        callback();
                    }
                }
            },
            bar2: function(){},
            id: function(){return id;}
        }
    }
}(this));
var Foo = new foo();
Foo.bar(function(){
    alert('!');
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>But this would require a method of iterating throught every function within the function callback and checking the method id of every statement within the function. I don't know if this would be possible...</p>

<p>Maybe you guys have some tips for me. Maybe I'm overthinking it...</p>

<p>It does not appear to work. Even if you attempt to view the page's source, it will not work. It is simply the source code of a webpage which says that the page does not exist.

<p>Here is the code I am using:</p>

<p>I have the following LINQ query:</p>

<pre><code>return (from sp in context.ServiceProviders.DefaultIfEmpty()
    join pl in context.Platforms on sp.Id equals pl.ServiceProviderId into innerPl
    from pl in innerPl.DefaultIfEmpty()
    join pp in context.Participants on pl.Id equals pp.PlatformId into innerPp
    from pp in innerPp.DefaultIfEmpty()
    join ps in context.Paymentsettlements on pp.Id equals ps.ParticipantId into innerPs
    from ps in innerPs.Where(ps =&gt; ps.ConfirmedOn.HasValue &amp;&amp; ps.ExportDate.HasValue &amp;&amp; !ps.StatisticsDate.HasValue).DefaultIfEmpty()
    select sp).Include(sp =&gt; sp.Environment)
                .Include(sp =&gt; sp.Platforms.Select(pl =&gt; pl.Participants.Select(pp =&gt; pp.Paymentsettlements.Select(ps =&gt; ps.Requester))))
                .Include(sp =&gt; sp.Platforms.Select(pl =&gt; pl.Participants.Select(pp =&gt; pp.Paymentsettlements.Select(ps =&gt; ps.Payer))))
                .ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>The result i'm looking for is that i always get the ServiceProvider no matter if there are objects inside the ServiceProvider. I am getting this result at the moment, but the where I've put in the query does not get taken into account. The following where does not make any difference:</p>

<pre><code>innerPs.Where(ps =&gt; ps.ConfirmedOn.HasValue &amp;&amp; ps.ExportDate.HasValue &amp;&amp; !ps.StatisticsDate.HasValue).DefaultIfEmpty()
</code></pre>

<p>If the StatisticsDate has a value, those Paymentsettlements also are given in the output.</p>

<p>I've already tried to put the WHERE statement on the context.Paymentsettlements object.</p>

<p>I hope anyone can help me with this problem.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<pre><code>nohup process &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>It will continue to run after I close my bash session. I cannot seem to do the same with PowerShell remoting on Windows. I can open a PSRemote session with a server and start a process, but as soon as I close that session it dies. My assumption is this is a benefit of strong sandboxing, but it's a benefit I'd rather work around somehow. Any ideas? </p>

<p>So far I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>$exe ='d:\procdump.exe'
$processArgs = '-ma -e -t -n 3 -accepteula w3wp.exe d:\Dumps'
1) [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($exe,$processArgs)
2) Start-Job -ScriptBlock {param($exe,$processArgs) [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($exe,$processArgs)} -ArgumentList ($exe,$processArgs)
3) start powershell {param($exe ='d:\procdump.exe', $processArgs = '-ma -e -t -n 3 -accepteula w3wp.exe d:\Dumps') [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($exe,$processArgs)}
4) start powershell {param($exe ='d:\procdump.exe', $processArgs = '-ma -e -t -n 3 -accepteula w3wp.exe d:\Dumps') Start-Job -ScriptBlock {param($exe,$processArgs) [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($exe,$processArgs)} -ArgumentList ($exe,$processArgs)}
</code></pre>

<p>The program runs up until I close the session, then the procdump is reaped. The coolest thing about procdump is it will self-terminate, and I'd like to leave it running to take advantage of that fact. </p>

<p>I'd been starting ADPlus remotely, holding a session open, and just terminating the session to kill the captures. That's kind of handy, but it requires an awful lot of polling, inspecting, and deciding when is the right moment to kill the capture process before filling up the hard drive but after capturing enough dumps to be useful. I can leave procdump running indefinitely while it waits for an appropriate trigger and when it's captured enough data it will just die. That's lovely. </p>

<p>I just need to get procdump to keep running after I terminate my remote session. It's probably not worth creating a procdump scheduled task and starting it, but that's about the last idea I've got left. </p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>I know basics of jquery but I am no expert.</p>

<p>Anyway I have built a booking system, when someone clicks a date it opens up a form which is created using php and pulled in using ajax.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is sending this form after it has been pulled using ajax and then sending it through ajax to another page to be checked and then accepted or rejected depending on checks of the form submittion.</p>

<p>Here is the html form which has been generated using php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""bookingform"" method=""post""&gt;

&lt;label class=""bookinglabel"" for=""hour-9""&gt;9:00am - 10:00am&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;select id=""hour-9"" name=""hour-9"" for=""hour-9""&gt;

    &lt;option value=""null""&gt;Please Select&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""1""&gt;Book A Slot For 1 Person&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""2""&gt;Book A Slot For 2 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""3""&gt;Book A Slot For 3 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""4""&gt;Book A Slot For 4 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""5""&gt;Book A Slot For 5 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""6""&gt;Book A Slot For 6 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""7""&gt;Book A Slot For 7 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""8""&gt;Book A Slot For 8 People&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;label class=""bookinglabel"" for=""hour-10""&gt;10:00am - 11:00am&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;select id=""hour-10"" name=""hour-10"" for=""hour-10""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""null""&gt;Please Select&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""1""&gt;Book A Slot For 1 Person&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""2""&gt;Book A Slot For 2 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""3""&gt;Book A Slot For 3 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""4""&gt;Book A Slot For 4 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""5""&gt;Book A Slot For 5 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""6""&gt;Book A Slot For 6 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""7""&gt;Book A Slot For 7 People&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""8""&gt;Book A Slot For 8 People&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;button type=""submit"" class=""ajaxsubmit1""&gt;Proceed&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the jquery section to the form which originally calls in the date and then tries to submit the form.</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function(){

    jQuery('.ajaxbooking').on('click', function(event){

        event.preventDefault();

        var selecteddate = jQuery(this).attr('data-date');
        var url = 'http://localhost:8888/booking.php';
        var winh = jQuery(window).height();

        jQuery.ajax({url: url  + '?date=' + selecteddate}).done(function(data) {
            jQuery('.ubl-booking-ajax').html(data);
            jQuery('.ubl-booking-ajax').animate({marginRight: ""0px""}, 700 );
            jQuery('.ubl-portfolio-button').fadeIn(700);
        });

        return false;

    });

    jQuery('.ubl-portfolio-button').on('click',function(event){

        event.preventDefault();

        jQuery('.ubl-booking-ajax').animate({marginRight: ""-100%""}, 700 );
        jQuery('.ubl-portfolio-button').fadeOut(300);

        return false;

    });

    jQuery(""#bookingform"").submit(function(e){

        e.preventDefault();
        alert('this has worked');


    });

});

<p>Obviously I am just alerted to see if it works, which it does not.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction</p>

<p>I'm building a MATLAB library (which is to be used in a Windows Phone Application), which takes in an edge map of a natural image as input. I need to traverse the map row-wise. If I come across an edge, I need to find the local minimum and local maximum of the edge. </p>

1) traverse the edge map - row-wise

To achieve optimal performance during jobs, I have the cluster remap its data each time a child enters or exits. This will eventually be made optional, but for now it performs its data balancing by default. My balancing is basically just making sure that each child never has more than the average number of files per machine, plus one. The plus one is for the remainder if the division isn't clean. And since the remainder will <em>always</em> be less than the number of children [except 0 case, but we can exclude that], children after a balancing will have at most avg + 1.</p>

<p>Everything seems fine, until I realized my algorithm is O(n!). Go down the list of children, find out the avg, remainder, who has too many and who has too few. For each child in the too many list, go through list, send to each child who has too few.</p>

<p>Is there a better solution to this? I feel there must be.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is some psuedocode to show how i derived O(n!):</p>

<pre><code>foreach ( child in children ) {
    if ( child.dataLoad &gt; avg + 1 ) {
        foreach ( child2 in children ) {
            if ( child != child2 &amp;&amp; child2.dataLoad &lt; avg ) {
                sendLoad(child, child2)
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: O(n^2). Foreach n, n => n*n => n^2. I guess I didn't have enough coffee this morning! ;)</p>

<p>In the future I'd like to move to a more flexible and resilient distribution method[weights and hueristics], but for now, a uniform distribution of data works.</p>

I've got here pretty standard scenario: trying to create EAR application with separated modules which are in this case only EJB (jar) and Web app (war).</p>

<p>I's all base on Maven, build and deployment work fine so I won't post (those long) pom files yet. WildFly 8.1.0 FINAL is used as application server.</p>

<p>EJB Module contains just one stateless bean:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
public class Greeter implements GreetinInterface {

    private final String[] greets = new String[]{""Hi"", ""Ho"", ""Hey"", ""Hello""};

    @Override
    public String greet() {
        return greets[new Random().nextInt(greets.length)];
    }
}

@Local
public interface GreetinInterface {

    String greet();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Bean gets deployed successfully which is confirmed by both the WildFly admin console and following output:</p>

<pre><code>21:50:20,275 INFO  [org.jboss.as.ejb3.deployment.processors.EjbJndiBindingsDeploymentUnitProcessor] (MSC service thread 1-6) JNDI bindings for session bean named Greeter in deployment unit subdeployment ""WEBModule.war"" of deployment ""EARModule.ear"" are as follows:

    java:global/EARModule/WEBModule/Greeter!cz.kousalik.GreetingInterface
    java:app/WEBModule/Greeter!cz.kousalik.GreetingInterface
    java:module/Greeter!cz.kousalik.GreetingInterface
    java:global/EARModule/WEBModule/Greeter
    java:app/WEBModule/Greeter
    java:module/Greeter
</code></pre>

<p>WEB module contains simple Vaadin application generated by Vaadin plugin in netbeans. Contains only one UI, with one Button:</p>

<pre><code>    @CDIUI
    @Theme(""mytheme"")
    @Widgetset(""cz.kousalik.pernik.web.MyAppWidgetset"")
    public class MyUI extends UI {

        @Inject
        private GreetinInterface greeter;

        @Override
        protected void init(VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
            final VerticalLayout layout = new VerticalLayout();
            layout.setMargin(true);
            setContent(layout);

            Button button = new Button(""Click Me"");
            button.addClickListener(e -&gt; layout.addComponent(new Label(""Thank you for clicking, "" + greeter.greet())));
            layout.addComponent(button);
  }

    @WebServlet(urlPatterns = ""/*"", name = ""MyUIServlet"", asyncSupported = true)
    @VaadinServletConfiguration(ui = MyUI.class, productionMode = false)
    public static class MyUIServlet extends VaadinServlet {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this situation the application runs, but clicking the Button results in Nullpointer exception, because there is nothing injected inside <code>greeter</code> field.</p>

<p>After reading through several tutorials I believe the problem is in the servlet part of my UI class. Vaadin CDI tutorial is saying that deleting this part should do the trick. However if I do so I can't access the webapp at all and am just getting <code>Forbidden</code>.</p>

<p>Could someone help and what would be even better explain how this is supposed to work together? All the tutorials are unfortunately lacking more background information.</p>

<pre><code>Foo::app()-&gt;data['a'] = 'newdata'; // &lt;-- this doesn't work, but it's what I would like to do...

<p>(Basically, add a WPF User Control project to your Winform solution. Drag and drop whatever WPF control. I chose a DevExpress WPF MapControl, but Microsoft's variant or any other control works just as nicely. Build the project once, and then drag and drop the control which then appears onto your Winform project. If you wish to set/get any properties or expose any methods, you would go to the associated C# code behind and make that public.)</p>

<p>Problem:
I want to create a method, which would have two GeoPoint arguments (longitude / latitude pairs). The method would then show the best route using BingMaps or the OpenMapDocs to show the route from point A to B, think Google Maps. I would call this method from a button or link on the Winform side.</p>

<p>Now, I understand crystal clear how to implement the transition and method. Been there, done that, so to speak. I have the two GeoPoint longitude/latitude pairs inside the code behind for the control.</p>

<p>My problem is how to handle the XAML side. I am not that familiar with WPF yet and the XAML side.</p>

<p>DevExpress said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is necessary to configure the route data service inside the XAML user control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was not the most helpful.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I am using .Net 4.5.</p>

<p>Here is the XAML code for the DevExpress MapControl. The question is identical to the Microsoft MapControl. Both codes share very similar XAML, at least from my visual looking at it.</p>

<p>It seems like AFNetworking is not cancelling the request when the cell moves off screen and reappears in a different position.

<p>For instance every guide I've seen online just show how to create a basic route:</p>

<pre><code>yo angular:route myRoute
</code></pre>

<p>I tried the explicit URI setting as detailed <a href=""https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#route"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#route</a>.</p>

<pre><code>yo angular:route myRouteTwo --uri=my/routetwo
</code></pre>

<p>But this does not appear to work. How then, does this scaffolding tool go about creating routes for deeper resources such as:</p>

<p>/games/:game/levels</p>

<p>At the moment it seems this is not possible.</p>

I am trying to output the values of a SQL result set, but the foreach loop appears to be iterating twice, then incrementing the array index.

<pre><code>mysqli_query(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE Name=$name"");
</code></pre>

<p>It opens up an incredible number of stupid mistakes like above, encouraging SQL injection. It's basically <code>exec</code> for SQL, and <code>exec</code>'ing code, especially dynamically generated, is widely discouraged.
Plus, to be honest, prepared statements seem like just a verbose workaround.</p>

<p>Why don't we have a more object-oriented, noninjectable way of doing it, like having a directly-accessible database object with certain methods:</p>

<pre><code>$DB-&gt;setDB(""mysite"");
$table='users';
$col='username';
$DB-&gt;selectWhereEquals($table,$col,$name);

<p>Which the database itself <em>natively</em> implements, completely eliminating all resemblance to <code>exec</code> and nullifying the entire basis of SQL injection.</p>

Would you use the same structure for all I/O ports of your blocks to facilitate their interconnection (but obviously there will be a lot of redundant signals) or would you define custom structures for each I/O port type with only the necessary information?</p>

<p>For example:
A reactor is modeled as a single block with 4 inputs and 1 output:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I1. Feed which is a structure containing: Flow and Concentrations (7 species);</p></li>
<li><p>I2. Mass flow of enzymes - scalar;</p></li>
<li><p>I3. Mass flow of water - scalar;</p></li>
<li><p>I4. Outflow - which is adjusted by a controller to keep a constant mass in the tank - scalar;</p></li>
<li><p>O1. The outstream, which is a struct: Flow and Concentrations
(let's say 10 species).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now imagine this reactor block is only a tiny piece of an entire process. There are enzymes and water tanks connected to it and some other downstream processes etc.</p>

<p>Would you use a unique structure for all IO ports (even if it scales up to 50-100 components but you would need less per block or 1 component like I2, I3 and I4 above which are scalars)? Is this regarded as bad programming practice?</p>

<p>Or would you customize the IO port structure for each block? Of course you would group them somehow and make reuse of them but with no redundant information.</p>

<pre><code>//in Handle.h file
class Body;

class Handle
{
   public:
      Handle();
      ~Handle() {delete impl_;}
   //....
   private:

#include ""Handle.h""

//... in some function... 
{
    Handle handleObj;

    //Do smtg with handleObj...

    //handleObj now reaches end-of-life, and BUM: Undefined behaviour
} 
</code></pre>

<p>I understand from the standard that this case is headed towards UB since Body's destructor is non trivial.
What I'm trying to understand is really the root cause of this.</p>

<p>I mean, the problem seems to be ""triggered"" by the fact that Handle's dtor is inline, and so the compiler does something like the following ""inline expansion"" (almost pseudo-code here).</p>

<pre><code>inline Handle::~Handle()
{
     impl_-&gt;~Body();
     operator delete (impl_);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In all translation units (only <code>Handle_user.cpp</code> in this case) where a Handle instance gets to be destroyed, right?
I just can't understand this: ok, when generating the above inline expansion the compiler doesn't have a full definition of the Body class, but why cannot it simply have the linker resolve for the <code>impl_-&gt;~Body()</code> thing and so have it call the Body's destructor function that's actually defined in its implementation file?</p>

<p>In other words: I understand that at the point of Handle destruction the compiler doesn't even know if a (non-trivial) destructor exists or not for Body, but why can't it do as it always does, that is leave a ""placeholder"" for the linker to fill in, and eventually have a linker ""unresolved external"" if that function is really not available?</p>

<p>Am I missing something big here (and in that case sorry for the stupid question)?
If that's not the case, I'm just curious to understand the rationale behind this.</p>

<pre><code>declare @TableInQuestion nvarchar(150)
declare @ConstraintInQuestion nvarchar(150)
declare MyConstraintToDisable cursor
    local static read_only forward_only
for
    SELECT        OBJECT_NAME(sys.objects.object_id) AS ConstraintName, 
                  OBJECT_NAME(sys.objects.parent_object_id) AS TableName
    FROM          sys.objects INNER JOIN
                  MyTableList 
    ON            OBJECT_NAME(sys.objects.parent_object_id) = MyTableList.Description
    WHERE         (sys.objects.type_desc LIKE '%CONSTRAINT') 

open MyConstraintToDisable
fetch next from MyConstraintToDisable
into @ConstraintInQuestion, @TableInQuestion
while @@FETCH_STATUS=0
begin
   print @ConstraintInQuestion+', '+ @TableInQuestion 
   alter table @TableInQuestion nocheck constraint @ConstraintInQuestion
   print 'Done'
   fetch next from MyConstraintToDisable
   into @ConstraintInQuestion, @TableInQuestion
end
close MyConstraintToDisable
deallocate MyConstraintToDisable
</code></pre>

<p>It kept saying that the syntax alter table is not correct. Please help. I am a rookie in sql programming.</p>

I have a strange problem: I wrote a server and client in c# based on .net2 which are chatting over the .net 2 SslStream. There is 1 Connection for sending commands between Cl and S and theres one connection for sending files between cl and s.<br>
Locally all is working fine on my windows machine. But if I run the server on my Linux server(with mono), sharing files doesnt work in certain situations. I have different Categories for files, and in 2 of 3 its working, in the third, the server hangs on <code>SSLStream.AuthenticateAsServer(....);</code> and the client throws a Exception with the Message ""A Call to SSPI Failed, see inner exception"".
The innerexception is a System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception with the Message ""The message received was unexpected or badly formatted.""</p>

<p>I think that my way to run it on linux could be wrong. Actually Im using VS2012 for local developing and when I want to put it on the server I upload the compiled exe by VS and Im using <code>mono server.exe</code> to start it. But I also tried to use monodevelop on Windows to compile it(compiled stuff from monodevelop does also work locally) and use it on the linux server, but this ended in the same result.</p>

<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><br><br>
Heres my shortened Code:</p>

<p>Client:</p>

<pre><code>//gets auth guid before, then it does
Thread Thre = new Thread(sendfile);
Thre.Start(authguid);


private void sendfile(string guid){
TcpClient cl = new TcpClient();
cl.Connect(hostname, 8789);
SslStream Stream = new SslStream(cl.GetStream(), true, new RemoteCertificateValidationCallback(ServerConnector.ValidateServerCertificate));
Stream.AuthenticateAsClient(hostname);//throws the exception
//sends auth guid and file

Can someone explain in very few words the process of application development using WPF+MVVM pattern (using Catel) with database created with Entity Framework.
1. I create models (Code First) and generate database
2. I create View models via Catel base classes
3. I create Views with WPF</p>

<p>The question is: how to connect database with Catel View Models? Where to load DBContext and entities? Should I create repositories? Or maybe it's needed to create separate Models?
Is there a common way or maybe example of a small WPF application which uses database to store data?</p>

<p>Sorry if my question is slightly heretic - simply can't sort all the terms and approaches into a single system which I will follow during app creation...</p>

<p>I have a couple different places an object can be saved.  More specifically an object in one place and its children in another.</p>

<p>Object:</p>

<pre><code>[MagicalRecord saveWithBlock:^(NSManagedObjectContext *localContext) {
   NSLog(@""saving objects"");
   NSArray *objects = // fetch objects with localContext

   // change some data on objects
}];

<p>Children:</p>

<pre><code>[MagicalRecord saveWithBlock:^(NSManagedObjectContext *localContext) {
   NSLog(@""saving some children"");
   NSArray *children = // fetch objects with localContext

   // change some data on children
}];
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing really complex, just have a couple different places where I would like to make some modifications in background threads.</p>

<p>What is the right way when using MagicalRecord to specify the merge policy?  Do I just set it on each and every localContext?</p>

<pre><code>localContext.mergePolicy = // Whatever merge policy I want
</code></pre>

<p>Or should I be setting up a merge policy to be used across my application?  IE for now my merge policy is always going to be the same.  I know that could change, so I am sure the right answer is to set the merge policy for each and every localContext.</p>

<p>However I have not seen a lot of examples or questions about merge policies with MagicalRecord which really leaves me wondering.</p>

<p>For a simple text input, the browser usually ""remembers"" the user last inputs in the same fields.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/q8Pkd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Sometimes, for security reasons I suppose, some websites somehow prevent the input from remembering what the user typed. So I need to type my username every time I want to log into the website (double clicking the input field does not give me the dropdown list with the previously typed usernames).</p>

<p>Do you know if there's a HTML/JS property to prevent inputs from being remembered (under firefox), so I can override it and make the browser remember my input ?</p>

<p>What changes do I make so that the paragraph doesn't appear by default when the page first loads?</p>

<p>Also, is the mouse-over effect on the <code>div</code> tag or the <code>p</code> tag? I am a bit confused. Sorry, I am really new to all this.</p>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>I just made some changes, and it didn't display the paragraph when the page first loaded.</p>

<p>The following line was commented out.</p>

<p>// text.css({ position: 'absolute', top: '57px' }).hide();</p>

<p>Again is the mouse-over effect on <code>DIV</code> tag or <code>P</code> tag?</p>

<p>[EDIT 2]</p>

<p>Is the following line of code containing some function of jQuery or what?</p>

<pre><code>text.css({ position: 'absolute', top: '57px' }).hide();

<p>What is the ""text.css""?</p>

<p>It's a lot of work if you have many entities with many fields in them. Maybe it’s easier to modify every view. (As always)  </p>

<p>You could also do something like the following (of course with the css should be in a resource file): </p>

<pre><code>    --- create.jspx: ---
...
  &lt;style&gt;                          // ADD THIS
    .something                     // ADD THIS
    {                              // ADD THIS
      background-color:#b0c4de;    // ADD THIS
    }                              // ADD THIS
  &lt;/style&gt;                         // ADD THIS
&lt;form:create ...
    &lt;field:select ...
    &lt;field:select ...
    &lt;field:select ...
    &lt;div class=""something""&gt;        // ADD THIS
        &lt;field:input ...
        &lt;field:input ...
        &lt;field:input ...
        &lt;field:input ...
    &lt;/div&gt;                         // ADD THIS
...
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe there is a way to add a custom css class for all the odd fields, and another for all the even fields. Or maybe with a counter.</p>

<p>I know this doesn't sound feasible. I thought it's better to ask.</p>

<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>So, I set the SKU-attribute to 'Use for Promo Rule Conditions'->'Yes', and I create a rule like:</p>

<pre><code>If ALL  of these conditions are TRUE :
If an item is FOUND  in the cart with ANY  of these conditions true: 
SKU is ABC
</code></pre>

<p>but with no success...</p>

<p>So I read something about bundled products and price rules only being applied on simple products (is that so?), so I changed my rule so it applies to the products in my bundled product:</p>

<pre><code>If ALL  of these conditions are TRUE :
If an item is FOUND  in the cart with ANY  of these conditions true: 
SKU is one of ABC,ABC-1,ABC-2
</code></pre>

<p>No luck...</p>

<p>So I try to leave the whole SKU-thing, and I create a new attribute: give_discount, and set that also to 'Use for Promo Rule Conditions'->'Yes'. Yes, I'm that desperate at this point. I create the attribute, add it to my bundle as well as it's children products:</p>

<pre><code>If ALL  of these conditions are TRUE :
If an item is FOUND  in the cart with ANY  of these conditions true: 
Give discount  is  Yes 
</code></pre>

<p>Still... no... luck...</p>

<p>Now, does anyone know what's going on here? I just can't wrap my head around it! Are bundled products impossible to give discount to in this way? When I leave the conditions away, the discount gets given (as expected), but as soon as I apply the filter, I get the notion that the coupon code is not valid...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>My price rule works on other types of products. After some research I managed to get the code working by creating a hidden category, put the bundled product in it, and apply the price rule to the category. Is this the only way how something like above can be achieved?</p>

I have this copy of VS from school, but if my company ever wants to edit the msi after I'm gone, it will need to be on a freeware tool, so I'm migrating the installer project to WixEdit.</p>

<p>I finally got the xml to compile into an MSI, and it appeared to be working. However, after testing out a few of the features, I noticed the UI sequence is broken in one particular situation:</p>

<p>The installer browses for a file on the client's machine and if the file is found, a dialog called Custom_DirDataFound pops up. Otherwise (if the file is not found), a Custom_DirData dialog is shown. No matter what happens in these dialogs, the next dialog to pop up when 'next' is clicked should be Custom_NewInstall.</p>

<p>Both these dialogs move to the correct Custom_NewInstall dialog with the MSI I compiled in Visual Studio. However, in the WixEdit MSI, only Custom_DirDataFound will go to Custom_NewInstall when 'next' is pressed. Custom_DirData on the other hand will skip two dialogs and go straight to Custom_VerifyReadyDlg.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet of my main UI file (Custom_Mundo) that defines the Custom_DirData 'next' button events:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirData"" Control=""Next"" Event=""SetTargetPath"" Value=""DATALOCATION"" Order=""1""&gt;1&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirData"" Control=""Next"" Event=""DoAction"" Value=""WixUIValidatePath"" Order=""2""&gt;NOT WIXUI_DONTVALIDATEPATH&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirData"" Control=""Next"" Event=""SpawnDialog"" Value=""InvalidDirDlg"" Order=""3""&gt;&lt;![CDATA[NOT WIXUI_DONTVALIDATEPATH AND WIXUI_INSTALLDIR_VALID&lt;&gt;""1""]]&gt;&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirData"" Control=""Next"" Property=""COPY"" Value=""Yes""&gt;NOTFOUND = 0&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirData"" Control=""Next"" Event=""NewDialog"" Value=""Custom_NewInstall"" Order=""4""&gt;WIXUI_DONTVALIDATEPATH OR WIXUI_INSTALLDIR_VALID=""1""&lt;/Publish&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the Custom_DirDataFound entries for comparison:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirDataFound"" Control=""Next"" Event=""SetTargetPath"" Value=""DATALOCATION"" Order=""1""&gt;1&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirDataFound"" Control=""Next"" Event=""DoAction"" Value=""WixUIValidatePath"" Order=""2""&gt;NOT WIXUI_DONTVALIDATEPATH&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirDataFound"" Control=""Next"" Event=""SpawnDialog"" Value=""InvalidDirDlg"" Order=""3""&gt;&lt;![CDATA[NOT WIXUI_DONTVALIDATEPATH AND WIXUI_INSTALLDIR_VALID&lt;&gt;""1""]]&gt;&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirDataFound"" Control=""Next"" Event=""NewDialog"" Value=""Custom_NewInstall"" Order=""4""&gt;WIXUI_DONTVALIDATEPATH OR WIXUI_INSTALLDIR_VALID=""1""&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;Publish Dialog=""Custom_DirDataFound"" Control=""Next"" Property=""COPY"" Value=""Yes""&gt;FOUND = 0&lt;/Publish&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, Custom_NewInstall should clearly be spawned when next is pressed. This main UI file (Custom_Mundo) and Custom_DirData are identical to their equivalents in Visual Studio, yet their behaviour is different during install.</p>

<p>I ran a log file for both installers (VS and WixEdit) and the entries for these dialogs are almost identical (only the last entry is different):</p>

<p>VS Version:</p>

<p>I don't understand how this is possible. I'm not too optimistic about finding a solution right away on this forum, as it seems like a pretty obscure error, but if anyone has any troubleshooting tips, I would be more than happy to hear them!</p>

<p>PS. WixEdit seems to be using an older version of Wix, whereas I used Wix 3.6 with VS. I had to make a few changes to the xml to get it running on WixEdit, but none of the changes affected any of the dialogs in question (Custom_Mundo, Custom_DirData, Custom_DirDataFound and Custom_NewInstall)</p>

The vignette applies genetic algorithms to solve non-convex optimization problems.</p>

<p>My question was on interpreting the parameter 'F' step-size. The documentation reads: ""F: step-size from interval [0,2]. Default to .8"". In the machine learning literature for gradient-based decent methods, stepsize refers to the amount that the choice vector is tweaked in the direction of maximal descent. Large steps imply faster convergence but less precision.</p>

<p>The vignette case-study involves portfolio optimization. The step-size is not specified as an argument so the stepsize of .8 is always used. However, since the optimization is finding what weights minimize some portfolio objective, and since weights must sum to 1, it seems that a stepsize of .8 (80% of the portfolio) is much to large for this problem. A better choice of stepsize might be .01. </p>

<p>However, I must be missing something since when I run an optimization I can see in each generation the weights are not jumping by .8 each time. So what is the interpretation of ""stepsize""? In the context of portfolio optimization does it makes sense to set this value to a small value such as .01 (1%)?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine you issue a write to the primary node of a replica set. What happens next? First, the write is recorded and then added to the
  primary’s oplog. Meanwhile, all sec- ondaries have their own oplogs
  that replicate the primary’s oplog. So when a given secondary node is
  ready to update itself, it does three things. First, it looks at the
  time- stamp of the latest entry in its own oplog. Next, it queries the
  primary’s oplog for all entries greater than that timestamp. Finally,
  it adds each of those entries to its own oplog and applies the entries
  to itself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this means nodes must be time synchronized? because timestamps must be equal on all nodes.</p>

<p>Also, I have already seen this question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13566468/how-to-compress-a-folder-to-make-docx-file-in-android"">here.</a> Neither one of those answers have helped and I have tried both of them. </p>

<p>I need to create a word document with a simple table and data inside. I decided to create a sample document in which to get the xml that I need to create the document. I moved all the folders from the unzipped docx file into my assets folder. Once I realized I couldn't write to the assets folder, I wrote a method to copy all the files and folders over to an external storage location of the device and then write the document I created to the same location. From there Im trying to zip the files back up to a .docx file. This is where things arent working. </p>

<p>The actual docx file is created and I can move it to my computer through the DDMS but when I go to view it Word says its corrupt. Heres whats weird though, if I unzip it and then rezip it on my computer without making any changes what so ever it works perfectly. I have used a program (for mac) called DiffMerge to compare the sample unzipped docx file to the unzipped docx that I have created and it says they are exactly the same. So, <strong>I think it has something to do with the zipping process in Android</strong>.</p>

<p>I have also tried unzipping the sample docx file on my computer, moving all the files and folders over to my assets folder including the document.xml file and just try to zip it up without adding my own document.xml file and using the sample one and that doesnt work either. Another thing I tried was to place the actual docx file in my assets folder, unzipping it onto my external storage and then rezipping it without doing anything. This also fails. </p>

<p>I'm basically at a loss. Please somebody help me figure this out. </p>

<p>Here is some of my code:</p>

<ol>
<li>moveDocxFoldersFromAssetsToExternalStorage() is called first.</li>
<li>After that is called all the files have been moved over.</li>
<li>Then, I create the document.xml file and place it in the word directory where it belongs</li>
<li>Everything is where it should be and I now try to create the zip file.</li>

<p>Error: The name DebugConverter does not exist in the namespace ...
It actually runs all converters fine, but errors are present anyway.</p>

<p>All of these errors only display in error list, it is not an issue when running the app, its just a huge problem when you have to locate a single real problem within 100+ errors.</p>

<pre><code>    public int[] getEnumCount(List&lt;T&gt; itemList, int enumSize
                             SomeFunction GENERIC_FUNCTION()  ) {

        int[] array = new int[enumSize];
        for (Class&lt;T&gt; item : itemList) {
            ++array[ item.GENERIC_FUNCTION().ordinal() ];
        }
        return array;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>...the only problem is, <code>GENERIC_FUNCTION()</code> has a different name in each member it's invoked on.  Is there a way to represent generic functions?  When I say generic, I mean, is there a way that <code>GENERIC_FUNCTION()</code> can represent getSuit() or getBreed(), since they both return <code>Enum&lt;?&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>I would like to be able to pass <code>List&lt;Card&gt;</code> and  <code>Card.getSuit()</code> arguments into this function, and get the correct count.  I have hundreds of functions of this structure, so this is a very non-negligible optimization in terms of readability and maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:  I cannot edit any of these classes at all.  The only thing I can do is use a generic function, if such a thing exists.</strong></p>

<p>I am trying to perform a constrained relaxation using LLoyds algorithm and input generated by scipy.spatial Voronoi (which is a wrapper for Qhull).</p>

<p>In terms of code it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>points = [n  for n in itertools.product(xrange(3),xrange(3))]
vor = Voronoi(points)

vor2 = lloyd(vor) # my relaxation function  - not relevant to the question
</code></pre>

<p>The  output graph generated by the code  looks ok (see below)
but the data in the vor structure is not enough to perform the Lloyds relaxation.
It is because I should only move the points that are inside the valid voronoi cells ( #4 in the image). The other should be left as they are. Qhull messes the order of points/regions so I can not estimate which region belongs to which point.</p>

<p>Here is the illustration of the problem:  </p>

<pre><code>print vor.vertices
#[[ 0.5  0.5]
# [ 1.5  0.5]
# [ 0.5  1.5]
# [ 1.5  1.5]]

print vor.regions  
# [[], [-1, 0], [-1, 1], [1, -1, 0], [3, -1, 2], [-1, 3], [-1, 2], [3, 2, 0, 1], [2, -1, 0], [3, -1, 1]]

print vor.points
# [[ 0.  0.]
#  [ 0.  1.]
#  [ 0.  2.]
#  [ 1.  0.]
#  [ 1.  1.]
#  [ 1.  2.]

#  [ 2.  1.]
#  [ 2.  2.]]
print vor.point_region
# [1 8 6 3 7 4 2 9 5]

<p>Now i should find somehow that vor.regions[7] is a region that belongs to the point vor.points[4].

<p>I'm trying to figure out how to implement the correct pattern in the client Angular code in addition to the server code.</p>

<p>Assume I have a collection of meetings and each meeting contains an array of participant objects (by reference, not embedded).</p>

<p>Therefore my javascript object may look like this:</p>

<pre><code>meeting: {
  _id: 123456,
  location: ""Room 222"",
  startDatetime: ....,
  endDatetime: ....,
  participants: [
    { _id: 33333 },
    { _id: 44444 }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I wanted to add a participant (and assuming I have the id of that new participant), I could implement this in various ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>In an angular controller handle the addition to the participants array and just ""push"" the new id onto the array.  Then called the typical REST update api (in the mean stack a service/ng-resource) to handle to the update.  Then on the server (mongoose) be able to handle this by taking the added entry in the array and call the appropriate function to add a participant.</li>
<li>Have a separate REST function to handle adding a participant and implement similar to #1.</li>
<li>Some other way that keeps things simple and clean.</li>
</ol>

<p>What is the recommended way (recommended from the MEAN architecture or from a RESTful architecture or from a mongoose/MongoDB perspective) to implement this?</p>

E.g. if you select rule 1 in the combobox it should update the score field in the view with 1 and if you change the selecteditem to rule 2 it should show 2 in the score field.</p>

<p>My code might be a bit crippled because I experimented 'on the way here' to achieve the desired result, I have a ScoreView with a datagrid which itemsource is scores:</p>

<p>I try to pass the elements selecteditem (which I bound to model.score) as a command parameter..
Maybe I should use the selecteditem of MatchVMRule but the score text field is bound to the Scores ViewModel instead of the Rules ViewModel?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Mike</p>

<p>UPDATE <em>SOLVED</em>
I finally solved it by creating two separate props rules collection and selected rule in my MainScoreViewModel.
I got rid of the eventocommand and handled the update of the score field in my Score Model based on the score of the Rule Model in the setter of the SelectedRule:</p>

<pre><code>    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Gets the SelectedRule property.
    /// Changes to that property's value raise the PropertyChanged event. 
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public RuleViewModel SelectedRule
    {
        get
        {
            return _selectedRule;
        }

        set
        {
            if (_selectedRule == value)
            {
                return;
            }
            _selectedRule = value;
            this.SelectedScore.Model.score = this.SelectedRule.Model.score;
            RaisePropertyChanged(SelectedRulePropertyName);
        }
    }

 Height=""23"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" 
 Name=""cmbRules"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"" Width=""100"" ItemsSource=""{Binding ScoreVM.Rules,

<p>I tested the code before, although at that point I was using static arrays and wanted to change to a dynamic size. However, even gdb with offers very little help besides the line number. Do I need to individually malloc each <strong>student</strong> struct, or am I missing something entirely different here? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: It seems the code works when I allocate memory to each <em>student</em> in the while loop through:</p>

<pre><code>S[i] = (student *)malloc(sizeof(student));
</code></pre>

<p>So that seems to have fixed the issue. I'll run some tests to make sure.</p>

<p>Today I went to heroku.com, logged in, and deleted oldtestapp. I have an existing Django project that I wish to migrate to Heroku. I copied over the Procfile and requirements.txt from the oldtestapp to my new app's root directory (the same dir that manage.py is in). I changed the Procfile: where it said ""oldtestapp.wsgi"" I changed it to ""newapp.wsgi"" where newapp is the name of my Django application. I opened git bash in the root directory for that project (the same dir that manage.py is in) and successfully pushed everything to git and heroku. </p>

<p>It looks to me like there is an error with <code>Starting process with command 'gunicorn oldtestapp.wsgi'</code> and <code>ImportError: No module named oldtestapp.wsgi</code> ...it seems like Heroku is still trying to tell gunicorn to run the test app I created. How can I get gunicorn to forget the oldtestapp and correctly run my new one? </p>

<p>Please let me know if any other information is needed. If it helps, I have committed the project to git without using a virtualenv. The Django application itself works without error (I have tested it elsewhere, I'm just trying to migrate it to heroku.) </p>

<p>I did a global search on all of the files in this heroku project to attempt to remove all occurrences of ""oldtestapp"" but there were none found.</p>

<a href=""http://oi41.tinypic.com/2ilklle.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oi41.tinypic.com/2ilklle.jpg</a>
As you can see only swimming events are listed in the above part but don't appear in the multiselect list, only those in the chzn-results appear. What can I do to resolve this?</p>

This is more a ""Is it possible, and if so how?"" question.
We have a couple of serial-to-ip devices on our network that have RS485 devices connected to them. We use westemo serial to IP converters, if that helps. Is it possible to ""ping"" the serial devices connected to the IP device? The function would be only to check if they are alive from a client point-of-view. I have no programming language specifically in mind but .NET would be preferred.
If anyone could point me in the right direction on where to start reading or looking around I would appreciate it. Yes I have asked Google but nothing really pops up.

<p>Every thing is OK, but developing language is Assembly. I want develope my simple OS with C programming language.</p>

<p>I want a C Compiler that convert my C source codes to Assembly sources and then I compile assmebly files with <code>NASM</code>.</p>

<p>Compiler <strong>should can</strong> create assembly files that compiled by <code>NASM</code>.</p>

<p>C source files that converted to assembly source files with GCC (<code>gcc -S OS.c masm=intel</code>) fails when I compilng them with <code>NASM</code>.</p>

<p>I dont use any C standard libraries even <code>stdio.h</code> or <code>math.h</code>.
I want a compiler that</p>

<ul>
<li>Converts C source codes to Assembly sources.</li>
<li>Or a compiler that creates flat binaries (like <code>NASM</code> or <code>FASM</code> outputs) from C sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've seen (and tried) every other Stack question / answer on this I could find and none work.</p>

<p>Basically I have a detail view with a toolbar and underneath a <code>UITextView</code> that takes up the rest of the space leaving a 20 point border around it's edges to the edge of the superview.</p>

<p>All I need is when the keyboard is displayed the textview will either change it's frame or it's content inset stuff, so that the keyboard doesn't cover anything up and the text scrolls to the end of it's text, and any new typing / line wrapping is not hidden by the keyboard - simple right? Er... no.</p>

<p>If the user changes <code>Orientation</code> (all 4 supported) then it needs to adjust to accommodate. </p>

<p>Then with keyboard dismissal it needs to return to it's full size ( depending on possible new orientation ).</p>

<p>This is the first project I've done with both <code>Autolayout</code> and <code>iOS 7</code> (and I've run into the bug in <code>iOS7</code> that puts your new line of text 'below' the bottom of the text view, but thanks to a stack fix that's okay now.)</p>

<p>However NONE of the solutions I've tried from this site work.</p>

<p>I'm setting the constraints for the <code>UITextView</code> by positioning it in IB in <code>portrait</code> and selecting 'reset to suggested constraints' - that seems to lay it out correctly for all 4 orientations if the keyboard is not displayed.</p>

        End If

<p>It actually works. But partially. My problem is that whenever a button is presses the value of DETERMINATOR variable is again assigned to the maximum length.</p>

<p>Is there any way to avoid reassignment of this variable and make it happen only once?</p>

Instead of ""<code>abcdef</code>"" there can be any other string with six characters containing <code>a-z, A-Z and 0-9</code>. That makes 56~57 billion possible strings.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Due to the ongoing interest in this topic, I've uploaded the code that I used <a href=""https://github.com/delight-im/ShortURL"">to GitHub</a>, with implementations for <a href=""https://github.com/delight-im/ShortURL/blob/master/Java/ShortURL.java"">Java</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/delight-im/ShortURL/blob/master/PHP/ShortURL.php"">PHP</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/delight-im/ShortURL/blob/master/JavaScript/ShortURL.js"">JavaScript</a>. Add your solutions if you like :)</p>

<p>My approach:</p>

<p>I have a database table with three columns:</p>

<ol>
<li>id, integer, auto-increment</li>
<li>long, string, the long URL the user entered</li>
<li>short, string, the shortened URL (or just the six characters)</li>
</ol>

<p>I would then insert the long URL into the table. Then I would select the auto-increment value for ""<code>id</code>"" and build a hash of it. This hash should then be inserted as ""<code>short</code>"". But what sort of hash should I build? Hash algorithms like MD5 create too long strings. I don't use these algorithms, I think. A self-built algorithm will work, too.</p>

<p>My idea:</p>

<p>For ""<code>http://www.google.de/</code>"" I get the auto-increment id <code>239472</code>. Then I do the following steps:</p>

<pre><code>short = '';
if divisible by 2, add ""a""+the result to short
if divisible by 3, add ""b""+the result to short
... until I have divisors for a-z and A-Z.
</code></pre>

<p>That could be repeated until the number isn't divisible any more. Do you think this is a good approach? Do you have a better idea?</p>

<p>The lines with the comments are my ""fixes"". Now I want to know what ""new char [len]+1"" does? I think the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>it allocates sizeof(char)*len memory from heap</li>
<li>and returns the WRONG address to the pointer *buffer</li>
<li>but what is the wrong address: ""first address of the new memory on heap + 1"" or ""first address of the new memory on heap + sizeof(char)*1)?</li>
</ul>

<p>What happens?

<p>Say that I'm running an online bookstore, and need to keep track of books, customers, orders, etc.  My natural instinct here is to use a relational database to hold this kind of information.  Now, let's say that when my customers have an account with me, they can configure their homepage in various ways.  For example, suppose there is a clock widget which can have different types (analog/digital), colors, and can be positioned any place on the page (or not shown at all).  We want to store this information so that when the customer logs in the widget is the correct type, color, and in the correct position.  Maybe there are multiple widgets which the customer may or may not use, each with their own attributes.  The customer-specific attributes need to be flexible in other words.  My instinct on this kind of thing would be to store this information in another format like XML, although I haven't needed to use XML in any projects thus far.  It also seems to me that something like MongoDB might make sense for holding this type of info, but I really don't know enough about it to make an intelligent judgement.</p>

<p>Does it make sense to separate out this kind of information or should the relational DB be abstracted to hold this type of information?  I'm sure there is no right answer here, but your insights would be appreciated.</p>

<p>DLL1 uses or makes calls into DLL2.  </p>

<p>Is there a way I can ensure that it is DLL1 and only DLL1 who's making the calls into DLL2? </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>  </p>

<p>The reason behind this is:  </p>

<p>I have a WinForms solution, and to keep it simple, it consists of a  view project and a controllers project (which generates a seperate .dll). After installing the application on a client machine, I realise it is possible to view the application .dlls in it's ""Program Files"" folder.  Somebody could potentially add a reference to the controller's .dll. I'd like to avoid this so that it's the view project and only the view project who's making the calls.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong><br>
One of the reasons I like separating controllers into a separate project is that I could potentially have many different view projects calling into and using the same controllers.  I then would only need to maintain one controller project for all views. For instance a win forms application and a test project or even a web site using the same controller project.    But taking this approach , I would then be faced with the security problem I mention (avoiding and controlling improper use of my dll). </p>

<p>So I have one approach,  compiling to one .dll, by using different folders, which I believe is correct and solves my security problem, but it conditions me to only having one view.</p>

<p>On the other hand if I have separate projects I am faced with the security issue.  </p>

<p>I am still dubious as to how I should go about this as I would still like to continue using different projects for the reasons I mention.  </p>

<p>I want to develop a (standalone) <strong>WinForms application</strong> which uses automation for communicating with <strong>Excel</strong>. I already know how to use the Interop, but I thought the <strong>VSTO</strong> tools would provide a more comfortable or sophisticated way to do that.</p>

<p><strong>My idea was:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I could build a new standalone project with the excel references prepared.</li>
<li>I could use a more sophisticated object model supplied by VSTO to communicate with Excel.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>However, my findings so far make me think that:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>VSTO can only be used to build add-ins/worksheets for Excel, <strong>not to build standalone application</strong>.</li>
<li>There is no more sophisticated object model than the one provided by the Interop (which has such ugly things as a locale bug, a ""Open(Missing, Missing, Missing...)"" method and so on.</li>
<li>I found a Worksheet and a Workbook class in the VSTO namespace, but as far as I understand it, these always refer to the CS classes for sheets and workbook which you implement when defining an Excel add-in or a workbook extension. - They cannot be used as comfortable wrappers in a standalone application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anybody confirm these statements or correct me where I am wrong?</p>

<p>Further, if there <em>should</em> be a way to use VSTO and its ""Workbook"" class to load an excel workbook from a standalone application, then <em>how</em> do I do that?</p>

To be honest I do not have a firm grip of the algorithm used, I copied and modified the rotation code from the pygame library (where it was used to rotate surfaces). Due to the implementation of <code>bitmask</code> I can speed this rotation up a lot by reversing the inner loop. With that I mean, instead of doing <code>foreach y { foreach x { ... } }</code> I need to do <code>foreach x { foreach y { ... } }</code>. I have trouble reversing the loop because the trigonometry has to be adapted in a way I don't currently see at this moment.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct bitmask {
  int w,h;
  BITMASK_W bits[1];
} bitmask_t;

bitmask_t* bitmask_rotate(const bitmask_t *mask, float angle) {
    bitmask_t *newmask = NULL;

    int isin, icos;
    double cx, cy, sx, sy;

    y = mask-&gt;h;
    cx = cangle*x;
    cy = cangle*y;
    sx = sangle*x;
    sy = sangle*y;
    nxmax = (int) (MAX (MAX (MAX (fabs (cx + sy), fabs (cx - sy)), fabs (-cx + sy)), fabs (-cx - sy)));
    nymax = (int) (MAX (MAX (MAX (fabs (sx + cy), fabs (sx - cy)), fabs (-sx + cy)), fabs (-sx - cy)));

    newmask = bitmask_create(nxmax, nymax, 0);
    if (!newmask) return NULL;

    cy = newmask-&gt;h / 2;
    xd = ((mask-&gt;w - newmask-&gt;w) &lt;&lt; 15);
    yd = ((mask-&gt;h - newmask-&gt;h) &lt;&lt; 15);

    ax = ((newmask-&gt;w) &lt;&lt; 15) - (int)(cangle * ((newmask-&gt;w - 1) &lt;&lt; 15));
    ay = ((newmask-&gt;h) &lt;&lt; 15) - (int)(sangle * ((newmask-&gt;w - 1) &lt;&lt; 15));

    xmaxval = ((mask-&gt;w) &lt;&lt; 16) - 1;
    ymaxval = ((mask-&gt;h) &lt;&lt; 16) - 1;

                if (bitmask_getbit(mask, dx &gt;&gt; 16, dy &gt;&gt; 16)) {
                    bitmask_setbit(newmask, x, y);
                }

    }

    return newmask;
}

<p>Before people are going to ask <em>""what have you tried?""</em>, I looped up rotating matrices on Wikipedia, and I could see what is going on there and how they implemented it in this algorithm (precalculate a starting <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code> and then increment with <code>icos</code> and <code>isin</code>), but the bitshifts and parameters I don't understand (<code>ax</code> for example) make it hard for me to follow.</p>

I was initially reading it from the assets folder using a <code>BufferedReader</code> and an <code>InputStreamReader</code> but I was running into memory issues (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14763656/android-file-reading-outofmemory-issue"">Android: File Reading - OutOfMemory Issue</a>). One suggestion was to copy the data from the assets folder to the internal storage (<strong>not the SD card</strong>) and then access it via <code>RandomAccessFile</code>. So I looked up how to copy files from the assets to internal storage and I found 2 sources:</p>

<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/android-developers/RpXiMYV48Ww"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/android-developers/RpXiMYV48Ww</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://developergoodies.blogspot.com/2012/11/copy-android-asset-to-internal-storage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developergoodies.blogspot.com/2012/11/copy-android-asset-to-internal-storage.html</a></p>

<p>I decided to use the code from the second one and modified it for my file. So it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void copyFile() {
    //Open your file in assets
    Context context = getApplicationContext();
    String destinationFile = context.getFilesDir().getPath() + File.separator + ""text.txt"";

    if (!new File(destinationFile).exists()) {
        try {
            copyFromAssetsToStorage(context, ""text.txt"", destinationFile);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }   
}

private void copyStream(InputStream input, OutputStream output) throws IOException {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int length = Input.read(buffer);
    while (length &gt; 0) {
        output.write(buffer, 0, length);
        length = input.read(buffer);
    }
}

private void copyFromAssetsToStorage(Context context, String sourceFile, String destinationFile) throws IOException {
    InputStream inputStream = context.getAssets().open(sourceFile);
    OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(destinationFile);
    copyStream(inputStream , outputStream );
    outputStream.flush();
    outputStream.close();
    inputStream.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am assuming that this copies the file into the app's data directory. I have not been able to test it because I would like to be able to access the file using <code>RandomAccessFile</code>. However, I have never done either one of these two (copying the file from assets and <code>RandomAccessFile</code>) so I am stuck. The work on this app has come to a standstill because this is the only thing that is preventing me from completing it. </p>

<p>Can anyone provide me with corrections, suggestions, and correct implementations of how to access the data using <code>RandomAccessFile</code>? (The data is a list of strings 4-15 characters in length on each line.)</p>

<p>EDIT*</p>

<pre><code>private File createCacheFile(Context context, String filename){
File cacheFile = new File(context.getCacheDir(), filename);

    if (cacheFile.exists()) {
        return cacheFile ;
    }

    InputStream inputStream = null;
    FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = null;

    try {

        inputStream = context.getAssets().open(filename);
        fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(cacheFile);

        int bufferSize = 1024;
        byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferSize];
        int length = -1;
        while ( (length = inputStream.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {
            fileOutputStream.write(buffer,0,length);
        }

<p>To isolate the problem I picked up struts blank and to my dismay it was showing the same trend. Is this normal? 
I tried checking out a few version of struts2 like 2.2.1, 2.2.1.1,  2.2.3.1 using maven (mvn archetype:generate) and after running them in jetty, I noticed that the PermGen space is filled up in every request by 2-3KB. I am testing on struts blank and jetty-6.1.21. </p>

<p>Since PermGen is increasing as a function of number of request I suspect how much worthy is it to go to production with it?</p>

<p>Based on the reading, I have noticed that the duration for On pulse is shorter while the duration for the Off pulse is much longer.</p>

<p>So, is there any difference on how ConsumerIrManager transmit method works between Android 5.0 and 5.1? Does anyone has any idea why there is a discrepancy between the Samsung S5 and S6 transmitting patterns?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Html.Partial(""~/Index/ViewUserControl/Promo.ascx, new PromoViewModel()); %&gt;

<p>Now, the constructor for <code>PromoViewModel</code> requires a <code>MemcachedCache</code> object that the index's controller also uses.</p>

<p>How should I pass this <code>MemcachedCache</code> into my partial view?</p>

<p>Should I put the <code>MemcachedCache</code> instance in the <code>ViewData</code> and do this?</p>

<p>Index.aspx isn't a strongly-typed view; it doesn't use a view model. But should I strongly-type it with a view model that has a public <code>Cache</code> member, then access it through the <code>Model</code>?</p>

<p>Everything compiles and deployed correctly. I can type the WSDL url into IE and view it. I can navigate to the request XSD in IE. So nothing seems to be wrong with the request XSD.
But  when I am trying to call the web service via SOAP UI: create a new project and add the WSDL and hit OK I get the following error</p>

<pre><code>ERROR:error: src-ct.2: To Extend the specified base type ‘Name@*MyNAMESPACE*‘ it must be a simple type or be a complex type with simple content.
</code></pre>

<p>In my XSD I have a name field</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:simpleType name=""Name""&gt;
    &lt;xs:restriction base=""xs:string""&gt;
        &lt;xs:minLength value=""1""/&gt;
        &lt;xs:maxLength value=""15""/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
&lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then I use this in several places where I extend it by adding an attribute</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:complexType name=""MyCustomeName""&gt;
      &lt;xs:simpleContent&gt;
             &lt;xs:extension base=""mc:Name""&gt;
                    &lt;xs:attribute name=""MyTypeOfName"" fixed=""MCN""/&gt;
             &lt;/xs:extension&gt;
      &lt;/xs:simpleContent&gt;
&lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>From what I can see the only way to enforce a length restriction and add an attribute is like the way I have defined it.</p>

<p>No idea what is defined incorrectly. Any ideas?</p>

Once activated, you could go into an admin panel on the plugin and tell it that all URLs starting with ""/catalog"" (or whatever you choose) would go to this product catalog app. Now the app would reside in the wp-content/plugins/mycatalog folder.

<ul>
<li>Send alerts when certain criteria are met</li>
<li>implement business rules on incoming data</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a user may input a task assigned to herself and set it to be due in three hours. Based on a business rule, when it is within one hour of its due time, the status would change from ""pending"" to ""urgent."" </p>

<p>This means that once per time period N, <em>something</em> needs to check the time of all pending tasks to see if they've entered the ""urgent"" threshold. Up to this point, I've only performed tasks like this using Windows Task Scheduler. (Create a batch file or EXE, have it run once every fifteen minutes.) I've been trying to suss out how the pros do it. </p>

<p>I'm under the impression that the preferred solution is to run a service to implement business rules. Here's what I don't understand: if I'm not using a utility like task scheduler, am I basically just running an infinite loop in one thread of my application that queries the service? </p>

<pre><code>do
{
   myObject = myService.query();
   if (myObject.dueDate &lt; Now() + 1 hour)
   {
       myObject.status = urgent
       //Update db
       //update view
       myService.fireAlert(myObject);
   }

   Thread.Sleep(60000);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This may be a broad, academic question. To be more specific, I'm coming at this with no knowledge of Windows Services. I think that's the direction I need to go, as I haven't really seen anything in the way of alternative ways to schedule code to run. Are there other possibilities? </p>

<p>For anyone who knows about SignalR, does that apply here?</p>

    {
        public HatType HatPreference { get; set; }
        public int CoolPoints { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say we're trying to add our two friends, a normal friend and a hipster friend:</p>

<p><strong>Create.cshtml</strong>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cshtml prettyprint-override""><code>@model MyNamespace.Model.Friends

&lt;div class='container'&gt;
    @using (Html.BeginForm())
    {
        @Html.ValidationSummary(true)
        @Html.AntiForgeryToken()

        @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.NormalFriend) //uses Person EditorTemplate by convention

        @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.HipsterFriend) //uses Hipster EditorTemplate by convention
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EditorTemplates/Person.cshtml</strong>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cshtml prettyprint-override""><code>@model MyNamespace.Model.Person

&lt;div class='row'&gt;
    &lt;div class='col'&gt;
        @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.Name)
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='col'&gt;
        @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.PhoneNumber)
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EditorTemplates/Hipster.cshtml</strong>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cshtml prettyprint-override""><code>@model MyNamespace.Model.Hipster

@Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model, ""Person"") // &lt;-- what I've tried and it isn't working

&lt;div class='row'&gt;
    &lt;div class='col'&gt;
        @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.CoolPoints)
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='col'&gt;
        @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.HatPreference)
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>Hipster</code> EditorTemplate, the code</p>

<pre><code>@Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model, ""Person"")
</code></pre>

<p>should pass the <code>Hipster</code> model to the <code>Person</code> EditorTemplate so that I don't have to repeat the Templated Code for shared properties (of the base type <code>Person</code>).</p>

<p>Currently, the above code just completely ignores the <code>EditorFor</code> and only displays the <code>Hipster</code> specific properties(ie <code>CoolPoints</code> and <code>HatPreference</code>).</p>

<p>Alternatively, I <em>could</em> change the following code in Create.cshtml:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cshtml prettyprint-override""><code> @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.NormalFriend) 

 @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.HipsterFriend) 
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cshtml prettyprint-override""><code> @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.NormalFriend) 

 @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.HipsterFriend, ""Person"") //break convention and the idea of nesting     
 @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.HipsterFriend) 
</code></pre>

<p>which will achieve what I want, but it seems wrong that I am unable to do this in the <code>Hipster</code> EditorTemplate.</p>

<p>Is my logic flawed on this or am I missing something? I thought it possibly could be disregarding the line in question for fear of recursion but the <code>templateName</code> argument should clarify.  This idea of inheriting the base type and nesting works with partials but partials don't handle <code>ViewData.TemplateInfo.GetFullHtmlFieldName</code>s of complex objects which are necessary for validation.</p>

I am a student trying to step outside of the comfort of foundation in a classroom and work on my first project. I have performed a search, my problem is I am not even sure how to word what I am looking for and am curious if I am overlooking a simple solution. I have tried searching for every variation of 'nested' or 'tree' that I think would associate with this problem but am having problems finding something that answers my question.</p>

<p>I am trying to list members that were referred by other members in a nested tree i.e. if John sponsored Mary, Mike, and Tom and Mike sponsored Megan and Susan, and Susan sponsored Betty and Michelle I want to be able to display something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>John
<ul>
<li>Mary</li>
<li>Mike
<ul>
<li>Megan</li>
<li>Susan
<ul>
<li>Betty</li>
<li>Michelle</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tom </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to be able to specify the depth to search for example I only needed to display 5 levels deep if needed. For this I was thinking of a <code>for (i=0;i&lt;=4;i++)</code></p>

<pre><code>$query = ""SELECT fname, lname, user_id FROM USER WHERE sponsor_id = (SELECT user_id FROM USER WHERE username = '$_SESSION[username]')"";
$result = mysqli_query($con, $query); 

while ($row = mysqli_fetch_row($result)) {
  echo ""&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$row[0] $row[1]&lt;/li&gt;"";
  $subquery = ""SELECT fname, lname, user_id FROM USER WHERE sponsor_id = '$row[2]'"";
  $subresult = mysqli_query($con, $subquery);
  while ($row2 = mysqli_fetch_row($subresult)) {
    echo ""&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$row2[0] $row2[1]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"";
  }     
}
</code></pre>

<p>This was my last attempt to figure out the general required structure which didn't exactly work. I am pretty sure I can make this work at any level desired if I want to keep making this deeper and nest further but what if I wanted to return 100 levels... seems there is a simple structure that I am just overlooking.</p>

<p>Any guidance would be appreciated, even a link to help explain this if you know how to search for what I am looking for I would be happy to read and learn myself, thanks!!</p>

<p>The tricky part is the application should allow a user to add/remove pollutants/techniques for consideration, and each technique has a different reduction efficiency for each pollutant. This means for each pollutant added, one more efficient need to be added to the Technique class. How should I structure the Technique class to accommodate this? I'd want to bind the techniquesList to something like a datagrid, where the user can enter customized information such as recuction efficient.</p>

<p>Edit: decided to go with a List (actually ObservableCollection per other posts and suggestion of RKaufman) property inside the Technique class, and nested Datagrid. So far I've run into two problems.</p>

<p>Problem 1. In addition to the columns I set up in XAML in the nested DG, each property of the data source shows up as a column as well. I initially had to set their visibility to ""Collapsed"" in the code behind, but when editing this post, I found out that I can simply set AutoGenerateColumns to False to get rid of the extra columns.</p>

<p>Problem 2. The TextBlock element in row 0 and column 0 of each and every of the nested Datagrid has the focus retangle around them. I wonder why and how to turn them off if possible. They don't disappear even if I click on other areas of the UI.  </p>

<p>There are also other pratices out there. So which one do you prefer? Do you do it even differently, and if so, how? Is there a best practice out there? Is this impacting SEO? Which one is the most semantic?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It seems that people here agree on the second solution. This is my opinion as well, but here is the problem that lead me to this question: what if I want to put a h3 in the main part?</p>

<p>Do I have to rewrite all the sections? This could be an entire website! It's often pretty hard to know exactly how many subtitles you will have in a section.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the sections could be sidebars or something looking totally different and somewhere else on the page.</p>

<p>For those returning to this question, the helpful answer below pushed me towards a workable design that is running fine. Three insights were key:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eventlet is a very safe environment — if two greenlets both try <code>recv()</code> to or both try <code>send()</code> from the same socket simultaneously, then Eventlet elegantly kills the second greenlet with an exception. This is magnificent and means that simple exceptions, and not impossible-to-reproduce data interleaving errors, will result if <code>amqplib</code> “greens” poorly.</li>
<li>The <code>amqplib</code> methods fall roughly into two groups: <code>wait()</code> loops inside of <code>recv()</code> until an AMQP message is assembled, while other methods <code>send()</code> messages back and will not attempt their own <code>recv()</code>. This is stunningly good luck, given that the <code>amqplib</code> authors had no idea that someone would try to “green” their library! It means that message sending is not only safe from the callback invoked by <code>wait()</code>, but that messages can also be sent safely from other greenlets that are completely outside the control of the <code>wait()</code> loop. These safe methods — that can be called from any greenlet, not just from the <code>wait()</code> callback — are:
<ol>
<li><code>basic_ack</code></li>
<li><code>basic_consume</code> with <code>nowait=True</code></li>
<li><code>basic_publish</code></li>
<li><code>basic_recover</code></li>
<li><code>basic_reject</code></li>
<li><code>exchange_declare</code> with <code>nowait=True</code></li>
<li><code>exchange_delete</code> with <code>nowait=True</code></li>
<li><code>queue_bind</code> with <code>nowait=True</code></li>
<li><code>queue_unbind</code> with <code>nowait=True</code></li>
<li><code>queue_declare</code> with <code>nowait=True</code></li>
<li><code>queue_delete</code> with <code>nowait=True</code></li>
<li><code>queue_purge</code> with <code>nowait=True</code></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Semaphores can be used as locks: initialize the semaphore with the count <code>1</code> and then <code>acquire()</code> and <code>release()</code> to lock and unlock. All of my async greenlets that want to write messages can use such a lock to avoid having their separate <code>send()</code> calls interleave and ruin the AMQP protocol.</li>
</ol>

<p>So my code looks roughly like this:</p>

<pre><code>amqp = eventlet.patcher.import_patched('amqplib.client_0_8')

class Processor(object):
    def __init__(self):
        write_lock = eventlet.semaphore.Semaphore(1)

    def listening_greenlet(channel):
        # start this using eventlet.spawn_n()
        # create Connection and self.channel
        self.channel.basic_consume(queue, callback=self.consume)
        while True:
            self.channel.wait()

    def safe_publish(channel, *args, **kw):
        with write_lock:  # yes, Eventlet supports this!
            channel.basic_publish(*args, **kw)     

    def consume(message):
        # Returning immediately frees the wait() loop
        eventlet.spawn_n(self.process, message)

    def process(message):
        # do whatever I want
        # whenever I am done, I can async reply:
        self.safe_publish(...)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Original Question:</strong></p>

<p>Imagine hundreds of AMQP messages arriving each minute at a small Python <a href=""http://eventlet.net/"">Eventlet</a> application, that each need to be processed and answered — where the CPU overhead of the processing will be minimal, but might involve waiting on answers from other services and sockets.</p>

<p>To allow, say, 100 messages to be processed at once, I could of course spin up 100 separate TCP connections to RabbitMQ and have a worker for each connection that receives, processes, and answers single messages in lock-step. But to conserve TCP connections I would prefer to create just one AMQP connection, allow RabbitMQ to stream messages down the pipe at me at full speed, hand those tasks off to workers, and send answers back when each worker completes:</p>

<pre><code>                                       +--------+
                                +------| worker | &lt;-+
                                |      +--------+   |
                                |      +--------+   |
                                | +----| worker | &lt;-+
                                | |    +--------+   |
                                | |    +--------+   |
                                | | +--| worker | &lt;-+
                                | | |  +--------+   |
                                v v v               |
                           +------------+           |
 RabbitMQ &lt;-AMQP-&gt; socket--| dispatcher |-----------+
                           +------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Observe that:</p>

<ul>
<li>An <a href=""http://eventlet.net/doc/modules/queue.html"">Eventlet queue</a> could elegantly distribute incoming work among the workers as they become available for more work.</li>
<li>Flow control from RabbitMQ might even be possible: I can ACK messages only until my workers are all busy, and then wait before sending further ACKs until the queue starts to empty.</li>
<li>Work will be almost certainly completed out-of-order: one request might finish quickly while another event that arrived earlier takes much longer; and some requests might never complete at all; so the workers will be handing back responses in an unpredictable and asynchronous order.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had been planning to write this using Eventlet and <a href=""http://eventlet.net/doc/modules/queue.html"">py-amqplib</a> after seeing this attractive blog post about how easily that AMQP library could be pulled into the Eventlet processing model:</p>

<p><a href=""http://blog.eventlet.net/2010/02/09/multiple-concurrent-connections-with-py-amqplib-and-eventlet/"">http://blog.eventlet.net/2010/02/09/multiple-concurrent-connections-with-py-amqplib-and-eventlet/</a></p>

<p>My problem is that, having read the documentation for both libraries, the amqplib source code, and much of the Eventlet source code, I cannot figure out how I can teach the eventlet that owns the AMQP connection — the eventlet named <code>connect_to_host()</code> in the blog post — to <em>also</em> wake up when a worker completes its work and generates an answer. The <code>wait()</code> method in amqplib can only be awoken through activity on the AMQP socket. Though it feels like I ought to be able to have the workers write their answers to a queue, and have the <code>connect_to_host()</code> eventlet wake up <em>either</em> when a new incoming message arrives <em>or</em> when a worker is ready with an answer to send, I cannot find any way for an eventlet to say “wake me when <em>either</em> of these things happens.”</p>

<p>It did occur to me that the workers could try commandeering the AMQP connection object — or even the raw socket — and writing their own messages back over TCP; but it seems as though locks would be necessary to prevent the outgoing worker messages from getting interleaved with each other or with ACK messages written by the main listener eventlet, and I cannot find where locks are available in Eventlet either.</p>

<p>All of this makes me feel almost certain that I am trying to tackle this problem somehow exactly backwards. Does a problem like this — letting a single connection be safely shared between a listener-dispatcher and many workers — simply not map to a coroutine model, and require a full-fledged async library? (In which case: is there one you would recommend for this problem, and how would the multiplexing take place between incoming messages and outgoing worker responses? I found no clean solution earlier today trying combinations like Pika + ioloop — though I have just seen another library, <a href=""https://github.com/paolo-losi/stormed-amqp"">stormed_amqp</a>, that might do better than Pika did.) Or do I actually need to fall back on real live Python threads if I want clean and maintainable code that can enact this model? I am open to all options.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help or ideas! I keep thinking that I have the whole concurrency-in-Python thing pretty much down, then I learn yet again that I do not. :) And I hope you liked the ASCII art above in any case.</p>

At the core of it, jQuery basiically just adds the entire lightbox to the current displayed page. I say this to make it clear that I'm not using any sort of fancy devices such as prototypes or iFrames. I was also able to add comments to the lightbox and that's where the problem comes in.</p>

<p>I want the comments to be separate for every image. Meaning, users should be able to commenton each individual image, not the whole gallery itself. The problem I'm having is that the facebook comments only record commnets for the whole page. So, while in the lightbox, the comments don't refresh when I go to the next image. </p>

<p>I've tried passing the individual picture URl to the 'data-href' attribute that facebook requests but that didn't work. I really don't know what to do...</p>

<p>From my understanding, and much searching thru google, the comments need to be linked to an individual page URL. I can see where the problem comes in: it asks for html page urls but I'm passing them picture urls. </p>

<p>1) Should i use an iframe and load the picture in there, then pass iframe url to the 'data-href' attribute?
2) Should i try using prototypes (i don't even know what those are or if they would even apply to my case lol)</p>

<p>Basically how do I tell facebook to save comments linked to an individual picture and not the entire html page?</p>

<p>P.S. This is like, my third time posting the same similar question so I decided not to put the code up again... I did before, no one answered and this time I felt there was no need to waste the space. Everything about the code works tho except for the comments for every image. If someone wants to see the code, however, just ask and I'll put it up.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>/<strong>**<em>SOLUTION UPDATE</em>**</strong>/
I managed to get this to work. It turns out facebook thought ahead and made it so their comments can be linked directly to an image and not just a .html file. For any struggling adventurers out there like me: here is what you have to do:
1) Set data-href originally equal to the absolute URL of the image that the user clicks on
2) When the user clicks previous/next, update the data-href of the comments to reflect the change in picture and call the following method right after</p>

<pre><code>FB.XFBML.parse();
</code></pre>

<p>--That method basically refreshes the comments plugin and makes it display the updated comments. That was my problem. In theory, my code was working the whole time, I just wasn't re-parsing it. I added that line and it works like a charm.</p>

<p>For anyone interested, you can check out the rough framework of the lightbox here: <a href=""http://shakazulu.host-ed.me/lightbox/lightboxPractice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shakazulu.host-ed.me/lightbox/lightboxPractice.html</a></p>

<p>--Don't judge, it's just a practice domain I use to try things out. I will try to keep that code up there as long as I can as I noticed it's very hard to find something similar on Google. If anyone needs the whole jQuery code or the CSS, simply ask and I will post it here.</p>

<p>Good luck in your programming adventures!</p>

"27621509","1","27621619","","2014-12-23 13:37:28","","0","68","<p>I've created two classes which replace the function of a <code>Point</code> (both variants) just to test them out, this is how I've created them:</p>

<p>Entity.cs:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Xnagame
{

    class Player
    {

        public class float2
        {
            public float X { get; set; }
            public float Y { get; set; }
        }
        public class int2
        {
            public int X { get; set; }
            public int Y { get; set; }
        }
        public int2 Position { get; set; }
        public int angle { get; set; }
        public float speed { get; set; }
        public float2 velocity { get; set; }

        public Player CreatePlayer()
        {

            Position = new Player.int2();
            Player player = new Player();
            return player;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, both Point classes have a <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> variable (I'm not sure if this is the way to set them up, if it isn't please tell me) and these classes are used in the position and velocity instances which are instantiated in the <code>CreatePlayer()</code> method.</p>

<p>Game1.cs:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Xnagame
{
    public class Game1 : Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game
    {
        GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;
        SpriteBatch spriteBatch;
        private Texture2D playerimage;
        private Texture2D background;
        Player player = Player.CreatePlayer();
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is that when <code>CreatePlayer()</code> method tries to return it's ""player"" to the local player it gives the:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property <code>Xnagame.Player.CreatePlayer()</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>error.</p>

<p>I also tried it with the new keyword and it gave me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Xnagame.Player.CreatePlayer()</code> is a method but is used like a type.</p>

Each question has two groups of radiobuttons (good, better, best; and unimportant, important, most important).  There are roughly 200 questions that get populated into the grid with about 15-20 showing without needing to scroll.  I've got the logic down to allow for selection of the radiobuttons, but when I scroll I the objects loose their focus and don't keep the the answers.</p>

<p>Basically, I can answer the first 20 questions but when I scroll down then I lose the answers due to the virtualization of the datagrid.  I tried turning it off but then the app takes forever to load and sorting goes out the window.  I have to keep it turned on.  Anyone know how to keep the state of the radiobuttons after scrolling?</p>

<p>Normally there are only a few pages, but today they have almost 40 pages. The problem is that after about page 35, the image becomes a small red X (like when an image is missing on a web page) but it will still print the text that goes on top of the image. </p>

<p>To add to my confusion, after a couple tweaks of how it page breaks, the report will run fine on my PC but not on the server. This report is using the Visual Studio reports and are stored on the intranet server not the SQL Server.</p>

I have a large table with a similar structure to the below.</p>

<p><code>DateTime | InboundUserID | OutboundUserID | CustomerUserID | Cost | Mins | Account Number</code></p>

<p>I'm trying to group the above data into hourly chunks and store the result in another table with a similar structure to below.</p>

<p><code>Date | HourFrom | HourTo | SumMins | SumCost | OutboundUserID | CustomerUserID | Account Number</code></p>

<p>I've written the following code / query in order to do this but it's not quite right. Basically the group by means not all the data gets summarised. For instance when looking at the newly created table I have all the OutboundUserID data, but none of the CustomerUserID data.</p>

<pre><code>    for(int i=0;i &lt;=23;i++)
    {
        for(int j=1 ; j &lt;=31 ; j++)
        {
            String Time = String.format(""%02d"", i);

            query = ""INSERT DELAYED INTO correlated_calls_hourly "" +
                    "" SELECT DateOnly,HourFrom,HourTo,DURATION,CALLCOUNT,`Price Group ID`,INBOUNDCOST,INBOUNDREVENUE,`InboundCustomerID`,OUTBOUNDCOST,OUTBOUNDREVENUE,`Outbound Customer ID`,`Customer ID`,`Account Number`,`Service` FROM"" +

                    "" )a "";
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I've already taken the step of creating three different tables to summarise the data separately by OutboundUserID/ InboundUserID / CustomerUserID. But it would be a lot more elegant if I could just get this one summarised table working correctly.</p>

<p>If anyone could help me think of a way to get the desired result via a single sql query I'd be greatly appreciative. </p>

<ol>
<li>click on the plot output tab: a plot renders and is then output (with one data row used)</li>
<li>select choice 2: a plot renders and is then output (with two data rows used)</li>
<li>select choice 3: a plot renders and is THEN hidden :(</li>
<li>select choice 4: nothing is rendered/output (good)</li>
</ol>

<p>now going between 3 and 4, nothing happens (good)</p>

<p>By looking at the console output, you can see that ""TableIndex"" is updated first, so it seems like this should never render with choice 3, since the plot would immediately disappear before it was updated. Presumably, that updating already triggered the reactive() and renderPlot() though.</p>

<p>How do I prevent these functions from executing in this order? I know I could just short circuit the reactive() and renderPlot() by checking TableIndex$X in the first line, but that seems hacky and I'm just learning shiny so I'm hoping for a cleaner solution</p>

<p>Bonus points if you implement the appearance of a render button instead of displaying nothing for choices 3 and 4. I've yet to attempt that but I believe it would be something with renderUI() ?</p>

<p>(TableIndex is calculated separately and then accessed in this way because in real life, it is finding the relevant indices from a large table and then applying those same indices to other tables. Assume that the index finding is fast)</p>

The view is a formula, where the user can insert data, like dates with the datepicker function and general text to describe the issues. The whole formula is in this: </p>

<pre><code>@using (Html.BeginForm())
{
@Html.AntiForgeryToken()
@Html.ValidationSummary(true)
</code></pre>

<p>All Textboxes, DropDownLists and Editors are connected to the model like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""editor-label""&gt;
        @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.Overview)
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""editor-field""&gt;
        @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.Overview)
        @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.Overview)
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment I try to insert the Textbox, where the autocomplete should happen like this:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;b&gt;Name: &lt;/b&gt;
     @Html.TextBox(""searchTerm"", null, new { id = ""txtSearch"" })
</code></pre>

<p>The txtSearch is connected to my skript SearchUser.js:</p>

<pre><code>$(function () {
    $(""#txtSearch"").autocomplete({
        source: '@url.Action(""New1"", ""Dialog"")',
        minLength: 1
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>when I use a source an array of strings, the autocomplete appears.</p>

<p>the JavaScript is registered on top of the view and jQueryUI is registered in _Layout.cshtml. I am using jquery 1.11.3 and jqueryui 1.11.4 .</p>

<p>In The Controller <code>New1</code> in the JsonResult you find this:</p>

<pre><code>public JsonResult Dialog(string search)
{
    List&lt;string&gt; users = db
                            .Users
                            .Where(p =&gt; p.FirstName.ToLower().Contains(search.ToLower()))
                            .Select(p =&gt; p.LastName)
                            .ToList();

    return Json(users, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
}
</code></pre>

<p>when i test the website and look for <a href=""http://localhost:51299/New1/Dialog?search=m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:51299/New1/Dialog?search=m</a>
i get the json file. The json file contains this: <code>[""Mueller""]</code></p>

<p>But when I go to my formula <a href=""http://localhost:51299/New1/Create"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:51299/New1/Create</a> and insert ""m"" into the TextBox nothing happens.</p>

<p>So now my question: What can i do to make it work?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update (It's working!!!)</h2>

<p>Aaaaah its working!!!. Thanks a lot! He couldnt use the source, so now I changed it to ""/New1/Dialog"".
I know it is not a good way to use the direct url instead of '@url.Action(""Dialog"", ""New1"")', but i think he couldnt differ between normal <strong>'</strong> and <strong>""</strong>.
If you have an Idea why i couldnt use @url.Action, i would be interested in it.</p>

The relation is 1 to N, and I've tryed with a relation N to N, but I can't solve it.</p>

<p>Could anybody help me, please?? :(</p>

<hr>

<p>Sorry, my problem is that in a controller I have the main model and work with two models.</p>

<p>Main model:</p>

<pre><code>--- Playlist.js ---

module.exports = {
  attributes: {
     name: {
        type: 'string',
        required: true,
        unique: true
     },
     // Associations
     tablets_playlists: { 
       collection: 'Tablet',
       via: 'lista_tablet'
     },

     songs_playlist: { 
      collection: 'Song',
      via: 'song'
     }
   }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Other models:</p>

<pre><code>--- Song.js ---

module.exports = {
  attributes: {
     group: {
        type: 'string',
        required: true,
        unique: true
     },
     song: {
        type: 'string'
     },

     // Association
     song: { 
       collection: 'Playlist',
       via: 'songs_playlist'
     }
   }
};

--- Tablet.js ---
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
     MAC: {
        type: 'string',
        required: true,
        unique: true
     },
     // Associations
     lista_tablet: { 
       collection: 'Playlist',
       via: 'tablets_playlists'
     }
};
</code></pre>

<p>And when I associate a song with playlist or a tablet with playlist in my render view don't appear. But if the relation is 1 to N, it appears. And when I associate two times the same song, the server crash, I think that is because there are or its trying add two equals objects in the bbdd.</p>

<p>This is my method to associate a tablet with a playlist and similar to song (I posted before).</p>

<pre><code>associateTabletToPlaylist: function(req,res,next){
    var tablet_id = req.param('tablet_id');
    var playlist_id = req.param('playlist_id');

    Playlist.findOne(playlist_id, function foundPlaylist(err, playlist) {
        if (err) return next(err);
        if (!playlist) return next();

        playlist.tablets_playlists.add(tablet_id);
        playlist.save(function createAssociation(err, saved) {

            if (err) res.redirect('/playlist/associateTablet/');
            res.redirect('/playlist/show/' + playlist_id);
        });
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the code in PlaylistController to show, to render the view:</p>

<pre><code>// render the profile view (e.g. /playlist/show/.ejs)
show: function(req, res, next) {

    Playlist.findOne(req.param('id'), function foundPlaylist(err, playlist) {
        if (err) return next(err);
        if (!playlist) return next();
        Tablet.find({'listas_reproduccion':playlist.id},function foundTablets(err, tablets) {
            if (err) return next(err);
            if (!tablets) return next();
            Song.find({'song':playlist.id}, function foundSongs(err, songs) {
                if (err) return next(err);
                if (!songs) return next();
                res.view({
                    songs: songs,
                    tablets: tablets,
                    playlist: playlist

<p>Step 1 - First step reads certain transactions from database and produces a list of record Ids that will be sent to step 2 via jobContext attribute.</p>

<p>Step 2 - This should be a partition step: The slave steps should be partitioned based on the list obtained from step 1 (each thread gets a different Id from the list) and perform their read/process/write operations without interfering with each other.</p>

<p>My problem is that even though I want to partition data based on the list produced by step 1, spring configures step 2 (and thus, calls the partitioner's partition() method) before step 1 even starts, so I cannot inject the partitioning criteria on time. I tried using @StepScope on the partitioner bean, but it still attempts to create the partitions before the job starts.</p>

<p>Is there a way to dynamically create the step partitions during runtime, or an alternative way to divide a step into threads based on the list provided by step 1?</p>

<hr>

<p>Some background:</p>

<p>I am working on a batch job using spring batch which has to process Transactions stored in a database. Every transaction is tied to an Account (in a different table), which has an accountBalance that also needs to be updated whenever the transaction is processed.</p>

<p>Since I want to perform these operations using multi-threading, I thought a good way to avoid collisions would be to group transactions based on their accountId, and have each thread process only the transactions that belong to that specific accountId. This way, no two threads will attempt to modify the same Account at the same time, as their Transactions will always belong to different Accounts.</p>

<p>However, I cannot know which accountIds need to be processed until I get the list of transactions to process and extract the list from there, so I need to be able to provide the list to partition during runtime. Thtat's why I thought I could generate that list in a previous step, and then have the next step partition and process the data accordingly.</p>

<p>Is the approach I am taking plausible with this setup? Or should I just look for a different solution?</p>

How to do that without lags?

<p>When using the os.access method with the mode set to os.F_OK (see whether a path can be accessed), I am getting False returned every time, even when the python interpreter returns True for that directory. The strange thing about this though, is that the os.access method called with the os.R_OK, os.W_OK and os.X_OK modes returns True.</p>

<p>Here is a code sample I knocked up to demonstrate the issue:</p>

<pre><code>import os

d = [""C:\\"", "".\\"", ""./"", ""."", ""C:\\BOGUS_DIR""]

for path in d:

<p>For good measure, I added a bogus directory to the list (a directory that doesn't exist). The os.access with mode os.F_OK returned False (as always), but the call to check os.R_OK throws an exception (as expected).</p>

<p>Also, I tested the os.access method in the python interpreter, which worked fine.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find anybody else with this issue, which is why my first assumption is that I've done something silly (or missed something obvious). I am running the IronPython code through Visual Studio 2010, perhaps there is something interfering there.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>I'd like to write a webservice that works with <code>Spring</code>, maybe uses <code>CXF</code> (if it makes sense). I want to stick to pure annotation based configuration in Spring, no XML should be written.</p>

<p>I've done annotation based clients with sping already, but somehow I cannot find any good tutorial how to do the same as a soap service.
It also should be a contract-last service, so that I can auto-generate the WSDL from my Request/Response classes.</p>

<p>Further I'd like to have to configure my Req/Rsp classes as less as possible. Ideally I'd just write them as POJOs wrapping the data to transfer by soap, and that's it.</p>

<p>Could you point me which frameworks I should/could use for my approach?</p>

is this a good idea to have two separate contexts, that will live as long as components lives. One context is for write/update (with periodically SaveChanges call), another one is for reading (with entities tracking off).</p>

<p>In exploring precisely which characters were permitted in Java identifiers, I have stumbled upon something so extremely curious that it seems nearly certain to be a bug. </p>

<p>I’d expected to find that Java identifiers conformed to the requirement that they start with characters that have the Unicode property <code>ID_Start</code> and are followed by those with the property <code>ID_Continue</code>, with an exception granted for leading underscores and for dollar signs. That did not prove to be the case, and what I found is at extreme variance with that or any other idea of a normal identifier that I have heard of.</p>

<h1>Short Demo</h1>

<p>Consider the following demonstration proving that an ASCII ESC character (octal 033) is permitted in Java identifiers:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -le 'print qq(public class escape { public static void main(String argv[]) { String var_\033 = ""i am escape: \033""; System.out.println(var_\033); }})' &gt; escape.java
$ javac escape.java
$ java escape | cat -v
i am escape: ^[
</code></pre>

<p>It’s even worse than that, though.  Almost infinitely worse, in fact.  Even NULLs are permitted! And thousands of other code points that are not even identifier characters. I have tested this on Solaris, Linux, and a Mac running Darwin, and all give the same results.</p>

<h1>Long Demo</h1>

<p>Here is a test program that will show all these unexpected code points that Java quite outrageuosly allows as part of a legal identifier name.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
# 
# test-java-idchars - find which bogus code points Java allows in its identifiers
# 
#   usage: test-java-idchars [low high]
#   e.g.:  test-java-idchars 0 255
#
# Without arguments, tests Unicode code points
# from 0 .. 0x1000.  You may go further with a
# higher explicit argument.
#
# Produces a report at the end.
#
# You can ^C it prematurely to end the program then
# and get a report of its progress up to that point.

<h1>The Question</h1>

<p>Can anyone please explain this seemingly insane behavior?  There are many, many, many other inexplicably permitted code points all over the place, starting right off with U+0000, which is perhaps the strangest of all.  If you run it on the first 0x1000 code points, you do see certain patterns appear, such as permitting any and all code points with the property <code>Current_Symbol</code>.  But too much else is wholly inexplicable, at least by me.</p>

I know that in the browser you'd have to use browserify, but I'm actually going to start a project with node-webkit or atom-shell, and they can load NPM modules right from the DOM without any need for browserify or other build tools. </p>

<p><a href=""https://ampersandjs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ampersand.js</a> seemed like a great fit but it doesn't work without browserify because of issues like <a href=""https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/delegate/pull/2"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>. Using browserify isn't a great solution because it comes with a <code>require</code> shim which would override node's <code>require</code>. Then you would no longer be able to use core Node modules like <code>fs</code> for filesystem access from client side JavaScript.</p>

<p>Of course I don't really <em>have</em> to restrict myself to CommonJS modules, I could just use AngularJS or whatever the old fashioned way. But then we're back to bundling dependancies and all that, and for a brand new project it seems nicer to use the best available dependancy management, which for node-webkit and atom-shell is NPM and <code>require</code>'ing CommonJS modules.</p>

<p>I'm not asking for opinions about <em>best</em> frameworks, just a factual list of SPA frameworks.</p>

<p>they, however, don't mention anything for ADGs, and setting defaultDataGridItemRenderer to either FTEDataGridItemRenderer or FTEAdvancedDataGridItemRenderer doesn't seem to do the trick. Would love to know if anyone has had to deal with this and managed to successfully get around this.</p>

<p>I have a default GWT project.  The only non default thing is I've decided to use JSON for communicating with the server both ways.  I'm using jax-rs (jersey) to do this.</p>

<p>My war directory looks like this BEFORE attempting to add spring or hibernate to the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>war</li>
<li>war/project-name</li>
<li>war/WEB-INF</li>
<li>war/WEB-INF/classes (and subdirectories)</li>
<li>war/lib</li>
<li>war/lib/asm-3.1.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/flexjson-2.1.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/gwt-servlet.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jackson-core-asl-1.7.1.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jackson-jaxrs-1.7.1.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jackson-mapper-asl-1.7.1.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jackson-xc-1.7.1.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jersey-client-1.7.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jersey-core-1.7.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jersey-json-1.7.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jersey-server-1.7.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jettison-1.1.jar</li>
<li>war/lib/jsr311-api-1.1.1.jar</li>
<li>war/web.xml</li>
</ul>

<p>Not so bad, 13 JARS and a single XML file containing a few lines.  It's pretty compact, I have the JSON going back and forth as expected.  Perfect.  Now all I have to do is add the ORM.  I've used Spring and hibernate in past projects but I've never really configured them.</p>

<p>The problem is, how do you find out how to configure them?  If you google it, you will find millions of tutorials (most of them out of date).  The hibernate tutorial is great and I'm almost 100% certain I could get plain hibernate working easily (in fact I did a long time ago).  But I want to stick with industry conventions and use Hibernate with Spring and JPA.</p>

<p>I found this tutorial here, which seems to be up to date:
<a href=""http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2010/05/gwt-2-spring-3-jpa-2-hibernate-35.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2010/05/gwt-2-spring-3-jpa-2-hibernate-35.html</a></p>

<p>But I'm going in circles.  Problem after problem.  After I start the GWT app I get this:</p>

<li>Does anyone know why I'm encountering the error above?</li>
<li>Can someone refer me to a very simple (AND update to date!) tutorial on how to configure these frameworks?  It's not that I don't understand hibernate.  I've used it for the last 3 years (although only heavily in the past few months in the form of Grails).</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks</p>

The first save worked, but changes I make in subsequent runs fail to change the file. Looking at the <a href=""http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/prefs/Preferences.html"" rel=""nofollow"">API</a> and at <a href=""http://www.vogella.com/articles/EclipsePreferences/article.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a Vogella article</a>, I think I'm doing the right steps. When I run in debug mode, after I call <code>clear()</code>, I still see the same children key/value pairs. Further, after I flush the preferences, the file on disk doesn't change. Do I have to call <code>flush()</code> to make this work? (It seems silly that I should have to flush to disk to change something in memory -- and it doesn't help). </p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

"32342813","1","32514471","","2015-09-02 00:17:11","","0","98","<p>I have been experimenting with iCloud sample code and tutorials in order to develop a syncing system between our MacOS and iOS products.  On the iOS side I have had no problem building and running code that manipulates data in an iCloud Documents container, but on the MacOS side, using the Apple MacOS <strong>PackagedDocument</strong> sample project, I have not been able to successfully place any data in my iCloud.  I believe the basic problem is that the URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier for my app can not be found, probably due to some error in iCloud entitlements specification.  But, after much time spent fiddling with the developer portal and <strong>Xcode 6</strong>/<strong>PackagedDocument</strong> settings, I have been unable to locate the source of the problem.</p>

<p>My iCloud account was previously a MobileMe account and is used to synchronize the Apple apps between MacOS and iOS devices, so I believe my iCloud account is working without problems.</p>

<p>Here I am illustrating the different ways that I have specified the call to get the iCloud Documents container.  The call to get the iCloud container URL returns nil regardless of how it is specified:</p>

<pre><code>    // remember our ubiquity container NSURL for later use
    _ubiquityContainer = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:@""icloud.com.mycompany.PackagedDocument""];
    _ubiquityContainer = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:@""7G3Z4SV5WT.com.mycompany.PackagedDocument""];
    _ubiquityContainer = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>In my iOS experiments, this <strong>URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier</strong> call always gets the desired URL.</p>

<p>The CFBundleIdentifier for the app is <strong>com.mycompany.PackagedDocument</strong></p>

<p>The iCloud entitlement keys are specified as follows:</p>

<p>The <strong>com.apple.application-identifier</strong> key value is <strong>$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)com.mycompany.PackagedDocument</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>com.apple.developer.icloud-services</strong> key value is <strong>CloudDocuments</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers</strong> key value is
<strong>iCloud.$(CFBundleIdentifier)</strong></p>

<p>and the <strong>com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers</strong> key value is
<strong>iCloud.$(CFBundleIdentifier)</strong></p>

<p>I also tried code from this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owmY-ZbDOJU"" rel=""nofollow"">video tutorial</a>, but get the same nil result when trying to get the ubiquity container:</p>

<pre><code>    - (IBAction)saveToIcloud:(id)sender {

    NSFileManager *fm = [NSFileManager defaultManager];

    NSURL *directory = [[fm URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:@""7G3Z4SV5WT.com.mycompany.PackagedDocument""]
        URLByAppendingPathComponent:@""Documents""];
    directory = [[fm URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:@""iCloud.com.mycompany.PackagedDocument""]
                        URLByAppendingPathComponent:@""Documents""];
    directory = [[fm URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:nil]
                        URLByAppendingPathComponent:@""Documents""];
    directory = [[fm 

    if (directory) {
        [fm createDirectoryAtURL:directory withIntermediateDirectories:NO attributes:nil error:NULL];

        NSURL *filepath = [NSURL URLWithString:@""/Users/leg/Desktop/myjpeg.jpg""];

        NSURL *destination = [directory URLByAppendingPathComponent:[filepath lastPathComponent]];

        [fm setUbiquitous:YES itemAtURL:filepath destinationURL:destination error:nil];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In summary, I believe the problem must have something to do with my specification of iCloud entitlements and/or other specifications necessary to access iCloud Document containers.  If anyone has a clue about what may be happening to me, I'd greatly appreciate their feedback.  Failing that, maybe someone could point me at working <strong>non-iOS</strong>, macos iCloud Documents sample code.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p>

<p>I am seeing the following messages in he console log PackagedDocument start-up:</p>

<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>

<p>I performed an experiment with a working iOS iCloud example project to validate the PackagedDocument iCloud container:</p>

<p>I altered the iOS example’s Capabilites/iCloud settings from “Use default container” to “Specify custom containers”.  I checked off the example’s default container and checked on “iCloud.com.mycompany.PackagedDocument”.</p>

<p>I then changed the URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier call:</p>

<pre><code>    from:  NSURL *baseURL = [[NSFileManager defaultManager]URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:nil];

    to:    NSURL *baseURL = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:@""iCloud.com.mycompany.PackagedDocument""];
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when I run this iOS app, it creates the PackagedDocument iCloud container and uses it for its data—-exactly what I’ve been trying to do with the PackagedDocument MacOS sample.</p>

<p>I then went back to the MacOS PackagedDocument project and ran it to see if the <strong>URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier</strong> call would now find the container.  It did <strong>not</strong>. Nil is still returned even though the container definitely now exists.</p>

<p>I suppose that this means it is still an entitlements problem of some kind.</p>

<li><p>I then decided to try the same experiment in a clean install of El Capitan (10.11 Beta 5)/Xcode 6.4.  Again, it still does not work--<em>does not find the iCloud container</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>And finally, I decided to try one more experiment.  I decided to try turning on <strong>iCloud Drive</strong>.  But, because I did not want to convert my working iCloud account to <strong>iCloud Drive</strong>, I decided to create a new iCloud ID for the test, and to turn on <strong>iCloud Drive</strong>.  Now, when I build and run <strong>PackagedDocument</strong> in El Capitan with <strong>iCloud Drive</strong>, <em>everything works perfectly</em>.</p></li>

<p>I'm trying to solve a problem faced by many; essentially after a partial asp.net postback all the controls/divs that had a scrollbar with a non-zero value (ie: were scrolled down to some position) are reset to the zero (top of the scrollbar).</p>

<p>My approach is to have a jQuery script save all the scrollbar positions for all the controls/divs contained on a page and after the postback, restore all the scroll bar positions.</p>

<p>Is it possible, can it even work? If it is, how do I use jQuery to select all the divs with scrollbars and then save those positions.</p>

My aim is to classify different words in a multi-lingual sentence written in Roman Script based on some criteria. Thus, I need a classifier for it. Unquestionably, there are many. But since my features aren't numerical but textual, and most of the classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM) input numerical features, I looked for some methodology to convert my textual features into numerical one. Though the concept of Bag Of Words with the use of Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a generic approach for this purpose, one of my textual feature, namely local context, is of fixed length and i want to know if it is possible to convert it into numerical feature without using TF-IDF. Local context feature refers to considering previous two and next two words (which comprise the context of a particular word). Therefore, I am looking for any other methodology which could prove to be better in this case. I found similar query at Cross Validated <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/144327/convert-categorical-data-into-numerical-data"">here</a>, but that is for document clustering and i want to classify individual words into different classes.

I just started using the <a href=""http://eclipse.org/mat/"" rel=""nofollow"">Eclipse Memory Analyzer</a> to try to solve a memory leak in my activity that extends MapActivity, but I am not sure if I understand its output correctly. In order to analyze the leak I started the activity and rotate the screen a couple of times and then I took a heap dump and opened it. The first thing I did was opening the <a href=""http://imageshack.us/f/847/leak1.png/"" rel=""nofollow"">Histogram view</a>  and look for my activity (called ChangeLocationActivity). This looks indeed like a memory leak, since there are three instances of the same Activity. So I got the list of objects with incoming references, then got the ""Path to GC Roots"" excluding weak references for all the three instances. <a href=""http://imageshack.us/f/4/leak2a.png/"" rel=""nofollow"">This</a> is the path of the first instance, <a href=""http://imageshack.us/f/215/leak3.png/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> for the second instance (that custom MyLocationOverlay is a really simple class created to bypass a bug on some Motorola devices and it doesn't anything special apart from catching an Exception in drawMyLocation()) and finally <a href=""http://imageshack.us/f/819/leak4.png/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> is the one for the third instance, which looks like the one currently shown.</p>

<p>As I said before I am not sure if I understand these results correctly (the Eclipse Memory Analyzer is really powerful but quite complex) but from what I can tell it looks like what's causing  the memory leak is something related to the Google Maps library. Can anyone tell me if I am right or if I'm just not understanding these results?</p>

They are two separate Windows 8.1 executables (separate processes).  I would like to print an image from the C++ app to a Canvas belonging to a control residing on a form in the C# app.  </p>

<p>The reason I want to print directly to a Canvas belonging to the C# app instead of shipping bitmaps around is performance.  The images I will be printing are frames coming in at 50 times a second from an attached camera.  Therefore, crunching the image from a Bitmap to a JPG and back the other way on the C# side with each socket transfer is a performance penalty I'd like to avoid.  </p>

<p>As far as using a shared memory region goes, I've used them in the past but have had strange ""glitches"" I could never solve.  Also the huge number of soft errors that are inherent to that technique, due to the repetitive invalidation of the shared memory region's backing page with each write operation, look like hell in the Task Manager.</p>

<p>Since I control both code bases, it is easy for me to have the C# app pass O/S level elements (handles, etc.) to the C++ app needed to facilitate this.  Can anyone tell me what the general technique would be for me to do this?  I'm fine with using DirectX or the like if necessary.  But I need to know the general technique so I can get started.</p>

<p>I've found a way to provably make better guesses as to how queries should be evaluated, but I need to put my expression into CNF or DNF first in order to get provably correct answers.

<p>Now, converting to CNF or DNF is something I do by hand all the time in order to simplify complicated expressions. (Well, maybe not <em>all the time</em>, but I do know how that's done using e.g. demorgan's laws, distributive laws, etc.) However, I'm not sure how to begin translating that into a method that is implementable as an algorithm. I've looked at papers on query optimization, and several start with ""well first we put things into CNF"" or ""first we put things into DNF"", and they never seem to explain their method for accomplishing that.</p>

<p>Here is what I have created: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/JKeJ1ED.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/JKeJ1ED.png</a></p>

<p>As it is now, I can move the complete thing with my arrows. This is fine, as I will add this function to a player sprite later. The screenshot has been taken in windowed mode, but the game is meant to be played fullscreen. When opened in fullscreen, the tiles seem to be a little too small. Is there anyway I can make them come closer, like moving the camera?</p>

<p>Camera.cs code: namespace Reinvention</p>

<pre><code>{
    static class Camera
    {
        static public Vector2 Location = Vector2.Zero;
    }
}

Game1.cs camera related code:

    KeyboardState ks = Keyboard.GetState();
    if (ks.IsKeyDown(Keys.Left))
    {
        Camera.Location.X = MathHelper.Clamp(Camera.Location.X - 2, 0, (myMap.MapWidth - squaresAcross) * 32);
    }

    if (ks.IsKeyDown(Keys.Right))
    {
        Camera.Location.X = MathHelper.Clamp(Camera.Location.X + 2, 0, (myMap.MapWidth - squaresAcross) * 32);
    }

    if (ks.IsKeyDown(Keys.Up))
    {
        Camera.Location.Y = MathHelper.Clamp(Camera.Location.Y - 2, 0, (myMap.MapHeight - squaresDown) * 32);
    }

    if (ks.IsKeyDown(Keys.Down))
    {
        Camera.Location.Y = MathHelper.Clamp(Camera.Location.Y + 2, 0, (myMap.MapHeight - squaresDown) * 32);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried playing around with numbers and Vector2, but nothing seems to work. I'm pretty sure I have to go with a completely new line of code, but I am unsure of which one.</p>

<p>My next and a little more important issue is, that I does not seem to figure out, how to make the tiles(camera) have anything in the middle of the screen. Having a center of it all, in the middle of the screen.</p>

<p>My spriteBatch.draw code:</p>

<pre><code>spriteBatch.Begin();

Vector2 firstSquare = new Vector2(Camera.Location.X / 32, Camera.Location.Y / 32);
int firstX = (int)firstSquare.X;
int firstY = (int)firstSquare.Y;

Vector2 squareOffset = new Vector2(Camera.Location.X % 32, Camera.Location.Y % 32);
int offsetX = (int)squareOffset.X;
int offsetY = (int)squareOffset.Y;

for (int y = 0; y &lt; squaresDown; y++)
{
    for (int x = 0; x &lt; squaresAcross; x++)
    {
        spriteBatch.Draw(
            Tile.TileSetTexture,
            new Rectangle((x * 32) - offsetX, (y * 32) - offsetY, 32, 32),
            Tile.GetSourceRectangle(myMap.Rows[y + firstY].Columns[x + firstX].TileID),
            Color.White);
    }
}

spriteBatch.End();
</code></pre>

<p>To solve this I tried making both an origin and a screenpos vector2, code:</p>

<pre><code>private Vector2 origin;
private Vector2 screenpos;
protected override void LoadContent()
{
    // Create a new SpriteBatch, which can be used to draw textures.
    spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);
    Tile.TileSetTexture = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(@""test"");
    Viewport viewport = graphics.GraphicsDevice.Viewport;
    origin.X = Tile.TileSetTexture.Width / 2;
    origin.Y = Tile.TileSetTexture.Height / 2;
    screenpos.Y = viewport.Height / 2;
    screenpos.X = viewport.Width / 2;
</code></pre>

<p>Inserting both terms gave error. Inserting just screenpos gave also error. Closest result came when replacing ""new Rectangle((x * 32) - offsetX, (y * 32) - offsetY, 32, 32)"" with ""screenpos"". Made 1 tile appear in the middle, but removed the rest of the tiles.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance! :)</p>

During the computational process of an ergm function, in the console is shown the number of iterations already accomplished, and the one that is ongoing (i.e. Iteration 1 of at most 50).
Since I'am running a computationally intensive ergm, I would like to add two progress bar: </p>

<ol>
<li>one to see the progress of the iteration ongoing;</li>
<li>one to see the progress of the entire process.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far the only thing I have found is a way to implement a progress bar for loops. Thus I guess that the only way to answer to the first issue I've raised is to modify the original function in the library ergm, integrating i.e. a winProgressBar (I'm a Window user) somewhere in the montecarlo process. But I have no clue for the resolution of my second problem.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone has faced the same problems and has found a solution.
Let me just add that I'm sorry that I didn't provide any attempt to solve these problems, so to start the discussion, but at the moment I really don't know how to approach the issue of progress bars.</p>

<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Area.html#weight"" rel=""nofollow"">Quote from the SDK help</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each Area consists of a rectangle specifying its bounds, and <strong>a weight that determines its importance</strong>. The bounds are relative to the camera's current field of view. The coordinates are mapped so that (-1000, -1000) is always the top-left corner of the current field of view, and (1000, 1000) is always the bottom-right corner of the current field of view. Setting Areas with bounds outside that range is not allowed. Areas with zero or negative width or height are not allowed.
  <strong>The weight must range from 1 to 1000, and represents a weight for every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area with the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in the metering result</strong>. Metering areas can overlap and the driver will add the weights in the overlap region.</p>

<pre><code>class Node
{
 protected Node next;

 public Node()
 {
    next = null;
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This class basically links the data together using a Node.next object. I've successfully been able to create a stack with push() and pop(), because the two operations happen on the same end, so the point are just manipulated between pointing to a new added node, and the previous node. </p>

<p>However, I'm having some difficulties understanding the logic to create a queue based on a similar structure. My queue class looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Queue
{
 private Node footer;
 private Node header;

 public Queue()
 {
    footer = null;
    header = null;
 }

 public void add(Node newNode)
 {   
    //Adds onto the queue from the 'footer' end.
 }  

 public Node remove()
 {
    //Removes from the queue from the 'header' end.
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what I understand: (1)The header and the footer point to the same first node. (2) Subsequent adding should change the footer to point to the added nodes, but the header stays on the first node added. (3) The header should point to the next oldest node upon removal.</p>

<p>Here's what I can't figure out (and where it's different than popping from a stack). How do I get the header to point to the 'next oldest node', given that I have more than 2 nodes in this queue? I know I can do this if I link header.next to the next node in the queue, but how can I access the next node so that it can point to it?</p>

<p>I thought about how in add(), the newNode.next should point to the next newNode (reverse direction of a Stack), but this can't work because the next newNode isn't in existence yet.. Another idea was to modify the Node class to have a Node.previous for a way to point backwards, but I would be breaking specification for this assignment.</p>

<p>My instructor hinted something about ""header.next will point for second item as header and footer point to first node initially,"" and that the way to do this is pretty simple. However, I've been drawing how this works, and I'm confused how the initial pointing to the same node will allow header.next to ""automatically"" point to the next oldest node, especially if more and more nodes are added and the footer eventually is separated from the header by more than 2 nodes. Is there something about OOP I'm not seeing?</p>

<p>Any help would be great!</p>

<p>So, for given class structure if I generate json (of object of <code>MainClass</code>) using <code>DataContractJsonSerializer</code>, I am getting <strong>Json_String1</strong> and if i directly deserialize, it works fine.</p>

<p>Whereas as while <strong>GET</strong>ting data, response is <strong>Json_String2</strong> ( w/o type hint). Hence, while deserializing I get following error.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eQw0h.jpg"" alt=""Invalid Cast Exception""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>InvalidCastException was unhandled. Unable to cast object of type
  'System.Object' to type 'WpfApplication1.IClass2'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I manually have to modify above json (string manipulation) by adding type hint, to deserialize it successfully.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1) how can I avoid this Json String Manipulation for deserializing ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 2) how can I create json without type hint ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> :
1. Added <strong>IMainInterface</strong> which is implemented by <strong>MainClass</strong>.

<p>To be more precise : I have a set P of k objects.
The problem A answer yes if all these objects are removed, no otherwise.

We have the constraint that at least one objects has to be removed at each step. In worst we make P steps.

<p>I'm working on a project for school, and I'm trying to figure out what the best method would be to solve a problem regarding the filtering/searching of entries in a ListView.</p>

<p>I've currently got a ListView control named <code>lvCard</code> that (at the time it needs to be filtered, after being populated from a JSON file on FormLoad) contains roughly 15000 entries.  It is a multi-column ListView (Detail view), which basically contains every Magic the Gathering card ever made.</p>

<p>I have a searchbox also present named <code>txtSearch</code>.</p>

<p>I understand that basically, I need to have some sort of functionality attached to the ""changed"" event of the search box, but after that, I'm sort of lost.</p>

<p>Currently, all I have is a subroutine I wrote that populates the target ListView when the application starts up, which I guess provides some insight as to how the target ListView is set up, but other than that, I'm really confused, and could use some guidance for sure.</p>

<pre><code>' Render the whole list of stuff
Private Sub RenderList(dict As Dictionary(Of String, Card))

    ' Grab keys into list for sorting
    Dim lstCards As List(Of String) = dict.Keys.ToList
    lstCards.Sort()

    ' iteration
    Dim str As String
    For Each str In lstCards

        Dim CurrentCard As Card = dict(str)

        Dim CurrentPT As String
        If IsNumeric(CurrentCard.power) And IsNumeric(CurrentCard.toughness) Then
            CurrentPT = CurrentCard.power &amp; ""/"" &amp; CurrentCard.toughness
        Else
            CurrentPT = """"
        End If

        ' Build list item

        CurrentItem.SubItems.Add(CurrentCard.manaCost)
        CurrentItem.SubItems.Add(CurrentCard.type)
        CurrentItem.SubItems.Add(CurrentPT)
        lvCard.Items.Add(CurrentItem)

<p>I have tested the example, changed in it only the path in <em>lpSubKey</em> paramater in the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724897(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">RegOpenKeyEx</a> and it is working fine.</p>

<p>Here is the below thread I am trying to create that gives me a pop-up window of: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>r6010 abort()......</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The code:</h2>

<pre><code>#include &lt;thread&gt;

void listenerTest();

void main(){
std::thread threadTest(listenerTest);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    cout &lt;&lt; ""\ntest non thread\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the <code>void listenerTest()</code> is the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724892%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN example</a> with the minor changed I have made.</p>

<p>I also tried other approach, for instance, creating the thread without the <code>WaitForSingleObject()</code> (which gives that error) but I can't find a way to return a <code>HANDLE</code> for <code>WaitForSingleObject()</code> which waits OUTSIDE the thread (in the main).</p>

<p>I don't need synchronization between the <em>threadTest</em> thread and the main thread. All I am trying to achieve is that the <em>threadTest</em> will run for infinite time while main executes.</p>

<p>Any help would be appropriated.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>In my lex program I give some basic values like :</p>

<pre><code>word    [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]*
%%
"":""    return(PV);
{word}  { 
            yylval = yytext;

            return(WORD);
       }
""\n""    return(ENDLINE);
</code></pre>

<p>In my yacc program the beginning of my grammar is (where TranslationUnit is my %start) :</p>

<pre><code>TranslationUnit:
               /* Nothing */
              | InfoBlock Data
              ;

InfoBlock:
           /* Nothing */
         | InfoBlock InfoExpression {}
         ;

InfoExpression:
             WORD PV WORD ENDLINE { printf(""$1 = %s\n"",$1);
 printf(""$2 = %s\n"",$2);
 printf(""$3 = %s\n"",$3);
 printf(""$4 = %s\n"",$4);
                                  }
            | ... /* other things */
            ;

Data:
    ... /* other things */
</code></pre>

<p>When I run my program with input :</p>

<pre><code>keyword : value
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that I would get at least :</p>

<pre><code>$1 = keyword
$2 = keyword // yylval not changed for token PV
$3 = value
$4 = value // yylval not changed for token ENDLINE
</code></pre>

<p>Actually I get :</p>

<pre><code>$1 = keyword : value
$2 = keyword : value
$3 = value
$4 = value
</code></pre>

<p>I do not understand this result. I have studied grammars some time ago and even if I don't remember everything right now, I do not see any important mistake...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>What I am confused about is that it seems ok to do both of these things and both seem logical to me:</p>

<pre><code>/customers/user1/addresses/home
</code></pre>

<p>Equally I could do this and just keep my uri's short:</p>

<pre><code>/addresses/?userId=user1&amp;addressType=home
</code></pre>

<p>So I wonder when do you consider something a resource such as the address in this instance?</p>

<p>And now if the system had orders as well the customer could well have a collection of orders against them, does it matter which is used as if going through the customers controller its heirarchical and going through the order controller it seems to be filtering, or would you support both and have multiple ways of getting the same resource back based on how it was requested (is the url in the browser visible to user or is it an Ajax request):</p>

<pre><code>/customers/user1/orders

/orders/?userId=user1
</code></pre>

<p>I dont know if I am thinking along the wrong lines but it seems logical to me that if I have an order controller, order service, order repository and all return the resource type they are named to deal with. </p>

<p>Opting for the path based approach to getting say an address from the /customers root would indicate that the customer controller is returning address objects.</p>

<p>In practice would I have a uri like the one below mapped to the address controller as it returns addresses?</p>

<pre><code>/customers/userId/addresses/home
</code></pre>

<p>I recently asked a question that was similar to this but it is not the same... I still have some outstanding questions about the path to resources and I hope someone can help me clear up this confusion.</p>

Unfortunately, the kind of reporting purposes that will serve seems to make it necessary to make the repeated calls. Anyway, I have a For loop (which could repeat for up to 700 times) which calls a function and the function, in turn, makes the SOAP call. But I am getting an error about the SOAP call timing out after 30 seconds. Obviously, I need to wait for the next SOAP calls after the first one returned to the calling function. So how to do this. Here is a code fragment:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div style=""-webkit-transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 100, 50);""&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>No matter what I try in terms of CSS, I can't make the inner div ignore the outer transform().  From the spec it seems like -webkit-transform: none should clear the stack of transforms, and/or position: fixed; but nothing works for me.  I've tried related code in Firefox ('transform') with same issue.</p>

<p>Original formulation:  I'm trying to use <a href=""http://bl.ocks.org/patricksurry/6511981"" rel=""nofollow"">D3JS to draw into an SVG container</a> that is set up as a google.maps.OverlayView and positioned directly on top of my google map container, both 600x400 fixed position at top left.  You can see the <a href=""https://gist.github.com/patricksurry/6511981"" rel=""nofollow"">code in gist here</a>.</p>

<p>This works fine until you drag the map, at which point it is repositioning my SVG container, apparently due to the -webkit-transform: matrix(...) in one of the parent divs: if I toggle that line off in Chrome DevTools, my overlayview comes back to the right place.  I need the overlayview to stay aligned with the map viewport, since I am refreshing the content when the map moves.</p>

Depending on the results of <code>main.tcl</code> before running <code>secondary.tcl</code> certain predefined variables in <code>secondary.tcl</code> have to be altered. Then <code>secondary.tcl</code> has to pass some variable to <code>main.tcl</code> to define how to continue.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>#main.tcl

# Here there is first some script which give some results
# Let's say for now result==0 or 1 and some variable ""res"" 

if { result==0 } {
    set var1 $res
} else {
    set var2 $res
}

# Depending on which of the variables is set, the corresponding
# variable should be altered in secondary.tcl

# Now the result in secondary.tcl has to be inserted in this tcl-script
set res_sec $result_secondary

<p>Now i get to a point where i should enable users(future clients) to manage the site creating their <code>menus</code>, <code>routes</code> etc and point it to a real page stored in the database.</p>

<p>i have couple of modules like articles, content , gallery etc.in my project i made a separation between article and page.for the article it's quite straight forward i think.for page it can be tricky.  </p>

<p>So a page is saved in a table (with html tags) and injected in a view.Since there are routes involed i started being confused about how to link menus created with <code>Zend_Navigation</code> and actual page in the database. for example menu like:</p>

<pre><code>about us           products           contact us
the team           productname 1      local
mission statement  productname 2      international
</code></pre>

<p>with different routes like</p>

<pre><code>/about-us          /products/list            /contact-us
/about-us/team     /products/productname1    /contact-us/local
/about-us/mission  /products/productname2    /contact-us/international
</code></pre>

<p>Keeping in mind that all the pages are from a single table and rendered through a single view of PageController?</p>

<p>where are concrete questions:</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong> Can this approach work at all?<br>
<strong>Question 1.1</strong> if not what are better design out there?<br>
<strong>Question 2</strong> where is the Zend_Navigation saved? since there should be a interface for users to modify routes and menus.<br>
<strong>Question 2.1</strong> Is it ok to use Zend_Config_Xml_Writer?<br>
<strong>Question 2.2</strong> if yes is it the best practice?  </p>

<p>I am creating a KML file with a button click and all the code for the KML tags is there. What I need is using more than one  tags. It will be hardcoded in the beginning of the KML. The KML should look something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bZWWZ.jpg"" alt=""KML with 2 Style id""></p>

<p>So this code is generated from the C# code behind. So the question is how to get </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style id= ""randomColorIcon""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and then close the tag properly like /Style without having the id part? </p>

<p>In the C# code I had something like this but I just found that it doesn't read the other Style id tags</p>

<pre><code>kml.WriteStartElement(""Style"");
  kml.WriteElementString(""id"", ""randomColorIcon""); //not suitable for more than one Style tags
  kml.WriteStartElement(""IconStyle"");
  kml.WriteStartElement(""Icon"");
  kml.WriteElementString(""href"",      ""http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/pal3/icon23.png"");
  kml.WriteEndElement(); //&lt;/Icon&gt;
  kml.WriteEndElement(); //&lt;/IconStyle&gt; ??
  kml.WriteEndElement(); //&lt;/Style&gt;

<p>I am implementing a traffic generator which has a client and a server side. The client side simulates devices with unique IP-addresses. These IPs are added as a virtual interface on the client which the simulated device then binds to. The devices will then connect to the server side and generate traffic to/from it.</p>

<p>The problem is that I can only connect with 1023 devices, then the following devices gets a time out on the connect. I have checked in wireshark on the server side and I can see the SYN for the connection but it is never received in the application. When I reuse IPs so that less than 2014 is used I can make as many connections as I want.</p>

<p>I'm running CentOS 7.1 64bit and the Python version I have tested with is 2.7.5.</p>

<p>What I have done so far:<br>
 - Increased the number of open files limit(nofile) to 1040000<br>
 - Increased net.core.somaxconn to 65535<br>
 - Increased net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog and net.core.netdev_max_backlog to 30000<br>
 - Increased core and TCP buffers<br>
 - Disabled firewalls and cleared all iptables rules  </p>

<p>I tested to let the python client sleep one second after each connection and then there was no problem so my guess is that there is some flood protection that kicks in or something. Anyone that has any ideas?</p>

<p>In this block I want to seperate the sub categories</p>

<p>lets say that the parent is Power tools</p>

<p>saws
routers
drills</p>

<p>so the outcome would be something like this...</p>

<p>Power tools
  saws
  routers
  drills</p>

<p>I have the parent category set to display a block, and my existing code will show the sub categories just fine. I get the sub categories output along with their wrapping divs along with the links pointing to the corret subcategory page, but the product lists inside... no joy!</p>

<p>So far I have this for code...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$category = Mage::getSingleton('catalog/layer')-&gt;getCurrentCategory();
$categories = $category-&gt;getCollection()
    -&gt;addAttributeToSelect(array('name', 'thumbnail'))
    -&gt;addAttributeToFilter('is_active', 1)
    -&gt;addIdFilter($category-&gt;getChildren())
?&gt;




&lt;div class="""" style=""width: 90%; float:right;margin-right: 5%;""&gt;
&lt;?php foreach ($categories as $category): ?&gt;

    &lt;div class=""col-xs-12"" style=""border: 2px dotted #3t6; font-size: 2em; margin:1em 0;""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;



    &lt;div class=""col-xs-12"" style=""height:200px; border: 1px solid #333;""&gt;


        &lt;h1&gt;test this&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;?php
        $parent_cat = Mage::getModel('catalog/layer')-&gt;getCurrentCategory();
        $_productCollection = $this-&gt;getLoadedProductCollection();
        $_helper = $this-&gt;helper('catalog/output');
        ?&gt;

        &lt;?php echo $parent_cat-&gt;getid() ; ?&gt;//this shows the correct id

        &lt;?php foreach ($_productCollection as $_product): ?&gt;// start individual products for the sub category
        &lt;?php $_productNameStripped = $this-&gt;stripTags($_product-&gt;getName(), null, true); ?&gt;
               &lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php echo $_helper-&gt;productAttribute($_product, $_product-&gt;getName() , 'name'); ?&gt;&lt;/


        &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;// end product loop for the individual products

    &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I thought the the $this-> might be referencing the previous call for the outside loop (Not sure though if that makes sense) so I tried something like this...</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;?php
        $parent_cat = Mage::getModel('catalog/layer')-&gt;getCurrentCategory();
        $_productCollection = $parent_cat-&gt;getLoadedProductCollection();
        $_helper = $this-&gt;helper('catalog/output');
        ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>no errors but still no joy.</p>

When one is selected, I want to call a certain method based on the type and options chosen on the view. I already have Overloads available for each type of object. I attempted using a generic method, but it proved that the objects were too different to be useable.</p>

<p>I am trying to avoid control coupling with large if statements for maintainability purposed. </p>

<p><strong>Did I go wrong by using the singular interface, or is there an interesting maintainable way of doing this?</strong></p>

<p>I have a datagrid that contains a collection of IDisplayableObject.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDisplayableObject
{
    string Name { get; set; }
    string ID { get; set; }
}

<p>Right now, I cast as the first answer.</p>

<pre><code> public void ExportDashed(string path, IDisplayableObject folder)
    {
        if (folder is TestFolder)
        {
            IndentationTraverse(folder as TestFolder);

<p>I want to avoid the if statements. For this case, I usually use a dictionary mapped to an Action, but I also have another method of </p>

<pre><code>    public void ExportShiftingColumns(string path, IDisplayableObject folder)
    {
        if (folder is TestFolder)

<p>So, I need to make the action, Export Dashed or Export Shifting Columns, then I need to decide which type to export.</p>

When is it actually acceptable to turn off PHP error messages, or to suppress some functions which are throwing warnings, notices for whatever reason..</p>

<p>I understand everyone says that you should turn off error_reporting within a production environment, but that might cause some complications which will not be picked up.. So nothing will get fixed, furthermore. PHP comes with many different methods to control error messages.. For example: </p>

<pre><code>$Var = ""Variable Is Set"";

if (@$Var){ echo $Var; }
</code></pre>

<p>Over: </p>

<pre><code>if (isset($Var)){ echo $Var; }
</code></pre>

<p>Because we have a set variable, this will sucessfully echo.. Whereas if we didn't have a set variable, this would throw a notice.. So Which one to use? The isset or error suppression? </p>

<p>And within a production environment, which one would be more acceptable to use? </p>

<pre><code>error_reporting(0);
</code></pre>

<p>The above will turn off all types of PHP error reporting, giving no error messages even if something is encountered. So in some cases this could lead to broken code that stops working for an unknown reason, due to the message being destroyed </p>

<p>or: </p>

<pre><code>set_error_handler("""");
</code></pre>

<p>The above enables a custom error handler, which can be used to gracefully show a error to the user, and enable administration to log the detailed warning.. But then again, the error_handler to my knowledge will not be called when a fatal error is triggered? </p>

<p>So My overall question?</p>

<p>Handle errors in production environment or just turn them off in general? This boils down to best practices and preferences I guess.. But it's something that is puzzling me and my team to the point of disagreements. </p>

Right now I have a 3D numpy array where the 1st column represents a depth and the 2nd a position on the x-axis. My goal is to make a pcolor where the columns are spread out along the x-axis based on the values in a 1D float array.</p>

<p>Here's where it gets tricky, I only have the relative distances between points. That is, the distance between column 1 and column 2 and so on.</p>

          [3  4  8  4]]

posarray = [ 3.767, 1.85, 0.762]

DesiredArray = [[2  0  0  0  3  0  7  7]
                [4  0  0  0  8  0  2  3]

                [3  0  0  0  4  0  8  4]]
</code></pre>

<p>How I tried implementing it:</p>

<pre><code>def space_set(darr, sarr):
    spaced = np.zeros((260,1+int(sum(sarr))), dtype = float)
    x = 0
    for point in range(len(sarr)):
            spaced[:, x] = darr[:,point]
            x = int(sum(sarr[0:point]))
    spaced[:,-1] = darr[:,-1]

And just for fun, I encode Chinese words to QR code, zxing on Android can recognize it well. However, I tried zxing iPhone app, it fails decoding Chinese (no result after long time, while it only takes 1 second for Android code to return the recognized text). I didn't look at the zxing sdk for IOS yet, just curious why the apps from the same company will behave different on those two platforms, I assume the algorithm should be the same. Thanks!</p>

If i understood correctly, LayoutItemTemplate can be used to set a template for all documents and achorables.</p>

<p>Now here is my issue : I would like to have ""hardcoded"" anchorables templates.
Anchorables all look like this :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;avalonDock:LayoutAnchorable Title=""Dialogs"" 
                             CanClose=""False"" 
                             CanHide=""False"" 
                             CanFloat=""False""&gt;
    &lt;integratorUI:Explorer DataContext=""{Binding Path=Editor.ModelsDialogs}""/&gt;
&lt;/avalonDock:LayoutAnchorable&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On the other side, my central document pane is being fed documents via </p>

<pre><code>DocumentsSource=""{Binding Path=Editor.EditingModelObjects}""
</code></pre>

<p>For those documents, it makes sense to have the template set, so i can use a ContentControl and select the appropriate style like so</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style x:Key=""DocumentStyle"" TargetType=""ContentControl""&gt;
    &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;
        &lt;DataTrigger Binding=""{Binding Path=Type}"" Value=""{x:Static Member=integratorCore:ModelObjectType.Npc}""&gt;
            &lt;DataTrigger.Setters&gt;
                &lt;Setter Property=""Template"" Value=""{StaticResource ResourceKey=NpcViewTemplate}""/&gt;
            &lt;/DataTrigger.Setters&gt;
        &lt;/DataTrigger&gt;
        &lt;DataTrigger Binding=""{Binding Path=Type}"" Value=""{x:Static Member=integratorCore:ModelObjectType.Room}""&gt;
            &lt;DataTrigger.Setters&gt;
                &lt;Setter Property=""Template"" Value=""{StaticResource ResourceKey=RoomViewTemplate}""/&gt;
            &lt;/DataTrigger.Setters&gt;
        &lt;/DataTrigger&gt;
        &lt;DataTrigger Binding=""{Binding Path=Type}"" Value=""{x:Static Member=integratorCore:ModelObjectType.Dialog}""&gt;
            &lt;DataTrigger.Setters&gt;
                &lt;Setter Property=""Template"" Value=""{StaticResource ResourceKey=DialogViewTemplate}""/&gt;
            &lt;/DataTrigger.Setters&gt;
        &lt;/DataTrigger&gt;
    &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is that, setting the LayoutItemTemplate overrides the hardcoded content for my anchorables...</p>

<p>How could I have both hardcoded anchorables and templated documents? Like in the old AvalonDock Versions, or how should I handle this correctly with the new version?</p>

Everything is working fine but the problem is am not able to disable the <code>onclick eventhandler</code> after first click so whenever someone voting a post , he can add vote multiple times. I want to ignore that so i should be able to   vote only once. If i click on vote up then the voteup anchor tag should be disable and votedown anchor tag should be enable. At the same time if i click on the votedown anchor tag then votedown should be disable and voteup should be enable. Also i want to enable the voting feature only if the user is logged in the wordrpess. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I create the response messages using data from multiple cameras. The problem is, that if I run the image grabbing routines too close to each other I get image artifacts, because the USB bus is overloaded. I figured out, that calling the image grabbing sequentially with 0.2 sec delay will solve the problem. The cameras are not sending data the whole time the image grabbing function is running, so the delayed parallel cal result in good images with only a small delay between them.</p>

<pre><code>0 hours 0 minutes 30 seconds

<p>If hours is less than 1 it should be rounded to 0, and the same for minutes. If the difference had minutes and seconds then an example of that would be:</p>

<p>I am the webmaster for a small, growing industrial association. Soon, I will have to implement a restricted, members-only section for the website.</p>

<p>The problem is that our organization membership both includes big companies as well as amateur “clubs” (it's a relatively new industry…).</p>

<p>It is clear that those clubs will share the login ID they will use to log onto our website. The problem is to detect whether one of their members will share the login credentials with people who would not normally supposed to be accessing the website (there is no objection for such a club to have all it’s members get on the website).</p>

<p>I have thought about logging along with each sign-on the IP address as well as the OS and the browser used; if the OS/Browser stays constant and there are no more than, say, 10 different IP addresses, the account is clearly used by very few different computers.</p>

<p>But if there are 50 OS/Browser combination and 150 different IPs, the credentials have obviously been disseminated far, and there would be then cause for action, such as modifying the password. </p>

<p>Of course, it is extremely annoying when your password is being unilaterally changed. So, for this problem, I thought about allowing the “clubs” to manage their own list of sub-accounts, and therefore if abuse is suspected, the user responsible would be easily pinned-down, and this “sub-member” alone would face the annoyance of a password change.</p>

<p><strong>Question:
What potential problems would anyone see with such an approach?</strong></p>

<p>Background is that I need a master service providing WCF services and other management while I would like to present an UI with ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p>Having the ASP.NET web application in a seperate assembly and <em>hosting</em> is started by the <em>main assembly</em> would be acceptable.</p>

<p>Because of the many comments I would like to add:</p>

<p>The system already self-hosts some WCF-services. These could also serve HTML but that would be like reinventing the wheel. I do not like to have IIS as dependency, the application should provide everything out of itself. As the WCF-services uses some endpoint-definitions and <code>ServiceHost</code> it seems tempting to add a required HTML-UI just like other services.</p>

<p>But I am also willing to investigate other methods. But that would mean to have two listeners which seems - not so good.</p>

I've installed the latest versions of Apache, Rails, and Passenger (although to be honest, I'm not quite sure what Passenger gets me) - (I just checked, and Passenger doesn't come up in a gem list, but it is present in mods-enabled).</p>

<p>I've got everything set up, and I can get simple routes working with the appropriate controllers and views.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that it I can only see changes to a view after restarting Apache, so I assume some sort of caching is going on.  I've followed several tips on SO for how to make sure I'm running in development mode, but nothing seems to work.  I've placed a statement in my Apache config file, as well as in my Rails app's environment.rb file.</p>

<p>1) How can I see which mode I'm currently in?
2) How do I change it to whatever I need it to be?</p>

<p>Also, a lot of answers I'm finding are presuming that you're running your app in script/console mode.  I'm working directly on the server via ssh, and I haven't ever had to turn my rails app on using script/console.  It's just there and running.  </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Update: If I print out Rails.env in a view, it lists production. If I fire up rails console on the command line, and print out Rails.env, it lists development.</p>

<p>Many times a given virtual function gets called on the same object over and over; I know that object type doesn't change, and most of the times compiler could easily deduct that has well:</p>

<pre><code>BaseType &amp;obj = ...;
while( looping )
    obj.f(); // BaseType::f is virtual
</code></pre>

<p>To speed up the code I could rewrite the above code like this:</p>

<pre><code>BaseType &amp;obj = ...;
FinalType &amp;fo = dynamic_cast&lt; FinalType&amp; &gt;( obj );
while( looping )
    fo.f(); // FinalType::f is not virtual
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder what's the best way to avoid this overhead due to polymorphism in these cases.</p>

<p>The idea of upper-casting (as shown in the second snippet) doesn't look that good to me: <code>BaseType</code> could be inherited by many classes, and trying to upper-cast to all of them would be pretty prolix.</p>

<p>Another idea could be that of storing <code>obj.f</code> in a function pointer (didn't test this, not sure it would kill run-time overhead), but again this method doesn't look perfect: as the above method, it would require to write more code and it wouldn't be able to exploit some optimizations (eg: if <code>FinalType::f</code> was an inline function, it wouldn't get inlined -- but I guess the only way to avoid this would be to upper-cast <code>obj</code> to its final type...)</p>

<p>So, is there any better method?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Well, of course this is not going to impact that much. This question was mostly to know if there was something to do, since it looks like this overhead is given for free (this overhead looks to be very easy to kill) I don't see why not to.</p>

<p>An easy keyword for little optimizations, like C99 <code>restrict</code>, to tell compiler a polymorphic object is of a fixed type is what I was hoping for.</p>

<p>Anyway, just to answer back to comments, a little overhead is present. Look at this ad-hoc <strong>extreme</strong> code:</p>

<pre><code>struct Base { virtual void f(){} };
struct Final : public Base { void f(){} };

int main( ) {
    Final final;
    Final &amp;f = final;
    Base &amp;b = f;

    for( int i = 0; i &lt; 1024*1024*1024; ++ i )
#ifdef BASE
        b.f( );
#else
        f.f( );
#endif

    return 0;
}

<p>Posts are displaying fine, however, for the Blog page, is_home() is now true!?!. It's URL is unchanged (/news/blog).</p>

<p>A little background: Under the hood I sniff each page to determine what sub nav to display. Since the posts page thinks it's the home page, no sub nav is output, which is not correct.</p>

<p>Why it would lose it's true parent and think that it's the home page now? Is this by design? Any way around this?</p>

<p>Each view controller is linked by a push <code>segue</code>.  using the following method...</p>

<p><code>GameIntroViewController</code> button -> <code>GameViewController</code> programmatically -> <code>GameOverViewController</code> button -> <code>GameViewController</code> and so on....</p>

<p>I've currently set up the app to start playing the background music in my <code>GameIntroViewController</code>, this works well however the music surprisingly re-starts with each segue, whilst this isn't a problem I'd like the music to not restart but continue as if it is one track uninterrupted by segues.</p>

<p>Ultimately I need the music to either pause or stop when <code>GameOverViewController</code> is shown as the music clashes with any video adverts that then play. Would anyone know the best way to do this?</p>

<p>Thinking about it it would be great to have different music on the <code>GameIntroViewController</code> and the <code>GameViewController</code> and then no music on the <code>GameOverViewController</code>.  Any ideas how I can achieve this without the music playing over the top of one another?</p>

<p>from reading around I believe this to be because none of the hadoop compression algorithms can compress the map output from multiple input files. No doubt I will need to compress the output as well but considering that never even starts at the moment I would be happy to make any progress at all.</p>

<p>So now is when I turn to the Internet for help, is there anything else I can do to reduce this footprint, I really need compression because I am dealing with around 20GB input and I only have 50GB to play with on my single node cluster (I am currently doing this in the testing environment, hence the single node and cannot test with more resources until I can show it working because I can't kill the production cluster).</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

I'm happy with the way that it renders strings. What I would like to achieve is to define a ListCellRenderer that maps from Pojos to Strings, so that I can populate the JComboBox with any objects, but display something other than the contents of the toString method.</p>

<p>My best attempt (which works at runtime, but has warnings at compile time) is as follows</p>

<pre><code>import java.awt.Component;

import javax.swing.DefaultListCellRenderer;
import javax.swing.JList;
import javax.swing.ListCellRenderer;

@SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"") 
public class PojoListRenderer&lt;T&gt; implements ListCellRenderer&lt;Object&gt;
{
    public static interface Extractor&lt;T&gt;
    {
         public String extract(T fromThis);  
    }

    private Extractor&lt;T&gt; myExtractor;
    private ListCellRenderer renderer;

    public PojoListRenderer(Extractor&lt;T&gt; extractor, ListCellRenderer parent)
    {
        myExtractor = extractor;
        renderer = parent;
    }
    public PojoListRenderer(Extractor&lt;T&gt; extractor)
    {
        this(extractor, new DefaultListCellRenderer());
    }

    @Override
    public Component getListCellRendererComponent(JList&lt;?&gt; list,
        Object value, int index, boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus)
    {
        String s = myExtractor.extract((T)value);
        return renderer.getListCellRendererComponent(list, s, index, isSelected, cellHasFocus);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>which could then be used as follows:</p>

<pre><code>//Assume a class called Notification with methods name() and severity()
JComboBox myNotificationBox = ...;
myNotificationBox.setRenderer
(
     new PojoListRenderer&lt;Notification&gt;
     (
          (notification) -&gt; notification.name() + ""/"" + notifiation.severity(),
          myNotification.getRenderer()
     )
);
</code></pre>

<p>This approach is nice because it means I get all of the highlighting/selection/etc for the default ListCellRenderer of the ComboBox, but I can use the ComboBox as the canonical holder of the domain objects and still have them displayed nicely.</p>

<p>The down side is that the above is clearly not type-safe.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this even a sane way to approach this problem (it seems like it to me)</li>
<li>Have I missed something obvious in the Swing libraries (since this seems like pretty obvious functionality)</li>
<li>Can anyone suggest how to keep the above functionality while also eliminating compiler warnings (and making the above type-safe)</li>
</ol>

My collegue created some java classes and for now we use them in a DOS windows and a .bat.</p>

<p>My boss asked me if it was possible to use these java classes with PHP Soap.
I know PHP but I never used Soap, so i'm kinda stuck.</p>

<p>For example, we have a java class to read some objects with 3 arguments.
We had imagine in PHP to create a form with 3 fields, retrieve those 3 fields then call the java class (example : readO($var1, $var2, $var3)).</p>

<p>Is this possible to do that with PHP Soap with minimum change from java class ?</p>

This works fine, however i would like a small adjustment that i can't seem to figure out due to my limited knowledge of Javascript/jQuery.</p>

<p>When #c1's option ""meta"" is selected, i would like to show #c2 as with any other option, but i would like #c2 to have an aditional option.</p>

&lt;option&gt;Option 2, etc.&lt;/option&gt;

<p>I'm trying to write a C++ variant class to emulate a stictly-typed union without restrictions for MSVS2012 (which is lacking one from the standard). I know that there are lots of variant implementations for C++, but reinventing stuff is fun. And there is some academic interest in the underlaying problem, anyway.</p>

<p>Below is the code - it's a bit over-complicated to my taste due to two points:</p>

<ol>
<li>That's for MSVC 2012 which lacks a number of most-crucial parts of C++11 standard for such a task, like variadic templates or constructor inheritance</li>
<li>I failed to came up with a way to make dedicated copy/move constructors without creating ambiguous overload with templated variants. I've tried to make a std::enable_if check to prevent templated constructors spawning for derived/same types as the variant itself, but it seems to prevent MSVC implicit conversion. So I've moved the check for derived class (variant itself copy/move, not an initialization by copy/move of one of the types) into helper structs.</li>
</ol>

<p>The code below is somewhat shortened version without accessors (they are trivial anyway), some checks and namespaces, for the sake of less noise. The problem, which is explained in more detail below the code, isn't present on MSVC though (it works there surprisingly flawlessly), but happens with clang and libstdc++ STL library (the GNU implementation from gcc-4.9.2). And only if I'm trying to put unique_ptr's within the Variant and place it into the std::vector.</p>

<p>the item was successfully constructed into the variant as it should be, but then it seems to attempt an ""uninitiliazed_copy"" of some kind the new item for some reason, calling the copy/move-constructor again, but with a non-const reference this time. Why emplace_back makes a copy at all?</p>

<p>Obviously my fabolus check for ""same type"" (i.e. detecting a whole-variant copy/move attempt to trigger the more complex find-out-what-type-we-are logic) fails when it receives a reference type. Well, that's logical.</p>

<p>Alright, I've attempted to hack-around this by placing decaying a type within the check</p>

<p>Well, that's logical too. Of course, I may implement a couple more complex checks for reference types here, but this will only increase the already complex code and, more importantly, I don't clearly understand what I'm gonna do with a lvalue reference - convert it into rvalue and process with move semantic, maybe...</p>

<p>So, my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I doing all this wrong? Is there any easier way, possibly by using more explicit functions? Or maybe I should use a non-qualified template types (template  Vector(T something)) and then check for constness (copy vs move), references and types?</li>
<li>What is happening within vector and what is the right way to react to such things?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Input</strong>: A 64-bit number <em>n</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Output</strong>: True if <em>n</em> is in the array, false if <em>n</em> is not.</p>

<p>What are good techniques for making binary searches fast, given the possibility to optimize for the specific elements and their distribution.</p>

<h2>Specifics</h2>

<p>I have an array with around 136 members (though see below: there's some flexibility) to search.  The members are not equally distributed through the range: they cluster toward the beginning and end of the range.  The input numbers can be assumed to the chosen with uniform probability.  It's probably worthwhile to take advantage of this irregularity.</p>

<p>Here's a sample picture of the distribution for the 136-element array.  Note that <em>only 12 of the 136 elements</em> are between 1% and 99% of the range; the balance are below 1% or over 99%.</p>

<p><img src=""http://math.crg4.com/distribution.png""></p>

<p>I assume that branch misprediction will be the largest cost of any implementation.  I'd be happy to be proved wrong.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>*
Actually, I have two arrays.  Actually actually, I have a choice of what arrays to use: efficiency suggests that the first should have perhaps 10-40 members, while the second can have no more than (exactly) 136 members.  My problem gives real flexibility in selecting sizes, along with limited freedom to decide precisely which members to use.  If a method performs better with certain sizes or restrictions, please mention this because I may be able to use it.  All things equal, I'd prefer to have the second array as large as possible.

<p>Here is the SVG I'm using.  (created on <a href=""http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/</a>)  This is just a simple arrow or tag I'm going to use to point at stuff and label stuff.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" version=""1.1"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" viewBox=""0 0 200 100"" width=""100%"" height=""100%""&gt;

<p>I need to figure out how to pass the width, height, and fill parameters, so I can set the size and color of the tag.</p>

<p>Wikicode doesn't work from what I've tried, so I've enabled raw html and I'm calling it like this.</p>

Right now I'm using devexpress, because we're already using other devexpress controls (but this could change if a jquery library would be easier!!)</p>

<p>I'm <strong>stuck with the validation aspect</strong>. Frankly, the entire process seems quite hard for what I'm trying to achieve.</p>

<p>Anyways, let me describe the process that I've currently worked out:</p>

<p>-The <strong>Index page contains an overview of the different elements</strong> that can be updated. Using a HtmlExtension, I was able to create a devexpress popup which loads the edit page when you open the popup. => <strong>@Html.PopupControl().WithText(""Edit"").PopupGoesTo(Url.Action(""EditPopup"", etc etc)</strong></p>

<p>-The edit page -which is just a partial view- works just fine.
I've created a little test page, which contains 1 textbox, which takes in a decimal.</p>

<p>I want to submit the form using ajax (because frankly, I have no idea how I can show the validation if I do a full post back, since I need to be able to create the popup and bind the data to it AND trigger the validation errors).</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function EndPopUpUpdate(message) {
        if (message.url) {
            window.locatin.href = url;
        }
        $(""#submitButtonPopUp, #loadingPopUp"").toggle();
    }

    function BeginPopUpUpdate() {
        $(""#submitButtonPopUp, #loadingPopUp"").toggle();
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

using (Ajax.BeginForm(""Edit"", ""xxx"", new AjaxOptions {  UpdateTargetId = ""PopUpDiv"", HttpMethod = ""Post"", OnBegin = ""BeginPopUpUpdate"", OnComplete = ""EndPopUpUpdate""}, new { id = ""PopUpForm"" }))
    {
        &lt;div id=""PopUpDiv""&gt;
            @Html.Partial(""EditPopup"", new xxxViewModel())
        &lt;/div&gt;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to achieve validation when I postback by manually rehooking the jquery events (because these don't get hooked since the page gets loaded dynamicly)</p>

<pre><code>function ReconnectValidation() {
    $(""#PopUpForm"").ready(function () {
        $.validator.unobtrusive.parse(""#PopUpForm"");
    });

    $(""#submitButton"").click(function (e) {
        var form = $(""#PopUpForm"");
        if (!form.valid()) {
            e.preventDefault();
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>So this handles my client side validation, which works.</p>

<p>Now, my actual problem! Server side validation.</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public ActionResult Edit([ModelBinder(typeof(CommandModelBinder))] UpdateCommand command)
    {
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            //using the command pattern
            var handlerResult = HandlerLocator.GetQueryHandler&lt;IGetOverviewHandler&gt;().Execute(..);
            return PartialView(""EditPopUp"", handlerResult.ViewModel);
        }

        HandlerLocator.GetCommandHandler&lt;UpdateCommand&gt;().Handle(command);
        var returnLink = Url.Action(""Index"", new {..});
        return Json(new { url = returnLink }, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I've written a CustomModelBinder, which does nothing but look for the properties in my command object (my return model if you will) and looks in the formcollection if it can find a matching object with the same name. Then it tries to convert it and it binds a ModelError to my ModelState if it fails.</p>

<p>So, now we have a ModelState which is either valid or is invalid.
If it's valid, I want to redirect to the Index (so my overview can update). I've read that I should handle this in the client side, because the ajax.BeginForm is going to replace the
""PopUpDiv""-div with the result (which just creates the same page within my page).</p>

<p>Here is the onComplete event:</p>

<pre><code>function EndPopUpUpdate(message) {
            if (message.url) {
                window.locatin.href = url;
            }
            $(""#submitButtonPopUp, #loadingPopUp"").toggle();
        }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem is, that I don't receive a json message, but I receive a PartialView.</strong> This means I can't access the message.url..because that's not what I recieve :/</p>

<p>So that is problemo number 1</p>

<p>If the object is not valid, I want to return a partialview with the model and give an error to the user. <strong>When I return the partialview, it just replaces the current view but it doesn't show any validation errors</strong>..</p>

<p>That is problem number 2 :)</p>

<p>Also, if you know a better way to solve this problem, please don't hesitate to respond (because this method just seems really convoluted for what it does -or should do-)</p>

<p>Sorry for the lengthy post, but I hope everything is clear.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help &amp; time!</p>

In the config section in the administrator panel, we've make sure that the timezone was matching with php.ini.</p>

If you save a content publish date to 2014-05-28 02:34:00, in MYSQL and in the frontend, it will show 2014-05-28 11:34:00.</p>

<p>This is a timezone issue for sure, but I can't find where I did wrong.</p>

- Check in each user profile to set timezone to default.</p>

    bool operator() (const Player &amp;left, const Player &amp;right)

<p>I have read that this happens when there are too many connections, which mysql fails to handle. But why does this not happen with PgSql then?</p>

<p>I have an application where I need timestamped event. I store everything in UTC. However, I want to display (client-side) the date, neither in the user locale nor in UTC, but in a given timezone (namely, the Paris timezone).</p>

<p>Since there is no javascript way to do it easily (we would have to know the exact daylight saving time events using something like timezone.js which seems overkill), I wanted to do the following trick:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the UTC date <code>dutc=datetime(…,&lt;UTC&gt;)</code></li>
<li>convert it to paris date <code>dparis=datetime(…,&lt;Paris&gt;)</code></li>
<li>force the tzinfo back to UTC to get an UTC timestamp corresponding to the date &amp; time in Paris (eg. the same numerical date &amp; time, but with UTC rather than Paris, without adding or removing hours)</li>
<li>storing this UTC date as a timestamp so the client could parse it as a ""fake UTC "" timestamp, and display the ""fake time  ""</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I don't get back my original timestamp</p>

<pre><code>import datetime
import time
import pytz
utc = pytz.UTC
paris = pytz.timezone('Europe/Paris')
t = 1372982409 # timestamp in UTC

dutc = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(t, utc) # date in UTC
# datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9, tzinfo=&lt;UTC&gt;)

dparis = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(t, paris) # date in Paris time
# datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 5, 2, 0, 9, tzinfo=&lt;DstTzInfo 'Europe/Paris' CEST+2:0
0:00 DST&gt;)

dparisasutc = dparis.replace(tzinfo=utc) # force the date in UTC time
# datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 5, 2, 0, 9, tzinfo=&lt;UTC&gt;)

t0 = time.mktime(dparisasutc.timetuple())
# 1372986009.0

<p>My idea is to have a controller for each state of any part of the site (an example would be the right column, it would have 3 states; new posts, related posts, and search filters).  I would also have the content area be many different states aswell (things like search results, view post, new posts, etc).</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't find a way to take multiple controller outputs and compile it into a single template (notice, I said controllers, not views).</p>

FROM INSERTED
</code></pre>

<p>But, every once in while, I'll get a PK violation on dbo.AddressHistory complaining about a duplicate PK being inserted. How is this possible if part of the PK for AddressHistory is the current timestamp of the insertion?</p>

<p>Even executing this will insert two rows into the history table successfully:</p>

The following sample generates CS0051:</p>

<p>That is a simple example.  The actual program is a bit more complicated.  I am actually using a node in a linked list to pass to the method
LinkedListNode node</p>

<p>The method uses recursion because the node is mart of a huge linked list structure of linked lists that outputs an xml file.
Either I have to find a way to use recursion without using methods or I need to find a way to pass pointers nodes or actual nodes.</p>

<p>This configuration has been working for some time using ""ndk-build"" and Eclipse.  Though it probably isn't the ""best"" implementation, the way I did it was to first build the various versions of ""libNative.so"" and copy them into the ""libs"" sub-folder of the ""MyLibrary"" project folder.  When building ""MyLibrary"" with Eclipse, the native code is automatically linked to by the Java code.</p>

<p>I can then copy the same above .so files (one in a folder for each cpu architecture) into the ""libs"" folder of any Android applicatin project built with Eclipse or the ""jniLibs"" folder of an app built with Android Studio.</p>

<p>Finally, I copy ""MyLibrary.jar"" from the ""bin"" folder of that project into the same ""libs"" folder as above for Eclipse projects, or the top-level ""libs"" folder for an Android Studio app.</p>

<p>After these steps, any consuming application I've tested has built just fine.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I want to migrate my build process completely over to Android Studio.  Based on what I've studied, it seems I should keep building my C++ code with ""ndk-build"" since it works so well.  The question is what to do about that ""MyLibrary"" project.</p>

<p>Ideally I could make a standalone ""library-only"" Android Studio project for ""MyLibrary"" and place the .so files in the ""jniLibs"" folder there.  While I've found a number of hack-arounds to force Android Studio to build a Project containing only one Module (a LIBRARY module), they all have weird quirks or just didn't actually work for me.</p>

<p>On top of that, I need to link ""MyLibrary"" with ""libNative.so"" and that doesn't appear to happen automatically.  So my first question is how to force that linkage to happen as desired.</p>

<p>My second question is should I be building ""MyLibrary.jar"" or ""MyLibrary.aar""?  The latter is default of course, but it won't automatically link like a .jar file does when placed in the consuming app's ""libs"" folder.</p>

<p>Will/can the .aar version CONTAIN the .so files?  That would certainly be convenient for consumers of my library.  How does a consuming application actually consume this type of library?</p>

<p>There's probably a bunch of gradle magic involved, but one thing I do NOT want to do is force Maven down everyone's gullets just so they can use my library.</p>

The odd behaviour I am referring to is this: the first function runs perfectly and provides the expected output while the second one crushes with a segfault. 
I know where the mistake is - I did not allocate memory for k before copying (obviously, after fixing, both variants work well), yet I was hoping someone could tell me what happened and why I did't get an error for the first one. Thanks!</p>

I have found that FileHelpers is perfect for reading csv files, but it seems you cannot use it unless you know the ordering of the columns before compiling the application. I want to know if its at all possible to use FileHelpers in a non-typed way. Currently I am using it to read the file but then everything else I am doing by hand, so I have a class:</p>

<pre><code>[DelimitedRecord("","")]
public class CSVRow
{
    public string Content { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which means each row is within <code>Content</code>, which is fine, as I have then split the row etc, however I am now having issues with this method because of commas inherent within the file, so a line might be:</p>

<pre><code>""something"",,,,0,,1,,""something else"","""","""",,,""something, else""
</code></pre>

<p>My simple split on commas on this string doesnt work as there is a comma in `""something, else"" which gets split. Obviously here is where something like FileHelpers comes in real handy, parsing these values and taking the quote marks into consideration. So is it possible to use FileHelpers in this way, without having a known column definition, or at least being able to pass it a csv string and get a list of values back, or is there any good library that does this?</p>

I've been working on a patching system, and I think I have the coding all correct but  can't test it because a lot of the functions are trying to process all at once when they need to be processing in an order. The program doesn't even let the display shown up before it starts trying to process everything. Because none of them return a value other then the main function all the functions are set to void. I thought about maybe using a return value inside of a loop to make sure the program is finished with that step first before moving on but it still leaves the problem of the program not even showing up until everything is done processing which its suppose to show the progress of everything.

This helped with development by e.g. letting me pull sqlite files to make sure my DB code was doing what I thought it should be doing, accessing the sqlite files from the Linux command line.</p>

<p>A few days ago I came to my desk and found the tab in a strange state:  as if stuck in the boot process, and warm to the touch, suggesting that the CPU was spinning.</p>

<p>I assumed it was a crash, rebooted it and thought nothing more of it until, earlier today, I can no longer get DDMS access to /data.  /system and /mnt are accessible.</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of what might have caused that change, and if/how it can be reversed?  I had not rooted the tab before, and although I understand rooting it may bring back access to /data (over DDMS?) I'd rather try to understand what happened before proceeding.</p>

<p>This is done using the new API <code>application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:</code> and the fact that the session's delegate will eventually get the callbacks and can complete its task.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering how to use it with <code>AFNetworking 2.0</code> (if possible) to continue downloadin in background.  </p>

<p>The problem is, <code>AFNetworking 2.0</code> conveniently uses block based API to do all the requests, but if the app terminated or crashes those block are also gone.  So how can I complete the task?  </p>

<p>Or maybe I'm missing something here...  </p>

<p><strong>Let me explain what I mean</strong>  </p>

<p>For example my app is a photo messaging app, lets say that I have a <code>PhotoMessage</code> object that represent one message and this object has properties like<br>
<code>state</code> - describe the state of the photo download.<br>
<code>resourcePath</code> - the path to the final downloaded photo file.</p>

<p>So when I get a new message from the server, I create a new <code>PhotoMessage</code> object, and start downloading its photo resource.</p>

<pre><code> PhotoMessage *newPhotoMsg = [[PhotoMessage alloc] initWithInfoFromServer:info];
 newPhotoMsg.state = kStateDownloading;

 self.photoDownloadTask = [[BGSessionManager sharedManager] downloadTaskWithRequest:request progress:nil destination:^NSURL *(NSURL *targetPath, NSURLResponse *response) {
        NSURL *filePath = // some file url
        return filePath;
    } completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSURL *filePath, NSError *error) {
        if (!error) {
            // update the PhotoMessage Object
            newPhotoMsg.state = kStateDownloadFinished;
            newPhotoMsg.resourcePath = filePath;
        }
    }];

    [self.photoDownloadTask resume];   
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I use the completion block to update that <code>PhotoMessage</code> object according to the response I get.    </p>

<p>How can I accomplish that with a background transfer? This completion block won't be called and as a result, I can't update the newPhotoMsg.</p>

<p>This way I handle the compile time exclusion, the runtime log level and the fatal conditions in a very consistent way.</p>

<p>It would probably be adapted for streams with the &lt;&lt; operator.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<pre><code>//not compiled
Log&lt;LogLevel::Verbose&gt;(""Something to much usual"");
</code></pre>

<p>Will this actually result in a NOOP by most compilers? Will the string exist in the code?</p>

<p>Is this approach a bad idea?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In kernel mode, the CPU may perform any operation allowed by its architecture ..................</p>
  
  <p>In the other CPU modes, certain restrictions on CPU operations are enforced by the hardware. Typically, certain instructions are not permitted (especially those—including I/O operations—that could alter the global state of the machine), some memory areas cannot be accessed</p>

<p>Does it mean that instructions such as <code>LOAD</code> and <code>STORE</code> are prohibited? or does it mean something else? </p>

<p>I am asking this because on a pure <code>RISC</code> processor, the only instructions that should access IO/memory are <code>LOAD</code> and <code>STORE</code>. A simple program that evaluates some arithmetic expression will thus need supervisor mode to read its operands.</p>

The Flash client is a variation of <a href=""https://github.com/sythoos/jRecorder"">jrecorder</a>. When the user is done recording the audio is uploaded using a POST request (not a form because Flash cannot create files) with the audio ByteArray as the data of the POST request (see more <a href=""https://github.com/sythoos/jRecorder/blob/master/flash-fla/Main.as#L177-207"">here</a>).</p>

<p>I am able to receive the file correctly on Node-land using the code below but the audio that comes out is mangled and you cannot hear anything. With that said, the content of the file can be played by VLC and other players + Sox is able to encode it as an mp3.</p>

<p>Here is my code when using Node:</p>

<pre><code>var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.use (function(req, res, next) {
    req.rawBody = '';
    req.setEncoding('utf8');

    if(req.method.toLowerCase() == ""post"")
    {
        req.on('data', function(chunk) { req.rawBody += chunk });
        req.on('end', function() { done(req, res); });
    }

    next();
});

function done(req, res)
{

        if (err) throw err;

        // Save file to S3
    }   
}

<p>Now if I use the same Flash client and make the POST request to a Rails server and use the code below, the file is saved perfectly.</p>

<pre><code>def record
    file = request.raw_post

    # Save file to S3
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I am not a Node expert so please if you have any suggestions on what should I use instead of saving the chunks please post code examples. My main purpose right now is to get this to a working state before exploring other way of accomplishing more efficiently in Node (buffers, streams, etc)</p>

<p>When I was learning ASP.NET a year back, I have been told <strong>""It is costlier to connect and grab data from database, so make as much less connection as possible and re-use the retrieved data effectively""</strong>.   The reasons given are</p>

<ol>
<li>A connection to the DB server first needs to be established.</li>
<li>The concurrent connections on DB server will be less compared to IIS.</li>
<li>Use disconnected architecture so that connection can be closed soon (ofcourse other flexibilites are also there)
etc, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>And when my study expanded, I learnt other measures of storing data once retrieved from DB, across postbacks.  But now, I'm learning one by one that they are costlier than connecting to DB. like...</p>

<ol>
<li>Session Variables : Memory size bubbles with number of users</li>
<li>View State  : The process of encryption and travel makes it costlier.</li>
<li>Application Variables : Not so useful in all circumstances.</li>
<li>Cache   : (I know them, but not used them till now).</li>
</ol>

<p>Also Oflate, I'm repeatedly advaised not to store retrieved tables in session, view state etc., but to connect to DB and grab it afresh on each postback.</p>

<p>And viewing this in light of SQL Server based Session State management, where the Framework itself used DB to store session.  <strong>I feel, I should unlearn my initial learning and perception about database connectivity.</strong></p>

<p>What do you say ???</p>

<p>Now when i compile, i receive an error where it says something about ""no type named value_type in struct std::iterator_traits, which is weird as my other types of constructors such as a the fill and copy constructor is fine. In addition, i also noticed that the compiler deduced the ""InputTterator"" type to be of ""int"" instead of ""int*"". </p>

<p>I've been pulling my hair out for the past few hours trying to debug it, but just cant seem to find any solution. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry! mistake on my part. It was not intentional to send 2 ints as part of the template parameters. I have edited the code above. It now has a proper fill ctor and a range ctor. The main function now creates 2 vectors based on these ctors. The errors still remain. Again, huge mistake on my part!</p>

But, according to this link: 
<a href=""http://diveintopython3.ep.io/case-study-porting-chardet-to-python-3.html#multifile-modules"" rel=""nofollow"">A Short Digression Into Multi-File Modules</a>, if I put all my files in the same ""package"": </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the entire collection of files is presented to other Python code as a single module — as if all the functions and classes were in a single .py</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now I thought that my whole understanding of the python ""package"" thing was wrong. Moreover - it's entirely not a package, rather a ""multifile module"" as the author refers to it.</p>

<p>So, from what I understood, no matter to how many files I divide my funcs and classes inside a package, from the outside that package should appear as though I took all the code from all the files inside the package and put it in one big file with the same name as the package instead, i.e as one module.</p>

<p>e.g, if I have the following file structure:</p>

<pre><code>/base
    /animals
        /__init__.py
        /dog.py
</code></pre>

<p>and in dog.py:</p>

<pre><code>def bark():
    print ""woof""
</code></pre>

<p>it should be exactly the same as having:</p>

<pre><code>/base
    /animals.py
</code></pre>

<p>and in animals.py:</p>

<pre><code>def bark():
    print 'woof'
</code></pre>

<p>thus, this next piece of code should run fine on both cases:</p>

<pre><code>from base import animals
animals.bark()
</code></pre>

<p>This of course yields in the first case:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;console&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'bark'
</code></pre>

<p>What am I missing here? I see by the exception that ""animals"" is indeed treated as a module, but it appears i still have to explicitly state <code>animals.dog.bark</code>, i.e the internal file structure of the package isn't abstracted from the outside.</p>

<p>Am I missing the author's point, or just not implementing it correctly?</p>

<p><b>=== EDIT ===</b></p>

<p>Just to make sure no one misses this line in the quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>as if all the <b>functions</b> and <b>classes</b> were in a single .py</p>
</blockquote>

For example, if I override the DB_Table delete() method to merely flag deleted records, will I need to do the same thing in DB_Table_Row?  Or does row proxy to table?</p>

<p>If proxying is in place, in which direction does it occur?  (Row proxies to table?)  And for which methods?  (Row delete() and save() -to- table delete(), update() and insert()?)</p>

<p>I realise I could test this myself but chance are you will be a lot faster (if you don't already know the answer...)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The reason for the question is that I am developing some models which will include ACL.  Since I have ACL in controllers too, I am planning only to override selected methods in the DB classes.  For example, I want to ensure that a Member can delete their own record only.  (I think I need to use ACL asserts to do this).</p>

<p>So I was asking the question above in order to determine whether I had to override pairs of methods (i.e. one in the Table class, one in the Row class), or whether I could just override one.  Judging by the responses, however, I'm now wondering whether I'm asking the wrong question.</p>

<p>How do experienced developers deal with this kind of situation?  Perhaps you choose to work with just one delete method (e.g. from the Row class).  (Ditto for the update method too).  If so, do you override the Table class delete to prevent inadvertant usage?</p>

<p>I am curious...  Thanks...</p>

</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, I have written a simple jQuery plugin which appends a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to the current value of <code>this</code>.</p>

<p>Now, after I click on an element and add some <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, I realize that the click handler in not associated with the newly appended elements. This seems perfectly acceptable since naturally when the handler function was bound, it was to only the ones that existed and hence were present in the <code>$('div')</code> object.</p>

<p>Now, I know that binding the handler to all <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements within the plugin is as simple as follows.</p>

<pre><code>(function ($) {
  $.fn.addDiv = function () {
    this.append('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
    $('div').click(function () {
      $('body').addDiv();
    }); // added this statement
    return this;
  };
}(jQuery));
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm sure that there is a better way to handle such event binding. This clearly duplicates code. <strong>So what is the best practice with regards to such event binding to elements that the plugin itself adds?</strong></p>

<p><em>This is meant to be an educational example, please do not consider it to be any kind of use case and give me alternative solutions. Thank you, in advance.</em></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I know that some people recommend the use of <code>.selector</code> but it is deprecated in jQuery 2. Also, using it doesn't change the fact that the event handling code is still duplicated within the plugin.</p>

<p>A Github link is included, just git clone, maven clean package, and deploy to a suitable server such as Jetty, you can see all these traces in action.  </p>

I'm dealing with similar situation like at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6061292/how-can-i-pass-complex-objects-as-arguments-to-a-restful-service"">How can I pass complex objects as arguments to a RESTful service?</a> , but actually the injection of my custom XML objects if injected all right, IF i do not annotate method parameter with @Form.</p>

<p>This is wrapper request object to injection:</p>

<pre><code>@XmlRootElement(name = ""request"")
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
@XmlType
@Consumes({""application/xml"", ""application/json""})
public class TestRequest {
    @PathParam(value = ""value"")
    private String value;  // this is injected only when @Form param is added to the method parameter definition

    @XmlElement(type = Test.class)
    private Test test; // this is XML object I want to inject from the REST request

    @XmlElement
    private String text; // or inject other XML element like this
}
</code></pre>

<p>So this would inject me REST parameters (e.g. {value} - @PathParam(""value"") annotated in TestRequest).
BUT this doesn't unmarshall the XML object Test in wrapper object TestRequested. </p>

<pre><code>@POST
@Path(""tests/{value}"")
@Consumes(""application/xml"")
@Produces(""application/xml"")    
public void addTest(**@Form** TestRequest req);
</code></pre>

<p>And following definition would inject only the XML object Test but doesn't inject the REST annotations (e.g. {value} from URI):</p>

<pre><code>public void addTest(TestRequest req);  // without @Form annotation now
</code></pre>

<p>2) I also tried another approach by catching request to custom MessageBodyReader implementation but have been lost in the details where to find code, method or class of JAX-RS or RESTEasy that actually does this parsing/injecting of REST annotations(@PathParam, @QueryParam,...).</p>

<p>I also noticed that when there is @Form annotation in method definition, then custom MessageBodyReader isn't even catched (propably built-in one for REST parameters catches that request and custom reader is then ignored). </p>

<p>I could in this custom message body reader solution somehow call that built-in injection provider but i didn't find suitable documentation and it seems I'm doing something wrong and all can be done more simplier some other way.</p>

<hr>

<p>To summarise the goal: inject both REST parameters (@PathParam, @QueryParam etc.) and custom XML/JSON objects somehow in one request in ONE wrapper object. 
(It works with one wrapper object annotated @Form and the other parameter to be without @Form annotation, but I would like to have all in one wrapper object).</p>

<p>Thank you for any insights or help.</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand exactly how it works so that I can modify the behavior. Right now, if I have a standard JTextPane inside a JScrollPane, it will break text at spaces, but not inside long words - if there is a string of text without spaces that is wider than the window, it won't wrap/break and a horizontal scrollbar will appear. As the text width increases, the width of the ParagraphView (via getWidth()) increases to hold the text.</p>

<p><a href=""http://java-sl.com/wrap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article by Lapitsky</a> says that LabelView.getBreakWeight() returns View.ExcellentBreakWeight for labels with spaces and View.GoodBreakWeight for labels without spaces (and the code in GlyphView.java seems to confirm this), so why doesn't it break? Is it somehow returning BadBreakWeight instead of GoodBreakWeight? Or is there some layout problem? Or is there a bug?</p>

<p>Here's some code (for your viewing pleasure):</p>

<pre><code>//somewhere inside JPanel or JFrame constructor
JTextPane textPane = new JTextPane();
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(textPane);
add(scrollPane);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it still doesn't wrap if I take out the scroll pane and just use the text pane (it just gets clipped as it goes outside the window).</p>

<hr>

<p>The javadocs for Swing don't seem to go into enough detail on how some objects (like JTextPane, View's, and related objects) work together. Is there any further documentation of the design of such classes, perhaps detailing the purpose of each class and how they all work together? Is it just not publicly available? (Or am I the only one having trouble with things like this? Or is the insufficient documentation limited to things which aren't expected to be dealt with by a typical developer?)</p>

<p>I have already created models for the tables. I'm using Zend Framework v1, without an ORM, but this question should apply for all model implementations.</p>

<p>Now I want to create a function that allows me to grab by <code>id</code>:</p>

<p>The reason for this approach was twofold. Firstly, form input, including numbers, is often read from the view as a string. Secondly, invalid strings (such as <code>'asdf'</code>) would become zero after casting, thereby causing the exception to fire. However, there are many invalid strings that may still bypass the check:</p>

<pre><code>echo intval('1asdf');
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>Other approaches I have tried include:</p>

<pre><code>if (intval($id) === 0)

if ($id == intval($id))
</code></pre>

<p>What is the best way to validate the id in the model? I want it to accept integers greater than 0, and strings that are valid positive integers. </p>

<p>I would prefer something with a very low time cost. This is the reason I am not using regex to validate. These calls will be used everywhere in the application, and I cannot afford the overhead.</p>

"8174645","1","","","2011-11-17 21:34:06","","2","817","<p>I have the following WPF user interface: A listview that is bound to a collection.  There is a datatemplate that shows the particular data for each item in that collection.  The data template uses a stack panel to show the fields as well as owning the binding group.  For each of the items, a user will enter information and it will be validated.  If it fails, the error information is shown within the stack panel.  In addition to showing the errors here, I want to be able to mark the host ListView with some sort of information that there is a problem.  That way, I can affect the rest of the user interface basd on whether there is an error or not.  If I move the Binding Group up to the ListView, I will acheive that.  However, I will lose the stackpanel being able to show the errors.</p>

<p>In summary, I want to be able to propogate the error details (or at least a flag indicating an error) from the data template up to the host object (a list view in my case).

In my test runs <strong><em>numMyElements*numRows = 235074</em></strong> . The line of code above gets called in a constructor for an object and <strong><em>double* myA</em></strong> is a member of that class. I am using:</p>

<p>My problem is that each time I load in a new image the memory usage goes up but never comes back down. This happens when i run it as an .exe or in editor. When I run it in editor the memory usage doesn't go down even when I stop running it, I have to manually exit the unity editor and restart it. If I go back to an image I've seen the memory doesn't increase, so I know that it's keeping these images in memory and I don't know how to remove them.</p>

<p>I have checked all the resources I can find about this online and have followed and changed as much as I can but my problem is still happening. Any help would be great.</p>

<p>I added the code that loads and sets the texture as the main texture below. the memory leak does not happen when I comment out the LoadImageIntoTexture line.</p>

<p>I've now caught it in the act, but I'm not sure how to proceed. I've halted the test, and taken a screendump of the state of my queues. I'm no expert at thread/queue/deadlock debugging, but nothing here looks out of the ordinary to me. Does anybody else see anything to follow here?</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I've also tried sampling the process (using Activity Monitor) while it's in this state. To me, it looks unsurprisingly similar to what Xcode is showing me:</p>

        int width, height;
        int length;

        // ---

        ~dyMatrix() {
            delete[] mat;
        };
};
</code></pre>

<p>To test it, and compare with static multi-dimensional arrays, I wrote the following snippet of code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

/* matrix class goes here */

struct Coord {
    int x, y;

    Coord()
        : x(0), y(0)
    {};

    Coord (int _x, int _y)
        : x(_x), y(_y)
    {};

    void print() {
        cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "", "" &lt;&lt; y;
    };
};

int main() {
    dyMatrix&lt;Coord&gt; adabo(5, 7);
    Coord inakos[5][7];

    int i = 5, j = 0;

    adabo(i, j) = *(new Coord(i, j));
    inakos[i][j] = *(new Coord(i, j));

    inakos[i][j].print();
    adabo(i, j).print();

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>""Adabo"" and ""Inakos"" being arbitrarily chosen names. Upon execution, <code>inakos</code> prints its contents but the program crashes before <code>adabo</code> can do anything. Another interesting thing is that, if I give <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> values other than 5 and 0, like 5 and 1, respectively, it works fine.</p>

<p>I don't know what exact numbers work and which make the program go haywire, I only know that there's a irregularity here. What am I possibly doing wrong? I'm an amateur at C++, so I may or not have misused something in any of the structures.</p>

<p>If anyone also has the time, I'd very much like to know if there's any other error of notice in my matrix class. Anything that's not possibly related to the problem, but is a fallacy nevertheless.</p>

<p>I've also tested it with the following main(), but it still crashes after <code>inakos</code> prints its contents in [5][1]. Maybe it has to do not with dyMatrix, but a loosely-implemented Coord?</p>

<pre><code>int main() {
    dyMatrix&lt;Coord&gt; adabo(5, 7);
    Coord inakos[5][7];

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; adabo.getHeight(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; adabo.getWidth(); j++) {
            adabo(i, j) = *(new Coord(i, j));
            inakos[i][j] = *(new Coord(i, j));

            inakos[i][j].print();
            cout &lt;&lt; ""; "";
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; ""\n\n"";
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; ""\n\n\n"";

    Coord temp;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {
            temp = adabo(i, j);

            temp.print();
            cout &lt;&lt; ""; "";
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; ""\n\n"";
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>edit: It hasn't to do with Coord. Just tested with a dyMatrix of ints and static matrix of ints, and it crashes after [5][0] nevertheless.</p>

I've distributed my app to a few testers and there is one tester who is having issue when trying to connect/login to Twitter from within the app.
Whenever he clicks on the Twitter app which will check if he's already logged in and if not, it's meant to show the login dialog window (code below), however it just keeps coming up with a Twitter screen stating that ""The request token for this page is invalid"" (image below). It's strange cause it doesn't even give him the chance to login/create a new account, it just instantly shows this screen, and it's only occurring for him no one else.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting already tried:
- Checked phone time and date settings are correct
- Tried completely closing and re-openning the application and going directly to the Twitter functionality (within a minute or so of running the Twitter initialize function).
- Tried clearing the cache in the Safari browser
- Tried uninstalling the application and re-installing it</p>

<p>NOTE: He is using an Iphone 4 and does not actually have a Twitter account at all, but one would expect it would still show him the login screen to allow him to login/create a new account.</p>

<p>Code to login to Twitter:</p>

<pre><code>if (!TwitterCombo.isLoggedIn())
{
    TwitterCombo.showLoginDialog();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Error message screenshot:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/OgdbG.jpg"" alt=""Login error message""></p>

I need to load an url which has links to other pages .When user clicks these links the rendered page is not aligned properly(i mean it cramps all the stuff within the screen width and height ) as compared to default handling of same web page by android browser .<br/><Br/></p>

<p>The alignment is proper when i comment shouldOverrideUrlLoading ,but i need the redirects within my app so i can't avoid overriding shouldOverrideUrlLoading.Is there any other options left out.  </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JzYZw.jpg"" alt=""android webview""></p>

<p>The first image shows webview rendering page within my app as i override shouldOverrideUrlLoading  and the second image shows the same screen after commenting shouldOverrideUrlLoading.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm calling OleDB library directly from unmanaged code (Delphi);</li>
<li>I'm binding parameters by creating an <code>IAccessor</code> to a <code>ICommandText</code> OleDB instance;</li>
<li>I've no problem with simple types like <code>DBTYPE_I8</code> or <code>DBTYPE_DATE</code>;</li>
<li>I would like to bind textual parameters as <code>DBTYPE_WSTR</code> type, i.e. always as Unicode.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The issue is that for <code>DBTYPE_WSTR</code> type, I get an OLEDB Error 80040E1D (DB_E_UNSUPPORTEDCONVERSION) error, 'Requested conversion is not supported', when <code>Command.Execute</code> is called.</strong></p>

<p>Of course, I've tried with or without <code>DBTYPE_BYREF</code> data layout (i.e. setting <code>FIELDTYPE2OLEDB[ftUTF8]=DBTYPE_WSTR or DBTYPE_BYREF</code> in code below, and changing the layout): same issue... it works with <code>DBTYPE_WSTR</code> but not with <code>DBTYPE_STR</code>.</p>

<p>But if I change the parameter type from <code>DBTYPE_WSTR</code> into <code>DBTYPE_STR</code> (i.e. setting <code>FIELDTYPE2OLEDB[ftUTF8]=DBTYPE_STR or DBTYPE_BYREF</code> in code below), the command executes without any problem. But I would like to use <code>DBTYPE_WSTR</code> wType instead, to ensure that no character is lost because of the current Ansi Charset.</p>

<p>In fact, I can retrieve any <code>IRowSet</code> data without any problem as <code>DBTYPE_WSTR</code>, but I can't bound a parameter value with <code>DBTYPE_WSTR</code>.</p>

<p>I'm connected to a Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. The code works with no parameters in the SQL request, or with int or floating-point parameters, but not with TEXT parameters.</p>

<p>Here is the main sample code:</p>

<pre><code>Query.Execute('select * from Person.Address where AddressLine1 like ?;',true,['% Drive']);
</code></pre>

<p><code>AddressLine1</code> column is defined as <code>nvarchar(60)</code> in the <em>AdventureWorks2008R2</em> reference sample database, so it <em>should</em> map with <code>DBTYPE_WSTR</code>, according to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms130984.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">official MSDN documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The full source code of the corresponding unit is available from <a href=""http://synopse.info/fossil/finfo?name=SynOleDB.pas"" rel=""nofollow"">our source code repository</a>. The code is in the <code>TOleDBStatement.Execute</code> method, as such:</p>

<pre><code>const
  PARAMTYPE2OLEDB: array[TSQLDBParamInOutType] of DBPARAMIO = (
    DBPARAMIO_INPUT, DBPARAMIO_OUTPUT, DBPARAMIO_INPUT or DBPARAMIO_OUTPUT);
  FIELDTYPE2OLEDB: array[TSQLDBFieldType] of DBTYPE = (
    DBTYPE_EMPTY, DBTYPE_NULL, DBTYPE_I8, DBTYPE_R8, DBTYPE_CY, DBTYPE_DATE,
    DBTYPE_WSTR or DBTYPE_BYREF, DBTYPE_BYTES or DBTYPE_BYREF);

  (...)
  OleDBCheck((fSession as IDBCreateCommand).
    CreateCommand(nil,IID_ICommandText,ICommand(fCommand)));
  fCommand.SetCommandText(DBGUID_DEFAULT,pointer(Utf8DecodeToRawUnicodeUI(aSQL)));
  P := pointer(fParams);
  SetLength(fParamBindings,fParamCount);
  B := pointer(fParamBindings);
  for i := 1 to fParamCount do begin
    B^.iOrdinal := i; // parameter index (starting at 1)
    B^.eParamIO := PARAMTYPE2OLEDB[P^.VInOut]; // parameter direction
    B^.wType := FIELDTYPE2OLEDB[P^.VType];     // parameter data type
    // set additional fields
    case P^.VType of
    ftInt64, ftDouble, ftCurrency, ftDate: begin
      // those types match the VInt64 binary representation :)
      B^.cbMaxLen := sizeof(Int64);
      B^.dwPart := DBPART_VALUE;
      B^.obValue := PAnsiChar(@P^.VInt64)-pointer(fParams);
    end;
    ftUTF8, ftBlob: begin

      B^.cbMaxLen := sizeof(Pointer);
      Len := length(P^.VRawByteString);
      if P^.VType=ftUTF8 then
        Len := Len shr 1; // expect length in WideChar count, excluding #0 
      P^.VInt64 := Len; // store length in unused VInt64 property
      B^.obLength := PAnsiChar(@P^.VInt64)-pointer(fParams);
      B^.obStatus := B^.obLength+4;
    end;
    end;
    inc(P);
    inc(B);
  end;

<p>My question is therefore: </p>

<p><strong>How to bind a <code>B^.wType=DBTYPE_WSTR</code> parameter for a  <code>nvarchar()</code> column without having a DB_E_UNSUPPORTEDCONVERSION error in <code>fCommand.Execute</code>.</strong></p>

<p>I suspect there is some property to set to the <code>ISession</code> or <code>ICommand</code> instance, or some flag/option to set, but I was not able to find which one from MSDN documentation. Any help is welcome!</p>

<p>While deploying a beta copy of an ASP.NET application built with Delphi 2007 for .NET to a test server I encountered an odd problem. The application was unable to start because it could not load the correct version of an ADO.NET data provider that I was using. </p>

<p>Only by including a version of the old assembly in the bin directory would the application run. However, I don’t want to be tied to this older .NET data provider, so I am determined to find a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>I originally compiled the project with the .net data provider assembly used as Copy Local, which should have caused Delphi to use a copy of that version of the assembly that I selected when I added it to the References folder in the Project Manager. The actual assembly that I selected was version 9.10.2.0, and that is the version of the assembly that appears in the bin directory, along with the application. However, at runtime the application was trying to bind to an earlier version of the same assembly, 9.0.2.7. </p>

<p>(Actually, this problem occurs whether or not I use the GAC version of Copy Local, so I don’t think this is the issue.)</p>

<p>While investigating this problem I created a new project, and added a reference to the 9.10.2.0 assembly. Still, both the .NET 2.0 Configuration Utility and Reflector showed that the application compiled with a reference to the 9.0.2.7 assembly. </p>

<p>Inspecting the GAC I saw that both 9.0.2.7 and 9.10.2.0 versions were registered. Attempting to remove the 9.0.2.7 version fails, since that version of the provider was still referencing the assembly in the GAC.</p>

<p>I went into the registry and manually removed all references to the 9.0.2.7 provider. I then was able to delete it from the GAC. This didn’t change anything. Removing the assembly from an existing application and then adding the 9.10.2.0 version back, then compiling, still resulted in the wrong assembly information being inserted into the application. As before, creating a new application that referenced the 9.10.2.0 assembly didn’t work, as a reference to 9.0.2.7 was still being inserted into the executable.</p>

<p>I’ve checked the Delphi library search path. I also removed every instance of the old assembly files from the machine altogether (including from the ASP.NET Temporary Files directory). I still got the problem. I tried using Issam Ali’s AppManifest utility to manually adjust the manifest, but apparently it does not support ASP.NET applications in Delphi 2007 for .NET.</p>

<p>So, the GAC no longer contains references to 9.0.2.7, there are no references to it in the registry, there are no paths to the old provider directory in the project or Delphi options dialogs, the old provider assembly is not on the file system, and 9.0.2.7 does not appear in any of the project files. Nor does it appear in web.config, machine.config, or any other file I checked. Nonetheless, Delphi insists on using this version of the assembly anytime I reference the 9.10.2.0 version of the assembly. (Yes, I restarted Delphi, and also restarted the Virtual Machine in which this development was being performed.)</p>

<p>Even after uninstalling the 9.10.2.0 data provider (the older one was already uninstalled), and reinstalling it, adding the data provider reference to an application results in the runtime application attempting to load the old provider (even though no reference to the old provider apparently remains in the system). </p>

<p>I’ve tried other solutions (which are worth mentioning here), but none worked. Anybody seen this? I am going to continue working on this problem, but I’d love to hear suggestions. I just can’t get Delphi to stop inserting the old assembly information into the project.</p>

<p>For grins I’m including the error log from the failure. This log essentially duplicates the information I get from the fusion log. This log is from one of the simple apps I created after removing the 9.0.2.7 assembly from the GAC. Notice that it’s looking for the old version of the provider from the outset.</p>

<p>This has gone on so long that the comments that I added to LanceSC's answer are no longer showing. But I do thing this is an interesting item that I want to address.</p>

<p>Here's my last two comments to LanceSC</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The installation that exhibited this behavior is in a VM that is no longer functioning. Another developer I know experienced this same problem. The solution was to abandon the installation. I feel that something in the installer of the particular version of this .NET data provider left some strange artifact that produced the problem. It does not happen with any other build of this data provider. I am no longer pursuing an answer to this question.</p></li>
<li><p>Spoke too soon. A colleague of mine, today (March 5, 2010), encountered this same error, with a slightly earlier version of this same .NET data provider (9.0.2.1). He is now in the same position I was. He cannot run his application with any version of the data provider, save the old one. That assembly was being used as a local copy, and the old version is not in the gac. Using his machine, we ran the run MSBuild with the verbose option. The build worked fine with no errors. Nonetheless, the compile application failed to run, having failed to find the old version of the provider.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>My colleague resigned himself to reinstalling Delphi 2007 (fortunately, he was working in a VM, and had a second VM with Delphi 2007 in which the offending .NET data provider had never been installed. This was also my tactic.</p>

<p>At this point, I have concluded that this problem is not solvable. Nonetheless, I am leaving this question open for another week or so. If no feasible solution is proposed in the next few weeks, I will close this question.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have asked my colleague to preserve the VM with the misbehaving provider, in order to test any solution or investigation that is proposed. </p>

        fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer($file[0])

            $upload.http(
                url: ""/media.json""
                headers: 'Content-Type': $file[0].type
                data: medium: {text: 'text', image_video: e.target.result}
            ).progress((evt) -&gt;
                console.log ""percent: "" + parseInt(100.0 * evt.loaded / evt.total)

<p>Is the problem in the fact that I format it as json? But shouldnt atleast the text params be passed to the controller?</p>

<p>I cannot use the html Post too because the nature of my application is so that it will intercept all HTML requests when you log in.</p>

<p>Also maybe worth nothing that I use <code>paperclip</code> to manage my uploads for me. So I probably have to get the file sent into a proper format too for it?</p>

<p>jQuery Transform plugin can be found from <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Transform</a></p>

<p>Now my problem is:<br>
I use a default include in some xsl templates, and this include uses a parameter that is passed to the top level one.</p>

<p>So its like i have the <strong>top.xsl</strong> template that declares a [xsl:param name=""param"" /], and i use this param with the <strong>included.xsl</strong>, that is called by the 1st one with [xsl:include href=""included.xsl""] . This works both on Firefox and Internet Explorer, but not on Chrome. I saw a question here on stackoverflow where some guy re-write the webkit fix function from the plugin, but it doesn't work with xsl:param this way.</p>

<p>Does anyone know some way to use [xsl:param] like this in Google Chrome?</p>

This basically gives them a thin blue border rather than the grey bevelled one in windows classic. I have made no attept to change the style on the little down arrow button next to the selects. The CSS looks liek this:</p>

<pre><code>border: 1px solid #7F9DB9;

<p>The final effect that I am after is a blue border on all selects and text inputs, and selects should have the system default for the little dropdown arrow button.</p>

<p>This works fine in all non-IE browsers. And it works fine in IE 7. It even works fine in IE8 RC1 provided that the windows classic theme is being used. However in IE8 RC1 if you use the windows XP theme (blue curvy window headers) then IE8 RC1 continues to use the grey windows classic button.</p>

<p>This is how it renders in IE7: <img src=""http://img128.imageshack.us/img128/1993/goodboxlr2.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

Linked lists are the major data structure of Lisp languages, and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure (this is known as homoiconicity).</p>

<p>However, a list is by definition a sequential construct. This encourages us to solve problems using sequential language idioms (algorithms that process one thing at a time and accumulate the results). For example, in a Lisp where <em>cons</em> cells are used to implement singly-linked lists, the <em>car</em> operation returns the first element of the list, while <em>cdr</em> returns the rest of the list. My vision is of a functional language for parallel execution, that splits problems into roughly equal sub-problems, recursively solves them, and combines the sub-solutions.</p>

<p>Pretty much every programming language's code is already parsed into trees; is there a homoiconic language like Lisp, but with trees as the major data structure? btw, I'd call it Treep, for <b>TREE</b> <b>P</b>rocessing.</p>

<p>Background info:
Site is located at <a href=""http://www.mobiuspc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobiuspc.com</a> and the section in question is the ""configurator"" button on my top row navigation. <br>
Everything is written in the latest flavor of VB.NET and ASP 3.5, and I have a SQL2005 server available with my host. </p>

<p>Here is the down 'n dirty of my dilemma:<br>
During pageload, I get a list of all the parts in my parts table. Then I create an image object and 2 label objects per entry and place them in my fancy accordion pane control. Works great so far, I can get a giant list of pictures and text that's aligned how I like it (for now). Now - I really need a way to be able to have a visitor drag an image/label/label combo from the accordion over to a panel (or anything really) on the right side that is currently invisible. Once the dragged thing is dropped into the drop target, I would like it to fire a function or sub that I write in VB.</p>

<p>From what I've seen about jquery, apparently there is a way to make an element on my webpage draggable, droppable, or what have you. The example code for it - I'm not entirely understanding so a quickie sample would be great. I'm a fast learner and can apply it from there to my project. More importantly, how do I get objects that are created during runtime to be draggable, and fire my event that I wrote in the only language that I know?</p>

<p>Then the page loads with all my image/label/label object trio's. Lots of them. Performance is not an issue at this point, I just want my idea to work. The idea again, is once I somehow magically ""drag"" one of my created objects into a dropzone, then let go of the mouse to make it actually drop, something like this will get executed (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>Public Function fire_the_great_event()
  x = the id of the element that just got dropped
  'do work here
  'take that element id, figure out what it is, and ask the database for more help
  'depending on what the database says, start deleting un-needed image/label/label's
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Help of any kind would be greatly appreciated! If at all possible, I want to keep my interaction with non-VB/ASP to a minimum. If I can somehow just slap a magical property on an object from my vb coding window, that would be best.</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p>For this purpose,I added three variables <code>icnt</code>,<code>jcnt</code> and <code>kcnt</code>.</p>

        int[] a =  new int[N];

}
</code></pre>

<p>I got the following output</p>

<pre><code>i loop=100 times
j loop=4950 times
k loop=161700 times
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to analyze this as follows</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The outer for loop (i=0 to &lt; N)</strong> </p>

<p>This executes <code>N</code> times ,so for <code>N=100</code> ,the count will be <code>100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inner for loop(j=i+1 to &lt; N)</strong></p>

<p>This is equivalent to finding combinations of N elements ,taken 2 at a time</p>

<p>which means <code>C(N,2) = N! /((N-2)! * 2!) = (N *(N-1))/2  = ((N^2)/2)-(N/2)</code></p>

<p>For  <code>N=100</code> , this will be <code>(100*100/2)-50 = 4950</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Innermost loop (k=j+1 to &lt; N)</strong></p>

<p>Equivalent to finding combinations of N elements ,taken 3 at a time</p>

<p>ie, <code>C(N,3) = N!/((N-3)! * 3!) = N*(N-1)*(N-2)/3! = (N^3/6)-(N^2/2)+N/3</code></p>

<p>For <code>N=100</code>, this will be <code>100^3/6 - 100^2/2 + 100/3 = 161700</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am getting the correct values,but wanted to know if the analysis(combinations stuff) is proper.(I have only recently learned the permutation/combinations lessons).If someone can add more to this analysis, it would be helpful.</p>

"15751414","1","15770054","","2013-04-01 20:36:44","","0","179","<p>I'm basically building a quick and dirty course catalog that has multiple hierarchical categories and courses that belong to these categories at different levels.</p>

<p>In the old implementation, each major category is its own HTML page and all the courses related to that category are just written into that page in html. The catalog used to be mainly static so this worked fine but courses and categories might be added a little more frequently now and some of the user view options might change/expand in the future.</p>

<p>I thought I would separate all the raw data (courses and catalog structure) into JSON, then generate the views based on this data. I think this would make it easier to maintain the content without having to deal with a proper CMS or database. Any time I need to add a course I'd just throw it into the json file.</p>

<p>First question: Would you recommend this?</p>

<p>Second question: If you think using JSON for this is a good idea, would you separate the categorical structure from the courses as two JSON files and then manipulate them with JS? Or would you have one JSON with the course data embedded inside the catalog category structure?</p>

<p>Here is a sample of what I was thinking about. Maybe I would use Underscore to properly merge these two data (course pushed into a ""courses"" array in the appropriate category) before outputting them into an HTML list view.</p>

<p>The top row in my table <code>layout</code> stays even after I change <code>layouts</code>. </p>

<p>If I change the <code>layout weight</code> for first table row (dayRow) to 1 it disappears like I want it to,</p>

<p>but I want the <code>layout</code> <code>height</code> to still <code>wrap content</code>.</p>

<p>so any help and Suggestion  is appreciated.</p>

<p>In a project, i've got some huge enumerations with unsorted labels inside, and it will be helpful for readability to sort them.</p>

<p>edit : just to point that since many people mentioned that, i'm perfectly aware of ""automatic values"" assigned to enum items at compile time if there is no explicit values on them. </p>

<p>Just to get a bit clearer, two examples : </p>

<pre><code>public enum Colors
{
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Yellow color
///&lt;/summary&gt;
Yellow, 
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Green color
///&lt;/summary&gt;
Green, 
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Blue color
///&lt;/summary&gt;
Blue,
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Red color
///&lt;/summary&gt;
Red
}
</code></pre>

<p>-> we may want to reorder it alphabetically. Admitting integer values are not used since there are not explicitly defined.</p>

<p>Another example : </p>

<pre><code>  public enum Colors
    {
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Yellow color
    ///&lt;/summary&gt;
    Yellow = 3, 
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Green color
    ///&lt;/summary&gt;
    Green = 1, 
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Blue color
    ///&lt;/summary&gt;
    Blue = 2,
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Red color
    ///&lt;/summary&gt;
    Red = 4
    }
</code></pre>

<p>-> we may like to reorder it by numeric value, or, why not, alphabetically. 
And so on.</p>

<p>And I also want to keep the comments preceding every entry, which means I can't simply use Excel or a text editor to perform alphabetic sort.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

The site will read/serve files, but will not write to any file location under any circumstances.  Ideally, I'd be writing to a non-local share, but I'm currently just trying to get the application to write to a local share/drive.  I've tried setting the identity to a domain service account set up specifically for this application, the built in Network Service account, and the ApplicationPoolIdentity with no luck.  It may be worth mentioning that this server is a virtualized instance running on shared hardware with other servers.</p>

<p>In order to try and grasp the issue, I have granted full control to:</p>

<pre><code>(MACHINE NAME)
(MACHINE NAME)\Users
(MACHINE NAME)\IUSR
(MACHINE NAME)\IIS_IUSRS
(DOMAIN NAME)\(MACHINE NAME)
NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
(APPLICATION POOL IDENTITY)
(DOMAIN NAME)\(SERVICE ACCOUNT NAME)

<p>I have manually verified that all these accounts/groups have full control on the security tab of the file/folder.</p>

<p>The app pool is running under the .NET Framework v4.0 on the Integrated Managed Pipeline.  I've tried it with Load User Profile set to both true and false with no luck.  The site itself is set to application pass-through authentication.</p>

When the inbound request comes in, <code>TIdIOHandler.InitComponent</code> is called in a thread before execution is handed to the method called in <code>TServerMethods</code>.  I do not have any Indy components in the server, so DataSnap is using Indy 10 under-the-hood.</p>

<p><em><code>.InitComponent()</code></em> sets the IO handler's <em>max line length</em> to a hard-coded value (<code>FMaxLineLength := IdMaxLineLengthDefault;</code>), which is <em>16384</em>.  I can't find a way to increase the value.  I even tried copying the <em>IdIOHandler Unit</em> to the project folder and changing the constant value.  But it still picks up the <em>IdIOHandler.dcu</em> from the Indy 10 build, and ignores the copied file in my project folder.  I also tried adding a <code>TIdIOHandlerStream</code> component to the server project and setting its <code>MaxLineLength</code> to no avail.</p>

<pre><code>#define WW 64

<p>I want to declare a new type, <code>foo_t</code>, as an alias for one of the <code>uintX_t</code> in <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>. I can hard code the word width and use</p>

<pre><code>#define uint(x) typedef uint ## x ## _t foo_t
uint(64);

<p>However, <code>uint(WW)</code> is obviously an error. I have played around for a while using a macro like <code>#define expand(x) x</code> and use it in various ways, to no avail. My last resort is an <code>#if</code> cascade such as</p>

<pre><code>#if WW == 64
typedef uint64_t foo_t;
#elif WW == 32
typedef uint32_t foo_t;
#elif WW == 16
typedef uint16_t foo_t;
#elif WW == 8
typedef uint8_t foo_t;
#else
#error ""unsupported word width""

<p>which I'd rather avoid. Is there a way to typedef a type based on my <code>WW</code> macro so that <code>uint(WW)</code> would expand eventually to <code>uint64_t</code>? I <em>believe</em> the answer is ""no"", but some language-lawyer please prove me wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>

<p>I have very little hands-on experience with EF, and I've just inherited a codebase that uses it extensively.  This extension method is in that codebase, with usage to follow:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public static void SafeAttachTo&lt;T&gt;(this ObjectContext context, string entitySetName, ref T entity) where T : IEntityWithKey {
            ObjectStateEntry entry; 
            bool attach;

            if (context.ObjectStateManager.TryGetObjectStateEntry(context.CreateEntityKey(entitySetName, entity), out entry)) {
                attach = entry.State == EntityState.Detached;
                entity = (T) entry.Entity;
            }
            else
                attach = true;

            if (attach) 
                context.AttachTo(entitySetName, entity);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>    public int UpdateOrInsertWidget(Widget widget) {
        if (widget.Id == 0) {
            _context.Widgets.AddObject(widget);
        } else {
            _context.SafeAttachTo(""Widgets"", ref widget);
            _context.ObjectStateManager.ChangeObjectState(widget, EntityState.Modified);
        }

        return _context.SaveChanges();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>At some point, the user changes the Summary on a <code>Widget</code> (let's say the type has <code>Id</code> and <code>Summary</code> properties... we'll call this instance <code>changedWidget</code>), from ""Old Summary"" to ""New Summary"".</p>

<p>And so <code>UpdateOrInsertWidget</code> gets called like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>UpdateOrInsertWidget(changedWidget);
</code></pre>

<p>After the call to <code>_context.SaveChanges();</code>, the database (SQL Server 2008) shows ""Old Summary"" in the Summary column.</p>

<p>The <code>entity = (T) entry.Entity;</code> line seems to be overwriting <code>changedWidget</code> when it's passed in, which seems bad.</p>

<p>But, w/o more EF experience, I'm struggling to figure out what about this code needs to change.</p>

<p>However, I have been reading about how people could simply spoof their IP, then just send data as a specific IP. So this seems to be the wrong way to do it (insecure). So how else am I suppose to identify what data belongs to what users? For instance you have 10 users connected, all have specific data. The server would need to match the user data to this data we received.</p>

<p>The only way I can see to do this is to use some sort of client/server key system and encrypt the data. I am curious as to how other applications (or games, since that's what this application is) make sure their data is genuine. Also there is the fact that encryption takes much longer to process than unencrypted. Although I am not sure by how much it will affect performance.</p>
