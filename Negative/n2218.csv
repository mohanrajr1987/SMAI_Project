<p>I've just inherited some code based on JSF, Seam &amp; Hibernate. The existing DAO code makes use of Seam's <code>HibernateEntityQuery</code>, in particular its support for restriction expression strings. </p>

<p>This has worked fine so far, but now I'm tasked with adding a restriction to an existing query that takes into account a <strong>bit field</strong>. </p>

<p>The Java entity code is using an integer field to represent a set of ""days"", via this enum:</p>

<pre><code>public enum WEEKDAY {

    MONDAY(1), TUESDAY(2), WEDNESDAY(4), THURSDAY(8), FRIDAY(16), SATURDAY(32), SUNDAY(64) ;

    private int value;

    private WEEKDAY(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The integer value from this enum is stored into the entity in an <code>int days</code> field.</p>

<p>For example, if the entity contains MONDAY, WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY, <code>days</code> would be set to <code>1 | 8 | 16</code>, which <code>== 25</code>. </p>

<p>Now I'd like to add a new restriction to the query so that (for example) I can ask for entities where days includes MONDAY OR SATURDAY: <code>1 | 32 == 33</code>, so in SQL, I would do:</p>

<pre><code>select id from entity where (select days &amp; 33) &gt; 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there such a syntax for <code>HibernateEntityQuery</code>? I tried adding the following restriction:</p>

<pre><code>entity.days &amp; #{myQuery.bitwiseMeetingDays} &gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>which results in the following error:</p>

<pre><code>org.hibernate.QueryException: unexpected char: '&amp;'

<p>Well, I have developed a application in Visual Studio C++ 2010,  in which 3D objects can be processed, so there is a function called Import Model which helps to import model.</p>

<p>What I want is, the user just right click on the object and press Open with [application name] or double click on it, and application should the get the path of that file and call the Import function. Same like we do with any MS word *.doc files, we double click on it and it gets open. </p>

<p>I want the same thing to make my software as a default program to open some specific files extension. When user double click on the model, it should open in my application.</p>

<p>Actually, I read something about argument parser, I don't know much about it. Is it what I need to look for ?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I then changed it to a custom resource provider to get better control on the resource labels. </p>

<p>However, it has been observed that in an older version which uses the resx implementation the menu items when on navigate to another page flickers only the first time i navigate and the second time on wards if i visit the page again no flickering happens.</p>

<p>Where as in the database implementation of custom resource provider there is a flicker on the screen every time i re visit the page. </p>

<p>I have checked whether it does a database call to my custom sql which gets the data but the custom sql is executed only once which is correct (<em>that is the once each resource is requested</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It will add to run-time memory usage, not to mention the increased number of assemblies loaded into the application domain</em></p>

<p>Does the loading of these assemblies actually get data faster then the custom resource provider implementation ?</p>

<p>What exactly is the difference in getting resources from the <strong>custom resource provider</strong> implementation and the <strong>Default resx</strong> implementation ?

<p>For example a common practice is if you know that a function will have arguments that are not to be changed, to simply mark these constant. e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>bool My_Class::do_stuff(const int not_to_be_changed_1,
                        std::vector&lt;int&gt; const * const not_to_be_changed_2)
{
  //I can't change my int var, my vector pointer, or the ints inside it.
}
</code></pre>

<p>So is it valid to use static member functions to limit access.  For example, lets say you have a function</p>

<pre><code>void My_Class::print_error(const unsigned int error_no) {
  switch (error_no) {
    case 1:
      std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Bad read on..."" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      break;
    //...
    default:
      break;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well here we're not going to be accessing any member variables of the class.  So if I changed the function to:</p>

<pre><code>static void My_Class::print_error(const unsigned int error_no) {
  switch (error_no) {
    case 1:
      std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Bad read on..."" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      break;
    //...
    default:
      break;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'd now get an error, if I inadvertently tried to access one of my private var, etc. (unless I pass myself an instance of my class, which would be purposeful ^_^  !)</p>

<p>Is this a valid technique, similar to proactively making args that should not be changed constants?</p>

<p>What downsides might it have in terms of efficiency or use?</p>

<p>My chief reason for asking is that most of the ""static"" tutorials I read made no mention of using it in this way, so I was wondering if there was a good reason why not to, considering it seems like a useful tool.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>: A further logical justification of this use:</p>

<p>I have a function print_error,as outlined above.  I could use a namespace:</p>

<pre><code>namespace MY_SPACE {
   static void print_error(...) {
      ...
   } 

   class My_Class {
      ....
      void a(void)
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this is a pain, because I now have to lengthen ALL of my var declarations, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>MY_SPACE::My_Class class_1;
</code></pre>

<p>all to remove a function from my class, that essentially <em>is</em> a member of my class.</p>

<p>Of course there's multiple levels of access control for functions:</p>

<pre><code>//can't change pointer to list directly
void My_Class::print_error(std::vector&lt;int&gt; const * error_code_list) {...}

//can't change pointer to list or list members directly
void My_Class::print_error(std::vector&lt;int&gt; const * const error_code_list) {...}

//can't change pointer to list or list members directly, access
//non-const member vars/functions
void My_Class::print_error(std::vector&lt;int&gt; const * const error_code_list) const {...}

//can't change pointer to list or list members directly, access
//non-static member vars/functions
static void My_Class::print_error(std::vector&lt;int&gt; const * const error_code_list) {...}

//can't change pointer to list or list members directly, access
//member vars/functions that are not BOTH static and const
static void My_Class::print_error(std::vector&lt;int&gt; const * const error_code_list) const {...}
</code></pre>

<p>Sure this is a bit atypical, but to lessening degrees so are using const functions and const variables.  I've seen lots of examples where people could have used a const function, but didn't.  Yet some people think its a good idea.  I know a lot of beginning c++ programmers who wouldn't understand the implications of a const function or a static one.  Likewise a lot would understand both.</p>

<p>So why are some people so adamantly against using this as an access control mechanism if the language/spec provides for it to be used as such, just as it does with const functions, etc.?</p>

<p>There is also the approach described in this <a href=""http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1820-0214/2010/1820-02141001063S.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a> on 3D Mesh Skeleton Extraction using prominent Segmentation based on ""connecting rings"".</p>

<p>So far the closest i got to making it work is the <a href=""http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin%3amorphology%3askeletonize3d%3astart"" rel=""nofollow"">Skeletonize3D</a> plugin for ImageJ but I could not make it works for an .obj mesh yet.</p>

<p>The fun starts when I actually try to edit the constraints.. viewWithBackground is just an empty NSView that sets it's background. When the constraint is |[viewWithBackground]| for both horizontal and vertical, I get the expected result -- green rows. When I change it to the most basic |-[viewWithBackground]-|, I get a decidedly unexpected result -- red rows, and no sign of my green view!</p>

<p>Is there some additional step I'm supposed to take here? My goal is to have my viewWithBackground actually be a slightly smaller view, to fake the 'gaps' between rows and the spacing from the edges of the table view..</p>

<p>On OS X 10.11 El Capitan, the default header hight of NSTableView has grown.</p>

<h3>Problem:</h3>

<p>When I build my NSTableView on OS X El Capitan 10.11 (GM) and Xcode 7.0 (the stable one), the table header hight will be fixed with El Capitan's header hight even on the previous OS versions and so there is a strange unwanted space above the table header (see the screenshots below.)</p>

Im using square tiles for the platforms but when they are drawn some of them have gaps between them. When I zoom in/out or move the camera around the gaps move position. Has anyone had the same problem or know how it fix it?</p>

<p>A little more detail. tiles are size 32 and have tried textures of both 32 and 64. tiles are lined up 32 apart eg. first tile would be x =0 y=0 second x=32 y=0 and so on in both x and y directions. The gaps are not texture artefacts as I have checked this many a time. Using the texturepacker with padding. My best guess is that it is a problem when converting the textures to screen coords but really have no idea how to fix this. I would of thought this problem to have come up before but couldn't find any fixes anywhere. I have checked and double checked my precision with tile sizes and lining them up.</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.

<p>Essentially, I store the logged in userId in HttpContext.User.Identity and have written an <code>EnhancedAuthorizeAttribute</code> to perform some custom authorization.</p>

<p>In the overriden <code>OnAuthorization</code> method, my domain model hits the database to ensure the current user id can access the passed in routeValue ""BatchCode"".  The prototype is:</p>

<pre><code>ReviewGroup GetReviewGroupFromBatchCode(string batchCode);
</code></pre>

<p>It will return null if the user can't access the ReviewGroup and the OnAuthorization then denies access.</p>

<p>Now, I know the decorated action method will only get executed if OnAuthorization passes, but I don't want to hit the database a second time to get the ReviewGroup again.</p>

<p>I am thinking of storing the ReviewGroup in <code>HttpContext.Items[""reviewGroup""]</code> and accessing this from the controller at the moment.</p>

<p>Is this a feasible solution, or am I on the wrong path?</p>

<p>this just shows ""session of product check"" with nothing after each one, I set the session variable as such:</p>

<p>$_SESSION['productcheck'] = $productBox;</p>

<p>the $productBox is a GET from the URL:</p>

<pre>
echo "" &lt;iframe src=\""homeview.php?productBox=$product1\"" name=\""FRAMENAME\"" width=\""594\"" height=\""450\"" scrolling=\""No\"" id=\""FRAMENAME\"" allowautotransparency=\""true\"" &gt; &lt;/iframe &gt;""; </pre>

I want to retrieve a second $productBox and assign it to session var productcheck1 and so forth down the line. Unfortunately, i have to take one var in at a time, otherwise i could just pass all 4 products and not worry about the sessions.</p>

  <p>can't deduce a template for 'TReceiver' from non-template type 'DamageAnimationSystem'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is my situation: I've got a program where classes can subscribe to the event manager for  some type of events but not all.</p>

<p>To do that, I inherit from a class with a specific type:</p>

<pre><code> class DamageAnimationSystem : public Receiver&lt;DamageEvent&gt;, 
                               public Receiver&lt;HealthEvent&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, my class will listen ""DamageEvent"" and ""HealthEvent"" so I need to declare virtual methods for this type of events:</p>

<pre><code>DamageAnimationSystem::onEvent( const DamageEvent&amp; event ) {}
DamageAnimationSystem::onEvent( const HealthEvent&amp; event ) {}
</code></pre>

<p>And I need to subscribe to this event:</p>

<pre><code>DamageAnimationSystem::DamageAnimationSystem()
{
    eventManager-&gt;subscribe&lt;DamageEvent&gt;(this);
    eventManager-&gt;subscribe&lt;HealthEvent&gt;(this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I said before, everything is ok when I use Clang but when I use GCC I've got the error given above.</p>

<p>Here is what I've done:</p>

<p><strong>Receiver:</strong></p>

<pre><code>class EBaseReceiver
{
protected:
    static std::size_t nextId;
};

template &lt;typename TEventData&gt;
class Receiver : public EBaseReceiver
{
friend class EventManager;

     virtual void onEventReceive( const TEventData&amp; event ) = 0;
     static std::size_t getId() { return ID; }
private:
     static std::size_t ID;
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Event:</strong></p>

<pre><code>struct BaseEvent

};

template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct Event : public BaseEvent
{
     static std::size_t getId() { return ID; }
     static std::size_t ID;
};

**And finally the event manager:**
template&lt; class TEvent, template&lt;class&gt; class TReceiver&gt;
void EventManager::subscribe( TReceiver&lt;TEvent&gt;* receiver );
{
    const std::size_t eventId = TEvent::getId();
    this-&gt;subscribers[eventId].push_back(receiver);
}

<p>Switching the order of the <code>entries</code> and <code>cvr_entries</code> <code>for</code> loops changes nothing. I've also tried adding <code>first()</code> instead of <code>all()</code>, but that leads to an error where it says </p>

<p>For Example : the Value 12.34 splitted into the Integers 12 and 34.</p>

<p>According to my basic knowledge of math this could easily be done via this expression that I'm using right now:</p>

<pre><code>double aValue = 2.4f;
int aInt = (int)aValue;    
int aFract = (int)((aValue - aInt) * 100.0f ); 
</code></pre>

<p>It works so far but it has weird output behaviors.</p>

<p>For example passing 2.30000 results in '2' and '29' instead of '2' and '30'.</p>

<p>If I declare aInt and aFract as Double, the processing results correctly in '2.0000' and '30.0000' but converting '30.0000' into a integer results ""interestingly"" in '29' again.</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong>: Our company had been using prototype for some time, and just recently switched to dojo.  I have been converting lots and lots of JS and setting everything back up to normal and then I encountered this issue...</p>

<p><strong>The issue</strong>: I have a typical form set up with a upload file field.  (I'm not using a dijit, and have tried multiple variations of them - not working for me perhaps in 1.4 I will try again.)  Upon pressing the submit button my intentions were to watch the upload progress of the files, in prototype this was a simple ajax.PeriodicalUpdater call (wich is basicly xhrGet/Post that runs over and over and over).  Coupled with apc.rfc1867 (example: <a href=""http://www.phpriot.com/articles/php-ajax-file-uploads/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phpriot.com/articles/php-ajax-file-uploads/3</a>) this becomes very easy, basicly you post, and use ajax to fetch the current progress of the file.  </p>

<p><strong>Here is where I encounter the actual issue</strong>... xhrPost() doesn't seem to want to run after the form goes into what I call 'submit mode' (where the page is spooling and uploading). APC actually needs the files to be in the 'submit mode' to poll the current progress and return the % via ajax.</p>

<p><strong>What I have tried</strong>:
Only one thing has partially worked.  Using the onclick="""" calling the xhrPost() imediately followed by return false;  The problem with this is that the only way I got it to actually work was to click the submit button, and then click a seperate submit button with return false...  I think why this worked is that it started a normal submit, then during the upload process it sent the xhrPost() along with return false;.  It's probably the uploads re-started, but what is sure is that the APC data was being fed into the progress bar, unfortunately this shouldn't require 2 clicks.  Also, it didn't finish submitting the page either.</p>

<p>I've had little success using dojo.connect() to the button or the form.</p>

<p>I've had little success using onclick="""" unless return false; is present.</p>

<p>I've had little success using dojo.io.iframe to send a seperate request.</p>

<p>I've had little success using dojox.file.FileUpload, and presents a large sum of it's own issues as well.</p>

<p><strong>Code Snippets</strong>:</p>

<p>Old Code:</p>

<pre><code>new PeriodicalExecuter(function(pe) {
	if( dojo.byId('progressbar').innerHTML == 'Processing...' ) {
		pe.stop();
	} else if( dojo.byId('progressbar').innerHTML != '' ) {
		dojo.byId('progressbar1').setStyle({
			width: dojo.byId('progressbar').innerHTML + '%'
		});
	}
}, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>New Code: </p>

<pre><code>	dojo.xhrPost({
		url: 'ajax/apcProgressBar.php',
		content: { progress_key: dojo.byId( 'progress_key' ).value },
		load: function( data ) {
			dojo.byId( 'progressbar' ).innerHTML = data;
			if( dojo.byId( 'progressbar' ).innerHTML != '' ) {
				dojo.style( 'progressbar1', 'width', dojo.byId( 'progressbar' ).innerHTML + '%' );
        	  window.setTimeout(this, 2000);
			}
		}
	});
}
</code></pre>

<p>APC Handling:</p>

<pre><code>if( isset( $_POST[ 'progress_key' ] ) ) {
if( $status = apc_fetch( 'upload_' . $_POST[ 'progress_key' ] ) ) {
	$progress = ceil( $status[ 'current' ] / $status[ 'total' ] * 100 );
	if ( $progress &gt;= 100 ) {
		echo 'Processing...';
	} else {
		echo $progress;
	}
}
echo '...';
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p><strong>TLDR Version</strong>: I need a way to submit a form with files to upload, and send xhrPost() at the same time, and nothing I try works.  The only other variable is that APC must know about the file trying to be uploaded, and stopping the event seems to hinder this completely.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>So my issue is this <code>Permission denied (publickey).</code> problem.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Here is what I have done to debug it.</p>

<p>1) I have verified that I am using the correct <code>elastic ip address</code>.  I have also tried using the longer <code>Public DNS</code> address, with the exact same results.  So I am sure that <strong>I have the correct HOST</strong>.</p>

<p>2) I have made sure the <strong>security group rules allow SSH</strong>.  First of all, it was already set to allow TCP incoming traffic on port 22.  Just to be safe, I added a rule to allow all TCP incoming traffic for all ports, for all ip addresses.  Outgoing traffic has a rule to allow everything to everywhere.</p>

<p>3) I have verified that I am using the <strong>correct Key pair name</strong>.  It is located under the ""EC2"" > ""instance"" > ""Key pair name"".  It says ""cgwebsites-wp"", and I have the correct key pair name located locally at <code>/development/aws/cgwebsites-wp.pem</code>, as shown above in my verbose output.  I've also verified that my path to that file is correct, because when I put something bogus like <code>/development/aws/cgwebsites-wp222.pem</code>, the errors tell me specifically that they could not find the file.</p>

<p>4) I have tried several <strong>different usernames</strong>, as suggested by every and all posts to this question on other links.  To be more specific, I have tried <code>admin</code>, <code>ubuntu</code>, <code>root</code>, <code>ec2-user</code>, <code>fedora</code>.  I even tried the ID found at ""EC2"" > ""instance"" > ""AMI ID"".  None work, all produce similar messages.</p>

<p>5) I have tried this on a windows computer (had to create private key packet using puttyGen), as well as a mac computer.  Same error on both.</p>

<p>6) I have tried this on another AWS instance of mine, and everything works fine there.  So my Amazon account is fine.</p>

<p>7) I have tried <strong>deleting all SSH cache files</strong> (in Windows cleared some registry sections, and on mac I've ran <code>ssh-keygen -R 52.24.142.84</code>.</p>

<p>8) I've checked to make sure the <strong>instance is up and running</strong>, and it has a green light, plus I can access the site via the elasticbeanstalk url.  </p>

<p>9) I have tried changing the <strong>permissions</strong> of the <code>.pem</code> file by both of the commands <code>chmod 600 /development/aws/cgwebsites-wp.pem</code> and <code>chmod 400 /development/aws/cgwebsites-wp.pem</code>.</p>

<p>10) This isn't a firewall issue or something like that, because I can SSH into my other AWS instance.  </p>

<p>11) Naturally I have terminated and re-instated several linux instances, all with this same error.</p>

<p>12) I know this is not an issue with a corrupt <code>.pem</code> file, because I am using that exact same file to SSH into my other AWS instance.</p>

<p>This has been a very frustrating issue.  It seems like many people have had similar problems to mine, but almost everybody solved it by changing the username.  I've tried that, including the suggestions and script at <a href=""https://alestic.com/2014/01/ec2-ssh-username/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://alestic.com/2014/01/ec2-ssh-username/</a>.  But nothing.  </p>

<p>Any help would be so appreciated!</p>

<p>The file to be parsed is composed by a string and than a filename.json that is made of the 2 value tag you want to parse.</p>

<p>Ex. www.........../idr-gold.json (where idr stands for Indonesia currency).</p>

<p>The countries are 155 so I have ID from 1 to 155 that stands for 155 differ tags.</p>

<p>So what I did is a loop that every time is run add +1 to $x, so $x is inserted into a script that find the correspondence between ID and countryName and countryCurrency so that every loop run I compose the url with the missing tag for 155 times.
Than the script continues parsing Json and than returns a table.</p>

<p>The problem are 2:
1) I would like that every line of the table is shown after file .json is parsed (so loop $x = 1, parse www.....idr-gold.json ---> returns a table line with data; than $x = 2, www......usd-gold.json and so on...).
I've tried moving script parts but nothing worked.</p>

<p>2) The time I need to parse is really high... is a metter of my script or is cross-domain parse that is slow? it seems like I don't ""close"" or ""empty"" the script every run so that the data keep on adding making the load heavier. (About this, I've read that it might be a cross-server data transfert problem, so my solution would be the 1st problem. If I show line by line composing table and not all the table at the end of page run, I'll have a php file that will show data avery 1sec x 155 times, in spite of having a page that takes 2 mins (1sec x 155 times) before showing you anything.</p>

<p>I'm trying to determine what the best practice is regarding the storage and access to class data so that it can be inherited and potentially extended by a subclass. Reading the Python 2.7 docs (I'm stuck using 2.6 really), Dive In to Python and past questions here, the answer to this is not clear. </p>

<p>In python pseudo code something like...</p>

<pre><code>class baseClass:
    'DataMap' = {
        'key1': 'val1',
        'key2': 'val2',
        'key3': 'val2',
    }

class subClass1(baseClass): # has access to DataMap
    def myfunc:
        ...
        if DataMap[x] == 'val2':
            print 'foo' # if x equals 'key2' according to the data map
        y = DataMap['key4'] # error!
        ...

class subClass2(baseClass): # appends values to base DataMap
    DataMap['key4'] = 'val4'
    def myfunc:
        ...
        if DataMap[x] == 'val4':
            print 'foo' # if x equals 'key4' according to the data map
        elif DataMap[x] == 'val2':
            print 'bar' # if x equals 'key2' according to the data map
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>What I wrote above is somewhat Perl minded in that direct class data access is common and mostly encouraged because of the overhead to calling a method. I'm getting the feeling that approach isn't very pythonic though, but I wanted a sanity check to be sure.</p>

<p>Should DataMap, though immutable once compiled, reside in a class function where subClass1 would get that data via a class method when inheriting baseClass and subClass2 could override that same method to append/merge its datamap with the base? </p>

<p>Your insights and wisdom is appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm using ClickOnce to deploy a .NET Winforms app, mainly for the ease of getting software updates automatically detected.</p>

<p>Currently when a new version is published, the user is notified there is an update available, BUT there is no mechanism to show them what's actually included in this new update. Ideally I would like an easy way to hook this into my bug tracking system (we're using Redmine).</p>

<p>Now I'm not committed to ClickOnce, so open to other alternatives that allow easy auto updates, but I would really like to let user's know what sort of changes are included in new software updates, and possibly allow them to revisit this information in a Help \ What's New menu.</p>

<p>Not related to .NET, but I've seen AdobeAir seems to do this well, and iTunes Apps also have a  way of showing what's changed before you upgrade, can ClickOnce or other .NET alternatives do this?</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
num1=int(input('Enter your number range: '))
for x in range(1,num1+1):
   if x % 3 == 0:

I have read a number of articles relating to pepople with the same issue and have tried all possible fixes but still no joy.
SSRS runs under a svc_sqlserver acccount and this account has permissions in the DB
the datasources have all been created successfully and the custom reports are using the MSCRM_FetchDataSource which is configured with type Dynamics CRM Fetch and credentials supplied by the user running the report. The connection string says CustomerServicesCE which is the correct OrgsanisationID (as found within developer resources) - i have tried clearing this connection string, adding the server url, all possible combinations with no joy.</p>

<p>Within SSRS i cannot view the report, it says ""cannot access the CRM datasource"" - i read somewhere you need to enter the GUIDs systemuserid and organisationid as username and pwd but still no joy.</p>

<p>I tried amending one report to use the samedatasource as the out the box reports that work but still no joy which is the MSCRM_DataSource...................am i missing something? </p>

<p>These reports have come from another supplier - i don't mind how they are displayed (Fetch or otherwise) i just need them working!
interestingly i do get them working on my Development environment (after getting the same error) and to my eyes the setup looks identical!</p>

<p>When a user on an android phone visits the URL <code>http://www.example.com?key=asdf</code> I would like the value <code>asdf</code> to be saved in a way that any app on the phone can access it at a later point.</p>

<p><strong>The End Goal</strong></p>

<p>The goal is a simple way to invite your friends into the app by directing them to a URL. The URL has a link to download my app from the market, so the only thing required to accept the invite is visiting that URL and clicking on a single link. Once you've installed the app, it can then grab the value <code>asdf</code> and connect you with whoever invited you.</p>

<p><strong>Things I've Tried</strong></p>

<p>My original thought was using something like <code>localStorage</code> or cookies, but it seems unlikely a solution involving either of those exists due to security concerns.</p>

<p>The best solution I've come up with so far is using the <code>com.android.browser.permission.READ_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS</code> permission to read through the user's history in search of URL's from my domain. This is a pretty good solution, but it does not work for other browsers like mobile Firefox. In addition, it requires a shady permission, which I would like to avoid if possible.</p>

<p>The next data point is that when I publish my app on the app-store (after compiling locally on Mac), the file uploads fine. However, after the app auto-updates, the file does not upload due to the FS collection filters.

Here is my html:</p>

        Environment:
        &lt;select data-ng-model=""selectEnvironment""&gt;

        &lt;/select&gt;
        {{selectEnvironment}}
    &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Then in my angular javascript file, I need to create a function that can send 'selectEnvironment' as a string back to my asp.net model below:</p>

<pre><code>public class SelectionModels
{
    public string selectVersion { get; set; }
    public string selectEnv { get; set; }
}

My problem at the moment is that since the input is a text-box, most major browsers attempt to auto-complete entries for the user, which looks very silly over the datepicker:</p>

<p><img src=""http://imgur.com/Qd0Xk.jpg"" alt=""(The auto-complete box appearing over the date-picker.)""></p>

<p>Browsing the internet, I discovered that way back in the days of IE-5, Microsoft had an attribute for input tags called ""autocomplete"", which could disable it. However, that was way back then, and that was IE. Checking on W3Schools revealed that HTML5 <em>also</em> includes an ""autocomplete"" attribute for input tags (yes, I was equally surprised that Microsoft was supporting HTML-5 way back in 1999...). However, our website is not on HTML5 yet, so I cannot rely on using the tag and assuming it will work. Taking these into consideration, how then does one disable auto-complete for a single input box in HTML4? Expected browsers are Chrome (latest), Firefox 3.6, Firefox 2.0 and - god help us - perhaps IE6 (although we have warned everyone that we aren't promising anything will actually work if they use IE6! ;) )</p>

<p>(By the way, for anybody worrying out there, I know that this is attempting to change a user's personal browser settings, which is a naughty thing to do normally. However, in this case I believe it's justified, especially considering 90% of my users won't know what auto-complete is or that it even can be turned off...)</p>

These services return objects with names, ids, and some unique keys pertaining to a <code>foo</code> or a <code>bar</code> name. I also have a service doing the same for businesses, also with names, ids, and what <code>foo</code>/<code>bar</code> is tied to that business. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the data model for this is...not ideal. Rather than just showing which <code>foo</code>/<code>bar</code> is attached to that business, it has every single <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code> for every single business with a <code>published: true/false</code> key/val pair.</p>

<p>What I'm attempting to do is grab the URL name, loop through my <code>foo</code> object, check to see if the name from the current URL and the data match, and if they do store that object in <code>$scope.results</code>. From here, I want to loop through my businesses object and check to see if its <code>conditionData</code> id matches that of the new <code>$scope.results</code> array's id. Once this condition is met, I want to store those businesses in a <code>$scope.businesses</code> array. As it stands right now, I'm getting all businesses returned, rather than just the ones that have the same id as the current <code>$scope.results</code> id. I suspect the issue is either a) I'm a noob (most likely) or b) the <code>published: true/false</code> is creating issues.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help, let me know if I need to clarify anything else. I'm still pretty new to Angular and JS as a whole, so I'm not sure if how I'm attempting to do this is super optimal. I'm open to better ideas if anyone has any. </p>

The eoi_p_id is currently a foreign key from the images table.</p>

<p>This works fine and the query is:</p>

<pre>SELECT
eoi_parentid, eoi_p_id, eoi_po_id, eoi_quantity,
i_id, i_parentid,
po_name, po_price
FROM ecom_order_items, images, c_print_options WHERE eoi_parentid = '1' AND i_id = eoi_p_id AND po_id = eoi_po_id;</pre>

<p>The above would grab all the stuff I need for order #1</p>

<p>Now to complicate things I added an extra table (ecom_products), which needs to act in a similar way to the images table. The eoi_p_id can also point at a foreign key in this table too. I have added an extra field 'eoi_type' which will either have the value 'image', or 'product'.</p>

<p>Now items in the order could be made up of a mix of items from images or ecom_products. Whatever I try it either ends up with too many records, wont actually output any with eoi_type = 'product', and just generally wont work. Any ideas on how to achieve what I am after? Can provide SQL samples if needed?</p>

<pre>
SELECT
eoi_id, eoi_parentid, eoi_p_id, eoi_po_id, eoi_po_id_2, eoi_quantity, eoi_type,
i_id, i_parentid,

ep_id
FROM ecom_order_items, images, c_print_options, ecom_products WHERE eoi_parentid = '9' AND i_id = eoi_p_id AND po_id = eoi_po_id</pre>

<p>The above outputs duplicate rows and doesnt work as expected. Am I going about this the wrong way? Should I have seperate foreign key fields for the eoi_p_id depending it its an image or a product?</p>

<p>Should I be using JOINs?</p>

<p>Explanation: I have a controller class which contains a collection (NSMutableArray) of <code>Post</code> objects. These objects are downloaded from a website, and thus the collection changes from time to time. I would like to be able to use key-value observing to observe the array, so that I can keep my interface updated.</p>

<p>My controller has a <code>posts</code> property, declared as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@property (retain) NSMutableArray *posts;
</code></pre>

<p>If I call @synthesize in my .m file, it will create the <code>-(NSMutableArray *)posts</code> and <code>-(void)setPosts:(NSMutableArray *)obj</code> methods for me. Further, they will be protected by a lock such that two threads cannot stomp on each other while setting (or getting) the value.</p>

<p>However, in order to be key-value coding compliant for a mutable ordered collection, there are a few other methods I need to implement. Specifically, I need to implement <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Concepts/Compliant.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002172-SW2"" rel=""nofollow"">at least the following</a>:</p>

<pre><code>-insertObject:inPostsAtIndex:
-removeObjectFromPostsAtIndex:
</code></pre>

<p>However, since the posts are downloaded asynchronously, I would like to be able to insert new posts into the array on a background thread as well. This means that access needs to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>So, my question. Is there any way to make those accessors thread-safe with the same lock that the @synthesized methods are locked? Or do I have to resort to specifying the <code>setPosts:</code> and <code>posts</code> methods myself in order to guarantee full atomicity across all accessors?</p>

I've made few models, controllers and views - it works great. The problem is that after production, I have to made new table(<strong>Transactionaltemp</strong> table and corresponding model and controller ) in the db that logically is ""connected"" to other tables, but technically does not needs to - for ex. it holds temporary info on user_id, time, ip and similar. So, other tables doesn't need to be directly connected to that.

<pre><code>$this-&gt;loadModel('Transactionaltemp');

<p>I get error - the model is not found (it is true because the model <strong>is missing</strong> in the cache). Interesting enough <code>transactionaltempls_controller</code> is in the cache (in the <code>cake_controllers_list</code> file).
I tried following stuff to resolve the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>clear cache</li>
<li>disable cache</li>
<li>tried using <code>uses={..}</code> code in the controller that I would like to use <code>mymodels_controller</code></li>
<li>tried using <code>init('Transactionaltemp')</code></li>

I have created a blocking queue which I thought was working, but after doing some more testing I have found that if i try and cancel multiple threads that are blocking on the blocking_queue, i seem to get a deadlock.</p>

<p>The blocking queue is very simple and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt; class Blocking_Queue
{
public:
    Blocking_Queue()
    {
        pthread_mutex_init(&amp;_lock, NULL);
        pthread_cond_init(&amp;_cond, NULL);
    }

    ~Blocking_Queue()
    {
        pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;_lock);
        pthread_cond_destroy(&amp;_cond);
    }

    void put(T t)
    {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;_lock);
        _queue.push(t);
        pthread_cond_signal(&amp;_cond);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;_lock);
    }

     T pull()
     {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;_lock);
        while(_queue.empty())
        {
            pthread_cond_wait(&amp;_cond, &amp;_lock);
        }

        T t = _queue.front();
        _queue.pop();

        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;_lock);

        return t;
     }

priavte:
    std::queue&lt;T&gt; _queue;
    pthread_cond_t _cond;
    pthread_mutex_t _lock;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For testing, I have created 4 threads that pull on this blocking queue. I added some print statements to the blocking queue and each thread is getting to the pthread_cond_wait() method. However, when i try to call pthread_cancel() and pthread_join() on each thread the program just hangs. </p>

<p>I have also tested this with just one thread and it works perfectly. </p>

<p>According to documentation, pthread_cond_wait() is a cancellation point, so calling cancel on those threads should cause them to stop execution (and this does work with just 1 thread). However pthread_mutex_lock is not a cancelation point. Could something be happening along the lines of when pthread_cancel() is called, the canceled thread aquires the mutex before terminating and doesn't unlock it, and then when the next thread gets canceled it cannot aquire the mutex and deadlocks? Or is there something else that I am doing wrong.</p>

<p>Any advice would be lovely. Thanks :)</p>

However all subsequent canvases render my texture fonts as simply black squares. I've also noticed that some numbers do not display on the canvas which actually renders. The ""Center Time"" should display 8.3956 but displays the following instead.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VT9Ef.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The font rendering is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_FILL);
    PushGLMatrices();
            GrSetPixelProjection();
            glTranslatef(pixelX, pixelY, 0.0);
            glRotatef(ang, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
            savedFont-&gt;Render(label);
    PopGLMatrices();
</code></pre>

<p>where </p>

<pre><code>    void PushGLMatrices()
    {
            glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
            glPushMatrix();

void PopGLMatrices()
{
    glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
    glPopMatrix();
    glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
    glPopMatrix();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried a few things such as clearning color and depth bits, and glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST); but that didn't seem to help. For some reason, if I add FTTextureFont::FaceSize(int) into one of my routines which returns the width of the text, everything displays correctly (albeit slowly). From looking at the FTGL source code, it doesn't seem like FaceSize() would manipulate the openGL parameters except for a glDeleteTexture() call, so I'm a bit confused why this works. </p>

My program takes in a file, reads each line of the file into an array, and splits the array of strings into smaller arrays of strings. The program then starts up one thread for each of the smaller arrays, and quicksorts them. Once every thread has finished sorting its array, the main thread gathers all the results from the thread objects. It is then supposed to merge the smaller, now sorted, arrays into one large, sorted array.</p>

<p>I have currently solved this using a single threaded merge sort to nest the sorted arrays returned by the quicksorting threads together. Now the problem with this, since the merging does not happen concurrently, that sorting the in-file using a low number of threads (1-4) actually makes the program sort as fast as possible. If I up the number of threads a bit (say 15 threads), the program actually runs quite a bit slower than with fewer threads. To solve this, I wish to introduce concurrency to my merge sort/array nesting.</p>

<p>What I wish to do is: once two threads have finished quicksorting their parts of the in-file, a new thread will nest together these two parts, until every part of the in-file has been sorted.</p>

<p>Every bit of help is greatly appreciated, and I am thankful for example code and/or pseudocode. Thanks in advance! :)</p>

<p>However I need an alternate authentication via servlet.</p>

<p>That's the code of the servlet:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    TokenCallbackHandler tokenCallbackHandler = new TokenCallbackHandler(properties,token);

    LoginContext lc = new LoginContext(""myApp"", tokenCallbackHandler);
    lc.login();
} catch (LoginException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Debbugging the code I saw that the initialize, login and commit were called without error.
The servlet returns an html page with a js that redirect to a protected resource:</p>

<pre><code>function doRedirect() {
    location.href = ""/protectedPath/ProtectedResource.html"";
}
window.setTimeout(""doRedirect()"", 1);
</code></pre>

<p>But when the browser tried to get the protected page the app server returns to the login page.</p>

<p>What I am missing?
It is possibile that with the js redirect I'm losing the session cookie?
Or, is it possible that the problem is that i'm trying to access (through a redirect) to a protected resource from a unprotected resource?</p>

<p>-- EDIT ---</p>

<p>I've taken a look at the cookies: when I login with the servlet it returns a session cookie and when I try to get a protected resource I can see the browser passing that session cookie to the server, but it seems that it got refused, in fact it respond with another session cookie, going to the login form page</p>

<p>-- EDIT ---</p>

<p>Solved in another way.</p>

<p>After some investigation on tomcat authentication mechanism I realized that what I was trying to do was something wrong.</p>

<p>Having defined a security constraint and a form login config to protect my resources I have tell tomcat to manage authentication in its way. So as long as I didn't pass through tomcat authentication workflow I can't authenticate anything. Also I discovered that it's not possibile to configure different login-configuration in the same web application, so having defined form authentication prevents me to authenticate in others way. Probably what I will need is a custom implementations of the class BaseAuthenticator (base class for FormAuthenticator, BasicAuthenticator, etc, containing the code for the respective login configuration) but I'm not sure that it could be a good idea, maybe a security filter will be a better solution.</p>

<p>Knowing anything about security filters in tomcat, I temporarily managed to solve my problem simulating a form authentication in my servlet (really awful, I know).</p>

<li>Without this removal process if the user selects the other option and then goes back and selects option ""job_1"" again, then the form is immediately broken by the duplication of all that content. Yikes.</li>
<li>The backend checking has to be extra careful to do proper checking: are inputs empty because they haven't been filled in, or because they simply don't exist?</li>

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>the code i am trying to use is from one of the posts here
i can break this into two or three separeted lines of code and it will work 
the question is about the expression , and using shortest/modern code.</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;FieldInfo&gt; GetAllFields(Type type) {
    return type.GetNestedTypes().SelectMany(GetAllFields)
               .Concat(type.GetFields());
}
</code></pre>

<p>this will return fieldInfo not the names or values,
and i need it more as a list of string or better a dictionary for both fields-values and names
but a list will do for now.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; (or dictionary) ChosenContainersNamesOrValuesOfAllNested(Type T)
{
   return a shortest syntax for that task, using lambda rather foreach
}
</code></pre>

<p>thanks.</p>

<p>however, for easiest access to the class, is it better to use prototype( = new every time) or singleton?</p>

accessing the object from a list of singletons may be equally expensive. </p>

<p>Specifically on the 211th iteration, the line:</p>

If I remove the print statement completely, or even just print a string, it works fine. But if I print any variable (i, recall, precision, etc.), it throws this exception. It will also throw the same exception if I remove the printing from the loop completely, and just have a single print statement outside of the loop. Any suggestions?</p>

Each worker handles some segment of the total work, according to some hash range we pass it.  It works great.</p>

<p>Now, I've got to cluster this application for failover.  Based on the requirement that only one worker per hash range exist/be triggered on the cluster, it seems to me that setting up each one as a ClusterSingletonManager would make sense..however I'm having trouble getting it working.  The actor system starts up, it creates the ClusterSingletonManager, it adds the path in the code cited below to a Broadcast Router, but it never instantiates my actual worker actor to handle my messages for some reason.  All I get is a log message:  ""unhandled event ${my message} in state Start"".  What am I doing wrong?  Is there something else I need to do to start up this single instance cluster?

<p>when I try to send a message to the actual worker actor, should the path above resolve?  Currently it does not.
What am I doing wrong?  Also, these actors live within a Spring application, and the worker actors are set up with some @Autowired dependencies.  While this Spring integration worked well in a non-clustered environment, are there any gotchyas in a clustered environment I should be looking out for?</p>

I'm declaring an instance of an object called ""Singer"". The instance is called ""singer1"". ""singer1"" produces an audio signal. Now, the following is the code where the specifics of the audio signal are determined:</p>

<pre><code>OSStatus playbackCallback(void *inRefCon,
                      AudioUnitRenderActionFlags *ioActionFlags,
                      const AudioTimeStamp *inTimeStamp,
                      UInt32 inBusNumber, 
                      UInt32 inNumberFrames,
                      AudioBufferList *ioData) {    

//Singer *me = (Singer *)inRefCon;

static int phase = 0;

for(UInt32 i = 0; i &lt; ioData-&gt;mNumberBuffers; i++) {

    int samples = ioData-&gt;mBuffers[i].mDataByteSize / sizeof(SInt16);

    SInt16 values[samples];

    float waves;
    float volume=.5;

    for(int j = 0; j &lt; samples; j++) {


        waves = 0;


        waves += sin(kWaveform * 600 * phase)*volume;
        waves += sin(kWaveform * 400 * phase)*volume;
        waves += sin(kWaveform * 200 * phase)*volume;
        waves += sin(kWaveform * 100 * phase)*volume;            

        waves *= 32500 / 4; // &lt;--------- make sure to divide by how many waves you're stacking

        values[j] = (SInt16)waves;
        values[j] += values[j]&lt;&lt;16;

        phase++;

    }

    memcpy(ioData-&gt;mBuffers[i].mData, values, samples * sizeof(SInt16));

}

return noErr;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>99% of this is borrowed code, so I only have a basic understanding of how it works (I don't know about the OSStatus class or method or whatever this is. However, you see those 4 lines with 600, 400, 200 and 100 in them? Those determine the frequency. Now, what I want to do (for now) is insert my own variable in there in place of a constant, which I can change on a whim. This variable is called ""fr1"". ""fr1"" is declared in the header file, but if I try to compile I get an error about ""fr1"" being undeclared. Currently, my technique to fix this is the following: right beneath where I #import stuff, I add the line </p>

<pre><code>fr1=0.0;//any number will work properly
</code></pre>

<p>This sort of works, as the code will compile and singer1.fr1 will actually change values if I tell it to. The problems are now this:A)even though this compiles and the tone specified will play (0.0 is no tone), I get the warnings ""Data definition has no type or storage class"" and ""Type defaults to 'int' in declaration of 'fr1'"". I bet this is because for some reason it's not seeing my previous declaration in the header file (as a float). However, again, if I leave this line out the code won't compile because ""fr1 is undeclared"". B)Just because I change the value of fr1 doesn't mean that singer1 will update the value stored inside the ""playbackcallback"" variable or whatever is in charge of updating the output buffers. Perhaps this can be fixed by coding differently? C)even if this did work, there is still a noticeable ""gap"" when pausing/playing the audio, which I need to eliminate. This might mean a complete overhaul of the code so that I can ""dynamically"" insert new values without disrupting anything. However, the reason I'm going through all this effort to post is because this method does exactly what I want (I can compute a value mathematically and it goes straight to the DAC, which means I can use it in the future to make triangle, square, etc waves easily). I have uploaded Singer.h and .m to pastebin for your veiwing pleasure, perhaps they will help. Sorry, I can't post 2 HTML tags so here are the full links.
(http://pastebin.com/ewhKW2Tk)
(http://pastebin.com/CNAT4gFv)</p>

<p>So, TL;DR, all I really want to do is be able to define the current equation/value of the 4 waves and re-define them very often without a gap in the sound.
Thanks. (And sorry if the post was confusing or got off track, which I'm pretty sure it did.)</p>

<li><p>Submit form as an ajax request, then go to the next page only if validation is correct. The problem is I must implement something to put every validation error in its place instead of using MVC's features (Spring MVC form tags, in my case).</p></li>
<li><p>Submit form. If there is an error, send a page with a ""history.back()"" in javascript. My file will be there again, but I have no easy way to show validation messages.</p></li>

<p>I think both solutions are very very clumsy. But selecting the files every time there is a validation error isn't a good solution too.</p>

        }
    ]

}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>And code in PHP looks like</p>

<pre><code>$url2 = file_get_contents(""url"");
$content = json_decode($url2, true);
$_SESSION['steam_steamid'] = $content['response']['players'][0]['steamid'];
$steamprofile['steamid'] = $_SESSION['steam_steamid'];
</code></pre>

<p>And this one above is working well. Could you please explain me why there is 0 between ""steamid"" and ""players""? Also it looks like the session name matters, am I right? I was doing some tests and when I changed the name session it didn't work.</p>

<p>So here's what I am working on
JSON code: </p>

<pre><code>{
    ""friendslist"": {
        ""friends"": [
            {
                ""steamid"": ""765hidden"",
                ""relationship"": ""friend"",
                ""friend_since"": 1428495026
            },
            {
                ""steamid"": ""764hidden"",
                ""relationship"": ""friend"",
                ""friend_since"": 1355599210
            },
            {
                ""steamid"": ""764hidden"",
                ""relationship"": ""friend"",
                ""friend_since"": 1423504205
            },
            much more friends
        ]

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I want to get the steamid and I got no idea how to get it. I've tried to get relationship as steamID is already used above:</p>

<pre><code>$url3 = file_get_contents(""url2"");
$content2 = json_decode($url3, true);
$_SESSION['steam_relationship'] = $content2['friendslist']['friends'][0]['relationship'];
$steamfriends['friend'] = $_SESSION['steam_relationship'];
</code></pre>

<p>And of course echo $steamfriend['friend'] is not working. I see that person who made these PHP files already know what are the session names (if they need to be right to work). Any ideas where can I find it? </p>

<p>I feel really ashamed that I can't figure it myself.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>

<p>from this link, i believe that the touch event will be dispatched from activity to corresponding listener which i was able to capture, but is it posible to detect the view itself as the event handling flow is going back to top(Activity)?</p>

<p>fyi the listeners are located in many fragments, activities and custom views. </p>

<p>thanks, any help is really appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm using boost::interprocess to create the shared memory area. My understanding of boost::optional was that it was a discriminated union rather than a nullable pointer.
As a counter-example things like std::map and std::vector which use the heap need an explicit allocator to use them in interprocess memory, but boost::optional, I was fairly sure does not use the heap and is equivalent to writing:</p>

<pre><code>struct ThingThatWillGoInSharedMemory {
    bool value_initialised;

<p>So it can be used out of the box. I'd be delighted if someone confirms this - I didn't see that the interprocess case was explicitly mentioned in the boost::optional docs, only implied.</p>

"12815546","1","","","2012-10-10 08:54:24","","0","111","<p>I have an application which routes requests depending on <code>predefined URLs</code> in the following manners:</p>

<p><strong>1st step: Cache lookup</strong><br>
All the <code>URLS</code> are aggregated into a single <code>array</code> (which is serialized and stored in cache) which structure is as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Each <code>array key</code> represents a <code>URL</code>  </li>
<li>The <code>URL</code> information (i.e. what to do with the <code>URL</code>) is defined as the corresponding <code>array value</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, this gives me (FYI <code>PHP 5.4</code> array syntax):  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

// structure of the cached URLS array
$cached_urls = [
    '/pageA' =&gt; [
        'controller' =&gt; 'ProductController',
        'content_id' =&gt; 1234
    ],
    '/serviceA' =&gt; [
        'controller' =&gt; 'ServiceController',
        'content_id' =&gt; 45678
    ]
];

// working with the array (retrieve $cached_urls from cache, then...)
if (!isset($cached_urls[$request['url']])) {
    // 404
} else {
    $url = $cached_urls[$request['url']];
    // further actions based on $url
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2nd step: DB lookup &amp; cache rebuilding</strong><br>
if the <code>$cached_urls</code> array could not be retrieved from cache I do 3 things:  </p>

<ul>
<li>retrieve the <code>URL</code> information from a <code>url</code> table (where each <code>row</code> represents <code>1 URL</code> and the <code>URL</code> itself is the field used to filter the query) and other related tables.</li>
<li>Process the request the same way I would to it in the cache scenario once I have <code>$url</code></li>
<li>Rebuild the cache so that next time a request comes in, I don't have to do a DB lookup,</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of execution speed, here is what we have (from faster to slower):  </p>

<ol>
<li>Cache Lookup  ( ~10ms)  </li>
<li>DB lookup     ( ~100ms) </li>
<li>Rebuilding the cache ( ~2000ms)</li>
</ol>

<p>When the cache is available, page are served very fast, however every time the cache gets rebuilt (which is about every minute), pages take a couple of seconds to be served, which is a problem. Therefore I was wondering:</p>

<p><strong>What are the design patterns available in PHP to perform asynchronous processing (which in my case would be used to rebuild the cache) while avoiding the same tasks to be executed several times concurrently (as I only need the cache to be rebuilt once at a time until it is rebuilt, not for every request that hits my application in the meantime)?</strong></p>

<p>I have success tried encrypt a string, but not to decrypt it back... please help me. This is example code to encrypt that I tested before:</p>

<pre><code>String data = ""HELP"";
String enc = """";
try {
enc = Aes.encrypt(""1234567890"", data);
Log.i(""ENCRYPT"", data + "" TO "" + enc);
} catch (Exception e) {
// TODO Auto-generated catch block
e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>AND RESULT IS : 48F1880B</p>

<p>My question is, how to decrypt it? I was test using my code above but result not equal to plaintext! please help me...</p>

<p>I have a template, like this, simplified:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""unit""&gt;miles&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm replacing an element with jquery and ajax:</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON('/getunit/', function(data){
   $('#unitHolder').html(data.unit_html);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Which goes to a view function to retrieve json data (more data than just this template).  So I wanted to serve it up as json, and not just a string.  So, the relevant code is this:</p>

<pre><code>    ...
    context = { 'qs' : queryset }
    data['unit'] = render_to_string('map/unit.html', context)
    data = str(data).replace('\'','""') #json wants double quotes
return HttpResponse(data, mimetype=""application/json"")
</code></pre>

<p>This works for all of our other data, but not the template, because it has double quotes in it, that are not escaped.  My question is, how do you escape a string in python to be used in a json format?  Note that render_to_string() renders the string in unicode, thus <code>u""&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;""</code>.</p>

<h2>I've tried</h2>

<pre><code>import json
data['unit'] = json.dumps(render_to_string('map/unit.html', context))
</code></pre>

<p>But that gives me <code>""unit"": """"&lt;span class=\\""unit\\""&gt;miles&lt;/span&gt;""""</code>.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>data['unit'] = str(render_to_string('map/unit.html', context)).replace('""','\""')
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>data['unit'] = str(render_to_string('map/unit.html', context)).replace('""','\\""')
</code></pre>

<p>But neither escape the double quotes properly.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Thank you Craigy and Matthew</p>

<p>Craigy:On a real phone i can't see those red and white little rectangles. Everything else work as exepected.By the way :only the the zone that fill the blue rectangle is an GLSurfaceView everything else has no link with opengl!Sorry if i can't provide a screenshot from a real device.My app was tested by  2 friends on their device's.</p>

<p>Matthew:the only thing where i use texture is displaying:1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and s,f,d,p.And what's funny is that they are rendered well on a real device.My question is why drawing texture's affects drawing and translating those rectangles.Anyway i will play a little more with the info you suggested me and i will let you guys now!</p>

<p>If you have any new intel about these problem...please i beg you..it's driving me nut's just displaying a few rectangles and some text give me so much problem's!!</p>

<p>Everything is working as expected except when I try to emit a signal from a 'load' function. This signal is picked up by the main window, in a slot designed to resort the table with new information.</p>

<p>Without the signal emitted, the table populates fully and properly:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zgZtX.png"" alt=""Normal view, no signal""></p>

<p>By uncommenting the <code>self.emit</code> so that the signal IS emitted, the table ends up being incomplete:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y0KO9.png"" alt=""Signal emitted, blank cells""></p>

<p>As you can see in the first image, the table is NOT sorted, but all fields are populated. In the second image, the table is sorted, but some fields are blank!</p>

<p>The code that populates the table and sends the signal:</p>

<pre><code>#openLog function does stuff, then populates the table as follows

self.ui.tableWidget.setRowCount(len(entries))
self.ui.tableWidget.verticalHeader().setVisible(False)

for i, row in enumerate(entries):
    for j, col in enumerate(row):
        item = QtGui.QTableWidgetItem(col)
        self.ui.tableWidget.setItem(i, j, item)

#When this is uncommented, the table ends up having a lot of blank cells.
#self.emit(QtCore.SIGNAL(""updateSignal""))
</code></pre>

<p>The code for receiving the signal, and acting:</p>

<pre><code>#main window class
    #__init__
        self.ui.tableWidget.connect(self,QtCore.SIGNAL(""updateSignal""),self.updateTable)

    def updateTable(self):
        self.ui.tableWidget.sortItems(0,QtCore.Qt.DescendingOrder)
</code></pre>

<p>The program flow is called as : program_init->register_signal. User action to open log ->openLog function that populates table/emit signal->signal received/ resort table</p>

<p>For this method, I am using signals and slots, as if I do not, QT/Python throws a bunch of warnings about it not being safe to redraw the GUI/Pixmap from the function.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
    How can I make the QTableWidget sort on the column I desire, while also ensuring the table is fully populated?</p>

<p>Let's say you have a simple page which has a logo and a heading only and one paragraph</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/StackExchangeLogo1.png""&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Foo Bar&lt;/h1&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>This is how that looks like</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DV7Et.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>That page, obviously would not have  vertical overflow / scroll bar for almost even tiny scale mobile devices, let alone computers.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How can you bring that heading to the top left of the screen and move the logo out of focus unless someone scrolls up?  Open to using any JavaScript library and any CSS framework</p>

<p><strong>Attempts:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Tried using anchors but they only work if the page already had a scroll bar and anchor was out of focus. </li>
<li>Tried <code>window.scrollTo</code> but that also requires the page to have scroll already</li>
<li>Tried <code>$(""html, body"").animate({ scrollTop: 90}, 100);</code> but that also doesn't work when the page doesn't have overflow</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YMlG5.png"" alt=""Expected outcome:""></strong></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>Please note that adding some extra <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> to induce an overflow is not the way to go, it can be done that way but that's a very ordinary workaround</p>

<p><strong>Why is it needed?</strong></p>

<p>Its for a form for mobile devices, simple requirement is to take the first field of the form to top of the page and hide the logo (one can scroll up if they wish to see it) so it doesn't take attention away. Not using jQueryMobile for this particular task.</p>

But, let's say I just downloaded MPlayer for Mac OS X (or whatever). I want all my movies to open in MPlayer. Then, I decide to move MPlayer's app bundle (hey, it's portable, right?).

<pre><code>1. Drag-n-drop a TextBox on a form. Add any other focusable control such as a button on the form.
2. Add 2 event handlers for that TextBox as follow:
   private void textBox_GotFocus(object sender, EventArgs e){
      ((TextBox)sender).HideSelection = false; //&lt;-- exception highlighted at here.
   }

   private void textBox_LostFocus(object sender, EventArgs e){
      ((TextBox)sender).HideSelection = true;
   }

3. Run the form and first click on the textBox, then click on the button then click on the textBox again -&gt; the exception will throw: Win32Exception - error creating window handle.
</code></pre>

<p>The code is simply to make the HideSelection change accordingly when the textBox gets focused and loses focus.</p>

<p>Your help would be highly appreciated! In fact this is discovered by chance, I don't work on any project with this. So it's not urgent. :)</p>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>I don't know why is so volatile, I created another project and now the problem is different, there is no exception but an indefinite loop which makes the textbox flicker, the form doesn't seem to responsive, the CPU usage is consumed up to about 17-20%. The last demo is still opened and that demo still has the <code>Win32Exception</code> thrown. Not a clue at all. Now the code of the two projects are the same but the problems are different.</p>

I have this code:
it is supposed to receive a 2d matrix of size chunk and width.
Matrix is allocated using  :</p>

<pre><code>int **alloc2d(int n, int m) {
    int i = 0;
    int *data = malloc(n * m * sizeof(int));
    int **array = malloc(n * sizeof(int *));

        array[i] = &amp;(data[i * m]);
    }
    return array;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So it is a continuos memory block.</p>

<p>I have the following code :</p>

<pre><code>MPI_Status st;
int worker;
       for(i = 1; i &lt; size; i++) {
        MPI_Recv(&amp;(recmat[0][0]), chunk*width, MPI_INT, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, 1,
                                 MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;st);

        worker = st.MPI_SOURCE;
      /*  for(k = worker * chunk; k &lt; (worker + 1) * chunk; k++){
            for(j = 0; j &lt; width; j++) {
                mat[k][j] = recmat[k - worker * chunk][j];
                }
            }*/
        }
</code></pre>

<p>If code is like this, everything stops and works well.
If I uncomment the  region:</p>

<pre><code>for(k = worker * chunk; k &lt; (worker + 1) * chunk; k++){
                for(j = 0; j &lt; width; j++) {
                    mat[k][j] = recmat[k - worker * chunk][j];
                    }
                }
</code></pre>

<p>the thread running this code does not stop, I cannot find an logical explanation for this. Perhaps someone can see the error or the issue. Thank you!</p>

<p>recmat allocation and chunk calculation :       </p>

<pre><code>        $('.mySlider').flexslider({
        slideshowSpeed: 1000,
        animationSpeed: 0,
        start: function (slider) {

            slider.vars.animationSpeed = 3500;
            slider.play();
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>I have to set the slideshowSpeed to something large enough so that the full slideshow does not rattle through before the speed has been changed. I set the animationspeed to 0 first and then to some finite value. This works in all browsers, in principle, except that it does not work on mobile devices. Not Android, not iPad, not even the device simulator in Chrome. If I put a breakpoint in my callback function it gets hit and the slideshow speed is changed as expected, but the animation speed is not. It remains at 0, or whatever other value I set it initially. </p>

<p>So my question is two-fold: the primary goal is to prevent the first slide from fading. If this can be accomplished in another way, without the event callback, then I don't need to solve the mobile browser issue. If not, I would like to know how I can change the animation speed on a mobile browser.</p>

<p><a href=""http://cbstark.com"" rel=""nofollow"">This</a> is the site. I turned off the start callback for now - it is the lesser evil to have the first slide fade in, but it is not ideal.</p>

function drawGraph(response) {

<p>It changes only a few times per week.</p>

<p>But if it changes, I need to invalidate all cached values which used the old TicketTypes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately some cache keys are not fixed. They contain computed data.</p>

<p>I see these solutions:</p>

<p>Use the <code>version</code> argument and update the version value on a post save signal handler of <code>TicketType</code>.</p>

<p>Use a common prefix for all cache keys which are based on TicketType.
Then invalidate all cache keys in a post save signal handler.</p>

<p>I guess there is a third, and better way ...</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>TicketType is a tree. Visibility of TicketTypes are bound to permissions. Two users might see the tree in a different way, if they have different permissions. We cache it, according to the permissions. The permissions of a user gets serialized and hashed. The cache key gets created by creating a string which contains the hash and a fixed part:</p>

<pre><code>hash_key='ticket-type-tree--%s' % hashed_permissions
</code></pre>

<p>If the TicketType tree changes, we need to be sure, that no old data gets loaded from the cache. Active invalidating is not needed, as long as no old data gets used. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the container is exited, the state of the file system and its exit value is preserved. You can start, stop, and restart a container. The processes restart from scratch (their memory state is not preserved in a container), but the file system is just as it was when the container was stopped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tested this out by settting up a container with memcached running, wrote a value to memcache and then</p>

<ul>
<li>Stopped &amp; then restarted the container - the memcached value was gone</li>
<li>Paused &amp; then unpaused the container - the memcached value was still intact</li>
</ul>

<p>Somewhere in the docs - I can no longer find the precise document - I read that stopped containers do not consume CPU or memory.  However:</p>

<ul>
<li>I suppose the fact that the file system state is preserved means that the container still does consume some space on the host's file system?</li>
<li>Is there a performance hit (other than host disk space consumption) associated with having 10s, or even 100s, of stopped containers in the system? For instance, does it make it any harder for Docker to startup and manage new containers?</li>
<li>And finally, if Paused containers retain their memory state when Unpaused - as demonstrated by their ability to remember memcached keys - do they have a different impact on CPU and memory?</li>

<p>When for loop end, it will append 3 posts. It mean, each loop we have like :</p>

<p>You can see : <code>link2 is repeated</code>. I want catch on each loop and break if it is repeated.</p>

<p>It means I have result like :</p>

<p>My doubt is, how are BGP control packets transmitted between PEs.</p>

<p>There are two options.<br>
1. To use the Label switched paths between PEs.<br>
2. To use normal IP forwarding through the P routers.</p>

<p>Which of these two methods is actually used?<br>
If both can be used how does the PE router make a decision on which one to use?<br>
Do we have to manually configure it in the router?<br>
Do these answers vary for different routers like Juniper, Cisco etc. ?  </p>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I use neither CVS nor SVN, I use git. I know that it's possible to write a plugin for git, and perhaps someone has, but I'm not going to use some plugin that I don't know if it will be maintained and supported. Also, git is tracking more than the source folder, the repo includes other files which shouldn't be packed in the distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>I thought that one of the perks of Distribute is not having to deal with a <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file. Do I really have to? If so, where do I see a guide? I've never written a <code>MANIFEST.in</code>.</p></li>

To illustrate the problem, I'll use a simple differential equation and only one plot command. If I write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>{Plot[x[t], {t, 0, 10}], x[4]} 
/. NDSolve[{x'[s] == - x[s], x[0] == 1}, x, {s, 0, 10}]
</code></pre>

<p>It solves the equation and calculates x[4] with no problem, but the plot turns empty, and I have no idea why.</p>

<p>In my actual problem, my equation is a quite complicated system for several functions, and instead of <strong>x[4]</strong> I draw a parametric plot of the solved functions. I ultimately intend to include all this in a <strong>Manipulate</strong> statement so I don't want the <strong>NDSolve</strong> statement to appear more than once (takes too long) and I can't just calculate it in advance (since it has a lot of parameters).</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Edit: I would like to clarify and expand my question: What I actually want to do is to include my plotting statement in a <strong>Manipulate</strong> statement in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>Manipulate[{Plot[x[t], {t, 0, 10}], x[4]} 
/. NDSolve[{x'[s] == - a*x[s], x[0] == 1}, x, {s, 0, 10}]
,{{a,1},0,5}]
</code></pre>

<p>Since only the <strong>Manipulate</strong> statement gives value to the parameter <em>a</em>, I can't calculate the answer to the <strong>NDSolve</strong> beforehand. Also, since my actual equation system is very complicated and non-linear, I can't use the symbolic function <strong>DSolve</strong>.</p>

<p>Sorry if it wasn't clear before.</p>

<pre><code>UIAccelerometer *accel = [UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer];
accel.delegate = self;
accel.updateInterval = kUpdateInterval;
</code></pre>

<p>When the level ends, this controller gets dealloc'd and freed.  Previously, I was getting a crash after this controller was freed because I didn't nil out the delegate on UIAccelerometer  (i.e. it was still sending events to an object that has now been freed).  So now, inside of dealloc, I'm doing this:</p>

<pre><code>UIAccelerometer *accel = [UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer];
accel.delegate = nil;

<p>All is well and good and the first level plays without a hitch.  The problem happens when I get to the next level, create a new level controller and run that first batch of code again (setting the new contoller now as the delegate).  After this, I'm not getting any calls from the Accelerometer.</p>

<p>So the question is, are you only allowed to have one delegate per app for the Accelerometer, or am I just missing something?  I haven't seen anything in the docs that disallows setting the delegate multiple times.  I'm slightly new to Obj-C, but as far as I understand delegates this shouldn't be too unorthodox.</p>

<p>Note: I know that in 3.0 I could just listen for shake notifications.  Unfortunately, I need something else to be first responder the entire time I'm interested in the shake.  So I can't just refactor to that option.</p>

<p>I am allowing the users to send mail using their own SMTP credentials so it actually does come from them.</p>

<p>But they will be sent from the Rails app, so that means for each user I need to send their emails using their own SMTP server.</p>

<p>How can I do that?</p>

"11013372","1","","","2012-06-13 10:55:23","","0","1730","<p>This is a very weird architecture. Please bear with me.</p>

<p>We have an existing tiered application (data, logic/service, client).
The latest requirement is that the service layer should access two data sources!!!! (no other way around)
These two data sources have the same DB schema.</p>

<p>As with most tiered architectures, we have read and write methods like:</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; GetAllProducts(),
Product GetProductById(ProductKey id),
IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; FindProductsByName(string name)
</code></pre>

<p>the product DTOs are:</p>

<pre><code>class Product
{
    public ProductKey Key { get; set;}
    ...
}

class ProductKey
{
    public long ID { get; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We narrowed it down to two possible solutions:</p>

<p>Alternative 1:
Add a parameter into the read methods so that the service knows what DB to use like so:
Product GetProductById(ProductKey id, DataSource dataSource)
<code>DataSource</code> is an enumeration.</p>

<p>Alternative 2 (my solution):
Add the DataSource property to the key classes. this will be set by Entity Framework when the object is retrieved. Also, this will not be persisted into the db.</p>

<pre><code>class ProductKey
{
    public long ID { get; }
    public DataSource Source { get; } //enum
}
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage is that the change will have minimal impact to the client.</p>

<p>However, people dont like this solution because</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>DataSource</code> doesn't add business value. (My response is that
the <code>ID</code> doesn't add business value either. Its a surrogate key. Its
purpose is for tracking the persistence)</li>
<li>The children in the object graph will also contain <code>DataSource</code> which is redundant</li>
</ul>

<p>Which solution is more sound? Do you have other alternatives?</p>

<p>Note: these services are used everywhere.</p>

<p>To get around this, do you need to make the changes to getMail() outlined in this post:
<a href=""http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/1073/P30/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/1073/P30/</a></p>

<p>I want to do something very simple:<br>
- create an e-mail template<br>
- do not have to make reference to that template in any config files.<br>
- programmatically send an e-mail using the template defined above<br>
    - supply values to replace any tags in the template<br>
    - supply recipient e-mail addresses<br>
    - supply other bits, like a from address  </p>

<p>So first step - create a template.<br>
    - In Confguration/Transactional Emails I believe I am supposed to see a list of templates. I see nothing. But if I add a new template, I can select from a list of templates.<br>
    - Give template a name of ""Bob"".<br>
    - Add a few vars to the template:<br>
        myvar1={{var myvar1}}<br>
        myvar2={{var myvar2}}<br>
    - Save the template; it is given an Id of 1.  </p>

<p>Now send the e-mail programmatically from a controller action:<br>
    - No need to make change to LINEEND in Mime.php as it is already set to \n in version 1.4.2.0<br>
    - Make changes to getMail() in Template.php as specified in this post: <a href=""http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/1073/P30/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/1073/P30/</a><br>
    - Write code in the controller action to send the e-mail:</p>

<pre><code>    This returns nothing:  
    $emailTemplate  = Mage::getModel('core/email_template')-&gt;loadDefault('no matter what goes here emailTemplate is not set');

    This does return an email template:
    $emailTemplate  = Mage::getModel('core/email_template')-&gt;loadByCode('Bob');

    but the call to send below fails:
    $emailTemplate-&gt;setSenderEmail('sent@byme.com');
    $emailTemplate-&gt;setSenderName('Steve');
    $emailTemplateVariables = array();
    $emailTemplateVariables['myvar1'] = 'TestValue1';
    $emailTemplateVariables['myvar2'] = 'TestValue2';
    // $processedTemplate = $emailTemplate-&gt;getProcessedTemplate($emailTemplateVariables); -- this returns nothing
    $emailTemplate-&gt;send('thisisme@mydomain.com','John', $emailTemplateVariables);
In the system.log I get the warning below, and no e-mail ever arrives.
Warning: stream_socket_enable_crypto() [&lt;a href='streams.crypto'&gt;streams.crypto&lt;/a&gt;]: this stream does not support SSL/crypto  in C:\Applications\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs\magento\lib\Zend\Mail\Protocol\Smtp.php on line 206

<p>Should I be using loadByCode? I wish there was some worthwhile documentation (the help for loadByCode is ""Load template by code"" !!). Should I be using send, sendTransactional? Oh for a bit of quality documentation.</p>

<p>I compiled it using <strong>VS2008, 64bit in release mode, without optimization and debug information</strong>. The result was not surprising: all three kinds of multiplication last exactly the same time, with difference in just a few milliseconds. My question is: why is that so? If I make a mistake and multiply a number by 1.0 instead of 1, and I do not use any compiler optimization, then my multiplication will last much longer than multiplying a number by 1! When humans multiply, then the shorter the number, the faster we come to the result. How does computer multiply so that it does not matter, how long the two numbers are?</p>

<p>Apart from that, I decided to check whether debugging influences runtime speed. In this case, it does not: compiling with <code>\DEBUG</code> option or without, multiplication always takes exactly the same amount of time.</p>

<p>With optimization enabled <code>\O2</code>, the same multiplication lasts only a thousandth of a second. What does optimization do in this case? How can such a compact code of multiplying two doubles in C++ be optimized?</p>

<p>I would be grateful for any explanation, <strong>what happens during double multiplication in C++</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem is that embedded glassfish uses the classes in ""target/classes"" and maven cobertura uses ""target/generated-classes/cobertura"". Then, the first time the tests run it's ok, but in the second time, when cobertura run, I receive a java.lang.RuntimeException: javax.naming.NamingException (probably because cobertura is working on ""target/generated-classes/cobertura"" while glassfish is working on ""target/classes"").</p>

<p>I'm new to angular so any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The only <em>not known</em> variable is <code>PDFWIDTH</code> but I will have that in a <code>$scope.pdf_width</code> variable when the template loads.</p>

<p><strong>JQUERY FUNCTION</strong></p>

<pre><code>function zoomProject() { 

    var maxWidth = $(""#formBox"").width(), percent = maxWidth / PDFWIDTH;

    $(""#formScale"").css({
        'transform': 'scale(' + percent + ')',
        '-moz-transform': 'scale(' + percent + ')',
        '-webkit-transform': 'scale(' + percent + ')',
        '-ms-transform': 'scale(' + percent + ')'
    });
    $("".trimSpace"").css('width', (PDFWIDTH * percent) + 'px');
    $(""#formBox, .trimSpace"").css('height', ($(""#formScale"").height() * percent) + 'px');

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""formBox""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""trimSpace""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""formScale""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I have the basis down to make resize an element to fit the entire window width and height. I'm trying to figure out the most appropriate way to do it.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Just copy the jquery stuff I have above and make it sort of like how the below directive works? Or do you think there is a better javascript/angular way of doing it?</p>

<pre><code>.directive('zoom', function ($window) {
    return function (scope, element) {
        var w = angular.element($window);
        scope.getWindowDimensions = function () { return { 'h': w.height(), 'w': w.width() }; };
        scope.$watch(scope.getWindowDimensions, function (newValue, oldValue) {
            scope.windowHeight = newValue.h;
            scope.windowWidth = newValue.w;
            scope.style = function (amount) { return {  'height': (newValue.h - amount) + 'px', 'width': (newValue.w - amount) + 'px' }; };
        }, true);
        w.bind('resize', function () { scope.$apply(); });
    }
})

I also reduced the magento log retention from 180 days to 5 days only.</p>

<p>Today it happened again, <code>whm, cpanel or the domain</code> itself its completely inaccessible.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is due to search engines crawling our website or not?  Last week I reduced in google webmaster tools the speed of the crawl.</p>

<p>I've noticed that some other apps also exhibit a similar behavior where they flicker on-screen but the titlebar artifact is not visible in the captured screenshot.  Apps that do this include Office 2010, IE 10, and the Trillian tabbed chat window &mdash; in other words, windows that extend the non-client area seem to have this issue.</p>

<p>The code that reproduces this is simple:</p>

<pre><code>player.cueVideoById({videoId:String,

<p>This works nicely on desktop browsers, but both in Android and Windows Phone 8 I get the standard Youtube message saying that the video is currently unavailable. If I switch the cueVideoById back to the argument syntax like this, everything works:</p>

<p>I need to select blog posts based on recent activity in the post's comments collection (a Post has a <code>List&lt;Comment&gt;</code> property and likewise, a Comment has a Post property, establishing the relationship. I don't want to show the same post twice, and I only need a subset of the entities, not all of the posts.</p>

<p>First thought was to grab all posts that have comments, then order those based on the most recent comment.  For this to work, I'm pretty sure I'd have to limit the comments for each Post to the first/newest Comment.  Last I'd simply take the top 5 (or whatever max results number I want to pass into the method).</p>

<p>Second thought would be to grab all of the comments, ordered by CreatedOn, and filter so there's only one Comment per Post.  Then return those top (whatever) posts.  This seems like the same as the first option, just going through the back door.</p>

<p>I've got an ugly, two query option I've got working with some LINQ on the side for filtering, but I know there's a more elegant way to do it in using the NHibernate API.  Hoping to see some good ideas here.</p>

var comments = Session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Comment)).AddOrder(new Order(""CreatedOn"", false)).List&lt;Comment&gt;();

// filter the comments

foreach(var postID in postIDs)
{
    var post = Get(postID); // get a Post by ID
    if(!posts.Contains(post)) // this ""if"" is redundant due to the Distinct filter on the PostIDs collection
    {

<p>This is right because the question marks ? introduce the begining of request parameters. 
I've tried to use the js function <code>encodeURI(query)</code> but the question mark character is not encoded. How to encode a question mark in url ?
Thanks</p>

<p>I'm writing some Fortran code and I'd like to make use of some F2003 OOP features, but I'm hitting some stumbling blocks. Paring down the example, I wish to have two derived types A and B, each of which have a pointer to instances of the other. In Fortran, circular dependencies between modules are explicitly disallowed, so these two types would have to reside in the same module. This compiles:</p>

<pre><code>module testModule
implicit none

type A
 type(B),pointer :: b1
end type A

type B
 type(A),pointer :: a1
end type B

contains
[some possibly type-bound procedures]
end module
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I want to implement some constructors for these types, and try this code:</p>

<pre><code>module testModule
implicit none

type A
 type(B),pointer :: b1
end type A

interface A
 module procedure A_ctor
end interface

type B
 type(A),pointer :: a1
end type B

interface B
 module procedure B_ctor
end interface

contains
function A_ctor()
 type(A),target :: A_ctor
end function
function B_ctor()
 type(B),target :: B_ctor
end function
end module
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this doesn't compile, throwing an error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is not a derived type name.  [B]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>on line 5 above. Why does adding the interfaces throw an error? How does one handle circular dependencies in derived types in Fortran, as one would use a forward class declaration in C++?</p>

"32671366","1","32671746","","2015-09-19 17:43:23","","0","24","<p>I'm performing form validation using JQuery/AJAX. When an entry is missing or malformed, I want to send a message via alert() and return the user to the form with all fields as they were so the user can edit them and try submitting the form again. I also don't want the user to get a series of alert() boxes for each field that is malformed, but rather the first field that is discovered to be malformed should issue an alert() box; upon clicking the alert() box, the user may then return to editing the form. If there are 6 malformed fields, I don't want a series of 6 consecutive alert() boxes, but rather just the first one discovered by the routine to be errant and a return to the form (eventually the user will get them all right).</p>

<p>I have utilized a method that works, although it's not elegant and rather tedious to edit and error-prone...it's like a series of Russian dolls, where the first error prevents the successive routines from being run. When there are 5 fields or fields that require multiple kinds of integrity checking, the number of nested IF-ELSE statements increases exponentially, and for forms where I'm passing data via GET to a PHP file, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.get('admin_email_length_check.php', { new_email: $('#new_email').val(), max_email_length: max_email_length }, function(data) {
    if (data != 0) {
        alert(data);
    } else {    
</code></pre>

<p>...it has to be closed out with:</p>

<pre><code>    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>...not just a simple:</p>

<pre><code>}
</code></pre>

<p>But here's a short routine for a 2 field validation. I set allow_submit to FALSE and prevent submission until all integrity checks are passed, at which point allow_submit becomes TRUE and I dynamically re-submit the form; this means that the integrity check (and its e.preventDefault();) will be bypassed entirely and the form will then be processed. Again, it works, but the kind of IF-ELSE structures I need to construct for forms with many fields that require many types of form validation requires extremely LONG structures with carefully edited closing braces (or braces + parentheses + ;, etc.) Is there a shorter or more elegant way to do this?:</p>

<pre><code>var allow_submit = false;
$('#change_password_form').on('submit', function(e) {
    if (!allow_submit) {
        e.preventDefault();
        // First ensure that at least one of the fields has a value:
        if (($('#new_password').val() == '') &amp;&amp; ($('#retype_password').val() == '')) {
            alert(""Nothing specified in either of the 'Change Password' fields.\n\nAdd data and re-submit.\n"");
        } else {
            // Ensure both fields are filled:
            if (($('#new_password').val() == '') || ($('#retype_password').val() == '')) {
                alert(""When changing your password, both the 'New Password' and the 'Retype Password' fields must be filled.\n\nPlease supply new, matching passwords in both fields and re-submit.\n"");
            } else {
                // Do the two fields match?
                if ($('#new_password').val() != $('#retype_password').val()) {
                    alert(""New Password fields do not match.\n\nPlease edit password fields and re-submit.\n"");
                 } else {
                    allow_submit = true;

<p>When I need to shutdown the socket I use a function which checks if the receive thread is still running and if it is calls <code>TerminateThread</code> to end it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>DWORD dwExitCode = 0;
if( GetExitCodeThread( theApp.m_hRecvThread, &amp;dwExitCode ) &amp;&amp; dwExitCode == STILL_ACTIVE )
     TerminateThread( theApp.m_hRecvThread, 0 );

<p>However, <code>GetExitCodeThread</code> returns <code>FALSE</code>, and when polling <code>GetLastError()</code> it returns 6 (<code>ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE</code>). Which suggests that I do not have the <code>THREAD_QUERY_INFORMATION</code> or <code>THREAD_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION</code> access rights on the <code>m_hRecvThread</code> handle.</p>

<p>My <code>m_hRecvThread</code> handle is set when creating the thread like so:</p>

<pre><code>m_hRecvThread = AfxBeginThread( RecvThread, hWndMainFrame );

<p>This successfully creates the thread, and the thread is running fine and exhibiting expected functionality. The <code>TerminateThread</code> and <code>GetExitCodeThread</code> are being called from the same thread which created the Receive thread in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My understanding was that when using <code>AfxBeginThread</code>, the <code>HANDLE</code> returned had <code>THREAD_ALL_ACCESS</code> access rights, is this the case, and if so, why am I still getting <code>ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE</code>?</p>

"7697232","1","7697346","","2011-10-08 13:50:37","","2","563","<p>Is there a way to determine the smallest elapsed time between two ticks of DateTime.Now? I could time it with a stopwatch, but is there some method for the operating system to report this in .NET?</p>

<p>In other words - how accurate is DateTime.Now?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>This is important, as I am writing a DateTimePrecision class which stores both DateTime.Now, ticks from StopWatch, and the Stopwatch ticks-per-second constant. When working out the TimeSpan between two DateTimePrecision values, if the difference is less than the quantum for DateTime.Now, then use Stopwatch, otherwise use DateTime.Now.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Several people have queried why its necessary to use <code>DateTime</code> at all, if you are comparing two times.</p>

<p>The reason is that <code>StopWatch</code> will slowly drift over a period of hours or days, until your timing is <strong>seconds</strong> out.</p>

<p>I correct for this by storing both <code>DateTime</code> and <code>Stopwatch</code> in a structure, and using a metric to return the one which is currently either the most precise, or the most accurate. </p>

<p>This way I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsecond precision when comparing times A and B that are a few seconds apart;</li>
<li>Millisecond precision when comparing times A and B that are days apart.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my timer class, if two times are being compared to calculate a delta, the switchover point is determined by a metric which takes <code>System.Runtime.IOThreadTimer.GetSystemTimeResolution()</code> into account.</p>

<p>The absolute error of the delta between two times A and B:</p>

<ul>
<li>Starts out accurate to the microsecond;</li>
<li>Drifts up, over a few hours or days, to a <strong>maximum</strong> of <code>System.Runtime.IOThreadTimer.GetSystemTimeResolution()</code> which is a few tens of milliseconds. </li>
</ul>

<p>Again, relying on <code>Stopwatch</code> by itself will result in deltas that are seconds out, if you are measuring across many days.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>If you are implementing this yourself, make sure you sure you store <code>Stopwatch.Frequency</code> in the structure as well. This could change if you swap hardware, or change operating systems. If you persist instances of DateTimePrecision, you won't be able to read them back on a different machine without knowing how fast the ticks are coming in.</p>

<pre><code>class test
{
  public string Name;
  public string Location;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Through a result of query using entity framework I am getting back a collection of test objects which I am directly setting to my listbox. But using the DisplayMemberPath Iam just displaying Name value. So now the listbox is holding the whole collection of test objects but just displaying Name value.</p>

<p>When I am trying to bind to the selecteditem of the list box Iam getting the whole test object as a string but I just need Name value in the selecteditem result.</p>

<p>My XAML is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox x:Name=""lbSubSelector"" Height=""200"" DisplayMemberPath=""Name"" SelectedItem=""{Binding Name, Mode=TwoWay}"" /&gt;

<p>My code to populate list is as follows:</p>

<pre><code> LoadOperation&lt;test&gt; subLoadOp
                        = context.Load(context.GetTestQuery());
                    lbSubSelector.ItemsSource = subLoadOp.Entities;
                    lbSubDistrictSelector.DataContext = SkillModel.Instance;
</code></pre>

<p>The DataContext to which the selectedItem is set to is having a value of the whole string representation of test object but I want the selecteditem to just return Name value as it is displaying (as i have set the displaymemberpath to Name) instead of returned the whole object in string format.</p>

<li>How do you make this data structure properly if it is of variable depth and then access it properly?</li>

I have another View that uses one of the <code>child LookUps</code>, which should ignore the <code>Required</code>-attribute. I've already overridden the <code>IsValid</code> method in the ViewModel, so saving without caring about the <code>Required</code> works correctly, but unfortunately it's still showing the validation error on the view when I empty the <code>LookUp</code>:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qFaPd.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qFaPd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I had a couple of possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Split the <code>LookUpBaseViewModel</code> into two childs that are also ""BaseViewModels"", one with the <code>RequiredAttribute</code> and one without. This works, but it seems like a bit too much work and a lot of extra classes for just a single view that doesn't need to show the validation errors on the View.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the <code>RequiredAttribute</code> with a <code>RequiredIf-Attribute</code> and add a boolean <code>IsRequired</code> parameter to the Constructor. This doesn't work since we use <code>AutoFac</code> in our project, so we can't use a boolean parameter for the <code>ILookUpBaseViewModel</code>-interface implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a style to the <code>LookUp-ContentControl</code> in the View to hide the <code>ValidationError border &amp; text</code>. This seemed like the easiest solution on paper, and it also makes sense to just hide the unwanted <code>ValidationError border &amp; text</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, my question, how do I make the style to hide the default WPF validation error (so the red border and the text behind it)? I'm a novice when it comes to styles, but this is what I've tried (and which doesn't do anything it seems):</p>

        &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;

Feedback on both appreciated.</p>

<p>We have a front end that we add functional elements to through 'plugins'.
The plugin design is a javascript object with some data and some methods as below:</p>

<pre><code>function FeedbackPlugin(){
  return {
    name: ""Feedback"",
    help: ""Provide feedback on any element of the site"",
    ...    
    showForm : function(_feedbackType) {
      ...
    },
    ...
    messageCallbacks: [{callbackKey:""ProvideFeedback"",callbackHandler:showForm}]       
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>The framework loads each plugin and then iterates over the <strong>messageCallbacks</strong> to tie comet events to plugin methods.  </p>

<p>Sadly the code above does not work.  The plugin's <strong>showForm</strong> method is not in scope when the framework tries to register it.  I think we may need to pass a pointer to the <strong>showForm</strong> method of an existing plugin instance...  </p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any way in javascript to
somehow make this method static?</li>
<li>Should the method just live outside
the plugin for convenience sake?</li>

Or do you not install gems normally anymore and just include them in the Gemfile and then do a <code>bundle install</code> to include them all in a bundle that is then used with your application?</p>

Currently they all need their own Servlets, ServletMappings, Processors, Handlers etc. so implementing clients have to also keep an internal list of all the various URLs for the different services.</p>

<p>I understand that Apache Thrift supports multiplexing when using <code>TServer</code> and its derivatives by using <code>TMultiplexingProcessor</code>, however since I am using Spring and my Servlet, Handler and Processor are all Spring Beans that get autowired into one another, I'm unsure how to proceed.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how one of the services gets wired up:</p>

<p>UserServiceHandler.java</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public class UserServiceHandler implements UserService.Iface {
    @Override
    public User getUser(String userId) throws TException {
        // implementation logic goes here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>UserServiceProcessor.java</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public class UserServiceProcessor extends UserService.Processor&lt;UserServiceHandler&gt; {

    private UserServiceHandler handler;

    @Autowired
    public UserServiceProcessor(UserServiceHandler iface) {
        super(iface);
        handler = iface;
    }

    public UserServiceHandler getHandler() {
        return handler;
    }

    public void setHandler(UserServiceHandler handler) {
        this.handler = handler;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>UserServiceServlet.java</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public class UserServiceServlet extends TServlet {
    private UserServiceProcessor processor;

    @Autowired
    public UserServiceServlet(UserServiceProcessor p) {
        super(p, new TBinaryProtocol.Factory());
        processor = p;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Servlet Registration</p>

<pre><code>ServletRegistration.Dynamic userService = servletContext.addServlet(""UserServiceServlet"", (UserServiceServlet) ctx.getBean(""userServiceServlet""));
userService.setLoadOnStartup(1);
userService.addMapping(""/api/UserService/*"");
// This same block repeated 7 times for each *ServiceServlet with different mappings
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to have all 7 service handlers map to a single URL like <code>/api/*</code>. Is this even possible? I suppose I would have to create a single servlet and processor, but I'm unsure what they should look like. My processors extend <code>UserService.Processor</code> and the like.</p>

<p>and just calling connect function like this, $pdo = connect(); or any name for var but that is the way!</p>

<p>I don't understand the necessity of <code>BufferedInputStream</code> and <code>BufferedOutputStream</code>:</p>

<p>In the first method, I use a buffer of 1024 byte and first I fill it with <code>FileInputStream.read(byte[] b)</code> and then send it to socket with <code>DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b, int off, int len)</code>.</p>

<p>In the second method idem: first I fill the buffer with <code>DataInputStream.read(byte[] b)</code> and then write to the file with <code>FileOutputStream.write(byte[] b, int off, int len)</code>.</p>

<p>So why use <code>BufferedInputStream</code> and <code>BufferedOutputStream</code>?
In this way, if I understand how they work, I write bytes first in my buffer and then <code>BufferedInputStream</code> and <code>BufferedOutputStream</code> copy bytes in their buffer.</p>

<p>This type of projection works as follows: The panorama consists of 6 square images which are projected on the inner surface of a cube. The camera is positioned in the center of the cube.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm using 6 CALayers and arrange them in 3D space so that they form a cube. Rotating them works fine using CATransform3DMakeTranslation etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that CALayers are not transparent when seen from behind (they show the same image as the front side). This sucks, because the user can't see the projections inside the cube because the view is blocked by other layers of the cube.</p>

<p>Is there a solution for this problem? I could think of the following:
a.) Maybe there's a setting in Core Animation to make layers transparent when viewed from behind?
b.) Continuously track the current view direction and manually set the CALayers hidden which would block the view.</p>

<p>What would be the best solution to solve this?</p>

ClassExample classExample4 = ClassExample();
</code></pre>

<p>1 and 4 call the default constructors. When I use 2 and 3, I can't seem to refer to the variables and they are not initialised. In the debugger, they are stepped over. Why is this? Are these the same? What is the difference? Is there a preferred option? </p>

<p>When we have parameters to pass there are two ways of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>ClassExample classExample1(true, 1, """");
ClassExample classExample2 = ClassExample(true, 1, """");
</code></pre>

<p>Again, is there a difference? what is the preferred option?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>C++ 11 also introduced this form of initialization:</p>

<pre><code>ClassExample classExample2{ };
</code></pre>

<p>which is the equivelant of:</p>

<pre><code>ClassExample classExample2();

Currently, I'm using a combination of <code>gBrowser.contentDocument.getElementsByClassName(""class"")</code> and attaching a <code>DOMSubteeeModified</code> event to it. But I notice that it works only when the tab is active. When I'm away using another tab, and the DOM changes in the inactive tab, it does not work. How do I get around this? The Firefox MDN is pretty scattered (and sometimes outdated), it is very frustrating for a newbie.</p>

   }
};

MyExtension.XXX = {
    handler : function(e) {
        //get dom element with gBrowser.contentDocument.getElementsByClassName(""class"");
        //bind DOMSubtreeModified listener, attach a function to handle the event

I have a default custom style for the <code>DataGridRow</code> class which works well.  However, for this one particular <code>DataGrid</code> on this one particular screen, I need a different custom style.</p>

<p>The Items in each row have a <code>bool</code> property that, when set, I want to display that row with a different foreground and background color.  However, when the row is selected AND when that property is set, I want a different foreground and background color to show that it's selected AND the property is set to true.</p>

<p>Here's what I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style TargetType=""DataGridRow"" x:Key=""CameraStyle""&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""Foreground"" Value=""{DynamicResource TextForeground}"" /&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""Background"" Value=""{DynamicResource DataBackground}"" /&gt;

                &lt;Condition Property=""IsSelected"" Value=""True"" /&gt;

        &lt;/MultiDataTrigger&gt;
    &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me a ""Binding must be non-null"" error, which I think is happening because there is no <code>Binding</code> property on the first condition in the MultiDataTrigger.</p>

<p>What is the correct way to write this in XAML?</p>

<p>What I want though is something more. I was wondering if there is a way to define ""derived properties"" in the model type. More specifically I want numberOfThings to always compute to the length of the array myListOfThings.
That is I want the ability create the object like:</p>

<pre><code>var o = new MyDataModel({ name: ""a name"", myListOfThings: ['a','b','c']});
</code></pre>

<p>And then having a kendo widget with a column bound to numberOfThings displaying 3.
Do you know how to accomplish this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Thanks Atanas, your answer works.</p>

<p>I was able to edit the jsbin code to a declarative binding form that works for me.</p>

<p>I'm not quite there yet thought since in my solution code I am getting a javscript error at line 269 in kendo.all.js that reads</p>

<pre><code>return new Function(argumentName, functionBody);
</code></pre>

<p>The error message is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""ReferenceError: count is not defined""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm trying to find where my code differs from the jsbin code. .. but if you have an idea of what might be the problem I am all ears. If not, no worries, thanks for the answer.</p>

With all the different expressions I have tried, I haven't had any luck.</p>

<p>To find the Total Sales I multiply the Weight times the Unit Cost .
Example: 
<code>[IC_ProductLots].[OriginalQuantity_Stk] *[ICP].[UnitCost]</code></p>

<pre><code>Total Weight = 1,000
Unit Cost = 3
Total Sales = 3,000
</code></pre>

<p>I need to find out how to store the Total Sales as a variable and then be able to use it later as an expression such as:</p>

<pre><code> Max(@TotalSalesVariable - (@PurchaseCost + @Prod_CostLBS) * @InputWeight) AS [Profit]
</code></pre>

<p>Currently I am using the expression:</p>

<pre><code>AVG([ICP].[UnitCost]) OVER (PARTITION BY [ARC].[CustomerCode])
* SUM(Sum([IC_ProductLots].[OriginalQuantity_Stk])) 
OVER (PARTITION BY [ARC].[CustomerCode])
-  ( @PurchaseCost + @Prod_CostLBS ) * @InputWeight 
</code></pre>

<p>But that does not work because the <code>AVG</code> unit cost does not produce the correct number. So I am beginning to think I can only calculate the Profit if I use a variable to store the Total Sales amount.</p>

<p><strong>Catch, the variable cannot include a <code>WHERE</code> statement because the <code>WHERE</code> is determined by user input at the time of running the report.</strong></p>

<p>I am using Microsoft SQL Sever 2005</p>

I have figured out one of my fragments and gotten it working but when I copied the other fragments to follow the same code structure (with specialized functionality), I get a null pointer exception in the onCreateView method.</p>

<p>I'm on my junk laptop right now and it can't seem to handle android emulation so I can post the exact error code tomorrow. I have my source code though and I have been hitting my head against the wall long enough to know where it is breaking.</p>

<p>EDIT: I see my problem. I'm testing the my code by calling a method from within the View.java class from each fragment. This method updates a table in the view. Since the views haven't been displayed on screen yet, onCreateView() hasn't been called for them. Since onCreateView() hasn't been called, trying to access the view results in a null pointer. Is there any good way to call onCreateView() for each fragment from my MainActivity just so I can initialize the views early?</p>

<p>(Part of the working fragment):</p>

<pre><code>    public class DispatchView extends Fragment {
private final List&lt;DispatchModel&gt; models = new ArrayList&lt;DispatchModel&gt;();

@Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
        Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.dispatchfragment, container,
            false);
    return view;
}
</code></pre>

<p>All fragments, except for DispatchView, break upon returning view. They are returning null rather than an actual object.
Part of one of the broken fragments:</p>

<pre><code>    public class ConnectionsLogView extends Fragment {
private final List&lt;ConnectionsLogModel&gt; models = new ArrayList&lt;ConnectionsLogModel&gt;();

@Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
        Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.connectionslogfragment,
            container, false);
    return view;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The fragments are declared and initialized. They (any of them except the Dispatch MVC) break after I try to push a new data entry (class) into them.
In my MainActivity.java:</p>

<pre><code>    public class MainActivity extends Activity {
// Declare Tab Variables and fragment objects

Fragment                 activeConnectionsTab = new ConnectionsView();

DispatchModel            dispatchModel;
DispatchController       dispatchController;
DispatchLogModel         dispatchLogModel;
DispatchLogController    dispatchLogController;
ConnectionsModel         connectionsModel;
ConnectionsController    connectionsController;
ConnectionsLogModel      connectionsLogModel;
ConnectionsLogController connectionsLogController;

    super();
}

@Override

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    app = (mDMI) getApplication();
    dispatchModel = app.getDispatchModel();
    dispatchController = new DispatchController(dispatchTab, dispatchModel);
    dispatchLogModel = app.getDispatchLogModel();
    dispatchLogController = new DispatchLogController(dispatchLogTab,
            dispatchLogModel);
    connectionsModel = app.getConnectionsModel();
    connectionsController = new ConnectionsController(activeConnectionsTab,
            connectionsModel);
    connectionsLogModel = app.getConnLogModel();
    connectionsLogController = new ConnectionsLogController(
            connectionLogTab, connectionsLogModel);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

In this case I use an ArrayList as the shared inventory. In my program the threads are representations of jobs that a creature has. Creatures belong to a party and share a pool of Artifacts used to perform jobs. only one creature my interact with the pool at any time.</p>

<p>For some reason I keep having issues with thread communication. I have set it up so if the pool is not being used the creature drops all its items into the pool and begins to look through it. And if they cannot find everything they need they <strong>should</strong> drop all the artifacts they have into the pool, Set the pool to  to not busy, then signal <strong>one</strong> creature waiting on the pool that it is ready for them to go through it as well.</p>

<p>My issue is that if a creature is looking through the pool while another is waiting, and it cannot find what it like it repeats the process without notifying or letting the other creature go through it.</p>

<p><strong>What I've attempted:</strong> I initially attempted using locks but the locks would not signal other threads. Then I rewrote it taking advantage of synchronized ( Party ). Then I thought it was because the threads were crashing somewhere but a thread can run all the way through and even dump its items back into the pool when the job is complete (given a creature has not locked the pool into limbo).</p>

<pre><code>boolean ready = target.hasReqArtifacts( reqStones, reqPotions, reqWands, reqWeapons );

                target.poolParty.notifyAll();//notify all threads that they need to wait because this one will proceed
            }
        }

<p>I perform this kind of interaction between threads in a scenario where a creature has more than one job but can only do one job at a time and it works perfectly. I tailored those methods to match this situation and I am still having issues.</p>

<p>I have a TCP socket server and client and am doing some testing on the local network. With sysinternals TCPView, I can see that packets are sent from the TCP client and arrive at the TCP Server (I see the packet counters increase).</p>

<p>However, it appears as if the data is not making it to the application stack? 
The very same build runs without issues on Windows 7.</p>

<p>I have the Windows 8 firewall turned off and run both process with elevated permissions on a domain admin users with UAC turned off.</p>

<p>When I connect the client to a an outside server (running on a separate machine), everything works fine.
Is there anything else in Windows 8 that could prohibit TCP data communication between local processes?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>To make sure nothing in my server application is causing this issue, I built a quick TCP server in a console application, with the following code for the socket constructor:</p>

<pre><code>listenerSocket = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
</code></pre>

<p>and listen on the same local IP/Port as my server application.
I'm experiencing the same issue, I can telnet to the port but listenerSocket.AcceptAsync is never hit.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>Upon further testing, it appers my issue has something to do with the use of the Async socket calls, i.e. if I use the synchronous calls like socket.Accept(), the test application is performing normally. However, when I use Async socket calls, i.e. socket.AcceptAsync(), I'm experiencing the issues mentioned. So far I couldn't find any mention of differences between win7 &amp; 8 in regards to async socket calls.</p>

<p>Here's my quick sample app that shows that the async callback is never triggered. This snippet works fine in Windows 7 but does not work in Windows 8 (try to telnet to 127.0.0.1 : 7000).</p>

<pre><code>    class Program
{
    private static SocketAsyncEventArgs socketAsyncEventArgs = new SocketAsyncEventArgs();

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var listenerSocket = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
        listenerSocket.Bind(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(""127.0.0.1""), 7000));
        listenerSocket.Listen(100);

        socketAsyncEventArgs.Completed += AcceptEventArg_Completed;
        listenerSocket.AcceptAsync(socketAsyncEventArgs);

        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    private static void AcceptEventArg_Completed(object sender, SocketAsyncEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""AcceptEventArg_Completed"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>I found 2 others reporting the same issue on Microsoft Connect:
<a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/759913/socketasynceventargs-completed-doesnt-fire-in-net-framework-4-5"">https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/759913/socketasynceventargs-completed-doesnt-fire-in-net-framework-4-5</a>

<p>Whereas the 2nd one is interesting as it seems to conclude there is a Windows bug in the Console.ReadLine() call and it is causing the issue and blocking the async callback. If I replace Console.ReadLine() in my snippet with:</p>

<pre><code>            while (true)
        {
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);
        }

<p>The issue I'm blaming about and the one I'm banging my head against the wall is in iOS 7, when you have a <code>UITableViewCell</code> with semi-transparent background and you try to delete/insert/moving rows (so relying on an animation effect) the entire <code>UITableView</code> with its cells <strong><em>flashing</em></strong> for just 0.1 second and set cells background to a more transparent one. This is very annoying.</p>

<p>The only thing I'm doing is set the background color of <code>self.view</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.4 green:0.5 blue:0.7 alpha:1];
</code></pre>

<p>and set the background color of cells with:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willDisplayCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    cell.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithWhite:1 alpha:0.5];
}

The class is basically creating a button that uses frame labels in the MovieClip to move between button states as mouse events are dispatched.  Each state (each approx 20 frames long) is terminated with a timeline <code>stop()</code>. </p>

<p>This class has been used in numerous other projects, but after a certain point in my current application any buttons created as an extension of my button class stop executing the code on the timeline, and just play on a loop.  This includes any traces put into the timeline, but all code in the class still executes correctly, even the gotoAndPlay calls when the button state changes.</p>

<p>The strangest part is that no error is thrown by any of the misbehaving button instances on the stage.  </p>

<p>What I need are suggestions of what could prevent any object that extends a certain class from executing timeline code without throwing an error.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This still has me stumped.  Our projects usually come in three parts: a lightweight preloader, a language and age gate, then the main application.  Each is loaded into the previous, each time using the current application domain.  After the main application has been loaded, any custom display object that extends MovieClip (directly or indirectly) will ignore any actionscript directly on its timeline.  The playhead can still be controlled though the class however.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong>  This is the code in the test button class that I have made.  Notice how there is nothing in it.  </p>

<pre><code>package com.test
{
    import flash.display.MovieClip;

    public class TestLabelButton extends MovieClip
    {
        public function TestLabelButton():void
        {

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong>  So I've narrowed it down, but it's strange.  It seems that I can load my language gate into the preloader just fine, with the language gate being an swf with a custom document class that extends MovieClip. After that though, if I load any more SWFs that contain a custom doc class extending MovieClip it's like all subsequently instantiated MovieClips of extentions thereof loose all the code on their timelines.</p>

When the user click the submit button, I would like to validate the user input. Because this form (suppose it's alike a resume) could contains a few similar field, such as year, school, diploma, etc. So I use JQuery <strong>attribute selector</strong> to choose these similar fields and use JQuery <strong>each</strong> function to iterate them for validation. My code is like below. </p>

<pre><code>$(""#submit_btn"").click(function () {
            $('input[name=""education_year[]""]').each(function(){
                if (!$(this).val()) {

<p>because the user may leave several fields empty, so i want my code gives out only one alert. However, in the code above, the <strong>return</strong> keyword doesn't help. It seems to me that it is more like a <strong>break</strong> statement to exit the <strong>each</strong> function. Can anyone tell me how to end the <strong>click</strong> function ? </p>

<p>I think i'm missing some basic but fundemental understanding of ActionScript 3 and I have no other knowledge of other scripting/programming languages either.
when I follow tutorials exactly they seem simple enough, but then start applying what I think is logical usage then it throws up errors..
any recommendations of books for a simple understanding, i.e technical but in normal language of AS3, since I have Foundation AS3.0 Animation, Making Things Move (great book, keeps to concepts; wish there was a book like this about AS3 itself) and The Essential Guide to Flash Games (very technical, can barely follow as-is)??</p>

<p>I hope thats not the case as it is very convenient for my unit tests to declare arrays on the stack as in the example, but I need to test functions that are expecting pointers to pointers to int.</p>

<p>Note I do get a compiler warning as follows:</p>

<p>Now, I suspect that a query on the SQL Server view to find <code>MAX</code> value on a column is sometimes returning wrong value. In any case, is it possible that the <code>MAX</code> query ran on the view even in case it wasn't able to fetch all the records from the Hive table, due to which the query returned wrong values?</p>

<p>But code is not working for some reason! Looks like after generating few lists the code execution does not stop and browser hangs. Have I used the function in a wrong way: '<code>query_posts('cat=14&amp;posts_per_page=4&amp;offset='.$pStart)</code>' ? 
How should I actually implement it?</p>

<p>How can I make solr execute a sorted query without incurring the speed punishments</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>Here's the definition of the alphaOnlySort field</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;!-- This is an example of using the KeywordTokenizer along
         With various TokenFilterFactories to produce a sortable field
         that does not include some properties of the source text
      --&gt;
    &lt;fieldType name=""alphaOnlySort"" class=""solr.TextField"" sortMissingLast=""true"" omitNorms=""true""&gt;
      &lt;analyzer&gt;
        &lt;!-- KeywordTokenizer does no actual tokenizing, so the entire
             input string is preserved as a single token
          --&gt;
        &lt;tokenizer class=""solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory""/&gt;
        &lt;!-- The LowerCase TokenFilter does what you expect, which can be
             when you want your sorting to be case insensitive
          --&gt;
        &lt;filter class=""solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory"" /&gt;
        &lt;!-- The TrimFilter removes any leading or trailing whitespace --&gt;
        &lt;filter class=""solr.TrimFilterFactory"" /&gt;
        &lt;!-- The PatternReplaceFilter gives you the flexibility to use
             Java Regular expression to replace any sequence of characters
             matching a pattern with an arbitrary replacement string,
             which may include back references to portions of the original
             string matched by the pattern.

             See the Java Regular Expression documentation for more
             information on pattern and replacement string syntax.

<p>The game among other objects has Users and NPC's (non-playing characters).</p>

<p>Users and NPC's have somewhat different capabilities, but they also have some common properties, like amount of health or damage.</p>

<p>The activities are done via methods like <code>void AttackUser(User attacker, User target)</code>.</p>

<p>The problem here is that NPC's can also attack Users and other NPC's, and Users can attack NPC's, so I will have to write quite a few additional methods and overloads (e.g. <code>void AttackNpc(User attacker, Npc npc)</code>.</p>

<p>I can simplify all this by using the inheritance feature of Linq2SQL, with 1 universal table Creatures instead of Users and NPC's separately. This will also allow me to have one universal method, <code>void Attack (Creature attacker, Creature target)</code> instead of multiple versions. </p>

<p>On the other hand, inheritance in Linq2SQL seems to greatly increase overall complexity of the solution. Each time I decide to make changes to Users or NPC's, I will need to consider the inheritance issues. Also, with inheritance in Linq2SQL I don't have that clarity of separate tables for Users and NPC's because everything is being dumped into one table. And finally, I'm concerned regarding performance of such combined Creatures table.</p>

<p>It becomes difficult to decide whether I should or shouldn't use inheritance here, because if I choose a suboptimal approach, it's going to be very difficult to switch to another approach in the future.</p>

<p>I'd like to hear expert opinions on this.</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<pre><code>std::mutex m_mutex;
std::condition_variable m_cv;

T1: 
  std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(m_mutex);
  m_cv.wait(lock, []{ return !is_empty(); });

T2:
  generate_data();
  m_cv.notify();
</code></pre>

<p>Is it guaranteed that T1 will never end up in a situation where we check is_empty() first (it returning true), then getting preempted by T2 which creates some data and signals the condition variable before we can actually wait on it?</p>

<p>If this is guaranteed to work (I'd guess so, otherwise it would seem like an intentionally bad API design), how is this actually implemented for say linux and <code>stdlibc++</code>? Seems we'd need another lock to avoid this situation.</p>

<p>I forgot I should create <code>meeting</code> table first before I create <code>place</code> table, so what I do I run <code>yii migrate/down all</code> to rollback the migration first, I rename the file to reorder it like so:</p>

<pre><code>m150311_012030_create_meeting_table.php
m150311_012031_create_place_table.php

<p>For the benefit of Spring, the following needed to be in the App.config file. Clearly this only serves the first spring test, and not the second. Can you put multiple spring configurations in the config file? If so, what is the syntax and how do you access them? Or is there another way to do this?</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;configSections&gt;

<p>This raises a few questions to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I want to integrate this technique into existing code that uses the usual container.  Why do I have to use a different container type, <code>GenericApplicationContext</code> in this case? What if I want to read data into this object from the existing spring config in app.config or web.config? Would it work as the usual context? Could I then write data over these registrations with code? </p></li>
<li><p>How can I specify that <code>ISomeService</code> is to be created as a singleton? I don't mean supply a singleton instance to the container, but the container to create the instance, resolving its constructor, and use it when that type is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>how can I do the equivalent of <code>container.RegisterType&lt;ISomeService, ServiceImplementationA&gt;();</code> ? I want to register type mappings to use in all cases where that type is needed by a constructor.</p></li>
<li><p>What exactly does <code>container.RegisterType&lt;ServiceImplementationA&gt;(""service"");</code> do? It seems to register <code>ServiceImplementationA</code> as the implementation of <code>ISomeService</code> but <code>ISomeService</code>is never mentioned, so there could be ambiguity. e.g. what if <code>ServiceImplementationA</code> implemented more than one interface.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the string name given to the registration for? It won't work with en empty string, but it doesn't seem to matter what it is.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Am I trying to use spring in a way that it just does not work? I'm trying to use it like other IoC containers, but it's not quite working.</p>

How does the browser take the rules in this stylesheet and apply it to the HTML? I'm not asking about how to make it faster, I want to know how the rendering itself is handled.</p>

<p>Does it apply each rule one-by-one as it parses the stylesheet and render the result progressively? Or, are the CSS file's contents completely downloaded, then fully evaluated, and <em>then</em> applied to the HTML all at once? Or something else?</p>

<p>I ask this after posting an answer earlier on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6944190/does-the-order-of-rules-in-a-css-stylesheet-affect-rendering-speed/6945000"">a question about CSS rule order affecting rendering speed</a>, with the assumption that the styles were rendered <em>as</em> the stylesheet loaded, so the first rules would be applied before the last ones, and not all at once. I'm not sure where I picked up the idea, it's just something I have always thought.</p>

<p>I tried a demo on my server that looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""test.css"" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>test.css</code> contents:</p>

<pre><code>html { background:green }
/* thousands of lines of irrelevant CSS to make the download slow */
html { background:red }
</code></pre>

<p>Testing in Firefox 5, I expected to see green at first, then turn to red. It didn't happen. I tried with two separate stylesheets with conflicting rules and got the same results. After many combinations, the only way I got it to work was an inline <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, with the conflicting rules coming from a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> (the body itself was completely empty except for the link tag). Even using an inline <code>style</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, and then loading this stylesheet did not create the flicker that I expected.</p>

<p>Are repaints affected in <em>any</em> way by the CSS, or is the final output applied all at once after the entire stylesheet is downloaded and it's rules computed to what the final output should be? Do CSS files download in paralel with the HTML itself or block it (like script tags do)? How does this actually work? </p>

<p>I am not looking for optimization tips, I'm looking for authoritative references on the subject, so that I can cite them in the future. It's been very difficult to search for this information without turning up tons of unrelated material. Summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is all CSS content downloaded before <em>any</em> of it is applied? (reference please)</li>
<li>How is this affected by things like <code>@import</code>, multiple <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>s, inline style attributes, <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> blocks in the head, and different rendering engines?</li>
<li>Does the download of CSS content block the downloading of the the HTML document itself?</li>

<p>So I have a script...</p>

<pre><code>@XmlRootElement(name = ""script"")
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
public class Script {...
</code></pre>

<p>which has fields...</p>

<pre><code>@XmlElementWrapper(name = ""fields"", required = true)
@XmlElementRef(type = Field.class)
private List&lt;Field&gt; fields;
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Which is all very nice and lovely.  Now, writing the XML configuration files by hand is tedious and error-prone, so I'm thinking about writing some kind of GUI to do it.  This GUI would need to know the permitted structure so it can offer the right types of objects within the right types of objects.  All of that information is embedded within these configuration objects, and it would be wrong to have to duplicate all of this information for the GUI to know what to do.</p>

<p>So, extracting the information from the annotations seems like the Right thing to do.  Anyone know where to begin with something like that?  Ideally, given it includes things like <code>@XmlSeeAlso({...})</code> then it would be nice to be able to ask <code>javax.xml</code> for the information, because it might understand all its own annotations already, otherwise I'll have to encode an understanding of those in my own code.  I have no idea how feasible that is or how much I'll have to do myself.</p>

<p>Very happy to examine alternative approaches too, if anyone has any experience of something like this.</p>

<p>My initial idea has been to combined the 2 result sets and produce a list of </p>

<p>I would then select 25 items from each query, giving preference to those in a segments with the most NumberOfItemsRequiredInSegment. <br><br>I know this would not be optimal but would be an easy to implement heuristic.</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""fred"": {
        ""id"": 4249458,
        ""name"": ""fred"",
    },
    ""george"": {
        ""id"": 3279659,
        ""name"": ""george"",
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is then successfully loaded into a string.</p>

<p>The issue is the field names ""fred"" and ""george"" are dynamic and there can be any number of them. DataContractJsonSerializer appears to be unable to manage this as it requires field names to be hard-coded in the data contracts.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28279160/deserialization-of-json-object-with-sub-field-as-string-using-datacontractjsonse"">this thread</a> describes the same problem. The answer there recommends using a JavaScriptSerializer, and using the <code>dynamic</code> type to represent the ""Children"" property containing all the dynamically-named fields. The equivalent of ""Children"" in the JSON I am working with is in fact the top-level object, so I figured I could just load the whole JSON string into a dynamic variable (using kevin's <code>FromJavaScriptSerializer</code> function defined in the other thread):</p>

<pre><code>public static T FromJavaScriptSerializer&lt;T&gt;(string json)
{
    var serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer();
    return serializer.Deserialize&lt;T&gt;(json);
}


public static string ToStringOutput(object dynamicField)
{
    var serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer();
    return serializer.Serialize(dynamicField);
}

dynamic varPlayer = FromJavaScriptSerializer&lt;PlayerList&gt;(jsonString);
</code></pre>

<p>Instead this returns an empty object (when printed using <code>ToStringOutput</code> it is simply ""{}"").</p>

<p>How do I approach this problem?</p>

<p>This time however, I've been unable to find a solution to my problem...</p>

<p>I'm currently developing an android app that uses two activities (one main activity and a search activity). 
  Both of which hold a listview - the main activity has an already populated and fully functional listview and, the search activity has a populated one which seems to lack functionallity.</p>

<p>The listview is created in a custom adapter and contains an image button (toggling with a selector) and four textviews.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I toggle the image button in my search activity and then press back to get back to the main activity and finally go back to the search results, the image button is ""unchecked"". 
  Since the image button is a CRUCIAL point in both the design and the following functionallity, I'd really appriciate any kind of help.</p>

<li>In form of VS build tasks (to perform processing while building)</li>
</ul>

<p>Say I have a table of companies:</p>

<pre><code> id | company_name
----+--------------
  1 | Someone
  2 | Someone else
</code></pre>

<p>...and a table of contacts:</p>

<pre><code> id | company_id | contact_name | is_primary
----+------------+--------------+------------
  1 |     1      | Tom          |      1
  2 |     2      | Dick         |      1
  3 |     1      | Harry        |      0
  4 |     1      | Bob          |      0
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to set up the <code>contacts</code> table in such a way that it <em>requires</em> that one and only one record has the <code>is_primary</code> flag set for each common <code>company_id</code>?</p>

<p>So if I tried to do:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE contacts
SET is_primary = 1
WHERE id = 4
</code></pre>

<p>...the query would fail, because <code>Tom</code> (<code>id = 1</code>) is already flagged as the primary contact for <code>company_id = 1</code>. Or even better, would it be possible to construct a trigger so that the query would succeed, but <code>Tom</code>'s <code>is_primary</code> flag would be cleared by the same operation?</p>

<p>I am not too bothered about checking whether <code>company_id</code> exists in the <code>companies</code> table, my PHP code would already have performed this check before I got to this stage (although if there is a way to do this in the same operation it would be nice, I suppose).</p>

<p>When I initially thought about this I thought ""that will be easy, I'll just add a unique index across the <code>company_id</code> and <code>is_primary</code> columns"" but obviously that won't work as it would restrict me to one primary and one non-primary contact - any attempt to add a third contact would fail. But I can't help feeling there would be a way to configure a unique index that gives me the minimum functionality I require - to reject an attempt to add a second primary contact, or reject an attempt to leave a company with no primary contact.</p>

<p>I am aware that I could just add a <code>primary_contact</code> field to the <code>companies</code> table with an FK to the <code>contacts</code> table but it feels messy. I don't like the idea of both tables having an FK to the other - it seems to me that the one table should rely on the other, not both tables relying on each other. I guess I just think that over time there is more chance of something going wrong.</p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I restrict the contacts table so that one and only one record with a given <code>company_id</code> has the <code>is_primary</code> flag set?</li>
<li>Anyone have any thoughts on whether two tables having FKs to each other is a good/bad idea?</li>

<p>I've seen many methods that involve adding an event listener that stops the passed event (<code>event.stop()</code> or <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> or <code>return false</code>), or prevents its default behaviour (<code>event.preventDefault()</code>). This then requires that the behaviour be somehow re-written, instead of just passing/activating/releasing the original event.</p>

<p>For example, with mootools, I could use the following event handler on <code>&lt;a id=""special-a-element""&gt;</code> to push and process a GA event before redirecting to the target document:</p>

<pre><code>$('special-a-element').addEvent('click', function() {
    var url = this.get('href');
    _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'category', 'action']);
    _gaq.push(function() { document.location = url; });
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the <code>document.location</code> recreates what the browser might do if it were allowed to deal with the <code>click</code> event I've stopped (with <code>return false</code>); this seems unnecessary. What if <code>special-a-element</code> had <code>target = ""_blank""</code>? The listener would not open the link in a new window, but in the current one (because of <code>document.location</code>).</p>

<p>So I would like to <strong>allow the default behaviour without stopping it then re-implementing it</strong>. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>The second dataset <code>b</code> is the actual test results dataset that stores the results of what was actually observed. The observed value for a specific test in <code>b</code> is compared to the minimum and maximum values in dataset <code>a</code>. If the observed value in <code>b</code> is greater than the actual min and max in <code>a</code> then results column should be updated as <code>high</code> , else <code>Normal</code>.

<p>Getting around to using sass in my latest rails project, specifically the bootstrap-sass gem to get all of twitter bootstrappy goodness.</p>

<p>Is it possible to reference the variables already defined?  The vendor / assets / stylesheets / bootstrap / _variables.scss file contains declarations for colors.</p>

<pre><code>$blue: #049cdb !default;
$blueDark: #0064cd !default;
$green: #46a546 !default;
$red: #9d261d !default;
</code></pre>

<p>Do I need to redefine these in the top of my base application.css.scss file or can I import/reference the variables file?  I've tried a couple of approaches like this:</p>

<pre><code>$bodyBackground: $black;
@import 'bootstrap'
</code></pre>

<p>But that errors out with undefined variable $black.</p>

Once I run one of these apps, my engine will bog right down to 30 or less fps. I'm throttling the FPS at 60 but it's capable of running over 4000, so being bogged down to 30 tells me I've either got a bug in my display driver, or there's some magical call in openGL I'm not including in my draw loop or something.. I don't know.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> : Usually a restart will flush out the problem and everything is back to normal, until basically I use another program which doesn't work with with straight GL or WDF.</p>

<p>The point of my question, is anyone aware of a <strong><em>known</em></strong> issue as I've described above, while developing with openGL in C++? Is it perhaps an issue in my render code?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> : One of the primary reasons why I suspect it's my code over the display driver is that I have games written in C/C++ that use GL (like quake 3) which are unaffected by this issue.</p>

<p>Here's my draw-related code:</p>

<pre><code>***Init Code***

glDisable( GL_DITHER );
glDisable(GL_ALPHA_TEST);

glDisable( GL_LIGHTING );
glShadeModel(GL_SMOOTH);

glHint(GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT, GL_FASTEST);
glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);

glEnable(GL_BLEND);
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
</code></pre>

<p><br><br></p>

<pre><code>***Draw Loop***
glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT | GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT | GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT);

glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glLoadIdentity();

if(stage != NULL){
    stage-&gt;render();
}

//Yes I know, singletons are disgusting. I'm removing them eventually.
Ascengine::VBOManager::getInstance().bindVBO(0); 
Ascengine::GLTextureManager::getInstance().bindTexture(0);

glfwSwapBuffers();
</code></pre>

<p>Note that nothing special happens within <code>stage-&gt;render();</code> it's just a display list so it just steps down through children and calls translate,scale etc and draws out the texture and vertex coordinates from VBO(s).</p>

<p>I use Attributes to decorate my classes and everything works fine.
One thing I couldn't solve yet. I need to generate a tag <code>Positions</code> with different tag <code>TextPosition, ItemPosition, ValuePosition, ...</code> inside.</p>

<p>How do I achive this in c#?</p>

<p>Currently my class Order contains a</p>

<pre><code>[XmlElement(""Positions"")]
public PositionList Positions { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>PositionList is a class with</p>

<pre><code>public class PositionList
{
    [XmlElement(""Positions"")]
    public List&lt;Object&gt; Positions { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In order to avoid a InvalidOperationException I added</p>

<pre><code>[XmlInclude(typeof(Textposition))]
[XmlInclude(typeof(ItemPosition))]
[XmlInclude(typeof(SumPosition))]
</code></pre>

<p>to my Order class.</p>

<p>However, instead of generating</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Positions&gt;
    &lt;TextPosition&gt;...&lt;/TextPosition&gt;
&lt;/Positions&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the serializer generates:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Position d4p1:type=""TextPosition"" xmlns:d4p1=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""&gt;...&lt;/Position&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, In don't need to deserialize it my self but provide a XML-file in a very strict format for one customer. Is there a way to achive this?</p>

I updated the code here. Not sure what changed.</p>

<p>Maybe some images will help.
First image has pixel size of one, second pixel size of 2. Note that the image doubles and only fills half the canvas.</p>

<p>It's powered by two tables:</p>

<p><strong>stream</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>id</code> - Unique Stream Item ID</li>
<li><code>user_id</code> - ID of the user who created the stream item</li>
<li><code>object_type</code> - Type of object (currently 'seller' or 'product')</li>
<li><code>object_id</code> - Internal ID of the object (currently either the seller ID or the product ID)</li>
<li><code>action_name</code> - The action taken against the object (currently either 'buy' or 'heart')</li>
<li><code>stream_date</code> - Timestamp that the action was created.</li>
<li><code>hidden</code> - Boolean of if the user has chosen to hide the item.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>follows</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>id</code> - Unique Follow ID</li>
<li><code>user_id</code> - The ID of the user initiating the 'Follow' action.</li>
<li><code>following_user</code> - The ID of the user being followed.</li>
<li><code>followed</code> - Timestamp that the follow action was executed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently I'm using the following query to pull content from the database:</p>

<p><strong>Query:</strong></p>

<pre><code>SELECT stream.*,
   COUNT(stream.id) AS rows_in_group,
   GROUP_CONCAT(stream.id) AS in_collection
FROM stream
INNER JOIN follows ON stream.user_id = follows.following_user
WHERE follows.user_id = '1'
  AND stream.hidden = '0'
GROUP BY stream.user_id,
     stream.action_name,
     stream.object_type,
     date(stream.stream_date)
ORDER BY stream.stream_date DESC;
</code></pre>

<p>This query actually works pretty well, and using a little PHP to parse the data that MySQL returns we can create a nice activity stream with actions of the same type by the same user being grouped together if the time between the actions isn't too great (see below example).</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RcFlZ.png"" alt=""Current Stream Output Example""></p>

<p>My question is, how do I make this smarter? Currently it groups by one axis, ""user"" activity, when there are multiple items by a particular user within a certain timeframe the MySQL knows to group them.</p>

<p>How can I make this even smarter and group by another axis, such as ""object_id"" so if there are multiple actions for the same object in sequence these items are grouped, but maintain the grouping logic we currently have for grouping actions/objects by user. And implementing this without data duplication?</p>

<p>Example of multiple objects appearing in sequence:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ERG3P.png"" alt=""Multiple Objects Appearing in Sequence""></p>

<p>I understand solutions to problems like this can get very complex, very quickly but I'm wondering if there's an elegant, and fairly simple solution to this (hopefully) in MySQL.</p>

The approach should automatically acquire the states of specific objects during a dynamic analysis of the application under test (AUT). After the data has been recorded I want to write the test. Here, the test should reconstruct the objects with the recorded test data as a setup before executing the method/code under test.</p>

<p>With object states I mean all member variable values of an object including
    references to other objects (for which I also need to acquire and
    reconstruct the whole object state). However, since ALL member values include those of private member variables, I ran into a problem. From what I have learned, there is no way to access private member variables in C++. That is, unless the object type in question is a friend with any of ""my object types"" or provides direct access functions to its private members.</p>

<p>Actually, I can solve this problem for types which have been declared in the source code of the AUT. Here, I can use LLVM to instrument the types with the necessary code during compilation. However, I cannot do this for referenced types from precompiled libraries which the AUT uses. </p>

<p>Hence, my question: Have you any idea how I can record and reconstruct the full states of arbritrary objects for which I do not have the source code? Could direct copying of memory help?</p>

<p>Since my approach is actually basic (automatic) unit test generation, I'm sure there has to be way to implement this in C++. After all, such kinds of generators have already been implemented in Java and C#.</p>

<p>Usually when using <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html"">Tkinter</a>, you call <a href=""http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/MainLoop.htm"">Tk.mainloop</a> to run the event loop and ensure that events are properly processed and windows remain interactive without blocking.</p>

<p>When using Tkinter from within an interactive shell, running the main loop does not seem necessary. Take this example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import tkinter
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = tkinter.Tk()
</code></pre>

<p>A window will appear, and it will not block: You can interact with it, drag it around, and close it.</p>

<p>So, something in the interactive shell does seem to recognize that a window was created and runs the event loop in the background.</p>

<p>Now for the interesting thing. Take the example from above again, but then in the next prompt (without closing the window), enter anything—without actually executing it (i.e. don’t press enter). For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = tkinter.Tk()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('Not pressing enter now.') # not executing this
</code></pre>

<p>If you now try to interact with the Tk window, you will see that it completely <em>blocks</em>. So the event loop which we thought would be running in the background stopped while we were entering a command to the interactive shell. If we send the entered command, you will see that the event loop <em>continues</em> and whatever we did during the blocking will continue to process.</p>

<p>So the big question is: <strong>What is this magic that happens in the interactive shell?</strong> What runs the main loop when we are not doing it explicitly? And why does it need to halt when we <em>enter</em> commands (instead of halting when we execute them)?</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The above works like this in the command line interpreter, not IDLE. As for IDLE, I assume that the GUI won’t actually tell the underlying interpreter that something has been entered but just keep the input locally around until it’s being executed.</p>

I am very new to python and also the GAE so I am a bit igorant to this.  I am looking in the documentation but cannot find quite what I am looking for.  Basically I have made the following class method</p>

<pre><code>Event.getEventsForMonth(cls, month,year):

<p>So I am trying to query my object where the month and year of the date field fall in a specified range.  I have tried to create a date object and use that for the comparison but I have had no joy so far.</p>

<pre><code>dateto = str(year)+str(month+1)+""01""
datefrom = str(year)+str(month)+""01""
if month + 1 == 13:
    dateto = str(year+1)+""01""+""01""

query = GqlQuery(""SELECT * FROM Event WHERE date &gt;= :datefrom AND date &lt;= :dateto"", dateto=dateto, datefrom=datefrom)
return query

<p>This method to me looks awful, as I am not very up on the core methods I can use from Python inline with the GQL Query.</p>

At the moment I'm processing the AssImp structures into my own so I can stream them to and from disk more quickly than AssImp can.  Anyway, I'm also processing the scene materials, which gives me a set of choices I'm not too sure how to best handle.</p>

<p>I have the following classes for materials:</p>

<p><em>Material</em></p>

<p>Contains things like ambient, diffuse colour, specular power and so on, also contains an array of maps, with each slot in the array being a ""channel"" (i.e. slot 0 is always ambient map, slot 1 diffuse, slot 2 gloss and so on).</p>

<p><em>Map</em></p>

<p>An instance of a map, with parameters such as wrap mode and a pointer to a texture object.</p>

<p><em>Texture</em></p>

<p>An OpenGL texture map.</p>

<p><em>Sampler</em></p>

<p>An OpenGL sampler object.</p>

<p>Now I'm kind-of wondering how I'm going to handle configuring samplers for any given map in a material.  Technically each map can have different sampler parameters.  For example, a sampler can have UV wrap modes, min and max filters and anisotropy.  Some of these parameters are defined in the scene (wrap modes) and others are defined as engine parameters (filtering, anisotropy).</p>

<p>What I'm thinking about doing is creating one sampler object per map (not per texture, remember, a map points to a texture).  Then when I render an object that has a material with map X, it will automatically bind in the sampler for map X to whichever channel it is.  As it's possible there will be thousands of maps, I'm wondering if the corresponding thousands of samplers is a good idea.</p>

<p>Another way of doing it would be to add samplers to my resource dictionary so they can be shared by any map that happens to have the same parameters.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an opinion on how best to manage things like this?</p>

Now, in each layout, I want to add buttons/slider dynamically from the app (instead of adding buttons/slider dynamically in the source code). That means, initially all these 4 layouts will be blank and when user will select any button or slider in another layout, to add it in any of this 4 layouts, the button or slider will be added in that layout. User will be able to add max 10 views in any vertical layout and the views can be either button, slider or custom view.</p>

<p><strong>My attempt:</strong></p>

<p>First I tried to create 4 vertical layout under the main layout for startup page and I got succeed.</p>

<p>I also find after searching that its possible to add views dynamically in layouts in android. </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3515759/dynamically-adding-a-view-to-activity-layout"">dynamically adding a view to activity layout</a></p>

<p>But most examples, add views dynamically in android by running loops, instantiating the desired view class and then add it in the main layout. Although, in this way, views are added dynamically in the layout, it is done by modifying the source code.</p>

<p>Is it possible to write the source code in a way, so that it can be done directly from the app? So that when user will click on <strong>Add a slider</strong> in ""layout 1"", a slider will be added in layout 1 and then again, when the user will click on ""Add a button"" in layout 1, a button will be added at the end of the slider. User will be able to customize button or slider properties. Also, if the user change the value of the slider, the app will remember its value.</p>

<p>Now, next time, when the app will be opened, those views will be there in the layouts, they will not be deleted and the values will remain unchanged (for example, a ticked check box will remain ticked), so I think I also need some kind of storage or properties manager. </p>

<p>My question is, is it possible to do this in android (because I never seen such apps in android) and if possible, any idea, how can I implement it?</p>

<p>I am totally new to android, so my knowledge is limited but I completed the basic tutorials on android app development and I have plugin development experience in eclipse. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot in. I will highly appreciate your help.</p>

<p>with some stuff in it... basically it is a container for a form, consisting of number of labels, Combos and buttons, all aligned in a line.
My form is not finite, I have a button that adds one extra line for extra input. However for that to work it seams I have to dispose old children of my descComp... </p>

            //descComp.getChildren()[i].setEnabled(false);
            descComp.getChildren()[i].dispose();
        }
        arraySize = tariffConstantsOfType.getQueryRowCount() + 1;
    }
......
}
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason </p>

<pre><code>descComp.getChildren()[i].dispose();
</code></pre>

<p>does not work, meaning it wont dispose all children, that results in errors in inserting new children, therefore spoiling the layout :/ Interesting thing is that </p>

<pre><code>descComp.getChildren()[i].setEnabled(false);

I have it set up now so that this blocked call happens  on a private dispatch queue, and when i do get data, i put a block back on the main queue.  Th e problem is that once I dispatch my private-queue-block and blocking call, I can never really cancel that. Imagine this ability was tied to a user setting toggle.

<p>Are there any xdebug flags, or other features, for reporting on the <strong>object type</strong> for a particular call?  That is, when the report contains this line</p>

<pre><code>Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Abstract-&gt;getAttribute()
</code></pre>

<p>it's telling me the getAttribute method, defined in the <code>Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Abstract</code>, is being called.  In addition to the above information, I'd like to know what type of object is having its getAttribute method called.</p>

<p>My end goal is to know a bit more, at glance, about which objects are consuming large amounts of memory in a system.  Right now, once I've identified a large jump in memory consumption, I'll add some debugging code to the root methods using <code>memory_get_usage</code> which will let me identify the object with a <code>get_class($this);</code> call.  This works, but adds time and mental overhead to the process.  I want to know immediately after profiling which specific objects are responsible.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Per the comments, if I run the following script via a web browser</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
xdebug_start_trace();
abstract class A
{
    abstract function foo();        

    public function bar()
    {
        echo ""A Test"",""\n"";
    }
}

class B extends A
{
    public function foo()
    {
    }
}

$test = new B;
$test-&gt;bar();
</code></pre>

<p>xDebug reports the following in its trace file.</p>

<p>What I want (and should, per the comments, expect?), is instead of </p>

<p>In twig template just using form.password is not enough since no error message will be shown. I have to use form.password.first.</p>

<pre><code>{% if not form.vars.valid %}
...
    {{ form_errors(form.password.first) }}
...
{% endif  %}
</code></pre>

<p>The result is:</p>

<pre><code>The password must be at least 8 characters long.  &lt;-- The default error message
Password must be at least 8 characters long.      &lt;-- Mine
</code></pre>

<p>If I don't set minMessage or maxMessage the result is:</p>

<pre><code>The password must be at least 8 characters long.  
This value is too short. It should have 8 characters or more. &lt;-- Default minMessage message
</code></pre>

<p>How can I do for making it show only one error message? Of course i can intercept form errors in controller and manipulate it there, but i wanted a better solution.</p>

Specifically, I want to delete a script that forces the page to load inside a frame since having the page inside a frame breaks F5 (Pressing F5 makes the page jump back to the front page instead of reloading the current page).  Also, I don't want to load the page through a proxy with AJAX and switching to chrome/opera is not an option either.

These remote files sometimes vary greatly in output volume from one to another.  How can I implement some form of automatic gain control for the AVPlayer?

<p>Currently (Emacs 24.x), the split-window and siblings split-window-below and split-window-right don't seem to allow such a customization. Is this true?</p>

<p>If so, how to tweak Emacs to have this behaviour? Redefining split-window or split-window-below and split-window-right to have an extra step of switching to the next on the non-focused window. This could be done with advices:</p>

<pre><code>(defun split-window-and-next-buffer (new-window)
  (let ((old-window (selected-window)))
    (select-window new-window)
    (next-buffer)
    (select-window old-window)
    new-window))

(defadvice split-window-right (after split-window-right-and-next-buffer
                     activate protect compile)
  (split-window-and-next-buffer ad-return-value))

  (split-window-and-next-buffer ad-return-value))

<p>With the corrections indicated by lawlist which are already available above the advices already work and I get the intended behaviour, but it isn't customizable to have the old behaviour.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way with CakePHP to do it or I need to set each field individually in my controller and retrieve it in my view.</p>

<p>Thank you </p>

<pre><code>Duplicate ContentPlaceHolder 'X' were found. ContentPlaceHolders require unique IDs.

<p>So I tried to set the IDs with ID=""&lt;%= ""X"" %>"" and no, won't let me either:</p>

<pre><code>Server tags cannot contain &lt;% ... %&gt; constructs.

<p>Then I tried &lt;%# Eval(""X"") %> and nope:</p>

<pre><code>The ID property of a control can only be set using the ID attribute in the tag and a simple value. Example: &lt;asp:Button runat=""server"" id=""Button1"" /&gt;

<p>Is there any way to achieve what I'm trying to do? I was thinking something like</p>

<pre><code>echo '&lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID=""X"" runat=""server"" /&gt;'

<p>Or some dynamic way to add the tag because apparently the parser can't identify the if else block which won't let two tags have the same ID.</p>

I'm starting to share these with employees, and am looking to be able to set up each remote computer once only. From there on, update collections on a network path. And because each computer looks to the shared location, everyone should always be working with up to date macros and quickparts etc. </p>

<p>So. What I already know:<br>
- Required macros are saved in a separate module, ready to be shared/exported.<br>
- Macros themselves occasionally reference local paths on my computer.<br>
- I will need to reference paths with generic code or use Environ variables.<br>
- Building blocks and quickparts are saved in a <strong>separate</strong> template file (currently located in Appdata, along with default building block file).  </p>

<p>What I dont know:<br>
a) How to point Word to a network path to retrieve macros from custom macro files. (Would I just have to import a fresh macro file at every important update, on each PC?)<br>
b) What's the best way to load a building block item from a <strong>CUSTOM</strong> path?  </p>

<p>My custom BuildingBlock template file is not loaded properly on occasion:  </p>

<pre><code>Dim objTemplate As Template
Dim objBB As BuildingBlock    

'set template to store the building block   
 Set objTemplate = Templates(""C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft_
\Document Building Blocks\1033\CustomBBlocks.dotx"")

Set objBB = objTemplate.BuildingBlockEntries.Item(""[EntryName]"")
</code></pre>

<p>I know this because the code spits out a 'CollectionDoesntExist' error unless I click the Quickparts gallery prior to running the code for the first time. So it's like Word cant be bothered to open the template file and look inside unless I do it from the UI first. </p>

<p>Of course, if I first open the Quickparts gallery from the UI, prior to running my code, Word seems to figure it out, and inserts the correct Building Block entry without any issue.</p>

<p>I am creating an Internal Tooling Website which stores Tools and their related information.</p>

<p>My vision is to have a web address (Http://website.local/Tool/ID)
Where ID is the ID of the Tool we want displayed.
My reasoning is then I can extend the functionality of the URL to allow for various other functions.</p>

<p>Currently I use a custom httpHandler which intercepts any URL which is in the 'Tool' Folder.</p>

<pre><code>    using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;

namespace Tooling_Website.Tool
{
    public class ToolHandler : IHttpHandler
    {
        public bool IsReusable
        {
            get { return false; }
        }


        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
        {
            //The URL that would hit this handler is: http://{website}/Tool/{AN ID eg: http://{website}/Tool/PDINJ000500}
            //The idea is that what would be the page name is now the ID of the tool.
            //tool is an ASPX Page.
            tool tl = new tool();
            System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter htr = new System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter(context.Response.Output);
            tl.RenderControl(htr);
            htr.Close();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I have a page inside the 'Tool' folder (Tool\tool.aspx) which I want my customer httpHandler to Render into the Response.</p>

<p>But this method doesn't work (It doesn't fail, just doesn't show anything) I can write the raw file to the response but obviously thats not my goal.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

CoreData/ArrayControllers/Cocoa bindings look working OK to me but cannot save any contents to an SQLite file via ""Save"" command in File menu.
A file actually was saved but it has no contents.
I haven't added any line of codes into this project except for debug purpose. The sample project looks same, too. The differences are
my new project has AppDelegate, ViewController and using storeyboard.</p>

<p>The sample project works perfectly. But my newly created one doesn't save/read at all.</p>

<p>Tried many things but no luck.
tried to override ""configurePersistentStoreCoordinatorForURL"" to set SQLite options to journal_mode=""DELETE"" but no luck.
Checked if the project settings are different or not but looks almost same to me.</p>

<p>But I found the app is auto-saving data in the ""~/Library/Autosave Information/"" and the file has contents as expected.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if I can get any advices on this issue.
Thanks in advance,
regards,</p>

<p>This works and I'm using it currently, but it's hard to organize and if I have a method name conflict I don't have a way to resolve it. How would I declare a <code>static</code> method but expose it named as above? Something like this:</p>

class MyClass {
     public static function theStaticMethod() ...

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code>    void *thread_func(void *thread_args) {
      // extract socket_fd, epoll_fd, &amp;event, &amp;events_array from 
      //     thread_args
      // epoll_wait() using epoll_fd and events_array received from main
      // now all threads would be using same epoll_fd and events array 
    }

    void main( void ) {
      // create and bind to socket
      // create events_fd
      // allocate memory for events array
      // subscribe to events EPOLLIN and EPOLLET
      // pack the socket_fd, epoll_fd, &amp;events, &amp;events_array into 
      //   thread_args struct.

      // create multiple threads and pass thread_func and 
      //   same thread_args to all threads
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Or is it better to do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>    void *thread_func(void *socket_fd) {
      // create events_fd
      // allocate memory for events array
      // subscribe to events EPOLLIN and EPOLLET
      // epoll_wait using own epoll_fd and events_array
      // now all threads would have a separate epoll_fd with 
      //   events populated on its own array
   }

   void main(void) {
     // create and bind to socket

     //create multiple threads and pass thread_func and socket_fd to 
     //  all threads
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a good example of how to do this in C? The examples I saw run the event loop in <code>main()</code> and spawn a new thread to process the request whenever an event is detected. What I want to do is create a specific number of threads at the start of the program and have each thread running the event loop and processing requests.</p>

<p>I was struggling to draw a box... seems like a pretty simple task, but I must have misunderstood something.</p>

<p>So to help me see better what was going on I attempted to draw line loops instead.</p>

<p>For some reason my line loop keeps jumping back to the coordinate (0,0,0). I don't understand why this is the case.</p>

<p>Here is my drawing code:</p>

<pre><code>GLfloat* points = new GLfloat[12];
points[0] = 0.5; // x
points[1] = 0.5; // y
points[2] = 0.0; // z
points[3] = 0.6; // x
points[4] = 0.5;
points[5] = 0.0;
points[6] = 0.6;
points[7] = 0.6;
points[8] = 0.0;
points[9] = 0.5;
points[10] = 0.6;
points[11] = 0.0;
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, points);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
glDrawArrays(GL_LINE_LOOP, 0, 12);
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine for drawing GL_LINES (pair of lines), but does not draw GL_TRIANGLE_FAN or GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP or GL_LINE_LOOP correctly. There is always 1 coordinate at (0,0,0). There are 2 sets of this code, the other with different coordinates. Both shapes have a line which goes to (0,0,0).</p>

<p>I assume I misunderstood something completely?</p>

<p>Probably should mention I am used to the old OpenGL.</p>

<p>How do I make these different jQuery elements to work with some easy method after they being loaded into the main page? I dont know much about jQuery, it would be great if I could just ad/edit a function on the scripts to make them work after inload, but ofcurse its propably more difficult than that. In the passed days I have tried initialize the different object that loads in but notice that it was quite difficult with complicated scripts.</p>

<p>The page load in new content like this (selectbox):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""selectbox""&gt; 
&lt;option&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

<p>jQuery code to the selectbox:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){ 
$(""#selectbox"").change(function(){ 
var selectedOption = $('#selectbox :selected').val(); 
$containerDiv = $('#div_that_will_get_content'); 
$containerDiv.html("""");

});
</code></pre>

<p>Selected option in selectbox (1) collects data from Page.html #div1, then send the data to div ""#div_that_will_get_content"". So the div get loaded in after the main page have  finish loading.</p>

<p>Now if I want to put a jQuery element in this div and then load that div into the main page via the selectbox and to ""#div_that_will_get_content"", those elements dont work. Can anybody show a easy jQuery example with a smal explanation how the script was written from the begining and what you changed to make it work after it was loaded in?</p>

And what's interesting me are processes of installation, upgrade and scaling out from the customer perspective. From what I see, there are at least four options:</p>

<p><strong>Professional services</strong></p>

<p>A company provides a professional that does all the deployment and scaling tasks.</p>

<p>Advantages: customer doesn't care at all.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: a company must have such professionals in pool who deeply understands the overall product architecture as well as of every other component.</p>

<p><strong>Virtualized environment</strong></p>

<p>Customer provides high grade hardware, and all the components are deployed as virtual appliances into some hypervisor.</p>

<p>Advantages: requires little attention from customer, deployment/scaling can be automated.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: Customer must buy high grade hardware in advance, which can be expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Homogenous Cluster</strong></p>

<p>Product is installed as a single node. In order to scale, another similar node is installed.</p>

<p>Advantages: Installation is simple, and scaling looks to customer like an installation of another single node.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: Every node is the same - resource usage not so clever.</p>

<p><strong>Well Documented Product</strong></p>

<p>Customer reads tons of documentation, learns how (and when) to install and scale one or another component himself.</p>

<p>Advantages: release and forget (once all the documentation is written)</p>

<p>Disadvantages: there's no way customer's gonna do it correctly</p>

<p>What option is used mostly and why?</p>

Any help is appreciated, but what I'm trying to achieve is for any given month, list out hours worked per week for each employee.</p>

<p>Actual Table:</p>

<pre><code>Employee         Date          Hours_Worked

John             141201        10
John             141210        15

Jane             141203        25
Jane             141206        10
</code></pre>

<p>Desired Table:</p>

<pre><code>Employee          Wk1          Wk2          Wk3          Wk4          Wk5

John              10           15           20           0            0
Jane              35           0            0            0            0
</code></pre>

<p>And probably worth noting; the date column is a char(6) datatype.</p>

<p>What I've been doing right now is having multiple queries, one for each week, like this:  </p>

<pre><code>SELECT employee, sum(hours_worked) as wk1 FROM job_detail WHERE date_sequence BETWEEN '141200' AND '141208' GROUP BY employee;  
</code></pre>

<p>But this is only taking me part of the way because I'm getting a row for each one, even if they have the same employee, which is where I thought about union, but then ideally the results need to be in a column for 1 row per employee, which is where I thought about pivot.</p>

Currently trying to migrate the same app to a Ubuntu server which is working except for a particular folder of images, which I can't seem to figure out what's going on with. </p>

<p>I'm deploying via Capistrano so I'm deploying to current folder. Here's my apache .conf file settings:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Virtualhost *:80&gt;
    ServerName myserver
   DocumentRoot  /var/www/folder/current/public
   &lt;Directory /var/www/folder/current/public&gt;
      Allow from all
      Options -Multiviews
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The files exist in my app (under assets/vendors). I don't get any errors during building or precompiling or deployment. When trying to serve the files on the new server, I get the following message: </p>

<pre><code>Started GET ""/system/vendors/logos/000/000/002/original/filename.png?1354897276"" for 68.188.46.74 at 2013-01-25 00:51:37 +0000

  actionpack (3.2.11) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/show_exceptions.rb:56:in `call'
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried permissions changes including 777 the tmp folder (which I would never normally do), just to see if that makes a difference. </p>

<p>It looks like the system assets pipeline folder is in my shared directory, but I don't see a symbolic link to it like I do the logs directory. So I tried creating a symbolic link to it and that didn't do anything. </p>

<p>I'm at a loss. Any suggestions? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1/25</strong></p>

<p>When I posted this, I failed to notice it was a paperclip uploaded image and that is why these images are in the system path. So I'm calling them via views from the logo attribute which is defined in the model like so: </p>

<pre><code>  has_attached_file :logo
</code></pre>

<p>And in my view, I'm calling it via this:</p>

<pre><code>          &lt;%= image_tag(vendor.logo.url, :class =&gt; 'rounded'); %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this works on two other servers, so the migration is clearing affecting it and I think it may be permissions related? </p>

<p>ImageMagick is installed on the server. </p>

<p>but when I'm trying to access <code>https://www.google.com.ua</code> from the target machine, the requests now time out.</p>

<p>Fiddler app shows that it has recieved the request in the <code>BeforeRequest</code> event, but it never sends a reply (<code>AfterSessionComplete</code> never gets called).</p>

<p>Why does this happen and how can I fix it?</p>

<p>How do I do the same for port 80?</p>

This presentation is more than one year old. I wonder if since then Cloud9 got complex refactoring functions which understand eg. the NodeJs require() statments? Of course this question doesn't want to narrow to Cloud9, we have brackets.io, Orion, etc. This is just the presentation i came across so that's why i'm giving examples based on Cloud9.</p>

<p>Say i have a Node module which exports an object prototype, and i have an another module which uses this. Say i like to rename a function in the exported prototype and what i'm looking for is that the IDE will refactor the calls in the other module according to the change.

<p>I don't know the architecture of Retrofit/OkHttpClient deeply, but as far i understand the execute method can be called multiple times from multiple threads, the <code>OkClient</code> is the same shared between <code>Calls</code> only a shallow copy is done.
I'm using <code>synchronized</code>in <code>refreshToken()</code>method to avoid multiple threads to enter in <code>refreshToken()</code> and make multiple login calls, i a refresh is needed only one thread should make the refreshCall and the others will use the renewed token.</p>

<p>I haven´t tested it seriously yet, but for what i can see it's working fine. Maybe someone had this problem already and can share his solution, or it can be helpful for someone with the same/similar problem.</p>

<p>I have read many sources online in search of the perfect answer but I have not found what I am looking for (as of yet).</p>

<p>Ideally, the two clients will go through the exact same authentication process so that the one set of code is easily maintainable (Hence, the reason I am developing in Angularjs - so that both clients can share the same code base). I assume that I will be lead down the oauth2 route and have the token being passed with every api call once authentication has occurred but as I said, this is an assumption. </p>

<p>I have also come across JSESSION mentioned here and there but nothing too detailed that I could grasp the concept 100%.</p>

<p>I am not looking for the easy way out as I have spent a lot of the day researching this. I am a student so I am do not have the most in depth knowledge but if I can could get pointed in the right direction that I would highly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Some of the sources include - although there were a LOT more:

<p>I also have two classes that inherit from it:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>HandicappedCustomer</code>, where I want to set the price to be 0.</li>
<li><code>RegularCustomer</code>, where I want to set the price to be 100.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now if I create an instance of each of these classes and called <code>getPrice()</code>, I return 0 for both. What is the easiest way to make it return 0 and 100 when I call <code>getPrice()</code> for each corresponding instance of the class?</p>

<p>When I try to call <code>setPrice(100)</code> inside the <code>RegularCustomer</code> class, I see that it doesn't work. To put it plainly, I want to have the following code in my main:</p>

<pre><code>Customer a = new HandicappedCustomer(); 
Customer b = new RegularCustomer();
System.out.println(a.getPrice());
System.out.println(b.getPrice());

"11174496","1","11174599","","2012-06-24 02:14:05","","0","730","<p>I seem to have trouble extending static classes in PHP.</p>

<p>PHP Code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    class InstanceModule {
        public static $className = 'None';
        public static function PrintClassName() {
            echo self::$className . ' (' . __CLASS__ . ')&lt;br /&gt;';
        }
    }

    class A extends InstanceModule {
        public static function Construct() {
            self::$className = ""A"";
        }
    }

    class B extends InstanceModule {
        public static function Construct() {
            self::$className = ""B"";
        }
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My calling code, and what I'd expect:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    //PHP Version 5.3.14

    A::PrintClassName(); //Expected 'None' - actual result: 'None'
    B::PrintClassName(); //Expected 'None' - actual result: 'None'

    A::Construct();

    A::PrintClassName(); //Expected 'A' - actual result: 'A'
    B::PrintClassName(); //Expected 'None' - actual result: 'A'

    B::Construct();

    A::PrintClassName(); //Expected 'A' - actual result: 'B'
    B::PrintClassName(); //Expected 'B' - actual result: 'B'

    A::Construct();

    A::PrintClassName(); //Expected 'A' - actual result: 'A'
    B::PrintClassName(); //Expected 'B' - actual result: 'A'
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Actual complete output:</p>

<pre><code>None (InstanceModule)
None (InstanceModule)
A (InstanceModule)
A (InstanceModule)
B (InstanceModule)
B (InstanceModule)
A (InstanceModule)
A (InstanceModule)
</code></pre>

<p>So what's going on here (from what it seems) is that as soon as I set <code>self::$className</code> on either of the extending classes, it overrides the variable from the other class. I assume this is because I use static classes, and there can only be one <code>InstanceModule</code> class instead of simply copying it to both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, as were my previous understanding of <code>extends</code>. I've tried using the keyword <code>static::$className</code> instead, but it seems to make no difference.</p>

<p>It'd be lovely if anyone could guide me in the right direction of what I'm doing wrong here, and what to do to fix this problem.</p>

<p><em><strong>Edit</em></strong>:
To clarify, this code does what I want, but is obviously a horrible workaround since it would ruin the whole idea of extending and reusing functions:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    class A {
        public static $className = 'None';
        public static function PrintClassName() {
            echo self::$className . ' (' . __CLASS__ . ')&lt;br /&gt;';
        }
        public static function Construct() {
            self::$className = ""A"";
        }
    }

    class B {
        public static $className = 'None';
        public static function PrintClassName() {
            echo self::$className . ' (' . __CLASS__ . ')&lt;br /&gt;';
        }
        public static function Construct() {
            self::$className = ""B"";
        }
    }
?&gt;

<p>It doesn't make sense to subtract 5 from 2, because we end up with -3 generic time units, which is useless. But if ""hour"" is a subtype of ""minute"", we could convert 2 hours to 120 minutes, and yield 115 minutes, or 1 hour and 55 minutes.</p>

<p>Similarly, if we want to add 5 apples to 5 oranges, we cannot evaluate this in terms of apples, but might expect to end up with 10 fruit.</p>

<p>It seems in the above examples, and generally when using a number as an adjective, the integers need to be parameterized by the type of object they describing. I think it would be very useful if instead of declaring </p>

<pre><code>val hours = 2
val minutes = 5
</code></pre>

<p>you could do something like</p>

<pre><code>val hours = 2[Hour]
val minutes = 5[Minute]
val result = hours - minutes
assert (result == 115[Minute])
</code></pre>

<p>Does anything like this exist, would it be useful, and is it something that could be implemented?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: to clarify, the time example above is just a random example I thought up. My question is more whether in general the idea of parameterized Numerics is a useful concept, just as you have parameterized Lists etc. (The answer might be ""no"", I don't know!)</p>

<p>The problem is: there are more than 100 images and corresponding objects and it would take ages to add all of them and would make my code far to long. On top of that I will add and remove images daily. Is there a way of making this shorter?
This is what I thought of but I don't have the knowledge to do it.</p>

<p>I want jQuery to identify all objects with a name that start with ""object"" and have a value of property ""price""  that is within the range of the slider. To make this easier we say this is set1. </p>

<p>Then I want jQuery to find all id´s that start with ""dot"" and finish with the same 4 digit numbers as the objects in set 1 and make them visible and all other images with an id that starts with ""dot"" to be invisible. </p>

<p>Example using the given codes: jQuery scans and finds that <code>object0001.price= 1300</code>. Then jquery looks for image that has <code>id=dot0001</code>. If <code>object0001.price=1300</code> is within the range of the slider image with <code>id=dot0001</code> becomes visible and if it isn't it becomes hidden. </p>

<p>Any help appreciated. If there is a question, I am right here. </p>

<p>I am open sourcing a few old Visual Studio applications I created a while back. I have created new solutions using my new VS2012 environment for them and have gotten the projects set up as git repositories. I got everything working fine in Visual Studio 2012 with no changes to the source code, all I needed to do was make sure I was linking the proper libraries in the new project configurations. </p>

<p>I would like to configure these projects as to have <strong>maximum compatibility</strong> for others downloading the project from Github. On this machine I have VS2010 installed alongside the latest VS2012 version. After I got everything working right for both of the projects in VS2012, I tried to open them up in VS2010.</p>

<p>When I tried to build I got a single error:</p>

<pre><code>Specified platform toolset (v110) is not installed or invalid.
Please make sure that a supported PlatformToolset value is selected.    
C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\Platforms\Win32\Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.Targets  518
</code></pre>

<h3>What I Tried</h3>

<p>So I opened up the properties for the project, went to <code>Configuration Options --&gt;  General</code> and the <strong>Platform Toolset</strong> was indeed set to <code>Visual Studio 2012 (v110)</code>. This input is a drop down box and the <code>v110</code> value is not listed, instead I get two choices: </p>

<ul>
<li>v100</li>
<li>v90</li>
</ul>

<p>These correspond to VS2010 and VS2008 respectively. If I change the value to v100 and rebuild I get no errors and my program runs just fine in my Visual Studio 2010 environment.</p>

<p>When I open the project back up in Visual Studio 2012, if tells me that I have an old project file and asks if I want to upgrade, I say yes and it upgrades. I rebuild and run to make sure everything is still working. When I open the configuration options in VS2012 the <strong>Platform Toolset</strong> is set back to `Visual Studio 2012 (v110) but clicking the drop down input there are several more choices listed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2012 (v110)</li>
<li>v110_wp80</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2012 - Windows XP (v110_xp)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 (v100)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2008 (v90)</li>
<li>&lsaquo;inherit from parent or project defaults&rsaquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Questions</h3>

<p>This has led me to several questions. I am going to pose them all. It would be nice to get as much information as I can, but a good answer to just one of them would probably solve my problem.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I'm not using features specific to newer versions of Visual Studio, is it possible to set up a solution which can be opened and run without modification in as many versions as possible (ie. 2008, 2010, or 2012)? If so, how?</p></li>
<li><p>If I set the <strong>Platform Toolset</strong> to v90 (VS2008) from within Visual Studio 2012, and it's able to build and run, does this mean that it will build and run for users with VS2012, VS2010, and VS2008?</p></li>
<li><p>What exactly does the <code>&lt;inherit for parent or project defaults&gt;</code> option do? What would the project defaults be set up as? Can this be used to tell Visual Studio to try to using whichever installed <strong>Platform Toolset</strong> will work.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any other options besides <strong>Platform Toolset</strong> in Visual Studio that I can set to increase compatibility with others' development environments?</p></li>

<p>So, I submit the form and use backbone.syphon to create a representation of the form data. The object I build looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>{languages: {
    {
        de_DE: {
            default: false
            enabled: true
        },
        en_US: {
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to save it to a backbone model with attributes that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>attributes: {
    id: ""5""
    languages: {
        de_DE: {
             default: false,
             label: ""German""
             language: ""de_DE""
             selected: false
         },
         en_CA: {
         ...
         },
         ...
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I save the existing model using <code>model.save(data)</code> using the above data structure for my data, the default and label instances are completely removed from my model. They're not even sent to the server. They are just completelely removed, though they do sit in the <code>previousAttrs</code> object.</p>

<p>The instance of my model's sync setup looks so:</p>

<pre><code>sync: function(method, model, options){
    var baseUrl = window.location.origin+'/qp-api/v1/master-app/';

    var config = {}

    switch(method){
         case ""create"":
         break;
         case ""read"":
             config = _.extend(config, {
                 method: ""GET"",
                 url: baseUrl+this.id+'/languages'
             });
         break;
         case ""update"":
             config =_.extend({
                 method: ""PUT"",
                 url: baseUrl+this.id+'/languages'
             });
        break;
        case ""delete"":
        break;
    };
    options = _.extend(options, config);

    return Backbone.Model.prototype.sync.call(this, method, model, options);
}, 
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong? I thought backbone's save function would only update the changed attrs. It looks to me like my data object should map to the setup of my models attrs. Shouldn't they just update? Am I not understanding something about how existing model's save?</p>

<pre><code> bool Shape::orderByArea(const Shape* lhs, const shape* rhs)
    {
      return lhs-&gt;area() &lt; rhs-&gt;area();
    }

<p>Then at main.cpp I did this</p>

<pre><code>std::sort(shaped, shaped + 3, orderByArea);
</code></pre>

<p>however i get an error, orderByArea was not declared in this scope.</p>

<p><strong>Another thing i tried was:</strong>
To sort using vector</p>

<p>At Shape.h</p>

<pre><code>public:

bool operator&lt;const Shape&amp; x) const
{
return area &lt; x.area;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At main.cpp</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;ShapeTwoD*&gt; sortVector;
sortVector.clear();
sortVector.assign(shaped,shaped + shapeCounter);

sort(sortVector.begin(),sortVector.end());

for(int i=0;i&lt;shapeCounter;i++)
{
cout &lt;&lt; sortVector[i].toDisplay() &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But nothing seems sorted. I try do a printout its position is same.</p>

<p><strong>Updates: Its fixed now. sort is working . Thanks to the experts !</strong></p>

<p>I got another question is</p>

<p>Shape *shaped[100];</p>

<p>How do i copy the value of </p>

<pre><code>Shape *shaped[100];
</code></pre>

<p>into </p>

<p>What I want this code to do is to choose, first, the users who are members of Football club, and then out of those, chose the users who are single.  But I cannot figure out how to write a stylesheet for this.  I wrote this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template name=""temp""&gt;
        &lt;xsl:param name=""a1""/&gt;
        &lt;xsl:param name=""pro""/&gt;
        &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
            &lt;xsl:when test=""$pro = 'marital_status'""&gt;
                &lt;xsl:for-each select=""/document/users/user""&gt;
                    &lt;xsl:if test=""marital_status=$a1""&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select="".""/&gt;
                    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;                
                &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
            &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
            &lt;xsl:when test=""$pro = 'memberofgroups'""&gt;
            &lt;xsl:for-each select=""/document/users/user""&gt;
                &lt;xsl:for-each select=""./groups/member_of_group""&gt;
                    &lt;xsl:if test="".=$a1""&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select="".""/&gt;
                    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
                &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
            &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match=""include""&gt;
        &lt;xsl:call-template name=""temp""&gt;
            &lt;xsl:with-param name=""a1""&gt;
                &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""*[2]""/&gt;
            &lt;/xsl:with-param&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>While calling the template I pass the correct values I suppose.</p>

<p>Problem is I get all the users who are single, plus all the users who are members of that particular group.  However I want single users who are also member of Football club.  I don't want the stylesheet to be hard-coded, because I also want to do filtering based on other elements. </p>

<p>I can not figure out how can I save the filtered elements into something which could be used as an input for the next XPath expression.  Or am I making some mistake while writing the constraints for filtering the document.  Or could there be any other more appropriate way of writing a document for filtering?  I will much appreciate your help.

Within this content the user can navigate through a bunch of sites which are being loaded using AJAX. One step on this sites requires quite some time. Since I didn't find anything about a timeoue for <code>UIWebView</code> I tried to set it on the initial <code>NSURLRequest</code> it loads.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this does not seem to do anything. I'm not quite sure if I'm supposed to set the timeout myself? Is there anything I'm missing? Does the <code>UIWebView</code> override my timeout? I'm a little bit confused on this so any help would be appreciated. :)</p>

<p>Best<br>
–f</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I built a test project to verify my ""theory"" on how the <code>UIWebView</code> works with timeouts. Here is the setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>a PHP file called sleep.php that has a parameter with which I can configure the time to sleep until it sends a result</li>
<li><p>a little Xcode project with a single view which is a webView that loads the sleep.php like this:</p>

<p>NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url cachePolicy:NSURLCacheStorageAllowed timeoutInterval:10];
[webView loadRequest:request];</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, while playing with the seconds parameter I could see that the <code>UIWebView</code> works as it should. I get either <code>webViewDidFinishLoad:</code> or <code>webView:didFailLoadWithError:</code> depending on the timeout.</p>

<p>After verifying that the <code>timeoutInterval</code> works as advertised I brought in a proxy.php (that has two links to the sleep.php configured with 5 and 15 seconds) to see if my request configuration is still valid for new requests. I changed the initial <code>NSURLRequest</code> to use the proxy.php but left the 10 seconds configuration for the timeout.</p>

<p>When I start the app now the two links are being displayed. When I click the first one it loads as expected after 5 seconds. Unfortunately, the second link loads as well after 15 seconds.</p>

<p>So my first attempt to reconfigure the <code>NSURLRequest</code> would be to change it in <code>webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType:</code>. Unfortunately again, the web service works with AJAX so the delegate method does not get called.</p>

<p>Any other suggestions? Is there a way to globally configure the timeout value for the whole <code>UIWebView</code>?</p>

<p>Now for the usage: My classes usually have a static <code>logger_t</code> (typedef for <code>boost::log::sources::severity_channel_logger&lt;severity_level, std::string&gt;</code>) member</p>

<pre><code>class A {
public:
    logger_t logger;
    //other stuff here
    void function_which_does_logging();
};

L::logger_t A::logger(boost::log::keywords::channel = ""ClassA"");

void A::function_which_does_logging(){
    //do non logging related stuff
    BOOST_LOG_SEV(logger, L::result) &lt;&lt; ""the error is: "" &lt;&lt; 0.1234567890;
    //do non logging related stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>My current solution to the problem is putting a logging statement in the beginning of my program</p>

<pre><code>int main(){
    L::logger_t logger(boost::log::keywords::channel = ""init"");
    BOOST_LOG_SEV(logger, L::critical) &lt;&lt; ""setting up logger"" &lt;&lt; std::scientific &lt;&lt; std::setprecision(std::numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::digits10 + 1);

    //do stuff
}

<h1>Answer</h1>

<p>I edited Chris's answer to provide a generic extension method that I've added to my Common library.  I can see this being helpful for other people as well so here it is:</p>

<pre><code>    public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetDescendants&lt;T&gt;(this T component, Func&lt;T,bool&gt; isComposite, Func&lt;T,IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt; getCompositeChildren)
    {
        var children = getCompositeChildren(component);
        return children
            .Where(isComposite)
            .SelectMany(x =&gt; x.GetDescendants(isComposite, getCompositeChildren))
            .Concat(children);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But after seeing this we did change the Signing algorithm on the relying trust party to rsa-sha256 but still its displaying the same message .</p>

<pre><code>$_POST['called']
$_POST['chk1']
etc etc...
</code></pre>

<p>But now i have a problem that i cant seem to find a solution for.</p>

<p>Depending on how many checkboxes are selected, i loop (using js) to see all checked boxes and add them to the js object that ends up looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>doBulk = {
   called: ""Approved"",
   chk0: ""1789156857"",
   chk2: ""5134465673753"",
   chk3: ""234123554646"",
   chk10: ""25511545542""        
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now the <strong>chkXX</strong> can be any number from 0-19 (so 20 check boxes per page). I am sending that just fine to my PHP page but i am unsure on how to go about looping to get the needed data to update the database.</p>

<pre><code>$chk1 = $_POST['chk0'];
$chk2 = $_POST['chk1'];
$chk3 = $_POST['chk2'];
$chk4 = $_POST['chk3'];
$chk5 = $_POST['chk4'];
$chk6 = $_POST['chk5'];
$chk7 = $_POST['chk6'];
$chk8 = $_POST['chk7'];
$chk9 = $_POST['chk8'];
$chk10 = $_POST['chk9'];
$chk11 = $_POST['chk10'];
$chk12 = $_POST['chk11'];
$chk13 = $_POST['chk12'];
$chk14 = $_POST['chk13'];
$chk15 = $_POST['chk14'];
$chk16 = $_POST['chk15'];
$chk17 = $_POST['chk16'];
$chk18 = $_POST['chk17'];
$chk19 = $_POST['chk18'];
$chk20 = $_POST['chk19'];
</code></pre>

<p>I could do a lot of <strong>if than else</strong> to check to see if each has data but there has got to be a better way of doing that?</p>

<p>So if i am doing a bulk mySQL update then i would have to run a query for <strong>each</strong> checkbox that i have a value for above? Is there also a better way of updating all the records that are needed in one swoop?</p>

To make this possible gwt-log needs a so called symbol-map which maps all of the obfuscated symbol names to the original Java symbol names. The GWT compiler is capable of generating these symbol maps but for some reason they are saved to a strange location, eg.:</p>

<p>target/project-name-1.0-SNAPSHOT/project-name/.junit_symbolMaps/0F9FD6EF6A1BC63EA834AC33C7ED13F3.symbolMap</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/compile-mojo.html#deploy"" rel=""nofollow"">GWT Maven Plugin Documentation</a> the GWT compiler has a ""-deploy"" parameter which determines where to create files like that and which per default points to ""WEB-INF/deploy"". But even if I manually set this parameter to the correct location the compiler still creates the symbol-maps in the wrong folder.</p>

<p>I even downloaded the GWT Maven Plugin sources and added some log output to find out whether or not the ""-deploy"" parameter is passed correctly to the compiler but all seems fine.</p>

<p>Has anybody experienced a similar behavior?</p>

<p>Thanks!

I have been able to create single events, read all calendar events for a day and remove events. My problem is that I cannot find any information in regards to deleting an entire series of recurring events. When I delete an event the code I have only deletes the entry of 1 event and not all instances of the recurrence.</p>

<p>Not sure if I am just passing the wrong Id and ChangeKey to the delete code or if there is special code to handle recurring events.</p>

<p>My code for deleting events is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// Define the delete item class
$request = new EWSType_DeleteItemType();
// Send to trash can, or use EWSType_DisposalType::HARD_DELETE instead to bypass the bin directly
$request-&gt;DeleteType = EWSType_DisposalType::MOVE_TO_DELETED_ITEMS;
$request-&gt;SendMeetingCancellations = EWSType_CalendarItemCreateOrDeleteOperationType::SEND_ONLY_TO_ALL;

$items = new EWSType_NonEmptyArrayOfBaseItemIdsType();
foreach ($IDs as $id) {
// Set the item to be deleted
    $item = new EWSType_ItemIdType();
    $item-&gt;Id = $id['Id'];
    $item-&gt;ChangeKey = $id['ChangeKey'];
    $items-&gt;ItemId[] = $item;
}
$request-&gt;ItemIds = $items;
// Send the request
$response = $this-&gt;ews-&gt;DeleteItem($request);
?&gt;

<p>I have created a class to handle most of my EWS commands. Here is a function I created to handle getting the master event IDs.</p>

<pre><code>public function GetMasterEventID($EventID)
{
    if (empty($EventID)) {
        return false;

<p>my problem is that i have a CV_32FC3 cv::Mat, where values are stored in range between 0 and 255, let's call it S. </p>

<p>I have to create a matrix, called P, where store BGR values of all pixel.</p>

<p>So P should have as rows number the total element of S pixel, and as cols number the number of channels (3).</p>

<p>this is what i've tried to do:</p>

<pre><code>int n_pixels = S.cols * S.rows;
p = Mat::zeros(n_pixels, 3, CV_32FC1);

for(int i=0; i&lt;n_pixels; i++) {
    Scalar pixel = S.at&lt;Scalar&gt;(i); // i've tried also Vec3f, Point3_, etc..

    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,0) = pixel[0];
    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,1) = pixel[1];
    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,2) = pixel[2];
}
</code></pre>

<p>i've also tried low level c-api data access like this:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;selection.rows; i++) {
    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,0) = S.ptr&lt;float&gt;(i)[0];
    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,1) = S.ptr&lt;float&gt;(i)[1];
    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,2) = S.ptr&lt;float&gt;(i)[2];

}
</code></pre>

<p>and also splitting channels (but splitted channels have type CV_8U so i think it is wrong):</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;Mat&gt; bgr;
cv::split(S, bgr);

for(int i=0; i&lt;n_pixels; i++) {
    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,0) = bgr[0].data[i];
    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,1) = bgr[1].data[i];
    p.at&lt;float&gt;(i,2) = bgr[2].data[i];
}
</code></pre>

<p>I guess the last line is important, I read somewhere that it should first sort all records and then limit them. So it seems correct?</p>

I found <a href=""http://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html"" rel=""nofollow"">tracking.js</a> to be quite suitable for the job. I've got the problem solved in the browser. As i tried to move things over to node.js, i realised that tracking.js depends on DOM elements to convert images to matrices, etc. </p>

<p>My usecase looks similar to this (from the tracking.js examples):</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function() {
  var img = document.getElementById('img');
  var demoContainer = document.querySelector('.demo-container');

  var tracker = new tracking.ColorTracker(['magenta', 'cyan', 'yellow']);

  tracker.on('track', function(event) {
    event.data.forEach(function(rect) {
      window.plot(rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height, rect.color);
    });
  });

  tracking.track('#img', tracker);

  window.plot = function(x, y, w, h, color) {
    console.log('found ',color,' at ',x,y,w,h) // these results would be used in node.js
    var rect = document.createElement('div');
    document.getElementById('bdy').appendChild(rect);
    rect.classList.add('rect');
    rect.style.border = '2px solid ' + color;
    rect.style.width = w + 'px';
    rect.style.height = h + 'px';
    rect.style.left = (img.offsetLeft + x) + 'px';
    rect.style.top = (img.offsetTop + y) + 'px';
  };
};

<p>As I understand they present a gulp test that works in the repo, but i can't find a proper module anywhere.</p>

<p>Is there an elegant alternative way to make tracking.js run on node.js? </p>

<p>Some of these seeding operations need to import a lot of data, so for a couple of tables, we use actual SQL files with INSERT statements. For some of those insert statements, foreign keys must be diabled then re-enabled:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE [Schema].[TableName] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT [TableName_FkPropertyName]
-- perform a block of inserts
ALTER TABLE [Schema].[TableName] CHECK CONSTRAINT [TableName_FkPropertyName]
</code></pre>

<p>I just updated from EF 4.2 to EF 4.3 and noticed that these no longer work. An examination of the db created by EF shows that the FK's are now named differently:</p>

<pre><code>FK_CodeFolder1.Table1Name_CodeFolder2.Table2Name_DbFkColumnName
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to remove this naming convention and go back to the original? If not, how is this not a <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2012/02/09/ef-4-3-released.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">known issue or breaking change</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Update after Ladislav's Reply</strong></p>

<p>Ladislav is right, my above explanation of the new naming pattern was not quite right. I have updated it. The part preceding the . was not the full namespace, but it was the name of a folder in the entity model project. So if I had an entity WidgetAbc in folder AggregateSet1, the fk pattern fragment would be <code>AggregateSet1.WidgetAbc</code>, not just <code>WidgetAbc</code>.</p>

<p>Any ideas what is going wrong?</p>

<p>I call read function to get all the data in the database and store them in the NSMutableArray siteTableObjectsArray.</p>

<pre><code> dispatch_async(backgroundQueue, ^(void){
    [self read:^(BOOL finished) {
        if(finished){
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{

                siteTableObjectsFinalArray = [siteTableObjectsFinalArray sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:sortDescriptors];
                [self.tableView reloadData];
            });

        }
    }];
});
</code></pre>

<p>I copy this array into another NSArray, ( i use two arrays for another reason) and use this array to populate the table as follows:</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath{
WorkCell *cell = (WorkCell *) [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@""WorkCell""];

SiteTableObject *obj = [siteTableObjectsFinalArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
Authors *currAuth = obj.author;
Works *currentWork = obj.work;

cell.authorLabel.text = currAuth.authorName;
cell.workLabel.text = currentWork.title;
NSString* cleanedString = [obj.text stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet: [NSCharacterSet symbolCharacterSet]];
cell.textLabel.text = cleanedString;


cell.caategoryLabel.text = [categoriesDictionary objectForKey:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@"",currentWork.categoryID]];
cell.dateLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@"", currentWork.date];
cell.moreLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%i more"",obj.more];
return  cell;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<pre><code>-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willDisplayCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath{
cell.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<pre><code>-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath{
WorkCell *cell = (WorkCell *) [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
currentIndexRow =indexPath.row;
SiteTableObject *clickedObject = [siteTableObjectsFinalArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
Works *clickedWork = clickedObject.work;
selectedWorkId = [clickedWork.workID intValue];
if ([cell.moreLabel.text isEqualToString:@""0 more""]) {
    [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@""p"" sender:self];
}else{
    [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@""more"" sender:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>and then every time I call reloadData it comes to the same result either i have changed the siteTableObjectsFinalArray or not!</p>

<p>After digging in the code i found a notification in WorkCell.h:
""Auto property synthesis will not synthesize property 'textLabel' because it is 'readwrite' but it will be synthesized 'readonly' via another property.""</p>

I managed to do it <em>once</em> so that it would work but every other time since then it has failed so I know I must be missing an obvious step.</p>

<p>What I currently do is create a new view based application in xcode4, I then add a new target (Numbers), to Numbers I add a source file called File.c and its content is:</p>

<pre><code>static int Get10()
{
    return 10;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I compile it (making sure I've selected Numbers |iPhone 4.3 Simulator in the build scheme drop down).</p>

<p>But when I run otool -S on libNumbers.a I get no results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>size of ranlib structures: 0 (number 0) object offset  string index</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know there should be some stuff there because if I run otool -S on the correctly built libNumbers.a I get some numbers instead of 0s:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I really don't know what I'm doing wrong exactly, I've tried backtracing what I did with the succesful lib compile I made but haven't really found anything to indicate why the functions compiled with that one but not these.</p>

{
    return Task.Run(() =&gt;
    {

    Task&lt;int&gt; t = wrap();
    Console.WriteLine(t.Result);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The form loses response. If I use await, it works as expected.</p>

<p><strong>Update1:</strong> 
These two answers are both correct, but I can only mark one as answer. Based on the understanding of this question, I did further test. I used ConfigureAwait in wrap method to 
leave the continuation to run in thread other than UI:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;int&gt; wrap()
{
    return await test(5).ConfigureAwait(false);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine. And then I tested this:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;int&gt; wrap()
{
    int i = await test(5).ConfigureAwait(false);
    int j = i + await test(3);
    return j;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's working on the first time when I clicked the button, but deadlock again on second click. If I added ConfigureAwait(false) after test(3), like this:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;int&gt; wrap()
{
    int i = await test(5).ConfigureAwait(false);
    int j = i + await test(3).ConfigureAwait(false);
    return j;
}
</code></pre>

<p>it's working again, but this doesn't make sense to me. Because of   the first ConfigureAwait(false), all the following synchronization part in wrap() should be run on non-UI thread. I don't understand why the second ConfigureAwait(false) is necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Update2:</strong></p>

<pre><code>private Task&lt;int&gt; test(int n)
{
    return Task.Run(() =&gt;
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""test("" + n + ""): "" + System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        return n;
    });
}

public async Task&lt;int&gt; wrap()
{
    Console.WriteLine(""1.wrap(): "" + System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
    int i = await test(5).ConfigureAwait(false);
    Console.WriteLine(""2.wrap(): "" + System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
    int j = i + await test(3);
    Console.WriteLine(""3.wrap(): "" + System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
    return j;
}

private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    try
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""1.button1_Click(): "" + System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        var t = wrap();
        Console.WriteLine(""2.button1_Click(): "" + System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);

        Console.WriteLine(t.Result);    
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }    
}
</code></pre>

<p>After several click, the form is freezing, and the output is:</p>

<pre><code>1.button1_Click(): 8
1.wrap(): 8 
test(5): 13
2.wrap(): 8
2.button1_Click(): 8 
test(3): 13
</code></pre>

<p>To my surprise, ""2.wrap():"" is running in the same thread with ""1.wrap():"", rather than ""test(5)"". It seems that the code after the ConfigureAwait(false) can also jump back to UI　ｔｈｒｅａｄ．</p>

<p>After a couple of hours of inactivity, reading from the database causes a <strong>java.net.SocketException: Connection timed out</strong>. Based on others suggests on solving this problem, I update the dataSource with properties to keep db connections alive. Here are a couple of solutions I looked at -</p>

<p><a href=""http://java.dzone.com/news/database-connection-pooling"" rel=""nofollow"">One solution</a><br>
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2740987/mysql-connection-timeout-issue-grails-application-on-tomcat-using-hibernate-an"">Another solution</a></p>

<p>It appears the solution involves setting the appropriate values on the datasource. In my case, 2 datasources are involved. I'm trying to do a session keep-alive, to avoid the connection timeout. This appears to be accomplished by setting the validationQuery property and the testXXX properties. When a test is needed the validation query is run. I thought the below configuration would give me the desired results, but I'm still seeing the timeout. I cranked up the debugging </p>

<pre><code>debug 'org.hibernate'
debug 'jdbc.sqlonly'
</code></pre>

<p>I would have expected to see the validationQuery run at some interval. Based on the ""6000"" ms value that was specified, I expected to see the validationQuery every 6 seconds. Here's the datasource specification. I tried this two ways. Specifying them within the ""properties"" closure and specifying them at the same level as ""pooled"".</p>

<pre><code>dataSource_secondary {
    logSql = true
    pooled = true
    properties {
        maxActive = 5
        maxIdle = 5
        minIdle = 3
        initialSize = 5
        minEvictableIdleTimeMillis = 6000
        timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis = 6000
        maxWait = 1000
        testOnBorrow = true
        testWhileIdle = true
        testOnReturn = false
        validationQuery = ""select 1 from dual""
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also ran this in the debugger and added some code to BootStrap.groovy to get the context.</p>

<pre><code>def ctx = servletContext.getAttribute(ApplicationAttributes.APPLICATION_CONTEXT)
println 'Added a println allowing me to set a break point and inspect the context.'
</code></pre>

<p>""ctx"" did have the expected values as specified in dataSource_secondary. Any ideas why I'm still getting the socket exception?</p>

<p>I am trying to fix the issue where images taken in potrait, are uploaded with a -90 degree rotate. I tried numerous switch statements which were not working, so decided to return the exif data in my JSON return.</p>

<p>The issue i see is that their is no orientation in the exif data.</p>

<p>I am doing so:</p>

<pre><code>$imagefile = $fileToUpload[""tmp_name""];

$exif = exif_read_data($imagefile);
$moveUploadedFile = imagejpeg($destinationImage, $this-&gt;uploadDir . ""/"" . $newFileName, 100);
imagedestroy($destinationImage);

if ($moveUploadedFile) {
  $return['ort'] = $exif;
  echo json_encode($return);

<pre><code>    if (!empty($exif['Orientation'])){
        //get the orientation
        $ort = $exif['Orientation'];
        //determine what oreientation the image was taken at
        switch($ort){
            case 2: // horizontal flip
                break;
            case 3: // 180 rotate left
                $destinationImage = imagerotate($destinationImage, 180, -1);
                break;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Any help?</p>

<p>EDIT: After downloaded an image that had been uploaded and checking its properties it appears that all exif data was removed in the upload process. </p>

<p>This still baffles me as to why it is rotated before / during upload / how to fix this.</p>

<p>I passed in the recordset variable as a readonly variable, when i try to foreach the variable to get to each row i cannot do it because the variable doesn't define a get enumerator method. </p>

                        blank=True, null=True, validators= [ip_validator])

<p>And i defined the ip_validator method in utils.py:</p>

<pre><code> from netaddr import * 
 def ip_validator(value):
 try:
     ip_version = IPAddress(value).version()
     if ip_version !=6:
         raise ValidationError(u'%s Not a  IPv6 address' % value)
 except ValueError:
     raise ValidationError(u'%s Not a IPv6 address' % value)
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine but i have to written the same method for IPv4 validation. It seems to be redundancy and not a good idea. Would it be possible to write generic method for both IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

<p>I found a following sample to do it but not able to understand How it is passing the parameter to validator:</p>

<pre><code> #!/usr/bin/env python

 class IPAddress(object):
     def __init__(self, version):
         self.version = version

 def validator_factory(ip_version):
     def validate_ip_address(ip_address):
         if ip_address.version != ip_version:
             print ""Invalid! :(""
         else:
             print ""Valid! :D""
     return validate_ip_address

 ipv4_validator = validator_factory(4)
 ipv6_validator = validator_factory(6)

 ipv4_address = IPAddress(4)
 ipv6_address = IPAddress(6)

 ipv4_validator(ipv4_address)
 ipv4_validator(ipv6_address)
 ipv6_validator(ipv6_address)
</code></pre>

<p>If it is doing in this way then what we have to pass in the <code>validator = []</code></p>

<p><b>UPDATED!</b>
in models.py:</p>

<pre><code> class Host():
     ipv4 = models.CharField(max_length=39,verbose_name=_(""IPv4 address""),
                        validators=[validator_factory(4)])
</code></pre>

<p>is this the right way to call validators?
and in utils.py:</p>

<pre><code>from netaddr import *

def validator_factory(ip_version):
    def validate_ip_address(ipv4):
        if IPAddress(ipv4).version != ip_version:
           print ""Invalid! :(""
        else:
           print ""Valid! :D""
    return validate_ip_address

<p>If I load the view for the first time, the markers are being created. However, the second time with a new set/array of lat/long coordinates does not load.</p>

<p>The loadview method is being called, and the [mapView clear]; should be called, but it isn't clearing the markers on the mapview. The next problem is that the new markers are not being created, but I suspect that both these problems have to do with the same thing. </p>

<p>Any tips on why the map view won't clear? Thanks in advance</p>

"16785826","1","","","2013-05-28 07:08:25","","6","1139","<p>It has been said that Scala For comprehensions are actually quite slow. The reason I was given was that due to a Java limitation, for comprehensions (such as ""reduce"", used below) need to generate a temporary object with each iteration in order to call the function passed in.</p>

<p>IS...THIS...TRUE? The tests below seem to bear this out, but I do not completely understand why this is the case.</p>

<p>This might make sense for ""lambdas"" or anonymous functions, but not for non-anonymous functions.</p>

<p>In my test, I ran for loops against list.reduce (see code below), and found them to be over twice as fast, even when each iteration called the exact same function that was passed to reduce!</p>

<p>I find this amazingly counter-intuitive (once would think that the Scala library would've been carefully created to be as optimal as possible).</p>

<p>In a test I put together, I ran the same loop (sum up the numbers 1 to a million, irrespective of overflow) five different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>for loop over the array of values</li>
<li>for loop, but calling a function instead of inline arithmetic</li>
<li>for loop, creating an object that contains an addition function</li>
<li>list.reduce, passing i an anonymous function</li>
<li>list.reduce, passing in an object member function</li>
</ol>

<p>Results were as follows:
test: min/max/average (milliseconds)</p>

<pre><code>1. 27/157/64.78
2. 27/192/65.77 &lt;--- note the similarity between tests 1,2 and 4,5
3. 139/313/202.58
4. 63/342/150.18
5. 63/341/149.99
</code></pre>

<p>As can be seen, the ""for comprehension"" versions are on the order of ""for with new for each instance"", implying that a ""new"" may in fact be performed for both the anonymous and non-anonymous function versions.</p>

<p>Methodology: code below (test call removed) was compiled into a single .jar file to ensure all versions ran the same library code. Each test in each iteration was called in a new JVM (i.e. scala -cp ... for each test) in order to remove heap size issues.</p>

<pre><code>class t(val i: Int) {
    def summit(j: Int) = j + i
}

object bar {
    val biglist:List[Int]  =  (1 to 1000000).toList

    def summit(i: Int, j:Int) = i+j

    // Simple for loop
    def forloop:  Int = {
        var result: Int = 0
        for(i &lt;- biglist) {
            result += i
        }
        result
    }

    // For loop with a function instead of inline math
    def forloop2:  Int = {
        var result: Int = 0
        for(i &lt;- biglist) {
            result = summit(result,i)
        }
        result
    }

    // for loop with a generated object PER iteration
    def forloop3: Int = {
        var result: Int = 0
        for(i &lt;- biglist) {
            val t = new t(result)
            result = t.summit(i)

    }

    // list.reduce with a named function
    def realfunc: Int = {

The game is a labyrinth style game, there are balls that roll around on the device using the accelerometer.  When balls hit the border, or one another a sound is played.  The volume is set based on the linear velocity of the collision.  The problem is, when the balls get really close to the border, they bounce many times in a small period of time.  This ends up bogging down the main thread, and the UI starts to stutter.  In log-cat it says ""reducing sample rate"" or something like that, because it can't handle the load.  Also, when there are a bunch of collisions, the sounds keep playing after there aren't anymore collisions.  </p>

<p>I need each of the sounds to be played independently of the other sounds.  I was thinking, maybe creating a separate thread for the sounds.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

I've made some extensive updates to uiMap -> icMap; most notably I moved directive logic out of the controllers, making uiMap the ""master"" directive). I've got almost everything working, except that clicking a native MapMarker doesn't open the infobox.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> the reason is that I'm not properly binding the click event to the native MapMarker (<em>ic-map.js:163</em>).</p>

<p>Before I re-organised uiMap I had simply added a <code>icMapInfoBox</code> directive in <em>map.js</em>. Its <em>open</em> event was registered/triggered by:</p>

<pre><code>ui-event=""{'map-click':'openMarkerInfo(marker)'}""
</code></pre>

<p>which called <em>openMarkerInfo()</em> defined in its controller (copy/paste from my repo: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/jshado1/5422931"" rel=""nofollow"">GitHub Gist</a>).</p>

<p>However, now when I click a native MapMarker, nothing happens and I get no errors in the console (but all other events still fire properly).</p>

<strong>Simplified <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/1VWU6T3botHVvV6ExwdO?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"">Plunk</a></strong> (removed MarkerClusters)<br />
In both plunks, the problem probably lies in ic-map.js (first file in the list)</p>

<p><em>map.json</em> is a data file<br />
<em>angular.js</em>, <em>angular-ui.js</em>, and <em>infobox.js</em> are lib files</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> I noticed that <code>InfoBox.map</code> is <code>undefined</code>; I'm guessing that has something to do with the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> The undefined InfoBox.map property was part of the problem: The manual call to <em>InfoBox.open</em> on <em>ic-map.js:189</em> works (template isn't being compiled, but that's a different problem), but the click event still doesn't trigger <em>InfoBox.open</em>. Also the template is not getting included.</p>

<p>SOLVED: I had been treating <code>marker</code> a DOM object instead of just a js object. Will post solution soon.</p>

<p>I am trying to put two plots produced with <code>ggplot</code> on the same page, top and bottom, so that their widths are the same. The data is from the same time series, x axis being time, so it is important that data points with the same time are not shifted horizontally with respect to each other. I tried <code>grid.arrange</code> from package gridExtra:</p>

<pre><code>grid.arrange(p1, p2)
</code></pre>

<p>but the plots have different widths due to different widths of y axis labels. I looked at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11606441/ggplot2-gridextra-how-to-ensure-geom-bar-in-different-size-plot-grobs-result"">this post</a> that deals with similar problem, but I could not apply that information to solve my problem.</p>

<p>What I've done is called the <code>imgLoading.Visibility = Visibility.Visible</code> before creating a task, and then creating the task. Once the task is complete, I then call <code>imgLoading.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;</code>.</p>

<p>For some reason, the image never collapses and stays visible indefinitely. It is a very strange issue which is quite easy to recreate. This is all the code which I've got, and I really can't see what I've done wrong:</p>

<pre><code>imgLoading.Visibility = Visibility.Visible;

<p>As Cuda is actually operating on two computers, it is invalid to point to a host's memory when you are on device, which means you cannot copy structs (or objects) to device if they have pointer members.</p>

<p>I tried to make the following system to solve this issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>use integers instead of pointers. The integer is an offset inside a memory pool. The integer is wrapped in a class (overloads ""->"" and ""*"") to make it looks like a pointer.</li>
<li>the memory pool object manages a continuous array of objects, which can be easily transferred to Cuda device. The pool's content synchronizes between host and device, so an integer offset would have same meaning on both two sides.</li>
</ol>

<p>To conveniently use the offset, it should be wrapped. In host side, the wrapper looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
class MemPoolPointer {
public:
    inline T* operator -&gt; () const
    {
        return &amp;( MemPool&lt;T&gt;::get_instance.get_object(_p) );
    }
    uint64_t _p;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can see, the pointer class requires globally access of the memory pool. This is usually implemented by make the memory pool to be singleton. However, Cuda do not allow static members, and it limits __device__ variables to be file scope. How can I workaround these limitations? Or I should try OpenCL?</p>

<p>===================================
Finally it is solved. I can wrap a global parameter using a static class method like this:</p>

<pre><code>class FooBar;
__device__ FooBar* FOOBAR_DEVICE_POOL;
class FooBar
{
    __device__ static FooBar&amp; DEVICE_GET(uint64_t p);
}

template&lt;typename T&gt;
class MemPoolPointer {
public:
    inline T* operator -&gt; () const
    {
#ifdef __CUDA_ARCH__
        return &amp;( T::DEVICE_GET(_p) );
#else
        return &amp;( MemPool&lt;T&gt;::get_instance.get_object(_p) );
#endif
    }
    uint64_t _p;
}

<p>I need my query to populate a column if the record contains the first occurrence of a value.</p>

<p>The table my query returns is huge so I'll just use pretend columns to get my point across. My query currently returns a table that looks like this</p>

<pre><code>| ROW | ItemNumber | DateOpen | Status |
|  1  |      10045 | 5/5/2005 |   Open |
|  2  |      10045 | 5/5/2005 |   Open |

|  5  |      10046 | 5/5/2005 |   Open |
</code></pre>

<p>I've already added the row indicator in to the query thinking it would help identify the first occurrence of an ItemNumber. I need to have a new column that marks an X if the record is the first occurrence.</p>

<p>I have this so far</p>

<pre><code>    DECLARE @ItemData Table(itemRow BIGINT, itemNumber BIGINT, DateOpen VARCHAR(15), status VARCHAR(15))
INSERT INTO @ItemData (itemRow, ItemNumber, DateOpen, Status)
SELECT Row_Number() OVER(ORDER BY Cm_ItemNumber) AS 'ROW'
       ,Cm_ItemNumber                            AS ItemNumber
       ,Dates_DateOpen                           AS DateOpen

FROM db_Items
JOIN db_Dates ON Dates_Item = Cm_ItemID
JOIN db_Status ON St_ID = Cm_StatusID
Select * from @ItemData
</code></pre>

<p>The reason its thrown into a table then selected seperately is because there's actually a union and a lot more stuff in the query and when I realized I needed to do a unique checker and add it to a column, I figured the easiest way would be an ""after the fact"" type thing and it would go into the     <code>Select * from @ItemData</code> portion.</p>

This function only allows to specify the query points but not the 'ConnectivityList' because internally it performs its own Delaunay triangulation from the specified point set. However, I perfectly know not only the points but also the 'ConnectivityList', so I can create a Matlab 'triangulation representation' using ""triangulation"".</p>

<p>So my question is the following. Is there any way to give a predefined 'triangulation' to ""scatteredInterpolant""?

I essentially need to be left with only the coupons redeemed for each campaign and if the UPC overlaps two campaigns it will be counted for both (but not counted twice within one campaign).  Here's an idea of the redemtion table</p>

<pre><code>| customer_id | UPC  | redeem_date_id |
|-------------|------|----------------|
|     1234    | 3456 |       42       |
|     1234    | 3456 |       43       |

|     1234    | 3456 |       49       |
</code></pre>

<p>and the table with the coupons allocated looks like </p>

<pre><code> | customer_id | campaign_id | UPC  | print_date_id | expire_date_id |
 |-------------|-------------|------|---------------|----------------|
 |    1234     |      1      | 3456 |      35       |       45       |

</code></pre>

<p>In this example the customer has more redemptions than allocated coupons (because they could've clipped a coupon somewhere etc..) but they could also have more allocated coupons than redemptions.</p>

<p>Obviously if I do a </p>

<pre><code>where a.customer_id = b.customer_id and a.upc=b.upc and 
redeem_date_id between print_date_id and expire_date_id
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to get way more records back than I need. I don't want the same redemption counted more than once for each campaign, and I don't want more coupons back than I originally had. The exception is, the same redemption can be counted for different campaigns just not within one campaign. (so if the redemption table only had the first observation I would want the output table to have two redemptions - one for either coupon in campaign 1 -- I don't care which -- and one for campaign 2.)</p>

<p>It's really an allocation problem - within a campaign I want to look in the redemption table for a match - join it - then look for a match for the next observation (without reusing the first matching redemption). So one of many possible ways the output table could look is:</p>

<pre><code>| customer_id |campaign_id|UPC |print_date_id|expire_date_id|redeem_date_id|
|-------------|-----------|----|-------------|--------------|--------------|

<p>My guess: passing a reference to the array to is_array() causes the whole array to be copied, slowing the process down.</p>

My code works how I want it to, although I don't know if I did it correctly.  Just something about it is screaming to me although it works, I didn't do it properly.  So I figured I would share what I have and see what you guys had to offer as a better way to accomplish this.</p>

<p>The Jquery I came up with is</p>

<pre><code>$(window).load(function() {
$("".overlay"").animate({
    opacity: .5,
    height: ""0""
}, 1000, function() {
    $(this).remove()
})
});
$(function() {
setTimeout(function() {
    $("".somediv"").animate({
        opacity: 1
    }, 600)
}, 600)
})

<p>I have ran it though a js compressor which removed the ;'s, and then through a ""beautifier"" for readability, but it still seems to work and really I'm not even too sure how important those are in js lol, I'm a CSS guy and i know in CSS the last ; is not required... so figured I'd leave them out since it's working.</p>

<p>I set up an example of this in action <a href=""http://jsbin.com/gixovoqo/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">Here: JSBin</a></p>

<p>so if anyone has any suggestions on my code as this being my first real attempt at JQuery I would love some feedback =)</p>

Now, if I may, I have some additional general questions about some languages, because for novice like me, it seems a bit confusing. To be exact I want to ask more about language functions capabilities than syntax and so.</p>

<p>To be honest, its just these special functions that bothers me and make me so confused. For example, C has its printf(), Pascal has writeln() and so. I know in basic the output in assembler of these functions would be similar, every language has more or less its special functions. For console output, for file manipulation, etc. But all these functions are de-facto part of its OS API, so why is for example in C distinguished between C standard library functions and (on Windows) WinAPI functions when even printf() has to use some Windows feature, call some of its function to actually show desired text on console window, becouse the actual ""showing"" is done by OS. Where is the line between language functions and system API? </p>

<p>Now languages I don't quite understand - Python, Ruby and similar. To be more specific, I know they are similar to java and C# in term they are compiled into bytecode. But, I do not unerstand what are its capabilities in term of building GUI applications. I saw tutorial for using Ruby to program GUI applications on Linux and Windows. But isn´t that just some kind of upgrade? I mean fram other tutorials It seemed like these languages was first intended for small scripts than building big applications. </p>

<p>I hope you understand why I am confused. If you do, please help me sort it out a bit, I have no one to ask.</p>

With the help of many stackoverflow users I was eventually able to find code that looks very promising. Here it is:</p>

<pre><code>import zipfile
import os
import tempfile
import shutil

def getXml(docxFilename):
    zip = zipfile.ZipFile(open(docxFilename,""rb""))
    xmlString= zip.read(""word/document.xml"").decode(""utf-8"")
    return xmlString

def createNewDocx(originalDocx,xmlString,newFilename):
    tmpDir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    zip = zipfile.ZipFile(open(originalDocx,""rb""))
    zip.extractall(tmpDir)
    with open(os.path.join(tmpDir,""word/document.xml""),""w"") as f:
        f.write(xmlString)
    filenames = zip.namelist()
    zipCopyFilename = newFilename
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zipCopyFilename,""w"") as docx:
        for filename in filenames:
            docx.write(os.path.join(tmpDir,filename),filename)
    shutil.rmtree(tmpDir)
</code></pre>

<p><code>getXml</code> extracts the XML from <code>docxFilename</code> as a string. <code>createNewDocx</code> takes the original Word document and replaces its XML with <code>xmlString</code>, which is a modified version of the original XML, and saves the resulting Word document as <code>newFilename</code>.</p>

<p>To check that the script works as intended, I first created a test document (""test.docx"") and ran <code>createNewDocx(""test.docx"",getXml(""test.docx""),""test2.docx"")</code>. If everything worked as intended, this was supposed to create an identical copy of test.docx saved as test2.docx. Indeed, that was the case.</p>

<p>I then made the test document more elaborate and experimented with modifying it. And the script still worked!</p>

<p>I then confidently applied my script to the Word document I was actually interested in modifying: <code>template.docx</code>. I ran <code>createNewDocx(""template.docx"",getXml(""template.docx""),""template2.docx"")</code>, expecting that the script would generate an identical copy of template.docx but named template2.docx. Unfortunately, the new Word document was not able to open; apparently there was an illegal character in the XML.</p>

<p>I really don't understand why my code would work for my test document but not for my actual document. I would post template.docx's XML but it contains personal information. One important difference between test.docx and template.docx is that template.docx is written in French, and therefore contains special characters like accents, and also the apostrophes look different. I have no idea if this is what's causing my trouble but I have no other ideas.</p>

<p>Here is my controller action:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpGet]
[OutputCache(Duration = CACHE_DURATION, VaryByCustom = ""$LanguageCode;myParam"", Location = OutputCacheLocation.Server)]
public JsonResult MyAction(string myParam)
{
    // this is called also if should be cached!
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the GetVaryByCustomString in the Global.asax:</p>

<pre><code>public override string GetVaryByCustomString(HttpContext context, string arg)
{
    var pars = arg.Split(';');
    if (pars.Length == 0) return string.Empty;

    var res = new System.Text.StringBuilder();
    foreach (var s in pars)
    {
        switch (s)
        {
            case ""$LanguageCode"":
                var culture = CultureManager.GetCurrentCulture();
                res.Append(culture.Name);
                break;
            default:
                var par = context.Request[s];
                if (par != null)
                    res.AppendFormat(par);
                break;
        }
    }
    return base.GetVaryByCustomString(context, res.ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method is always called and returns the right value (e.g. <code>""it123""</code>).</p>

<p>If I call the action with the only <code>myParam</code> parameter, the cache works correctly.</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:1592/MyController/MyAction?myParam=123 // called multiple times always read from cache
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I call the action with another parameter, not included in the <code>VaryByCustom</code> string, the controller action is called anyway, also if is should be cached and the <code>GetVaryByCustomString</code> returns the same result.</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:1592/MyController/MyAction?myParam=123&amp;dummy=asdf // called multiple times with different 'dummy' values always calls the action
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>This is working well. However if the result is less than 2 decimal places it shows only 1 digit. This is the most basic example but I have results that could either be a whole number or 10 decimal places. I want them all to show as <strong><code>.xx</code></strong></p>

<p>How do I get the results to always display 2 decimal places regardless of the number of digits after decimal point ?</p>

<p><strong>E.g:</strong>  <code>1.1 =&gt; 1.10</code></p>

<p>I have searched extensively but the answer eludes me.
This is the code that I have tried so far : </p>

<pre><code>@IBOutlet var odds: UITextField!
@IBOutlet var oddsLabel: UILabel!
var enteredOdds = NSString(string: odds.text).doubleValue
var numberOfPlaces = 2.0
var multiplier = pow(10.0, numberOfPlaces)
var enteredOddsRounded = round(enteredOdds * multiplier) / multiplier          
oddsLabel.text = ""\(enteredOddsRounded)""
println(""\(enteredOddsRounded)"")
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for the comments. I have amended as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@IBOutlet var odds: UITextField!
@IBOutlet var oddsLabel: UILabel!
var enteredOdds = NSString(string: odds.text).doubleValue

let formatter = NSNumberFormatter()
formatter.numberStyle = NSNumberFormatterStyle.CurrencyStyle

for identifier in [""en_UK"", ""eu_US""] {
    formatter.locale = NSLocale(localeIdentifier: identifier)
    formatter.minimumFractionDigits = 2
    formatter.maximumFractionDigits = 2
}

oddsLabel.text = formatter.stringFromNumber(enteredOdds)
</code></pre>

<p>It allowed me to lose a lot of code as it does the rounding and decimal places for me while also including currency as a bonus.</p>

<p>Thile this has worked for all the fields where I actually did need currency to be displayed, The above value 'oddsLabel.text' is not actually currency and so only resolved the rounding and decimal places.</p>

<p>How do I amend the above so it can take into account fields with and/or without currency. Hopefully without having re replicate the code again?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>constant scanning from a master. The central device scans the target device every x minutes. When the target is into range, it gives back MAC bluetooth address and RSSI. The negative side is that being constantly into discoverable mode drains the battery, so does the master device that has to be constantly scanning for devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Paired and connected. As some product details: ""Your laptop locks itself down when you step a certain distance away, and opens again once you're in range"". It means that after paring and connected processes, the master can have information when the slave device is out of range, or get inside range again. In bluetooth 4, is going to be even as a profile.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding to the second option, which feature is this? how it works? i mean, maybe you can code a sequence number counter that counts everytime the slave sends a packet through RFCOMM every x milisecs (android or ios), but what i dont understand is how a slave can connect to master again in a transparent way, when normally two bluetooth devices disconnect when they are out of range each other (so you cant send information again from the same bluetooth socket RFCOMM connection).</p>

I managed to detect the installation of the app by making a BroadcastReceiver and activating it inside the AndroidManifest file but this will detect even if my app is closed.
So that is why I need to manually activate and deactivate the broadcastreveiver. To do this I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>br = new BroadcastReceiver() {

        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            Log.i(""Enter"", ""Enters here"");
            Toast.makeText(context, ""App Installed!!!!."", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
    };
    IntentFilter intentFilter = new IntentFilter();
    intentFilter.addAction(Intent.ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED);
    intentFilter.addAction(Intent.ACTION_PACKAGE_INSTALL);
    registerReceiver(br, intentFilter);
</code></pre>

<p>This should make a toast when a new app is installed. But sadly it does not. It does not enter in the onReceive method. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>My model contains various fields that are Strings, Numbers and Boolean values.</p>

<p>$text seems like it can only take in strings.</p>

<p>What if I wanted to do a search like:</p>

<pre><code>model.find({petsAllowed:true, rooms:4, house:""townhouse""}).sort()
</code></pre>

<p>So have it search for all the different entries in mongodb that match with what I'm inputting in AND sort it based on how close the entry is to the inputted fields.</p>

<p>I know mongoose supports this so I don't want to rely on a plugin.</p>

<p>Here's the result I want:</p>

<pre><code>[ 
Document 1 (most closely matched with the input): 
    {petsAllowed:true, rooms:4, house:""townhouse""},
Document 2: {petsAllowed:false, rooms:4, house:""townhouse""},
Document 3: {petsAllowed:true, rooms:5, house:""townhouse""},

<pre><code>bool IsRoot { get { return parent==null; } }
</code></pre>

<p>that I call over and over many times from other properties and methods within the class (and derived classes)</p>

<p>I like to keep it like this because it makes the code readable (to me), but I am afraid that all the <code>IsRoot</code> calls are going to slow me down as they might not be ""inlined"" in the final release code. What I mean by ""inlined"" is that they are replaced by a copy of the <code>parent==null</code> evaluation in place of <code>get_IsRoot()</code>.</p>

<p>Can someone explain to me when (or if) properties are inlined in C#, and for performance oriented applications are properties to be avoided, or not?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT_1</strong>: 
  Short answer is: Properties translate to pure function calls and they might, or might not be inlined depending on what JIT decides. Trust the system to make the right choices and don't worry about things that might affect things in the 5%-10% level, unless a profiler is used and the end result is fine tuned for performance.</p>

<p>Thanks for the links SO community, and I hope there was a way to award multiple correct answers. Sorry I had to pick one.</p>

I know I need to use:</p>

pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;myLock1);
(some global variable) = ....;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;myLock1);

<pre><code>pthread_create(&amp;minThread, NULL, (void *) mini, (void *) numbers);
pthread_join(minThread, (void *) &amp;min);


void *mini(void *numbs1)
{
    int *numbers = (int *) numbs1;
    min = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *min = (numbers[0]);

<p>I am now supposed to incorporate the use of another thread (disThread) to display the variable I have computed in minThread (min) and other similar threads that have done computations using those mutex system calls I have specified. How can I set this up correctly? Any tips are appreciated to further my understanding.</p>

I have a method that does this which I've used with previous problems and it works fine. However this time it keeps generating an invalid zip and when I open the zip it only has 1 picture inside with a size of 0. 
I can't seems to figure out why though. This is the method:</p>

<pre><code>      //generate the zip file for the picture

      String srcDir = context.getExternalFilesDir(null) + ""/ArcFlash/CheckListMedia"";

      ZipOutputStream zos = new ZipOutputStream(fos);

      File srcFile = new File(srcDir);

      addDirToArchive(zos, srcFile, context);
</code></pre>

<p>here is my <code>addDirToArchive</code> method which generates the zip:</p>

<pre><code>private static void addDirToArchive(ZipOutputStream zos, File srcFile, Context ctx)
{
    File[] files = srcFile.listFiles();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++)

        }
        try
        {
            System.out.println(""tAdding file: "" + files[i].getName());

            // create byte buffer
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];//2048

            FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(files[i]);

            String target = ctx.getExternalFilesDir(null) + ""/"";
            String oldPath = files[i].getPath();

            while ((length = fis.read(buffer)) &gt; 0)
            {
                zos.write(buffer, 0, length);
            }

            zos.closeEntry();

<p>CPU: Intel i7-2860WM
,8G RAM</p>

<p>I am using an image created with WinImage of a Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit machine.</p>

<p>I am able to create a virtual machine and run it successfully using the ""virt-manager"" tool. In order for the image to run correctly I must specify the disk bus type as SATA, otherwise when the virtual machine tries to boot I receive a BSOD with an error code of 0x0000007B which pertains to errors initializing the hard disk.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to create/start this virtual machine from the cmd line using kvm instead of using the virt-manager utility. However when I try the following:</p>

<pre><code>sudo kvm -hda Win7.vhd
</code></pre>

<p>The machine boots and immediately goes to a BSOD with an error code of 0x0000007B. I need a way from the command line to specify the virtual machine to use a SATA bus. Or so I need to create a virtual SATA bus and have it boot from the Win7.vhd image? Basically I need to be able to specify SATA as the bus option from the command line, but I have not had any luck with this. Any and all thoughts are appreciated!</p>

<p>The idea is to restore 2 JEDI VCS backups (2 database backups), and remove the projects of the other customer. Now it is not possible to really remove a project from JEDI because of referencial integrity as described in <a href=""http://jedivcs.sourceforge.net/jvcsfaq/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=15&amp;id=48&amp;artlang=en&amp;highlight=remove"" rel=""nofollow"">this article in JEDI VCS FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>So since deleting is not possible I had the idea of writing NULL in the blob fields where the source files are kept. In this way if customer 1 tries to restore customer 2 projects he will simply get the file list and then probably an error on reading the files. If I can set NULL to the tables the dpr dfm pas files will not be really there in the db anymore.</p>

<p>The problem that I am having, is that when a user searches a string with two or more possible results. It seems  as though only the last result is displayed. And not all of the possible results, each in their own containing div. I know for a fact that there are more results, as there is a line generated that displayed the number of mysql rows returned.</p>

<p>Would anyone have a suggestion, or solution for this problem? I assume that something has been left out, but after many hours of trial and error testing, i have come up with no solid reason as to why this behavior currently exists.</p>

<p>Any help what so ever would be greatly appreciated, thank you!</p>

<p>For reasons of simplification mentioned in the comments here is the additional code on how to test it without the use of a database:</p>

<pre><code>public enum JobStatus {

    ACCEPTED, PROCESSING, FINISHED, ERROR
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Job job = new Job(1, Paths.get(""C:/temp""));
            Job job2 = deepCopy(job);
            System.out.println(job2.getFile());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }

    public static Job deepCopy(Job job) throws Exception {
        // Serialization of object
        ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);
        out.writeObject(job);

        // De-serialization of object
        ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(bos.toByteArray());
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(bis);
        Job copied = (Job) in.readObject();

        return copied;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I just let the program run everything seems fine. The <code>Job</code> gets created and I can work with it. But at some point I wanted to debug the <code>readObject()</code> method in <code>Job</code>. Only in debug mode (in Netbeans) this method throws Exceptions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>java.io.EOFException

    at test.Test.deepCopy(Test.java:40)
    at test.Test.main(Test.java:23)
</code></pre>

<p>This exception is thrown in the <code>readObject()</code> method. If I click very fast I can reach one of the <code>writeInt()</code> methods but then I get an <code>EOFException</code>. Does something manipulate my <code>ObjectInputStream</code>?</p>

<p>I cannot reproduce the same error with the exact same code in Eclipse.</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me what's going wrong here?</p>

<pre><code>    public ActionResult Create()
    {
        return Edit(new Book());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The Edit method uses an EditView ViewModel. I needed to reference an id so I've added an id to the ViewModel, which works great for editing books, but throws an exception when Creating books as of course no id exists for the model at that point.</p>

<p>What I've done is: Copy the properties from the EditView into a CreateView ViewModel, and just have my EditView extend CreateView as:</p>

<pre><code>public class EditView : CreateView
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then replace the reference to the edit method above with a </p>

<pre><code>return Create(new Book());
</code></pre>

<p>And code the create method as per the Edit method but without the reference to the id property, which works but looks ugly due to lots of duplicated code - I now have long Edit and Create methods in my controller which are almost identical bar the id property:</p>

<p>private ActionResult Edit(Book book)
        {
            ....</p>

<pre><code>        return View(""Edit"", new EditView
        {
            Id = book.Id,
            (rest of the object initializer code identical to the Create method)

<p>This just doesn't seem like the way to go - could I perchance get some direction by way of example on this please?</p>

I have full permissions to the mailbox, so it opens alongside mine in Outlook. </p>

<p>I have created a PowerShell script that checks the calendar for new or changed entries, and then sends me an email with the details. Sometimes, it will fail because it can't find the specified folder.</p>

<p>These three lines execute fine:</p>

<pre><code>Add-Type -assembly ""Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook""
$Outlook = New-Object -comobject Outlook.Application
$namespace = $Outlook.GetNameSpace(""MAPI"")
</code></pre>

<p>This is the line that fails intermittently:</p>

<pre><code>$current = $namespace.Folders.Item('Corporate Calendar').Folders.Item('Calendar').Folders.Item('Corp Calendar').Items
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the structure it is digging into: <em>Corporate Calendar Mailbox > Calendar > Corp Calendar</em></p>

<p>Here is the error that PowerShell returns:</p>

<pre><code>Exception calling ""Item"" with ""1"" argument(s): ""The attempted operation failed. An object could not be found."" At C:\Users\aaldrich\desktop\Scripts\Calendar.ps1:72 char:1 
+ $current = $namespace.Folders.Item('Corporate Calendar').Folders.Item('Calendar' ... 
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ 
+ CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : ComMethodTargetInvocation 
</code></pre>

<p>Once when it did this, I dug into the namespace, and it seems to be able to see every mailbox except for the Corporate Calendar mailbox. Restarting Outlook fixes the issue. The next time this happens, I will go in and check again.</p>

<p>I have also implemented a Send/Receive before checking for new items (<code>$namespace.SendAndReceive(1)</code>), but adding that did not change the frequency of the error. The error seems to happen most when the calendar is edited by other people, but that is not very consistent.</p>

<p>Right now the script only sends email to me, and will also send me an email with any errors. Eventually, though, I want it to email everyone automatically.</p>

<p><em>Unimportant Side Note:</em> Some of you may wonder ""Why not just use public folders with the folder assistant?"" Forwarding intact won't work for our Exchange organization (MS has been looking at it for months...). Forwarding as attachment forwards in a way that cannot be viewed from cell phones. Standard forwarding is useless for calendar events.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> 
I just got it to fail again. Unfortunately, I was able to run the failing line again and it worked just fine. That is not what happened before. Could it have these issues if a Send/Receive was going on while I checked for items? I've been giving it 15 seconds to complete the Send/Receive... I'll increase that length.</p>

<p>We have Kaltura CE 6 running on CentOS integrated with Microsoft Azure Media Services.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I regenerated the Media Service Access Keys on a live instance of our Azure Media Services that Azure was hosted on. So far, to reconnect the Azure Storage to the Kaltura instance - we have regenerated the media service keys, regenerated the storage keys, synchronized the storage keys(primary) and have looked into the Storage to confirm all of the media are still in the Storage Account (using the Azure Storage Explorer). All of the media assets are there. </p>

<p>Kaltura still has the ""Thumbnail"" images and meta tags for the media file. The Kaltura Player throws the following error message ""Sorry, clip not found.

I am running a php script from command line that launches a bash script via exec(). In the bash script, I'm creating a process in the background (e.g. <code>sleep 5; echo ""Hello"" &amp;</code>). I am expecting php to launch the bash script and then move on once it's done. However, php seems to be waiting for the background process launched by the bash script to complete before progressing through the rest of the script</p>

<p>To demonstrate, I'll use the following 3 example scripts in a linux shell environment:</p>

<p><strong>runstuff.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

echo ""PHP running stuff.sh..."" . PHP_EOL;
exec('./stuff.sh &amp;');
echo ""PHP done running stuff.sh..."" . PHP_EOL;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>stuff.sh</strong></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo ""stuff.sh running background process...""
# This can be a script or any process placed in the background
./test-script.sh &amp;
echo ""stuff.sh done""
</code></pre>

<p><strong>test-script.sh</strong></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo ""test-script.sh waiting 5 seconds...""
sleep 5
echo ""test-script.sh COMPLETE""
</code></pre>

<p>Now, running <code>php runstuff.php</code> (from the command line) will ""hang"" until test-script.sh completes and then php progresses through the rest of the script. However, running <code>./stuff.sh</code> directly will immediately return to the command line prompt and the output appears 5 seconds later. </p>

<p>Look at the process list when running runstuff.php, I can see that test-script.sh is NOT a child of either runstuff.php or stuff and stuff.sh goes defunct:</p>

<pre><code> 5873 pts/3    Ss     0:01  \_ bash
27389 pts/3    S+     0:00  |   \_ php runstuff.php
27390 pts/3    Z+     0:00  |       \_ [stuff.sh] &lt;defunct&gt;


27392 pts/3    S+     0:00 /bin/bash ./stuff.sh
27393 pts/3    S+     0:00  \_ sleep 5
</code></pre>

<p>When running <code>./stuff.sh</code> directly, stuff.sh looks fine.</p>

<pre><code>27963 pts/3    S      0:00 /bin/bash ./stuff.sh
27965 pts/3    S      0:00  \_ sleep 5
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is this: Why is stuff.sh hanging around when executed through Php exec() when it doesn't hang around when running the script directly? Is Php somehow still recognizing test-script.sh as a child process even though it's detached from stuff.sh?</p>

<p>Also, it seems that modifying stuff.sh to use <code>&amp;&gt; /dev/null &amp;</code> instead of just <code>&amp;</code> seems to work as expected.</p>

<p><strong>modified stuff.sh</strong></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo ""stuff.sh running background process...""
./test-script.sh &amp;&gt; /dev/null &amp;
echo ""stuff.sh done""
</code></pre>

<p>So why does redirecting output to /dev/null produce the expected results?</p>

<p>I'm assuming using HTTPS without a SSL certificate is atleast more secure than doing the exact same connection over plain HTTP, since atleast it's encrypted and an evildoer would have to make a much larger effort to intercept en decrypt the information.</p>

<p>As far as I know an SSL certificate only says ""this trusted third party says the server you connect to is owned by the guys that claim to own it"".

1. joins the CarePlan/Referral tables - creates duplicate careplans if there are multiple referrals for a careplan, or has no referral information at all (left outer join)
2. select the top 1 Referral based on Date, given a CarePlanId</p>

<p>I'd like to combine these 2 so i grab all the careplans and its referrals if it exists, if it does - take only the newest referral</p>

<pre><code>select * from CarePlan c //query 1
left outer join Referral r on 
r.CarePlanId = c.CarePlanId


select top 1 * from Referral r //query 2
where r.CarePlanId = '1'
order by ReferralDate desc

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>The first query gives me something like this: </p>

<pre><code>CarePlanID    ReferralId     ReferralDate
----------    ----------     ------------
1             1              05/15/12
2             NULL           NULL
1             2              05/10/12  //Old date, dont want this careplan
</code></pre>

<p>The second query will give me the referral with the newest date</p>

<pre><code>ReferralId    ReferralDate
----------    ------------
1             05/15/12
</code></pre>

<p>The Referral data, may have 0 or more referrals belonging to a Careplan</p>

<pre><code>ReferralID  CarePlanId    Date
----------  ----------    ----
1           1             05/15/12
2           1             05/10/12
</code></pre>

<p>Ultimately I want a query that gives me careplans with referrals that have the newest date, or null for referrals if it doesnt have it</p>

<p>like this:</p>

<pre><code>CarePlanId   ReferralId    ReferralDate
----------   ----------    ------------
1            1             05/15/12

<pre><code>select *

left outer join (select  min(loanId) as loanId, stuffownerId from loan  
 where userid = 1 and status &lt;&gt; 2 group by stuffownerId) t on t.stuffownerid = so.stuffownerid
left outer join loan on t.LoanId = loan.LoanId
</code></pre>

<p>when this is done, I would like to do a linq Group by to have Stuff has key, then stuffowners + Loan as value.</p>

<p>I can't seem to get to a nice query without sub query (hence the double left outer).</p>

<p>So basically what my query does, is for each stuff I've in my database, bring the owners, and then i want to bring the  first loan a user has made on that stuff.</p>

<p>I've tried various linq:</p>

<pre><code>from stuff in Stuffs
join so in StuffOwners on stuff.StuffId equals so.StuffId
join  tLoan in Loans on so.StuffOwnerId equals tLoan.StuffOwnerId into tmpJoin 
from tTmpJoin in tmpJoin.DefaultIfEmpty()
group tTmpJoin by new {stuff}  into grouped
select new {grouped, fluk = (int?)grouped.Max(w=&gt; w.Status )}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not good because if I don't get stuff owner and on top of that it seems to generate a lot of queries (LinqPad)</p>

<pre><code>from stuff in Stuffs
join so in StuffOwners on stuff.StuffId equals so.StuffId
join tmpLoan in 
 (from tLoan in Loans group tLoan by  tLoan.StuffOwnerId into g 
 select new {StuffOwnerId = g.Key, loanid = (from t2 in g select t2.LoanId).Max()})
 on so.StuffOwnerId equals tmpLoan.StuffOwnerId
 into tmptmp  from tMaxLoan in tmptmp.DefaultIfEmpty()
select new {stuff, so, tmptmp}
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to generate a lot of subqueries as well.</p>

<p>I've tried the let keyworkd with:</p>

<pre><code>from  tstuffOwner in StuffOwners 
let tloan = Loans.Where(p2 =&gt; tstuffOwner.StuffOwnerId == p2.StuffOwnerId).FirstOrDefault()
select new { qsdq = tstuffOwner, qsdsq= (int?) tloan.Status, kwk= (int?) tloan.UserId, kiwk=  tloan.ReturnDate  }
</code></pre>

<p>but the more info i get from tLoan, the longer the query gets with more subqueries</p>

<p>What would be the best way to achieve this?

<p>but simple ain't always good enough.  I imagine that if I retrieve a single site document, I get its boatload of views data as well.  Would it be better to have a homemade relational system, e.g. store the views' nums in a Site doc as indices into the View collection?</p>

<p>IOW, what are some examples of big data storage layouts with MongoDB?  Any suggestions welcome.</p>

"27256374","1","","","2014-12-02 18:24:49","","0","141","<p>good morning. I have a modal pop up that I am displaying for the length of the entire loading period for every command on my website that triggers either a complete post back or even a partial render. So far it's reliable and working well there are some kinks however as I understand that ASP was not designed for this but I want to summon my best hackers to develop a solution together. Please tune in.</p>

<p>So on windows.onunload as well as BeginRequestHandler events I trigger modal popup.show. This part works great. The pop up shows instantly. There are three problems:</p>

<p>1) window.onload is not always called and therefore is not reliable when it comes to partial renders. I have to use an event called EndRequestHandler to call modal popup.hide. The issue here is that EndRequestHandler gets called way too soon and if there is a window.onload fired, the EndRequestHandler will be called way before it and it hides the popup too early. This causes the page to show the popup and then hide it again right away which is wrong. I don't want the popup to hide until the page is 100% finished loading whether it's a complete 100% postback full render reload or a partial render that does not trigger a pageload complete in the master page. I should also mention that all this code takes place in the master page so every other page inherits this functionality which seems fine.</p>

<p>2) the other problem is that the popup does not survive postbacks. As soon as the page gets unloaded it destroys the popup with it. I want the popup to survive postbacks and keep showing until window.onload has been called. In fact, one more problem is that even when I call modal popup.hide in the window.onload event I notice that the pop up hides before the onload event is even called. WTF how is that even possible? I want to make it hide as soon as the console.log says window.onload. It could have something do with the rendering taking place before the onload event is handled or something along those lines.</p>

Additionally, i have placed a stop button which also stops the song which is being played. Now, here is the problem when i write the following block of code, my program crashes and my error log shows java.lang.NullPointerException-</p>

<pre><code> public void playSong(int res)
    {
        if(mp.isPlaying()) {

            mp.start();
        }


    }

<p>But if i change the code to the following, it works fine. I see that mp.reset() is the issue. But I dont know how to fix it because without it the when i click on a song and there is already a song which is playing, both the songs play at the same time.-</p>

"1943597","1","1947639","","2009-12-22 00:55:26","","0","2632","<p>How can I force .NET's XmlSerializer to add an <strong>xsi:type=""FooClass""</strong> to a member/node of type <strong><code>FooClass</code></strong>?</p>

<p>The scenario is a currently-released app, where in v.1 :</p>

<ul>
<li>FooClass inherits FooBaseClass</li>
<li>FooPropertyA is on FooBaseClass</li>
<li>FooPropertyB is on FooClass</li>
<li>FooBaseClass is decorated with [XmlInclude(typeof(FooClass))]</li>
<li>BazClass has member Foo of type FooBaseClass</li>
<li>All sets of Baz.Foo are to a FooClass instance</li>
<li>All usages of Baz.Foo expect FooPropertyB (and so a FooClass instance vs FooBaseClass)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The goal: Remove FooBaseClass entirely, pushing FooBaseClass's members up into FooClass, <em>while maintaining backward serialization compatibility</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>The problem: Then I lose the xsi:type=""FooClass"" attribute on the Baz.Foo serialization.</strong></p>

<p>In other words the XmlSerializer.Serialize output of</p>

<pre><code>public class BazClass
{
    public BazClass()
    {
        Foo = new FooClass { A = 5, B = ""Hello"" };
    }
    public FooClass Foo { get; set; }
}

public class FooClass
{
    public int FooPropertyA { get; set; }
    public string FooPropertyB { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>needs to be</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Baz&gt;
    &lt;Foo xsi:type=""FooClass""&gt;
        &lt;FooPropertyA&gt;Hello&lt;/FooPropertyA&gt;
        &lt;FooPropertyB&gt;5&lt;/FooPropertyB&gt;
    &lt;/Foo&gt;
&lt;/Baz&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Removing FooBasClass is easy, but then XmlSerializer no longer places xsi:type=""FooClass"" on Baz/Foo, and so v.1 XmlSerializer.Deserialize instantiates a FooBaseClass instance, not setting FooPropertyB, and assigns it to the Foo property of the parent Baz instance.  Thus, any code which checks whether Baz.Foo is FooClass, or casts directly, fails.</p>

<p>The xsi:type attribute was placed automatically in the v.1 code which was</p>

<pre><code>public class BazClass
{
    public BazClass()
    {
        Foo = new FooClass { A = 5, B = ""Hello"" };
    }
    public FooBaseClass Foo { get; set; }
}

public class FooClass : FooBaseClass
{
    public string FooPropertyB { get; set; }
}

[XmlInclude(typeof(FooClass))]    
public class FooBaseClass
{
    public int FooPropertyA { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think the short answer is that you can't - at least not without implementing I(Xml)Serializable or writing custom serialization code.  However, I'm open to good suggestions.  Meanwhile I have implemented a <del>workaround</del> hack below, and am hoping for something more elegant, or that at least allows me somehow to remove FooBaseClass entirely.</p>

<pre><code>BazClass
{
    [XmlElement(""Foo"")]
    public FooBaseClass XmlFoo { get { return Foo; } set { Foo = (StartPicture)value; } }

    [XmlIgnore]
    public FooClass Foo { get; set; }
}    

FooClass : FooBaseClass
{
    public int FooPropertyB { get; set; }
    public string FooPropertyA { get; set; }
}

[XmlInclude(""FooClass"")]
FooBaseClass
{
}

pub.settings '/settings', :controller =&gt; :settings, :action =&gt; :index, :conditions =&gt; get

<p>This works, but if you notice that the first route ""pub.settings"" is outside of the mapped_options block.</p>

<pre><code>$('#rateItYours').bind('rated reset', function (e) {
                var ri = $(this);
                var value = ri.rateit('value');
                var trainingID = $(""#MainContent_hlTrainingDateID"").text();

                //maybe we want to disable voting? ri.rateit('readonly', true);

                $.ajax({
                url: 'RateIt.aspx', //your server side script
                data: { id: trainingID, value: value }, //our data
                type: 'POST',
                success: function (data) {
                $('#response').append('&lt;li&gt;' + data + '&lt;/li&gt;');
                },
                error: function (jxhr, msg, err) {
                $('#response').append('&lt;li style=""color:red""&gt;' + msg + '&lt;/li&gt;');
                }
                });
            });
</code></pre>

<p>So I've easily got the value of the rating using:</p>

<p><code>var value = ri.rateit('value');</code></p>

<p>And I also have the Database ID I need for the training date with this:</p>

<p><code>var trainingID = $(""#MainContent_hlTrainingDateID"").text();</code></p>

<p>So I can alert both <code>value</code> and <code>trainingID</code>.  My issue is I never wrote anything that makes some sort of <code>ajax()</code> call.  So I see it passes the url <code>RateIt.aspx</code> so I created a new webform called RateIt.aspx.  So far so good...but how should the code of this RateIt.aspx intercept the <code>trainingID</code> and <code>value</code> as noted here:</p>

<p><code>data: { id: trainingID, value: value }, //our data</code></p>

<p>So I'm using the chrome developers tool, and I see that before I added RateIt.aspx it failed saying it could not find this resource.  So once I created RateIt.aspx then chrome did not report an error, but the issue is I'd like to understand this ajax call and how to write RateIt.aspx.  How would it look to take those values from the <code>data</code> line.</p>

<p>Can someone please explain and provide guidance on how RateIt.aspx would look like?  Maybe showing the code (preferably in C#) that actually grabs these values and either alerts them or some sort of mock up code to see I've got the right values?   Sorry for the noob question.</p>

And possibly then having later compilation automatically place unchanged code into the same sections as they already occupy. And the changed code sections being allowed to use the unused memory of the section it occupied last.</p>

<p>I can see that this can probably be done manually with a linker script and then using linker options in the code when coding. But I'm wondering if it is possible to do this automatically.</p>

<p>Since I want to modify the code later on, I'm trying to write actual machine instructions (as opposed to inline assembly) and am trying to execute those instructions. Someone told me that it would be possible to <strong>just malloc some memory, write the instructions there, point a C function pointer to it and then jump to it.</strong> (I include the example below)</p>

<p>I've tried this with my cross compiler (sourcery codebench toolchain) and it doesn't work (yes, in hind sight I suppose it does seem rather naive). How could I properly do this?</p>

    *(addone + 1) = 0x23e00000; //this is jr $ra

<p>I follow the gcc calling convention here, where the arguments are passed to $a0 and the results of the functions are expected to be in $v0. I don't actually know if the return address will be put into $ra (but I can't test it yet since I can't compile.

<p>Trying to ask facebook for access to manage_pages permission they denied because as they said ""You do not need to request these permissions because your blog or CMS is integrated with an app that you admin. As an App admin, you can already access these permissions and post to your timeline or a page you admin. You can provide access to additional users by adding them as developers of your App."" </p>

<p>Now in the code. I altered a bit spring social showcase example. And my case is as follows:
1) I login to facebook through my app
2) Trying to get the number of pages that I administer
3) Post to my wall.</p>

<p>For step two I am using this code:</p>

<pre><code>if (facebook.pageOperations().getAccounts() != null) {
        System.out.println(""SIZE OF ACCCOUNTS IS: "" + facebook.pageOperations().getAccounts().size());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The size of accounts is always 0. So this means that although I should be able to post to the pages that I am administrator I can not even see them. Am I correct?</p>

<p>For step three now:</p>

<pre><code>facebook.feedOperations().updateStatus(""I'm trying out Spring Social!"");
    facebook.feedOperations().post(new PostData(""me"").message(""I'm trying out Spring Social!"")
        .link(""http://www.springsource.org/spring-social"", null, ""Spring Social"", ""The Spring Social Project"", ""Spring Social is an extension to Spring to enable applications to connect with service providers.""));
    System.out.println(""FEED POSTED"");
</code></pre>

<p>both of those attempts fail with the following exception:</p>

<p>When I get that data back on server side, via $_POST['encodedname1'], I get the data already decoded, and I do not need to use urldecode(). 
I have seen many questions on this and other forums about how to decode data back, and I am wondering why people asks such a question if php gets data already decoded (as confirmed in another post here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1373414/ajax-post-and-plus-sign-how-to-encode"">AJAX POST and Plus Sign ( + ) -- How to Encode?</a>). 
Is there something critical about this issue that I miss or don't know?</p>

<p>Also, what happens if I pass in the POST request some unencoded characters, that I use as delimiters between datasets, let's say ""#""? It is possible that received data may be corrupted, and/or ""#"" delimiter get lost? Does it have security issues?

It's supposed to work by starting at the end of the given array, and marking where the first non-space character occurs.

<p>So in main, I have:</p>

<pre><code>    ifstream inFile;                    
//defines the file pointer for the text document
    ofstream outFile;                   
//the file pointer for the output file

    openFile(inFile, outFile);          
//allow the user to specify a file for reading and outputting the stats
</code></pre>

<p>And then the function:</p>

<pre><code>void openFile(ifstream&amp; inF, ofstream&amp; outF){
    // Ask the user what file to READ from
    string readFile, writeFile;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Enter the name of the file you want to READ from: "";
    cin &gt;&gt; readFile;
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
        // Open the File
    inF.open(readFile);
    // Ask the user what file to WRITE to

    cin &gt;&gt; writeFile;
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    outF.open(writeFile);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have also implemented the:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;fstream&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>using namespace std;
</code></pre>

<p>The things that were in the main were put there by the instructor, so I can't change those. In other words, I HAVE to pass the file pointers into the openFile function and ask the user for the names of the files. However, I was never taught how to do this. A basic answer would be appreciated, going off what I've already been doing.</p>

Also it seems a little inefficient to keep sending the same repeated html for each page.</p>

<p>For the moment I have written a small program which reads these sections from my index.htm and replaces the relevant sections within all other pages in that directory.  However things have started to get considerably more awkward now that I have extra pages like a Message Forum and Image Gallery, both of which require their own index.htm in their respective sub directories.</p>

<p>So the question is should I be using object, iframe or SSI?</p>

<p>Has anyone successfully used the object tag to embed a separate HTML file within a page?  SSI would do the job except that the repeated HTML is still being sent across the web on every page change and different include lines would have to be used on the PHP pages.  What about using IFrames, I know they are not strict XHTML1.0 compliant but I seem to recall rumors that they are going to br supported in HTML5 again, does that make them a good bet for the future?</p>

<p>I'm guessing INCLUDE is Sql Server specific which is why the dialect-scope is there.  I know how to create a single and multi-column index, but this is not what I want.  I want a single column index on zipcode and all other columns in the User table part of the INCLUDE clause of the query.  Is there any way to create this type of index using the mapping file or some other way?  </p>

<p>This is probably a long shot, but it would be nice to not have to specify every column but the indexed one in the INCLUDE part of the query...  Instead to just let nhibernate add any new columns to the index that are added as properties to the mapping file.</p>

Now I need to port the code on the older Android API, and in case, Android API version 8, so I can run my application on mostly all Android devices, starting from Android 2.2.</p>

<p>The problem I come across is that some methods used in the answer are only available in Android API 16+.</p>

<pre><code>        mPagination = new Pagination(mText,
                mTextView.getWidth(),
                mTextView.getHeight(),
                mTextView.getPaint(),
                mTextView.getLineSpacingMultiplier(),
                mTextView.getLineSpacingExtra(),
                mTextView.getIncludeFontPadding());
</code></pre>

<p>So, I have to implement at least these methods:</p>

<pre><code>                TextView.getLineSpacingMultiplier()
                TextView.getLineSpacingExtra()
                TextView.getIncludeFontPadding()
</code></pre>

<p>The second one seems to be already described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22243801/how-to-get-linespacing-of-a-textview"">here</a> as:</p>

<pre><code>mTextView.getPaint().getFontSpacing()
* mTextView.getLineSpacingMultiplier() + mTextView.getLineSpacingExtra()
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't know if the other two are relevant in 2.2, and if they are, how to implement them in Android API version 8. There is some hint <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19755405/retrieve-line-spacing-in-textview-android"">here</a>, using the source code of Android <code>TextView</code> which I could not fully understand.</p>

It has a dependency on a set of 3rd party dlls which are designed to be deployed in an SxS manner.

<p>Other 3rd (or 4th) party applications using the same set of dlls install them into winSxS, and when our application loads it accesses both the local version and the version in winSxS.  This causes some strange UI corruption with respect to resources loaded from an unmanaged resource dll by the SxS dlls.</p>

<p>but top no avail.</p>

<p>My question is this:</p>

<p>Is there a way to continue the application running successfully if no other applications are installed on the machine and the dlls are in the application bin directory, whilst also running successfully if another application installs the dlls into winSxS.
In other words, can I force the application to load exclusively from winSxS or locally which ever is present in both scenarios where the dlls exist in winSxS or not.</p>

<p><strong>Extra Info</strong></p>

<p>The application accesses the dll using a dllImport:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""ExternalDll.dll"", EntryPoint = ""_DoStuff@12"")]
[CLSCompliantAttribute(false)]
public static extern IntPtr DoStuffEx(string name, string reserved, uint uiFlags);
</code></pre>

<p>and the dll has the embedded manifest:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;assembly xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1"" manifestVersion=""1.0""&gt;
  &lt;assemblyIdentity name=""ExternalDLL.dll"" processorArchitecture=""x86"" type=""win32"" version=""12.0.0.0""&gt;&lt;/assemblyIdentity&gt;
 &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
        &lt;assemblyIdentity name=""sharedSXS"" version=""12.1.369.0"" publicKeyToken=""1255b113b2b03444"" type=""win32""/&gt;
    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/assembly&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the SxS Manifest looks like follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;assembly xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1"" manifestVersion=""1.0""&gt;

<p>there are 4 scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>application has no manifest, SxS not installed -> app loads dll locally if present else fails</li>
<li>application has manifest, SxS not installed -> app loads dll locally if present else fails</li>
<li><p>application has no manifest, SxS present -> </p>

<p>A. app loads dll locally if present, dll then loads dependency from SxS corruption occurs</p>

<p>B. no local dll, app fails</p></li>
<li><p>application has manifest, SxS present -> </p>

<p>A. app loads dll locally if present, dll then loads dependency from SxS corruption occurs</p>

<p>B. no local dll, app loads from SxS all is well</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are 2 scenarios I need to make work:</p>

<ol>
<li>dll in local folder only (none in SxS)</li>
<li>dll in local folder and SxS</li>
</ol>

<p>I have total control over the application manifest and the dllImport so any modification needed here are under my control. The scenario with the dlls in SxS only is irrelevant.</p>

<p>I'm using garden-variety PERL, and was trying to use LWP::UserAgent to do this... if there is a more elegant way, please point me in that direction.</p>

<p>I'm able to hit their server, and get a code back... but it denies access to their server because the username and password it is expecting is not correct.  The username and password are not specified in the actual XML code, it is supposed to be passed to the server as part of the actual POST method... but I have no clue how to do that.</p>

<p>The partner gives the following feedback:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>replacing the YOUR_XML_FILE, YOUR_USER and YOUR_PASSWORD with his xml
  that gets generated, and his username/password combination.  This
  should be done from the server that he has his perl script.</p>

<p>I don't know where this is supposed to be generated, or what the options are in LWP::UserAgent to specify them.  Has anyone out there done this before?  </p>

<p>The problem I have is that if the gauge button is pressed while the program is off then when the program starts it fires the data received event for that existing data.  I don't want this behavior -- I only want to collect readings done after the port is opened.</p>

<p>I have a current workaround using a Thread.Sleep but it seems hacky and I'm wondering if anyone knows of a better solution.</p>

<pre><code>port = New SerialPort(""COM1"", 9600, Parity.None, 8, StopBits.One)

port.Open()
port.DtrEnable = True

System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100)
port.ReadExisting()

AddHandler port.DataReceived, AddressOf PortDataReceived
</code></pre>

<p>If I don't have the Thread.Sleep then the DataReceived event is fired for the previous gauge data.  I'm guessing this is because the ReadExisting doesn't block and so when its called immediately after an open it just reads nothing.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<hr>

<p>So if you call 'port.BytesToRead()' immediately after open its zero.  If you call it 100ms after open its non-zero.  I guess this makes sense -- it takes time after open to read the existing data.</p>

<p>Another option is to call read and set the read timeout but that seems no different than Thread.Sleep except you have to catch an exception...</p>

<p>To do that, I've created a Record Set for example.com type A which holds the IP 1.2.3.4</p>

<p>I have created a vhost.conf in /etc/httpd/conf.d with this content:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost 192.168.1.34 192.168.1.76&gt;

<ol>
<li>Typing example.com in my browser I was going to subdomain.example.com.</li>
<li>Typing subdomain.domain.com in my browser I was going to subdomain.example.com</li>
<li>Removing the IP to domain.com and setting <code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</code> was solving the problem but everybody could enter domain.com and this is the point to avoid.</li>
</ol>

<p>Does anybody know where is the mistake?</p>

<p>In Coldfusion, I was trying to parse out the Activity nodes with this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cfset arrMainNodes = XmlSearch(soapResponse,  ""//*[name()='Activity']"")  /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, instead if getting an array with three elements, I get an array with six: 3 of the parent, and 3 of the children.</p>

<p>I can't for the life of me figure out the XPath statement the will find siblings only, and not children.</p>

<p>Please Help.</p>

<p>After cloning the repo should be able to pull branches from Laptop.</p>

<p>I have tried: on uniOne: git-svn clone uniTwo, git remote add Laptop, but then git fetch wants to get the whole thing from Laptop.  I thought maybe using git clone --depth x Laptop and then graft them together might work but it still requires all of the source files to be transfered Laptop->uniOne, not just the changes.  I could try to export all patches from Laptop and apply them on top of a fresh svn checkout then get it to track the branch on my Laptop (if that is possible) but it would be easier to wait until I am next at uni and then just clone normally.</p>

It uses some dragPanelExtenders as well as some other AJAX Control Toolkit AJAX client side stuff, and in order to show the page to somebody, I wanted to put it up as a plain HTML file, hosted on a live web server (running APACHE). (This is the only public web server I have access to, and I want them to be able to drag some panels and experience the page as it would be when ""live"") </p>

<p>So, I viewed the page running on my local IIS, then saved the source as a HTML file.</p>

<p>Then copied this HTML file to the web server ( as well as necessary CSS, JS and image files).</p>

<p>When I view this HTML file through the web server, I get this error : </p>

</p>

<p>So, at runtime, the referenced resources ""ScriptResource.axd"" and ""WebResource.axd"" were not found.</p>

<p>Is there any way to get whatever is needed from those AXD's to my HTML file, without actually executing anything on IIS?</p>

        i) Fragment 1 is containing Viewpager and login button in bottom of view pager, Viewpager holds 5 screen in viewpager.
        ii) User click login button I just replace Fragment2 on the container view.  when I press back, come to Fragment1, Viewpager doesn't show slide content ? again if I swipe next slides then only it'd load the screens.
        iii) When I come back from another fragment to fragment1. viewpager is not loading data properly.</p>

<p>please help me to find my mistake.

<p>However, I both tried matlab and rigin to fit data with the model, but they all failed to find a good fit. I am appreciate if you can provide any suggestions. In fact, I understand there are too many parameters, and I also tried to fix parameter b, d, e and g while free others, but still no good results.</p>

Also, these APIs will be accessed from <strong>different Origin/domain by Angular WEB UI</strong>. I don't need Spring Authentication as authentication is handled by Siteminder. </p>

<p><strong>Approach:</strong>
I followed this link from from Dave Syer for CSRF protection : <a href=""https://spring.io/blog/2015/01/12/the-login-page-angular-js-and-spring-security-part-ii"" rel=""nofollow"">The Login Page: Angular JS and Spring Security Part II</a> which is <strong>working perfectly except one issue (Below).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Issue</strong>: This code work perfectly fine when my angular html client accessing the RESTful APIs on the same origin/domain; but when I try to access the same APIs from a different origin, getting an error 403 - Access Forbidden - CSRF token error.</p>

<p>Approach That I tried so far by extending your example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Added a CORS filter - <a href=""https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/"" rel=""nofollow"">Enabling Cross Origin Requests for a RESTful Web Service</a></p>

<pre><code>response.setHeader(""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"", ""*"");
response.setHeader(""Access-Control-Allow-Methods"", ""POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE"");
response.setHeader(""Access-Control-Max-Age"", ""3600"");
response.setHeader(""Access-Control-Allow-Headers"", ""x-requested-with"");
</code></pre></li>

<p>No Luck on the above.</p>

<p>Please suggest if I need to do anything else to make it work.</p>

<p>The normal behaviour is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Press <code>Esc</code> button to launch Css modal dialog.</li>
<li>If user again presses the <code>Esc</code>, dialog should disappear</li>
<li>Should launch again on next <code>Esc</code>.</li>
<li>If user clicks <code>Ok</code> then Send message..</li>
<li>If user clicks <code>Cancel</code> then dialog should disappear.</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is:
 - If user presses <code>Esc</code> continuously then modal automatically gets disappears permanently. No errors appears in console.log. I'm not able to debug the reason.</p>

Upto now I have created 50 IP alias on my client machine and 10 IP alias on my server machine.

I have also developed few profiles(1kb,10kb,50kb,100kb,500kb,1mb) on my server(in /var/www/html directory since I am using Apache Server) and I am using urllib2 to send request to these profiles from my client machine.

IdentityHashMap has a constructor which takes expectedmaxsize</p>

<pre><code>public IdentityHashMap(int expectedMaxSize);
</code></pre>

<p>and internally java uses expectedmaxsize to calculate capacity as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>// Compute min capacity for expectedMaxSize given a load factor of 2/3
        int minCapacity = (3 * expectedMaxSize)/2;
</code></pre>

<p>On exploring further I found that user is expected to pass a good value of expectedmaxsize  so that IdentityHashMap is not resized as more elements are added.</p>

<p>If  try to compare this with HashMap, then it has a constructor which accepts initialCapacity:</p>

<pre><code> public HashMap(int initialCapacity)
</code></pre>

<p>and another constructor which accepts loadfactor and initialcapacity:</p>

<pre><code>   public HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor) 
</code></pre>

<p>and here is hashmap there is no such guideline regarding initialcapacity.</p>

<p>So clearly there is a difference in the way size of internal array is managed in HashMap and IdentityHashMap. I don't understand why do we have this difference? why can't Identityhashmap provide a constructor same as Hashmap?</p>

<p>I am writing in bash for Mac OS X and Linux; currently testing on OS X. Code is here</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/taikedz/fullsync32/blob/master/fullsync32"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/taikedz/fullsync32/blob/master/fullsync32</a></p>

<p>The script recurses through directories finding</p>

<ul>
<li>files that have a resource fork (HFS property)</li>
<li>files that are larger than 4 GB</li>
</ul>

<p>and upon finding such files either processes them via <code>tar -cz</code> or <code>split</code> as appropriate, before copying them over.</p>

<p>I use recursion instead of the <code>find</code> utility because of the test for presence of resource fork on a file: it involves checking the size of a special file. Say you have file foo.txt; its resource fork can be found by looking at <code>ls -l foo.txt/..namedfork/rsrc</code> and cheking the length is non-zero.</p>

<p>The basic structure is</p>

<pre>recurse() {
  pushd ""$1""
    for NODE in *; do
      if [ -d ""$NODE"" ]; then
        recurse ""$NODE""
        continue
      fi
      # (process files here, with calls to split, tar and md5)
    done
  popd
}

recurse ./target/directory</pre>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>I ran this against my backups the other day and left it running for a few hours. When I came back I found that my spare 11 GB of RAM had been used up, and it was ~248 MB into swap...</p>

<p>I looked around on Google for issues around bash memory leakage in recursion, and apart from a few tenuously answered forum posts, didn't find much...</p>

<p>The other add result of which (which is Mac specific) is that the ""Inactive memory"" stays inactive and the system runs slowly... Restart required.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is such potentially deep recursion with bash a bad idea in itself?</li>
<li>is there an ingenious way to iterate rather than recurse in this situation?</li>
<li>or am I going about this completely wrong anyways?</li>

<p>I'm using StartService to start it, but for some reason it just hangs, I've done some research over the internet and it seems it waits for ensurance from the ServiceMain function to tell the control manager that the service has successfully initialized and is now running.</p>

<p>The problem is, nothing seems to be working, I've initialized the ServiceMain function using StartServiceCtrlDispatcher() but it never seems to be called, I've inserted some code into the servicemain function to ensure it's being called, and it isn't for some odd reason.</p>

<p>I've made sure no other function in the process is failing, CreateService returns success, as does OpenService, but as soon as I get to StartService, it hangs, and the only way it'll let me call StartService again is after I reboot.</p>

"4389181","1","4435671","","2010-12-08 15:29:27","","10","6708","<p>I'm new to ruby, learning Sinatra. While creating a Sinatra site by requiring <code>'sinatra'</code> and setting up the routes directly under is pretty easy and rather well documented, creating an application by requiring <code>'sinatra/base'</code> and writing a class that inherits from <code>'Sinatra::Base</code>', while still relatively easy, is very poorly documented (maybe because it's a pretty recent feature of Sinatra).</p>

<p>And that's exactly what I am doing. I am not having too much trouble on the Sinatra part, however I am having a bit of trouble on the rackup/thin/server part. Apparently there are two ways to deploy the application: using Sinatra itself (using the <code>run!</code> method) and using a rackup file (typically <code>config.ru</code>).</p>

<p>Using Sinatra's <code>run!</code> method is extremely intuitive and works like a charm, but apparently it doesn't work if I want to deploy my app on heroku. As a matter of fact, almost all the Sinatra apps that I have encountered on GitHub use a <code>config.ru</code> file.</p>

<p>Using a rackup file might be equally intuitive, but I can't manage to understand how to pass options from the Sinatra app to the server (ir: the port). I tried to merge options to rackup's default options array:</p>

<pre><code>MyApp::App.default_options.merge!(
  :run  =&gt; false,
  :env  =&gt; :production,
  :port =&gt; 4567
)

run MyApp::App
</code></pre>

<p>by adding options directly to the app:</p>

<pre><code>MyApp::App.set :port, 4567
MyApp::App.set :run, false
MyApp::App.set :env, :production

run MyApp::App
</code></pre>

<p>by setting options from within the application class:</p>

<pre><code>module MyApp
  class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
    set :port, 4567
    set :run, false
    set :env, :production

    # ...

  # config.ru
  require 'app'

  run MyApp::App
</code></pre>

<p>All the methods above failed, either by showing error messages or by just not taking any of the options into consideration. So is there any way to pass options to rackup/thin/the sever via a Sinatra app when using a rackup file? Or the options in questions should be passed directly to rackup/thin/the sever via command-line options?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typical good candidates for the NDK are self-contained, CPU-intensive operations that don't allocate much memory, such as signal processing, physics simulation, and so on. Simply re-coding a method to run in C usually does not result in a large performance increase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mine is a signal processing algorithm (adaptive filter, in case you're familiar), computationally intensive computation with millions of linear operations (can't show the code, but millions of linear operations pretty much sums it up). When I implement the same code with JNI and Java, I get practically no performance gain. In fact, it takes the exact same amount of time in either, within uncertainty margin, so now I'm not sure whether I should just use Java for everything else. For comparison, they both take ~8 seconds to complete the task.</p>

<p>Are there any better criteria for when algorithms implemented in JNI work faster than Java? Does anyone have an example in which performance was truly noticeable?</p>

<p>So since my ImageView is part of a custom view anyway, I am now thinking of using the canvas in <code>onDraw(Canvas canvas)</code> to create my three circles and set them as the background of the ImageView.

Therefore I use a windows low level hook (WH_KEYBOARD_LL) which works fine except that I´m not able to determine if WIN-Key (VK_LWIN / VK_RWIN) is pressed (control / shift and alt is working).</p>

<p>I made a little commandline tool to show the problem:</p>

<p>If I return ""1"" from LowLevelKeyboardProc every key press is ""swallowed"" (except for CTRL+ALT+DEL and WIN+L). If I call the next hook at the end of the callback function the behaviour changes (and the keys obviously aren´t swallowed any more). Then if WIN key is pressed together with another key I get the information that WIN key is pressed.</p>

<p>What do I have to do to intercept all keyboard input and detect a WIN-key press (using GetAsyncKeyState)? Or is there another way to get all (inkl. WIN) pressed modifier keys?</p>

  <p>You can also assign values to your variables upon declaration. When we
  assign values to a variable using the assignment operator (equals
  sign), it’s called an explicit assignment:</p>

<pre><code>int nValue = 5; // explicit assignment

  <p>You can also assign values to variables using an implicit assignment:</p>

<pre><code>int nValue(5); // implicit assignment

  <p>Even though implicit assignments look a lot like function calls, the

<p>I've been working in my spare time for a few years on designing a game in C++. I got my Core engine for the game logic all figured out as well as a rough Input system and using OpenGL and AL for output. What I want to do is figure out how to get my Engine to start and Then run my Input System, Graphics Engine, and Sound System in separate threads. and all run at the same time. Syncing my threads be the next step but I can't get the threads to run together.</p>

boost::thread cTrd(boost::bind(&amp;game::runCore, this));
cTrd.join();

<p>That's What I got so far. Problem is as far as I can see is that the Graphics Engine in gTrd has an infinite loop thats suppose to keep going until program terminates so I get my blank screen up but it never starts the sTrd.</p>

<p>What exactly is needed to make it so I can run my threads which are in theory indefinite threads? Also any potential problems I need to look out for in terms of memory leaks be awesome to know.</p>

<p>My DLL is not the type that holds a bunch of functions to be exported and called. Instead it does a switch/case in the DllMain and on DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH will spawn a new thread. Therefore all I need Visual Studio to do is to load my DLL into a stub executable and allow me to set breakpoints, etc.</p>

<p>I've run <code>gem update --syste</code>m, and <code>gem pristine --all</code>. I've put all the test gems in <code>group(:development, :test, :cucumber) do</code> in my gemfile and as you can see from the trace I'm running bundle install without development test. It must be a weird dependency in my Gemfile which is here: anything look off to you? </p>

<p>Can someone please help explain the above error? It occurs using Embarcadero's XE7. The same code compiles fine using Visual Studio.
The problem on XE7, as demonstrated, only occurs in the second line of the <code>test</code> method, all other cases compile fine.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Sorry, I pasted the wrong constructor in my example, it's fixed now. When surrounded by parentheses, the constructor with the boolean parameter compiles, but the parameterless constructor won't compile.</p>

I would like to reduce the stock integer by 1 each time a specie is chose from the second list and a button click happens. I am lost on how to build a update statement to do this on the selection from the second drop down, I would appriciate any help at all.

<p>so the what I want is that when they have chose there country then the specie they click button and id decrements the Stock of the table chosen buy 1.
I hope some one can help, thank you.</p>

<pre><code>        try {
            UdpClient udpClient = new UdpClient(10241);

            // Connect
            udpClient.Connect(server_ip_address,  10240);

            // prepare the packet to send
            iWritableBuff wbuff = new iWritableBuff();
            [ ... ]

            // Send 
            udpClient.Send(wbuff.GetBuff(), (int)wbuff.Written());

            // Receive a response
            IPEndPoint RemoteIpEndPoint = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 0);
            Byte[] receiveBytes = udpClient.Receive(ref RemoteIpEndPoint); 
            Console.WriteLine(""We've got some data from the server!!! "" + receiveBytes.Length + "" bytes."");

            udpClient.Close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Console.WriteLine(""ERROR: "" + e.ToString());
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I run both applications on the same computer. Server receives a request to port 10240 from the client port 10241 and sends a response back to client port 10241, but client never receive it. So, I'm sure that server sends packet back, because everything works perfectly with C++ client. It means that I'm, doing something wrong on my C# client. Any idea?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>P.S.> Just test it with Berkley Socket C# client:</p>

<pre><code>        try {
            // Create socket
            Socket s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp);
            // Bind
            IPEndPoint myEP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 0);
            s.Bind(myEP);

            // prepare the packet to send
            iWritableBuff wbuff = new iWritableBuff();
            [ ... ]

            // Send it
            IPEndPoint sEP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(server_ip_address), 10240);
            int res = s.SendTo(wbuff.GetBuff(), (int)wbuff.Written(), 0, sEP);

            // Receive the response
            byte[] receiveBytes = new Byte[1024];
            EndPoint recEP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 0);
            res = s.ReceiveFrom(receiveBytes, ref recEP);
            Console.WriteLine(""We've got some data from the server!!! "" + res + "" bytes."");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Console.WriteLine(""ERROR: "" + e.ToString());
        }

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/07Gyq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>and I have two specific questions to further customize the layout:</p>

<p>First, I notice that initializing nodes positions deterministically (e.g. done diagonally here, see the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/11894057/1036544"">script</a> for details) fixes the positions of the nodes, and the orientation of the nodes seem to depend on this initialization as well as the dimensions of the force graph*. I wonder how can I make the nodes <code>A, D, E, F, I</code> in the graph above <strong>aligned horizontally</strong>? In other words, I want to turn the orientation of the graph anti-clockwise for roughly 45 degrees. I have tried to initialize the nodes horizontally in the middle:</p>

<pre><code>nodes.forEach(function(d, i) { d.x = w / size * i; d.y = h / 2; });
</code></pre>

<p>but the produced output has all the nodes and edges horizontally at where they were initialized.</p>

<p>Second, is it true that the force graph is automatically centered within the <code>svg</code> element? If no, how can we make it so? If yes, how can we specify a center for the force graph within the <code>svg</code> element? </p>

<p>(* Note: strangely, when setting <code>.size([w, h])</code> where <code>w = h</code> for the force graph, and deterministically initializing the nodes along a diagonal, all the nodes and edges are positioned along that diagonal in the output, why?)</p>

The class UserProfileListResource gets a list of users formatted in JSON (therefore, the content type is application/json). I've not reproduced the code because it works fine when testing it manually.</p>

<p>I have it registered in urls.py as follows:</p>

<pre><code>v1_api = Api(api_name='v1')

<p>However, when I write a simple test case using django.test.client.Client to send the request out, I receive an HTTP 200 response with empty response content and the wrong content-type (text/html instead of application/json).</p>

<p>From what I could see, there have been other people who were successful. Is there something obvious I am missing? I'm stuck! :-(</p>

<p>Please find below my test code; my test class inherits from django.utils.unittest.TestCase (I have also tried django.test.testcases.TestCase; but no joy):</p>

<pre><code>admin_user_profile = self._create_user_profile()

browser_client = Client()
response = browser_client.get(self.LIST_USERS_URL)
self.assertTrue(HttpResponse.status_code, response.status_code)

logging.debug(response._headers) #prints {'content-type': ('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8'), 'location': ('Location', 'http://testserver/api/v1/users/?username=user&amp;api_key=1681f96d50ba54b410c91365a678ec07b6375efc')}

<p>I would like my DLL to be ""xcopy-deployable"" to any directory. I would also like not to require adding this directory to the path.</p>

<p>If I just build the DLL the usual way, Windows will refuse to load the DLL, since it cannot find the DLLs next to the current process.</p>

<p>Are there any good options for helping Windows locate the DLL?</p>

<hr>

<p>To answer some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The DLL is written in C++.</li>
<li>The extra DLLs are QT-dlls. </li>
<li>I would like to place the extra DLLs in the same folder as my plugin DLL. I can get the name of that folder from <code>GetModuleFileName</code>.</li>
<li>The application is Firefox, the DLL is a PKCS#11 security module.</li>
<li>The application loads the DLL using the full path to the DLL (the user supplies it when installing the plugin).</li>
<li>Requiring that the DLLs be placed in System32 or next to the application would work, but it is a bit messy and could cause problems with uninstallers.</li>
<li><code>LoadLibrary</code> and <code>GetProcAddress</code> would of course work, but is not really feasible in my case. I am using hundreds, if not thousands, of methods in the other DLLs. I really need to use the import-libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had thought about using delay-loaded dlls combined with <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686203%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>SetDllDirectory</code></a> in DllMain. Have anyone tried anything like this?</p>

I'm guessing it could be done by checking the length of the data frame, making a list of the respective length in steps of 1. Then use that list to reference which cell is being analysed against the rest of the column. though I don't know how to implement that. 
eg.

I currently need to increase the performance of some parts by parallelizing some functions that are independent. Since DataContext is not thread-safe, I cannot use it inside of the newly created threads. Therefore, I created a new DataContext inside each thread and disposed it at the end of the thread.</p>

<p>Everything goes fine with the new datacontext, but I have a problem that one of the inputs of the function is an IQueryable that is attached to the Global DataContext. Running the method will result an exception of ""There is already an open DataReader associated with this Command which must be closed first.""</p>

<p>The question is, how would I be able to run the IQueryable with the new data context instead of the changed one.</p>

<p>Kindly find below a sample code for the threads:</p>

<pre><code>var myQueryable = Global.DataContext.Customers.Where(a =&gt; a.Age &lt;12);

ParallelLoopResult threads = Parallel.ForEach(groups, group =&gt;
        {
            DataContext ctx = new DataContext(Const.ConnectionString);
            myFunction(myQueryable);
            ctx.Dispose();
        });
</code></pre>

<p>The option of re-writing the myQueryable inside of the thread is unfortunately quite difficult as there is a big amount of logic to generate it. Converting it to list and then passing it is also not an option as the query returns thousands of entries and would affect the performance negatively.</p>

<p>Any help is highly appreciated</p>
