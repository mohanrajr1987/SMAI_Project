When db file is in the same folder as my php script it runs ok, but when I place it somewhere else - silent fail.</p>

<p>I've written up a simple checker so it would be easier to understand what I mean</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$files = array(
   'data.db',
    getcwd() . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'data.db',
   'some_inner_folder' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'data.db',
    getcwd() . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'some_inner_folder' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'data.db'
);

foreach($files as $file) {
    if(file_exists($file))
        echo $file, ' found&lt;br/&gt;';
    else
        echo $file, ' not found!&lt;br/&gt;';
    try {
        $db = new PDO('sqlite:host=' . $file);
        if($db)
            echo 'connection to ', $file, ' made succesfully&lt;br/&gt;';
    } catch (PDOException $error) {
        echo 'error connecting to ', $file, ' error message: ', $error-&gt;getMessage(), '&lt;br/&gt;';
    }
    $db = null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output turned out to be:</p>

<pre><code>data.db found
connection to data.db made succesfully
C:\Web\data.db found
error connecting to C:\Web\data.db error message: SQLSTATE[HY000] [14] unable to open database file

C:\Web\some_inner_folder\data.db found
error connecting to C:\Web\some_inner_folder\data.db error message: SQLSTATE[HY000] [14] unable to open database file
</code></pre>

<p>C:\Web\data.db and C:\Web\some_inner_folder\data.db has the same contents (file copy&amp;paste)</p>

<p>PHP Version 5.3.6, Windows 7 x64</p>

<p>PDO drivers mysql, sqlite, sqlite2</p>

<p>SQLite Library  3.7.4</p>

<p>I'm not really seeing why it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Problem solved</p>

<pre><code>$db = new PDO('sqlite:host=' . $file);
</code></pre>

<p>should read like this:</p>

<pre><code>$db = new PDO('sqlite:' . $file);
</code></pre>

<p>Turns out pdo_sqlite doesn't need 'host='</p>

However, unlike a standard form, whenever these inputs are changed, I fire off an AJAX request to save that individual field. My AJAX endpoint basically looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def update_field(request, mod_id, field, value, element_id):
    mod = Model.objects.get(id=mod_id)
    setattr(mod, field, value)
    mod.save()

<p>Is there a way to validate this, given some input <code>value</code> and some field name on the model <code>field</code>?</p>

This connection was made in storyboard via ctrl-drag from VC1 to VC2. When the segue is performed, the app freezes and I see the CPU peg to 100% and memory usage start climbing rapidly. I started out with a custom VC2 and saw that viewWillAppear was called and the table delegate methods such as numberOfRowsInSection were being executed properly.</p>

<p>In an attempt to narrow down the problem I can see that even a vanilla UITableViewController (no custom controller class) as VC2 has the same problem. But when I set VC2 as just a vanilla UIViewController (not table), it segues fine.</p>

I have several independent tracks as input, that I read from separate files on disk. I then mix these, apply some processing, and spit out a buffer with the resulting audio. The problem I am having is that of disk IO speed. For the current test I am performing, I have about 10 tracks that are read simultaneously from disk. Each track is in raw PCM, 48000 HZ 16 bit stereo. This means that there is a significant amount of data that needs to be read as quickly as possible. I have tried both simple fread calls as well as memory mapped files through Boost, but the issue is the same. When a file is first opened, it usually causes the audio to break up (presumably while the file is read into cache by the OS). After that, everything runs smoothly without a glitch. For the time being I use one thread per file in the common case, sometimes two files per thread. It is usually when I have two files per thread that the stalling/breakup of the stream occurs. Note that I do not know in advance which input files that need to be played, as this is controlled by the user. So my problem is how to read these initial blocks in such a way so that I don't get stalling/breakup. Also, when a new file is loaded it is not necessarily in the beginning that the reading must start.</p>

<p>I have a few thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can we prefetch the files into cache by reading all of them once at startup but disregarding the data? I cannot store all of it in memory. But it seems bad to rely on internal behavior of the OS's read cashe, especially since this is cross platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Can we use a format such as Ogg Vorbis for compression, load the compressed data fully into memory and then decode on the fly? I am thinking that decoding 10 or more Vorbis streams might be too CPU intensive, but I have no benchmarks yet. At least in this way we turn it from an I/O bound task to a CPU bound one.</p></li>
<li><p>Can we do any other kind of clever buffering approach to make it so that the large reads are more equally distributed? I know very little about how I might accomplish that.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am stuck at this point, and would appreciate any suggestions that might improve throughput.</p>

When it visits a page, it pulls all the links on that page (that satisfy conditions, blah blah) and adds them to the queue of pages to visit. I don't want the crawler to visit the same page twice. My current solution is clunky: when a page is visited, I add the URL to a list of visited pages (so moves from queue to list). Then, when I go to visit a next page, I recursively 'pop' off links from the queue until I get one that is not in the list of previously visited pages.

Running Ubuntu Server 13.04 with LAMP and Magento Commerce 1.7.0.2 on a dedicated home server. I've already configured my server's static IP, router's firewall and port forwarding, and am running ddclient on my server to sync my router's dynamic IP with namecheap.com (my domain name and nameserver provider).</p>

<p>When I use a static index.html page, the page loads from my localhost using my server's static IP. The page also loads on the WAN using my router's IP and domain name (through either a proxy website or on my smartphone cell network). Using the proxy website helps avoid loopback timeouts. This narrows down the issue to Magento.</p>

<p>While using http://{localhostIP}/ as my base URL in Magento and loading Magento's index.php, I was able to access the file locally with my server's static IP. But, when accessing Magento over the WAN using my domain name or router's IP, it says ""not available, HTTP Error 504: Gateway Timeout"".</p>

<p>So then I tried adding my domain name as a base URL in Magento. Now I can access Magento over the WAN but not the LAN. Did anyone figure out a way to resolve this issue? Is this related to loopback?</p>

<p>The only two threads I could find on the issue haven't been resolved or updated recently:

"24460772","1","24498005","","2014-06-27 21:05:59","","2","294","<p>I've had issues with AutoMapper 3 mapping related entities from entity framework to a view model some of the time in MVC 5.  I'm using EF 6.1.1 to get the data, and a thin and light repository layer to centralize queries. That issue only seems to occur with mapping properties from entities under a root entity, but the problem is intermittent.  I've seen the behavior start working again after rebuilding the solution and the behavior break after rebuilding the solution without changing the code where the issue occurs.</p>

<p>I've tested this in the debugger and SQL profiler, and even when the data isn't showing up on the front end, I can see in the SQL profiler that Entity Framework is loading the related tables.</p>

<p><strong>Example mapping with the issue</strong></p>

<p>This code executes in the MVC controller after the data has been queried from the repository layer. The view model will then be passed off to the view for rendering.</p>

<pre><code>Mapper.CreateMap&lt;Event, EventViewModel&gt;()
    .ForMember(e =&gt; e.EventTitleId, opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(x =&gt; x.EventTitleType.EventTitleId));
EventViewModel model = Mapper.Map&lt;Event, EventViewModel&gt;(eventItem);

//Fix Up I had to implement to ensure the data gets into the property
model.EventTitleId = eventItem.EventTitleType.EventTitleId;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Another example mapping with the issue</strong></p>

<p>Same basic execution path under a different controller action, same problem.</p>

<pre><code>Mapper.CreateMap&lt;Event, EventViewModel&gt;()
    .ForMember(l =&gt; l.EventTitle, opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(x =&gt; x.EventTitleType.EventTitle.Title))
    .ForMember(l =&gt; l.EventType, opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(x =&gt; x.EventTitleType.LkEventType.Title))
    .ForMember(l =&gt; l.LocationName, opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(x =&gt; x.LkLocation.LocationName));
IEnumerable&lt;EventViewModel&gt; eventList = Mapper.Map&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Event&gt;, IEnumerable&lt;EventViewModel&gt;&gt;(events);
</code></pre>

<p>Again, sometimes the three properties get data, and sometimes they don't.</p>

<p><strong>Data Model</strong></p>

<p>This is what the Data Model looks like.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ati3y.png"" alt=""The part of the edmx file with the data model for this question""></p>

<p><strong>Repository</strong></p>

<p>The repository layers wraps up the entity framework calls, but it does not abstract away the entity framework entities and the issues and benefits it has.  All repositories in the project inherit IRepository, and I'm using this layer to centralize query and business logic.</p>

<pre><code>using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Tools.Repository
{
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Generic Repository Interface
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;typeparam name=""TClass""&gt;Class that the Repository is implemented for.&lt;/typeparam&gt;
    public interface IRepository&lt;TClass&gt;
        where TClass : class 
    {
        void SaveChanges();
        TClass Find(params object[] keyValues);
        IEnumerable&lt;TClass&gt; GetAll();
        TClass Add(TClass itemToAdd);
        TClass Update(TClass itemToUpdate);
        TClass Remove(TClass itemToDelete);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I don't believe this is an Entity Framework lazy loading issue, and after forcing EF to eager load the data, the problem persists.  The entities have the values in the debugger before mapping, but only sometimes will the value get mapped to the view model.  The most frustrating thing is that the issue does not seem to be caused by any changes I've made to the view model.</p>

<p>What can cause such inconsistent behavior?  I've had this problem with both AutoMapper 3.2.1 and 3.1.1.</p>

"7100657","1","7101707","","2011-08-17 23:14:17","","0","413","<p>I am currently working on integrating a prototype product I made into a larger program. What I did in the prototype was create a HTTP server on a microcontroller, and then wrote some HTML to call .cgi functions on the web-server. This was so I could control I/O on the micro controller via an ethernet. </p>

<p>My html seems very straight forward, to call a cgi function on the microcontroller I have made buttons with the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
function my_confirm(a){
  var r=confirm(""Are you sure you'd like to run ""+a+""?"");
  if (r==true)  
    location.href = a;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;button type = ""button"" onclick="" my_confirm('started.cgi')"" &gt;Started&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>additionally, if i were to type in ""169.254.129.12/started.cgi"" into a web browser, the microcontroller would respond appropriately. Now that the prototype is completed ahead of schedule, my new task is to integrate my controls into a C++/CLI program. GREAT. I have never written in C++... </p>

<p>Rather than re-doing all of the backend stuff, I would like to add a menu to send similiar requests. Over the last 4-5 days I have gotten a menu in VS2005 and have had limited success, with the code below:</p>

<pre><code>int sendHttpRequestAndRespond(System::Uri^ url){
    if(url-&gt;Scheme == System::Uri::UriSchemeHttp){
        HttpWebRequest^ request = dynamic_cast&lt;HttpWebRequest^&gt;(WebRequest::Create(url));
        request-&gt;Method = System::Net::WebRequestMethods::Http::Get;
        return 0;
    }
    //HttpWebResponse^ response = dynamic_cast&lt;HttpWebResponse^&gt; (request-&gt;GetResponse());
    //RequestState^ state = gcnew RequestState();
    //state-&gt;request = request;
    //try{
    //  IAsyncResult^ response = dynamic_cast&lt;IAsyncResult^&gt; (request-&gt;BeginGetResponse(gcnew AsyncCallback( responseReceived),state));
    //}
    //catch(WebException^ e){}
    else
        return -1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the code written as shown above(with comments present) the I/O control of the microcontroller does not operate properly. Oddly, if I put in the HttpWebResponse line, things (sometimes) go properly, and other times, nothing seems to happen. Lastly, if I use the AsyncResponse, things are similiar to if I use the HttpWebResponse portion.</p>

<p>Now my thought/understanding was that merely putting in the request via the GET method I am using in the code shown above would initiate the I/O control on the microcontroller, but it seems the response plays a role in it as well.</p>

<p>Do any of you have a better route to go with this? At this point I am highly confused/frustrated and open to any advice! Thank you,</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1: UPDATED CODE:</strong></p>

<pre><code>int sendHttpRequestAndRespond(System::Uri^ url){
    if(url-&gt;Scheme == System::Uri::UriSchemeHttp){
        HttpWebRequest^ request = dynamic_cast&lt;HttpWebRequest^&gt;(WebRequest::Create(url));
        request-&gt;Method = System::Net::WebRequestMethods::Http::Get;
        RequestState^ state = gcnew RequestState();
        state-&gt;request = request;
        try{
                IAsyncResult^ response = dynamic_cast&lt;IAsyncResult^&gt; (request-&gt;BeginGetResponse(gcnew AsyncCallback( responseReceived),state));
            }
        catch(WebException^ e){}
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>With this code I get into my callback function (responseReceived) the first two times I call the function, but never on the 3rd or further time. I am testing this with <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com</a>, as this seems to work for my CGI calling, but only the first two times as well.
Thanks,</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2: Resolution and new problems!</strong>
Okay, I figured out my problem was due mostly to not ending the requests. In the callBack function I wasn't ending the request, and HTTP protocol has a 2 connections/ip restriction, making the first two calls work, but future ones wouldn't. </p>

<p>Now my new issue is that on the asyc call I a using, it first does synchronous DNS resolution. Since I am sending these commands to an embedded computer with an IP, there's no DNS inbetween, and the function blocks for a long time. Once my computer realizes there's been a DNS resolution error, it fires off the request any ways, and it works! Subsequent requests work instantly, as there's a cache that remembers the failure. </p>

<p>So im about 99% of the way there, but I need to fix this first time lockup some how. My current ideas are:</p>

<p>Somehow disable dns resolution before the request</p>

<p>Shorten the dns resolution timeout from 60+ seconds to 1ish seconds</p>

<p>trick my comptuer/the computer the program runs on into thinking that <a href=""http://169.254.129.12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://169.254.129.12</a>  has an ip address of 169.254.129.12 (local host file??)</p>

<p>I am not sure how to accomplish those, or if there are better ideas??</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Any better ideas?</p>

<p>So far so good (I think so, if you have any comments on this class please go ahead). To initialize this class I should provide a key. My question would be - How should I manage this key?</p>

<p>To be more specific:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I create it using a specific technique?</li>
<li>Where should I store it? In a properties file? in the DB? somewhere in my code?</li>
<li>should this key (we are talking about a string here, right?) be encrypted and then decrypted once it is loaded or used? If so how should I do that?</li>

<pre><code>var bitmap = new Bitmap(1024, 720);

string oldBase = """";

using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
using (var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap))
{
    graphics.CopyFromScreen(bounds.X, bounds.Y, 0, 0, bounds.Size);
    bitmap.Save(stream, ImageFormat.Jpeg);
    string newBase = Convert.ToBase64String(stream.ToArray());

    // ! Do compare/replace stuff here with newBase and oldBase !

    // Store the old image as a base64 string.
    oldBase = newBase;
}

<p>Using something like this I could compare both base64 strings and replace any matches. The matched text could be replaced with something like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[number of characters replaced]</p>

<p>That way, on the client side I know where to replace the old data and add the new. Again, I'm not sure if this would even work so anyones thoughts on this would be very appreciated. :) If it is possible, could you point me in the right direction? Thanks.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is because the WebDriverJS queue gets stalled when a test fails. <strong>Is there any way to fix this?</strong> It's sub-optimal even for local command-line testing, and it makes running tests automatically and/or in the background difficult-to-impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I think I can fix the queue failure by instantiating a new client for every test, but this would make things much slower (as the WebDriver instance would need to start up from scratch each time) and would leave WebDriver processes hanging around unkilled on test failure. Ideally, I'd like something like the structure offered by <a href=""https://github.com/LearnBoost/soda"">Soda</a>, where a failure somewhere in the queue skips to the end of the queue and then throws the error for the test framework to catch.</p>

<p>Explanation of what is working:
     I have a list on the left of the webpage where a user can press + button to append a view to the .viewSpace.</p>

<p>When the user presses + </p>

<pre><code>angular.element(document.getElementById('viewSpace')).append($compile(""&lt;div my-graph&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"")(scope));
</code></pre>

<p>is called.  my-graph is a directive that uses a template which looks like </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=""MyGraphController"" id=""{{viewId}}""&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>viewId being and created on instantiation, that id is passed to a service which keeps track of views and broadcasts changes so that the left view can know to update the list with a new - button to remove elements that have just been added.  The remove directive looks like:</p>

<pre><code>app.directive(""removeView"", function($compile){
    return function(scope, element, attrs){
        element.bind(""click"", function(){
            var id = '#'+attrs.removeView; // id of view to remove when clicked
            console.log('Removing', id);
            angular.element(id).parent().remove();
            //angular.element(document.getElementById(attrs.tseRemoveView)).remove();
            $compile("".viewSpace"");
        });
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>and graph controller cconsists of a destroy function.</p>

<pre><code>chartApp.controller('MyGraphController', function ($scope, $interval, controllerService) {
    $scope.cid = controllerService.getCurrentControllerId();
    $scope.viewId = controllerService.createViewId($scope.cid);
    controllerService.bindToViewList($scope.viewId, ""Linear Graph"");// for view communication.

    $scope.$on(""$destroy"", function() { // never gets called.
        console.log('destroying cid', $scope.cid);
        resetGraph(); // the intervals will persist after controller instance is destroyed, so take care of them onDestroy
        controllerService.removeBindToViewList($scope.viewId, ""Linear Graph"");
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Problem: the graph disappears from the DOM but the scope remains, and the destroy function never gets called.  Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>chartApp.directive('myGraph', function($rootScope, $window) {
    return {
        restrict: 'EA',
        templateUrl: 'myGraph.tpl.html',
        scope: {}, 
        link: function(scope, elem, attrs) {
            elem.on('$destroy', function(){// does get called though
                alert('elem destroyed');
            });
        }
    };

<p>The .xlsm that I am working with has a couple of controls that I need to manipulate from C#, specifically checkboxes and an active-x combobox. I haven't been able to figure out how to access those controls! In VBA, I can access these controls from inside the <code>Worksheet</code> object, like retrieving the checkbox collection with <code>ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(1).Checkboxes</code>or selecting an item in a combobox named ""dropdown_change"" with <code>ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(1).dropdown_change.ListIndex = 1</code></p>

<p>How do I access and manipulate these controls from C#? Drilling down in the intellisense for a <code>_Worksheet</code> object reveals a <code>CheckBoxes</code> method and a <code>DropDowns</code>method but both are ""reserved for internal use.""</p>

<ol>
<li>Office is creating a Wic based bitmap, using <code>CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget</code>.</li>
<li>Using this Render Target, Office uses various drawing methods. It wraps those calls with BeginDraw/EndDraw as expected.</li>
<li>Office uses DrawGlyphRun method to draw the text of the document on the Wic bitmap (i.e. the This pointer of DrawGlyphRun is the one returned from CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget).</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point I'm confused how Office continue. So my question is:</p>

<p><strong>What are the various possible ways to copy a Wic based Render Target to the screen?</strong></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that at the end, Office is using a swap chain (probably craeted with <code>CreateSwapChain</code> on Windows 7 and <code>CreateSwapChainForHwnd</code> on Windows 8). I'm stepping through various ""suspicous"" functions such as <code>CreateBitmapFromWicBitmap</code> and <code>CreateBitmapFromDxgiSurface</code>) - but I don't understand the complete chain of API calls.</p>

<p>EDIT (answer to MooseBoys):
This is NOT a general question for putting pixels on the screen. The pixels are already on one RenderTarget (A render target that was created with CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget, and then has been drawn with BeginDraw/DrawGlyphRun/EndDraw) and I now want to move those pixes to another RenderTarget (a render target on the actual screen).
On the GDC world, I would look for something like BitBlt, to move pixels from one hdc to another. I wonder what is the protocol in the D2D world.</p>

<p>Some of those catch lines have <code>e.printStackTrace();</code> while some of them don't.</p>

<p>I'm looking at SpringAOP to create some JoinPoints and PointCuts to handle that.
Is there anyway for me to actually log the exception being caught without the function throwing out an exception?</p>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve here is whenever I have a 'catch' line, I would like to log the stacktrace of the exception on that catch line.</p>

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p>Here is one of my existing Aspects.
This logs all the method calls made:</p>

<pre><code>@Aspect
@Component
public class MethodCallAspect {

    private static DebugManager logger = DebugManager.getInstance(MethodCallAspect.class);

    @Before(""execution(* com.cistera..*(*))"")
    public void loggingAdvice(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        StringBuilder methodCall = new StringBuilder(joinPoint.getTarget().getClass().toString()).append("" - "").append(joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
        logger.debug(methodCall.toString());
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>PS: I could go into each class and log the stacktrace from each 'catch' line but that will be a pain having to update a lot of code.</p>

.wrapper {

.sidebar {
  position: absolute;
  width: 135px;
  background-color: #AB1917;
height: 100%;
right: 0;
}

.content {
  background: #FFF;

  transform: translate3d(-135px,0,0);
  transition: transform .3s;
}

.content.isOpen {
  transform: translate3d(0px,0,0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the js:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('.button').on('click', function() {
    $('.content').toggleClass('isOpen');
  });
});
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I have tried specifying a height for the header and even using a sticky nav plugin to make it fixed; however none of those has worked. And I am not sure what to do anymore.</p>

I am developing an application and the menu is dynamically created by the user's role</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
In my application I need the user to enter their credentials with these recovered data on user role and build the dynamic menu for the role. 
My main screen is:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LH6Az.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>in my _Layout.cshtml I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>@if (Request.IsAuthenticated){
        Html.Partial(""Menu"");
    } else { 
        &lt;div class=""sectiontitle""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I create a base controller:</p>

<pre><code>public class BaseController : Controller
{
    public BaseController(){
        ViewBag.Menu = BuildMenu();
    }

    private IList&lt;Models.AdmMenu&gt; BuildMenu()
    {      
            IList&lt;Models.AdmMenu&gt; mmList = new List&lt;Models.AdmMenu&gt;(){
            new Models.AdmMenu(){ Id = 1, Name = ""Home"", ParentId = 0, SortOrder = 1} ,
            new Models.AdmMenu(){ Id = 2, Name = ""Admin"", ParentId = 0, SortOrder = 1},
            new Models.AdmMenu(){ Id = 3, Name = ""Account"", ParentId = 0, SortOrder = 1},
            .....
            .....
</code></pre>

<p>And in my controller raLoginController.cs I have this:</p>

<pre><code>public class raLoginController : BaseController{                
    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult Login(Models.AdmLogin login){
        if (ModelState.IsValid){
            Servicio.cSeReclamo Servicio = new Servicio.cSeReclamo(login.UserName, login.Password);
            if (Servicio.ValidarUsuario()){
                string Mensaje = """";
                Models.AdmUsuario oAdmUsuario = new Models.AdmUsuario();
                oAdmUsuario.Au_codusuario = login.UserName;
                Servicio.RetornaEntidad&lt;Models.AdmUsuario&gt;(ref Mensaje, ""admsis.adm_usuario"", oAdmUsuario.getPk(), oAdmUsuario);                                      
                FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(login.UserName, false);  

                var ticket = new FormsAuthenticationTicket(1,
                    login.UserName,
                    DateTime.Now,
                    DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30),
                    false,
                    LoadData(oAdmUsuario,Servicio.Pais(ref Mensaje))
                );

                string encTicket = FormsAuthentication.Encrypt(ticket);
                HttpCookie faCookie = new HttpCookie(FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName, encTicket);

                if (ticket.IsPersistent) {
                    faCookie.Expires = ticket.Expiration;
                }
                Response.Cookies.Add(faCookie);
                return RedirectToAction(""index"", ""raMainReclamo"", new { area = ""Reclamos""});
            }
        }
        return View(login);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In Menu.cshtml (Partial View)</p>

<pre><code> @{
    List&lt;Crd.Web.Models.AdmMenu&gt; menuList = ViewBag.Menu;       
}
&lt;div class=""sectiontitle""&gt;     
&lt;ul class=""menu"" id=""header""&gt;  
    @foreach (var mp in menuList.Where(p =&gt; p.ParentId == 0))
    {    
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;@mp.Name&lt;/a&gt; 
        @if (menuList.Count(p =&gt; p.ParentId == mp.Id) &gt; 0)
        {
            @:&lt;ul&gt;
        }          
        @RenderMenuItem(menuList, mp)       
        @if (menuList.Count(p =&gt; p.ParentId == mp.Id) &gt; 0)
        {
            @:&lt;/ul&gt;
        }       
        &lt;/li&gt;
    }
&lt;/ul&gt;   
&lt;/div&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>But when I enter the credentials have the following error:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFOI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>menulist is equal a null, why? I am following the code step by step, enters BaseController and execute BuildMenu method... why null?
I have this message:

<p>How to resolve this problem?</p>

<p>i build websocket head this way:</p>

<pre><code>   char BufferToSend[1028]; //+4 bytes for websocket head

   BufferToSend[0]=130; // 10000010
   BufferToSend[1]=126; // 01111110 first bit 0 means unmask message
   BufferToSend[2] = //  2 bytes for payload size
   BufferToSend[3] = //
   BufferToSend[4] = // payload starts
   .....
   // sending data to browser
   WSASend(Socket, &amp;wsabuf,1,&amp;dwSendNumBytes..); //wsabuf refers to BufferToSend
</code></pre>

<p>The first byte (10000010) consist of first bit 'fin' set to 1, three reserved bits and the opcode '0010' for binary frames. I always set 'fin' bit to 1, which means it is final frame, because i assume that WSAsend send buffer to browser at once in one piece. But what if WSAsend needs to be call more then one time to send all buffer? If two Wsasend calls going to happen, in first call should i set fin to 0(part of message) and in second call to 1(final frame)?. Futhermore I build websocket head before calling WSasend(I don't know one or more times), how do i know when set fin bit to 1 or 0?</p>

<p>thanks in advance for help.</p>

<p>So I am trying to loop through the <code>enum</code>s to pass the names to the <code>Eval</code> method.</p>

<p>This is in <code>ItemTemplate</code> section of my Repeater control.</p>

<pre><code>Line 57:  &lt;tr class=""ProductRow"" data-id=""&lt;%# Eval(""Id"") %&gt;""&gt;
Line 58:      &lt;% foreach (var column in (ImportColumns[])Enum.GetValues(typeof(ImportColumns))) { %&gt;

<p>But line 59 gives me the following error.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CS0103: The name 'column' does not exist in the current context</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why doesn't the code recognize the <code>column</code> variable? I'm guessing it either has something to do with the fact that I'm in a repeater control or that I'm missing <code>&lt;% %&gt;</code> code and <code>&lt;%# %&gt;</code>, but it seems like this should work.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I see that if I change line 59.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;%= column.ToString() %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is no error. (Although it no longer does what I need.)</p>

<p>So this has something to do with <code>Eval</code> that prevents ""regular"" variables from working. Does anyone know of a workaround to this?</p>

The @Controller annotation must be there.

<ul>
<li><p>assumption:
dynamic form builder, users can create form with structure which is not known.</p></li>
<li><p>solution:
Form submission, data will be stored in a 2 table structure:</p>

<ol>
<li>FormSubmissionHeader table that will store some basic data about the submission(formid,userid,datetime,etc)</li>
<li>FormSubmissionFieldsData(FormSubmissionHeaderID ,FIELDID,FIELDVALUE)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>My problem with this solution is with mass usage: 
Assuming i got 1 million users,
each user will have 3 forms
each form will have 10 fields
and each form will have  5 submissions per day.</p>

<p>So the FormSubmissionHeader  will grow in 1 million X3X5 per day = 15 million rows per day.</p>

<p>and FormSubmissionFieldsData wil grow by 15X10 (number of daily submission, double number of fields) , meaning 150 million rows per day.</p>

<p>So based on this solution :</p>

<p>I dont see how it is going to work.</p>

<p>I see two alternatives :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>use MONGODB  to store submissions header and data (NO SQL)</p></li>
<li><p>dynamically create table per form and store the data directly there with 
relevant datatypes per field.</p></li>

Already tried setting the frame/center of the objects, but they didn't move.</p>

<p>I have an array which holds the button outlets, and arrange them in a for loop.
Is there any suggestion?</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>Here's some code(not the whole, but the rest is irrelevant now), how I loop through the buttons. Button outlets already set properly. The title of the buttons changes properly, also I can hide/show the buttons, but not the position.</p>

<p>If I'll just try some dummy code like: 
<code>tempBtn.frame = CGRectMake(100.0, 200.0, 60.0, 40.0);</code>
nothing changes(but I suspect all the 6 buttons should be at the same position)</p>

<p>All my repositories depend on a <code>DbContext</code> (unit of work) which I have used the MVC3 integration library to configure as <code>InstancePerHttpRequest()</code> so that the unit of work is shared between repositories for each request.</p>

<p>I've looked at some applications that use Autofac and I have noticed that they're setting the lifetime of their repositories as <code>SingleInstance()</code> (singleton). Is this correct?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I can understand that we don't really need multiple repository classes but if we're creating a single instance of a repository then that surely means that there is only one reference to a <code>DbContext</code>. In my repository implementation it accesses the <code>DbContext</code> as a class member e.g. <code>_dbContext.Set&lt;T&gt;</code> blah....</p>

<p>So <code>_dbContext</code> must have a reference to some object in memory. How is it possible for two separate requests to come along, have a unique <code>DbContext</code> but share the same repository?</p>

<p>Have I missed something to do with the way DI works?</p>

I am trying to build an element that the user can ""grab"" and then rotate. I have it working except for one last feature I can't seem to figure out:
<a href=""http://codepen.io/megakoresh/pen/WbLLzZ?editors=001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/megakoresh/pen/WbLLzZ?editors=001</a></p>

<p>(it's long, but I am only asking about how the snapTo() function should work).</p>

<p>What I want is for the object snap to degrees based on the <code>increments</code> value. This means that if <code>snap==true</code>, the code should calculate the closest estimated <code>target</code>s to the point of release of the mouse and based on the direction of rotation smoothly rotate the object to that <code>target</code> rotation:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VYL6I.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Since the object is 'grabbed', I calculate the offset at mousedown to object's current rotation, thats where it comes from, so it doesn't just snap to mouse.</p>

<p>So in this case the user rotates the object clockwise and releases the mouse when the objects rotation is between 90° and 45°. Since the direction (identified by the sign of <code>angle</code> variable) was positive, the target will be after the Current rotation.</p>

<p>The task is to calculate that target and then smoothly rotate the object to it.</p>

<p>The function I have written for it is based on by autoSpin() function (executes when <code>spin==false</code>), which takes a flipped time exponent multiplier <code>delta</code> (calculated from the time elapse since mouse was released). <code>delta</code> will decrease along a flipped exponent as time passes and so the angle slows down.</p>

<p>There is spinTo() function, please don't judge me I have a feeling it is very stupid:</p>

<pre><code>function snapTo() {      
    var elapsed, delta;    
    increments = (typeof increments === 'number') ? Math.floor(increments) : 4;    
    var ia = 360 / increments; //increment angle - snapping points should occur ""every ia degrees""
    if (Math.abs(angle % ia) &gt; 0) { //if user turned for more than 1 increment
      var a = lastRot % ia; //check the distance from 
      if (angle &gt; 0){ //positive direction
        amplitude = 50; //if snapping is on, force amplitude
        target = (lastRot - a) + ia;
      }
      if (angle &lt; 0){ //negative direction        
        amplitude = -50;
        target = lastRot - a;
      } 
    } else { //cancel the rotation
      target = rotation;
    }    
    elapsed = Date.now() - timestamp; //time passed since mouse was released
    delta = -amplitude * Math.exp(-elapsed / timeConstant); //the greater the time from mouse release, the smaller this value
    if (delta &gt; 0.5 || delta &lt; -0.5) { //while delta is decreasing...         
      rotate(target - delta - offset); 
      snapFrame = requestAnimationFrame(snapTo); //keep rotation
    } else {                
      rotate(target - offset); //when enough time passes (based on timeConstant), make one final rotation and stop
    }     
  }

I've a table ""Orders"", that could be accessed by two separate processes at the same time to check a status of a record and update it depending on the value from the row.
Both processes call the same query before proceeding to the Update query:
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE id=1 AND paid='FALSE' LIMIT 1</p>

<p>Both processes get the row and start an Update process that lead to duplicate update procedures by initiating an Update on this table first:
UPDATE Orders SET paid='TRUE' WHERE id=1 LIMIT 1</p>

<p>How to correctly isolate the transaction in InnoDB, so no duplicate procedures are made and hence second process gets no job to perform?
I was thinking about SELECT FOR UPDATE, but if first process already started to work with the row, do I have how to perform general SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE id=1 AND paid='FALSE' LIMIT 1 and if it gets a row, then execute the same SELECT FOR UPDATE to lock a row/table?</p>

I have to sync large files across some machines. The files can be up to 6GB in size. The sync will be done manually every few weeks. I cant take the filename into consideration because they can change anytime. </p>

<p>My plan is to create checksums on the destination PC and on the source PC and than copy all files with a checksum, which are not already in the destination, to the destination.
My first attempt was something like this:</p>

<pre><code>using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

private static string GetChecksum(string file)
{
    using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead(file))
    {
        SHA256Managed sha = new SHA256Managed();
        byte[] checksum = sha.ComputeHash(stream);
        return BitConverter.ToString(checksum).Replace(""-"", String.Empty);
    }
}

- with SHA256 with a 1,6 GB File -> 20 minutes<br>
- with MD5 with a 1,6 GB File -> 6.15 minutes</p>

<p>Here are examples of what I see.</p>

<p>Constant =<code>100</code></p>

<p>Constant =<code>Facility</code></p>

<p>Formula cell <code>=INDIRECT(ADDRESS(5,MATCH($A7&amp;$B7&amp;C$2,Data!$4:$4,0),,,$A$2))</code></p>

<p>Mixed cell <code>=INDIRECT(""Data!""&amp;ADDRESS(5,MATCH($A7&amp;$B7&amp;C$2,Data!$4:$4,0)))</code></p>

<p><code>""Data!""</code> is the Constant in the mixed cell, in this case the sheet name. If that sheet name ever changed, the formula would break. I have found and am using two conditional formats to highlight cells that are Constants and those that are formulas using this <a href=""http://j-walk.com/ss/excel/usertips/tip045.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">""Identify formulas using Conditional Formatting""</a>. I need to come up with a way to format those cells which contain these Constants inside of formulas.</p>

<p>I have <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18847431/how-to-search-for-in-string-excel"">found this question</a> and tried using <code>=IF(COUNT(SEARCH(CHAR(34),A1,1)),TRUE,FALSE)</code> and <code>FIND()</code> to see if I could check if a cell had double quotes inside of it, but the SEARCH() returns <code>FALSE</code> since it is looking at the cells value and not it's contents. It returns <code>TRUE</code> if the cell contains <code>""Constant""</code> but if it is a formula it returns <code>FALSE</code>, such as if the cell contains <code>=""Constant""</code>.</p>

<p>How can I find Constants inside formulas across a whole worksheet or workbook?</p>

<h2>EDIT*</h2>

<p>Thanks to Sidd's code below I have made a function in a module I can use in conditional formatting to at least highlight cells that contain quotes inside the cells.</p>

<p>First it was GoDaddy's server creating a non-traceable error that closed my WCF connection every 15 seconds on the dot after the first connection/call, regardless if I closed the connection after each call. This was solved after a few weeks of exhausting every solution I possibly could when I finally contacted GoDaddy for the resolve. After a Server Migration, this problem disappeared.</p>

<p>After a few weeks of pulling out my hair over the 15 second connection drop, I get stuck with another non-traceable error... the <strong>""The underlying connection was closed: The connection was closed unexpectedly.""</strong>. At this point, I about gave up WCF and went back to ASMX service's.</p>

<p>The error: <strong>""The underlying connection was closed: The connection was closed unexpectedly.""</strong> is pretty generic and the solutions vary, making it difficult to diagnose/fix. Trace logs don't show jack and for some reason the same error would not occur on my local machine, only on the server. The Server Trace logs wouldn't even show the client call when I would receive this error. Like the call never made it to the WCF Service from the Client.... On top of that, the Client's trace log didn't show anything besides a <strong>""System.Threading._ThreadPoolWaitCallback.PerformWaitCallback(Object)""</strong> erroring, which didn't help.</p>

<p>I've tried everything online as possible solutions or possible ways to provide a more meaningful trace but without luck. Anyone else run into this, without a Trace log that helps?</p>

We are trying to come up with a way to document our project, both the API reference, as well as some additional conceptual documents.  Ideally, all of the documentation would live together in a .chm file that we could distribute with our product.</p>

<p>I was already familiar with Doxygen, as a long time C++ developer.  Someone suggested that I look into Sandcastle as well, but I've run into a few snags.</p>

<p>From a number of other sources, including other posts on this site, it's well known that sandcastle does not support unmanaged C++.  I did find a post that seems to indicate that you can still cram the C++ documentation into sandcastle, by adding the API reference as conceptual topics.  </p>

<p>Using Visual Studio 2010, you can turn on the /doc option in the project settings for your unmanaged C++ project.  This produces .XDC files which studio then compiles into an .xml file that goes along with your lib/dll/exe.  Where I am stuck is that is unclear what exactly you can do with this xml file.  Some pages I've found online suggest that you may be able to use this file for intellisense, but I've never seen that work in unmanaged C++.  I was hopeful that I might be able to use this .xml file in Sandcastle Help File Builder somehow, but I can't find any examples of how that's done online, and every attempt I've made with SHFB has failed. It seems to only want MAML or HTML files if I want to add an existing conceptual help file. </p>

<p>So my question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a way to get my /doc generated .xml file into my SHFB help solution?</li>
<li>If not, what is the point of the /doc option for unmanaged C++?</li>
<li>Is there some kind of transformation I can do on my /doc generated .xml file to produce HTML or MAML which I could then import via SHFB?</li>
</ol>

<p>Can this work, or should I just go back to Doxygen?</p>

<li>Step 1: Install OCaml. I have installed the windows version from <a href=""http://protz.github.io/ocaml-installer/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</li>
<li>Step 1b: I believe step 1 installed Gtk and so on.</li>
<li><p>Step 2b: Run:</p>

<p><code>./configure --prefix C:/windows/path/with/direct/slash &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>4 things about these instructions leave me confused:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Which <code>configure</code> file is this meant to be? If I open the Cygwin terminal, it lands me in the user's home directory, and if I run <code>./configure</code> it says no such file or directory. I think it's meant to refer to one of the configure files in the source, but there are over 10. </p></li>
<li><p>What exactly is <code>C:/windows/path/with/direct/slash</code> meant to point to? Please could someone give me a real example with a good explanation?</p></li>
<li><p>In which directory should I be running the above command (Step 2b) from?</p></li>
<li><p>In which directory should I place the extracted Frama-C source distribution? (And should I just extract the <code>src</code> dir from the archive, or will I need all the contents?)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>All I'm trying to do is follow their ""<a href=""http://frama-c.com/try_out.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Short example</a>"" linked to from their homepage, using the latest version, on Windows 8.1, and I need an ""Absolute Dummies'"" guide for doing so!</strong> </p>

"31172898","1","31174809","","2015-07-01 22:43:36","","1","126","<p>I am building an android application based on the Alt Beacon. I should preface this with the fact that my test device is a Digiland (P-O-S) tablet running android 4.4. </p>

<p>I am using the Radius Networks USB beacon and their Alt Beacon library found here: <a href=""https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library</a></p>

<p>In both my own application and in the reference application provided with the library I am seeing significant instability / extremely slow detection times for the beacon. For example, you can see the  reference application's log below. The tablet is sitting no more than 1/2 meter away from the beacon the whole time.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen this behavior before? Am I doing something wrong? The broadcast rate on the beacon appears to be set to 10Hz and the power seems to be set to maximum. Should I get a different device and try it on that? I saw some other posts suggested turning off the wifi which I did, and this log is from a trial with the wifi off. </p>

<p>One thing I should note is that I have increased the scan frequency with the following block of code in the application subclass:</p>

<pre><code>beaconManager.setBackgroundBetweenScanPeriod(9000l);
beaconManager.setBackgroundScanPeriod(1000l);
beaconManager.setForegroundBetweenScanPeriod(9000l);
beaconManager.setForegroundScanPeriod(1000l);
try{
    beaconManager.updateScanPeriods();
}catch (RemoteException e){
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure if this is done improperly, but when I remove it, I still see the same behavior described in the log below, just over a somewhat longer period of time. </p>

<p>Any advice people have would be much appreciated since I feel like I am spinning my wheels on this!</p>

<p>The 00:07:80 device is my beacon, but I have no idea whatsoever when the 24:4B:03 device is. Does anyone know how I can get more data about this device? Is it possible that it is interfering with my actual signal? I have tried using both</p>

<pre><code>Region region = new Region(""backgroundRegion"",
                Identifier.parse(""2F234454-CF6D-4A0F-ADF2-F4911BA9FFA6""), null, null);
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>Region region = new Region(""backgroundRegion"",null, null, null); 
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately I get this random fluctuation with both variations. </p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I also ran this with the beaconManager.setDebug(true) flag activated. Here is the <a href=""http://gist.github.com/akhalsa/2dec67616e75ebed55ee"" rel=""nofollow"">resulting log</a></p>

<p>UPDATE 2:</p>

<p>I switched my beacon to only broadcast for iBeacon and the problem seemed to go away for about 10 minutes. Unfortunately the problem quickly returned. Looking through the logs, what I am seeing is quite different now. The logs can be seen <a href=""https://gist.github.com/akhalsa/4bcdf1f6b6ad2e12b626"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

I think I found a module that should enable something like this, <a href=""http://drupalmodules.com/module/delegate-menu-administration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupalmodules.com/module/delegate-menu-administration</a></p>

<p>I've followed the instructions, added the role to my user, checked the ""administer some menus"" value for that role and checked the ""Make admin"" field for that role and specific menu in Menus. I also gave the role permissions to change page and story content.</p>

<p>However, it still wont let the user add any new content it creates in any menu, and I get an error message saying ""warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/martin/www/drupal/modules/delegate_menu_admin/delegate_menu_admin.module on line 346.""
Line 346 looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($form['menu']['parent']['#options'] as $key =&gt; $value) {
</code></pre>

<p>I did a <code>print_r($form);</code> in the file just before it and there's no such array that I can see:</p>

<pre><code>[menu] =&gt; Array
        (
            [#access] =&gt; 1
            [delete] =&gt; Array
                (
                    [#access] =&gt; 
                )
        )
</code></pre>

<p>When I gave the role ""administer menu"" permissions, nothing extra was printed at all, leading me to the assumption that the delegate_menu_admin.module file is not used at all while both the ""administer menu"" and the ""administer some menus"" (from the delegate-menu-administration module) permissions are set!</p>

<p>Is this some incompatibility between the module because of some drupal update?
Or am I just too tired and too stupid? :)</p>

Thus points A and B create a ""box"" with a side-length of 10km and C is in the exact center of this box.
This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>        //Distance is 5 kilometers
        float distance = 5;    

        float latCenter = locationInfo.lastLat;
        float lngCenter = locationInfo.lastLong;

        // Calculate corner point distance in lat and long
        float latDelta = distance/110.54f;
        float longDelta = distance/(111.320f(float)Math.cos((double)latCenter));

        // Calculate coordinates of the corner points
        float latA = lat - latDelta;
        float longA = lng - longDelta;
        float latB = lat + latDelta;
        float longB = lng + longDelta;
</code></pre>

<p>I know these are approximations, but approximating with a margin of error of ~1km is fine in my case.
The vertical distance is fine (10.06km) but the horizontal distance is only about 6km instead of 10km.</p>

<p>What is wrong with my formula? I guess its some very simple math error, but I just can't find it. I needed a very simple and quick code, so I based my calculations on this StackOverflow answer: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1253499/simple-calculations-for-working-with-lat-lon-km-distance"">Simple calculations for working with lat/lon + km distance?</a></p>

"8273076","1","8273183","","2011-11-25 18:36:59","","1","46","<p>from writing ABAP programs, the following methodology is known to me as an 'exit' to a program, for this reason I choose the names accordingly.</p>

<p>Suppose you, in .Net,  </p>

<p>1) define an interface</p>

<pre><code>namespace Exits {
    public interface Exit {
       int exitMethod(string s); // signature serves as example only
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) provide some way to the user of your application to pass the name of a user written
assembly <code>ExitImplementation.dll</code> and the name of a class, say <code>myClass : exit</code>, implementing the interface exit, to your application. E.g. as command line parameters or in some form.</p>

<p>You store the name of the user assembly in <code>string assemblyName</code> and the name of the class (including namespace) in <code>string theImplementation</code> and then load it an execute it:</p>

<p>3) </p>

<pre><code>    Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFrom(assemblyName); 
         // assuming assembly is deployed by user into folder where application resides
    Exit theExitImplementation = assembly.CreateInstance(theImplementation) as Exit;

    int k = theExitImplementation.exitMethod(""whatever"");  
</code></pre>

<p>(First question, of minor importance: does this technique have a name outside of the ABAP world, and what is it called? :-) )</p>

<p>What I'd like to know is which risk are you taking by letting your application execute this user code (forgive me in case that's a naive questions, I'm still new to .Net). Let's say the output is only some message code needed to determine some message output to some log. </p>

<p>Assume as deployment scenario some company using the application for doing their business and some employee of that company writing the exit implementation. If that employee wants to cause damage, what would be at risk:</p>

<ol>
<li>nothing but a wrong message in the log?</li>
<li>content of class instances of the application?</li>
<li>resources of the PC the application is running on?</li>
<li>worse?</li>
</ol>

<p>It is my impression the answer is 4. isn't it? myClass gets the oppurtunity to execute and hence can basically do what any application can do which was started by the user who is running the original application. Are there means to prevent this?  </p>

<p>If so: does it make any difference (if so, which), that the signature of the exit is fixed and that the input to the method cannot be changed in the method? 
This method by intention does not allow the type to be defined dynamically. </p>

<p>This method, also by intention, only allows input which cannot be altered.
Assume the string argument is replaced by some other type which the caller could modify, like StringBuilder. Is this increasing the risk?</p>

<p>Are there more sophisticated (standard) techniques to reduce the risk with this approach? Are there alternative approaches?</p>

a) the browser get crashy

<p>I would like some peoples experiences with using the two libraries. Personally I have always used the <a href=""http://loopj.com/android-async-http/"">http://loopj.com/android-async-http/</a> library quite happily. But it was recently suggested to me to use the Volley Framework.</p>

<p>What benefits will I get from one over the other?<br>
From my reading so far, Volley incorporates a number of nice features such as Image Loading, Request Caching, Request Cancelling all in one library.</p>

<p>My current use case / specifications:</p>

<p>Consume web services from my android applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>Receive JSON Objects from web service</li>
<li>Easy To integrate with the GUI</li>
<li>Stability and Reliability over raw performance</li>
<li>Long term maintenance and support of the library.</li>
<li>Ease of use / ease of implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>From some reading up on SE:</p>

<p>""Volley is all good but, On the minus side, it is one undocumented, unsupported, ""throw the code over the wall and do an I|O presentation on it"" library.""</p>

<p>So I think its clear Volley might get the tick for features, But how well documented and maintained is it? If I decide to use it will there still be support for it 4 years down the line?</p>

I want to change the background color and the text color when the cell is highlighted. In my <code>CustomCell</code>'s <code>setHighlighted</code> method, I have the following piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)setHighlighted:(BOOL)highlighted {

I have done some work with requireJs before and always used the r.js build script before deploying.
As I understand the build script which merges all the js files (modules), is to lower the amount of http request and ofcourse provide a way to modulaize your code.</p>

<p><strong>My question is this:</strong> Since typescript already provides an easy way of separating code into modules, why not just merge the 
the resulting js files, instead of the extra step of using requirejs to handle the modules? 
If working on larger projects,  I understand that all js should not be loaded at all at once, but I assume one would still bundle modules in some way.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: To be more specific:</strong>
Why use requireJs for managing my modules and not just stick to typescript internals modules, which as i understood can also be loaded at runtime. Internal modules vs. external modules based on amd and requirejs.</p>

<li><p>I want to find which photo, video, status or other objects I liked in facebook.
Earlier I used fql to search in the like table:</p>

<p><code>SELECT  object_id FROM like WHERE user_id=me() LIMIT 5000</code> </p>

<p>But, in facebook api 2.1, fql is no more supported, so I need to use graph api to replace the above fql.<br>
So, how can I use graph api to get my likes in facebook?  </p></li>
<li><p>And I need to find who posted those objects also. In fql I used:  </p>

<p><code>SELECT uid FROM status WHERE status_id IN (SELECT  object_id FROM like WHERE user_id=me()     LIMIT 5000) ORDER BY uid LIMIT 5000</code>  </p>

<p>I nee Graph api for the above fql also.</p></li>

I've built quite a lot of HTML 5 banner ads using GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform) in my time, but now I am stumped with this ever so slight CSS alignment issue that is driving me nuts and I would like to understand why it is happening on Chrome, but not on Firefox.</p>

<p>I have screenshots to better illustrate the alignment issues:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

%matplotlib inline

data = np.random.randn(100)

fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (11,8.5))
ax.plot(data)

<p>This code works just fine in IPython Notebook V2.4.1 (see <a href=""http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/anonymous/71733c24a68ee464ca40"">http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/anonymous/71733c24a68ee464ca40</a>), but in IPython Notebook v3.0, the axes become invisible (see <a href=""http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/anonymous/7525146b07709206908c"">http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/anonymous/7525146b07709206908c</a>). </p>

<p>Strangely, in V3, when I switch the order of the seaborn import and the matplotlib inline magic, the plot renders normally the first time I run, then if I re-run, the axes and gridlines disappear. So it seems to have something to do with the inline magic disabling seaborn properties.</p>

<p>Any workarounds, other than not re-executing my imports after the first time?</p>

<p>I have an array, as part of a Schema, saved to a database document in Mongoose.  It looks like this, in the Schema:</p>

<pre><code>var GameSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    ...
    PlayerOrder: [Number],
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I call a <code>findOne(...)</code> to get this document from the DB, it works as expected, and I get a result, let's say <code>... [1,2,3,4] ...</code>.</p>

<p>Then, within the callback that's fired on successful <code>findOne(...)</code> execution, I modify some values, including PlayerOrder itself and other values.  I verify before saving to the DB, via console, that the changes were made to the local GameModel object.  <strong>One of these changes is to reverse the PlayerOrder array using `game.PlayerOrder.reverse();'.</strong>  Then I use the GameModel.save(...) function.</p>

<p>Here are some snippets of the code:</p>

<pre><code>if (game.Turn &gt;= game.PlayerCount) {
    console.log('Commuting to Phase 3.');
    game.Phase = 3;
    game.Turn = 0;
    // in phase 3, the player order is reversed; do that here
    console.log('player order before reverse: ' + game.PlayerOrder);
    game.PlayerOrder.reverse();
    // NOTE: this verifies that the array is correctly reversed in the model
    console.log('player order after reverse: ' + game.PlayerOrder);
}

game.save( function (err, game) {
    if (err) console.error(err);

    console.log('+ + + Execution successful; DB updated.');
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when I pull the same document from the DB again, all the changes I made are there.  In other words, after pulling the document I can see that all the changes I made to the document elements, such as player cash, game board state, etc, were all correctly made, and saved in the <code>save(...)</code> function.  EXCEPT for the reversed array, which never gets modified for some reason.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

Like in first two column, the article 419 and 385 same time cited value so they both in table. 
There are two options for me. </p>

<p>First way -> Show only one article and limit 20. So in this way i can see 20 different category-year combination. 
Second way -> Show the same value timecited articles but i have to see 20 different category-year combination. </p>

<p>I am therefore looking to include a small servlet in the webapp to serve its own static content (images, CSS, etc.). The servlet should have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>No external dependencies</li>
<li>Simple and reliable</li>
<li>Support for <a href=""http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1945/58.htm""><code>If-Modified-Since</code></a> header (i.e. custom <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html#getLastModified%28javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest%29""><code>getLastModified</code></a> method)</li>
<li>(Optional) support for gzip encoding, etags,...</li>
</ul>

<p>Is such a servlet available somewhere? The closest I can find is <a href=""http://www.unix.org.ua/orelly/java-ent/servlet/ch04_04.htm#ch04-35758"">example 4-10</a> from the servlet book.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The URL structure I want to use - in case you are wondering - is simply:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
            &lt;servlet-name&gt;main&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
            &lt;servlet-name&gt;default&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/static/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So all requests should be passed to the main servlet, unless they are for the <code>static</code> path. The problem is that Tomcat's default servlet does not take the ServletPath into account (so it looks for the static files in the main folder), while Jetty does (so it looks in the <code>static</code> folder).</p>

I have an ""overview"" of products and other stuff it's in the ""view""-file of the controller. I want to show product-items in a list on an overview page, but in other templates as well (<em>same html-elements but with different values for each product</em>). I don't want to type same thing twice and want to easily maintain the code.</p>

<p>I have this file <em>(views/profile/overview.php</em>) it's basically a for-each loop listing of products - something like:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($items as $item) {
    echo $item-&gt;name;
    echo $item-&gt;creation_date;
}

<p><strong>Is there a way to put</strong> </p>

<pre><code> echo $item-&gt;name;
 echo $item-&gt;creation_date;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>in a single partial view</strong> (like product_item) and load that dynamically?</p>

<p>I've tried: (does not work because $item is undefined in product_item)</p>

<pre><code>foreach($items as $item) {
        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('/profile/partials/product_item');
}

<p><strong>Try 2:</strong> (didn't work either. I don't know why - because $item should be passed to that view?)</p>

<pre><code>foreach($items as $item) {
       $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('/profile/partials/product_item', $item);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Try 3:</strong> (same as try 2)</p>

<pre><code>foreach($items as $item) {
       $x = $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('/profile/partials/product_item', $item);
       echo $x;
}

<p><strong>Try 4</strong> (I've tried to do this in controller (I then just wanted to echo out <code>$product_item</code> into the overview-template)</p>

I can see two nodes in the Nodes section of Opscenter but I see Opscenter agent is not installed in the new node (1 of 2 agents are connected). It looks like in the new node it has its own opscenter installation and that somehow conflicts with the opscenter installation in the first node?

<p>To go from one page to another there's a tab or similar menu, so the page doesn't change, only the inner content.
The inner content has a lot of jquery and php: one has a form to make a search on the left and the results are shown in the center with datatables, so you can search inside the results, order them, etc, etc. When you switch from one content to another I don't want the content to be reset ( example: you make a search and then you go to another page/inner content  , when you come back the results of the search have to be still there). One of the tabs has a list( a submenu). When you select something from that list every page has to know and to use that selected value.</p>

<p>I thought the I can make all this with a lot of ajax, jquery ui tabs and php.</p>

<p>My questions are: it's good to make something like that? Is there another way to achieve what I want? Would it be better to make a normal menu with a lot of pages( no more inner content, but diffrent pages) and keep the selected value in session?In this case how can I keep the results?(session again?) </p>

<p>I hope that this question is allowed. Thank you all!</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm not asking the code( I know how jquery tabs and I searched google). I'm asking if it's a good practice to make something like that( one page with a lot of content) or it's better to use more pages?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: I'll refrase my question. I have to make something like this: 10 pages with different content that have php, jquery inside with a menu to navigate from one page to another. When you go from one page to another the searches and options selected in the pages that you left have to be still there, so that when you go back you can see them. One menu has a submenu with a list. When you select something from that list the selected value changes things in half of the pages(what you see inside). How should I do this?(don't show me code, tell me only what should I use to accomplish this) </p>

<p><strong>EDIT3</strong>: I looked online and yahoo mail has what I want. The top of the page is allways the same. Then you have a menu: inbox, contacts, calendar. When you click on contacts only part of the page changes ( my inner content as I called it) and the same happens when you click on the other voices in the menu. Inside contacts, if you click on one contact you can see details about that contact, then if you click on inbox and again contacts you can still see the contact that you selected before. How can I achieve this?</p>

  endforeach;

  $output .= '&lt;/ul&gt;';
  return $output;

<p>I was able to get this working, although I have a database call in a foreach loop, which probably isn't the best idea:</p>

            $matches = array();

<p>I have been playing with the R math standalone library in C++.  I quite like being able to generate random numbers and use distribution functions that I am comfortable with from R.  My question is:  is it possible to use the matrix operations (multiplication, transpose, inverse, Chol, etc) that are available in R in a standalone library?  I don't see them in Rmath.h.  </p>

<p>If matrix operations are available to use in standalone C++ code, it seems that the R API becomes the perfect open source computational engine.  Are people using it in this fashion?</p>

In one of those module someone created a topic producer that publishes messages on a topic, but this module hasn't a topic consumer to dequeue the messages. The topic producer sets the time-to-live property to 300000 milliseconds using <code>setTimeToLive()</code>. </p>

<p>I expect that if there is no consumer, the messages expire within 300000 milliseconds and they are deallocated.</p>

<p>The application is deployed on Tomcat 6.0.36 and it uses an external ActiveMQ server to handle the queues and topics.</p>

<p>Monitoring ActiveMQ with Java VisualVM in the MBeans tab under the topic settings I see that the variable ""Enqueue Count"" grows, but I don't understand if the time-to-live settings took effect on these messages. I expected to see the counter ""ExpiredCount"" to increase, but it still remains fixed to 0.</p>

<p>Is there a way to understand if those messages still stay in memory or if they are deallocated?</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I did some tests using j2ee tutorial examples on netbeans 7.3 using internal glassfish 3.1 as server, monitoring it with jvisualvm and all works as api says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The JMS API provides no mechanism for browsing a topic. Messages usually disappear from a 
  topic as soon as they appear: if there are no message consumers to consume them, the JMS 
  provider removes them. Although durable subscriptions allow messages to remain on a topic > while the message consumer is not active, no facility exists for examining them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read that glassfish uses inside activeMQ so I hope that this is valid also for a standalone ActiveMQ server.</p>

<p>I thought <code>for..in</code> loop does not keep track of orders when we loop through an Object, because, unlike Arrays, Object's properties are not index based.</p>

<p>This leads me to question my work on recreating some of the methods from Underscore.js such as <code>_.each</code> and <code>_.reduce</code></p>

<p>Below is my attempts to recreate those methods.</p>

<pre><code>var each = function(list, iteratee) {
    if (Array.isArray(list)) {
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) {
            iteratee(list[i], i, list);
        }
    } else if (list.constructor === Object) {
        for (var key in list) {
            iteratee(list[key], key, list);
        }
    }
};

var reduce = function(list, iteratee, memo){  
  var memoUndefined = arguments.length &lt; 3;
  each(list, function(elem, index, list){
    if (memoUndefined) {
      memoUndefined = false;
      memo = elem;
    } else {
        memo = iteratee(memo, elem, index, list);
    }
  });
  return memo;
};
</code></pre>

<p>They seem to work correctly, such that works on both Array and Object as its <code>list</code>, with or without <code>memo</code> supplied to it.</p>

<p>However, what makes me wonder is that how does my <code>each</code> function keep track of the orders of properties it is iterating over? How would it make sure the orders of the properties being looped is always consistent? It makes sense for Arrays because it's properties are index. But Object's is not. I believe this might have a potential issue when being implemented in a function like my <code>reduce</code> above. If what <code>iteratee</code> does in the future is just simple addition or subtraction it might be fine, but what about multiplications or division? The orders of values <code>each</code> will iterate will be crucial. Is my concern appropriate?</p>

<p>but if i do that, i break #1 from working and instead of getting the vertical scrollbar in my individual tables, i get a vertical scroll bar for the whole page which is something i don't want.</p>

Selecting the first choice brings up a specific sub-table, which works just fine. Selecting the row in the sub-table should bring up a specific view with content. The code for the second segue is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {
    if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@""showUSViewDetail""]) {

<p>examDetailViewContents is the array that is used to populate the contents of the TableView in the sub-table, and the usView is a variable that contains the data for the content view that gets pulled up with the selection.</p>

<p>The problem is that regardless of which row is selected, it always acts as if the first row is selected (interestingly, the data is passed and the content displays perfectly, only it's just the content tagged to the first row of the table). What I really don't understand is that I used essentially the same code for the segue from the first table to the sub-table, and it works perfectly.</p>

I'm thinking like linking to a library that has everything the exe references. If it helps, I'm building for both x64 and x86. </p>

<p>P.S. What's up with the manifest file, should I include it or not?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Choose one&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Using jQuery, is there an event I can capture for when the select option list has been revealed? (the reason I need this is because I want to defer population of the list until the moment the list needs to be displayed to the user).</p>

<p><code>mousedown</code> works for when they click on it, but doesn't do anything if they tab to it and press enter.</p>

<p><code>focus</code> also works for clicking, and almost works for tabbing to it, but it immediately fires upon tabbing to it rather than waiting until they press enter to reveal the option list. (This is a problem because if they tab to it and then tab on without pressing enter, I don't want the event to fire).</p>

<p>I even came up with this abomination:</p>

<pre><code>var select_reveal = function(ev) { ... }
$('select').on('mousedown', select_reveal).on('keydown', function(ev) {
    // character code 9 is tab
    if (ev.which !== 9) select_reveal.bind(this)(ev);
});
</code></pre>

<p>This actually <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/ZdKEg/"" rel=""nofollow"">seems to work</a>. It even works for the case where they type an alphabet letter (it populates the list then jumps to the first option starting with that letter). But as I said, this is somewhat of an abomination. It's also a little hacky just checking for ""tab"" as an exception -- there are definitely other exceptions that won't cause the select to be revealed.</p>

<p>Is there a simple event that covers this use case (or at least something less abominable that covers it)?</p>

<p><em>(Note: I know there are alternatives to structuring the system like this -- for example, by populating the options ahead of time as they change rather than on the select reveal; but I'm not looking for alternative suggestions, just wondering if there is a solution to the problem explicitly posed).</em></p>

The model looks clean and nice, but the controller and the views aren't really dry. The contents of new.html.erb and edit.html.erb are almost the same and the methods new/edit and create/update are doing almost the same thing. In other frameworks i've used only one view for updating and creating new entries and also the same method in my controller by setting the id as an optional parameter. Do they use this structure to keep things RESTful (i have not much of a clue about rest :()? Is it the best practice to use this default stuff for crud?</p>

<p>My drag &amp; drop function almost works wonderfully. I longPress a cell and it smoothly allows me to move the pressed cell to a new location between two other cells. The table adjusts and the changes save to core data. Great!</p>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>

<p>My problem is that if I drag the cell below the bottom cell in the table, even if I don't let go (un-press) of the cell... the app crashes. If I do the drag slowly, really it crashes as the cell crosses the y-center of the last cell... so I do think it's a problem related to the snapshot getting a location. Less important, but possibly related, is that if I long press below the last cell with a value in it, it also crashes.</p>

<p>The drag/drop runs off a switch statement that runs one of three sets of code based on the status:</p>

<ul>
<li>One case when the press begins</li>
<li>One case when the cell is being dragged</li>
<li>One case when when the user lets go of the cell</li>

<p><strong>Potential Culprit</strong></p>

<p>My guess is that the issue is related to the cell being unable to get coordinates once it is below the last cell. It isn't really floating, it is constantly setting its location in relation to the other cells. I think the solution will be an if-statement that does something magical when there's no cell to reference for a location. But what!?! Adding a nil check to each case isn't working for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>Clearly Stated Question</strong></p>

<p>How do I avoid crashes and handle an event where my dragged cell is dragged below the last cell?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM products 
CROSS JOIN images USING (imgId) 
CROSS JOIN productcolors ON colorsId = colorId
WHERE productId = 1
</code></pre>

<p>should return two rows (table structure below):</p>

1       1           1          img1_0.png    copper

imgId | productId | colorId  | imgSrc      | colorName
1       1           1          img1_0.png    slate
</code></pre>

<p>and when productId = 2 should return one row:</p>

<pre><code>imgId | productId | colorId  | imgSrc      | colorName
null    2          -1          null          null

<p>The images table contains multiple records with the same imgId, the same applys for productcolors where several colorIds could / will have the same value. There could also be no records in the images table (if imgId for example = -1 in the products table). That would mean that a product has no colors. Now, when I make this query and the images table or productcolors table contains no record for the imgId or colorId the query will return no result at all. I would like the fields in the row to contain null values instead of not returning anything, behaving like a Left outer join and cross join together.</p>

<p>Maybe I should have queries in my whileloop instead? Is there maybe any other way to approach this problem?</p>

<p>EDIT: My tables</p>

<pre><code>products:
productId | colorsId | imgId
1           1          1
2          -1         -1      //product 2 has no images nor colors

productcolors:

1         copper
1         slate

<p>My Playstation 4, however, won't take a link to a file and stream it; It needs an HTML player to stream the video. I don't want to create a player for every video. I can't make a player where you type the video name and hit play, because the names are too long and there are too many of them. </p>

<p>I don't know any way to get passed this without having to create an HTML page for every video, or at least an HTML page that includes every video.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I noticed when I viewed the source of a video in Google Chrome, this came up:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width""&gt;

<p>Is there a way to force the Playstation (or any browser?) to use this? Instead of the browser (google chrome) automatically applying this HTML to the MP4 video?</p>

<p>three lines about the ""setRequestHeader"" are in comment status. If I include them, I don't even get sign1. No response. What I figure out from this is everything is OK but I don't seem to understand how to use the post method to pass data to php. How do I do this? I have read everything on the net. I only do not know what ""setRequestHeader"" is for. One more thing: If I put ?tent=zuzu&amp;zart=gagi at the end of target URL, $_REQUEST thing works. But that's GET and not what I'm trying to do.

<p>The element generated looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;div class=""mc-image collection-image"" title="""" style=""background-image: url(http://www.server.com/image.jpg); position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; z-index: 12; opacity: 1; display: block; width: 1292px; height: 670px; "" data-title=""The&amp;nbsp;Title"" data-href=""#collection-description-172""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<p>I am using the <code>data-title</code> attribute to set the text in another div on the side when maximage/jQuery cycle changes the image.</p>

<p>I am at a complete loss, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>It should output the company name in order of who shows up in the dataframe the most. Then it should show the person who picked up the MOST calls. Then the information for CallType and recvd_dttm should be the most recent information. </p>

<p>And it outputs correctly by company name and count but chooses a random call for the other information, not the most recent call.</p>

<p>Is it promoting the same way as what was mentioned on the first link? Also, is this the way to do this (like the first link to handle events) in reactjs? Should I implement somewhere along this lines?</p>

<p>Follow up question... or should I ask this separately?</p>

<p>If I have</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Parent&gt;
  &lt;ChildComponent&gt;
  &lt;ChildComponent&gt;
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>and a child when clicked I add a class to it, say <code>.selected</code>. But I'd need to remove it to the others since they are not selected anymore. In jQuery I could've done something like</p>

<pre><code>$('.child-components').removeClass('selected');
$(this).addClass('selected');
</code></pre>

<p>How to do this the react way?</p>

I've seen two patterns for passing functions as compile time arguments, and I'm curious if compilers are usually smart enough to recognize the two are equivalent, or if I'm asking too much. Here's the STL style, passing a functor object:</p>

<pre><code>  template&lt;class InputIterator, class Predicate&gt;
  InputIterator find_if ( InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Predicate pred )
  {
    for ( ; first!=last ; first++ ) if ( pred(*first) ) break;
    return first;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the alternative style:</p>

<pre><code>  template&lt;class InputIterator, class Predicate, class PredData&gt;
  InputIterator find_if ( InputIterator first, InputIterator last, PredData data )
  {
    for ( ; first!=last ; first++ ) if ( Predicate::eval(*first, data) ) break;
    return first;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>In the STL style, your Predicate class typically contains as members any data it needs, and you call operator() to evaluate the predicate. In the alternative style, you never have a Predicate object, rather it contains a static method that takes the item to be checked, and the data is passed as an argument rather than stored as a member on Predicate.</p>

<p>I have a few fears using the STL style:</p>

<ol>
<li>If Predicate is a word or smaller, will the compiler be smart enough to pass it by register? In the alternative style the word would be an argument, so the compiler doesn't have to infer anything.</li>
<li>If Predicate is empty, will it be smart enough to avoid instantiating and passing it? In the alternative style Predicate is never instantiated.</li>
</ol>

<p>So my intuition is the alternative style should be faster, but perhaps I'm underestimating modern optimizers.</p>

<p>We are using push replication to subscriber databases which already have all the necessary tables, so we are using 'delete data' for the 'action if name is in use'. The tables have identical schemas on both the subscriber and publication databases, but are empty until replication has initiated.</p>

<p>The issue is that sometimes initialization of the subscription takes ~3 minutes, but other times it is timing out after ~20 minutes, using identically templated subscriber databases, and identical starting datasets (~10,000 records). 
And after initialization, when synchronizing, instead of taking ~5 seconds, it's again taking ~20 minutes. And looking at the history in the replication monitor, the synchronization history says it's making 1000's of schema changes (even when there have been no data changes).</p>

<p>I turned on verbose logging to see what the schema changes are, and it seems to be looping repeatedly through all the tables, turning all the constraints off, and then back on again.
I'm at a loss as to why it's doing this.</p>

<p>Note in case it's relevant: I have been using a 100 character unicode string (created randomly from the full unicode range of characters) as the host_name for different subscribers. I suspected this might be causing the issue, but I have since reproduced the problem using a 50 character lowercase letter string.</p>

<p>Finally, all servers are hosted in the same data center, so I do not think network latency is an issue.</p>

I have to parse through large txt files on startup (currently using StreamReader). These may add up to 100/200MB or more even. Reading them into line arrays is fine on desktop but not on handheld devices. I need to keep a reference to certain lines to be able to retrieve chunks of the file.</p>

<p>Is it possible to save the byte a certain line starts at so I can use a FileStream and set the position accordingly or any other suggestions on how I can do this?</p>

What is the real best way to design a database first and use the EF after?
For example, i dont know how to update my models after changing the base. I always need to run the Reverse Engine Code First Tool again, wich messed with a lot of other things.

Suppose this is a LED display. It would take input of 4 bit
(0000)-(1111) and display the Hex of it. For example
if (1100) come in it would display C by turning on AFED and turning off BCG.

If (1010) comes in it would display A by turning on ABCEFG 
and turn off D.

These display will all be Capital letters so there is no visual
difference between 0 and D and 8 and B.

Develop a truth table and an optimized expression using Karnaugh Maps.

<p>I'm not exactly sure how to begin. For the truth table would I be using (w,x,y,z) as input variable or just the ABCDEFG variable since it's the one turning on and off?</p>

<pre><code>input (1010)--&gt;A--&gt; ABCEFG~D (~ stand for NOT)
input (1011)--&gt;B--&gt; ABCDEFG
input (1100)--&gt;C--&gt; ADEF~B~C~G

<p>Looking for feedback</p>

<p>Goal: I am trying to enable ""Clean URLs"" on a Drupal 7 site (such that example.com/?q=user resolves to example.com/user).</p>

<p>I've just spent way too long pouring through official Drupal docs and comments, to no avail, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I have checked the box ""Enable Clean URLs"" in Drupal (/admin/config/search/clean-urls) and got the all-clear that the configuration options were saved. So now I am actually able to go to example.com/user and it does indeed display the same content as example.com/?q=user. What I want, however, is for example.com/?q=user to be rewritten in the URI as example.com/user.</p>

<p>The relevant .htaccess code is shown above, and my Apache conf appears to be properly configured.</p>

<code>?x=wmen&amp;plist=1&amp;s=tops&amp;c=shirts</code> and check new data against it like : <code>s=tops&amp;jackets</code> so i broke everything in the url into small arrays like <code>['x','wmen'] ,['plist','1'] ...</code> then did the same for the new data  <code>['s','tops'] ,['c','shirts'] ...</code> now i need to compare the two to prevent duplicates, and they are stored in order as they would be if they were clikced like : <code>?x=wmen&amp;plist=1&amp;s=tops&amp;c=shirts</code> to be placed in the href. </p>

<h2>Let me just set the scene:</h2>

<p>I have a grid of absolutely positioned elements, whose height, width and position(top and left) are a percentage of their container's. Essentially it is a grid of boxes that will dynamically resize to always fit the window's width while at the same time holding a steady aspect ratio. Each of these boxes should be a clickable link and must contain text that will resize appropriately as they resize.<br>
The HTML looks somewhat like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""container""&gt;
    &lt;!-- The container's width is 95% of the window --&gt;
    &lt;img alt="""" src=""images/aspect-holder.png""&gt;
    &lt;!-- This image makes sure the container retains the correct aspect ratio* --&gt;
    &lt;a href=""link1"" class=""element col1 row1""&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Some&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;
              ...
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=""link2"" class=""element col1 row2""&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Other&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;
              ...
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=""link3"" class=""element col1 row3""&gt;
        &lt;!-- as above --&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
              ...
              ...
    &lt;a href=""link100something"" class=""element col18 row9""&gt;
        &lt;!-- as above --&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>*The technique of <a href=""http://lab.veille.jp/aspectratio/"" rel=""nofollow"">using an image to preserve aspect ratio is explained here</a></p>

<p>The CSS for the grid is pretty straightforward and the only thing noteworthy is that I am setting the font-size of the spans in the anchor tag as percentages so that I can use JQuery to manipulate them all easily by either manipulating the font size of their parent (the anchors) or their parent's parent (the #container).</p>

<h2>Now as for the Problem:</h2>

<p>What I wanted, apart from the dynamic nature of the grid, was that whenever the user hovers over one the boxes it should then ""zoom in"". Essentially on mouseenter the box would increase in height and width and decrease its top and left margin to 'pop' out of the page.
The following is the JQuery that I wrote to put it all together:(apologies for any glaring mistakes, I am here to learn)</p>

<pre><code>container = $('#container');
anchor = container.find('a');
//The Globals have more unique names but I wrote them like this here
//to make it easier to read

//This part handles the font-size resize on Load and on Resize
function fontfix() {
    container.css('font-size', anchor.width() + 'px');
}

$(function() {
    fontfix();
});

$(window).resize(function() {
    fontfix();
});

<p>And this works! ...Well, on WebKit and Opera, or on other browsers for fewer than about 30 or 40 elements. With 100+ elements on Firefox 10 its stuttery and somewhat laggy and on IE8 its practically a slideshow. This has frustrated me no end, as I hoped to make it as cross-browser as possible and so I really hope you girls and guys can help.</p>

<h2>So to Sum Up</h2>

<ol>
<li>Have I fudged the Globals? Should I use something different?</li>
<li>Is there a way to make the animation work smoothly on all browsers?</li>
<li>Are there any other tweaks to this code you would make? Or anything else to note?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for reading this far and sorry for the long post! Any help with this is appreciated.</p>

<h2>Demo on JsFiddle</h2>

<p>The link to the fiddle is <code>http://jsfiddle.net/kkubD/</code><br>
As is, it works like a dream on Chrome, on FF you should see stuttering and on IE even more stuttering.</p>

<p>As an aside, I realize I could and possibly should use an unordered list and thus wrap all my anchors in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s, but I could not find a sufficiently compelling reason to do so as the grid in its current format looks satisfactory (better even) even without CSS enabled. I guess I would find improved crawlability or performance a good enough reason, but don't know that it would add anything. Am I wrong at all in this?</p>

<pre><code> #define LIBRARY_API_VERSION_1_0

<p>And I can do things like this in my application code:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""LibraryApi.h""

<p>Now I'm working in C#. So, apparently <code>#define</code>s are only scoped to the file they're defined in, so I looked into the solution <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2818333/namespace-constant-in-c-sharp"">described here</a> of using a static class with constants. But, that solution requires the checking to happen <em>at runtime</em>, which introduces a number of problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Potentially inefficient, if I'm running over the same code over and over again checking an extra conditional (though if it's a <code>const</code>, perhaps the compiler or .NET runtime is smart enough to avoid this?)</li>
<li>You can't do things that would throw compiler errors. In my above example, I've defined <code>param</code> twice with two different types. Also <code>UseOtherMethodSignature</code> may not exist as a function, which will not compile if both blocks are there only separated by <code>if</code>/<code>else</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what is the accepted solution for this type of problem? My scenario is that I have multiple versions of a web service API (with varying degrees of differences depending on what you're doing with it) and I want to be able to compile against either without commenting/uncommenting a bunch of code or some other equally silly manual process.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>For what it's worth, I'd prefer a compile-time solution--in my scenario I know when I compile which version I'm going to use, I don't need to figure out which version of the library is available on the system at runtime. Yes, that will work, but seems like overkill.</p>

<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong> </p>

<p>Teddy loves roses and Tracy loves lilies. They wish to plant these flowers in a large garden.  </p>

<p>However, the only florist in town sells these flowers in packets which are represented by <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code>s roses and lilies. The i-th packet contains roses[i] roses and lilies[i] lilies. Each packet can be bought only once.  </p>

<p>Teddy and Tracy wish to buy some flowers and arrange them into a rectangular grid. This grid must be arranged such that each cell contains exactly one flower, and any two cells which share an edge must contain different kinds of flowers. Additionally, Teddy and Tracy must use all the flowers they buy.  </p>

<p>Teddy and Tracy love square-shaped grids, so they wish to buy a set of packets such that they can arrange the flowers into the most square-like grid possible. More precisely, they wish to arrange the flowers into an R x C grid, where R and C are positive integers, such that |R-C| (|R-C| denotes the absolute value of R-C) is minimized. Return this minimum absolute value, or -1 if no valid arrangement exists.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>
  </p>

<p>Class:             <code>BuyingFlowers</code></p>

<p>Method:            <code>buy</code></p>

<p>Parameters:        <code>vector &lt;int&gt;, vector &lt;int&gt;</code></p>

<p>Returns:           <code>int</code></p>

<p>Method signature:  <code>int buy(vector &lt;int&gt; roses, vector &lt;int&gt; lilies)</code></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>{2, 4}<br>
{4, 2}</p>

<p>Returns: 1</p>

<p>Buying all the packets to get 6 roses and 6 lilies, they can create a 3 x 4 grid with the following arrangement:</p>

<p>RLRL<br>
  LRLR<br>
  RLRL</p>

<p>The difference of the height and the width of this arrangement is 1.</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts so far</strong>  </p>

<p>So there were a couple of thoughts I've had about this problem so far that I figure might be important to solving it. Feel free to disregard them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Every rectangle created by the flowers will have an even number of roses and lilies on the perimeter. So the largest possible rectangle you could make with the flowers could be found by taking the smaller of the two in quantity, say if you have 6 roses and 4 lilies, since you only have 4 lilies the maximum size rectangle you could make would include 4 roses and 4 lilies. </p></li>
<li><p>The challenge obviously comes when you consider that each cell of the rectangle must be filled with a flower, so you must find the ""best fit"" rectangle you can, given the number of flowers you have, that will satisfy both: providing enough ""middle"" cells for the rest of the flowers to reside in, and being as close to a square as possible. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've looked at some of the solutions posted, however the code tends to be very obfuscated and optimized (in terms of writing it quickly) so it tends to be difficult to extract the concept the author had in mind for the solution. </p>

<p>I would appreciate any ideas, I'd love to learn about some ways to solve a problem like this quickly. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/8eYee.png"" alt=""ios interface""></p>

<p>At the bottom of this view, there is a list of items.  This list of items can be arbitrarily long.  As such, and because of the standard detail disclosure indicator and so on, it makes sense that this is a tableview.</p>

<p>However, the items at the top are not tableview cells.  The obvious answer then, is to simply place a tableview on the view, i.e. an embedded tableview.  But this leads to another obvious issue, which is that this entire view should be scrollable - there will be a button for ""Add Item"" underneath the list of items which you will need to be able to scroll to, and the interface will be crappy if the whole view doesn't scroll.</p>

<p>So, I could make it so the tableview is not scrollable, and is just as tall as it needs to be to include as many items as it needs to.  Then, the entire view is embedded in a scrollview, and scrolls properly.  My concern with this relates to memory management, if I do this, I don't think I'll be taking advantage of the dynamic cell creation that is inherently part of a scrollable tableview, and will instead have dozens or even hundreds of cells instantiated when the view loads.</p>

<p>Another alternative would be to make the entire interface a tableview, with the top portions, and the bottom button, implemented as custom tableview cells that are different from the cells that show items.  In the past, however, I've found that this is a pain-in-the-ass too, but perhaps it's a pain I must endure.</p>

<p>In general, I feel like I'm missing an obvious approach here, since this seems like it ought to be extremely simple to implement, but I'm currently at a loss.  Help is appreciated!</p>

The idea is that the user specifies inputs within matching ""&lt;"" and "">"". I'd like them to be able to invoke the program and then type as many of these inputs as they'd like across multiple lines until they terminate the input with Control-D.</p>

<p>So they could do:
""[this is a valid</p>

<p>input even thought it spans</p>

<p>three lines]"" (using brackets instead of &lt; so that my text doesn't disappear!)</p>

<p>I discovered I could use fscanf to easily process these kinds of fragment by using something like:</p>

<pre><code>fscanf(fp, ""&lt;"" ""%999[^&gt;]"" ""&gt;"", buffer);
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm having a lot of difficulty getting this to work across multiple lines, and I'm not entirely sure about the best way to loop through these inputs and put the strings between &lt; into an array containing just the relevant string.</p>

<p>I've done a bit of research and people seem to have differing opinions on the use of fgets versus sscanf versus fscanf, and I'm not really sure about what the merits of each are as they related to my particular problem. I'm also not sure how to make a newline not terminate the input (as it currently does). Should I be checking the number of matches that fscanf returns, or should I be looking for an EOF terminator?</p>

<p>Currently, my code looks like this (I was using matches earlier to check the number of each input but have since removed that). Obviously this doesn't yet move anything to an array for the sake of simplicity. Additionally, fp is currently stdin, but I'd like to keep it robust enough that I could simply change that pointer to a file in case I wanted to read from a file.</p>

<pre><code>char buffer[1000];

while(true){
    int matches = fscanf(fp, ""{"" ""%999[^}]"" ""}"", buffer);
    if (feof(fp)) break;
    printf(""%s\n"", buffer);

<p>I have the following classes as part of a simple state machine.</p>

<p>Please note that all generic type parameters HAVE to be an enumeration. That has been enforced in the constructors (not shown here).</p>

<pre><code>// Both [TState] and [TCommand] will ALWAYS be enumerations.
public class Transitions&lt;TState, TCommand&gt;: List&lt;Transition&lt;TState, TCommand&gt;&gt;
{
    public new void Add (Transition&lt;TState, TCommand&gt; item)
    {
        if (this.Contains(item))
            throw (new InvalidOperationException(""This transition already exists.""));
        else
            this.Add(item);
    }
}

// Both [TState] and [TCommand] will ALWAYS be enumerations.
public class Transition&lt;TState, TCommand&gt;
{
    TState From = default(TState);
    TState To  = default(TState);
    TCommand Command = default(TCommand);
}

public sealed class TransitionComparer&lt;TState&gt;:
    IComparer&lt;TState&gt;
{
    public int Compare (TState x, TState y)
    {
        int result = 0;

        // How to compare here since TState is not strongly typed and is an enum?
        //    Using ToString seems silly here.

        result |= x.From.ToString().CompareTo(y.From.ToString());
        result |= x.To.ToString().CompareTo(y.To.ToString());
        result |= x.Command.ToString().CompareTo(y.Command.ToString());

        return (result);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above does compile but I'm not sure if this is the right way to handle enums that have been passed in as generic type parameters.</p>

<p>Note: The compare function does not need to keep ordering in mind. Rather it needs to check for exact duplicates.</p>

"28721059","1","","","2015-02-25 14:06:07","","0","25","<p>Here's what I'm trying to achieve:</p>

<p>I have 3 divs inside my main div. Each div has an entrance animation - from opacity 0 and scale 0 to individual opacity and scale. After that div num 3 (the one that on top of others) stays as is and the others must do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Div 2 must has to exit to the left with rotation of -30deg and opacity set to 0.</li>
<li>After that div 1 must be scaled up to the same size as was div 2, have the same opacity and same z-index.</li>
<li>Div 2 has to return to the same scale, opacity and z-index that div 1 had initially.</li>
<li>Div 1 must exit to right with rotation of 30deg and opacity set to 0.</li>
<li>Div 2 scales back to its initial size, initial opacity and z-index</li>
</ul>

<p>then the entire process of the second animation has to repeat itself, so I have sort of interchanging divs effect. I created the entry animation:</p>

<pre><code>@-webkit-keyframes enter-fld2 {
        from {
            opacity: 0;
            -webkit-transform: scale(0) translateY(80px);
        } to {
            opacity: 0.7;
            -webkit-transform: scale(0.8) translateY(80px);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>but when I tried to create the second animation to div 2 - It just worked weirdly.</p>

<pre><code>@-webkit-keyframes anim-fld2 {
        0% {
            transform-origin: bottom left;
            opacity: 1;
            -webkit-transform: scale(1) translateY(80px);
        }
        20% {
            -webkit-transform: rotate(-30deg) translateX(-80px);
            opacity: 0;
        }
        40% {
            -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg) translateX(0px) scale(0);
            opacity: 0;
            z-index:1;
        }
        60% {
            opacity: 0.4;
            -webkit-transform: scale(0.6) translateY(175px);
        }
        80% {
            opacity: 0.4;

            z-index:2
        }

<p>The app starts with a SplashScreenActivity which has a 480x800 PNG as its background image to use for the startup splash screen. The app proceeds to navigate to its next view which also displays a new 480x800 px. The third screen navigation also contains 480x800 PNG and this when the out of memory error occurs. First I tried this with setting the background in the axml layout. then I tried alternative method of setting the background from code in the SplashScreenActivity.OnCreate() and the other two view OnCreate() methods. I read elsewhere that disposing the drawable release it from the mono vm in case this was the problem. Another trick which helped was to force a GC at the beginning of OnCreate() this left 12% of the heap free but this had limited success.</p>

<pre><code>public class SplashScreenActivity: MvxBaseSplashScreenActivity
{
    public SplashScreenActivity() : base(Resource.Layout.SplashScreen) { }

    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
    {
        base.OnCreate(bundle);

        using (var drawable = Resources.GetDrawable(Resource.Drawable.LoadingScreen))
            Window.SetBackgroundDrawable(drawable);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the second view</p>

<pre><code>public class GameView : MvxBindingActivityView&lt;GameViewModel&gt;
{
    public GameView() { SoundBinding.GameView = this; }

    protected override void OnViewModelSet() { SetContentView(Resource.Layout.GameView); }

    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle) 
    {
        GC.Collect();
        base.OnCreate(bundle);
        using (var drawable = Resources.GetDrawable(Resource.Drawable.GameScreenBackground))
            Window.SetBackgroundDrawable(drawable);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After all this the App still runs out of memory on inflating a third similar view with background. Sometimes it will work, and then as screens cycle eventually it occurs. I looked at the heap dump on MAT and I can see two bitmapDrawables of 3.5M in size. I assume these are my two bitmaps. For the 2nd BitmapDrawable I can clearly see the view that is holding onto it. There is another bitmap still in memory but i can't see what its path to GC root is. This must be the first loaded PNG in the first SplashScreenActivity view. Here is its MAT Path to GC roots without weak refs. There is a weak ref holding it as well.</p>

<p>So question time. How do I ensure these drawables are released before the next view is inflated? Is it necessary to set the backgrounds in code rather than the layouts of the views? Do I need to unbindDrawables() by setting callback to null as seen here <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7044770/drawable-vs-single-reusable-bitmap-better-with-memory"">Drawable vs Single reusable Bitmap better with memory?</a> ?
I investigated the OnDestroy() overide of the views, but I found these where not being called before the new view is created. When navigating from one view to another is there away to ensure a view is destroyed and would this help release my resources before the next view is inflated.</p>

<p>Any advice on how better manage these resources in my app would be much appreciated.</p>

Basically, all I want to do is to change the location.path (or whatever the right way to do this is) and then be able to run expects on the directive's HTML, to see that the breadcrumb list has updated.</p>

<p>The breadcrumb service (borrowed from <a href=""https://gist.github.com/benschw/5516156"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""AngularJS Breadcrumbs Service"">AngularJS Breadcrumbs Service</a>) looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var commonModule = angular.module('app.common');

commonModule.factory('common.service.breadcrumbs', ['$rootScope', '$location', function($rootScope, $location){

    var breadcrumbs = [];
    var breadcrumbsService = {};

    function setBreadcrumbs() {
        var pathElements = $location.path().split('/'), result = [], i;
        var breadcrumbPath = function (index) {
            return '/' + (pathElements.slice(0, index + 1)).join('/');
        };

        pathElements.shift();
        for (i=0; i&lt;pathElements.length; i++) {
            result.push({name: pathElements[i], path: breadcrumbPath(i)});
        }

        breadcrumbs = result;
    }

    setBreadcrumbs();

    // We want to update breadcrumbs only when a route is actually changed
    // $location.path() will get updated immediately (even if route change fails!)
    $rootScope.$on('$routeChangeSuccess', function(event, current){
        setBreadcrumbs();
    });

    breadcrumbsService.getAll = function() {
        return breadcrumbs;
    };

    breadcrumbsService.getFirst = function() {
        return breadcrumbs[0] || {};
    };

    return breadcrumbsService;
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>And my current test looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>describe(""Directive:"", function() {

    beforeEach(angular.mock.module(""app""));

    var $compile,
        $scope,
        $location;

    // Angular strips the underscores when injecting
    beforeEach(inject(function(_$compile_, _$rootScope_, _$location_) {
        $compile = _$compile_;
        $scope = _$rootScope_.$new();
        $location = _$location_;
    }));

    describe(""breadcrumbs"", function () {

        it(""correctly display the path as breadcrumbs."",
            inject(['common.service.breadcrumbs', function(breadcrumbs) {

                //console.log($location.path());
                //$scope.$apply();
                $location.path('/analyze/reports');
                $scope.$apply();
                //console.log($location.path());
                //console.log(breadcrumbs.getAll());

                $scope.$broadcast('$routeChangeSuccess', {});

                // Build the directive
                var element = $compile('&lt;div class=""cf-breadcrumbs"" cf-breadcrumbs&gt;&lt;/div&gt;')($scope);
                $scope.$apply();

                console.log(element.html());
            }]));

    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>currently, I'm not ever seeing the breadcrumb service update the array of breadcrumbs. I've tried console.log(breadcrumbs.getAll()), and it always returns the same array without the two new path elements. I'm concerned that it might be something timing related, but not exactly sure how I would wait for the $routeChangeSuccess event to affect the service before I do my check/apply.</p>

<p>Long story short, how would I test to see that the breadcrumbs are updated appropriately?</p>

    .JoinAlias(c =&gt; c.Teacher, () =&gt; teacherAlias)
    .Where(c =&gt; c.CourseID.IsInsensitiveLike(strNumber, option))

               .TransformUsing(Transformers.AliasToBean&lt;CourseItem&gt;())
.List&lt;CourseItem&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>The query doesn't work because nHibernate has no idea how to resovled based on Teacher.ID and Teacher.Name. Any thoughts on whether it's possible to NOT fetch the <strong>entire child object</strong> back to a parent object?</p>

<p>I've tried the following query and it works this is not my fully desired outcome </p>

<pre><code>var query = session.QueryOver&lt;CourseItem&gt;(() =&gt; courseAlias)

<pre><code>enum BasicEnum
{
    BasicValue1,
    BasicValue2
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to have is something similar to</p>

<pre><code>public void Foo&lt;TEnum&gt;(TEnum someEnum)
    where TEnum : struct, IComparable, IFormattable, IConvertible
{
    switch (someEnum)
    {
        case BasicEnum.BasicValue1:
            //...
            break;
        case BasicEnum.BasicValue2:
            //...
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All the <code>TEnum</code> types contain only the values that present in <code>BasicEnum</code>.</p>

<p>Of course such code is not being compiled so I tried to change it onto this:</p>

<pre><code>public void Foo&lt;TEnum&gt;(TEnum someEnum)
    where TEnum : struct, IComparable, IFormattable, IConvertible
{
    BasicEnum basicEnum = (BasicEnum)someEnum;

    switch (basicEnum)
    {
        //...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As expected here I have an error again <em>'Cannot convert type 'TEnum' to 'BasicEnum''</em></p>

<p>It's not so difficult to find a trick like</p>

<pre><code>var value = Convert.ToInt32(someEnum);
var basicValue = (BasicEnum)value;
</code></pre>

<p>But this solution doesn't seem the one I like so much. Is there a better way? </p>

I've already seen ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14607193/installing-gem-or-updating-rubygems-fails-with-permissions-error"">Installing gem or updating RubyGems fails with permissions error</a>"", which is where I first learned about rbenv.</p>

<p>I'm confused because I'm new to Ruby, rbenv, and Apple's command line developer tools/XCode and don't really understand what's going on.</p>

<p>After typing a command into Terminal, I got the following message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ""xcrun"" command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure which one to choose, because I don't understand all the pros and cons. I need Ruby because I'm working with Bootstrap, and I apparently need XCode (or command line tools) to work with Ruby.</p>

<p>My instincts say go with Xcode, as it's presumably specially designed for this kind of thing. Would that be the best choice? I just want to make sure I don't start off on the wrong foot and mess up something in my system, as others have done.</p>

The cells contain a couple of elements (a <code>UILabel</code> and a <code>UIView</code>) with constraints on them. I've set up the constraints such that the cell height grows as the label text height increases using the new <code>UICollectionViewFlowLayout</code> property that's available in iOS8, <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/iOS/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UICollectionViewFlowLayout_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UICollectionViewFlowLayout/estimatedItemSize""><code>estimatedItemSize</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>layout.estimatedItemSize = CGSizeMake(self.collectionView.frame.width, 100)
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works like a charm <em>except</em> there's one big problem: the <code>UICollectionView</code> loads only half the items as returned by the <code>numberOfItemsInSection</code> method. So, when the method returns, say, 10, my <code>UICollectionView</code> only displays 5 cells (but displays and lays them out perfectly). </p>

<p>Some relevant findings from my debugging attempts:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've been able to force the loading of the remaining items by calling <code>invalidateLayout</code> or changing the number of sections from 1 to 2. But those are just debugging hacks.</li>
<li>Separately, everything works like a charm when I replace <code>estimatedItemSize</code> with the <code>itemSize</code> property, i.e. hard-coding the item size. But that defeats the self-sizing functionality I'd like to implement. </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm assuming there's something wrong with how I'm thinking about self-sized cells. Specifically, I wonder if the problem has something to do with constraints. </p>

<p>I'd appreciate any help here.</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with the functions above? To sum up, I want to read from an array. I ""break"" this array into three-word-block, then assign the first one to the username field of the node, the second one to the password field, etc. I want to do this on my whole array, therefore creating one big <code>LinkedList</code> of nodes.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>I'm coding on VS-C++. I've a custom class 'Person' with attribute 'height'. I want to call class method Grow() that starts a timer that will increment 'height' attribute every 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p>I'll have a StopGrow() that stops the timer and Shrink() that decrements instead of increment.</p>

<p>I really need a little push on which timer to use and how to use it within Grow() method. Other methods must be straight forward after knowing that.</p>

<p>PHP manual says ::::: ""If a program is started with this function, in order for it to continue running in the background, the output of the program must be redirected to a file or another output stream. Failing to do so will cause PHP to hang until the execution of the program ends."" - <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php</a></p>

<p>I want to collect external script data for specific time e.g. for 30 seconds, and after that continue the php script execution. Any ideas how to do that?</p>

<p>My current code is: </p>

<pre><code>    ob_start();
    passthru(""/home/somefolder/somefolder2/program $pic1 $pic2"");
    $details = ob_get_contents();
    ob_end_clean();
</code></pre>

<p>problem in above code is - sometimes ""program"" script keeps executing for a while, but i don't want to let the user to hang-on more than 30 seconds on this process.</p>

<p>I thought about redirecting the output to a file and read it after 30 seconds(according to the manual). But i don't know how redirect the output to a file.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
  [super viewDidAppear:animated];
  [self.tableView reloadData];
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that obviously causes a 'flash' when you first see the screen. In a more complicated scenario the flash is far more obvious.</p>

<p>I have another workaround but this causes an auto layout exception:</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
  BasicCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@""BasicCell"" forIndexPath:indexPath];

  cell.basicLabel.text = @""Hello this is just some text that should get the label to go over multiple lines"";

  [cell.basicLabel layoutIfNeeded];

  return cell;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Exception:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3Mn8E.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>At least this method doesn't give me UI flashing.</p>

<p>If I remove the accessory view it actually works perfectly fine.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've added a sample project to github:
<a href=""https://github.com/fwaddle/TableCellAccessoryTest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fwaddle/TableCellAccessoryTest</a></p>

<p>UPDATE #2: Turns out another work around this bug is to layout the cell in code. I just tried doing the same thing in code and it didn't throw the warning and worked fine. Looks like an IB bug.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to work around this issue?
Thanks.</p>

<p>If i tried like below I'm getting null reference exception.</p>

<pre><code>result.Aggs.DateHistogram(""jobcounts_by_year"").Terms(""top_agg"")

<p>It is nice but I am imagining a different situation. </p>

<p>I need to <em>embed</em> some videos in the Resources file and dynamically change the videos depending on the user input.
I have managed this running inside Visual Studio 2010. using the switch statements.
But I have to specify the path of that video in the resources file. for eg : </p>

<pre><code>case 1 : video = new Video(""..//..//Resources//The video name"");
</code></pre>

<p>But when I publish this application using the click once wizard, the final application ends up in an exception :</p>

<pre><code>System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
   at VideoPlayer.Form1.button2_Click(Object sender, EventArgs e)
   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnClick(EventArgs e)

<p>It seems that the video file was not included in the application. 
But when i saw the installer folder, a clear look showed that there is a file as named VideoPlayer.exe.deploy which is of 59MB normally these files without any resources are light weighted...</p>

<p>It surely contains the Video file. But I cannot access that file. </p>

<p>How Do I Access It?</p>

My problem is that I usually put the validation of the data in the setter of the property and not in a method like IDataErrorInfo.this[string columnName]... Here is a <a href=""http://www.codegod.de/WebAppCodeGod/WPF-IDataErrorInfo-and-Databinding-AID416.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">blog</a> I have found that have make me confuse.</p>

<p>What is the good way to proceed in .Net 3.5 to validate data object? Do I need to implement validations in method called by the Setter AND the IDataErrorInfo? Or just the IDataErrorInfo? Or in the setter call the IDataErrorInfo? </p>

<p>Example: I have a firstname string that can have only 3 to 50 chars. Do I put the string validation in the setter (What I would do usually) or now I can simply use the IDataErrorINfo.this method, check the property name and return a String Error when the data is not the good length? I found more intuitive to throw an error in the setter and not using the Interface but most example I see use the IDataErrorInfo interface.</p>

I am given a set of images and I need to <strong>devide them to photos and pictures(graphics)</strong> with means of OpenCV library. </p>

<p>I've  already tried </p>

<ol>
<li>to analyze RGB histogram (in average picture has empty bins of histogram),</li>
<li>to analyze HSV histogram (in average picture has not much colors), </li>
<li>to search for contours (in average the number of contours on picture is less than on photo).</li>
</ol>

<p>So I have 7% error (tested on 2000 images). I'm confused a little, because I have no a lot of experience in numerous computer vision means.</p>

<p>For example,this photo below. Its histograms (RGB and HSV) are very poor and number of contours is rather small. In addition there is a lot of background color, so I need to <strong>find an object</strong> to calculate only it histogram (I use findContours() for this).  But in any case my <strong>algorithm detects this image as picture</strong>. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/yxjpV.jpg?1"" alt=""photo 1""></p>

<p>And one more example:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/9Nn5h.jpg"" alt=""photo 2""></p>

<p>The problem with pictures is <strong>noise</strong>. I have images of small size (200*150) and in some cases noise is so perceptible, that my algorithm detects this image as photo. I've tried to blur images, but in this case the number of colors increases because of mixing pixels and also it decreases the number of contours (some dim boundaries become indistinguishable).</p>

<p>Example of pictures:
<img src=""http://i.imgur.com/FBop7.jpg?1"" alt=""picture 1"">
<img src=""http://i.imgur.com/9bhdO.jpg?1"" alt=""picture 2""></p>

I've have three divs wrapped in another div, and all the images align correctly except for the last 2 rows of each div, and I can't figure out why. It must be something to do with how I am handling the rows with null in them. I've also noticed that the rows seem to want to self-align themselves (figured this out by not handling the null values), so maybe it's something inherent with divs. I can't link the site because I haven't secured my api key, so here's a picture: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/IcdxDfK.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/IcdxDfK.png</a></p>

I know I can always just cross compile all my needed applications, but I want to have a compiler run on the system so I will have a good idea of how to do the same for other boards like the Rasberry Pi and Beaglebone, and because it just seems pretty cool.</p>

<p>I have looked into crosstool-ng but as I understand it seems to only work for an x86 host to various targets, instead of various hosts for various targets.</p>

<p>Is there any recommended workflow for this? I was thinking of seeing how the people who handle distributions for boards like the Beaglebone do it, but I can't seem to find any information on that, are they using some proprietary solution?</p>

<p>The toolchain in question is <a href=""https://sourcery.mentor.com/GNUToolchain/release2795?"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> from Sourcery CodeBench Lite which includes the source, but it seems that just running this through the already compiled cross compiler doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>Dim stopclick As Boolean = False

Private Sub btnPlay_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnPlay.Click
    btnForward.Enabled = False
    btnStop.Enabled = True
    While 
        ' Perform the while statements
        If stopclick = True Then
            stopclick = False
            Application.DoEvents()
            Exit While
        End If
    End While
End Sub

Private Sub btnStop_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnStop.Click
    stopClick = True
End Sub
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Have I used <code>Application.DoEvents</code> incorrectly?</li>
<li>What are the other options besides <code>Application.DoEvents</code>?  How can I stop the loop with a single <code>Stop</code> button click?</li>
</ol>

    }

<p>But what should be the value of the <code>pdfUrl</code>,I am confused...
And if I retrieve it from the DB it will be in a blob format(methinks) so how to convert it into a <code>NSdata</code> object?</p>

The ESBs communicate via a JMS topic. This design is legacy and cannot be changed. When a large CSV file is processed, JBoss AS (5.2) grinds to a halt as the producer is flooding out the consumer, this is even with a heap-size of 4096M.

One of the things I need to check is that the DSN entry in a Web.config file is a functional DSN, and that the DSN is pointing to the correct SQL server and database.</p>

<p>Currently you can run the utility in one of two modes, local or remote. My problem occurs when I am trying to verify a remote systems DSN on my local computer. I know why it doesnt work, I don't have the same DSN on my local computer. So what I need to figure out is how to either retrieve the DSN connection information from a remote machine to which I have administrative access, or to get the remote machine to verify it for me.</p>

<p>Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em><br>
So apparenty the DSN info is stored in the registry too!</p>

<pre><code>oRegConn = new ConnectionOptions();
oRegConn.Username = username;
oRegConn.Password = password;

This mean's that you'll have, say, a <code>API/user_information</code> endpoint, and a <code>API/article/</code> endpoint, and an <code>API/comments</code> endpoint and so on. For large applications these ajax calls will slow down rendering, especially over slow (mobile) connections. Ironically, this is not as much of a problem in the old-world of doing everything server-side, since the entire html is delivered in bulk upon the first request. Thus, sigle-page apps, which are supposed to be faster and more responsive than old-school server-rendered apps, may end up being considerably slower (admittedly, only if they require a large enough number of API calls).</p>

<p>The options, as far as I can see, seem to be:
1) Forget single-page apps, go back to doing everything server-side.
2) Consolidate all the API endpoints into fewer (possibly one) endpoint(s) so all content is retrieved with minimum latency. But now you're not longer RESTful.</p>

<p>These are both unsatisfying and sad. Is there a better solution?</p>

<p>PS: caching content in local storage seems to cause more problems than it solves because now you have to worry about invalidating client-side caches every time you push out fresh content.</p>

<p>I've uploaded a test case for you: <a href=""http://test-ground.besaba.com/silmond/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://test-ground.besaba.com/silmond/index.html</a></p>

<p>The inital examples, however, work perfectly. The only changed thing in my layout are the slider's sizes. I set the container's width to 56% and its height to 400px.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea why this happens?</p>

I came up with a test method for a method on my business logic, but it feels very clunky and dirty.</p>

<p>I'd like to get some feedback from people more experienced on this topic to see how I can improve it.</p>

<p>Here's the code, explanation follows:</p>

<pre><code>[Fact]
public void ShouldGetItemWithSameId()
{
    var fixture = new Fixture().Customize(new AutoMoqCustomization());
    var facade = fixture.Freeze&lt;Mock&lt;IDataFacade&gt;&gt;();
    facade.Setup(c =&gt; c.Get(It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;())).Returns((int i) =&gt; new Item { Key = i });

    var sut = fixture.Create&lt;BusinessLogic&gt;();
    var expected = fixture.Create&lt;int&gt;();

    Assert.Equal(expected, sut.Get(expected).Key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My <code>BusinessLogic</code> class takes an <code>IDataFacade</code> as constructor parameter, which is responsible in its <code>Get(int)</code> method to retrieve the item with the same Id, pretty basic stuff.</p>

<p>I freeze the <code>IDataFacade</code> mock and I set it up to construct an object matching the Id in <code>It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;</code>. I then create my SUT and test it. Works fine.</p>

<p>I'd like to understand if I can improve things considering the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have to test more complex methods, like a <code>Query</code> method that takes a class containing a lot of properties that will be used as filters on matching properties on the type being queried. In this case I wouldn't know how to properly do the ""Setup"" part of the mock, since I have to initialize all, or close to all, the properties of the returned type, and in this scenario it's not a single Item but a whole collection</li>
<li>The setup part feels out of place, I'd like to be able to reuse it in more methods</li>
</ul>

<p>I have some other tests using <code>Theory</code> with <code>AutoMoqData</code> but I was unable to achieve this test (and I think the more complex ones) using that approach, so I switched back to plain <code>Fact</code> with manually instantiated fixture.</p>

<p>Any help will be extremely appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>What have I tried:</strong> Well the position is set to absolute which was all I really knew to check in this case. I am at a lost what could cause this behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>
See the image below set to 10 degrees.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bzsSE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>And here when set to 0 degrees.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ljfl9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> That even when set to 2 degrees the clip still remains less then half its size.</p>

<p>This is how I define the hazelcast map:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hz:map name=""foo""
  &lt;hz:map-store enabled=""true""
                class-name=""my.package.jpa.UserDataRepository""
                write-delay-seconds=""1""/&gt;
&lt;/hz:map&gt;
...
&lt;bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""com.hazelcast.spring.cache.HazelcastCacheManager""&gt;
  &lt;constructor-arg ref=""user-provisioning-hazelcast""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;bean id=""userMappingCache"" factory-bean=""cacheManager"" factory-method=""getCache""&gt;
  &lt;constructor-arg&gt;&lt;value&gt;foo&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The map seems to be working (in memory, at least).</p>

<p>This how I define the CRUD interface at my.package.jpa.UserDataRepository</p>

<pre><code>@Repository
public interface UserDataRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;UserData, Long&gt;,
      JpaSpecificationExecutor&lt;UserData&gt; {}
</code></pre>

<p>When I use the <code>save</code> method of the bean that gets created from that interface definition, on any of my objects, data gets saved to the database (so the database connection, hibernate properties, Entity definition and bean definitions seem to be ok).</p>

<p>But when I ""put"" objects into the map, hazelcast never writes them to database and it never complains. The map-store definition seems to be ignored.</p>

<p>The key is the same with id of the JPA object.</p>

<p>Any clue of what could be wrong or how to debug will be appreciated.</p>

I would like similar functionality in Google App Engine. I am aware that you can do validation on individual Properties by passing arguments to them in their declarations. However, if I wish to do more validation than that, is there some place within the model class declaration within which I can do that?</p>

<p>Also, along the same lines, sometimes a entity needs modification before it is actually persisted to the database. I might need to modify (transform) the entity right before it is actually written to the database. Is there some place in the entity class declaration that would allow me to do so?</p>

<p>I am aware that I can put these transformations/validations outside of the class. Bu this hardly seems like good OO design. It really seems like there should be hook methods that would automatically be called in a model for these sort of needs.</p>

<li>In case 1 no library (lib1.jar neither lib2.jar) is copied to the main WEB-INF/lib folder</li>
<li>In case 2 both libraries are copied inside the WEB-INF/lib folder of the web fragment generated jar file which in turn is copied to the main WEB-INF/lib folder.</li>

Step two of ""<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code</a>"" states ""Can you make a build in one step?"". My answer to this is currently no. My application is structured as follows:  </p>

<pre><code>+
+-MyApp // this is just a vanilla Java Application
+-MyWebApp // this Dynamic Java Web Application (deployed Tomcat and launches
           // a thread contained in MyApp) 
+-MyCommonStuff // these are common classes shared between MyApp and MyWebApp
                // Ex. Database access code &amp; business classes
</code></pre>

<p>In order to build and deploy my software I perform the following steps:<br>
1. Checkout MyApp, MyWebApp, MyCommonStuff from svn<br>
2. build MyCommonStuff.jar and copy to a ""libs"" directory<br>
3. build MyApp and copy to a ""libs"" directory<br>
4. build MyWebApp.war (Ant build.xml file specifies where MyApp.jar and MyCommonStuff.jar are located)<br>
5. The deploy portion of build.xml used Tomcat deployment tasks to deploy to a tomcat server.  </p>

<p>My question is does the Joel rule above apply to this scenario. i.e. should there be a  ""master"" build script which executes steps 1. to 5.?<br>
Should the script just be a normal #/bin/sh script or are there tools I can leverage. My preference would be stick to using Ant and linux console commands.<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>Connection here (rural area in Africa) is fragile (60-70% uptime), which is the main problem in this project. And our goal is to enable students to <strong>access course content as much as possible</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus, I'm thinking to have a local server constantly caching web content and provide accessibility during down-time. Although, due to the interactive nature of online learning (discussion board, quiz etc), the synchronization should be bi-directional between master and slaves. Plus, slave server should be able to provide transparency to end users, record all interactions locally and update master server once link is recovered (race condition and conflicts need to be solved intelligently). These slave servers will be deployed in either Raspberry Pi or other low-power consumption platform powered by solar. Load balancing would be bonus.</p>

<p><strong>In short, the system should share characteristics of web cluster and database replication, but emphasizing disconnected operation. Weak consistency is acceptable</strong></p>

<p>I've been looking into these areas:</p>

<li>Apache2 web server cluster</li>
<li>MySQL cluster</li>
</ol>

<p>Although most of them mainly focus on scalability and increasing throughput, which are the trend of networking but not main concerns in my project.</p>

<p>I'm still struggling to find a suitable mechanism/schema and would appreciate any advises!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have to convert all times from UTC to Eastern. This is not a biggie but adds a lot of code.</p></li>
<li><p>And the ""biggie"" is that I use a short-date time to reference the posts by passing in a query, ala blogger. The problem is that there is no way to convert the short date time to the proper UTC date because I'm lacking the posted time info.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hmm, any problem to just storing all dates in eastern time? This would certainly make it easier for the rest of the application but if I needed to change time zones everything would be stored wrong.</p>

<p>Update</p>

<p>@Jon, very much value your expertise, but I've decided storing UTC time in database is wrong. You may be able to convince me otherwise though!</p>

<p>So, let me give you the full skinny of it. I converted all the times to UTC, which required adding a lot more ""syntax"" in the declarative parts of the code.</p>

<p>What I'm coding is a blog, so I have 2 routes, a list route and a details route. The details route takes a short date and the name of the post which is assumes the combined to be unique. This is why it breaks down. I pass the short route in the query.</p>

<p>Depending on Time of Day, we can wrap around so that it is 29 or 30. So the short date must be correct because I don't have enough information in the query to determine how to convert the eastern time back to UTC.</p>

<p>I was storing a DatePosted ""short date"" with all times @ 12 AM for SQL purposes and a FirstModified long date for the time.  So, I said, okay no problem, I'll just store the short date in eastern and then convert long date to eastern. No go because I can't make those query work.</p>

<p>So, I decided I went about this all wrong. The date should always be stored in eastern time (the time I want to use). And then if the user wants to change time zone (not a requirement), we just go through all the entries and change them.</p>

<p>Maybe, I'm thinking about this wrong but in my case there will only ever be eastern time zone used, so it is a waste of time either way.</p>

<p>Look forward to any input on this! </p>

<p>The key problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm passing in a short date in the query. If this short date is in UTC then the date in the query could be off by 1. If I pass the short date as eastern then I will need a linq-to-sql syntax that can converted to SQL that will allow me to compare date times of different time zones. </li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks again for all help! </p>

<p>I use Ninject in my webapplication as IoC-Framework. I have tried to inject the Entity-Framework DbContext class to several classes in my code. I want to share a object instance by request. So I tried using the InRequestScope method from ninject. Problem is the instance is not shared. Instead I always get a new instance of DbContext.</p>

<p><strong>Code:</strong></p>

<p>First of all my implementation of DbContext class:</p>

<pre><code>public class BudgetContext : DbContext, IUnitOfWork
{
    public BudgetContext() : base(""DefaultConnection"") 
    {
        Database.SetInitializer&lt;BudgetContext&gt;(new DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges&lt;BudgetContext&gt;());
    }

    public DbSet&lt;Expense&gt; Expenses { get; set; }

    public int Commit()
    {
        return SaveChanges();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to inject the BudgetContext (my DbContext and also UnitOfWork) in two different places:</p>

<pre><code>public class UnitOfWorkAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    [Inject]
    public IUnitOfWork UnitOfWork { get; set; }  // injecting DbContext here (1)

    public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
    {
        base.OnActionExecuted(filterContext);
        if (filterContext.Exception == null)
        {
            UnitOfWork.Commit();
        }
    }
}

public class ExpenseRepository : IExpenseRepository
{
    private readonly BudgetContext context;

    public ExpenseRepository(IUnitOfWork context)  // injecting DbContext here (2)
    {
        this.context = (BudgetContext)context;
    }

    public void Add(Expense expense)
    {
        context.Expenses.Add(expense);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Both injected DbContext classes should be the same object instance for one request. My Ninject configuration in NinjectWebCommon.cs looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>...
private static void RegisterServices(IKernel kernel)
{
    kernel.Bind&lt;IUnitOfWork&gt;().To&lt;BudgetContext&gt;().InRequestScope();
    kernel.Bind&lt;IExpenseRepository&gt;().To&lt;ExpenseRepository&gt;();
    // ...
    kernel.Bind&lt;ExpensesController&gt;().To&lt;ExpensesController&gt;();
}    
... 
</code></pre>

<p>Did I configure the Ninject-Framework correct? What am I missing?
Thanks for helping me out.</p>

<p><strong>**Update:**</strong></p>

<p>I have implemented a factory to create my UnitOfWork(which basically is my DbContext class). The implementation of the factory looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class UnitOfWorkFactory : IUnitOfWorkFactory
{
    private IUnitOfWork unitOfWork;

    public IUnitOfWork Get()
    {
        if (unitOfWork == null)
            unitOfWork = new BudgetContext();
        return unitOfWork;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Ninject I use the following configuration for the new factory:</p>

<pre><code>kernel.Bind&lt;IUnitOfWorkFactory&gt;().To&lt;UnitOfWorkFactory&gt;().InRequestScope();
</code></pre>

<p>In my attribute I inject it this way:</p>

<pre><code>[Inject]
public IUnitOfWorkFactory UnitOfWorkFactory{ get; set; } 
public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
{
    base.OnActionExecuted(filterContext);
    if (filterContext.Exception == null)
    {
        var unitOfWork = UnitOfWorkFactory.Get();
        unitOfWork.Commit();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately I have no success. My DbContext always gets resetted after it reaches the attribute class.</p>

@account = Account.find_by_subdomain(account_subdomain)

def set_default_scope(account_id)
 default_scope :conditions=> { :account_id => account_id }
end
</pre>

<p>If I execute this code in ruby console with say @account1, <code>User.first</code> returns @account1 user whereas if I repeat the code with @account2 then <code>User.first</code> returns @account1 user instead of @account2. And this problem is not revealed while running app in local server but in staging server.</p>

<p>My guess is towards their states if they are really cached but not sure. Can someone explain in depth. </p>

<p>So far I did the following:
Create bucket www.a.com, give proper permission to make it web (visible for public) and uploaded all files. Obtain <a href=""http://www.a.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.a.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</a>.</p>

<p>I created Hosted Zone in AWS Route 53 and automatically got two Record Sets, NS and SOA.
Next, I added a CNAME for *.a.com. with value <a href=""http://www.a.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.a.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</a></p>

<p>Question is now, what do I add for an A record? I don't have an IP.
(As a cause of not having an A record, www.a.com works, but a.com does not work).</p>

<p>Can I use my dedicated server somehow to keep serving email? How should I setup MX given I have a WHM/cPanel server?</p>

<pre><code>T_PersonsData
==============
*#Person_Id  Field_01   Field_02     Field_03     ...  Field_N
-------------------------------------------------------------
01          'Bob'      'Simpson'    '1980-03-02' ...  NULL
02          'John'     'Smith'      '1972-04-10' ...  NULL

04          'Andrews'  '1978-10-02'  NULL        ...  NULL

T_PersonData_Definitions
=========================
*#Client_Id   *Field   Name             #Type_Id
-------------------------------------------------
101           01      'First name'      1 (String)
101           02      'Last name'       1 (String)
101           03      'Date of birth'   3 (DateTime)

203           N       'Address'         1 (String)

(* = Primary key)
(# = Foreign key)
</code></pre>

<p>to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>T_PersonsData_New
=================
*#Person_Id  *#Field_Id   Value
--------------------------------------
01           01           'Bob'
01           02           'Simpson'
01           03           '1980-03-02'

...         ...            ...              ...
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious advantages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scalability / flexibility (various amounts of field-types can be used)</li>
<li>preventing unnecessary NULL-entries</li>
<li>etc. ...</li>
</ul>

<p>However, a simple person-search for instance, like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Person_Id
  FROM T_Persons_Data
 WHERE Field_01 = 'Bob'
   AND FIeld_02 LIKE 'S%'
   AND ...
</code></pre>

<p>...where several search-options could be added as WHERE-clauses, would then look like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT Person_Id
  FROM T_PersonsData_New
 WHERE (SELECT Value 
          FROM T_PersonsData_New
         WHERE Field_Id = 01
           AND Person_Id = Person_Id) = 'Bob'
   AND (SELECT Value 
          FROM T_PersonsData_New
         WHERE Field_Id = 02
           AND Person_Id = Person_Id) LIKE 'S%'
   AND ...
</code></pre>

<p>... in the new design.</p>

<p>Of course, I would be grateful for any suggestions for a more elegant way to implement such a search. Would you recommend to change the DB-design like this?</p>

<p>Besides, I want to implement a (simple!) performance test to compare both designs. What would you suggest, how could that look like? Which scenarios would be most performance-critical?</p>

<p>as suggested in the answers makes the file list show an error instead of loading a list of files. Instead, I tried using the $TCA variable to define them. The error page shown by Typo3 is not shown anymore using this, but the editing page still can't be rendered successfully.</p>

<p>The TCEForm is simply not rendered and I don't know why. I'm not sure if my configuration in <code>ext_tables.php</code> contains a bad configuration (especially in the $TCA config I added) or if the problem comes from another file in the extension.</p>

<p>Without using extension methods we might have the method</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;DependencyObject&gt; GetDescendents(DependencyObject root) {}
</code></pre>

<p>that could be called with</p>

<pre><code>var descendents = GetDescendents(someControl);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var descendent in GetDescendents(someControl)) {}
</code></pre>

<p>Although there's nothing wrong with this I find the instance.method() notation to be more readable so I might consider making this an extension method with this signature</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;DependencyObject&gt; GetDescendents(this DependencyObject root) {}
</code></pre>

<p>allowing it to be called with</p>

<pre><code>var descendents = someControl.GetDescendents();
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var descendent in someControl.GetDescendents()) {}
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is whether you think this is reasonable or an abuse of extension methods. If it was simply a matter of declaring the function differently I wouldn't hesitate; but the fact that using an extension method requires it be coded in a different, static class makes me wonder if it's worth the effort or not. The example I'm using above is a fairly generic one and might have merit as an extension method that will be used in several places but often this is not the case and I would be coding the static class containing the extension in the same file as the single class that uses it.</p>

I have experimented with numeric, int, money and real data types and it's all a disaster. Currently I am using numeric(8), the ruby code is:</p>

<pre><code>result = DB[:house_data].select_group(:city).select_append{avg(:price)}.to_a.to_json

<p>and the output is:</p>

<p>I'd like to turn it into data like this where it's ""sorted"" by <code>to</code></p>

<pre><code>[ 
  { 
    to: 'foo@bar.com', 
    submittedSubs: [ [Object],[Object], [Object], [Object] ] 
  },
  { 
    to: 'foo1@bar.com', 
    submittedSubs: [ [Object] ] 
  },
  { 
    to: 'foo2@bar.com',
    submittedSubs: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ] 
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>I've tried this:</p>

<pre><code>spam[0].to.push('foo@bar.com');  
spam[0].to.push('foo1@bar.com'); 
spam[1].to.push('foo@bar.com');  
spam[1].to.push('foo2@bar.com'); 

console.log('data is',spam);

var byUser=[];
_.each(spam, function(data){
    _.each(data.to,function(addr){
        byUser.push({to:addr,submittedSubs:data.submittedSubs});
    });
});
console.log('attempt',_.merge(byUser));
</code></pre>

<p>But that gives me this:</p>

<pre><code>[ { to: 'foo@bar.com', submittedSubs: [ [Object] ] },
{ to: 'foo1@bar.com', submittedSubs: [ [Object] ] },
{ to: 'foo@bar.com', submittedSubs: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ] },
{ to: 'foo2@bar.com', submittedSubs: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ] } ]

A friend help me with a javascript that will take a selection I make using applescript and turns it into a layer mask.

<pre><code>Location* location = event.location;

<p>Obviously this is a workaround. Any ideas on correcting this?</p>

<h1><strong>EDIT</strong></h1>

<p>I have thought that maybe using <code>setRelationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching</code> for the <code>NSFetchRequest</code> that I used for the <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> with the @""location"" keypath would be a prettier workaround for the bug, but  strangely this bug has disappeared for the moment. The only thing I did was further the development of the app, which means that I did reinstall the app several times. So maybe it will resurface when the DB gets larger again.

From the little I gathered, the postInvokeAction is a better choice to use when handling objects in flashscope rather than the jsf preRenderView event. But what I noticed is that the listener method is been called twice! I felt that the preInvokeAction is analogous to the before phase listener and the postInvokeAction analogous to the after phase listener equivalent of the PhaseID.INVOKE_APPLICATION and as such should be called only once for the corresponding event. Is this correct? Kindly explain to me please.</p>

<p>So far we were running those tests against a HSQL DB, but since H2 is supposed to be faster we tried switching to H2 instead.</p>

<p>When looking at the execution time H2 is actually significantly faster (10-50%). But when running lots of test H2 seems to take a break in between resulting in an overall performance much worse than HSQLDB (800-900%).</p>

<p>Any ideas how to keep the good performance of single tests for the full test suite?</p>

<p>These are the URLs we tried for H2:</p>

<pre><code>jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;MVCC=true
jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;MODE=Oracle;MVCC=true

<p>This is what we use with HSQL DB:</p>

<pre><code>jdbc:hsqldb:mem:testdb
</code></pre>

<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>

<p>I tried to write a reprodocable test case but it's not so easy since we don't seem to have the problem when we only use simple jdbc. The tests get slow after approximately 500 tests that all use hibernate.</p>

<p>The only thing I noticed with VisualVM is that cpu usage is falling down close to zero with some noise the same time the tests start being slow.</p>

<p>Seems the test is waiting for some DB lock when creating the schema.</p>

<p><strong>edit 3:</strong></p>

<p>It seems to be a problem with multiple connections. When I replace jdbc:h2:mem:test (multiple connections in one process) with jdbc:h2:mem: (unnamed private; one connection), everything is fine (but ~10% slower than it was in hsql db).</p>

It seems that if I set any of the upper 16 bits of the 112-bit Group ID field, then MacOS/X will no longer accept those multicast packets.  My question is, is this a bug in the MacOS/X network stack, or is there some reason why setting the upper 16 bits of the Group ID field would affect routing behavior?</p>

<p>More specific info follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Multicasting from one Mac to another Mac always works (tested on 10.5 and 10.6)</p></li>
<li><p>Multicasting from Linux to Windows always works</p></li>
<li><p>Multicasting from Mac to Windows, or Windows to Mac, or Linux to Mac, only works if the upper 16 bits of the Group ID in the multicast address are set to zero.  For example:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
<li>ff02::666 works
<li>ff02:0:ffff::666 works
<li>ff02:1::666 doesn't work
<li>ff02:8000::666 doesn't work
</p>

<ul>
<li>In the ""doesn't work"" cases, WireShark running on the Mac shows that the Mac has received the multicast packets, but those packets are never passed on to the receiving application(s) on the Mac.  Does this mean that the Mac networking stack has a bug, or is there some deeper magic to multicast addressing that I'm not aware of?</li>

<p>This is the function that is called each time either the source or destination property is changed. The geometry that makes up the path seems to be being regenerated internally each time any of the control points change. Perhaps if there were a way to prevent the geometry from being regenerated until after all the relevant dependency properties have been set?</p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT:</em></strong> Mart's solution to use StreamGeometry sped it up exponentially; the function is nowhere close to a bottleneck. A little Reflecting suggests that PathGeometry uses StreamGeometry internally, and every time any of the dependency properties are changed, the StreamGeometry is recalculated. So this way just cuts out the middleman. The final result is:</p>

Viewing files is simply window.open(fileName), however whenever the filename has a # sign in it the file will fail to open with a dns error. I've tried escaping the # symbol with <code>%23</code>, and <code>\#</code> but it still fails to open... is there something special I need to do to escape the # symbol in a window.open url?</p>

<p>I've copied the filepath from the source file directly to a web browser and it opens fine, so I was assuming it was an issue with the window.open command.</p>

<p>EDIT: window.open code as requested. The url is always something local on our network such as \\path\fileName.pdf</p>

<pre><code>window.open('file:' + url, '', 'top=10,left=10,height=' + (screen.height - 50) + ',width=' + (screen.width - 50) + ',titlebar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=1');

<p>EDIT #2: I tried escaping the # right before the window.open string with %23 and displayed it with a prompt right before window.open, and I can copy/paste the string to IE and it opens fine, however the window.open code still fails.</p>

<p>Value window.open is giving me: <code>res://ieframe.dll/dnserror.htm#file://NetworkPath/Doc</code></p>

Most of the questions relate to blending or lighting or any variety of other tasks... in my case, the problem exists as a coloring flaw.</p>

<p>I'm wanting the shader to provide an exact color; that is, if I screenshot the thing I'm working on and use a color-picker, I want it to show up with the same color I'm using in code. Seems simple enough, right?</p>

<pre><code>void main(void)
{
    gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 175.0 / 255.0, 50.0 / 255.0, 1.0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also simple enough, right? Now, before someone yells ""It's the dividing! It won't get it perfectly at your number!"" I've tested with greyscale and found a way to make it 100% accurate with shades of grey, but something strange happens with color... I use this and, when I screenshot and use a color picker, I get: R: 68, G: 166, B: 45</p>

<p>Now, I'm not a mathematical genius, but I'm pretty sure 0.0 with no additional editing is flat 0 for red. Before this, I was trying to pass in a uniform color, so I started looking through my code to see if it was something strange I was doing, even though I was 95% sure I wasn't. Then I just replaced everything with this set-in-stone, hardcoded vec4 to see if IT came up with the right information.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas as to why I'm getting the strange red value, and perhaps why the other two values aren't QUITE there? Sure, they're close... but I'd like to get even closer; exact, if at all possible.</p>

<p>EDIT:
So... I'm not entirely familiar with glReadPixels, so if I did this wrong, let me know. However, my results are what I expect the output to be.</p>

<pre><code>GLfloat *data = new GLfloat[4];
    if (data)
    {
        glReadPixels(0, 0, 1, 1, GL_RGBA, GL_FLOAT, data);
        std::cout &lt;&lt; data[0] &lt;&lt; "" "" &lt;&lt; data[1] &lt;&lt; "" "" &lt;&lt; data[2] &lt;&lt; "" "" &lt;&lt; data[3] &lt;&lt; std::endl;

        delete data;

<p>The comments say it all. In short - the idea is to modify document DOM only once when inserting data. I would usually go HTML string approach (simply concatenating the same structure using a string), but I am interested whether anything similar to this might work as well.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>Everytime back to public_download_preview class, the RemoteDataTask is executed without considered whether there are cache file are present. I would like to implement in a way that if there are cache file there, it is then no necessary to fetch online images. If then how can that be modified in the codes?</p>

The technique is described pretty thoroughly <a href=""http://hofmannsven.com/2013/laboratory/svg-stacking/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Basically the idea is that you put multiple SVG elements into a single SVG file, and use CSS styling to hide all icons, except for the icon you currently want to display.  You select the icon you currently want to display using the CSS <code>:target</code> selector.</p>

<p>The technique works for me, except stacking multiple icons causes weird distortions in the displayed icon, even though all other icons are hidden.</p>

<p>In the example I'm working with, I simplified this to stacking only <em>two</em> icons: an US flag icon and an UK flag icon.</p>

<p>The (simplified) SVG file is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?&gt;

&lt;svg id=""svg153"" xmlns:rdf=""http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" height=""480"" width=""640"" version=""1.1"" xmlns:cc=""http://creativecommons.org/ns#"" xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""&gt;

    &lt;svg:style 
        xmlns:svg=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" type=""text/css""&gt;
        .i { display: none; }
        .i:target { display: block; }
    &lt;/svg:style&gt;

    &lt;svg:svg id=""uk"" xmlns:svg=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" class = ""i"" height=""480"" width=""640"" version=""1.1""&gt;
       &lt;!-- SVG elements to draw UK flag --&gt;
    &lt;/svg:svg&gt;

    &lt;svg:svg id=""us"" xmlns:svg=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" class = ""i"" height=""480"" width=""640"" version=""1.1""&gt;
       &lt;!-- SVG elements to draw US flag --&gt; 
    &lt;/svg:svg&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the CSS is embedded within the SVG file, in a <code>&lt;svg::style&gt;</code> element.  The CSS is simply: </p>

<pre><code>.i { display: none; }
.i:target { display: block; }
</code></pre>

<p>This way, any <code>svg::svg</code> element with <code>class=""i""</code> is automatically invisible, unless we specifically target it in the SVG url. So this way, to display a US flag icon, I would use the following HTML snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img 
    src=""flags.svg#us"" 
    width=""80"" 
    height=""60"" 
    alt=""SVG Stacked Image"" 
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, to display the UK flag I would change it to <code>src=""flags.svg#uk""</code></p>

<p>Anyway, all of this works wonderfully... except for a strange image distortion which occurs in both Firefox and Chrome when I stack the images.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of the US flag when I remove the (hidden) UK flag from the SVG file:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/B1s0j.png"" alt=""US flag icon without distortion""></p>

<p>As you can see, it looks fine.</p>

<p>But when I stack it in front of the UK flag, it looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/L9odp.png"" alt=""US flag icon with distortion""></p>

<p>As you can see, the image becomes strangely distorted - it almost looks like what happens to a low-quality JPEG when you get a lot of ""artifacts"" in the compressed image.</p>

<p>So why exactly is this happening?  The other images stacked with the US flag icon are all invisible, so why should they effect the visible icon at all?</p>

<p>I Googled around a lot looking for answers, and although there are definitely many issues and ""gotchas"" with the SVG stacking technique, they all relate to cross-browser compatibility. However, the technique works fine on most newer browsers up to and including IE9. Also, the distortion happens in both Firefox <em>and</em> Chrome, so this isn't likely to be some cross-browser issue, but rather something I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>So, what is causing this weird distortion when I apply the SVG stacking technique?</p>

"18996522","1","","","2013-09-25 04:57:12","","0","6720","<p>My site has a navbar on top and each category that is clicked slides down a div which contains content. However, as of now all of this content is loaded all at once when going to the site, which is totally unnecessary once I add some more articles, posts, images etc.</p>

<p>I want to dynamically load content from an external file (so say, when you click ""about"" in the navbar it slides down to reveal the content of ""about.html"" into a div).
For organizational sake, I'd hoped to have each section to have it's own .html file so I could easily edit in the future. Basically, I want jquery to load the wrapper div from something like ""*variableSectionName"".html"" into a div.</p>

<p>Here is the jquery code, uses a variable ""section"" to display that div id's content. This works properly, but I cannot get a jquery .load() to load something like .load(section+"".html""+id):</p>

<pre><code>    $(document).ready(function() {
    var active_section;
    $(""#slider a.section"").click(function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        var section = $(this).attr('href');
        if (section !== active_section) {
            $('.pagedrop').slideUp('slow');
            $('.lower').find(section).slideDown('slow', function() {
            active_section = section;
            });
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here are what the links look like in the index.html, several of these with different names. My current jquery code gets the href ""#about"" from this and uses it to make only one section visible at a time:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#about"" id=""aboutlink""&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The index.html contains a div formatted for content already, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div class=""lower""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""pagedrop"" id=""content""&gt;
&lt;!-- Container to lazy-load content on a per page basis --&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is a sample of what one of the external files looks like. These external files are only  blocks, and do not contain the usual html/head/body tags:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""about""&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;img src=""images/divider.png""/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;p:first-letter&gt;Q&lt;/p:first-letter&gt;uisque venenatis interdum purus, non sagittis turpis feugiat vel. Mauris accumsan luctus lacus, sed facilisis est vehicula eget. Etiam tempor lacus ac fermentum facilisis. Donec semper urna quis odio lobortis dignissim. Duis et metus non arcu venenatis dapibus ut sit amet enim. Nullam quis elit odio.

        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In short: I want to load  from ""about.html"" into the  box on the ""index.html""</p>

<p>From what i've read so far there seem to be differences concerning the javascript engines of the browsers, that can cause ""incorrect"" code to work properly.</p>

<p>So i guess its a small mistake that causes firefox to refuse working, but i've tried my best to find it and sadly this seems to insufficient :-P</p>

<p>I'd be happy if you guys can help me or at least can come up with some kind of idea!</p>

<p>Thanks already!</p>

<p>So two more tries yield similar errors.</p>

The scraper has about 15000 pages to parse into approximately 400,000 items. I've got the code to parse the items to run instantaneously (almost) but the portion that downloads the page from the server is still extremely slow. I'd like to overcome that through concurrency. However, I can't rely on EVERY page needing to be parsed EVERY time. I've tried with a single ThreadPool (like multiprocessing.pool, but done with threads - which should be fine since this is an I/O bound process), but I couldn't think of a graceful (or working) way of getting ALL of the threads to stop when the date of the last index item was greater than the item we were processing. Right now, I'm working on a method using two instances of ThreadPool - one to download each page, and another to parse the pages. A simplified code example is:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python2

import httplib2
from Queue import PriorityQueue
from multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool
from lxml.html import fromstring

pages = [x for x in range(1000)]
page_queue = PriorityQueue(1000)

url = ""http://www.google.com""

def get_page(page):
    #Grabs google.com
    h = httplib2.Http("".cache"")
    resp, content = h.request(url, ""GET"")
    tree = fromstring(str(content), base_url=url)
    page_queue.put((page, tree))
    print page_queue.qsize()

def parse_page():
    page_num, page = page_queue.get()
    print ""Parsing page #"" + str(page_num)
    #do more stuff with the page here
    page_queue.task_done()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    collect_pool = ThreadPool()
    collect_pool.map_async(get_page, pages)
    collect_pool.close()

    parse_pool = ThreadPool()
    parse_pool.apply_async(parse_page)
    parse_pool.close()


     parse_pool.join()
     collect_pool.join()
     page_queue.join()
</code></pre>

<p>Running this code however, doesn't do what I expect - which is to fire off two threadpools: one populating a queue and another pulling from it to parse. It begins the collect pool and runs through it and then begins the parse_pool and runs through it (I assume, I've not let the code run long enough to get to the parse_pool - the point is that collect_pool is all that seems to be running). I'm fairly sure I've messed something up with the order of the calls to join(), but I can't for the life of me figure out what order they're supposed to be in.
My question is essentially this: Am I barking up the right tree here? and if so, what the hell am I doing wrong? If I'm not - what would your suggestions be</p>

<p>Here, I initialize and assign the numeric variable nClusters to a value of 7. Later, in the document, I call upon it in a R code chunk, and that seems to work okay. However, I then try to call it in a LaTeX section (outside the R code chunk), and this is causing problems:</p>

<pre><code>\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{float, hyperref}
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{pgffor}

\begin{document}

&lt;&lt;options, echo=FALSE&gt;&gt;=
nClusters = 7 # I only want to define nClusters once

&lt;&lt;echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,results='asis'&gt;&gt;=
# Here the call to nClusters works
for (i in 2:nClusters){
  print(paste(""This is number"",i))
}
@

% Here the call to nClusters does not work

\foreach \i in {2,3,...,nClusters} {

<p>The discrepancy is occurring in the LaTeX call to the variable, because if I hard-code in 7, then it works. Hence, my question is: Is it possible to create a global variable in knitr that can be called in both the R code chunks and LaTeX parts?</p>

<p>Let's for example say I have this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {

    $('#searchInput').keyup(function () {
        // Do something
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>However my input field with id=""searchInput"" is not loaded when the DOM is loaded - it is being loaded later on using an ajax, when the user clicks a specific element.
Now my input field with id=""searchInput"" is loaded, but the keyup(function) does not listen to #searchInput since it was not loaded in the original DOM.</p>

<p>For now, my only solution has been to do like this:</p>

<pre><code>function loadEvents() {
    $('#searchInput').keyup(function () {
        // Do something
    });
}

$(document).ready(function () {
    loadEvents();
});
</code></pre>

<p>And then on ajax succes:</p>

<pre><code>succes:
    function() {
        loadEvents();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works... But I can't help to think that there is a smarter way...</p>

<p>I have multiple functions within my loadEvents(), and for me I does not seem like the best solution to reload all functions every time an ajax call is successful?</p>

<p>Of course I could then make many different ajax calls, which on ajax succes executes specific functions needed, but then I will have to create many different ajax functions.</p>

<p>Any better solutions out there?</p>

I have a simple app, that's supposed to list a bunch of text data (generally between one-liners to a few paragraphs of text) in a TabControl. Everything else works smoothly, but my attempts at dynamically resizing the Label / TextBox -controls I use to display the text are failing miserably.</p>

<p>Here's the way I've tried doing it:</p>

<pre><code>/*
Variables: 
s = The text intended for the TextBox
NewTB = TextBox object
width = Intended width
whiteSpaceAdjustment = amount of pixels per line to adjust ""wasted"" whitespace due to wrapping
*/

String[] linesArray = s.Replace(Environment.NewLine, ""\n"").Split(new char[] { '\n' });

int lines = 0;

int lineHeight = g.MeasureString(
        s.Replace(""\n"", """").Replace(""\r"", """"),
        LabelFont
    ).ToSize().Height;

foreach (String str in linesArray) {
    if (str.Length == 0) {
        lines++;
        continue;
    }
    szz = g.MeasureString(str, LabelFont).ToSize();
    lines += szz.Width / (width - whiteSpaceAdjustment);
    lines += (szz.Width % width) != 0 ? 1 : 0;
}
NewTB.Height = lines * lineHeight;
NewTB.Width = width;
</code></pre>

<p>...but the problem is that the range needed for whiteSpaceAdjustment is too huge. When it's large enough to actually work on the most extreme cases (paragraphs made mostly up of really long words), most boxes end up being a line or two too tall.</p>

<p>I'm probably going to have to implement word wrapping myself, but before I go there, is there anybody with a nice clean solution ready for this?</p>

<p>I'd be forever grateful!</p>

<p>Right now I have these commands, which create the field, add a random string and add a <code>unique</code> key, but obviously when the last command executes, there are fields that have equal random strings which throw an error when trying to add the key.</p>

<p><em>(I have about 20k rows, so with a ""100k random number string"" there still is quite a chance of duplicates - but even with longer strings there always is the chance, so how to I handle the basic problem of possible duplicates?)</em></p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE `users` ADD `nick` VARCHAR( 55 ) NOT NULL AFTER `id`;

UPDATE `users` SET `nick` = CONCAT('user_', FLOOR(RAND() * 100000));

ALTER TABLE `users` ADD UNIQUE ( `nick` );
</code></pre>

<p>My question is how to either make sure all the random strings are distinct, or how else to achieve this upgrade and generation of random strings on one swipe (and preferably with sql only).</p>

<p>(The accepted answer in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4661144/mysql-alter-table-add-column-with-unique-random-value"">this similar SO topic</a> does not really provide a solution.)</p>

<p>[EDIT: So far the table has not had any user nicknames. An update under development will add functionality for users to set their user nickname once, but until users do so, I want them to be assigned a temporary, unique and random user nickname - and for security reasons I do not want to use the primary id in that user nickname]</p>

<p>[EDIT:
I tried the suggested hashing of the user id and found that with 8 signs of the hash it performs without duplicates (whereas 6 still has duplicates fairly often, for 20k rows), but I still wonder if there is no other way to approach this than by pushing the odds of a duplicate smaller.</p>

<p>Otherwise this works:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE `users` ADD `nick` VARCHAR( 55 ) NOT NULL AFTER `id`;

UPDATE `users` SET `nick` = CONCAT('user_', SUBSTR(MD5(`users`.`id`), 1, 8));

ALTER TABLE `users` ADD UNIQUE ( `nick` );

<p><strong>Sometimes</strong> when I click the button to load a video, I get a <code>java.util.ConcurrentModificationException</code>raised. Other times, it's perfectly fine.</p>

<p>I put the calls to .loadAndPlayMediaA() and .prepareMedia() <em>(see below)</em> inside a .runLater(Runnable) to try to prevent this, but it has not worked. What am I doing wrong, please?</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p><strong>My Code</strong> (below) is called by a listener on a button:</p>

<pre><code>testButton.setOnAction(new EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;(){

<p><strong>The Methods</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>public void prepareMedia()
{
    view.setMediaPlayer(jfxMediaPlayer.getMediaPlayer());  &lt;- This is the line the error points to
    view.setPreserveRatio(preserveRatio);
    view.setFitWidth(miniaturePlayerX);
    view.setFitHeight(miniaturePlayerY);
    playerSlider.setValue(0.0); 

}
</code></pre>

<p><em>This one is inside a class called jfxMediaPlayer</em>:</p>

<pre><code>public void loadAndPlayMediaA(Media playableMedia)
{
    if((player != null))
    {
        player.stop();
    }
    media = playableMedia;
    player = new MediaPlayer(media);
    player.setAutoPlay(true);
}

<p>There are a number of things I don't understand from this code.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the method <code>current_user?</code>, is <code>current_user</code> a variable or is it an invocation of the method <code>current_user</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't understand how to determine the value of <code>current_user</code> in this context.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the method <code>current_user</code>, <code>@current_user</code> is an instance variable. What is it an instance variable of (i.e. what class?)?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you look under the <code>sign_in(user)</code> method, you can see that <code>self.current_user</code> is assigned the value of the object <code>user</code>. But (assuming self is of the class UsersController because <code>UsersController &lt; ApplicationController</code> and in the definition of <code>ApplicationController</code> there is a line that include <code>SessionsHelper</code>) there is no definition of an instance variable <code>current_user</code> for the <code>self</code> object.</p>

<ul>
<li>How come in <code>current_user=</code> we use the <code>@current_user</code> but in <code>current_user?</code> we just use <code>current_user</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>I've done h the prerequisite searching on StackOverflow but haven't found a good explanation for all these differences. A big part of what I'm trying to learn is when to use <code>@current_user</code>, <code>current_user</code>, <code>:current_user</code>. I'm most familiar with C, C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript. If there are analogues to these languages, it would help me understand better what's going on.</p>

<p>My app crashes sometimes when a user logs in for the first time thru Facebook, the reason of this crash is that for some reason (and I say it again) SOMETIMES this user is created empty on parse's data base, it only gets an Auth Data, and every other field is empty, so when I get the parseUser its completely empty and everything  crashes. I know I could validate everything so it won't crash, but my question is WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? AND WHY IT DOESN'T HAPPENS ALWAYS?

<p>So far I managed to create a new MultiUserChat room, join it, and send invites out. My problem as of now is how to find out who is in the chat room if someone joined the chat room or left it. I thought that adding a presence listener to the chat room might do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>muc.addParticipantListener(new PacketListener() {

    @Override
    public void processPacket(Packet packet) {
        System.out.println(""user count changed, now:"" + muc.getOccupcantsCount());
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The Javadoc for <code>addParticipantListener</code> states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adds a packet listener that will be notified of any new Presence packets sent to the group chat. Using a listener is a suitable way to know when the list of occupants should be re-loaded due to any changes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I thought that this would work. However, within the <code>processPacket</code> method <code>muc.getOccupantsCount()</code> as well as <code>muc.getOccupants()</code> both return the values BEFORE the <code>processPacket</code> call.
So if there is only one user in the chat room and another joins, the output will be</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>user count changed, now: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there are two users and another joins, the output is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>user count changed, now: 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if there are three users and one leaves, the output is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>user count changed, now: 3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Respectively, <code>muc.getOccupants()</code> won't give me the user that just joined when called within <code>processPacket</code>, and still gives me the user that just left.</p>

<p>How can I effectively find out who currently is in the chat room from within <code>processPacket</code>?</p>

If the array has one item in it (not really an array then), it works, but more than one it fails.  The SharePoint list contains a date (format of M/dd/yyyy), if my script is run within three days from that date it will do some more things, otherwise fail.  Eventually I need to have it at sixty days back, so to keep the script manageable I'd like to get the array working.  Easily saving sixty days back to an array will be my next challenge.</p>

<p>My hope was that I would be able to have an array of dates, relative to the current day, to use in the script.  A set hard date will not work.  I am trying to see if the date from SharePoint is in the array.</p>

<pre><code>$item is an item from the SharePoint list, and the stuff in brackets [""...""] is the column header.
</code></pre>

<p>This is how I am getting the dates:</p>

<pre><code>$today = (get-date).ToString(""M/dd/yyyy"")
$yesterday = (get-date).AddDays(-1).ToString(""M/dd/yyyy"")
$twodaysago = (get-date).AddDays(-2).ToString(""M/dd/yyyy"")
</code></pre>

<p>This is my array:
<code>enter code here</code>$scheduledate = $today,$yesterday,$twodaysago</p>

<p>This is the logic:</p>

<pre><code> if(($item[""Computer""] -eq ""$computer"") -and ($item[""Status""] -eq ""No"") -and ($item[""Schedule Date""] -contains $scheduledate))
</code></pre>

<p>Other attempts:</p>

<pre><code>If $scheduledate is set to this it works:  
</code></pre>

<p>$scheduledate = $today</p>

<p>If $scheduledate is set to this it does not work:  <code>$scheduledate = $today,$yesterday,$twodaysago</code></p>

<p>I have even created the array explicitly, it does not work:  <code>$scheduledate = @($today,$yesterday,$twodaysago)</code></p>

<p>Quotes, spaces, have been tried.</p>

<p>I have tried these:</p>

<pre><code>-and ($item[""Schedule Date""] -eq $scheduledate)) - works if dates match

-and ($item[""Schedule Date""] -contains $scheduledate)) - works with single item in array

-and ($item[""Schedule Date""] -match $scheduledate)) - ?

-and ($item[""Schedule Date""] -like $scheduledate)) - ?
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but is not ideal for sixty days:  if(($item[""Computer""] -eq ""$computer"") -and </p>

<pre><code>($item[""Status""] -eq ""No"") -and `

<p>I would like that a user trying to access an application for X number of times from a specific IP and failing to authenticate himself on application should not see the application webpage/instead an error page be shown indicating Security violation.</p>

<p>SO, a user from Ip 10.10.10.10:9000 trying to access application for 10 times and failing to authenticate himself on application should on 11th attempt be shown an error page indicating security violation.</p>

<p>Can someone suggest how can we approach this ?. </p>

I am developing an Excel add-in in VBA, and part of it involves the use of the WebBrowser control to display a (known) webpage inside a form and access its DOM components.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this leaves me at the whim of the user's version of Internet Explorer.<br>
For our actual webpages, we can use Chrome Frame support to allow IE users to see the page in the way we intend without worrying about their browser version, but the WebBrowser control does not see the browser plugins. </p>

<p>I have taken a look at WebKit.NET and GeckoFX.
They sort of work, but unless I am completely missing something, they don't seem to have Javascript or CSS engines in them at all. Or (in the case of GeckoFX), they are using old engines. That makes them useless.</p>

<p>Is there any ActiveX control that I can embed in a VBA form which works like the WebBrowser control (with a similar-if-not-identical API), uses a different rendering engine that keeps up with the latest version of Mozilla/Chrome/Opera, and still supports Javascript and CSS correctly?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>(Some edits based on the comments)</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDITED AGAIN:</strong> I found out from one answer below that I was looking at an outdated version of GeckoFX, but the newest version looks promising. But now I have a new related question: <strong>How do I include GeckoFX in VBA?</strong> Windows does not allow me to register it as a COM object.  Do I have to build it myself from source somehow? Or what?</p>

<p>This query is incredibly slow. With only 30 costumers and about 300 orders it takes almost 10 seconds to finish!</p>

<p>I'm querying using <code>SqlCEDataAdapter</code>. I also tried using <code>SqlCeResultSet</code>, but the difference is negligible. Also, I have an index on <code>Orders.CustomerId</code> (creating it didn't make much difference, though).</p>

<p>If I do this in C or Fortran I would define these parametes as global variables (it si most convenient). Here when I'm using scipy weave I have to pass them as arguments of functions. Which I don't like because <strong>I have to edit header of many functions every time I add or remove a parameter</strong>. Also the calling of the function can slow down because of passing many arguments (it is performance critical tight loop).</p>

<p>for example in the following code the parameters <code>k, x_surf, C6, C12, CQ, zeta, e0</code> and <code>T1, beta</code> <strong>are passed in header of several dependent functions again and again</strong>. </p>

<pre><code>inline double getForce( 
    double x, double Q,   
    double k, double x_surf, double C6, double C12, double CQ, double zeta, double e0
){ ... }

inline void move( 
    double dt, double imass, double T1, double beta,   
    double k,  double x_surf, double C6, double C12, double CQ, double zeta, double e0,        
    double &amp;x, double &amp;v, double &amp;Q 
){
   ...
   double f = getForce( x, Q,     k, x_surf, C6, C12, CQ, zeta, e0 );
   ...
}

void trj2buff( 
    double dt, int nsteps, double mass, double T1, double beta,    
    double k, double x_surf, double C6, double C12, double CQ, double zeta, double e0,         
    double  x_start, double  v_start, double  Q_start,
    double* x_buff,  double* v_buff,  double* Q_buff 
){
   ...
   move( dt, imass,  T1, beta,     k, Q, x_surf, C6, C12, CQ, zeta, e0,        x, v, Q );
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>One solution would be probably to pass all the parameters as a single <code>double*</code> buffer (but it would make the code less readable because it would nod be named). Or better as an user defined <code>struct{}</code>. But it is not clear to me, how to use <code>struct{}</code> with scipy weave in this case.</p>

<li>Registration country</li>
<li>ISP name, address, abuse email</li>

<li><code>whoislookup</code></li>

<p>I've tryied the following code I found here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3470693/android-get-location-or-prompt-to-enable-location-service-if-disabled/3470757#3470757"">Android get location or prompt to enable location service if disabled</a></p>

    // Start loction service
    LocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager)[OUTERCLASS].this.getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);

        // Provider is enabled
        locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(providerName, 20000, 100, [OUTERCLASS].this.locationListener);
    } else {
        // Provider not enabled, prompt user to enable it

}
});
</code></pre>

<p>But I receive a couple of errore, maybe because I cannot understand it as well !!!</p>

<p>These are my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why it's necessary to declare a Button (gpsButton) and where/how I can create it?</li>
<li>The code can be overall putted after the class MapActivity or must be putted after the first onCreate?</li>
<li>What is OUTERCLASS?</li>
<li>A part of the permission on Manifest(I already have) I've to change something on Layout?</li>
</ul>

<p>So, generally speaking someone can explain me better how I can use this code and what modifies I need to do.</p>

<p>If you need I can send out my entire java code.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your availability.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is add new content at the top of the table. If the top of the table is <strong>visible</strong>, the <strong>new row would push the rest of the content down</strong>. But if the first row of the table is <strong>not visible</strong>, the table would <strong>silently add another row on top without scrolling.</strong> </p>

<p>I'm doing this to <strong>prevent the table scrolling to the top from interrupting the user</strong> browsing data. If I ask the table to simply scroll to the new insertion point, the user's position within the table would be lost, frustrating the user.</p>

<p>One of the ways I can try to implement this is by <strong>inserting data into an NSMutableArray at index 0. Would this work?</strong> An extra question: how expensive is inserting data at the beginning of an NSMutableArray. I would expect that such operation is optimized, but would like to make sure. What am I missing with this implementation?</p>

Admin, Partner, and Employee have administrative access over clients. Basically what I have done is created a Rails app where clients can upload documents to their vendor (partners). Everything works great except for the client level access. I have two codes; partercode and client code. Partners can only see files where the file's partercode field equals the partner's partner code. This works just fine. However, the client can only see files where the partnercode matches and the clientcode matches. Below is my client section. What is working is that the client IS only allowed to see the partercode files, but it is setting them see other clients that belong to the partner. (by typing in the number in the URL). I doubt this would ever be an issue, but it's a security hole that I would definitely want closed.</p>

Just need to know a way to implement something like [%0]=[%0]+4 rather than [%0]!
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>main optimization</strong> will come by running the instructions numbered 1-8 in parallel using <strong>VMLA</strong> instruction in NEON.</p>

<ol>
<li>We may do that by loading array c[8] into registers q0 and q1 and loading array src[256] into registers q2 and q3.After this we use VMLA,VADD,VPADD to get the result in the variable sum.</li>
<li>The <strong>problem being faced</strong> is <strong>how to load the elements of array src</strong> (as src[0],src[4],src[8] and so on)since the only way i know how to load an array is by [%1]! which only loads an array sequentially(as src[0],src[1],src[2] and so on).</li>
</ol>

<p>Also <strong>how may the pointer src be incremented by 2</strong> in instruction 9?</p>

<p>I tried to create an exemplar which did just what he suggests (<em>code at the end</em>):</p>

<pre><code>// use '&lt;&gt;' to specialize the function template with the class template's type
friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; &lt;&gt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const foo&lt;T&gt;&amp; f)
</code></pre>

<p>It results in a <strong>compiler error</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>error: defining explicit specialization ‘operator&lt;&lt; &lt;&gt;’ in friend declaration
</code></pre>

<p>Explicitly declaring the template parameter in the specialization doesn't work either:</p>

<pre><code>friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; &lt;T&gt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const foo&lt;T&gt;&amp; f) // same error
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, changing from using a specialization to use a <strong>friend function template</strong> instead <em>does</em> work:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename U&gt;
friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const foo&lt;U&gt;&amp; f) // this works
</code></pre>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>what is causing the first error?</li>
<li>how can I explicitly specialize the <code>ostream operator</code> for the surrounding class template specialization?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exemplar code below:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// fwd declarations
template&lt;typename T&gt; struct foo;
template&lt;typename T&gt; std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp;, const foo&lt;T&gt;&amp;);

template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct foo
{
    foo(T val)
        : _val(val)
    {}

    friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; &lt;&gt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const foo&lt;T&gt;&amp; f) // error line
    //template&lt;typename U&gt;
    //friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const foo&lt;U&gt;&amp; f) // this works
    {

<p>All of my other references to Cordova classes work fine, so Im not sure whats going on?</p>

<p>FYI</p>

<p>I know others had issues that required updating Android version as well as cleaning the project but my project is currently at the latest (afaik) 5.1.1 22 and I have cleaned many times.</p>

<p>So the first entity <code>Publication</code> is defined as with some other internal scalar properties:</p>

<pre><code>    public class Publication : IDataErrorInfo{

    [Key]
    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
    public int PublicationId { get; set; }

    [InverseProperty(""Publications"")]
    public virtual ICollection&lt;Group&gt; Groups { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>and the other class in the same way:</p>

<pre><code>    public class Group : IDataErrorInfo {

    [Key]
    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
    public int GroupId { get; set; }

    [InverseProperty(""Groups"")]
    public ICollection&lt;Publication&gt; Publications { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>which according to numerous articles should be fine.</p>

<p>There are several problems I occur. AT first:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I create a new publication and assert it some Groups. All is stored to the db. But then I restart the program, the same particular publication has ICollection set to null. Therefore the information about relationship with Group has been deleted.I don't know why :(</li>
<li>When I try to update exisiting Publication entry with Group relationship, the DBUpdateException is thrown with the following text: </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>An error occurred while saving entities that do not expose foreign key properties for their relationships. The EntityEntries property will return null because a single entity cannot be identified as the source of the exception. Handling of exceptions while saving can be made easier by exposing foreign key properties in your entity types</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the inner exception is the same, and in the inner exception of this one is the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_<em>Publicat</em>_3AF5D6A10AD2A005'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.PublicationGroups'.
  The statement has been terminated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm asserting the the new values of the Publication as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var entry = db.Publications.First(a =&gt; a.PublicationId == publKey);
entry.Groups = db.Groups.
                Where(a =&gt; groupKeys.Contains(a.GroupId)).
                Select(b =&gt; b).
                ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>publKey</code> is the key of the edited entity and <code>groupKeys</code> is the List of GroupId which should be the publication be related to.</p>

<p>after calling <code>db.SaveContext()</code> the exception is thrown</p>

<p>This topic has been covered by numerous articles, but I didn't find any solution. All of the examples are using the same code, but apparently I'm missing something. I'm using SQL Ce 4.0 as the persistance data storage.</p>

<p>Thank you guys for answer, I'm dealing with it since yesterday, but don't why this happens</p>

First there is a standard native libJPEG.dylib (in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/). But if you are using MacPorts, you can also have a port-related libjpeg.dylib in (in /opt/local/lib). The latter may for example have been installed as a dependency for some other port.</p>

<p>This creates a problem when you link against your system libJPEG (which is preferred). 
Then if <code>/opt/local/lib</code> is in DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, that path will be prioritised when searching for a dynamic lib, resulting in a runtime error when loading symbols:</p>

<pre><code>dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart

/System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO
 Expected in: /opt/local/lib/libJPEG.dylib

<p>So I have two questions (likely related):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is a good way of solving the actual problem (removing <code>/opt/local/lib</code> from <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> obviously solves it but creates problems for other dependencies)?</p></li>
<li><p>What other paths are searched for dynamic libs (I.e. Where is the ""/System/Library"" path specified) and why does DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH rank higher priority-wise?</p></li>

<p>So, I am just trying to make a simple AJAX GET request like this:</p>

<pre><code>var app = {
    initialize: function() {
        this.bindEvents();
    },

    bindEvents: function() {
        document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);
    },

    onDeviceReady: function() {
       var url='http://test.dev/app_dev.php/stuff/add-external?callback=test';
       alert('connecting to '+url);

        $.ajax({
            type: 'GET',
            url: url,
            dataType: 'jsonp',
            crossDomain: true,
            contentType: ""application/json"",
            success: function(res) {
                alert('success:'+res);
            },
            error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {
               alert(xhr.status);
              alert(thrownError);
            },
            complete: function(data) {
                alert('complete');
            }
       });
}
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>I use jsonp even though it seems not required on phonegap, but helps testing on browser.
So this works when I test with browser: alerts ""connecting to url"", then ""success"", then ""complete"". On phonegap however it just alers ""conneting to url"" and then nothing.</p>

<p>I added <code>&lt;access origin=""*"" /&gt;</code> to config.xml, and also to res/xml/config/xml. Also added these permissions to AndroidMainfest.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt; 
&lt;manifest xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"" android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustPan"" package=""com.phonegap.exampleapp"" android:versionName=""1.1"" android:versionCode=""1""&gt;

  &lt;uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"" /&gt; 
  &lt;uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"" /&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>This is my res/xml/plugins.xml</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt; 
   &lt;plugins&gt;
     &lt;plugin name=""NetworkStatus"" value=""org.apache.cordova.NetworkManager"" /&gt;

<p>I am using a controller to handle the business logic in my application, and I am trying to keep my view from doing any logic at all.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is create a directory in my project that holds the custom command classes so that I can decouple them from the controller and the view, but I would still like them to be called from the view such as a normal commmand is.</p>

<p>I have also seen the use of a DelegateCommand class, but am not quite sure if that is the direction I want to head in.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to have an arbitrary custom command class such as the following</p>

<pre><code>public CustomCommand: ICommandd
{
    public bool CanExecute(object parameter)
    {
        //arbitrary logic
    }

    public void Execute(object parameter)
    {

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that I would have 10-20 of these, and I want to keep them separate from everything else, and have them be called when needed.</p>

<p>I know that there is a way I can separate my custom commands, but am not quite sure.</p>

<p>I am new to using commands, so I still am trying to get a hold of the concept.</p>

<pre><code>-(void) addBricks:(CGSize)size {

        }

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that, while all of the bricks will move to the right when the scene starts, they don't move back and repeat the action over and over like I want them to. I think it may have something to do with giving them all the same name when they are programmatically created, but I know the scene retains all of the bricks despite them having the same name.</p>

<p>How can I get it so that all of the SpriteNodes (bricks) that I create keep moving back and forth forever?</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of generics in Java for all the obvious reasons. It helps me enormously as I work with a huge variety of odd bits of code and I often have to go back to old stuff. Today I found myself with a classic parameter misplacement bug which I probably wouldn't have written in the pre-generic days - they have made me a bit lazy.</p>

<p>I'd like to know if there is a language feature, either in Java or perhaps as a similar concept in other languages, which takes the type safety of generics and extends it to a kind of semantic safety. Specifically I want to help trap the kind of errors which result from putting the right thing in the wrong place.</p>

<p>A simple example:</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; myMap = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
String myKey = ""key"";
String myVal = ""value"";
myMap.put(myVal, myKey);
</code></pre>

<p>Which no compiler will catch. I could <s>subclass <code>String</code></s>make wrappers to give me a <code>Key</code> type and a <code>Value</code> type, I suppose. I could name my variables to indicate their use (as I've done in this example). What else?</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>out of academic interest, what is this concept called and what languages have this feature?</li>
<li>In the absence of any such language feature, what are the best practices to avoid this kind of error?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm trying to build a comment box that simulates Facebook, where Shift+Enter increases the rows in the textarea while Enter submits the form. I already can capture both events correctly, I'm just wondering if Javascript alone can edit a page's element attributes since it has already been loaded, or if there's another way to do it.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>My code block looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).keypress(function(e) {
    if (e.which == 13 &amp;&amp; e.shiftKey) {
        this.rows++;
        e.preventDefault();
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>But this still doesn't seem to work. Again, I've tried placing alerts into this code block so I'm certain the Shift+Enter event is captured, but the textarea's rows just doesn't increase. Any ideas why? :/</p>

<p>Right, so I'm using AForge.net to capture an image. It provides an event, which is triggered for each new frame received, which in my code looks like this:</p>

<p>Memory usage is very stable so long as the window remains stationary, but as soon as I grab the window form and start moving it about, memory usage keeps going up. The reason I've been led to believe it might be related to the picturebox, is because as soon as I turn the ""stopCapturing"" bool to true, memory stops rising, even if I'm moving the window around the screen. ""stopCapturing"" is not used for anything else, and the event continues triggering as normal, the only difference is the image being displayed in the picturebox. I'm at a loss as to the cause, so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I am creating a website where users can add their emoticons, and call them inside their posts by typing in the special code for an emoticon.</p>

<p>This is what I have done and it works to some extent:</p>

<pre><code>//FETCH FROM THE DB

while ( $row = mysql_fetch_array($fetch)) {
$table[] = array(
$row['shortcuttag1'] =&gt; ""&lt;img class='x' src='"" . $row['tag1smilo'] . ""' /&gt;"",
$row['shortcuttag2'] =&gt; ""&lt;img class='x' src='"" . $row['tag2smilo'] . ""' /&gt;"",
$row['shortcuttag3'] =&gt; ""&lt;img class='x' src='"" . $row['tag3smilo'] . ""' /&gt;"",
$row['shortcuttag4'] =&gt; ""&lt;img class='x' src='"" . $row['tag4smilo'] . ""' /&gt;"",
$row['shortcuttag5'] =&gt; ""&lt;img class='x' src='"" . $row['tag5smilo'] . ""' /&gt;""
);
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a multidimensional array with emoticons uploaded by one user.</p>

<p>When I use <code>strtr($txt,$table[0])</code>, it works with the array[0] and the others, but I want to change the special code to emoticons that are located in and around all the subarrays.</p>

<p>Therefore, what I have done is to merge the array like so:</p>

<pre><code>$oneDim = call_user_func_array('array_merge',$table);
</code></pre>

<p>I got the one dimensional array with all SpecialCode => Image fields.</p>

<p>But the <code>strtr($txt,$oneDim)</code> stopped working with that; it is not showing anything.</p>

<p>I am worried because I have tried a few different ways to merge the array other than <code>call_user_func_array()</code> and it gives the same result.</p>

<p>Maybe there is someone that could help me with that. I will be very grateful.</p>

RecordID INT NOT NULL  
StartDate DATE NOT NULL  
EndDate DATE NULL  
</code></pre>

<p>And I am trying to work out the start and end dates for each record id, so the minimum StartDate and maximum EndDate. StartDate is not nullable so I dont need to worry about this but I need the MAX(EndDate) to signify that this is currently a running timespan.</p>

<p>It is important that I maintain the NULL value of the EndDate and treat this as the maximum value.</p>

<p>The most simple attempt (below) doesn't work highlighing the problem that MIN and MAX will ignore NULLS (source: <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms179916.aspx"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms179916.aspx</a>).</p>

Special thing is, that don't want to use 30 days for every  month and 360 days for a year. I rather want the difference in ""human format"" (don't know how to call it).</p>

<p>Let's say, I want to calculate difference (including the last day) from October 1 (2014) until March 17, 2015. From October to February this would make 5 months. And then the rest would be 18 days (from day 1 to 17, including 17th day). So the result should be :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0 years, 5 months, 18 days</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sort of calculation of course ignores that some months have 31, 30, 28 or 29 days (except for the day calculation, when dates are in such a form: start date: October 17th, 2014; end date: Januar 12th, 2015).</p>

<p>Unfortunately I didn't found any JS lib that already implements this sort of calculation. Moments.js, doesn't seem to have any methods for this.</p>

<p>So I started creating my own code but I'm still always off some days (2-3 days) from the expected result. And to be honest, if I look at my code I have the feeling that it sucks and there must be a more intelligent and elegant way to calculate this (in my example I'm outputting it to a span):</p>

I have added my code below which I'm not even sure the complexity of. I am curious to see what the <code>O(N)</code> or <code>O(K)</code> solution would be. If someone could help out with this it would be appreciated greatly.</p>

<pre><code>Time Limit: 1 second
</code></pre>

<p>There are K seats available, each represented by a physical seat at a point around a circle. The K+1 people are also initially standing at points around the circle. Points on the circle are labelled clockwise from 1 to N, such that point 1 immediately follows point N. No two people will be initially standing at the same point, and no two chairs will be at the same point. </p>

<p>Each second, all the people who are still standing do the following (simultaneously):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>If the person is standing at the same point as an empty chair, the person will sit down in it.  </p></li>
  <li><p>Otherwise, the person will step one place clockwise around the circle to the next point. If the person was previously at point i (with i &lt; N), the person will now be at point i+1. If the person was previously at point N, the person will now be at point 1. </p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Since there are K+1 people, eventually all K seats will be taken and the one person remaining without a seat. The person sitting in the first seat in the circle will have the best place. (The ‘first’  seat in the circle is defined as the first seat clockwise from point 1.)</p>

<p>Your task is to determine who will be in the first seat and who will be the person left standing up.</p>

<p>Input 
N and K.<br>
K space-separated integers representing the points at which there are chairs, in increasing order. Hence, the first chair in this list will be the first seat<br>
K+1 space-separated integers representing the points of people, in increasing order. The people are numbered from 1 to K+1 by their position in this list.</p>

<p>1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000<br>
1 ≤ K ≤ 100000</p>

<p>Output<br>
Person in the first seat<br>
Person left standing    </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/XjqCPuL.png"" alt=""initial config""></p>

<p>In the first second, the fourth person (at point 8) will immediately sit down on the chair beneath them. The other three people will move one place around the circle. In the next second, the second person (now in position 5) will sit down on the second seat. The first and third people will continue walking around the circle until the third person reaches position 2 and sits down, leaving the first person with no chair to sit in. </p>

<pre><code>while(standing != 1)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; K + 1; i++)
    {

                standing--;

<p>What I would like to do is to asynchronously delay an action, and <code>await(int millis)</code> and I seem to be able to become friends.</p>

<p>Here's what happens:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <code>Application.index</code> displays a form that sends a POST to <code>Application.something</code>.</p>

<p><strong>app/controllers/Application.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>app/views/Application/index.html</strong></p>

<pre><code>#{form @Application.something()}
    &lt;input type=""submit""&gt;
#{/form}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>2.</strong> <code>Application.something</code> does its thing and then chains back to <code>index</code>.</p>

<p><strong>app/controllers/Application.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>public static void something() {
    await(500);

    // Here be business

    index();
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Play raises an application error: <em>""The template Application/something.html does not exist""</em>.</p>

<p>So when <code>render()</code> is called in <code>Application.index</code> after execution in <code>Application.something</code> has been suspended/resumed it tries to render the template of <code>Application.something</code>, which of course doesn't exist.</p>

<p>If I remove <code>await(500)</code> everything works just fine (the 302 is issued and <code>index</code> is rendered as expected).</p>

<p>I can force a redirect with</p>

<pre><code>redirect(""/"");
</code></pre>

<p>and get the result I want, but this feels ugly.</p>

<p>I can also set</p>

<pre><code>request.action = ""Application.index"";
</code></pre>

<p>manually right after the <code>await</code> and the render in <code>Application.index</code> works (actually, the magic in <code>Controller.template()</code> works) as intended.</p>

<hr>

<p>So basically, is everything OK and I'm forced to live with using strings after <code>await</code> rather than method calls, or is something a bit off?</p>

<p>Cheers,
Tobias.</p>

<p>Now, using RSpec I want to test/spec <code>AssemblyLine</code> without exercising <code>Car</code> as well. I hear we don't do dependency injection in Ruby, we stub <code>new</code> instead:</p>

<p>The problem, as you can see, is with <code>the_new_instance_of_car</code>. It doesn't exist yet before <code>produce</code> is called, and after <code>produce</code> returns it's too late to set any method call expectations on it.</p>

<p>I can think of a workaround involving a callback in the stubbed <code>new</code> method, but that's rather hideous. There must be a more elegant and idiomatic way to solve this seemingly common problem. Right...?</p>

<pre><code>public function get_edit($id){
   return View::make('authors.edit')-&gt;with('title', 'Edit Author')-&gt;with('author', Author::find($id));
}

public function put_update(){
    $id = Input::get('id');
    $author = array(
            'name' =&gt; Input::get('name'),
            'bio'  =&gt; Input::get('bio'),

<p>On my browser the get_edit function runs ok at first, but then, when i click the submit button and it's supposed to execute put_update, whether it's supposed to redirect me to view_author or back to edit_author, it just gives me a NoFoundHttpException.</p>

<p>Just as additional information, i use the default .htacces which is this one:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Start Loop</code> - starts runloop in some mode (see code below);</li>
<li><code>Stop Loop</code> - change <code>self.stop</code> flag to stop runloop.</li>
</ol>

<p>`</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)stopLoop:(id)sender
{
    self.stop = YES;

<p>`</p>

<p>where: <br />
1. <code>runLoopMode</code> is one of the predefined modes (I try each, default, event tracking, modal, connection). <br />
2. <code>runLoopLimitDate</code> [NSDate distantFuture], or [NSDate distantPast], or close feature. <br />
3. <code>self.stop</code> flag is installed in other method, which called by button. <br /><br />
That's all, my App hasn't any other code.</p>

<p>AFAIU, runloop mode is a set of event sources. So, if I run runloop in some mode, runloop will be proceed those event sources, whose are associated with this mode.<br />
By default Cocoa runs runloop in default mode and all events are proceeds greatly. But when user press <code>startLoop</code> button, my App is freezing: <br /><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/H7Nrf.png"" alt=""freezed app"">. <br />
<code>startLoop</code> method is never break this infinity cycle. Application doesn't send any event to me, therefore UI freezing and user can't press <code>stopLoop</code> button. The same problem if I run Core Foundation counterparts.<br /><br />
<strong>But</strong>, when I try to receive events through NSApplication (of NSWindow) method  <code>nextEventMatchingMask:untilDate:inMode:dequeue:</code> and pass the <strong>same</strong> mode, I receive UI events. <br /><br /></p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)startLoop:(id)sender

I am trying to learn the language by going through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler"" rel=""nofollow"">Project Euler</a> and I don't understand what is going on under the hood: The following code is designed to use return a list of all prime numbers up to <code>lim</code>. I would think that it should be O(n) in heap-space because I make a list of all the numbers up to <code>lim</code>, and then filter them away one by one while moving the first to a new list. (I know that I am actually making new lists each recur but I didn't think they would take more memory?) Anyway I am running this with</p>

<pre><code>(defn getAllPrimes [lim] 
  (defn getPrimes [primes numlist]
    (if (not-empty numlist) ;base case;
    (recur (cons (first numlist) primes) ;put the prime on to the prime list 
           (filter
        (fn [x] (not (div? x (first numlist)))) ;remove the prime and all its multiples from the numlist
        (rest numlist)))
      primes)); return the primes
  (getPrimes () (range 2 lim))) ;call the recursive function with and empty prime list to be filled up and a full numlist to be emptied
</code></pre>

<p>And I keep running out of heap space, when I call</p>

<pre><code>(apply + (getAllPrimes 2000000))

<p>, but I don't run out of space on </p>

<pre><code>(apply + (filter even? (range 2000000)))

I created a public delegate sub and a public event for the delegate. I also created the sub that does the logic for the even on the WPF UI. The issue I am having is that when running the app and I am inside the actual sub on the WPF control, the event that gets called from the sub is null. I check for it at runtime like the coding standards say I should, keeping threads clean.., by throwing it into a local variable, but the issue is the sub never gets registered, its null. I wrote the WPF Control in C#, easier w/WPF (3.5), and the form where the control is embedded is in VB (3.5). Is that why they can't see each other? Please help me... I am stuck.</p>

<pre><code>public delegate void MyCheckHandler(object sender, MovieEventArgs args);
public event MyCheckHandler chkSelect_Check;


private void chkSelect_Checked(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            string lsUrl;

                temp(this, retvals);

        }

<p>On the VB form I try to reference the event from WPF by:</p>

<pre><code>myControl = New TheMovieDBTestApp.MovieControl
            myControl.InitializeComponent()
            AddHandler myControl.chkSelect_Check, AddressOf Check

End Sub

<p>I still don't full comprehend list comprehension for more advanced cases, however I'm thinking the following clearly incorrect code would convey my intentions:</p>

<p><em>UPDATE</em></p>

<p>Sorry I don't think I've conveyed this particularly well, I need to add each additional list's unique items as part of a loop, hence why each needs to individually pass through <code>append_unique()</code></p>

<p>I attempted to modify <code>append_unique()</code> to use <code>set()</code> as per the following:</p>

But all those file copies transfer via the C# Windows App that is actually doing the file copying. This takes 20 minutes per job. Any good ideas on how to dispatch a set of copy instructions to the SAN via C# but not have the local box be involved in the transfer?</p>

<p>I am using a helper class(<code>Observer.cs</code>) which monitors some properties from an other class (<code>MonitoredClass.cs</code>). When a property changes, the observer class writes the changed value into a other data class (<code>DataClass.cs</code>).</p>

<p>simplified code snipped:</p>

<p>MonitoredClass.cs:</p>

<pre><code>public class MonitoredClass : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
   // simplified: in fact property calls OnPropertyChange(..)
   public string Property1 { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>DataClass.cs:</p>

<pre><code>public class DataClass
{
   public string LastProperty1Value { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Observer.cs:</p>

<pre><code>public class Observer
{
   private MonitoredClass _monitoredClass;
   private DataClass _dataClass;
   public Observer(MonitoredClass monitoredClass, DataClass dataClass)
   {
      _monitoredClass = monitoredClass;
      _dataClass = dataClass;
      _monitoredClass.PropertyChanged+=MonitoredClassPropertyChanged;

   private void MonitoredClassPropertyChanged(..)

<p>So far so good. </p>

<p>If I use now my Observer class from above as follows:</p>

<pre><code>...
new Observer(monitoredClassInstance, dataClassInstance);
...
</code></pre>

<p>than I get a resharper warning ""possible unassigned object created by 'new' expression"". </p>

<p>My question now is, if there is a better solution/pattern to design this observer.
Of coarse, i can allocate the new observer instance to a private field. But than I have a field which is never used. 
Or I can set the monitoredClassInstance and dataClassInstance with properties instead of pass them in the constructor. But this only prevents the warning, but in fact does not change the architecture.</p>

<pre><code>public void someMethod(java.util.Enumeration e) {

<p>I've tried the following code for calling the method:</p>

<pre><code>target.someMethod(new java.util.Enumeration[String] {

  def nextElement = throw new NoSuchElementException()

<p>However, this results in a compiler error:</p>

required: java.util.Enumeration[?0] where type ?0

<p>I've found plenty of examples for dealing with the case where a Java method returns a non-generic value and you need to handle it with a generic type in Scala. I can't find anything that covers this reverse case where we need to pass a non-generic type instead. Is this possible?</p>

<p><strong>More Information</strong>
I created an implementation in Java and called it from Scala and it works just fine. The problem only manifests itself when trying to mock the Java method using mockito:</p>

<pre><code>   (java.util.Enumeration[?0],&lt;repeated...&gt;[java.util.Enumeration[?0]])org.mockito.stubbing.OngoingStubbing[java.util.Enumeration[?0]] &lt;and&gt;
   (java.util.Enumeration[?0])org.mockito.stubbing.OngoingStubbing[java.util.Enumeration[?0]]
 cannot be applied to (java.lang.Object with java.util.Enumeration[String]{def nextElement(): Nothing})
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>
Managed to solve this with some hints from the Odersky book and some hacking with mockito internals. The solution is to build a small function that captures the ?0 type and apply it to the mockito code via a cast:</p>

<pre><code>def thenReturn[T](target: OngoingStubbing[T], result: Any) = 
  target.thenReturn(result.asInstanceOf[T])

thenReturn(when(myMock.someMethod), myEnumeration)

The user will sometimes need to group certain objects together into containers, so some of the <code>ObjectState</code>'s are placed into an array of <code>ObjectState</code>'s and passed to a <code>ContainerState</code> (just a serializable class that holds an array of generic types serializables).</p>

<p>My question is, how do I de-serialize the <code>ContianerState</code> and keep type integrity? I thought I could try something like:</p>

<pre><code>public static ContainerState&lt;V&gt; inflateState(V v, Serializable state) throws ClassCastException {
    return (ContainerState&lt;V&gt;)state;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that won't even get past Eclipses' warning system. I also tried <code>V.class</code> to the same result. Is it even possible for me to achieve this?</p>

<p>EDIT 1:</p>

<p>I tried this, it seems to work, but I'm not sure if it's the best way. Any thoughts?</p>

I am trying to get the authenticated User on my ApiController's constructor (I am using AutoFac to inject my dependencies), but the User shows as not authenticated when the constructor is called.</p>

<p>I am trying to get the User so I can generate Audit information for any DB write-operations.</p>

<p>A few things I'm doing that can help on the diagnosis:
<br>I am using <strong>only</strong> <code>app.UseOAuthBearerTokens</code> as authentication with Asp.Net Identity 2. This means that I removed the <code>app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions())</code> that comes enabled by default when you are creating a new Web Api 2.1 project with Asp.Net Identity 2.</p>

<p>Inside <code>WebApiConfig</code> I'm injecting my repository:</p>

<pre><code>builder.RegisterType&lt;ValueRepository&gt;().As&lt;IValueRepository&gt;().InstancePerRequest();
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my controller:</p>

<pre><code>[RoutePrefix(""api/values"")]
public class ValuesController : ApiController
{
    private IValueRepository valueRepository;

    public ValuesController(IValueRepository repo)
    {
        valueRepository = repo;
        // I would need the User information here to pass it to my repository
        // something like this:
        valueRepository.SetUser(User);
    }

    protected override void Initialize(System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerContext controllerContext)
    {
        base.Initialize(controllerContext);

        // User is not avaliable here either...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But if I inspect the User object on the constructor, this is what I get:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qOcmZ.png"" alt=""User""></p>

<p>The authentication is working, if I don't pass my token, it will respond with <code>Unauthorized</code>. If I pass the token and I try to access the user from any of the methods, it is authenticated and populated correctly. It just doesn't show up on the constructor when it is called.</p>

<p>In my <code>WebApiConfig</code> I am using:</p>

<pre><code>public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
{
    config.SuppressDefaultHostAuthentication();
    config.Filters.Add(new HostAuthenticationFilter(OAuthDefaults.AuthenticationType));

    // Web API routes
    config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();

    config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
        name: ""DefaultApi"",
        routeTemplate: ""api/{controller}/{id}"",
        defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
    );

     // ... other unrelated injections using AutoFac
 } 
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that if I remove this line: <code>config.SuppressDefaultHostAuthentication()</code> the User is populated on the constructor.</p>

<p>Is this expected? How can I get the authenticated user on the constructor? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
As Rikard suggested I tried to get the user in the Initialize method, but it is still not avaliable, giving me the same thing described in the image.</p>

<p>When trying to use an NSExpression to take the square root of a nested NSExpression which is using the ""multiply:by:"" function.</p>

<p>My code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSManagedObjectContext *context=[[BDCoreDataController sharedController] mainManagedObjectContext];

</code></pre>

<p>Executing the fetch with just trying to evaluate the nested ""multiply:by:"" works fine with this code: </p>

<pre><code>NSManagedObjectContext *context=[[BDCoreDataController sharedController] mainManagedObjectContext];
NSFetchRequest *theRequest=[[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];

[theRequest setEntity:[NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""BDCompanyEntity"" inManagedObjectContext:context]];

NSExpression *secondKeyPath=[NSExpression expressionForKeyPath:@""bookValuePerShare""];

NSExpression *secondMultiplyExpression=[NSExpression expressionForFunction:@""multiply:by:"" arguments:@[firstMultiplyExpression,constantExpression]];

NSError *fetchError;
NSArray *grahams=[context executeFetchRequest:theRequest error:&amp;fetchError];
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought that perhaps the ""sqrt"" NSExpression was having trouble with the nested NSExpression.  So I tried just a constant NSExpression.  The following code tries to just take evaluate a constant in the sqrt NSExpression.  It causes the same NSInvalidArguementException</p>

<pre><code>NSManagedObjectContext *context=[[BDCoreDataController sharedController] mainManagedObjectContext];
NSFetchRequest *theRequest=[[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];

NSExpression *sqrtExpression=[NSExpression expressionForFunction:@""sqrt:"" arguments:@[constantExpression]];

NSExpressionDescription *expressionDescription=[[NSExpressionDescription alloc] init];
[expressionDescription setName:@""grahamNumber""];
[expressionDescription setExpression:sqrtExpression];

That worked fine on some phones but was not working on some HTC phones. I searched online and some one suggested that upgrading to zxing 2.0 should solve the problem. So, I downloaded the zxing-2.0 and followed the following steps:
1. Unzipped the zxing-2.0 and built the core package.
2. Added the android package to eclipse as an Android Project and selected it as library( named zxing-2 ).
3. Added core.jar as an external jar to the zxing-2 which made it build successfully on eclipse.
4. Added the zxing-2 as project dependency of my main app(myApp). Also added core.jar as an external jar in myApp.</p>

<p>MyApp's mainfest.xml now contains( earlier it contained the action name as com.phonegap.plugins.barcodescanner.SCAN):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:name=""com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity""

        &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am using the BarcodeScanner.java provided in phone gap plugin to invoke the barcode scanner. I changed the scan() method in it to:</p>

<pre><code>//new version
public void scan() {
    Intent intentScan = new Intent(""com.google.zxing.client.android.SCAN"");
    intentScan.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT);

    this.ctx.startActivityForResult((Plugin) this, intentScan, REQUEST_CODE);
}

//earlier version(it worked with zxing 1.7)
public void scan() {
    Intent intentScan = new Intent(""com.phonegap.plugins.barcodescanner.SCAN"");
    intentScan.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT);

    this.ctx.startActivityForResult((Plugin) this, intentScan, REQUEST_CODE);
}

I have made the data flow tasks for all the dimensions in these data marts. It was clear and easy to follow from msdn and other articles. 
Now I want to create the data flow task for the fact tables of these data marts.
For e.g. 
I have a customer table in my source system. Its attributes are CustomerID, name, age, dateJoined, etc. I have made a dimension for it having attributes Customer_Key, CustomerID, name, age, dateJoined, etc. And joined these in data flow task with arrow pointing from source to destination and I have assigned the mappings. Now I am facing problem in creating the fact tables? 
For fact table the created dimensions will be source, but I don't know how to send the keys of dimensions to fact tables i.e. in this case how to send Customer_Key as a foreign key to the table SalesFactTable?</p>

<p>EDIT: How do I make the data flow task for sales fact table using the lookup data flow task?</p>

<pre><code>Customer: cid, cname, age, customersince, level
Store: sid, sname, area, city, country
Product: pid, pname, category, amount

CustomerDimension: customer_key, cid, cname, age, customersince, level
StoreDimension: store_key, sid, sname, area, city, country
ProductDimension: product_key, pid, pname, category
TimeDimension: tid, week, month, year

SalesFactTable: customer_key, store_key, product_key, tid, aggregate_of_amount

<p>I need help how to make a sample data flow task for fact table when I have created the data flow tasks for dimensions?</p>

It requires that I perform the same set of steps on two sets of data derived from results of querying two different tables. Is it possible to write a function that generalizes these steps?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE foos (
  id bigserial primary key,
  name text not null
);

INSERT INTO foos (name) VALUES ('FOO_ONE');
INSERT INTO foos (name) VALUES ('FOO_TWO');
INSERT INTO foos (name) VALUES ('FOO_THREE');
INSERT INTO foos (name) VALUES ('FOO_FOUR');

CREATE TABLE bars (
  id bigserial primary key,
  name text not null
);

INSERT INTO bars (name) VALUES ('BAR_ONE');
INSERT INTO bars (name) VALUES ('BAR_TWO');
INSERT INTO bars (name) VALUES ('BAR_THREE');
INSERT INTO bars (name) VALUES ('BAR_FOUR');
</code></pre>

<p>Now I must compute:</p>

<pre><code>WITH even_foos AS (SELECT * FROM foos WHERE id % 2 = 0)
SELECT id * 2 AS double_id, name FROM even_foos;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>WITH odd_bars AS (SELECT * FROM foos WHERE id % 2 = 1)
SELECT id * 2 AS double_id, name FROM odd_bars;
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the <code>id * 2</code> select is repeated in both queries. I would like to reuse this functionality so that I only have to implement this logic once. For example (made up syntax):</p>

<pre><code>WITH even_foos AS (SELECT * FROM foos WHERE id % 2 = 0)
SELECT * FROM get_double_id_and_name(even_foos);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>WITH odd_bars AS (SELECT * FROM foos WHERE id % 2 = 1)
SELECT * FROM get_double_id_and_name(odd_bars);
</code></pre>

The video camera SDK is written in C, so I have been using .dll's to communicate from Matlab to the camera (I am a self-taught programmer, so I apologize if my terminology is off). For the live view however, I fear that while Matlab is reading the data from the camera buffer, the camera won't be aware that the data is being read by Matlab, and continue to blindly update the buffer. Therefore, I am thinking a handshake mechanism is required, and this is where my trouble comes in.</p>

<p>Below is the pseudo-code that outlines my current solution. My question is in regard to 
the statement inside the two while() loops. How do I actually go about checking the status of the booleans I'm using?. The possibilities I can think of require messy passing of arguments to and from multiple functions. Is there a cleaner way?</p>

<pre><code>//C-code
initCamera();
dataReadyForSend = false;
grabFrame();
dataReadyForSend = true;
while(dataReceivedByMatlab == false)
    { // Check status};
//repeat
</code></pre>

<p>And now for the Matlab side:</p>

<pre><code>% Matlab-code
dataReceieved = false;
while(waitForReadySignal() == false)
    { %Check status}
readDataFromC();
dataRecieved == true;
sendMessageOfSuccess(); %Tell C ""I got the data""

<p>My problem is I, in short, I can't add items to the action bar! The compiler doesn't know what 'Item' is in the XML and I can't work out why (this is what I can tell, I may be wrong). All the tutorials I've followed tell me the action bar is included in the theme 'Holo' in API version 11 or later, which I've used for my application.</p>

<p>If you need some more info, please ask me for it.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks in advance!</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: Also, I've included 'android-support-v4.jar' as a library in my application following the official Android Dev. Tutorial for action bars, although, other sites don't tell me to do this.</p>

<pre><code>Solution
    Website
    Module1
    Module2
</code></pre>

<p>On disk the root directories of the projects are like this:</p>

<pre><code>Website
    Module1
    Module2
</code></pre>

<p>When I let MSBUILD handle it with the target set like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Target Name=""BuildAll""&gt;
    &lt;Delete Files=""$(OutputDir)\$(ProjectName)\*.*"" /&gt;
    &lt;MSBuild Projects=""$(BuildDir)\$(ProjectName).sln"" Properties=""OutputPath=$(OutputDir)\$(ProductName);Configuration=$(BuildMode);Platform=$(BuildPlatform)"" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The output will be put in a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code> Builds
     website
         _PublishedWebsites
             Website
             Module1
             Module2
</code></pre>

<p>As one can imagine this is not the desired output as it does not resemble the actual structure on disk. Can anyone tell me what would be the best practice to solve this issue? Should we move the files afterwards or is there a way to change the build output to resemble the structure as described?</p>

<p>Update:-</p>

<p>thanks to @fatelerror. i have change my code as</p>

<pre><code>    char** split(char *phrase, char *delimiter) {
    int i = 0;
    char **arraylist = malloc(10 *sizeof(char *));

<p>In the caller function, i used it as </p>

In the BroadcastReceiver, I have it waiting for a text message to come in and then grab the data and send it off to the front facing UI activity and update the message on the UI to the data that was send from the BroadcastReceiver. So Essentially, if a text came in from ""1234567890"" with a message text of ""hello"", the BroadcastReceiver would grab both that data and send it off to the Activity and then the Activity receives it and updates the message TextView to ""From: 1234567890, Msg: hello"".

The thing is that the web application I am testing is locked for 15 minutest if the user illegally logged out, which makes the rest of the whole sequential tests fall to fake fails; it works fine but gives fail because it cannot login.

<p>I am pretty new to IOS development and have started reading books to help me out.  I only started recently and the books all start you on a windows based application and I see that this does not exist in xcode 4.2.  I have read and found that the way to go is to create an empty project but this does not create a .xib file and I have no idea what I'm doing so it might not seem like a big deal to an experienced IOS developer but this was a huge curve ball for me.  Also there is a bunch more code in the .h and .m file that wasn't there before.  Can someone tell me why this was taken out and maybe sort of guide me to what I should do or what I should start reading.  I know that this may seem like a question that could be solved with a bit more research but the problem is not as much that the windows based app is not there anymore but why is it not there.  Maybe I shouldn't even try and create one anymore?  I have even read posts where they say how to add the .xib file but that didn't really help because when i built my app, it was a blank screen.  Anyways, that's a different problem.</p>

    This is killing me.I have done everything but not right as its not still giving me this error
<code>Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'CFCredentials_Exception' with message 'No credentials were provided</code>. I am trying to upload files to S3 using AWS sdk 1.6 example and jquery file upload plugin.I found an example on the <a href=""https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki</a>.
  <br/>
This is my file where I set the credentials <code>awssdk.php</code> from the wiki example</p>

<pre><code>  require_once 'sdk.class.php';
  require_once 'utilities.class.php';
  require_once 'credential.class.php';
  if (!class_exists('CFCredentials'))require_once('credentials.class.php');
  $name=null;
  CFCredentials::set(array(
    $name =&gt; array(
            'key' =&gt; 'access key',
            'secret' =&gt; 'secret key',
            'certificate_authority' =&gt; false
    ),
    '@default' =&gt; $name
    ));
  if (!class_exists('S3'))require_once('S3.php');
   $s3 = new AmazonS3();   
</code></pre>

<p>I am quite sure I should't need so many files but as the errors suggested I had to add the dependency classes.But still I get the above error. I also tried to include the <code>config.class.php</code>  file for credentials and still got this error.<br/>I have been spending a lot of time on this and now kind of frustrated with this AWS sdk.<br/>
I am a bit new to OO PHP and probably hence finding it difficult.Experts please suggest  some solution to where I am wrong.<br/></p>

The reason I don't want to exclude all the folders and code is because I still want the autocomplete and other DTD functionality to work. </p>

<p>I noticed a option in the HTML Syntax settings, ""Ignore specified element names in validation"" and ""Ignore specified attribute names in validation"".</p>

<p>To start I was trying to get rid of the error:</p>

<pre><code>Start tag (&lt;video&gt;) not closed properly, expected '&gt;'

<p>So I got into the settings by right clicking on my Project in the PHP Explorer and select Properties. Check the ""Enable project specific settings"" and enabled ""Ignore specified element names in validation"". Then in the Text Box I entered ""video"".</p>

<p>When I hit ""OK"" I get the dialog that validation settings have been changed and do I want to validate the project and I select ""Yes"". But nothing seems to change. Am I doing something wrong here? Am I misreading how this ""should"" work? Or is there a better way about going about this?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a byte array (called BA) within a for loop which keeps over-writting itself and there is no way for my to be able print it as a whole array. Is there a way to export it outside the for loop (maybe with a different name) so i can use it later on in the program? i just want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] BA2 = {3 187,3 203,111 32, ...etc}; //(groups of 2bytes separated by commas).
</code></pre>

<p>From the original</p>

<pre><code>string hexValues = ""03 BB,03 CB,6F 20,57 6F,72 6C,64 21"";
</code></pre>

<p>(and also to represent this information in bits (boolean) so {00000011 10111011,00000011 11001011, ...etc})</p></li>
<li><p>The second thing i must do is to shift these two bytes by 4 and apply and AND gate with FFF0 (which is the same as multiplying the first byte * 1, and the second by 0xF0). Then put this in a ushort[ ] (unsigned short array) which holds the transformed bytes in binary format and then from there convert it back to HEX.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I understand that this might be unclear (my code is kind of messy), and pretty complex. but i was hoping some of you c# guru's could lend me hand.</p>

<p>Here's my code so far, i have put in comments the bits that don't work so the code runs. but i desperatly need to fix them.</p>

<pre><code>class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {

        string hexValues = ""03 BB,03 CB,6F 20,57 6F,72 6C,64 21"";
        string[] hex2byte = hexValues.Split(',');

        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 6; j++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""\n2 byte String is: ""+ hex2byte[j]);
            string[] hex1byte = hex2byte[j].Split(' ');

            for (int k = 0; k &lt; 2; k++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(""byte "" + hex1byte[k]);
                byte[] BA = StringToByteArray((hex1byte[k]));

                //bool[] AA = BitConverter.ToBoolean(BA);           // I'm essentially stuck here. I need somehting which actually works.

                //for (int i2 = 0; i2 &lt; 2; i2++);                   // This is my attemp to perform de shift and AND.
                //{
                //    ushort[] X = new ushort[1];
                //    X[0] = (ushort)((ushort)(BA[0] &lt;&lt; 4) + (ushort)((BA[1] &amp; 0xF0) &gt;&gt; 4));        // They have to be in this order: ((1stByte &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 4) + ((2byte &amp; 0xF0) &gt;&gt; 4); first to the left then the right.

                //}

                Console.WriteLine(""Converted "" + BA[0]);
            }
        }
        //Console.WriteLine(BA[4]);               // it says: Does not exist in current context. Can it only b accesed in the for loop?

        {

Is there a notable difference between them?</p>

<p>Context:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web development</li>
<li>Using js and/or jQuery</li>
<li>up to hundreds of items affected on a page</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a sample of the object I would retrieve information from:</p>

<pre><code>var pModel = {
    1 : {sire: 3, dam: 4, herdList: settings.sireList},
    2 : {sire: 5, dam: 6, herdList: settings.damList},
    3 : {sire: 7, dam: 8, herdList: settings.sireList},
    4 : {sire: 9, dam: 10, herdList: settings.damList},
    5 : {sire: 11, dam: 12, herdList: settings.sireList},
    6 : {sire: 13, dam: 14, herdList: settings.damList}
};
</code></pre>

<p>After I wrote the code, I noticed the mathematical pattern inherent in the data:</p>

<pre><code>// Where x is a number
pModel[x].sire == 2x+1;
pModel[x].dam == 2x+2;
(x%2=0) ? settings.damList : settings.sireList;
</code></pre>

<p>There are obvious future proofing advantages to using math, but speed is a major consideration here.</p>

<p>And this is the function to generate the simulated model:</p>

<pre><code>probit.data &lt;- function(N=100,a=1,b=1) {
x &lt;- rnorm(N)
y.star &lt;- a + b*x + rnorm(N)
y &lt;- (y.star &gt; 0)
return( as.data.frame(cbind(y,x,y.star)) )
}
</code></pre>

<p>This simulates an n size equal 100:</p>

<pre><code>probit.data100 &lt;- function(N=100,a=2,b=1) {
x &lt;- rnorm(N)
y.star &lt;- a + b*x + rnorm(N)
y &lt;- (y.star &gt; 0)
return( as.data.frame(cbind(y,x,y.star)) )
}

#predicted value
se.probit.phat100 &lt;- function(x, par, V) {
z &lt;- par[1] + par[2] * x
# Derivative of q w.r.t. alpha and beta 
J &lt;- c( dnorm(z), dnorm(z)*par[2] )
return( sqrt(t(J) %*% V %*% J)  )
}

dat100 &lt;- probit.data100()
res100 &lt;- my.probit(dat100$y,dat100$x)
res100
</code></pre>

<p>This function below will calculate the confidence intervals based on a non-parametric bootstrap approach (notice the sample function being used):</p>

<pre><code>N &lt;- dim(probit.data(N=100, a=1, b=1))[1]
npb.par &lt;- matrix(NA,100,2)
colnames(npb.par) &lt;- c(""alpha"",""beta"")
npb.eystar &lt;- matrix(NA,100,N)
for (t in 1:100) {
thisdta &lt;- probit.data(N=100, a=1, b=1)[sample(1:N,N,replace=TRUE),]
npb.par[t,] &lt;- my.probit(thisdta$y,thisdta$x)$par
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function below just cleans up the bootstrap output, and the confidence intervals are what I would like to plot:</p>

<pre><code>processres &lt;- function(simres) {
z &lt;- t(apply(simres,2,function(x) { c(mean(x),median(x),sd(x),quantile(x,c(0.05,0.95)))     } ))
rownames(z) &lt;- colnames(simres)
colnames(z) &lt;- c(""mean"",""median"",""sd"",""5%"",""95%"")
z
}

processres(npb.par)
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to plot a graph like this (the one below), but add confidence intervals based on the processres function above.  How can these confidence intervals be added to the plot?</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- seq(-5,5,length=100)
plot(x, pnorm(1 - 0.5*x), ty='l', lwd=2, bty='n', xlab='x', ylab=""Pr(y=1)"")
rug(dat100$x)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm also open to a different plot code and/or package.  I just want a graph based on this simulation with added confidence intervals.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I have a page on a website and within that page, I have a button. When you click on it, I want it to (via AJAX so the page doesn't refresh)</p>

<ul>
<li>Send data (time capture) to the DB</li>
<li>See that the DB recorded the change and in turn return a different value back to the site</li>
<li>This would in turn change the button, noting that it is in a recording mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of it in this way, the button is a timer. On click, it records the time in the DB, and in the DB it also changes the state to recording. Since it is in the recording phase, somehow it gets sent back to the website page and changes the button showing that it is recording. Naturally clicking again would stop it and record the time in the DB.</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't override autocomplete input value with my custom text - I've tried to do it within ""blur"", ""focus"", ""place_changed"" events - still no luck. Please find an example of what I was trying. Also - I need to avoid text flashing, to make it absolutely user-friendly. Could someone help me with my attempts?</p>

The relevant part is that I have to map 2^20 userspace virtual pages (integer address values) into a table corresponding to the number of physical ram frames available, which on my system will be anywhere from 80 available frames to around 16 384. </p>

<p>So, my hash function will need to be able to map 1,048,576 possible entries to 80 up to 130,000 spots. My system might be configured with different amounts of ram, so it's fair to assume I always know whether my hash table is size 80, 8000, or 16384. I can choose a different algorithm for each case if need be. </p>

<p>At first I was thinking of using quadratic probing, because I remember hearing about it being good at reducing clustering from my algorithms class. Then I realized that I don't really care too much about clustering in my page table (why would I?), and that quadratic hashing has this nasty property that there's no guarantee of finding an empty cell once the table is more than half full! This would be terrible an essentially half my system ram. </p>

<p>Linear probing would work I guess. Here's a code snippet: </p>

int j = -1; 
lock_acquire(BitMapLock);
while (j &lt; BitMapSize) {

      _try = (_try + j) % BitMapSize; 
      if (PageTable[_try] == 0) { //take it!
        PageTable[_try] = 1;
        lock_release(BitMapLock);
        return _try;
  }
}
return -1; //couldn't do it

<p>But the coding isn't the concern, just wanted to add some context. It's more what algorithms should I consider, what are their pros and cons, and should I pick different algorithms for different table sizes. </p>

Then use this list to create a list of dictionaries (specifying the client, some task_values, and date) for each object in the task list. I have a model that looks like this:  </p>

<pre><code>class Client(models.Model):

of a certain type, for instance</p>

<pre><code>struct DATA_TYPE1{
   std::string data_string;
};
</code></pre>

<p>then this struct has to be casted into a general datatype,
i thought about void * or char *, because the ""intermediate""
object that copies and stores it in its binary tree should
be able to store many different types of such struct data.</p>

<pre><code>struct BINARY_TREE_ENTRY{
   void * DATA;
   struct BINARY_TREE_ENTRY * next;
};
</code></pre>

<p>this void * is then later taken by another object
that casts the void * back into the (struct DATA_TYPE1 *)
to get the original data. so the sender and the receiver
know about the datatype DATA_TYPE1 but not the copying
object inbetween.</p>

<p>but how can the intermidiate object deep copy the contents of
the different structs, when it doesn't know the datatype,
only void * and it has no method to copy the real contents;
dynamic_cast doesn't work for void *;</p>

<p>the ""intermediate"" object should do something like:</p>

<pre><code>void store_data(void * CASTED_DATA_STRUCT){
   void * DATA_COPY = create_a_deepcopy_of(CASTED_DATA_STRUCT);
   push_into_bintree(DATA_COPY);
}
</code></pre>

<p>a simple solution would be that the sending object doesn't
delete the sent data struct, til the receiving object got it,
but the sending objects are dynamically created and deleted,
before the receiver got the data from the intermediate object,
for asynchronous communication, therefore i want to copy
it.</p>

<p>instead of converting it to void * i also tried converting
to a superclass pointer of which the intermediate copying
object knows about, and which is inherited by all the different
datatypes of the structs:</p>

<pre><code>struct DATA_BASE_OBJECT{
public:
    DATA_BASE_OBJECT(){}
DATA_BASE_OBJECT(DATA_BASE_OBJECT * old_ptr){
         std::cout &lt;&lt; ""this should be automatically overridden!"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
    virtual ~DATA_BASE_OBJECT(){}
};

struct DATA_TYPE1 : public DATA_BASE_OBJECT {
public:
    string str;
    DATA_TYPE1(){}
    ~DATA_TYPE1(){}
    DATA_TYPE1(DATA_TYPE1 * old_ptr){
         str = old_ptr-&gt;str;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>and the corresponding binary tree entry would then be:</p>

<pre><code>struct BINARY_TREE_ENTRY{
       struct DATA_BASE_OBJECT * DATA;
       struct BINARY_TREE_ENTRY * next;
    };
</code></pre>

<p>and to then copy the unknown datatype, i tried in the class
that just gets the unknown datatype as a struct DATA_BASE_OBJECT *
(before it was the void *):</p>

<pre><code>void * copy_data(DATA_BASE_OBJECT * data_that_i_get_in_the_sub_struct){
     struct DATA_BASE_OBJECT * copy_sub = new DATA_BASE_OBJECT(data_that_i_get_in_the_sub_struct);
     push_into_bintree(copy_sub);
}
</code></pre>

<p>i then added a copy constructor to the DATA_BASE_OBJECT, but if
the struct DATA_TYPE1 is first casted to a DATA_BASE_OBJECT and then
copied, the included sub object DATA_TYPE1 is not also copied.</p>

<p>i then thought what about finding out the size of the actual object
to copy and then just memcopy it, but the bytes are not stored in 
one row and how do i find out the real size in memory of the
struct DATA_TYPE1 which holds a std::string?</p>

<p>Which other c++ methods are available to deepcopy an unknown datatype
(and to maybe get the datatype information somehow else during

"7785354","1","7786578","","2011-10-16 15:41:22","","2","4872","<p>About 2 days ago I decided to write code to explicitly calculate the Model-View-Projection (""MVP"") matrix to understand how it worked. Since then I've had nothing but trouble, seemingly because of the projection matrix I'm using.</p>

<p>Working with an iPhone display, I create a screen centered square described by these 4 corner vertices:</p>

<pre><code>        const CGFloat cy = screenHeight/2.0f;
        const CGFloat z = -1.0f;
        const CGFloat dim = 50.0f;

        vxData[0] = cx-dim;
        vxData[1] = cy-dim;
        vxData[2] = z;
        vxData[3] = cx-dim;
        vxData[4] = cy+dim;
        vxData[5] = z;
        vxData[6] = cx+dim;
        vxData[7] = cy+dim;
        vxData[8] = z;
        vxData[9] = cx+dim;
        vxData[10] = cy-dim;
        vxData[11] = z;
</code></pre>

<p>Since I am using OGLES 2.0 I pass the MVP as a uniform to my vertex shader, then simply apply the transformation to the current vertex position:</p>

<pre><code>uniform mat4 mvp;
attribute vec3 vpos;
void main()
{
  gl_Position = mvp * vec4(vpos, 1.0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>For now I have simplified my MVP to just be the P matrix. There are two projection matrices listed in the code shown below. The first is the standard perspective projection matrix, and the second is an explicit-value projection matrix I found online. </p>

<pre><code>CGRect screenBounds = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds];
const CGFloat screenWidth = screenBounds.size.width;
const CGFloat screenHeight = screenBounds.size.height;

const GLfloat n = 0.01f;
const GLfloat f = 100.0f;
const GLfloat fov = 60.0f * 2.0f * M_PI / 360.0f;
const GLfloat a = screenWidth/screenHeight;
const GLfloat d = 1.0f / tanf(fov/2.0f);


// Standard perspective projection.
GLKMatrix4 projectionMx = GLKMatrix4Make(d/a, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,
                                         0.0f, d, 0.0f, 0.0f,
                                         0.0f, 0.0f, (n+f)/(n-f), -1.0f,
                                         0.0f, 0.0f, (2*n*f)/(n-f), 0.0f);
// The one I found online.
GLKMatrix4 projectionMx = GLKMatrix4Make(2.0f/screenWidth,0.0f,0.0f,0.0f,
                                         0.0f,2.0f/-screenHeight,0.0f,0.0f,
                                         0.0f,0.0f,1.0f,0.0f,
                                         -1.0f,1.0f,0.0f,1.0f);
</code></pre>

<p>When using the explicit value matrix, the square renders exactly as desired in the centre of the screen with correct dimension. When using the perspective projection matrix, nothing is displayed on-screen. I've done printouts of the position values generated for screen centre <code>(screenWidth/2, screenHeight/2, 0)</code> by the perspective projection matrix and they're enormous. The explicit value matrix correctly produces zero.</p>

<p>I think the explicit value matrix is an orthographic projection matrix - is that right? My frustration is that I can't work out why my perspective projection matrix fails to work.</p>

<p>I'd be tremendously grateful if someone could help me with this problem. Many thanks.</p>

 GLKMatrix4 mvp = GLKMatrix4Multiply(projectionMx, ts);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>The new MVP code:</p>

<pre><code>GLKMatrix4 ts = GLKMatrix4Make(2.0f/screenWidth, 0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f,
                               0.0f, 2.0f/-screenHeight, 0.0f, 1.0f,
                               0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,
                               0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);

// Using Apple perspective, view matrix generators
// (I can solve bugs in my own implementation later..!)
GLKMatrix4 _p = GLKMatrix4MakePerspective(60.0f * 2.0f * M_PI / 360.0f,
                                          screenWidth / screenHeight,
                                          Zn, Zf);

                                      0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
GLKMatrix4 _mvp = GLKMatrix4Multiply(_p, _mv);
GLKMatrix4 mvp = GLKMatrix4Multiply(_mvp, ts);
</code></pre>

<p>Still nothing visible at the screen centre, and the transformed x,y coordinates of the screen centre are not zero.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong></p>

<p>Using the transpose of <code>ts</code> instead in the above code works! But the square no longer appears square; it appears to now have aspect ratio <code>screenHeight/screenWidth</code> i.e. it has a longer dimension parallel to the (short) screen width, and a shorter dimension parallel to the (long) screen height.</p>

<p>I'd very much like to know (a) why the transpose is required and whether it is a valid fix, (b) how to correctly rectify the non-square dimension, and (c) how this additional matrix <code>transpose(ts)</code> that we use fits into the transformation chain of <strong>Viewport * Projection * View * Model * Point</strong> .</p>

<p>For (c): I understand what the matrix <em>does</em>, i.e. the explanation by Christian Rau as to how we transform to range [-1, 1]. But is it correct to include this additional work as a separate transformation matrix, or should some part of our MVP chain be doing this work instead?</p>

<p>Sincere thanks go to Christian Rau for his valuable contribution thus far.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 4</strong></p>

<p>My question about ""how ts fits in"" is silly isn't it - the whole point is the matrix is only needed because I'm choosing to use screen coordinates for my vertices; if I were to use coordinates in world space from the start then this work wouldn't be needed!</p>

<p>Thanks Christian for all your help, it's been invaluable :) Problem solved.</p>

<p>TO DO: make the function return the number of incidents limited to the two below conditions: year and country declared with two values the function carries: <code>$year</code> and <code>$country</code></p>

<p><strong>the year</strong> is defined in model <code>Event1</code> (table name = <code>events</code> - as function <code>year()</code> defined in the model PHP file. 
The output is a 4 digit year (produced from <code>created_at</code> or date declared in other columns), which should match the year carried in the above code</p>

<p><strong>the country</strong> is much simpler, but still I hav no idea how to make it work.
The value to match $country is stored in column <code>base_country_id</code> in the <code>Entity</code> model, table name <code>entities</code> of course.</p>

  <p>A Set has many Pieces</p>

<p>Now, I have started to write Rabl json templates for both models and each outputs their relationship items, eg: Set also outputs it's Pieces and A Pieces outputs the Set it belongs to.</p>

<p>I ahve done this separately for now due to this issue but wondered what the best way of resolving this issue is as I would like to convert it so that the template for a Set allows the Pieces in it to use the template for a Piece, However, that Piece template also outputs it's set which would use the template for a Set and it would keep looping and fall over.</p>

<p>Is there a way around this?</p>

<p>Since writing this question I have gone ahead and built it out and yes, this issue has actually occurred. The result I get is a json file with a 500 Internal Server Error.</p>

<p>I am doing this because I have to have some research assistants compare some observations from two data sets that could not be matched because of name variants.  The idea is to throw up a name from one data set (say set A) and then based on a key match find all the names attached to that key in the other dataset (set B).  One a match has been identified I don't want to show the value from B again to speed things up for them.  Because there are 6,000 observations I also don't want them to have to start at the beginning of A each time they get back to work.  However, I can fix that by letting them chose to enter the last key from A they worked with.  But I really need to reduce B once the match has been identified  </p>

<p>Basically, what the program does is receives 2 arguments, for example <code>Sep-22-07 11:45am</code>
and returns it in this format <code>yyyymmddhhmm</code> - <code>200709071145</code></p>

<p>Now the weird thing happens when I send the 2nd parameter with two zeros at the beginning, like that ... 00:01am, for example. then the whole set month, set day, set year starts to freak and returns me that output:</p>

<pre><code>0.000u 0.001s 0:00.00 0.0%      0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
0.000u 0.001s 0:00.00 0.0%      0+0k 0+8io 0pf+0w
0.000u 0.001s 0:00.00 0.0%      0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
</code></pre>

<p>+ the other output.</p>

<p>There are in the program other echos, but I just used them to debug.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks in advance. I am kind of a newbie in CShell, so if that's some easy bug I am sorry, but I can't seem to find it.</p>

<p>And the css:</p>

<pre><code>.button:before{
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This file works great, the css is used properly and thanks to the :before pseudo in my css file I have a nice extra box around my button.</p>

<p>Now that I was sure that the style worked i wanted to create a web control in ASP.Net
So I created one, here is some code-sample.</p>

<pre><code>protected override void RenderContents(HtmlTextWriter output)
    {
        output.AddAttribute(HtmlTextWriterAttribute.Id, this.ID);
        output.AddAttribute(HtmlTextWriterAttribute.Class, String.IsNullOrEmpty(this.CssClass) ? ""button"" : this.CssClass);          

        if (this.Style.Count&gt;0)
            output.AddAttribute(HtmlTextWriterAttribute.Style, this.Style.ToString());
        if(this.Width != default(Unit))
            output.AddAttribute(HtmlTextWriterAttribute.Width, this.Width.ToString());
        if (this.Height != default(Unit))
        output.AddAttribute(HtmlTextWriterAttribute.Height, this.Height.ToString());

        output.RenderBeginTag(""a"");
        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(ImageSrc))
        {
            output.AddAttribute(HtmlTextWriterAttribute.Style, String.Format(""background: url('{0}') no-repeat {1}px {2}px;"",ImageSrc,ImageXPos, ImageYPos));
            output.RenderBeginTag(""div"");
            output.RenderEndTag();
        }
        output.Write(Text);
        output.RenderEndTag();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The html generated is the same as in my test file. but for some reason the :before css isn't applied. Can anybody help me solving this problem?</p>

<p><em>My testfile was pure html but when i put the pure html code into my asp.net site it also doesn't apply the :before style</em></p>

<p>This is a small Fiddle example where you can't see the error because it ain't ASP.net
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Beejee/9tb69/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a></p>

<p>SOLVED:
Seems like the problem is with the z-index.
atm it is -2 which means it is displayed behind all the other content of the page.

By the time that I retrieve the data I only got the last row from sqlite.

<p>CODE BEFORE ADDING THE SQLITE CODE:</p>

<p>I have a page that lists products. The page has two layouts (list and grid) with a toggle to switch between the views (basically changing the CSS behind the view) this is all working as expected !</p>

<p>I am using full text search on the page containing of a search box (text input) that filters the products based on the entered search string etc... this is also working as expected.</p>

<p>I have a keyup event listener on the text input so that the data is filtered on each key press using an ajax get response. The data is filtered correctly however the view state / switch is not considered. </p>

<p>E.g. the default view is a list. If I do not change the view and search, everything is updated correctly: the correct results renders as a list. However, if I change to the grid view, and then search, although the results are correct the view is switched back to the original (list) view. </p>

<p>The switch toggle also stops working after a search has passed. </p>

<p>I am not sure, but it seems like the $.get methods response reloads the original file not containing any added classes (in relation to the view change) that have been added. It also appears that all JS added on document load is lost. </p>

<p>This is ""basically"" what I have: </p>

<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>

<pre><code>.hideSection {
  display: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code> &lt;form accept-charset=""UTF-8"" action=""/employees"" id=""employee_search"" method=""get""&gt;
     &lt;input autocomplete=""off"" id=""query"" name=""query"" type=""text""&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;

 &lt;div class=""btn-group""&gt;
   &lt;button id=""listViewButton"" type=""button"" class=""btn btn-default btn-sm""&gt;LIST&lt;/button&gt;
   &lt;button id=""gridViewButton"" type=""button"" class=""btn btn-default btn-sm""&gt;GRID&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""listView"" class=""list-view""&gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""gridView"" class=""grid-view hide-view"" &gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>JS (CoffeScript)</strong></p>

<pre><code>$(""#gridViewButton"").click -&gt;
    $("".gridView"").removeClass ""hideSection""
    $("".listView"").addClass ""hideSection""

$(""#listViewButton"").click -&gt;
    $("".listView"").removeClass ""hideSection""
    $("".gridView"").addClass ""hideSection""

$(""#employee_search input"").keyup -&gt;
    $.get $(""#employee_search"").attr(""action""), $(""#employee_search"").serialize(), null, ""script""
    false
</code></pre>

<p>As said, all searching works as expected, the problem is that the view looses its state (List or Grid) when searching, and additionally all JS appears not to work after the search - im not sure if this is something to do with the response from the $.get method as looking at it in the inspector, it contains the HTML from the original file not the modified file after changing the view etc.. </p>

<p>Any help on this in relation to keeping the view state on searching would be greatly appreciated !</p>

<p>Thanks,
Jon.</p>

<p>Now I want to set a minimum size of this window.. In SWT it worked with</p>

<pre><code>shell.setMinimumSize(100,100)

<p>but in my the org.eclipse.jface.window.ApplicationWindow there is no such method..</p>

<p>I've tried</p>

<p>(my implementation ""public class MainView extends ApplicationWindow {"")</p>

<p>but it doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>this.getShell()
</code></pre>

<p>returns null.</p>

<p>By the way, I searched for a good documentation about JFace in gernal, for now especially for the Application Window. But I couldn't find anything really good and extensive.</p>

<p>The documentation in SWT, especially JFace is very dispairing.. Too bad, because there are nice features in it.</p>

<p>So, I have the icons next to the elements already, I don't want them to be visable until they have an active class like <code>Home</code> does. I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>if($('.navbar-nav li').hasClass('active') &amp;&amp; $('.navbar-nav li a').val() === ""Home""){
    $('.navbar-nav li.active a').prepend('test ');
}
</code></pre>

<p>but it didn't work. I have different icons for each element so I'm guessing <code>elseif</code> for each case. </p>

<p>Markup for the navigation (displayed with PHP):</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php
      $nav = array(
     'Home' =&gt; 'index.php',
     '&lt;span class=""icon-bubbles""&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Forums' =&gt; '#',

        foreach($nav as $name =&gt; $link):
    ?&gt;
    &lt;li &lt;?php if($request == $link) echo 'class=""active""'; ?&gt;&gt;&lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo $link; ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;?php echo $name ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<p>This is the strace for console:</p>

<pre><code>read(0, ""3000\n"", 512)                  = 5

ReadInt:
;
; Reads a 32-bit signed decimal integer from standard

; All valid digits occurring before a non-numeric character
; are converted to the integer value. Leading spaces are
; ignored, and an optional leading + or - sign is permitted.
; All spaces return a valid integer, value zero.
; Receives: nothing
; Returns:  If CF=0, the integer is valid, and EAX = binary value.
;   If CF=1, the integer is invalid and EAX = 0.

; Convert to binary (EDX -&gt; string, ECX = length)

    call    ParseInteger32  ; returns EAX, CF

    pop ecx
    pop edx
    ret
;--------------- End of ReadInt ------------------------

;--------------------------------------------------------
ReadString:
;
; Reads a string from the keyboard and places the characters
; in a buffer.
; Receives: EDX offset of the input buffer
;           ECX = maximum characters to input (including terminal null)
; Returns:  EAX = size of the input string.
; Comments: Stops when Enter key (0Dh,0Ah) is pressed. If the user
; types more characters than (ECX-1), the excess characters
; are ignored.

I've created a new Menu within the Admin area of WordPress but when assigned to the theme, it still doesn't show correctly. Apologies in advance if I'm being totally blind here but PHP isn't my strong point too.</p>

<p>So below is the code in question, related to where the menu is in the header section:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""nav-primary"" class=""nav""&gt;&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;?php if ( is_user_logged_in() ) {
        wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' =&gt; 'logged-in-menu' ) ); /* if the visitor is logged in, this primary navigation will be displayed */
    } else {
        wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' =&gt; 'header-menu' ) ); /* if the visitor is NOT logged in, this primary navigation will be displayed. if a single menu should be displayed for both conditions, set the same menues to be displayed under both conditions through the Wordpress backend */
    } ?&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--#nav-primary--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I know that the 'header-menu' is pointing to a new Menu I set up, but it's not showing the correct one. Instead, it's showing lots of menu items, when the one I set up has only 4 items.</p>

<p>Can anyone shed any light on this at all? I would really appreciate some help.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>BTW, you may also see this question on other forums like xUnit.net, et cetera,<br>
because it's an important question to me. I apoligize in advance for my<br>
cross posting; your opinions are very important to me and not everyone<br>
in this forum   belongs to the other forums too.  </p>

<p>I was looking at a large decade old legacy system which has had over 700 unit tests<br>
written recently (700 is just a small beginning). The tests happen to be written<br>
in MSTest but this question applies to all testing frameworks AFAIK.  </p>

<p>When I ran, via vs2008 ""ALL TESTS"", the final count was only seven tests.<br>
That's about 1% of the total tests that have been written to date.  </p>

<p>MORE INFORMATION: The ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM source code, including its unit tests,<br>
is available on CodePlex; those unit tests are also written in MSTest<br>
even though (an irrelevant fact) Brad Wilson later joined the ASP.NET MVC team<br>
as its Senior Programmer.  All 2000 plus tests get run, not just a few.  </p>

<p>QUESTION: given that AFAIK the purpose of unit tests is to identify breakages<br>
in the SUT, am I correct in thinking that the ""best practice"" is to always,<br>
or at least very frequently, run all of the tests?  </p>

<p><strong>updated 2010-05-22</strong>  </p>

<p>First, thank you to everyone who has provided excellent answers.  Your answers
confirm my general conclusion that running all unit tests after every local rebuild is
the best practice regardless whether one is practicing TDD (test before) or classic
unit testing (test after).</p>

<p>imho, there is more than one best answer to this question but AFAIK SO lets
me select just one, so in an effort to be fair, I've given the check mark to
Pete Johns for being first and for earning the most up votes from the SO
community.  Finland's Esko Luontola also gave a great answer (I hope
he's not getting buried in volcanic ash) and two very good links that
are worth your time imho; definitely the link to F.I.R.S.T. is to me inspirational;
AFAIK, only xUnit.net in the .NET world offers the ""any order, any time"".
Esko's second link is to a truly excellent 92 minute video ""Integration Tests Are a Scam""
presented by J. B. (Joe) Rainsberger ( <a href=""http://jbrains.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jbrains.ca</a> where there is more content
worth my time).  BTW, Esko's weblog is also worth a visit <a href=""http://orfjackal.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orfjackal.net</a>.</p>

For example, given TWO, TWO, and FOUR, the program would find digit substitutions for each letter such that the mathematical expression</p>

<pre><code>   TWO 
+  TWO 
------
  FOUR
</code></pre>

<p>is true, with the inputs assumed to be right justified. One way to go about this would of course be to just brute force it, assigning every possible substitution for each letter with nested loops, trying the sum repeatedly, etc., until the answer is finally found. </p>

<p>My thought is that though this is terribly inefficient, the underlying loop-check thing may be a feasible (or even necessary) way to go--after a series of deductions are performed to limit the domains of each variable. I'm finding it kind of hard to visualize, but would it be reasonable to first assume a general/padded structure like this (each X represents a not-necessarily distinct digit, and each C is a carry digit, which in this case, will either be 0 or 1)? :</p>

<pre><code>   CCC.....CCC
   XXX.....XXXX
+  XXX.....XXXX
----------------
  CXXX.....XXXX 
</code></pre>

<p>With that in mind, some more planning thoughts:</p>

<p>-Though leading zeros will not be given in the problem, I probably ought to add enough of them where appropriate to even things out/match operands up. </p>

<p>-I'm thinking I should start with a set of possible values 0-9 for each letter, perhaps stored as vectors in a 'domains' table, and eliminate values from this as deductions are made. For example, if I see some letters lined up like this </p>

<pre><code> A
 C
--
 A
</code></pre>

<p>, I can tell that C is zero and this eliminate all other values from its domain. I can think of quite a few deductions, but generalizing them to all kinds of little situations and putting it into code seems kind of tricky at first glance. </p>

<p>-Assuming I have a good series of deductions that run through things and boot out lots of values from the domains table, I suppose I'd still just loop over everything and hope that the state space is small enough to generate a solution in a reasonable amount of time. But it feels like there has to be more to it than that! -- maybe some clever equations to set up or something along those lines. </p>

<p>Tips are appreciated! </p>

My idea is, that there is an interface for plugins, that has the following features:</p>

<pre><code>getDependencies -&gt; all dependencies of the plugin to other plugins
getFunctions -&gt; all functions that this plugin introduces
initialize -&gt; a function that is called when loading the plugin
</code></pre>

<p>(I could imagine to have a topological sorting algorithm on the dependencies to decide the order in which the plugins are initialized.)</p>

<p>I would like to implement multithreading, meaning that each plugin runs in its own thread, that has a working queue of function-calls that will be executed serially. When a plugin calls the function of another plugin it calls the manager who will in turn insert the function-call into the queue of the other plugin.</p>

<p>Further the manager should provide some kind of event system in which the plugins can register their own events and become listeners to the events of others.</p>

<p>Also I want to be able to reload a plugin if the code has changed or its thread crashed, without shutting down the manager/application. I already read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/437589/how-do-i-unload-reload-a-python-module"">How do I unload (reload) a Python module?</a> in conjunction with this.</p>

<p>To make it clear once more: The manager should not provide any other functionality than supporting its plugins with a common communication interface to each other, the ability to run side by side (in a multithreaded manner without requiring the plugins to be aware of this) and restoring updated/crashed plugins.</p>

<p>So my questions are: Is it possible to do this in python? And if yes are there design mistakes in this rough sketch? I would appreciate any good advice on this.</p>

<p>So my assignment is to make two divs with text in them:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id = ""changeable"" class = ""normal""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id = ""staysSame""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloo bloo bloo bloo bloo bloo bloo bloo bloo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I'm supposed to make two buttons with event handlers that change the font size using JQuery/JavaScript/CSS</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type = ""button"" onclick = ""button1Click()"" id = ""button1"" value = ""Enlarge""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;input type = ""button"" onclick = ""button2Click()"" id = ""button2"" value = ""Shrink""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm supposed to make a CSS page for each font size (this is exactly how I need it, other than the exact font sizes)</p>

<pre><code>.large{
    font-size: 20pt;
}
.normal{
    font-size: 14pt;
}
.small{
    font-size: 10pt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And since I am new to JQuery, I have no idea how to use it for the most part. So right now I just have some JavaScript that doesn't work. Which is not surprising because I don't know much JS either wooooo</p>

<pre><code>var large = GetElementByClassName(""large"");
var normal = GetElementByClassName(""normal"");
var small = GetElementByClassName(""small"");

function button1Click(){
    normal.style.fontsize = large.style.fontsize;
}
function button2Click(){
    normal.style,.fontsize = small.style.fontsize;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks all help is appreciated!</p>

I have simplified this that the lines will show only the distance in some x meters units. Such that each next arc/line shows points the next x meters away.</p>

<p>It must be something like this:<br>
 <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/dRFX3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So I know that this can be achieved by using lines on the horizontal bottom and applying some AFFINE transformation on it containing rotation and displacement. 
Any ideas on how to achieve this?</p>

<p>In other words, is it better to just always pull the records in the first query (not use <code>COUNT</code>), then count the records in code (Java).  If the user wants to run the second query, then great, I already have the data.  If not, then just dump it.</p>

Problem is, once it goes outside it stops reporting the correct <code>Y</code> value and keeps reporting the last <code>Y</code> value when my finger was over the keyboard view.</p>

<p>For debugging I only added a simple <code>onTouchListener</code> so I know the rest of the service is not interfering in any way with the touch event.</p>

<p>The odd thing is, the <code>Y</code> value is reported correctly in Gingerbread and when my ICS device is in landscape. As stated below, the view doesn't seem to respond to hover events.</p>

<p>I tried adding the <code>onTouch</code> to the root view, but the results were exactly the same. It's really ming boggling why it can detect a move but not its correct <code>Y</code> axis.</p>

<p>I initially had an activity that was the start up activity (Activity A). It had the tag <code>android:launchMode=""singleTask""</code> associated with it. No problems. My requirements changed and now i'm making Activity B the startup activity. I copied the intent filter over, I changed the name to "".ActivityB"" and I moved the launch mode tag over as well.</p>

<p>It seems to work okay; when I start the app I go to Activity B. However when I go from Activity B to Activity A and then click the back button the app exits and won't reopen (it will reopen if I don't have the launch mode tag.)</p>

<p>Another example. If I go from Activity A to Activity B to Activity A to Activity B everything is fine. When I click back i go to Activity A (as expected) however when I click back again I go to a previous instance of Activity A (uh oh) then I click back again and exit the app. Both times skipping Activity B.</p>

I store the objects representing my users in an associative array and right now the index of those objects are the sockets id of that connection.

The problem araises when i have an handler that is used to send a message from an user to another, i make an example:</p>

<p>User A needs to send a message to user B, my protocol specifies the message as something like this:</p>

<pre><code>MSG_KEY:{MSG:'hello world',USER_ID:'12345'}

<p>We have a sharepoint add-in that needs to obtain data from an api, this api in turn calls a WCF service to obtain the data. Both the api and the WCF service are hosted on azure. The WCF service has delegated permissions to sharepoint (doesn't really help here!), the api does not.</p>

<p>Both the WCF service and the sharepoint online site use the same Azure AD.</p>

<p>The WCF service needs authentication, this is done with the resource access token obtained from the authorization code.</p>

<p>Now, my thinking was, all the authentication can be done transparently on the users behalf if they are already logged in to sharepoint. But I am having a few issues making this concrete.</p>

<p>My idea for the workflow was that the api will get the authorization code from a request from the sharepoint add-in, this will in turn generate the resource access token, send it to the WCF service, and pass the data back to the api. Which will in turn pass it back to the sharepoint add-in.</p>

<p>Is this even possible? Can I grab the authorization token from a sharepoint add-in without requiring any additional requests for credentials?</p>

<p>All this is made even harder with that fact that we cannot (due to requirements - which we may be able to bend) use CORS, everything needs to be done through JSONP.</p>

<p>What I need is all the paths as well as content of each node from root to leaves. I'm trying to find some way to trace the path, not only current path but all possible paths. And because whenever we finish at a leaf, we need to start again from root, we need way to check to see if :</p>

<ul>
<li>The path has been traversed before or not? (use queues or stacks????)</li>
<li>Where does it stop? so we can pick up and continue from that (use flag to check???)</li>
</ul>

<p>The tree:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JlK8F.png"" alt=""http://i59.tinypic.com/zkiznm.jpg""></p>

<p>So what I need to do is find all posible path from root A to leaves (V, Y, X, Q, Z, P, O, J, E, I, T, S, M)</p>

<p>And all possbile paths will be:</p>

<pre><code>A -&gt; C -&gt; G -&gt; L -&gt; R -&gt; V
A -&gt; C -&gt; G -&gt; L -&gt; R -&gt; U -&gt; Y
A -&gt; C -&gt; G -&gt; L -&gt; R -&gt; U -&gt; X
A -&gt; C -&gt; G -&gt; L -&gt; Q
A -&gt; C -&gt; G -&gt; Z
A -&gt; C -&gt; F -&gt; K -&gt; P
A -&gt; C -&gt; F -&gt; K -&gt; O
A -&gt; C -&gt; F -&gt; J
A -&gt; B -&gt; E
A -&gt; B -&gt; D -&gt; I
A -&gt; B -&gt; D -&gt; H -&gt; N -&gt; T
A -&gt; B -&gt; D -&gt; H -&gt; N -&gt; S
A -&gt; B -&gt; D -&gt; H -&gt; M
</code></pre>

<p>Each node will have data I need to extract. </p>

<p>When we go to the leave, we will need to start over from the beginning, but we need to find some way to keep track of the paths we have traverse so we don't have to do it again since the height of the tree is not just 7 levels like this example, it may up to 80-100. </p>

<p><strong>#EDITED</strong>
The reason I want to use BFS instead of DFS is because I want to avoid reaching at the leave level soon, since i will need to start at the beginning after that. If it haven't reach to the leave, it will be much easier to get as much data as possible, to build the tree. </p>

<p>I still thinking about the algorithm but I stucked:</p>

<p>Pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>Create an empty tree
Create an empty queue to keep track of nodes that need to be processed.
Create an empty arrray of array (A) to save path. This array will be built up with each child     array is a possible path:
[ [WIN,WIN,WIN,WIN,WIN,LOSE,WIN,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE],
  [WIN,WIN,WIN,WIN,WIN,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,],
.............................................................................................
  [LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,LOSE,WIN,LOSE]]
Create an empty arrray of array (B) to save flag. This array will have exact size with A but it will have 2 value 0 when we haven't visit that node, 1 when we visit it). So this array will change value from 0 to 1 when we visit node.
[ [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,],
....................................................
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],

Add the starting point to the tree as the root node
Add the root node to a queue for processing

Repeat until the queue is empty (or finish):
  Remove a node from the queue 
  For child value WIN: 
    If the child hasn't already been processed: 
      Add it to the queue 
      Add it to array of array A
      Set 1 to array of array B
      Create an edge in the graph that connects the node and its neighbor

I programmatically created a UIScrollView and am adding it to my tableView Cells contentView. When the scrollView is added, I iterate through a parse query array and create a labels for all of the items in the array then set the labels text to the NSStrings in the array. I then add the label to the subview of the scrollView. I add items to this this subview with an IBAction so every time I hit a button it adds text to the parse array and then the text is set to the label allowing it to display in the scrollView.</p>

<p>I want the users to be able to edit the data so I have a button labeled edit. When this button is pressed, a modal view is presented and it's a tableView of all the items that I want to be edited. When I delete the items in the tableview and dismiss the view, the scrollview doesn't update. The only time the scrollview updates with the proper data from parse is if I close the app out and reopen. </p>

<pre><code>FT_Glyph_To_Bitmap( &amp;image, FT_RENDER_MODE_NORMAL, 0, /* no additional translation */1);
</code></pre>

<p>Possible values for second parameter in function FT_Glyph_To_Bitmap are:</p>

<ul>
<li>FT_RENDER_MODE_NORMAL - This is the default render mode; it corresponds to 8-bit anti-aliased bitmaps.</li>
<li>FT_RENDER_MODE_LIGHT  - This is equivalent to FT_RENDER_MODE_NORMAL. It is only defined as a separate value because render modes are also used indirectly to define hinting algorithm selectors. See FT_LOAD_TARGET_XXX for details.</li>
<li>FT_RENDER_MODE_MONO - This mode corresponds to 1-bit bitmaps (with 2 levels of opacity).</li>
<li>FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD - This mode corresponds to horizontal RGB and BGR sub-pixel displays like LCD screens. It produces 8-bit bitmaps that are 3 times the width of the original glyph outline in pixels, and which use the FT_PIXEL_MODE_LCD mode.</li>
<li>FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD_V - This mode corresponds to vertical RGB and BGR sub-pixel displays (like PDA screens, rotated LCD displays, etc.). It produces 8-bit bitmaps that are 3 times the height of the original glyph outline in pixels and use the FT_PIXEL_MODE_LCD_V mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I understand values FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD and FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD_V uses for generating 24 bpp bitmaps.</p>

<p>So we can't use function FT_Glyph_To_Bitmap() for generating 16bpp fonts because we haven't possible constant for it.</p>

removeAt :: [a] -&gt; Int -&gt; [a]

  | length xs &lt;= n || n &lt; 0 = error ""Index out of bounds""
  | otherwise = let (ys, zs) = splitAt n xs
                    in ys ++ (tail zs)

<p>Now when I load this in <code>ghci</code> this works correctly for valid arguments:</p>

<pre><code>*Main&gt; rndSelectIO' ""asdf"" 2 &gt;&gt;= putStrLn

<p>However, strange things happen when I use an index that is out of bounds:</p>

<pre><code>*Main&gt; rndSelectIO' ""asdf"" 5 &gt;&gt;= putStrLn
dfas*** Exception: Number of items requested is larger than list
*Main&gt; rndSelectIO' ""asdf"" 2 &gt;&gt;= putStrLn
*** Exception: Number of items requested is larger than list

<p>As you can see, the following 2 (for me) unexpected things happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>Instead of directly giving an error it first print a permutation of the input.</li>
<li>After it has given an error once, it won't execute at all anymore.</li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect that 1. has to do with lazy evaluation, but I have absolutely no clue why 2. happens. What's going on here?</p>

<p>I have created two <strong>Entities</strong>. First is <strong>Player</strong> and second is <strong>VehicleDetail</strong>.  The both have ManyToMany relationships:</p>

<p>Player:</p>

<pre><code>@ManyToMany(mappedBy = ""players"", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List&lt;VehicleDetail&gt; vehicleDetails;
</code></pre>

<p>VehicleDetail</p>

<pre><code>@ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List&lt;Player&gt; players;
</code></pre>

<p>I have created JSP pages where you can create new Players and VehicleDetails. I have added Restfull web services for my entities. They will provide me information about entities as JSONs. </p>

<p>When I add new Players and VehicleDetails through my JSP pages then I test Restfull service by GET HTTP method, it shows me right JSON.</p>

<p>Then I have added VehicleDetail to my Players list and Player to VehicleDetails list and updated both of them:</p>

<pre><code>Player player = db.getPlayer(playerId);
VehicleDetail detail = db.getVehicleDetail(detailId);

player.getVehicleDetails().add(detail);
detail.getPlayers().add(player);

db.updateObject(player);
db.updateObject(detail);
</code></pre>

<p>Code for <strong>db.updateObject(Object o)</strong> is:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void updateObject(Object o) {
    em.merge(o);
    em.flush();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when I try to see my Player. I create HTTP GET method to see Player as JSON. It shows me ""INFINITE"" JSON. It shows me that it got VehicleDetail that got this Player that got this VehicleDetail that got this Player and so on. And it gives me exception;</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/codehaus/jackson/map/JsonMappingException$Reference

<p>Question: What I need to do? FETCHTYPE.LAZY does not work.</p>

<p>The second one is the fact, that two fields are missing from Photo class, which is:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;alert ng-show=""alert.message"" type=""{{alert.type}}""&gt;{{alert.message}}&lt;/alert&gt;

<p>My ctrl has a variable that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.alert = {
    type: 'success',
    message: 'alert message'
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that <code>scope.type</code> in the directive keeps showing up as the string '{{alert.type}}' in the template, when I want it to show up as simply the string 'success'.</p>

<p>I've tried giving the directive an isolate scope like:</p>

<pre><code>scope: {
    type: '@'
}
</code></pre>

<p>but then the <code>ng-show=""alert.message</code> in the html fails (won't return true if it exists, so the directive is never displayed) because the directive lost access to the ctrl's scope.</p>

<p>I used Parallel.ForEach() and it works fine however I realized that if I had a large number of jobs (say over 300), when the thread count increases by 50 the silverlight application seems to stop responding (it does not freeze the browser but a grid which should have data populated in it is empty and the little doughnut keeps spinning).</p>

<p>Only when the thread counts drop again (i.e. all the jobs have finished processing) does the grid get populated.</p>

<p>I'm used to write a server by having a main class with static main() method which there performs all my initial startup code, like: connecting to DB, reading configuration files, initializing internal services and eventually creating the listening socket for accepting new connections.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Server {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Server server = new Server();

      server.run();
   }

   public void run() {
     // load configuration
      ....

    // Connect to DB
    ....

    // Initialize internal services
    ....

    // Create listening socket on server port
    ...

   // and more...
}
</code></pre>

<p>now to my question:</p>

<p>Vert.x forces me to make my main class extends Verticle class and override start() method
to  initialize the listening socket.</p>

<p>so now all my initialization process must be done inside this start() method.</p>

<p>Does this make sense??</p>

<p>and I can never run my application via command line like I'm used to but rather use the ""vertex"" app</p>

I used the following MSDN example to create the child process and redirect its standard input &amp; output : <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682499%28v=vs.100%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682499%28v=vs.100%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>On the parent side I send the same ""command"" twice using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>const char cmd[] = ""test\n"";
DWORD written, read;
BOOL success;
success = WriteFile(g_hChildStd_IN_Wr, cmd, sizeof(cmd), &amp;written, NULL);
success = WriteFile(g_hChildStd_IN_Wr, cmd, sizeof(cmd), &amp;written, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>On the child side, I read those commands through a <strong>fgets</strong> call.
The first command is read as expected. But when the second command is sent, the fgets call returns with an empty string and the next fgets call does not return. Here is the child process code:</p>

<pre><code>char *retStrP;
char str[256];
size_t strLen;

retStrP = fgets(str, 256, stdin);
strLen = strlen(str);
if (retStrP != str)
{
    char errorStr[256];
    int a = feof(stdin);
    int b = ferror(stdin);
    sprintf(errorStr, ""Fgets error, %d %d\n"", a, b);
    OutputDebugString(errorStr);
}
else if (strLen == 0)
{
    char errorStr[256];
    int a = feof(stdin);
    int b = ferror(stdin);
    sprintf(errorStr, ""Strlen is 0, %d %d\n"", a, b);
    OutputDebugString(errorStr);
}
</code></pre>

<p>From the previous code, the second call to fgets behaves as follow: the returned pointer is equal to the str buffer but the strlen is 0.</p>

<p>When reading the MSDN fgets documentation ( <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c37dh6kf%28v=vs.100%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c37dh6kf%28v=vs.100%29.aspx</a> ), I don't see any way it could return the pointer to the buffer passed as the first argument with the first buffer's byte being set to 0 (as far as the buffer size is greater than 1).
If an error occurs or the end of file is reached, the fgets should return NULL and either feof or ferror should return something not 0.</p>

<p>I suspect something is going wrong with the pipes handling but I can't figure out what... From the parent side, I don't do anything more with the stdin write pipe than sending the same buffer twice.
Any idea what could cause such a behaviour?</p>

I am trying to create a 2d array of size [3] and [100] the idea being it will store three strings which will be stored in a text file separated by tab. I have scoured the web for any help with this but failed to find any good answer. It needs to be an Array that it is stored in through Java but Ive spent hours trying to get this together. If anyone can answer this for me I would be very grateful. Thanks</p>

<p>I couldn't post my code for fear of mockery as it is terrible but it should be something like this:-
associates the String File with filename.txt
create a 2d Array size 3 colums and 100 rows. //here it should store the data from left to right with 3 strings on every line then seperated onto new lines.
then I need a way to add the string in the text file to the array. and at the end it should println the contents of the array. </p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

This is only a small portion of my GUI. <code>GridBagLayout</code> is the layout I want to use. How can I get the 3 component chunks to align on the Y-Axis and not keep adding to the X-Axis?</p>

<pre><code>    file1_tf = new JTextField(20);
    file1_tf.setEditable(false);
    file_select_panel = new JPanel(new GridBagLayout());
    GridBagConstraints gbc = new GridBagConstraints();

    gbc.gridx = 0;
    gbc.gridy = 0;
    file_select_panel.add(file1_tf);
    gbc.gridx = 1;
    gbc.gridy = 0;
    file_select_panel.add(add_f1_button);
    gbc.gridx = 2;
    gbc.gridy = 0;
    file_select_panel.add(rem_f1_button);

    gbc.gridx = 0;
    gbc.gridy = 1;
    file_select_panel.add(file3_tf);
    gbc.gridx = 1;
    gbc.gridy = 1;
    file_select_panel.add(add_f3_button);
    gbc.gridx = 2;
    gbc.gridy = 1;
    file_select_panel.add(rem_f3_button);

<pre><code>&lt;meta name=""apple-itunes-app"" content=""app-id=myAppStoreID, affiliate-data=myAffiliateData, app-argument=myURL""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I added that line to my HTML. Then I opened the web page on an iPhone and the ad is there, but it's above the top of the page. </p>

<p>The page uses <code>window.scrollTo(0,1)</code> to hide the url bar on iPhone, but it looks like the add is positioned at -50px, so I could try <code>window.scrollTo(-50,1)</code> but sometimes the ad is there and sometimes it's not. If you click the (X) on the ad, it remembers to not show the ad again until you clear the cache.</p>

<p>Is there a way to know if the ad is showing? Or am I just not able to hide the URL bar with this type of ad?</p>

<p>Consider the following documents:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""_id"": ""045bdeb40176b33cf07b21cd1fb3949e"",
    ""type"": ""test_result"",
    ""customer_id"": ""customer"",
    ""product_id"": ""product1"",
    ""type_id"": ""type"",
    ""version_id"": ""1.0.0"",                      

    ""timestamp"": 1381505909000,
    ""test_result"": ""passed"",

    ""serial_nr"": ""NEP000001""
}

{
    ""_id"": ""045bdeb40176b33cf07b21cd1fb3c434"",
    ""type"": ""measurement_result"",
    ""test_result_id"": ""045bdeb40176b33cf07b21cd1fb3949e"",

    ""measurement_id"": ""customer:product1:type:1.0.0:0"",
    ""timestamp"": 1381505909000,
    ""data"": 2.5                                 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The application contains data of units measured in different ways. One <code>test_result</code> document is inserted each time a unit is tested. Each unit has a unique <code>serial_nr</code>. One <code>measurement_result</code> document is inserted for each measurement made on a unit (typically around 50 measurements per unit). Each measurement for that unit has a unique <code>measurement_id</code>. When the results are inserted the <code>timestamp</code> is generated. One unit can be tested <strong>more than once</strong>.</p>

<p>The views that I'm trying to build are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Retrieve all data for the first time a unit was tested.</li>
<li>Retrieve all data for the latest time a unit was tested.</li>
<li>Retrieve all measurements of one <code>measurement_id</code>, but only for the oldest results. If any one unit has been tested more than once, only measurement results from the first test should be included. </li>
<li>Retrieve all measurements of one <code>measurement_id</code>, but only for the most recent results (same rules as for the oldest results).</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal is to reduce the <code>data</code> field to calculate statistics like <code>average</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code> and <code>standard deviation</code>, and it is very valuable to be able to separate the statistics by first/latest time a unit was tested.</p>

<p>I've been trying to use complex keys, very advanced reduces and many other approaches, but I can't seem to isolate the latest/newest results.</p>

<p>This application is still nowhere near production, so any solutions are welcome (even switching database system, I guess). Should I structure the data in any other way? Is this even possible to do? I will, in the long run, have lots of data so it is very important that I can calculate the statistics incrementally.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15320834/couchdb-map-reduce-view-counting-only-the-most-recent-items"">This question</a> seems to be more or the less the same as mine, but there were never any answers and I've already come as far as he did.</p>

<p><strong>Update #1</strong></p>

<p>For cases #1 and #2 I could probably just map by <code>[serial_nr, timestamp]</code> and then turn off reduce_limit to allow me to only return the most recent entry. I don't know how that affects performance in the long run though?</p>

<p>For #3 and #4 it's harder. Since I need to calculate grouped by <code>measurement_id</code> it needs to be the first element in the key array. But then what?</p>

<p>(To make things simpler I will now assume that the <code>measurement_result</code> documents also have the <code>serial_nr</code>)</p>

<pre><code>map: 
    function(doc) {
        if (doc.type == 'measurement_result')
            emit([doc.measurement_id, doc.serial_nr, doc.timestamp], doc.data)
    }

reduce: 
    _stats
</code></pre>

<p><code>GET</code> with <code>group_level=1</code> is my only option here because otherwise I will get separate results for each measurement_id - but I still have not managed to filter out only the most recent or the oldest results, this only gets me all of them. Now I could perhaps write a reduce function to somehow check for duplicate <code>serial_nr</code> and only return the most recent/oldest, but I can't figure out how.</p>

<p>Hope this clears up the question a bit.</p>

<p>My question is how do I implement jquery character counting and maxlength restriction and be able to retrieve &amp; display all the data from the textarea?</p>

<pre><code>// Set MaxLength to 255

// Get length of textarea

$(this).val().length

// Count how many &amp;, &lt;,&gt;,"",' then multiply by 4 (as each of these characters will convert into &amp;#??? which add extra 4 characters into database)  and Newline (add extra 1 character) in the textarea.

CountSpecial($(this).val()); //bug #1

// calculate remaining characters.

Remaining = max - $(this).val().length -CountSpecial($(this).val());

//Limit the data to varchar(255) to avoid data truncation.

If (Remaining &lt;0) {
//truncate to fix varchar(255)

//recalculate Remaining.

<p>Bug #1, I dont know how to accurately calculate the extra characters will be stored into database</p>

<p>Bug #2 I tried</p>

<pre><code>$(this).val($this.val().substring(0,$this.val().length-1); 
</code></pre>

<p>but it doesn't behave the way I want, as I use keyup function, if the user keeps holding a key, this calculation will not work. </p>

<pre><code>$(this).val($this.val().substring(0,$this.val().length+Remaining); 
</code></pre>

<p>fixed the problem when the user keeps holding a key, but product another problem. If the user key in something like ""&amp;"" it will remove the last 4 characters from textarea not 1. </p>

My intention is to sort the map based on 'value' and then walk through map with logic similar to if (tail at pos i != tail @ pos i + 1) then the 2 linkedlist done intersect and print them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add elements.</li>
<li>Iterate over the whole collection.</li>
<li>Remove some of those elements (see update below).iteration, see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not have to use a set or map type because there is no <em>external</em> requirement for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Indexing into it</li>
<li>Maintaining ordering.</li>
<li>Efficiently finding elements or test for them being in the collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I had to write it from scratch in C, I would use an exponentially growing dynamic array and the deletion operation would move the last element into the freed-up slot.  That way deletion is O(1).</p>

<p>If I want to use a C++ standard container it seems I could (a) use a <code>std::vector</code> but write the deletion operation by hand or (b) use an <code>std::list</code>.  I have a mild, but definite, dislike of linked lists.</p>

<p>Both solutions are acceptable to me, but I would really rather have it both ways: to use a vector but using only standard operations.  Is there a way to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>The comments below made clear that I am not looking for a general deletion operation.  My problem requires me to iterate over the collection frequently and on each pass I expect to discover that some elements have to be removed.  </p>

<p>I can do that whole operation in O(n) time regardless of the number of deletions.  But this is obviously a bespoke operation and I should have known I need to write my own loop.  Surprisingly though <code>remove_if</code> <em>almost</em> solves my problem.  If the only thing I needed to do in the iteration pass was identify the out-of-date elements, then <code>remove_if</code> would do the job, but I need to do other processing too.</p>

<p>In security.yml, I am simply switching out <code>http_basic</code> for <code>http_digest</code> and adding the required <code>key</code> property. All else remains the same.</p>

<p>Relevant configuration that works:</p>

<pre><code>firewalls:

        pattern: ^/
        anonymous: ~

<p>Relevant configuration that does not work:</p>

<pre><code>firewalls:
    main:         
        pattern: ^/
        anonymous: ~
        form_login: false            
        provider: fos_user_bundle
        http_digest:
            realm: ""Example Realm""
            key: ""%secret%""
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the only difference is switching out <code>http_basic</code> for <code>http_digest</code>. Changing the value of the <code>key</code> property appears to make no difference.</p>

<p>When using an in_memory provider, <code>http_digest</code> works just fine. This matter is only present when using the <code>fos_user_bundle</code> provider.</p>

<p>By working, I mean that with when using <code>http_basic</code>, the valid user credentials are accepted. When using <code>http_digest</code> the same valid user details are not accepted and the browser's default http authentication prompt is re-displayed.</p>

<p>Between security configuration changes, I clear both the dev and prod caches, empty the browser cache and close the browser.</p>

<p>Is there something critical I'm missing from the configuration?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I've logged a successful http_basic attempt and an unsuccessful http_digest attempt and diffed the logs.</p>

<p>Both logs are identical up to and including where Doctrine logs the SQL query used for authentication.</p>

<p>Following the authentication query in the http_digest log are the lines:</p>

<pre><code>security.DEBUG: Expected response: '3460e5c31b09d4e8872650838a0c0f1a' but received: '5debe5d0028f65ae292ffdea2616ac19'; is AuthenticationDao returning clear text passwords? [] []

<p>Passwords, using the FOSUserBundle, are salted and hashed.</p>

"27470825","1","27574644","","2014-12-14 15:30:40","","1","194","<p>I'm creating a Java Application that represents a school. My aim is to keep the application open for new features, so I'm trying to apply some Design Patterns to it.</p>

<p>What I have so far is a HSQLDB connected to my program. 
In the database one can store </p>

<ul>
<li>pupils</li>
<li>courses</li>
<li>years</li>
<li>exams</li>
<li>grades</li>
</ul>

<p>The current structure is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are classes for each of the objects that contain the attributes + setters and getters</li>
<li>for each object there is a DAO that manages the CRUD operations on the DB</li>
<li>each DAO implements a GenericDAO interface</li>
</ul>

<p>If i want to create a new pupil i can call: </p>

<ul>
<li>PupilDao pupil = new PupilDao();</li>
<li>pupil.connectToDB();</li>
<li>pupil.add(new Pupil(name, age,...));</li>
<li>pupil.disconnectDB();</li>
</ul>

<p>Every DAOs connectToDB() and disconnectDB() methods point to a DBuser-Classes connect() and disconnect() methods. So if I want to change the connection, there's only one place to do so.
So far, those operations work.</p>

<p>My questions are the:</p>

<p>1.) Is the current design a proper use of DAOs? I'm asking because i would rather have one
Dao for all objects because right now there's a lot of repetitive code in the DAOs. (e.g. get, update, delete...)</p>

<p>Now that the DB-Access works, I want to create a GUI using Swing. I have some experience doing this although not with the MVC-Pattern. </p>

<p>2.) As far as I understand, the DAOs + my object classes would be the Model here. Is that correct?</p>

<p>3.) My understanding of MVC is that in my View-Class (i.e. the GUI) I set listeners for my actions which point to different Controller-Classes implementing the ActionListener interface and in my Controller-Classes I would for example have a actionPerformed() that creates a new Pupil (using the DAO / Model - Classes). Am I on the right track here?</p>

<p>4.) Is it favourable to have one big Controller managing all actions over having different Controllers?</p>

<p>I'm asking those questions because I read/watched a lot about patterns/OO-Design and want to make sure my understanding is correct.
Furthermore I highly appreciate your thoughts on my design! What could be done more flexible or better to maintain later?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for every suggestion and sorry for the somewhat long explanation!</p>

<p>So the program spits something out (in the form of 
document.writeln statements); then asks the user for a new input (using prompt()); does some more crunching and spitting out until eventually it terminates. Here is my problem:</p>

<p>The program does not execute the document.writeln statements until it has executed all of the
prompt statements. The rest of the statements execute in proper order. </p>

<p>I'd really appreciate some help on understanding why this this happening. I know that Javascript has a peculiar notion of execution order and perhaps it is doing this because it likes to do the prompt()'s first because they are alerts, but I still don't get it.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>In this case the flexbox determines job titles. So, if the user types in 'Doctor' and selects the result, then the flexbox returns the code <code>&lt;input type=""hidden"" id=""fb_hidden"" name=""fb"" value=""2""&gt;</code>, where the value 2 relates to the job title 'Doctor' in the database. </p>

<p>When somebody selects Doctor I want a hidden div to appear, but if a different job title is selected, it stays hidden. Can somebody help me with this please?

<p>Anyhow, we're currently having issues getting permission to get the server infrastructure in place to deploy this.</p>

<p>One option tossed was that we could make the Django app a desktop application, accessing a remote DB instance.</p>

<p>As in, each of the users that needed to use it would install a local Python environment, with Django and our application, run a web-server, and then hit the remote DB.</p>

<p>Are there any particular issues or drawbacks you can see with this approach?</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, I thought maybe:</p>

<ul>
<li>The obvious one is we need to install the software first, it isn't usable from anywhere with a web browser</li>
<li>Likewise, pushing out updates will have to be a manual process, done on each client. We can't just do it once on the server.</li>
<li>Concurrency/Locking - I'm not sure how Django will handle this? Backing server will probably be Oracle, which does supports transactions and all that - however, how will Django cope with two instances hitting the same backing DB?</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that on the Rails side, there's things like Joyent Slingshot (was this deprecated?)</p>

<p><a href=""http://joyeur.com/2007/03/22/joyent-slingshot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joyeur.com/2007/03/22/joyent-slingshot/</a></p>

<p>which allow bundling a RoR app into a desktop app.</p>

I can make a one-to-many weapon entity that goes to specific weapons like m16 and ak47. Then I can make a one-to-many attachment entity that has specific entities like suppressor and red dot sight. Then I can add relationships like an inverse relationship from m16 to red dot. </p>

<p>So I believe I can make this diagram using core data's editor, but I'm not sure I could actually use this. If I wanted the user to be able to pick an m16 and then choose appropriate attachments, how would I read this from core data? I don't think I can because I'm not actually making the m16 object with all the possible attachments. I really hope this makes sense. </p>

<p>I started making a plist of all of this information but that sucks because now I have a lot many-to-many relationships that I need to make by hand.</p>

I've been unable to get express.router() to execute my routes correctly, which has caused me to dig deeper into what is actually happening when a page is requested from a server running an express app. </p>

var http = require('http');
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var server = http.createServer(app);

var router = express.Router();
router.get('/hi'), function (req, res) {
    res.send('/hi route response');
};
router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('default route reached');
});
app.use('*', router);
server.listen(config.server.listenPort);
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty standard stuff—but for some reason whenever I navigate to localhost:port/hi I am only getting the <code>res</code> from the <code>/</code> path, i.e. <code>router.get('/', function{} (res.send('default route reached'));</code></p>

<p>So I've become more interested in what's happening behind the scenes. I've noticed that the server only logs to the terminal the output not related to the <code>bodyParser</code> on the first request. I.e., the <code>console.log</code> at the top of the file only gets ran when the application is started, and never after, though <code>bodyParser</code> correctly logs requests for each request instance. </p>

<p>What's going on exactly when a request is made to the server? Is the <code>app</code> object and route cached and being served? Why is <code>app.js</code> not being re-evaluated on each request? Is only the <code>router</code> object responsible for sending requests over? </p>

<p>It would be helpful to know this, to figure out why my <code>router</code> is not responding with the correct route. </p>

<p>Everything works as I'd hoped except loading the JSON to actually do the replacements.</p>

<p>I've also tried:</p>

<pre><code>grunt.file.readJSON('src/locales/'+locale+'/i18n.json');

<p>which didn't work either, leaving me a little stumped. </p>

In a jupyter notebook when I execute ""%load_ext tikzmagic"" and then ""%tikz \draw (0,0) rectangle (1,1);"" I do not get a rectangle as the output. Instead I get the message ""No image generated.""

<p>I have an older laptop running Mac OS X 10.9.4 with LiveTeX-2014 and it works fine there with ipython 3.2. I have checked the PATH variable on my current laptop and on my older laptop. The only difference is on my current laptop ""/Library/TeX/texbin"" is in PATH, whereas on my older laptop ""/usr/texbin"" is in PATH. pdflatex, which is called on line 109 of tikzmagic.py is in both of these directories so I don't think that's the problem. </p>

<p>Also, when I run TeXShop 3.51 and use tikz in a latex document, it works fine. I am really puzzled as to what's going on. </p>

In my dealloc method, if I set this object to nil, will he be correctly deallocated?
Let me show an example. This the A.h class :</p>

<pre><code>@interface A: NSObject {
  B *bvariable;
}
-(id) init;
</code></pre>

<p>and his implementation :</p>

<pre><code> @implementation A

  -(id) init: { 
      bvariable= [[B alloc] init];


       /**
        *  Let say for some reason, I called   
       */   
       [bvariable retain];
   }
}

-(void) dealloc {
     bvariable = nil;
     [super dealloc];
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is when the GC will call <strong>dealloc</strong> on the A class, will the <strong>bvrariable</strong> be properly deallocated?</p>

<p>My guess is no because since i retained this object, so I must call <strong>release</strong> twice to release that object. Setting an object to nil will not deallocate them since I still send messages to bvrariable object. 
But someone told me the contrary. </p>

<p>Can someone enlight me plz?</p>

<p>Thanks for your advice !!</p>

In that library they implemented the uiscrollview delegate method and calling some functions related to the library. I have created a scrollview object and assigned the library class object. When i did scrolling my parent delegate methods calling correctly.</p>

<p>Now, i need to call a custom function(testFunction:) inside my class when one of the scrollview delegate method(scrollViewWillBeginDragging:) is calling. I tried declaring the scrollview delegate in my class but the library delegates are not calling up then!.</p>

<p>IoC is obviously one of the first things it got, but this leaves me with the service-locator pattern and a bad taste, and the wondering of whether it could be done better.  </p>

<p>Various people I've talked to online and off tell me that I could do property-injection with an HttpModule that scans a Page class for properties decorated with an Inject attribute or similar, but that sounds like a Reflection hit (cached, but still) on every request.  Not appealing.</p>

<p>So I was looking at other options, and came across <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms227439%28v=VS.85%29.aspx"">System.Web.IHttpHandlerFactory</a>, which has apparently been in the framework since v2.  One can remove the default *.aspx handler and replace it with one that uses a custom implementation, in httpHandlers web.config section.</p>

<p>So, the people I've talked to aren't dumb; I thought I'd ask here.  <strong>Are there any gotchas with replacing the webforms PageHandlerFactory with an IoC-based implementation...?</strong>  </p>

<p>It looks like it has both a CreateHandler and ReleaseHandler method, so life-style related memory leaks from the container keeping a reference to created components shouldn't be a problem...</p>

I'm having an issue where I save the file, open it in normal notepad.exe and the file comes out completely different to how i edited it on Notepad++.

<p>I have checked the code thoroughly and all the <code>GetDC()</code> calls are followed by <code>ReleaseDC()</code> calls.
