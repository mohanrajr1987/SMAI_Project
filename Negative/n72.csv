I think I've got the basic concepts all working, but when I go to connect to the body of my POST request, that's when things go awry. When I set up my callback function to simply pass a string to S3, it works just fine and the file is created in the appropriate S3 bucket:</p>

<pre><code>function postPoint(req, res, next) {

  var point = [
    { ""x"": ""0.12"" },
    { ""y"": ""0.32"" }
  ];

  var params = { Bucket: 'myBucket', Key: 'myKey', Body: JSON.stringify(point) };

  s3.client.putObject(params, function (perr, pres) {
    if (perr) {
        console.log(""Error uploading data: "", perr);
    } else {
        console.log(""Successfully uploaded data to myBucket/myKey"");
    }
  });

  res.send(200);
  return next();
}

server.post('/point', postPoint);
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, I need to eventually stream/pipe my request from the body of the request. I assumed all that I needed to do would be to simply switch the body of the params to the request stream:</p>

<pre><code>function postPoint(req, res, next) {

  var params = { Bucket: 'myBucket', Key: 'myKey', Body: req };

  s3.client.putObject(params, function (perr, pres) {
    if (perr) {
        console.log(""Error uploading data: "", perr);
    } else {
        console.log(""Successfully uploaded data to myBucket/myKey"");
    }
  });

  res.send(200);
  return next();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that ends up causing the following log message to be displayed: ""Error uploading data:  [TypeError: path must be a string]"" which gives me very little indication of what I need to do to fix the error. Ultimately, I want to be able to pipe the result since the data being sent could be quite large (I'm not sure if the previous examples are causing the body to be stored in memory), so I thought that something like this might work:</p>

<pre><code>function postPoint(req, res, next) {

  var params = { Bucket: 'myBucket', Key: 'myKey', Body: req };

  req.pipe(s3.client.putObject(params));

  res.send(200);
  return next();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since I've done something similar in a GET function that works just fine:(<code>s3.client.getObject(params).createReadStream().pipe(res);</code>). But that also did not work. </p>

<p>I'm at a bit of a loss at this point so any guidance would be greatly appreciated!</p>

Should I put a mutex around calls to getRand() and allow my code to serialise on getting random numbers, should I attempt to generate all the random numbers I require up front beforehand, or should I have a separate thread which fills a buffer of random numbers which is read from (with a mutex lock) in a producer-consumer fashion? Is the best solution different if I were to use /dev/random instead, which is a finite resource and might block?</p>

<p>So the problem is this: I try to connect to a database using PySide and QtSql module.</p>

<p>The critical snippet:</p>

<pre><code>from PySide import QtGui
from PySide import QtSql
import sys

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
    db = QtSql.QSqlDatabase.addDatabase('QODBC')  
    # or others: QMYSQL, QSQLITE etc.
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
</code></pre>

<p>and when I try to run it, I get a message:</p>

<pre><code>QSqlDatabase: QODBC driver not loaded
QSqlDatabase: available drivers: 
</code></pre>

<p>When I try equivalent <code>PyQt4</code> instead of <code>PySide</code>, I get no message which I assume means that the ODBC driver is available with PyQt4. However, unfortunately, I cannot switch my application from PySide to PyQt4 for many other reasons.</p>

<p>When I look into Python Lib folder I can see that <code>python-3.3.2\Lib\site-packages\PySide\plugins\sqldrivers</code> contains DLLs including <code>qsqlodbc4.dll</code>. So there is something more missing and I do not know what.</p>

<p>As I wrote the problem is not just with ODBC but with all database drivers.</p>

<p>1) the receiving <em>usually</em> works (I came to this problem from one app only)
 2) the ""donor"" app that fails to hookup with my app shares the image to another app (SkyDrive for example) just fine
 3) my manifest looks fine to me, the data format is registered and the file types are chosen</p>

<p>When I debug, I get the correct data format from the donor app (it's a ""bitmap"") and the bitmap format is ok too (png).</p>

<p>Further more, when I start the pool process, the IRandomAccessStreamWithContentType is fetched from the RandomAccessStreamReference and it shows the stream size correctly.</p>

<p>It is when I try to read this stream to the DataReader I get an exception:
   ""Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))""</p>

<p>Again, if I try to share an image from another app - it works just fine, and if I share from the ""donor"" app that is giving me issues to another app (not mine) it works too. So there must be a ""trust"" issue between the donor and my application set explicitly? Is that even possible? </p>

<p>How secure is this? It is my understaninding that a person could root their phone, obtain the APK and that this can be decompiled. Even if the code was obfuscated it wouldn't be too difficult to see that the application was a wrapper with a flag, and to fix the flag. Is this acceptable? I realise that there are always going to be ways around things, but this one seems quite easy.</p>

<p>Is there not a way in Eclipse where build flags can be used to compile different versions of code so that the full code isn't being given away in the free version?</p>

<p>In the current example, the <code>_charset</code> is computed in every instance. (Do correct me if my assumption is wrong.) I also assume the computation would be shared between instances (as opposed to recomputed) as both a class variable and as a constant?</p>

<p>Rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Song can be in 0 or more playlists.</li>
<li>A Playlist can contain 0 or more songs.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what I did was create this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Playlist

        public int PlaylistID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public DateTime Date { get; set; }

        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string SongArtURL { get; set; }

        public virtual Artist Artist { get; set; }
        public virtual Genre Genre { get; set; }
        public IList&lt;PlaylistSongs&gt; PlaylistSongs { get; set; }
        public IList&lt;Album&gt; Albums { get; set; }
    }

    public class PlaylistSongs
    {
        public int PlaylistID { get; set; }
        public int SongID { get; set; }

        public virtual Playlist Playlist { get; set; }
        public virtual Song Song { get; set; }

        public int NumberVotes { get; set; }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And I also have overridden <code>OnModelCreating</code> as such:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;PlaylistSongs&gt;()
                          .HasKey(cp =&gt; new { cp.SongID, cp.PlaylistID });

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Playlist&gt;()
                        .HasMany(c =&gt; c.PlaylistSongs)
                        .WithRequired()
                        .HasForeignKey(cp =&gt; cp.SongID);

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Song&gt;()
                        .HasMany(p =&gt; p.PlaylistSongs)
                        .WithRequired()
                        .HasForeignKey(cp =&gt; cp.PlaylistID);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>However, problem. Imagine if I want to create a <code>Song</code> which initially isn't attached to any <code>Playlist</code> (which works fine) and then add that Song to a Playlist. Since Playlist doesn't contain a list of Songs, but instead a list of PlaylistSongs, how would I do that?</p>

<p>What I want is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a list of Songs (independently)</li>
<li>Add that list of Songs to a Playlist</li>
<li>Code First Migrations Seed method would then create the association needed automatically in the PlaylistSongs table.</li>
<li>I could then let people vote on the Songs in a certain Playlist.</li>
<li>The field <code>NumberVotes</code> would change accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The updating code is something like:</p>

<pre><code>//insert some data in table 1, save element on an array gemedios.

//insert some data in table 2, save element on an array geldapgrupos.

foreach ($relations as $relation)

    $gemedio = $gemedios[$relation['id_gemedio']];
    $geldapgrupo = $geldapgrupos[$relation['id_geldapgrupo']];

    //$geldapgrupo-&gt;addGeMedio($medio);

    print_r($grupo);
    //$manager-&gt;persist($medio);
    //$manager-&gt;persist($grupo);
}
$manager-&gt;flush();
</code></pre>

<p>With the print_r I check the data in the output of the fixtures command, and it looks fine (the gegrupo have a related geldapgrupo and the geldapgrupo have the same gegrupo).</p>

<p>The problem is, as said before, that there is no data on the table ge_ldap_grupo.</p>

<p>Please can anyone help me?</p>

<p>When the app start will fetch User by email and password:</p>

<p>Later, when I want to display my buildings list I call the method getBuildingsByGuid like this:</p>

<p>If I use:       </p>

<pre><code>Buildings *buildingRow = [[DataController instance] fetchEntityOfType:object_Buildings withPredicate:@""guid = %@"", guid_building];
</code></pre>

<p>... my app work. With:</p>

<pre><code>Buildings *buildingRow = [user getBuildingsByGuid:guid_building];

<p>.. the app crash.</p>

<p>I preffer to use objects instead of predicate fetching...</p>

<p>I've read the docs on integrating autocomplete light and taggit <a href=""http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#module-autocomplete_light.contrib.taggit_tagfield"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, 
and the docs on integrating autocomplete light in the admin <a href=""http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. But there seems to be little (or no) discussion on doing both at the same time.</p>

<p>what I've got so far.</p>

<p>In <code>models.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models
from taggit.managers import TaggableManager
from taggit.models import TagBase, GenericTaggedItemBase


class MyTag(TagBase):
    description = models.CharField(max_length = 250, blank = True, null = True)

class MyTagThroughModel(GenericTaggedItemBase):
    tag = models.ForeignKey(MyTag, related_name = ""tagged_items"")

class MyModel(models.Model):
    Name = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
    ...
    tags = TaggableManager(through = MyTagThroughModel)
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>autocomplete_light_registry.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import autocomplete_light
from models import MyTag
autocomplete_light.register(MyTag)
</code></pre>

<p>How am I meant to structure <code>admin.py</code>?</p>

<p>If this was a non-admin form, the field would be given as:</p>

<pre><code>tags = TagField(widget = TagWidget('MyTagAutocomplete'))
</code></pre>

<p>If this was a non-taggit admin form, I would add the following to the admin model class:</p>

<pre><code>form = autocomplete_light.modelform_factory(MyTag)
</code></pre>

<p>How can I combine the two?</p>

<p>Anyway, my hosting service won't let me use simplexml_load_file, so I've been using cURL to get it then loading the string into the DOM, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$dom = new DOMDocument;
$dom-&gt;loadXML($rawXML);
if (!$dom) {
 echo 'Error while parsing the document';
 exit;
}
$xml = simplexml_import_dom($dom);
</code></pre>

<p>But I get errors (""DOMDocument::loadXML() [domdocument.loadxml]: Entity 'nbsp' not defined in Entity""), then I tried using SimpleXMLElement without luck (it shows the same error ""parser error : Entity 'nbsp' not defined"", etc... because of the HTML in that one element).</p>

<pre><code>$xml = new SimpleXMLElement($rawXML);
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, how do I skip/ignore/remove that element so I can parse the rest of the data?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks to mjv for the solution!... I just did this (for others that have the same trouble)</p>

This model already has several fields filled in; the ModelForm is used to collect other fields in the model.  The pre-existing fields are excluded in the ModelForm's definition.</p>

<p>The problem is, during POST processing, after successful validation of the ModelForm, I'm calling ModelForm.save(commit=False)...and the model returned (which should be the same one I passed in as 'instance' in the GET handling, remember) has somehow lost all the fields that were previously set.  The fields actually set by the form are fine; but it's no longer the original instance of my model.</p>

<p>This is not the behavior I expected; and in fact I've used this partial-model-in-modelform previously, and it works other places.  What am I missing here??</p>

<p>Hopefully some code'll make all this clear...</p>

<p>So here's the Model:</p>

<p>And here is the view function:</p>

I've got my query built but I've run into a small problem.  To return the results of my query, I can't use a BETWEEN because of the way the DB is indexed; using date ranges causes it to run too slow and the PK doesn't increment sequentially.  Instead, I have to loop through an array of values and match those to the PK.</p>

<p>Normally, for something like this against SQL server, I'd throw something like this at it:</p>

<pre><code>AND ( 
    1=1
    &lt;cfloop array=""#orderHeaderNumArray#"" index=""i""&gt;
        OR TABLENAME.S_HEADER_NUMBER LIKE '#i#%' 
    &lt;/cfloop&gt;
)
</code></pre>

<p>Every time I've tried a 1=1 against an Oracle query however, I always get a UTF-8 error.  In the past, I've just half-assed a solution by setting a known-non-existent value as a conditional, but I was wondering if #1 is this an Oracle limitation or a CF one and #2 if there was a better solution along the lines of an always true instead of an always false conditional.</p>

<p>Edit: Server is CF10, but I don't know what version of Oracle we're using.</p>

<p>But now we are finding some difficulties while testing it by QA. iOS changes many things according to it's version. We are struggling to check these changes in different versions.</p>

<p>For an example from iOS 8.3 the <code>facebook sharing</code> will have to implemented by their own SDK. The old <code>SLComposeViewController</code> is no more good. So we have to take care of it from iOS 8.3.</p>

<p>I just wondering if somehow we can get the list of these iOS versions where apple make changes, it would be easier for us to check the project installing those certain iOS version in iPhone. I think this type of information could be find in their developer site. If so any kind of information would be much helpful for us.</p>

<p>Fiddle is <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/chrisfrisina/jYnZy/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Basically they are jobs, and roles.   A job can have many roles, and I guess roles within a parent job could have overlapping start and end times, but is not necessary for this aspect.   The Jobs can, and do, overlap start and end times.   The code works by looking for the start and end times described within the HTML of the ROLES, and if there is no end time designated, then to populate the roles end time as ""CURRENT"".   Then, to populate the JOB times, it gathers all of the start times in the array <code>start</code> (var start = []) and all the end times in the array <code>end</code> (var end = []).   It then sorts <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>, and takes the first <code>start</code> index(date) for the beginning of the JOB, and the last index(date) of <code>end</code> for the JOB's end date.    Somehow the issue is in the line <code>$(this).find('&gt;h1').after($('.workexperience time.end[datetime=' + end[end.length-1] + ']').clone());
</code>, as the arrays seem to be correct.    </p>

<p>Can you help point me in the right direction of the error in my code?</p>

<p>The best I have so far is to loop through the items in $query, and for each one, compare the start date to the end date of the last item in each of the arrays. Even as I'm typing this out I'm realizing that that would assume we're starting with a $query array that's already in some sort of chronological order (it's random.) </p>

<p>We are trying to put a GANTT timeline together with this data, using as few rows as possible to help visualize what our open schedule looks like. It has me stumped. Anyone who can point to the most efficient method of organizing these objects, it'd be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Now the authentication all in all works fine but there is 0 actual functionality going on.</p>

<p>so i changed a little bit the JASON-Scheme and added the required functionality i need for initial authentication</p>

<p>as written in the documentation
<a href=""https://core.telegram.org/method/auth.sendCode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://core.telegram.org/method/auth.sendCode</a></p>

<p>Now after i've dont that, by the documentation it seems like after sending a message requesting for an SMS code i should receive  <code>auth.SentCode</code> with the hex code in the beginning of the packet <code>0xEFED51D9</code>, but instead i am receiving  as a response from the server, something of type <code>msg_container73f1f8dc</code> which doesnt seem connected what so ever to my request.</p>

<p>This all in all seems very annoying and odd, i have no clue what might cause that all in all i followed to documentation and tried to implement as requested.</p>

<p>The packet i am sending look fine, and i actually get the SmsCode to my Phone.. but the response i get is bad \ unclear for some reason.</p>

<p>I'm calling the function implemented in the JSON like this:</p>

<pre><code>auth = Session.method_call('sendCode', phone_number=PHONE_NUMBER, sms_type=0, api_id=MY_API_ID, api_hash=MY_API_HASH, lang_code=""en"")
</code></pre>

<p>so it is functioning.. but i need the 
<code>phone_code_hash</code>.  Please note that for some reason the documentation of Telegram itself is weird as well. Looking at a query example they gave, the numbers just dont match up to what the documentation say (quoted from their documentation):</p>

<p><strong>Query example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(auth.sendCode ""79991234567"" 1 32 ""test-hash"" ""en"")
=
(auth.sentCode
  phone_registered:(boolFalse)
  phone_code_hash:""2dc02d2cda9e615c84""

<p>taken from here: <a href=""https://core.telegram.org/method/auth.sendCode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://core.telegram.org/method/auth.sendCode</a></p>

<p>the expected first DWORD on each part should be different..

"25979084","1","","","2014-09-22 16:42:43","","1","789","<p>For a homework assignment, I have to take 2 user inputted strings, and figure out how many letters are common (in the same position of both strings), as well as find common letters.. For example for the two strings 'cat' and 'rat', there are 2 common letter positions (which are positions 2 and 3 in this case), and the common letters are also 2 because 'a' is found one and 't' is found once too..</p>

<p>So I made a program and it worked fine, but then my teacher updated the homework with more examples, specifically examples with repetitive letters, and my program isn't working for that.. For example, with strings 'ahahaha' and 'huhu' - there are 0 common letters in same positions, but there's 3 common letters between them (because 'h' in string 2 appears in string 1, three times..)</p>

<p>My whole issue is that I can't figure out how to count if ""h"" appears multiple times in the first string, as well as I don't know how to NOT check the SECOND 'h' in huhu because it should only count unique letters, so the overall common letter count should  be 2..</p>

<p>This is my current code:</p>

<pre><code>S1 = input(""Enter a string: "")
S2 = input(""Enter a string: "")
i = 0
big_string = 0
short_string = 0
same_letter = 0
common_letters = 0

if len(S1) &gt; len(S2):
    big_string = len(S1)
    short_string = len(S2)
elif len(S1) &lt; len(S2):
    big_string = len(S2)
    short_string = len(S1)
elif len(S1) == len(S2):
    big_string = short_string = len(S1)

while i &lt; short_string:
    if (S1[i] == S2[i]) and (S1[i] in S2):
        same_letter += 1
        common_letters += 1
    elif (S1[i] == S2[i]):
        same_letter += 1
    elif (S1[i] in S2):
        common_letters += 1
    i += 1

print(""Number of positions with the same letter: "", same_letter)
print(""Number of letters from S1 that are also in S2: "", common_letters)
</code></pre>

<p>So this code worked for strings without common letters, but when I try to use it with ""ahahaha"" and ""huhu"" I get 0 common positions (which makes sense) and 2 common letters (when it should be 3).. I figured it might work if I tried to add the following:</p>

<pre><code>while x &lt; short_string:
    if S1[i] in S2[x]:
        common_letters += 1
    else:
        pass
    x += 1
</code></pre>

<p>However this doesn't work either... </p>

<p>I am not asking for a direct answer or piece of code to do this, because I want to do it on my own, but I just need a couple of hints or ideas how to do this..</p>

<p>Note: I can't use any functions we haven't taken in class, and in class we've only done basic loops and strings..</p>

<p>The addresses table is in database for sure, because this is a migration script. I selected ""Generate Migration T-SQL.xaml (VS)"" strategy for generating database. How come the script does not address this problem?</p>

The library is written in C, and only reveals the headers but not its actual implementation.</p>

<p>The only structure I use is:</p>

<pre><code>SynsetPtr
</code></pre>

<p>And the two functions I call are:</p>

<pre><code>findtheinfo_ds

traceptrs_ds
</code></pre>

<p>Both those functions return a SynsetPtr.</p>

<p>Howevever, when the SynsetPtr represents a sense list, I have to free it using</p>

<pre><code>free_syns
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas, when the SynsetPtr is used to traverse a linked list (a hierarchical tree), I have to free it using</p>

<pre><code>free_synset
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man2.0/wnsearch.3WN.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Documentation</a> is not really clear when to call which, and why.</p>

<p>This is quickly becoming a nightmare for me. I have spent three days working my way slowly through leaks, double frees, memory allocations and such.</p>

<p>So I was wondering, is there a way for me, to wrap around those functions, or the actual Structure, and make C++ manage the memory? Ideally I would want them free'd when there are no more references to them, as is the case with std::shared_ptr.</p>

<p>Is this possible, knowing that Synset_Ptr has no destructor, but a dealloc function has to be called?</p>

<p>Alternatively, could I wrap around the two functions that create (allocate) those structures, somehow book-keep the objects, and destroy them when no references to them remain?</p>

<p>I would really appreciate any help whatsoever!</p>

<p>This is the exact declaration of SynsetPtr in wn.h</p>

<p>And that is essentially all I know.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>Even though I've used the two answers below, unfortunatelly, the functions are still leaking bytes.</p>

<p>That only seems to happen with:</p>

<pre><code>traceptrs_ds ( ptr, SIMPTR, ADJ, 0 )
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation has very little information about adjective synonyms (-synsa) or other types (-synsn, -synsv).</p>

<p>However, I managed to iterate <strong>most</strong> of them, simply by following the ptr->ptrlist &amp;&amp; ptr->nextss;</p>

<p>traceptr_ds iterates <strong>ALL</strong> of them, but I cannot find a way to avoid the leak, even when using a minified test prog.</p>

<p>Thanks to the whoever helped, very much appreciated.</p>

<pre><code> $(""#cancel"").click(function(event) {

<p>Here's the problem:
When the modal appears (by clicking another button), I click cancel and the code above is to be executed. I did this numerous times (Open modal and cancel) and the page became unresponsive. You have to wait minutes before it closes the modal after doing it for over 5 times. You can't even close the tab of the browser.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be very much welcome. Thank you.</p>

<p>Code snippet on how I create a modal:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery( ""#ex4"").dialog({
    height: 'auto',

    modal: true,
    closeOnEscape: false,

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>This is what I've done so far. I solved the DOM problem of creating too many objects by adding .remove after the close call.</p>

<pre><code> $(""#cancel"").click(function(event) {

<p>However, after closing the modal for the first time, it won't open for the second time and I got this error.
--> UPDATE: Using remove won't bring the modal back when called. I am completely confused now what to do. I need to remove those DOM elements when called by using .remove() but I need to bring them back when called. </p>

<p>I'm using spring-data-mongodb:1.7.2.RELEASE and accessing db by calling mongoOperation in my application instead of autowired a repository. Like this</p>

<p>Is it the reason why</p>

<pre><code>@ComponentScan(basePackageClasses = { RecorderRepository.class })

<p>not working?</p>

<p>How should I do to make it works? I will be grateful for any help you can provide.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I tried embedded mongodb, still got the problem that unavailable connect to database. Do I need to setup anything else? Or add annotation? </p>

<p>When click a button, it will update <em>showPanel</em> value to <em>true</em> in backend and re-render *table_panel*,
then commandButton <em>save1</em> will show up, but even if it show up, the action <em>executeAction()</em>
will never be invoked after click (never enter into my breakpoint in the method). However, the commandbutton <em>save2</em> can always act normally.</p>

<p>The only difference for those two buttons is their wrapper rich:panel, one is always there while 
another is displayed after some UI action as it has <strong>rendered=""#{bean.showPanel}""</strong> attribute. I didn't see any javascript errors on firebug.</p>

<p>Unobtrusive validation for web forms works great, <strong>but</strong>, only when validation controls are added to a form.  For other pages that lack validation controls, no reference to the JQuery file is rendered.</p>

<p>I currently use JQuery on all pages, so reference it manually in a Master page file,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I access a page with my own JQuery logic <strong>and</strong> validation controls, then two references get created (my own, plus ASP.Net's <code>ScriptResourceDefinition</code>).</p>

<p>How can I achieve one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Let <code>ScriptResourceDefinition</code> know that the file exists and has already been added?</li>
<li>Force <code>ScriptResourceDefinition</code> to render JQuery on <em>every</em> page regardless of whether it detects validation controls?</li>

I implemented a system call for this. In the userspace program, I had the following code. The value of <code>num_values</code> is obtained from command line arguments.</p>

<pre><code>int* ptr=NULL;
    ptr = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int)*num_values);

    for(loop_index=0;loop_index&lt;num_values;loop_index++)
    {

    }

<p>Then, I called my system call,</p>

<pre><code>        ret = set_wcet_val(ptr,&amp;num_values);
</code></pre>

<p>The syscall '<code>set_wcet_val</code>' implementation in the kernel is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>asmlinkage long sys_set_wcet_val(int* wcet_val, int* num_values)
{
    int retval=0, retval2=0, index, loop_index;
    int *wcet_ptr=NULL;
    retval2 = get_user(index,(int*)num_values);
    wcet_ptr = kmalloc(((sizeof(int))*index), GFP_ATOMIC);

    if (copy_from_user(wcet_ptr, wcet_val, sizeof(wcet_ptr)))

    kfree(wcet_ptr);

<p>}</p>

<p>The value '<code>num_values</code>' is properly copied to '<code>index</code>'. 
The problem is only the first two data are printed when I checked <code>dmesg</code>.
If the <code>num_values</code> is 3, I'm getting a random positive value for the third data.
If the <code>num_values</code> is 4, a random positive value for third and a negative value for fourth data.
For <code>num_values</code> > 4, all values from third data are zero.
In all cases, only the first two values are copied correctly.
What is the reason for this weird behaviour ?</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>select email from users where login = [VAR]

<p>And when you run the query the system prompts you for VAR and you can type in <code>john_smith14</code> and it executes the query. This is really useful for adhoc queries which you run a lot.</p>

Before sending command to the FTP server, I want to initialize command buffer
to zeroes - no chance to mix new command with any old characters that may be
at the end of buffer (following the new command and <code>'\0'</code>.</p>

<pre><code>//global buffers msg[1024] and cmd[16]

<p>Edit: Following is call of the function above:</p>

<p><code>sendCommand(client_socket, ""USER anonymous\r\n"", sizeof(""USER anonymous\r\n""));</code></p>

<p>The problem is: The buffer really gets empty and then filled with the command
but server cannot recognize certain commands (e.g. PASV). The problem is in the
code because if I try to comment out <code>memset(&amp;cmd, 0, sizeof(cmd));</code> I get expected
result for current command plus error 500 Unknown command for the tails of buffer <code>cmd</code></p>

<p>Here is example answer from the server:</p>

<p>I tried this above program to see how convenient it is to use <code>std::array</code> over raw arrays, I know that avoiding old-style arrays is good style and even better is to use <code>std::vector</code>.</p>

<p>I'd like to know what happens under the hood in case of <code>std::array</code>, when the function <code>getInts()</code> returns. In case of the raw arrays, I know that it's a pointer copy and the onus of cleaning it up falls on the callee. In <code>std::array</code> this doesn't happen, but how does it internally store the data and how does the copy happen?</p>

MemoryError
</code></pre>

<p>I tried running the code line-by-line in the python console and found that the error occurs after the program runs the sales = sales.drop(['STORE LOCATION'], axis=1) line.</p>

<p>I have searched for similar issues elsewhere and the only answer I have come up with is chunking the file as it is read by the program, like this:</p>

<pre><code>#import the original file
df = pd.read_csv('Iowa_Liquor_Sales7.csv', header=0, chunksize=chunksize)
sales = pd.concat(df, ignore_index=True)
</code></pre>

<p>My only problem with that is then I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""C:/Users/Aaron/PycharmProjects/DATA/Liquor_Reasign_Pd.py"", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
    lat = sales['STORE LOCATION']
TypeError: 'TextFileReader' object is not subscriptable
</code></pre>

<p>My google-foo is all foo'd out. Anyone know what to do?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I should specify that with the chunking method,the error comes about when the program tries to duplicate the store location column.</p>

<p>I can't get a UISwitch to work in the context of Core Data and detail view controllers. When you create a BOOL in core data, then have the corresponding class made in xcode, it makes an NSNumber. This is fine but instead of making ""0"" and ""1""'s when data is saved and recalled, it comes up with very large integers (7-8 digits). What I did above was to store the information as a binary string, using ""a"" or ""b"" for the string for storage. This hasn't worked well, mostly because I can't get the UISwitch to load with the previously stored value (on or off). I am sure this has been dealt with before, but I can't find much documentation online. If there are any ideas or suggestions, relative to the above code, let me know. Thanks.</p>

<p>These links lead me to believe that this feature request was never implemented but is definitely possible - I'm just wondering how.</p>

<p>One of the author's of the gem (Philip Arndt) hints, in the first link, that it may be a simple case of swapping out the existing <code>Refinery CMS</code> plugin.</p>

<p>I imagine I'm gonna need to determine that the plugin is compatible with the <code>Refinery CMS</code> I'm using and am gonna have to do a considerable amount of configuration and tweaking to get it to play nicely but I can't figure out where to start with this - what are the initial steps I have to take to at least get started?

<p>I think the ngModel in the rangeSlider Directive doesn't grab the value search.age. In the attribute model-max I've added also search.age. When I'm looking for max number 8 in my search form then it is displaying persons with the ages 8,18,38 and so on. But the result have to be 0-8. How can I solve this? I also have tried to define a function in the attribute <code>on-handle-up</code> but I don't know how to grab the item in <code>filter: search</code>.</p>

As far as I know there is the possibility to use the class cluster around <code>NSProxy</code>. But there also seem to be implementations of CORBA around with Objective-C support.</p>

<p>At a later time there may be the need to also support/include Windows machines. In that case I would need to use something like Gnustep on the Windows side (which may be an option, if it works well) or come up with a combination of both technologies. Or write something manually (which is, of course, the least desirable option).</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have experience with both technologies (Cocoa native infrastructure vs. CORBA) can you point out some key features/issues of either approach? (<strong>EDIT:</strong> As I had already pointed out in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846337/best-way-to-do-interprocess-communication-on-mac-os-x"">this thread</a> remote methods are unavailable for the iPhone and the iPad so far. On the other hand, there are CORBA implementations that work on either platform, e.g. ""<a href=""http://adorb.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">AdORB - CORBA ORB for Mac OS X and iPhone OS</a>"".)</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible to use Gnustep with Cocoa in the way explained above?
[<strong>EDIT:</strong> According to the <a href=""http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/User/GNUstep/faq_1.html#SEC7"" rel=""nofollow"">Gnustep FAQ entry 1.1.5</a> this is not possible, so using Cocoa's native infrastructure locks me into this technology.]</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible (and reasonably feasible, that is, simpler than writing a network layer manually) to communicate among all Mac OS clients using Cocoa's technology and with Windows clients through CORBA? [<strong>EDIT:</strong> From what I have learned now this is possible, but certainly not feasible. Messages would have to get forwarded both ways, i.e., one needs a ""proxy"" for forwarding messages from one system to the other and vice versa. This is essentially equivalent to writing a network layer manually with no practical benefit from either the <code>NSProxy</code> class cluster nor CORBA.]</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> CORBA seems to really be a better match when flexibility and extensibility is a concern. The downside is that it seems to be more complex to learn and also use initially, see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1226050/is-corba-legacy"">this thread</a> (link provided by Kristopher Johnson &ndash; thanks!) for different perspectives on the practical aspects. Webservices are a viable option as long as the communication pattern is simple enough, see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3152700/what-type-of-webservice-works-best-with-ios"">this thread</a> for options that work well on iOS.

<p>We do not have any implementation in .cpp files for the Handle class, it is entirely implemented in the header. I've been looking for a solution to this problem for awhile now, and looked through <em>so</em> many LNK2019 articles on SO hoping to find anything about this issue... Any assistance or insight into what could be happening is appreciated. Our game project has a lot of stuff going on in it, so if more information is needed, I will provide it.</p>

<p>Things about the project:<br>
-Statically linked, code is spread across 11 libraries.<br>
-Precompiled headers are used.</p>

<p>While trying to figure out the cause of this problem I came across the following article:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.puredarwin.org/blockers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.puredarwin.org/blockers</a></p>

<p>which claims that the cause of this problem is that the normal version of gdb doesn't work on the Darwin OS (when I do ./configure the ""system type"" comes up as i386-apple-darwin9.8.0). Is this corret, and if so, where do I get the ""Apple version"" which does work on Mac OSX? </p>

<p>Now I want to shuffle the list and I am a little stuck. The reason I want to shuffle the list is because I want the pictures to be random each time the game (memory) is loaded or button(restart) is clicked... Here is what I have for this issue:</p>

<p>I have a nginx / varnish which acts as a load balancer and cache sitting in front of my webservers. My web servers are standard apache web servers.</p>

<p>I am having problems with detecting the genuine IP address of users connecting to the system. The $_SERVER[""REMOTE_ADDR""] shows the IP address of the load balancer/cache and not of the user visiting the site.</p>

<p>We have written a hack so that with HTTP traffic we send through an X-Forwarded-For header with the correct IP address, but I have been told this is not possible with SSL.</p>

<p>Unfortunately due to strict security requirements we are not able to offload SSL onto the load balancer/cache it has to go to apache.</p>

<p>Has anyone got any ideas on how we could detect the IP address, when using SSL?</p>

<p>i managed to get rid of the error by changing my signature in the Dictionary extension:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT page_id FROM page_fan WHERE uid=me() AND page_id=""&lt;my_fan_page_id&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>I also read about a need for the <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/"" rel=""nofollow"">user_likes</a> permission that you can request from your users when they approve an app. I was concerned that I might need this permission in order to get the desired information but in my initial testing it appeared that I would not. Even though I had not requested that permission it appeared that I was pulling down the player's like information anyway.</p>

<p>Sadly a friend has an account, however, that will not provide this information to my app. Digging further, I experimented with the <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/"" rel=""nofollow"">Graph API Explorer</a> and found that when I was logged in as him and tried an even more general request about his page likes the query still returned with an empty array. That query was:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT page_id FROM page_fan WHERE uid=me()
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming then that this means there is a privacy setting in the user account settings that allows a FB user to block providing this information by default, yes? If so, which setting is this in the user security settings and does that mean the only way to guarantee this information gets pulled down is by requesting the user_likes permission? Thanks.</p>

Every time I receive a coordinate from my android device (approximately 1 every second)  I need to append the results to an existing XML file.  The output that I am looking for is shown below with the trkpt element as the repeated item.  The problem is that I can't just add the new trkpt to the end of the file because it needs to be inside the trkseg parent element.</p>

<p>So far I have tried two different APIs, SIMPLEXML and JDOM.  With SIMPLEXML I couldn't figure out how to append a child element to an existing file so I switched to JDOM.  JDOM allowed me to append the trkpt element as shown below, but as the file started growing it quickly slowed down the user interface of the program.  With JDOM I was using the SAXBuilder to reopen the file and append.  I think the issue with this was that it had to reproduce the entire file in memory before it added the new element and rewrote the file.  So the larger the file got the more demanding the operation was on the device.  I need a solution that doesn't examine/copy the entire file before writing the new data.  Is there a more efficient way to accomplish this with Java or an API for Java?  Thanks for any help!</p>

Unfortunately, the library does not support time series real-time plotting, so I went googling and found someone that had written specific classes for that (you can find it <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/pyqtgraph/JRLYNKgN8Zs/uFE05a7PWAUJ"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). I used these classes once with no problem at all, but now python instantly crashes upon call of the 'TimeSeriesPlot()' class. I tried to delete all .pyc files in the python folder and all subfolders, but that did not change anything, neither did a repair of the python install. Any ideas as to what causes the problem and how to solve it? Has anyone been confronted to that sort of problem?

<p>I have a form which it has almost 150 checkbox, but they are not in one place, the form is divided into divisions and each division has blocks, the checkboxes are put in these blocks depending on their group 
where you can find four checkbox in this place and eight in other and 30 in some other and so go on.<br />
So I made a two table’s one to store the groups and other to store checkboxes and to which group they belong to.</p>

<pre><code>FormBlocks
    --------------------------
    |  ID  |       key       |
    --------------------------
    |   1  |  property_type  |
    |   2  |    providors    |
    --------------------------

BlocksCheckBoxes
    ------------------------------------------------
    |  ID  |     Label    |   Key  |  FormBlockId  |
    ------------------------------------------------
    |   1  |  Sweet Home  |  home  |       1       |
    |   2  |     Farm     |  farm  |       1       |
    |   3  |  Invst Bank  |  bank  |       2       |
    |   4  |  Constructor | constr |       2       |
    ------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>I have two approaches to store their values: <br />
The first one store the checkbox values as concatenated string of their keys and insert it directly to the designated table, eg: <br /></p>

<pre><code>UserProperties
    ----------------------------------------
    |  ID  |  Customer  |  PropertiesType  | 
    ----------------------------------------
    |   1  |    Cat     |     home,farm    |
    ----------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p><strong>pros</strong>:Very easy to implement and all I need is just to add a column and you are ready to go, and theoretically it is faster<br />
<strong>cons</strong>: Will lose db level of data integrity and it will depend on the application level (I think I can live that) </p>

<p>The second way I create tables for each block, eg:</p>

<pre><code>UserProperties
    ---------------------
    |  ID  |  Customer  |
    ---------------------
    |   1  |    Cat     |
    ---------------------

UserPropertiesTypes
    --------------------------------------
    |  ID  |  CustomerId  |  CheckBoxId  | 
    --------------------------------------
    |   1  |       1      |       1      |
    --------------------------------------
    |   1  |       1      |       2      |
    --------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p><strong>pros</strong>: I see it as the professional way and will insure the data integrity at db level<br />
<strong>cons</strong>: I need to create table for each part that has checkbox group which is a headache in development specially if you have many groups in the form.
<br /><br />
I didn't consider bitwise because I will have to create a column for each checkbox and I see it is not efficient for big groups who will have more than 30 checkbox. so I preferred to make a way that will be implemented in the application
<br /><br />
If you have any suggestions or better way to do it please don’t hesitate to tell.
Thank you very much</p>

<p>I have two tables, <code>LOAD</code> and <code>BUS</code>.</p>

<p><code>LOAD</code> has the columns <code>IDENTIFIER, PARENT_BUS, POWER</code></p>

<p><code>BUS</code> has the colums <code>IDENTIFIER, PARENT_BUS</code></p>

<p>(This is just a simplification of the tables, but the other data is not relevant to this problem I don't think)</p>

<p>I have created a table structure that looks a little bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>BUS 0 (root bus)
  BUS 1
   -LOAD 1000
   -LOAD 1009
   BUS 101
     -LOAD 1001
     -LOAD 1002
     -LOAD 1007
   BUS 102
     -LOAD 1003
  BUS 2
   BUS 201
     -LOAD 1004
     -LOAD 1008
   BUS 202
     -LOAD 1005
     -LOAD 1006
</code></pre>

<p>There are a set of buses that link to another bus in the bus table using a foreign key from <code>BUS.PARENT_BUS</code> to <code>BUS.IDENTIFIER</code>. The loads in the load table also link via a foreign key to a bus: i.e. <code>LOAD.PARENT_BUS</code> to <code>BUS.IDENTIFIER</code>. There would typically be hundreds or even thousands of loads, connected to several dozen buses. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that it is possible for a load to attach anywhere in the bus structure, and there can be any level of buses (although I only show two levels in the example - three or more levels would be uncommon but not impossible)</p>

<p>I need to sum all of the loads at each bus level, and have this feed up to the next-higher bus. i.e. for <code>BUS 101</code> I need the sum of <code>LOAD 1001 + LOAD 1002 + LOAD 1007</code>, then for <code>BUS 1</code> I need the sum of <code>BUS 101 + BUS 102 + LOAD 1000 + LOAD 1009</code>. </p>

<p>I have tried doing this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT bus.IDENTIFIER AS ""PARENT"", bus.PARENT_BUS AS ""GRANDPARENT"", SUM(load.POWER) AS ""POWER"", level
FROM BUS_DATA bus
LEFT JOIN LOAD_DATA load
ON load.PARENT_BUS = bus.IDENTIFIER
START WITH bus.PARENT_BUS = '0' -- This is the root that all buses eventually link to
CONNECT BY PRIOR bus.IDENTIFIER = bus.PARENT_BUS
GROUP BY bus.IDENTIFIER, bus.PARENT_BUS, level;
</code></pre>

<p>And this gives me</p>

<pre><code>PARENT, GRANDPARENT, POWER, LEVEL
201     2            307.6  2
202     2            189.4  2
</code></pre>

<p>Which is correct, because with the data I used to generate this there are no loads attached to BUS 2. I also need to see a row:</p>

<pre><code>PARENT, GRANDPARENT, POWER, LEVEL
2       0            497    1
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. the sum of 201 and 202, plus any loads that might be attached directly to BUS 2. </p>

<p>What can I do to have the summed power data feed up through the bus structure to the parent bus? </p>

If I move the mouse in a slow circle, I can indefinitely prevent the window being re-painted!</p>

<p>I found that this is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644927%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#quequed_messages"" rel=""nofollow"">expected behaviour</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the exception of the WM_PAINT message, the WM_TIMER message, and
  the WM_QUIT message, the system always posts messages at the end of a
  message queue. This ensures that a window receives its input messages
  in the proper first in, first out (FIFO) sequence. The WM_PAINT
  message, the WM_TIMER message, and the WM_QUIT message, however, are
  kept in the queue and are forwarded to the window procedure only when
  the queue contains no other messages. In addition, multiple WM_PAINT
  messages for the same window are combined into a single WM_PAINT
  message, consolidating all invalid parts of the client area into a
  single area. Combining WM_PAINT messages reduces the number of times a
  window must redraw the contents of its client area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, what can I do about this? Sometimes in direct response to a mouse-move, I need to re-paint as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I catch messages through a method like this on my CWnd-derived class:</p>

<p><code>virtual LRESULT WindowProc(UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""menu""&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Then I style them like this:</p>

<p>Even though it is creating the same string, one works and other one doesn't; but neither of them work when connecting to the website. Everything we've tried ends up spitting out </p>

<p>back at the application. Since one of them works, we know it's not a memory issue or a privileges issue. We have no idea what else could be causing the problem.</p>

The thing is, I have quite a bit of experience with C++, but none in Java or Objective-C. I'm looking into using the Marmalade SDK to help my develop apps in C++. My question is, how far can you get with Marmalade? Can an app be published to the Google Play store after only using Marmalade, or will I have to use something like Eclipse (and therefore Java) to make it a usable Android app? I'd like to use as much C++ as possible. Is that what Marmalade does, allow you to write an app start to finish in C++? The many other posts ive looked at haven't been too helpful.</p>

<p>For some reason whenever the MKMapView is initiated, all my tabbars and navbars reset, ignoring the barTintColor setting of my appearance class. All other settings from UIAppearance seem to remain such as title attributes and barItem attributes. Only barTintColor goes out.</p>

<p>One more thing. This only happens on iPhone 4 and iPhone4S, not on iPhone 5. It does not happen on the simulator either. Was not an issue in iOS6 at all.</p>

<p>I can find no other cause for the reset. I went through and commented out just about all the goings on and it had no effect either way.</p>

<p>If I delete the MKMapView control, no reset of colors. If I then go on to present another, altogether different view with an MKMapView, again the colors reset.</p>

<p>I am looking for ideas of what else to check, what kind of settings or methods could possibly cause this behavior. Give me some stuff to eliminate, I am stuck.</p>

<p>Additional Info:</p>

<p>Now thinking this may be a bug. I put a line to hard code the color of the navbar to an arbitrary color in ViewDidLoad just to see what is going on.</p>

<pre><code>UINavigationBar *bar = self.navigationController.navigationBar;
[bar setBarTintColor = [UIColor GreenColor];
</code></pre>

<p>I put a break on the next line. Inspecting bar, the color seems to be set.</p>

<p>On iPhone4 or 4S, bar does not turn green. On iPhone5 and simulator, bar turns green.</p>

<p>Some more items I have discovered. The color is not changing. It appears the visibility is. Yet, reading the alpha of the color and of the bar returns 1.0 both.</p>

<p>So color is correct.</p>

<p>Translucency is yes.</p>

<p>Alpha is 1.0.</p>

<p>And yet the bar is completely clear, no color, no tint.</p>

<p>I think I will file this officially as a bug. I made a test viewController with only a MKMapview. No code, no delegate, no annotations. Presented that in place of my proper controller. The same thing happened.</p>

<p>What I need right now is a workaround. I just cannot tell what is changing. When I inspect the properties of the navigation bar, everything is correct. Tint color, translucency, bar Tint Color, alpha value. So far as I can tell, the thing should be displaying as intended.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me other properties or methods that could make the background of the navigation bar completely transparent?</p>

I have seen some work and examples in <a href=""http://chromeexperiments.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Chrome Experiments</a> and am really excited to dive in. However, whenever I'm trying to do anything remotely decent or following any tutorial that seems a little bit interesting, the sheer amount javascript that has to be put in is proving to be a huge turn off.</p>

<p>For example, if I want to do any simple svg animation, I have to manually place the co-ordinates to achieve the effects. If there were any GUI tool to work with SVG or Canvas that would produce the initial movements(i.e. If I want to move an object from A to B, I'd like to do it by hand rather than counting the pixels) then the subsequent tweaking would be a lot easier. Are there any tools that help you achieve the effects? If not, <strong>what's the standard way to draw and animate svg graphics/canvas animation today?</strong></p>

<p>I want to get the message IDs for all messages trashed by <code>user_id</code> 1, but I don't want to retrieve duplicate IDs (in the data above for example, <code>user_id</code> 1 is the sender AND recipient of <code>message_id</code> 1.

For the navigation I’m using a custom nav walker (that extends <code>Walker_Nav_Menu</code>). This all works very well and allows URLs such as:</p>

<pre><code>/mediums/print/ (showing selection of print projects)
/clients/clientA (showing selection of projects for clientA)
</code></pre>

<p>I have page templates for clients and mediums and templates taxonomy-clients.php and taxonomy-mediums.php. Ideally I would like to be able to have both those URLs and the nav continue to select an individual project through either client or medium e.g.</p>

<pre><code>/mediums/print/project-A
/clients/clientA/project-A
</code></pre>

<p>But after a very long search and searching way too many forums it seems this isn’t possible with Wordpress. Therefore I had to go with one path and chose:</p>

<pre><code>/mediums/print/project-A
</code></pre>

<p>To allow this to work and not just display all single projects post under <code>/projects/project-A</code></p>

<p>I’m adding a filter hook to 'post_type_link' which modifies the link to follow the full structure of <code>/mediums/print/project-A</code>and in the custom post type I’m using a placeholder <code>%mediums%</code> which is replaced by the relevant taxonomy term.</p>

<p>Again, this all works very well and now allows browsing by client or medium and selecting the project which then selects the full URL. </p>

<p>The problem I’m having is now the navigation doesn’t show any state for the single-projects.php template (nav is global and in the sidebar). I can see that this is most likely because although I’ve managed to get the URL and the links to work showing the full path WP and hence the walker don’t see the custom post type project as sitting below mediums/mediums-term and so doesn’t create the nav items required to show this state.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can get the walker to “see” this relationship?</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s unreasonable for users to want to selectively drill down to a project in this manner through project taxonomy and land on the project at the end of the tree rather than just jumping out to <code>/projects/project-A</code> with no reflection of the state in the navigation.</p>

<p>My issue with having an image link would mean I would not be able to put any sort of descriptive text accompanying the image, unless it was an overlay, a tooltip or it to appear just below or somewhere around the image.</p>

<p>It is very possible to achieve a similar effect I am trying to achieve with PHP (the site would be running on WP), but that may be an issue with download speeds, screen sizes.</p>

<p>So I am wondering if such an effect can be achieved using JQuery.</p>

<p>Here is a basic structure of what I am looking to do.</p>

<p>This would be how the HTML looks for each release link:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""box cover"" id=""uni-123""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""hover"" id=""page-title""&gt;This is the text&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""box cover"" id=""uni-124""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""hover"" id=""page-title-2""&gt;This is the text&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Style would get the sizing correct for the imagery...</p>

<pre><code>.box {width: 200px; height: 200px; border: 1px solid black;}
.box a {display: block; width: 200px; height: 200px; color: white;}
</code></pre>

<p>And then the JQuery would use the unique id's of each box to determine which imagery to get...</p>

<pre><code>function boxImage(){
var boxId = $('.box').attr(""id"");
var image = $('#' + boxId + ' &gt; a ').attr(""id"");
    $('#' + boxId).css({""background"":""url("" + image + "".jpg)"",""background-size"":""contain""});
}

$(document).ready(boxImage);
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the trouble I am having is that the imagery only shows up on the first instance of .box, not all of them... SO is there a way for the boxImage function to take effect on all instances rather than on just the first... and if so... HOW?</p>

The biggest problem we're facing is that we want the build agents to build all of the configurations  and platforms (ASCII and Unicode on 32 and 64 bit) to validate the changes.<br>
We could do this with one build agent and run them in sequence but that will take far to long for continuous integration, so that's not an option.</p>

<p>We could have 4 different build definitions that would build on 4 different agents, but we don't see anyway to have a gated build run 4 different build definitions on a gated build.</p>

<p>I suppose we could do it with a manual process of having the developer shelve their changes then manually kick of the 4 build agents building with the shelf set and only check in when they all succeed, however we'd much prefer a more automated process.</p>

"13113065","1","","","2012-10-28 21:12:06","","0","69","<p>I'm implementing a Java application which simulates a movie theater holding. One of the entities is a <code>Film</code>, this entity can have many <code>Genres</code> but there are obviously only a limited number of <code>Genres</code>. I'm not sure how I should implement this in Hibernate.</p>

<p>First I made an enum class <code>Genre</code> and gave the <code>Film</code> entity a <code>Set&lt;Genre&gt; genres = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that the <code>Genre</code> is stored as a <code>BLOB</code> in the database, in a table created by Hibernate called <code>film_genres</code> and I would be unable to ask for all films of a particular <code>Genre</code>. (At least in my limited experience of Hibernate).</p>

<p>Then I thought I could populate the database at startup with all possible <code>Genres</code> where the <code>Genre</code> class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Genre {
    private Integer id;
    private String name;

    private Genre() {}

    public Genre(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

    private void setId(Integer id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    private void setName(String name) {
        this.name= name;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A very basic class. But now say I want to add a <code>Genre</code> to a <code>Film</code>, I can't do:</p>

<pre><code>Film film = new Film(""The Terminal"");
film.addGenre(new Genre(""Drama""));
</code></pre>

<p>Seeing as this would create a new <code>Genre</code> object for each film that is of genre drama. Would I then have to go to the database first to fetch the <code>Genre</code> object that is of value ""Drama"" and then add that object?</p>

<p>If that's what should be done, then I would still like to use an enum like this:</p>

<pre><code>public enum GenreEnum {
    DRAMA(""Drama""),
    ADVENTURE(""Adventure""),
    ACTION(""Action""),
    ...

    private String value;

    GenreEnum(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this is that I have full control over the spelling of the initial values going into the database (the prepopulation) and the values of the enum, so I could now do this:</p>

<pre><code>Film film = new Film(""The Terminal"");
film.addGenre(GenreEnum.DRAMA);
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the <code>addGenre</code> method I could do:</p>

<pre><code>public void addGenre(GenreEnum ge) {
    Query query = session.createQuery(""from Genre g where g.name = "" + ge.getValue());
    Genre genre = (Genre)query.list().get(0);
    this.genres.add(genre);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't put the transaction code in the model, but I've just put it there for simplification. I also realize the use of concatenation is unsafe.</p>

<p>Is this a decent solution or am I missing something simpler to achieve this?</p>

I like AngularJS, especially the data binding, but it seems not to be the best fit for my needs.  I want to <em>render a complete html</em> page on the server to minimize the time until the page is visible to the user. This would also allow search engines to crawl the site. The rendered page should then be <em>made dynamic by JavaScript</em>. It should <em>communicate asynchronously</em> with the server to update the model and the view, once the page is loaded. The application should work on usual <em>desktop computers and on mobile devices</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Why not jQuery?</strong> This sounds like the jQuery approach: render html, query and manipulate the DOM. But jQuery is not centered around a model and jQuery code tends to be somewhat <a href=""http://blog.coderstats.net/todomvc-complexity/?utm_source=javascriptweekly&amp;utm_medium=email"" rel=""nofollow"">unstructured</a> and unnecessary complex.</p>

<p><strong>jQuery + AngularJS?</strong> Would it be a good idea to render a complete html page, extract a model from the DOM with jQuery and give this model to AngularJS to act on it for the rest of the time. This would allow to use the structured AngularJS approach and the nice data binding.</p>

<p><strong>Other frameworks?</strong> I've heard that <a href=""https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-twittercom"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter switched from a pure JavaScript client back to a html-first approach</a>.

Currently I am trying to do a loop to find out whether a mechanical system is switched on or not for each unique source as shown in first table below in <code>source</code> column. </p>

<p>For example I have been given the following profile which tells me what hours on a typical weekday the system is on for each of the 4 seasons.  Please note the some sources are on more than one period during a day, hence you can see stack 2 repeated for 2 periods.</p>

<p>What I am trying to achieve now is that I have created some sample dates and would like to do a loop through each unique sources and just say whether for a specific hour the system is on or off based on the information provided in <code>Profile</code> table. So far what I have done is created the following table with the codes below: </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/I3Kfx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/I3Kfx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>And the code below will create the above table: </p>

<pre><code># create dates table

lut &lt;- data.frame(all_dates = as.POSIXct(""2012-1-1"") + ((0:365) * 3600 * 24),
                  season = NA)

</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to do now is add columns to the right for each unique values in <code>Source</code> column in the <code>profile</code> table and estimate based on the following criteria weather the system was on or off for each hour in the dataset.</p>

<p>I am struggling with the programming concept of how to do similar to vlookup with multiple if conditions and paste value in the new columns. For example, for my sample data the loop should create 2 programs as the <code>Source</code> column has only 2 unique sources <code>Stack 1</code> and <code>Stack 2</code>. The tricky bit is the if statement with it that will need something like: </p>

<p>As an example the first line of the table 2 should match the value of the season column with the <code>profile</code> table and see if that hour falls within the period of that particular season when the system will be on. If it falls in within the stated period then say 'on' and if outside just say <code>off</code>. So the result should look like this 2 red font columns of the figure below: </p>

<p>An example  day in winter:

I have managed to get the unique value of the column with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>values &lt;- unique(profile$Source)
</code></pre>

<p>But now its just not working with a for loop any further.</p>

<p>I am just wondering if anyone could give me any advise on how can I do the loop to create 2 more columns with the unique sources in table 2? </p>

<p>I have web service that takes its inputs through a REST interface.  The REST call does not return any meaningful data, so whatever is passed in to the web service is just recorded in the database and that is it.  It is an analytics service which my company is using internally to do some special processing on web requests that are received on their web page.  So it is very important the response take as little time to return as possible.</p>

<p>I have pretty much optimized the code down as much as possible, to make the response as fast as possible.  However, the time the database stays open still keeps the connection open for longer than I want before a response is sent back to the web client.  </p>

<p>The code looks basically like this, by the way it is ASP.NET MVC, using Entity Framework, running on IIS 7, if that matters.</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Add(/*..bunch of parameters..*/) {

    using (var db = new Entities()) {
        var log = new Log {
            // populate Log from parameters
        }
        db.AddToLogs(log);
        db.SaveChanges();
    }

    return File(pixelImage, ""image/gif"");
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>Is there a way to off load the database insert in to another process, so the response to the client is returned almost instantly?  </p>

<p>I was thinking about wrapping everything in the <code>using</code> block in another thread, to make the database insert asynchronous, but didn't know if that was the best way to free up the response back to the client.</p>

<p>What would you recommend if you were trying to accomplish this goal?</p>

<p>the method chosen was to use CSS media queries.</p>

<p>my problem is this: when I use the following code</p>

<pre><code>@media screen
and (min-width: 200px)
and (max-width: 800px)
{
    #example
    {
        background: purple;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>this works when I resize the window on my PC, but is not recognised by my phone whose resolution is within the limits.</p>

<p>perhaps more perculiarly, when I use the following code</p>

<pre><code>@media screen
and (min-device-width: 200px)
and (max-device-width: 800px)
{
    #example
    {
        background: purple;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>this has the inverse effect: displays on phone, but not on PC.</p>

<p>as far as I have read there is no scope for an ""OR"" operator for something along the lines of the following to be valid</p>

<pre><code>@media screen
and (
        ((min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 800px))

        | / || / OR

        ((min-device-width: 200px) and (max-device-width: 800px))
    )
{
    #example
    {
        background: purple;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>so my question is this: is there a way test responsive CSS on both desktop and phone simultaneously?</p>

<p>I have tried so many combinations:
using <code>@media only screen</code>,
using Android, Firefox and Chrome browsers on the phone, 
but to no avail, the result is always the same.</p>

<p>The only way I can think to do this at the moment is to create two separate stylesheets, one for desktop and one for phone, but this would mean updating two stylesheets every time I wanted to view changes in the browser, which is impractical and counters the idea of responsiveness.</p>

<p>I looked into using the <code>orientation: landscape/portrait</code> target, but as far as I can make out this would again involve writing two sets of CSS.</p>

<p>One last consideration is that the website is currently using pure CSS; so no javascript, user-agent determination nor server-side scripting at this point in time.</p>

<p>This must be possible so any insights will be appreciated. I'm sure someone will have had the same problem and enlighten me.</p>

            {
                name: 'Greg',
                children: {...}
            },
            {
                name: 'Jane',

    }

</code></pre>

<p>So the first column should show ""David"" and ""Mary"". If ""David"" is selected, the next column should show ""Sarah"" and ""Kevin"", and so on.</p>

<p>My current implementation relies on a custom method I created that is supposed to translate the browser's index path into the corresponding NSArray level from the provided data. This method looks like:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSArray *)getSelectionInBrowser:(NSBrowser *)browser
{
    NSArray *selection = browserData;
    NSIndexPath *path = [browser selectionIndexPath];
    for (NSUInteger i = 0; i &lt; path.length; i++) {
        selection = [[selection objectAtIndex:i] objectForKey:@""children""];
    }
    return selection;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My implementation of the required NSBrowserDelegate protocol methods looks like:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)browser:(NSBrowser *)sender numberOfRowsInColumn:(NSInteger)column
{
    return [[self getSelectionInBrowser:sender] count];
}

- (NSInteger)browser:(NSBrowser *)browser numberOfChildrenOfItem:(id)item {
    return [[self getSelectionInBrowser:browser] count];
}

- (id)browser:(NSBrowser *)browser child:(NSInteger)index ofItem:(id)item {
    return [self getSelectionInBrowser:browser];
}

- (BOOL)browser:(NSBrowser *)browser isLeafItem:(id)item {
    return ![item isKindOfClass:[NSMutableArray class]];
}

- (id)browser:(NSBrowser *)browser objectValueForItem:(id)item {
    return nil;
}

- (void)browser:(NSBrowser *)browser willDisplayCell:(NSBrowserCell *)cell atRow:(NSInteger)row column:(NSInteger)column {
    NSArray *selection = [self getSelectionInBrowser:browser];
    cell.title = [[selection objectAtIndex:row] objectForKey:@""name""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first column of the NSBrowser is populated with the correct names. However, as soon as I make a selection the program crashes with the error <code>-[__NSArrayM objectAtIndex:]: index 4 beyond bounds [0 .. 0]</code>. After doing some debugging, the line of code it crashes on is the <code>objectAtIndex:</code> call in my custom <code>getSelectionInBrowser:</code>.</p>

<p>That doesn't fully surprise me because even before the crash I figured I was doing something wrong by relying on that custom method to retrieve the current selection. I imagine this work should be done within the delegate methods themselves and, when  implemented correctly, the current selection should be accessible in the <code>item</code> variable that is provided in many of those methods. However, I couldn't get that to work. The <code>item</code> variable always seemed to be simply the root data object rather than reflecting the most ""drilled-down"" selection.</p>

<p>So how do I correct my implementation?</p>

"13439218","1","13440305","","2012-11-18 10:13:12","","2","134","<p>I would like to build a regexp in Emacs for cleaning up my R code.</p>

<p>One of the problems I ran into was that there are different types of comments:
You have those with a certain amount of whitespace (1), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>        # This is a comment:
# This is also a comment
</code></pre>

<p>or you have situations like this (2):</p>

<pre><code>require(lattice) # executable while the comment is informative
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that I want to align the comments when they are of the second kind (after something that's executable), while excluding those of the first kind.</p>

<p>Ideally, it will align all the comments BETWEEN those of the first kind, but not those of the first kind.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>funfun &lt;- function(a, b) {
# This is a function
    if (a == b) { # if a equals b
      c &lt;- 1 # c is 1 
    }
  }  
#
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>funfun &lt;- function(a, b) {
# This is a function
    if (a == b) { # if a equals b
      c &lt;- 1      # c is 1 
    }
  }  
# 
</code></pre>

<p>I found a regexp to do a replacement for those of the first kind, so then I was able to align them per paragraph (mark-paragraph). That worked kind of well.</p>

<p>Problem is then the backsubstitution:</p>

<pre><code>(replace-regexp ""^\\s-+#+"" ""bla"" nil (point-min) (point-max))
</code></pre>

<p>This replaces from the start of a line, with any amount of whitespace and any amount of comment characters like:</p>

<pre><code>     #########   
</code></pre>

<p>into</p>

<pre><code>     bla
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I would like to replace them back into what they are originally, so ""bla"" has to go back into the same amount of whitespace and same amount of #. </p>

<p>Hopefully someone understands what I am trying to do and has either a better idea for an approach or knows how to solve this regexp part.</p>

To check whether a process has been completed(terminated) my professor <strong>needs me to use waitpid()</strong> to do this.</p>

<p>I don't know how this can be done because if i loop through all the processes i've created in the background(a bunch of sleep()'s) and i check each process by checking if waitpid() with each process's id as an argument to waitpid() and it return something other than -1(not an error), then each process will jump to the foreground when i really just want to know if that process is terminated or not.</p>

<p>Professor's original question:</p>

<p>BACKJOBS: A command that prints a list of background jobs and their current status. This feature is similar to the jobs command when using tcsh. The current status (i.e., in progress or completed) of each job can be determined by using the waitpid system call (see man waitpid for more information).

If so then <strong>is there a comparable idea that I can bridge off of in C# that makes sense?</strong><br /><br />
<strong>Edit</strong><br />
Okay so I'm apparently way off. So as second part of the 2 part question, is there anything conceptually comparable in C#? To be clear I'm looking for a concept in C# that is comparable to Autovivification. Doesn't have to be exactly the same but close enough conceptually to make sense. And as I stated eariler I am by no means a perl hacker or python hacker by any stretch of the imagination but, I am familar with c based languages C, C++, C#, java, javascript. I was thinking of C#'s dynamics but, as of right now I'm thinking lazy loading based on the info here if that helps....</p>

The algorithm builds non-increasing sequences of integers that sum to the given value N.</p>

<p>The solution works recursively  and proceeds as follows</p>

<pre><code>try all 1s as a solution
try to increment the last value and see if that sums to N in a non-increasing sequence
  if not, discard this value and try to increment the previous one (always checking for non-increasing sequence)

<p>I don't think master theorem can help here since recursions have a variable number of calls. I believe this algorithm computes N times a series of 1s then backtracks if incrementing the last value doesn't fit (passing through the array 2N times) for a total of O(N*2N) = O(N^2) but this is a rough estimate.</p>

<p>The issue is that i can't overwrite, or even delete some of the dll files which are the core of the application, these dll files are used by the service i uninstalled first.</p>

<p>I use the following method to pass in the new file-path in order to replace the old DLL which is located inside the root directory of the application in <code>C:\Program Files\AppName\</code></p>

<blockquote>

    var f2 = new FileIOPermission(FileIOPermissionAccess.AllAccess, oldFile);
    f2.AddPathList(FileIOPermissionAccess.Write | FileIOPermissionAccess.Read, newFile);

    try
    {
        f2.Demand();
    }
    catch (SecurityException s)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(s.Message);

<p>I just wish to provide a new file and remove the old one, replace it, overwrite it.... The application </p>

<p>I have not found where my logic is incorrect in Query C.  Query C is adding an incorrect record not found by either A or B and duplicating entries in a couple of cases.  </p>

<p>I would like some pointers on where my logic on combining the 2 went astray.</p>

<p>I fixed the commas in this post, the actual queries did have them.</p>

<p>My intent is to list all users that have been enrolled into a course but within a given timeframe, have not logged into the system, accessed the course and finally have not completed the activity in the course.</p>

<p>So the logic I am looking for is:
If the user has not logged in within 60 days - display name
If logged in but has not accessed the course within 60 days - display name
If logged in and has accessed the course but has not completed the course activity- display name</p>

<p>Query A does list all users that started the activity but have not completed within 60 days
Query B does list all users that have not logged in or accessed the course within 60 days</p>

<p>In trying to combine the 2 queries to satisfy all 3 conditions is where I am having problems.  I first tried a UNION but could not get it to work.</p>

<p>In my program, I retrieve records of search results from database using a java class and put them into a ArrayList and returns ArrayList to Servlet. Then assigns the received ArrayList object into an application attribute like this</p>

<pre><code>request.setAttribute(""Results"", results_List);
</code></pre>

<p>then using request dispatcher, i'm loading my result showing jsp page like this.</p>

<pre><code>RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher(""searchresults.jsp"");
rd.forward(request, response);
</code></pre>

<p>so tell me the next step to do pagination my search reslts..</p>

<p>I can recreate this problem consistently doing these three steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the .NET Form</li>
<li>Initalize the WaitWindow COM object, call ShowWindow on the COM object while passing the .NET Forms Handle</li>
<li>In VB6 invoke the SetWindowLong method</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>C# Windows Application (Hangs)</strong></p>

<pre><code>private static void Main(string[] args)
{
      Form form = new Form();
      form.Show();

      Interop.WaitWindow waitWindow = new Interop.WaitWindow();
      waitWindow.ShowWindow(form.Handle.ToInt32(), Language.RISEnglish);

    myForm.Show (vbModal)
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Really would appreciate your help :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I do understand that SetWIndowLong shouldn't be called to change the parent but I'm trying to understand why it hangs only when a .NET form handle is used.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong></p>

<p>I now believe the issue is not related to SetWindowLong but the actual handle itself.  I'm still investigating but it appears that when I call the VB6 code from .NET it creates an RPC thread.  I'm not sure yet but I have a feeling it has something to do with a cross-threading issue.</p>

<p>My current need is to have separate Git repositories each containing a .Net solution file with related projects. One or more of those repositories will contain only class libraries and I need to use those libraries inside other repositories solutions.</p>

<p>My first though was to use Git Submodules to avoid ugly copy-paste and still have the source code of the class libraries available when developing the applications.</p>

<p>So my attempt was to include the submodule, then in my current Solution do ""add existing project"" and load the desired class library(ies).</p>

<p>The huge problem I've been unable to overcome is Nuget package restore. The imported projects reference libraries in ""..\Packages*"" but when imported as submodule they are located in an additional subfolder so they can't find the required dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>- MySolution.sln
- Packages folder
- MyAppProject folder
- Submodule folder
-- EXPECTED packages folder for MyLibraryProject that I cannot generate
-- MyLibraryProject folder
</code></pre>

<p>One solution I found and tried was <a href=""http://www.cazzulino.com/ultimate-cross-platform-nuget-restore.html"">this</a> but it has two major problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's supposed to work using MsBuild package restore and I absolutely don't want to use it</li>
<li>Even trying to use MsBuild package restore it didn't work at all, I still have a single Packages folder in my current solution folder. Maybe I did something wrong but again, I don't want to use MsBuild approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I'd really like to know if there's a clean way to solve this problem, or if the only thing I can do is to give up having libraries source code available in my application solutions and publish my libraries on a private NuGet feed and reference them from there.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

Now the title has a link to a page but not the box. I tried many thing (eg: applying ""display:inline-block;"" to the css (...)) but still no link was applyed. The point is for each box to have the same link has the title it contains. Also I can't seem to change the Title (""open"") and the images have a lot of white space between them vertically. Anyone has any idea how to fix this?</p>

I'm trying to make a 3D transformation of HTML elements, transformed with CSS3, a bit like <a href=""http://www.mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/threejs/css3d/periodictable/"" rel=""nofollow"">Three.js's CSS3d demo</a>, but simpler.</p>

<p>To do so, I detect the 3d  transformation of tags, given in the form of a 4x4 matrix. For each transformation, I create a <code>.tag</code> div containing a simple text and a background, which I transform using CSS' transform:matrix3d(...) directive.</p>

<p>All these <code>.tag</code> divs are contained in a <code>#camera</code> div, which is supposed to apply the projection transform. This is where I am stuck. I do not manage to find a transform:matrix3d(...); that makes the <code>.tag</code> divs overlap exactly the barcodes in the image.</p>

<p>So far, my closest result is with a
<code>
  1   0 0 0
  0   1 0 0
  0   0 1 0
320 240 0 1
</code>
projection matrix that translates the tag divs, but does not take their depth into account. The result is shown in this <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Udqu5/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsFiddle</a>, where I hard coded the transformation matrices of the tags in the background sample snapshot.</p>

<p>I also tried with a projection matrix used to draw the tags in other demo with three.js. This matrix is a regular perspective transform, but it does not seem to work at all here. This matrix is the one commented out in the CSS.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate if someone could help me find a way to match the <code>.tag</code> divs on the tags on the image, i.e. cover the barcodes with the purple quadrilaterals in the jsFiddle.</p>

"9074577","1","","","2012-01-31 04:52:38","","1","537","<p>I'm writing custom firmware for a SparkFun Logomatic V2 that records binary data to a file on a 2GB micro-SD card.  The data file size will range from 100 MB to 1 GB.</p>

<p>The format of the binary data is in flux as the board's firmware evolves (it will actually be dynamically reconfigurable at run-time).  Rather than create and maintain a separate decoder/converter program for each version of firmware/configuration, I'd much rather make the data files self-converting to CSV format by starting the data file with a Bash script that is written to the data file before data recording starts.</p>

<p>I know how to create a Here Document, but I suspect Bash would be unable to quickly parse and convert a gigabyte of binary data, so I'd like to make the process run much faster by having the script first compile some C code (assume GCC is present and in the path), then run the resulting program, passing the binary data to stdin.</p>

<p>To make the problem more concrete, assume the firmware will create binary data consisting of 4 16-bit integer values: A timestamp (unsigned) followed by 3 accelerometer axes (signed).  There is no separator between records (mainly because I'm saturating the SPI interface to the uSD card).</p>

<p>So, I think I need a script with TWO here documents: One for the C code (parameterized by expanded Bash variables), and another for the binary data.  Here's where I am so far:</p>

<pre><code>#! env bash
# Produced by firmware version 0.0.0.0.0.1 alpha
# Configuration for this data run:
header_string = ""Time, X, Y, Z""
column_count = 4
# Create the converter executable
# Use ""&lt;&lt;-"" to permit code to be indented for readability.
# Allow variable expansion/substitution.
gcc -xc /tmp/convertit - &lt;&lt;-THE_C_CODE
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int main (int argc, char **argv) {
        // Write ${header_string} to stdout
        while (1) {
            // Read $(column_count} shorts from stdin
            // Break if EOF
            // Write $(column_count} comma-delimited values to stdout
        }
        // Close stdout
        return 0;
    }
THE_C_CODE
# Pass the binary data to the converter
# Hard-quote the Here tag to prevent subsequent expansion/substitution
/tmp/convertit &gt;./$1.csv &lt;&lt;'THE_BINARY_DATA'
...
... hundreds of megabytes of semi-random data ...
...
THE_BINARY_DATA
rm /tmp/convertit
exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>Does that look about right?  I don't yet have a real data file to test this with, but I wanted to verify the idea before going much further.</p>

<p>Will Bash complain if the closing lines are missing? This may happen if data capture terminates unexpectedly due to a shock knocking loose the battery or uSD card.  Or if the firmware borks.</p>

<p>Is there a faster or better method I should consider?  For example, I wonder if Bash will be too slow to copy the binary data as fast as the C program can consume it: Should the C program open the data file directly?</p>

<p>TIA,</p>

<p>The logic is the following one: A contact can't exists outside a workspace (means that the workspace owns the contact).
A user has a workspace, and it places the 'owned contacts' in it (owned contact = the contact information describes the users such as profession, name, address, etc).
Also a user workspace can hold a reference to contacts owned by other users (here comes the join table which stores the relation between a workspace and the referenced contacts).</p>

<pre><code>public WorkspaceMap()
{
    ....
    HasMany(w =&gt; w.ReferencedContacts).WithMany().Map(mp =&gt;
    {
        mp.ToTable(""WorkspaceReferencedContacts"");
        mp.MapLeftKey(""WorkspaceId"");
        mp.MapRightKey(""ContactId"");
        });
}

public ContactMap()
{
    ......
    HasRequired(c =&gt; c.Workspace).WithMany(w =&gt; w.OwnedContacts).HasForeignKey(c =&gt;   c.WorkspaceId).WillCascadeOnDelete(false);
    Property(c =&gt; c.WorkspaceId).HasColumnName(""WorkpaceId"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to do is to get all referenced contacts for a specific workspace using query methods. The SQL version of the query would be the following one:</p>

<p>SELECT * FROM dbo.Contacts c
INNER JOIN dbo.WorkspaceReferencedContacts wc ON wc.ContactId = c.ContactId
WHERE wc.WorkspaceId = '57F685C0-428C-44C3-8708-F30B5AF34CAE';</p>

I recently undertook a project that involves a complex object structure with multiple levels of prototypical inheritance and sub objects. This structure needs to be periodically saved / loaded. Saving and loading in JSON is desirable.</p>

<h1>The Question</h1>

<p>Is there a more elegant way of accomplishing the task of saving/loading these complex Javascript objects than my current method (outlined below)? Is it possible to design it in such a way where the constructors can initialize themselves as if they were normal objects without being bound by all of the restoring functionality?</p>

<h1>My Solution</h1>

<p>The base 'class' (from which, by design, all other objects under consideration inherit protoypically) has a function which processes an 'options' argument, adding all of it's properties to the current object. All deriving objects <em>must</em> include an options argument as the last argument and call the processing function in their constructor.</p>

<p>Each object also <em>must</em> add it's function name to a specific property so that the correct constructor function can be called when the object needs to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>An unpack function takes the saved object JSON, creates a plain object with JSON.parse and then passes that object in as the 'options' argument to the object's constructor.</p>

<p>Each object is given a unique id and stored in a lookup table, so that a function under construction with links to other objects can point to the right ones, or create them if it needs to.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/yzdygB8cMVWGO5lk7Mqw?p=info"" rel=""nofollow"">plunker</a> which demonstrates the idea (obviously in a non-Node way).</p>

<p>If you don't want to load the plunker, here's an excerpt which should hopefully provide the gist of what I'm trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>function BaseClass(name, locale, options){
  if(name) this.name = name;
  if(locale) this.locale = locale;

  // If options are defined, apply them
  this.processOptions(options);

  // create the classList array which keeps track of
  // the object's prototype chain
  this._classList = [arguments.callee.name];

  // Create a unique id for the object and add it to
  // the lookup table
  if(!this.id) this.id = numEntities++;
  lookupTable[this.id] = this;

  if(!this.relations) this.relations = [];

  // other initialization stuff
}

BaseClass.prototype = {
  processOptions: function(options) {
    if(options &amp;&amp; !options._processed){
            for(var key in options){
                if(options.hasOwnProperty(key)){
                    this[key] = options[key];
                }
            }
            options._processed = true;
        }
  },
  addNewRelation: function(otherObj){
    this.relations.push(otherObj.id);
  }

  // Other functions and such for the base object
}

function DerivedClassA(name, locale, age, options){
  if(age) this.age = age;

  this.processOptions(options);

  if(options &amp;&amp; options.connectedObj){

    // Get the sub object if it already exists
    if(lookupTable[options.subObj.id]){
      this.subObj = lookupTable[options.subObj.id];
    }
    // Otherwise, create it from the options
    else {
      this.subObj = new OtherDerivedClass(options.subObj);
    }
  }
  else {
    // If no options then construct as normal
    this.subObj = new OtherDerivedClass();
  }

  // If something needs to be done before calling the super
  // constructor, It's done here.

  BaseClass.call(this, name, locale, options);
  this._classList.push(arguments.callee.name);

}

DerivedClassA.prototype = Object.create(BaseClass.prototype);
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned, this gets the job done, but I can't help but feeling like this could be much better. It seems to impose a ridiculous amount of restrictions on the inheriting 'classes' and how their constructors must behave. It makes a specific order of execution critical, and requires that each object be deeply involved and aware of the restoration process, which is far from ideal.</p>

</ul>

<p>So, a <strong>Node has many Blocks</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, a Block has a Generic Foreign Key that could point to one of these models: <code>CharBlock</code>, <code>TextBlock</code>, <code>ImageBlock</code>, <code>NumberBlock</code>. That is because a <code>Block</code> can hold various types of information, depending on what the parent <code>Node</code> should look like.</p>

<p><strong><em>My question</strong>: How can I edit the <code>content</code> field of the <code>CharBlock/TextBlock/ImageBlock/NumberBlock</code> inside of the <code>Add Node</code> admin page? I like the default Django Admin, so I don't want to build another admin from scratch.</em></p>

<p>These are my models, for reference:</p>

<p>Th <code>Node</code> Model:</p>

<pre><code>class Node(models.Model):
    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User)
</code></pre>

<p>Th <code>Block</code> Model:</p>

<pre><code>class Block(models.Model):
    node = models.ForeignKey(Node)

    # Generic Foreign Key
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey()
</code></pre>

<p>The other Models:</p>

<pre><code>class CharBlock(models.Model):
    content = models.CharField(max_length=500)

class TextBlock(models.Model):
    content = models.TextField()

class ImageBlock(models.Model):
    content = models.ImageField(upload_to='media', blank=True)

class NumberBlock(models.Model):
    content = models.IntegerField(blank=True)
</code></pre>

<p>And the Admin classes:</p>

<pre><code>class BlockInline(GenericTabularInline):
    model = Block
    extra = 2 
    ct_field_name = 'content_type'
    id_field_name = 'object_id'

class NodeAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    model = Node
    inlines = (BlockInline,)
</code></pre>

<p>I am learning OOP PHP, but some things are really confusing. I have a general idea of where to use static methods, but I'm not sure if here it's a good idea.</p>

<p>My questions is about which is actually the best approach for the specific problem I am facing (described below). The general guidelines I've found online didn't help for this specific problem. Here is what I thought (from more likely to be correct to less):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Extend the Language class, create a single object (that gets the language in the initialization) and call a method with the $id that would return the translated string.</p></li>
<li><p>Merge both classes into one. The language would be found when initialized and a method called when needed. But it would behave a little as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object"" rel=""nofollow"">God object</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the Language class static. Therefore I would be able to use it from within the Text. I would create a Text instance and call a method with different $id. Similar to using it with globals. There's almost no other place where I'd need to use the Language class.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend the Language class with Text, create an object for each translation. This would probably create too much overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>Not do anything. It's tempting (don't fix it if it's not broken), but I intend to start developing with someone else soon, so clean and clear code is needed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Now the simple class:</p>

<pre><code>class Language
  {
  public $Lang;
  public function __construct()
    {
    if ( !empty($_POST['lang']) )    // If the user tries to change the language
      {
      $this-&gt;Lang = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['lang']);  // Assign the language to variable.
      $_SESSION['lang'] = $this-&gt;Lang;      //Sets the session to have that language.
      if ($_SESSION['logged']==1)          // If user is logged
        {
        $User=$_SESSION['user'];
        mysql_query(""UPDATE users SET lang='$this-&gt;Lang' WHERE email='$User'"") or die(mysql_error());  // Saves the language into user preferences
        }
      }
    else      // If no request is done.
      {
      if ($_SESSION['logged']==1)    // DO. Check for user's language
        {
        $User=mysql_real_escape_string($_SESSION['user']);
        $result=mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='$User'"");
        $row=mysql_fetch_array($result);
        $this-&gt;Lang=$row['lang'];
        }
      else
        if ( !empty ($_SESSION['lang']))  // If the session exists (not empty)
          $this-&gt;Lang = $_SESSION['lang'];  // Assign the session language to variable.
        else          // If it doesn't exist
          $this-&gt;Lang = substr ($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'], 0, 2);  // Get it from the browser
      }
    //If the language is not supported (or still doesn't exist), then put ""en"" as default. Supported so far: en, es.
    if ( $this-&gt;Lang !== ""en"" &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;Lang !== ""es"") $this-&gt;Lang=""en"";
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>I have few methods inside this class, but that's the only relevan code here. So I initialize it with <code>$Language=new Language;</code> and then use <code>$Language-&gt;Lang;</code> to obtain the user language. So far so good.</p>

<p>This is the function I want to reconvert to a class. It gets an integer or a string, searches it as an id with mysql and returns a translated string in the right language. Now, how do I achieve this? Here it's the text() function. It was used with globals, which is apparently a really bad practice.</p>

<pre><code>function text($Id)
    {
    // Already defined and tested that are valid (sql injection avoided also)
    global $Lang;
    global $Url;
    global $Version;
    global $Banner;
    if (!empty($Url[""folder""])) $FullUrl = ""/"".$Url[""folder""].""/"";
      else $FullUrl=""/"";
    if (!is_int($Id)) $Id = mysql_real_escape_string( $Id );

    $numargs = func_num_args();  // Get the number of arguments that are being passed.
    if ($numargs == 2)  // If there are actually two
      $Var=func_get_arg(1);  // Set $Var with the second value (1).

    if (is_int($Id))  // If a number is being passed
      {
        // Add AND page='$FullUrl' to control scope of the strings translated
      $results = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM translations WHERE id='$Id'"") or die ('Could not query:' . mysql_error());
      $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($results);
      if (!empty($row[$Lang]) &amp;&amp; !isset($Var)) echo stripslashes($row[$Lang]);  // If there is some, echo it
        elseif ($Var==1) return stripslashes($row[$Lang]); // If it is required to be a returned string, send it.
      else error($FullUrl,$Lang);  // If there is nothing there, calls error function.
      }
    else  // If a string is being passed
      {
      $results = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM htranslations WHERE keyword='$Id'"") or die ('Could not query:' . mysql_error());
      $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($results);

      if (!empty($row[$Lang]) &amp;&amp; !isset($Var)) echo stripslashes($row[$Lang]);  // If it exists in the table, echo it
      elseif (!empty($row[$Lang]) &amp;&amp; isset($Var)) return stripslashes($row[$Lang]);
      else  // Else (it doesn't exist)
        {
        $Id = str_replace(""_"", "" "", $Id);  // Replace the ""_"" with "" ""
        if (!isset($Var))
          {
          echo $Id;  // Echo the passed string with spaces
          }
        else return $Id;

        $Banner=""There might be some misstranslation. Please report if needed."";
        }
      }
    }

<p>The Method i am using returns a XML string - so far so good.</p>

<p>The problem now is: 
The XML returned can have a lot of different structures and there is no way to find out which one is returned. No XSD or anything else available....</p>

<p>Example Pseudo Code:</p>

<pre><code>string XmlFileContent = WebService.MethodGetXMLFile(filekey)

<p>The XmlFileContent can e.g. look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;XML&gt;
&lt;Field1&gt;sometext&lt;/Field1&gt;

<pre><code>&lt;Table Date =""20150302"" Time = ""0946""&gt;

&lt;Field1&gt;sometext&lt;/Field1&gt;
&lt;Field2&gt;2341.5145&lt;/Field2&gt;
&lt;/Row&gt;
&lt;/Table&gt;

<p>or any kind of XML you can think of...</p>

<p>So the question is: are there any possibilities or tools to display this XML Content in an acceptable way? Formatting can be ignored, i just want to display the Data in a better way than showing the plain XML Text.</p>

<p>The Client which works with the WebService is written in C# (.NET 4.5), the technology for displaying the XML Data doesn't matter - anything that helps is perfekt. (Maybe HTML or kind of that!?)</p>

<p>It is simple console application. 
To run it, replace filename variable content with path to any .jpg file without metadata (or use <a href=""http://lr.gameimg.ru/gnom4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">mine</a>).</p>

<p>First there is a dispatch routine from a file called ""disp_pentium4.inc"". It checks if the variable <code>___use_sse2_mathfcns</code> has been set; if so, calls <code>__sin_pentium4</code>, otherwise calls <code>__sin_default</code>.</p>

<p><code>__sin_pentium4</code> (in ""sin_pentium4.asm"") starts by transferring the argument from the x87 fpu to the xmm0 register, performs the calculation using SSE2 instructions, and loads the result back in the fpu.</p>

<p><code>__sin_default</code> (in ""sin.asm"") keeps the variable on the x87 stack and simply calls <code>fsin</code>.</p>

<p>So in both cases, the operand is pushed on the x87 stack and returned on it as well, making it transparent to the caller, but if <code>___use_sse2_mathfcns</code> is defined, the operation is actually performed in SSE2 rather than x87.</p>

<p>This behavior is very interesting to me because the x87 transcendental functions are notorious for having slightly different behaviors depending on the implementation, whereas a given piece of SSE2 code should always give reproducible results.</p>

<p>Is there a way to determine for certain, either at compile or run-time, that the SSE2 code path will be used? I am not proficient writing assembly, so if this involves writing any assembly, a code example would be appreciated.</p>

<p>But when I trimmed the file name to 120, it worked.</p>

<p>I wanted to know if there is any limitation in the filename length for OLE file. 
Since I tried it for different application files( doc,docx,txt,pdf...). The results varied for different files. </p>

This works well flor low numbers of queries (&lt;10queries @ 60fps) but does not scale as more are performed per data frame (100queries @ 6fps).</p>

<p>I would have expected modern GPUs to be able to chew through 20 million points (200k * 100 queries) points from 100 draw calls without breaking a sweat; especially since each <code>glDrawArrays</code> uses the same VBO.</p>

<p>A 'spatial query' consists of setting some uniforms and a <code>glDrawArrays</code> call. The geom shader then chooses to emit or not emit a vertex based on the result of the query. I have tried with / without branching and it makes no difference. The VBO used is separated attributes, one is <code>STATIC_DRAW</code> and other is <code>DYNAMIC_DRAW</code> (updated before each batch frame of spatial queries). Transform feedback then collects the data. </p>

<p>Profiling shows that <code>glGetQueryObject</code> is by far the slowest call (probably blocking, 5600 inclusive samples compared to 127 from <code>glDrawArrys</code>) but I'm not sure how to improve this. I tried making lots of little result buffers in GPU memory and binding a new transform feedback buffer for each query, but this had no effect - perhaps due to running on a single core? The other option would be to read the video memory from the previous query from another thread, but this throws an <code>Access Violation</code> and I'm unsure if the gains would be that significant.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how to improve performance?  Am I missing something obvious like a debug mode that needs switching off?</p>

<p>Now on click of the button ViewMore i wrote this code to extract listviewItem's value:</p>

<pre><code>var id = ((Label)e.Item.FindControl(""lblBookingId"")).Text;
var name = ((Label)e.Item.FindControl(""lblLoadTypeName"")).Text;
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>e.Item.FindControl(""lblBookingId"")</code> always comes null. I checked the page's html by using inspect element of chrome, and i was shocked to see that my id somehow got changed to <code>ContentSection_ctl00_lblLoadTypeName_0</code></p>

<p>I am really stuck at this. Please help me. Thanx in Advance</p>

<p>but the result is still the same, there are blank spaces in front of each text in first column, but no image shown.</p>

<p><em>LAST EDITED</em></p>

<p>Finally I've got it, it's my fault, the problem is not in this path of code, in other path of code there's creating new ImageList which I've forget to comment it out before test, this code work properly, THANKS everyone for the answer.</p>

When I use class creation wizard in VS2013 it would create me .h and .cpp files with defined class basis.</p>

<p>Example header file:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma once

class SomeClass
{
public:
    SomeClass();
    ~SomeClass();
};
</code></pre>

<p>Then I added some usings. I've included headers with these namespaces in stdafx. std and sf from SFML are used in my app:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma once

using namespace std;
using namespace sf;

class SomeClass
{
public:
    SomeClass();
    ~SomeClass();
};
</code></pre>

<p>And everything works fine. stdafx.h is not included in header file, only in .cpp.</p>

<p>But then I'll go with manual creation of header file(without .cpp) using same class structure:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma once

using namespace std;
using namespace sf;

class SomeOtherClass
{
     public:
        SomeOtherClass();
        ~SomeOtherClass();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And it doesn't work. VS says that it can't find ""sf"" namespace, but there are no problems with ""std"" namespace.</p>

<p>And that's the thing which I want to know: why first case is valid and VS have found namespaces from precompiled headers and second case doesn't work.</p>

<p>In Adobe Illustrator I have created the following 'button' style.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XEfCG.jpg"" alt=""Button style screenshot""></p>

<p>To create this image I created a rectangle with a background colour of <code>rgb(63,64,63)</code> or <code>#3F403F</code>, then 'stylized' it to have a 15px border radius.</p>

<p>I then applied an 'inner glow' to it with a 25% opacity, 8px blur, white from the center.  Finally, I applied a 3pt white stroke on it. (I'm telling you all of this in case you wished to reproduce it, if the image above isn't sufficient.)</p>

<p>So, my question is thus: </p>

<p><em>Is it possible to recreate this 'button' using CSS without the need for an image?</em> </p>

<p>I am aware of the 'limitations' of Internet Explorer (and for the sake of this experiment, I couldn't give a monkeys). I am also aware of the small 'bug' in webkit which incorrectly renders an element with a background colour, border-radius and a border (with a different color to the background-color) - it lets the background color bleed through on the curved corners.</p>

<p>My best attempt so far is fairly pathetic, but for reference here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>section#featured footer p a
{
    color: rgb(255,255,255);
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    -moz-border-radius: 15px;
    -webkit-border-radius: 15px;
    border: 3px solid rgb(255,255,255);
    background: rgb(98,99,100);

    background: -moz-radial-gradient(
        50% 50%, 
        farthest-side, 
        #626364, 
        #545454
    );
    background: -webkit-gradient(
        radial, 
        50% 50%,
        1px,
        50% 50%,
        5px,
        from(rgb(98,99,100)),
        to(rgb(84,84,84))
    );
}

<p>the model class is huge so I omitted the initializers. One thing to note, is that this class does not contain any NSError types but contains functions, getters, and setters, all of which do not throw any sort of errors. I don't know if that affects the model at all but they have all been working fine up this point. All these errors started happening when I upgrade to Swift 2 and XCode 7. I'm really stumped over here, any help would be great.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
my problem was that I added a <code>var error: NSError?</code> accidentally in between two functions within my model while I was optimizing code. I couldn't find it because my model is packed with helper functions and what not. So I hope this helps anyone who runs into this problem to just leave models alone and put any code that isn't schema related outside of the model itself.</p>

<p>I am able to do this but while displaying the content of text file in webbrowser control it is displaying some encoded data.</p>

<p>How can I display the actual data in pdf. Below is my code</p>

<p>Convert pdf to text file</p>

<pre><code>byte[] bytes = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(OpenPdfDialog.FileName);
string byteString = Encoding.Default.GetString(bytes);
System.IO.File.WriteAllText(@""E:\file.txt"", byteString );

<p>Displaying content to webbrowser control</p>

<pre><code> byte[] bytes = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(@""E:\path.txt"");
 MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(bytes2);
 ms.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
 ms.Position = 0;
 webBrowser1.DocumentStream = ms;
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Reading the file as stream and displaying the stream in the webbrowser control also displaying the encoded data</p>

<pre><code>FileStream to_strem = new FileStream(OpenPdfDialog.FileName, FileMode.Open);
webBrowser1.DocumentStream = to_strem ;

    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    Button ScreentwoGameButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.screentwo);

<p>How do i use this code below but the right way like.
So let's put an example if I click screentwo button the screentwo.xml will show and it will allow me to click inside if any buttons are available. Instead just stare what's in the layout.</p>

<p>I don't want to use the Activity to activity cause the whole point is i'm trying to avoid the flashing looking feel going to another java class.</p>

<p>If you look at the moron test game on Android it says example: press the blue button then red and then green, so if u press the blue button the screen will remain and not flash at all but the image of the blue button will disappear and I'm allowed to click the red and then green.

<p>I have a PIC16F628A, and I have 2 motors coonnected to pins of that PIC. Pins RB0 and RB1 are connected to right motor. Pins RB2 and RB3 are connected to left motor. I'm using MPLAB as compiler from .pbp to .hex. I want to write a PIC BASIC program (.pbp) that will move one of these motors( for ex: left one) ... I have just written a simple code segment like this.</p>

<p>Compiler compiles it correctly, after I burn the hex file succesfully, I place the pig, then I start it, I see nothing...! I'm really so amateur in this programming language, I just want to ask that do I need to write any other code segment to run my motors? Or is there anybody who had such kind of project before?</p>

<p>My page is 1000px high. If the users viewport is 300px down then thats where I want the image to display, not at the very top of the page. Position:static doesn't work for me in this case because I want the user to be able to scroll past the image and not have it follow him. </p>

Is <code>m_Z</code> somehow automagically constructed along with <code>Y</code>? Or have I missed something after all and there is some deeper magic in the codebase which initializes it?</p>

The tables look like this:</p>

<p>Student -
StudentID - int PK,
StudentName - Varchar,
etc ...</p>

<p>Class -
ClassID - int PK,
ClassName - varchar,
etc...</p>

<p>StudentClass - 
StudentID,
ClassID,</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is create a new Student whom can belong to multiple classes. So I have created the Student class table to break up the many-many relationship. I have a stored procedure to insert a new student and return the newest StudentID and then I use this StudentID, in a new stored procedure, and a table value parameter to insert multiple rows into StudentClass table. These are the stored procedures:</p>

<p>Create A Student:</p>

<pre><code>@FirstName varchar(20) = '', 
@LastName varchar(20) = '',
@PredictedGrade char(1) = '',
@ActionPlan bit = 0,
@StudentActive bit = 1,
@StudentID int out

INSERT INTO Student (FirstName, LastName, PredictedGrade, ActionPlan, StudentActive)
VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName, @PredictedGrade, @ActionPlan, @StudentActive)
SET @StudentID = SCOPE_IDENTITY()
</code></pre>

<p>Add Multiple Rows To StudentClass Table:</p>

<pre><code>(@StudentClassCollection As InsertStudentClass READONLY)

INSERT INTO StudentClass(StudentID, ClassID)
SELECT StudentID, ClassID FROM @StudentClassCollection
</code></pre>

<p>So both of these work however I don't know how to make it so if one fails the other will not execute and changes will not be committed? So effectively I need to perform both actions one after the other in the same stored procedure? I think! As I said I am new so if I have done anything wrong please let me know I will correct it :)</p>

<pre><code>$hitspercent = @round(($hits / $totalinfo) * 100);
$uniquespercent = @round(($uniques / $totalinfo) * 100);

<p>I have the following code that successfully uploads a image using .submit()</p>

    if(this.files[0].size &gt; maxsize) {

    }else if($.inArray(fileExtension, ['gif','png','jpg','jpeg']) == -1) {
        $('h4#fileTypeNotAllowed').show();

    }else{
        if(pushState == '0') {
            $('div#uploadPercentage').hide();
            $('img#uploadGifLoaderHTML4').fadeIn('fast');
        }
        $('form#joinPhotoUploadForm').submit();
        jcrop_api.destroy();

        $('div#croppingBackgroundContainer').fadeIn(1000);
        $('div#cropBoxWrapper').css('margin-left', '0px');
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The issue I have is if the user requests the same file again there is no change and the submit doesn't fire. </p>

<p>Is there a way for the same file to be requested again or to know its the same file again or some sort of reset that can be done on the input type=""file""?</p>

<p><em><strong></em>**<em>*</em>**<em>*</em>**<em>*</em></strong> Update</p>

<pre><code>      &lt;form action=""scripts/php/photo_processing.php?page=join&amp;section=precrop"" id=""joinPhotoUploadForm"" enctype=""multipart/form-data""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""file"" name=""file"" id=""file""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>user clicks a browse button and can select an image. If the user selects a different image the image will upload. However if the user selects the same image the .change() function doesn't fire at all. I assume because its retaining the same state as before. </p>

<p>My target is to stream ALL audio (or at least the played music) to a remote speaker via AirPlay.</p>

<p>The kernel module worked, but there where several problems (kernel-versions, root-privileges etc.) so I stopped working on this.</p>

<p>Now, we have Android 4.1 and 4.2 and I have new hope!</p>

<p>Who has an idea how to capture the audio in Android?</p>

<p>I had following ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13875126/android-possible-to-connect-bluetooth-to-self/13879176#13879176"">Connect via bluetooth</a>  to the same phone, set routing to BT and grab the audio on the ""other end"": this shouldn't work</p></li>
<li><p>Intercept the audio with a kernel module like done before: hardcore, get it worked but not applicable</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://jackaudio.org/"">JACK Audio Connection Kit</a>: sadly Android uses ""tinyALSA"" and not ""ALSA"". TinyALSA does NOT support any filters like JACK (but this brought the idea with the kernel module)</p></li>
<li><p>Use PulseAudio as a replacement for AudioFlinger, but this is also not applicable</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>EDIT (forgot them):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I compiled ""tinymix"" (baby-version of ALSA-mixer) from <a href=""https://github.com/tinyalsa/tinyalsa"">tinyALSA</a> (the ALSA on Android) and tried to route the audio-out to mic-in - but with no success (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10733214/android-how-to-configure-tinymix-to-record-system-audio-with-tinycap"">not understandable for me</a>). And this also needs rooting: not applicable</p></li>
<li><p>I tested <a href=""http://www.khronos.org/opensles/"">OpenSL ES</a>, but I'm not a C-crack and it ended in ""I can record microphone, but no more"" (maybe I was wrong?)</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I just found <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRouter.html#ROUTE_TYPE_LIVE_AUDIO"">ROUTE_TYPE_LIVE_AUDIO</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A device that supports live audio routing will allow the media audio
  stream to be routed to supported destinations. This can include
  internal speakers or audio jacks on the device itself, A2DP devices,
  and more.</p>
  
  <p>Once initiated this routing is transparent to the application. All
  audio played on the media stream will be routed to the selected
  destination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe this helps in any way?</p>

<p>I'm running out of ideas but want to ""crack this nut"", maybe someone can help me?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I'm really new in C &amp; kernel-coding (but I successfully created a cross-compiled audio-interception-module) - but isn't it in any way possible to listen at the point the PCM-data goes from userspace (JAVA, C-layer?) to the kernel-space (tinyALSA, kernel-module), without hacking &amp; rooting?</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<p>EDIT: The OS is Centos 5.7,  I have seen the behaviour on i7 and a Dual Xeon machines.</p>

<p>Why do I do this? Because the average time to write a message is 35-100 ns depending on length and using a plain write() isn't as fast.  If I memory map and clean up in the current thread this takes 50-130 microseconds, using a background thread to do it takes about 3-5 microseconds for the main thread to swap buffers.  Why do I need to be swapping buffers at all? Because I am writing many GB of data and ByteBuffer cannot be 2+ GB in size.</p>

<p>When user touches the SearchBar, the bottom view is gray. Touching the gray area to leave the Seach text-box and my user is able to click on one of history words.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>If he/she types on SearchBar, the suggestion words list appears and he/she can click a word to see its definition with the SearchBar containing the word there (I don't want my users having to go to 2nd view to see word's definition because if so, they must click Back button to touch and type on Seach text-box. It's likely that, my application has only 1 ViewController).</li>

<p>I know how to work with SearchBar and TableView to display the suggestion words list but don't know what to do to implement other things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a view gray; touching on the gray area to leave the Search text-box</li>
<li>Hide the suggestion words list (TableView) -> user can see ""History words"" again</li>
<li>Keep the SearchBar -> user can type immediately to search other word when he/she is seeing current word definition</li>

for example:</p>

<p>1) A = 1+2</p>

<p>2) B + C  (where B and C have already been assigned values)</p>

<p>Example one I can work out by returning an ID token from flex to bison, and just following a grammar that recognizes that 1+2 is an integer expression, putting A into the symbol table, and setting its value. </p>

<p>examples two and three are more difficult for me because: after going through my lexer, what's being returned in ex.2 to bison is ""ID PLUS ID"" -> I have a grammar that recognizes arithmetic expressions for numerical values, like INT PLUS INT (which would produce an INT), or DOUBLE MINUS INT (which would produce a DOUBLE). if I have ""ID PLUS ID"", how do I know what type the return value is?</p>

<p>Here's the best idea that I've come up with so far:    When tokenizing, every time an ID comes up, I search for its value and type in the symbol table and switch out the ID token with its respective information; for example: while tokenizing, I come across B, which has a regex that matches it as being an ID. I look in my symbol table and see that it has a value of 51.2 and is a DOUBLE. So instead of returning ID, with a value of B to bison, I'm returning DOUBLE with a value of 51.2 </p>

<p>I have two different solutions that contradict each other. Here's why: if I want to assign a value to an ID, I would say to my compiler A = 5. In this situation, if I'm using my previously described solution, What I'm going to get after everything is tokenized might be, INT ASGN INT, or STRING ASGN INT, etc... So, in this case, I would use the former solution, as opposed to the latter. </p>

<p>My question would be: what kind of logical device do I use to help my compiler know which solution to use?</p>

<p>NOTE: I didn't think it necessary to post source code to describe my conundrum, but I will if anyone could use it effectively as a reference to help me understand their input on this topic. </p>

<p>So far I managed to make it so that if you specify the length of the word, it will give you all the words of that length you can make with the letters you gave it.</p>

<p>The program contains facts <code>word/1</code> for all English words taken into consideration, like so:</p>

<pre><code>word(ant).  
word(computer).
% ... (and many more)
</code></pre>

<p>First, I made a predicate called <code>word_letters/2</code> that turns a word into a list of letters, like the <code>atom_chars/2</code> predicate.</p>

<p>Then, I wrote a <code>cover/2</code> predicate to see if a list contains all letters of a previous list: </p>

<pre><code>cover([],[]).
cover([],_).
cover([Head1|Tail1],List2) :-
   member(Head1,List2),
   select(Head1,List2,Newlist),
   cover(Tail1,Newlist).
</code></pre>

<p>Then I wrote a <code>solution/3</code> predicate that turns all the words of a certain length into a list of letters, and checks if that list is covered by letters you gave it first:</p>

<pre><code>solution(Letters,Word,Length) :-
   word(Word),
   word_letters(Word,Letters2),
   length(Letters2,Length),
   word_letters(Word,Letters2),
   cover(Letters2,Letters).
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm trying to do now is making it so that you don't have to specify the length of the word. It should just give the longest possible word, and tell you how long it is.
It should work like this:</p>

<pre><code>?- topsolution([g,i,g,c,n,o,a,s,t], Word, Score).
Word = agnostic,
Score = 8
True
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't look that hard, but I just can't seem to make it work.

<p>Hi, consider the following transform to extract the <code>value_type</code> from a <code>vector_expr</code> (see previous questions)</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt; struct value_type_trait;

template &lt;std::size_t D, class T&gt;
struct value_type_trait&lt;vector&lt;D, T&gt; &gt;
{
    typedef typename vector&lt;D, T&gt;::value_type type;
};

struct deduce_value_type
    : proto::or_&lt;
            proto::when &lt;vector_terminal, value_type_trait&lt;proto::_value&gt;() &gt;
        ,   proto::when &lt;scalar_terminal, proto::_value&gt;
        ,   proto::otherwise &lt;
                    proto::_default&lt;deduce_value_type&gt;()
            &gt;
    &gt;
{};
</code></pre>

<p>The above code can be used to provide 'maximal' value_type to the expression tree, which is obtained applying the usual C++ promotion rules and Boost.TypeOf magic. The above is used as follows</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class Expr&gt;
struct vector_expr : proto::extends &lt;Expr, vector_expr &lt;Expr&gt;, vector_domain&gt;
{
    typedef proto::extends &lt;Expr, vector_expr &lt;Expr&gt;, vector_domain&gt; base_type;
    // OK! now my expression has a 'value_type'
    typedef typename boost::result_of&lt;deduce_value_type(Expr)&gt;::type value_type;

    vector_expr (Expr const &amp;e) : base_type (e) {}
};
</code></pre>

<p>But now, the following code (check previous question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/12122191/1245083"">boost.proto + modify expression tree in place</a> and the code in the accepted answer) is broken (with the usual humongous template instantiation error backtrace, for my pleasure)</p>

<pre><code>int main ()
{
   double data[] = {1, 2, 3};
   vector&lt;3, double&gt; a(data, data+3), b(data,data+3), c(data,data+3);

   auto iter = vector_begin_algo()(a + b);
   return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is simple. The type of <code>typename boost::result_of&lt;vector_begin_algo(a+b)&gt;::type</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>vector_expr&lt;
    basic_expr&lt;
        tag::plus
      , list2&lt; expr&lt;tag::terminal, term&lt;vector_iterator&lt;double*&gt; &gt;, 0l&gt;
             , expr&lt;tag::terminal, term&lt;vector_iterator&lt;double*&gt; &gt;, 0l&gt; 
        &gt;
      , 
    2l&gt;
&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, the external <code>vector_expr&lt;...&gt;</code> triggers the evaluation of the nested <code>value_type</code>, but the <code>deduce_value_type</code> algorithm doesn't know how to extract the nested <code>value_type</code> from <code>vector_iterator&lt;double*&gt;</code>. One solution is to define a new traits and modify <code>deduce_value_type</code> as follows</p>

<pre><code>// A further trait
template &lt;class Iter&gt;
struct value_type_trait&lt;vector_iterator&lt;Iter&gt; &gt;
{
    typedef typename std::iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::value_type type;
};

// Algorithm to deduce the value type of an expression.
struct deduce_value_type
    : proto::or_&lt;
            proto::when &lt;vector_terminal, value_type_trait&lt;proto::_value&gt;() &gt;
        ,   proto::when &lt;scalar_terminal, proto::_value&gt;
        ,   proto::when &lt;proto::terminal&lt;vector_iterator&lt;proto::_&gt; &gt; , value_type_trait&lt;proto::_value&gt;()&gt; // &lt;- need this now
        ,   proto::otherwise &lt;
                    proto::_default&lt;deduce_value_type&gt;()
            &gt;
    &gt;
{};
</code></pre>

<p>There are several problems with this approach, but the most important is: for each typedef or static constant that i find convenient defining in the <code>vector_expr</code> struct, I will need to perform all the above only to have the expression compile, even if an iterator-expression IS-NOT vector-expression and it makes no sense to enlarge the interface of vector_expr to accommodate transformed trees. </p>

<p>The question is: there is a way to transform the <code>vector_expr</code> tree, converting vector nodes into iterator nodes, while at the same time removing the <em>vector-ness</em> from the tree itself so that i do not incur in the above problems?
Thanks in advance, best regards!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
Sorry, i changed the last part of the question now that my mind is more clear about what (i think) should be achieved. In the meantime, i tried to solve the thing by myself with a partial success (?), but I feel that there should be a better way (so I still need help!).</p>

<p>It seems to me that the problems come from having all the tree nodes wrapped in the <code>vector_expr</code> thing, that has the side-effect of putting requirement on the terminals (mainly the static stuff for successfully compiling). OTOH, once a valid <code>vector_exp</code> has  been constructed (namely: obeying the <code>vector_grammar</code>), then i can transform it to a valid iterator_tree without further checks.</p>

<p>I tried to create a transform that changes back all <code>vector_expr</code> nodes in a tree into 'proto::expr'. The code is as follows:</p>

<p>The query should return 25 rows. I have verified this by running it directly in the DB console. When I run:</p>

<p><code>List&lt;MyClass&gt; result = (List&lt;MyClass&gt;)query.execute();</code></p>

<p>I verify the size as being 25 with <code>.size()</code>.  The issue I am having is that while iterating on the result, the <code>.hasNext()</code> check is continuing on past 25 rows. Even though I am properly using <code>.next()</code> to increment it.</p>

<p>When I went to debug it I put breakpoints on the <code>hasNext()</code> and <code>next()</code>. As you can see in the linked screencapture, the result has a size of 25, but there are 33 objects in the ArrayList!  Expanding that node shows all of the expected results, plus 8 null entries at the end.  I even emptied the table of all but the 25 rows and it still returned 33 objects. </p>

<p>I am assuming this must be why my iterator continues on and I end up with a NullPointerException.</p>

<p><a href=""http://postimage.org/image/99hc1u2ct/"" rel=""nofollow"">Debug Screencapture</a> &lt;-- Sorry not enough rep to post inline</p>

<p>Googling hasn't turned up anything specific...  The only thing I wondered is if there is some issue rebuilding the objects and there are leftovers at the end.  Its only primitives and enums in the class, and they are in the default fetch group.</p>

<p>I Appreciate an suggestions you may have. </p>

*</p>

<p>I think my troubles come from having to define two templates, one in the Stack.h file and one in my LinkedList.h file. In my Stack.h file I need to call on Node, I can't call on Node without including the template arguments, and Stack.h won't recognize the template arguments without me including another template definition. Right now there are instances where I only use 'T' instead of Node, but I've tried it both ways. I feel like I've tried everything and I just can't figure out where my error is. I'm really just going for proof of concept at this point which is why I haven't added a copy constructor or additional functions for Stack. My code is below. </p>

<p><strong>Question A @ line 8</strong> </p>

<p>i do not really understand the syntax meaning for ""<em>res = res &lt;&lt; 1</em>"" for the purpose of ""get_signature""</p>

<p><strong>Question B @ line 49</strong> (SOLVED BY myself through another <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15193927/what-does-these-operator-mean-python"">Q&amp;A</a>)</p>

<p>""<em>xor = r1^r2</em>"" does not really make any sense to me, which the author later tried ""<em>(d-nna(vor))</em>"" to calculate ""hash_sim"" -- (refer to line 50)</p>

<p><strong>Question C @ about hash_sim in general</strong></p>

<p>that question is more to do with LSH understanding, what variable ""<em>d</em>"" (line 38) is doing in the sample code ---- which is later used to calculate <em>hash_sim</em> in line 50</p>

<p><strong>Question D @ line 20 and 24 -- synatx for ""&amp;""</strong></p>

<p>not only having problem in understand the syntax ""<em>num = num &amp; (num-1)</em>"", but also unsure what function ""nnz"" is doing in the context of hash_similarlity. this question may relate to my question (-b-) when the author apply the ""xor"" into ""<em>nnz</em>"", and again equation for ""<em>xor</em>"" (question b) looks odd to me.</p>

I want to read all the files from a file list, and then get the number from all those files. For example:</p>

Everything was going fine up until recently, with many functions implemented successfully. </p>

<p>In particular, I had one function that used get_users() which I could not get working (I kept getting null returned in my responses). However, I noticed that all my other, originally working methods were behaving in the same way. I had not edited or changed them in any way. Commenting out the new function still caused problems in my old functions.</p>

<p>After a while, I got pretty angry, downloaded a fresh installation of wordpress, and copied my old functions and commented out new functions into the clean xmlrpc.php file. I uploaded that to the server, and everything started magically working again.</p>

<p>However, I had another crack at my new function, and seemed to break it in the exact same way again. My solution to use the fresh xmlrpc.php file does not seem to be working either.</p>

<p>Here is the code I believe to be problematic (it is hard to tell, as I tried many different ways to write the same function, believing it was my code being wrong rather than all the methods causing errors, even if they were coded right). All my other functions up until this point had been based around using WP_Query() in different ways.</p>

<pre><code>$blogusers = get_users();
foreach ($blogusers as $bloguser) {
    $user = get_userdata($bloguser-&gt;ID);
            //put various things into arrays etc  
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So if any advice could be given to</p>

<p>1) restore my original methods to working order
2) allow me to return an array with information from each user of the blog</p>

<p>That would be fantastic</p>

<p>I'm confused about how to architect the game.  <strong>But specifically, I'm asking about how to setup the objects needed to position models in the scene.</strong></p>

<p>I have an object that represents a scene.  There are 5 scenes.  Only one scene is shown at a time.  A scene is like a game level.  Each scene has all the code for rendering, game logic, mouse and keyboard handling.  Touch-screen handling is handled like a mouse click.</p>

<p>Each Scene has:
It's own projection matrix.
It's own ""View"" matrix -- currently not used -- always set to the identity matrix
A list of models to render</p>

<p>Each Model has:
The vertex list
A GLSL program to render itself
A texture
A ""model"" matrix</p>

<p>I use an Orthographic projection matrix.  </p>

<p>Since we're using GLES 2, I have to do just about everything manually.  Including the matrices.  So I don't use glPushMatrix, glPopMatrix, glTranslate, etc.  They aren't available.  Instead, I have my own functions which operate on my own Matrix objects.</p>

<p>OK here's where things get weird for me.</p>

<p>1) Setup the projection matrix (using an orthographic matrix)</p>

<pre><code>_math_matrix_ortho(&amp;this-&gt;ProjectionMatrix, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, (float)height / (float)width, -1.0f, 1.0f);
</code></pre>

<p>2) Leave the view matrix as the identity matrix</p>

<p>3) Load each model</p>

<p>4) Each model's ""model"" matrix is defaults to the identity matrix</p>

<p>5) I now scale each model to make them the right side in proportion to one another.  The scaling function adjusts the Model's ""model"" matrix. </p>

<pre><code>model-&gt;modelMatrix.Scale(0.25, 0.25, 0.25);
</code></pre>

<p>6) Move each model into place</p>

<pre><code>model-&gt;modelMatrix.Translate(2.0, 0.0, 0.0);
</code></pre>

<p>7) Render each model</p>

<pre><code>{
    glUseProgram(this-&gt;_program.program);
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glVertexAttribPointer(_positionLoc, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, _vertices );
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glVertexAttribPointer(_texCoordLoc, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, _texCoords);
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glEnableVertexAttribArray(_positionLoc);
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glEnableVertexAttribArray(_texCoordLoc);
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glBindTexture ( GL_TEXTURE_2D, _texture-&gt;getGLID() );
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glUniform1i ( _texLoc, 0 );
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glUniformMatrix4fv(_pMatrixLoc, 1, GL_FALSE, SceneManager::getInstance().getCurrentScene().ProjectionMatrix.m);
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glUniformMatrix4fv(_vMatrixLoc, 1, GL_FALSE, this-&gt;_vMatrix.m);
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glUniformMatrix4fv(_mMatrixLoc, 1, GL_FALSE, this-&gt;_mMatrix.m);
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();

    glDrawArrays ( GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4);
    GL_CHECK_ERROR();
}

<p>What seems odd to me right off:  <strong>Is it appropriate to be translating the Model's matrix?</strong></p>

<p>The dicey part comes when I try to glUnProject the mouse/touch-screen coordinates.  </p>

<p>1) Get Mouse/Touch-Screen coordinates</p>

<p>2) Un-project them. </p>

<p>Now I have the coordinates relative to the View matrix.  Which is the identity matrix.  What that means is that x,y coords are translated to a coordinate system where the max vertical and horizonal extents are exactly 1.0.  </p>

<p><strong>How do I figure out what object was clicked?</strong></p>

<p>It seems that in order to answer my last question, I need to better understand where I positioned it.  </p>

However, after some minutes (see <strong>NOTE</strong>) my <code>NinjectResolver</code> is disposed, and therefore begins to throw <code>NullPointerException</code> when trying to resolve a type (this is because I am setting <code>_kernel = null</code> in the <code>Dispose</code> method).</p>

<p>A way to solve this is to keep the reference alive and not set it to null when the resolver is disposed. But why should I?</p>

<p>I mean, why is my resolver getting disposed just like that, from one minute to another? Nowhere in my code am I disposing it explicitly, so it must be the Web Api framework doing it for me.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Sometimes it takes a couple of minutes, and sometimes just seconds. It's completely random.</p>

The first keyframe reproduces a video, after that, the program should skip to keyframe 2. So i've implemented a Timer with the length of the video. All fine until I decided to add a event listener to skip the video just pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key. It works but the counter doesn't stop!

count_to_17.start();

google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
  infowindow.open(map,marker);
});   

return marker;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>The above code shows a marker accoriding to the <code>latlng</code> list passed from the context. But the problem is occurring at that time when i also tried to pass <code>time and user</code> with the same way. It shows nothing  on the Map. By the way i tried with this coide:</p>

<pre><code>var user = [{% for i in user %}{{ i }}{% endfor %}]; 
var timestamp = [{% for y in time %}{{ y }}{% endfor %}];
</code></pre>

<p>Is that the right way? I am new in javascript i wrote according the <code>latlng</code> code. </p>

<p>I tried with <code>alert(timestamp)</code>. Nothing happens :(</p>

<p>Another problem is i have to pass these three parameter to <code>add_marker</code>
java script method. TO do this i have to run three for loop concurrently. Posting the pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>var user = [{% for i in user %}{{ i }}{% endfor %}]; 
var timestamp = [{% for y in time %}{{ y }}{% endfor %}];
var flightPlanCoordinates = [ {% for ip in latlng %}{{ ip }}{% endfor %}];
for (var in flightPlanCoordinates) and for (a in timestamp) and for(b in user)
{
  var marker = add_marker(flightPlanCoordinates[i][0], flightPlanCoordinates[i][1],b,a);
marker.setMap(map);

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong>
All hail sodawillow, thank you! :) The below worked, although not sure if code is exactly as should be? I set table font at 62.5% at first, but this resulted in the text being too small, so set to 100% and looks good now. </p>

<p>Looks fine on my mobile, but that's just one screen size, so do you see any corrections needed please? Any adverse effects from table font being 100%? Should table font also be added to @media queries?</p>

<pre><code>html { font-size: 62.5%; }
table { font-size: 100% }
body {
    font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;
    font-size: 1em;
}
@media (max-width: 300px) {
    html { font-size: 70%; }
}

@media (min-width: 500px) {
    html { font-size: 80%; }
}

@media (min-width: 700px) {
    html { font-size: 100%; }
}

"18852682","1","","","2013-09-17 14:30:18","","10","259","<p>This is not really a question, but an answer which would hopefully help other people.</p>

<p>Those who've written a windows service before, know what a mission it could be to find a bug in it, particularly if it only happens on the live environment. In my case, I had a service that ran smoothly for a couple of hours, and then fell over from a stack overflow error. No stack trace. Good luck finding the needle in the haystack.</p>

<p>The service did produce a log file, and the code was littered with log entries, but as detailed as is was, it produced log files of 500 MB! You could barely open the file, never mind analyse it. But how do you get around this problem? You could try to produce log files with less information, or one that automatically delete older logs entries as newer ones are being written, but then you loose important context of the error.</p>

<p>The solution is a log file that will keep track of loops in your code, and automatically delete the log entries for each successful iteration of that loop. This way, you can maintain a highly detained log file which remains relatively small at the same time. When your service breaks, your log file will tell you exactly where it happened, plus all the necessary context to explain how and why it happened. </p>

<p>You can download this logfile generator from <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartl/files/?source=navbar"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartl/files/?source=navbar</a>. It's a stand alone class and all its methods is static. An example class is provided to show you how to use the logging methods correctly:</p>

<pre><code>    public void ExampleMethod()
    {           
        SmartLog.EnterMethod(""ExampleMethod()""); 
        try
        {
            SmartLog.Write(""Some code happening before the loop"");

            Guid exampleLoopID = SmartLog.RegisterLoop(""exampleLoopID"");
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
            {
                SmartLog.IncrementLoop(exampleLoopID);

                SmartLog.Write(""Some code happening inside the loop."");

            }
            SmartLog.CompleteLoop(exampleLoopID);

            SmartLog.Write(""Some code happening after the loop."");

            SmartLog.LeaveMethod(""ExampleMethod()"");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            SmartLog.WriteException(ex);
            SmartLog.LeaveMethod(""ExampleMethod()"");
            throw;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure your application has read and write access on its root folder. </p>

<p>If you execute the code, and you break it inside the loop, the logfile will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>. ENTER METHOD: FirstMethod()
some code happening here.
Calling a different method:

. . ENTER METHOD: ExampleMethod()
some code happening before the loop.

LOOP: doWorkLoopID [4135a8ed-05b7-45de-b887-b2ab3c638faa] - CURRENT ITERATION: 20
some code happening inside the loop.
</code></pre>

<p>Once the loop has been completed, its content is removed, and your log file will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>. ENTER METHOD: FirstMethod()
some code happening here.
Calling a different method:

. . ENTER METHOD: ExampleMethod()
some code happening before the loop.

LOOP: doWorkLoopID [4135a8ed-05b7-45de-b887-b2ab3c638faa] - TOTAL ITERATIONS: 22

some code happening after the loop.
. . LEAVING METHOD: ExampleMethod()

some code happening here.
some code happening here.
. LEAVING METHOD: FirstMethod()
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this can help someone solve that problem which otherwise could've taken weeks. It sure did the trick for me.</p>

<p>I'm trying to draw lines perpendicular to a plane. I know the three points in space the make up the plane. From those coordinates I can calculate vectors and get the normal vector of the plane. Using the coordinates from the center of the three points and the normal vector I can draw a line perpendicular to the plane. </p>

<p>My problem is that the length of that line is tied to the normal vector because I'm just adding the vector to the coordinates to get two points to draw a line on. Without using some hideous brute-force code how do I draw a line of fixed length given any point in 3D space and any vector.</p>

<p>(I'm asking here because I don't know terms to use to search on google, my textbook doesn't have anything dealing with this, and my professor isn't going to be available before this is due.)</p>

<p>And I am currently doing this:</p>

<pre><code>string oldFormat = ""01/01/2014"";
string newFormat = oldFormat.Replace(""/"", """");

<p>Sure enough, this converts <code>""01/01/2014""</code> to <code>""01012014""</code>. But my question is, <strong>does the replace happen in one step, or does it create an intermediate string (e.g.: <code>""0101/2014""</code> or <code>""01/012014""</code>)?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Here's the reason why I am asking this:</p>

<p>I am processing transaction files ranging in size from few kilobytes to hundreds of megabytes. So far I have not had a performance/memory problem, because I am still testing with very small files. But when it comes to megabytes I am not sure if I will have problems with these additional strings. I suspect that would be the case because <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/2365272/1461424""><code>string</code>s are immutable</a>. With millions of records this additional memory consumption will build up considerably.</p>

<p>I am already using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder(v=vs.100).aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>StringBuilder</code></a>s for output file creation. And I also know that the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/2423137/1461424"">discarded strings will be garbage collected</a> (at some point before the end of the time). I was wondering if there is a better, more efficient way of replacing all occurrences of a specific character/substring in a string, that does not additionally create an string.</p>

From my understanding of Geometry Wars, the enemy shapes were created with 3D shapes, and the wireframe of the shapes were shown, and glowed. I already know how the glowing works (the Bloom effect, which I have working right now, and creates the correct effect). How do I make these wireframe-like models in Xna? Do I need to create a model and show wireframes? (I have no idea how to do that). If Geometry Wars does not use these wireframe 3D shapes, another example is PewPew. In PewPew, the graphics look and feel almost the same as Geometry Wars. However, PewPew sometimes changes the camera angle. In this different angle, the shapes are 3D, and no longer 2D. Again, my question is how can I make this effect in Xna (MonoGame, to be exact)?</p>

<p>I'm creating my iPad version of the graphing calculator and trying to add the toolbar to the iPad detail view so it can hold the UIbutton to return to the master view, but I can not resize the view (contained within the view controller) to enable me to add the toolbar, without it becoming a subview of the view.</p>

<p>Because It's a little hard to explain I've taken 2 screencaps. One of the video from Stanford of what is supposed to happen and one of what happens when I do the same.</p>

<p>The short version: I drag out a view from the palette and drop it onto the view controller, it automatically fills the entire view controller and trying to move or resize it in any way has no impact.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Thanks! Putting the graphview inside a standard view worked...kind of</p>

<p>It solved the immediate problem, but has possibly introduced another problem. </p>

<p>Now, when I run the app, my axes are displayed on the graph as expected. I specify a program to graph, but drawrect doesn't get called again after the initial screen draw. </p>

<p>I can only assume that this is now because my graphview is now a subview of another view, as on the iPhone (universal app) it still works fine, and correctly draws the graph but that segues between the calculator and the graph.</p>

<p><strong>Update again</strong></p>

<p>Ignore me I'm being stupid. In trying to solve the first problem, i'd deleted my original graphview, and when I added a new one, I hadn't hooked up the outlet again. Hence why nothing was happening! All sorted!</p>

E.g. if A > B and B > C, then A need NOT be greater than C.</em></p>

<p>A simple <strong>O(n^2)</strong> solution. Comparison of each element with each other element. </p>

<p>The interviewer was not satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>Attempt 2:</strong></p>

<p>Start comparing first element with 2nd element and onward. For whichever element 'E', if A > E, mark E (may be by using another array/list/etc.) and do not consider E for any further comparison. This is because there is at least 1 element which is better than E, so E is definitely not the answer. </p>

<p>Complexity is still <strong>O(n^2)</strong> with some improvement as compared to previous attempt.</p>

<p>Actual echo is:   2012-11-26scan_date=2012-11-26</p>

The client side alert gives this:  2012-11-26 and that is what i expect.
So, it appears that something is happening on the server side.  I expect the echo to be ""2012-11-26"" and not ""2012-11-26scan_date=2012-11-26""</p>

      content here
    &lt;/accordion-group&gt;

    &lt;div class=""panel panel-default ng-isolate-scope"" heading=""my heading""&gt;

<p>As you can see , .Net puts the message parameter on the Post at the top and does not 
put the message variable name at the bottom while Android does not put the message body at the Post at the top and does put the message variable name at the bottom.</p>

<p>This is my Android post code , </p>

<pre><code>    HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(url);      
    String messageBody = ""message="" + jsonMessageParameter;
    StringEntity entity = new StringEntity(messageBody);
    httpPost.setEntity(entity);
    httpPost.setHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/json; charset=utf-8"");
    HttpResponse response = hc.execute(httpPost);
    InputStream content = response.getEntity().getContent();
    String json = ConvertStreamToString(content);
</code></pre>

<p>When calling with this code , the server method is called but the message method parameter is null.
I tried playing with the Uri.Builder class to also make the android post put the message at the header , but doesnt quite work.
If can someone help me out here , I am stuck on this for hours over hours.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance , </p>

<p>EDIT :</p>

<p>I changed the Android code to : </p>

<pre><code>    List&lt;NameValuePair&gt; nameValuePairs = new ArrayList&lt;NameValuePair&gt;(1);
    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""message"", jsonMessageParameter));

    HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(url);
     UrlEncodedFormEntity urlEncodedFromEntity = new UrlEncodedFormEntity(
     nameValuePairs);
     urlEncodedFromEntity.setContentType(new BasicHeader(""Content-Type"",
     ""application/json; charset=utf-8""));

    httpPost.setEntity(urlEncodedFromEntity);

    InputStream postStream = httpPost.getEntity().getContent();
    String postOutput = ConvertStreamToString(postStream);
    HttpResponse response = hc.execute(httpPost);

<p>I have an issue with the scroll views of my app. I know that I can have only one scroll view per view controller in order to avoid problems with the ""tap the status bar to scroll to the top""; and I have only one per VC, but all the VC are inside a bigger one, that handles the view sizes and the interface orientation. This is the structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main View Controller
<ul>
<li>Page 1 (View controller)</li>
<li>Page 2 (View controller)
...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>And the only scroll view that works with the status bar is one inside a UITableView on the <strong>Page 1</strong>. </p>

<p>Finally, the question: Anyone knows how to fix this issue without changing the main structure of the app? (there are a lot of pages).</p>

<p>Obviously if I use <code>postFunfData(SpecificDataType object)</code> Jackson converts JSON to object successfully, but I don't know the object type at compile time.</p>

<p>Another requirement is flexibility: When a new class is added to the domain, <em>little</em> code work has to be done to support the new datatype. In the <code>GET</code> ter I just add a switch to support the new datatype, instantiate correct repository with Spring and query the DB.</p>

<h3>The question</h3>

<p>How do I write a Spring MVC REST API that accepts ""anything"" as request body and allows me to convert from JSON to the correct object? Something like:</p>

<pre><code>public void postData(@RequestBody Object objData){
    if (objData instanceof Class1) {
        Class1 obj = (Class1) objData;
        Class1Repository.store(obj);
    }
    [...]
}

To reduce the amount of data I have, I decided to take the important ones and remove the others. This goes for identical strings with smaller values in this case.</p>

<p>Let's take a 3x2 data:</p>

<pre><code>     A      B
  ---------------
1 | ABC123 | 10 |
  ---------------
2 | ABC123 | 50 |
  ---------------
3 | ABC123 | 300 |
  ---------------
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see there are three identical strings, yet they all have different values. I just want to compare values between these identical strings, and then keep the string with the biggest value and delete its analogues.</p>

<p>This was just a simple example. There are tons of identical strings in my file which all have different values. And (somehow) the biggest one is the optimal one, so I really don't need the rest of them.</p>

<p>And finally my question is, what am I supposed to do to accomplish this? Any functions, formulas, anything?</p>

<p>I'd really appreciate your help.
Thanks a lot!</p>

<p><strong>Method summary:</strong> </p>

<p>The method takes a keyword and then search for that keyword at www.clinicaltrials.com by using the website URI. For instance: </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ALL&amp;Search=Search&amp;displayxml=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ALL&amp;Search=Search&amp;displayxml=true</a>. </p>

<p>This URI will bring up all clinical studies stored at Clinical Trials as XML. Because of the large amount clinical data they have only 20 studies at each page. So to get to the next page you have to add <em>&amp;pg=2</em>, to go to page two. My codes parses trough all the pages and converts each page to a C# objects. </p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>The problem is, when it gets to page 13 it crashes with the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>InvalidOperationException was unhandled: There is an error in XML document (155, 23)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I copy the XML for page 13, 12 or any other page close to page 13 into an XML validator it says its fine. And when I search the xml myself i can't find any errors. I was thinking maybe memory is full, but after 240 objects? If i search for a keyword that retrives less then 13 pages of results it works.  </p>

<p>So, I'm quite confused.  Thanks so much for your help.</p>

<p>Regards,
Rebecca</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thank you for your advice and feedback on my code.  I was able to solve the problem by adding hashCode() to ClusterKey, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    } public boolean equals(Object otherKey) {
        return this.firstKey == ((ClusterKey) otherKey).firstKey &amp;&amp; this.secondKey == ((ClusterKey) otherKey).secondKey;
    } public int hashCode() {
        return (int) firstKey + secondKey;
    }

<p>Also, I don't get this bit:</p>

  <p>When you sign in to Chrome and enable sync, Chrome keeps your information secure by using your Google Account credentials to encrypt your synced passwords.

<p>Deleting rules that are not useful and then exporting only selected rules leads to hardcoding of the loaction of the XML file in the rule set . 
For Example, If my xml file is stored in location X in my local directory,
the rulesets become

I need help for my application, I'm using a <code>ExpandableListView</code> with <strong>3 different</strong> groups, 2 groups with <strong>static</strong> items and a group with items that it should to <strong>update</strong> after a <code>AsyncTask</code>.
When I run the application the first time, the group with dynamic items is <strong>empty</strong>, instead the second time is <strong>visible</strong>. How I do to update in real time dynamic items?
My application is structured in this way, I have a main activity that instantiates the <code>ExpandableListView</code>, an other class that executes the <code>AsyncTask</code> and then I have a class that extends <code>BaseExpandableListAdapter</code>. I tried to use the method <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> in main activity, but it does not work.

<ul>
<li>ProjectA (Enterprise Application - the one used by clients)

<li>ProjectA-ejb</li>
<li>ProjectA-war</li>

<li>ProjectB-jpa (java class library)

<p><strong>ProjectB</strong> contains some authorization/management beans that will be used by many other projects (even on other servers) so they are remote. Later I will add a management webapp to it, so this is why it's an enterprise app and not a simple ejb project.<br/>
<strong>ProjectA</strong> instead is a complete enterprise project with ejb+webapp (and I could later add other enteprise projects ProjectC, D, etc) that uses ProjectB services.<br/>
Inside <strong>ProjectB-jpa</strong> are stored entites shared between management project (ProjectB) and single webapps (ProjectA and others).<br/>
Inside <strong>ProjectB-ejbClient</strong> class library I've writter the qualifier as this:
<br/></p>

<pre><code>@Qualifier
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER})
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Documented
public @interface RemoteManagement {    
}
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
and a bean factory producer as this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ManagementBeanFactory {
    @Produces
    @RemoteManagement
    @EJB(lookup = ""java:global/ProjectB/ProjectB-ejb/Management!it.mgmnt.ejb.ManagementRemote"")
    private ManagementRemote managementRemote;
}
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
The beans.xml file is a plain JavaEE 7 template-like with attributes <code>version=""1.1"" bean-discovery-mode=""all""</code> declared (I took it from Oracle tutorial).<br/>
Now, in ProjectA-ejb I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class AccessControl {
    public final static String APPLICATION_CODE = ""GDS"";
    @Inject 
    @RemoteManagement
    //@EJB(lookup = ""java:global/ProjectB/ProjectB-ejb/Management!it.mgmnt.ejb.ManagementRemote"")
    private ManagementRemote mr;

    public String performLogin(final String username, final String password) {
        String uid = mr.authenticate(username, password, APPLICATION_CODE);
        return uid;        
    }

    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
Projects are both deployed without any problem but when performLogin is called from the web tier I got a <code>javax.ejb.EJBException</code> with root cause <code>org.jboss.weld.exceptions.NullInstanceException: WELD-000044 Unable to obtain instance from null</code>.
<br/>
I've debugged step-by-step and I found that <code>AccessControl.mr</code> is a reference to the remote bean and it's not null, so producer is generating a proxy to make the call.<br/>
If I swap <code>@Inject @RemoteManagement</code> annotatin with commented one <code>@EJB(lookup = ""..."")</code> everything works flawlessly.<br/>
I suspect that Weld is creating a proxy on <code>AccessControl.mr</code> property to the <code>ManagementBeanFactory.managementRemote</code> property that, I think, is null.<br/>
With debugger I discovered that the ""toString()"" references (printed on <code>AccessControl.mr</code>) are completely different between @Inject and @EJB and seems that @EJB has different ""type"" of generated proxy.<br/>
The strange thing is that I used to do the same thing with JBOSS AS 7.1.1Final using JavaEE 6 beans.xml (has different namespaces, etc) and it worked like a charm.
<br/>
I don't know if I missed something in the producer/qualifier or if something has changed from JavaEE 6 to 7 (needed because I use a lot of stateless JSF views and @ViewScoped beans) on this field...or even if it's a Glassfish/Weld flaw (as I suspect).
I don't want to use Wildfly AS before it goes final and I would try to keep development and runtime in sync (same appserver) to have a more predictable environment.
<br/>
If you even find errors or have suggestions in project structure/organization, please let me know. I'm glad to receive hint to get better project style.
<br/>
Thank you for your help.</p>

Q2. It makes sense to me to have the data retrieval methods set up in the classes created by XCode for the entities in the data model.

<p>You are to write a program that draws a square composed of # signs onto a grid. The user will enter
the size (in the length of the sides), the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate of the bottom-left corner
of the square on the grid as command-line parameters to program, in that order. </p>

<p>In other words, the
three values will be stored in the String array args at the start of the program, as the values args[0],
args[1], and args[2]. You can use the command Integer.parseInt() to convert the String into an
int. Assume that the input parameters are valid ints. </p>

<p>For example, in the Interactions pane of DrJava:
run Que s ti on 2 5 1 1
means that we want to draw a square with side length 5 whose bottom-left corner is at position (1, 1).
All distances in this question are in number of characters. By default, the program should print the
square onto a 15x15 grid, but if the square wouldn’t fit, the grid has to be extended accordingly.</p>

<p>First, write the code to display the axes properly. </p>

<p>Second, build a solution where the square always fits into the 15x15 grid. </p>

<p>third,  How to extend the program to make it work for larger squares or for squares that are
too much shifted to fit into the 15x15 grid.</p>

<p>There's ultimately going to be more logic at play than what's above, but it's just not written yet. Suffice it to say that the ""object1"" and ""object2"" parts will actually be in an iterator.</p>

<p>Inside that iterator, I want to check for the presence of an ID before adding another object to the array.

<ol>
<li><p>Keep a separate simple array of just the IDs. So instead of only relying on the <code>objects</code> array, I simply check <code>inArray</code> (or plain JS equivalent) for a simple ""objectIDs"" array that is used only for this purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Iterate through my existing data object and compare my <code>""foobar_1""</code> needle to each <code>objects[i].id</code> haystack</p></li>

<p>I feel that #1 is certainly more efficient, but I can't help wondering if I'm missing a function that would do the job for me. A #3, 4, or 5 option that I've missed! CPU consumption is somewhat important, but I'm also interested in functions that make the code less verbose whether they're more cycle-efficient or not.</p>

<p>I am using sockets to implement an instant messaging app with a chat roulette feature.
If 2 clients are talking, and 1 disconnects, then the other needs to know.
A disconnection includes both graceful and ungraceful disconnections (i.e. your phone dying).</p>

<p><strong>Current Strategy</strong></p>

<p>Off the top of my head, my strategy is to have each client ping the server about every 5 seconds (which serves as a kind of ""heartbeat"").  If a client misses an interval, the server will let the other client know.  </p>

<p><strong>Concerns</strong></p>

<p>This doesn't seem like it will scale very well.  The server would have to use a listener per client.  And having thousands or millions of clients ping the server sounds pretty brutal. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How can I determine client disconnection relatively quickly while being able to scale?</p>

<p>All i want to do is use the cache service for storing session state. Not holding anything big - an account id (int) and isParent (bool). That's it.</p>

<p>I followed <a href=""http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/web-sites/session-state-caching/"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a> and it all works fine on my localhost, but as soon as I deploy basically nothing gets held in cache. I know it's being lost, because it's inserting null when i submit a form which takes values from the cache when creating a new DB record. This form submission happens literally straight after I login and set the initial values, so I can't imagine the objects are expiring.</p>

<p>I'm using the basic cache offering (128mb). Expiration policy is absolute, and expiry time is 40 mins. Eviction is enabled. My user login is handled by simplemembership - <code>WebSecurity.CurrentUserId</code> seems to persist fine but I guess that's because it's being held in a cookie.</p>

On my desktop - users can stay logged in across browser sessions. But accessing the same site from within my iPhone - I can log in via FB Connect - but when my browser session ends - so too does my logged in user. Especially annoying on an iPhone because it does take a while to go through the whole connect process.</p>

<p>I assume it has to do with cookies not surviving browser sessions. Is there something I can do to keep my users logged in when using their iPhone browsers?</p>

"25879614","1","","","2014-09-16 22:50:06","","0","260","<p>I'd like to use the following HTTP module to rewrite a request to another folder's file:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyHttpModule : IHttpModule
{
    public void Init(HttpApplication application)
    {
        application.BeginRequest += (sender, e) =&gt;
            {
                var httpApplication = (HttpApplication)sender;
                var httpContext = httpApplication.Context;

                if (httpContext.Request.Url.ToString().Contains(""styles/style.css""))
                {
                    httpContext.RewritePath(""~/some/other/folder/styles/style.css"");
                }
            };
    }

    public void Dispose() { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code seems to work as expected (i.e. after <code>RewritePath()</code> <code>Request.Url</code> contains the rewritten URL) but I get a 403.2 forbidden error when I try to open styles/style.css.</p>

<p>When I open the rewritten URL (taken from <code>Request.Url</code> after the <code>RewritePath()</code> call) in a browser I correctly see the CSS file (i.e. I open something like styles/style.css and get what's under some/other/folder/styles/style.css).</p>

<p>Failed Request Tracing also shows that my module does the correct rewrite. This the trace entry corresponding to the error:</p>

<pre><code>82.  -NOTIFY_MODULE_END
ModuleName ManagedPipelineHandler 
Notification MAP_REQUEST_HANDLER 
fIsPostNotificationEvent false 
NotificationStatus NOTIFICATION_CONTINUE 

83.  -MODULE_SET_RESPONSE_ERROR_STATUS 
ModuleName IIS Web Core 
Notification MAP_REQUEST_HANDLER 
HttpStatus 403 
HttpReason Forbidden
HttpSubStatus 2 
ErrorCode Access is denied. (0x80070005) 

84.  -SECURITY_DENIED_BY_ACCESS_FLAGS 
CurrentFlags 512 
NeededFlags 1
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can tell it requires AccessRead (1) permissions but got AccessScript (512) (see <a href=""http://forums.iis.net/t/1160629.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this topic</a>). This puzzles me because I guess the latter is a higher permission level than the former.</p>

<p>Changing file system permissions on the folder of the file in question doesn't seem to have an effect (even giving full control to Everyone won't help). The app pool is using my user, an admin account, as its identity (but leaving it on AppPoolIdentity isn't helping either).</p>

<p>The file's folder has a Web.config that contains this if it matters:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;handlers accessPolicy=""Script,Read""&gt;
  &lt;add name=""StaticFile"" path=""*"" verb=""*"" modules=""StaticFileModule"" preCondition=""integratedMode"" resourceType=""File"" requireAccess=""Read"" /&gt;
&lt;/handlers&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Doing the same rewrite with the IIS URL Rewrite module works.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I noticed that creating a physical folder under the original, not existing path (i.e. ~/styles/style.css), just containing a Web.config with the above handler declaration (plus the common ceremony around it with system.webServer etc.) makes the error go away. Naturally this is not a solution for me but at least it gives some hint.</p>

<p><strong>Update2:</strong></p>

<p>I did some tests with an empty ASP.NET app. Setting up only the module in the root Web.config and not adding a Web.config to the Styles folder worked.</p>

<p>Adding this to the root Web.config (this is something from the original app's Web.config) caused the error. Ha!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;handlers accessPolicy=""Script""&gt;
  &lt;clear /&gt;
&lt;/handlers&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Modifying the accessPolicy to ""Script, Read"". Resolved the issue...</p>

<p>Could somebody explain this please?</p>

<p>Of course, Users can vote submission Up or Down. To record this, I created a middle table, SubmissionVote, which contain the following fields:</p>

<pre><code>submissionId (int)
userId (int)
score (enum: up/down)
</code></pre>

<p>Here are my mappings:</p>

<p><strong>Submission</strong></p>

<pre><code>Id(x =&gt; x.Id);
...
References(x =&gt; x.User).Column(""userID"").Not.LazyLoad();
HasMany(x =&gt; x.Votes).Cascade.All().KeyColumn(""submissionID"").Table(""SubmissionVote"").Not.LazyLoad();
Table(""Submission"");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>User</strong></p>

<pre><code>Id(x =&gt; x.Id);
...
HasMany(x =&gt; x.Submission).Inverse().KeyColumn(""userID"").Cascade.All();
HasMany(x =&gt; x.SubmissionVotes).KeyColumn(""userID"").Cascade.All().Table(""SubmissionVote"");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>SubmissionVote</strong></p>

<pre><code>Map(x =&gt; x.Vote).Column(""score"");
CompositeId().KeyProperty(x =&gt; x.Submission.Id, ""submissionID"").KeyProperty(x =&gt; x.User.Id, ""userID"");
References(x =&gt; x.Submission).Column(""submissionID"");
References(x =&gt; x.User).Column(""userID"");
</code></pre>

<p>Since the middle table in my DB has a score field, I created the SubmissionVote class the represent it. The user and submission fields in that class are many-to-one relationships to their respective classes.</p>

<p>The problem is this: the SubmissionVote class need to have an ID property, otherwise NHibernate produces an error. That should not be the case, since the ID for a SubmissionVote is a composite-id, as represented in the mapping.</p>

<p>I can live with, but it causes another problem. When I try to save a submission with a few SubmissionVotes in it, using session.SaveOrUpdate(submission), I get this error a ArrayOutOfBounds exception thrown by MySQL, like in this question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1203078/how-can-i-use-a-composite-id-with-a-class-as-the-id-field-in-fluent-nhibernate"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1203078/how-can-i-use-a-composite-id-with-a-class-as-the-id-field-in-fluent-nhibernate</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the NHibernate logs, I can see the query that is sent to MySQL.</p>

<pre><code>14:53:07.358 [9] DEBUG ... - Building an IDbCommand object for the SqlString: INSERT INTO `SubmissionVote` (score, submissionID, userID) VALUES (?, ?, ?)

14:53:07.367 [9] DEBUG NHibernate.Type.Int32Type - binding '0' to parameter: 3
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently, NHibernate tries to include a default ""ID"" value ('0') to the query (probably the ID property I added to the SubmissionVote).</p>

<p>Are the two problems related? How can I solve this problem?</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Here is my (partial, but relevent) schema produced by NHibernate.</p>

Inside it I am using <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> to place two types of images <code>img1</code> and <code>img2</code> where both have same width <code>W</code> but <code>img1</code> is shorter than <code>img2</code> i.e. <code>H1&lt;H2</code>. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YNAPL.png"" alt=""the two candidate images""></p>

<p>They should be placed within the outer svg in a rectangle with dimensions <code>W</code>x<code>H2</code> at position <code>(x,y)</code> and the shorter one (<code>img1</code>) should be aligned vertically at the bottom of this rectangle like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MOOnR.png"" alt=""both images overlayed""></p>

<p>This sounds like a job for <code>viewBox</code> &amp; <code>preserveAspectRatio</code> so I tried creating a nested <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element with dimensions <code>W</code>x<code>H2</code> (the larger of the 2 heights) at position <code>(x,y)</code> and depending on the image dynamically added each time, the layout (here shown with both images) would be:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LWDxG.png"" alt=""overall SVG layout with both images""></p>

<p>Sample code with W=35, H1=19, H2=88, x=100, y=200:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>&lt;svg...&gt; &lt;!--outer SVG--&gt;
    &lt;svg width=""35"" height=""88"" x=""100"" y=""200"" viewBox=""0 0 35 88"" preserveAspectRatio=""xMidYMax meet""&gt; &lt;!-- nested SVG--&gt;
        &lt;image xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""img1_OR_img2"" width=""35"" height=""CORRESPONDING_img_HEIGHT""&gt;&lt;/image&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt; &lt;!-- end of nested SVG--&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;!-- end of outer SVG--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The problem is that the height of the nested svg is ignored and it's the height of the <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> that defines the height of the rectangle. So no matter what vertical alignment I ask for through <code>preserveAspectRatio</code> in the nested svg, in the case of the shorter image <code>img1</code> it will not make a difference since the rectangle is already the height of the <code>img1</code>. If I have <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> always have the larger height <code>H2</code>, then the smaller image <code>img1</code> appears vertically aligned in the middle.</p>

<p>Should I be using a whole different substructure instead of a nested svg or am I misusing the <code>viewBox</code>/<code>preserveAspectRatio</code> combo?</p>

<p>Note: regarding the topic <code>viewBox</code> &amp; <code>preserveAspectRatio</code>, I used <a href=""http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-coordinate-systems/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> which is the best I've found online so far (kudos to Sara for an amazing article).</p>

"4660441","1","4866266","","2011-01-11 17:19:21","","2","5622","<p>I have an application which needs to load data from a remote server (businesses by location) and display them on a map.  The feed from the server is XML based.  I have successfully done an implementation of this but wondered if I could make my life a bit easier.</p>

<p>Currently, I am using Google's GDataXML library, I have implemented a library for getting remote data in the background and it calls me back when complete or during loading if I want.</p>

<p>When the full data has been loaded, I traverse the document and convert the different levels to be an object, adding that object to an NSMutableArray (as I want to do lazy loading so I want to add as more is requested) and then passing that array to the next bit of my app that then interprets and pins/annotates the map for me.</p>

<p>Example XML data (abstracted):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;businesses&gt;
  &lt;business&gt;
    &lt;name&gt; Fred Bloggs and Co &lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;address&gt; 123 No Street, Nowhere &lt;/address&gt;
    &lt;town&gt; Somesville &lt;/town&gt;
    &lt;county&gt; Someshire &lt;/county&gt;
    &lt;postcode&gt; XX11 1XX &lt;/postcode&gt;
  &lt;/business&gt;
  ..... more records but you get the idea .....
&lt;/businesses&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Example storage object (abstracted)</p>

<pre><code>-- businessrecord.h --

@interface BusinessRecord : NSObject {
    NSString *name;
    NSString *address;
    NSString *town;
    NSString *county;
    NSString *postcode;
}

@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *address;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *town;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *county;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *postcode;

@end

-- businessrecord.m --

@implementation BusinessRecord

@synthesize name, address, town, county, postcode;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Right, so you can probably guess that i'm manually parsing each XML element in each node and manually transferring them to the BusinessRecord object.</p>

<p>This is particularly time consuming as I have to write three or more lines of code in different places for each property.</p>

<p>Under GDataXML you access each element with something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *businesses = [[[xmlRoot elementsForName:@""businesses""] objectAtIndex:0] elementsForName:@""business""];
NSMutableArray *businessList = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity: businesses.count];

for (int i=0; i&lt;businesses.count; i++) {
    GDataXMLElement *business = [businesses objectAtIndex: i];
    BusinessRecord *busRec = [[BusinessRecord alloc] init];
    busRec.name = [[[bus elementsForName:@""name""] objectAtIndex:0] stringValue];
    .... etc for each element ...
    [businessList addObject: busRec];
    [busRec release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This all seems extremely long winded to me, there must be a better way of doing this?</p>

<p>What I want to end up with is everything in my XML at the level ""business"" in some kind of random access array, I don't want to individually specify each element.</p>

<p>Ideally, something like in PHP where you can just have a sequential array containing associative arrays like:</p>

<pre><code>$businessList = Array(
  Array(
    ""name"" =&gt; ""Fred Bloggs and Co"",
    ""address"" =&gt; ""123 No Street"",
    ""town"" =&gt; ""Sometown"",
    ""county"" =&gt; ""Someshire"",
    ""postcode"" =&gt; ""XX11 1XX""
  )
);
</code></pre>

<p>So i'm guessing I need to write a wrapper class that can interpret a specific element and get all its sub elements right (ie, enumerate the elements and then work on them).</p>

<p>What do I store this in? NSDictionary?</p>

<p>Maybe something like (pseudo code):</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *businesses = [[[xmlRoot elementsForName:@""businesses""] objectAtIndex:0] elementsForName:@""business""];
NSMutableArray *businessList = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
[xmlBreakerUpper breakUpXMLAtElement: businesses addToMutableArray: &amp;businessList];
</code></pre>

<p>Has anyone any experience with GDataXML and can help me with enumeration as I can't follow the sparse documentation.</p>

<p>I'm not totally attached to GDataXML at this stage, i've only two classes that count on it so if there's a better way.</p>

<p>I am in control of the server output but the client has a preference for XML for other data access API's they may or may not want to implement later.</p>

<p>I don't need to send XML back to the server at this stage, the requests are HTTP GET based at present but may become POST later when people fill in forms.</p>

<p>All help or pushes in the right direction greatfully received.</p>

<ul>
<li>on the play store (and the official launcher) the scrolling animation stops and is kept in sync with the touch.</li>

<p>the code that i wrote wanting to achieve this result is : </p>

<pre><code>foreach ($result as $row) {
  $data[$row-&gt;headline_id]= array( 
    'headline_name' =&gt; $row-&gt;headline_name ,
    'score' =&gt; $row-&gt;score,
  );
  $data[$row-&gt;headline_id]['questions'][] = array (
      'question_id'=&gt;$row-&gt;question_id ,
      'question_name'=&gt;$row-&gt;question_name ,
      'choice_0' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_0 ,
      'choice_1' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_1 ,
      'choice_2' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_2 ,
      'choice_3' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_3 ,
      'choice_4' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_4             
  );  
}
</code></pre>

<p>the problem with it, it only shows the last question in each headline , in each loop in the questions array the array are not appended they overwrite each other </p>

<hr>

<p>if i want to get it to work i have to delete i have to delete the lines for the score and headline_name , the code will be like this </p>

<pre><code>foreach ($result as $row) {

  $data[$row-&gt;headline_id]['questions'][] = array (
      'question_id'=&gt;$row-&gt;question_id ,
      'question_name'=&gt;$row-&gt;question_name ,
      'choice_0' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_0 ,

      'choice_2' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_2 ,
      'choice_3' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_3 ,
      'choice_4' =&gt; $row-&gt;choice_4 
  );  

}

<p>i want a solution to solve it with writing the headline_name and the score in the array</p>

<p>The datacontext of mainPage is an instance of Class A.</p>

<p>My question is:
When status is changed, the text of textbox is changed, but the <code>OnFilestatusPropertyChanged</code> method only was called once when <code>Usercontrol</code> is loaded. Why?

How do i build my micro operating system, with linux kernel, its all about me?</p>

<p>Step 1: Collect materials</p>

<p>a) some existing and working images so that we can wrap the file-system and directory tree
<a href=""http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/</a>  (they are built in images, so inside it has all the directory skeleton)</p>

<p>b) make a directory skeleton, where you can put all those such as following by copy and paste with original materials form above (/tmp/myOS/):</p>

<pre><code>/
/boot &lt;-- here goes the grub and lilo and boot loader
/tmp
/lib  &lt;-- here goes the kernel
/root
/etc etc
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2: Build kernel</p>

<pre><code>1) Download linux kernel: www.kernel.org

2) Setup the kernel and build it
make menuconfig
save it as .config
apply make or make -j3

3) install processor emulator
yum -y install qemu nasm

4) run it
qemu -m 124M -kernel /tmp/myKernel/../zImage
</code></pre>

<p>Step 3: Attach kernel &amp; Directory skeleton</p>

<pre><code>1) compiled/builded kernel was created copy that and paste it to /tmp/myOS/lib/
2) make sure the directory and grub/lilo/bootloaders are fine tunned
3) keep on testing..., should work hoping

<p>An example:</p>

<pre><code>Pattern p = Pattern.compile(""[abc]def|daniel|chris|\\s+"");
Set&lt;Character&gt; first = getFirstSet(p);

<p>The set <code>first</code> should contain the following elements:</p>

<p>Any ideas?  I'm well aware that I could construct the DFA myself and determine the relevant states that way, but I'd like to avoid that kind of hassle (read: it's not worth that much to me).

<p>The user enters the information by answering a set of questions on a form consisting of text boxes, &amp;c.&#160; The answers are used to create an array of string literals, the elements of which are concatenated to form a single string. This string is then presented at the end of the page for the user to copy and then to paste on to the social-network page.</p>

<p>Hitherto this has been done by placing the string (using <code>document.getElementById('divName').innerHTML</code>) in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> set up for the purpose. That's fine: works in all five browsers and even on the Iphone.</p>

<p>Now, in order to make it easier for the user to make minor changes to the report before posting it (and to make it easier to copy), I want to be able to place the report not in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> but in a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> part of the input form. This too is fine: works in Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari – even on the Iphone – but...</p>

<p>With some inevitability the only browser on the whole parade ground marching in step – MSIE – cannot handle it. It puts the information in the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>– minus all the line feeds.
The array is initialized:</p>

<pre><code>function createReport() { // [0] and [21] are constant.
    outReportArray[0] = 'E M E R G E N C Y' + horizLine;
    for (i=1 ; i&amp;lt;outReportArray.length ; i++) {
        outReportArray[i] = '';
    }
    outReportArray[21] = 'Thank you.';
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Global variable <code>horizLine</code> is a sequence of m-rules (<code>&amp;#8212;</code>) with a line feed at each end.)</p>

<p>As the user progresses through the form, the array is updated:</p>

<pre><code>outReportArray[element] = label + value + (underLine ? horizLine : '&amp;#13;&amp;#10;');
</code></pre>

<p>(The following also have been tried for generating the line feed: <code>'\n', '\r\n', '\r', '&amp;#13;', '&amp;#10;'</code>)</p>

<p>The output string is continually rebuilt and pasted to the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> so that when he arrives at the foot of the form he presses an ‘update’ button and is simply transferred to the &lt;<code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>outReportStr = '';  // Initialize the output string.
// Build the output string from the output array.
for (i=0 ; i&lt;outReportArray.length ; i++) {
    outReportStr += outReportArray[i];
}
// Populate the &lt;textarea&gt; 'outbox'.
document.getElementById('outbox').innerHTML = outReportStr;
</code></pre>

<p>Normally the content of the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>E M E R G E N C Y
———————————
Name: John Doe
Land-line: (213) 555 1234
Cell-phone: (213) 555 1235
E-mail: JDoe@aol.com
———————————
Location of animal now:
Washington (St Landry Parish), La
———————————
&amp;c.
</code></pre>

<p>(There’s more to it but this demonstrates the layout required in the output.)</p>

<p>In Internet Explorer, however, each line feed is replaced by a single space:</p>

<pre><code>E M E R G E N C Y ——————————— Name: John Doe Land-line: (213) 555 1234 Cell-phone: (213) 555 1235 E-mail: JDoe@aol.com ——————————— Location of animal now: Washington (St Landry Parish), La ——————————— &amp;c.
</code></pre>

<p>My question is this: how do I make Internet Explorer include the required line feeds in the innerHTML transferred to <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> 'outbox'?</p>

<p>(I have tried creating a textNode consisting of the innerHTML and then appending it as a child to the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>;  no dice: what I then get are all the character-entity codes (<code>&amp;#...</code>) instead of the characters themselves.)</p>

<p>I'm very much an amateur at this game so, quite apart from not wanting to impose anything more complicated than HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the user, I don't want to get involved with complicated add-ins and proprietary libraries. A front seat at the pearly gates to any-one that can help me solve this problem!</p>

<h3>The opener re-bids</h3>

<p>First let me express sincere thanks to all that responded to my question.  I had had some doubt of even getting a response, never mind one so quick.</p>

<p>Your insightful answers not only solved my problem but taught me quite a bit about the languages I'm deploying way above my pay grade &#8211; even of one I've never used!</p>

<p>@Kolink and @JayC told me to use <code>.value</code> rather than <code>.innerHTML</code> (and Kolink was quite right to adopt a tone of admonishment).  Although I was aware of <code>.value</code> as part of the process of transferring data from an input element to the program, it had not even occurred to me that it might be written to: d'oh! I believe is the term.</p>

<p>Thank you, @RobG also, for your account of the use of <code>\u</code> codes;  when it came to using <code>.value</code> vice <code>.innerHTML</code>, that was an important part of the solution.</p>

<p>@deceze recommended, indeed pleaded, that I learn 'Markdown' (which I always thought was something retailers applied to merchandise they were putting in to the clearance sale).  He didn't say whether that was for my benefit or for his as a possible respondent but, searching for it on Google, I found a very interesting alternative to the jEdit I use, its strength being that the 'code' (the Markdown version of the text) is legible by a human, which must make it much simpler to edit.  Thank you, deceze, I'll look in to that in due course (I've even tried coding this message in it);  for the time being, not to the best of my knowledge having Perl to hand, I shall have to stick with what I (<em>almost</em>) know.</p>

<p>And, naturally, you all qualify for a front seat at the pearly gates.  Thank you all for making my first visit to such a forum both fruitful and enjoyable.</p>

<p>What I want:</p>

<pre><code>

   ID | SomeCol1 | SomeCol2 | Fish | Cat
   -------------------------------------
   1      foo        bar       baz   boz
   2      foo2       bar2      baz2  boz2
</code></pre>

<p>What I have:</p>

<pre><code>select
  tblA.id as ""ID"", 
  tblB.someCol as ""SomeCol1"",
  tblD.someOtherCol as ""SomeCol2""
from TableA tblA
inner join TableB tblB on tblA.fkId1=tblB.id
inner join TableC tblC on tblA.id=tblC.fkId2
inner join TableD tblD on tblC.fkId8=tblD.id
inner join TableE tblE on tblC.fkId9=tblE.id
</code></pre>

<p>This correctly gives me the first 3 columns.  </p>

<p>This separate query gives me the correct column/values for 'Fish'</p>

<pre><code>select tblE.someCol as ""Fish""
from TableA tblA
inner join TableB tblB on tblA.fkId1=tblB.id
inner join TableC tblC on tblA.id=tblC.fkId2
inner join TableD tblD on tblC.fkId8=tblD.id
inner join TableE tblE on tblC.fkId9=tblE.id
where tblD.someOtherColumn = 'Fish';
</code></pre>

<p>I would make a similar one for cat, using the same tables.</p>

<p>However if I try to combine the queries by nesting the selects like so I would obviously get ""The single-row subquery returns more than 1 row) error.  </p>

<pre><code>select
  tblA.id as ""ID"", 
  tblB.someCol as ""SomeCol1"",
  tblD.someOtherCol as ""SomeCol2"",
  (select tblE.someCol as ""Fish""
    from TableA tblA
    inner join TableB tblB on tblA.fkId1=tblB.id
    inner join TableC tblC on tblA.id=tblC.fkId2
    inner join TableD tblD on tblC.fkId8=tblD.id
    inner join TableE tblE on tblC.fkId9=tblE.id
    where tblD.someOtherColumn = 'Fish'),
  (select tblE.someCol as ""Cat""
    from TableA tblA
    inner join TableB tblB on tblA.fkId1=tblB.id
    inner join TableC tblC on tblA.id=tblC.fkId2
    inner join TableD tblD on tblC.fkId8=tblD.id
    inner join TableE tblE on tblC.fkId9=tblE.id
    where tblD.someOtherColumn = 'Cat')
from TableA tblA
inner join TableB tblB on tblA.fkId1=tblB.id
inner join TableC tblC on tblA.id=tblC.fkId2
inner join TableD tblD on tblC.fkId8=tblD.id
inner join TableE tblE on tblC.fkId9=tblE.id
</code></pre>

<p>So, how would I correctly do this?  Also is there a way to reference the tables only once instead of multiple time as shown above?  *My real-world query is more complex and has more tables to join and 15 or so columns that will have to perform the same logic as the 'Fish' column.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>** UPDATE - I think I figured it out.  I need to create the subquery once using the 'with' command.  I then create subqueries off of that:</p>

<pre><code>
    with v_tbl as (
        select *
        from TableA tblA
        inner join TableB tblB on tblA.fkId1=tblB.id
        inner join TableC tblC on tblA.id=tblC.fkId2
        inner join TableD tblD on tblC.fkId8=tblD.id
        inner join TableE tblE on tblC.fkId9=tblE.id
    ), v_fish as (select name from v_tbl where tblD.someOtherColumn = 'Fish')
    , v_cat as (select name from v_tbl where tblD.someOtherColumn = 'Cat')
    select &ltregular query stuff>...

In their confirmation mail, they get an access link with a secret token, like <code>http://myapp.com/edityourstuff/hdD8sF2m</code> Clicking this link shows them a form in which they can edit the existing data they submitted earlier.</p>

<p>This is not as secure as a username/password combination, but much more convenient and suitable for my situation.</p>

<p>However, I want to make this as secure as possible.</p>

<h2>GET URLs</h2>

<p>If the link containing the secret access token is disclosed, unauthorised people can access the data. My concern here is about shared/public computers.</p>

<p>I was planning to tackle this problem with the following pattern:</p>

<ol>
<li>Access to <code>/edityourstuff/ds8sdfhe</code> via link in email</li>
<li>Start a session, store the secret token in there</li>
<li>redirect to clean <code>/edityourstuff</code> without token</li>
<li>The app now has access to the token in the session and can display the form accordingly. And the URL bar does not show it.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question now is: Do browsers store the initial URL, that immediately redirects to the clean URL in their history? </p>

<p>I know that the different HTTP redirect status codes (301, 302, 303) have different use cases in theory. Is there any information on how different browsers treat the different redirect codes in respect to (not) storing the initial URL in browser history?</p>

It worked properly but after 100 - 150 scans I get a memory issue and the application has to be closed to free the blocked memory.</p>

<p>I was able to determine one point where a problem seems to occur.</p>

<p>To access the scanner I have to open the Datasource using the following imported function:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DllImport(""twain_32.dll"", EntryPoint:=""#1"")&gt; Private Shared Function TwainOpenDatasource(&lt;[In](), Out()&gt; ByVal ApplicationIdentity As DataStructures.twIdentity, ByVal ZeroPointer As IntPtr, ByVal DataType As ITwain.DataGroup, ByVal Data As ITwain.DataArgumentTypes, ByVal Message As ITwain.Message, ByVal ScannerIdentity As DataStructures.twIdentity) As ITwain.ReturnCode
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>And after that I am closing the same Datasource in the intention to free the memory</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DllImport(""twain_32.dll"", EntryPoint:=""#1"")&gt; Private Shared Function TwainCloseDatasource(&lt;[In](), Out()&gt; ByVal ApplicationIdentity As DataStructures.twIdentity, ByVal ZeroPointer As IntPtr, ByVal DataType As ITwain.DataGroup, ByVal Data As ITwain.DataArgumentTypes, ByVal Message As ITwain.Message, ByVal ScannerIdentity As DataStructures.twIdentity) As ITwain.ReturnCode
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that after opening the datasource the application allocates around 1500k memory and on closing deallocates only 1000k.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea what the problem is? Do I have to clear something else by myself? Or is there any possibility to deallocate old memory manually?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>The problem is this.  The explosions spritesheet is 1200x100, made up of 12 100x100 frames.
The explosion animates fine EXCEPT the origin is behaving strange.  I want the explosion to be centered, so I specify 50, 50 as I've done on previous games in the past.  This centers in the Y direction but in the X direction its only moved slightly.  </p>

<p>After some fiddling I noticed that if I put the origin as 600, 50 (half the spritesheets width) it centers correctly.  This makes no sense.  I've used this animation code before and never had this problem.  I've ensured the values are all being passed correctly, and the destination and source rectangles look to be correct...  I am STUMPED!!</p>

<p>I tested Monogame and there is something going on between XNA vs monogame.
I've made this sample for anyone whos interested to download and inspect for themselves.
As you'll see, in the XNA version the black dot is in the middle as it should be, but on the monogame version its way off center.</p>

<p>Not sure whats causing this.  Rectangle or spritebatch.draw differences?  or perhaps its the way the textures are processed using the monogame content project.  Any help is greatly appreciated!!!</p>

<p>To run this you'll need xna 4.0 installed as well as monogame 3.0

When the child actor throws an exception within onFailure method of a future result, the supervisor does not handle the error (I want to restart the child in the case of a ConnectException).</p>

<p>I'm using Akka 2.3.7.</p>

<p>This is the supervisor actor:</p>

<pre><code>class MobileUsersActor extends Actor with ActorLogging {

  import Model.Implicits._
  import Model.MobileNotifications

  override val supervisorStrategy =
    OneForOneStrategy(maxNrOfRetries = 3, withinTimeRange = 1 minute) {

        Restart
      }
    }

  def receive = {
    case Start =&gt; findMobileUsers
  }

  private def findMobileUsers = {
    val notis = MobileNotificationsRepository().find()
    notis.map(invokePushSender)
  }

  private def invokePushSender(notis: List[MobileNotifications]) = {
    notis.foreach { n =&gt;
      val pushSender = context.actorOf(PushSenderActor.props)
      pushSender ! Send(n)
    }
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the child actor:</p>

<pre><code>class PushSenderActor extends Actor with ActorLogging {

  def receive = {
    case Send(noti) =&gt; {
      val response = sendPushNotification(noti) onFailure {
        case e: ConnectException =&gt; throw e
      }
    }
  }

  private def sendPushNotification(noti: MobileNotifications): Future[WSResponse] = {
    val message = ""Push notification message example""
    Logger.info(s""Push Notification &gt;&gt; $message to users "" + noti.users)
    PushClient.sendNotification(message, noti.users)
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to notify sender with an akka.actor.Status.Failure(e) as is suggested <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16095462/akka-futures-exceptions"">here</a>, but did not work, the exception keep unhandled by the supervisor.</p>

<p>As a workaround, I found this way to get it work:</p>

<pre><code>class PushSenderActor extends Actor with ActorLogging {

  def receive = {
    case Send(noti) =&gt; {
      val response = sendPushNotification(noti) onFailure {
        case e: ConnectException =&gt; self ! APIConnectionError
      }
    }
    case APIConnectionError =&gt; throw new ConnectException
  }

  private def sendPushNotification(noti: MobileNotifications): Future[WSResponse] = {
    val message = ""Push notification message example""
    Logger.info(s""Push Notification &gt;&gt; $message to users "" + noti.users)
    PushClient.sendNotification(message, noti.users)

}

<p>I found here some threads with similar problems but i cant figure why this is not working.</p>

<p>My Player: <a href=""http://www.fbnet.org/barra/barra.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbnet.org/barra/barra.php</a></p>

<p>My .htaccess:</p>

<p>my server allow .htaccess changes so its fine.</p>

<p>Then i tested this thing @ my JS file:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

<p>Switched <strong>solution: ""html,flash""</strong> to <strong>""flash,html""</strong> and player works @ IE.</p>

<p>models.py</p>

def customize_media_serving(request, path, document_root=None, show_indexes=False):
    """"""
    Serve audios as static files for html5 audio tag
    """"""
    # here is my custom filter which controls access to this view
    return serve(request, full_path, document_root, show_indexes)

def sound_download(request, sub_folder, filename):
    """"""

    path_to_mp3 = 'media/sound/'

    fsock = open(path_to_mp3+sub_folder+'/'+filename, 'rb')
    response = HttpResponse(fsock, mimetype='audio/mpeg')
    response['Content-Type'] = 'audio/mp3'
    response['Content-Disposition'] = ""attachment; filename=%s"" % \
        (filename.replace(' ', '-'), )
    response['Content-Length'] = \
        os.path.getsize(path_to_mp3+sub_folder+'/'+filename)
    return response
</code></pre>

<p>urls.py</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^sound_download/(?P&lt;sub_folder&gt;[\w-]+)/(?P&lt;filename&gt;[\w\s\.-]+)/$',views.sound_download, name=u'Get lead audios history'),
url(r'^media/sound/(?P&lt;path&gt;[\w\s\./_-]+)$', views.customize_media_serving, {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT, }),
</code></pre>

<p>html template</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- audio is an instance of the model Audio --&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{{ audio.call_date }}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;audio preload=""auto"" controls="""" class=""history_audio_player""&gt;

        &lt;a href=""/sound_download/{{ audio.file_link }}"" class=""audio_download""&gt;
            &lt;img src=""{{ STATIC_URL }}img/download.png"" style=""height:30px;""/&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All this above works fine.</p>

<ol>
<li>Files could be downloaded by the link</li>
<li>Links could be accessed by predefined groups of users </li>
<li>HTML5 audio player is correctly
displayed with all elements of control. The record is played not
only once (you don't need to reload the page). User can operate the
progress bar choosing the time of the audio. Time displays correct
after the playback</li>
</ol>

<p>The only problem I have is when I run </p>

<pre><code>python manage.py collectstatic
</code></pre>

<p>all files are copied in the static dir</p>

<p>The reason for the files are not in common directory 'static' is that they will be uploading during the site is on the fly.</p>

<p>I guess there is a better solution. Mine seems to be not fully correct. It is like a bicycle with the back rectangle wheel: it is moving but something is wrong. I appriciate any suggestions.</p>

<p>P.S. yes, I've read some issues about serving mp3 files and audio tag

"17425568","1","17425660","","2013-07-02 12:15:49","","1","307","<p>Here is my code which should dynamically allocate memory for storing strings:</p>

<pre><code>#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 700

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main()
{
    char **path = NULL;

    path = (char **) malloc(sizeof(char *));

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    {
            path[i] = strdup(""TEST"");
            path = (char **) realloc(path, sizeof(char *));
    }

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    {
            printf(""%s\n"", path[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code breaks on the line where i have reallocated the memory.</p>

<p>According to me the the memory allocated to path on first malloc is as given below:</p>

<pre><code>path -----&gt; |   char *  | // path points to a character pointer which       inturn is pointing to nothing(Dangling).
</code></pre>

<p>So, at this point of time when the program ran the line:</p>

<pre><code>path = (char **) malloc(sizeof(char *));
</code></pre>

<p>path[0] is currently in bounds and we can store starting address of one and only one string at path[0] and path[1] should be out of bounds at this point of time.</p>

<p>So, when the very first time we entered the for loop where we are storing the address of string at path[i] we will be able to that as:</p>

<pre><code>path[0] = strdup(""TEST""); // is in bounds.
</code></pre>

<p>To store another string we need some more memory that path should be pointing.
So i did realloc in the line just below as:</p>

<pre><code>path = (char **) realloc(path, (char *));
</code></pre>

<p>So, according to me path should look like this in memory as below:</p>

<pre><code>path ---------&gt;|old char *|-----&gt;""TEST""
  |-----------&gt;|new char *|-----&gt;(Dangling) // Pointing Nowhere.
</code></pre>

<p>So, now path[1] is also in bounds and we should be able to use that memory location. So i can't figure out why i am getting this Segmentation fault when i run my code:</p>

<pre><code>path = (char **) realloc(sizeof(char *)*8);

form.addUploader({

    $.fn.uploader = function(options) {

<p>It prints exactly the find command I'd like to execute.
However it doesn't execute it correctly.</p>

To keep my code clean I created a download class that I call from my view. It works fine but now I want to provide users with some UI cues about the download.</p>

<p>Let say I have a label and I want to change its text to ""Downloaded"" once the download is over. How one should do that?</p>

<p>here is the code I have:</p>

<p>FileViewController</p>

<pre><code>@IBOutlet weak var downloadLbl: UILabel!

func downloadFile(sender:UIButton!)
    {      
        fileDownloader().download_zip(datastring, destination: path, name: naming, fileis: self.fileId)
    }
</code></pre>

<p>(this is only the important part)</p>

<p>then I have my download function inside a separate class file and I start a DownloadTaskSession and I use the following delegate to observe download completion</p>

<pre><code>func URLSession(session: NSURLSession, downloadTask: NSURLSessionDownloadTask, didFinishDownloadingToURL location: NSURL) {
        println(""session \(session) has finished the download task \(downloadTask) of URL \(location)."")

        FileViewController().downloadLbl.text = ""downloaded""
    }
</code></pre>

<p>the last line: <code>FileViewController().downloadLbl.text = ""downloaded""</code> returns an error: fatal error: unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value.</p>

<p>does someone could help with this?</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>Both proposed solution are working when it comes to create communication between classed but I went for the notification solution because in my case I had to update UI along with background thread progression and using protocol wasn't quite working as expected. The communication was made but updating the UI wasn't working all the time, even after using dispatch_async method to push back the changes on the main thread.</p>

<p>Using the notification system helped as it was easier to implement, managed and use for UI Modifications.</p>

<p>So, when I open <code>host/someurl</code>, application redirects me to <code>host/someurl:defaultparam</code>. This part works well.
But I can't return to url before <code>host/someurl</code> by using 'Back' browser button, because when I returning to host/someurl application redirects me to <code>host/someurl:defaultparam</code> again. I tried changing <code>redirectTo</code> to </p>

<pre><code>history.replaceState(..., host/#someurl:defaultparam);
history.go(0);
</code></pre>

<p>But each redirection reloads the page.</p>

<p>So, how to use ExtJs redirectTo and replace url in history?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I replaced <code>history.go(0);</code> on <code>this.redirectTo('someurl:defaultparam', true);</code>. Now I have promblem when redirecting to some url two or more times in a row</p>

My goal is to optimize this thing <strong>for a single dual-core machine</strong> to achieve maximum throughput.</p>

<p>Currently, I am using some simple lock-free ring buffer (lock-free is possible since I have only one consumer and one producer thread and therefore the pointers are only updated by a single thread).</p>

<pre><code>#define BUF_SIZE 32768

struct buf_t { volatile int writepos; volatile void * buffer[BUF_SIZE]; 
    volatile int readpos;) };

void produce (buf_t *b, void * e) {
    int next = (b-&gt;writepos+1) % BUF_SIZE;
    while (b-&gt;readpos == next); // queue is full. wait
    b-&gt;buffer[b-&gt;writepos] = e; b-&gt;writepos = next;
}

void * consume (buf_t *b) {
    while (b-&gt;readpos == b-&gt;writepos); // nothing to consume. wait
    int next = (b-&gt;readpos+1) % BUF_SIZE;
    void * res = b-&gt;buffer[b-&gt;readpos]; b-&gt;readpos = next;
    return res;
}

buf_t *alloc () {
    buf_t *b = (buf_t *)malloc(sizeof(buf_t));
    b-&gt;writepos = 0; b-&gt;readpos = 0; return b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this implementation is not yet fast enough and should be optimized further. I've tried with different <code>BUF_SIZE</code> values and got some speed-up. Additionaly, I've moved <code>writepos</code> before the <code>buffer</code> and <code>readpos</code> after the <code>buffer</code> to ensure that both variables are on different cache lines which resulted also in some speed.</p>

<p>What I need is a speedup of about 400 %. Do you have any ideas how I could achieve this using things like padding etc? </p>

<p>Since my application contains SWC files which were compiled by another developer, I cannot directly access the ActionScript which creates the URL requests and RTMP connections.</p>

<p>That returns a server error of Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '""tbl_staff""' at line 1'</p>

What I would like one of the fragments to do is to automatically call a method (which launches an activity) whenever the user navigates to it from a tab bar. For example, right now I'm using the on resume() method to launch the activity. I also have a button set up to do it. </p>

<p>However, when I trace it through the debugger, the onResume() is only called when the fragment is first created. I've tried setting the fragment to null and recreating it from the SectionsPagerAdapter, but still none of the lifecycle methods are called. I've also set up a separate method in the fragment to launch  the activity and calling it from the SectionsPagerAdapter before returning the adapter, but that doesn't launch it either - it just shows the display. </p>

<p>As I mentioned, the display has a button which allows the user to launch the activity manually, but that means the user has to press a button twice - once to get to the page, and once to launch the activity. </p>

<p>Is there a solution to this problem?</p>

<p>The piece of code in <code>$http</code> call is just a sample to show what i intend to do. Once my <code>gridOptions2</code> grid is working i will show data that is returned from <code>/api/values</code> call in <code>gridData</code>parameter.

<p>I have a problem that I can't find the answer...</p>

<p>The state is: I have a model called Accessories and I also have a relationship *has_and_belongs_to_many* to a table that connects 2 accessories (self-relationship, columns: accessory_1_id, accessory_2_id). Let's say that the relationship is called by ""exceptions"".</p>

<p>I'm using Formtastic + ActiveAdmin and I need to get this array of accessories by a relationship because in this way Formtastic can detect the current set of ""exceptions"" of an existing object (while editing) and set the checkboxes active automaticaly.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for my english.</p>

I want to break apart every element of this expression (<strong>both operands and operators</strong>) and save them into an array, so that I can send the first operand, the first operator, and the second operand (as parameters of an atomic calculation) to a PHP page (server) and then after getting the server's response, send the second operator and the third operand together with the server's previous reponse in order to perform another atomic operation and so on.</p>

<p>For example, if the initial string is <code>2 +  323*4.5 /5</code>, my array (the result) should look like this:</p>

I have scoured the internet looking for solutions, and I haven't found anything that has worked.<BR>
I really hope someone can help!</p>

<p>I developed a page that I was trying to publish, and it worked fine when I ran it from Visual Studio. However when I used the publish facility (to file-system) within Visual Studio - into my Windows 7 IIS website, I got an error message suggesting my Page directive was incorrect.</p>

<p>I decided to start from the absolute basics and try to publish the contents of a default project and see how I got on with that, but this appears to have the same problem. Here are the steps I went through.</p>

<p>I created a new project which I named ‘pea5’. By default the ‘ASP.NET Web Application’ project type is created with a master page, and an <strong>Account</strong> folder containing some login control pages – neither of which I want, so I deleted the <strong>Account</strong> folder, the <strong>masterpage.aspx</strong>, and the About.aspx page.
This required that I remove the MasterPageFile=""~/Site.master"" from the Page directive in the remaining <strong>Default.aspx</strong> mark-up, and I also had to remove the encapsulating Content tags from the mark-up too, because they only work in master-page configurations. This left me with the following in my <strong>Default.aspx</strong> mark-up file...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Title=""Home Page"" Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" CodeBehind=""Default.aspx.cs"" Inherits=""pea5._Default"" %&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
        Welcome to ASP.NET!
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        To learn more about ASP.NET visit &lt;a href=""http://www.asp.net"" title=""ASP.NET Website""&gt;www.asp.net&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        You can also find &lt;a href=""http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=152368&amp;amp;clcid=0x409""

    &lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The codebehind file contained only an empty Page_Load method, as follows...</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace pea5
{
    public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also trimmed out the authentication, membership, profile and roleManager sections from my <strong>web.config</strong> file, as I didn’t expect I’d need those anymore having previously deleted the login pages. So my <strong>web.config</strong> file looked like this...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;

&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I ran the project, the <strong>Default.aspx</strong> page loaded perfectly. </p>

<p>I then published my project (choosing the filesystem option) into my IIS folder structure, and when I browsed to the <strong>Default.aspx</strong> page using IE, I got the following error.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parser Error Message: Could not load type 'pea5._Default'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would this work perfectly well in Visual Studio, but not in IIS?!
Anyway.
I found another stackoverflow post <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538719/parser-error-message-the-file-testsite-default-aspx-cs-does-not-exist"">Parser Error Message: The file &#39;/TestSite/Default.aspx.cs&#39; does not exist</a> which suggested I would need to change the CodeBehind setting in the Page directive of the markup.</p>

<p>So I changed...</p>

<pre><code>CodeBehind=""Default.aspx.cs""
</code></pre>

<p>...to...</p>

<pre><code>CodeFile=""Default.aspx.cs""
</code></pre>

<p>After another publish, and refresh of my page, I then got the following error in IE.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parser Error Message: The file '/Default.aspx.cs' does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this message rather strange. Surely having published my code into a DLL file in the bin folder, I would no longer need the codebehind in order to load the page.
Sure enough, when I copied the codebehind file <strong>Default.aspx.cs</strong> into my published folder on IIS, the page then worked.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why this is the case?</p>

<p>With this discovery, I was then able to revisit the page I originally developed, begrudgingly accepting the fact that I would have to upload my codebehind file in order to get my page to work.
However this presented a new problem, because the default page on my original solution references a class...</p>

<pre><code>clsLists myords = new clsLists();
myords.LoadList();
</code></pre>

<p>...and the page returned this error message in IE...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compiler Error Message: CS0246: The type or namespace name 'clsLists' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assumed I would also have to add my <strong>clsLists.cs</strong> file to my published folder in order for this to be successfully referenced, so I copied that in too, but I just got the message above again.</p>

<p>If anyone can shed any light on this, I would be eternally grateful.
I am happy to provide any more info on my configuration if required.</p>

<p>Many Thanks,</p>

<p>Dean.</p>

<p>I'll provide more details, if needed, but here is a high-level overview of the problem.</p>

<p>I have 3 clones of a repository:</p>

<ol>
<li>the bare one to push and pull from</li>
<li>one on Machine A</li>
<li>one on Machine B</li>
</ol>

<p>I do 1 last change on Machine A, and I pushed all my changes, and did a pull on both. The problem is, for some reason I don't see my last changes after pulling on Machine B.</p>

<p>There is no message about being ahead of remote on either machine either.</p>

<p>The weird part is:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I do a ""git log"" on the bare repository, the last changes from Machine A will be there</li>
<li>If I do another clone of the bare repository, the changes won't be there. It will only be up to the last changes that Machine B sees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this a server configuration issue or a git issue? I've had this problem for many months now.</p>

<p><code>git branch -a</code> prints:</p>

<p>Machine A:</p>

<pre><code>* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>Machine B: </p>

<p>I have looked over my code and decided to see some more ways to improve the efficiency of it (even if by a millisecond, that would be great). All these data members, methods, useless data creation - we all have been taught to follow guidelines and how to and not to.</p>

<p>Except for loops.</p>

<p>We were always encouraged to use them because they help improve the readability of the code and help the user. THE USER. After I said the definition in my head, this idea came to mind:</p>

{
    //whatever code
}

<p>Let's assume a case where we know the length. This executes the code 100 times, but it does 201 operations that can be omitted to help the machine. What if we copy paste the code 100 times, throwing away the initialization, condition and termination:</p>

This is following the procedure recommended in <a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/362-exporting-csv-and-excel?view=asciicast"" rel=""nofollow"">Railscast 362</a> for making properly encoded exports.</p>

<p>The output opens fine in Excel for Mac 2011, but in Excel 2007 characters like é appear as Ã© because the UTF-8 encoded file is being interpreted by Excel as Latin1.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/155176/1450420"">this answer</a> Excel 2007 will correctly interpret an UTF-8 file if it starts with the right Byte Order Mark (BOM).</p>

<p>Taking at a look at the hex version of the output it seems that indeed it doesn’t have a BOM.</p>

<p>There are a number of sources (like <a href=""http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2009/09/exporting-data-to-csv-and-excel-in-your-rails-app/"" rel=""nofollow"">this Plataformatec blog post</a>) that explain how to add a BOM when rendering the data inline in the controller:</p>

<pre><code>BOM = ""\377\376""
BOM + Iconv.conv('utf-16le', 'utf8', data)
</code></pre>

<p>My question is – is there a way of getting the template correctly interpreted by Excel 2007? Or should I go back to rendering the data in the controller?</p>

The site will preprocess the new articles to find how many matching keywords there are and then update a table which stores the relevant keywords related to the article. This will then be used on the front-end by highlighting keywords within the article and will link users to articles with the same matching keywords.</p>

<p>My concern here is how to do this processing efficiently. My idea is: when processing new articles, it finds the ngrams of the text (up to 3- or 4-gram) and then search each against the keywords table in the MySQL database. This may end up being a slow mess, I haven't tried. But maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way?</p>

<p>It is probably a relatively simple manipulation, but I didnt know how to keep each large of the weights in memory for each data class.

<p>In sql Server it is possible to use these tables inside the trigger in order to have informations on OLD and NEW values. (to make an easy axample: it is possible, inside the trigger to make a ""SELECT * FROM INSERTED"", so to select all the rows in which an update has been made or all the inserted rows in case of an insertion). </p>

<p>The cool thing about this is that it becomes possible to dynamically call the :NEW.value and :OLD.value, if, like in my case, I want to usse the same trigger on more tables (which are also different one another). </p>

<p>If the app on prod points to the ws on test, it works. Also, if the app on test points to the ws on prod, it works. </p>

<p>The behavior I see in the application is that the allocated memory starts to grow and eventually reaches the max limit till the point I start getting out of memory errors. After a while those errors clear and the JVM's allocated heap gets back to around 95% of max. I am assuming a GC occurs at this time although I have not attached a profiler to confirm.  </p>

<p>Is this considered default behavior? What are some of best practises on tuning the cache. What properties can I set in the persistence.xml file to limit the maximum cache size? Can I do it globally or do I need to define it per entity class? </p>

<p>Is it possible to specify column barfo.foo_id as the joined column?</p>

<p>Are you allowed to specify barfoo.id as BarFoo's @Id since you are overriding the getter/seeter of class Foo?</p>

<p>I understand the schematics behind this relationship (or at least I think I do) and I'm ok with them.</p>

<p>The reason I want an explicit id field for BarFoo is exactly because I want to avoid using a joined key (foo _id, bar _id) when querying for BarFoo(s) or when used in a ""stronger"" constraint. (as Ruben put it)</p>

I have no idea what would happen on a Mac.  I believe the user has to copy it to a directory like /Library/Internet\ Plugins/, which is also a non-starter for deployment.  Firefox users would download/run an .xpi.  Chrome is supposed to run a .crx. </p>

    private HashMap validProgramCodes;
    public HashMap getValidProgramCodes() { return validProgramCodes; }

<p>So far so good.  Here's where we get interesting.</p>

<p>I want to put in a timer which every so often generates a new list of valid program codes (never mind how), and calls setValidProgramCodes.</p>

<p>My theory -- which I need help to validate -- is that I can continue using the code as is, without putting in explicit synchronization.  It goes like this:
At the time that validProgramCodes are updated, the value of validProgramCodes is always good -- it is a pointer to either the new or the old hashmap.  <em>This is the assumption upon which everything hinges.</em>  A reader who has the old hashmap is okay; he can continue to use the old value, as it will not be garbage collected until he releases it.  Each reader is transient; it will die soon and be replaced by a new one who will pick up the new value.</p>

<p>Does this hold water?  My main goal is to avoid costly synchronization and blocking in the overwhelming majority of cases where no update is happening.  We only update once per hour or so, and readers are constantly flickering in and out.</p>

I'm trying to find an efficient way to write around 90-120MB a second to external storage on Android without dropping data. In my test I have been getting 18-20MB/s which is the normal speed range for the external storage, however since the heap in Android per process is 140MB-256MB (I get 138MB max using largeHeap flag) it's impossible to make a large enough buffer to keep the data in tact using Java linked list or arrays (the data is generated at 90+MB/s). Is JNI a good option to create a large enough circular array or linked list to keep the data while the file write catches up? I saw another post where someone suggested making a service run in a separate process to get ""extra"" memory . I'm just worried about serialization slowing down the transfer of the generated data. I've deleted all of my code so far in frustration. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>So  in short,

<p>when loading an A object, the generated query look like </p>

    left outer join C c2 on b2.cid=c2.id

<p>The problem is that the Set of Entity D wich are linked to c2 (C Entity loaded via B2 Entity) are not loaded in the same query, resulting in N subsequent queries for each c2 object.</p>

<p>I would expect Hibernate to generate another left outer join for these objects in the first query, as it already does for the first occurence of D.</p>

<p>I am developing an <strong>Android</strong> app that needs a resource from an URL, and uses an <strong>IntentService</strong> to load it.</p>

<p>This app has 3 activities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Activity <strong>W</strong>: welcome activity, has some settings, can open A or B.</p></li>
<li><p>Activity <strong>A</strong>: does some work with the resource from the URL.</p></li>
<li><p>Activity <strong>B</strong>: does some work with the resource from the URL.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Activity <strong>W</strong> starts the <strong>IntentService</strong> automatically so it can begin loading the resource in the background in order to save time. This way when the user reaches activities <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>, wich need the resource, the work is done or almost done.</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong>: when the <strong>IntentService</strong> successfully loads the resource, it doesn't know wich <strong>Activity</strong> is on display. Maybe the user is still on Activity <strong>W</strong>, or maybe it's on <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: how can I <em>easily</em> deliver the resource (it's an ArrayList) from the <strong>IntentService</strong> to Activities <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>, whichever is on display? In case the user is still on <strong>W</strong>, where to put the resource so it can be retrieved later by <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<li>tied_count</li>

<p>Bottom line: do I use correct encoding object (<strong>UTF8</strong>) to get bytes? </p>

<p>Thanks,Pawel</p>

<p>EDIT 1: Let's explain exactly how I get <strong>applicationForm</strong> variable. I do have access to assembly that exposes class with method <strong>GenerateApplicationForm</strong>. That method returns string. However I know, that somewhere behind the scenes, component uses files stored on drive.Content of those files are encoded using UTF-8. So I can't read file directly etc. I only have that string and I know, that originally, UTF-8 encoded file is used.
In client code, the one that used <strong>GenerateApplicationForm</strong> component, I have to convert <strong>applicationForm</strong> variable into stream, cos other components (from another assembly) is expecting a <strong>Stream</strong>. That's where <strong>using....</strong> statement mentioned in question springs into action.</p>

<p>I started to searching for some tool or framework that can turn this task easy. So I've found <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/impromptu-interface"" rel=""nofollow"">Impromptu-Interface</a>. I'm trying to do this with Impromptu-interface:</p>

<pre><code>  public static TContract MapFromDictionary&lt;TContract&gt;(object bindingModel, Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; data) where TContract : class {
  var proxy = new ImpromptuDictionary(data).ActLike&lt;TContract&gt;();
  var properties = Impromptu.GetMemberNames(proxy);
  foreach (var propertyName in properties) {
    object value = Impromptu.InvokeGet(proxy, propertyName);
    Impromptu.InvokeSet(bindingModel, propertyName, value);
  }
  return bindingModel.ActLike&lt;TContract&gt;();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Works like a charm.</p>

<p>And the reverse mapping:</p>

<pre><code>  public static Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; MapToDictionary&lt;TContract&gt;(object source) where TContract : class {
  var proxy = source.ActLike&lt;TContract&gt;();
  var result = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();
  var properties = Impromptu.GetMemberNames(proxy);

  foreach (var propertyName in properties) {
    object value = Impromptu.InvokeGet(proxy, propertyName);
    result.Add(propertyName, value);
  }

  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The question is: Is there any better way to do this ?</p>

I want the user to be able to switch tabs without loosing the data that he entered on the form elements (and I also want to save needless data reloads). And I still want to be able to pass someone a link to a specific tab.</p>

<p>It sounds like ui-extras sticky states should do exactly what I need. Except that I have been remarkably unsuccessful to get it to work.</p>

<p>I studied the <a href=""http://christopherthielen.github.io/ui-router-extras/example/sticky/index.html#/"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a> source code and when I fire up the example I e.g. set a breakpoint with firebug in the constructor of the inventory controller found in <a href=""https://github.com/christopherthielen/ui-router-extras/blob/9519e147ec8f7c0bfad871ec99f77893e71359fe/example/controllers.js#L57"" rel=""nofollow"">Line 57 in controllers.js</a>, I see that the constructor is fired only once. My controller constructors however are fired over and over again and my application behaves pretty much like if sticky states are not existent although if I enable sticky state debugging it tells me that it is doing something (deactivating and reactivating states).</p>

<p>I found someone who stated that sticky states only work with named views in a comment in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25205014/preserve-the-actions-state-of-ui-with-angular-ui-router"">this answer</a>, so I tried to give my view a name but that did not make any difference.</p>

<p>I tried inserting an explicit ""root state"" before my tabs.</p>

<p>I tried to insert the controller either by ng-controller or by controller definition in the states.</p>

<p>The example on github is a nice show off but is way more than minimal and makes it difficult to see what is actually needed and what not.</p>

<p><strong>What would be a minimal example what is needed to get started with sticky states?</strong> (Bonus: What is wrong with my code?).</p>

<p>So we are LIKING the Tumblr post URL.</p>

<p>However the page is not on a Tumbler URL, so FB momentarilly shows the comments box, then replaces it with a Confirm button, which triggers a popup.  Like in the popup, then it allows you to use the normal JS comment that should appear on the button.</p>

<p>You would imagine that the two delegate instances would compare to be equal, just as they would when using the good old named method approach (new Action(MyMethod)). They do not compare to be equal because the .NET Framework provides a hidden closure instance per delegate instance. Since those two delegate instances each have their Target properties set to their individual hidden instance, they do not compare. One possible solution is for the generated IL for an anonymous method to store the current instance (this pointer) in the target of the delegate. This will allow the delegates to compare correctly, and also helps from a debugger standpoint since you will see your class being the target, instead of a hidden class.</p>

<p>I am a bit lost with Transaction management and would like your advice on this topic.</p>

<p>For now, I have put an intermediate layer between my business REST services and the lower services, solely for transaction management purpose.</p>

<p>Currently, my code looks much like that :</p>

<pre><code>@Service 
class PersistanceService&lt;MyBusinessClass&gt;{
   MyBusinessClass load(Long id);
   void save(MyBusinessClass businessObject);
}

@Service 
class BusinessService&lt;MyBusinessClass&gt;{
   void doSomethingOn(MyBusinessClass businessObject);
}

@Service
class TransactionBusinessService&lt;MyBusinessClass&gt;{
   @Transactional
   void doSomethingOn(Long id) {
      MyBusinessClass businessObject = persistanceService.load(id);
      businessService.doSomethingOn(businessObject);
      persistanceService.save(businessObject);
   }
}

@Service
@path(""/foo"")
class RESTService {
   @Path(""/doSomething"")
   void doSomethingOn(Long id) {
      transactionBusinessService.doSomethingOn(id);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think the <strong>TransactionBusinessService</strong> is overkill. I would like ''Spring'' or ''CXF'' to handle transactions for me : I feel that a request is the good granularity to do so : Init an entity manager at the beginning of each request, and commit updates at the end.</p>

<p>I've tried to add the <strong>@Transactional</strong> annotation to the REST methods themselves, but it seem to be ignored, or to conflict with CXF.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you think it is a good idea to delegate the transaction at the request level and not to bother about it anymore ?</li>
<li>How can I have Spring or CXF bind the transaction management to the requests for me ?</li>
</ol>

<li>Sending always a new object: 25 requests/sec</li>
<li>Only object creation rate: 3-4 millions per second (so that is not the bottleneck)</li>

<p>The TcpRequest class is just a dummy class without anything special.</p>

<p>So, if creating object is fast, if sending it over the network is fast ...why on earth is sending a new object over the network so slow?!?!</p>

<p>And if you keep a same object and modify its content before sending it, you will also have high transfer rate ...but fall in the nasty pitfall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When working with object serialization
  it is important to keep in mind that
  the ObjectOutputStream maintains a
  hashtable mapping the objects written
  into the stream to a handle. When an
  object is written to the stream for
  the first time, its contents will be
  copied to the stream. Subsequent
  writes, however, result in a handle to
  the object being written to the
  stream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...which happened to us and caused some hours of debugging before figuring it out. </p>

<p>So basically ...how do you achieve high throughput with sockets? (...I mean, with RMI being a wrapper around it we were already two orders of magnitude higher!)</p>

<p><strong>SOLVED:</strong></p>

<p>By replacing:</p>

<pre><code>out = new ObjectOutputStream(kkSocket.getOutputStream());
</code></pre>

<p>With:</p>

<pre><code>out = new ObjectOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(kkSocket.getOutputStream()))
</code></pre>

<p>The performances are normal again (nearly the same high throughput as with the same object case)</p>

<p>When one drags from a referencing outlet or from an action, IB only shows the methods for a particular Controller. How is it chosen? When one renames the nib, I wonder whether IB saves the connection between the nib and the <code>UIViewController</code>.</p>

These are several of the solutions I've tried but have had no success. The request is still be processed even with no authentication. I'm using version 1.4.3 of Django. Here is my Django view:</p>

<pre><code>@csrf_exempt
def facebook(request):
        if request.user.is_authenticated():
                fb_value= ast.literal_eval(request.body)
                queryset = Poster.objects.all().filter(fb_id__in = fb_value.values())
                data = serializers.serialize('json', queryset, fields = ('picture','fb_id',))
                return HttpResponse(data, 'application/javascript')
        else:
                return HttpResponse(""This user is not authenticated"")
</code></pre>

<p>I sent in the request without authentication, and it still returned results. This is not suppose to happen.</p>

<p>Another solution I tried was from a Django Snippet I found called, <a href=""http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/243"" rel=""nofollow"">view by view basic authentication decorator</a></p>

<p>I made a httpauth.py and copied the code over from the snippet:</p>

<pre><code>from mydjangoapp.httpauth import *

@csrf_exempt
@logged_in_or_basicauth()
def facebook(request):
        fb_value= ast.literal_eval(request.body)
        queryset = Poster.objects.all().filter(fb_id__in = fb_value.values())
        data = serializers.serialize('json', queryset, fields = ('picture','fb_id',))
        return HttpResponse(data, 'application/javascript')
</code></pre>

<p>I sent the request without authentication, and it still returned results. After exhausting all options, I turned to Django's very own @login_required decorator:</p>

<pre><code>from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@csrf_exempt
@login_required
def facebook(request):
        fb_value= ast.literal_eval(request.body)
        queryset = Poster.objects.all().filter(fb_id__in = fb_value.values())
        data = serializers.serialize('json', queryset, fields = ('picture','fb_id',))
        return HttpResponse(data, 'application/javascript')
</code></pre>

<p>Here is more information about my settings.py:</p>

<pre><code>MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',

<p>I have a field in my database called 'star' which is the rating the users have gave the tablet. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 are the options. I need code that works out the average of the 'star' rating from the 'ipad' page and to display an image based on whatever number it is.</p>

<p>All help is greatly appreciated as I am a newcomer and cant seem to find the answer online.

    import flash.events.MouseEvent;

    public class Main extends MovieClip {

        public function Main() {

            var main = new Main_menu();
            var instructions = new instructions();
            //add the movieclip to the stage
            addChild(main);
            // Tell the button to run function on_play.....
            Instructions_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, on_play_button_clicked);

        // what the button does

            addChild(instructions);
        }
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>I can get the movie clip Main to display and since ive added the buttons in the movieclip within flash they display fine and the cursor changes to a finger click icon :-)</p>

<p>What i cant seem to work out is how to get the button with class name: instructions_btn to add the screen : instructions when I click it.</p>

After compiling and testing the results, I used the 'heaptrc' unit to detect some memory leaks. Unfortunately, the program found several ones, which I was not able to fix.</p>

<p>I already looked for solutions via Google and Stack&nbsp;Overflow. There I found constructs like 'try finally' which I used in the program. I reset all dynamic arrays to size of zero to be sure, they are cleaned up. These measures solved some memory leaks, but eight unfreed memory blocks remained.</p>

<p>Then I asked for help in a German Delphi forum, where I got some help, which sadly did not help. For those of you, who understand German, it is in <em><a href=""http://www.entwickler-ecke.de/topic_Free+Pascal+260Memory+Leak+in+Turingmaschine_110108.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Free Pascal 2.6.0. Memory Leak in Turingmaschine</a></em>.</p>

<p>The basic way the program works, is, that the instruction table is created and filled by reading a .txt file. Then the user is asked for the initial data of the tape. In the following loop, the data is changed according to the instruction table until the machine is halted.</p>

<p>Then everything should be cleaned up, but this does not seem to work correctly. If I run the program in a debugger, the program ends with the exitcode '01', which, according to documentation, means 'Invalid function number An invalid operating system call was attempted.'. But that did not help very much either.</p>

<p>If I understand the 'try finally' structure correctly, 'Machine.Free' should be called and executed no matter what happens, so everything should be cleaned up correctly. I learned programming pretty much by trial and error, so I would really like to know, why things do not work correctly, and not just a solution.</p>

<p>Of course I am willing to change my code, if there is some serious design flaw. These are the source code files. The output of 'heaptrc' is in 'memory.txt':</p>

<li><a href=""http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8478"">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8478</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They both implement it in the same way, they first define the following sizes:</p>

<pre><code>#define EVENT_SIZE  ( sizeof (struct inotify_event) )
#define BUF_LEN     ( 1024 * ( EVENT_SIZE + 16 )
</code></pre>

<p>And then they use them in this manner:</p>

<pre><code>length = read( fd, buffer, BUF_LEN );  

if ( length &lt; 0 ) {
    perror( ""read"" );
}  

while ( i &lt; length ) {
    struct inotify_event *event = ( struct inotify_event * ) &amp;buffer[ i ];
    /* some processing */
    i += EVENT_SIZE + event-&gt;len;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we know name is part of <code>struct inotify_event</code> and that it has variable length. So, couldn't the last inotify_event in buffer be truncated?</p>

<p>Suppose there is 1023 inotify_events with a path of 16 bytes and one with a path of 32 bytes. What will happen then? Will the later truncated? Or will the kernel see that it won't fit in the buffer and leave it all altogether?</p>

<p>I am trying to create a live stock ticker, that would simply auto-refresh every few seconds with a value +50, -100, +1512, -25, etc.</p>

<p>I am mostly just stuck on how to get a variable that auto-refreshes per the allotted amount of time.  Should I create a custom component?</p>

<p>Any tips would be appreciated, thanks</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""pull-right""&gt;Ember Stock Market: {{emberStock}} &lt;/span&gt;

App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({   
    emberStock: '0'
});

App.ApplicationRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
    setupController: function(controller){
            this.stockTicker(controller);
    },
    stockTicker: function(controller){
        var self = this;
        var price = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) - 1;

        controller.set('emberStock', price);

        Em.run.later(function(){
            self.stockTicker(controller);
        }, 1000);
    }
});

When I try to run it under IDE, I can get a handle from <code>LoadPackage()</code> but cannot get the class with <code>GetClass()</code> (even though it was RegisterClass()ed within initialization section of the BPL). When I try to run it under Windows, I get ""This application has failed to start because rtl160.bpl was not found"" error, and cannot even load the package.</p>

<p>Module code</p>

<pre><code>type
  TfrModule = class(TFrame)
    Button1: TButton;
    procedure Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
  private
    { Private declarations }
  public
    { Public declarations }
  end;

implementation

{$R *.dfm}

procedure TfrModule.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  ShowMessage('Hello');
end;

initialization
  RegisterClass(TfrModule);
  ShowMessage('Registered');

finalization
  UnregisterClass(TfrModule);
  ShowMessage('Unregistered');
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the initialization section is not being executed because I see no 'Registered' message box.</p>

<p>And the host app is something like this;</p>

<pre><code>var
  hMod: HModule;
  fcMod: TPersistentClass;
  frMod: TFrame;

procedure TForm4.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  hMod := LoadPackage('Module.bpl');
  if (hMod = 0) then Exit;

  fcMod := GetClass('TfrModule');
  if Assigned(fcMod) then
  begin
    frMod := TFrame(fcMod.Create);
    frMod.Parent := Panel1;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Host app was linked with Runtime packages True. Module doesn't have a runtime packages option.</p>

<p>Another question. I saw this basic example all over the net but I plan to add more similar modules and what's going to happen if I try to <code>RegisterClass()</code> the second module's TfrModule class in its initialization? If I need to give different name for each module, there's no point of modules anyway. I mean, if the host must know exactly what the module's classes look like.</p>

<p>My view looks like this (returning all objects in the Countries model):</p>

<pre><code>@api_view(['GET'])
def country_list(request):
    """"""
    List all countries
    """"""
    if request.method == 'GET':

        geoname_ids = request.QUERY_PARAMS.get('geoname_ids')
        queryset = Countries.objects.all()
        paginator = Paginator(queryset, request.QUERY_PARAMS.get('limit'))
        page = request.QUERY_PARAMS.get('page')

        try:
            countries = paginator.page(page)
        except PageNotAnInteger:
            #If page is not an integer, deliver first page.
            countries = paginator.page(1)
        except EmptyPage:
            #If page is out of range
            #Delivery last page of results
            countries = paginator.page(paginator.num_pages)

        serializer_context = {'request': request}
        serializer = PaginatedCountrySerializer(countries, context=serializer_context)
        return Response(serializer.data)
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine.</p>

<p>However I need to return a country with a specific ID, I am trying this:</p>

<pre><code>@api_view(['GET'])
def country_list(request):
    """"""
    List all countries
    """"""
    if request.method == 'GET':

        geoname_ids = request.QUERY_PARAMS.get('geoname_ids')
        queryset = Countries.objects.filter(country_geoname_id=geoname_ids)
        paginator = Paginator(queryset, request.QUERY_PARAMS.get('limit'))
        page = request.QUERY_PARAMS.get('page')

        try:
            countries = paginator.page(page)
        except PageNotAnInteger:
            #If page is not an integer, deliver first page.
            countries = paginator.page(1)
        except EmptyPage:
            #If page is out of range

        serializer_context = {'request': request}
        serializer = PaginatedCountrySerializer(countries, context=serializer_context)
        return Response(serializer.data)
</code></pre>

<p>And this I obviously call the URL with the geonames_ids parameter. It gives an error: <code>global name 'PageNotAnInteger' is not defined</code> referring to then exception. </p>

<p>However, the left 2 icons remain left-aligned, and the right-most icon centers with the remaining space.</p>

<p>Essentially what we need to do is specify the size of each column to be 1/3 (since 3 columns) of the total screen size. I thought this is what GridLayout did, but it appears 'wrap_content' causes this behavior (makes sense), but 'match_parent' causes the first column to fill the entire screen, rather than fill its cell which is the behavior I would have expected.</p>

<p>We seem to have tried every combination of gravity, layout_gravity, etc., but either we fundamentally are doing something wrong, or have found a limitation of the GridLayout.</p>

<p>I have a fixed navbar with the menu items aligned to the right by adding .pull-right to the ul inside the navbar-collapse div.  </p>

<p>When the nav collapses on small screens and you click to open it, the nav items are not 100% width as they should be, but about 30% and pulled to the right.</p>

<p>Have fixed this with:</p>

<pre><code>@media (max-width: 767px) { 
    .navbar-nav.pull-right { float: none!important; }

<p><a href=""http://shareads.us/ThumbnailBrowse/ThumbnailBrowse_ML1_New.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shareads.us/ThumbnailBrowse/ThumbnailBrowse_ML1_New.php</a></p>

<p>When a picture is clicked on, I would like it to take them to the specific member (in the pic) membership page. Links would also work because I have several membership pages, but of course the info is coming from MySQL and does not have specific links.
I do not know how to click a picture and have the member's page come up from MySQL. I've experimented with hundreds of things, including even an actual 

<p><a href=""http://shareads.us/encryptedsignin_1/LitePage/LITEsigninpage.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shareads.us/encryptedsignin_1/LitePage/LITEsigninpage.php</a></p>

<p>Then type in the username (not very convenient for people!) and it creates the Member Page by using a WHERE = ('specific name'):</p>

<p>$sql = ""select username, zoompicture, FastBrowseusernamepage, litetext FROM sharedinfo LEFT JOIN liteheavy ON sharedinfo.id = liteheavy.userID WHERE username = ('WalterJohnson')"";</p>

<p>Which creates:</p>

<p>duh duh duh (follow it through if you wish using the URL at first)</p>

<p>BUT that won't work either! If I had 100 million members I'd have to put each of their
names into ('XXXXXXXXXXXX')""; !!!</p>

<p>I've tried putting $username, username, etc. etc. There's got to be a way of either
entering the username or the 2 dimensional array specific row. Please help?</p>

All of this must be controlled by AD groups only (site owners do not have access to add users to a secure folder).  Also need to find out if there are any files within the folder that do not inherit from the folder and are also shared to individual users instead of AD groups (hope this makes sense).   Here is what I have so far and it works to a point, but for some reason it is returning users that have access to the site elsewhere and also users who have limited access that I have to clean up later.</p>

<p>Here's the code I have written so far that sort of works.  It takes in the item object of the file or folder and a reference to a string. It scans the access and then builds a list of users separated by semicolon and returns true if one of the spuser objects is a user and not a group:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Provides list of users\groups that have access to a List Item.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;param name=""spListItem""&gt;Item to check access of&lt;/param&gt;
    /// &lt;returns&gt;semi colon delimited list of users\groups with access in a referenced list and boolean value indicating if a direct user exists&lt;/returns&gt;
    public bool GetListItemUserAccess(SPListItem spListItem, ref string accountsWithAccess)
    {
        //string accountsWithAccess = string.Empty;
        bool IsFirstIteration = true;
        bool domainUserExits = false;

            if((spPrincipal as SPGroup) != null)
            {

<p>if posted data has <code>title=ChildPage, content=html.., slug=mainpage</code> then i need to update previous record (title and content records), but if data has <code>title=MainPage, content=html.., slug=other_slug</code> then i need to insert this data as new with a new id.</p>

It is very similar to the Tab View Control but in a subview. Is this even possible or do i have to do it programmatically?

<p>Here is an example @Configurable-annotated object:</p>

<pre><code>@Configurable(autowire = Autowire.BY_TYPE)
public class TestConfigurable {

    private TestComponent component;

    public TestComponent getComponent() {
        return component;
    }

    @Autowired
    public void setComponent(TestComponent component) {
        this.component = component;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Component that I'm injecting into this object:</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public class TestComponent {}
</code></pre>

<p>When I create TestConfigurable after context is created TestComponent injected there fine but when I'm doing so from @PostConstruct-annotated method it autowiring doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Component with @PostConstruct:</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public class TestPostConstruct {

    @PostConstruct
    public void initialize() {
        TestConfigurable configurable = new TestConfigurable();
        System.out.println(""In post construct: "" + configurable.getComponent());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Application that I'm executing:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(""/application-context.xml"");
        applicationContext.registerShutdownHook();

        TestConfigurable configurable = new TestConfigurable();
        System.out.println(""After context is loaded: "" + configurable.getComponent());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an output this application produces:</p>

<pre><code>In post construct: null
After context is loaded: paulenka.aleh.roguelike.sandbox.TestComponent@fe18270
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So is there any workaround to inject dependencies into @Configurable objects that are created inside @PostConstruct methods?</strong> All @Component-annotated beans are already in the context and autowiring is already done for them in time when @PostConstruct is called. Why Spring doesn't do autowiring here?..</p>

<p>Can post other configuration files (context and pom.xml) if they will help to resolve the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong>
Looks like I found the cause of the problem. Objects annotated with @Configurable are initialized by AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect which implements BeanFactoryAware. This aspect uses BeanFactory to initialize beans. Looks like @PostConstruct method of the TestPostConstruct object is executed before BeanFactory is set to AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect. If logger set to debug the following message is printed to console: <em>""BeanFactory has not been set on ...: Make sure this configurer runs in a Spring container. Unable to configure bean of type [...]. Proceeding without injection.""</em></p>

<p>The question if there is any workaround is still open for me...</p>

I have a QTableView displaying some data (set up in a model) and a QLineEdit Widget that i want to use for searching text in all displayed rows. The expected behavior should be: i type some text in the QLineEdit and the QTableView update itself hiding all rows that not contain that data.  </p>

<p>The question is, how should i implement that? I have found a QTableView member function named hideRows() that seems the right choice, but i can't figure out how should i iterate through all the data and where to put that method. It should be contained inside the model or the dialog? (this is actually my first time using models, so i just grasped how they work)  </p>

To be clear, I am not talking about reading the metadata out of the video file itself (as you would with an MPEG Transport Stream, for instance). What I'm talking about is the <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> element that is used for captioning videos. One of the attributes of a <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> is <code>kind</code>, which can be specified as any of the following values:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subtitles</li>
<li>Descriptions</li>
<li>Captions</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>Chapters</li>
<li>Metadata</li>
</ul>

<p>I am trying to use the <b>metadata</b> type to access text stored in the corresponding WebVTT file, which I intend to manipulate using JavaScript. I know this is possible, as it is <a href=""http://blog.gingertech.net/2011/03/29/webvtt-explained/"" rel=""nofollow"">mentioned by Silvia Pfeiffer</a> as well as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6905167/javascript-parser-for-rdf-json-from-webvtt"">by the maker of Captionator</a>, which is the JavaScript polyfill that I am using to implement the functionality of interpreting the <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> tags. However, I just can't get it to work.</p>

<p>My code is based on the <a href=""https://github.com/cgiffard/Captionator"" rel=""nofollow"">Captionator</a> documentation's captions example. I added a button to retrieve the metadata and display it when I click the button. Unfortunately it keeps displaying ""undefined"" instead of the metadata. Any ideas what I might be doing incorrectly? Alternatively, does anyone know where a working example is that I could take a look at? I can't find one anywhere.</p>

"28627398","1","28627577","","2015-02-20 11:01:35","","1","1158","<p>I want to learn the basics of AES encryption so I started to make a very simple Java program. The program loads a text file to a string and asks key from the user. After this the program uses AES to encrypt it to another new text file and prints the initialization vector to the user. The program also has the decryption function which works vice versa, user gives encrypted text file, the initialization vector and the key to decrypt it back to new text file. </p>

<p>However I think I'm doing something wrong. Is it normal procedure in AES that user need save both key and iv to decrypt file? I have browsed through the internet and almost in every example, the encrypted data can be decrypted only with the key but in my case the user needs to have also the iv. The program is working fine but I think it isn't efficient.</p>

<p>So should I use the iv as a constant which is used in all the encryptions and decryptions or what? Also some tutorials are using ""salt"", what is it and should I use it? Here's my encrypt and decrypt methods:</p>

<pre><code>public String encrypt(String stringToEncrypt, String userKey)
        throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException,
        InvalidKeyException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException {

    // User gives string key which is formatted to 16 byte and to a secret
    // key
    byte[] key = userKey.getBytes();
    MessageDigest sha = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"");
    key = sha.digest(key);
    key = Arrays.copyOf(key, 16);
    SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, ""AES"");

    // Cipher initialization
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);

    // Encryption and encoding
    String encryptedData = new BASE64Encoder().encode(cipher
            .doFinal(stringToEncrypt.getBytes()));

    // IV is printed to user
    System.out.println(""\nENCRYPTION IV: \n""
            + new BASE64Encoder().encode(cipher.getIV()) + ""\n"");

    // Function returns encrypted string which can be writed to text file
    return encryptedData;

}

public String decrypt(String stringToDecrypt, String userKey, String userIv)
        throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, IOException,
        NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidKeyException,
        InvalidAlgorithmParameterException, IllegalBlockSizeException,
        BadPaddingException {

    // User gives the same string key which was used for encryption
    byte[] key = userKey.getBytes();
    MessageDigest sha = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"");
    key = sha.digest(key);
    key = Arrays.copyOf(key, 16);
    SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, ""AES"");

    // Decode string iv to byte
    byte[] iv = new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(userIv);

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I updated my code now to use ""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256"" algorithm with salt and etc. I also combined the IV byte array to cipher text byte array as prefix so I can split them in decrypt method and get the IV there (That's working fine). However there's now an issue with the key, because I'm generating new encrypted key also in decryption method which of course is a wrong key for encrypted data. I want to be able to close the program so I can't store the key as a class variable. It's very hard to explain the issue but I hope you understand the problem...</p>

"25134110","1","","","2014-08-05 08:17:33","","0","46","<p>I am trying to animate a label in a WPF application. The label gets created programatically (and dynamically) so it is not defined in XAML, but is created in the C# code.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Story</strong></p>

<p>The label appears in the bottom of the window. The label should be positioned lower than the window, so the user can not see it initially. Then a the label moves up (like sliding) and fades out before it reaches the top of the window.</p>

<p><strong>What I have done</strong></p>

<p>I have implemented this behavior myself in an other project. This time I want to use WPF which should perform better.</p>

<p>So far I have seen there should be multiple ways of doing this. Starting with a <code>DoubleAnimation</code>, going by a <code>PathAnimation</code> and <code>VectorAnimation</code> (the last of which I have not tested successfully).</p>

<p><strong>Encountered problems</strong></p>

<p>The animation works nice with a <code>DoubleAnimation</code>, but there is a problem: When I resize the window, the label gets resized too (similar to an anchor in Winforms). When I make the window smaller the label gets smaller too, until it disappears completely. This effect occurs only in the height of the label. I added the code snippet adding the label. Maybe you find some error. Also there should be a better way to implement this (I personally find it very ugly).</p>

<pre><code>Label lbl = new Label()
{
    Content = ""Test"",
    FontSize = 36,
    Foreground = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red),
    Background = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Black),
    HorizontalContentAlignment = System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Center,
    VerticalAlignment = System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Top
 };
lbl.Margin = new Thickness(0, this.MainGrid.ActualHeight + lbl.ActualHeight, 0, 0);
this.MainGrid.Children.Add(lbl);
UpdateLayout();
Transform myTransform = new TranslateTransform();
lbl.RenderTransform = myTransform;
DoubleAnimation AnimationY = new DoubleAnimation((this.MainGrid.ActualHeight + 20) * -1, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(4));
myTransform.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.YProperty, AnimationY);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>As I said, I have found multiple ways that seem to achieve the same behavior. Which one could I use to do this. I still have to do the fade-out on the top of the window, but this animation is easier to do compared to the movement.</p>

SO I've determined the problem is when the data is being saved to the database on the edit command as it seems to be working on the create.  But thats somewhat besides the point....</p>

<p>In a few cases where the widget's signal is connected to one of it's own slots, it's straightforward to begin the slot with an</p>

<p>However, I've recently identified that this behaviour is responsible for several related bugs where the spurious signals are passed on through several layers of the program before being acted upon, so simply checking whether a particular widget has focus is not trivial to implement.</p>

<p>My question, therefore, is:</p>

<p>Is it possible to have this matrix representing the structure of the small cubes? Let's say every small cube is represented by -1, I mean that all -1s in a row of the matrix are small cubes at the same row, and all -1s in a column are actually small cubes in the same column (neighbors inside the big cube must be neighbors inside the matrix). Since the big cube is a 3D shape, I expect such a matrix to be a 3D matrix with row, column, and depth measures. Depth may represent the layers of different small cubes we have, i.e at depth 1 we have a set of rows and columns representing the small cubes at the first depth. After that I want to iterate over this matrix and change the -1 to some other number that represents some color. How to change the color of some small cube using the corresponding number in the matrix? For example, let the number at index (1,1,1) be 0 and let it represent yellow, how can I change the corresponding cube color to yellow? I'm think about <code>patch</code> function, but how to apply it to the corresponding cube?</p>

<p>How can I fill the cube with small cubes? And, how can I build the matrix described above? </p>

<p>Here is a code for placing a small cube inside the big one, but this places it in the center, I tried to fill the big cube with small cubes in an organized way as in the provided picture, but I couldn't figure out how to do that. </p>

<pre><code>clf;
figure(1);
format compact 
h(1) = axes('Position',[0.2 0.2 0.6 0.6]);

%These are the different 8 vertices of the cube, each is defined by its 3 x
%y z coordinates:
vert = [1 1 -1; 
        -1 1 -1; 
        -1 1 1; 
        1 1 1; 
        -1 -1 1;
        1 -1 1; 
        1 -1 -1;
        -1 -1 -1];
%These are the 6 faces of the cube, each is defined by connecting 4 of the
%available vertices:
fac = [1 2 3 4; 
       4 3 5 6; 
       6 7 8 5; 
       1 2 8 7; 
       6 7 1 4; 
       2 3 5 8];

% I defined a new cube whose length is 1 and centers at the origin.
vert2 = vert * .05;  
fac2 = fac;


patch('Faces',fac,'Vertices',vert,'Facecolor', 'w');  % patch function for the first big cube. 
axis([-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1]);
axis equal;

hold on;

patch('Faces', fac2, 'Vertices', vert2, 'FaceColor', 'r');
material metal;
alpha('color');
alphamap('rampdown');
view(3);

<p>Can anyone please tell me how to fill the cube and construct the matrix? </p>

<p>Thank You. </p>

<p>My question: Is it reasonable that the gateway, after getting the response from the web service, forwards the Security header to the client?  </p>

<p>I'm thinking that it ""feels"" like that should be for the GW -> Web Service link only, since the client didn't use any message security in its request but am I right or wrong?</p>

<p>Generate M uniformly random integers from the range 0-N, where N >> M, and where no pair has a difference less than K. <strike>where M >> K</strike>.</p>

<p>At the moment the best method I can think of is to maintain a sorted list, then determine the lower bound of the current generated integer and test it with the lower and upper elements, if it's ok to then insert the element in between. This is of complexity O(nlogn).</p>

<p>Would there happen to be a more efficient algorithm?</p>

<p>An example of the problem:</p>

<p>Generate 1000 uniformly random integers between zero and 100million where the difference between any two integers is no less than 1000</p>

<p>A comprehensive way to solve this would be to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine all the combinations of n-choose-m that satisfy the constraint, lets called it set X</li>
<li>Select a uniformly random integer i in the range [0,|X|).</li>
<li>Select the i'th combination from X as the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>This solution is problematic when the n-choose-m is large, as enumerating and storing all possible combinations will be extremely costly. Hence an efficient online generating solution is sought.</p>

<p>before I used Tasks generation took like 4-5 seconds. after I implemented this method like this if I pass 10-20 number of tasks the time of generation is lowered to 1,8-2,2 seconds but the thing it the <code>List</code> which is return by the method has <code>numOfTask</code> number of Elements in it so in this case <code>List</code> of ten numbers is returned. May be I'm writing something wrong.   What can be the problem here. Or may be there is another solution to It. All I want it many task to add numbers in the same list so the generation time would be at least twice faster. Thanks In advance</p>

The idea being that the keylogger would need to consume resources to run correctly and should result in a lower benchmark score.</p>

<p>In code, I've basically written two while loop that use the win32API calls SendMessage() and PostMessage() to simulate keystrokes.  It executes the loop for given amount of time and records how many successful messages it's sent.</p>

<p>I was expecting the keylogger to either make no measurable difference (after all, there's a whole lot of 'stuff' executing on a desktop, all the time, and I figured a keylogger might not use a lot...) or that it would result in a slightly lower number.</p>

<p>And that's mostly what I've seen in the case of the '<strong>SendMessage()</strong>' calls.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is that my benchmark is showing a dramatic increase in the number of calls to <strong>PostMessage()</strong></p>

<p>Averaging many executions, prior to installing the keylogger, I seeing about 10k PostMessage() per second.  After installing a keylogger, I'm now seeing almost 25k calls to PostMessage() per second.</p>

<p>It just doesn't make any sense to me.</p>

<p>If my understanding of PostMessage is correct, it adds a windows message to the process's message queue and resumes execution (while SendMessage waits until the process handles the message before returning).  I'd expect PostMessage to execute faster than SendMessage, and that some messages might be lost once the message queue is full....but nothing in my limited understanding would help me understand how a keylogger could INCREASE performance - by such a significant margin.</p>

<p>I feel like the code is pretty simple.  I can confirm that it does register as a keystroke (I'm sending them into Notepad) and that they keylogger is logging them. </p>

<p>Can someone explain to me what I'm missing?</p>

<p>How can a keylogger improve performance?!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I'm running the benchmark 10 times and averaging the results.<br>
Pausing the keylogger  (so that it is still installed, but not logging) still yielded the high results.  After uninstalling the keylogger and rebooting my machine, the average of 10 runs is now 9.9k per second; very much in alignment with my original results.</p>

<p>I did have to reboot my machine to complete the uninstall.</p>

<p>copy on write will record the current state of the file system (metadata).
This will result in a slight halt in the system (almost instantaneous).</p>

<p>If the file system receives a read request on an unmodified file, we are reading the snapshot metadata and it redirects us to the original copy.</p>

<p>The problem is when I select some item from dropdown for <code>Region</code> integer column and press outside the cell it doesn't assign selected value to the grid column. I see an empty cell.
However, when I select in <code>Type</code> cell which is string and press outside I see the selected value. </p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? What's the problem with int column?</p>

"11971855","1","12138341","","2012-08-15 15:04:24","","4","915","<p>Recently I got chance to play a little bit with Windows 8 Release Preview (Build 8400 to be specific). My aim was to investigate bugs which appeared in our product (WPF application) only under Windows 8. The bugs looked very simple - few buttons were disabled when they shouldn't. It looked easy to fix but I decided to find the root cause.</p>

<p>It turned out that when a control bound to a command receives <code>CanExecuteChanged</code> notification it doesn't requery command's <code>CanExecute</code> method if sender is not the same command. This is a bit of a problem in a situation when command performs some operation on a model and it's ability to execute depends on model's state. For example, imagine you have a model:</p>

<pre><code>class MyModel
  {
    public void ChangeModel(bool makeValidForCommand)
    {
      Valid = makeValidForCommand;

      if (ModelChanged != null)
        ModelChanged(this, new EventArgs());
    }

    public bool Valid { get; private set; }

    public event EventHandler ModelChanged;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>And a command:</p>

<pre><code>class MyCommand : ICommand
  {
    public MyCommand(MyModel model)
    {
      _model = model;
    }

    public bool CanExecute(object parameter)
    {
      return _model.Valid;
    }

    public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged
    {
      add { _model.ModelChanged += value; }
      remove { _model.ModelChanged -= value; }
    }

    public void Execute(object parameter) { }

    private MyModel _model;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this won't work on Windows 8 - the button bound to the command will stay improperly disabled (or enabled) after the model changed state. It works perfectly well on Windows 7 though!</p>

<p>The command can be rewritten like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyCommand : ICommand
  {
    public MyCommand(MyModel model)
    {
      _model = model;
    }

    public bool CanExecute(object parameter)
    {
      return _model.Valid;
    }

    public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged
    {
      add
      {
        _canExecuteChanged += value;
        _model.ModelChanged -= _modelChanged;
        _model.ModelChanged += _modelChanged;
      }

      remove
      {
        _canExecuteChanged -= value;
        _model.ModelChanged -= _modelChanged;
      }
    }

    public void Execute(object parameter)
    {
    }

    private void _modelChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
      if (_canExecuteChanged != null)
        _canExecuteChanged(this, new EventArgs());
    }

    private event EventHandler _canExecuteChanged;
    private MyModel _model;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Now sender is the command itself, and everything is fine. Another option is to use <code>CommandManager</code> and its <code>RequerySuggested</code> event:</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged
    {
      add { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; }
      remove { CommandManager.RequerySuggested -= value; }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And again it works! Hm, now I'm completely puzzled. Sender is not the command - it's null, but if I try to send my own event with null sender it doesn't work again.</p>

<p>Did anyone faced the same? Is it such a strange way of optimization on new Windows? Honestly it looks more like a bug.</p>

<p>If I take the abstraction of Ports and Adapters, when I adapt my application for a particular port, is it ok for me to give the port an entity from inside my application? Or am I always supposed to adapt the entities also, to fit the port?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Say I have a Customer entity. I have a UI that uses my application. My UI calls through an Adapter to getCustomerById(123). In turn, my adapter will call through to my application, effectively retrieving a Customer using the injected Repository, and it will perform some sort of formatting on it and logging and what not, once the Customer is ready, it is returned to my UI. My question here is, my Customer object is returned as is to my UI. This means my UI has a reference to the Customer class from my Core project. My UI then goes on using that Customer object to do things, maybe change it's name, etc. and eventually calls the adapter again to updateCustomer(customer).</p>

<p>Is this ok to do? Is it ok that my UI uses the Customer class from inside my application core. Or should I instead adapt my Customer to a new Customer object say UICustomer and have my UI work with that instead, mapping back and forth between Customer and UICustomer at the adapter level?</p>

<p>I want to do some tracking using Kalman filter(possibly adaptive).My measurements(when they are available) are very good with very small error from the real measurements. In some cases though the measurements jump to a value,completely off from the correct position i am looking for, and then after few frames the come back to their correct position.</p>

<p>The problem is that if my filter(not adaptive) has specific values for Measurement Noise Covariance(R) and  State Error Covariance(Q) matrices the results are not very accurate,because even for these 1% of cases i have to do a compromise between R and Q.</p>

<p>So i decided to use an adaptive Kalman filter as they do in here: <a href=""http://www.gnss.com.au/JoGPS/v9n1/JoGPS_v9n1p33-40.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnss.com.au/JoGPS/v9n1/JoGPS_v9n1p33-40.pdf</a></p>

<p>They estimate the measurement noise covariance matrix based on the innovation sequences.
Basically, they are using a moving window on previous samples and the calculate the covariance of the error between the previous measurements-prior estimations. For eg 5 past measurements and the 5 prior estimations.When a faulty measurement comes under the window, the covariance increases and thus the R increases also.</p>

<p>But in practice the R increases(but not enough) so in the next step the estimation is still good but just a bit towards the the faulty measurement.In the next step(because now the the previous estimation has moved a bit towards the measurement) the R becomes smaller with result the new estimation to go even closer to the measurements, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>In the end after a few frames the estimations follow the faulty measurements. Here is a plot to understand better what i mean.</p>

<p>Maybe what i am trying to do is completely wrong and can't be done with the adaptive Kalman filter.Maybe someone who has worked extensively with Kalman Filter in the past and he has faced this problem before can help.</p>

<p>I also tried different payloads and variations, played around with various serializer hooks and looked for the answer in ember-data code. No luck yet. </p>

<p>Am I missing something or are async polymorphic relationships not possible in ember data?</p>

<p>Here is a jsfiddle with the basic setup: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/koenig/3qwEP/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/koenig/3qwEP/</a></p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Essentially I scan a set of RSS podcast feed URLs, write the first audio file from each to a local file, then loop through those to check their status. </p>

<p>The PhantomJs scripts work fine by themselves, but if I attempt to run via <code>gulp</code> - and <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-phantom"" rel=""nofollow"">gulp-phantom</a> - it just hangs.</p>

<p>Here's my gulpfile.js:</p>

<pre><code>var gulp = require(""gulp"");
var phantom = require(""gulp-phantom"");

function handleError(err) {
    console.log(err.toString());
    this.emit('end');
}

gulp.task('phantom', function(){
    gulp.src(""./phantom/check_feed.js"")
        .pipe(phantom({
            debug: true,
            localToRemoteUrlAccess: true,
            webSecurity: false
        }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(""./data/"")
        .on(""error"", handleError));
});
</code></pre>

<p>Note (I'm not sure whether the options I'm passing to phantom here are required). Here's an example of the async call:</p>

<pre><code>async.eachSeries(mp3array, checkFile, function (e) {
    if (e) console.log(e);

    console.log('All done!');
    phantom.exit();
}, function(err) {
    console.log(err);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to allow the phantom async loop to run within a <code>gulp</code> routine, or do I need to do something else entirely? I want to use <code>gulp</code> so I can automate the whole process with one command.</p>

I must admit that I don't quite have any idea about how should I do it. I tried it that way: one bound with rotX and rotZ at 0 deg both. The one rotX at 109 deg. The next step would be <code>rotZ</code> and <code>rotX</code> at 109 deg. Let's say that angle for rotX is AngleX and the angle for rotZ is AngleZ. The end of my cylinder will be (calculated and tried) at <code>(sin AngleZ,cos AngleZ*cos AngleX, cos AngleZ*sin AngleX)</code>. This is legit, so ouviously rotating again would do no good.</p>

<p>I have 4 cylinders of 2f length, created one at a time, translated at (0,1,0) so their end is at (0,0,0). From this point, I rotate my cylinders around the point (0,0,0) and I try to achieve a tetrahedron. The left cylinder is at {109,0} and the right one at {109,109} Can be easily seen that it's not the same angle between the left cylinder and the one going up and the right one and the cylinder going up<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pAyDW.jpg"" alt=""image for bounds at angles {0,0}, {109.5,0},{109.5,109,5} (mouserotated so you can see better)"">  </p>

<p>Also I have to say that solving this by calculus won't help me too much, because I will probably need to change angles in some situation, but I still need it to have same angles between cylinders.</p>

<p>Any ideas? How should I solve this?</p>

<p>Note: To be easier, I transformed from radians to degrees in my program so I work with degrees. </p>

<p>We have a Windows Forms application (written in C#, .NET Framework 3.5) currently running on full Windows 7 tablets, which have a 3G module built in that is used for data connectivity. The data connection is configured as a normal mobile broadband connection in Windows (so Windows manages the connectivity itself), and the connection shows up in Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections and it works fine - the application is able to communicate over the internet with our web service. We will be moving onto a different device (likely a full Windows 8-based tablet) at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Now, what I need to do is read the connection status of this Mobile Broadband connection; i.e. get the signal strength, and the carrier name (e.g. Vodafone UK). I've found a way to do this using the Mobile Broadband API part of the Windows 7 SDK (see <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd323271%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg487392.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>), however this appears to be OS specific as it doesn't work on Windows 8 - or at least not with the device I have here.</p>

<p>Is there a generic way to read the mobile broadband connection properties using the .NET framework?</p>

<p>Alternatively, does anyone know of a Windows 8 SDK which contains a Mobile Broadband API like the Windows 7 one I'm currently using?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Update - I've got this working on a range of different Win 7 / Win 8 devices now. Even the Lenovo device is working OK. I'll post up example code for the main bits (Reading connection status, configuring the connection, checking the SIM status) as answers; the code is a little too long to go into the question, annoyingly.</p>

<pre><code>553000.468...705.46.0000000        &lt;- Format 1
553000.469.5501000.704.47.0000000  &lt;- Format 2
</code></pre>

<p>I only need the three digits in the middle that include 703, 704, or 705</p>

<p>I was able to pull these digits by using regular expressions like so:</p>

<pre><code>Regex num = new Regex(@""(?&lt;number&gt;7\d+) ?"");
Match number = num.Match(numb);
if (number.Success)
    Console.WriteLine(num.Match(numb).Result(""${number}"")); 
</code></pre>

<p>However, that only works if there isn't a 7 preceding the middle numbers</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best way to approach it would be to focus on the ""."".  The problem is I can't figure out how to match character AFTER the "".""  I can pull the numbers prior to the 1st ""."" by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>Regex num = new Regex(@""(?&lt;number&gt;.\d+) ?"");
Match number = num.Match(numb);
if (number.Success)
    Console.WriteLine(num.Match(numb).Result(""${number}"")); 
</code></pre>

<p>This would give me everything prior to the period.  I'm using the cheat sheet found <A HREF=""http://www.mikesdotnetting.com/Article/46/CSharp-Regular-Expressions-Cheat-Sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">here</A> but it doesn't show how to match characters after the "".""
If I can figure out how to do that then I can just repeat the pattern until I get to the numbers I need, then I can use the above code to get rid of the numbers after.  That may not be the most effective way to do it but I've never used regular expressions before and to be honest I find it very confusing.    </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I've been told I need to provide more examples or explain it better.  I have a database table with a column called Glsec.  This field contains numbers in two formats;  553000.468...705.46.0000000   and  553000.469.5501000.704.47.0000000 are examples of the two formats.</p>

<p>In the 553000.468...705.46.0000000 format I only need the numbers 703, 704, or 705 found in the first group of numbers AFTER the ... (14th character from the left)</p>

<p>In the 553000.469.5501000.704.47.0000000 format I only need the numbers 703, 704, or 705 found 4th group of numbers from the left (20th character).</p>

<p>The numbers in that group of three may contain any number between 000 and 999 but I only need the three numbers.  It is also possible that 703, 704, 705 can randomly pop up in the other groups of numbers so I have to make sure I am grabbing the numbers from the correct position.</p>

<p>I hope that explains it better. </p>

<p>everything is fine when I build the solution in debug/release inside visual studio, but when it gets built in TeamCity one of the references doesn't get copied over. all other files referenced by the supporting project are copied except that single one.</p>

<p>I was able to get around this by directly adding a reference to that library, but wanted to figure out the underlying cause of it.</p>

<p>all the references are marked as copy local.</p>

        Message message = consumer.receive();

        // There are many types of Message and TextMessage
        // is just one of them. Producer sent us a TextMessage

        String[] parts = ((TextMessage)message).getText().split(""-"");

<p>After several restarts of servers (all together, stop all and start one-by-one etc) we were able to run the system.
Could you explain, why Hazelcast fails to lock map at the node if it is in cluster, or if this node was out of cluster, why it is displayed as a member?
Also are there any recomendations how to restart Tomcat cluster with distributed Hazelcast structures (stop all nodes and start together, stop and start one-by-one, stop Hazelcast somehow before server restart etc?)?
Thanks!</p>

<p>I.e. I want a for loop to use $(this) on each droppable.</p>

Certain elements being fixed ratio (logo, video players, etc) means other areas have to expand/contract amorphically to accomodate their fixed behavior that can't ever go past 100% width or height.  Difficult to explain, but the behavior in sassmeister gist below shows it working.  To do this, I need to be able to define widths in terms of heights, and vice-versa (width = 56.25% of height, etc) </p>

<p>I can make it work using vh, vw, vmin, a bunch of calc functions etc... but browser support is patchy, and I'm unaware of a polyfill to smooth all that out.  My vh, vw, calc solution below:</p>

<p><a href=""http://sassmeister.com/gist/3dee56a4092a86cf070a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sassmeister.com/gist/3dee56a4092a86cf070a</a></p>

<p>Only other pure css I'm aware of that even begins to address this is the percent padding trick tying padded height to parent width, but this alone isn't enough.  I need to be able to use min, max statements, and tie width and height going both ways.</p>

<p>So... unless I'm mistaken, @media queries only ever return true/false, so they can't provide an actual viewport measurement to use, right?  That's what I really need... a pixel accurate measurement of the available viewport height and width.</p>

<p>What's the solution here?  Should I use javascript to get those exact dimensions, then do all the arranging in javascript?  Use JS to get the variables, then pass them on to the css?</p>

<p>Something like this: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/scottjehl/2051999"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/scottjehl/2051999</a> and a method to import those returned values into css should work, no?  Is that slowing the site down too much to have the js call first before anything else happens?</p>

<p>Also, need to find the right way to do all these calculations.  Should I just be using javascript to do all the calcs and leaving stuff like the following out of css completely?</p>

<p>$gutter: calc(((100vh + 100vw) / 2) * 0.04)</p>

<p>Then using that variable inside another function:</p>

<p>$column-width: calc(100vw - (1.7778 * (100vh - 2 * $gutter)) - 3 * $gutter)</p>

<p>However, there is some serious problems with this it seems... For instance, it currently splits the items by their spaces and then uses them to check what commands are use, but what IF the query to search has spaces in it? e.g.</p>

<pre><code>if(result_items[3] != """")
{
    FINDquery(result_items[3]);             
}
</code></pre>

<p>this works fine the query is </p>

<pre><code>FIND WHERE NAME mynametosearch
</code></pre>

<p>but what about when its:</p>

<pre><code>FIND WHERE NAME my name to search
</code></pre>

<p>It now has additional params exceeding result_items[3] and the search will fail.</p>

<p>What better approach can i take with this?</p>

<p>I have an application that I've developed.  I have specific customers that want a customized version of this app.  I am trying to find a way to fork the core app and make this customization, but still be able to apply patches that I make for the core app.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><strong>Core app has a 3 x 3 grid of buttons.  Each button is able to be customized in the settings (color, text, etc).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Customer Joe wants this grid to be 2 x 2.  This affects that XML layouts as well as a considerable amount of code that handles these buttons.</strong></p>

<p>How would I make a new version for Joe, but allow it to be updated when I update the core app?</p>

<p>Also, if I make changes to the button handling in the core app, I may not want these changes to apply downstream.  Is there a way to flag them?</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I really don't want to try and manage two unlinked sets of code.</p>

<p>I've tried things like:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add -f child_remote git://github.com/me/child.git

git submodule init
git submodule update
git checkout master
git read-tree --prefix=child_directory/ -u child_branch

<p>I've also tried to modify the instructions at <a href=""http://help.github.com/subtree-merge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.github.com/subtree-merge/</a> to work with submodules, but to no avail.</p>

<p>I understand that I could accomplish this by manually modifying the .gitmodules file to refer to the correct path, or merging in the Child project without submodules and then re-adding them to the Parent project, but I consider both of those solutions to be hacks.

<p>Basically each resource will have a typical availability of 0..24 hours for each day (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) of the week. BUT then there will be exceptions that need to be considered for example a holiday or special event that should overrule the default for that day of the week.</p>

<p>I can think of two broad approaches (though I'm sure there are more). One which would query the DB on every request and test the logic to see if the resource is available at that moment. This may become cumbersome (time consuming) as system grows. The other would run a process (cron?) every x (5?) min to set a boolean (AVAILABLE) on each resource that is derived depending on the rules for its availability.</p>

<p>I can't work out where its coming from because there is no reference to any of my code. I have a viewpager that displays up to 3 listviews based on a database query. The problem above occurs when I change the data that feeds the viewpager from another activity then drop back to the one that the viewpager is in. In onResume I rerun the queries to the database and rerun the loaders that I'm using to put the actual data in the viewpager pages. This all goes fine, and then it crashes! I don't think its the other activity because the changes to the database actually happen and are saved. Anybody any ideas?</p>

<p>Sometimes I encouter such strange situations that the program run incorrectly while running normally and it will pop-up the termination dialog,but correctly while debugging.This do make me frustrated when I want to use debugger to find the bug inside my code.</p>

<p>Have you ever met this kind of situation and why?</p>

<p><em>To prove there are logic reasons that will led such a frustrating situation</em>:</p>

<p>I think one big possibility is heap access volidation.I once wrote a function that allocate a small buffer,but later I step out the boudary.It will run correctly within gdb,cdb,etc(I do not know why,but it do run correctly);but terminate abnormally while running normally.</p>

<p>I am using C++.</p>

<p><em>I do not think my problem duplicate the above one.</em></p>

<p>That one is comparision between release mode and debug mode,but mine is between debugging and not debugging,which have a word <strong>heisenbug</strong>,as many other noted.</p>

<p>I'm on OSX (10.9), I have a Python 2.7 installation on a virtualenv (besides the global one) and Aptana Studio 3. I've tried all sorts of set ups, but I got to my current configuration by doing:</p>

<pre><code>File &gt; Import &gt; General – Existing folder as new project
</code></pre>

<p>I then right-clicked the project directory and selected PyDev > Set as Django Project. I chose my manage.py and settings file.</p>

<p>Then I went on to <code>Properties &gt; PyDev – Interpreter/Grammar</code> and clicked the hyperlink to configure an interpreter not listed. I selected the python file in my virtual environment. I was prompted with the following list of folders to choose:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RQtOa.png"" alt=""list of folders""></p>

<p>If I click ""apply"" without changing the default, I get the following error:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/a1txP.png"" alt=""error""></p>

<p>If I proceed anyway, I get all sorts of import errors for standard library packages/modules (e.g. json). I went and checked the lib folder in my virtualenv python installation and indeed these packages/modules were not present, which makes me even more confused about how virtualenv works (I hate these configuration things and I admit that for a long time I have avoided them whenever I could, collaborating to the maintenance of my ignorance). I have virtualenvswrapper installed. <code>workon env_name</code> works perfectly, the pip installations go to the correct site-packages, but the standard library seems to be being accessed in the global python.</p>

<p>Anyway, I therefore included the global python lib folder:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEhvj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I then went to <code>Properties &gt; PyDev – PYTHONPATH &gt; Source folders tab &gt; Add source folder</code>, selected the root of my Django project and clicked Apply.</p>

<p>I went to <code>Aptana Studio 3 &gt; Settings… &gt; PyDev &gt; Code Analysis</code> and configured it:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DnsSY.png"" alt=""Code analysis""></p>

<p>RESULT:</p>

<p>Certain things, like <code>method( self ):</code> (notice the spaces) are corrected on save. I don't get any PEP8 warnings for many other stuff though, like <code>dict[ 'key' ]</code> (extra spaces again), more than 80 characters per line etc.</p>

<p>I also get errors on relative imports (e.g. <code>from ..utils import *</code>) and consequently all lines that use the imported values.</p>

<p>What could I possibly be doing wrong??</p>

The two options I see are to either have one edmx model that defines everything and then handcraft the DbContexts to include the appropriate entities, or to have separate edmx models for each context and use the automatically created DbContexts.</p>

<p>Has anyone any ideas of which is best or any pros/cons of either?</p>

<p>IMHO: 
For a single model it is a lot less classes and a lot more code re-use (though these classes are created automatically so really it will only be the extra functionality that will manually be duplicated), but I will have a lot of classes in one place and for classes that need to be specialised these will each have to have different names. E.g. Customer, CustomerForFunctionalityX, CustomerForFunctionalityB.</p>

<p>With the separate models I can be much more stringent on what goes into a context as removing a property doesn't need to be a completely new entity, and I can name everything as I wish (i.e. all models can use a Customer object even if it differs between models), but now each context has entirely different entities even if they are all just mapping to the same table - which can also make it more difficult to pass them between contexts (this however shouldn't be needed too often otherwise it means the contexts have been defined wrong).</p>

<p>This is my approach i have now, but i do not know if it worst all the time (as far as i tested every worked for my) or if there is a better way.</p>

<pre><code>public class FatherClass extends Activity {

private static int activities = 0;

public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState, String clase) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
}

protected void onRestart()
{
    super.onRestart();
    if(activities == 0){
        Log.i(""APP"",""BACK FROM BACKGROUND"");
    }
}

protected void onStop(){
    super.onStop();
    activities = activities - 1;
}

protected void onStart(){
    super.onStart();
    activities = activities + 1;
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation: the <strong>onStart</strong> is executed one the activity is ""visible"" and the <strong>onStop</strong> when the activity is ""not visible"". So when your APP (it says APP not activity) goes to background all the activities are ""not visible"" so they execute the onStop method, so the idea behind this is to <strong>add one</strong> each time an activity es started, and <strong>subtract one</strong> each time an activity es hided, so if the value of the variable ""activities"" is <strong>0 ""zero""</strong> that means that all the activities that where started in some point are now not visible, so when you APP returns from background and executes the <strong>onRestart</strong> method on the activity in ""front"" you can check whether comes from background or is just restarting an activity.</p>

<p>I would appreciate some feedback regarding this topic.</p>

<p>Does the Ioc only bind to View Models or something? Is that why it is not working as I have it in my code behind?</p>

<p>I am using a mix of code behind and MVVM as something are just so much easier to do with code behind.</p>

<p>I have a class which extends UITableViewCell</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit

protocol SwitchCellDelegate{
    func switchChanged(switchCell: SwitchCell, state: Bool)
}

class SwitchCell: UITableViewCell {

    @IBOutlet var swtSelector: UISwitch
    @IBOutlet var lblTitle: UILabel

    var delegate: SwitchCellDelegate?

    init(style: UITableViewCellStyle, reuseIdentifier: String) {
        super.init(style: style, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
    }

    @IBAction func switchChanged(){
        delegate?.switchChanged(self, state: swtSelector.on)
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the ViewController is defined as </p>

<pre><code>class SettingsViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource, SwitchCellDelegate {
</code></pre>

<p>and within the method</p>

<pre><code>func tableView(tableView: UITableView!, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!) -&gt; UITableViewCell! {
</code></pre>

<p>we have </p>

<pre><code>case 2:
    storeCredentialsCell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(""StoreCredentialsCell"") as? SwitchCell
    if(storeCredentialsCell != nil){
        ...
        NSLog(""Setting delegate to %@ for %@"", self.description, storeCredentialsCell.description)
        storeCredentialsCell!.delegate = self
        ...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>the log output is as expected but when it hits the actual setting of the delegate the app crashes with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EXC_BAD_ACCESS(code=1, address=0xfffffffffffffff8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I should also note that if I don't set the delegate value when delegate?.switchChanged(self, state: swtSelector.on) fires it also causes an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error but according to the doco for delegates this should fail gracefully if delegate is not set to anything.</p>

<p>===========================</p>

<p>I've simplified down to a basic project to replicate the issue.</p>

<p>TestTableViewController.swift</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit

class TestTableViewController: UITableViewController, TestCellDelegate {

    init(style: UITableViewStyle) {
        super.init(style: style)
    }

    init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder!) {
        super.init(coder: aDecoder)

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
    }

    override func numberOfSectionsInTableView(tableView: UITableView?) -&gt; Int {
        return 1
    }

    override func tableView(tableView: UITableView?, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {
        return 1
    }

    override func tableView(tableView: UITableView?, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath?) -&gt; UITableViewCell? {
        let cell = tableView!.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(""Cell"", forIndexPath: indexPath) as? TestCell

        if(cell != nil){
            cell!.delegate = self
            cell!.lblTest.text = ""Test Successful""
        }

        return cell
    }

    func eventFired(sender: TestCell) {
        NSLog(""Hooray!"")
    }
</code></pre>

<p>TestCell.swift</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit

protocol TestCellDelegate{
    func eventFired(sender: TestCell)
}

class TestCell: UITableViewCell {

    @IBOutlet var lblTest: UILabel
    @IBOutlet var swtTest: UISwitch

    var delegate: TestCellDelegate?

    init(style: UITableViewCellStyle, reuseIdentifier: String) {
        super.init(style: style, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
    }

    @IBAction func switchChanged(sender: UISwitch){
        delegate?.eventFired(self)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then created a single Table View Controller Scene with Class of TestTableViewController. The table view is dynamic with a single cell of type TestCell. That cell contains one label and one switch which are bound to the IBOutlets from the TestCell class. The switchChanged function is bound to the value changed event on the switch.</p>

<p>It could be an association because it interacts with it. It can also be an aggregation because its made up of several of a class. And a class doesn't make sense without it (in the program implementation) so I think its composition because composition is an aggregation and aggregation in turn is a type of association.

<p>My first guess is that this has to do with memory management. Something out there has to be deallocated but I have no idea what it is.</p>

<p>My second guess is that this has to do with the infrastructure provided by <code>UIView</code> and <code>UIWindow</code> . But once again, due to my lack of knowledge and experience, I can't figure out what the real problem is.</p>

<p>I know I can actually take an easy approach and create a push segue by using a <code>rootviewcontroller</code> and simply hiding the navigation bar, but I really want to know what exactly is wrong with my seemingly well-constructed custom segue and learn what is going on underneath the fabric of codes.</p>

<h2>[Updates]</h2>

<p>Thank Phillip Mills &amp; Joachim Isaksson for the suggestions, after conducting some experiments and making use of breakpoints and the Zombie tool,</p>

<p>this is what I realise:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After the custom segue has been triggered by a button,the app would only crash when the next segue is also triggered by a button. Triggering the next segue using <code>viewDidAppear</code> would not lead to any crash.</p></li>
<li><p>The main reason behind the crash:</p></li>

<p>which implies that (<em>if I'm not wrong</em>)</p>

<p>the custom segue has somehow triggered something that deallocates objects, to which an objective-C message would be sent after button (in <code>destinationViewController</code>) that triggers another segue is clicked.</p>

<hr>

<h2>More Details</h2>

<p>Not a single <code>prepareForSegue</code> is been called since I don't need to pass data between views.</p>

<p>My segues are all triggered the same way:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    CGRect buttonFrame = CGRectMake( 10, 40, 200, 50 );
    UIButton *button = [[UIButton alloc] initWithFrame: buttonFrame];
    [button setTitle: @""Go"" forState: UIControlStateNormal];
    [button addTarget:self action:@selector(nextView) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
    [button setTitleColor: [UIColor blackColor] forState: UIControlStateNormal];
    [self.view addSubview:button]; 
}

- (void)nextView{
    [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@""push"" sender:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have my ARC enabled so I didn't really do any of the deallocation myself..</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>[UPDATES 2]</strong></p>

<p>The object that has been turned into a zombie is the <code>destinationViewController</code> of the custom segue.</p>

<p>Not calling <code>removeFromSuperview</code> in the custom segue does not stop the object from turning into zombie.</p>

<p>As long as I use a regular model segue or a push segue (with rootViewController) instead the custom one I made, there won't be any zombie and everything would work fine.</p>

<p>Like the name say, this activity is an alarm player. So it plays a sound until the user press the button. </p>

<p>Everything was good, except when I try it when the screen was lock. Then I discovered that the sound was not playing.</p>

<p>To take the screen and unlock it I'm using this:</p>

    KeyguardLock keyguardLock =  keyguardManager.newKeyguardLock(""TAG"");
    keyguardLock.disableKeyguard();

<p>And to play the ringtoon I use this:</p>

<pre><code>Uri alert = RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_ALARM);
     if(alert == null){
         // alert is null, using backup
         alert = RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_NOTIFICATION);

             // alert backup is null, using 2nd backup
             alert = RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_RINGTONE);               
         }
     }
     mPlayer = new MediaPlayer();
     try {
         mPlayer.setDataSource(this, alert);
         mPlayer.setAudioStreamType(AudioManager.STREAM_ALARM);
         mPlayer.setLooping(true);

         e.printStackTrace();
         Log.e(""MediaPlayer"", ""Error while playing!"");
     }

<p>I already know the basics of setuptools. The problem is I may have to call the installation (setup.py) and the main script (main.py) separately. </p>

<p>Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>And instead ouf outputing the whole '99 bottles of beers on the wall' song from 99 to 1, it put out just the verses from 99 to 96 bottles. Is there something wrong with the loops in Brainfuck code or in the interpreter?</p>

<p>Here is my c code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int loop(char *commands, int indexOfCommand, int mode){
    int sum = 0;
    int movingIndex = indexOfCommand;
    while(sum &gt; -1){
        movingIndex -= mode;
        if(commands[movingIndex] == ']') 
            sum += mode;
        else if(commands[movingIndex]=='[')
            sum -= mode;
    }
    return movingIndex;
}

int main(){
    unsigned char array[30000] = {0}; // all elements are 0
    unsigned char commands[60000] = {0}; // all elements are 0

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>New to Java 6</strong> and when we are running <code>Java SE 6</code> from command line, then we are typically using console class object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, which means <strong>we are implicitly using console class through the command line ??</strong></p>

<p>Then, start searching about the console class, i found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4644415/how-to-get-input-from-console-class-in-java"">Input from console class in java</a> and <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Console.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Console</a> link. I conclude some points</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Console class are <strong>only usable outside the IDE</strong> using <code>System.console().readLine();</code></li>
  <li><code>Console</code> class <strong>reads a password or passphrase from the console</strong> with echoing disabled using <code>readPassword()</code></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Although, we had <a href=""http://www.java-tips.org/java-se-tips/java.util/how-to-read-input-from-console.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Scanner</a> class and <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html"" rel=""nofollow"">BufferedReader</a> class to read the input from console and that was added earlier than <code>Java 5</code>. So, only due to security reason, <code>Console</code> class added in <code>Java 6</code>. There are some other advantage to use this class. </p>

<p>I'm confused, so please anyone help me to know more about the <code>console</code>  class. </p>

I have a problem where a string I'm passing around in JavaScript has somehow got Unicode escape characters in it (0x5206, left-to-right mark) that I need to strip out. I can do this with a dumb loop checking for the existence of the unicode character and stripping it out, but I should be able to do this with a .replace(regex). However after a couple of hours trying I need help with it (first time doing regex).</p>

<pre><code>// Convert from JS date format to dotnet ticks
function getNetDateTime(JSDate, dateortime) {
    var convStr = JSDate.toLocaleString();
    var tryRegEx = convStr.replace(/\u5206/g, """");

<p>In the code above, tempStr and stripStr give the correct date but not tryRegEx (gets invalid date as the Unicode escape char isn't stripped out). I'm fairly sure the regex expression is correct so not really sure why regex isn't working for me (so I can ditch the loop).</p>
