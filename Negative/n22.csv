"27868880","1","","","2015-01-09 20:39:49","","0","35","<p>I'm working on building a front-end interface that needs to access a database via sqlite (queries only, no inserts). In one part, as the user types some information into a text field, this will cause a different display window to be populated with results from a sqlite query in close-to-real time. However, because of the size of the database, I have included a thread timer to wait until 1.5 seconds after the last keystroke before starting the query so that there aren't any freezes/pauses as the user is typing.</p>

<p>This detects changes to the text field:</p>

<pre><code>def airlineTextChanged(self):
    self.lastAirlineTime = time.time()
    t = threading.Timer(1.5,self.applyAirlineChanges)
    t.start()
</code></pre>

<p>And calls this after creating the timer thread:</p>

<pre><code>def applyAirlineChanges(self):
    if time.time() - self.lastAirlineTime &gt; 1.5:
        airlineArray = self.sanitizeInput(self.airlineText.text())
        self.db.desiredAirline = airlineArray
        self.redraw()
</code></pre>

<p>Redraw is what calls the query and updates the display fields:</p>

<pre><code>def redraw(self):
    data = self.db.getResults()
    self.outputText.setText(str(len(data)))
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the crash happens, when I try to do anything with data (get length, access elements, anything). Python.exe crashes without exception, with the exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005), which from what I've found has to do with stack overflow or writing to bad memory, which seems strange as python is supposed to take care of all of that for me.</p>

<p>Self.db is the wrapper class which handles all of the sqlite interaction</p>

<p>dbOpen makes a connection:</p>

<pre><code>def dbOpen(self,filePath):
    self.con = sqlite3.connect(filePath)
    self.con.text_factory = str
    return self.con.cursor()
</code></pre>

<p>Other methods within the db wrapper can then use this cursor, execute their queries, before closing the cursor and self.con. Here is the getResults() code section that is called by redraw, which creates the ""data"" vairable that causes the crash after being returned:</p>

<pre><code>        cursor = self.dbOpen(self.filePath)
        data = cursor.execute(baseQuery).fetchall()
        cursor.close()
        self.con.close()
        return data
</code></pre>

<p>If I print out data, check the length, or do anything with data before I return it, it works fine, no problems. But like I said above, if I try to do the same things with it after the return, I get the crash, so it seems somehow the returned data is being written in a bad place.</p>

<p>Also, most of the interface elements don't involve typing, so in those cases there are no threads or timers anything like that, and redraw() is called directly (in the same thread as the main flow). This does not crash, which means the crash only happens when trying to access the returned data when redraw() was called from a different thread than the main one.</p>

<p>Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>It goes to page two but it is a blank page. Why is the data not saving from page to page?

<p>As a result I've raised this with my seniors and they are prepared to give it a chance, so they have tasked me with coming up with a way to implement TDD in the development of our enterprise product.</p>

<p>The problem is our system has evolved since the days of VB6 to .NET and implements a lot of legacy technology and some far from best practice development techniques i.e. a lot of business logic in the ASP.NET code behind and client script.  The largest problem however is how our classes are tightly coupled with database access; properties, methods, constructors - usually has some database access in some form or another.  </p>

<p>We use an in-house data access code generator tool that creates sqlDataAdapters that gives us all the database access we could ever want, which helps us develop extremely quickly, however, classes in our business layer are very tightly coupled to this data layer - we aren't even close to implementing some form of repository design.  This and the issues above have created me all sorts of problems.</p>

<p>I have tried to develop some unit tests for some existing classes I've already written but the tests take A LOT longer to run since db access is required, not to mention since we use the MS Enterprise Caching framework I am forced to fake a httpcontext for my tests to run successfully which isn't practical.  Also, I can't see how to use TDD to drive the design of any new classes I write since they have to be so tightly coupled to the database ... help!</p>

<p>Because of the architecture of the system it appears I can't implement TDD without some real hack which in my eyes just defeats the aim of TDD and the huge benefits that come with.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions how I could implement TDD with the constraints I'm bound to? Or do I need to push the repository design pattern down my seniors throats and tell them we either change our architecture/development methodology or forget about TDD altogether? :)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"21786677","1","","","2014-02-14 18:17:41","","0","78","<p>Suppose I have the following hierarchy using the NVI idiom :</p>

<pre><code>class Base
{
    public:
        virtual ~Base() {}
        void foo() { cout &lt;&lt; ""Base::foo"" &lt;&lt; endl; foo_impl(); }

    private:
        virtual void foo_impl() = 0;
};

class A : public Base
{
    private:
        virtual void foo_impl() { cout &lt;&lt; ""A::foo_impl"" &lt;&lt; endl; }
};
</code></pre>

<p>If at some point in the hierarchy I want to ""add"" invariants in the non virtual base method, what would be the best way to do so ?</p>

<p>One way would be to recurse the NVI idiom at the SpecialBase level :</p>

<pre><code>class SpecialBase : public Base
{
    private:
        void foo_impl() { cout &lt;&lt; ""SpecialBase::foo"" &lt;&lt; endl; bar_impl(); }
        virtual void bar_impl() = 0;

};

class B : public SpecialBase
{
    private:
        virtual void bar_impl() { cout &lt;&lt; ""B::bar_impl"" &lt;&lt; endl; }
};
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't really like this idea, since I don't want to add methods (with different names) for each derived bases I add to my hierarchy...</p>

<p>Another way is to have the following (which is not NVI) :</p>

<pre><code>class Base
{
    public:
        virtual ~Base() {}
        virtual void foo() { base_foo(); foo_impl(); }

    protected:
        void base_foo() { cout &lt;&lt; ""Base::foo"" &lt;&lt; endl; }
        virtual void foo_impl() = 0;
};

class SpecialBase : public Base
{
    public:
        virtual void foo() { base_foo(); specialbase_foo(); foo_impl(); }

    protected:
        void specialbase_foo() { cout &lt;&lt; ""SpecialBase::foo"" &lt;&lt; endl; }
};

class B : public SpecialBase
{
    private:
        virtual void foo_impl() { cout &lt;&lt; ""B::foo_impl"" &lt;&lt; endl; }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Which in my opinion is less confusing since at any point a concrete class just has to implement the virtual method, while a derived base class can override the base (virtual) method if it chooses too.</p>

<p>Is there another cleaner way to achieve the same ?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for a very general design pattern that could allow me to have the following kind of hierarchy :</p>

<pre><code>Base &lt;- A
     &lt;- B
     &lt;- SpecialBase &lt;- C
                    &lt;- D
                    &lt;- VerySpecialBase &lt;- E
     &lt;- StrangeBase &lt;- F
</code></pre>

<p>Where each <code>Base</code> class can (and will override foo), whereas classes <code>A-F</code> will only need to reimplement <code>foo_impl</code>.</p>

<p>Note that just adding another optional customization virtual function (e.g <code>bar_impl</code>) won't help here, because it only allow for one extra layer of customization, where I could possibly need an infinite number.</p>

<p>so the red button will be the biggest and go under all of them, then i will add green button on top of red and then yellow button on top of green. so that's how it looks like. each button has a PNG background as i said at the beginning.</p>

<p>Problem is I cant make the only visible area of each Button/ImageView clickable! Android kinda considers each at rectangle button/ImageView.
Any solution for this?</p>

Consider this scenario:</p>

<p>My program has values in var1 and var2 and I have an operand variable. Now my problem is I don't know how to take more than one digit input from the user. I mean, when I enter a digit it is ending. I want to wait until 'Enter' pressed. Also the program needs to continue after ""+"" operand should continue with -,*,/ but its finishing after first answer. What can I do for these improvements ?  </p>

The array is comprised of the contents of a column of cells in the second sheet (which is named ""phrases."").  </p>

<p>So (looking at it another way) in ""phrases"" I have 100 strings typed into column P, cells 3 to 102.  And I want to put all of them into an array that i can use later.</p>

<p>Now, let me complicate it a little - my intent is that users of the spreadsheet will be able to add new content to column P, so that it may eventually be 500 cells or more.  So I really want to populate that array dynamically.</p>

<p>Here's where i am - and it doesn't seem to be working:</p>

<pre><code>Dim newarray() As String
Dim i As Long
Dim counter As Long
counter = 0
For i = 0 To 5000
    If Worksheets(""phrases"").Cells(i + 3, 16).Value &lt;&gt; 0 Then
    newarray(counter) = Worksheets(""phrases"").Range(i + 3, 16).Value
    counter = counter + 1
    End If
Next

<p>Where am i going wrong?</p>

<p>Please note - I've tried this without <code>.Value</code> - didn't seem to work.
I've tried this with <code>.Text</code> instead of <code>.Value</code> - didn't seem to work.
I've tried <code>CStr(Worksheets(""phrases"").Range(i + 3, 16).Value)</code> and several variations - and it didn't seem to work.</p>

<p>which is filling the log and making the file in some GB size. So I want to disable the logs for the cache read and write so I can stop this. I have tried various things:</p>

<pre><code>module ActionView
  class LogSubscriber &lt; ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber
    def logger
      @memoized_logger ||= Logger.new('/dev/null')
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I kept this file in initializers folder but didn't help. The second thing in initializer I tried is:</p>

<pre><code>Rails.cache.silence!
</code></pre>

<p>But still nothing changed. Also I tried this in <code>production.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>config.cache_store.silence!
</code></pre>

<p>But this threw an error. I think probably there is no <code>cache_store</code> defined.</p>

<p>Also in the initializers I tried this:</p>

<pre><code># Create logger that ignores messages containing “CACHE”
class CacheFreeLogger &lt; ::Logger
  def debug(message, *args, &amp;block)
    super unless message.include? 'Read fragment'
  end
end

# Overwrite ActiveRecord’s logger
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(
  CacheFreeLogger.new(STDOUT)) unless Rails.env.test?
</code></pre>

<p>Still no help.</p>

<p>I got another answer which might help but I don't know how to use this. Here is the link:</p>

<p>My current task includes leading data from a CSV file in the format of:</p>

<pre><code>row1data1,row1data2,row1data3
row2data1,row2data2,row2data3
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>From what I've gathered, the csv.reader/csvfile built-in module creates a single string from each row. I need two strings from each row, with the comma being the delimiter.</p>

<p>This is the my current code and output.</p>

<p>CODE:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
with open('Sparrow.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    CSVReader = csv.reader(csvfile, quotechar='|')
    for row in CSVReader:
       print( ""TEXT"" )
       print( ""\n"" )
       print( ""TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'%s'"" % "" "".join(row))
       print( ""\n"" )
       print( ""TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'%s'"" % "" "".join(row))
       print( ""\n"" )
       print( ""TEXT"" )       
       print( ""\n"" )
       print( ""('%s'));"" % "" "".join(row))
       print( ""\n"" )
       print( ""\n"" )
</code></pre>

<p>OUTPUT</p>

<pre><code>TEXT
TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'row1data1 row1data2 row1data3'
TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'row1data1 row1data2 row1data3'
TEXT
('row1data1 row1data2 row1data3'));


TEXT
TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'row2data1 row2data2 row2data3'
TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'row2data1 row2data2 row2data3'
TEXT
('row2data1 row2data2 row2data3'));
</code></pre>

<p>Again, to clarify, I need to split the strings so the output is as displayed below.</p>

<pre><code>TEXT
TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'row1data1'
TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'row1data2'
TEXT
('row1data3'));


TEXT
TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'row2data1'
TEXT INPUT REQUIRED:'row2data2'
TEXT
('row2data3'));
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is something very easy that I'm missing and any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I was debugging / testing my mass updater console application and after the program successfully terminated I realized that in my app configuration file it was pointing to a production environment, not a test environment. That said and done, about 200 contacts' information went a bit off track. Thankfully though I was only updating text fields and not lookup fields. There is an audit log turned on for contacts so I can see exact fields that are changed.</p>

<p>This may not be programming related question but is there any way to ""roll back"" those updates from audit logs? If not straight from the UI have any of you ever done something similar with code? I can easily find those contacts using ""modified date"" and ""modified by"" information. Can I somehow retrieve audit logs for those contacts and compare old and new value and rollback the old value if necessary?</p>

It should support search by secondary indexes, operators AND/OR, results ordering and range queries. I expect high amounts of concurrent reads and writes, where the latter are usually multiple object updates on a small subset of the object's properties (or row columns in SQL).</p>

<p>I have explored Hazelcast and CQEngine, but they don’t seem to support such partial updates, i.e. if I need to update a single property of 1000 objects it will rebuild ALL indexes on all the 1000 objects, instead of updating the index for the changed property only.</p>

<p>I could also explore some relational databases like H2 and SQLite, but the problem there is that the set of columns per table (object's properties) is dynamic, i.e. can change dynamically at runtime. This would lead to altering the schema and rebuilding the whole table and indexes whenever I need to add/remove columns.</p>

<p>If I add align=""middle"" to the image inputs, then they move 12 pixels down, so they are 5 pixels too low, which boggles my mind.  More confusingly, the CSS vertical-align property doesn't affect input elements (they ignore it), so I have a hard time imagining how to fix this in CSS.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>When I run the transform, the template is not matched, but if I remove the <code>&lt;l3:requestType&gt;</code> element from the SOAP Header (without making any other changes), it works fine. Anyone have a clue as to why?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

            Console.ReadLine();

</code></pre>

<p>If you run that, the template is not matched and you get the default behavior of returning the value of all nodes: <code>Valid&lt;Test xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:l3=""http://tempuri.org/l3""&gt;126381&lt;/Test&gt;</code>; however, if you comment out line 21 (<code>""&lt;l3:requestType&gt;Valid&lt;/l3:requestType&gt;"" +</code>), the template <em>is</em> matched, and you get the expected result: <code>&lt;Test xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:l3=""http://tempuri.org/l3""&gt;126381&lt;/Test&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>Whoops, just noticed that the first result I posted above isn't quite the default behavior, but it isn't well-formed XML, which is what threw me off. Sorry about that -- should've looked closer when copying and pasting! I guess the question now is: when an element is included in the SOAP Header, why is its value returned, even though that was not intended from the XSLT template?</p>

    dochead.appendChild(newscript);

<p>but I just got a blank page. I looked in Chrome developer tools and it seemed to be loading their script properly. Their script loads other scripts from Google, and they showed up in the DOM as well. But there was no ad image.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script language=""JavaScript"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;

<p>The problem is, that the existing nodes are optional. Therefore, I can't use XPath to find node <code>&lt;r&gt;</code> and insert the new node after it. </p>

<p>I would like to avoid the ""brute force method"": Search from <code>&lt;r&gt;</code> up to <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> to find a node that exists.</p>

<p>I also want to preserve the order, since the XML document has to conform to a XML schema.</p>

<p>XSLT as well as normal XML libraries can be used, but since I'm only using Saxon-B, schema aware XSLT processing is not an option.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea on how to insert such a node?</p>

I have my dialog, data comes fine and writes in database.
I'm doing some improvements. Today this works starting from one Activity. My will is this occurs in all application and start after a interval. And this is the moment when problems arise.
I'm using AlertManager to schedule my action. I have a BroadcastReceiver that, checks my database and starts to get data from web. At this point I'm facing problems. My progress dialog aren't shown and data doesn't come totally from web.</p>

<p>Code from BroadcastReceiver:</p>

<pre><code>import android.app.Activity;

        try {
            mHandler = new Handler();
            Log.i(""INFO"", ""SCHEDULED"");
            if(checkDataBase(context)){
                updateData(context);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e) {       
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private boolean checkDataBase(Context context){
        String path = ""/data/data/""+context.getPackageName()+""/databases/mdsdacpdatabase.db"";
        SQLiteDatabase database = null;

        boolean result = false;
        try{
            database = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(path, null, SQLiteDatabase.CREATE_IF_NECESSARY);
            database.close();
            result = true;
        }
        catch(SQLiteException e){
        }

        return result;
    }

<p>My conclusions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>BroadcastReceivers can't display dialogs because they aren't
Activities(like Commonsware point out);</li>
<li>BroadcastReceivers can't
handle orientation issues that crashes app(I fix this in my activity
overriding onCreateDialog method);</li>
<li>Handlers aren't indicated to use
in BroadcastReceivers;</li>
<li>Services aren't indicated to do this kind of
task;</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought a way to solve this. Creating a class that inherits from activity and inside that I handle orientation issues, schedule my broadcast in it to download the content at some time and displays dialog. And all of other classes inherits from it.
This solution works I think, but it's big workaround to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Sorry if my question is too long. I would like to discuss some other solutions(if what I proposed is a valid solution, I didn't tested).</p>

"7867215","1","","","2011-10-23 15:51:32","","1","70","<p>I have the following problem. In my application, every user could execute actions through a web client, as well as through email. Every action (a method in a controller class) has to implicitly store a notification in an external key-value store (I am using Redis) In addition, if the action was executed via email, the executor has to be notified about the state of the action (success/failure) via email as well. The main problem that I experience is how to engineer the whole structure with maximum separation of concerns. For instance, I do not want the controller methods themselves to do anything about storing the notification/sending a response email. </p>

<p>Initially I wanted to use AOP, and simply decorate my methods with @Action(""actionType""), unfortunately I would also need to know who the sender is. As far as I know, I cannot assign values to annotation attributes at runtime, so I had to think of another way. </p>

<p>The second approach would be to use an ""Around"" intereceptor, to stop the execution of a method, grab the current user (from a session-scoped userService), but again, that would work for the web controller only, because the mail processing class is stateless, and is unaware of a concept such as currentUser (the only way I can grab the sender is through the email paramater that it is supplied with, every time when a new mail comes)</p>

<p>I guess, the simplest approach would be to call a notification service explicitly, from every method that needs notification (in both, the web request controller, and the mail processor), but again, that would lead to the methods knowing a little bit too much.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

It seems as if this function/query does an excellent job of averaging as I am getting 744 records with no problems.  However from June 8 to June 16 it seems to skip the averaging and group by.  As massive as the data is I have combed through trying to find a reason why this might occur.  It seems as if the data in those rows are no different than the data in the other rows and there should be no reason for skipping of records from June 8 to June 16.  There are NULLS, but I would assume AVG would just skip this data? Has anyone seen this particular pattern of skipping records especially as it pertains to the AVG and GROUP BY function?</p>

<p>The problem is that none of the jquery stuff works in the buttons that I put in the table. If i put the same button out of the table (i.e. do not dynamically generate it) then it works fine but then I dont get one button per column.</p>

<p>Never had this issue before. The first time I launch GlassFish, everything works fine.
Then I shut it down and that works.
Then when I start again, it says the Admin Port: 4848 is busy.</p>

<p>Apparently the shutdown is not releasing the admin port. (Although it does seem to be shutting down, because if I try to navigate to localhost:4848 from my browser it hangs)</p>

<p>When I do a lsof -i :4848 it shows me ""*:appserv-http (LISTEN)"" is listening. When I kill -9 that process that releases the port. But why does it need to be so difficult (especially since none of this can be handled by my IDE!)</p>

<p>We have three of same hardware Windows 7 Professional computers. No one of them is connected to a domain or directory service etc.</p>

<p>We run same executable image on all three computers. <strong>In one of them</strong>, I had to rename it. Because, with my application's original filename, it has no write access to it's working directory.</p>

<p>I setup full access permisions to USER group in working directory manually but this did not solve.</p>

<p>I suspect some kind of deny mechanism in Windows based on executable's name.
I searched the registry for executable's name but I did not find something relevant or meaningfull.</p>

<p>This situation occured after lot of crashes and updates of my program on that computer (I am a developer). One day, it suddenly started not to open files. I did not touch registry or did not change something other on OS.</p>

<hr>

<p>My executable's name is karbon_tart.exe
When it start, it calls CreateFile (open mode  if exist or create mode if not exist) to open karbon_tart.log file and karbon_tart.ini file.
With the files are exist and without the file exists, I tried two times and none of them, the program can open the files.
But if I just rename the name to karbon_tart_a.exe, program can open files no matter if they are exist or not.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest

<p>For simplicity let's say that the User object only has a nickname field.</p>

<p>The server currently does various validations that ensure that the foo can be saved. (e.g. Logged in user has access or username contains no invalid characters) If the new foo cannot be created an error code in the 400's is returned with a list of error messages.</p>

<p>However, I would like to be able to warn users of the api that the nickname may not work in the way they expected. (e.g. They already have a foo with that nickname or that nickname will not work if used with one of our legacy features.)</p>

<p>I definitely don't want to completely prevent them from creating a foo with such a nickname but they should know about the potential issue and have a chance to go back if they choose.</p>

<p>I see three ways to deal with this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add a '/foo/validate' endpoint that allows a POST (or potentially PUT) of the foo they are hoping to make. This endpoint would return any fatal and non-errors in a way that allows them to tell the difference. If there are no fatal errors they would know that a POST to '/foo' would successfully create a new object since '/foo' does not perform validation for non-fatal errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a parameter to the foo object like 'force.' If a user performs a POST to '/foo' without 'force' set to true, the server will abort saving the new instance for both fatal and non-fatal errors. If the user noticed that only non-fatal errors were returned, they could set 'force' to true and try again. This time, non-fatal errors would be ignored and the new foo would be created.</p></li>
<li><p>If the user performs a POST with an object that has only non-fatal errors, the server creates the new foo and in the response body there would be a list of these errors (and a non-201 status code?). The user could then decide whether they wanted to a) leave the object as-is b) update the new foo to avoid the warnings, or c) DELETE the foo.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I realize that any of these would work but, I'm wondering which approach fits best with web standards. Now that I typed them out, I'm thinking that 3 is probably the closest although I'm not sure what status code to return for an object that was created (201) but was not perfectly 'successful.'</p>

I have a multi-domain project, the thing is that i would like to separate each controller and view into Club and Center folders, but i don't know how to configure a route to search for a controller into a folder. </p>

<p>This is the structure:</p>

<pre><code>Controllers
|----------Club
|          |---IndexCtrl
|          |---ClientsCtrl
|          |--- ...
| 
|----------Center
           |----IndexCtrl
           |----UsersCtrl
           |----ServicesCtrl
           |---- ...
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my <code>routes.php</code> file with some configurations saw in other answers:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Routes for site.club
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
*/
Route::group(array(

  'domain' =&gt; 'site.club',
  'namespace' =&gt; 'Club',//I saw this on other SO answer, I guess it's the folder
  'prefix' =&gt; 'club',//Also on the other SO answer

), function() {

    Route::get('/', [
        'as' =&gt; 'publicIndex',
        'uses' =&gt;'IndexCtrl@inicio'
    ]);

});

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Routes for site.center
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
*/
Route::group(array(

  'domain' =&gt; 'site.center',
  'namespace' =&gt; 'Center',
  'prefix' =&gt; 'center',

), function() {

    Route::get('/', [
        'as' =&gt; 'adminIndex',
        'uses' =&gt;'IndexCtrl@inicio'
    ]);

});
</code></pre>

<p>Now my guess is: how would I configure the Controller?, the example just said to set the namespace as the path to the folder, in that case my namespace would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php namespace Site\Http\Controllers\Center;
</code></pre>

<p>Is that right?</p>

<p>Or do I just have to run <code>composer dump-autoload</code>?</p>

<p>The result of the above is an error and it says: </p>

<p><code>Class Site\Http\Controllers\IndexCtrl does not exist</code></p>

What are the things one should consider when answering that question?  Does it matter which tests are failing?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Background information that prompted this question:</p>

<p>Currently I am working on a project that has <a href=""http://www.nunit.org/"">NUnit</a> tests that are done as part of the build procedure and are executed on our <a href=""http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/"">cruise control .net</a> build machine.</p>

<p>The project used to be setup so that if any tests fail, the build fails.  The reasoning being if the tests fail, that means the product is not working/not complete/it is a failure of a project, and hence the build should fail.</p>

<p>We have added some tests that although they fail, they are not crucial to the project (see below for more details).  So if those tests fail, the project is not a complete failure, and we would still want it to build.</p>

<p>One of the tests that passes verifies that incorrect arguments result in an exception, but the test does not pass is the one that checks that all the allowed arguments do <em>not</em> result in an exception.  So the class rejects all invalid cases, but also some valid ones.  This is not a problem for the project, since the rejected valid arguments are fringe cases, on which the application will not rely.</p>

<ul>
<li>library_name</li>
<li>library_number</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>To do so what I did is to set a parameter --library with an append action and add a type to the parameter so it reads it the right format, what lead to the following command line:
--library ""library_name=test;library_number=5"", the library type function will test and do the work, but this is not realy a pretty way to do it, there is any other way to do what I want ?</p>

<p>I wanted to use the nargs like this:</p>

<pre><code>--library test 5
</code></pre>

<p>this look better to me however the type function I want to associate cannot be a complex one as it is runed on each values of the returned array!</p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<hr>

<p>I should explain a little bit more what I'm trying to do. I'm working on a workflow manager engine. This one specify a property file where are define all parameters and this parameter list is parsed to build the right argparse object.</p>

<p>As example I can define my library parameter as define before:
    library_name.name = ...
    library_name.help = ...
    library_name.type = str
    library_name.required = True </p>

<pre><code>library_number.name = ...
library_number.help = ...
library_number.type = int
library_number.required = True 
...
</code></pre>

<p>But I want this object set as many as library the user want so I could add to those options an append action what would work but the user would have to provide all inputs in the right order:</p>

<pre><code>--library-name lib1 --library-number 1 --library-name lib2 --library-number 2
</code></pre>

<p>but this is not that easy for the user, what I did is:</p>

<pre><code>--library ""name=lib1;number=1"" --library ""name=lib2;number=2""
</code></pre>

<p>but this is not ""pretty"", I would prefer something like this but I still want to check if this is the right format:</p>

<pre><code>--library lib1 1 --library lib2 2
</code></pre>

<p>Is that clearer?</p>

<hr>

<p>I should explain a bit more, I changed what you give me so the user can --library library-name=test library-number=5, so all fields are not necessary provided, however I would like some of them to be required, but to do so I need to know once all parameters are checked if the required ones have been settled</p>

<pre><code>    class MiltipleParameters(object):
        def __init__(self, types):
            self.types = types
            self.index = None
            self.__name__ = ""MiltipleParameters""
        def __call__(self, arg):
            parts = arg.split(""="")
            if not self.types.has_key(parts[0]):
                raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError(parts[0] + "" is an invalid flag! Available ones are: ""+"", "".join(self.types.keys()))
            try:
                value = self.types[parts[0]](parts[1])
            except:
                raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError(""invalid "" + self.types[parts[0]].__name__ + "" value: '"" + parts[1] + ""' for sub parameter '"" + parts[0] + ""'"")
            self.index = parts[0]
            return (parts[0], value)
</code></pre>

<p>this type take a hash table with the param_name:type, I could add the required field so it can be checked. But I do need to know when it is over to check if the required params where set.
Is it possible ?</p>

<pre><code>//For when I want to dynamically bind a function or something similar
void RegisterRPCFunction(const char* name,void (*func)(),const FunctionDescription&amp;  description);

//Packs the parameters for us, convenience function
template&lt;typename Result,typename... Params&gt;
Result RPCCall(const char* name,Params... vars);

<p>I've been able to plan out how to get the type data stored &amp; working. My one thing is I seem to have only 2 choices for calling the functions from an array or map.</p>

<p>Have each function be of a specific format. Something like</p>

<pre><code>typedef void (*RPCFunction)(Any* parameters,size_t parameters,Any* result);
</code></pre>

<p>but then each function needs to be aware of the RPC system and that just seems unwieldy.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Push the parameters onto the stack directly, then call a function with a specified format.</p>

<pre><code>void stuff(int);
typedef void(*voidfunc)();

voidfunc func = (voidfunc)stuff;

//Manually push onto stack here

func();

//Make sure nothing is wrong with the stack here.

<p>This gets into messy platform specific territory but once the behind the scenes mess is taken care of then it would be much easier to work with if I have to use the reflection system for structs anyways. Might have some limitations, but I wasn't needing it to work for everything. Just basic types, strings, and simple structs.</p>

<p>My question is how on earth would I do number 2 or is there a better way of keeping a bunch of functions of different types in a list and calling them that doesn't involve that mess.</p>

SimpleCV can take OpenCV images easily, but getting SimpleCV image out for legacy cv or mahotas seems to be quite a task.</p>

<p>Some format conversion syntaxes would be really appreciated. For example, if I open a greyscale image using mahotas, it is treated to be in floating point colour space by default, as I gather. Even when I assign the type as numpy.uint8, cv2 cannot seem to recognise it as an array. I do not know how to solve this problem. I am not having much luck with colour images either.

<p>Sunny's solution is correct. The new problem was appending <code>/site-packages/bitarray</code>

<p>I'd like to make it so that the first two columns have a fixed width and that the third column takes up the rest of the space on the page. Just setting percentage widths for everything is an option, but not preferable.</p>

While working without clears is possible, I'd a limitation I would like to avoid if possible.</p>

<p>The files (fully encoded, start-to-finish, TS/M3U8 files) are already being served off CloudFront, so there's only so much we can do on the server side to optimize this (I think).</p>

<p>The other hope was to run a localhost server in the iOS app, have this ""server"" manage downloads by prioritizing fewer, larger segment downloads over more frequent, smaller segment downloads. Thus hopefully circumventing the high latency of the network, while still being able to use the decent bandwidth available.</p>

<p>The idea here, was to keep the knowledge of the base ""index.m3u8"" and all the bitrates it describes, to ourselves, and expose only a naive ""playlist"" of TS files (without any bitrate information) to iOS.</p>

<p>However, where I'm stuck is in trying to figure out how iOS will actually request the TS files. That is, even when iOS tries to play a ""straight"" M3U8 file (one without multiple bitrates), I believe it will try to send range requests for the TS files. But without knowing the bitrate of these files, what byte-range would iOS request localhost? Even if it does request a specific byte-range, how could it POSSIBLY be correct? Since the previous file I had served from localhost to iOS, may have been say ""5.ts"" with a bitrate of 1 Mbps, and the next one could be ""6.ts"" with a bitrate of 500 Kbps. iOS cannot possibly estimate what the correct byte-range for the next file would be?? </p>

<p>Can the approach I have outlined (switching bitrates for each TS file, transparent to iOS) even work? Or must all TS files specified in an M3U8 compulsorily have the same bitrate as per some part of the HLS spec that I haven't read?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I might be confusing a few things or have not properly understood how iOS works with basic streaming in general. Some real knowledge on this would be extremely helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p>it returns 32 instead of 64.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I have tried everyone's suggestions and nothing is working. I've changed the execution, and enviroment variables to point to the newst JDK I have which is 1.6_30. when I run the program from a command line I get 64 and amd64 as the value when I run the same program in eclise I get 32 and i386. Something is wrong in eclipse that is causing it to try and run it on a 32 bit JVM. when I try java -d32 -version it says that a 32 bit enviroment isn't installed but Eclipse doesn't know that. I've modified the Eclipse.ini file and still nothing is working. I've restarted eclipse after these changes...nothing. Can some one who knows eclipse well people help me out here. thanks</p>

<p>The select query which it generates, can be executed in sqldeveloper! Can anyone help me with this?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>

<p>Updated detailed stack trace above for repository.findByName(""test"").</p>

<p>I have a spring boot setup with my own datasource, EntityManagerFactory &amp; TransactionManager configuration.</p>

<p>If I run findAll, it works. 
I also found out that, when i execute bare select query such as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>select * from customer where name = 'test'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It works!</p>

<p>But, when I use namedParameterJdbcTemplate and pass parameter, it gives above issue of 'invalid character'!</p>

<pre><code>String sql = ""select * from customer where name = :name"";
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; paramMap = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
paramMap.put(""name"", ""test"");
List&lt;Map&lt;String,Object&gt;&gt; objList = namedParameterJdbcTemplate.queryForList(sql, paramMap);

<p>One of the problems I am now having is that I was using the built in database to handle the login that is behind many of the basic MVC apps in most tutorials. I now need to change to access the login details of a live production system this but cant find where to do it.</p>

<p>I initially taught is would be as simple as changing the connection string, but the production database is totally different than the made up example.</p>

<p>It is not obvious to me where the model / controller is getting the data from. For example, where does the model / controller retreive the user name or compair the password. If I knew this then I could alter my solution to point to the correct database / tables / fields.</p>

<p>Also, my real database is modelled in EF and is in a separate project within the same solution. So I have MyProject.Data and MyProject.Web and eventually will have MyProject.Test ect.</p>

<p>Any help here would be greatly appreicated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT 1: The real database also has a login table with user name and password fields, just like the MVC simple login db. However the database is obviously not part of the system like in the sample projects. Instead it is sitting on the server waiting to be accessed.</p>

<p>My problem is that I dont know where to go to make the changes needed. I was thinking it would be the connection string but this is not working. Even the errors I get just point me back to the connection string as opposed to giving me a line of code to find.</p>

<p>How would I go about doing this purely in an HTML document? I am currently doing this within the Java code itself, but I understand this is bad practice, and I don't know how to retrieve the number the type in - how would I do that?</p>

Important to notice is, that the attribute value of the ""file field"" seems only to be available after the <code>$_POST</code> var is set, meaning that a normal custom validation rule in the Model Class won't work since the <code>$_POST</code> value of the file field is only available after submission (in the <code>$_FILES</code> var).</p>

In so doing, we are working with five threads:</p>

<ol>
<li>Main Thread: create other threads and do some side processing (read data from the interface app, etc.)</li>
<li>UPP Thread: receives data from the hardware and put it in a buffer</li>
<li>DSP Thread: picks the data from the previous buffer and ask DSP processor to calculate with this data. Returned data is stored in a second buffer</li>
<li>DB Thread: After some time, picks a reasonable amount of calculated data and stores them in the file system.</li>
<li>Interface Thread: Picks current data and send to the interface app</li>
</ol>

<p>This application can't miss any data pack coming by the UPP Thread, which gets new data each 200 ms. DSP Thread usually takes less then this 200 ms (for now it's taking ~30 ms, but in the future it will take more time). DB Thread is called normally once every 30 s and Interface thread is called in 5 Hz frequency. </p>

<p>The problem we are facing is that, from time to time, the threads take more time to do their job, specially the DB and the DSP threads. IOW, while the system works with a run of DSP per each run of UPP, some times the UPP is run up to 15 times without any call to DSP leaving to loss of data received. These sporadic ""lags"" in the threads occurs in all of them, but lags in the DB and Interface are not problematic, only when they ocurr in the UPP or DSP threads.</p>

<p>We check everything we could to try to find in our code where the problem lies without success - most of the time the system runs without any lags. We noticed some patterns, though: </p>

<ul>
<li>the lags are more prone to occur when the interface is running with one of the most ""heavy"" widgets visible.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, the increase in required processing doesn't seems to be the cause: stressing the system with some ""junk processing"" AND the interface open didn't increase lag occurrence.</li>
<li>It's probably not something directly related to the interface and that particular widget; all of its processing are similar in time (so any error would probably end being <em>non</em> randomic, which is not the case) </li>
</ul>

<p>We are starting to think it's something with Linux. Normally, in day to day use of PCs, some lags with the mouse or the applications do occur and Linux may be doing this to us. We also thought about being the use of the RAM memory, shared between the main Omap L138 processor and the DSP processor, but some tests gave negative evidence to that hypothesis. </p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions? Could Linux really be the source of the problem? How could we know and how could we fix?</p>

<p>Any help will be appreciated. </p>

<p>I'm trying to calculate the minimum bounding sphere for a 3-dimensional triangle.
The triangle is given by the points point0, point1, point2.</p>

<p>The code below was created from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle#Barycentric_coordinates_from_cross-_and_dot-products"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle#Barycentric_coordinates_from_cross-_and_dot-products</a></p>

<p>For the sample input (0,0,10), (0,10,0), (10,0,0), the following code gives:</p>

<p>radius = 8.164967, which is correct (verified by using Google Sketchup to draw a model).</p>

<p>minSphereCenter = (10, 3.333..., 1.111...), which is incorrect.</p>

<p>The correct center point would be (3.333..., 3.333..., 3.333...).</p>

<hr>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Note: I know that this will not give the minimum bounding sphere for obtuse triangles.</p>

<p><strong>--Solution--</strong></p>

<pre><code>class Triangle{
  Vector3f point0, point1, point2;

  Vector3f minSphereCenter;

  float minSphereRadius;

  private void calculateMinimumBoundingSphere() {
    minSphereRadius=
      (point0.distance(point1)*point1.distance(point2)*point2.distance(point0))/
                (2*(new Vector3f().cross(new Vector3f().sub(point0, point1), new Vector3f().sub(point1, point2)).length()));

    float divisor=2*(new Vector3f().cross(new Vector3f().sub(point0, point1), new Vector3f().sub(point1, point2)).lengthSquared());

    float
      i=point1.distanceSquared(point2)*new Vector3f().sub(point0, point1).dot(new Vector3f().sub(point0, point2))/

<p>My code runs, but I'm not able to get the 'username' of the impersonated user.  I understand this is because i'm using LOGON_TYPE_NEW_CREDENTIALS as my logon type, which technically doesn't impersonate, but runs network connections under the impersonated account using the token.  This works fine, but ideally my site would run under the impersonated user, so I can get the username, and possibly other features.  Basically I want to interact with the site as the impersonated user, not just run network connections as the impersonated user.  I've tried LOGON32_LOGON_INTERACTIVE as the logon type, but this doesn't allow me to authenticate domain accounts on my site which is running on a none domain computer.</p>

<p>I'm using ASP.NET MVC, but this question pertains more to usability and security. I understand that what I'm seeing is expected behavior, and taking a look at the <code>Password(...)</code> method shows me that it explicitly ignores the value in <code>ModelState</code>.</p>

<p>The current design requires the user to enter the credentials in the web application to download the desktop application. Once the desktop application is downloaded and launched, it again asks for user credentials. I am trying to figure out if there is anyway I can save something (cookie or keychain entry) on the user machine when the web application is run and then access that information in the desktop application to avoid asking for credetials again.</p>

<p>I have a TableView controller that subclasses UITableViewController and that owns an additional property of type myContainer as well as an array of items.</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, strong) myContainer * parentContainer;
@property(nonatomic, strong) NSArray * allItems;
</code></pre>

<p>myContainer is a NSManaged object that contains a NSSet * of objects of type myItem :</p>

<pre><code>@interface myContainer : NSManagedObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSSet *subItems;
</code></pre>

<p>I have implemented the delete function like this :</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
if (editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete) {

    NSManagedObjectContext *context = [[Catalog sharedCatalog] managedObjectContext];
    myItem *selectedItem = [self.parentContainer.subItems allObjects][indexPath.row];
    [context deleteObject:selectedItem];
    [self viewWillAppear:NO];
    [self.view setNeedsDisplay];
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p><em>(note that the instruction</em> [context deleteObject:selectedItem] <em>gives me a warning</em> ""Incompatible pointer types sending 'myObject *' to parameter of type 'NSManagedObject <em>' ; but I doubt this is relevant for what follows)</em></p>

<p>The method viewWillAppear is like this :</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    self.allItems = [self.parentContainer.subItems allObjects];
    NSLog(@""%lu objects"",(unsigned long)[self.allItems count]);
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];
    [self.tableView reloadData];
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the purpose of understanding what happens I also subclassed cellForRowAtIndexPath</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView
     cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { 
    // .. //
    myItem * selectedItem = self.allItems[indexPath.row];
    NSLog(@""%lu : %@"",indexPath.row,[selectedItem description]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now assume I first load my table and it contains 3 objects. I receive the log :</p>

<pre><code>3 objects
0 : item0
1 : item1
2 : item2
</code></pre>

<p>I swipe and delete the second item. The view updates but the corresponding cell does not disappear; it just becomes empty. The log reads like this :</p>

<pre><code>3 objects
0 : item0
1 : (null)
2 : item2
</code></pre>

<p>Now I do anything else that will reload the view : either go the previous view and come back, go to a further view and come back, or delete a second object. Then everything is fine as expected and the log is :</p>

<pre><code>2 objects
0 : item0
1 : item2
</code></pre>

<p>I have seen the two following questions that seem strongly related but they did not receive any answer that seemed to solve the problem : <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4942326/tablerow-delete-but-still-showon-in-table-view"">tablerow delete but still showon in table view</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26370340/commiteditingstyle-delete-data-but-continue-to-display-row"">commitEditingStyle: delete data but continue to display row</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I also know that there is a better way to suppress cell calling [tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPath ..]  (and it works here)  but I would really like to understand the output that I get and what coreData is doing with the objects behind my back...</p>

<p>I can't get my head around what is happening here. I tried several variations on the previous code but nothing seemed to solve my problem.</p>

I am representing a spatial map (map of a metropolitan area, say) in a polar coordinate system. I have recorded data from people in a 10x10 home suburban neighbourhood asking where they would like to live in this metropolitan area given by <code>(r,theta)</code> -- <code>r</code> the distance from the center, <code>theta</code> the angle around the x axis, so I am using a polar coordinate system and using HSV to color code it, keeping <code>V=1=constant</code>. After getting the HSV color of each home, I transformed this 10x10x3 HSV matrix to RGB and used image() to display the following plot.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/tLjgdV6.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p><strong>Fig1: [10x10 grid representing a neighbourhood. Colours represent where these families want to live in the metropolitan area. Legend shows metropolitan area in polar coords, HSV colorspace where V=1 always.]</strong></p>

<p>Now, I am trying to create a better visual representation of this suburban neighbourhood to see if people are grouped according to their preference of where they would like to live in the metropolitan area. Using </p>

<pre><code>Img2=imresize(Img,1000,'bilinear','colormap','original');
</code></pre>

<p>This increases the size of the 10x10x3 <em>RGB</em> matrix to 10000x10000x3 RGB matrix while using a bilinear interpolation between pixels, thus sort of smoothing out the picture shown here:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/rS3L17K.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p><strong>Fig2: [Big smoothed matrix using bilinear interpolating between pixels]</strong></p>

<p>My question is: Is it valid to use this interpolation method in RGB space, if my main interests lie in HSV space i.e. the polar coordinate metropolitan area? In other words, when this function takes the average colour of many pixels in RGB, will it represent the correct radius, and angle in the metropolitan area?</p>

<p>Thank you so much ahead of time. I apologize for the long winded build up to a potentially simple question.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I can't get R to recognize the functions <code>f</code> and <code>f.</code> if I try using <code>readline()</code> to prompt for user input.  I get the error ""Error in Newton() : could not find function ""f.""""  However, if I comment out the readlines (as above), define <code>f</code> and <code>f.</code> beforehand, then everything works fine.</p></li>
<li><p>I've been trying to make R calculate the derivative of a function.  The problem is that the class object with which R can take symbolic derivatives is <code>expression()</code>, but I want to take the derivative of a <code>function()</code> and have it give me a <code>function()</code>.  In short, I'm having trouble with type conversion between <code>expression()</code> and <code>function()</code>. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have an ugly but effective solution for going from <code>function()</code> to <code>expression()</code>.  Given a function f, <code>D(body(f)[[2]],""x"")</code> will give the derivative of <code>f</code>.  However, this output is an <code>expression()</code>, and I haven't been able to turn it back into a <code>function()</code>.  Do I need to use <code>eval()</code> or something?  I've tried subsetting, but to no avail.  For instance:</p>

<pre><code>g &lt;- expression(sin(x))
g[[1]]
sin(x)
f &lt;- function(x){g[[1]]}
f(0)
sin(x)
</code></pre>

<p>when what I want is f(0) = 0 since sin(0) = 0.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Thanks all!  Here's my new code:</p>

<pre><code>Newton&lt;-function(f,f.,guess){
    g&lt;-readline(prompt=""Function? "")
    g&lt;-parse(text=g)
    g.&lt;-D(g,""x"")
    f&lt;-function(x){eval(g[[1]])}
    f.&lt;-function(x){eval(g.)}

<p>I have been putting my own twist on the code as I go to make sure I understand it all. However on this one I it is very similar and I am not quite sure why it is acting the way it is. </p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<p>Application.html.erb</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;%- Rails.logger.info(""Testing: #{yield(:title)}"") %&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;%= full_title(yield(:title)) %&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag    ""application"", :media =&gt; ""all"" %&gt;
    &lt;%= javascript_include_tag ""application"" %&gt;
    &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;%= yield %&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Application_helper.rb</p>

<pre><code>module ApplicationHelper
  def full_title(page_title)
    full_title = ""Ruby on Rails Tutorial App""
    full_title += "" | #{page_title}"" unless page_title.blank?
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Home.html.erb</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= t(:sample_app) %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is the home page for the &lt;a href=""http://railstutorial.org/""&gt;Ruby on Rails Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; sample application
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>about.html.erb</p>

<pre><code> &lt;% provide(:title, t(:about_us)) %&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= t(:about_us) %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
   The &lt;a href=""http://railstutorial.org/""&gt;Ruby on Rails Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a project to make a book and screencast to teach web development with &lt;a href=""http://railstutorial.org/""&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;. This is the sample application for the tutorial.
 &lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What Happens: The code works fine when I set the provide method like on the about page. However when I do not it does not seem to even call the helper. I am assuming that because no title is passed back. Any ideas on what I am doing wrong? </p>

<p>Thank you all for your help.</p>

<p>Edit:
This is the fix. Thanks to Paul for pointing out that the last line was returning nothing and was why my code was not working. Changed it so it return something not mater the case. </p>

<p>Application_helper.rb</p>

<pre><code>module ApplicationHelper
  def full_title(page_title)
    full_title = ""Ruby on Rails Tutorial App""
    page_title.present? ? (full_title += "" | #{page_title}"") : full_title

<p>This works quite well, bindings are resolved at design-time (I can see that in the design panel since my markup extension fills the object properties with a lorem-ipsum)</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> the nicest R# feature dont work: Resharper does not recognize datacontext type, and just gives a message ""Cannot resolve property '{0}' in data context of type 'object'""</p>

<p>In my application, I decided to provide alternative drawable resources and alternative layout files. My structure is as follows:</p>

<p>res/drawable-hdpi/filename.png<br>
res/drawable-mdpi/filename.png<br>
res/drawable-ldpi/filename.png  </p>

<p>res/layout-small/layout.xml<br>
res/layout-large/layout.xml<br>
res/layout/layout.xml  </p>

<p>I created three different emulators: one with the default HVGA, one with QVGA, and one with WVGA800</p>

<p>It doesn't seem to pick up those alternative resources/layouts based on screen size/density, or maybe i just can't tell?</p>

<p>Is there some way, other than using a device for each specific size, to test this? Or am I just missing something important?</p>

<p>Another question, how well does Android scale drawables if no alternative resource exist?</p>

<p>In any case, is there a way to explicitly bind the JVM to a specific IP?</p>

{
    mBrowser.SelectedFilesListView.ItemsSource = mLastElements;

</code></pre>

<p>(OnInitialized gets called and elements is not empty)</p>

<p>As written in the title my problem is that adding and removing items from the collection has absolutely no effect on the listbox, it always remains empty. If I bind the <code>IEnumerable&lt;AssetBrowserFilePreviewElement&gt; elements</code> as ItemsSource instead of this Clear and Add-loop i get the expected results. In this case it would work this way but in other methods i want to selectively remove or add items and therefore I need the observable collection to work.</p>

<p>What else do I have to do to propagate modifications to the collection to the listbox?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
As suggested in the response I've created a property and a binding in XAML but still no response whatsoever.</p>

<p>XAML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox Padding=""10,10,10,10"" x:Name=""SelectedFilesListView"" Grid.Row=""1"" ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=CurrentFiles}""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>C#:</p>

<pre><code>private readonly ObservableCollection&lt;AssetBrowserFilePreviewElement&gt; mCurFiles = new ObservableCollection&lt;AssetBrowserFilePreviewElement&gt;();
public ObservableCollection&lt;AssetBrowserFilePreviewElement&gt; CurrentFiles { get { return mCurFiles; } }


CurrentFiles.Clear();
foreach(var elem in elements)
    CurrentFiles.Add(elem);
</code></pre>

<p>CurrentFiles getter gets called when the control loads. The method that modifies the collection gets called as well, elements.Count == 18, no visual change.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>
I have added a test element to CurrentFiles in the constructor of AssetBrowserViewModel (where the Property is defined and which is set as DataContext). This item shows up, but modifying the elements of the collection keeps showing that test element.</p>

<p>He made this strange claim:  ""I haven't encountered a production REST implementation that is pure REST.  The ones I've seen all have had the server maintain a session.""</p>

<p>I find this difficult to accept.  First there's the technicality that there are plenty of plain HTTP pages out there, all purely RESTful.  Second, yes, there are non-RESTful implementations labeled RESTful, just like there's brass labeled ""gold"".  Third, just because everyone else jumps off a bridge doesn't mean I should.</p>

<p>Background:  It's a JavaScript Ajax web application using HTTPS and Basic authentication.  To avoid the usual (uncustomizeable) browser login popup box, the application shows a login screen with the product logo and text boxes for name and password.  The name and password are stored in the document and sent in the Authorization header for each request.  If you refresh the page, the name and password are lost and the user must type them in again.  That's considered a bug; the UI developer wants to be able to press the refresh button without giving the password again.</p>

<p>So the developer wants to use a cookie or a JSP session.  Abby, is it true that in the end every REST implementation maintains application state on the server?  Or is there a way I can solve this problem and still maintain my RESTful purity?</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide gzip-encoded content on my server along with uncompressed.</li>
<li>Files are pre-compressed.</li>
<li>Not all files are served compressed. I want to specify these files and the choice isn't type (extension) based.</li>
<li>Many content-types (custom ones) are served, and new types are showing up from time to time. Also, file extension doesn't determine if it will be compressed or not (<strong>!!!</strong>).</li>
<li>Keep overhead minimal (the less extra headers, the better).</li>
<li>Always provide Content-Length header and never send chunked response (this disqualifies <code>mod_deflate</code>).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Ideal Functionality</h1>

<p>Ideal functionality would work like that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web client asks for file <code>file.ext</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>file.ext.gz</code> exists on server:
<ul>
<li><code>Content-Encoding</code> is set to <code>gzip</code>.</li>
<li><code>Content-Type</code> is set to value of <code>file.ext</code> (<strong>!!!</strong>).</li>
<li>Server returns <code>file.ext.gz</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Otherwise, <code>file.ext</code> is returned.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tested a number of solutions, <a href=""http://www.cravediy.com/59-Simple-gzip-Support-for-Apache-with-mod_rewrite.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> contains a good compilation, but there was always a problem with parts marked with  (<strong>!!!</strong>). I have hundreds of thousands of files and dozens of content types and because of that I'm looking for some automatic solution, without need of adding <code>ForceType</code> for each file.</p>

<hr>

<h1>What I tried</h1>

<h2>Multiviews</h2>

<p>How this works:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rename a file <code>file.ext</code> to <code>file.ext.en</code></li>
<li>Create a file <code>file.ext.gz</code></li>
<li><p>Configure Apache:</p>

<pre>
Options +MultiViews
AddEncoding x-gzip .gz
RemoveType .gz
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Works almost as expected, except it requires the original file (<code>file.ext</code>) to not exist and it adds many (useless to me) headers (<code>TCN</code>, <code>Content-Language</code> and few more) that can't be removed (<code>Header unset</code> doesn't remove them).</p>

<h2>Rewrite</h2>

<p>How this works:
 - Create <code>file.ext.gz</code> file.
 - Configure Apache:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Encoding} gzip
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.gz -f
RewriteRule (.*)$ $1.gz [L]
AddEncoding x-gzip .gz

&lt;Files file.ext&gt;
    ForceType my-custom/mime-type
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works well, but requires a <code>ForceType</code> for each compressed file. As I said before, I can't rely on extensions because not all files of certain type will be compressed.</p>

<h2><code>mod_deflate</code></h2>

<p>I didn't investigate it too much, the problem is that if file is too big, then it's split into pieces and sent in chunks and <code>Content-Length</code> is not provided. Increasing size of compression buffers can't eliminate this problem.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Is it possible at all to configure Apache to work as I'd liked to?</strong></p>

<p>I tried to dynamically get <code>Content-Type</code> of <code>file.ext</code> and set it to <code>file.ext.gz</code>, but I didn't find the way how to do this.</p>

The program takes two arguments when run from the command line; I'm not sure what the best method would be to run it with PHP. </p>

<p>In particular, the .exe can be run from the command line using the syntax:</p>

<p><code>my_program.exe input_file_name.txt / output_file_name.txt</code></p>

<p>The program processes the data in the input file and puts the processed into into the output file. This all works fine from the command line (in Windows). The .exe is written in Visual Basic (it wasn't written by me). </p>

<p>I know I can normally give <code>exec()</code> a parameter by doing something like:</p>

<p><code>exec('my_program.exe  ""example input parameter""');</code></p>

<p>if the .exe is written to take input from <code>argv()</code>, which I've done for testing. I tried a few things like: </p>

<pre><code>$argument = ""C:\wamp\www\web_dev\test\input.txt / C:\wamp\www\web_dev\test\output.txt"";
exec('C:\wamp\www\web_dev\test\my_program.exe $argument');
</code></pre>

<p>Which didn't work out. (I'm currently trying to get it working on my localhost, in case that's pertinent..)</p>

<p>I believe, since the .exe does all the work of opening, writing to, and closing the input and output files, that I just need to figure out how to code a PHP command that will execute the program in the appropriate fashion. </p>

<p>I've seen similar threads to this one, so I hope I'm not re-asking anything; I wasn't able to find a thread that quite pertained to this situation. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> if it helps, the overall scope I'm working towards is to create a web interface that allows a user to upload a file, then invokes the executable I've been given (which was given to me with the command-line instructions mentioned above) on it and produces an output file for the user with the processed data.</p>

<p>What's the best way to do this?</p>

<p>I can copy the exception message and test for equality:</p>

<pre><code> const string fileNotFoundExceptionMessage = ""The remote server returned an error: (550) File unavailable (e.g., file not found, no access)."";

<p>but theoretically it seems like this message could change down the road.</p>

<p>I can just test to see if the exception message contains ""550"", which is probably more likely to work if the message is changed (it will likely still contain 550 somewhere in the text) but of course will also return true if the text for some other WebException just happens to contain 550.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a method for accessing just the number of the exception.</p>

<p>My site uses Google's Analytics API to show lists of ""popular content"" from around the site. These API calls are slow (2-5 seconds) so I cache their result for an hour. I then have a cron job which runs every 15 minutes and re-requests the data from Google. I realise this might seem a bit odd to cache it for an hour and update it every 15 minutes, I guess it's a kind of dumb failsafe.</p>

<p>I cache the main output of my site for several hours (it doesn't update much more frequently than that). This, of course, means that the part of the template which renders the ""popular content"" won't update in that time period, no matter how often I call the API.</p>

<p>I looked into Django's <code>{% cache %}</code> template tag and tried wrapping my ""popular content"" template view inside a minimally-cached wrapper (1 second cache time, for testing). This works (if I then manually call the Google API and reload my page, the template changes), but I'm not sure if it's going to work as I intend: basically, I don't want to cache the entire page for a few seconds (rather a few hours), but I want it to update when I fetch new data from Google.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me a nudge in the right direction here?</p>

I am using the MediaPlayer for playing a Sound that mustn't be faded in.
It worked well with a Smarthpone with 4.2.1, but on another Phone with 4.4.2 the Fading occurs.</p>

<p>I've also had a look at the SoundPool, but it misses the Feature of letting me know if the File is still playing.</p>

<p>Am I able to switch off the automatic fade-in or do I need to use the Soundpool and keep an eye on the length of the Track on my own?</p>

<p>Thanks,

Research on this website revealed that daemon threads are the answer. If this is not true, please provide me with a suitable alternative and include examples of how to use and create the alternative.</p>

<p>My problem is that I do not understand how to create a daemon thread. I would appreciate an explanation and an example of how to use and create a daemon thread.</p>

<p>There is just one more problem, for my program, I created a resource class that contains all the code for my dealer. The players are subclasses of the dealer and all are subclasses of JPanel. As I say in the subject, this blackjack game uses Swing to display the game and this is where the ""optimal utilization"" comes in. I have the application file in which the dealer and player objects are entered like so:</p>

<pre><code>    public class PanelProject extends JPanel
{

   private PlayerBoxClubs PlayerOne;
   private PlayerBoxHearts PlayerTwo;  
   private PlayerBoxSpades PlayerThree;
   private DealerBoxDiamonds DealerOne;


   public PanelProject()

  setLayout(new BorderLayout());

  JPanel CenterSub = new JPanel();
  CenterSub.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
  add(CenterSub, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

  PlayerOne = new PlayerBoxClubs();
  add(PlayerOne, BorderLayout.WEST);

  PlayerTwo = new PlayerBoxHearts();
  add(PlayerTwo, BorderLayout.CENTER);

  PlayerThree = new PlayerBoxSpades();
  add(PlayerThree, BorderLayout.EAST);   

  DealerOne = new DealerBoxDiamonds();
  add(DealerOne, BorderLayout.NORTH);

  JButton Quit = new JButton(""Quit"");
  Quit.addActionListener(new QuitListener());
  CenterSub.add(Quit, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
   }   
</code></pre>

<p>So, my second question is this: Where should I place the daemon thread, in the application file, in the dealer class (which is the superclass to the players) or somewhere else?</p>

The e-commerce application itself is hosted on a web server that is not in our domain. The machine processing orders is in the domain in our LAN. The e-commerce app will write to a local MSMQ when an order is placed. Our order processing component should connect to this queue and read messages from it. We are not using WCF for this.</p>

<p>If it were up to me I'd either ditch MSMQ and go with RabbitMQ or put a vpn client on both machines like Hamachi.</p>

<p>I know that MSMQ can use HTTP as a transport via IIS. However I can't seem to find much documentation on how to set this up securely. Is it as simple as turning on one of the authentication options in IIS? I would prefer to use basic auth as we plan on doing this over HTTPS. After that, how to send credentials from the order processing component?</p>

2    10000            50000            20000            30000            20     OR
2    50000            NULL             30000            NULL             30     OR
</code></pre>

<p>The user specifies a value of <code>C1</code> and then values for <code>C2</code> and <code>C3</code> (simply one value for c2 and one for c3). Let's say that I have to return the rate column as an output. The last column in the table structure is <code>OPERATOR</code>, which tells me whether the <code>C2</code> and <code>C3</code> values should be <code>AND</code> or <code>OR</code>ed.</p>

<p>I am facing problem in determining the opearator to be used. A user can select any value at her discretion for lower and upper limits. I tried basing my operator selection only on one group - let's say <code>C2</code>, but then that is not right, as I need to evaluate all variabels input by the user to get the correct operator. </p>

<p>Let's say that a user enters a value of <code>0</code> for c2 and enters a value of <code>25000</code> for c3 for <code>c1 = 1</code>. Since the values of c3 correspond to the entry with opeartor value of <code>OR</code>, I should <code>OR</code> the c2 and c3 limit values. In short, if a record with <code>OR</code> operator is found, I have to <code>OR</code> the c2 and c3 groups.</p>

I took the toy example from <a href=""http://codingfreak.blogspot.com/2009/12/creating-and-using-shared-libraries-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for shared library. I modified the Makefile from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10128366/shared-object-library-and-mpi"">this question</a> to suit the toy example. My Makefile now is</p>

<pre><code>CC        = mpicc

CFLAGS    = -Wall -rdynamic -g -fPIC $(INCDIR)

LIBADD    = -L ./ -lcalc_mean

    $(CC) -o $@ main.c $(LIBADD)

<p>I added the path to libpthread.so,.a to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but no avail. I have a self compiled openmpi-1.5.4. If this were a openmpi dependency, shouldn't it have been resolved when I configured it?</p>

<p>Is this error familiar? I am using Ubuntu 11.04, with gcc 4.5.2. I already built and run some mpi parallel programs successfully. But they are large packages configured with autotools. One of the config.log s display the same error. But even that one runs fine.</p>

<p>References to / examples of creating static/shared libraries with mpi will also be appreciated (though Openmpi discourages fully static libraries.)</p>

<p>Thank you very much,</p>

<p>The first way I found is to use grunt.util.spawn to run phantomJs the first time.</p>

<pre><code>//  http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.util#grunt.util.spawn
var phantomJS_child = grunt.util.spawn({
    cmd: './phantomjs-1.9.1-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs',
    args: ['./phantomWorker.js']
},
function(){
    console.log('phantomjs done!'); // we never get here...
});
</code></pre>

<p>And then, every time watch restarts, another task uses grunt.util.spawn to kill the phantomJs process, which is of course VERY ugly. </p>

<p>Is there any better way to  do it?
The thing is that the phantomJs process is not teminating because I use it as a webserver to server a REST API with JSON.</p>

<p>Can I have a grunt callback or something whenever watch kicks in so I can close my previous phantomJs process before I re-run the task to create a new one?</p>

<p>I used grunt.event to make a handler, but I cannot see how to access the phantomjs process in order to kill it.</p>

<pre><code>grunt.registerTask('onWatchEvent',function(){

    //  whenever watch starts, do this...
    grunt.event.on('watch',function(event, file, task){
        grunt.log.writeln('\n' + event + ' ' + file + ' | running-&gt; ' + task); 
    });

Gerrit stores reviewed code in non-standard reference path - <code>refs/changes</code>.
So, reference to commit looks like <code>refs/changes/95/295/2</code> .
I want to add project from Gerrit to my superproject as a submodule.</p>

<p>I can do it in two steps: </p>

<ul>
<li>add my project as a submodule to commit-hash currently pointed by master </li>
<li>perform <code>git fetch origin refs/changes/95/295/2 &amp;&amp; git checkout FETCH_HEAD</code> and commit the change.</li>
</ul>

<p>But when I try to checkout my superproject and do <code>git update --init</code> git reports failure. Git can't find hash in submodule, because git didn't see references in <code>refs/changes</code> by default, and don't download objects from them.</p>

<p>Ok, I can fix it with executing <code>git config --add remote.origin.fetch '+refs/changes/*:refs/remotes/origin/changes/*'</code> in my gerrit repo, then retry submodule update, and that will be ok.</p>

<p>Question is, can I perform ""add"" and ""init/update"" submodule in one step as in usuial workflow? Basically, I need feature to set refspec before ""clone""/""pull""/""submodule add""/""sumbodule update"" execution start.</p>

<li>Intellisense is switched on in the editor settings;</li>
<li>I have reinstalled VWD2010 several times before without it making the blindest bit of difference;</li>
<li>I have reset settings both via the Options menu and via the command line, again without it making the slightest bit of difference.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Primitive type wrapper classes implement caching for a limited number
  of values.<br>
  This guarantees that a limited number of deeply equal wrapper objects are
  also shallowly equal:
  If <code>o1.equals( o2 )</code> then <code>o1 == o2</code>.<br>
  For example, <code>new Integer( 0 ) == new Integer( 0 )</code>.<br>
  In general this does not always work.<br>
  For example, new Integer( 666 ) == new Integer( 666 )<br>
  may not hold.<br>
  The reason for caching is that it saves memory.<br>
  In general caching works for “small” primitive values.</p>

<p>I don't understand what is meant by this, or what the difference is between a deep (.equals()) and shallow(==) equals. I know in practice, .equals must be used to objects and == for Integral values, but the actual reasoning for this alludes me.</p>

<p>I assume by the names that shallow maybe just checks that both the values are of the same type and name, which deep checks that both variables point to the same object? I don't see how the caching would come into play here though, or why it would be useful.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>go.origin.x = 300;
go.origin.y = 100;
</code></pre>

<p>But, this works fine and gives me the intended result:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog (@""print %i, %i"", go.origin.x, go.origin.y);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my XYPoint.h</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

@interface XYPoint : NSObject {

    int _x;
    int _y;

}
@property int x;
@property int y;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>XYPoint.m</p>

<pre><code>#import ""XYPoint.h""

@implementation XYPoint

@synthesize x = _x;
@synthesize y = _y;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>GraphicObject.h</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
#import ""XYPoint.h""

@interface GraphicObject : NSObject {

    XYPoint *_origin;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) XYPoint *origin;

-(void) setOrigin : (XYPoint *) pt;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>GraphicObject.m</p>

<pre><code>#import ""GraphicObject.h""

@implementation GraphicObject

@synthesize origin = _origin;

-(void) setOrigin : (XYPoint *) pt {

    _origin = [[XYPoint alloc] init];

    _origin = pt;

    //_origin.x = pt.x;
    //_origin.y = pt.y;

}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Also if don't want my origin.x and origin.y to be changed when I change my xypoint x and y, why do I have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>_origin.x = pt.x;
_origin.y = pt.y;
</code></pre>

<p>and why not just:</p>

<pre><code>_origin = pt;
</code></pre>

<p>For example in the <strong>main</strong> file:</p>

<pre><code>XYPoint *myPoint = [[XYPoint alloc] init];
go.origin = myPoint;

myPoint.x = 250;
myPoint.y = 50;

NSLog(@""Origin values %i, %i"", go.origin.x, go.origin.y);

myPoint.x = 100;
myPoint.y = 10;

NSLog(@""Origin values %i, %i"", go.origin.x, go.origin.y);
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that the values of origin don't change. But do I have to, in the setOrigin: method, assign it in this way:</p>

<pre><code>_origin.x = pt.x 
</code></pre>

<p>and not like this:</p>

<pre><code>_origin = pt;
</code></pre>

<img src=""http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/1180/capturadepantalla201204v.png"" alt=""image""></p>

<p>But once I am logged in, and the UIWebView detects the Facebook cookie, it won't load correctly. The loading icon is misplaced, and it won't stop, no errors appear, no web is being loaded (checked with UIWebView delegate methods), the Comment button won't be loaded and the frame won't change its height to see more comments...</p>

<p><img src=""http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/8117/capturadepantalla201204rk.png"" alt=""image""></p>

<p>If I load this URL externally from Safari, iOS Safari will load the webpage correctly!
If I force loading the normal version (not the mobile one) the comments are loaded correctly!
What am I missing?</p>

<pre><code>def get(self):
    results = CheckPulseRequest.get(get_args(self.request))

    logging.info(""In DateTimeEncoder Class"")

    def default(self, obj):
        logging.info(id(type(Decimal(10))))

        logging.info(type(obj))
        logging.info(isinstance(Decimal(10), (int, long, float, complex, Decimal)))
        logging.info(isinstance(obj, (int, long, float, complex, Decimal)))

I've relied on the APE package. After almost year of working on it, it's time for me to submit the package and I have very little time to rewrite it as S3/4 style unless it is required. </p>

<p>It's just very basic at the moment with 30+ functions and there's a driver class. There's a lot of jargon in package submission and so it's difficult to understand the Google results. I would appreciate any help.</p>

<p>My functions are very basic. For example, <em>getRoot</em> gets the root of the current tree (APE phylo object) and <em>getAncestor</em> gets the ancestor to the current node:</p>

<pre><code>getRoot &lt;- function(cur_Tree){
    return(length(cur_Tree$tip.label)+1)
}

getAncestor &lt;- function(cur_Node, cur_Tree){
    ...
return(ancestor)
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this okay or do I have to do anything else to submit the package? Later on (within the next few months) I would have time to convert these functions to S3/4 but at the moment the most important thing it to get it out there on CRAN.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the vignette need to be written in latex or can I get away with writing all of the requirements in word? (I believe I've seen a vignette written in word -> pdf)</p></li>
<li><p>Any other suggestions/links?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, I think the R development team has done a phenomenal job with R and maintaining the package libraries. My intention is not to cut corners...it's just that I have a program written in R that is complete and I'd like to submit it. Furthermore, although github is a great resource for hosting code, my primary objective is to submit the package to CRAN.</p>

<p>Trying to avoid this error, I kept all facebook classes untouched, but didn't work. My current <code>proguard-project.txt</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>-keep class com.facebook.** {
   *;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My current <code>projet.properties</code> file (excerpt):</p>

<pre><code>proguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, my <code>proguard</code> configuration is a ""specialization"" of <a href=""https://gist.github.com/4148345"">this file</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If I put <code>-dontobfuscate</code> in <code>proguard-project.txt</code> file, it will work.</strong> But what I don't understand is that the <code>keep class com.facebook.**</code> should already prevent classes related to facebook to be obfuscated. Which suggests that the problem is not directly related to the facebook classes.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/blob/sdk-version-3.0.2.b/facebook/src/com/facebook/model/GraphObject.java#L278"">excerpt of code</a> that throws <code>com.facebook.FacebookGraphObjectException</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>static &lt;U&gt; U coerceValueToExpectedType(Object value, Class&lt;U&gt; expectedType, 
        ParameterizedType expectedTypeAsParameterizedType) {

    // [...]

    } else if (Iterable.class.equals(expectedType) || Collection.class.equals(expectedType)
        || List.class.equals(expectedType) || GraphObjectList.class.equals(expectedType)) {
        if (expectedTypeAsParameterizedType == null) {
            throw new FacebookGraphObjectException(""can't infer generic type of: "" + expectedType.toString());
        }
    // [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, <code>expectedTypeAsParameterizedType</code> is <code>null</code> in release build. But in both builds (debug and release) <code>expectedType</code> is a <code>com.facebook.model.GraphObjectList</code> interface. Unfortunately, I don't understand almost nothing about Java reflection concepts.</p>

<p>I found a similar query <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6811482/use-url-on-android-throws-ioexception-malformed-ipv6-address"">here</a> but this relates to the Http as opposed to Https class and I don't have the overloaded method described.</p>

<p>I'm new to SOAP but my code so far is along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>    String SOAP_ACTION = ""http://url.to.thingy"";
String METHOD_NAME = ""methodNameFromAsmx"";
String NAMESPACE = ""http://the.namespace"";
String URL = ServerName;
    SoapObject request = new SoapObject(NAMESPACE, METHOD_NAME);
    request.addProperty(""Address"", UserName);
    SoapSerializationEnvelope envelope = new SoapSerializationEnvelope(SoapEnvelope.VER11);
    envelope.dotNet=true;
    envelope.setOutputSoapObject(request);
    HttpsTransportSE androidHttpTransport = new HttpsTransportSE(URL, 443, ""/relative/pathToAsmx"", 5000);
    androidHttpTransport.call(SOAP_ACTION, envelope);
</code></pre>

<p>I've replaced the various properties with fudge for now as I'm hoping it's not relevant. My error shows the malformed IPV6 as: https:%2F%2Fmy.url.com</p>

<pre><code>using (FileStream output = new FileStream(match_outputFile, FileMode.Create))
{
    BitmapImage bitmap = new BitmapImage(new Uri(match_sourceFile, UriKind.Relative));
    DrawingVisual visual = new DrawingVisual();

    using (DrawingContext image = visual.RenderOpen())
    {
        image.DrawImage(bitmap, new Rect(0, 0, bitmap.PixelWidth, bitmap.PixelHeight));

        buildText(image, ""text1"", this.text1.Text);
        buildText(image, ""text2"", this.text2.Text);
        buildText(image, ""text3"", this.text3.Text);
    }

    RenderTargetBitmap target = new RenderTargetBitmap(bitmap.PixelWidth, bitmap.PixelHeight, bitmap.DpiX, bitmap.DpiY, PixelFormats.Default);
    target.Render(visual);

    BitmapEncoder encoder = new PngBitmapEncoder();
    encoder.Frames.Add(BitmapFrame.Create(target));
    encoder.Save(output);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it calls the following function to draw the text:</p>

<pre><code>private void buildText(DrawingContext image, string settings, string input)
{
    string[] setting = (Properties.Settings.Default[settings].ToString()).Split(',');

    FormattedText text = new FormattedText(
        input,
        System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
        FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
        new Typeface(new FontFamily(setting[0]), FontStyles.Normal, FontWeights.Bold, FontStretches.Normal),
        Convert.ToDouble(setting[5]),
        (Brush) new BrushConverter().ConvertFromString(setting[4])
    );
    text.MaxTextWidth = Convert.ToDouble(setting[8]);
    text.MaxTextHeight = Convert.ToDouble(setting[9]);

    Point position = new Point(Convert.ToDouble(setting[7]), Convert.ToDouble(setting[6]));

    switch (setting[2])
    {
        case ""center"": position.X += (Convert.ToDouble(setting[8]) - text.Width) / 2; break;
        case ""right"": position.X += Convert.ToDouble(setting[8]) - text.Width; break;
    }

    switch (setting[3])
    {
        case ""middle"": position.Y += (Convert.ToDouble(setting[9]) - text.Height) / 2; break;
        case ""bottom"": position.Y += Convert.ToDouble(setting[9]) - text.Height; break;
    }

    image.DrawText(text, position);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now what I need is simple... I need to draw text2 (and ONLY text2) at an ANGLE from the center position. The center position is simple, it would be:</p>

<pre><code>centerX = (setting[8] - setting[7]) / 2;
centerY = (setting[9] - setting[6]) / 2;
</code></pre>

<p>So what if I wanted to draw this text, at a -30 degree angle rotated at the center position? Remember I want ONLY text 2 rotated, not the other text, and not the original image source either.</p>

<p>I checked online for more help, and many things said to check:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""File"" -> ""Project Structure"" -> ""Platform Settings"" -> ""SDK""</p>

<p>And then add your JDK (JDK 1.7). That didn't work, so I tried JDK 1.6, which also gave me the same error. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<p>My question is, how should this work? I'm confused about using grunt or why some tutorials show Stylus being used as middleware. Is it that the middleware compiles it realtime, and why would I need that?</p>

<p>Also I ran <code>npm install bootstrap-styl</code> and <code>npm install jeet</code>, but I'm not sure how to reference these in my styles.styl (If I do <code>@import bootstrap</code>, it can't find the files)</p>

<p>My thought is that I want to somehow link the imports to my node_modules, so they can be updated fluidly (I don't want to just copy the bootstrap .styl files from the node_modules folder, right?). Is this what I would use Grunt for?</p>

        [theDictionary setObject:theMutableArray forKey:object.DogLocation];
      }

      [theMutableArray addObject:object];

    }

   /* Save `theDictionary` in an instance variable */
   self.theSource = theDictionary;
   [self.tableView reloadData];

}

<p>I call this method in my <code>ViewDidLoad</code>  by using following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>[self loadSortedData:@""Cattle"" fieldToSort:@""DogLocation""];
</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to achieve is to be able to call this method by passing a value in the method e.g  so that I can sort it by other fields and not just the DogLocation e.g DogAge,DogPrice . </p>

<p>Could anyone kindly direct me or show me a better way to achieve this instead of writing big if else statement? </p>

I want to remove lines 464-465 of IdMessage.pas then recompile the application.  I'm having a hard time finding clear documentation, so I tried these steps to modify the component:</p>

<ul>
<li>opened \delphi6\source\indy\indy.dpk in the IDE</li>
<li>double-clicked IdMessage.pas in the Package window</li>
<li>edited IdMessage.pas and save the file</li>
<li>clicked Compile in the Package window</li>
<li>clicked Build Indy in the Project menu</li>
<li>clicked Install in the Package window</li>
</ul>

<p>But then I get the error that \bpl\indy60.bpl can't be loaded because \bin\indy60.bpl is already loaded.  So I tried ""Install packages..."" in the Components menu, but only found \bpl\dclindy60.bpl there.  So I removed that package, and:</p>

<ul>
<li>opened \delphi6\source\indy\dclindy.dpk in the IDE</li>
<li>clicked Compile in the Package window</li>
<li>clicked Build dclIndy in the Project menu</li>
<li>clicked Install in the Package window</li>
</ul>

<p>The IDE confirmed all the components (including IdMessage) were installed, but the email program is still acting as though the original unmodified component is still being used.</p>

<p>What about mapping another variable to the alpha value using {graphics}?

The problem is that I have a fairly complex set of partial views nested within the view and this particular helper needs to keep track of the data that has been added via other partial views.  In other words, it is keeping a running tally of all the Footnotes for the entire view (that contains partial views).  The problem is that @Html seems to be instantiated at every partial view load. Meaning that my helper can not have a footnotes 1,2,3 from partial view 1 and continue on with the footnote 4, 5, 6 on partial view 2, instead the HtmlHelper is new on every partial view hence the data can not be appended.</p>

<pre><code>void SomeMethod&lt;T&gt;(List&lt;T&gt; someList)
{
    if (typeof(T) == typeof(c1))
    {
         // etc
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was trying to incorporate it somehow in the following. I'm trying to combine two very similar user controls using generics</p>

<pre><code>public partial class UcCustomers : System.Web.UI.UserControl
{
    List&lt;Customer&gt; _list;

    public void SetDataSource(List&lt;Customer&gt; customers){
        _list = customers
    }

}


public partial class UcProducts : System.Web.UI.UserControl
{
    List&lt;Products&gt; _list;

    public void SetDataSource(List&lt;Product&gt; products){
        _list = products
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is, I'd like to set that member _list variable but it won't let me unless I do something like:</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable _list;
</code></pre>

<p>But then I can't use lambda's with that type of variable. My goal is to have a GridView User Control that has some very basic CRUD functionality.</p>

<p>I'm thinking the SetDataSource could accept a generic List and work with it as a member variable.</p>

I have two questions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it not possible to use web_reg_find() in URL mode recorded scripts?
When placing a verification (web_reg_find) before a step in the script where I know that i.e. a text is to appear. The Generation log only inform me that web_reg_find was succesfull (not the way I am used to with HTML mode and when the Generation log typically exposes the value itself also).</p></li>
<li><p>When running the below script as a sceanrio in the Controller With 2 users, after 10 minutes of running the transaction time peaks, the CPU usage in JVM peaks (99,9%) and Memory is also ""maxed-out"". It is typical to think that this has to do with heap and GC settings ++. 
But is it possible that the script itself is making this happen. More details that can lead to the script being the reason for the peak in responstime/memeory/cpu usage is that the application I am testing is not integrated with any services at all, all being mocked around it. I also just use one user to log in for all mye requests, due to this being mocked and I am getting the same response everytime. But it does throw error on any transactions. There is also no logout/cleanup logic implemented wich could lead to accumulated sessions on the webserver so that may be the case.
My next step is to use JVisualVM to dig into the high CPU usage after some time when the peaking happens. 
So my general question is: Could this phenomen, as in after 10 mins responsetime peakes, and memory/CPU consumption peaks on the WAS (actually a JBoss), be due to something with the script itself? Anyone having experienced that their script is the source of this?</p></li>

<p>I saw several post, all of them say you have to activate it with :</p>

<p>minifyEnabled true
but mine is already activated...</p>

<p>I also realized thanks to @Robert Rowntree that build/outputs/mapping/release was empty after running ./gradlew clean assembleRelease</p>

<p>Still, I can't get Proguard work??? No way I publish my app without proguard!!!</p>

<p>Any Idea???</p>

<p>I have confusion in drop query that how actually it work in internally. I heard one of my post that someone says that when we use drop query then internally it'll be used delete query.</p>

<p>So my question is, Is it true that when we use the drop query then internally the delete query also use?</p>

<p>Here's what I wanted it to look like:
First row: Welcoming text (that works)
Second row: Search input field (that works, too)
Thirt row (and here it gets complicated): There should be a text named ""Search for"" and then a Spinner with the item you can search for (e.g. name, year, price). Then there's the Search button. Next thing is that you can sort the output. Therefore there's a text with ""Sort for"", a Spinner with the critirion and a Sort button. Best case the search section should be align to the left and the sort for to the right, but still centered.
Forth row: Output field.
Now as the elements are all present on my device, they are not in the graphical layout of Eclipse. I've tried for hours now to get it working but it's kind of hard if you're not sseing your objects.</p>

<p>I've added a photo of the current design. The space with the red frame around it is the third ""row"" and should be changed. The second spinner is (I don't know why) much too wide. It should be that wide as the first one. Then all the elements should be about the same heigth and the elements should be centered.</p>

I noticed a wrong behavior of Joomla URLs (not 100% sure its Joom!Fish fault though).
1. access site <a href=""http://principiuldivin.md"" rel=""nofollow"">http://principiuldivin.md</a>
2. switch to Russian using flag
3. paste this link that leads to an existing item, in other language, directly into the address bar: <a href=""http://principiuldivin.md/materiale/multimedia/audio/muzica"" rel=""nofollow"">http://principiuldivin.md/materiale/multimedia/audio/muzica</a> - you'll get a 404 error.</p>

<p>But, if you manually first switch to second language using the flag - pasting and accessing that link goes fine.</p>

<p>That means language isn't switched automatically, also i noticed there is no language SEF Prefix displayed in page URL, and i think this could be the reason of my issue.</p>

<p>I double-checked all Joomfish plugins setting, and it's ON in there.</p>

<p>Have searched all over internet, but could not find a similar case.</p>

<p>The first is view expose notifications events which a presenter should be subscribed to. When user clicks on some button on the view, view just triggers some event, notifies that something is changed.</p>

<p>The second is just use an observer pattern and let the presenter interfere some contract. Let it be an interface with methods like events I told you above. An presenter-observer should be attached to the view.</p>

<p>As Jeremy Miller in his legendary <a href=""http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2007/07/26/the-build-your-own-cab-series-table-of-contents/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Build your own CAB series"" blog posts</a> said, it's better for him to use the second option. </p>

<p>What's your opinion on this topic? 
How do you tie presenter and view in your projects?
What's advantages or disadvantages for every options?</p>

<p>Let make some poll here. I think it would be useful.

<p><strong>In order to respond to Peter Ritchie's answer.</strong></p>

<p>My issue is that my inexperience and I should rely on somebody's opinion to make a decision and choose a way that seems right to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The drawback with interfaces is that you have specific coupling. The view is coupled to an interface and something has to implement that interface</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But on the other hand, is not events serves like a some contract (like an interface do)? It tied presenter to the view as it should react over that events.</p>

I was successfully able to wire a Gateway into my Spring REST controller.  However, I'm confused as to where to go next.  Here's what I'm trying to accomplish:</p>

<p>1) When a certain route is hit with a POST request, open a connection to a certain IP (or work with a connection that's already open with this IP) passed from the POST and send a message.</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMethod(value = '/sendTcpMessage', method=RequestMethod.POST)
public void sendTcpMessage(@RequestParam(value=""ipAddress"", required=true) String ipAddress,
                           @RequestParam(value=""message"", required=true) String message) {

//send the message contained in the 'message' variable to the IP address located 
//at 'ipAddress' - how do I do this?

}
</code></pre>

<p>2) I also need my Spring backend to listen to TCP ""messages"" passed to it, and store them in a buffer.  My Javascript will call a route every 5 seconds or so and read the information out of the buffer.</p>

<p><b>Here is my controller code:</b></p>

<pre><code>@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @Resource(name = ""userDaoImpl"")
    private UserDAO userDao;
    @Resource(name = ""receiveTcp"")
    private ReceiveTcp tcpMessageReceiver;
    @Autowired
    SimpleGateway gw;

    String tcpBuffer[] = new String[100];

    @RequestMapping(value=""/"")
    public String home() {
        return ""homepage"";
    }

        return tcpMessageReceiver.transferBuffer();

<p>I've tried various ways of achieving this, but I always end up with the adorners themselves being scaled, so they end up huge, or with massive borders. I've since started using positions  relative to the window to position them and ignored the RenderTransform applied to the AdornedElement, however I get some very unusual behavior.</p>

<p>Firstly, <strong><em>when I scale the element more than (roughly) by 2x, the rescale behaviour breaks down and starts jumping all over the place.</em></strong></p>

<p>Obviously this behaviour is easier to see than describe, hence why I have attached a sample solution (VS 2010) that demonstrates the issue and the code that causes it.</p>

&lt;div id=""map_canvas""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id=""open-map""&gt;Open The Map&lt;/a&gt;

.. rest of content

&lt;/body&gt;

<p>And then my CSS</p>

<pre><code>#map_canvas {
height:350px;
width:100%;
}

#map-container {
height:0px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>..and then the JS</p>

<pre><code>$('.open-map').click(function() {
  $('#map-container').css(""height"",350);
});
</code></pre>

<p>..this is a stripped down version obviously. I want to animate the dropdown too.. but I keep getting an incomplete map that looks like this <a href=""http://d.pr/rNnr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.pr/rNnr</a>.  Incomplete with lots of grey.  I have tried different approaches to opening and closing (including setting {height:350px; display:none} on the container but this problem is always there.  If I don't hide the map container there is no problem with the map.</p>

I want to cut of the first n characters from the beginning and add them to the end of that string.</p>

<p>I need to run that method for approx. 2000 DNA sequences - that's why i am worried about speed. I don't want to block my computer for all week.</p>

<p>What is the most efficient way to do that in ruby? </p>

<p>A side-question would be the memory-efficiency. Since i only need to run this task once per sequence, it is not that much important for me, but usually fast does not mean less memory, right? My computer has 2 gigs RAM available(hopefully it is enough).</p>

<p>If you are interested why i need to do this:</p>

<p>The reason why i'd like to do this is, that my source material is analysed for a specific point in the DNA. This point needs to be somewhere in the middle of the DNA for more convenience in later analysis. If this point is to close to the end or to the beginning, i need to split and concat the DNA sequence string.The sequences are circular and the point is the top BLAST hit for dnaA in the bacterial genome (from NCBI database). Since most annotations tend to use the location of the dnaA gene as start, this is pretty annoying if you want to work with the area around that gene.</p>

 For example the above solution of <code>final E[] a = (E[]) Array.newInstance(c, s);</code> won't work because I can not obtain <code>List&lt;MyClass&gt;.class</code> And also you can't cast from <code>Object[]</code> to <code>List&lt;MyClass&gt;[]</code></p>

<p>What is the idiomatic way to deal with an array like construct of generic type? For example, I want an array of <code>List&lt;MyClass&gt;</code>. <code>ArrayList&lt;List&lt;MyClass&gt;&gt; myClassArray</code> won't work directly because I need to be able to do things like <code>myClassArray.set(5, myClassObj)</code> even when the <code>myClassArray.size()</code> is 0.

<p>works but it's ugly.</p>

<p>He mention about the method above is using Error(Segment) instead of using free(host_name) and free(user_name)? So this is the possible reason of causing memory leakage?</p>

If the smaller list of ""active"" values becomes too large, it triggers a loop that iterates through the small list and removes values that have become inactive. Currently, it removes them by simply ignoring the inactive values and adding them to a second list (and when the second list gets full again the same process is repeated, placing them back into the first list and so on).</p>

<p>After this trigger occurs, the list is then sorted using a Quicksort implementation. This is all fine and dandy.</p>

<p>-------Question---------</p>

<p>However, I see a potential gain of speed. I am imagining combining the removal of inactive values <strong><em>while</em></strong> the sorting is taking place. Unfortunately, I cannot find a way to implement quicksort in this way. Simply because the quicksort works with pivots, which means if values are removed from the list, the pivot will eventually try to access a slot in the list that does not exist, etc etc.. (unless I'm just thinking about it wrong).</p>

<p>So, any ideas on how to combine the two operations? I can't seem to find any sorting algorithms as fast as quicksort that could handle this, or perhaps I'm just not seeing how to implement it into a quicksort... any hints are appreciated!</p>

<p>Code for better understanding of whats currently going on:
(Current Conditions: values can range from 0 to 2 million, no 2 values are the same, and in general they are mostly sorted, since they are sorted every so often)</p>

<p>For example, this is a summing function which uses a custom exception:</p>

<pre><code># module mylibrary 
class WrongSummand(Exception):
    pass

def sum_(a, b):
    """""" returns the sum of two summands of the same type """"""
    if type(a) != type(b):
        raise WrongSummand(""given arguments are not of the same type"")
    return a + b


# module application using mylibrary
from mylibrary import sum_, WrongSummand

try:
    print sum_(""A"", 5)
except WrongSummand:
    print ""wrong arguments""

<p>And this is the same function, which avoids using exceptions</p>

<pre><code># module mylibrary
def sum_(a, b):
    """""" returns the sum of two summands if they are both of the same type """"""
    if type(a) == type(b):

else:

Interestingly, the same error is thrown no matter if the request method is GET or POST. Within another app, using exactly the same setup, the forwarding works. So I assume, its not a Jersey problem per se, but depending on my setup. Still can't figure out what it might be.</p>

<p>1-plot both lines and points</p>

<p>2-have the data not scattered around, but ordered instead as it should be (the order is maintained with the plot function) in both plots.</p>

<p>3-have the two plots aligned with a minimal distance between them and no x axis in the one above.</p>

<p>4-have the plots aligned but still maintain the legend of the one above.</p>

When the user clicks a treenode, the server-side code gets the node value (file path), creates a FileInfo object, and (after setting all the header Content-type, Cache-Control, etc. correctly) calls Response.TransmitFile(xxxxpath) to send to the user's browser.</p>

<p>This works fine on the major browsers, on major devices (PCs, Macs, iOS devices). The file downloads correctly and opens on the user's machine. But on certain devices and certain browsers, the PDF file does not open. On Android devices, it appears that Firefox downloads and opens the PDFs correctly, but the stock Android browser does not. On a Kindle Fire, it appears the Silk browser downloads the file successfully, but when trying to open it, I see an error: ""PDF trailer not found""....or it says the PDF is DRM-protected (which it is not). I haven't tried another browser (if there is one) on the Fire.</p>

<p>I've experimented using anchor  links in static HTML markup, and the problem browsers appear to download and display the PDFs correctly when accessed this way. There seems to be an issue (inconsistency?) with the way ASP.NET sends the response to the browser when done via code. I've used Response.Flush, Response.WriteFile, Response.BinaryWrite, Response.Close, Response.End, etc., and they all produce the same result: MOST browsers handle the file, but SOME cannot handle the PDF. </p>

<p>So, is there some issue with the way ASP.NET constructs the Response object (especially when sending back PDFs) that some browsers don't like? TIA.</p>

<p><strong>TicketViewModel:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class TicketViewModel

}
</code></pre>

<p><br/></p>

<p>In the Create a new Ticket page, there is also attachment field and multiple attachments can be added to this newly created ticket. For this reason I use TicketViewModel and pass <code>Ticket</code> and <code>ICollection&lt;Attachment&gt;</code> to the controller. On the other hand, I am not sure if I am wrong, because I can pass just 'Ticket' to the controller and create a new instance of <code>TicketViewModel</code> in the controller by passing <em>Ticket</em> model to the constructor of <em>TicketViewModel</em>. In this scenario, what approach should I follow? 
<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> I pass <code>IEnumerable&lt;HttpPostedFileBase&gt;</code> to the controller for Attachment data.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I updated View and pass Model instead of ViewModel as shown below:</p>

<p><strong>View:</strong></p>

<pre><code>@model Ticket
//... some other stuff
</code></pre>

<p>And in the controller, I pass the filled Model and new instance of the Attachment Collection to the method in the data layer as shown below.</p>

The idea is to have my service expose endpoints for managing a customer (i.e. CreateCustomer, EditCustomer, DeleteCustomer, etc). Then I want it to publish a message to a topic after it completes each operation (i.e. OnCustomerCreated, OnCustomerChanged, OnCustomerDeleted, etc.)</p>

<p>For Example, A client application will hit the EditCustomer message on my service. I will immediately publish an OnCustomerChanged message with the customer object provided. My service (the same one the customer hit) will have another contract that takes an OnCustomerChanged and updates my database. </p>

<p>My question is, do I have to make a separate Subscription on my topic for each message type (i.e. OnCustomerChangedSubscription, OnCustomerDeletedSubscription, etc.) so that I can properly route messages of different types to the correct endpoint?</p>

<p>If that is case, I would need a bunch of single-method contracts so that I could configure the wcf endpoints properly: </p>

<p>i.e:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;service name=""site.Services.Business.Managers.CustomerManager""&gt;
   &lt;!-- endpoint that clients will hit --&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address="""" binding=""basicHttpBinding"" contract=""site.Services.Business.Contracts.ICustomerManager"" /&gt;
   &lt;!-- endpoint that publishes messages--&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address=""sb://test-site.servicebus.windows.net/Managers/CustomerManager"" 
              binding=""netTcpRelayBinding"" 
              contract=""site.Services.Business.Contracts.ICustomerManager"" 
              behaviorConfiguration=""sbTokenProvider"" /&gt;
    &lt;!-- One Endpoint for each message type (this will get very cumbersome and the contract will only have 1 method on it) --&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address=""sb://test-site.servicebus.windows.net/Managers/CustomerManager""
                  binding=""netMessagingBinding""
                  listenUri=""sb://test-site.servicebus.windows.net/Managers/CustomerManager/subscriptions/OnCustomerDeleted""
                  behaviorConfiguration =""sbTokenProvider""
                  contract=""site.Services.Business.Contracts.CustomerManager.IOnCustomerDeleted"" /&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address=""sb://test-site.servicebus.windows.net/Managers/CustomerManager""
                  binding=""netMessagingBinding""
                  listenUri=""sb://test-site.servicebus.windows.net/Managers/CustomerManager/subscriptions/OnCustomerCreated""
                  behaviorConfiguration =""sbTokenProvider""
                  contract=""site.Services.Business.Contracts.CustomerManager.IOnCustomerCreated"" /&gt;
…etc

  &lt;/service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative would be to create a single Subscriber (Allmessages), only having one contract with a <code>HandleMessage(BrokeredMessage message)</code> operation, and then determine inside that method with method to call on my service. That doesn't seem like I am doing the right thing there though either. I am essentially taking in all messages and determining the handler inside the service. </p>

<p>What I am looking for is a way to have a a service that implements 3 contracts, ICustomerPublisher (already have this), ICustomerManager (exposed over http to clients), and ICustomerSubscriber.</p>

<p>ICustomerSubscriber would look like:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
public interface ICustomerSubscriber
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void OnCustomerCreated(ICustomerMessage message);

    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void OnCustomerDeleted(ICustomerMessage message);

    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void OnCustomerChanged(ICustomerMessage message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I would be able to call:</p>

<pre><code>publisher.Publish&lt;OnCustomerChanged&gt;(new CustomerChangedMessage(customer));
</code></pre>

<p>and have my OnCustomerChanged method receive that message.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Everything is working great so far but I have just one more detail to fix before I can say it is done.</p>

<p><strong>The scenario is pretty simple:</strong></p>

<p>Three cards must exit the screen with an animation before segue modally brings up the new screen.</p>

<p>Up until now he animation gets executed and the new view is loaded, but the detail I haven't been able to work out is the ""wait until the animation finishes before bringing the new view"".</p>

<p><strong>This is how I'm doing it:</strong></p>

<p>1) Set exit animation with this method</p>

<pre><code>- (void)performExitAnimationWithCompletionBlock:(void (^)(BOOL))block
{    
    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.1f
                          delay:0.0f
                        options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseOut
                     animations:^
     {
         self.optionOneFront.center = self.optionOneBack.center = self.optionTwoFront.center;
         self.optionOneFront.transform = self.optionOneBack.transform = self.optionTwoFront.transform;

         self.optionThreeFront.center = self.optionThreeBack.center = self.optionTwoFront.center;
         self.optionThreeFront.transform = self.optionThreeBack.transform = self.optionTwoFront.transform;
     }
                     completion:^(BOOL finished)
     {
         CGPoint point = CGPointMake(self.optionTwoFront.center.x, self.view.frame.size.height * -2.0f);

         [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0f
                               delay:0.0f
                             options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseOut
                          animations:^
          {
              self.optionOneFront.center   = point;
              self.optionOneBack.center    = point;
              self.optionTwoFront.center   = point;
              self.optionTwoBack.center    = point;
              self.optionThreeFront.center = point;
              self.optionThreeBack.center  = point;
          }
                          completion:block];
     }];
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) Try to wrap the segue code within the animation before presenting the ""AddOptions"" VC</p>

<pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
{
    [self performExitAnimationWithCompletionBlock:^(BOOL finished)
     {
         // Executes the following ""if"" statement if the user wants to add new options
         if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@""AddOptions""])
         {
             UINavigationController *navigationController = segue.destinationViewController;
             OptionsViewController *controller = (OptionsViewController *)navigationController.topViewController;
             controller.delegate = self;
         }         
     }];    
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I said before, everything works but the modal windows comes up before the animation finishes.</p>

<p>Any idea of what I'm missing?</p>

<p>This is my code for serializing:</p>

<pre><code>ObixBaseObj lobbyObj = new ObixBaseObj();
lobbyObj.setIs(""obix:Lobby"");

ObixOp batchOp = new ObixOp();
batchOp.setName(""batch"");
batchOp.setIn(""obix:BatchIn"");
batchOp.setOut(""obix:BatchOut"");

lobbyObj.addChild(batchOp);

Gson gson = new Gson();
System.out.println(gson.toJson(lobbyObj));
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the result:</p>

<pre><code> {""obix"":""obj"",""is"":""obix:Lobby"",""children"":[{""obix"":""op"",""name"":""batch""}]}
</code></pre>

<p>The serialization mostly works, except its missing the contents of inherited members (In particular <code>obix:BatchIn</code> and <code>obixBatchout</code> strings are missing).
Here's my base class:</p>

<pre><code>public class ObixBaseObj  {
    protected String obix;
    private String display;
    private String displayName;
    private ArrayList&lt;ObixBaseObj&gt; children;

    public ObixBaseObj()
    {
        obix = ""obj"";
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
        ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what my inherited class (ObixOp) looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public class ObixOp extends ObixBaseObj {
    private String in;
    private String out;

    public ObixOp() {
        obix = ""op"";
    }
    public ObixOp(String in, String out) {
        obix = ""op"";
        this.in = in;
        this.out = out;
    }
    public String getIn() {
        return in;
    }
    public void setIn(String in) {
        this.in = in;
    }
    public String getOut() {
        return out;
    }
    public void setOut(String out) {
        this.out = out;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I realize I could use an adapter for this, but the problem is that I'm serializing a collection of base class type <code>ObixBaseObj</code>. There are about 25 classes that inherits from this. How can I make this work elegantly?</p>

<p><strong>Update5</strong></p>

<p>I was able to fix the exception by using array list of SelectItem types rather then String so in my bean, I have:</p>

<pre><code>createProperties(){
    ArrayList&lt;SelectItem&gt; properties = new ArrayList&lt;SelectItem&gt;();
    properties.add(new SelectItem(""roi"", ""roi""));
    properties.add(new SelectItem(""val"".""val""));
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in my <code>xhtml</code> page, i have to use <code>selectItems</code> instead of <code>selectItem</code> as on my xhtml page am expecting collection and so need to use <code>selectItems</code> to iterate through them:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;ice:panelGrid columns=""2""&gt;
        &lt;ice:panelGrid&gt;
            &lt;ice:outputText value=""Properties:"" style=""text-align:left;font-size:20px;""&gt;&lt;/ice:outputText&gt;
            &lt;ice:selectManyListbox id=""CriteriaListbox"" style=""width: 200px; height: 250px; "" partialSubmit=""true""&gt;

<p>I'm guessing part of the problem may be that some of the variables are URLs, since the folder name, also a variable, is being accepted. I did try adding escape characters ('\') to all the special characters in the URL and all that did was get me a 'bad substitution' error instead.</p>

<p>What then, should I change in my syntax?</p>

<p>After that, I wanted to execute code from a text file, so I did this :</p>

<p>I copied the string that I used before in a external file called test.txt. </p>

<p>So my test.txt contains the following line : <code>@""System.Console.Write(""""Hello World"""");""</code></p>

<p>When compliling the code <strong>I get an error</strong> that something is missing.</p>

<p>So I figured out that, it was just the backslash.</p>

<p>And changed the code to this :</p>

<pre><code>string line;

System.IO.StreamReader file = new System.IO.StreamReader(""test.txt"");
while ((line = file.ReadLine()) != null)
{
    string toto = line;
    string titi = toto.Replace(@""\\"", @"""");

    engine.Execute(toto);
}

<p>Now when I run this code, <strong>nothing happens</strong> (no error).</p>

<p>And when I inspect the variables content, I get this :</p>

<p><code>toto : ""@\""System.Console.Write(\""\""Hello World\""\"");\""""</code></p>

<p><code>titi : ""@\""System.Console.Write(\""\""Hello World\""\"");\""""</code></p>

<p>Is that normal ! Normally the baskslash should be removed, but it not the case.</p>

<p>¡Hi! I'm programming a navigator app, and I need to update the user position whenever is possible. I have two View Controllers that use CLLocation manager. In both of them I've added this line:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;CoreLocation/CoreLocation.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then added the  to the interface declaration, and I'm setting this as a property in the .h file, and synthetizing afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) CLLocationManager *locationManager;
</code></pre>

<p>After that, I'm launching de locationManager in the viewDidLoad, this way:</p>

<pre><code>if(self){
    locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];
    //locationManager.delegate = self;
    [locationManager setDelegate:self];
    [locationManager setDistanceFilter:kCLHeadingFilterNone];
    [locationManager setDesiredAccuracy:kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation];
    [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here are my delegate methods. </p>

<p>For the first View:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma mark - CLLocationManagerDelegate

- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didFailWithError:(NSError *)error
{
    NSLog(@""didFailWithError: %@"", error);
    UIAlertView *errorAlert = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                           initWithTitle:@""Error"" message:@""Failed to Get Your Location"" delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@""OK"" otherButtonTitles:nil];
    [errorAlert show];
}

- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation
{
    NSLog(@""didUpdateToLocation: %@"", newLocation);
    CLLocation *currentLocation = newLocation;

    if (currentLocation != nil) {
        homeLatitude = [[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%.8f"",  currentLocation.coordinate.latitude] doubleValue];
        homeLongitude = [[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%.8f"", currentLocation.coordinate.longitude] doubleValue];
        NSLog(@""Updated! -&gt; hl = %f, hlg = %f"", homeLatitude, homeLongitude);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the second view. As you can see, I replaced the old didUpdateToLocation with didUpdateLocations, as a desperate try.</p>

<pre><code>#pragma mark - CLLocationManagerDelegate

- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didFailWithError:(NSError *)error

    NSLog(@""didFailWithError: %@"", error);

        }
    }
}
//[locationManager stopUpdatingLocation];
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the line</p>

<pre><code>//[locationManager stopUpdatingLocation];
</code></pre>

<p>is commented. Well, the problem is driving me crazy is that the code above works as a charm in the first view controller, and update periodically as I expected. But in the second view, it works only the first time, and never updates again. I programmed these methods in different times, so I can't remember if I did something to the first view I didn't to the second. But they are in the same app, so I assume there's no problem with libraries or permissions. Any help or hint is welcome, thanks!</p>

<p>Now, if I want a different cursor on areas of the form not covered by controls, I can check the form mouse move event and change the cursor therein.

<pre><code>((LocationManager) ctx.getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE))
        .requestLocationUpdates((provider == WPS)? 
        LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER : LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER,
        minTime, minDist, onChange(ctx, provider)); // onChange create a pending intent
</code></pre>

<p>and on certain events we call</p>

<pre><code>Location gpsLocation = LocMngr.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER);
Location wpsLocation = LocMngr.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER);
</code></pre>

<p>On a HTC One S running on Android 4.0.3 and HTC Sense 4.0 we <strong>never</strong> receive location updates and the last known location returns <strong>null for gps and a 2 day old location for wps</strong>. WIFI, GPS and Mobile Data is turned on, i've tried walking around outside and saw the device trying to get a gps fix, but apparently it did not get one. Other devices have no problem with receiveing location updates from gps or wps using the same code...</p>

<p>This only occurs on this device (it's a test device so bootloader is locked, not rooted or any other funky stuff that might break brick it)</p>

<p>I am at a loss, any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
Since we rebooted the device the problem did not occur again, I am still wondering what caused the problem...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>I ran into the same Problem yesterday with a Galaxy Nexus official Android 4.2.2. So this seems to be a problem of Android in general.</p>

<p>Now that apparently nobody knows how to solve this, is there any way to detect when the Location API is not sending any fixes anymore? Apart from checking the timestamp of the lastKnownLocation()?</p>

Every following request in the first session has the same Authenticator on the request (when I test business flows for one user).</p>

<p>The HttpServletRequest is injected in the class level</p>

<pre><code>@Context
private HttpServletRequest request;

<p>(I tried to move the injection to method level and it didn't help). My rest class is annotated as @Stateless bean (to allow injections).</p>

<p>I tried switching the sessions (I use Chrome and FireFox to ensure different sessions) but it didn't change anything.</p>

<p>What i'd like to achieve is that, when a visitor clicks ""click here to contact me about Y"", the page will send the visitor to the contact form, but have the Y subject automatically selected.</p>

<p>It's a classic thing to want to do: you have more than one term in your search string... in Lucene terms this returns a BooleanQuery.  Then you use something like this code to highlight (NB I am a Lucene newbie, this is all closely tweaked from Net examples):</p>

<pre><code>yellow_highlight = SimpleHTMLFormatter( '&lt;b style=""background-color:yellow""&gt;', '&lt;/b&gt;' )
green_highlight = SimpleHTMLFormatter( '&lt;b style=""background-color:green""&gt;', '&lt;/b&gt;' )

...

stream = FrenchAnalyzer( Version.LUCENE_46 ).tokenStream( ""both"", StringReader( both ) )
scorer = QueryScorer( fr_query, ""both"" )
fragmenter = SimpleSpanFragmenter(scorer)
highlighter = Highlighter( yellow_highlight, scorer )
highlighter.setTextFragmenter(fragmenter)
best_fragments = highlighter.getBestTextFragments( stream, both, True, 5 )
if best_fragments:
    for best_frag in best_fragments:
        print ""=== best frag: %s, type %s"" % ( best_frag, type( best_frag ))
        html_text += ""&amp;bull %s&lt;br&gt;\n"" % unicode( best_frag )
</code></pre>

<p>... and then the html_text is put in a JTextPane for example.</p>

<p>But how would you make the first word in your query highlight with a yellow background and the second word highlight with a green background?  I have tried to understand the various classes in org.apache.lucene.search... to no avail.  So my only way of learning was googling.  I couldn't find any clues...</p>

<p><em><strong>edit</em></strong></p>

<p>Wow, quite surprised at the minimal interest and even more minimal response.  I'm not sure GradientFormatter is really the way to go. Two possible avenues occur to me:
1) do two (or n) formats of the same fragments, using different highlighters... then try to knit together the resulting HTML.  Hardly elegant!
2) examine the source code of the relevant Lucene classes and attempt to write my own multi-highlighter formatter.  Gulp. Be right back in about a year.</p>

<p><em><strong>later</em></strong></p>

<p>cracked it by merging of multiple HTMLDocuments in the end.  HTMLDocument is quite a tricky class to get your head around, so thought I'd offer up the fruits of my labour for anyone interested.  It does produce some v nice results (though I say so myself).  Written in Jython but most Java people should be able to figure it out.</p>

<p>Takes advantage of the fact that the <em>text</em> of each fragment will be the same for each highlighted HTML fragment.  If one of the terms (or related stemmed term of course) is absent from the text then no fragments will be returned by the highlighter (fairly obvious when you think about it).  </p>

<p>CAVEAT: it seems to work but this simple version takes no account of the possibility of overlapping highlighting... and given that each highlighter highlights completely independently of the other(s) this is a real possibility.  Solving that will be tricky but not impossible, hopefully.</p>

<p>the above is OK... but in the end what I then did was to make a subclass of DefaultStyledDocument, ExtdStyledDocument, which has functions like deep_copy(), merge_with() (i.e. merge the attributes after verifying that the text in the document for merging is the same) and split()...</p>

<p>Then I made a subclass of HTMLDocument which generates a parallel ExtdStyledDocument as the HTMLDocument is created (override of createLeafElement).  This way I could use the ExtdStyledDocument in my JTextPane object, without using the ""inferior"" ""text/html"" content.  Indeed: although HTMLDocument is a subclass of DefaultStyledDocument it doesn't really seem to be for use with JTextPane... </p>

<p>One point: there is no guarantee that the ""best fragments"" for different terms for a given ""top doc"" will cover the same text.  Unfortunately org.apache.lucene.search.highlight.TextFragment does not reveal its position in its document, which is a bit bad.  For this reason I used the NullFragmenter, which returns the entire document as in this particular app quite they're small.  For true ""best fragments"" it would be necessary to delve into the Lucene fragmentation mechanisms...</p>

<p>My first problem is that I'm completely new to Maven. Second - I can't change the directory layout. And third - I'm running out of time.</p>

<p>Some of topics I've read covered few of my questions, but I need it clearer.</p>

<p>I have 3 modules connected with each other: 
* Main one with catalogues: .settings, db-schema, EarContent, 
* EJB with .settings, bin, build, ejbModule
* WEB with .settings, build, src, WebContent.</p>

<p>As far as I know (correct me if I'm wrong) there is just one 'mapping' when I have single catalogue with source code and it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;sourceDirectory&gt;ejbModule&lt;/sourceDirectory&gt;
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>But what if I have two catalogues? I mean the WEB module - src and WebContent.
What else do I need to change if don't use standard directory layout?
What with the main module with EarContent? - There is no source code, but there is an -ds.xml file which (I guess) I have to put somewhere.
In main POM.xml I know that I have to add  tags, but is there anything else I should do?</p>

<p>Sorry for (maybe) not precise and wide questions, but I've started today and I have to do it fast. So far I've found Sonatype site and managed to get one of their pdfs, but I'm reading it quite too slow and need 'some' help doing it. I've also downloaded the archetype for nexus repository and I'm trying to understand it.</p>

<p>I downloaded gmock and linked against it without much in the way of problems. I have written a mock using gmock and it compiles fine. But then I read the following in the gmock faq:</p>

<pre>
If you want to use something other than Google Test (e.g. CppUnit or CxxTest) as your testing framework, just change the main() function in the previous section to:

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // The following line causes Google Mock to throw an exception on failure,
  // which will be interpreted by your testing framework as a test failure.
  ::testing::GTEST_FLAG(throw_on_failure) = true;
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  ... whatever your testing framework requires ...
}

This approach has a catch: it makes Google Mock throw an exception from a mock object's destructor sometimes. With some compilers, this sometimes causes the test program to crash. You'll still be able to notice that the test has failed, but it's not a graceful failure. 
</pre>

<p>I obviously don't have a main. What do I need to do to get gmock to work with my dll? Should I consider alternatives to gmock?</p>

<p>Using cocoa's regex functionality, I was able to find and capture the ""[0;"", ""37m"" and ""[33m"" individually. the ""0;"" indicates the server's desire for any previous text styling to be removed and returned to the default which is black background and white text. The ""37m"" indicates that the server would like for text to be colored white (not sure why this is here, but this is what the server sends). The final ""33m"" indicates that the server wants the text to be colored yellow. My code correctly finds, strips out, and identifies the requested color changes in the string, but I am having trouble applying these colors to the NSAttributedString I create. The ranges supplied by the regex searches are no longer valid once I strip out the color sequences in the final string, what is an effective way to figure out where the color changes should be applied to the stripped string? In this example, all the color codes are supplied at the beginning, but in other cases, the color codes could be in the middle to cause the string to change color mid-line. NSAttributedString can handle this if I could figure out the proper ranges to assign the requested colors to.</p>

What is this and how should this be used? There are a lot of examples on the web which use it as follows with the common content/file type <code>css</code>, <code>js</code> and <code>img</code> (or <code>image</code>) as library name depending on the tag used:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;h:outputStylesheet library=""css"" name=""style.css"" /&gt;
&lt;h:outputScript library=""js"" name=""script.js"" /&gt;
&lt;h:graphicImage library=""img"" name=""logo.png"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How is it useful? The <code>library</code> value in those examples seems to be just repeating whatever is already been represented by the tag name. For a <code>&lt;h:outputStylesheet&gt;</code> it's based on the tag name already obvious that it represents a ""CSS library"". What's the difference with the following which also just works the same way?</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;h:outputStylesheet name=""css/style.css"" /&gt;
&lt;h:outputScript name=""js/script.js"" /&gt;
&lt;h:graphicImage name=""img/logo.png"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the generated HTML output is a bit different. Given a context path of <code>/contextname</code> and <code>FacesServlet</code> mapping on an URL pattern of <code>*.xhtml</code>, the former generates the following HTML with the library name as request parameter:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/contextname/javax.faces.resource/style.css.xhtml?ln=css"" /&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/contextname/javax.faces.resource/script.js.xhtml?ln=js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;img src=""/contextname/javax.faces.resource/logo.png.xhtml?ln=img"" alt="""" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>While the latter generates the following HTML with the library name just in the path of the URI:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/contextname/javax.faces.resource/css/style.css.xhtml"" /&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/contextname/javax.faces.resource/js/script.js.xhtml""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;img src=""/contextname/javax.faces.resource/img/logo.png.xhtml"" alt="""" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The latter approach makes in hindsight also more sense than the former approach. How exactly is the <code>library</code> attribute then useful?</p>

I want to write a word completion suggestion program that will return a list of maximum <code>k</code> words, starting with a given prefix, sorted in descending order of their frequency. The data structure should also be able to update the frequency count of a word by 1(Whenever a word is used).</p>

<p>For example-
Given 'engin' as prefix, and <code>k = 3</code>, it should return a list like this-
{ {17, ""engine""}, {10, ""engineer""}, {4, ""engineering""} }</p>

<p>The value of <code>k</code> should be within [1, 15].</p>

<p><code>Trie</code> data structure should have been enough if sorting by frequency wasn't a concern, but it is. Can anybody hint me on any data structure or any approach to solve this problem?</p>

<p>Note : <code>Trie</code> data structure consumes too much space. Seems like I can't afford over <code>10MB</code> for this data structure. Plus, if I use max heaps associated with trie nodes(at least upto 3/4 depth) the memory consumption becomes HUGE.</p>

<p>For now I've tried this-
Maintain 4 sorted sets(of pointers, pointing to the strings).
Set <code>i</code> is list of pointers to strings of <code>string length &gt;= i</code> sorted-</p>

<ul>
<li>Lexicographical order of first <code>i</code> letters of the string</li>
<li>If clash, in descending order of frequency</li>
<li>If clash again, in any order(insignificant)</li>
</ul>

<p>This works well, considering, I require O(4n<em>log2(n)) time and O(n</em>log2(n)) space for initialization. For each query, I have a lookup time complexity of O(log2(n)), plus a traversal of at most approximately 100 words in worst case. For updating the frequency of a word, O(8*log2(n)) time is required.</p>

<p>I have set a visibility expression on the column itself (right click on column header) which is functioning correctly. This is distinct from setting the hidden property on the individual cells. </p>

<p>Most people asking about this issue are only setting hidden=true on the individual cells. This results in the cells going invisible BUT the space they take remains, leaving a big gap in the middle of the set of columns.</p>

<p>As noted above, I'm setting the whole column to visible=false. This correctly collapses the whitespace, HOWEVER the width of the report body is not recalculated. This means a large amount of white space is displayed to the right of my columns. The major problem caused by this is that it forces the user to scroll over a long way to press the view report button. This occurs in report builder itself, and whilst using the report viewer control. Printing and exporting work OK (after much fiddling with margins/etc).</p>

<p>The only workaround I have heard for related issues is to create three different tablixes containing the different column sets. (I heard about this solution in relation to people working around the problem of setting hidden=true without realizing they needed to set visible=false.) This isn't going to help as the body of the report still must be equal to the width of the widest tablix. That will cut down my extra whitespace a little, but the problem still remains and is definitely noticeable.</p>

<p>There is an option ConsumeContainerWhitespace property that exists on the report itself that comes up in some searches. This appears to be related to a different problem and has no impact on what I'm talking about here.</p>

<pre><code>for(MyClass o: myFancyObject) {
    o.doSomething();
}
</code></pre>

<p>which will be compiled as</p>

<pre><code>Iterator it = myFancyObject.iterator();
while(it.hasNext()) {
    MyClass o = (MyClass)(iterator.next());
    o.doSomething();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But why is the next() method  to throw a NoSuchElementException?</p>

<p>So let us call the hasNext() method in the next() method like below:</p>

<pre><code>public MyClass next() {
    if (! hasNext())
        throw new NoSuchElementException();
    return mySecretDataModel.getElement(counter++);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But then I detect following problem: The hasNext() method will be called twice in each iteration. First it is called from the method which uses the iterator and then a second time by the next() method. This costs unnecessary computing time. Is this intention or just a design oversight by the authors of the Iterator interface?</p>

<p>Example : Consider a memory system with page size 64KB and 32-bit processor. Each entry in the page table is 4 Bytes. </p>

<p><strong>Single-level Page Table</strong> : 16 (2^16 = 64KB) bits are required to represent page offset. So rest 16-bits are used to index into page table. So </p>

<p><strong>*Size of page table = 2^16(# of pages) * 4 Bytes(Size of each page table entry) = 2^18 Bytes*</strong></p>

<p><strong>Multi-level Page Table</strong> : In case of two-level page table, lets use first 10-most significant bits to index into first level page table. Next 10-bits to index into second level page table, which has the page number to frame number mappings. Rest 12-bits represents the page offset. </p>

<p>Size of a second-level page table = 2^10 (# of entries) * 4 bytes(size of each entry) = 4 KB</p>

<p>Total size of all the second-level page tables = 2^10 (# of second-level page tables) * 4KB (Size of each second-level page table) = 4 MB</p>

<p>Size of first-level page table = 2^10(# of entries) * (10/8) Bytes (Size of each entry) = 1.25 KB</p>

<p><strong><em>Total memory required to store first and second level page tables = 4 MB + 1.25 KB</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong><em>So we need more memory to store multi-level page tables.</em></strong> </p>

<pre><code>        public class PurchaseRequestInfo

    public string Status { get; set; }
    public string FullName { get; set; }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>I have written my control this way:</p>

<pre><code>@(Html.Kendo().ComboBoxFor(m =&gt; m.Requester) .Filter(FilterType.Contains).Name(""requesterList"")
        .DataValueField(""Id"")
        .DataTextField(""FullName"")
            //.Value(Model.Requester.Id)
            //.Text(Model.Requester.FullName)

<p>The problem is that it shows nothing on initial load. I think that control do not take values from appropriate fields.</p>

<p>I tried to change it to <strong>m => m.Requester.Id</strong>, but it sends Id field value (not FullName field) to server filtering function on initial load....as a result it gets nothing. If I try to disable autobind it shows Id as a text on initial load. </p>

<p>I tried to use ComboBox() helper, i made it work on initial load by setting ""Value"" and ""Text"", but this will probably cause problems on submit/validation. </p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>



<pre class=""lang-rb prettyprint-override""><code>def permute(arr)
  permutation(arr.sort)
end

def permutation(arr, result=[])
  k = nil
  result += [arr]
  (arr.length-1).times do |i|
    if arr[i] &lt; arr[i+1]
      k = i
    end
  end
  if k.nil?
    return result
  else
    l = -1
    arr.length.times do |i|
      if arr[k] &lt; arr[i]
        l = i
      end
      l = nil if l == -1
    end
    arr[k], arr[l] = arr[l], arr[k]
    arr = arr[0..k] + arr[k+1..-1].reverse
    return permutation(arr, result)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The method is recursive, and on each successive call I concatenate <code>arr</code> to my <code>result</code> variable with <code>result += [arr]</code> because I want the method to return a nested array, e.g. <code>[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]..]</code></p>

<p>However, when I call this method it gives me a completely weird result.</p>

<pre class=""lang-rb prettyprint-override""><code>permute([1,2,3])
=&gt; [[1, 3, 2], [2, 3, 1], [2, 3, 1], [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1]]
</code></pre>

<p>Why are last three results all <code>[3,2,1]</code>? And the other arrays aren't correct either. The really strange thing is that I can fix this by changing my concatenation to <code>result += arr</code>. With this change, I get the following:</p>

<pre class=""lang-rb prettyprint-override""><code>permute([1,2,3])
=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]

#I know that I can get my desired nested array like so, but that's beside the point
[1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1].each_slice(3).to_a
=&gt; [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
</code></pre>

<p>I don't get the nested arrays that I want, but the output gives me the correct permutation. Why is it working correctly now, but not which I was using <code>result += [arr]</code>? Is this a Ruby bug, or am I missing something here?</p>

<p>These are from 2 different computers at two different offices.  How do I troubleshoot this?  We have a wrapper that is 'suppose' to catch all unhandled errors in the application, and it hasn't missed anything at this point. That confuses me even more as to how it's getting by that catch all.</p>

<p><strong>REQUIREMENT 1)</strong> - The map needs to seed an initial layer of fixed position markers.  Then an additional layer of markers to depict the location of vehicles.  The vehicles should always render on top of the station locations if they have the same <code>LatLng</code>.</p>

<p>Using Overlays in <code>MapView</code>, the Z-Index could be controlled by manipulating the order of the methods that generate the Overlays, this works perfectly:</p>

<pre><code>this.GenerateStations();  //Renders a base of Station Overlays
this.GenerateVehicles();  //Renders vehicles on-top of Station Overlays
</code></pre>

<p>However, when working with the GoogleMap v2, it appears the Map is rendering all the markers randomly regardless of the order each marker instance is created and added.  <strong>Is this an accepted deficiency of the map or are there workarounds?</strong></p>

<p><strong>REQUIREMENT 2)</strong> - Each marker implements a <code>InfoWindowAdapter</code> to display information about the marker.  On a background thread, the vehicle marker's location and icon are updated every second, the icon needs to change if it's <code>LatLng</code> is the same as a Station marker <code>LatLng</code>.  The problem is, if I update the marker's Position or Snippet the <code>InfoWindowAdapter</code> moves location along with the icon, but when I update the <code>setIcon</code> property, I lose the <code>InfoWindowAdapter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>//This works perfectly, InfoWindowAdapter snippet updates too
vMarker.setPosition(vehicleLatLng);
vMarker.setSnippet(vehicleSnippet);

//Causes the InfoWindowAdapter to disappear 
vMarker.setIcon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResource(imageResource));
</code></pre>

<p>It appears when setIcon is called, the marker is destroyed and rebuilt.  <strong>Is there another way to update the marker's icon w/out having to lose state with the <code>InfoWindowAdapter</code>?</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class A
{
    char* A;
    char* B;

public:
    A() {A = ' '; B = ' ';}
    A(char* pLast, char* pFirst)
    {

        A = new char [strlen(pLast) + 1];
        B = new char [strlen(pFirst) + 1];

        strcpy(A,pLast);
        strcpy(B,pFirst);
    };
}

class C:public A
{
    int X;
    char Y;
    int Z;
public:
    C(char* A, char* B, int X, char Y, int Z)
        :A(A,B)
    {
        //do stuff here
    }
    friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; out, const C&amp; outPut)
    {
        out &lt;&lt; outPut.A &lt;&lt; "","" &lt;&lt; outPut.B &lt;&lt; "","" &lt;&lt;outPut.X&lt;&lt; "","" &lt;&lt; outPut.Y &lt;&lt; "","" &lt;&lt; outPut.Z &lt;&lt; endl;
        return out;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to run this it tells me A and B are out of range which makes sense since those members are private in class A, I don't know how to get around this. I tried creating getter methods to access A and B but the data comes out as blank. I even tried added an object of class A as a member of class B to try to allow access to the members in class B still the data comes out blank. How do I get around this problem?</p>

<p>At this stage, the fileinput widget displays existing image and two button: CHANGE AND REMOVE.</p>

<p>I followed this code on the site:</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($data['file'])) {
 echo ""There is changes in file"";
 if ($data['file'] == '') {
   echo ""User has removed a file"";
 } else {
   echo ""User remove and select a new file"";
 }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>When I tried to change image OR remove existing image and select new one then click submit the form, none of the text was echoed. So my code did get into the IF statement. What I have done wrong? Please advise... thank you very much.</p>

For that I downloaded the JLayer 1.0.1 library and added it to my project. I also added the MP3 files to a package on my project -as well as some JPG images- so as to obtain them from there, and I'm using a hashmap (mapa) and this method to get them:</p>

<pre><code>public static String consiguePath (int i) {


return AppUtils.class.getClass().getResource(""/Movimiento/"" + mapa.get(i)).getPath();

}
</code></pre>

<p>so as to avoid absolute paths.</p>

<p>When I open an MP3 file I do this:</p>

<pre><code>try {
                            File archivo = new File(AppUtils.consiguePath(12));
                            FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(archivo);
                            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);
                            try {
                                Player player = new Player(bis);
                                player.play();
                            } catch (JavaLayerException jle) {

                        }
</code></pre>

<p>The whole thing runs perfectly in NetBeans, but when I build a .jar file and execute it it runs well but it won't open the MP3 files. What called my attention is that it doesn't have trouble in opening the JPG files that are on the same package.</p>

<p>After generating the .jar I checked the MyProject/build/classes/Movimiento folder and all of the MP3 files were actually there, so I don't know what may be happening.</p>

<p>I've seen others had this problem before but I haven't seen any satisfactory answer yet.</p>

<p>In order to describe my problem as precisly as possible, and even tho i'm aware this is only an implementation detail, i will start with my Event Sourcing mechanism. </p>

<h2>My events storage mechanism</h2>

<p><em>the following is widely inspired by Greg Young's CQRS document <a href=""https://cqrs.wordpress.com/documents/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cqrs.wordpress.com/documents/</a> (watch out for the PDF ""building an Event Storage"" section).</em></p>

<p>I have <strong>2 tables</strong>, one called <code>Aggregates</code> and another one called <code>Events</code> (Note the plural form as these are tables, not objects!) which look like this :</p>

<h3><em>Aggregates</em> Table</h3>

<p>All my aggregates are stored in this table ; it has 3 columns (SO doesnt support the md table formatting so, sorry, i'll go for a list):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>AggregateId</code> : basically this table's primary key. I'm using a Guid, as all my aggregates are using one.
<ul>
<li><code>AggregateType</code> : the fully qualified Aggregate's name.</li>
<li><code>CurrentVersion</code> : the current aggregate version. An integer that gets incremented every time an event get stored.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3><em>Events</em> Table</h3>

<p>Every domain event issued by any Aggregates get stored in there ; it has got 5 columns :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>AggregateId</code> : the foreign key to the aggregates' table.</li>
<li><code>SerializedEvent</code> : the domain event as it was issued by the aggregate but in a serialized form (eg. json)</li>
<li><code>Version</code> : An integer that gets incremented (for each given aggregate) every time an event get stored.</li>
<li><code>EventDate</code> : a datetime</li>
<li><code>UserName</code> : the user that issued the event's producing command</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example of a domain with 2 bounded contexts</h2>

<p>Now let's consider a merchant :</p>

<ul>
<li>A merchant <strong>buys products</strong> (that's the job of the purchase department, aka. supply chain department)</li>
<li>A merchant <strong>sells products</strong> (that's the job of the sales department, in our case let say it's done on a website)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The purchase department will consider a Product as following :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the product is purchasable by one or many suppliers</li>
<li>the product has a purchase pricing grid, probably different from a supplier to another</li>
<li>the product is stored in one or many warehouse where it is available (or not) in a given quantity</li>
<li>the product is therefore subject to inventory</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On the other hand, the sales department will consider the product in a different way :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the product has a sales price (and maybe even a sales pricing grid)</li>
<li>the product has guarantees, sales conditions...</li>
<li>in an e-commerce context, it would even have publication's related attributes (like pictures, categories, descriptions, user vote and comments...) (so probably )</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>that sounds like 2 distinct bounded contexts, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Actually, Product, seen from the website point of view with its pictures, categories and votes attributes, sound to me like a third bounded context, but let's not debate about it for the example's sake...</em></p>

<p>Let's now complete this domain example with the domain expert specification saying :</p>

<ul>
<li>""A product must have a name""</li>
<li>""The supply chain department is the one responsible for adding products to the system""</li>
<li>""As a consequence, the sales department NEVER adds products to the system but instead, it receives a NewProductAdded notification, informing him a new product is available for sales ""</li>
<li><p>(and probably some other rules like Sales Dptmt can only publish a product on the website once the supply chain Dpt. said this product was available in the ware house. )</p>

<p>And now i think we have a valid use case.</p>

<p><em>NB : while i'm facing a very similar problem in a real project, this use case is purely abstract and inspired of this Codemotion conference slide <a href=""http://goo.gl/lMWSFZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/lMWSFZ</a>.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>1 product aggregate per BC => 2 distinct Product AR</h2>

<p>So ok, in traditionnal design, I'd probably end up with a big <code>Product Entity</code> that would contain attributes related as much to the Sales point of view as to the supply point of view.</p>

<p>But I want to go for a DDD approach, and DDD says that I should protect my invariants within a bounded context.
So, the domain model of a product is different according to wether i'm within the Sales or in the Supply Bounded Context.</p>

<p>As far as i understood it, i should therefore have 2 entities :</p>

<ul>
<li>a Product Entity in the Sales BC</li>
<li>and another Product Entity in the supply BC...</li>
</ul>

<p>Still for the example's sake, we'll admit that those 2 Product entities were decided to be promoted to the range of aggregate root in their respective BC.</p>

<p>so to sum up we have :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 bounded context</p>
  
  <p>1 product Aggregate per bounded context</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>But this is the very same product right?</strong></p>

<h2>Designing the <code>Product AR</code> in the <em>Supply Chain BC</em></h2>

<p><em>The following is widely inspired by :</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>@codescribler's blog post : <a href=""http://goo.gl/UgYRqq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/UgYRqq</a></em></li>
<li><em>M. Verraes' conference : <a href=""http://goo.gl/iVrdZu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/iVrdZu</a></em></li>
</ul>

<p>First, let's have a look at my abstract AggregateRoot class :</p>

<pre><code>  namespace DomainModel/WriteSide;

  abstract class AggregateRoot
  {
    protected $lastRecordedEvents = [];

    protected function recordThat(DomainEvent $event)
    {
      $this-&gt;latestRecordedEvents[]=$event;
      $this-&gt;apply($event);
    }

    protected function apply(DomainEvent $event)
    {
      $method = 'apply'.get_class($event);
      $this-&gt;$method($event);
    }

    public function getUncommittedEvents()
    {
      return $this-&gt;lastestRecordedEvents;
    }

    public function markEventsAsCommitted()
    {
      $this-&gt;lastestRecordedEvents = [];
    }

    public static function reconstituteFrom(AggregateHistory $history)
    {
      foreach($history as $event) {
        $this-&gt;apply($event);
      }
      return $this;

    abstract public function getAggregateId();

  }
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, this class holds the ES mechanism.</p>

<p>Now let's have a look at its implementation for Product in the Supply Chain BC :</p>

<pre><code>namespace DomainModel/WriteSide/SupplyChain;
use DomainModel/WriteSide/AggregateRoot as BaseAggregate;

Class Product extends BaseAggregate
{
  private $productId;
  private $productName;
  //some other attributes related to the supply chain BC...


  public function getAggregateId()
  {
    return $this-&gt;productId;
  }

  private function __construct(ProductId $productId, $productName)
  {
    //private constructor allowing factory methods
  }

  public static function AddToCatalog(AddProductToCatalogCommand $command)
  {
    //some invariants protection stuff
    $this-&gt;recordThat(new ProductWasAddedToCatalog($command-&gt;productId));
  }

  private function applyProductWasAddedToCatalog(DomainEvent $event)
  {
    $newProduct = new Product($event-&gt;productId);
    return $newProduct;
  }

  //more methods there...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>The flow</h2>

<p><em>The following is widely inspired by @codescribler's blog post : <a href=""http://goo.gl/yuIjzf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/yuIjzf</a></em></p>

<ol>
<li>The UI (a user from the supply chain dpt.) has sent an <code>AddProductToCatalogCommand(/*...*/)</code> via the service layer (aka. command bus forwarding the command to its handler),</li>
<li><p>the handler has prepared the Product Aggregate (in other words, brought it to its current state by applying all previous events to it) and passed him the command over.</p></li>
<li><p>Given no exception was raised (in other word, the Aggregate handled the command properly), <strong>we're now at the point where the handler is requesting the changes the aggregate just applied to itself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The handler now persists the changes</strong> in the database :</p>

<ul>
<li>it inserts a new row in the <code>Aggregates</code> table :</li>
<li>AggregateId = ProductId</li>
<li>AggregateType = /some/namespace/Product</li>
<li>AggregateVersion = 0</li>
<li>it inserts a new row in <code>Events</code> table :</li>
<li>AggregateId = ProductId</li>
<li>Event = <code>ProductWasAddedToCatalog($productId)</code> (in a serialized form off course)</li>
<li>version = 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Persitence went well, so <strong>the handler forwards the event to the service layer</strong> (aka. event bus forwarding the event to its handler<strong>s</strong>) for its subscribers to do their jobs.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>here comes my problem!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of these subscribers is an event handler issuing a command for the Sales BC Product Aggregates.</p>

<pre><code>namespace DomainModel/WriteSide/Sales;
use DomainModel/WriteSide/AggregateRoot as BaseAggregate;

Class Product extends BaseAggregate
{
  private $productId;
  //some other attributes related to the Sales BC, like sales price, guarantees...


  public static function AddAutomaticallyProductToCatalogSinceSupplyChainAddedIt(UpdateSalesCatalogCommand $command)
  {
    // some invariants' protection code here

    $this-&gt;recordThat(new ProductWasAutomaticallyAddedToSalesCatalog($command-&gt;productId));

  }
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>So now, what is my <em>$command->productId</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Jimmy Bogard well summed it up in <a href=""http://goo.gl/QHBkSr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/QHBkSr</a> : <em>""Each Aggregate has a Root Entity [...] The root Entity has <strong>global identity</strong> and is ultimately responsible for checking invariants""</em></p>

<p>Global identity is the key word.</p>

<p>So in my use case, <strong>we have 2 disctinct Aggregates and we therefore should have 2 distincts AggregateRoot's Ids</strong>.</p>

<p>It's even more obvious under the light of the event storage mechanism described above because if both ARs had the same Id, one would receive some events of the other while processing its <code>public static function reconstituteFrom(AggregateHistory $history)</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So 2 distinct Ids. But still it's the very same product right? How do i make that explicit?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Possible solutions</h2>

<p>After investigation, i come up with 3 possibles solution. I hope someone will be able to guide me into the right one...</p>

<h3>Solution 1 : Holding a reference</h3>

<p>The sales BC Product Aggregate hold a reference to the supply chain Product Aggregate.</p>

<p>this would look like this :</p>

<pre><code>namespace DomainModel/WriteSide/Sales;
use DomainModel/WriteSide/AggregateRoot as BaseAggregate;

Class Product extends BaseAggregate
{
  private $productId;
  private $supplyChainProductId;   //the reference to the supply chain BC Product AR...


  public function getAggregateId()
  {
    return $this-&gt;productId;
  }

  //more methods there...
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Solution 2 : Using a composite primarey key in the Event Storage</h3>

<p>while i currently use the <code>AggregateId</code> column as primary key, i could use both <code>AggregateId</code> and <code>AggregateType</code>.</p>

<p>Since that would allow me to have both Product AR having the same ProductId, this looks like a smell to me ...  Alone because of the concept of AR global identity would be ruined...</p>

<h3>Solution 3 : using a product <em>sub-entity</em> in both AR</h3>

<p>Still from Jimmy Bogard's <a href=""http://goo.gl/QHBkSr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/QHBkSr</a>, "" Entities inside the boundary have local identity, unique only within the Aggregate.""</p>

<p>So i could model the sales BC Product Aggregate like following :</p>

<pre><code>namespace DomainModel/WriteSide/Sales;
use DomainModel/WriteSide/AggregateRoot as BaseAggregate;

// **here i'd introduce my sub-entity**
use DomainModel/Sales/Product/Entities/Product as ProductEntity;

Class Product extends BaseAggregate
{
  private $_Id;
  private $product;   //holds a ProductEntity instance


  public function getAggregateId()
  {
    return $this-&gt;_Id;
  }

  public function getProductId()
  {
    return $this-&gt;product-&gt;getProductId();
  }

  //more methods there...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>While this would allow to keep both AR having the same productId, this doesnt really make sense to me since the only way to get an aggregate is by its AR's Id</strong> (and not by the Id of any of its sub-entities).</p>

<p>Tho we could imagine having a sort of mapper on the Query side :</p>

<pre><code>namespace DomainModel/QuerySide;

Class ProductMapping
{
  private $productId;
  private $salesAggregateId;
  private $supplyChainAggregateId;
  private $product;   //holds a ProductEntity instance


  public function getSalesAggregateId()
  {
    return $this-&gt;salesAggregateId;
  }

  public function getSupplyChainAggregateId()
  {
    return $this-&gt;supplyChainAggregateId();
  }

}

Class ProductMappingRepository
{

  public function findByproductId($productId)
  {
    //return the ProductMapping object
  }

  public function addFromEvent(DomainEvent $event)
  {
    //this repository is an event subscriber....
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Beside this ProductMapper, the query side would then only know about the ProductId. Seems all done ...
but this again doesn't look right to me. Can't really say why, it just doesn't !...</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a fake use case, and as such, it's probably debatable whether the 2 bounded contexts described above shoud be modelled as such or not.</p>

<p>But i hope i made my point clear, namely how to identify the very same physical object (in that use case, a Product) in 2 different BCs.</p>

<h1>==================================================================</h1>

<h3>The question as asked Apr 18 at 11:51</h3>

<p>let's start straight with the context (taken from this Codemotion conference slide <a href=""http://goo.gl/lMWSFZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/lMWSFZ</a>).</p>

<p>Domain expert is a merchant, he buys, sales and shifts Products. He's got :</p>

<ul>
<li>an e-commerce web site for sales purpose </li>
<li>a supply chain department responsible for purchasing purpose</li>
<li>a logistics department responsible for the shipping</li>
</ul>

<p>So, we may consider having one Product Aggregate for each bounded context :</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A Product Aggregate for for the sales context</strong> that will hold properties like sales price, evtl. discount, customer friendly description, pictures, maybe some categories it belongs too etc..</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Product Aggregate for the purchase context</strong> that will hold references to the suppliers and their purchasing conditions (eg. pricing by quantity, availabilities etc...)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An Item Aggregate for the logistics</strong> context holding properties like size and weight (note that in this context, the aggregate's name is Item and not Product as the logistic department isnt concerned about wether it's a product or a packaging or a palett)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Domain expert also says :</p>

<ul>
<li>""the purchase department is the one that insert new Products to the system""</li>
<li>""once the purchase department has inserted a new product in the system, it must be available for the others""</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now my question is simple :</p>
  
  <p>how do I reference each aggregate to each other, given it's in the end
  ""the very same Product""?</p>
  
  <p>Should Sales and Logisitics Aggregates contains an PurchasedProductId
  ? I've been told to be very carefull with external references but ...
  how else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong></p>

<p>this question must be seen under the light of an Events Storing pattern, where :</p>

<ul>
<li>every Aggregates get stored with its unique Id in an Aggregates Table (where rows are AggregateId, AggregateType, CurrentVersion), </li>
<li>this unique Id get used as foreign key in an Events Table (that stores all the events that happened to the AR in 3 column : AggregateId, SerializedEvent, Version)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if the same ProductId should be used as @Plalx is suggesting it in its reply, the question becomes :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how can you have 2 Aggregates using the same Id whereas, by definition, an Aggregate is a self-containing Entity and, still by definition, an Entity must have a unique Id?</p>

<p>I currently have this code.  Basically, it looks for some values on the URL of a web application, and then passes the name of the URL variable and the value of the URL variable into the application, where it will then be added to an output stream of text.  So the variables would look like ""&amp;LeadID=123"" which would translate to the ""LeadId"" and ""123"".  At that point, we reformat it into an XML value, such as </p>

<pre><code>&lt;id sequence=""1"" source=""leadId""&gt;123&lt;/id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code that is responsible for checking for the variables, and then putting them into a Map, and then (in theory) passing them to the code which will format them:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;();
    Map&lt;String, String&gt; ProspectTrackingKeys = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();

    }

    if (recipSettings.containsKey(""wtk"")) {
        ProspectTrackingKeys.put(""wtk"", recipSettings.get(""wtk""));
    }

    if (recipSettings.containsKey(""efd"")) {
        ProspectTrackingKeys.put(""efd"", recipSettings.get(""efd""));
    }

    if (recipSettings.containsKey(""aid"")) {
        ProspectTrackingKeys.put(""aid"", recipSettings.get(""aid""));
    }

    if (recipSettings.containsKey(""oth"")) {

<li><p>The method setProspect(ArrayList) is undefined for the type Prospect</p></li>
<li><p>The method convertProspectIds(Map) in the type CompassADFAdaptor is not applicable for the arguments (List)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is in reference to this code, which is where the values should be passed into, and then formatted as the XML text:</p>

<p>A lot of these tables are many-to-many tables. Some have an identity field but Sync Framework doesn't support scenarios where the identity is other that the primary key so I had to exclude the identity column from sync. Before my database is synced I get a million database queries which slows sync down so it takes more than 24 hours to sync and my Azure bill is also growing.</p>

<p>Can I somehow instruct Sync framework when provisioning these tables so it can optimize sync?</p>

<p>The target database is read-only, i.e. only the sync writes to it so I can remove constraints etc. I have created the database without foreign keys but would it help if I created the target database also without primary keys?</p>

<p>UPDATE:
If I create the target database without indexes I get the error</p>

Once the user logs in, the connectionstring is used to connect to their site. Is there a way to deploy all 10 sites from a single Octo project?

<p><strong>Here is my setup</strong>.
Nginx --> Uwsgi --> Django --> (Memcached/ Mysql)</p>

<p>I have a set of APIs in Django which return json response.
Earlier I was using memcached 2 part middleware to do auto caching. Now to get more control ,I have moved to low level APIs. I use celery to create pickled data sets and insert data in memcached once a day and My Apis fetch the data from memcached.</p>

<p>I am using NGINX and Uwsgi( 16 workers) in my production environment and was getting a speed of about 8K requests with 2 part middleware approach. Only my first request used to be slow.
But with lower level cache I am getting 1/10th speed .</p>

<p>Initially I thought it was due to extra middlewares and custom code which was getting executed, but I have trimmed that also. I moved from pickle to cPickle but I do not think that is the bottleneck. I am using apache benchmark to conduct tests.</p>

<p>I am attaching Memcached ( -vv) logs for both middleware approach and for low level cache api. 
If anybody can point me right direction........ thanks</p>

<p>I saw catche-middleware code for Django. They seem to be saving django httpresponse object in cache. Middleware also calls low-level apis internally .I tried saving httpresponse in cache  also , but no change...</p>

<p>It gives me exactly what I want, but now I need to get this recombined pandas dataframe into labeledPoints so that I can use it with the MLlib algorithms. How can I do the opposite of the .toPandas() function and convert from pandas to spark dataframe or labeledPoint?</p>

We use ClearCase version control and only snapshot views due to platform restrictions. I have tried setting up Hudson and Luntbuild. They both show the same behaviour. In a view, we have lots of libraries that are used for build but are strictly read-only. The CI system executes cleartool lshistory and finds a change in the VCS. After that, it executes cleartool setcs, which causes update of the view. This can take about half an hour, which is very undesirable for CI. Why wouldn't it update only the changed elements, which were previously obtained by cleartool lshistory? Is there a CI system that can do this?</p>

"32039069","1","","","2015-08-16 19:30:57","","0","29","<p>When it comes to converting from svn to hg it seems like there are a million pages devoted to it (both in stackoverflow and the web in general), but they all seem to have laundry lists about which tools are available, and maybe a recommendation (though they vary, and generally don't really say why it's recommended) but no real information about the factors which would make a tool the best for my requirements. Just as bad much of the info comes from 2010 or so, sometimes with notes or other pages saying ""that tool is outdated and/or not well maintained"". With hg being rapidly developed 2010 might as well be the stone age.</p>

<p>I want to convert from svn to hg largely for the purposes of simplifying some serious merges. I'd love to convert the whole team to hg, but for various reasons that isn't going to happen yet. So it'll probably be that I'll use hg for sometime, while the rest of the team continues with svn. Therefore it's important for me to be able to round trip, i.e. convert an svn repo to hg, work on hg, then push the changes back to svn. It's also important to be able to sync the hg repository with the svn repo since ongoing changes will be made to the svn repo. While a local hg repo would serve most of my purposes, I'd also like to keep a central one on the server so I can convince other people to try it.</p>

<p>I understand that the main reason DVCS's like hg and git are better at merging is not that they're distributed, but that they keep history in a form that's much more conducive to merging. If I convert an svn repo to hg will hg get enough of that history in its preferred form so that it'll be able to do better merges? What about when I sync?</p>

<p>I don't care about which OS the conversion tool runs on, as we use Windows 7 for our laptops and Linux on the server (which I have superuser access to). If anything I might prefer Linux as that's where the svn repo is and where the central hg repo will be. Nor do I care about how long the initial conversion takes (though sync is another matter) as I can start the conversion on Friday and get in on Monday (our svn repo is just not that big anyway).</p>

<p>Can anyone give me some advice about which svn to hg tools would serve my specific requirements?</p>

<pre><code>it ""should create a delayed notification per default"" do
  Notification::Email.should_not_receive(:notification)

  Post.make!(:community =&gt; @community)

</code></pre>

<p>For simplicity reasons I omitted why using this anything()-method: its because the Object handed in as first argument can be a Post or of a subclass of Post. Because of that in mind i went through all other ArgumentMatchers (:duck_type, :kind_of? ...) with no luck.</p>

<p>I am totally stuck, how could that happen, that this Error even occurs? Doesn't the <a href=""http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-mocks/frames"" rel=""nofollow"">doc in its ""Argument Matchers' section</a> say, that ""argument can be anything at all"" - so how can there be such an error?
And the next thing that creeps me, is my shiftlessness about the appearance of the error in the second context not in the first. Shouldn't it fail on both at least?</p>

Digger deeper I discovered it was because calling <code>GetTypes()</code> on an assembly was returning different results. I've been able to create a very simple test case to illustrate it.</p>

<p>In both Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 I created a new console application using .NET Framework 4.5.2. I put the following code in both projects.</p>

<pre><code>class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var types = typeof(Program).Assembly.GetTypes()
                .Where(t =&gt; !t.IsAbstract &amp;&amp; t.IsClass);

        foreach (var type in types)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(type.FullName);
        }

        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run in Visual Studio 2013 I get the following output (as expected).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>VS2013Example.Program</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I run in Visual Studio 2015 I get the following output (not as expected).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>VS2015Example.Program</p>
  
  <p>VS2015Example.Program+&lt;>c</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what is that <code>VS2015Example.Program+&lt;&gt;c</code> type? Turns out it's the lambda inside the <code>.Where()</code> method. Yes, that's right, somehow that local lambda is being exposed as a type. If I comment out the <code>.Where()</code> in VS2015 then I no longer get that second line.</p>

<p>I've used Beyond Compare to compare the two .csproj files but the only differences are the VS version number, the project GUID, names of the default namespace and assembly, and the VS2015 one had a reference to System.Net.Http that the VS2013 one didn't.</p>

<p>Has anyone else seen this?</p>

<p>Does anyone have an explanation as to why a local variable would be being exposed as a type at the assembly level?</p>

<p>So I'm assuming every time you CTRL+TAB or open a new .js file the Intellisense gets rebuilt, and to me it looks like it rebuilds Intellisense every time you CTRL+TAB regardless of whether you made any changes or now, and it never appears to release any memory, the memory usage never goes down.</p>

<p>I've tried every solution I've found online, even some that seemed stupid because I'm getting desperate, I even installed VS2010 SP1 Beta today hoping Microsoft had fixed it - no.</p>

<p>Closing TABS doesn't help either, the memory usage remains high.
My current solution is to restart VS2010 every 30-60 minutes and try keep a minimum number of files open.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>From the valuable advice I received <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12044421/c-sharp-background-worker-to-update-status-label"">here</a> I have now moved all of my database intensive code to a backgroundworker, specifically the direct calls to the database. That code is executed during the backgroundworker's DoWork event. If a DataTable is returned during the DoWork event, I set that DataTable to a class-wide variable. This is done, to avoid having to invoke the controls requiring the DataTable every time I run this code.</p>

<p>While that code is being executed, I have a label that is updated in the main UI thread, to let the user know that something is occurring. To update the label I use a timer, such that every 750 ms a ""."" is appended to the label's string.</p>

<p>The first thing that I noticed was that the backgroundworker's RunWorkerCompleted event wasn't triggering. To solve this I did an <code>Application.DoEvents();</code> before each call I made to the backgroundworker. It was ugly, but it caused the event to trigger. If anyone has an alternative to fix this, I am all ears.</p>

<p>I then came across an interesting predicament. If I run the program within Visual Studio 2010, in the debugging mode, I get an InvalidOperationException error stating that the ""Cross-thread operation not valid: Control 'lblStatus' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on."" This error occurs during the backgroundworker's RunWorkerCompleted event, where I set the text of a label in the main UI thread. But, when I launch the application directly, through the executable, it works exactly as desired (i.e. the label's text is set correctly).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

The problem is that I have documents placed on two pages - front and back (or side - A and side B - <code>sa</code> and <code>sb</code>), scanned in images, named <code>0001sa.jpg</code>, <code>0001sb.jpg</code> etc. I have to visualize parts of them in the browser, and later put their URL-s in database.</p>

<p>If user marks both files, it is easy:</p>

<pre><code>function readURL(input) {
    if (input.files &amp;&amp; input.files[0]) {

        filelst = input.files;        
        $(""#pict_name"").val( filelst[0].name);

        var reader = new FileReader();

        reader.onload = function (e) {              
            $('#imgPrev').attr('src', e.target.result).css('max-width', '2200px');
            $('#imgPrev').attr('data-zoom-image', e.target.result);
        //  imgPrev is the ID of the div, where I place the preview 
        // of part the image
        }

        var reader_b = new FileReader();
        reader_b.onload = function (eb) {

        }
        reader_b.readAsDataURL(input.files[1]);

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But clicking of two files is not convenient for the operators and 
predisposes to errors. If I could use the URL of the back to upload it, it is possible even to separate files in different directories.
Ho can I achieve this, or is <code>FileReader</code> not the right method in this case?</p>

filepath = glob.glob(directory)

        for line in fileO:

            sentences += line.count('.') + line.count('!') + line.count('?')

            tempwords = line.split()
            words = 0
            words += len(tempwords)

            outputO = open(output, ""a"")
            outputO.write(""Name: "" + name + ""\n"" + ""Words: "" + str(words) + ""\n"")

wordCount(filepath)
</code></pre>

<p>This writes the word counts to a file named ""output.txt"" and gives me output that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Name: /Users/..../..../files/Bush1989.02.9.txt
Words: 10
Name: /Users/..../..../files/Bush1989.02.9.txt

Name: /Users/..../..../files/Bush1989.02.9.txt
Words: 3
Name: /Users/..../..../files/Bush1989.02.9.txt
Words: 0
Name: /Users/..../..../files/Bush1989.02.9.txt
Words: 4821
</code></pre>

<p>And this repeats for each file in the directory. As you can see, it gives me multiple counts for each file. The files are formatted such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Address on Administration Goals Before a Joint Session of Congress</p>
  
  <p>February 9, 1989</p>
  
  <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the House and
  Senate...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it seems that the script is giving me a count of each ""part"" of the file, such as the 10 words on the first line, 0 on the line break, 3 on the next, 0 on the next, and then the count for the body of the text. </p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a single count for each file. Any help/direction is appreciated.</p>

Using div elements, I created the nav bar and then separated each link into its own container.  By default, they all crush over to the left side, not centered in the nav bar.

<p>I generally know that if tables have indexes, we can get better performance when joining each other and filtering records.<br>
But when I create an index on a table, VFP creates a new file CDX on disk. Thus, if I have 10 tables with primary key indexes, I will have further 10 CDX files and totally I will have 20 data files on the disk. It would take more spaces on disk. For example,</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE orders( ;
    odrid I AUTOINC PRIMARY KEY, ;
    cusid I, ;
    odrcode V(10) ;
)
INDEX ON cusid TAG cudid &amp;&amp; index on FOREIGN KEY

<p>It would create two files orders.dbf and orders.cdx.
Is it worth to create indexes on primary keys and foreign keys ? 
How would performance be different with indexing or without indexing ?</p>

The people of Stack Overflow helped me out a great deal however I keep getting an error saying <code>AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'strip'.</code> The problem is that all the information in my CSV files are not integers. Being the python newbie that I am, a few days of trying to fix it only made things worse. Here is what I have from my previous question that gives me the error: </p>

<pre><code>import csv
import glob
import os 
import re 

numbered = re.compile(r'N\d+').match

for fn in fns:
     # open for counting
     reader = csv.reader(open(fn,""rb""))
     count = sum(1 for row in reader if row and not any(r.strip() == 'DIF' for r in     row) and numbered(row[0]))

 # reopen for filtering
 reader = csv.reader(open(fn,""rb""))

 with open (os.path.join('out', fn), 'wb') as f:
    counter = 0
    w = csv.writer(f)
    for row in reader:
        if row and 'Count' in row[0].strip():
            row = ['Count', count]
        if row and not any(r.strip() == 'DIF' for r in row): #remove DIF
            if numbered(row[0]):
                counter += 1
                row[0] = 'N%d' % counter
        w.writerow(row)
</code></pre>

<p>The code is essentially supposed to run through a bunch of CSV files and delete all the lines that have 'DIF' in them and fix the numbering due to deleted lines. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>This works and brings up a GUI for me to enter data in, however obviously it doesn't link up. I've got all the form elements there I need, with IDs which is kosher to the PHP function.</p>

<p>I've been unable to find any resources which allow me to use the PHP function <strong>*student2_POST*</strong> in my jQuery code. Everything I find seems to be related to non-PHP functions. </p>

<p>TLDR:
I have a function hosted on a web service which submits a form and I need a way to implement this function in jQuery. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

<li>Convert the part of the unknown type to a JObject</li>
<li>Preserve somehow the type information, so I can send the <strong>same</strong> json back to the client at a later point as it was passed to the server.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>By replacing the <code>SerializationBinder</code> on the <code>JsonSerializer</code>, I can force Json.NET to deserialize the json contained into a <code>JObject</code>. This is <em>almost</em> what I would like to have, alas the <em>$type</em> property is lost.</p></li>
<li><p>In the binder returning a type that points to an object that would work in harmony with a custom <code>JsonConverter</code> which would gobble up the offending object such that upon write it would faithfully recreate the json as it was encountered. However, when you hit the $type info, no converters will be called anymore, apparently we are then in a different branch of the json.NET code</p></li>
<li><p>One can handle a serialization error, try to read from the reader the <em>offending</em> part, then one could create a JOBject manually and annotate the type information.</p></li>

The information I need was that I can use the admin tenant for retrieving all servers (regardless of their owner). This allows me also to use the publicURL.</p>

    &lt;classpath path=""/opt/hudson/tools/jacocoant.jar""/&gt;
&lt;/taskdef&gt;

&lt;target name=""jacocoReport""&gt;
        &lt;jacoco:dump address=""${jacoco.host}"" port=""${jacoco.port}"" dump=""true"" reset=""true"" destfile=""${jacocoReportFile}"" append=""false""/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;

&lt;target name=""jacocoReset""&gt;
        &lt;jacoco:dump address=""${jacoco.host}"" port=""${jacoco.port}"" reset=""true"" destfile=""${jacocoReportFile}"" append=""false""/&gt;
    &lt;delete file=""${jacocoReportFile}""/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally I have a maven build step which calls sonar:sonar</p>

<p>Here's the section in the POM relative to my integration report;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sonar.java.coveragePlugin&gt;jacoco&lt;/sonar.java.coveragePlugin&gt;
&lt;sonar.dynamicAnalysis&gt;reuseReports&lt;/sonar.dynamicAnalysis&gt;
&lt;sonar.jacoco.itReportPath&gt;${WORKSPACE}/it-jacoco.exec&lt;/sonar.jacoco.itReportPath&gt;
&lt;sonar.language&gt;java&lt;/sonar.language&gt;
&lt;sonar.branch&gt;9.9.5&lt;/sonar.branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and here's my plugin configuration :</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>      &lt;plugin&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.jacoco&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;jacoco-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;configuration&gt;
          &lt;append&gt;true&lt;/append&gt;
        &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;executions&gt;
          &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;pre-test&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
              &lt;goal&gt;prepare-agent&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
          &lt;/execution&gt;
          &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;post-test&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;phase&gt;test&lt;/phase&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
              &lt;goal&gt;report&lt;/goal&gt;
              &lt;goal&gt;report-integration&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
          &lt;/execution&gt;
        &lt;/executions&gt;
      &lt;/plugin&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>When the build finishes, my Sonar entry still shows at 0% for my integration tests. But when I take the same it-jacoco.exec report and import it using Eclipse's Jacoco import Coverage session, I get 26% coverage.</p>

<p>Finally when I look into my Jenkins build logs I see the following;</p>

<pre><code>Sensor JaCoCoItSensor...
Analysing /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/XXXXXX/it-jacoco.exec
No information about coverage per test.
Sensor JaCoCoItSensor done: 34 ms
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have any automated integration tests right now, I only wish to import the integration report from my external test machine.</p>

<p>I also have a delete button to remove the selected row.</p>

<p>My user has a habit of clicking into to the edit and date controls (which doesn't change the selected row) and then hitting delete to remove the row he has clicked on.  Unfortunately, this deletes the wrong row.</p>

<p>How can I change the row selection whenever the user clicks into the controls?</p>

<p>Firstly, the file stays in sync (editing and saving the file externally automatically prints the updated contents), even when appended to. How is my code able to access beyond the number of bytes I've mapped (the initial file size) without segfaulting? Is it because <code>mmap</code> always rounds up the length to the system page size? If so, can this behavior be depended upon on <code>POSIX</code> systems in general (I could not find any such requirement in the <code>mmap</code> man page).</p>

<p>Secondly, how does the text automatically get appended with a <code>'0'</code>? Is it because the non-mapped bytes are automatically zeroed? Can this behavior be depended upon?</p>

I know the following (from the web site): ""The projection used to project the latitude and longitude coordinates is that used for the Decade of North American Geology (DNAG) maps. The projection type is Spherical Transverse Mercator with a base latitude of zero degrees and a reference longitude of 100 degrees W. The scale factor used is 0.926 with no false easting or northing. The longitude-latitude datum is NAD27 and the units of the xy-coordinates are in meters. The ellipsoid used is Clarke 1866. The resolution of the map is 50x50km"". But don't know what to do with this data. I tried:</p>

<pre><code>proj4string(data)=CRS(""+init=epsg:4267"")
data.sp &lt;- SpatialPoints(data, CRS(""+proj=longlat+ellps=clrk66+datum=NAD27"") )
</code></pre>

<p>But had various problems (with NA's) and fundamentally I think that the data isn't in the right format.. I think that the SpatialPoints function wants a data on location (in 2-D) and a third array of values associated with those locations (x,y,z data - I guess my problem is working out the x and the y's from my data!)</p>

<p>Any help greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I'm not sure why it's failing. My experience with rails and ruby in general is slim to none, but I've used Capistrano in the past and it has worked on this machine. Is there something specific with Snow Leopard that I need to fix? </p>

<p>I've been able to use annotations to route the right url to the right controller method, but the template I put in @template() never seem to work.</p>

<p>Basically, what I'm after is an explanation of what goes into it. I've seen in the official documentation:</p>

<p><code>@Template(""SensioBlogBundle:Post:show.html.twig"")</code></p>

<p>But I don't understand what that param is. I get the ending part is literally a filename, but what are the first two components separated by colons? I've tried a bunch of different things to try and understand, but I haven't been able to make it connect to a new template file I've placed in views/main/index.html.twig of my bundle's resources. I've tried</p>

<p><code>@Template(""BlogBundle:main:index.html.twig"")</code></p>

<p>With no success. (BlogBundle is the folder all my code resides in, within my bundle)</p>

<p>The rest of the documentation seems to make sense, it's just this one param never seems to get a good explanation.</p>

My JDialog has both minimize and maximize buttons by default.
When the maximize button is pressed, the dialog maximizes - but the content doesn't.  It just stays the same size, centered in a huge dialog.
Same happens when you just grab the edge and re-size the dialog.</p>

<p>I've tried adding a WindowStateListener - but it never gets invoked.
I added a WindowListener - and it's only invoked on Open/Close/Activate/Deactivate.</p>

<p>So, I either need to be able to get the dialog content to re-size with the dialog, OR remove the maximize button.
(and I'd like to get rid of the minimize button.)</p>

<p>I do do a pack() after creating the dialog, as the controls in the dialog are dynamically created from a block of data, so I don't have an initial size to work with.</p>

<p>Okay, so here's the code.  All the generated UI panels are in GridBagLayouts as well.</p>

<pre><code>public class FastAccessDialog extends JDialog implements BeanActionListener {

    setTitle(BeanUtil.cleanUpCamelCase(methodName));

    boolean enabled = (UIHintUtil.isEnabled(bean) == EnableState.ENABLED);

    // Find the BeanOperationInfo for that method.
    MBeanInfo info = JMXConnectionSingleton.getInstance().getMBeanInfo(bean);
    MBeanOperationInfo[] operations = info.getOperations();
    JComponent comp = null;

    for (MBeanOperationInfo opInfo : operations) {
        if (opInfo.getName().equals(methodName)) {
            comp = OperationsManager.getInstance().createControls(bean, opInfo, this, true, enabled);
            break;
        }
    }

    if (comp == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Unknown method name: "" + methodName);
    }

    Container cont = getContentPane();

<p>I've been researching this problem for several days and have tried a number of changes, none of which has had any effect.  Here's my list of failed tries:</p>

<ol>
<li>Made following changes to httpd.conf and php.ini:
EnableMMAP on
EnableSendfile on
Enable and set realpath_cache_size= 4m to your php.ini file
(It turns out I had only set the size; enabling means uncommenting the previous line in php.ini.  I think.  Uncommenting the line doesn't seem to have any effect.)</li>
<li>Uncommented this line in \etc\hosts:    ::1  localhost  (have since recommented as it had no effect.) </li>
<li>Adding the line  127.0.0.1  127.0.0.1 to \etc\hosts.  Have since removed; had no effect.</li>
<li>Replacing localhost with 127.0.0.1 in httpd.conf</li>
<li>Verified that the system nameservers are not hardcoded and are being pulled from the DHCP server.  For the record our router's nameservers are 
68.94.156.1 dnsr1.sbcglobal.net and 68.94.157.1 dnsr2.sbcglobal.net </li>
<li>Configured mysql.default_host and mysqli.default_host (in php.ini) to localhost, then to 127.0.0.1; neither had any effect.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can anyone suggest something that I haven't tried?  This smells like a problem with php or mysql but neither one is logging any problems.</p>

  <p>This error generally occurs when you attempt to add a file type that does not support object browsing, such as .htm

<p>What I find earlier is that when I give !important along with the attribute value in only one of the CSS class then that change immediately reflects on the portal. In my view, one reason for this could that a mapping or something is missing from confiruration side or from code side because of the reason it's not picking the right color from control panel.</p>

<p>Appreciate any help!<br/><br/></p>

<p>Instead of using canvas elements for swapping, it now only has text.<br/>
The goal is if a user selects a cell beside the <code>blankCell</code> i would like to swap that cell with the <code>blankCell</code>, if the user selects a cell not beside <code>blankCell</code> I would like nothing to happen.<br/>
Only concerned with left and right detection for now.</p>

The UIButtons (called CableDisconnectButton) are a subclassed UIButton so I could add two additional properties to them. I also add UILabels to go over the buttons</p>

<p>However, the background images of the buttons are invisible or don't appear until I tap on the screen somewhere. The UIlabels show up fine, but not the buttons. It can be a tap on the UIPopoverController or anywhere else on the screen. Once I've tapped that first time, the buttons will be there until the app is closed. So, this only happens right after launch and up until I first open that UIPopover. I tap plenty of times before opening the popover.</p>

<p>The functionality of the buttons and everything else works fine, but the background images are hidden on that first launch and I have no idea why.</p>

<p>Here's how I create the buttons and UILabel:</p>

<pre><code>    //create custom button
CableDisconnectButton *removeConnectionButton = [CableDisconnectButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
removeConnectionButton.frame = CGRectMake(x, y, 190, 80);
removeConnectionButton.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
[removeConnectionButton setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""images/cable_disconnect_button.png""] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[removeConnectionButton setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""images/cable_disconnect_button_over.png""] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];

//set input and output jacks to button properties
removeConnectionButton.inputJack = inputJack;
removeConnectionButton.outputJack = self.outputJackView;

//add action to button
[removeConnectionButton addTarget:self action:@selector(removeConnectionButtonTarget:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];

//create label for output
UILabel *outputConnectionLabel = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(x+18, y+5, 180, 22)];
outputConnectionLabel.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
outputConnectionLabel.textColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
outputConnectionLabel.text = self.outputJackView.jackDisplayName;
outputConnectionLabel.font = [UIFont systemFontOfSize:16];

//add subviews
[self addSubview:removeConnectionButton];
[self addSubview:outputConnectionLabel];
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried to add a regular, non-custom UIButton and it appears without the tap. I suspect it may have something to do with the subclassed UIButton, but I'm not sure why. The extra properties added to the UIButton are strings that are crucial to the functionality of the and can't be omitted.</p>

<p>Essentially the code looks like this, </p>

<pre><code>response_results = []

<p>When I use this kind of code: <code>TR([request.vars[input] for input in inputs])</code> or <code>TR(*the_list)</code>, it works fine.</p>

<p>However, I have come up with a need to use a hybrid of these two i.e. <code>TR([*response for response in response_results])</code>. But, it fails giving an error message: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Python version 2.7 does not support this syntax. Starred expressions are not allowed as assignment targets in Python 2.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I run this code instead i.e. without a '*': <code>TR([response for response in response_results])</code> it runs fine but puts all the columns of my row together in the first column of the generated HTML table, leaving all other columns blank.</p>

<p>Can someone kindly help me resolve this issue and guide on how can I achieve the required result of displaying each column of the rows at their proper spots in the generated HTML table?</p>

<p>Is there a logger available in Java that does encryption(preferably 128-bit AES or better)?</p>

<p>I've done a lot of searching for this over the last couple of days.  There's a few common themes to what I've found:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dissecting information between log4j and log4j2 is giving me headaches(but mostly unrelated to the task at hand)  </li>
<li>Most threads are dated, including the ones here on SO. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16677455/java-encrypting-logs"">This one</a> is probably the best I've found on SO, and one of the newer answers links to a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/10291282/2295834"">roll-your-own version</a>.  </li>
<li>The most common answer is ""roll-your-own"", but these answers are also a few years old at this point.  </li>
<li>A lot of people question why I or anyone would do this in Java anyway, since it's simple enough to analyze Java code even without the source.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the last point, it's pretty much a moot point for my project.  We also use a code obfuscator and could employ other obfuscation techniques.  The point of using encryption is simply to raise the bar of figuring out our logs above ""trivially easy"", even if it's only raised to ""mildly time-consuming"".  A slightly relevant aside - the kind of logging we're going to encrypt is intended merely for alpha/beta, and will likely only include debug, warn, and error levels of logging(so the number of messages to encrypt should be fairly low).</p>

<p>The best I've found for Log4j2 is in their <a href=""http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/plugins.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>KeyProviders</strong></p>
  
  <p>Some components within Log4j may provide the ability to perform data encryption. These components require a secret key to perform the encryption. Applications may provide the key by creating a class that implements the <code>SecretKeyProvider</code> interface. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I haven't really found anything other than wispy statements along the lines of 'plug-ins are able of doing encryption'.  I haven't found a plug-in that actually has that capability.</p>

<p>I have also just started trying to find other loggers for Java to see if they have one implemented, but nothing is really jumping out for searches like 'java logging encryption'.  </p>

<p>According to this tutorial, <a href=""https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-activator/blob/master/src/main/scala/StreamingApp.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-activator/blob/master/src/main/scala/StreamingApp.scala</a>, I can run StreamingApp locally and send messages to the actorStream itself.</p>

<p>Then I tried to attach the sender part to my another spark master and send message from spark master to the remote actor in StreamingApp. The code is as follows</p>

<pre><code>object SenderApp extends Serializable {

    def main(args: Array[String]) {

        val driverPort = 12345
        val driverHost = ""xxxx""
        val conf = new SparkConf(false) 
            .setMaster(""spark://localhost:8888"") // Connecting to my spark master
            .setAppName(""Spark Akka Streaming Sender"")
            .set(""spark.logConf"", ""true"")
            .set(""spark.akka.logLifecycleEvents"", ""true"")
        val actorName = ""helloer""

        val sc = new SparkContext(conf)

        val actorSystem = SparkEnv.get.actorSystem

        val url = s""akka.tcp://sparkDriver@$driverHost:$driverPort/user/Supervisor0/$actorName""

        val helloer = actorSystem.actorSelection(url)

        helloer ! ""Hello""
        helloer ! ""from""
        helloer ! ""Spark Streaming""

        helloer ! ""Scala""
        helloer ! ""and""
        helloer ! ""Akka""
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I got messages from StreamingApp saying it encountered DeadLetters.
The detailed messages are:</p>

<pre><code>INFO LocalActorRef: Message [akka.remote.transport.AssociationHandle$Disassociated] from Actor[akka://sparkDriver/deadLetters] to Actor[akka://sparkDriver/system/transports/akkaprotocolmanager.tcp0/akkaProtocol-tcp%3A%2F%2FsparkDriver%40111.22.33.444%3A56840-4#-2094758237] was not delivered.

<pre><code># models.py
from django.contrib.contenttypes import generic
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.db import models

class MyRelatedModel(models.Model):
    some_field = models.IntegerField()
    some_models = generic.GenericRelation('MyModel')

class MyModel(models.Model):
    data = models.TextField()
    more_data = models.FloatField(editable=False)
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey()

    def clean(self):
        super(MyModel, self).clean()
        self.more_data = 5.5

    def save(self, *args, **options):
        print self.more_data    # prints 'None'
        super(MyModel, self).save(*args, **options)
</code></pre>

<p>The following goes in admin.py:</p>

<pre><code>from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.contenttypes import generic
from test_model_save.models import MyModel, MyRelatedModel

class MyModelInline(generic.GenericTabularInline):
    model = MyModel

class MyRelatedModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [MyModelInline]

admin.site.register(MyModel)
admin.site.register(MyRelatedModel, MyRelatedModelAdmin)
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to create an object in the Django admin, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>IntegrityError at /admin/test_model_save/myrelatedmodel/add/
test_model_save_mymodel.more_data may not be NULL
</code></pre>

<p>Before adding the generic foreign key to MyModel, the line <code>self.more_data = 5.5</code> in <code>clean()</code> successfully set the attribute value. In the example above, however, the attribute value is not persisted until <code>save()</code>. I am at a loss what might be causing this behavior. Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>(Tested using Django 1.4 with Sqlite backend)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The problem seems to be related to using the inlined interface in the admin. Creating objects of the two models separately works fine. Trying to create both types of objects on the same admin page (using the tabular inline interface) results in the IntegrityError above.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> If I change the generic foreign key in MyModel to a plain <code>models.ForeignKey(MyRelatedModel)</code>, the code works fine. So the problem is related to using a generic foreign key. At this stage this looks like a bug in Django.</p>

<p>The problem is the addresses returned by Google are not restricted (nor hinted) to Italy</p>

<p>For example if you search <code>mil</code> (the begininning of <code>Milano</code>) I get <code>Circondario di Miltenberg, Germania</code> and <code>Milion, Alemdar Mh., 34122 Istanbul/Provincia di Istanbul, Turchia</code> and <code>reka Mil', Sacha-Jacuzia, Russia</code>.</p>

<p>It's returning results (also, only three?) from all over the world, an nothing from Italy (even when there are multiple cities matching <code>mil</code>).</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I worked through<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730868.aspx"">this MSDN article</a>, but I'm missing something because it doesn't work.</p>

<p>First, I have some custom ClientCredentials that provide a custom ClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager:</p>

<pre><code>public class CentralAuthCredentials : ClientCredentials
{
	public override System.IdentityModel.Selectors.SecurityTokenManager CreateSecurityTokenManager()
	{
		return new CentralAuthTokenManager(this);
	}
}

public class CentralAuthTokenManager : ClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager
{
	private CentralAuthCredentials credentials;

	public CentralAuthTokenManager(CentralAuthCredentials creds) : base(creds)
	{
		this.credentials = creds;
	}

	public override SecurityTokenProvider CreateSecurityTokenProvider(SecurityTokenRequirement tokenRequirement)
	{
		if (this.IsIssuedSecurityTokenRequirement(tokenRequirement) || tokenRequirement.TokenType == CentralAuthToken.TOKEN_TYPE)
			return new CentralAuthTokenProvider(credentials.UserId, credentials.UserPassword, credentials.ImpersonateId, credentials.LoginType);
		else
			return base.CreateSecurityTokenProvider(tokenRequirement);
	}

	public override SecurityTokenAuthenticator CreateSecurityTokenAuthenticator(SecurityTokenRequirement tokenRequirement, out SecurityTokenResolver outOfBandTokenResolver)
	{
		outOfBandTokenResolver = null;
		if (this.IsIssuedSecurityTokenRequirement(tokenRequirement) || tokenRequirement.TokenType == CentralAuthToken.TOKEN_TYPE)
			return new CentralAuthTokenAuthenticator();
		else
			return base.CreateSecurityTokenAuthenticator(tokenRequirement, out outOfBandTokenResolver);
	}

	public override SecurityTokenSerializer CreateSecurityTokenSerializer(SecurityTokenVersion version)
	{
		return new CentralAuthTokenSerializer();
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I run the app, my custom credentials and token manager do get created.
However, in the method:</p>

<pre><code>CreateSecurityTokenProvider(SecurityTokenRequirement tokenRequirement)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The tokenRequirement.TokenType comes across as something other than my custom token. That brings up my <strong>1st question</strong>: How the heck does WCF know what the token requirements are?</p>

<p>Also, the method:</p>

<pre><code>public override SecurityTokenSerializer CreateSecurityTokenSerializer(SecurityTokenVersion version)
{
    return new CentralAuthTokenSerializer();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does get called once by the client, but none of the methods on the returned token serializer are ever called. This indicates to me that the custom token is never being sent across the wire. I assume this is because the call to CreateSecurityTokenProvider() never returned my custom token provider, since the SecurityTokenRequirement is never passed in indicating my custom token is needed.</p>

<p>On the client side, I have:</p>

<pre><code>public class CentralAuthorizationManagerClient : ClientBase&lt;ICentralAuthorizationManager&gt;, ICentralAuthorizationManager, IDisposable
{
	public PFPrincipal GenerateToken()
	{
		if (!this.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Contains(typeof(CentralAuthCredentials)))
			throw new ArgumentException(""Must set CentralAuthCredentials before calling this method."");
		return base.Channel.GenerateToken();
	}

	public PFPrincipal GenerateToken(CentralAuthToken token)
	{
		this.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Remove&lt;ClientCredentials&gt;();
		this.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new CentralAuthCredentials(token));
		return this.GenerateToken();
	}
</code></pre>

<p>These methods are basically supposed to remove the default credentials from the endpoint and attach a new instance of my custom CentralAuthCredentials. (I grabbed this Remove/Add combo from an MSDN article somewhere).</p>

<p>In the configuration:</p>

<pre><code>	&lt;behaviors&gt;
		&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;
			&lt;behavior name=""Server2ServerEndpointBehavior""&gt;
				&lt;clientCredentials type=""MyApp.Security.CentralAuthCredentials, MyApp""&gt;
					&lt;clientCertificate findValue=""localhost"" x509FindType=""FindBySubjectName"" storeLocation=""CurrentUser"" storeName=""My"" /&gt;
					&lt;serviceCertificate&gt;
						&lt;authentication certificateValidationMode=""None"" revocationMode=""NoCheck"" /&gt;
					&lt;/serviceCertificate&gt;
				&lt;/clientCredentials&gt;
			&lt;/behavior&gt;
		&lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;
	&lt;/behaviors&gt;

	&lt;bindings&gt;
		&lt;wsHttpBinding&gt;
			&lt;binding name=""wsHttpServer2Server""&gt;
				&lt;security mode=""Message""&gt;
					&lt;message clientCredentialType=""UserName"" /&gt;
				&lt;/security&gt;
			&lt;/binding&gt;
		&lt;/wsHttpBinding&gt;
	&lt;/bindings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the behavior's clientCredentials type is set to my custom client credentials. However, at the moment I still have the binding's clientCredentialType set to ""UserName"". This brings up my <strong>2nd question</strong>: What the heck should clientCredentialType=""?"" be set to if I'm using custom credentials? According to MSDN, the available values for <em>Message</em> security are: <em>None</em>, <em>Windows</em>, <em>UserName</em>, <em>Certificate</em>, and <em>IssuedToken</em>.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Hopefully I'm just missing something simple?  There are like 6 more classes to the entire implementation, but I tried to only include the bits needed to understand the situation...</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #1:</strong></p>

<p>I've been working on this all day, and thanks to a few sources, I realized that part of what I was missing was the very last step on <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731872.aspx"">this page</a>, which is adding the TokenParameters to the binding, so that the binding knows what the token looks like. That is the answer to my original 1st question; ""what the heck sets up the token requirements?"" Answer: the TokenParameters assigned to the binding.</p>

<p>So now I added the following extension which sets the TokenParameters on the binding:</p>

<pre><code>public sealed class CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension : BindingElementExtensionElement
{
	public CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension()
		: base()
	{
	}

	public override Type BindingElementType
	{
		get { return typeof(SymmetricSecurityBindingElement); }
	}

	protected override System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement CreateBindingElement()
	{
		X509SecurityTokenParameters protectionParams = new X509SecurityTokenParameters();
		protectionParams.InclusionMode = SecurityTokenInclusionMode.Never;

		SymmetricSecurityBindingElement innerBindingElement = new SymmetricSecurityBindingElement();
		innerBindingElement.EndpointSupportingTokenParameters.SignedEncrypted.Add(new CentralAuthTokenParameters());
		//innerBindingElement.MessageProtectionOrder = MessageProtectionOrder.SignBeforeEncrypt;
		innerBindingElement.ProtectionTokenParameters = protectionParams;

		return innerBindingElement;
	}
}

	&lt;extensions&gt;
		&lt;bindingElementExtensions&gt;
			&lt;add name=""CentralAuthCreds"" type=""MyApp.Security.Configuration.CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension, MyApp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"" /&gt;
		&lt;/bindingElementExtensions&gt;
	&lt;/extensions&gt;

	&lt;bindings&gt;
		&lt;customBinding&gt;
			&lt;binding name=""wsHttpServer2Server""&gt;
				&lt;CentralAuthCreds /&gt;
				&lt;binaryMessageEncoding /&gt;
				&lt;httpTransport /&gt;
			&lt;/binding&gt;
		&lt;/customBinding&gt;
	&lt;/bindings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Well that gets me a step further. Now I get a new exception on the server: </p>

<pre><code>""The security token manager cannot create a token authenticator for requirement ...""
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like WCF is using some default token manager to try to deal with my custom token, instead of my custom token handler (my custom token handler's constructor is never called).  I <em>think</em> this is happening because for the <em>client</em>, I have this config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;
    &lt;behavior name=""Server2ServerEndpointBehavior""&gt;
        &lt;clientCredentials type=""MyApp.Security.CentralAuthCredentials, MyApp""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But on the <em>server</em> I don't have any equivalent to let it know about the custom client credentials. So, <strong>new question</strong>: Where in the config for the server do I tell it what the custom ClientCredentials are?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Update #2:</strong></p>

<p>Well, I finally figured out a bit more of the puzzle.  I had only implemented a ClientCredentials implementation, thinking that the client sends creds, and thats it. The client doesnt authenticate the service, so I don't need custom ServiceCredentials.  Well, I was wrong. The specified ServiceCredentials authenticates the token from the ClientCredentials, and vice-versa. So I just had to add a custom ServiceCredentials implementation that passed the same TokenSerializer and TokenAuthenticator classes.</p>

<p>On to the next issue: WCF is now ignoring my x509 certs specified in config that were working fine with UserName auth.  I'm going to open a whole new question for this one!</p>

<p>I added a weight lookup to the sort function, which increased the performance by about 100% as well as the stability, as the previous sort function didn't consider all types, and as <code>1 == ""1""</code> the result depends on the inital order of the Array, as @Esailija points out.</p>

<p>The intent of the question is to improve this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/16915738/1487756"">Answer</a> of mine, i liked the question and since it got accepted and i felt like there is some performance to squeeze out of the sort function. I asked this question here since i hadn't many clues left where to start.<br>
<sub> Maybe this makes things clearer as well</sub></p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I rephrased the complete question, as many people stated i was not specific enough, i did my best to specify what i mean. Also i rewrote the <code>sort</code> function to better express the intent of the question.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Let <i>arrayPrev</i> be an <em>Array</em>  (<em>A</em>) ,where <em>A</em> consists of 0 to n <i>Element</i>s' (<em>E</em>)
<ul>
<li>Let an <em>Element</em> either be
<ul>
<li>of a <em>Primitive</em> type
<ul>
<li><em>boolean</em>, <em>string</em>, <em>number</em>, <em>undefined</em>, <em>null</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>a <em>Reference</em>  to an <em>Object</em>  <em>O</em>, where <em>O</em>.type = <em>[object Object]</em> and <em>O</em> can consist of 
<ul>
<li>0 to n <em>Properties</em>  <em>P</em>, where <em>P</em> is defined like <i>Element</i> plus
<ul>
<li>an circular <i>Reference</i> to any <em>P</em> in <em>O</em> </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where any <em>O</em> can be contained 1 to n times. In the sense of <em>GetReferencedName(E1) ===  GetReferencedName(E2)</em>...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a <em>Reference</em> to an <em>O</em>, where <em>O</em>.type = <em>[object Array]</em> and <em>O</em> is defined like <em>A</em></li>
<li>a circular <em>Reference</em> to any <em>E</em> in <em>A</em>  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let  <em>arrayCurr</em> be an <em>Array</em> of the same length as <em>arrayPrev</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Illustrated in the following example</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
    a:""A Property"",
    x:""24th Property"",
    obj: {
        a: ""A Property""
    },
    prim : 1,
}
x.obj.circ = x;

var y = {
    a:""A Property"",
    x:""24th Property"",
    obj: {
        a: ""A Property""
    },
    prim : 1,
}
y.obj.circ = y;
var z = {};

var a = [x,x,x,null,undefined,1,y,""2"",x,z]
var b = [z,x,x,y,undefined,1,null,""2"",x,x]    
console.log (sort(a),sort(b,a))
</code></pre>

<p><b>The Question is, how can i <em>efficiently</em> sort an <em>Array B</em>, such that any Reference to an Object or value of an Primitive, shares the <em>exact</em> same Position as in a Previously, by the <em>same</em> compareFunction, sorted, <em>Array A</em>.</b></p>

<p>Like the above example</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QRYoW.png"" alt=""Console Log""></p>

<p>Where the resulting array shall fall under the rules.</p>

<ul>
<li>Let <em>arrayPrev</em> contain the <i>Element</i>s' of <code>a</code> and <em>arrayCurr</em> contain the <i>Element</i>s' of <code>b</code>
<ol>
<li>Let <em>arrayPrev</em> be sorted by a <em>CompareFunction</em> *C*.</li>
<li>Let <em>arrayCurr</em> be sorted by the same <em>C</em>.
<ul>
<li>Let the result of sorting <em>arrayCur</em> be such, that when acessing an <em>E</em> in <em>arrayCur</em> at Position <em>n</em>, let <em>n</em> e.g be 5
<ul>
<li>if type of <em>E</em> is <em>Object</em> <i>GetReferencedName(arrayCurr[n])</i> === <i>GetReferencedName(arrayPrev[n])</i></li>
<li>if type of <em>E</em> is <em>Primitive</em> <i>GetValue(arrayCurr[n])</i> === <i>GetValue(arrayPrev[n])</i></li>
<li>i.e <code>b[n] === a[n]</code> e.g <code>b[5] === a[5]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meaning all <em>Elements</em> should be grouped by type, and in this sorted by value.</li>
<li>Where any call to a <em>Function</em> *F* in <em>C</em> shall be at least implemented before ES5, such that compatibility is given without the need of any shim.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>My current approach is to Mark the Objects in <em>arrayPrev</em> to sort them accordingly in <em>arrayCurr</em> and later delete the Marker again. But that seems rather not that efficient.

<p>Is there a means to do a what I want? I would not want to define the variables list as</p>

<pre><code>private ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, MyObject&gt; variables 
    = new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, MyObject&gt;(); // WORKS, BUT NOT NICE TO USE
</code></pre>

<p>So I want to use the specific lists to perform type specific operations, but also enable generic operations on all object types via the 'objects' dictionary, so that I don't need to code everything manually for each sub type. </p>

<p>For example, I would like to define a method like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public List&lt;Variable&gt; GetVariables()
    {
        return variables.Values.ToList();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So I could use Variable objects when I know that they are all variables.</p>

<p>The only thing I can figure out is that the button shows up BEFORE you save a new file. Once you save it, the button disappears. I've also tried updating RStudio, with no luck. Then I tried uninstalling/re-installing. Again, with no luck. </p>

<p>I have no idea what might have caused it to disappear since yesterday. I've been writing some code for one of my personal projects, but nothing crazy.</p>

<p>I'm running RStudio 0.98.977(now) on Win7. </p>

<p>This is really frustrating. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>edit: Also, I tried uploading a screenshot, but SO won't let. All of the file extensions are .R, so they SHOULD be interpreted correctly. Also, this behavior is consistent across all of my R scripts, including ones that previously worked correctly.</p>

       }

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway to do this better and more accurately? Specifically the biggest issue is removing any of the inconsistencies and if this code can be decoupled.</p>

<p>How can I get the correct messages to only show their attachments properly? How can I keep images in a card even when I scroll up or down? This also starts to get messy when I add new comments as well, because now there is an <code>N + 1</code> issue.</p>

<p>Specifically I am wondering if there is a better way to handle multiple <code>ViewHolders</code> rather trying to keep a handle on <code>offset</code> values for the <code>RecyclerView</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I was able to reduce some complexity in my adapter by using the following in the <code>Fragment</code> I am initializing my <code>RecyclerView.Adapter</code> in:</p>

<pre><code>public void setParentMessage(Message parentMessage) {
    this.mParentMessage = parentMessage;
    mAllMessages = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    mAllMessages.add(mParentMessage);
}

public void setMessages(List&lt;Messages&gt; messages) {
    this.mMessages = messages;
    mAllMessages.addAll(mMessages);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I just initialize my adapter on start:</p>

<pre><code>mMessageAdapter.setMessages(mAllMessages);
</code></pre>

<p>Then if I have to add a new <code>Message</code> object to my list I can simply do the following:</p>

<pre><code>public void addComment(Message message) {
    mMessageAdapter.addItem(mMessageAdapter.getItemCount(), message);
    mRecyclerView.scrollToPosition(mMessageAdapter.size() - 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside my <code>MessageAdapter</code> I have the following to add a new Message comment:</p>

<pre><code>public void addItem(int position, Message message) {
    mMessages.add(position, message);
    notifyItemInserted(position);
}
</code></pre>

<p>What this means is that I am able to change this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        if (mOriginalMessage != null &amp;&amp; mMessages != null) {
           if (!mMessages.isEmpty())
                return mMessages.size() + 1;
            else
                return 1;
        } else if (mMessages != null) {
            if (!mMessages.isEmpty())
                return mMessages.size();
        }
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        if (mMessages != null) {
            if (!mMessages.isEmpty())
                return mMessages.size();
        }
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And inside my <code>onBindViewHolder</code> method I do not need to keep track off offsets anymore, so this changes: </p>

<pre><code>Message message = mMessage.get(position - 1);
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>Message message = mMessage.get(position);
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore I decoupled <code>MessageViewHolder</code> into two separate <code>ViewHolder</code> classes:</p>

<pre><code>public class MessageHeaderViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {

        // Header
        private ImageView mHeaderImage;
        private TextView mHeaderShowTextView;

        // Variables for View
        private int mOriginalHeight = 0;
        private boolean mIsViewExpanded = false;

        private int mHolderId;

        public MessageHeaderViewHolder(View itemView, int viewType) {
            super(itemView);
            initHeaderViews(itemView);
        }

        private void initHeaderViews(View view) {
            mHeaderImage = (ImageView) view.findViewById(R.id.header_image);
            mHeaderShowTextView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.header_show_textview);
            mHeaderShowTextView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);

            if (!mIsViewExpanded) {
                mHeaderImage.setEnabled(false);
                mHeaderImage.setVisibility(View.GONE);
            }

            mHolderId = TYPE_MESSAGE_HEADER;
        }

        private void initOnClickListener() {
            itemView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                @Override
                public void onClick(View v) {
                    animate(v);
                }
            });
        }

        private void removeClickListener() {
            if (itemView.hasOnClickListeners())
            itemView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                @Override
                public void onClick(View v) {
                    // THIS CODE DOESN'T WORK AS THOUGHT.
                    // Empty click listener to keep itemSelectableBackground.
                }
            });
        }

        private void animate(View v) {
            // All animation code for header moved here
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Same thing for the other <code>ViewHolder</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class MessageCommentViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {

        // Comment
        private ImageView mMessageImage;
        private TextView mMessageShowTextView;

        // Variables for View
        private int mOriginalHeight = 0;
        private boolean mIsViewExpanded = false;

        private int mHolderId;

        public MessageCommentViewHolder(View itemView, int viewType) {
            super(itemView);
            initCommentViews(itemView);
        }

        private void initCommentViews(View view) {
            mMessageImage = (ImageView) view.findViewById(R.id.itemAttachmentImage);
            mMessageShowTextView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.showItemAttachment);
            mMessageShowTextView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);

            if (!mIsViewExpanded) {
                mMessageShowTextView.setText(""Show Attachment"");
                mMessageImage.setEnabled(false);
                mMessageImage.setVisibility(View.GONE);
            }

            mHolderId = TYPE_MESSAGE_COMMENT;
       }

        private void initOnClickListener() {
            itemView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                @Override
                public void onClick(View v) {
                    animate(v);
                }
            });
        }

        private void removeClickListener() {
            if (itemView.hasOnClickListeners())
            itemView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                @Override
                public void onClick(View v) {
                    // THIS CODE DOESN'T WORK AS THOUGHT.
                    // Empty click listener to keep itemSelectableBackground.
                }
            });
        }

        private void animate(View v) {
            // All animation code for header moved here
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>This means that inside my <code>onBindViewHolder</code> method I can do the following for each type of item (keep in mind there will be two types of <code>ViewHolder</code>s now so <code>messageViewHolder</code> would be changed to either <code>headerViewHolder</code> or <code>commentViewHolder</code> or something similar):</p>

<pre><code>if (message.getAttachment() != null) {
                    messageViewHolder.mMessageImage.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
                    messageViewHolder.mMessageShowTextView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
                    messageViewHolder.mMessageShowTextView.setText(""Show Attachment"");
                    String attachmentUrl = message.getAttachment().getImageUrl();
                    Picasso.with(mContext)
                            .load(attachmentUrl)
                            .into(messageViewHolder.mMessageImage);

                    messageViewHolder.initOnClickListener();
                } else {
                    messageViewHolder.removeClickListener();
                    messageViewHolder.mMessageImage.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                    messageViewholder.mMessageShowTextView.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                }
</code></pre>

<p>It is working fine now, although this is a very hacky solution, I plan to use doubleA's answer and make this code more optimized over this weekend. One problem that is still persisting is that some items will have <code>itemSelectableBackground</code> and be <code>clickable</code> while others are not, from my understanding <code>removeClickListener()</code> should initialize an empty <code>View.OnClickListener</code> thus making the item clickable therefore showing an <code>itemSelectableBackground</code> but this is not the case?? The <code>Log</code> output is saying I am initializing the listeners and images correctly.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12563152/jquery-simple-checkbox-to-hide-and-show-divs-product-filtering"">jQuery simple checkbox to hide and show divs (product filtering)</a> which was answered excellently by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/572939/manseuk"">ManseUK</a></p>

<p>ManseUK's solution enabled product filtering by a single category, specifically genre but for my current project I need to sort by 2 categories: colour and size. By modifying ManseUK's solution I nearly have it working but it fails when I have two filters selected - in this example selecting 'cyan' and 'xl' should only show the xl cyan but instead it shows both cyans instead of just the xl cyan. The code I'm using is as follows:</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""cyan"" value=""cyan"" /&gt; Cyan&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""magenta"" value=""magenta"" /&gt; Magenta&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""black"" value=""black"" /&gt; Black&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""xl"" value=""xl"" /&gt; XL&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;!---------------------&gt;
&lt;div class=""products""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""productItem"" data-price=""250"" data-category=""cyan""&gt;
        Cyan Ink
        &lt;div class=""productItemPrice""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;pound;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""productItem"" data-price=""150"" data-category=""magenta""&gt;
        Magenta Ink
        &lt;div class=""productItemPrice""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;pound;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""productItem"" data-price=""250"" data-category=""black""&gt;
        Black Ink        &lt;div class=""productItemPrice""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;pound;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""productItem"" data-price=""241"" data-category=""cyan"" data-size=""xl""&gt;
        XL Cyan Ink
        &lt;div class=""productItemPrice""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;pound;241&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!---------------------&gt;​
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.productItem{float:left;padding:5px;margin:5px;border:1px solid #eaeaea}
body{font-family:verdana}
</code></pre>

<p>JS:</p>

<pre><code>$('input[type=""checkbox""]').click(function() {
    if ($('input[type=""checkbox""]:checked').length &gt; 0) {
        $('.products &gt;div').hide();
        $('input[type=""checkbox""]:checked').each(function() {

        });
    } else {
        $('.products &gt;div').show();
    }
});​
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/NGy7D/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSFIDDLE of the above code</a></p>

<p>On localhost the next page is loaded without any problems, but on the server I get an error <code>405 - Method Not Allowed</code>.</p>

<p>I'm using a combination of react.js and laravel. My route for this kind of link is:</p>

<pre><code>post('pricing/{country}/{operation}/{page}', 'PricingController@getArticles');
</code></pre>

<p>I only know method not allowed errors from a <code>get request</code> to a <code>post</code> route, but that's not the case as ajax is performing a post call though there is some ""get data"" attached, and more important, it's working on localhost. Does somebody have an explanation for this and how could I solve it? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I solved it by adding a <code>get()</code> route. So here's my new question:</p>

<p>I have a SignalR set up where I have a struct I'm passing to the client each time the game board updates.</p>

<p>That object is:</p>



<pre><code>public struct updateModelMini
    {
        public bool isMatchupOver;
        public int Player1Wins;
        public int Player2Wins;
        public TimeSpan timeLeft;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>of which updateModelMini can be parsed on the client side like a JSON object:</p>

<pre><code>updateBoardModel.isMatchupOver
etc...
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I can't seem to recognize the ""parts"" of the System.Timespan object provided by .Net</p>

<p>Where</p>

<pre><code>updateModelMini.timeLeft.TimeLeft
</code></pre>

<p>returns: <strong>00:00:15</strong></p>

<pre><code>updateModelMini.timeLeft.TimeLeft.Seconds
</code></pre>

<p>...returns as <em>undefined</em></p>

<p>I'm sure there's a simple trick here to get the object exposed to the Hub and consequently the client, but I can't seem to find it via Google...</p>

<p>Do I need to create my own [public] object model to store the TimeSpan object? 
Anyone encountered this?</p>

<p>I'm don't understand libraries very well or the differences between x64 and x86 and whatever else there is, so this might be a complete stupidity on my part.</p>

<p>I've managed to mash together what I think will work to play audio from DirectSound, and I'm using the IDirectSoundBuffer8 structure which requires dsound3d.dll (can't even find this anywhere even on the internet, help?) and dsound.lib.  It compiles without errors.  I have dsound.lib from DirectX SDK and a dsound.dll that I found in my System32 folder (probably not the best solution), and I'm linking them from a folder off of my project's root directory called lib.  My linker line is:</p>

<p><code>g++-3 -s -Wall -O2 [object files] -I -l lib/dsound.lib lib/dsound.dll lib/gdi32.dll lib/D3D9.dll lib/d3dx9.dll lib/winmm.lib -o Voyager_dev.exe</code></p>

<p>And it returns:</p>

<p><code>lib/dsound.dll: file not recognized: File format not recognized</code></p>

<p>Without including lib/dsound.dll, I get a linker error for a missing function, so clearly I'm missing something.  Maybe I just need dsound3d.dll and dsound.dll is just unrelated and unfortunately named?  Is this how most people implement overlapping sounds?</p>

My problem is that when the filechannel reads the last few bytes it appends the last bit of data from previous bytes read even though I am clearing the byte buffer after I write.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>Byte Buffer size = 512 
For the last iteration, the remaining bytes to send is 372.
It reads the last 372 but it also appends another 140 bytes (512-372) to the end of it, and appears that last 140 bytes is from the previous 512 bytes sent.</p>

<p>Heres my code:</p>

<pre><code>ByteBuffer bBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(512);

while (fChannel.read(bBuffer) &gt; 0) {

    bBuffer.flip();
    datagramChannel.write(bBuffer);
    bBuffer.clear();

When clicking a button, a menu of options appears at the pointer position. Any following click, whether on a menu item or elsewhere in the browser, should close the menu. Clicking on a menu item closes the menu, but not clicking anywhere else. When I uncomment <code>$(document.body).one('click', function() {menu.remove()}</code> the menu never appears in the first place, and I suspect that I somehow have it arranged so that the click to bring up the menu actually closes the menu as well.

waiting
waiting 
(and so on, till connection is established)

Point 2
as it should.</p>

<p>Now after multiple hours of running, my client can still connect, it says connection established (done via clientSocket = new Socket(inetAddress,Integer.parseInt(port)); assumes connection established when this command succeeds without an exception).</p>

<p>After multiple hours of running Thread1 only prints ""waiting"", ""waiting"", no matter how often I connect with my client.
I'm stumped with it, because it happens only after multiple hours of running.  Java version is

Are there any known issues with this version or where can be the mistake? Any clues how to reproduce the error?</p>

I have been trying for a few days now trying to work around this problem but to no avail. I have been searching SO too but I don't even know if I am looking in the right place. The most simplified version of the problem as possible is below.</p>

<p>I have 2 tables, one is a many to many and the other has the data. </p>

<pre><code>--------a-------    ------------b-----------
| id | version |    | id  | version | external_ref |
|  1 |    1    |    |  1  |    1    |       9      |
|  1 |    2    |    |  1  |    2    |       8      |
|  1 |    3    |    |  1  |    3    |       7      |
|  2 |    1    |    |  2  |    1    |       5      |
|  2 |    2    |    |  2  |    2    |       6      |
       .                          .
       .                          .
       .                          .
</code></pre>

<p>This is my current (dramatically simplified) query to get the results:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM a 
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT MAX(Version) FROM a GROUP BY id
    ) j ON a.id = j.id AND a.version = j.version
    LEFT JOIN b ON a.id = b.id AND a.version = b.version
WHERE  (b.external_ref = 9 
    OR b.external_ref = 8 (ect)
 ) AND (a.id = 1 OR
       a.id = 2)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this query is that if <code>external_ref = 7</code> is not in the where clause then no row is being returned. </p>

<p>If I was looking at entries with only <code>external_ref</code> of 8, 9 or 5 then I would like to be able to get the following result</p>

<pre><code>| id | version |   data from table a    |
|  1 |    2    | some data from table a |
|  2 |    1    |   some more data       |
</code></pre>

<p>So how do I get the <code>MAX(version)</code> that meets the where clause?</p>

<p>The full query is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT `t`.`Version`, `t`.`TermID`, `t`.`Definition`, `t`.`Name` 
FROM `term` AS `t`
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT MAX(`Version`) version, `TermID`
    FROM `term`
    GROUP BY `termID`
) jj ON `t`.`TermID` = jj.`TermID` AND `t`.`Version` = jj.`Version`
LEFT JOIN `syllabusin` AS `si` ON `t`.`TermID` = `si`.`TermID` AND `t`.`Version` = `si`.`Version`
LEFT JOIN `synonyms` AS `sy` ON `t`.`TermID` = `sy`.`TermID`
WHERE
  (`si`.`SyllabusID` = 7  
   OR  `si`.`SyllabusID` = 6  
   OR  `si`.`SyllabusID` = 5  
   OR  `si`.`SyllabusID` = 4  
   OR  `si`.`SyllabusID` = 3  
   OR  `si`.`SyllabusID` = 2  
   OR  `si`.`SyllabusID` = 1  
   OR  `si`.`SyllabusID` = 8 )
AND (  `t`.`Name` LIKE '%term%'  
     OR  `t`.`Acronym` LIKE '%term%'  
     OR  `t`.`Definition` LIKE '%term%'  
     OR  `sy`.`Synonym` LIKE '%term%'  )    
</code></pre>

class AccountRecordServiceSpec extends Specification {

    def setup() {
    }

    def cleanup() {

        then:
            1 == AccRegStrDb.count()
        }
}

<p>My service looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Transactional
class AccountRecordService {
public void saveValue(Long accountId, String keyName, String value) {
        def test = new AccRegStrDb(

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>On test-app, my assertion fails because the object wasn't saved. No weird errors whatsoever. When I remove the <code>static mapping</code> in my class, the assertion passes. What could be wrong? Any help? </p>

        self.back_button.show()

        vendor_label = [self.hp_label, self.dell_label, self.ibm_label]
        vendor_label[vendor].show()

        country_widget = [self.hp_country_widget,self.dell_country_widget, self.ibm_country_widget]

</code></pre>

<p>This initializes the first page of QStackedWidget (vendors_widget) with three pushbuttons for choosing vendor. Then, it takes you to a new page of QStackedWidget (main_widget), which is shared by three vendors, except for the logo and the response when Add/Edit/Delete Country buttons are clicked. Clicking those buttons will open the 3rd, 4th or 5th page of QStackedWidget, depending on the current vendor selected.</p>

<p>I started doing it with a single class and multiple methods, but that's obviously adding some problems when trying to navigate between them (their button signals and properties should be initialized instead of called everytime). </p>

<p>Hope I made it clear enough. Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

<p>At first, I had written a generic parser that accepts ""rules"" which tell it how to parse commands.</p>

<p>For example, I set up a rule which dictates that the command code ""VER"" has a transaction id, and a list of arguments.</p>

<p>This worked ok, but it had always been an interim solution. My intention had been to make a fully fledged parser which looked at each command and argument individually.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<p>if command code is ""VER"" then create a VersionCommand class, passing it the transaction id along with the list of accepted protocols.</p>

<p>then my code can easily interpret the command without messing with parameter indexes and such (verCmd.TrId &amp; verCmd.AcceptedProtocols)</p>

<p>My concern is that it's wasteful of resources to use a separate class for each command type.</p>

<p>So my question is - is it wasteful? are there any other command based protocol implementations which take a similar approach? is there any precedent for what i want to do, or is it a moronic idea?</p>

However, I've become a little confused at the <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/setsid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">POSIX specification (setsid)</a> (along by Wikipedia's page on Process groups).</p>

<p>Our terminal layer sends SIGINT to the foreground process (group, whose id should equal the group leader's PID). In this case, that foreground process (our ""login"" application) becomes a group leader by calling <code>setsid</code>. When the user logs in, the program forks and executes the user's shell. At this stage, my understanding is that I call <code>setpgid</code> from the forked child before calling <code>exec*</code>. This means the executed program will be a part of the process group from the outset.</p>

<p>If I wanted to run the newly forked child outside the process group I would merely call <code>setsid</code> in the forked child before calling <code>exec*</code>.</p>

<p>Is this correct? Are there any really obscure things I should be checking or doing?</p>

<p>As a follow-on question, which I believe I already know, is it a requirement for <code>fork</code> to transfer group membership? Or is it something that must be done using <code>setpgid</code> after every <code>fork</code> call? I gather process groups are transferred by <code>fork</code> from the POSIX definition of <code>fork</code>.</p>

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

At run-time in dev-mode the Loader can't find a class called myapp.header.HeaderPanel. This is because no entry was created for that class at build-time in bootstrap.js. This strikes me as strange because 1) an empty alternate name mapping is created for that class and 2) that class is successfully pulled into ${buildDir}/testing/app.js. So clearly Sencha cmd is finding it ok.</p>

It seems like a good idea to use the information already stored in the POM files for configuring the issue tracker, so that - for example - issues can be assigned to specific maven modules (and are associated with the version given in the corresponding POM file etc.).</p>

<p>This would make the whole set-up process much easier.
Are there any issue trackers with specific support for 'importing' Maven project structures, maybe via additional plug-ins? </p>

<p>The Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">feature matrix on issue trackers</a> does not mention this, and I wonder if anyone here knows such tools?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
After looking for a while, I have not found anything. So, there is probably no tool like that yet, since even for issues trackers with many plugins, such as <a href=""http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira"" rel=""nofollow"">jira</a> or <a href=""http://trac.edgewall.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">trac</a>, no maven import plug-ins seem to exist. Maybe a Maven import is not as straightforward as it seems, or it is not worth the effort (even in the given case there is no simple 1:1 relation between Maven module and component for issue tracking, so it would only be useful for an initial configuration). </p>

    IPAC was designed as an open-source solution to ""what servers/devices are on the network right now."" It is designed
    to be a very simple, lightweight product to be one step up from spreadsheets as a CMDBs. This product is not meant
    to be a ""one-stop shop"" but a quick ""whats on the network.""
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Future iterations of this should have be able to have some ability to preform continuous monitoring, integrate with
    some common ticketing systems or larger change systems, and the intelligence to make suggestions to improve performance
    and capacity in a virtualized environment.

I have a question about destructors though, and for this I will supply my current code in hopes that someone could provide some clarification on what and how I should proceed.</p>

<p>I am writing a game in OpenGL and have created Three classes: Vector3D, Dimension3D, and Cuboid. My problem starts like this, my cuboid has an instance of both Vector3D and Dimension3D, which you will soon see. I need to know how (the exact routine) of what happens to my Cuboid class once it is flagged for deletion. Or more precisely, if i need to explicitly destroy both the Vector3D and Dimension3D instance when such an event occurs. I hope I articulated this question adequately enough.</p>

<p>How can I quickly and easily plot 3D data points in X Y Z format in C# Windows forms?
For example, I could have 5 data points:</p>

<pre><code>{ 1, 3, 4 },
{ 1, 2, 3 },
{ 2, 3, 3 },
{ 4, 4, 4 }, 
{ 4, 1, 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>How can I show this in 3D by adding the points one at a time?  I would like a working example.</p>

<p><strong>Lengthy / too much detail version:</strong></p>

<p>I've spent 15 minutes googlinghow to plot 3D points to a 3D engine to display them in C#, because I'm writing a program to create LED animations for my 4x4x4 cube. Not a single search result would show me how to do the task.</p>

<p>So far I have 64 Checkboxes, staggered to be slightly 3d. see here to see what I mean by <em>slightly</em>:  <a href=""http://imgur.com/kNSojFj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/kNSojFj</a> </p>

<p>Since it is not true 3D (it is the best I could do since discovering windows forms doesn't support transparency on check boxes or image/layers), I want to have a real 3D engine re-generate the points so I can see the lights come up. (If you have a suggestion on how to make the 3D checkboxes more 3D like, I would love to hear it.  I used Gimp to create the 3D grid with different colors for each Z-axis layer.</p>

<p>Right now I have the IDs 1 through 64, but if I can plot points like {1, 3, 4}, {4, 3, 4} on a X Y Z plane, then I can rewrite the loop to write a lookup array or similar for each check that is checked.</p>

<p>Here's the Query I have....</p>

<pre><code>$query = ""SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_type = 'Christmas Listings' AND event_active='Yes' ORDER BY event_date ASC LIMIT 5"";
$result= mysql_query($query); 
</code></pre>

<p>OK... now for the plain english bit on what I want to achieve (to understand what I'm trying to achieve):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I want to check the event type ('<code>event_type</code>') is what I'm getting (ie. Christmas Listings) as there are multiple types in this column.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to check the event is active ('<code>event_active</code>') is Yes(the data in this field is Yes/No).</p></li>
<li><p>I want to order them by the ('<code>event_date</code>') ASC (the data in this field is <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code>) so they show the latest entry by its date from the DB.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to LIMIT (or in some way control the output) the results to only have 5 results displayed when running this kind of query through a WHILE statement.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>OK, this all works BUT; when I get to the actual output display, i'm having a shaky output in how many results are actually display... What happens is if I have multiple events which are switched off, as in <code>event_active</code> is '<code>Off</code>' then its almost like the argument is counting from the all the results that are (including <code>event_active='Off'</code>) and consequently not showing how I expect them to display?</p>

<p>Hope this makes sense.... Any help would be gratefully received.</p>

However, as per my new requirements, I'd to increase the length of the vector to <code>size: 14</code>.</p>

<p>The new items that were to be added had to be from the previous <code>6</code> <code>Points</code>, so instead of allocating new memory, I thought of just using the previous pointers as follows:</p>

<pre><code>while (currentSize &lt; 14){
  int rndPoint = getRandomPoint(0, 5); //random index to choose from the vector
  points-&gt;push_back(points[randPoint]);
}

<p>In the destructor of the class, when I've to deallocate the memory, I'm doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0;i&lt;points.size(); ++i){
  if(points[i] != NULL){
    delete (points[i]);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to exit the program - I'm getting an access violation error in the loop (specifically when <code>i</code> reaches index <code>6</code>). When I've already deleted the 6 unique points by using <code>delete</code>, why is the condition <code>if (points[i] != NULL)</code> resulting in <code>true</code> for <code>i=6,7...13</code>?</p>

The one issue that I ran into while implementing these techniques is when a user refreshes a page or navigates to another page causing a new request, the comet connection is kept open from the old page. My server (tornado) never receives a connection close and from my limited wireshark abilities I don't see any TCP fin packet sent. However, when I close the the browser, the sockets are closed at that point.</p>

<p>These abandoned open connections are just using up memory on the server side for no good reason. Also it causes problems when the server sends some message to the open socket and IE then correctly displays an error message: ""Can't execute code from a freed script"". So IE is trying to execute code on the old window which was navigated away from. How are other people handling this issue? Should I use onbeforeunload to somehow close the connection?</p>

But I have a webmethod that takes in a 'byte[]' parameter. I am running into '500 internal server error' when I try to call it. Here is some example of what I am doing.</p>

<p>Lets say my method is like this</p>

<pre><code>[WebMethod]
public string TestMethod(string a)
{
    return a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I call it like this using HttpRequest in C#</p>

<pre><code>            HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
            req.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
            req.Method = ""POST"";
            // Set the content type of the data being posted.
            req.ContentType = ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"";

            string inputData = ""sample webservice"";
            string postData = ""a="" + inputData;
            ASCIIEncoding encoding = new ASCIIEncoding();
            byte[] byte1 = encoding.GetBytes(postData);

            using (HttpWebResponse res = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse())
            {
                StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(res.GetResponseStream());
                string txtOutput = sr.ReadToEnd();
                Console.WriteLine(sr.ReadToEnd());
            }
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfectly fine. Now I have another webmethod that is defined like this</p>

<pre><code>[WebMethod]
public string UploadFile(byte[] data)
</code></pre>

<p>I tried calling it like this</p>

<pre><code>            ASCIIEncoding encoding = new ASCIIEncoding();
            string postData = ""data=abc"";
            byte[] sendBytes = encoding.GetBytes(postData);
            req.ContentLength = sendBytes.Length;
            Stream newStream = req.GetRequestStream();
            newStream.Write(sendBytes, 0, sendBytes.Length);

In their software they include a Windows 32 dll, wrappers for Excel and some other window program wrappers, a GUI program that uses their dll, and the Fortran source code. I work on Linux so I recompiled the source and linked it to my wrapper functions and included some of my own functions for unit conversion. The Fortran source code has no licensing info in the code at all. What I wanted to do was to release my wrapper, along with their source code, as a GPL project so engineers could use a non-windows version of the library. I could ask NIST but, from past dealings with the government, they always say NO even if the answer is YES. I know some people who know some people at NIST which could find out, but I didn't want to make any waves unless I knew I had a chance. </p>

<p>Personally, I don't think it can be done just for the fact that not putting a licensing on something doesn't mean that it's open source ... or does it?</p>

<p>As I want ""shortcuts"", I followed the following guide: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/19197130/2897090"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/19197130/2897090</a> . But when my Java method has variable arguments, I'm not able to ""expose"" the method to use with javascript language.</p>

<pre><code>public void printf(String format, Object... args) {
    out.printf(format, args);
}
//Gives org.mozilla.javascript.EvaluatorException: Unsupported parameter type ""[Ljava.lang.Object;"" in method printf

<p>Other thing:</p>

<p>If i try to make a ""shortcut to the <code>printf</code> using just ""javascript"":</p>

<pre><code>function printf(format){
    java.lang.System.out.printf(format, arguments);
}

<p>If I type anything, I get <code>org.mozilla.javascript.Arguments@NNNNNN</code>. How to fix that?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>As I didn't find any solution, I changed the approach: now I'm just using the ScriptEngine. Practically what I'm doing is exposing the whole object (not just functions). Unfortunately every time that I need to call a function I need to prefix it with the name of the object that I've exposed.</p>

<p>Anyway, with that I could create my Java methods with variable arguments and use them without any modification on the JavaScript side.</p>

"26317211","1","","","2014-10-11 17:18:42","","1","216","<p>I'm working on a project that needs to create a XML with certain data on a certain format, send it to a third-party service, and then process the result. The third-party's function here is to validate both the data and the format of the XML, and then create a codified string (a ""stamp"") certifying everything complies with the requeriments. This stamp has then to be added to the original XML and stored on database.</p>

<p>Now, the third-party is still to be chosen, so I have to create my project in a way it can work with (so far) two different web services before release, with the chance of adding another one and, after release, changing the chosen one. Although the final result is the same (the ""stamping"" of the XML) each web service does things differently e.g. one returns only the stamp string, while the other returns the XML with the stamp included, and the pending one returns the byte array of a zip file containing the XML (I don't know who told them that was a good idea, but meh, that's another story)</p>

<p>With this in mind, I decided to create a static class that wraps the web service calls (one method per web service). All these methods receive the XML and return either the ""stamped"" XML or an XML with an error code and message in case something went wrong. The class that handles the data has then only to create the required XML, call one of these methods, and process the result.</p>

<p>So far it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class EDocument
{
    //This class handles all the data that will be included in the XML

    public void Stamp()
    {
        //Here the XML string is created, sent to the correspondig third-party web service, and processed back

        string xmlString;
        //code to create the XML
        //...

        //If needed, I only have to change this line to call the corresponding method
        WebServiceCalls.MainWebServiceCall stamper = WebServiceCalls.FirstServiceCall;
        stamper.BeginInvoke(xmlString, StampCallback, null);
    }

    public void StampCallback(IAsyncResult ar)
    {
        AsyncResult result = (AsyncResult)ar;
        WebServiceCalls.MainWebServiceCall caller = (WebServiceCalls.MainWebServiceCall)result.AsyncDelegate;
        string response = caller.EndInvoke(ar);
        //Call another async method to save to database the stamp, create the XML file, e-mail and store it, and notify the results...
        //or create the exception with the error details and raise event here to notify the error
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Web service calls...</p>

<pre><code>public static class WebServiceCalls
{
    //Here I'll put the necessary web service calls. In the end there will be only one,
    //but if on future the web service changes, a method with the same signature will be created here
    //replacing the previous one

    public delegate string MainWebServiceCall(string XmlData);

    public static string FirstServiceCall(string XmlData)
    {
        FirstWebService firstWs = new FirstWebService();
        string serviceResult = firstWs.Stamp(XmlData); //This returns only the stamp string
        //Check the result, add the stamp to the original XML or create the error XML, and return...
        return serviceResult;
    }

    public static string SecondServiceCall(string XmlData)
    {
        SecondWebService secondWs = new SecondWebService();
        string serviceResult = secondWs.Stamp(XmlData); //This returns the XML with the stamp already added
        //Check the result, create the error XML if something went wrong, and return...
        return serviceResult;
    }

    public static string ThirdServiceCall(string XmlData)
    {
        ThirdWebService thirdWs = new ThirdWebService();
        string serviceResultString;
        byte[] serviceResult = thirdWs.Stamp(XmlData); //This (sigh) returns the byte array of a ZIP file...
        //Unzip the file, check the result, create the corresponding XML and return...
        return serviceResultString;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But then it hit me...</strong> Althought I'll be calling the wrapper methods asynchronously, the web service method will still be called synchronously. </p>

<p>Question is: what are the disadvantages of this? should I instead call the web service asynchronously on every caller method, handle the callback, raise the notifying event, catch it on the Edocument class, process the result and raise it's corresponding event? Wouldn't this be making things over-complicated considering the possible future changes this project could have?</p>

<p>Or is this overall a wrong approach of the problem?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this is C# 4.0, so (sadly) async-await is out of scope.</p>

expected speed up is 1, since the task is simple. This is what I get:</p>

<p>I tried to bind the field using direct assigment and worked well. </p>

<pre><code>objectInstance.""$paramsFieldName"" = convertToType( fieldType.name,paramsValue)
</code></pre>

<p>but then I need to handle the type conversion for each case (I assume). What I need is the BindDynamicMethod handles the binding for me. What happens to the object when binding it using the BindDynamicMethod that makes is immutable?. Or what am I doing wrong that is causing it?</p>

<p>=========================================================</p>

<h1>PARTIALLY SOLVED</h1>

<p>It turned out that this was happening on some of the domains, but some that were using cache on their mapping was throwing this exception. </p>

<pre><code>class UploadSettings {
    String profile = ""default""
    String displayName
    String name 
    String value 
    String defaultValue 

    static mapping = {
        //cache usage:'read-only'

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess now my question is if a domain is using cache , why cant we update its value? Or how can we do that?  Is there a way to capture if the domain is immutable?</p>

<p>I am trying to get it working like this so that it automatically submits the form when a checkbox or radio is checked/ticked.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type""text/javascript""&gt;
$("":checkbox"").click(function() {
  $(this).closest(""form"").submit();

$("":radio"").click(function() {
  $(this).closest(""form"").submit();
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but absolutely nothing happens when it's clicked. I am thinking it may be because the actual checkbox is replaced with a styled span by prettycheckable. How do I catch that ""click"" anyways?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type""text/javascript""&gt;
$("":checkbox"").on('change', function() {
  $(this).closest(""form"").submit();
});
&lt;/script&gt;

Basically, I want to minify all JS files in a directory using UglifyJS. Following this, I would like to use a versioning plugin (in this case grunt-static-versioning) to achieve cache busting.</p>

<p>My gruntfile is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = function(grunt) {
grunt.initConfig({
  clean: ['dest/js'],
  uglify: {
    options: {
      report: 'min',
      mangle: true
    },
    my_target: {
      files: [{
      expand: true,
      cwd: 'src/js',
      src: '**/*.js',
      dest: 'dest/js'
      }]
    }
  },
  cssmin: {
    options: {
    report:'min'
    },
    minify: {
        expand:true,
    cwd: 'src/css',
    src: '**/*.css',
    dest: 'dest/css',
    }
  },
  imagemin: {
    dynamic: {
      options: {
        optimizationLevel: 7
      },
      files: [{
        expand:true,
        cwd: 'src/assets',
        src: ['**/*.{png,jpg,gif}'],
        dest: 'dest/assets'
      }]
    }
  },
  htmlmin: {
    mini :{
      options: {
        removeComments: true,
        collapseWhitespace: true,
        collapseBooleanAttributes: true,
        removeAttributeQuotes: true,
        removeRedundantAttributes: true,
        removeEmptyAttributes: true,
        useShortDoctype: true
      },
      files: [{
        expand:true,
        cwd: 'src',
        src: '**/*.html',
        dest: 'dest'
      }]
    }
  },
  versioning: {               // Task
    options: {                // Task options
      cwd: ''
    },

        dest: 'dest/js',
        type: 'js',
        ext: '.js'
      }]
    }
  }
});

grunt.registerTask('default', ['clean', 'uglify', 'cssmin', 'imagemin', 'htmlmin', 'versioning']);}
</code></pre>

<p>However, upon execution I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Running ""versioning:dist"" (versioning) task
Warning: Unable to read ""dest/js"" file (Error code: EISDIR). Use --force to continue.
</code></pre>

<p>I understand this error occurs because dest/js is not a file but a directory, but I don't know how to tell version the correct file names. Is there a particular Grunt JS format to do this?</p>

<li>has a value</li>
<li>that value is a 10 digit number</li>

<p>I'm trying to use RegEx to do so. Here is what I have so far. </p>

<pre><code>var reg = new RegExp(""/[0-9]{10}/"");

       if ($(""#call_number"").val().length &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; reg.test($(""#call_number"").val())) {

<p>I know the problem has to do witht he RegExp as if I remove this portion of the code it validates that the box has a value.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Here is the final regex I'm using </p>

<pre><code>var regEx = new RegExp(""/[0-9]/"");

$(""#call_form"").bind(""submit"", function() {

    if ($(""#call_number"").val().length != 10 &amp;&amp; !$(""#call_number"").val().match(regEx)) {
        $(""#call_error"").show();
        $.fancybox.resize();
        return false;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>
Using the suggestions here is what i'm usign which allows spaces and dashes that then get stripped on check</p>

<pre><code>    $(""#call_form"").bind(""submit"", function() {
var Phone = $(""#call_number"").val().replace(/\D+/g,'');

if (Phone.length != 10) {
        $(""#call_error"").show();

I added a splash screen to my project.
First the launch image is shown, than my localized splash screen is shown for 2 seconds, fading to my first screen.</p>

<p>When installalling directly form Xcode on my device, everything works okay.
When I build an ipa archive and distribute via TestFlight, after install on the same device, the splash screen isn't shown: immediately after launch image my first screen appears.</p>

<p>My device is a iPhone 4S, with iOS 6.0.1.
Deployment target is set to 5.0 and I use Xcode 4.5.2.</p>

<p>Code for splash screen at the bottom of my didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</p>

<pre><code>// Splash screen
UIImageView*imageView=[[UIImageView alloc]initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:NSLocalizedString(@""Splash_NL.PNG"", @""Bestandsnaam splash screen"")]];
imageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill;
imageView.frame = self.window.bounds;
[[navigationController view] addSubview:imageView];
[[navigationController view] bringSubviewToFront:imageView];

// as usual
[self.window makeKeyAndVisible];

// korte pauze, dan fade out
[self performSelector:@selector(_fadeSplash:) withObject:imageView afterDelay:1.0];
</code></pre>

<p>and after that</p>

<pre><code>- (void) _fadeSplash:(UIView *)view
{
[UIView transitionWithView:self.window duration:2.0f options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionNone animations:^(void){view.alpha=0.0f;} completion:^(BOOL finished){[view removeFromSuperview];}];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any help is appreciated; I'm lost/desperate...</p>

<p>From this you can see that the ticket object is always there, whereas the employee and user objects are each optional. What I'd like to do is loop through them and organize them like so:</p>

<pre><code>array(

        [0] =&gt; object //ticket,

<p>What I'm having trouble with is since the user and employee are optional I'm not sure how to correctly index based on the above model since occasionally I will hit one that doesn't have an employee or user (in the case that it doesn't, I'd want that index to be null). Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Example:</p>

<pre><code>for ($i = 0; $i &lt; count($result); $i++) {

Inside that class I have a method that takes arguments of those types, makes a tuple of them and stores them in a vector. What I want is to use perfect forwarding to avoid unnecessary copies. I solved it by prefixing the method with another variadic template and I forward these new types instead of old ones, but I wonder if there is a better way.</p>

<p>Let me show you an example of my code:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename ... Tlist&gt;
class A{
public:
    template&lt;typename ... Xlist&gt;
    void method(Xlist &amp;&amp; ... plist){
        // some code 
        std::vector&lt;std::tuple&lt;Tlist...&gt;&gt; vec;
        vec.push_back(std::make_tuple(std::forward&lt;Xlist&gt;(plist)...));
        // some other code
    }

};
</code></pre>

<p>This works with correct types and it doesn't compile with incorrect types anyway so I guess it's ok. But what I'd like is to somehow use the <code>Tlist</code> types in method header, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename ... Tlist&gt;
class A{
public:
    void method(Tlist &amp;&amp; ... plist){
        // some code 
        std::vector&lt;std::tuple&lt;Tlist...&gt;&gt; vec;
        vec.push_back(std::make_tuple(std::forward&lt;Tlist&gt;(plist)...));
        // some other code
    }

};
</code></pre>

<p>But that only works with rvalues.</p>

<p>So is there a way to avoid using another template while still making perfect forwarding possible?</p>

<p>I think that each column of 128dimension represents a single image feature or a single patch detected from the image. So in the case of 128x18, we have extracted 18 patches and described them with 128 values each. If this is correct, why cant we have a fixed numbers of patches per image, say 20 patches, so every time our matrixes would be 128x20.</p>

The layers might be shifted relative to each other, and each frame only a small (rectangular) part of each layer may change. However, the width and height of that rectangular part may vary unpredictably.
I would like to use one canvas (2D) and one texture per layer, and each frame redraw on each canvas only the part of the layer that has been modified, then simply upload that small area to the GPU to update the corresponding part to texture, before the GPU makes the compositing for me. However I have not found an efficient way to upload just a part of an image to a part of a texture. It seems that <code>texSubImage2D()</code> <em>can</em> update a part of a texture, but only takes full images/canvases, and it does not seem to be possible to specify a rectangular area of the image to use.</p>

<p>I have thought of a few ways of doing this, but each seems to have obvious overhead:</p>

<ul>
<li>use <code>getImageData()</code> + <code>texSubImage2D()</code> to only upload to the GPU the part that changes (overhead in converting the canvas pixel data to ImageData)</li>
<li>re-upload the whole layer canvas each frame with <code>texImage2D()</code></li>
<li>or create/resize a small canvas2D to the correct dimension to fit perfectly for each layer modification, then use <code>texSubImage2D()</code> to send it to update the related texture (memory reservation overhead)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, is there a way to specify a part of an image/a canvas for the texture ? Something like <code>texImagePart2D()</code> and <code>texSubImagePart2D</code>, which would both accept four more parameters, <code>sourceX</code>, <code>sourceY</code>, <code>sourceWidth</code> and <code>sourceHeight</code> to specify the rect area of the image/canvas to use ?</p>

    val p = Promise[T]

    funToCall(callbacklistener)
    resultFuture
  }

<p>And restructure the onComplete as:</p>

<pre><code> onComplete(OnCompleteFutureMagnet(callback2Future(archiveService.getByHash(ZeroHash, _: Option[DocumentRef] =&gt; Unit)))) {
          case Success(docRef) =&gt; {
...
}

<p>In the original implementation with callservice, it works great (with great throughput too), with the <code>callback2Future</code> implementation I get a forever wait and it eventually times out. They seem the same to me, can anyone spot the error?</p>

<p>after searching google for foreign key constraint, I have just learned that the word 'foreign key constraint' indicates that data from foreign key column in the table <code>course</code> must exist in primary key column in the table <code>department</code>. But I should have met this error when inserting data.   </p>

<p>If not, why does author make me execute that SQL statement? </p>

<p>If I really execute erroneous SQL statement, Does I have to designate <code>dept_name</code> in course table as foreign key after inserting some data?</p>

<p>So far, I managed to support <code>Point</code> and <code>LineString</code> objects in the integrated MongoDB database in the way that it is translated to into the BSON from the Opa type as correct GeoJSON and is used properly used by the Leaflet JS.</p>

<p>The problem is that the JSON field <code>coordinates</code> have different type for different geometric objects. It is position (array of numbers) for points or array of positions (array of array of numbers) for string, array of array of points (array of array of array of numbers) for <code>MultiLineStrings</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{ type: ""Point"", coordinates: [102.0, 0.5] }
{ type: ""LineString"", ""coordinates"": [[102.0, 0.0], [103.0, 1.0]] }
...
</code></pre>

<p>For this reason I can not rely on <code>type</code> field to distinguish geometric objects. According to <a href=""https://github.com/MLstate/opalang/wiki/The-type-system#sum-type"" rel=""nofollow"">Opa documentation</a>: ""if several cases (i.e. records) of a sum share a same label, this label must have the same type in each cases."" So, I can not just add the fields <code>Point</code> and <code>LineString</code> which will distinguish record types. I have to use sum type with different types embedded :</p>

<pre><code>type Article.geo_json_point =
  {
    string `type`,
    list(float) coordinates,
  };
type Article.geo_json_multipoint =
  {
    string `type`,
    list(list(float)) coordinates,
  };
type Article.geo_json =
  { Article.geo_json_point Point } or
  { Article.geo_json_multipoint LineString } or
  { Null };

type Article.t = {
  Article.id id,
  Article.geo_json location,
  ... // some other fields
};
database mydb {
  Article.t /article[{id}]
  /article[_]/location = {Null}
  /article[_]/location/Point/`type` = ""Point""
  /article[_]/location/LineString/`type` = ""LineString""
}
</code></pre>

<p>According to MongoDB <a href=""http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/2dsphere/"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> you can create only one geospatial index per collection. In this case I can correctly store GeoJSON which can be indexed:</p>

<pre><code>$ mongo mydb
&gt; db.article.findOne({}, {_id:0, location:1})
{
    ""location"" : {
            ""Point"" : {
                    ""type"" : ""Point"",
                    ""coordinates"" : [
                            18.089788,
                            51.762638
                    ]
            }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but I can index either <code>location.Point</code> or <code>location.LineString</code> but not both...</p>

<p>How to properly do geospatial inxeding of GeoJSON data in Opa? Is it possible with its DB interface and type system, or is it too limiting? I appreciate any help or advice!</p>

<p>Now for, obvious reasons, GCC is giving me a warning (<em>comparison is always false due to limited range of data type</em>) when this code is compiled for an unsigned type.  I fully understand the reasoning behind this and I put in the numeric_limits check to see if I could get the compiler to shut up about it (it worked for MSVC).  Alas under GCC I get the warning.  Is there any way (short of disabling the warning which I don't even know if you can do with GCC) to fix this warning?  The code will never get called anyway and I would assume the optimiser will compile it out as well but I can't get rid of the warning.</p>

<p>Can someone give me a solution to this?</p>

{
    Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(width, height);

    using (Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap))

        graphics.DrawImage(source, new Rectangle(0, 0, width, height));
    }

    return bitmap;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output image quality is terrible bad. Is there a way to resize the image without messing up the quality?</p>

<p>PS: the image source width and height is always bigger than the width and height parameters and the width and height ratio is being preserved.</p>

I tried to set every payslip <code>DIV</code> in a fixed height,</p>

<pre><code>width: 175.6mm;
height:123.7mm;
margin-left:auto;
margin-right:auto;
</code></pre>

<p>Although it fit the payslip size perfectly,but after printed,the paper will keep rolling until end of it because payslip paper are all joined unlike A4. 
And I do not wish to make any changes to printer paper size,so I set:</p>

<pre><code>@media print 
{
   @page
   {
    size: 8.5in 5.5in;
    size: portrait;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but the print preview of Google Chrome still showing this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2T6J.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Actually is it possible to do so?Or is there any way to force printer stop printing after payslip printed to prevent it from keep rolling the paper?(which I think should be not possible)</p>

<p>P.S. I am using Google Chrome only.</p>

<p>**Updated:</p>

<p>I noticed the paper size will change after I choose to ""Save as PDF"",if I choose back my default printer,the paper size is incorrect again.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

void exploreSet(std::set&lt;int&gt; &amp;int_set, int key);

int main()

    exploreSet(int_set, 15);
    exploreSet(int_set, 4);
    return 0;
}


void exploreSet(std::set&lt;int&gt; &amp;int_set, int key)
{
    auto it = int_set.upper_bound(key);
    if ( it==int_set.end() )
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Nothing found.\n"";
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Found "" &lt;&lt; *it &lt;&lt; "".\n"";
        // Now find the next lowest value -- how?
        auto it_back = it;
        --it_back;
        if ( it_back==int_set.end() )
        {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Nothing prior.\n"";

        else

<p>This is the best way I've found to modify form's fields at runtime.  It seems a bit like hacking the implementation.  What's the well-defined way to do that?</p>

Sorting works fine with this code, but I don't get expected text:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(0, self.rows):
    item = QtGui.QTableWidgetItem()
    item.setData(Qt.DisplayRole, ""Row: %s"" %(i) )

<p>I get: 1,2,3,4... instead of  Row: 1, Row: 2, Row: 3...
I expected that EditRole will be used for editing purposes (for numerical sorting, which works fine) but I also expected that text will be shown because it was set with DisplayRole.
Can I do this that way somehow or writing function for purposes of sorting is the only way?</p>

<p>I have a VisualSVN server set up with my repositories and cruisecontrol setup to poll the server and run the build scripts when ever there is a modification.</p>

<p>Since it is only me working on this project (it's my final year project as part of my degree) I don't think CC needs to poll the Server very often as only I will be checking in modifications.</p>

<p>So what I want is for VisualSVN to call the Force Build method of CruiseControl with a post-commit hook. This way I know the build will be run everytime I commit a change.</p>

<p>Both VisualSVN and CC are running on the same server if that makes a difference.</p>

But in both cases, I'm running into a problem in that they seem to want me to compromise the integrity of my domain model in various ways, especially on finer points of C# object design. This is one of several questions on the subject.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am very used to enforcing immutability on appropriate properties with a pattern that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
    private readonly string bar;
    public string Bar { return this.bar; }

    public Foo(string bar)
    {
        this.bar = bar;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does not appear to be supported by NHibernate or Entity Framework. They want default constructors and <code>public</code> setters; it appears even <code>private</code> setters (and default constructors) work (sometimes?) because the ORMs can use reflection.</p>

<p>I suppose I can get around these by using <code>private</code> setters and a <code>private</code> default constructor. At least then the public API is not compromised. It is just that I am modifying all of my classes' implementations to add unused <code>private</code> constructors, and having to trust future-Domenic that he understands <code>private</code> on my setters really means ""don't call me except in the constructor."" The persistence layer is leaking into my domain object design.</p>

<p>It also just seems unnecessary---why can't the ORM know to use the non-default constructor? Maybe they are able to, and I just didn't find the right blog post explaining how.</p>

<p>Finally, in some cases my <em>immutable value objects</em> actually fit well as (immutable) <em>value types</em>, i.e. <code>struct</code>s. My guess is that this is possible, since in the database the fields of my struct will show up in the same row that the parent entity is stored. Can you confirm/deny? <a href=""http://geekswithblogs.net/opiesblog/archive/2006/08/05/87218.aspx"">This blog post</a> looks promising in that it gives an affirmative answer, but the amount of code (which is in fact specific to the value type in question) staggers the mind.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is frustrating that after several years reading books like <em>Effective C#</em> or blogs like those of Eric Lippert, which give great advice on how to design expressive and bulletproof C# objects, the need to use ORMs is making me throw much of that knowledge out of the window. I am hoping that someone here can point out where I am wrong, either in my grasp of their capabilities or in my thinking about domain modeling and the role of ORMs.</p>

<p>Yet, running the same query without the <code>COUNT(*) AS total</code> field results in the expected 6 results.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest why this happens, and how I might fix it?</p>

<p>As a post-script to the above, the following works fine:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Count(*) 
       AS 
       total, 
       ( 3959 * Acos(Cos(Radians(53.18335000)) * Cos(Radians(lat)) * Cos( 
                                   Radians(lng) - Radians(-0.29600000)) + 
                              Sin(Radians(53.18335000)) * Sin(Radians(lat))) ) 
       AS 
       distance 
FROM   wv_venue_locations 
WHERE  lat &gt;= 52.64017900
       AND lat &lt;= 53.72650900
       AND lng &gt;= -0.94998000
       AND lng &lt;= 0.35798000
</code></pre>

<p>The above correctly outputs:</p>

<pre><code>+-------+-------------------+
| total | distance          |
+-------+-------------------+
| 224   | 27.93840157954865 |

Each request returns a Future so in order to do this I see 2 options: using a <code>Future[Either]</code> or using exceptions to fail the future immediately. </p>

<p>Here is a snippet with both situations, <code>response</code> is a future with the return of the HTTP request:</p>

<pre><code>  def handleRequestEither: Future[Either[String, String]] = {
    response.map {
      case ""good_string"" =&gt; Right(""Success"")
      case _ =&gt; Left(""Failed"")

  def handleRequest: Future[String] = {
    response.map {
      case ""good_string"" =&gt; ""Success""
      case _ =&gt; throw new Exception(""Failed"")
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the snippet to get the result in both cases:</p>

<pre><code>handleRequestEither.onComplete {
  case Success(res) =&gt;
    res match {
      case Right(rightRes) =&gt; println(s""Success $res"")
      case Left(leftRes) =&gt; println(s""Failure $res"")

  case Failure(ex) =&gt;

handleRequest.onComplete {

  case Failure(ex) =&gt; println(s""Failure $ex"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't like to use exceptions, but using <code>Future[Either]</code> makes it much more verbose to get the response afterwards, and if I want to map the result into another object it gets even more complicated. Is this the way to go, or are there better alternatives?</p>

"22781127","1","","","2014-04-01 08:57:09","","6","224","<p>I'm just approaching Android Services, but i have many doubts. Here there are some questions.
Before starting, notice i have read those pages
<a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html"">Android Services (official)</a>
<a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html"">Bounded Services (official)</a>
plus sone Inner classes theory in my language. Please be patient, i'm still a bit confused.</p>

<p>1) First of all, a Services differentiates itself from an AsyncTask mainly because it continues to run also if the app is paused (i.e. the user is watching another app); AsyncTask is stopped in that cases. Is it ok or am i wrong?
2) A Service runs in the same thread of the activity that started it through startService().
To not affect the Activity's performances, i have to create a separate thread for that Service, for example implementing the Runnable interface. Another method is making a service that extends IntentService, which automatically provides a new thread for the service: a new thread is created on any onHandleIntent() call.</p>

<p>Now, let's look at my concrete problem. I need to create a Service that will be used by many Activities: his task will be to connect to the server DB every 60 seconds and check for news. If a news is found, notify there's a new news (if we are on MainActivity) or show the new news's title (if we are in the news reader). How should i code it?
I have made a MainActivity that instantiate a NewsService and immediately calls startService(). On the other side, i have the NewsService extends IntentService, that (creates a new thread when onHandleIntent is called?) and looks for new news. Is it a bad idea to use a IntentService? I realized it will be very ugly to start the service calling startService() indefinitely.
At the start of this exercize i tought it was a good solution because it automatically creates a new thread and makes Service implementation simple. But now i have some doubts (i can't know if there's a news! How can MainActivity know it? And how to get the title)</p>

<p>This should be done with a normal extends Thread class, that makes an infinite cicle in it's run() method, checking for news every 60 seconds and, if there's a new one, reads the title from remote DB AND update activities buttons/views. Then if the App will be closed by user, the Service will be closed too.
But the problem is that if i istantiate such class it's work will be stopped when the MainActivity is paused or stopped, and other Activities (the NewsReader in this case) cannot get any update because the new thread isn't getting news at the moment. So i need a Service.</p>

<p>I hope it's clear. How should i implement a solution in the right way?
Please highlight everything wrong in my text, i really need to learn :D</p>

Each thread performs some data IO operation using Core Data.  I'm trying to come up with a simple and elegant solution to simplify the merging process.</p>

<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>

<p>My app uses what I refer to as an <em>engine</em>.  My app may have many engines.  Each engine runs in a continuous interval each with a specific goal: Clean up, fetching and merging RSS, fetching and merging theme changes, fetching and merging documents.  Each engine runs in its own thread, each with its own managed object context.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Rather than observing <code>NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification</code> in each of the engines, I came up with the idea to derive from the <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> class and have <strong><em>IT</em></strong> observe/merge the changes.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of any gotchas or issues surrounding this method?</p>

<p>Here is a <strong><em>rough</em></strong> example of what it might look like:</p>

<p><em><strong>.h</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>@interface SelfMergingManagedObjectContext : NSManagedObjctContext
@end
</code></pre>

<p><em><strong>.m</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>@interface SelfMergingManagedObjectContext()

So far I can see that the framework does not handle model changes easily: whenever I want to add another field to a class/table, framework drops the entire database and creates it from the scratch. </p>

<p>Similar behaviour I saw in (N)Hibernate. (I could be wrong here, it was long time ago)</p>

<p>That is ok, as long as I work on tutorial. When a real-life project is involved, you can't afford to drop a database every time you need a new field in a table. </p>

<p>Just imagine scenario, you are working on a project with many clients. Every client has their own database. In release 1.0.1 I need to add a new field to one of the tables. If I drop database in my dev environment - not a big deal. (Still, I need to run a script to populate test data every time DB is dropped, and sometimes even this is no viable)</p>

<p>But what do I do when I need to deploy this new version? Make a SQL script to update client's databases without dropping them? then deploy binaries?</p>

<p>But how is this better than doing database mods separate from code changes?</p>

<p>I have a String I read in from a pdf file that has a list of questions.
It's in the format of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>QUESTION NO: 1</strong></p>
  
  <p>xxxxxxx (question text)</p>
  
  <p>A) xxxx (multiple choice) B) xxxx C) xxxx ...</p>
  
  <p>Answer:  xxxxx</p>
  
  <p><strong>QUESTION NO: 2</strong></p>
  
  <p>xxxxxxx (question text)</p>
  
  <p>.... (etc)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are about 200 questions in the list.</p>

<p>I am trying to use Regex to break up the text so each question can be in a separate string. </p>

<p>I've done this before with html and xml documents, but they were easy since there are a lot of identifying tags like double quotes, brackets, and parentheses.  </p>

<p>But I am clueless as to how to do this with just text.  I've tried a lot of combinations, but it just seems like I can't get the right format:</p>

<pre><code>var questionPattern = @""QUESTION NO:(.*)QUESTION NO:"";
var questionMatch = Regex.Matches(pdfText, questionPattern, RegexOptions.Singleline);
</code></pre>

<p>I was wondering, is there a way to do:</p>

<pre><code>var questionPattern = @""(?&lt;=QUESTION NO:)[^QUESTION NO:]*"";
</code></pre>

<p>Where the <code>[^QUESTION NO:]*</code> reads everything after each Question header until it stops when it comes to the next Question header?  </p>

<p>Obviously this is the wrong format, but I hope people will understand what I'm trying to get at.  </p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br>

When I use 'Unicode' in the following, I mean 'UCS2 as it used in Windows' and in the context of Visual Studio build settings.</p>

<p>With that out of the way: with the upcoming Visual Studio 2013, Microsoft is finally phasing out MBCS builds. Which is what is spurring me to fix up our code base to enter the 21st century, and switch to Unicode builds for all our code that uses win32 and MFC. However, we use some external libraries that are portable, don't use anything Windows-specific and that use MBCS settings. I'm not looking forward to identifying each and every interaction point between those libraries and our own code, and deal with WideCharToMultiByte(), ATL conversion macros and consorts everywhere.</p>

<p>So my question is: what are the best practices on dealing with mixed mbcs/Unicode builds? Are there any guide documents or example applications where it's done?</p>

<p>I'm hoping there is a better way than having to define my own string type with conversion operators for all types that are used in the various libraries :)</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/Developing/WSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec22c24-7c48.html"" rel=""nofollow"">ColdFusion session documentation</a> mentions the benefits of J2EE sessions, but not any advantages of ColdFusion sessions.  J2EE sessions have been available since ColdFusion MX (released in 2002), but there are still a lot of people using standard ColdFusion sessions. Are there any disadvantages of J2EE sessions that aren't present with ColdFusion sessions?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>J2EE session management provides the following advantages over ColdFusion session management:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>J2EE session management uses a session-specific session identifier, <code>jsessionid</code>, which is created afresh at the start of each session. </li>
  <li>You can share session variables between ColdFusion pages and JSP pages or Java servlets that you call from the ColdFusion pages. </li>
  <li>The Session scope is serializable (convertible into a sequence of bytes that can later be fully restored into the original object). With ColdFusion session management, the Session scope is not serializable. Only serializable scopes can be shared across servers. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Therefore, consider using J2EE session management in any of the following cases:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>You want to maximize session security, particularly if you also use client variables </li>
  <li>You want to share session variables between ColdFusion pages and JSP pages or servlets in a single application.</li>
  <li>You want to be able to manually terminate a session while maintaining the client identification cookie for use by the Client scope. </li>
  <li>You want to support clustered sessions; for example, to support session failover among servers.</li>

<p><strong>One more thing: If you notice in the constructor, there is a 1==1 to override the conditional CSRF protection check.  This is because removing it causes the app to enter an infinite re-direct loop (for some reason these values never match up, and I cannot figure out why)</strong></p>

I need to organize a reliable and fast method of file transfer between these PCs, that will be initiated by C# apps running on both. Any client may want to send/receive data from any server. The options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>FTP - Use <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229715.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">FtpWebRequest</a> or <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/sosftp/"" rel=""nofollow"">SOSFTP</a> to upload files onto an FTP server. The server checks for new files on its filesystem and does the required steps.</p></li>
<li><p>SCP - Secure file transfer. Usage same as FTP but increased security between machines. Probably slower than FTP.</p></li>
<li><p>DropBox / Box.Net - Use an online cloud storage solution with a library such as <a href=""http://sharpbox.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">SharpBox</a>. May be  free / paid. May be less secure considering the said party has your files.</p></li>
<li><p>UDP - Use a library such as <a href=""http://businessintegrationtechnology.com/CommunityEdition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">EME</a> or <a href=""http://www.goanywheremft.com/products"" rel=""nofollow"">GoAnywhere</a> to transfer data from PC to PC directly via UDP. Probably faster but probably more unreliable since it uses custom technology.</p></li>

            &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;

<p>Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){                          
$(function() {
    $(""#tableceleb tbody"").sortable({ opacity: 0.9, cursor: 'move', axis: 'y', update: function() {
        var order = $(this).sortable(""serialize"") + '&amp;action=updateRecordsListings&amp;celeb=&lt;?php echo $id_celebracao ?&gt;'; 
        $.post(""updateDB.php"", order);      
    }                                         
    });
});

}); 
</code></pre>

<p>Notes: $id_celebracao is one of the rows that we use to identify which table_id it corresponds.</p>

<p>Then we have updateDB.php that corresponds to the file that treats the ajax part:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
require(""host.php"");

$action = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['action']); 
$updateRecordsArray = $_POST['recordsArray'];
$id_celebracao = $_POST['celeb'];
if ($action === ""updateRecordsListings""){

$listingCounter = 1;
foreach ($updateRecordsArray as $order=&gt;$recordsArray) {

    $query = ""UPDATE escolhas SET ordem =$listingCounter WHERE id_momento = $recordsArray AND id_celebracao=$id_celebracao"";
    mysql_query($query) or die('Error, insert query failed');
    $listingCounter = $listingCounter + 1;  
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
?></p>

<p>And finally we have the db table 'escolhas' presented and explained in the following scheme:</p>

<p>Conclusion: It doesn't work. I really need your help in these because it is a fundamental part of the web app I'm developing!</p>

<p>Hope the long post doesn't bother you!</p>

<p>Also I'm not newbie in PHP and I know that mysql functions will be deprecated in the near future but it is not relevant to the project. Also, this is my first time working with Jquery and ajax!</p>

A Tablix has  7 rows but I need to increase height of tablix until it matches the footer.

<p>[Edited.]</p>

<p>According to below figure, I tried to insert a lot of blank rows to a Tablix. 
And I used an Expression for setting visibility each row.
Example :</p>

<p>-If Dataset has one record. One Blank row will hide.</p>

<p>-If Dataset has two records. Two Blank rows will hide.</p>

<p>But It is inflexible because some rows aren't a single Line.</p>

<p>The schema in question is as follows:</p>

        &lt;parameter name = ""username""
                   value = ""{column: username, validator: Regex,

&lt;/behavior&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The schema for the username column:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;column name=""username"" type=""varchar"" size=""20"" required=""true"" primaryString=""true""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The validator for the email column is working as expected, however, the validator for usernames is not. It's expected to match usernames that use letters, numbers, underscores, or question marks, of lengths between 1 and 20 characters. In it's current state, an exception is thrown for every save() into this table, including valid usernames.</p>

<p>However, if I change the regex to <code>/^[a-zA-Z0-9_?]{1,20}/</code> (removing the $ and D), it allows everything, including invalid usernames.</p>

<p>Now, if I run this using IE5 on my development machine I get an alert that is between 200 and 300 ms. This is good. 
But, when I run this on the scanner, it takes over 20000 ms (20 seconds) to load.</p>

<p>Here are the times for each script as I add them, in order (starting with jQuery)</p>

<ul>
<li>5 seconds (jQuery on it's own)</li>
<li>6 seconds (jQuery, json2)</li>
<li>6 seconds (jQuery, json2, jQuery-cookie)</li>
<li>8 seconds (jQuery, json2, jQuery-cookie, knockoutjs)</li>
<li>9 seconds (jQuery, json2, jQuery-cookie, knockoutjs, sammy)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I start adding my view models to see what affect these have:</p>

<ul>
<li>9 seconds (app dataModel)</li>
<li>10 seconds (app dataModel, viewModel)</li>
<li>11 seconds (app dataModel, viewModel and common)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each other view model takes around a second to load.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever experienced this before? If so, how did you fix it?
I am at a loss because we have another application that loads around the same amount of scripts and it is pretty much instant.</p>

  while ((myLine = myBuffered.readLine()) != null) {

    if(rowCount == 0) {// get Column names  since it's the first row

            myTable.myColumns.add(mySplits[i]);
            myTable.numColumns++;
            }
        }
    else{ //rowCount is not zero, so this is data, not column names.
    String[] mySplits = myLine.split("",""); //split the line
    for(int i = 0; i&lt;mySplits.length;++i){

    currentRow.add(mySplits[i]); //add each element to the row Arraylist

        //the problem lies here *****************
     }
    rowCount++;//increment rowCount
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is when I don't call <code>currentRow.clear()</code> to clear the contents of the ArrayList that I'm using in each iteration (to put into my ArrayList of ArrayList), with each iteration, I get that row PLUS every other row.</p>

<p>But when I do call <code>currentRow.clear()</code> after I add <code>currentRow</code> to my <code>arrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>, it actually clears the data that I added to the master arrayList as well as the currentRow object.... and I just want the currentRow ArrayList empty but not the ArrayList that I just added to my ArrayList (Mytable.MyRows[currentRow]).</p>

<p>Can anyone explain what's going on here?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In C++ pointers and arrays are closely intertwined. In particular, as
  we’ll see, <strong>when we use an array, the compiler ordinarily converts the
  array to a pointer</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to use iterators for printing an array. The program below works fine but when I try to print <code>arr2</code> or <code>arr3</code>, if I'm not mistaken, which is of type <code>int *</code>, I get an error (judging that the &amp; operator means reference below). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>error: no matching function for call to ‘begin(int*&amp;)’</code></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char** argv) {

    int arr[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    auto arr2 = arr;
    auto arr3(arr);   // I think arr2 and arr3 are of same type

    for(auto it = std::begin(arr) ; it != std::end(arr) ; ++it)
        std::cout &lt;&lt; *it &lt;&lt; "" "";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Considering the statement, if an array is converted into a pointer by the compiler, how does this program work for printing contents of <code>arr</code> using <code>std::begin()</code> and <code>std::end()</code>  and do not work for <code>arr2</code> or <code>arr3</code> if all of them are pointers to integers?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I'm sorry if I couldn't make it clear. I hope I'll clarify the problem by this edit. </p>

<p>Now that I am aware that <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> won't work with pointers (thanks to the answers), I wonder if the quoted text is not true as it specifies that there is an <strong>Array -> Pointer</strong> conversion. If what text says is true then the type of <code>arr</code> should be a pointer. Is there a problem with the quoted text at this point?</p>

<p>Also, is there any way that I can use <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> for pointers (not STL containers) with specifying the size, possibly using the following constructor?</p>

<pre><code>template&lt; class T, size_t N &gt; 
T* begin( T (&amp;array)[N] );

<pre><code>site  category  code value
1      first    x     10
1      first    y     8
1      second   x      30

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Fields types are site= numeric, category =char, code = char, value = numeric.</p>

<p>This code accomplishes what I want, but only writes 1 plot to each pdf, so the result is about 20 files, each containing 1 plot instead of a plot for each code associated with the category.  The rest of the plots flicker on the monitor. Then the pdf closes and the next opens.  Repeat.</p>

<pre><code>d_ply(df,""category"",function(x){
pdf(file=paste(unique(x$category),"".pdf""))
    d_ply( df, ""code"", function(y) {
    plot(data=y, value~site, xlab=names(df[1]),ylab=unique(y$code))
dev.off()
})    

})

<p>This code writes all plots to each category, so the result is about 20 files, each containing all 300 of the plots.</p>

<pre><code>d_ply(df,""category"",function(x){
pdf(file=paste(unique(x$category),"".pdf""))

})

})
</code></pre>

<p>I appreciate the comments.</p>

<p>Update:  I resolved the issue above so passing on the solution.  This code block works, assuming a df and relevant field ids in the df exist.  The code reads record blocks in the df, grouping them by a categorical variable, plots a numeric field by category, then repeats for reach category, then closes the pdf. The other statements just describe the file, modify the field headers, and report the runtime.</p>

<p>Running the code you see below this operation takes somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 hours.</p>

<p>I've tried using ADO's find method and it actually appears to be slower than the filter method.</p>

<p>The database is a Visual Foxpro 6 database. The table does have an index on the item_cd field but the table does not have any primary key established. This is out of my control since I didn't write the software and I'm trying to stay away from making any structural changes to the database.</p>

<p>There are 46652 rows in the text file and about 650,000 records/rows in the ADO recordset. I think slimming down the recordset would be the biggest step in fixing this but I haven't come up with any way of doing that. I'm trying to prevent creating duplicate records since there is no primary key and so I really need to have the entire table in my recordset.</p>

<p>Because I'm running this on my local machine it appears that the operation is limited by the power of the CPU. In actuality this might be used across the network, especially if I can get it to go faster.</p>

<p>Entity Framework 7 supports dependency injection for <code>DbContext</code> subclasses.  This mechanism includes allowing for configuration of data access outside of of the <code>DbContext</code>.</p>

<p>For example, the following would configure EF to persist to a SQL server using a connection string retrieved from <code>config.json</code></p>

<pre><code>ServiceCollection services = ...

var configuration = new Configuration().AddJsonFile( ""config.json"" );
services.AddEntityFramework( configuration )
    .AddSqlServer()
    .AddDbContext&lt;BillingDbContext&gt;( config =&gt; config.UseSqlServer() );
</code></pre>

<p>However, the migrations commands do not know to execute this code so <code>Add-Migration</code> will fail for lack of a provider or lack of a connection string.</p>

<p>Migrations can be made to work by overriding <code>OnConfiguring</code> within the <code>DbContext</code> subclass to specify the provider and configuration string, but that gets in the way when different configuration is desired elsewhere.  Ultimately keeping my the migration commands and my code both working becomes undesirably complex.</p>

<p>Note: My <code>DbContext</code> lives in a different assembly than the entry point that uses it and my solution has multiple start-up projects.</p>

<p>Is there a method I can implement, or a try-catch, or revival of original keyboard, or somewhere I can prevent the user from hitting this field if there is no data any of those would work. The data for categories is in an NSArray. The data for subcategories is in a two-dimensional NSArray indexed off of the index of the associated category.</p>

Instead, you have to tap and hold for a while before the button highlights. According to the documentation, this is because UIScrollView waits a little to determine if the user intends to drag the scroll view before forwarding touches to the views in the scroll view.</p>

<p>As noted in several Stackoverflow answers (such as this one: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/19656611/2135004"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/19656611/2135004</a>), the solution is to prevent this delay by setting the delaysContentTouches property of UIScrollView to NO. (An additional step is to subclass UIScrollView to override touchesShouldCancelInContentView: to return YES for UIButtons, so the user can still scroll the scroll view if the user initially touched the button in the scroll view.)</p>

<p>However, interacting with the App Store app seems to suggest another solution. (Although it may be a little picky, one reason I am not going with the solution where delaysContentTouches is set to NO is because I do not want the button to highlight if the user quickly drags on a button to scroll the scroll view. This is actually the highlighting behavior UITableViewCells.) Consider the following screenshot of the App Store app:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mpCRC.png"" alt=""App Store Screenshot Showing Buttons""></p>

<p>The blue ""Quick Links"" buttons (namely, ""App Collections,"" ""Game Collections,"" and ""Apps Made by Apple"") seem to be implemented as UIButtons with the UIButtonTypeSystem style because their highlighting fades in and out as you drag your finger in and out of them. In addition, the scroll view's delaysContentTouches property does not seem to be set to NO because the blue ""Quick Links"" buttons do not highlight when you quickly tap on them. However, the gray bordered buttons (namely, ""Redeem,"" ""Send Gift,"" and ""Apple ID: ..."") do highlight when you quickly tap on them! (Their highlighting also fades in and out as you drag your finger in and out of them.) Also note that the buttons do not highlight when you just happen to be touching them when you drag the scroll view.</p>

<p><strong>How are these gray bordered buttons implemented? The key behavior I want is that they highlight when you quickly tap on them in a scroll view that delays content touches.</strong> (They should also highlight and unhighlight as you drag your finger in and out of them like plain UIButtons, preferably by fading their highlighting.) I do not see how this could be easily achieved by just subclassing UIButton, and I'm not even sure if somehow subclassing UIControl to create a new button class would work either.</p>

<p>Some of the answers suggested I change the function signature to IntPtr or StringBuilder. I also saw these solutions on a few sites in my googling, most notably <a href=""http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/thread-1378860.php"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. (There were others, but I don't have time to hunt down the links).</p>

We recently got an Apple Enterprise developer account, so in-house distribution becomes available, and is in fact the preferred distribution method in this case.</p>

<p>I was able to switch to the the enterprise provisioning profile in Xcode and build the app successfully. I can use Xcode to sync it to my iPad and it runs without error there. I then email the app to a colleague and he uses iTunes to sync it to his iPad. When he runs it, the screen goes black for a moment and then returns to the home page with all the installed apps on it.</p>

Searches on ""iPad app fails on startup"" or ""iPad app fails on launch"" yield little. Some suggest simply restarting the iPad, but I'd like to know what is really going on and solve any underlying problems.</p>

"14760916","1","14763741","","2013-02-07 21:02:49","","6","273","<p>Last night I learned about the /redo option for when you <code>return</code> from a function.  It lets  you return <em>another</em> function, which is then invoked at the calling site and reinvokes the evaluator from the same position</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; foo: func [a] [(print a) (return/redo (func [b] [print b + 10]))] 

&gt;&gt; foo ""Hello"" 10
Hello
20
</code></pre>

<p>Even though <code>foo</code> is a function that only takes one argument, it now <em>acts like a function that took two arguments</em>.  Something like that would otherwise require the caller to know you were returning a function, and that caller would have to manually use the <code>do</code> evaluator on it.</p>

<p>Thus without <code>return/redo</code>, you'd get:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; foo: func [a] [(print a) (return (func [b] [print b + 10]))] 

&gt;&gt; foo ""Hello"" 10
Hello
== 10
</code></pre>

<p><code>foo</code> consumed its one parameter and returned a function by value (which was not invoked, thus the interpreter moved on).  Then the expression evaluated to 10.  If <code>return/redo</code> did not exist you'd have had to write:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; do foo ""Hello"" 10
Hello
20
</code></pre>

<p>This keeps the caller from having to know (or care) if you've chosen to return a function to execute.  And is cool because you can do things like tail call optimization, or writing a wrapper for the return functionality itself.  Here's a variant of <code>return</code> that prints a message but still exits the function and provides the result:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; myreturn: func [] [(print ""Leaving..."") (return/redo :return)]

&gt;&gt; foo: func [num] [myreturn num + 10]

&gt;&gt; foo 10
Leaving...
== 20
</code></pre>

<p>But functions aren't the only thing that have behavior in <code>do</code>.  So if this is a general pattern for <em>""removing the need for a DO at the callsite""</em>, then why doesn't this print anything?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; test: func [] [return/redo [print ""test""]]

&gt;&gt; test 
== [print ""test""]
</code></pre>

<p>It just returned the block by value, like a normal return would have.  Shouldn't it have printed out ""test""?  That's what <code>do</code> would...uh, do with it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; do [print ""test""]
test

<p>Using the same document root for both http and https means you need to implement the following:</p>

<p>The trouble is, the cursor does not move when paging, as it should. When the user presses the cursor keys the page scrolls back to where it was before pressing <code>Page Up / Page Down</code></p>

<p>Here's the code I'm using the catch the key down events</p>

<pre><code>$(window).bind('keydown', function (event) {

        // page up
        event.preventDefault();
        // scroll page to current scroll - window height

        // place cursor on page

    }
    else if (event.which == 34) {

        event.preventDefault();
        // scroll page to current scroll + window height
        $(document).scrollTop($(document).scrollTop() + document.body.clientHeight);
        // move cursor to bottom 
    }

<p>But how do I know <em>where</em> to set it? I can infer the text height from a given position by truncating the text after the cursor and then measuring the height of the div, but I don't know how to do the reverse.</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>I'm looking for any solution which will allow the Page Up / Page Down keys to function as normal within a contentEditable div, in a WebView, in a Windows Store App. </p>

<p>Definition of ""Normal"": With the cursor at the top of a long, contentEditable document, pressing <code>Page Down</code> should scroll the div down by the height of that div, and <strong>move the cursor the same amount</strong>. <code>Page Up</code> should obviously do the opposite, scrolling up the way. </p>

<p>This is apparently not how <code>Page Up</code> / <code>Page Down</code> work on a Mac, but I'm not interested in that as this is a Windows Store app. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE: I am not looking for a function to set the caret position. I already have that.</strong> </p>

<p>FYI: I find it is adequate to test in IE11 in desktop mode. This uses the same rendering / javascript engine as the Windows Store WebView. </p>

<p>The styling is dependent on whether the source item of of the table row is present in a certain list or not.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far:</p>

<p>1) The data class that holds the data of a table row together with two boolean properties (true if the data is contained in list X) and a string property that should bind to the correct style attributes.</p>

<pre><code>private class WebPageData {
    private WebPage page;

    private BooleanProperty isReferenced = new SimpleBooleanProperty(false);
    private BooleanProperty isReferencing = new SimpleBooleanProperty(false);

    private StringBinding style = new When(isReferenced).then(""..."").otherwise(...);
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) A change listener on table selection change that updates each boolean property accordingly, when the table selection changes</p>

<pre><code>tblResultData.getSelectionModel().getSelectedIndices().addListener(new ListChangeListener&lt;Integer&gt;() {
        @Override
        public void onChanged(ListChangeListener.Change&lt;? extends Integer&gt; arg0) {
            if (arg0.getList().size() == 0) {
                selectedPage.set(null);
            } else {
                // for coloring only consider the first selected row
                // multi select must be doable for certain other features
                WebPage selectedWebPage = tblResultData.getItems().get(arg0.getList().get(0)).page;
                selectedPage.set(selectedWebPage);

                // tableModel.data holds a list of data for every table row
                for (WebPageData data : tableModel.data) {
                    boolean referenced = selectedWebPage.getReferencedWebPagesList().contains(data.page);
                    boolean referencing = selectedWebPage.getReferencingWebPagesList().contains(data.page);

                    data.isReferenced.set(referenced);
                    data.isReferencing.set(referencing);
                }
            }
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Now what I want to do is to somehow bind the style property of each table cell to the style property of WebPageData - so that the change listener updates the two boolean properties, therefore the style property of WebPageData is updated and in consequence the style of the table cell changes.</p>

<p>I tried to bind the style during creation phase by using a custom TableCellFactory, but of course this approach fails as there is no WebPageData instance present at this time. As the TableColumn classes don't provide an opportunity to iterate over all cells (so I could bind the style after the table actually gets its data), the only option I currently see is to keep a reference to each created table cell. I don't consider this solution is good practice.</p>

<p>So is there any other option to bind the cell styles? If I don't bind them, I have to set the styles manually each time the table selection changes - which puts me to the ""I can't iterate over cells"" problem again.</p>

But my problem is when I use <code>onBlur</code> event inside my directive, because I invalidate the field as soon as I start typing it becomes dirty and shows invalid even though I just want it invalid after the <code>onBlur</code>, so I found out that the best is to invalidate the Form instead of each fields.

<p>Situation:</p>

<p>I have an outer div with an image included. Additionally it includes multiple inner divs. </p>

<p>Problem:</p>

<p>I want to zoom the image inside the div without zooming/resizing the outer div. Additionally the outer div should provide scrollbars (with overflow: scroll or overflow: auto css option). And the inner divs (element like a square or circle) should hold its position. What I mean is this: Imagine the image is a picture consisting of 16 fields. I put a square into field no. 2/2 (row 2, column 2). When I zoom I don't want to get it lost its position because the image is resizing and the square holds its position. </p>

<p>This is my structure:</p>

<p>#divOuter { position:relative; border: 3px solid red; height:400px;  width:1000px; overflow: auto; font-size: 12px; transform-origin: top left; -o-transform-origin: top left; -moz-transform-origin: top left; -webkit-transform-origin: top left; -ms-transform-origin: top left; z-index:1}</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""divOuter"" &gt;
    &lt;img id=""image"" width=""800"" height=""400"" src=""../../Imagefiel.jpg"" alt=""""&gt;
    &lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;div id=""circleID"" title=""circle11"" style=""border: 1px solid black; border-radius:   
    10px; width: 20px; height: 20px; position:absolute;left: 579px; top: 262px; background-
    color: green; z-index:3""&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried two things already:
   - Zoom via transform/scale
     It nearly works as wished but the outer div is resizing too, it shouldn't.
     I used these commands:
 $(""#divTest"").css('transform', 'scale(' + parseFloat(nScale / 100) + ')');
 $(""#divTest"").css('font-size', nScale);</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase the image size (width/height)
 Problem: The inner divs lost its position, they went outside the fields, they 
          didn't resize/move with the image</li>
</ul>

<p>I would really appreciate it, if someone could help me with this problem.</p>

<p>Thanks,
sanchez</p>

<p>EDIT: I could solve it :) I included a further div (position: relative) inside the outer div and zoomed it. That way the inner elements got positioned relative to the outer relative div.</p>

<p>Here's two of the end-of-chapter exercises:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Write a program to add a copyright line to all of your exercise answers so far, placing a line like <code>## Copyright (c) 20XX by Yours Truly</code> in the file immediately after the 'shebang' line. Presume that the program will be invoked with the filenames to edit already on the command line. </p></li>
  <li><p>Modify the previous program so that it doesn't edit the files that already contain the copyright line. As a hint on that, you might need to know that the name of the file being read by the diamond operator is in $ARGV.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This was my attempted solution:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl

use 5.014;
use warnings;

my $shebang     = '(#!/usr/bin/env perl|#!/usr/bin/perl)'; 
my $copyright   = '# Copyright (c) 20XX Yours Truly'; 

$^I = "".bak"";

while (&lt;&gt;) {
    unless (/$copyright/mi) {
        s/($shebang)/$1\n$copyright/mig;
    }
    print;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Run on the command line with <code>perl ch9.pl sample_perl_script.pl</code>.</p>

<p>My goals were: </p>

<ul>
<li>Keep the original shebang intact, regardless of path.</li>
<li>Loop through <code>&lt;&gt;</code> just once.</li>
<li>Check to see if the copyright notice existed. </li>
<li>If it didn't, add it (hence the attempt with <code>unless { ... }</code>). </li>
</ul>

<p>This works for the first part of the problem (adding a copyright line) but not the second (check to make sure the copyright doesn't already exist). </p>

<p>My questions are: Why? And why is the <code>unless</code> totally ignored when I run the program? </p>

<p>I peeked at the appendix, and the book's proposed solution was to create a hash to track filenames from <code>$ARGV</code>, and pass over the files <em>twice</em>. First to eliminate files that already had the copyright notice, then to perform the search/replace. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>my %do_these;
foreach (@ARGV) {
    $do_these{$_} = 1;
}

while (&lt;&gt;) { 
    if (/\A## Copyright/) {
        delete $do_these{$ARGV};
    }
}

@ARGV = sort keys %do_these; 
$^I = "".bak"";
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    if (/\A#!/) {
        $_ .= ""## Copyright (c) 20XX by Yours Truly\n"";
    }
    print;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works, of course, but it seems like twice the work. I'm trying to see if there's a way to do this within a single <code>while (&lt;&gt;) { ... }</code> loop, with my approach, and come away with a better understanding of how the diamond operator works.</p>

<p>If my approach is totally off-base, please explain why and don't spare my feelings. I'm more interested in a full understanding than my ego. </p>

I've already programmed this and it works with single touch and multi touch. When the user is moving around his region the ball moves with his finger and he can hit the third ball that moves through both regions . I want to apply a force or velocity when the user hits the third ball with his own ball (aka finger) equal to the velocity of the ball of the user but the main problem is that the ball of the user has no velocity when I move it around with touches, yes it moves around and follows the finger but it has 0 velocity.</p>

<p>After looking through stackoverflow i found a way to give the user balls some velocity when they move with the finger. Now, my I can apply this force in the didBeginContact method when the user ball touches the third ball. It works perfectly when I have one touch on the screen (one finger on the screen). </p>

<p>But NOW the main problem is that when I try to put 2 finger on the screen at the same time (one in each region of course, one in the lower region for the first player and one i the upper region for the second player) . The MOMENT I multi touch, suddenly all nodes disappear, even the line in the middle disappears, I am left with nothing but the background. </p>

<p>Why is this happening ? </p>

<p>Here is my code : </p>

<pre><code>var location:CGPoint = CGPointMake(0.0,0.0);
var previousLocation:CGPoint = CGPointMake(0.0,0.0);


func didBeginContact(contact: SKPhysicsContact) {

    println(""CALLED"");

    if contact.bodyA == p2 || contact.bodyB == p2{

        ball.physicsBody!.velocity = CGVectorMake(ball.position.x - p2.position.x, ball.position.y - p2.position.y);

    }

    if contact.bodyA == p1 || contact.bodyB == p1  {

        ball.physicsBody!.velocity = CGVectorMake(ball.position.x - p1.position.x, ball.position.y - p1.position.y);

    }


}




 var previousTimeStamp:NSTimeInterval = 0.0;

override func touchesBegan(touches: NSSet, withEvent event: UIEvent) {

    var touch:AnyObject = touches.anyObject()!;

    previousTimeStamp = touch.timestamp;

}



 var time:CGFloat = 0;


override func touchesMoved(touches: NSSet, withEvent event: UIEvent) {



    for touch: AnyObject in touches{

    location = touch.locationInNode(self);

    previousLocation = touch.previousLocationInNode(self);


    var change:CGPoint = CGPointMake(location.x - previousLocation.x, location.y - previousLocation.y);


    time = CGFloat(touch.timestamp - previousTimeStamp);

    if (location.y) &lt; (self.frame.height/2 - 2){

        p1.position = location;


        p1.physicsBody!.velocity = CGVectorMake((change.x)/time, (change.y)/time);

<p>I am creating a feature for our MVC 4 website that will allow users to generate a PDF report. These reports will take several minutes to generate so I don't wanna keep the user sitting there while I present several knock-knock jokes in a status window so I can go the traditional route of creating a job table, entering the job request and then poll the table for new job requests and ultimately generate the files that way.</p>

<p>I was told by my boss to just use a multithreded approach. In other words, spin off the the file generation task on a second thread. Is there any way to do this in a multi-threaded fashion instead? I am pretty certain that since the HTTP request is stateless, once the user terminates the session by a variety of means, least of which, closing the browser window, all threads would go away or could not be guaranteed to persist. </p>

Of-course one of the ways could be to manually comment/uncomment the module listings in their corresponding root module that introduces them, but is there any other way directly from say <code>cargo test --someflag -only_this_module</code> or something ?</p>

<p><strong>Explaining More:</strong></p>

<p>say I have following modules:
<code>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h</code> where <code>f</code> depends only on <code>g</code> and <code>h</code> but rest of <code>a, b, c, d, e</code> depend on <code>f</code> (and maybe <code>g</code> and <code>h</code> but that should not matter). <code>g</code> and <code>h</code> ofcourse dont depend on anything from above. So if i make a change to <code>f</code> i want to compile only <code>f</code> and test it without changing all of them. Since <code>f</code> depends only on <code>g</code> and <code>h</code> i assume that if things are fine with these three then i should be able to test <code>f</code> even though <code>a, b ... e</code> are broken and crate will not compile if i do the normal <code>cargo build/test</code> . Is this possible.</p>

<p>The 'popToViewController' line does nothing. In fact the only time anything happened was when I uncomment the two commented lines, but as soon as I make a ViewController the root and make it visible, it looses its connection to the NavigationController.

<p>I should add that I have created the NavigationController in Storyboard. Should I create it programatically instead?

<p>When I press the button to get the results in the logcat, all the values are equal to the first 3 editTexts ie equal to items[0], quants[0] and rates[0]. Secondly the onFocusChangeListener() only works for the editText present in the first linearLayout that was predefined.</p>

So I have some questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is it better to start with Zend Framework 2?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is it better to start with a CMS/CMF based on Zend Framework?</strong> (to boost the project startup process)</li>
<li><strong>If so, what are the CMS/CMF based on (or willing to upgrade to) Zend Framework 2?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>PS: throughout my research I have found and categorized some CMS/CMF based on Zend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Famous but relatively old (probably abandoned, I'm not sure)
<ul>
<li><strong>TomatoCMS</strong> (my favorite of this category, uses jQuery)</li>
<li>Digitalus CMS</li>
<li>PimCore</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Newer (probably still active)
<ul>
<li>ZF-Boilerplate (currently working on a version for Zend Framework 2)</li>
<li><strong>Centurion</strong> (my favorite of this category, uses jQuery, CRUD and supports social identification. I might be leaning a little towards it)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I probably mention that my project goes under the CMS category and considered mid-sized.</p>

<p>Waiting your opinions, especially if anyone has already worked with TomatoCMS, Centurion or Zend Framework 2.</p>

<p><strong>Updated:</strong></p>

<p>I know that there's a related question ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1925735/cms-built-on-zend-framework"">CMS built on Zend Framework</a>"" but it does not answer all of my questions.</p>

"19771051","1","","","2013-11-04 15:25:50","","3","1497","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Let's take the next sceneraio:</p>

<ol>
<li>the user uses an app X which has multiple activities (like the gmail app).</li>
<li>after navigating the app X a bit, he goes to your app.</li>
<li>in your app, you need to start this X app using an intent, to go to a specific activity within it.</li>
<li>now the user goes to this specific activity on the app X. </li>
<li>the user presses the back button, hoping to go back to your app instead of staying on the app X.</li>
</ol>

<p>another similar scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>the user navigates on your app between activities.</li>
<li>your app went to the background (using the home button, for example).</li>
<li>your app shows a notification that once clicked, it will open a specific activity of your app.</li>
<li>the user clicks on the notification and goes to the specific activity of your app.</li>
<li>the user presses the back button, hoping to return to the app that was shown before clicking on the notification, instead of going to the previous activity on your app that was shown the last time it left it.</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that the last step on both scenarios isn't the default behavior.</p>

<p>This is why I've searched what is the best combination of flags for this purpose.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>It seems that the only flag that can achieve the behavior i've described is <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK</strong></a> (together with <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</strong></a>).</p>

<p>According to the android API, however, this flag isn't recommended for normal use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not use this flag unless you are implementing your own top-level
  application launcher. 
  ... </p>
  
  <p>Because the default system does not include
  graphical task management, you should not use this flag unless you
  provide some way for a user to return back to the tasks you have
  launched.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This information seems as confusing as the rest of the descriptions about intents.</p>

<p>There are other intents flags that I've seen, like <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK</strong></a> that achieve a similar result, but they have weird behaviors and/or they use high API </p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>Is it safe to use this flag? Are there any good alternatives to it?</p>

<p>What is the danger of using this flag and what is the meaning of the description on the API of using it?</p>

If you're in China it will use AutoNavi maps, and else it will use the default Apple maps. To complicate things, the AutoNavi maps seem to be transformed in the same way that Google's maps on iOS 5 are, whereas the default Apple maps are not transformed.</p>

<p>By <em>transformed</em> I'm talking about the fact that <a href=""http://home.wangjianshuo.com/archives/20081109_all_maps_in_china_are_transformed.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">all maps in China are transformed</a>, although this is not true. Rather, <em>some</em> maps in China are transformed, while some are not.</p>

<p>This transform makes it difficult to place annotations correctly on the map since the map is generally offset about 500 meters. Since it's not possible to reverse the transform of the actual map, the solution is to apply the same offset to the annotations.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12226688/how-to-find-the-inverse-of-the-china-transform-in-mkmapview"">There exists non-trivial ways to inverse the transform, at least for limited areas.</a> The problem in iOS 6 is knowing whether or not the map is transformed to be able to compensate annotations appropriately. On iOS 5 this problem did not exist since the transformed maps were used consistently.</p>

<p>The Shanghai maps below illustrates the situation (the actual transform offset is not demonstrated).</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Wqmv.png"" alt=""ios 6 chinese maps""></p>

<p>So, would there be any way of knowing in run-time whether transformed or non-transformed China maps are used? Other ideas for dealing with this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Routing network traffic through a proxy in China changes map apperance in the simulator, so the choice of map provider must be based on IP.</p>

<p>I successfully implemented the createdb function, however has encountered some issue when implementing the selectdb function. The problem is when the second time it enters the selectdb (after user has selected a database and submit the result), the form.is_valid() always return false. </p>

<p>I want to create a dynamic django form since the number of databases are not fixed. So i want to pass in parameters from view.py to the selectdb_form.py file The form has a drop down field where lists all the database name that can be selected by the user.</p>

<p>This is the error returned after i click submit:</p>

<pre><code>Exception Type: KeyError
Exception Value:    
'my_arg'
Exception Location: /Users/jetyue/Documents/atdb-web/smem02_webapp/webapp/selectdb_form.py in __init__, line 5
</code></pre>

<p>this is the function inside view.py (please ignore the bad indentation here, it is correct in my file). 
I also noticed this wired output from print request.POST:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;QueryDict: {u'SelectDatabase': [u'3'], u'csrfmiddlewaretoken': [u'HxtAofaKD9FiSLLWk3vkbAdIh0mCUhdJ'], u'submit': [u'Connect to Database']}&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I do not know where does the u' come from.</p>

<pre><code>def selectdb (request):
    final_name = []

    if request.method == 'POST': #if form is submitted, comes in here
        print request.POST
        form = selectdb_form(request.POST)
        print ""inside post first if""

        if form.is_valid():
            print ""inside post second if""

    args = {}
    args.update(csrf(request))

    form = selectdb_form(my_arg = final_name)

    args['form'] = form
    #print args
    return render_to_response('selectdb.html', args)
</code></pre>

<p>This is the dynamic form (selectdb_form.py) file:</p>

<pre><code>from django import forms

class selectdb_form(forms.Form):
    def  __init__(self,  *args,  **kwargs):
        my_arg = kwargs.pop('my_arg') 
        super(selectdb_form, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['SelectDatabase'] = forms.ChoiceField(choices=my_arg, widget=forms.Select(), required=True)
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder if there is anything wrong with my dynamic form? I mean can i use  <code>form = selectdb_form(request.POST)</code> with the dynamic form? since that's where the error occurs.</p>

<p>Thank you guys so much for helping me!!</p>

<p>But I have a type mismatch and I don't see how to initialize my implementation.</p>

<p>The first idea that I had in mind is to make my class implement <code>Iterator&lt;Iterator&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> but this would not work because the next method will have the signature <code>public Iterator&lt;T&gt; next()</code> which does not correspond to what I want to do. Instead of returning of <code>Iterator&lt;T&gt;</code>, I want to return the type <code>T</code>.</p>

<p>So I create another interface which is very similar to the Iterator interface : </p>

<pre><code>  public interface MyIterator&lt;T extends Iterator&lt;T&gt;&gt; {

    public boolean hasNext();

    public T next();
}
</code></pre>

<p>My iterator takes a type T which is an iterator. Here is my implementation (without remove) : </p>

<pre><code>public class IteratorOfIterator&lt;T extends Iterator&lt;T&gt;&gt; implements MyIterator&lt;T&gt; {

private T[] iterators;

private T currentIterator;

private int currentIndex;

public IteratorOfIterator(T[] iterators){
    this.iterators = iterators;
    this.currentIndex = 0;
    this.currentIterator = iterators[currentIndex];
}

public boolean hasNext() {
    return currentIndex &lt; iterators.length - 1 || currentIterator.hasNext();
}

public T next() {
    if(!this.currentIterator.hasNext()){
        currentIndex++;
        this.currentIterator = iterators[currentIndex];
    }
    return currentIterator.next();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to test my iterator but I have a type mismatch, how can I initialize it? Here is an example of I want to do: </p>

<p>This is a snippet of code from the script; $version is our software version, in this case 0.999.1, while $environment is the deployment environment, in this case Test.  $server is the server we are attempting to remove the scheduled task on.  Something that I find really odd is that if you look at the error above, it displays the $name we pass into the schtasks, yet when i reference it on the next line for diagnosing purposes, (the ""Removing , Exit code: 1"") it looks like $name is now empty.  This script is part of our build template, so it is run from our build server and runs the command against a remote machine.  Thoughts?</p>

<pre><code>public User CreateUser(User user)
        {
        //Create and return user
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Through remoting we are able to call this method in the service that takes in User object from our application.  The application references the same assembly that the service does for the User class but it forces a specific 1.0.0.0 version.</p>

<pre><code>CreateUser(User user);
</code></pre>

<p>We would like to change the existing assembly that is referenced from each project to add a new property ""Phone"" to the User class.  </p>

    {
        public User(string userName)
        {

        public string UserName { get; private set; }
        **public string Phone { get; set; }**
    }
</code></pre>

<p>We will increment the assembly version from 1.0.0.0 to 2.0.0.0.  The windows service will have a reference to the 2.0.0.0 version of the assembly in the GAC.  Because some of our clients are slow at upgrading and they force specific versions of the assembly or copy it local they will still be referencing the 1.0.0.0 version.  </p>

<p>With this change to the service assembly reference the marshaller that deserializes/serializes the object from the service to the application throws a serialization error. ""The formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: There was an error while trying to deserialize parameter...""</p>

<p>The change we made should be a non breaking change since we just added additional feature. Is there a way to allow the existing application continue and use the 1.0.0.0 version of the assembly and serialize the 2.0.0.0 without the new property down to them without some convoluted conversion on the service?  </p>

<p>We are using the following to connect over to our service</p>

That works, but it feels kinda messy because I now have some js in the static folder, and some js in the template files.</p>

<p>I could of course solve this by defining a <code>document.toUserId = {{ user.id }};</code> in the template and using that in the .js files, but yeah, that also feels kinda like a hack.</p>

The class contains a private static member variable for indicating whether the user entered any information. Each input method checks to see whether the user entered any information, and sets the status variable accordingly. I think this would be a good time to use the ternary operator. Unfortunately, I can't, because the compiler doesn't like that.</p>

<p>I replicated the problem, then simplified my code as much as was possible to make it easy to understand. This is not my original code. </p>

<p>Here's my header file:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

class Test {
public:
    void go ();
private:
    static const int GOOD = 0;
    static const int BAD = 1;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my implementation with the ternary operator:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""test.h""

void Test::go () {
    int num = 3;
    int localStatus;
    localStatus = (num &gt; 2) ? GOOD : BAD;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's main function:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include ""test.h""

using namespace std;

int main () {
    Test test = Test();
    test.go();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to compile this, I get this error message:</p>

<pre><code>test.o: In function `Test::go()':
test.cpp:(.text+0x17): undefined reference to `Test::GOOD'
test.cpp:(.text+0x1f): undefined reference to `Test::BAD'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I replace this:</p>

<pre><code>localStatus = (num &gt; 2) ? GOOD : BAD;
</code></pre>

<p>with this:</p>

<pre><code>if (num &gt; 2) {
    localStatus = GOOD;
} else {
    localStatus = BAD;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code compiles and runs as expected. What obscure C++ rule or GCC corner case is responsible for this lunacy? (I'm using GCC 4.4.1 on Ubuntu 9.10.)</p>

  &lt;td class='type'&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The thead and tbody are siblings, children of table.</p>

<p>The main problem is the tbody cols lose their width styling after the js call. Hints:</p>

<p>a) If I pause the js at the alert() I see the full table with the 4 cols formatted to the correct col widths for both thead and tbody. (But the .title div in the 1st col is aligned ""center"", not ""left"" as I expected.)</p>

<p>b) When I let the js complete I'll see the 1st 20 rows of the file as expected, but all cols in the tbody have lost their width style and revert to default browser col widths based on td content width. But the thead width styling remains OK.</p>

<p>After spending several days searching here and elsewhere for hints and getting nowhere I'm running out of options. I'd greatly appreciate any help from some fresh eyes not as red as mine are right now. (I hope as my 1st question I didn't put too much in here. It's probably something stupidly simple.)</p>

<pre><code>public interface StatusMessage extends Messages {
   String error(String username);

<p>which then loads the actual strings from a <strong>StatusMessage.property</strong> file:</p>

<p>This is a great solution, however my client is unbendable in his demand for putting the i18n strings in a database so they can be changed at runtime (though its not a requirement that they be changed realtime). </p>

<p>One solution is to create a async service which takes a <strong>message ID</strong> and <strong>user locale</strong> and returns a string. I have implemented this and find it terribly ugly (it introduces a huge amount of extra communication with the server, plus it makes property placeholder replacement rather complicated). </p>

<p>So my question is this, can I in some <strong>nice way</strong> implement a custom message provider that loads the messages from the backend in one big swoop (for the current user session). If it can also hook into the default GWT message mechanism, then I would be completely happy (i.e. so I can create a interface like above and keep using the the nice <strong>{0}, {1}...</strong> property replacement format). </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/12UF5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, if I call self.addChildViewController(child) in viewDidAppear() or in any other method after the container view is loaded, the table view is placed behind the UINavigationBar. In this approach I am adding the child view controller after a geolocation request. Is this a bug?</p>

<pre><code>class Container: UIViewController, CLLocationManagerDelegate {

    var locationManager = CLLocationManager()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        locationManager.delegate = self
        if locationManager.respondsToSelector(""requestWhenInUseAuthorization"") {
            locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
        }
        locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
    }

    func locationManager(manager: CLLocationManager!, didUpdateLocations locations: [AnyObject]!)
    {
        manager.stopUpdatingLocation()
        let vc = ViewController(nibName: ""View"", bundle: nil)
        self.addChildViewController(vc)
        vc.view.frame = self.view.frame
        self.view.addSubview(vc.view)
    }
}

<p>I am out of ideas, I have debugged the view bounds of both controllers, and everything has the same value. Any suggestions on how to obtain the first result by calling addChildViewController(...) after a container view controller is loaded? I would like to avoid changing the frame of the child view or the frame of the table view manually.</p>

My ellipse was generated using minVolEllipse.m (<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9542-minimum-volume-enclosing-ellipsoid"" rel=""nofollow"">Link 1</a>) which returns a matrix of the ellipse equation in the 'center form' and the center of the ellipse. I then use a snippet of code from Ellipse_plot.m (from the aforementioned link) to parameterize the vector into major/minor axes, generate a parametric equation, and generate a matrix of transformed coordinates. You can see their code to see how this is done. The result is a matrix that has index locations for points along the ellipse. It does not encompass every value along the outline of the ellipse unless I set the number of grid points, N, to a ridiculously high value.</p>

<p>When I use the MATLAB plot or patch commands I see exactly the result I'm looking for. However, I want this represented as a matrix of 0 values with 1s where patch 'fills in' the blanks. It is apparent that MATLAB has this functionality, but I have yet to find the code to execute it. What I am looking for is similar to how bwfill of the image processing toolbox works (<a href=""http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/doc/matlab/toolbox/images/bwfill.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Link 2</a>). bwfill does not work for me because my ellipse is not contiguous, so the function returns a matrix filled completely with 1 values.</p>

<p>Hopefully I have outlined the problem well enough, if not please comment and I can edit the post to clarify. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I have devised a strategy using the 2-D X vector from Ellipse_plot.m as an input to EllipseDirectFit.m (<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22684-ellipse-fit-direct-method"" rel=""nofollow"">Link 3</a>). This function returns the coefficients for the ellipse function ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+dy+f=0. Using these coefficients I calculate the angle between the x-axis and the major axis of the ellipse. This angle, along with the center and major/minor axes are passed into ellipseMatrix.m (<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17499-drawing-an-ellipse-into-a-matrix-image"" rel=""nofollow"">Link 4</a>), which returns a filled matrix. Unfortunately, the matrix appears to be out of rotation from what I want. Here is the portion of my code:</p>

<pre><code>N = 20; %Number of grid points in ellipse
ellipsepoints = clusterpoints(clusterpoints(:,1)==i,2:3)';
[A,C]         = minVolEllipse(ellipsepoints,0.001,N);

</code></pre>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>As a response to the suggestion from @BenVoigt, I have written a for-loop solution to the problem, here:</p>

<pre><code>N = 20; %Number of grid points in ellipse
ellipsepoints = clusterpoints(clusterpoints(:,1)==i,2:3)';
[A,C]         = minVolEllipse(ellipsepoints,0.001,N);

filled_mask = zeros([height width]);
for y=0:1:height
   for x=0:1:width
      point = ([x;y]-C)'*A*([x;y]-C);
      if point &lt; 1
         filled_mask(y,x) = 1;
      endif
   endfor
endfor
</code></pre>

<p>Although this is technically a solution to the problem, I am interested in a non-iterative solution. I'm running this script over many large images, and need it to be very fast and parallel. </p>

<p>EDIT 3:</p>

<p>Thanks @mathematical.coffee for this solution:</p>

<pre><code>[X,Y] = meshgrid(0:width,0:height);
fill_mask=arrayfun(@(x,y) ([x;y]-C)'*A*([x;y]-C),X,Y) &lt; 1;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I believe there is yet a better way to do this. Here is a for-loop implementation that I did that runs faster than both above attempts:</p>

<pre><code>ellip_mask = zeros([height width]);
[U D V] = svd(A);
a = 1/sqrt(D(1,1));
b = 1/sqrt(D(2,2));
maxab = ceil(max(a,b));

xstart = round(max(C(1)-maxab,1));
xend = round(min(C(1)+maxab,width));
ystart = round(max(C(2)-maxab,1));
yend = round(min(C(2)+maxab,height));

for y = ystart:1:yend
   for x = xstart:1:xend
      point = ([x;y]-C)'*A*([x;y]-C);
      if point &lt; 1
         ellip_mask(y,x) = 1;
      endif
   endfor
endfor
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to accomplish this goal (the total image size is still [width height]) without this for-loop? The reason this is faster is because I don't have to iterate over the entire image to determine if my point is within the ellipse. Instead, I can simply iterate over a square region that is the length of the center +/- the largest principle axis.</p>

<p>Greetings all,</p>

<p>I am writing a plugin which extends AbstractIssueSelectAction.  I noticed that <code>${issue.summary}</code>, etc are all available from within my velocity template, however, there are other things I wish to expose.  I can't figure out how to add other things to the velocity parameter map.  I even used a remote debugger to try to step through the stack and figure out what is going on - but it was pretty unclear to me both due to a deep stack and the fact that I wasn't able to correctly attach all of the source (and lots of the webwork stuff seems to be obfuscated).</p>

<p>I have posted this question on the Atlassian support forums also, I am just cross-posting here to get more eyes on the problem.</p>

<p>Example action code:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyOperation extends AbstractIssueSelectAction {

    // ...
    private final Issue myIssue;

    public String doCollect() throws Exception {
      log.debug(""Running doCollect()"");
      return ""collectinfo"";
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Example plugin config:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;webwork1 key=""unique_key"" name=""My Name"" class=""java.lang.Object""&gt;
   &lt;actions&gt;
    &lt;action name=""com.mycompany.jira.extensions.MyOperation"" alias=""MyOperation""&gt;
     &lt;view name=""collectinfo""&gt;/templates/myoperation-collectinfo.vm&lt;/view&gt;
     &lt;view name=""success""&gt;/templates/myoperation-success.vm&lt;/view&gt;
    &lt;/action&gt;
   &lt;/actions&gt;
  &lt;/webwork1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the velocity template, <code>${issue.summary}</code> correctly resolves to the current issue's summary, but if myIssue was some other issue, for example, I want to be able to use <code>${myIssue.summary}</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p><strong>Also, what options do you suggest I use?</strong>  This is a spring mvc so I have annotations like:</p>

<li>@Controller</li>
</ol>

<p>So any of those classes/fields should not be renamed I would imagine.</p>

<p>(My goal is just to make it a headache to someone who decompiles, such that they can't just decompile and use the code.  Obfuscating will let them use it, but they won't be able to maintain the codebase unless they re-write it.  I don't have any fancy algorithms so I have nothing really to hide in that respect.)</p>

<p><b>Update</b></p>

<p>Let me be clear here, my spring mvc using maven for some reason (I'm new to maven) when doing a mvn clean install produces both a myapp.war file and a exploded war myapp/ (this is what I want to deploy in production, not the myapp.war file)</p>

<p>My myapp folder has:</p>

<pre><code>/target/myapp/
/target/myapp/meta-inf (empty folder)
/target/myapp/web-inf
/target/myapp/web-inf/classes (com.myapp. ...)
/target/myapp/web-inf/lib/
/target/myapp/web-inf/ web.xml, application.xml (for spring)
/target/myapp/web-inf/views/
</code></pre>

<p>So proguard should be obfuscating in the /target/myapp/web-inf/classes folder right?
How do I tell it to do so?</p>

<p><b>Update 2</b></p>

<p>I'm getting this now:</p>

<p>OK, I am not getting:  failed to execute goal ...proguard .. Can't rename /Users/me/dev/git/project1/myapp/target/myapp/web-inf/classes (see my updates section for what I changed in my pom.xml)</p>

<p>Hopefully this is a simple question, basically I need to do this:</p>

<p>divider = 15</p>

<p>number = 50</p>

<p>Obviously 15 can be divided into 50 3 times with a remainder of 5, is there a simple way I can achieve this with math?</p>

<p>Obviously just dividing 50 by 15 will give me a rounded figure which I just want the lowest possible result and if there is anything left over and it's less than 15 just leave it alone.</p>

<p>Any help?</p>

<p>Cheers, 
Shannon</p>

<p>The software already has the concepts of ""Items"" and ""Groups"". Each Item belongs in a Group.  </p>

<p>The users of the system, in reality, belong to the same Groups.  This is currently not expressed in my domain model.</p>

<p>There are two levels of privileges I would like to extend to these users, View and Edit.  If they are in a Group, I would like them to be able to view the Items in that Group. If they have Edit privileges on that Group, I would like them to be able to Edit that Group's items.  </p>

<p>Users typically belong to 1 Group, but may at some point belong to multiple. It's possible a user may have View privileges on multiple Groups, but Edit privileges on only 1 (or some) of the Groups they can view. </p>

<p>I'm not sure how to tackle this.  Should I simply create 2 roles (using the asp.net role provider) for every group, i.e., Group1View, Group1Edit and so on?  Or should I create another table that creates a relationship between the aspnet_Users table and the Groups table, with a third column identifying their privilege level?</p>

<p>Eventually I would like to implement Privilege checks somewhat similar to what Steve Smith blogged about here: <a href=""http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/favor-privileges-over-role-checks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/favor-privileges-over-role-checks/</a></p>

<p>I'm having a hard time telling when both the Left and Right mouse buttons are pressed at the exact same time... I'm using a pair of bools, one for each button with the OnMouseDown and OnMouseUp events but if the 2 buttons are clicked at the exact same time (or really close), then only one MouseDown event goes off and the other does not... If you click and hold one of the buttons then click and hold the other, the code works though.</p>

<p>Alright, small story for why I messed this up (it worked all along).</p>

<p>I have a macbook pro running Windows 7. For those of you who don't know, the macbook pro has a single bar for a mouse button that normally left clicks, but if you place 2 fingers down it right clicks, so you can't do both (and no way to middle click). So I was building my app and sending it to my friend, he was telling me it wasn't working, so I posted this question. I finally decided to try it on my other laptop, a Dell XPS with 2 mouse buttons... Once it worked there I passed it along to other friends and they confirmed it worked. I don't know how my first friend messed it up, but moral of the story is don't buy anything Apple. At least that's the moral I got.</p>

The first thing that I noticed, was that when I attempted to run the startup script, I got the following error...</p>

<pre><code>touch: cannot touch `/opt/lib/apache-tomcat-7.0.35/logs/catalina.out': Permission denied
/opt/lib/apache-tomcat-7.0.35/bin/catalina.sh: 391: /opt/lib/apache-tomcat-7.0.35/bin/catalina.sh: cannot create /opt/lib/apache-tomcat-7.0.35/logs/catalina.out: Permission denied
</code></pre>

<p>This hadn't happened before, but whatever...I did a chmod catalina.out and the error went away. Unfortunately, I wasn't having any luck hitting the Tomcat manager (ie. :8080). I looked at the output from the startup script and noticed that JRE home was set to /usr, which didn't seem right, so I changed the Tomcat startup script to point JRE_HOME to /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-armhf. I still can't access the Tomcat manager, though. Furthermore when I look at the processes running on my Pi, Tomcat is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me with this?</p>

    title = Column(""title"", String(100))

<p>I have a list of channels, but they are detached objects. I get them using joinedload option because I maniputale those objects sometimes. When I do that, I update the object.</p>

<p>This time, I'm trying to add a new item to a detached channel object. This is the code:</p>

<pre><code>def insertXML(channels, strXml):
    """"""Insert a new channel given XML string""""""
    channel = Channel()
    session = rdb.Session()
    result = """"

    channel.fromXML(strXml)
    fillChannelTemplate(channel, channels)
    if channel.id == 0:
        session.add(channel)
        session.flush()
        channels.append(channel)
    else:
        for chan in channels:
            if chan.id == channel.id:
                chan.runtime = channel.runtime
                chan.modified = datetime.date.today()

                for item in channel.items:
                    if item.id == 0:
                        chan.items.append(item)

        session.merge(chan)
</code></pre>

<p>The item is inserted in the database, but It doesn't create the relation in channel_items.</p>

<p>Besides, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>FlushError: New instance &lt;Channel at 0xb75eeec&gt; with identity key 
     (&lt;class 'zeppelinlib.channel.ChannelTest.Channel'&gt;, (152,)) 
     conflicts with persistent instance &lt;Channel at 0xb598dec
</code></pre>

<p>This is a problem because the need to update the channel in both sides (sever and database), so if I get the error that object is not updated in server too.</p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>I want to add 1 page scroll feature using jQuery &amp; jQuery easing, that is powered by a font-awesome arrow.

<p>When I comment out the div in index, all font goes back to normal (it's blue when it's active). When I click on the button, it takes me to the element I want, but it drops you there, it doesn't have the easing aspect (which is why I am adding easing). </p>

<p>I have searched a fair amount, and I am baffled about this (especially the changing of the text). Any help would be very appreciated. </p>
