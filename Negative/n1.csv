<p>I need to do two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the uploaded bytes are really an image</li>
<li>Make sure that this image is 200px wide </li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I could accomplish this using a try/catch in the validation block:</p>

<pre><code>    public IEnumerable&lt;ValidationResult&gt; Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        try
        {
            System.Drawing.Image img = System.Drawing.Image.FromStream(this.ImageFile.InputStream);
            if (img.Width != 200)
                yield return new ValidationResult(""This picture isn't the right size!!!!"");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            yield return new ValidationResult(""This isn't a real image!"") ;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, in a real world production app I would put some lightweight validation in front of this to check the file extension to make sure it is a .jpg to find easy problems without invoking the expensive try/catch mechanism. But ultimately I need to be sure it's a good image, so I do need to make sure that Image.FromStream will parse it successfully.</p>

<p>The compiler doesn't like this approach and tells me that I can't yield return from a try/catch block. If I dispense with the yield return and return an IEnumerable directly I get another compiler error:</p>

<pre><code>        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            return new ValidationResult[] {new ValidationResult(""This isn't a real image!"") };
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This gives new error: ""Cannot return a value from an iterator. Use yield return statement...""</p>

<p>I like having the validation logic as part of the model, so I would hate to abandon the IValidatableObject approach, but I don't see a way to make it work.</p>

<p>This seems to be working great... But I'm comparing my output to what I get from a PHPMyAdmin and I'm noticing some slight differences. With my code, because of how I am using <code>addcslashes</code>, if a string contains a <code>'</code> it will escape it with <code>\'</code>. However, in the output from PHPMyAdmin, it will instead replace a single <code>'</code> with two single quotes <code>''</code> in a row.</p>

<p>Is there really a difference? Please look at the way I am escaping non-numeric fields and tell me if there is a better way.</p>

}

    my $tree = $parser -&gt; parse_file ($source_dir.""\\"".$xmlfiles);
    for my $Servers ($tree-&gt;findnodes ('/Servers')) {
        foreach my $Server ($Servers-&gt;findnodes('./Server')) {
            $hostname = $Server-&gt;findvalue('HostName');
            $hostIP = $Server-&gt;findvalue('HostIPAddress');
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to use this same approach by using the entire tag literally in the code, and got an ""XPath error: Invalid expression"".</p>

<p>So, there are really two problems--how do I navigate and extract when I DON'T care about the attribute, and how do I do it when the attribute is significant? Maybe this is an XPath question, but I simply can't relate XPath documentation to what I'm trying to do. Suggestions? </p>

is one (the Resource Manager will
have a reference to the resource),
unload the resource.</p></li>

<p>An interesting things is happening and I was hoping someone would be able to help me with it.</p>

<p>Visual Studio 2012 with Web Essentials installed was working fine until the latest update (the one where they removed less, coffeescript, etc.)</p>

<p>However since the update, I am having problems. This only happens when I open a project that has a file - which web essentials would act upon - already open.</p>

<p>If I close all of the tabs with cshtml/less/css files before I close a project. Then the next time I open that project, I am fine. I can even open those files, and web essentials kicks in with all of its extra features. But if even one of those files are open when the project was saved, and therefore opened automatically when the project is loaded, then the entire visual studio crashes.</p>

<p>The indicated answer (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10695139/sort-a-list-of-tuples-by-2nd-item-integer-value"">Idicated Duplicate</a>) is not in fact a duplicate, as it assumes a non-shifting index.
NOTICE THE NON-SYMMETRIC SETS (AS TUPLES) IN A LIST!
IF THIS, IN FACT IS A DUPLICATE QUESTION, PLEASE INDICATE THE ORIGINAL QUESITON!!!</p>

<p>Given a list of non-empty tuples, return a list sorted in increasing order by the <strong>last</strong> element in each tuple. e.g. [(1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (2, 2)] yields [(2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 7)] Hint: use a custom key= function to extract the last element form each tuple.</p>

<p>I'm not clear on how approach this.  I had the idea to create an array with the values of each final element in each tuple, then somehow using a parallel array with ints as the index ids of the original tuple as a key reference according to indices, but this feels very cumbersome and I'm certain there has to be a simpler (more flexible and clean) way to do this.</p>

<p>Also, I am getting some funky output from my ""custom key"" function, which leads me to believe I'm missing something.  Any help would be much appreciated.  Thank you in advance.  My poor code follows:</p>

<pre><code>def sort_last(tuple_list):              ###pass a list of tuples
  # +++your code here+++
  keyIndex = []
  keyList = []
  for t_item in tuple_list:                  ###for each tuple
    keyList.append(custKey(t_item))      ###
  print(keyList)
  return
##########################################
########### CUSTOM key= function #########
##########################################
def custKey(t):
  return t[len(t)-1]
</code></pre>

<p>Execution returns the following output.  Note the last list: doesn't compute in my brain!!! What am I missing</p>

<pre><code>sort_last
[3, 2, 1]
  X  got: None expected: [(2, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3)]

<p>Basically, the struts2 select drop down allows me to display the initial list and save the value, but does not get displayed correctly when I bring the page up to edit the object. Once the page is displayed, all select values display the default instead of the expected value. If I modify the select value and save the page again, it will correctly save the value. Somewhere, the tag is not properly setting the <code>SELECTED</code> value of the option list. I am able to view the correct change being persisted to the database, so I know the action is correctly receiving the object.</p>

<p>I believe the problem lies somewhere within the <code>&lt;s:select list=""lifeInsuranceStatuses"" name=""domainObject.lifeInsuranceCoverages[%{#status.index}].lifeInsuranceStatus.oid"" listKey=""oid"" listValue=""status"" theme=""simple"" /&gt;</code> line of the JSP, but I may be wrong.

However, I am not aware of any method to take full control of the enabled state of repurposed built-in controls. For me this poses a problem since I would like to implement some extended functionality in Excel and PowerPoint for which in some cases the alignment buttons make sense. But they are disabled by Excel/PowerPoint so repurposing them does not work.</p>

<p>Disabling built-in button that would be enabled by default is not a problem. Defining a getEnabled callback for the built-in button seems to do the trick - problem solved.</p>

<p>But how to enable built-in ribbon button that would be disabled by default? (getEnabled does not help here)</p>

<p>I suspect there is no ""VBA/VSTO way"" to accomplish the task? Do you think it would be possible using COM, e.g. via IAccessible? So far I have only found ways to enumerate, select and invoke the button commands but not to change their state.</p>

<p>Here is my code where I draw the glyphs: </p>

float offset = 0;
for(unsigned char c : str){
    Glyph g = this-&gt;_fonts[fontID]-&gt;getGlyph(c);

<p>I'm doing some transformations on <code>position</code> to move the origin to the top-left corner and flipping the coordinate system on the X-Axis. Then I divide every pixel value by a constant factor, to have the font having the same size on every resolution. The ratio of the glyphs is correct, but not the alignment. 
And here is my vertex shader: </p>

<pre><code>#version 400

layout(location=0) in vec4 vertPosition;
layout(location=1) in vec2 vertUV;

uniform vec2    position;
uniform vec2    scale;
uniform vec2    glyphSize;
uniform vec2    textureMetrics;
uniform vec2    textureOffset;

out vec2 fragUV;

void main(void){
    gl_Position = vertPosition * 
                  vec4(scale, 1, 1) + 
                  vec4(position, 0, 0);

    fragUV = vec2(vertUV.x * (glyphSize.x / textureMetrics.x) + (textureOffset.x / textureMetrics.x),

<p>I am using <a href=""https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSJsRoutingBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md"" rel=""nofollow"">FOSJsRoutingBundle</a>, in order to use route with ajax method.</p>

<p>When I click on the detail button, it returns me in a dialog tag with all detail I need.</p>

<p>This is the javascript code in order to retuns me the details in a dialog window:</p>

<pre><code>// dialog window behavior
(function() {
    var dialog = document.getElementById('window');
    // Array of the buttons.
    var showButtons = document.getElementsByClassName('showDetail');
    // Event handler
    var showDialog = function() {
      // Now you have to use the show button as base , to find the data you want to display...
      console.log(this);
      dialog.show();
    };
    var i, len = showButtons.length;
    for(i = 0; i &lt; len; ++i) {
        showButtons[i].onclick = showDialog;
    }
})();

//jax with FOSJsRouting
  $('.showDetail').click(function() {
    $.ajax({
      type: ""GET"",
      'url': Routing.generate('detailsPointsComptage', {'id': $(this).val()}),
      'success': function(loadDetail) {
          $('#window').html(loadDetail);
      }
    });
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Following the documentation, I expose my route to true argument in <code>app/config/config.yml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>fos_js_routing:
    routes_to_expose: [ detailsPointsComptage ]
</code></pre>

<p>And to be sure in my <code>routing.yml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>detailsPointsComptage:
    path:  /my/path/to/detail/{id}
    defaults: { _controller: MyBundle:MyController:detailsPointsComptage }
    requirements:
    methods: GET
    options:
        expose: true
</code></pre>

<p>When i click on the detail button, I have this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No route found for ""GET /my/path/to/detail""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the browser, with right click I can inspect all element. On the console tab I have this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;button class=​""btn btn-info btn-xs showDetail""</code>
  <code>href=​""/​symfony_app/​web/​my/​path/to/​detail/​1""&gt;​Detail​&lt;/button&gt;​</code> 
  <code>http://localhost/symfony/web/my/path/to/detail</code> Failed to load
  resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, if I follow the link <code>http://localhost/symfony/web/my/path/to/detail</code>, I have the error of route not found for GET, but if I write this url <code>http://localhost/symfony/web/my/path/to/detail/1</code> it returns me the right view.</p>

<p>Where am I wrong?</p>

<pre><code>    public static MyService ByteArrayToObject(byte[] arrBytes)
    {
        MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream(0);
        BinaryFormatter binForm = new BinaryFormatter();
        memStream.Write(arrBytes, 0, arrBytes.Length);

        memStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        //memStream.Position = 0;
        MyService obj = (MyService)binForm.Deserialize(memStream);
        return obj;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is when I want to Deserialize the object.</p>

<p>I test this string ""ABCDE"" , serialize  it in the card and the result hex is :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1C-5D-D2-00-27-11-02-00-00-00-05-00-00-00-05-00-00-00-01-41-00-42-00-43-00-44-00‌​-45-00</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WHILE the result when i serialize it on my pc is :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>00-01-00-00-00-FF-FF-FF-FF-01-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-06-01-00-00-00-05-41-42-43-44‌​-45-0B.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So on my PC application, deserializing the second one works well, but when i deserialize the first string (from smart card) I got : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The input stream is not a valid binary format. The starting contents (in bytes) are: 1C-5D-D2-00-27-11-02-00-00-00-05-00-00-00-05-00-00 ...""</p>

<p>First of all, the reason for offering generated passwords is to try prevent users from using weak passwords (e.g. <code>monkey</code>). I could (and still will) enforce certain restrictions on passwords: they must contain both lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and punctuation, and must be long enough. Enforcing these kinds of rules still leads to poor patterns, such as simply appending the required characters to the original weak password (e.g. <code>Monkey3!</code>). Also other common patterns exist (e.g. <code>m0nk3y</code>).</p>

<p>Totally random passwords (e.g. <code>I1ZkFdt5OOX35Rp</code> or <code>B13v}lo90m%~zrY</code>) are hard to remember. They usually end up written on a piece of paper. If given the choice, users will back to their own weak password when confronted with a monstrosity like this.</p>

<p>But, simple passwords can be strong, if long enough (<a href=""http://xkcd.com/936/"" rel=""nofollow"">yes, relevant xkcd</a>). I'd like to generate passwords like these, so that they're easy to remember while still strong:</p>

<pre><code>MooseCoolSuggestionDude
RegisterAmericaFoolDinner
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming I have a list of words for this stored somewhere, that storage could be compromised. Whoever got the list could generate all possible combinations that I'm offering to my users for use as a password. So it's a potential security risk.</p>

<p>I thought about some added randomisation. What if I added random numbers and punctuation to the generated passwords, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Moose5CoolSuggestion-Dude
Register.America31FoolDinner
</code></pre>

<p>Would this work as a secure way to offer memorable, automatically generated passwords? Any other ideas?</p>

I have two tables, AllMethods and RegisteredMethods. AllMethods has the total list of methods for a all projects. RegisteredMethods table has the list of methods of all the projects that are registered. The table structure is given below.</p>

<p>AllMethods Structure</p>

<pre><code>Project_Name || Method names || Project_URL  
US_Project      method1         some_URL
US_Project      method2         some_Url

Asia_Project    method1         some_Url
Asia_Project    method2         some_Url

<p>Now i want to get the count of methods for all the projects in both the tables, so that i can compare the methods that has been registered to the total methods. I want to do this in one single query. The result that i am looking at is something like this.</p>

<pre><code>Project_Name || Total_Methods || Registered_Methods
US_Project          3                  1

<p>I tried doing this with the below query:</p>

<pre><code>select count(AllMethods.Project_Name), count(RegisteredMethods.Project_Name),AllMethods.Project_Name from 
AllMethods,RegisteredMethods where AllMethods.Project_Name=RegisteredMethods.Project_Name group by AllMethods.Project_Name

When I get the data back, my success function (in JQuery) tries to turn the XML to JSON (using a plugin).  I was quickly reminded why I can't assume I would be getting VALID XML back from my AJAX request -- because it turns out a few of the XML responses were invalid -- causing the JSON conversion to fail, script to fail, etc...</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the best way to check for
valid XML on an AJAX response?  Or,
should I just attempt the JSON
conversion, then do a quick check if
the JSON object is valid?</li>
<li>In troubleshooting the XML, I found that there are a few strange characters at the VERY beginning of the XML response.  Here's an image from my Firebug:</li>

I set everything's up and it's almost doing what I want,but I have a big problem in validation.<br>
In my directive I can update both model and view value correctly, but the $required property associated to the input name doesn't change.<br>
Here's my directive code:</p>

<pre><code>appShared.directive('pikadayDatepicker', [function () {
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        scope:{
            ngModel: '='
        },
        link: function (scope, element, attrs) {
            var input = element[0];

            var updateFieldFunction = function (date) {
                scope.ngModel = date;
                scope.$apply();
            };

            var picker = new Pikaday({
                field: input,
                defaultDate: new Date(),
                setDefaultDate: true,
                onSelect: updateFieldFunction,
                minDate: moment(attrs.minDate, ""DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss"").toDate(),

    authUserFacade.create(newUser);
    addPrincipalToUser(newUser, role);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The actual problem</strong>
I can create the first user. But I can't create the second user . Notice that at the second user I use the existing role object, and only cascade a merge operation.</p>

<p>The strangest thing is that it says it duplicates the 2-AUTHUSER key where 2 is the id of the new user so cannot already be in the database. What is wrong with it or with Eclipselink or with Me?</p>

<p>And when i give it one request at a time it takes all of them

<p>So i don't have the guarantee that the files will finish to upload at different times , errrm ... how can i make my array to have all the file names uploaded without considering the finish time, perhaps using session is not a good approach?</p>

In <a href=""http://12factor.net/config"" rel=""nofollow"">Chapter 3 Config</a>, the author stresses that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variables (often shortened to env vars or env). Env vars are easy to change between deploys without changing any code; unlike config files, there is little chance of them being checked into the code repo accidentally; and unlike custom config files, or other config mechanisms such as Java System Properties, they are a language- and OS-agnostic standard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I'm wondering what this implies for Java projects.</strong></p>

<p>Typically, when it comes to my Java apps, I think of ""env vars"" as things that I can read from <code>System.getProperty(""blah"")</code>. Is this what the author is talking about? I don't think this is, because the author explicitly states ""<em>and unlike...or other config mechanisms such as Java System Properties...</em>"".</p>

<p>If not, what would be an example of an OS-agnostic ""env var"" that would satisfy this document's definition of ""env var""? How would I read it from inside Java code?</p>

<p>Either way, some process has to first set each env var on the OS, so that the var is set &amp; available by the time the app runs. What processes/methods could do this type of pre-run setup?</p>

I'm also using decimal columns, because, I was under the impression, those are stored as a different type, and the math is better on those.</p>

<p>So I have a query:
INSERT INTO mytable (identifier, amount) VALUES ('identifer', 'some_number') ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE amount = amount + some_number;</p>

<p>Basically - if we don't have a row, insert it, and if we do, add the some_number.</p>

<p>The some_number column is decimal(24,8)</p>

<p>When run this with some_number being equal to 72100312.72872099 and the current row is zeroed out at 0.00000000, the math winds up with the column being 72100312.72872100.</p>

<p>If some_number is 72100312.72872098 it works fine. If it's 72100312.72872101 its fine. If I do 11111111.72872099 its fine.</p>

<p>If the current row is not zero, but is instead .00000005, then72100312.72872099 adds fine and the total is 72100312.72872104 as expected.</p>

<p>It's like it's screwing up some math. And I thought decimal columns were immune to this.</p>

<p>Is there a way to fix this, or do the update in a better way? I'd REALLY rather not have to do a select, a bcadd, then an update. This type of line (insert on duoplicate update) appears in the code about 120 times. Thats a lot of retro-fitting to select/bcadd/update.</p>

<p>Addendum: Just read MySQL servers before 5.0 converted to floats for math. I'm on 5.5. Its not the &lt; 5.0 issue.</p>

<p>Edit2: Client version is mysqlnd 5.0.11 - not sure if that could be part of the issue? The server should be doing the math though, correct?</p>

"9726272","1","","","2012-03-15 18:55:07","","0","701","<p>I'm having a bit of trouble with some timers in my project. Our project has been on hold for a while, and we recently upgraded from XCode 3.2.6 to XCode 4.2.1. This is one of the issues that has emerged from that migration. This code appeared to function correctly before the switch... now the timers are not being invalidated correctly for some reason which is resulting in two errors.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The chime continues to play at all times after it's started, even on other screens of the game. </p></li>
<li><p>Each time the screen appears, another instance of the timer is created and not destroyed, causing the countup and chime speed to happen faster than before.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This behavior is taking place in a View Controller which is used for an end of level screen. In ViewWillAppear I create a timer </p>

<pre><code>    EOLWinCountupTimer = [[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval: 0.10
                                                       target: self
                                                     selector: @selector(countUpSequence)
                                                     userInfo: nil
                                                      repeats: YES]retain];
</code></pre>

<p>This timer calls a selector that sequences some score countups on labels and plays a chime, and turns on and off a few views.  At the end of the sequence I do this to stop the timer. This code also is repeated in ViewWillDisappear to make sure the timers stop if the player moves on before the sequence is finished. </p>

<pre><code>if (EOLWinCountupTimer != nil &amp;&amp; [EOLWinCountupTimer isValid])

The reason for this is that through LabView I'm generating a 16-bit grayscale PNG file, in which each bin represents a certain height from a measurement. I would like to write the min, max, and bin step in terms of height into the custom data ""areas"" of the PNG file. From what I've seen, LabView's IMAQ vision tools allow to write it, but I need to read it with ImageJ.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>

<p>Let me clarify.</p>

<p>Not just custom classes.. I already use custom classes which extend Doctrine_Record.</p>

<pre><code>class Model_User extends Doctrine_Record {}

$foo = new Model_User;
</code></pre>

<p>Much of my application currently works around this and will not be changing in that respect.</p>

<p>However, I would like to <strong>ALSO</strong> use <a href=""http://readthedocs.org/docs/doctrine/en/latest/en/manual/component-overview.html#custom-table-classes"" rel=""nofollow"">Custom Tables</a></p>

<pre><code>class UserTable extends Doctrine_Table {}

$bar = Doctrine_Core::getTable('User');
</code></pre>

<p>But, as soon as I enable this (custom table classes) feature to call classes of Doctrine_Table utilising the Table suffix.  Any Doctrine_Record classes I've previously extended and called directly, stops working!  I want to make use of both!</p>

"25289499","1","","","2014-08-13 14:56:39","","0","29","<p>Before I show you code let me explain it really quick:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are 3 models: Payment, Publication and Client. </li>
<li>Client <code>has_many :payments</code>, Publication <code>has_one :payment</code> and Payment <code>belongs_to</code> both of them</li>
<li>Publication <code>has_one :user</code> through other models ;)</li>
<li>Client has field <code>balance</code> which represents money/funds (like bank account). Balance must <strong>NOT</strong> be below 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>So how it does <em>(not)</em> work now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Controller calls <code>Publication.create</code> with arguments which contains inter alia <code>price</code>.</li>
<li>Method <code>before_create :create_payment</code> inside <code>Publication</code> is called. This method contains only this line of code: <code>Payment.create(client: client, amount: price, publication: self)</code></li>
<li>We are inside <code>Payment</code> class now. Inside this class there is <code>before_create :update_client_balance</code>. This method calls <code>client.balance + amount</code> <em>(amount represents price)</em> and then client.save</li>
<li>Now we go to <code>Client</code> model which should validate is <code>balance</code> <code>numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 0,</code></li>
<li>If balance would be below 0 none of all actions should be rollbacked. I mean both <code>Publication</code> and <code>Payment</code> should <strong>NOT</strong> be created and <code>Client</code> balance should be unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem shows up in <code>before_create :create_payment</code> inside <code>Publication</code> class. So  in order to proper association I need to send <code>Publication.id</code> to <code>Payment</code> model. But sending <code>self</code> doesn't seem to work now. What is more: while running this code (so on <code>Publication.create()</code>) callback <code>create_payment</code> goes to infinite loop! Payment isn't ever created.</p>

<p>When I started to think about I assumed it shouldn't all happen in <code>AR callbacks</code> (should it?). I started to think about creating custom <code>service</code> to it (plain old ruby object) but I'm not sure about it. I'm trying to keep highest encapsulation between all classes (they should all care about themselves on their own [so I guess <code>Publication</code> should ask for <code>Client</code> balance... <code>Client</code> should care about it in <code>validate_numicality_of</code>.])</p>

<p>The question is: should still stick with <code>before_create</code> in situation described above? </p>

<ul>
<li>If yes what's the best solution to make it work. </li>
<li>If no what's the best place and method to make it work?</li>
</ul>

"31339461","1","31342603","","2015-07-10 11:19:16","","0","34","<p>I am trying to use the copyField directive in Solr to copy some fields into a catch-all field for searching. Unfortunately the field does not seem to be populated via the copyField directives at all.</p>

<p>Here are my source fields:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;field name=""firstName"" type=""text_general"" indexed=""true"" stored=""true"" required=""false"" /&gt; 
    &lt;field name=""lastName"" type=""text_general"" indexed=""true"" stored=""true"" required=""false"" /&gt; 
    &lt;field name=""postCode"" type=""text_general"" indexed=""true"" stored=""true"" required=""false"" /&gt;
    &lt;field name=""emailAddress"" type=""text_general"" indexed=""true"" stored=""true"" required=""false"" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- suggest field --&gt;
    &lt;field name=""name_Search"" type=""textSuggest"" indexed=""true"" stored=""true"" multiValued=""true"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here are my copyField directives:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- copy fields --&gt;
&lt;copyfield source=""firstName"" dest=""name_Search"" /&gt;
&lt;copyfield source=""lastName"" dest=""name_Search"" /&gt;
&lt;copyfield source=""emailAddress"" dest=""name_Search"" /&gt;
&lt;copyfield source=""postCode"" dest=""name_Search"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now running a query on the ""name_Search"" field does not yield any results, and the field does not appear in the schema browser.</p>

<p>Do I need to do anything else to get copyField working? I am running Solr v5.2.1.</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>Here is the textSuggest field type used for the catch-all field:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fieldType class=""solr.TextField"" name=""textSuggest"" positionIncrementGap=""100""&gt;
  &lt;analyzer&gt;
    &lt;tokenizer class=""solr.StandardTokenizerFactory""/&gt;
    &lt;filter class=""solr.StandardFilterFactory""/&gt;
    &lt;filter class=""solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory""/&gt;
  &lt;/analyzer&gt;
&lt;/fieldType&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the SolrConfig.xml, have configured the suggest handler as follows:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;searchComponent name=""suggest"" class=""solr.SuggestComponent""&gt;
&lt;lst name=""suggester""&gt;
  &lt;str name=""name""&gt;default&lt;/str&gt;
  &lt;str name=""lookupImpl""&gt;FuzzyLookupFactory&lt;/str&gt;      
  &lt;str name=""dictionaryImpl""&gt;DocumentDictionaryFactory&lt;/str&gt;
  &lt;str name=""field""&gt;name_Search&lt;/str&gt;
  &lt;str name=""suggestAnalyzerFieldType""&gt;textSuggest&lt;/str&gt;
  &lt;str name=""buildOnStartup""&gt;true&lt;/str&gt;
  &lt;str name=""buildOnCommit""&gt;true&lt;/str&gt;
&lt;/lst&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>  &lt;requestHandler name=""/suggest"" class=""solr.SearchHandler"" startup=""lazy"" &gt;
&lt;lst name=""defaults""&gt;
  &lt;str name=""suggest""&gt;true&lt;/str&gt;
  &lt;str name=""suggest.count""&gt;10&lt;/str&gt;
&lt;/lst&gt;
&lt;arr name=""components""&gt;
  &lt;str&gt;suggest&lt;/str&gt;
&lt;/arr&gt;
  &lt;/requestHandler&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I know the suggest handler works, as if I explicitly fill the 'name_Search' field, then I can get results as expected.</p>

Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>import httplib
from string import lower
from google.appengine.api import urlfetch
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests


def findTitle(number):
    url = 'http://suskeenwiske.ophetwww.net/albums/4kl/lijst.php'
    source_code = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(source_code.text, ""html.parser"")
    for ol in soup.findAll('ol'):
        for li in ol.findAll('a', href=True):
            if str(number) in li['href']:
                return unicode(li.contents[0])


def findImage(number, title):
    host = 'http://www.suskeenwiske.be/comics/'
    parsed_title = lower(title).replace("" "", ""-"")
    path = str(number) + '-' + parsed_title
    url = host + path
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    div = soup.findAll('div', {'class': 'singl-img'})[0]
    img = div.findAll(""img"")[0]
    img_url = img['src']
    return urlfetch.Fetch(img_url).content


def readNumbers(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    return [line.rstrip() for line in lines]


def getStatusCode(host, path=""/""):
    try:
        conn = httplib.HTTPConnection(host)
        conn.request(""GET"", path)
        return conn.getresponse().status
    except StandardError:
        return None
</code></pre>

<p>So here's the problem: When I run the code directly calling `findImage(150, findTitle(150))' it works fine, the image and title are retreived. However, when calling it from flask (running from the Google App Engine Launcher) the host is duplicated thus resulting in the error: </p>

<pre><code>ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', error('An error occured while connecting to the server: Unable to fetch URL: http://www.suskeenwiske.behttp/www.suskeenwiske.be/comics/88-de-tamtamkloppers Error: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed',))
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why this happens but this only happens when running the code with the Googe App Engine launcher. When running the code directly (calling the function from the interpreter) it works fine.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a clue as to what I'm missing here? What could be causing this?</p>

"14422367","1","","","2013-01-20 06:50:21","","0","202","<p>I have created a class that implements IErrorHandler and IServiceBehavior. I add the behavior to my ServiceHost and run it.</p>

<p>The reason I got around to trying to learn about IErrorHandler is because the frustration I was having in having to wrap all of my service code that interfaces with callback channels in try catch statements, and wondered if there was a global way to catch the exceptions.</p>

<p>Well from what I read here on StackOverflow, I saw that it is indeed the thing I want.</p>

<p>In execution however, it's confusing me greatly. If I have a contract method that does the following...</p>

<pre><code>    Dictionary&lt;IChatCallback, string&gt; userChannels = new Dictionary&lt;IChatCallback, string&gt;();

    public void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        IChatCallback callback = OperationContext.Current.GetCallbackChannel&lt;IChatCallback&gt;();
        string senderName = userChannels[callback];

        SendMessageToAllUsers(message, senderName);
    }

    public void SendMessageToAllUsers(string message, string sender)
    {
        foreach (var userChannel in userChannels.Keys)
        {
            userChannel.ReceiveMessage(new ChatMessage(message, sender));
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If a client is on my server and he drops off the face of the earth and the channel faults, it seems to take a while before my server realizes that the channel is faulted. Even if am subscribed to the events of the ICommunicationObject, it seems to take a while before the server realizes the channel is faulted. For example, if someone is sending messages and someone disconnects, and a message is being propagated at the same time.</p>

<p>Now, I have another method that essentially pings clients at a regular interval to figure out if they're still there or not, so I can remove them from the <code>userChannel</code> dictionary.</p>

<p>How exactly is IErrorHandler supposed to help me here? It seems that it's not exactly helping my service from crashing even if it catches the error. Because my service cannot ping my clients at a super rapid pace, sometimes a message seems to come in immediately(I was testing this) after a previous message that threw an exception. It seemed to have handled the first one, but the second one threw another exception that wasn't caught, and my service crashed, because the server was trying to communicate with a faulted channel. Now, my service DOES clean up those faulted channels, but it does so periodically.</p>

<p>I was hoping that by implementing IErrorHandler I could avoid having to wrap all of my methods in try{}catch{} blocks... but it seems like I still have to, to check if I'm communicating with a faulted channel?</p>

<p>Or maybe I'm just going about using IErrorHandler improperly and thinking it should be doing things it's not supposed to do. Should I maybe have my service implement it, and inject itself into the Servicehost as the IServiceBehavior? And then in my HandleError() method remove the channel from my list of clients? That seems kind of messy, because I'm putting that WCF plumbing stuff in my service class, but that would be the only way I can think of to have the exception code itself remove the channel from the list of callbacks.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do a lot of reading because I'm new to it, but it seems like the world of Error Handling in WCF is daunting.</p>

<p>Even if I try to remove the channel so it's not called on services via subscribing to the Faulted event, it doesn't work fast enough and still throws exception that the server cannot seem to recover from even with IErrorHandler.</p>

<p>For example, when the user first connects, I subscribe to the event.</p>

<pre><code>        IChatCallback callback = OperationContext.Current.GetCallbackChannel&lt;IChatCallback&gt;();
        ICommunicationObject callbackComm = (ICommunicationObject) callback;
        callbackComm.Faulted += (sender, e) =&gt;
            {
                lock (lockObject)
                {
                    string name = userChannels[callback];
                    userChannels.Remove(callback);
                    NotifyOfUserDisconnect(name);
                }
            };
</code></pre>

<p>Do I just need to go into all my methods and check if the channel is closed or faulted, and wrapping everything in a try/catch block to remove the reference and notify clients?</p>

<p>Since there is no stack trace, I can't figure out why the Facebook SDK failed to bring up the login dialog. Other SO posts say that these log messages indicate a memory leak, but I haven't done anything in the app yet besides try to log into Facebook, so it must be an SDK problem if it is a memory leak. </p>

<p>There is a problem with the following line</p>

<p>and the <code>if(!(tokens[i+2].isEmpty()))</code> Actually it says: </p>

<p>Does that happen because of the last word in the file where there are no two words after? If my guess is right , how can I correct that so I can stop in the last word of the file. If my guess is wrong let me know the reason.

<p>Of course, in file, there is much more of them.
I would like group it by savingsBalance. What I am doing:</p>

<p>firstly I load data from file:</p>

<pre><code>var jsonStringCensus = File.ReadAllText(""C:\\...\\Census.json"");
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have to deserialize it:</p>

<pre><code>var censuses = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Census&gt;&gt;(jsonStringCensus);
</code></pre>

<p>I can print it into console:</p>

<pre><code>var data = censuses.Select(x =&gt; string.Format(""{0} {1}"" ,x.state, x.savingsBalance.Substring(1)));
var dataPrintable = averageSavingBalancePerState.Select(x =&gt; string.Format(""{0} {1}"", x.Key));

Console.WriteLine(dataPrintable);
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, I would like group it by state and print average savingsBalances:</p>

<pre><code>var dataDouble =
            from w in censuses
            group w by w.state into g
            select new { GState = g.Key, Average = g.Average(p =&gt; { double a; a = Convert.ToDouble(p.savingsBalance); return a; }) };


    foreach (var g in dataDouble)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""The state '{0}':"", g.GState);
        foreach (var w in g.Average.ToString())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(w);
        }
    }

<p>I guess the problem is due to the fact that the second array is larger than the first one, since this works:</p>

<p>One way to solve the problem would be to create the entire tiled array, but that would be a large array which I am trying to avoid. All the points in my example lie in the cell, any idea how to implement the interpolation?</p>

<p>My current output using this SQL Statement <code>ORDER BY CAST(reason AS UNSIGNED), reason</code> (where ""reason"" are strings) is</p>

<p>In iPhone UI, this is where disclosure indicator arrows are included, but it feels wrong to copy/paste that idea into an Android application.  When we include section headers, they are usually visually different enough (different size and background) to make this point, but what about in cases where only some of the list elements lead to more information?</p>

<ol>
<li>The user will select from the photos within the iPhone (via ALAssets).  This part is fine.</li>
<li>The selected photo will appear on another view, within a smaller, rectangular subview.</li>
<li>When using the ALAsset thumbnail, the image shows up correctly within the subview.  However, the resolution is poor, so I'm trying to use a higher resolution image.</li>
<li>When using the full resolution image, and then placing it into the view, any portrait photo will be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>Code-wise, this it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//ImageView is the UIImageView subview that will hold the selected photo image.
//This code works ok, but I'd rather have a higher resolution photo.
[imageView setClipsToBounds:YES];
[imageView setContentMode:UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill];
[imageView setImage:[UIImage imageWithCGImage:[selectedPhoto thumbnail]];
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is the code where I try to use a higher resolution image, but then the image within imageView is rotated -90 degrees:</p>

<pre><code>[imageView setClipsToBounds:YES];
[imageView setContentMode:UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill];

//HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGE
ALAssetRepresentation *rep = [selectedPhoto defaultRepresentation];
CGImageRef iref = [rep fullResolutionImage];
if (iref) 
{
   UIImage *largeImage = [Utilities imageWithImage:[UIImage imageWithCGImage:iref] scaledToSize:CGSizeMake(CGImageGetWidth(iref)/4, CGImageGetHeight(iref)/4)]; 
   [imageView setImage:largeImage];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the imageWithImage: function called there looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>+ (UIImage *)imageWithImage:(UIImage *)image scaledToSize:(CGSize)newSize {
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(newSize);
    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, newSize.width, newSize.height)];
    UIImage *newImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();    
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
    return newImage;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned, photos taken in landscape orientation by the iPhone camera come out OK.  However, photos taken in portrait camera orientation come out rotated -90 degrees somehow.</p>

<p>How can I make it so that each photo, whether taken in portrait or landscape, will come out oriented correctly on my ImageView?  </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated!  Thank you!</p>

However, the open method always returns an InputStream object, no matter which access mode was requested.

    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height)];

<p>Because of the Navigation-based App, most of the views have a <strong>height</strong> of <strong>436px</strong> (= ScreenSize - NavigationBar height, as you probably know ;). </p>

<p>I got one view similar to the photo app overview showing all the thumbnails, from there I push a viewcontroller containing the scroll view (like in photos app) on the stack, like so</p>

<pre><code>- (void)buttonPressed:(id)sender 
{
    UIButton *btn = (UIButton *)sender;
    PhotoSetScrollViewController *psc = [[PhotoSetScrollViewController alloc] initWithPhotoArray:photos andID:btn.tag];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:psc animated:YES]; 
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problem 1</strong>:
The view holding the fullscreen scrollview has a <strong>height</strong> of <strong>480px</strong> which seems to be a problem because when poping the viewcontroller by hitting the back button, the view containing the thumbnails (height <strong>436px</strong>) moves upward below the navigation bar. And also the Toolbar keeps showing. What could be the problem?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The fullscreen scrollview is also moving when the navigation and toolbar are shown (hidden initially). And even without the custom navigationbar i get the views floating around. That is weird.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2</strong>: 
How could I switch between my custom navigation bar and the standard black translucent style?</p>

<p>So my question essentially is ""Why does this happen"", according to the rules about constexpr-s. ""this"" is the following.</p>

<p>In one of the constexpr functions, if a parameter is used directly then there is no problem with this parameter being used in a compile-time computation. (example lines 2)</p>

<p>When the same parameter is used as an argument to another constexpr-function, then the compiler complaints that this expression (the parameter id) is not a constexpr. (example line 3)</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; constexpr std::size size (T obj) { return obj.size(); }
template &lt;typename T&gt; constexpr auto sz1 (T obj) { return std::make_index_sequence&lt; obj.size() &gt; { }.size(); } // OK ...
template &lt;typename T&gt; constexpr auto sz2 (T obj) { return std::make_index_sequence&lt; size(obj) &gt; { }.size(); } // ERROR
  // ""obj"" is [suddenly] not a constexpr
</code></pre>

<p>This happens with both g++-4.9.1 and clang++-3.4.2 .</p>

<p>Below is a small test program for quick and easy experimentation.</p>

<hr>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;utility&gt;

template &lt;typename...&gt; constexpr void noop (void) { }

// size() wrappers
template &lt;typename T&gt; constexpr std::size_t size (T obj) { return obj.size(); }
template &lt;typename T&gt; constexpr auto sz1 (T obj) { return size(require_constexpr&lt; obj.size() &gt; { }); }

int main0 (int, char**)

  constexpr auto const ar = std::array&lt;int, 4u&gt; { 4, 5, 6, 7 };

  // Check constexpr-computability of size(), sz1() and the expansion of sz2()
  noop&lt;
    require_constexpr&lt;

      size(require_constexpr&lt; size(ar)  &gt; { })
    &gt;
  &gt;();

  // But this is an error
  // ERROR: ""obj"" is not a constexpr in sz2()
//noop&lt; require_constexpr&lt; sz2(ar) &gt; &gt;();

  return 0;

<pre><code>def chunker(seq, size):
    return (seq[pos:pos + size] for pos in xrange(0, len(seq), size))
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone explains me how the return works when is followed by a for loop?
I tried to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>def chunker2(seq, size):
    for pos in xrange(0, len(seq), size):
    return seq[pos:pos + size]
</code></pre>

<p>but I don't get the same result.
Note than in Nosklo example, <code>chunker()</code> is called iteratively like in the example below:</p>

<pre><code>animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit', 'duck', 'bird', 'cow', 'gnu', 'fish']
for group in chunker(animals, 3):
    print group
</code></pre>

<p>By adding prints, I noticed that the latter <code>for</code> loop is executed 3 times (it goes trhough the <code>animals</code> list), but the for loop in <code>chunker</code> function is executed only once. So, how come there is only one return and I can see 3 prints?</p>

Maybe there's an option to switch to a different relational database that features both, but I don't see that as an option right now.</p>

<p>So, the sharding idea seems like a pretty decent thing. But, what's a good approach to do this on a application level?</p>

<p>I am guessing that a take-off point would be to prefix tables with a max value for the primary key in each table. Something like <code>products_4000000</code> , <code>products_8000000</code> and <code>products_12000000</code>. Then the application would have to check with a simple if-statement the size of the id (PK) that will be requested is smaller then four, eight or twelve million before doing any actual database calls.</p>

<p>So, is this a step in the right direction or are we doing something really stupid?</p>

<p>Update:<br>
Consistent hashing might also be an idea to share rows between multiple tables based on a primary key or similar.
Another option might be to introduce the sharding at database level. I do not know enough about triggers/views or whatever is used to make this happen.</p>

<li>power law; </li>
<li>exponential.</li>

<p>When I have to fit a power law (the most probable in my study), I do not know how to do it correctly. This is what I have done. I have applied the log function to all <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and I have tried to fit it with a linear polynomial. If the error (val) is lower than the others polynomial tried before, I choose the power law function(naturally if m of the line is negative). Am I correct? </p>

<p>Now how can I reconstruct my power law starting from the line <code>y = mx + q</code> in order to draw it with the original points? I need also to display the function found.</p>

<p>In response the value of output parameter is null. In case, of any error the Stderr will return the error information. on successful execution of the code the output parameter should contain the output of code you executed.
To check the execution of the Web service is used SOAPUI. Here is the request that i used to submit the code on the web service:</p>

<p>I've create that <strong><em>VM</em></strong> with an unique purpose, I would like to be able to use <strong><em>Microsoft Help Viewer</em></strong> (or other alternative software, if exist) in my host <em>OS</em> without resinstalling <strong><em>VS2013</em></strong> in my <em>OS</em>.</p>

<p>...So in a very basic intent of reverse engineering to be able to use <strong>Microsoft Help viewer</strong> in my host <em>OS</em> I've just copied these folders from the <em>VM</em> to my <em>PC</em>:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Help Viewer
</code></pre>

<p>And</p>

<pre><code>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\HelpLibrary2
</code></pre>

<p>And added these keys:</p>

<pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Help]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Help\v2.1]

""AppRoot""=""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Help Viewer\\v2.1\\""
""Install""=dword:00000001
""Version""=""2.1.21005""
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the value:</p>

<pre><code>""DefaultHelpViewerCLSID""=""{FE220E43-FE17-47BE-A57E-84D2B9A5635D}""
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know what reffers that CLSID but a search on the registry of the VM with the search pattern <code>FE220E43-FE17-47BE-A57E-84D2B9A5635D</code> does not find anything (but the help viewer works properlly on the VM):</p>

<p>And I launch the Help Viewer (from commandline) with the same arguments as I get in the VM:</p>

<pre><code>HlpViewer.exe /CatalogName VisualStudio12 /Locale en-US /Sku 3000 /LaunchingApp Microsoft,VisualStudio,12.0 /Manage
</code></pre>

<p>But when I press the <code>Update</code> button in the <strong>Help Viewer</strong> to download a package, just does nothing (of nothing) any error is shown or something else, just anything, so I can't download documentation or know what error I'm having.</p>

<p>Any idea to resolve this strange problem? maybe I need a missing component to copy on my host <em>OS</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Help Viewer</strong> can be just downloaded and installed as a standalone application?</p>

<p>Any alternative Software to replace <strong>Microsoft Help Viewer</strong>?</p>

<p>I've tried to use <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4c360395-6afd-4087-94ed-cbcbebe04a20"" rel=""nofollow"">H3Viewer</a> but seems that it's only for VS2010, when I try to use the library manager the program says that I have not VS2010 Help installed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've solved the issue by downloading the documentation on the VM and copying them into my OS, but anyways I would like to know a solution for this problem.</p>

<p>Say there is an elaborate website using Javascript, where you register, have your own profile etc. It asks you to register for one of a few time slots. You do it by clicking a hyperlink, which has this annoying feature (discussed elsewhere on this website, see here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9851372/how-can-url-be-hidden-in-hyperlink-when-mouse-hover"">how can url be hidden in hyperlink when mouse hover</a> ) that it hides the link. Is there a way to uncover it?</p>

<p>By uncover I mean a way in which I would be able to register for a given time slot without clicking the hyperlink, but rather via copying that hidden link (or typing it in) to the address bar of the browser. I have tried using Firebug and Tamper Data, but to no success. Both programmes provided me with viable candidates for links, but when I copied them to address bar and pressed enter, it didn't result in a registration for a given time slot. </p>

<p>Finally, Tamper Data tells me that 'Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded', whereas Firebug indicates that 'enctype=""multipart/form-data"" right above the table with hyperlinks, so I begin to think there is some sort of encryption in place which is meant to prevent me from getting what I want. And I'm sure owners of this website would want to prevent me, but are they able to do it?</p>

<p>So all in all, is it even doable? Apologies if this all sounds too broad, I'll be more than happy to make it (or at least try to make it) more clear.</p>

        syncFunc(c, function() {
            syncFunc(.....)

<p>Is it now possible to shorten this somehow? My first idea was using a for loop, like:</p>

<pre><code>syncParams = [a, b, c, ...];
for(var i = 0;; i++) {
    syncFunc(syncParams[i], function() {
        if(i &lt; syncParams.length - 1) {

<p>But obviously this does not work as there's no connection for the continue and break to the loop. My other idea was using an interval to check every second if one async call is finished and then call the next one with the next parameter, but this seems too complicated. Is there any easy way without using some library?</p>

In a 2-3 week process of learning MySQL and attempting to get a Python stock info scrapping program to feed data into a MySQL schema (database, table) I’m having serious difficulties with connections.  I believe I’ve now uncovered the source of my problems.  It appears that something is happening during the communication process between my Python script and the MySQL table.  I’ll be looking into this further; however, in the meantime, after running the Python script I refreshed the MySQL table to confirm that the data had been written successfully; at that point I got the message that the communication link to the database had cratered.  Checking Windows services showed that the appropriate service was stopped.  Attempting to restart the windows service resulted in </p>

<ol>
<li>Message saying the service was starting, followed by </li>
<li>Message saying “start pending” followed by </li>
<li>Message saying “service stopped. (I’m writing this from memory, so the wording will not be exact)</li>
</ol>

<p>I spent 20-30 minutes trying various restart method from within Workbench and focusing on the Windows service to no avail.  Finally, I did a full restart on my computer after closing all open applications.  After the full restart, everything was back to normal.  The MySQL windows service was “running” and communication was reestablished to the MySQL database.</p>

<p>So, The real question is:<br>
<strong>Is shutting down my computer and restarting the only way to reestablish communications or is there a less drastic method?</strong></p>

<p>My setup parameters are pretty vanilla with the exception that I’m putting the MySQL program on my D: drive as opposed to the C: drive (an SSD reserved for the operating sys).</p>

<p><strong>System:</strong> Windows 8 64bit on a Xeon Ivy Bridge processor, large SSD’s, large HD’s, mucho RAM, dual X-fired video cards, ASUS Sabertooth MB (self-built a yr ago)</p>

<p><strong>Software:</strong> MySQL 5.7, complete installation except for module for Visual Basic and Python3 (running 2.7).  Attempting to use the above hardware as both a server &amp; client.</p>

I have found a lot of pages describing horrible architectures and asking for about the same thing as I do, but my intended usage is different so please bear with me :-)</p>

<p>I have a Spring 2.5 project using annotation based form controllers basically like this:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(""/edit/someObject"")
public String handleSubmit(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, SomeObject someObject, BindingResult result) {

    // Some check here

    if(result.hasErrors()) {
        return ""form"";
    } else {
        SomeObjectService.update(someObject);
        return ""redirect:/view/someObject"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this I check for some http property in the HttpServletRequest and use the HttpServletResponse to send a redirect if this property has a certain value. This check is done is a lot (but not all) of the form controllers in this application. What I would like to do is create a @CheckedSubmit annotation handled by some AOP advice to do this check and then drop the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse parameters from the controller.</p>

<p>My problem is that I have no idea how to access the current HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse from this AOP advice without using these two as (unused) parameters to the annotated method, which is what I tried to avoid in the first place.</p>

<p>Summary: How to access the HttpServletRequest/Response from AOP advice on an @RequestMapping annotated method?</p>

<p>I have an API endpoint <code>/submissions</code>, when this is hit, the code in <code>submissionsBot.js</code> is triggered. This code should:
    1) Go to Submittable.com API to receive data package.
    2) Decipher the data and put into appropriate 'people' containers.
    3) Prepare the payload to be sent into slack.
    4) Send the data as a POST to the Slack API.</p>

<p>As a big picture question. Is it appropriate to declare the functions below the module, and then execute them from within the Module? Are there fundamental errors to the way I am designing this module?</p>

<p><code>UPDATE</code> I have updated the question with the working code, however it still feels a bit messy and I would love some feedback. The API calls are working. However, my payload is still a bit off. I think the error may be within the <code>peopleCipher</code> function.

What numerical value refers to good code, what to really bad code?  Searching the internet gives some <a href=""http://mindref.blogspot.ch/2010/06/python-pymetrics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">hints</a>, but I am not sure if the classification refers to metric (1) or metric (2). I want to have a meaning for both of these numbers.</p>

<p>Create processing screen with some custom icons, label etc. with following behaviour.</p>

<li><p>When this view is displayed all other operation like adding subview, performing segue etc should work as they work normally but below my loading view.</p></li>
<li><p>Want method showProcessingScreen to work on any thread (Whatever thread switching code etc should be in respective show/hide method).</p></li>
<li>It should be displayed/removed immediately in after calling respective methods.</li>

    ^{
         [processingScreen.view removeFromSuperview];
   });

<p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>

<p>I want code above to work with showing/hiding loading screen immediately.</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)proceedBtnPressed:(id)sender
{
     [[GUIUtilities sharedObj] showProcessingScreen];
     //Some other code here
}
</code></pre>

<p>When i call showProcessingScreen like above processing screen takes around 2-3 sec to show.
But when i remove other code below it  (//Some other code) it shows screen immediately.</p>

<p><strong>What i have tried:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Putting code in showProcessingScreen in other method and calling that on main thread using performSelectorOnMainThread.</li>
<li>Calling showProcessingScreen on background and executing show code on main thread using performSelector.</li>
<li>This works</li>
</ol>

<p>//code</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)proceedBtnPressed:(id)sender
{
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0),

        [[GUIUtilities sharedObj] showProcessingScreen];
        //Some other code here
     });
}
</code></pre>

<p>But i don't want any thread switching mechanism outside of showProcessingScreen.</p>

<p>This is common screen almost used in every application. I used similar codes with xib, custom views in my previous apps which were not using storyboard etc.,
I know this is related to threading, what i am doing wrong here ? what is best practice to achieve this ? 
Any help will be aprreciatead.</p>

<p>I have a directive which is used on multiple elements, and depending on the attribute value of each directive which uses <code>restrict: 'A'</code>, I need the directives to all talk to each other and effect each other in different ways within the link function.</p>

<p>I've tried using:</p>

<pre><code>link : function(scope, elem, attr) {
    attr.forEach(function(e, i) {
        if(attr[i] === 'menu') {

<p><code>elem.length</code></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>give me undefined.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that I don't want to use different directives with different logic because I need each element to actually do something specific to each other element.</p>

<p>I have a web page that has an HTML table generated by an ASP.NET control.  The top row of the table emulates a toolbar.  That top row is laid out sort of like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td style=""white-space:nowrap;""&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Very long title&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
    { bunch of hyperlinks with background images, emulating a toolbar }
  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am stuck with the fact that this is a table, with the contents of the title area being put in a span, and probably with that inline style specifying no wrapping.  </p>

<p>This table is supposed to narrow itself when the page narrows, and it does that pretty well.  However, if the actual title text (which can vary) is too long, it effectively serves as a limit on how narrow the table can get, which can lead to overlapping with other things on the page.  (I'm using IE8, BTW.)</p>

<p>I tried applying <code>overflow:hidden</code>, <code>text-overflow:ellipsis</code>, and <code>display: inline-block</code> to the span and adding a width value for the table cell, all through a stylesheet.  (<code>Display:block</code> on the span doubled the height of the row, which I didn't want, so <code>inline-block</code> was my choice.)  The title text appeared truncated, just as I wanted.  But the table wouldn't get any narrower. </p>

<p>After messing around changing values and styles through IEDT I concluded that, when figuring out how narrow the table could get, the text was still counted as being its full length.  The span was relatively short, only the text that appeared in the span appeared, but for <code>table-cell</code> width purposes, the text was still all there. </p>

<p>I didn't find this phenomenon documented anywhere, but maybe I just don't get around enough.  :)  If <code>text-overflow</code> can't help me, I guess I'll have to dynamically truncate the title through script, which I'd rather not do.  Is there a way to do what I want solely through CSS?</p>

<p>Thanks.  </p>

<p>Here's the store/retrieve code:</p>

<pre><code>def store(key, value, chunksize=750000):
    serialized = pickle.dumps(value, 2)
    values = {}
    for i in xrange(0, len(serialized), chunksize):
        values['%s.%s' % (key, i//chunksize)] = serialized[i : i+chunksize]
    memcache.set_multi(values)

def retrieve(key):

    serialized = ''.join([v for v in result.values() if v is not None])

<p>And this is how I'm using it:</p>

<pre><code>try:
  entitylist = retrieve(""entitylist"")
except EOFError:
  entitylist = MyModel.all().fetch(None)
  store(""entitylist"", entitylist)
</code></pre>

<p>Other oddities:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't see this on my development server; just the production App Engine site.  (Though the data on my development server is slightly different; I believe it all fits into the standard 1MB memcache size, where the production data is larger.)</li>
<li>When I search for ""entitylist"" on both my development and production admin panel, App Engine tells me ""no such key"".  Yet based on the total size of the memcache shown (this is the only place I've implemented memcache), it absolutely appears that something is getting cached.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone please point me in the direction of something I should look at or fix?</p>

<p>My reasons for this are to enhance code readability; I'll let the JVM handle optimization.  Opinions regarding my desired formatting style aside, <strong>is there a way to enforce this particular blank line style within Eclipse?</strong>  Perhaps there is a plug-in to do this that I haven't yet found, or would I have to code one?</p>

<p>The ""Blank Lines"" section of the Java Code Formatter of Eclipse does not provide the ability to enforce or apply this.  Of note, I don't want to force blank lines between code blocks that do not have braces (see the <code>String | int</code> and <code>result | handleResult()</code> code blocks above as examples).</p>

<p>Closest settings I have to this is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blank lines in compilation unit</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Before package declaration: 0</li>
  <li>After package declaration: 1</li>
  <li>Before import declaration: 1</li>
  <li>Between import groups: 0</li>
  <li>After import declaration: 1</li>
  <li>Between class declarations: 1</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Blank lines within class declarations</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Before first declaration: 1</li>
  <li>Before declarations of the same kind: 1</li>
  <li>Before member class declarations: 1</li>
  <li>Before field declarations: 0</li>
  <li>Before method declarations: 1</li>
  <li>At beginning of method body: 1</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Existing blank lines</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Number of empty lines to preserve: 1</li>
  </ul>

I can draw simple shapes like putting dots, squares, lines, but when I try to rotate whole image - nothing happens. No errors, no rotation. Please advise where is problem.</p>

<p>Canvas is updated to window size by function onwindowresize:</p>

<pre><code>function  adaptSize() {
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
    // set size to window
    canvas.setAttribute('width',window.innerWidth);
    canvas.setAttribute('height',window.innerHeight);
    var ctx = canvas.getContext(""2d"");
    // set state size to window
    ctx.width = window.innerWidth;
    ctx.height = window.innerHeight;
    drawSaved();
    inform('Canvas re-drawed - window resized');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each draw function saves itself inlocalstorage to re-draw, for example placing dot:</p>

<pre><code>function placeDot(x,y){
if(document.getElementById('colors').hasAttribute('chosen')){ var color = document.getElementById('colors').getAttribute('chosen');}else{ var color = 'rgba(0,0,0,1)'; }
var canvas = document.getElementById(""canvas"");
if(canvas.getContext) {
    var ctx = canvas.getContext(""2d"");
    ctx.save();
    ctx.fillStyle = color;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(x-2,y-2,5,0,Math.PI*2,true);
    ctx.fill();
    ctx.restore();
}
save(""//Dot(""+x+"",""+y+"",5,'""+color+""')"");
return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>than re-draw function:</p>

<pre><code>function drawSaved(){
var picture = localStorage.getItem(""picture"");
var drawstate =document.getElementById('drawstate');
console.log('picture:'+picture+'.');
var canvas = document.getElementById(""canvas"");
var ctx = canvas.getContext(""2d"");
if((picture=="""")||(picture==null)){
    picture = """"
    localStorage.setItem(""picture"", picture);
    drawstate.innerHTML='picture empty';
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    console.log('cleared');
}else{
    console.log(picture);
    saved = picture.split('//');
    for(var i=1;i&lt;saved.length;i++){
        eval(saved[i]);
    }
    drawstate.innerHTML='picture restored';
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, creating rotation:</p>

<pre><code>function turn(angle){
    var canvas = document.getElementById(""canvas"");
    var ctx = canvas.getContext(""2d"");
     ctx.save();
    console.log('saved');
     ctx.rotate(angle);
    console.log('rotated by'+angle);
     ctx.restore();
    console.log('restored');
     save(""//Turn('""+angle+""')"");
     return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>All this gives no effect on rotation - or any other transformation. Drawing is OK.
Please help.</p>

    Tree&amp; getChild(unsigned int index) const;                       

    //iterator-based iteration                          
    vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;Tree&gt;&gt;::iterator children_begin(){

    unsigned int childrenSize_;
    Tree* parent_;

    static unique_ptr&lt;Tree&gt; root_;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I see two possibilities here:</p>

<h2>1. Index-based iteration</h2>

<p>(suppose the <code>static unique_ptr&lt;Tree&gt; root</code> has been constructed)</p>

<pre><code>Tree&amp; myTree = Tree::root();
for(int i = 0; i &lt; myTree.numChildren(); ++i;){
    Tree&amp; child = myTree.getChild(i);
    //do stuff with child
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems straight-forward and save, as the user has no access on the underlying structure. Also, there is not much overhead, because the length of the <code>children_</code>-vector is saved to a variable whenever the Tree is modified (just trust me on that one) and the function to get this length is inlined.</p>

<h2>2. Iterator-based iteration</h2>

<pre><code>Tree&amp; myTree = Tree::root();
for(vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;Tree&gt;&gt;:iterator it = myTree.children_begin(); it &lt; myTree.children_end(); ++it; ){
    Tree&amp; child = (*(*it));
    //do stuff with child
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems dangerous and ugly, but I could imagine it to be faster. My problem here is that the user could just move the unique_ptr to somewhere else and I want to restrict usage as much as possible to avoid false usage of the structure.</p>

<p><em>What is the more efficient approach and how much difference does it really make?</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> Here is a third approach I came up with while writing this, but I have now idea how to implement it:</p>

<h3>3. The for <code>( : )</code>-loop</h3>

<pre><code>for (Tree&amp; child : Tree::root()){
    //do stuff with child
}
</code></pre>

<p>Syntax-wise, it just looks amazingly simple, but I have no idea what the <code>for ( : )</code>-loop really does internally (probably work with iterators and wouldn't work without <code>-&gt;begin()</code> and <code>-&gt;end()</code> functions on Tree).</p>

<p>Bonus question: Would it be possible to implement this pattern for my own class?</p>

<p>So this kind of gets me to where I want to be, in that I get the items broken down by year and a count of items in that year.  (i.e. 2001 - 10, 1975 - 15, 2005 - 5, 1976 - 1)  The thing I really want to do though is to break them down by decade (i.e. 2000s - 15, 1970s - 16).</p>

<p>How does one have a ""calculated field"" in the ""by"" part of the group clause for a Linq statement.  I think what I want is basically something like:</p>

<pre><code>var results = (from x in ctx.Items
               group x by (x =&gt; x.Year.Value.ToString().Substring(0, 3) + ""0s"") into decades

<p>Or more generally the syntax so that I can do some more complicated evaluation/calculation to do the group by on.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT (update):</p>

<p>(x => x.Year.Value.ToString().Substring(0, 3) + ""0s"") - Doesn't Work - ""LINQ to Entities does not recognize the method 'System.String ToString()' method, and this method cannot be translated into a store expression.""</p>

<p>(x.Year / 10 * 10) - Functionally works (thank you) - the only ""problem"" is that the 's' is not on the end (i.e. 1970 vs. 1970s)</p>

<p>Is there anyway to put a function in the by clause?  i.e. group x by this.ManipulateYear(x.Year) into decades ... or ... x => x.Year.Value.ToString().Substring(0,3) + ""0s"" ??  It would be nice to have some technique (such as calling a function or using a lambda expression) so that I can cover any case that I can think of.</p>

<li><p>How do I auto-generate MockOptionParser without reproducing the skeleton of OptionParser?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Notice that in MockOptionParser's add_option, I DON'T handle 'type' keyword, but I should.  I'm sure I won't predict all the methods and keyword args that OptionParser uses and implement them in MockOptionParser.  <strong>Is there a simpler way?</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Initializing MockOptionParser with self vars for each option is UGLY.  is there a way to do this nicely?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there an easy way to verify all the add_option() vars (options.debug, for instance) are used to set something like self.debug?</p></li>

For example the algorithm which looks at each unfinished order and checks if an invoice should be sent (which depends on the no of days since the job was ended). In these cases creating an invoice is not triggered by an explicit user action but by a background job.</p>

<p>Now this creates a problem for me when it comes to testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can test invoice creation itself easily</li>
<li>However it is hard to create an order in a test and check that the background job identifies the correct orders at the correct time.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far I found two solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the test setup, calculate the job dates relative to the current date. Downside: The code becomes quite complicated as there are no explicit dates written anymore. Sometimes the business logic is pretty complex for edge cases so it becomes hard to debug due to all these relative dates.</li>
<li>I have my own date/time accessor functions which I use throughout my code. In the test I just set a current date and all modules get this date. So I can simulate an order creation in February and check that the invoice is created in April easily. Downside: 3rd party modules do not use this mechanism so it's really hard to integrate+test these.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second approach was way more successful to me after all. Therefore I'm looking for a way to set the time Python's datetime+time modules return. Setting the date is usually enough, I don't need to set the current hour or second (even though this would be nice).</p>

<p>Is there such a utility? Is there an (internal) Python API that I can use?</p>

<p>At this point, it is easily done with Chef and windows cookbook:</p>

  source node['tomcat']['url']
  action :unzip

cookbook_file 'server.xml' do

  action :create
end

<p>Now the tricky part: The user should be allowed to change the server.xml! When he does this and the chef-client runs, it would overwrite the user-change server.xml and put back the given cookbook file. But this must not happen. The file should be copied only after successful unzipping the Tomcat Server.</p>

<p>So i think I definitely need a not_if/only_if statement.</p>

<p>Like somthing to verify the cookbook file is installed only at tomcat unzip time. Is there any way to say ""only_if windows_zipfile was executed"" or something like that?</p>

<p>Or should I maybe compare the length of the server.xml (of the node) and only replace it with the cookbook file, if the length matches the length of the unmodified standard server.xml of installation? (&lt;== this sounds creepy)</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.chef.io/resource_cookbook_file.html"" rel=""nofollow"">given actions</a> for windows_zipfile doesn't help here I guess...</p>

Somewhat like a grid of pairwise scatterplots from corrplot for the purpose of visually checking for correlation.  However, each [P]CCF in the matrix would give the correlations for all temporal offsets.</p>

<p>Again, I don't recall whether this wish-list item is something I saw before -- it might even have been in another package.    But it would be nice if the tool accepted a collection of time series and formed all possible pairs.  Right now, I only am able to find single-pair functions under:</p>

<p>Afternote: I suspect that the answer is that this functionality is not available, but I hope to be proven wrong.

The XML files used are generated based on database column names which used to be converted automatically to UPPERCASE when the XML was being built - which can no longer be done (we are no using TSQL-FOR XML to build the XML). The column names are Generally a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters.
As all Stylesheets currently reference Uppercase column names, the XPath queries are failing.</p>

<p>Instead of going through ALL XSL stylesheets and manually changing the XPath queries to the case of the database column names - which would take most of this year(!)
Is there any way to convert all the XML 'Tag' names to Uppercase, so you can use them in the document?</p>

Or .fromFile() has already loaded all lines to the Enumerator instance, but it's against the fromCallBack() spec, I think.</p>

<p>This works great whenever I need to just replace a string like <code>""ABC""</code> or even <code>""AB0""</code> but this wreaks havoc if I need to change <code>""00""</code> to <code>""10""</code> since it replaces both <code>""00""</code> to <code>""10""</code> (desired) and <code>""1000""</code> to <code>""1100""</code> (not desired).</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks...</p>

<p>According to instructions I've followed it should work perfect, but it doesn't. The effect is visible here <a href=""http://samandera.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://samandera.com/</a>. It works well with Chrome, so you have also proper preview.</p>

This library will be used in many projects and should offer a simple interface where I only have to care about WHAT is going to be written in into the log file, but not HOW.</p>

<p>By using the reflection namespace, I can figure out which application currently called a log function (retrieving execution assembly name), but I want also the name of the function and class that called the logging function.</p>

<p>Let's say I have:</p>

<pre><code>public static void LogInfo(string vLogText) {
   Trace.WriteLine(
        MethodInfo.GetCurrentMethod().Name
        + this.GetType().ToString() + vLogText);
   }
</code></pre>

<p>When I call from another project (class: TestClass, method: TestMethod)</p>

<pre><code>Tracer.LogInfo(""log this!"")
</code></pre>

<p>I expect to see in the log:</p>

<pre><code>TestClass, TestMethod, log this!
</code></pre>

<p>But instead I got</p>

<pre><code>TracerClass, LogInfo, log this!
</code></pre>

<p>How to get the parent method and class name?</p>

<p>line 54 is the for loop definition. I have a similar error with the other servlets. What do you think is going wrong as I can go into tomcat session admin and see that the accountslist isn't null, so I'm not really sure what is happening.</p>

<p>However the performance is very bad. I am running the above against a view (STOCK_HIST) that brings two tables (A and B) together. Table A contains daily stock volume and the daily date for over 9,000 stocks dating back as far as 40 years (300+ rows, per year, per each of the 9,000 stocks). Table B is a ""Date Key"" table that links the date in table A to the DSEQKEY (int).  </p>

<p>What are my options for performance improvement? I have heard that views are convenient but not performant. Should I just copy the columns needed from table A and B to a single table and then run the above query? I have indexes on the tables A and B on the stock symbol + date (A) and DSEQKEY (B). </p>

<p>Is it the view that's killing my performance? How can I improve this? </p>

<p>I've tried using the redirect URL generated from clicking on ""Integrate with Google"" from the new marketplace page but it goes through the authorization page then leads me to a blank page (though the app is successfully installed).

<p>If I change the <code>0</code> to any positive number (which corresponds to the <code>flex-grow</code> property), the last item row will stretch in a super ugly way. The rest of the items behave rather nicely, but the last row should keep the same size as the rest of the items.<br>
What can I do to fix this behavior?</p>

<pre><code>ViewController_1_0 *viewController_1_0
ViewController_1_1 *viewController_1_1
ViewController_1_2 *viewController_1_2
etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>(I realize the underscores are not a good Cocoa coding convention for class names and will change that.)</p>

<p>My intent is to present appropriate controller views based on the current UIStepper value.</p>

<p>Rather than do conditional tests for each of the stepper values and then perform a separate lazy instantiation of the controller object using the ""hard coded"" view controllers I am trying to have code appearing once using strings constructed based upon the current stepper value.</p>

<p>I've figured out (with help from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10050517/use-a-class-name-stored-in-a-variable-to-call-a-class-method"">Use a Class name stored in a variable to call a Class method?</a>) how to set up the Class name: I've declared a property:</p>

<pre><code>@property(strong, nonatomic) Class classStringClass;
</code></pre>

<p>And then after constructing the variable string for the class, I do:</p>

<pre><code>classStringClass = NSClassFromString(classString);
</code></pre>

<p>Where classString is the constructed string using the stepper value, equivalent to ViewController_1_0, for example.</p>

<p>I've also declared a property for the ivar as:</p>

<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *classInstanceString;
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore I do:</p>

<pre><code>if(!classInstanceString) {
   classInstanceString = [[classStringClass alloc] initWithNibName:classString bundle:nil];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where I am stuck is how to code for the ivar for the controllers, i.e., classInstanceString constructed to be the equivalent of the ivar viewController_1_0 (or whatever based on the stepper value) declared in the interface. Once I get out of the lazy instantiation if statement and then code to access properties of classInstanceString, for example:</p>

<pre><code>classInstanceString.view.hidden = NO;
</code></pre>

<p>classInstanceString understandably gets an error ""Property 'view' not found on object of type 'NSString'"".</p>

<p>How do I declare 'classInstanceString' (or another variable, say 'classInstanceVariable' containing the classInstanceString value) so when instantiating it, it is the ivar of classStringClass and has access to the class properties, to use subsequent to the instantiation of the class ? I surmise that it should be a different type than an NSString, but what type would that be, or is there another way to do this ?</p>

<p>Up to this point in my Play experience (just a few months, 1 project live) I have been working with one-to-one form binding to model instance.</p>

<p>I know I can numerically index form field names, but then how to bind the posted form to List[Model]?</p>

<p>This is what my one-to-one binding looks like:</p>

<pre><code>// abstract away bindFromRequest to make binding more concise in controllers
def bindForm[T](f: play.api.data.Form[T])(implicit r: play.api.mvc.Request[_]) =
  f.bindFromRequest fold(e=&gt; Left(e.errorsAsJson), Right(_))
</code></pre>

<p>and then in controllers:</p>

<pre><code>val result = for {
  model &lt;- bindForm(form).right
  id    &lt;- dao.create(model) as json
} yield id
</code></pre>

<p>what I would like to do is the same, but instead of model binding returning a single Model on success, have it return a List[Model], and pass on to overloaded DAO create/edit/delete operations.</p>

<p>I see that there is a <code>list</code> method that one can use as part of a Form mapping, but I have a feeling that that would wreak havoc with my JDBC query wrapper (ScalaQuery/Slick), whose case class/companion object mapping would likely not play well with collections properties.</p>

<p>For example, existing mapping of a game schedule looks like:</p>

<pre><code>object CompositeForm {
  import play.api.data.{Form, Forms}, Forms._
  import utils.Validator.Bindings.jodaLocalTimeFormat
  val mapper = mapping(
    'id   -&gt; ignored(0),
    'gameDate -&gt; jodaDate,
    'gameType -&gt; optional(text),
    'location -&gt; optional(text),
    'team1    -&gt; number,
    'team2    -&gt; number
  )(Composite.apply)(Composite.unapply)
  val form = Form( mapper )
}
</code></pre>

<p>using <code>list(gameDate), list(gameType)</code> instead then means that form binding will return a single Composite instance whose properties are all collections -- maybe it will work, but doesn't seem nearly as clean/straightforward as working with a collection of model instances.</p>

<p>Ideas appreciated ;-)</p>

                    &lt;p&gt;The US needs 34% more students in STEM to keep up w/ economic demand. CTE helps meet that need.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Too many MS students drop out, often because they don't see real-world value of a degree. With CTE, they connect learning to work.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;13K people with 4-yr degrees have re-entered MS community colleges to gain job skills. CTE prepares them for a profession.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;20M+ in the US are un/underemployed, yet 3.4M jobs are unfilled due to skills gaps. CTE gives students the skills they need to find work.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>@Html.Action(""LogOnPartial"")
</code></pre>

<p>If the username or password is incorrect, the called method will reach this line as expected:</p>

<pre><code>ModelState.AddModelError("""", ""The user name or password provided is incorrect."");
</code></pre>

<p>Because it is a partial view, I pass the model back to the Index.cshtml as follow in order to show the 'incorrect' entries:</p>

<pre><code>// If we got this far, something failed, redisplay form
return View(""Index"", model);
</code></pre>

<p>Then Index.cshtml will then call @Html.Action(""LogOnPartial""), which in turn trigger this:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
public ActionResult LogOnPartial(LogOnModel model)
{
    return PartialView(model);
}
</code></pre>

<p>After rendering, the 'incorrect' entries will remain in the textbox as expected, but the above error message ""The user name or password provided is incorrect."" is not displayed.  I guess the error messages are not passed in the above method.</p>

<p>How can I show the error message when returning from the partial view?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Marks, your suggestion is very helpful.  Originally I already included @Html.ValidationSummary() in the end of my LogOnPartial.cshtml but somehow the error message didn't show up in the Index.cshtml.  Now I moved the @Html.ValidationSummary() to Index.cshtml as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.Action(""LogOnPartial"")
@Html.ValidationSummary(true, ""Login was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again."")
</code></pre>

<p>and now it works ok and I can see the login error message.</p>

<p>However, now I have another problem.  There are two partial views in my Index.cshtml.  One is for the LogOnPartial.cshtml and the other is for SignUpPartial.cshtml (you may want to take a look at www.iguardpayroll.com, which is written in WebForms, and you will see there are two boxes in the left column: one is for Login and the other is for Sign Up).</p>

<p>In additional to adding the @Html.ValidationSummary() right underneath the @Html.Action(""LogOnPartial""), I also need to add it under the @Html.Action(""SignUpPartial"") in order to show the error message caused by the signup process (e.g. email already exists!).  However, if I do that the same LogOn error message will appear twice under both the LogOn part and the SignUp part.</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;div&gt;
      @Html.Action(""LogOnPartial"")
      @Html.ValidationSummary(true, ""Login was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again."")
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      @Html.Action(""SignUpPartial"")
      @Html.ValidationSummary(true, ""Sign Up was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again."")   
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How can I tell the first @Html.ValidationSummary() only shows the error message related to LogOnPartial, and the 2nd @Html.ValidationSummary() only shows the Sign Up error message? </p>

<p>We have a table set up, ""Person"", with a trigger that inserts the difference actions into ""Person_History"". From what I can tell, when I execute as myself, all goes well. But when I run this:</p>

<pre><code>EXECUTE AS USER = 'DOMAIN\User';
INSERT INTO ""Person_History"" VALUES (...);
REVERT;
</code></pre>

<p>The first time, I get a permission error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Msg 297, Level 16, State 1, Line 1<br>
  The user does not have permission to perform this action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second time I run it (after tracing all the permissions and finding that this should be allowed), I get this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Msg 15406, Level 16, State 1, Line 1<br>
  Cannot execute as the server principal because the principal ""DOMAIN\User"" does not exist, this type of principal cannot be impersonated, or you do not have permission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that the first error is what the user sees, and reported, and I would expect the behavior not to change after the first run of the statement.</p>

<p>So what might I be missing here? I've never seen this behavior before.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It turns out the insert was not the problem, it was acquiring the transaction ID from sys.dm_tran_current_transaction that was the problem. When the statement failed (for lack of VIEW SERVER STATE permission), revert was never run, and the user was not granted impersonate, thus why the message changed - we were still executing as the other user.</p>

The problem I'm facing is the slow redraw of the image and this of course effects my whole script. Here's some quick pseudo code to explain my program:</p>

<pre><code>    figure
    while(true)
      Frame = AcquireImageFromCamera();  % Mex, returns current frame
      image(I);
    end
</code></pre>

<p><em>AcquireImageFromCamera()</em> is a mex coming from an API for the camera. 
Now without displaying the acquired image the script easily grabbs all frames coming from the camera (it records with a limited framerate). But as soon as I display every image for a real-time video stream, it slows down terribly and therefore frames are lost as they are not captured. </p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea how I could split the process of acquiring images and displaying them in order to use multiple cores of the CPU for example? Parallel computing is the first thing that pops into my mind, but the parallel toolbox works entirely different form what I want here...</p>

<p>edit: I'm a student and in my faculty's matlab version all toolboxes are included :)</p>

<p>The <code>fields</code> arrays are turning into empty objects at runtime. </p>

<p><strong>I'm confirming like this</strong>: </p>

<pre><code>var conf = require('musicConfig');
console.log (""requiredFields = %j"", conf.music.catalog.mysql.requiredFields);
</code></pre>

<p>...<strong>which outputs this</strong>: </p>

<pre><code>requiredFields = [""foo"":[1,2,3],""trackQuery"":[{""table"":""tracks"",""alias"":""t"",""foo"":{},""fields"":{}},{""table"":""artists"",""alias"":""a"",""fields"":{}}]]
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see: </p>

<pre><code>conf.music.catalog.mysql.requiredFields.foo                 // [1,2,3]
conf.music.catalog.mysql.requiredFields.trackQuery[0].foo   // {}  &lt;-- WTF
conf.music.catalog.mysql.requiredFields.trackQuery[0].table // ""tracks""
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea what's going on? Yes, I can move the <code>fields</code> array to a higher level namespace and it will work - one step up actually. If I put it directly under <code>requiredFields</code> it will stay populated, but that's not an ideal solution.</p>

<p>I've <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/7TgJj/"" rel=""nofollow"">confirmed here</a> that it's not an ECMAScript bug and it's not my object structure, because it works as expected.</p>

<p>I'm running Node <strong>0.10.3</strong> on Ubuntu with these dependencies: </p>

<p>I thought it might be that <a href=""https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config"" rel=""nofollow"">config module</a>, but even when I bypass it the issue remains.</p>

<p><h3>UPDATE</h3>Here is the output from: <code>console.log(util.inspect(config.music.catalog.mysql.requiredFields.trackQuery[0], { showHidden: true, depth: null }));

The way I call ChilkatZipSE.exe is ""..\ChilkatZipSE.exe -cfg settings.xml"". Everything is OK with settings.xml and there is UnlockCode node which is needed for creating setup.exe file. When I use OpenFileDialog ChilkatZipSE.exe creates desired setup.exe and it's working fine.<br>

<p>My idea was to check recursively, whether the head element of the pack is copy-constructible or not and go on further, with the tail. Unfortunately, I do not get this idea to compile. My knowledge about variadic templates is not very advanced. I guess, that enable-if after parameter pack in template list does not work. I have no idea. Does anyone has a good advice, how to solve the problem?</p>

<p>After adding logging, I noticed that each POST was preceded by a resource refresh returning always the same information.</p>

<p>Here is what the logs looks like:</p>

<pre><code>DynamoDB_20111205.DescribeTable: id=... time=27ms
DynamoDB_20111205.PutItem: id=... time=22ms

DynamoDB_20111205.PutItem: id=... time=22ms
DynamoDB_20111205.DescribeTable: id=... time=27ms
DynamoDB_20111205.PutItem: id=... time=22ms
</code></pre>

<p>versus the expected:</p>

<pre><code>DynamoDB_20111205.DescribeTable: id=... time=27ms
DynamoDB_20111205.PutItem: id=... time=22ms
DynamoDB_20111205.PutItem: id=... time=22ms
DynamoDB_20111205.PutItem: id=... time=22ms
DynamoDB_20111205.PutItem: id=... time=22ms
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, my reaction was to cache the result of the ""DescribeTable"" operations as it is always the same (apart from some bits I do not care about) and was curious about the performance ""gain"". Here are the order of magnitudes of my tests:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>no</strong> cache: 37.5sec</li>
<li><strong>class level</strong> cache: 41.8 sec (shared by all instances)</li>
<li><strong>instance level</strong> cache: 41.7sec</li>
</ul>

<p>I repeated each 6 times under similar conditions but did not attempt any kind of ""scientific quality"" measurements.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is a stripped down version of my code. This is highly simplified. In the real version, I use an unreleased version of Boto, DynamoDB-mapper and gevent's greenlets</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

class RemoteTableInfo(objects):
    def __init__(self):
        load_remote_table_info() # Triggers the ""DescribeTable"" in logs

class Item(objects):
    def save(self, table, ...):
        do_some_IO() # Triggers the ""PutItem"" in logs

class ObjectMapper_with_cache(object):
    table = None

    def __init__(self):
        cls = type(self)
        if cls.table is None:
            self.table = RemoteTableInfo()

    def do_work(self):
        cls = type(self)
        Item(cls.table, ...).save()

class ObjectMapper_no_cache(object):
    def do_work(self):
        table = RemoteTableInfo()
        Item(table, ...).save()

# Slow version
for i in range(15000):
    ObjectMapper_with_cache().do_work()

# Fast version
for i in range(15000):
    ObjectMapper_no_cache().do_work()
</code></pre>

<p>Why is the <strong>version with no cache <em>faster</em> by <em>4 seconds</em></strong> with my ""smartest"" attempts (class level) ?</p>

For example, I have this code for the login (which works for logging in):</p>

<pre><code>login : function(socket, data, callback) {

<p>My C# code performs an automatic login if the account creation was successful (e.g., the username is not already taken). However, in this case, it won't be able to do the login immediately after because Monk takes time to create the new user. Is there a way to ""cheat"" and make the account creation immediate? Here's the code to create an account (it takes the username and password from the same fields for the login)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>We have a simple delete statement that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM tablename WHERE pk = 12345
</code></pre>

<p>This just hangs, no timeout, no nothing.</p>

<p>We've looked at the execution plan, and it consists of many lookups on related tables to ensure no foreign keys would trip up the delete, but we've verified that none of those other tables have any rows referring to that particular row.</p>

<p>There is no other user connected to the database at this time.</p>

<p>We've run DBCC CHECKDB against it, and it reports 0 errors.</p>

<p>Looking at the results of <em><code>sp_who</code></em> and <em><code>sp_lock</code></em> while the query is hanging, I notice that my spid has plenty of PAG and KEY locks, as well as the occasional TAB lock.</p>

<p>The table has 1.777.621 rows, and yes, pk is the primary key, so it's a single row delete based on index. There is no table scan in the execution plan, though I notice that it contains something that says <em>Table Spool (Eager Spool)</em>, but says Estimated number of rows 1. Can this actually be a table-scan in disguise? It only says it looks at the primary key column.</p>

<p>Tried DBCC DBREINDEX and UPDATE STATISTICS on the table. Both completed within reasonable time.</p>

<p>There is unfortunately a high number of indexes on this particular table. It is the core table in our system, with plenty of columns, and references, both outgoing and incoming. The exact number is 48 indexes + the primary key clustered index.</p>

<p>What else should we look at?</p>

<p>Note also that this table did not have this problem before, this problem occured suddently today. We also have many databases with the same table setup (copies of customer databases), and they behave as expected, it's just this one that is problematic.</p>

Now, when there are changes in the remote database, I cannot pull it so that it is local (It doesn't detect any changes even though the sqlite3 file is included in the project and the commits). And if I try to sync or push, the remote database gets reset/overwritten with my local database. I cannot simply do the git ignore trick because I need to push the database after I created new models (I'm assuming the remote database does not have my local migrations) Does anyone know how to fix this issue? Here are my database settings in the settings.py file:</p>

<p>Here's what I've done so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attempted to import a QXF containing new transactions for a pre-existing account (named ""Checking Account"").  However, instead of importing the transactions into ""Checking Account"" it instead creates a new account ""Checking Account 2"" rather than importing/merging the new transactions into the appropriate pre-existing ""Checking Account"" account.  According to Quicken's site (link at the bottom of the page) this is what's happening:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When importing a QXF file, it's possible that one or more accounts in
  the QXF file   already exist in the destination data file. If this is
  the case, Quicken will not attempt to merge the transactions in these
  duplicate accounts. Instead, Quicken will create a new account</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Contacted Quicken, however their support was clearly having trouble understanding the question and they only knew how to use the program and could not provide any additional information on which format to use.</li>
<li>Researched QFX, QXF, OFX and QIF</li>
</ul>

<p>From what I've read OFX is not supported (instead QFX is used for financial institutions registered with Quicken only).  Additionally QIF is being phased out and does not support the Checking account I need to import these records into. Finally, QXF has proven difficult to locate information on but from what I've read it is an encoded file format that requires some SDK to create and aside from this issue (as stated above) it does not import according to my criteria.</p>

<p>I'm at my wits end here and I've spent several hours researching the topic.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>Please understand I'm not asking for your ""favorite"" SDK, I'm simply having troubles discovering what my options are and I would appreciate the StackOverflow community point me in the right direction.</em></p>

<p>I'm asking out of confusion since Microsoft made a lot of change to the whole self hosting procedure and every tutorial I find take a different, deprecated or unfamiliar approach.</p>

<p>My goal is to set up a self hosted <em>Web API</em> in a legacy Windows Service to control various long running tasks from a non-Windows client, such as an Android application where integrating a <em>WCF</em> / <em>SOAP</em> client can really be a PITA. </p>

<p>I'm aware about the fact that <em>WCF</em> is capable of offering a RESTful service, but since Web API is really suited for such a task, I thought I gave it a shot.</p>

<p>This is how I currently start my API hosted using <em>OWIN</em> (<em>Katana</em>):</p>

<pre><code>public class ApiBootstrap {

    var httpConfiguration = new HttpConfiguration();
    // ... configure routes etc.

    appBuilder.UseWebApi(httpConfiguration);     // appBuilder = IAppBuilder
    var disposable = WebApp.Start&lt;ApiBootstrapper&gt;(_myBaseUri);

}
</code></pre>

<p>But most tutorials go on a different approach:</p>

<pre><code>var config = new HttpSelfHostConfiguration(""http://localhost:999"");
// ... configure routes etc..

var server = new HttpSelfHostServer(config);
server.OpenAsync().Wait();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I understand the <code>HttpSelfHostServer</code> class is from <code>System.Web.Http.SelfHost</code> and not using <em>OWIN</em>, and both work fine. </p>

<p>But I'm struggling for days to achieve very simple tasks such as securing the connection using <em>SSL</em>, creating authorization etc., just because every tutorial I find on those topics referr to the self hosted method not using <em>OWIN</em>. But AFAIK, <em>OWIN</em> (<em>Katana</em>) is Microsofts prefered approach to achieve self hosting. </p>

<p>As a beginner, I am completely confused and helpless!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to say something like, ""Get me all of the subgenres for the user specified genres (rock, rap, indie, hip hop)?  But I can't seem to get the SQL right.  I think I need some kind of join, but any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>So in the example below.  I could say get me Rock and all it's subgenres and get these ID's back [1, 7, 8] by saying <code>Genre.find_by(name: 'rock').sub_genres</code> or <code>Genre.find(1).sub_genres</code></p>

    2 | indie
    3 | soul
    4 | house
    5 | indie pop
    6 | pop
    7 | stoner rock
    8 | indie rock

<p>Suppose I have a two smart arts A and B in two different parent slides.</p>

<p>Now I create one master slide on which I have superimposed smartart B on top of smartart A. I have added animation to both A and B so that the transition from A to B happens.</p>

<p>Now what I want is that if i want to make any changes in smartart A or B, I only have to make it only in the parent slides and the master slide containing A and B will get automatically refreshed.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this? Any help will be appreciated.</p>

"5758957","1","5759064","","2011-04-22 18:56:54","","0","2041","<p>I have a library of static final Java classes which describes a body of standards.  One of these classes (simplified) night look like:</p>

<pre><code>public static final class ResponseControl { 
    public static enum EventStatus {
        EVENT_RECEIVED,
        EVENT_STARTED,
        EVENT_COMPLETED;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's convenient to include the enum EventStatusOption as a subclass of the class ResponseControl, because that's where it's defined in the standards document, and that's where people will be looking for it.  It allows them to say things like:</p>

<pre><code>if (respCtl.status == ResponseControl.EventStatus.EVENT_STARTED) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>But I have literally hundreds of these classes, and in some cases the same enum is used in multiple classes.  It would be nice to be able to define the enum somewhere else, and then do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static enum GlobalEventStatus {
    EVENT_RECEIVED,
    EVENT_STARTED,
    EVENT_COMPLETED;
}
public static final class ResponseControl { 
    public static enum EventStatus extends GlobalEventStatus {}
    public final EventStatus status;
}

if (respCtl.status == ResponseControl.EventStatus.EVENT_STARTED) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>I can't do this, however, because it isn't legal to extend enums, even (as in my case) where I don't really want to extend them at all, I just want to make the global type available in the local class.  Does anyone know of a way to accomplish this?</p>

<hr>

<p>The second paragraph of ColinD's answer below is actually the answer I needed.  By saying:</p>

<pre><code>public interface GlobalEvent
{
    public static enum Status {
        EVENT_RECEIVED,
        EVENT_STARTED,
        EVENT_COMPLETED;
    }
}

public static final class ResponseControl {
    public static enum Event implements GlobalEvent
    public final Event.Status status;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can allow my users to say:</p>

<pre><code>if (respCtl.status == ResponseControl.Event.Status.EVENT_STARTED) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>...all while still maintaining the actual definitions in a single place.  Thanks.</p>

My application has multiple wizard style pages they navigate through, so for each page (in the single page app) the walkthrough needs to start from the first step within that container.</p>

<p>This is how it is structured:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fieldset id=""page1""&gt;
    &lt;input data-step=""1"" data-intro=""instructions"" /&gt;
    &lt;input data-step=""2"" data-intro=""instructions"" /&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;Go to step 2&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;fieldset id=""page2""&gt;
    &lt;input data-step=""1"" data-intro=""instructions"" /&gt;
    &lt;input data-step=""2"" data-intro=""instructions"" /&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;Go to step 3&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So when the user clicks 'Go to step 2' it needs to reset the intro and void the steps from the previous page (page 1) and start from step 1 on page 2.</p>

<p>Edit: If I can run it under a call back from my buttons that take you to the next step could I just have it look for the data-step's under a specific div for example the unique id of the active step?</p>

<li>If there is NO parameter, search the httpheader for the locale and place this

<p>I have a web page with a large <code>jQuery(document).ready()</code> handler.  The problem is that when an exception is thrown from within the <code>jQuery(document).ready()</code> handler, I get a call-stack with several anonymous functions and no pointer to the code that actually threw the exception.</p>

<p>Whenever I try to reproduce this behavior with a small web page, I <em>always</em> get a pointer to the code that threw the exception, but in production code, I <em>never</em> get the stack pointer.  This makes debugging more frustrating and error-prone.</p>

<p>Does anyone here any any idea what could be causing this behavior and how to make it right?</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Update:</b> It's been several months since I posted this question and I now believe that I have conclusively reproduced the issue.  I reproduce the issue with the following HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" &gt;    
&lt;body&gt;
Factorial Page
&lt;input type='button' value='Factorial' id='btnFactorial' /&gt;
&lt;script src=""Scripts/jquery-1.6.1.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
    $(document).ready(documentReady);

    function documentReady() {
        $('#btnFactorial').click(btnFactorial_click);

        factorial(-1);
    }

    function btnFactorial_click() {
        var x;
        x = prompt('Enter a number to compute factorial for.', '');
        alert(x + '! = ' + factorial(x));
    }

    function factorial(x) {
        if (x &lt; 0)
            throw new Error('factorial function doesn\'t support negative numbers');
        else if (x === 0 || x === 1)
            return 1;
        else
            return factorial(x - 1) * x;
    }
&lt;/script&gt;       
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the code, you'll see that when you click a button, the code alerts the factorial of a number that you specify.  Enter a negative number and an error will be produced.  In this case, Visual Studio will catch the error and highlight the line of code where the error occurred and display a call stack including <code>factorial</code> and <code>btnFactorial_click</code>.</p>

<p>This code also invokes <code>factorial(-1)</code> from the $(document).ready handler.  In this case, Visual Studio moves the highlight to the finally block in the following jQuery code (excerpted from jquery-1.6.1.js, beginning on line 987</p>

<pre><code>            // resolve with given context and args
            resolveWith: function( context, args ) {
                if ( !cancelled &amp;&amp; !fired &amp;&amp; !firing ) {
                    // make sure args are available (#8421)
                    args = args || [];
                    firing = 1;
                    try {
                        while( callbacks[ 0 ] ) {
                            callbacks.shift().apply( context, args );
                        }
                    }
                    finally {
                        fired = [ context, args ];
                        firing = 0;
                    }
                }
                return this;
            },
</code></pre>

<p>Although the call stack is not displayed, Visual Studio displays a pop-up showing the text of the error.</p>

<p>What is the reason for this odd behavior and how can I design my application so that I can easily trap errors that originate from handlers such as $(document).ready?</p>

<p>The height of the <code>FrameLayout @+id/parent</code> must be determined at runtime because it is displayed above many other views, and they must be shown in the layout. This way the FrameLayout fills the remaining space perfectly (using height=""0dp"" and weight=""1"" properties).</p>

<p>The <code>ImageView @+id/flexible_imageview</code> receives an image from the network, and it always shows with the correct aspect ratio. This part is already ok as well. This View is the largest and should determine the size of the <code>FrameLayout @+id/parent</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that when the image is drawn, the width of the <code>FrameLayout @+id/parent</code> is not adjusted to wrap and be the <code>ImageView @+id/flexible_imageview</code> as it should be.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<h2>-- update --</h2>

<p>I've updated the layout to clarify some of the missing parts, and to add the reasoning behind all of it.</p>

<p>What I want is to have an Image (<code>ImageView @+id/flexible_imageview</code>) with unknown dimensions to have, on top of it, a gradient and some text on top of the gradient. I can't set the <code>FrameLayout @+id/parent</code> dimensions to both <code>wrap_content</code> because there is more Views after this Image that must be shown. If there's not enough space in the layout, the Image (<code>ImageView @+id/flexible_imageview</code>) is reduced until it all fits in the layout, but it should maintain its aspect ratio, and the gradient/texts on top of it.</p>

<p>The @drawable/gradient is just:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;shape xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"" &gt;

<pre><code>JQuery Array: addVssID

<ul>
<li>addVssID has the values (1, 11, 25) to represent checkboxes that have been checked in an HTML form. This collection/calculation is triggered when a SAVE button is clicked.</li>
<li>Elsewhere in the program $self->input has been newly created to hold various pieces of vendor information that Perl later processes and saves to a MySQL database. I'm tailing the values in a log file, and don't see my expected results when I use DUMPER($self) in my Perl, though I can see other values populated.</li>
<li>I'm basically looking at existing legacy code, copy/edit it for my own needs, but it doesn't seem to be working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is my JSON: To be completely honest, I don't really understand how this works.</p>

<pre><code>var ShippingInput = $('&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""Shipping"" /&gt;');     
$ShippingInput.val(JSON.stringify(getShipping()));
$form.append($ShippingInput);

<pre><code>my $Shipping = [];
eval { $Shipping = JSON::from_json($self-&gt;input-&gt;{'vendor'}-&gt;{'Shipping'});
};
</code></pre>

<p>Ultimately I want to move the array values into a MySQL table. The other option is to push the array into the MySQL table and pull it out into Perl for processing. I don't know if this changes anything, but we also have Template Toolkit available.</p>

<p>UPDATE/SOLUTION:
Taking the JSON route, I took the dynamic value from the checkbox (value='Shipping_###'), strip off the text and add the number to array. I'm still shakey on how JSON/JQUERY works, but here is the get function and it seems to be working:</p>

<pre><code>function getShipping() {
// called onSave from submitForm()
var shipping = [];

$('.Shipping').each(function(i, Shipping) {
    shipping.push($(Shipping).attr('id').replace('Shipping_', ''));
});

&lt;value&gt;..\Resources\0.txt;System.String, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089;Windows-1252&lt;/value&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>and then I try to read the content of that embedded resourde using this solution before</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3314140/how-to-read-embedded-resource-text-file"">How to read embedded resource text file</a></p>

<p>Here is the main program</p>

<pre><code>        var assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
        var resourceName = ""Properties.Resources.0.txt""; 
        using (Stream stream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName))
        try
        {
            using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream))
            {
                string result = reader.ReadToEnd();
                Console.WriteLine(result);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>but I got null parameter in var reader, I think it's about the path of resource name, any IDEA to solve my problem?
thanks before</p>

<p>Building a web app with jQuery Mobile/Knockout.js/iScrollView. I have a list which I'm filling using Knockout.js foreach.  I make an ajax request, I get a JSON object, I push it into my observable array and my page updates by showing me everything the way I need it.</p>

<p>Now I want to use iScrollView so as the list grows I can have a nice smooth scroll down and take advantage of the pullup or pulldown functionality.</p>

<p>I cannot seem to figure out the proper way to call <code>$(element).iscrollview('refresh')</code> at the right time so that it adjusts the size of the scrolling window after more items have been added.</p>

<p>Is there a way to wait until the items are all inserted into the DOM and THEN call <code>$(element).iscrollview('refresh')</code>.</p>

<p>Here's my HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div data-role=""page"" id=""List"" data-bind=""event: {pageshow: loadItems}""&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class=""feat-list-btn feat-list-action""&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    self.updateScroller = function(){
        //????????
        };
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I can solve this by doing </p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function(){$('#List [data-role=""content""]').iscrollview('refresh');}, 1000);
</code></pre>

<p>But I would rather not rely on a setTimeOut to get things like this done...</p>

They were kind enough to talk out-loud what they were thinking to explain why certain things were being done (e.g. creating a constructor with arguments instead of just having a default constructor, etc).</p>

<p>While I will probably retain 40% of what I saw/heard today I was wondering if there was a set of steps/guidelines to follow, where the end result is a test case that would be a good starting point. I know the usual responses of </p>

<ol>
<li>every shop has their own standard, </li>
<li>there are personal preferences and tools, </li>
<li>depends if the test is for a class you own versus legacy, etc. </li>
</ol>

<p>Either way, I figured and ask SO members.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet from some of the notes I took to show what I had in mind, in terms of responses.</p>

<ol>
<li>Using Mockito, you cannot mock objects that are being created with methods, therefore try and get a constructor to take those objects. This would allow you to mock them and then pass them to the method for easier testing.</li>
<li>Mockito does not handle static methods, but you can create a wrapper class that invokes the static method. Now, this new wrapper class does not use any static methods and the class your testing will use it instead of the static method. This now allows you to use when/thenReturn without having to handle the static method directly.</li>
<li>When mocking, declare the variables that will be used by all test cases at class level. Then mock those classes within setUp(); this approach ensures the commonly used mocks are always is a known state and where not modified by a previous test.</li>
<li>Can't be said enough, use good variable names (e.g. listWithOneCar, listWithNoCars, etc)</li>
<li>Since Test cases are sometimes based off a truth table, try to include that in your test method names (e.g. ensureCanDrive_Car_0_withValidKey_0(), ensureCanDrive_Car_1_withValidKey_1(), etc). This should help you visually scan if you've captured the bulk of test cases with a quick visual scan. Once done, just add edge cases.</li>
<li>'verify' is under used, try to use more of it in your test cases.</li>
<li>Individual test cases should only have code that differs between test cases and no repeating code. This makes it easier to understand and maintain/expand.</li>
</ol>

<p>You get the idea.
These are just from my notes, but I was wondering if anyone had a list that's evolved?</p>

Neither of these are libraries that I need, but the compilation is being aborted due to their errors.  When it does abort the rest of the libraries seem to be almost done, in fact I can even load and compile my Qt projects in Visual Studio at this point, they just runny buggy due  most likely to not all of the libraries being compiled.

<p>I also tried FETCH_EXTRA_LAZY there to no avail. As a last chance I tried to

<p>In my test-case I'm actually reading the <em>same</em> file (35mb) from multiple threads, so I'm not bound by I/O in any way.  I do not run more threads than CPUs and I do not have any synchronization between pools -- i.e. I'm just processing independently a bunch of files.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea what could be a possible reason for this slow performance when threaded ?  What should I look for ? Or what's the best way to dissect the problem? I already looked for static variables in the classes, which could be shared between threads and I don't see any. 
Can one of the <code>java.*</code> classes when instantiated in the thread run significantly slower, (e.g. <code>java.zip.deflate</code> which I'm using)?<br>
Thanks for any hints. </p>

<p>Upd: Another interesting hint is that when a single thread is running the execution time of the function which does the reading is constant to high precision, but when running multiple threads, I see significant variation in timings.  </p>

I am creating an XML document using the Linq XElement class.
Once the document is created I put it into a dataset object. The dataset allow object allows me to infer the XSD schema from the created XML, which is handy.
But... the datatypes in the XSD all come out as type string, even for numeric values.</p>

<p>Below is some sample code that reproduces the problem:</p>

<pre><code>class Person
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public String Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public double Score { get; set; }

    public XElement GetXML()
    {
        var person = new XElement(""Person"", new XAttribute(""ID"", ID));
        person.Add(new XElement(""Name"", Name));
        person.Add(new XElement(""Age"", Age));
        person.Add(new XElement(""Score"", Score));
        return person;
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var set = new DataSet(""Test"");
    var root = new XElement(""root"");

    var p1 = new Person() { ID = 1, Name = ""P1"", Age = 32, Score = 50.4 };
    var p2 = new Person() {ID = 2, Name = ""P2"", Age = 40, Score = 0 };

    root.Add(p1.GetXML());
    root.Add(p2.GetXML());

    set.ReadXml(root.CreateReader());
    var xml = set.GetXml();
    var schema = set.GetXmlSchema();

    Console.WriteLine(schema);
    Console.WriteLine(xml);
    Console.ReadKey(true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you run the code, the schema will contain items like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:element name=""Age"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0"" msdata:Ordinal=""1"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot see how I can set the type for this to be integer, for example.</p>

<p>I tried changing the following line:<br>
<i>set.ReadXml(root.CreateReader());</i><br>
to:<br>
<i>set.ReadXml(root.CreateReader(), XmlReadMode.InferTypedSchema);</i><br>
This almost worked but it still did not produce the exact types I want. Also the use resulted in inconsistent values (sometimes values with decimal types such as Score would be type='xs:double', other times they would be type='xs:Anonymous'</p>

<p>Is there any way I can specify the datatype of attributes and nodes?
Note that I am in a position where I must use the Syste.Data.DataSet class to hold the xml in the end, but I do not necessarily have to use the linq XElement class to construct the XML to place in it. I suspect the problem may be related to the XNodeReader object created by calling CreateReader, as well as the simplistic nature of the XElement class.</p>

<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated!
Thanks</p>

<p>For purposes of the question, let's focus on iPhone &lt;--> Web Service interactions.</p>

<p>My app needs to do the following workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li>iPhone#1 sends data to web service.</li>
<li>Web service pulls data from iPhone#2.</li>
<li>Web service does some calculations based on data from iPhone#1 and iPhone#2.</li>
<li>Web service sends results to iPhone#1 and iPhone#2.</li>
<li>iPhone#1 and iPhone#2 display results to users.</li>
</ol>

<p>Steps 1, 3, and 5 are easy but how can I perform #2 and #4 above (requesting data from phone and sending data to phone)?</p>

<p>I don't necessarily need code samples, just a push in the right direction. Any help is much appreciated.</p>

The problem I'm having is that it executes the code, seemingly without any issues, yet does not post the score on Facebook. Here's the code that should post their score:</p>

<pre><code>public void postScore(int score){

        Log.d(TAG, ""requestPublishPermissions"");
        requestPublishPermissions(session);

    }

            }
        });
    Request.executeBatchAsync(postScoreRequest);
}// end of postScore() method
</code></pre>

<p>Where PERMISSIONS is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>protected static final List&lt;String&gt; PERMISSIONS = Arrays.asList(""publish_actions"");
</code></pre>

<p>And requestPublishPermissions() is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>protected void requestPublishPermissions(Session session) {
    if (session != null) {
        Session.NewPermissionsRequest newPermissionsRequest = new Session.NewPermissionsRequest(this, PERMISSIONS)
                // demonstrate how to set an audience for the publish permissions,
                // if none are set, this defaults to FRIENDS
                .setDefaultAudience(SessionDefaultAudience.FRIENDS)

        session.requestNewPublishPermissions(newPermissionsRequest);

<pre><code>modifyButton.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT));
</code></pre>

<p>Any hints ?</p>

<p>UPDATE 1 after applying the answer : 
I am using the following code to set the button to invisible.</p>

<pre><code>Bundle extras;
extras = getIntent().getExtras();
String answer = extras.getString(""answer"");

if(answer.equalsIgnoreCase(""yes"")
{
  insertButton.setEnabled(true);
  insertButton.setText(""INSERT"");
  removeButton.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
}
else
{
 //whatever
}

<li>How can I disable the Error prompts when invalid entries are entered and instead the invalid entries be automatically clear and focus retained in that textbox ? Because each time the errors are displayed, the phone No textbox is usually displaced or shifted from its initial position in the form.</li>
<li>In respect of question 2., can the error prompt be transfer for display at the top of the form or elsewhere instead of causing displacement of textbox.</li>

<p>For debugging purposes, I want to add some extra buttons to my application, which means I also need associated signals/slots for those buttons to connect them. Since they're purely for debugging, though, I only want them included in the application if it's built in debug mode. To achieve this, I'm using <code>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</code>. For example, I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>IF(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
    MESSAGE(STATUS ""No CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE specified; defaulting to Debug mode."")
    SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE ""Debug"")
ENDIF()

IF(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE_LOWER MATCHES debug)
    SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS ""${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -DMYAPP_DEBUG"")
ENDIF()
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to be working well. If I enable ""verbose makefile,"" I see <code>-DMYAPP_DEBUG</code> being passed to the compiler just like it should be. This doesn't seem to work though, with <code>moc</code> files.</p>

<p>I'm using a rather recent version of CMake (i.e., >= 2.8.9), so I have the new <code>CMAKE_AUTOMOC</code> feature turned on. However, when I have a header file that contain:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef MYAPP_DEBUG
    void debugTriggered(bool);
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following when I start the application:</p>

<pre><code>QObject::connect: No such signal MainMenu::debugTriggered(bool)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming the reason for this is that the value of <code>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</code> is not taken into account when CMake is <code>AUTOMOC</code>-ing my sources. How can I alter my CMake build file to get this working?</p>

postKeyboardEvent( kVK_Tab, true );
postKeyboardEvent( kVK_Command, true );

<p>I have on listview and I want apply a magnetic effect on this. To make this, I use scrollBy one by one pixel with Thread to move listview position. Visually, it's perfect, listview move good. But when user want scroll again, listview come back to his previous position (just before scrollBy) before scroll normally with user finger.</p>

<p>I've tried some tests, for exemple I display v.getTop() (v is on view item in listview) value BEFORE my scrollBy and AFTER. Values are same, but visually are really different because list are moved. Also visually, you can see a little artefact : this divider is ON listview item. It's means that visually, listview is good, but programatically isn't good... while scrollBy make invalidate estate.</p>

Firstly, what I am doing, I have different image formats, I need to resize them according to the container where it will be used, for instance in slideshow.<br>
To be honest, this is default implementation of OpenCart engine.<br>
What is wrong with this ?<br>
When I am resizing png image everything seems to work perfect, transparent background....    </p>

<p>But when I am converting JPEG images I am getting background, by default rectangle is filled with white color. I clearly understand that it is not possible to use jpeg with transparent background because of format algorithm and specification.      </p>

<p>What I wanna to have. I want to resized JPEG images with transparent background ( rectangle), of course JPEG image cannot be transparent but I want just to make rectangle (size of which is set according to a container) transparent.<br>
Maybe convert resize JPEG, draw transparent rectangle, put JPEG onto this rectangle and save it into png or another format which allows using transparent background.        </p>

<p>Here is my code(not mine but default).     </p>

<pre><code>$image_old = $this-&gt;image;
        $this-&gt;image = imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height);

        if (isset($this-&gt;info['mime']) &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;info['mime'] == 'image/png') {     
            imagealphablending($this-&gt;image, false);

            imagecolortransparent($this-&gt;image, $background);
        } else {
            $background = imagecolorallocate($this-&gt;image, 255, 255, 255);
        }

        imagefilledrectangle($this-&gt;image, 0, 0, $width, $height, $background);

        imagecopyresampled($this-&gt;image, $image_old, $xpos, $ypos, 0, 0, $new_width, $new_height, $this-&gt;info['width'], $this-&gt;info['height']);
        imagedestroy($image_old);

<p>I have tried to search for solutions, read manuals and documentation, but all my attempts failed. (black background, bad quality but still filled background)</p>

<p>I'm trying to get all the doubles after the ':' into a vector, which I can do if they're ints but once a '.' is entered it seems to stop.</p>

<p>If I only put integers in, it also seems to stop after the <code>while(in &gt;&gt; number)</code> has finished finding all the numbers, which is fine but the <code>cout&lt;&lt;</code> command in my main function doesn't seem to work!</p>

<pre><code>(E || F) &amp;&amp; (M || N) &amp;&amp; A -&gt; which is proven as possible by selecting F,M,A.
</code></pre>

<p>I need to verify if the above is possible without duplicates.</p>

<p>Is there a means of examining vectors/arrays like this that is faster than 9 million loops?
Are the constraint libraries the only option?</p>

<p><strong>In an effort to clarify:</strong></p>

<p>containers are std::vector. </p>

<p>The vectors contain any integer. </p>

<p>I would need to examine them problem by problem to identify the full set of integers.</p>

<p>Using the conditional logic specified to select entire vectors, will a duplicate occur?
The conditional operators in use would always be ""AND"" and ""OR"" only. The problem I listed is a simplified version, but that is really all there is to it. It just differs in size.</p>

<p>The output I care less about..it could be a boolean, another vector of potential duplicates, etc. I am trying to find the right tool for the job rather than salvaging.</p>

<p>In my current set up, I would solve this by analyzing for forced items like A and removing anything it intersects with...(in this case, N...then I would loop again, and do the same process with M, which is now a forced choice, and removing E, leaving me with F.</p>

<pre><code>// g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -Wall test.cpp
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock hrc;

hrc::time_point start = hrc::now();
hrc::time_point end   = hrc::now();

std::cout &lt;&lt; ""duration: "" &lt;&lt; duration.count() &lt;&lt; "" ns"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

<p>I've run this thousands of times in a loop, and I consistently get 40 ns +/- 2 ns on my particular 3.40GHz desktop.</p>

<p>However, when I look to see what is the shortest time I can sleep:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;thread&gt;

hrc::time_point start = hrc::now();
std::this_thread::sleep_for( std::chrono::nanoseconds(1) );
hrc::time_point end   = hrc::now();
std::chrono::nanoseconds duration = end - start;
std::cout &lt;&lt; ""slept for: "" &lt;&lt; duration.count() &lt;&lt; "" ns"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>This tells me I slept on average 55400 nanoseconds, or 55.4 microseconds.  Much greater than the time I expected.</p>

<p>Putting the above code into a <code>for()</code> loop, I tried sleeping for different amounts, and this is the result:</p>

<ul>
<li>sleep_for( 4000 ns ) => slept for 58000 ns</li>
<li>sleep_for( 3000 ns ) => slept for 57000 ns</li>
<li>sleep_for( 2000 ns ) => slept for 56000 ns</li>
<li>sleep_for( 1000 ns ) => slept for 55000 ns</li>
<li>sleep_for( 0 ns ) => slept for 54000 ns</li>
<li>sleep_for( -1000 ns ) => slept for 313 ns</li>
<li>sleep_for( -2000 ns ) => slept for 203 ns</li>
<li>sleep_for( -3000 ns ) => slept for 215 ns</li>
<li>sleep_for( -4000 ns ) => slept for 221 ns</li>
</ul>

<p>Some questions I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>What could explain these numbers?</li>
<li>Why does sleeping for a negative amount of time return 200+ ns, while sleeping for 0+ nanoseconds results in 50,000+ nanoseconds?</li>
<li>Is negative numbers as a sleep time a documented/supported feature, or did I accidentally stumble across some strange bug I cannot rely upon?</li>
<li>Is there a better C++ sleep call which would give me more consistent/predictable sleep times?</li>

I'm using the C library for xml-rpc available here : <a href=""http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/</a> . The library uses <code>./configure</code> to generate the makefile according to the host architecture, and <code>make, make install</code> to build/install the library.</p>

<p>I need to use this library with my iOS application. I understand that XCode uses a completely different build system, and I'm new to iOS development, so I'm not quite sure how to tie in the library with my application. What options do I need to pass in with ./configure to compile the library for iOS architectures (I understand there are three targets, armv7, armv7s and i386)?</p>

I am creating a small project for my website and i am trying to convert it to php for the pages and easier maint.</p>

<p>The way i want it set up is like how i have it now. <a href=""http://soloentertainment.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Soloentertainment.org</a> But this is all html and each page is it own Html page and if i need to edit or add to the nav bar or anywhere else i have to go to each html and change it. That is a big no no. So trying to convert it to php but the problem i have encountered, which is weird is that i have it highlight what page you are on now. But for the php, <a href=""http://soloentertainment.org/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Soloentertainment.org/index.php</a>, (i don't have all links working so the projects page and bout leads to the html links) but the home should be highlighted like in the original home page. </p>

<p>I achieved this for the weekly view since the fields are constant (7 fields) but when it comes to the month view I cannot add 30 or 31 fields because I've coded in ASP not on code behind C#.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a <code>List&lt;int[]&gt;</code>  where each <code>int[]</code> in the <code>List</code> is of length 2.</li>
<li>I have a DB table <code>VALUES</code> which contains 3 columns, called <code>ID</code>, <code>PARENT</code> and <code>VALUE</code>, where each <code>int[]</code> in the <code>List</code> (see 1) <strong><em>may</em></strong> correspond to a record in the table, the 0 index being <code>ID</code> and the 1 index being <code>PARENT</code>. <strong>*But</strong> some arrays likely do not correspond to any existing records in the table.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each combination of <code>ID</code> and <code>PARENT</code> correspond to multiple DB records, with different <code>VALUE</code>s. </p>

<p>Several points that are important to note:</p>

<ol>
<li>One of the problems is that I can't rely on <code>ID</code> alone - each value is defined/located according to both the <code>ID</code> and <code>PARENT</code>.</li>
<li><p>None of the int arrays repeat, though the value in each index may appear in several arrays, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;int[]&gt; myList = new List&lt;int[]&gt;();
myList.add(new int[]{2, 1});
myList.add(new int[]{3, 1}); //Notice - same ""PARENT""
myList.add(new int[]{4, 1}); //Notice - same ""PARENT""
myList.add(new int[]{3, 1}); //!!!! Cannot exist - already in the List
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>I can't seem to figure out how to request all of the <code>VALUE</code>s from the <code>VALUES</code> table that correspond to the <code>ID</code>, <code>PARENT</code> pairs in the <code>List&lt;int[]&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I've tried several variations but keep arriving at the pitfall of attempting to compare an array in a linq statement... I can't seem to crack it without loading substantially more information that I actually need.</p>

<p>Probably the closest I've gotten is with the following line:</p>

<pre><code>var myList = new List&lt;int[]&gt;();
// ... fill the list ...
var res = myContext.VALUES.Where(v =&gt; myList.Any(listItem =&gt; listItem[0] == v.ID &amp;&amp; listItem[1] == v.PARENT));
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, <strong>this can't work</strong> because <code>The LINQ expression node type 'ArrayIndex' is not supported in LINQ to Entities.</code></p>

<hr>

<p>@chris huber</p>

<p>I tried it out but it was unsuccessful.<br>
2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Where you created ""myValues"" I have a DB table entity, not a List.</li>
<li>Due to point number 1, I am using LINQ to Entities, as opposed to LINQ to Object</li>
</ol>

<p>My code then comes to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var q2 = from value in myContext.VALUES where myList.Select(x =&gt; new { ID = x.ElementAt(0), Parent = x.ElementAt(1) }).Contains(new { ID = value.ID, Parent = value.PARENT }) select value;
</code></pre>

<p>This returns the following error message when run:</p>

<pre><code>LINQ to Entities does not recognize the method 'Int32 ElementAt[Int32](System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable` 1[System.Int32],Int32)' method, and this method cannot be translated into a store expression.
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>@Ovidiu</p>

<p>I attempted your solution as well but the same problem as above:</p>

<p>As I am using LINQ to Entities, there are simply certain things that cannot be performed, in this case - the ToString() method is ""not recognized"". Removing the ToString() method and attempting to simply have a   <code>Int32 + ""|"" + In32</code> gives me a whole other error about LINQ to Entities not being able to cast an Int32 to Object.</p>

<p>So basicly, my code works fine thanks to the ""setTimeout()"" in game.js (for the socket.emit() event). If I don't use it, the object 'dataRet' doesn't have the time to instantiate due to the asynchronousity of Node.js, so the socket emits ""undefined"" or ""null"".</p>

<p>So I was thinking, there MUST be a way to listen for an object instantiation in order to emit it through socket.io as soon as it's done.</p>

<p>Suppose you have the source file with the implementation of this Type only (no other implementations).</p>

<p>For example</p>

<p>Assembly MyAssembly.dll declares this interface</p>

<pre><code>public interface IInterface { byte[] Array { get; } }
</code></pre>

<p>Assembly MyAssembly2.dll declares this abstract class</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class MyTypeBase: IInterface
{
   public byte[] Array { get; set; }
   protected virtual void Execute(ConfigurationManager cmgr) { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In source file ""MyType.cs"" there is the implementation of MyType</p>

<pre><code>public class MyType&lt;T&gt;: MyTypeBase
{
   protected override void Execute(ConfigurationManager cmgr)
   {
        Array = new Byte[512];
   }

   public List&lt;T&gt; Data { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, for the type <code>MyType&lt;DateTime&gt;</code> the assemblies needed to reference would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mscorlib</code> (Because of <code>DateTime, Byte, Byte[], List&lt;DateTime&gt;</code>)</li>
<li><code>MyAssembly2.dll</code> (Because of <code>MyTypeBase</code>)</li>
<li><code>MyAssembly.dll</code> (Because of <code>IInterface</code> indirectly referenced by <code>MyTypeBase</code>)</li>
<li><code>System.Configuration</code> (Because of <code>ConfigurationManager</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is going to be used in a dynamic compilation scenario, and I don't know how deep and where I have to look for Type referenced by a certain type (implemented interfaces of that type, inherited classes, return types, method arguments, events etc)</p>

<p>For instance, is it necessary for the example above, to reference <code>MyAssembly.dll</code> since it is referenced indirectly and not directly by <code>MyType&lt;DateTime&gt;</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>As I said this is going to be used in a dynamic compilation scenario, but i forgot to mention that there would be no source file to compile, but a CodeDOM CompilationUnit instead. So each referenced type in the initial Type is well known (by reflection).</p>

<p>All I want is, for a given Type instance at runtime, to find all the assemblies that <strong>would</strong> be needed as references if I had to compile this Type's source code.</p>

<p>I can get json returned by using jQuery but the code inside the callback ""data.foreach"" does not work, so it's not formatted the way d3 needs it. How do I do this with the json library from an asp.net page to an asmx webservice <strong>using D3</strong> (not jQuery) so the data.foreach below works? using D3 I am just getting null back when I try to serialise a list of objects and return as Json. Note - returning one item is OK (I can create and call a webmethod to return a guid). But in order to get the D3 example to work I need to get the json back in the format the example expects...thanks. BTW I can do this with MVC, I need it for ASP.net though...</p>

<pre><code>d3.csv(""flights-departed.csv"", function(data) {

// Parse dates and numbers.
data.forEach(function(d) {
d.date = parse(d.date);
d.value = +d.value;
});

// Compute the maximum price.
x.domain([new Date(1999, 0, 1), new Date(2003, 0, 0)]);
y.domain([0, d3.max(data, function(d) { return d.value; })]);

// Bind the data to our path elements.
svg.select(""path.area"").data([data]);
svg.select(""path.line"").data([data]);

draw();
});
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>I've been trying to fix this all day.</p>

<p>I updated the d3 library to allow calls to webmethods, as per the following article:</p>

<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/d3-js/-u_P9BF1COs/VP9Q1vaSJgAJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/d3-js/-u_P9BF1COs/VP9Q1vaSJgAJ</a></p>

<p>Now I can call and get a JSON encoded object back no problem. When Itry and do the same and have a list of objects returned, it always comes back from the webmathod as a null.</p>

<p>To explain...</p>

<p>This works:  </p>

<pre><code>function loadAnOBJECTViaJSonVIA_ASP_FRAMEWORK() {

    var sUrl = ""http://localhost:3791/DemoServices.asmx/GetSingleObject_VIA_ASP_FRAMEWORK"";

    d3.jsonasmx(sUrl, function (data) {

        var d = data.d;

        alert('I got the following OBJECT back:' + d);
        alert('reading property: ' + d.ppGuid);
        alert('reading property: ' + d.x_value);
        alert('reading property: ' + d.y_value);
    });
}

        {
            PointPair pp = new PointPair();

            return pp;
        }

<p>This doesn't work:</p>

                //alert('I got the following TOP LEVEL OBJECT back:' + d);

                //alert('reading property: ' + d.ppGuid);
                //alert('reading property: ' + d.x_value);
                //alert('reading property: ' + d.y_value);
            });
        }

<p>Really stuck...in the second example inside the callback function data is null. I've tried wrapping the of points in the .ListOfPoints property as yu can see, but that didn't help.</p>

Those commands are simple pause/resume for my downloader. My design is, that on a server, I run a hub instance, which creates a window for passing commands and a window for backend to pass those commands to my pc. I'm bounding those two ""windows"" with a channel, they run a server. When a client connects and sends a message to the hub, it gets streamed through a channel to backend window and then to the real backend (on my home pc). When backend responds to the backend window on the hub, the hub prints the result back to the client.</p>

<p>With this approach, only the first message passes and works with my downloader. I have to reconnect the backend from my home pc with the hub each time I get a message to get this working properly. I don't think that's the proper way with websockets, so here I am. After one successful request (when the backend finishes it's work and replies the result), it gets looped forever with EOF error.</p>

<p>The important parts of the code are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/farnoy/gosab/blob/reproducable-so/src/gosab/cmd/commands.go"">main executable</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/farnoy/gosab/blob/reproducable-so/src/gosab/hub/handlers/handlers.go"">hub handlers</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/farnoy/gosab/blob/reproducable-so/src/gosab/backend/connector/connector.go"">backend connector</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you put the source in your GOPATH (i'm developing it for the tip version of go to support modern websockets), to compile it:
<code>go build gosab/cmd</code>, to run it:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>./cmd -mode=""hub""</code> <em>hub</em></li>
<li><code>./cmd -mode=""backend"" --address=""localhost:8082""</code> <em>backend</em></li>
</ul>

<p>To pass messages to the hub, use this javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var s = new WebSocket(""ws://localhost:8082"")
s.send(""1 5"")
</code></pre>

<p>So how do I handle it? Are channels a good way to communicate between two different requests?</p>

<p>Adding in-app purchases seems very straight forward. My concern is that it's non-obvious how I should handle legacy support for users who currently own the app because, on upgrade, they should still have access to all of the features. I.e. legacy users should not lose access to features; they should be treated as if they already paid for them.</p>

<p>The simplest way to deal with this, I think, is to have some routine test for the existence of a flag in a plist file (or the NSUserDefaults): if the flag isn't there, it's upgrading from a previous version.</p>

<p>Another would be some callback that's fired when the kernel detects the first launch of an updated version of an application. I can't find much in the available documentation for this kind of support, however.</p>

<p>Can anyone make a recommendation?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: There is also two related scenarios that need to be addressed:</p>

<p>1) User has the old version of the app installed. They upgrade, but later uninstall the app. When they reinstall (the new version from the store) they should still have access to the legacy features.</p>

<p>2) User uninstalled the old version of the app, but decides to install the updated version from the store. As far as the app is concerned, it's a brand new installation.</p>

<p>(1) seems addressable by having the upgrade procedure create a number of $0 purchases in StoreKit. That way, Apple's support for restoring apps (and purchases) should just work.</p>

<p>As for (2), I have no idea if there's any way to work around that.</p>

<p>I have a checkbox for a boolean value in a kendo grid. When the user clicks the checkbox, they are presented with a bootstrap modal dialog, which prompts them to confirm what they are doing. (Don't worry about what it does. That works fine.)</p>

<p>The issue is, if they cancel out of the confirmation dialog, I want to undo their change on the checkbox. (I need to undo it to keep the grid in sync with the data, because the call to update the underlying data only happens if they click OK.)</p>

<p>The template looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  title   : ""Active"",
  field   : ""uaa"",
  template: ""&lt;input name='active' class='userActiveToggle' type='checkbox' data-bind='checked: uaa' #= uaa ? checked='checked' : '' #/&gt;""
}
</code></pre>

<p>The javascript function:
The code in the ""$('.modal-confirm .cancel') .click"" function doesn't work. It fires, but it does not set the checkbox back to its original state. (And also, there is surely a better way to do this... Unbinding is necessary inside both the click functions; otherwise they will be bound multiple times. But that's not my main concern right now.)</p>

<pre><code>$(""#AccountsGrid"").on(""click"", "".userActiveToggle"", function (e) {
    var grid = $('#AccountsGrid').data().kendoGrid;
    var tr = $(e.target).closest(""tr"");
    var data = grid.dataItem(tr);

    $('.modal-confirm').modal({ show : false, keyboard : true, backdrop : true });
    $('.modal-confirm .modal-header h3').text('Modify User');
    var userName = data.uau;
    var isActive = data.uaa;
    data.set('uaa', isActive);
    var modifyDescription =  isActive ?  'deactivate' :  'activate';

    $('.modal-confirm .modal-body p').html('Are you sure you want to '+ modifyDescription + ' the user, ' + userName + '?');
    $('.modal-confirm .cancel').html('Cancel');
    $('.modal-confirm .submit').html('OK').addClass('btn-danger');

    $('.modal-confirm .submit').click(function(e){
        if (hc.ActivateUser(userName, !isActive))
            data.set('uaa', !isActive);
        $('.modal-confirm').modal('hide');
        $('.modal-confirm .submit').unbind().on('click', null);
    });

    $('.modal-confirm .cancel') .click(function(e){
        grid.closeCell();
        var col = $(this).closest('td');
        grid.editCell(col);
        alert(isActive);
        data.set('uaa', isActive);
        $(e.target).checked= isActive;
        grid.closeCell(col);
        $('.modal-confirm .cancel').unbind().on('click', null);
    });

    $('.modal-confirm').modal('show');
});
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried disabling the checkbox in the template, which works, but then the function doesn't fire at all. Can someone please let me know if this is even possible? If not I can use a command button instead.</p>

<p>(Oh, and the call to data.set in the submit click of the modal is probably redundant. I originally copied this code from my command button, before adding the checkbox. The plan here is to get rid of the button if I can.)</p>

<p>I'm building high-performance upload server. The purpose of server(s), in simple terms, is to receive huge amount of files from clients and save them on NAS.</p>

<p>Requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Files will be uploaded via HTTP POSTs in ""multipart/form-data"" encoding.</li>
<li>Each file will be at least few megabytes long.</li>
<li>Clients are browsers on computers and mobile clients.</li>
<li>Because at least 50% of clients will be mobile clients I expect these TCP/IP sessions to be pretty long.</li>
<li>It should not be affected by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris"" rel=""nofollow"">Slowloris</a> attacks.</li>
<li>Target platform is Linux CentOS 6.2.</li>
<li>As server receives files it saves some info to database, performs authentication and etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>My current approach is to implement everything (http parsing and etc) myself using <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Boost Asio</a>. I like it because I have greater control on what happens with data. I'm thinking about writing it to file directly from socket using memory mapped files.</p>

<p>Would you say it might be easier to implement it as extension to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx"" rel=""nofollow"">Nginx</a> ? Is Nginx a viable option given the requirements listed above?</p>

Each soldier has some stats (class, hp, attack, etc), and three inventory slots. There will be only about 100 items in the game to fill these inventory slots. I was hoping to set up a relational database that would have a table for soldiers, a table for items owned, and a few other various tables. </p>

<p>Speed is my main concern. SQLite is the obvious first choice. However, it seems to be very bulky and geared towards databases with 1000's of rows. Is there a better option for small databases? I don't need complex queries or anything, just a way to store data and back it up to a server. </p>

<p>How do I set the orphan s to be equally spaced along the parent  using css? I have set each of the orphan s to be 24% of the parent, as when they were set to 25%, the furthest right dropped beneath (I presume due to borders taking up additional space). I am using percentages of the parent as when zoomed out, the furthest right  dropped beneath, but this was the only part of the webpage that changed due to zooming. I tried setting the margins of the orphans to auto, but this didn't work, and changing the float caused them to decrease in width.</p>

<p>Update: I realised that I should have asked for the two s on either end of the parent  to be at the very end of it, whilst the two inner s are equally spaced in the remaining gap.</p>

<p>Fixed: It was the borders on the orphan s adding to the width. I opted for taking away the borders, as the webpage looked better without them anyway.</p>

<pre><code>org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'GalaxyServiceTests': Injection of autowired dependencies failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field: private GalaxyService GalaxyServiceTests.galaxyService; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of type [GalaxyService] found for dependency: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency.

<p>
Since im new to spring in connection with neo4j i cant resolve this error. if someone got a hint or some advice - thanks in advance</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
i changed the dependency of spring-data from 2.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT to 2.2.0.RELEASE.. now neo4j is running till the point when an error is passed to console: </p>

<pre><code>21:11:48.196 [main] ERROR o.s.test.context.TestContextManager - Caught exception while allowing TestExecutionListener [org.springframework.test.context.support.DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener@7e26f5a7] to prepare test instance [GalaxyServiceTests@64d74895]

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>
I've published the repository on 
<a href=""http://github.com/BenMatheja/bodega"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/BenMatheja/bodega</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT3</strong>
Something with the path of application-context.xml was messed up. I fixed that issue with <code>@ContextConfiguration( locations = {""classpath:/META-INF/application-context.xml""})</code></p>

<p>I'm at the point that an Exception </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No qualifying bean of type [start.GalaxyService] found for dependency:
  expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for
  this dependency</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is thrown each time i run the JUnit4 test now.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT4</strong>
I managed to get it working yesterday. Some parts of the Application-context were pretty messed up.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;context:spring-configured/&gt;
&lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;
&lt;context:component-scan base-package=""components""/&gt;
&lt;neo4j:config graphDatabaseService=""graphDatabaseService""/&gt;
&lt;neo4j:config storeDirectory=""target/graph.db""/&gt;
&lt;neo4j:repositories base-package=""Repositories""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a snippet of my working app-context.
Furthermore i missed to attach an @Service to the GalaxyService class.</p>

<p>Now everything is working as intended. This will maybe help someone facing the same problem.</p>

<p>Now when I set the date through the Date picker, the app crashes.</p>

<p>I´m starting my first adventure in responsive design and I have some doubts.</p>

<p>I´m develloping a website that I want it adpats to the tablet, desktop and smartphone. After a lots of research and study of Media queries I started to develop, through the research I did I realized that trying to do one layout for each different resolution was a bit unthinkable because it would take too much time. So I tried to catch the largest number of possible resolutions, resolutions that are most used and then I used <em>Media queries</em> to make the adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>My process:</strong></p>

<p>@media screen and (min-width:769px) {} for desktop versions
@media screen and (max-width:768px) {} for tablet versions
And for smartphone I´m using a php class to detect if its a mobile and then I have a design for that device.</p>

<p>Do you think I'm doing a good approach or do you think that during my research and study I understood something wrong to be doing this method? </p>

<p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

<pre><code>function theme_user_post_block($vars)
{

$themeUserCommentInput ='';

$themeUserCommentInput .= '&lt;textarea id=""txt_1""rows=""1"" cols=""50""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;';

$themeUserCommentInput .= '&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Post Comment"" align=""center""
class=""btnPostComment"" id=""btn_1"" /&gt;'
return $themeUserCommentInput;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This able to show me Textbox and Button inside the page. Now here is my JS code:-</p>

<pre><code>(function($) 
{   
Drupal.behaviors.PostComment= { 

 attach: function (context, settings) {
  $('.btnPostComment', context).click(function (event) {
  var post = ""&amp;newcomment=Comment1&amp;logid=log1"";
  jQuery.ajax({
              url: 'postcomment',
              type: 'POST',
              dataType: 'json',
              data: post,
              success: function (data) { alert(data); },
              error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown){alert(textStatus + 
   errorThrown);}
      });               
     });
    }                    
   }
  })(jQuery); 
</code></pre>

<p>Next I create a Menu Page with URL Name as follows:-</p>

<pre><code> function postcomment_menu(){
 $items=array();
  $items['postcomment']=array(
   'title'=&gt;t(''),
   'type'=&gt; MENU_CALLBACK,       
   'page callback' =&gt; 'user_comment_post',        
   'access arguments' =&gt; array('access content'),
 );
 return $items; 
}

function user_comment_post(){
 global $user;
 $cid =  db_insert('user_comment')
    -&gt;fields(array(     
    'comment_user_id' =&gt; $user-&gt;uid,
    'reference_id' =&gt; $_POST['logid'],      
    'comment_desc'=&gt;$_POST['newcomment'],
    'createdon'=&gt;REQUEST_TIME, 
    ))
    -&gt;execute();
  if($cid!=0)
  {
     //GetUserComments($i);
     drupal_json_output(""success"");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I have done all things that is required for jQuery+Ajax Submit functionality. When I press ""Post Comment"" button it gives me error in alert says ""errorundefined"". The alert shows as a result of error inside the jQuery.AJAX function. Also the custom menu callback is also not getting called.</p>

The project says that the table should be named optable, and or each opcode I should have name, opcode, funct, and type in the table.  The question I have is, what is meant by a table?  I am unfamiliar with tables in asm and I couldn't find any reference to tables when I searched on google.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm working on an HTML email that contains a list of items and am wondering if the below design is possible, considering the restrictions of email clients.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pS4pN.png"" alt=""item listing""></p>

<p>Currently, I have a table for each item with two cells (we'll call this <code>item-table</code>). The first cell (<code>info-cell</code>) is of variable height and contains item information and links. The second cell (<code>image-cell</code>) contains an image and is also of variable height. This question pertains to this first cell.</p>

<p>I have a table nested in <code>info-cell</code> with two rows, each with one cell. We'll call these cells <code>info-cell-top</code> and <code>info-cell-bottom</code>.</p>

<h2>The desired outcome</h2>

<p>The desired outcome is to have <code>info-cell-top</code> aligned to the top and with <code>info-cell-bottom</code> aligned to the bottom of <code>info-cell</code>, regardless of the height of <code>item-table</code>.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fWcl5.png"" alt=""item listing - notes""></p>

<h1>What I've tried</h1>

<p>As this is markup for email, I cannot use <code>rowspan=""2""</code> on <code>image-cell</code> to solve this problem. While it works for some desktop email clients, for mobile clients the image cell disappears entirely.</p>

<p>I have also tried to make the inner table stretch to the full height of <code>info-cell</code>, using both <code>height=""100%""</code> and <code>height=""1""</code>.</p>

<p>Both of these solutions look fine in the browser but do not work for email.</p>

"16184250","1","16204357","","2013-04-24 05:46:27","","0","113","<p>I have a table view where each cell can play a message, similar to the voicemail table view from the iphone with the difference that the slider and progress labels are part of the cell: 
<img src=""http://apcmag.com/images/iphone-voicemail.jpg"" alt=""Apple's Voicemail audio cells""></p>

<p>The table is associated with CoreData where each managed object contains a link to the audio files for the table view cells.</p>

<p>Since the play button, slider, and audio time progress labels are part of each cell, each AudioCell (which is the custom cell that inherits from UITableViewCell) contains an AVAudioPlayer object to respond to the user actions (e.g. play, pause, etc...).</p>

<p>When I start playing the audio from a cell, I need to save that cell in a memvar so the AVAudioPlayer object inside the cell can keep playing the audio and the labels and slider are updated correctly. Here is the code where I ""save"" the audio playing cell to the memvar:
    #pragma mark - AudioCellDelegate</p>

<pre><code>- (void)playbackChangedForAudioCell:(AudioCell *)audioCell
{
    if (self.audioPlayingCell.isPlaying &amp;&amp; ![self.audioPlayingCell isEqual:audioCell]) {
        [self.audioPlayingCell stopPlayback];
    }

    if (audioCell.isPlaying) {
        self.audioPlayingCell = audioCell;
    } else{
        self.audioPlayingCell = nil;
    }

    // Mark the message as played.
    Message *message = (Message *)[[self fetchedResultsControllerForTableView:self.tableView] objectAtIndexPath:audioCell.cellIndexPath];

    [self messageSeenByUser:message];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the relevant code where the cell is ""restored"" from the memvar if it matches the NSIndexPath that is currently playing audio:</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    NSManagedObject *managedObject = [[self fetchedResultsControllerForTableView:tableView] objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];

    UITableViewCell *cell = nil;

    // Implement any new kind of message here.
    if ([managedObject isKindOfClass:[VoicemailMessage class]])
    {
        if ([self.audioPlayingCell.cellIndexPath isEqual:indexPath])
            cell = self.audioPlayingCell;
        else {
            AudioCell *audioCell = (AudioCell *)[self setupCellForVoicemail:(VoicemailMessage*)managedObject];
            audioCell.cellIndexPath = indexPath;
            cell = audioCell;
        }
    } 
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when the NSManagedObject is updated at:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)messageSeenByUser:(Message *)message
{
    if (self.view.window) {
        if ([message.isNew boolValue])
        {
            message.isNew = [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO];
            [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:MessageBadgeNotification object:self];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>the cell disappears from the table view (the space is still there, but I can't see any widget from the cell).</p>

<p>BUT, if there are no changes to the NSManagedObject and the table reloads the cell does not disappear.</p>

<p>I would like to know what could be causing the cell to disappear, something must be different from the regular table view update and the managed object change.</p>

Here is the code excerpt:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity

@OneToOne(mappedBy=""organization"")
private TimeoffSetting timeoffSetting;

private String name;

</code></pre>

<p>The JUNIT test:</p>

<pre><code>@PersistenceContext
private EntityManager entityManager

@Transactional
public void organization() {
    Organization organization_it = new Organization(cooperation, ""IT"");
    organization_it.setUpperLevel(organizationTop);

<p>Please notice the <strong>entityManager.refresh(o)</strong> method call here, if I don't make refresh the entity, the OneToMany mapping test of <strong>assertEquals(getSubOrganizations().size(), 2)</strong>  will cause failure.
By googling the internet, Spring's integration test deserve to be more caution when  writing ORM test.

<p>For example if an object <code>A</code> references itself <code>A</code>, (self circular reference) it means, it expects itself <code>A</code> in <em>complete original state</em> while it is restoring. Because it was in that state when it was being serialized.</p>

<p>For self-referencing case, it can be detected because it knows itself is being restored. But if the <code>A</code> needs another object <code>B</code>, it should expect the other object <code>B</code> in complete original state too. If the object <code>B</code> also references <code>A</code>, now there's circular reference to  <code>A</code> again, and it becomes equal problem without knowing the <code>A</code> is now being restored. <strong>If <code>B</code> wants to use some property of <code>A</code> while deserialization, it is not guaranteed to be exist.</strong></p>

<p>Fundamentally, this problem happens because an object needs complete state of the other objects though itself is in incomplete state. This doesn't make sense. I have thought about dividing restoring process into multiple phases, but it doesn't make any real difference because actually the object will remain in incomplete state until all phases finish.</p>

<p>Can I have some advise or good solution for this problem?</p>

<p>PS.
I started coding this to make some replacement for Cocoa's <code>NSKeyedArchiver</code>. So I assumed encoding of object is done by the object itself. (for its internal state) So it could be different with general graph problems. But I can't exclude hidden state that can be get by the object itself...</p>

I have an existing modular <a href=""http://requirejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">AMD/requirejs</a> Typescript application that I need to integrate this code into. At the top of my initial TS file, I import several modules:</p>

<pre><code>import tracer = module('../classes/trace');
import pubsub = module('../classes/pubsub');
import masker = module('../classes/masker');
// etc.
</code></pre>

<p>This was working fine, but now that I have added the ArcGis code, instead of resolving the relative path within my application, require.js has picked up a baseUrl from the Esri site, and tries to load:</p>

<pre><code>http://serverapi.arcgisonline.com/jsapi/arcgis/3.3/js/esri/classes/trace.js
// etc.
</code></pre>

<p>Resulting in a string of 404 responses and script errors.</p>

 &lt;script src=""~/Content/client/hop/hop.app.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this fails, throwing an exception that require has no method config.</p>

<p>(NB If I reverse the order in the head of the html document so that the arcgis api comes last in the load sequence then I get the opposite problem - my local files all work fine but dojo and the mapping api fail because they are looking for paths relative to my site when they should be searching on the argis server).</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is when a character is created, assign it a token that represents its voice:</p>

<pre><code>//female voices
        HRESULT hr;
        if (sceneObjects.at(characterLocation).gender == FEMALE){
            if (sceneObjects.at(characterLocation).age == ADULT){
                hr = SpFindBestToken(SPCAT_VOICES, L""Name=VW Kate"", L"""", &amp;pToken);
                if (FAILED(hr)){
                    hr = SpFindBestToken(SPCAT_VOICES, L""Gender=Female"",L"""",&amp;pToken);
                    //if we fail load the default voice
                    if(FAILED(hr)) pToken = NULL;
                }
                sceneObjects.at(characterLocation).voiceToken = pToken;
            }
            else{
                hr = SpFindBestToken(SPCAT_VOICES, L""Gender=Female"", L""Name=Microsoft Mary"", &amp;pToken);
                //if we fail load the default voice
                if(FAILED(hr)) pToken = NULL;
                //s = L""&lt;pitch middle=\""+10\""&gt;""+s+L""&lt;/pitch&gt;"";
                sceneObjects.at(characterLocation).voiceToken = pToken;
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>and then when I actually want it to speak, I pass in the character as a parameter into the text to speech thread and assign the voice its token:</p>

<pre><code>DWORD WINAPI DIGuy::sayMessage(LPVOID lpParam){
HRESULT hres;
try{

    ThreadParam * param = (ThreadParam *)lpParam;
    wstring s = param-&gt;message;
    wstring characterName = param-&gt;sceneObject.name;

    ISpVoice * pVoice;
    pVoice-&gt;SetVoice(param-&gt;sceneObject.voiceToken);
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is no matter what voice I assign to my character when I do the SetVoice call I get the default system voice. Running in debug mode shows that the voiceToken is not null (which would cause the default voice to load) and that the voiceToken returned does not change due to my switching the system default voice (so it's not automatically mapping to default there, either), and that the voiceToken doesn't change between where I assign it and where I access it (so there's nothing else interfering).</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I've discovered that, if an error happens when executing a trigger, SQL Server aborts the batch and/or the whole transaction. This is not acceptable for me, because it causes problems to the main application that uses the database; I also don't have the source code for that application, so I can't perform proper debugging on it. I absolutely need all database actions to succeed, even if my trigger fails.</p>

<p>How can I code my trigger so that, should an error happen, SQL Server will <em>not</em> abort the INSERT action?</p>

<p>Additionally, how can I perform proper error handling so that I can actually know the trigger has failed? Sending an email with the error data would be ok for me (the trigger's main purpose is actually sending emails), but how do I detect an error condition in a trigger and react to it?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>Thanks for the tips about optimizing performance by using something else than a trigger, but this code is not ""complex"" in the sense that it's long-running or performance intensive; it simply builds and sends a mail message, but in order to do so, it must retrieve data from various linked tables, and since I am reverse-engineering this application, I don't have the database schema available and am still trying to find my way around it; this is why conversion errors or unexpected/null values can still creep up, crashing the trigger execution.</p>

<p>Also, as stated above, <strong>I absolutely can't perform debugging on the application itself</strong>, nor modify it to do what I need in the application layer; the only way to react to an application event is by firing a database trigger when the application writes to the DB that something has just heppened.</p>

<p>Greetings. My goal is an alignment as shown in the attached image (the fields on the left may have any width, but the ones on the right should begin at the same <code>X</code> coordinate).</p>

<p>Right now I am using a simple table code to achieve this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Left1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Right 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Left 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Right 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I've heard that using tables is generally bad. Is there a way I could achieve the same design using CSS? The website is being designed for mobile devices which might not support fancy CSS, so the code must be as simple as possible.</p>

<li>There is an additional drop-down that allows you to change the type of document you are creating. And this essentially changes the name of the element. This makes sense that the handler wont handle the event. However is there a way to listen for element name change and add the previous handler to the new element?</li>

<p>I guess I can achieve this, because my each batch of messages sent is in separate session, so I can commit or rollback the session. But my consumer is async and runs on single session.</p>

<p>How can I achieve transaction management in consumer ? I want consumer should also rollback above mentioned 100 message batch processing if any of the single message processing (consumption) from that batch fails.</p>

The phonegap console still tells me it was a success, but also gives me an error.

<p>I had some similar probems  when I made the same project before as a native Android app, after switching from http to https, but managed to fix those by accepting all certificates. And then I had to enable more cipher suites to support API level 20 and up. But I did manage to get it working there.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The problem seems to be with the certificate. An intermediary certificate should be added to the server.
Currently I'm still trying to get around that with the cordovaHTTP plugin.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-s
RewriteRule (.*) index.php?path=$1 [QSA,L]
</code></pre>

<p>Then a set of redirects e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Redirect 301 /oldpage.htm http://www.mydomain.com/new-page
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem I am having is that  when I go into a browser and type in the old URL, I get redirected to URL with a parameter attached, e.g: </p>

<p>""http://www.mydomain.com/new-page?path=oldpage.htm""</p>

<p>For some of my redirects this seems to work anyway, for some it produces a 404 error. I've also tried using RewriteCond and Rewrite Rule to write more generic catch all redirects for those pages that I can, and I'm having the same issue.</p>

<p>I'm thinking that some other rule must be interfering with my redirects - the only one I can see which might do so is the rule above, but if that was the case shouldn't the URL I am redirected to end up being</p>

<p>""http://www.mydomain.com/index.php?path=oldpage.htm""</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why parameters are being appended to the URLs and how I can stop this happening so that my redirects work?</p>

<p>Here's the code twitter provides:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""http://widgets.twimg.com/j/2/widget.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;script&gt; 
new TWTR.Widget({
  version: 2,
  type: 'profile',
  rpp: 3,
  interval: 6000,
  width: 420,
  height: 250,
  theme: {
    shell: {
      background: '#ffffff',
      color: '#000000'
    },
    tweets: {
      background: '#ffffff',
      color: '#000000',
      links: '#666666'
    }
  },
  features: {
    scrollbar: false,
    loop: false,
    live: false,
    hashtags: true,
    timestamp: true,
    avatars: false,
    behavior: 'all'
  }
}).render().setUser('apumpkinpatch').start();
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can see an example here that while using IE the site updates (the twitter widget) doesn't scroll with the page while using IE: <a href=""http://apumpkinpatch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apumpkinpatch.com/</a></p>

<p>EDIT:
I on IE7, for some reason there are two vertical scrollbars and It appears under all the other content now after i played with the z index... I can't explain the double scrollbars on IE it's really weird. I'm typically a mac user so i dont know what the double vertical scrollbars are about</p>

<p>I think the class for the widget is .twtr-doc according to the inspector. Anyone know if there is a css attribute I should be adding to it to stop this from happening in IE?</p>

<p>Works fine in CHrome and FF.</p>

The second iteration through the list reveals that the object is exactly the same as when it was instantiated.</p>

<p>I've been banging my head off the desk all day and it seems like a simple issue of the object being copied (or the iterator pointing to copy) which is updated, and then destroyed/lost.</p>

<p>The list is part of a Menu class (public) and holds Slider objects.</p>

<p>This is how I'm setting up the object (a slider control) and adding it to the list of sliders:</p>

<pre><code>void Menu::addSlider (int X, int Y, int X2, int Y2, std::string Txt, int Stype, float Val){

    Slider b;
    b.setup(X,Y,  X2,Y2, Txt, Stype, Val);

    std::list&lt;Slider&gt;::iterator bIt = sliders.begin();
    sliders.insert(bIt, b);

}
</code></pre>

<p>This is in the Menu::draw() funciton, where I'm iterating through the list of sliders to update/draw them:</p>

<pre><code>        ...

    for (std::list&lt;Slider&gt;::iterator it = sliders.begin(); it != sliders.end(); it++) {

        it-&gt;draw(menuBuf);  //works fine, draw to buffer

        if (mouseIsDown) {
            //check button for click - if true, update the value of the slider
            if (it-&gt;checkClick(MouseX, MouseY)) {
               it-&gt;setVal(MouseX, MouseY);                        // works fine
               std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Slider Value: "" &lt;&lt; it-&gt;val &lt;&lt; ""\n"";  //outputs the new value
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But the next time I call this draw function, that value is no longer set.  I'm still a c++ newb, but I've tried to research this problem all day.  Plenty of posts on this site (and others) seem to indicate that what I'm doing is the correct way to access the object that the iterator is pointing to, but no one ever seems to mention if its pointing to a copy, or the original object?</p>

<p><strong>If its pointing to a copy, how? Why?</strong>  Is it because the object is out of scope of the function that created it?  If so, why is the object even available in the list with all of its properties intact?</p>

<p>Help me Obi Wan Kenobi... you're my only hope.</p>

I have `div`s in a container and when the mouse is over them it resizes the div and shifts the divs in front by a certain offset.
On mouseout, it shifts the div by subtracting from that offset. 

This is my current code:

    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;script src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

            &lt;script language=""JavaScript1.2""&gt;

                function resize(obj)
                {
                    shift(parseInt(obj.id[obj.id.length-1]));
                    $(""#""+obj.id).height(""100px"").width(""100px"") ;

                }

                function shift(id)
                {
                    for(var i=id+1;i&lt;=4;i++)
                    {
                        $(""#hello""+i).stop().animate({""left"":""+=60px""},1000) ;
                    }
                }

                function shrink(obj)
                {
                    $(""#""+obj.id).height(""64px"").width(""48px"") ;
                    reshrink(parseInt(obj.id[obj.id.length-1]));

                }
                function reshrink(id)
                {
                    document.getElementById('testvalue').innerHTML+=document.getElementById(""hello2"").style.left ;

                    for(var i=id+1;i&lt;=4;i++)
                    {
                        $(""#hello""+i).stop().animate({""left"":""-=60px""},1000) ;
                    }

                    document.getElementById('testvalue').innerHTML+=document.getElementById(""hello2"").style.left ;
                }
            &lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;

        &lt;body&gt;

            &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;div id=""formWrapper"" style=""height:180;width:530;""&gt;

                &lt;div id=""wrapper""  style=""position:relative;bottom:20px;width:460px;left:40px;height:160px;background-color:green;overflow:auto;"" ""&gt;

                    &lt;div id=""hello1"" style=""position:absolute;left:0px;height:64px;bottom:0px;width:48px; background-color:black;color:white;"" onmouseover=""resize(this);"" onmouseout=""shrink(this)""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div id=""hello2"" style=""position:absolute;left:49px;bottom:0px;height:64px;width:48px; background-color:maroon;color:white;"" onmouseover=""resize(this);"" onmouseout=""shrink(this)""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                  
                    &lt;div id=""hello3"" style=""position:absolute;left:98px;bottom:0px;height:64px;width:48px; background-color:brown;color:white;"" onmouseover=""resize(this);"" onmouseout=""shrink(this)""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div id=""hello4"" style=""position:absolute;left:147px;bottom:0px;height:64px;width:48px; background-color:white;color:white;"" onmouseover=""resize(this);"" onmouseout=""shrink(this)""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div id=""testvalue"" style=""position:absolute;top:390px;background-color:yellow;height:100px;width:400px;""&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

It is quite simple really, nothing too complicated in it.


What I found is that when the mouseover and out is rapid or maybe the animation isn't complete - the divs change more than the offset and eventually it overlaps.
Can someone please suggest how to solve this problem?

**EDIT:**

To test, rapidly move mouse over the first div.

Lets say we have one account on <a href=""http://tunnelbroker.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tunnelbroker.net/</a> and one on <a href=""http://www.sixxs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sixxs.net/</a>. Each of these resources provides tunnelling for IPv4 to IPv6 and, as far as I understand, on the output you get access to IPv6 networks and an IPv6 address, respectively.</p>

<p>The question is the following - I need an application with two threads, each of them will use its own tunneling options, such as Server IPv4 Address, Available DNS Resolvers etc. Obviously, threads have to work in parallel + bear in mind there might be more then two of them. Is it possible to somehow organize this without modifying global windows settings with netsh? Maybe there's a way to set tunnelling options for thread only, like it's done in <code>HttpWebRequest</code>:</p>

<pre><code>HttpWebRequest.Proxy = new WebProxy(); //
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so if we go to lower-level API, what do I need to do to put defaul HttpWebRequests/Responses inside such a tunnel (if I understand correctly, ofc)?</p>

<p>*EDITED</p>

<p>These are the the settings tunnelbroker.com advises to apply for default tunneling to work:</p>

<pre><code>netsh interface teredo set state disabled
netsh interface ipv6 add v6v4tunnel IP6Tunnel my_ip_here server_ip_here
netsh interface ipv6 add address IP6Tunnel 2001:470:18:201::2
netsh interface ipv6 add route ::/0 IP6Tunnel 2001:470:18:201::1

<p>Some background info: I'm using RxJava to implement MVVM pattern. My ViewModel encapsulates ""bindable properties"" that are <code>BehaviorSubject</code>s. I'm binding them to UI elements as observables, ensuring that the interface gets constantly updated (and thanks to using <code>BehaviorSubject</code>, it's going to happen even if the subscription takes place after setting the value).</p>

<p>I would still like to be able to access the latest (the actual) ""raw"" value of the property, for business logic.</p>

<p>How do I do that? </p>

<p>Surely <code>BehaviorSubject</code> caches it somehow, given that it republishes the latest value for whoever subscribes to it.</p>

<p>And yet <code>BehaviorSubject.last()</code> only returns an <code>Observable&lt;T&gt;</code>, and it doesn't seem to expose any methods of <code>T</code> return type.</p>

<p>I know I could cache it myself, but it feels redundant. </p>

<p>I guess I could also create a throw-away subscription in my getter, only to obtain the latest value with it and then return it to the calling code, but this seems clunky. </p>

<p>Is there anything neater on hand?</p>

<p>Well i know there will be a unique session id that will be generated upon first action getting called. I know that we can write interceptors which are called before actions where we can perform necessary checks. But i am not getting what to do when user puts the context path in the url like <code>localhost:8080/WarFileName</code></p>

<p>So I want to know is there a way where i can call a action and check whether there is any session id exists on the next time when i enter <code>localhost:8080/WarFileName</code></p>

<p>Currently issue in my application is even though use has logged in to the application, if i open a new tab and again put <code>localhost:8080/WarFileName</code> it is taking me to <code>index.jsp</code>
I am not getting how to google this also. Any suggestion/solution would be a great help for a beginner like me.</p>

<p>This is what I do for each category. What I want is if there are added items, no delete link to be provided. The only thing I could think of was to have two arrays - one with the categories with items, the others with the categories without items, and to to this for loop for both of them. But this will lead to code duplication - everything will be the same only the one loop won't have <code>&lt;a href=""{{ path('delete_category', {'id': c.id}) }}""&gt; &lt;i class=""icon-remove""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> this row and it doesn't seem very elegant. i was thinking of something like </p>

<pre><code>if(c.name not member of array_with_categories_without_items) 
then display the delete link
</code></pre>

<p>but I don't know if there is a way to do this. Can someone please give me some ideas? Thank you very much in advance! :)</p>

The current reporting system is dependent upon a series of views that obscure a lot of the complex data logic of the application.  These views place a heavy burden on the system when they are called.  </p>

<p>We are interested in using the ""fast refresh"" for incremental updates to perform some of the complex query logic prior to use in reporting; however, there is a concern within the organization that the materialized view logs (which are required for this fast refresh) will have an impact on our current transaction performance in the database.  This performance is very essential to our organization therefore there is a great fear of any change.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the type of materialized view log we would need to implement:</p>

<pre><code>create materialized view log on transaction
  with rowid, sequence(transaction_id,account_id,order_id,currency_id,price,transaction_date,payment_processor_id)
  including new values;
</code></pre>

<p>We would not be using the ""on commit"" clause for updates but rather the ""on demand"" clause in creation of the view, as we understand this would have a performance impact.</p>

<p>Will implementing this type of logging affect database transaction performance?  I imagine that it must slightly affect performance as there is an additional write procedure (to the log) that is wrapped in the commit, but I cannot find any reference to this in the Oracle documentation.  Any literature or advice on this subject would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

The AssetManager class offers the method ""open"" and you can pass AssetManager.ACCESS_RANDOM to that method. The documentation says, you kann seek forward and backward in the file (especially seeking backward is what I need), whenn passing ACCESS_RANDOM.
However, the open method always returns an InputStream object, no matter which access mode was requested.
So my question is: how can I call seek methods on that InputStream that does not offer such methods? To which class must I cast the InputStream? I've been searching the web for that problem for some time now, but I could not find anything that helped me.</p>

<p>This code simply copies data from device memory to shared memory and back to device memory. I have the following three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the transfer from device memory to shared memory in this case guaranteed to take 4 memory transactions? I believe it depends on how cudaMalloc allocates memory; if the memory is allocated in a haphazard manner such that the data is scattered over memory, then it will take more than 4 memory transactions. However, if cudaMalloc allocates memory in 128 byte chunks or it allocates memory contiguously, then it should not take more than 4 memory transactions.</li>
<li>Does the above logic also hold for writing data from shared memory to device memory i.e., the transfer will complete in 4 memory transactions.</li>
<li>Can this code cause bank conflicts. I believe that this code will not cause bank conflicts, if threads are assigned ids sequentially. However, if thread 32 and 64 are scheduled to run in the same warp, then this code can cause bank conflicts.</li>
</ol>

<p>We use <em>Amazon S3</em> in our project as a storage for files uploaded by clients.</p>

<p>For technical reasons, we <em>upload a file to S3 with a temporary name</em>, then process its contents and <em>rename the file</em> after it has been processed. </p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>The <em>'rename' operation fails time after time</em> with <code>404 (key not found)</code> error, although the file being renamed had been uploaded successfully. </p>

<p><a href=""http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/amazon/api/amazon-s3-api/docs/concepts#DataConsistencyModel"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon docs</a> mention this problem: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within Amazon's data centers. 
  If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely stored. However, information about the changes must replicate across Amazon S3, which can take <strong><em>some time</em></strong>, and so you might observe the following behaviors:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We implemented a kind of <em>polling as workaround</em>: retry the 'rename' operation until it succeeds. <br>
<em>The polling stops after 20 seconds.</em> </p>

<p>This workaround works in most cases: the file gets replicated within few seconds. <br>
But <em>sometimes</em> — very rarely — <em>20 seconds are not enough; the replication in S3 takes more time.</em> </p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What is the maximum time <em>you observed</em> between a successful PUT operation and complete replication on Amazon S3?</strong> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does Amazon S3 offer a way to 'bypass' replication?</strong> (Query 'master' directly?) </p></li>

<p>So I have the following example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=“transferService” class=“com.acme.TransferServiceImpl”&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=“accountRepository”/&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=“customerRepository”/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean id=“accountRepository” class=“com.acme.AccountRepositoryImpl”/&gt;
&lt;bean id=“customerRepository” class=“com.acme.CustomerRepositoryImpl”/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Ok. It is pretty clear for me what happens: first the <strong>accountRepository</strong> bean is created as an <strong>com.acme.AccountRepositoryImpl</strong> instance and the <strong>customerRepository</strong> bean is created as an <strong>com.acme.CustomerRepositoryImpl</strong> instance</p>

<p>Then is created the <strong>transferService</strong> bean as an istance of the <strong>com.acme.TransferServiceImpl</strong> class and the previous 2 bean are injected as input paramether of the constructor during the bean construction.</p>

<p>This is clear. My doubt is related to the fact that on the documentation I read that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Parameters injected according to their type</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What it exactly means? It seems to me that in the previous configuration the beans are injected according to their id.</p>

<p>The previous statement means that Spring check the type and for example if the constructor of the <strong>TransferServiceImpl</strong> class take 2 paramethers having type <strong>AccountRepositoryImpl</strong> and <strong>CustomerRepositoryImpl</strong> it perform the matching?</p>

<p>So it means that:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=“transferService” class=“com.acme.TransferServiceImpl”&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=“accountRepository”/&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=“customerRepository”/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>is the same thing of:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=“transferService” class=“com.acme.TransferServiceImpl”&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=“customerRepository”/&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=“accountRepository”/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Changing the order of the paramethers the result don't change because Spring perform the matching for me? If yes what happens if in the constructor I have more paramether that have the same type?</p>

<p>Tnx</p>

<p>Note the ""embed"" tag was no longer there and an ""img"" was instead created.  I don't really know why WLW sent what it sent and how to fix this issue, could someone help point out please.</p>

<p>As you can see the date of event is identical to the key of the map. So my goal is that the link table looks like <code>eventsByDate</code> would be a set. That's actually my current solution but the downside is that Set isn't navigable for <code>DateTime</code>. But this is needed by our business logic.</p>

<p>Has Hibernate some ""magical"" annotation for that? Or do I need to implement a specific usertype. I'm actually new to hibernate, so I would appreciated an example. Thanks.</p>

<p>PS: The code up there is just a short example of the problem. So please do not killing me for implementing an answering machine.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: 15.11.2012</strong></p>

<p>I figure out that <code>@MapKey(name = ""date"")</code> does the trick. But this doesn't solves the hole problem. JPA just support the <code>Collection</code> and the <code>Map</code> interface. With hibernates <code>@Sort</code> I can use <code>SortedMap</code>. But the least common interface is <code>NavigableMap</code> (TreeMap). So I stuck again.</p>

<p>Now, I have the following function:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt; class VERTEXPROPERTIES &gt;
VERTEXPROPERTIES&amp; properties(const Vertex&amp; v) const
{   
    typename property_map&lt;FilteredGraphContainer, vertex_properties_t&gt;::const_type param = get(vertex_properties, graph_);

    return param[v];
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I use this function in a class template like this:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt; class VERTEXPROPERTIES, class EDGEPROPERTIES &gt;
class Graph
{
// all the code
};
</code></pre>

<p>it works.
However, when I want to use it in a class like this:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt; class GRAPH, class EDGE_PREDICATE, class VERTEX_PREDICATE &gt;
class FilteredGraph
{
// all the code
};
</code></pre>

<p>and apply the properties() function to a FilteredGraph object, the compiler complains that it can't find the function.<br>
As far as I have found out so far this is probably due to the missing template-parameter in the arguments list.<br>
For the Graph-class, this template-parameter is easy to find out, as it gets defined when creating a Graph-object.<br>
But for the FilteredGraph, it should be able to deduce it from the GRAPH-template parameter.<br>
Then again, I think that the compiler nevertheless will have problems getting the right return-value type as this might probably be necessary to find out beforehand...<br>
I would really like to keep that concept with the properties() function as it allows to keep the other functions generic.<br>
Do you have any ideas how to solve that issue, possibly keeping the concept?</p>

<p>My problem lies in the last step of the OAuth dance, when I get the access token back from the authentication server in the url</p>

<pre><code>mydomain.com/home/#access_token=hdzjkdnba89fenbjkéz38U0D903ç&amp;...

<p><code>mydomain.com/home</code> being the redirect URI, obviously.</p>

<p>Just a fraction of second after the redirection, AngularJS changes the URL in something like</p>

<pre><code>mydomain.com/#/my-default-view
</code></pre>

<p>and consequently the access token is erased from the URL.</p>

<p>A few things now:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am not allowed to define a redirect URI containing a hash ('#') for my OAuth2 client. Hence something like <code>mydomain.com/#/auth-complete/</code> would <strong>not</strong> be OK.</li>
<li>I use <code>$routeProvider.otherwise('/')</code>.</li>
<li>I tried to set <code>$locationProvider.html5Mode(true);</code> to remove the '#' in the middle but the problem is the same (the URL and the access token are erased instantly after redirection).</li>
<li>As the access token is still accessible in the HTTP response even after the URL is modified by Angular, I could probably use an <code>$http</code> interceptor but that sounds a bit too much for this common task isn't it?</li>

So far I have attempted doing this using a linearlayout and found that this is the wrong approach. I have then attempted using a relative layout however this has not worked for me so I hope that someone can point out how I can make this work.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram of what I am trying to build.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HnzKZ.png"" alt=""ListView Item Layout""></p>

<p>Here is some more details about the diagram:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Only elements 5 and 6 have the same content for every list item. The
rest of elements all will have different text however the layout
should always be the same size.</p></li>
<li><p>Element 4 should only be 2 lines. Elements 1, 2 and 3 should only be 1<br>
line.</p></li>
<li><p>Element 2 should be aligned left and element 3 should be aligned<br>
right.</p></li>
<li><p>Element 2 and 3 should each be half of the width of element 4.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is my attempt at this layout using a RelativeLayout.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble, specifically, with constructing a DPDA that accepts the following language:</p>

<p>L = { 0<sup>n</sup> 1<sup>m</sup> | n ≥ m }</p>

<p>My approach is to make the initial state a final state that can push 0's to the stack for input 0's then transition to another final state that can pop 0's from the stack for input 1's. I believe this solution is correct, but it seems unusual for every state to be a final state, and I want to verify that my approach is valid.</p>

<p>Is this the correct approach? Can I have both states as final states? Here is the exact transition function δ for my DPDA.</p>

<p>Try with iPad / Safari mobile and you will notice the the first time you scroll the footer (red block). It scrolls up out of position, untill you stop scrolling. On your second attempt it all works well.</p>

<p>When you reload the page it all happens again.</p>

<p>I think it´s the support for position fixed that is buggy.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to solve this? Perhaps with jQuery.</p>

public class Children {
    private String name;
    private String age;

<p>Using a Utility Class, I decided to hard code the POJOs as follows: </p>

<pre><code>public class FamilyUtil {

    public static Family getFamily() {
        Family family = new Family();
        family.setFather(""Joe"");

        List&lt;Children&gt; children = new ArrayList&lt;Children&gt;();

        children.add(child);

        family.setChildren(children);
        return family;

    }
}

<p>When I run this using:</p>

<pre><code>curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/mywebservice

<p>I get this in my Eclipse's console (which is exactly what I want from curl command):</p>

<pre><code>{

  ""mother"": ""Jennifer"",
  ""children"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""Jimmy"",
      ""age"": ""12"",
      ""gender"": ""male""
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>But from the command line curl command listed above, I get this 
(there are 4 spaces after \n but JavaRanch's forum doesn't show it):</p>

<p>How can I make the JSON formatting to be identical to what I am getting in Eclipse's console by using the curl command?</p>

So far, I've been able to do most things, but I'm stuck when it comes to finding out the state of container when I first start my manager app. When I first create a <a href=""http://cargo.codehaus.org/maven-site/cargo-core/apidocs/org/codehaus/cargo/container/Container.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Container</a> instance, <a href=""http://cargo.codehaus.org/maven-site/cargo-core/apidocs/org/codehaus/cargo/container/Container.html#getState%28%29"" rel=""nofollow"">container.getState()</a> always returns <a href=""http://cargo.codehaus.org/maven-site/cargo-core/apidocs/org/codehaus/cargo/container/State.html"" rel=""nofollow"">State.UNKNOWN</a>. The problem is that an extra JVM is created if I try to start a container that's already started, and my app hangs if I try to stop a container that is not currently running. My approach is like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ConfigurationFactory configurationFactory = new DefaultConfigurationFactory();
LocalConfiguration configuration = (LocalConfiguration) configurationFactory.createConfiguration(containerId, ContainerType.INSTALLED, ConfigurationType.STANDALONE, CARGO_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY);
DefaultContainerFactory containerFactory = new DefaultContainerFactory();
InstalledLocalContainer container = (InstalledLocalContainer) containerFactory.createContainer(containerId, ContainerType.INSTALLED, configuration);
assert container.getState() == State.UNKNOWN;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to find out what the actual state of the container is? The only information I can find about a container's state (before actually starting/stopping the container) is whether it's installed (via <a href=""http://cargo.codehaus.org/maven-site/cargo-core/apidocs/org/codehaus/cargo/container/installer/ZipURLInstaller.html#isAlreadyInstalled%28%29"" rel=""nofollow"">ZipURLInstaller.isAlreadyInstalled()</a>).</p>

"20267286","1","","","2013-11-28 13:18:04","","3","849","<p>I'm running <code>Grails</code> with the <code>Spring Security</code> plugin. On the clientside I'm running <code>AngularJS</code> from where I want to authenticate the user. Ideally I want to use the <code>$http</code> module from Angular, but apparently it does not follow a <code>Location:</code> header sent by the server. </p>

<p>What's happening is that the Spring Security returns a <code>302 Moved temporarily</code> which should be queried/followed automatically like <code>jQuery</code> does.</p>

<p>The <code>jQuery</code> snippet below works fine and creates a new <code>GET</code> request based on the <code>Location: ""http://agrarius.nl/login/ajaxSuccess""</code> response header:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: serverUri+'/j_spring_security_check?ajax=true', 
    data: data,
    method: 'POST'
})
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>AngularJS</code> approach does not seem to follow anything and just quits:</p>

<pre><code>// Setup Config
var data = {
    j_username: $scope.user.email,
    j_password: $scope.user.password
}

var config = {
    method: 'POST', 
    url: serverUri+'/j_spring_security_check?ajax=true', 
    data: $.param(data),
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},

};

// Dispatch HTTP Request
$http(config)
.success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
    if (data.status) {
        // successful login
        User.isLogged = true;
        User.username = data.username;
    }
    else {
        User.isLogged = false;
        User.username = '';
    }
    $scope.loggingIn = false;
})
.error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
    $scope.loggingIn = false;
    User.isLogged = false;
    User.username = '';

    if (status == 0) {
        // Request got cancelled
        console.log(""Request got cancelled."");
        return;
    }
});

<p>Any idea why it doesn; function this way? And is it 'safe' to use jQuery instead? :)</p>

I have written an application relying on two pthreads, one of them reading data from a gps device and writing it to a text file and the second one is doing exactly the same but with a temperature sensor. On my laptop (Intel® Core™ i3-380M, 2.53GHz) I am have the program nicely working and writing to my files up to the frequencies at which both of the devices send information (10 Hz and 500 Hz respectively). </p>

<p>The real problem emerges when I compile and execute my C program to run on the RPi; The performance of my program running on RPi considerably decreases, having my GPS log file written with a frequency of 3 Hz and the temperature log file at a frequency of 17 Hz (17 measurements written per second).. </p>

<p>I do not really know why I am getting those performance problems with my code running on the PI. Is it because of the RPi has only a 700 MHz ARM Processor and it can not process such a Multithreaded application? Or is it because my two threads routines are perturbing the nice work normally carried out by the PI? Thanks a lot in advance Guys....!!!</p>

<p>Here my code. I am posting just one thread function because I tested the performance with just one thread and it is still writing at a very low frequency (~4 Hz). At first, the main function:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int s1_hand = 0;
    pthread_t routines[2];
    printf(""Creating Thread -&gt; Main Thread Busy!\n"");

    s1_hand = pthread_create(&amp;(routines[1]), NULL, thread_2, (void *)&amp;(routines[1]));

    if (s1_hand != 0){
        printf(""Not possible to create threads:[%s]\n"", strerror(s1_hand));
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    pthread_join(routines[1], NULL);

    void* result;
    if ((pthread_join(routines[1], &amp;result)) == -1) {
        perror(""Cannot join thread 2"");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    pthread_exit(NULL);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, thread number 2 function:</p>

<pre><code>void *thread_2(void *parameters) {
    printf(""Thread 2 starting...\n"");
    int fd, chars, parsing, c_1, parse, p_parse = 1;
    double array[3];
    fd =  open(""dev/ttyUSB0"", O_RDONLY | O_NOCTTY | O_SYNC);
    if (fd &lt; 0){
        perror(""Unable to open the fd!"");
        exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    FILE *stream_a, *stream_b;
    stream_a = fdopen(fd, ""r"");
    stream_b = fopen (FILE_I, ""w+"");
    if (stream_a == NULL || stream_b == NULL){
        perror(""IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE STREAMS"");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    c_1 = fgetc(stream_a);
    parse = findit(p_parse, c_1, array);
    printf(""First Parse Done -&gt; (%i)\n"", parse);
    while ((chars = fgetc(stream_a)) != EOF){
        parsing = findit(0, (uint8_t)chars, array);
        if (parsing == 1){
            printf(""MESSAGE FOUND AND SAVED -&gt; (%i)\n"", parsing);
            fprintf(stream_b,""%.6f %.3f %.3f %.3f\n"", time_stamp(), array[0], array[1], array[2]);
        }
    }
    fflush(stream_b);

    fclose(stream_b);
    fclose(stream_a);

    close(fd);

    pthread_exit(NULL);

    return 0;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Note that on my thread 2 function I am using findit(), function which returns 0 or 1 in case of having found and parsed a message from the gps, writing the parsed info in my array (0 no found, 1 found and parsed). The function time_stamp() just call the clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;time_stamp) function in order to have a time reference on each written event. Hope with this information you guys can help me. Thank you!</p>

When app receives <code>Deactivated</code> event, it iterates through all the tokens and cancels them.</p>

<p>The problem is that the thread with long-running operation is not scheduled to run when app deactivates, and this means if I'm trying to use <code>CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();</code> in that thread, it's only called when app resumes, not when app deactivates. And of course this is not what I want. If I'm doing a simple trick like <code>token.Register(() =&gt; Thread.Sleep(1000));</code>, i.e. pausing thread which calls to cancellation for a moment, then second thread has a chance to run, and everything is cancelled like a charm. However, this is a dirty hack and I don't want to use it in my app.</p>

<p>The question is how to make sure app is not exiting while operation cancellation is finished? I assume that sign of cooperative cancellation is OperationCancelledException thrown, but how to wait for it, especially if I only have a reference to CancellationTokenSource, but not to the Task object? Is there some other way to know about that?</p>

<p>Much thanks in advance!</p>

This helps generate the statements and their syntax to define the contents of a suppression file. That suppression file can be fed into valgrind the next time.
This is for instance useful to suppress those ""Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)"" messages that are so often reported but not really a problem. I wish there was an easy way for valgrind to just not bother telling me about conditional jump issues, but it appears to be stern about having to tell me about it.</p>

<p>Just wondering what's the best approach for this ? I'm not sure if this can be handled using a complex generic regex as the exclusion patterns are not predictable. I was thinking of removing the wildcards and create two seperate List for exact match and contains match, then have the input url iterate against the two lists.</p>

<p>Any pointers will be appreciated.</p>

            //Clean up multiple dashes or whitespaces

<p>So<code>$value</code> is an array. For every variable I'm removing the whitespace and replace it by a dash. I need to echo every variable outside the foreach function. I also tried to implode the variable first but with no results. How to do this? Thanks!</p>

<p>Here are constants and imported methods that I use:</p>

SetForegroundWindow(windowHandle);

<p>Is it possible with <code>SWTBot</code> to find which Composite I am dealing with? 
This <code>SashForm</code> exist inside a tab, just like <code>“Package Explorer”</code>, for example. How does <code>SWTBot</code> identify which tab is it now dealing with. </p>

<p>The 2 steps I have taken so far are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>1. Removed comment in project.properties file to enable Proguard

2. Right clicked on project&gt;Android tools&gt;Export unsigned Application Project
</code></pre>

<p>I then used <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/"" rel=""nofollow"">apktool</a> to view the source code from the extracted APK. </p>

<p>What I noticed is that Proguard is not obfuscating the source code in the App. it is only obfuscating the <code>ActionBarActivity</code> super class and <code>XML Layout</code> names. Shown Below:</p>

<pre><code> package com.example.proguardtesttt;

    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.support.v7.a.f;
    import android.view.Menu;
    import android.view.MenuInflater;
    import android.view.MenuItem;

    public class MainActivity extends f
    {
      protected void onCreate(Bundle paramBundle)
      {
        super.onCreate(paramBundle);
        setContentView(2130903064);
      }

      public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu paramMenu)
      {
        getMenuInflater().inflate(2131492864, paramMenu);
        return true;
      }

      public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem paramMenuItem)
      {
        if (paramMenuItem.getItemId() == 2131034172)
          return true;
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(paramMenuItem);
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this happening? And how can I ensure to obfuscate all my source code also? </p>

<p>Note: I am almost certain that Proguard is enabled as the .apk is 300kb less than an identical .apk that does not have proguard enabled. </p>

<p>-Putting &lt;*iframe src=""{name}.tumblr.com/tagged/xyz""> inside &lt;*div id=""123"">. This does not work because tagged pages show the entire html document of the default tumblr page. So basically it displays the page you're looking at within itself.</p>

Because there's referential constraint on DB itself that ensures there's a record in the right table, so <code>inner join</code> should be used instead (and it would work much faster)</p>

<p>If relation was <strong>many to 0..1</strong> <code>left outer join</code> would be correct.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is it possible to write LINQ in a way so it will translate to <code>inner join</code> rather than <code>left outer join</code>. It would speed query execution a lot... I haven't used eSQL before, but would it be wise to use it in this case? Would it solve my problem?</p>

<p>If someone could test if the same is true on Microsoft SQL server it would also give me some insight if this is Devart's issue or it's a general L2EF functionality... But I suspect EF is the culprit here.</p>

The UAV sends the location information on a server and has a php code that returns some sensor values upon relevant request (in geojson format, so I dont have to do much... phew). I was looking for some solutions for how to do it seamlessly using Ajax when i came across <a href=""https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/leaflet-ajax"" rel=""nofollow"">leaflet_Ajax.</a>. I had a lot of issues which were mostly resolved by some questions on stackoverflow for example <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20485723/add-external-geojson-to-leaflet-layer"">this one</a> and a few others.</p>

<p>Now here is how i am writing my code for the markers for the points:</p>

<pre><code>var geojsonLayer = new L.GeoJSON.AJAX(""myserver/get_geoj.php?stype=particle&amp;sval[min]=2&amp;sval[max]=26"",{pointToLayer: redmarkers, onEachFeature: popUp});
function popUp(feature, layer) {
    layer.bindPopup(feature.properties.sensor_v);
},
</code></pre>

<p>I have another function redmarkers that returns red colored circle markers. What happens is that finally it is loading the data from the server... phewh.... but it does not bind the popup or the markers to this layer. It looks for the (I guess some) default marker images in the js/images/marker-icon.png as marker symbol. This doesnot exist and so it gives me an error. But if i take any random image and call it marker-icon.png and put it in the desired location it shows that image on the map but still does not bind the popup.</p>

<p>What am i doing wrong. As i am new to stack overflow as well if you need more information or if i am not asking the question right please let me know.</p>

<p>When i use this site: <a href=""http://aesencryption.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aesencryption.net/</a>
the encryption and decryption works perfectly.

<p>changing the key size is not really an option, seeing how this should be working.</p>

<p>Why am i using AES?
I am communicating between two servers (one being a third party) and the information being transferred in the communication could be a security leak if not encrypted. otherwise i would use a hashing. This data <strong>needs</strong> to be recoverable by a 3rd party with a key.</p>

<p>So for example, if user select copper for the first table row, and select steel for the second table row, the corresponding <code>p</code> will populate text ""1"" and ""3"" to the html page. If user do not select both rows, only the row that is selected will populate corresponding data to the <code>p</code> tag.</p>

<p>I am green to jQuery so I wrote some js code but it does not work as expected:
the variable that stores the <code>json</code> data is named as <code>jasonData</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$('select').on('change', function (e){

           $.each(jasonData, function(i, v) {
                if (jasonData.metalTypeName == $('select').val()) {
                           $('p').text(v.metalTypeId);
                           return;
                }
           }); //end each()

});  // end on()
</code></pre>

<p>By looking at my code I already know one issue, the <code>p</code> and <code>select</code> select both two table row fields, but I do not know how to correctly fix it. The code may have other issues, please advice.</p>

<p>I'm working with project where I have to resize a lot of <strong>DOM</strong> element and wondering how to optimize it.</p>

<p>Now I'm everything doing with <strong>jQuery</strong> resize method, but maybe there is more effective way to do it.</p>

<p>Now my problem is that then I'm resizing window it's starts to lag till all calculations are done, because it's resizing inner holder elements to fit it's holder.</p>

<p>Maybe it's better to use pure <strong>javascript</strong> rather then <strong>jQuery</strong> resize method?</p>

<p>Thanks in future.</p>

I downloaded a control from NuGet called XamlCropControl. It works pretty well for the UI and even give me information like Original Height/Width The position of the cropped top/bottom/left/right/width/height all within the xaml control. my question is as how to take that information and crop the the image using WriteableBitmapEx. So far this is my code and i'm having a problem.</p>

<pre><code>private async void ProfilePhotoImageClick(object sender, TappedRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    FileOpenPicker openPicker = new FileOpenPicker();
    openPicker.ViewMode = PickerViewMode.Thumbnail;
    openPicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.PicturesLibrary;

    openPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add("".jpg"");
    openPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add("".jpeg"");
    openPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add("".png"");

    StorageFile file = await openPicker.PickSingleFileAsync();

    if (file != null)
    {
        using (Windows.Storage.Streams.IRandomAccessStream fileStream = await file.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.Read))
        {

            imagetoResize = bitmapImage;
        }
    }

BitmapImage imagetoResize;

private void AcceptPhotoImageCropClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    WriteableBitmap bmp = new WriteableBitmap(0,0).FromContent(imagetoResize);
    var croppedBmp = bmp.Crop(0, 0, bmp.PixelWidth / 2, bmp.PixelHeight / 2);
    croppedBmp.SaveToMediaLibrary(""ProfilePhoto.jpg"");

<p>PhotoUploadCropper is the xamlcropcontrol.</p>

<p><a href=""http://puu.sh/ij8t9/dc028bd53b.png"" rel=""nofollow"">This is the information from xamlcropcontrol</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://puu.sh/ij8Jw/36d34a2b98.png"" rel=""nofollow"">This is the problem im having</a></p>

<p>It tells me there is no deffinition for FromContent if i have the (imagetoResize) there but if i remove it i get no error. After all the cropping is done it will be uploading to azure blob storage which i have already setup.</p>

The website developer normally just has to include a Javascript and provide a callback to handle the login response. From my understanding of the JavaScript security in browsers, this should not be possible.</p>

<p>I've read several methods of cross-origin JavaScript communication, such as <a href=""http://ternarylabs.com/2011/03/27/secure-cross-domain-iframe-communication/"" rel=""nofollow"">Porthole</a> or <a href=""http://easyxdm.net/wp/"" rel=""nofollow"">easyXDM</a>. In each of these methods, a small static HTML file is required to be hosted by the developer so that either Facebook or Google (i.e., the 'included' content) can communicate back to the parent frame. An example would be an application (app.example.com) that included an iframe from Google (google.com) which includes an iframe from the application again (app.example.com). The innermost iframe's JavaScript can communicate with the top most window since they are in the same domain (via <code>this.parent.parent</code>).</p>

<p>However, this requires that the innermost iframe contain a 'receiver' page on the app.example.com domain. It's sole purpose is to read it's URL bar and then pass that data up to the parent window. With the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/add-button"" rel=""nofollow"">Google</a> and <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/login-button"" rel=""nofollow"">Facebook</a> solutions however, no static HTML page is needed. <strong>So what mechanism are they using to pass the data back up if not a static receiver page?</strong> The JavaScript in their frame should have no access to the parent JavaScript. The <code>Window.PostMessage</code> seems <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.postMessage"" rel=""nofollow"">dubious at best</a>, seeing as it's IE8, IE9, and IE10 implementations are <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16226924/is-cross-origin-postmessage-broken-in-ie10"">either broken or quirky</a>.</p>

<p>Judging this example, Outlook uses non-standard labeling for its timezones.<br>
I'm currently testing against Microsoft Outlook 2010 (14.0.6117.5001) SP1.
Would anyone know of an iCal mod or some sort of work around to allow the timezones to be fully compatible with Microsoft Outlook?  Or even another api which will allow me to create Outlook-compatible .ics files? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>My Google-fu is failing me.  What may be causing the above error and how should I go about fixing it?</p>

<p>BTW, on the theory that it might be the Linux or Mac firewalls, I tried opening a browser on the Fedora box and requesting <code>http://172.30.42.19:5672</code>.  I got a (tiny) answer in return, so the firewall looks less likely to be the problem.</p>

<pre><code>app.get('/profile', isLoggedIn, function(req, res) {
    res.render('profilePage/profilePage.html', {
        user : req.user // get the user out of session and pass to template
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in my profile HTML, I can access my user property like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%=user.local.firstname%&gt;'s Profile
</code></pre>

<p>However, I want to allow Stripe to send the user's credit card info via the Stripetoken. I have managed to include a variable amount from a text field the user inputs. However, I want to append the user property so I can use it in my callback. Here is the javascript/jquery that's included in the profile html:</p>

<pre><code>                      &lt;!-- New section --&gt;
                  &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

                    Stripe.setPublishableKey('pkkey');

                   var stripeResponseHandler = function(status, response) {
                     var $form = $('#contactForm');
                     var $amount = $('#amount').val();


                     if (response.error) {
                       // Show the errors on the form
                       $form.find('.payment-errors').text(response.error.message);
                       $form.find('button').prop('disabled', false);
                     } else {
                       // token contains id, last4, and card type
                       var token = response.id;

                       // Insert the token into the form so it gets submitted to the server
                       $form.append($('&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""stripeToken"" /&gt;').val(token));
                       $form.append($('&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""amount"" /&gt;').val($amount));
                       // and re-submit
                       $form.get(0).submit();
                     }
                   };

                   jQuery(function($) {
                     $('#contactForm').submit(function(e) {
                       var $form = $(this);

                       // Disable the submit button to prevent repeated clicks
                       $form.find('button').prop('disabled', true);

                       Stripe.card.createToken($form, stripeResponseHandler);

                       // Prevent the form from submitting with the default action
                       return false;
                     });
                   });
                 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I have managed to append the $amount variable so I can access it in the callback:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = function(app, passport) {

app.post('/stripe', function(req,res) {
    // =====STRIPETOKEN======
    var transaction = req.body;
    var stripeToken = transaction.stripeToken;
    var donationAmount = transaction.amount;

    stripe.customers.create({
      source           : stripeToken,
      account_balance  : 0
    },function(err, customer) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        } else {
            console.log(""Success!"");
    }});
    // ====CREATE CHARGE======
    var charge =
        {
       amount    : donationAmount, 
       currency  : 'USD',
       card      : stripeToken
        };
        stripe.charges.create(charge, function(err, charge) {
           if(err)
            console.log(err);
            else
          {
                res.json(charge);
                console.log('Successful charge sent to Stripe!');
                console.log(charge);
          };
      });
    // ====PROFILE PAGE REDIRECT=====
    res.render('profilePage/profilePage.html', {
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>So here's my problem. I want to pass the user's information, kind of like I did the amount, into the post method so when it redirects on success, I can pass it back in the res.render function, as well as send it to Stripe for description purposes. The only thing I can think of is to put the user info in a hidden field in HTML and access it like that, but that sounds messy and not proper. </p>

<p>This is my first time posting here so I apologize if it was too lengthy or not specific enough. Thanks!</p>

The code, binding and viewmodel implementation have all been used in basically the same way on other pages in the project and works exactly as expected there.</p>

<p>The issue in this particular scenario is that the button remains disabled even after raising the <code>.RaiseCanExecuteChanged()</code> method, and the <code>CanExecute()</code> returns <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>I originally thought that it might be due to excess calls to manually raising the notification with property changes, so have tightened that part of my code so that the method is only raised as needed, and when it is needed to change the button's status. Even still, the button remains disabled despite <code>CanExecute()</code> returning <code>true</code>.
If I comment out all the checks in <code>CanExecute()</code> and default to true, the button is enabled as expected, and when tapped fires the expected <code>Execute()</code> function, so it appears that the initialization of the <code>RelayCommand</code> is ok. If I then let the checks back in, and run step through each time <code>CanExecute()</code> is fired, when it returns true, the button doesn't become enabled.</p>

<p>Any ideas? For what its worth, I've added code below, but I don't think that is the cause.</p>

<p><code>RelayCommand</code> class is the standard class that comes with the HubApp in VS, so I will omit that code.</p>

<p>i added an extra field to the company entity that holds the count like: </p>

<pre><code>private employeeCount;

getEmployeeCount(){
  return count($this-&gt;employments);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and added it to the index like: </p>

<pre><code>            company:
                mappings:
                    fullname: ~ 
                    employeeCount: ~ 
</code></pre>

<p>the field is correctly indexed and i get hits like: </p>

<pre><code>""_hit"": {
""_index"": ""search"",
""_type"": ""company"",
""_id"": ""2628"",
""_source"": {
""fullname"": ""acme"",
""employeeCount"": 9,
... },
""sort"": [
""9""
]
</code></pre>

<p>i added the sort like: </p>

<pre><code>$query-&gt;addSort(array('employeeCount' =&gt; array( 'order'=&gt;'desc')));
</code></pre>

<p>and the result seems to be sorted correctly down from "" 9, 8, 7, 6 ..."",</p>

<p>but for some reason there are some results somewhere in the middle with higher employeeCount</p>

<p>for example this: </p>

<pre><code>""_hit"": {
""_index"": ""search"",
""_type"": ""company"",
""_id"": ""2668"",
""_source"": {
""fullname"": ""acme2"",
""employeeCount"": 18,
... },
""sort"": [
""18""
]
</code></pre>

<p>i expect this result to be on top of my first example but it is somewhere between 2 and 1</p>

<p>so two guesses, it is sorting from 0-10 and everything greater than 10 is ignored</p>

<p>or there is some bug in elasticsearch or foselastica bundle,</p>

<p>heres the resulting query:</p>

<pre><code>search/company/_search (GET) 5.59 ms {""sort"":[{""employeeCount"":{""order"":""desc""}}],""query"":{""wildcard"":{""fullname"":{""value"":""**"",""boost"":1}}},""size"":""2000"",""from"":0}
</code></pre>

<p>anybody any idea ? </p>

<p>In my app I must read a 4.5 Mb array to memory. As I see from Memory Monitor in Android studio, it is not deleted after pressing back and exiting to the desktop. It is not deleted by GC. Can I use the same array for the 2nd launch? The pointer to it (it's a global in MainActivity) is null every time, so I have to get a new array. But the previous isn't deleted. If I don't set the pointer to it to null and not call System.gc()  in onPause(), the app crashes with OOM. I've tried putCharArray and getCharArray, still no use. Is there any way to use the same array? Or do I have to read it every time when I open the app? It happens even after just going to Settings and back from notification bar or turning on/off physical keyboard. Android 4.0.3 AVD. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Shame on me, I even haven't thought about indexing. 
Anyway As I know, Android has an app in cache after closing it with Back button. If I just create an array, but don't make it null in onPause, the memory isn't freed by GC (as I can see in Memory Monitor). But after opening the app again the pointer is null, even if I didn't null it. Is there any way to save the pointer and this structred not in file and check if it's still in cache after opening the app again in order not to reload the file? Not after only killing the process, but even for just moving it from screen when, for instance, Settings are opened. </p>

<p>The code works fine, but i need to avoid the same record to get selected again and again.</p>

<p>For ex: if i select Item 1 from dropdown it should not be selected again. Now in this case, i can select Item 1 for 'n' number of times.</p>

<p>I need a help here.</p>

<p>Thanks

<p>The two most common are </p>

<ul>
<li>runtime error</li>
<li>Windows OLE is waiting for ...</li>
</ul>

<p>All that needs to happen when this occurs is just press ok, ctrl break, F5 and execute again. Also for reasons unknown to me the code seems to slow down after x minutes and then breaking and restarting it accelerates the speed.</p>

<p>So as a patch-all solution I'd like to do the following. After x minutes (or even better after let's say 40 iterations), automatically break the execution and start again. 
A second error-handling way which would be great is do something like</p>

<p><code>If Range(""A1"".End(xlDown)) at time t = Range(""A1"".End(xlDown)) at time t + 600 Then restart code execution Else continue code execution</code> </p>

<p>I'm basically hoping to automate my error handling so that I can run the code overnight and sleep like a baby :)</p>

<p>If I run this program in my OSX dev box (with Oracle Java 1.7.0_51) or in my Windows virtual machine (same Java version) it goes through the SSL handshake as expected. However, I tried running this code in 2 different Linux machines (one running Debian and one running Ubuntu) and I got the SSL handshake error. I tried copying my cacerts from OSX to Linux but the result was the same. Here's the very end of the SSL debug log (what happens before this is pretty standard and seems to be fine):</p>

<p>I also noticed that the program takes a little longer to run when the error happens (about 10s). Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I tried to run the program above on OpenJDK 1.6.0_18 on the ubuntu box and the result was the same. I also tried running the same code on a Debian virtual machine and it worked.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I added the debug level and compared the logs between a machine that's working and one that is not.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I mentioned before the program worked on a Debian virtual machine. It turns out that depends. If the virtual machine's network adapter is set to NAT (through my OSX dev box), it works indeed. However, if I set the network adapter to bridged and pick up a regular IP in my network, it doesn't work; it gives me the same close_notify error as my production box.</p>

<p><strong>Yet another update</strong>: I logged in one of the problematic machines and set up a reverse ssh tunnel to my box that points to the address in question. Then, I ran the sample program pointing to localhost (instead of the direct address) so that the request gets tunneled to my dev box, who delivers it to the appropriate server. And guess what? It worked. My problem isn't solved though as this is clearly not an appropriate solution.</p>

I chose to use a background-image for a layout matter because they all are different in size and aspect ratio.</p>

<p>The images comes from a db and are dynamically created.</p>

<p><strong>What I wanna do is:</strong></p>

<p>show a ""loading"" message over every <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and wait until the background(image) is loaded in the cache and then show it with a fadeIn.
They only way I can think of (not that I can since I'm not very sure how and if its doable) is:</p>

<ul>
<li>temporally unset the background for every <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> while showing the ""loading"" message</li>
<li>make a loop for every background to get the image url</li>
<li>use the $.get function to load it and then do whatever I want after loading</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the doable thing, this would imply they would load in sequence so if one won't load for some reason the script will never continue!</p>

<p>I've seen some sites that use JS to load images only when its visible by the browser, maybe this could be the same case I'm looking for, since I'm using a scroller and only a part of the images are showed at once and when the page loads</p>

<p>I've been reading the RabbitMQ docs, but have had a lot of trouble finding anything useful. </p>

<p>When a new worker starts, it generates a UUID (v6), and then subscribes to the queue <code>worker.{id}</code>, for example, <code>worker.7a277e65-8df4-4670-99b4-52c13478831d</code>.</p>

<p>From other questions, I've been able to work out that I need to create a topic exchange to allow workers to publish a message to <code>worker.*</code>, to have it sent to every worker. </p>

<p>However, I'm unsure on how this should be done. I'm using <a href=""https://github.com/hunterloftis/jackrabbit"" rel=""nofollow"">jackrabbit</a>, which does not support creating exchanges programatically, so I'll need to do it through the RabbitMQ management console, which looks like this:</p>

Our project is based on Rails, but the clean angular-seed that I was testing for comparison is running on Apache so I thought that this might be the difference - messed up paths or something in that Rails project.</p>

<p>But there are no error messages, e2e tests work... and also I assume that if some files were missing or paths were incorrect it would not be able to log that 'describe' in tests - if I understand correctly this means that Jasmine is processing the right file (there are no other dependencies in this pseudo-test). How is it possible that the 'describe' part works just fine and only 'it' part seems to be skipped?</p>

<p>I may have made a few mistakes, so they might not be doing exactly the same thing, but that's beside the point. What I was trying to do with the switch statement was create a version of ifFunc with only a single jump, by converting the result of each if statement into a numerical code that would align with a bit, so that each possible end point would have a unique numerical code.</p>

<p>This falls flat however, as the comparison functions (B > 0) etc. internally utilize jumps. It ends up with the switch version of the function being an order of magnitude slower then the if version.</p>

<p>I'd like to know if there is anyway to do a comparison statement, and have it output a zero for false and a one for true, without using (internally or otherwise) an if statement or a jump.</p>

<p>Basically, i have a python script which should start another program (.exe) via a timer after some 2-6 hours. Everything works fine as long as i test it with a short countdown or as long as the computer is ""active"" (=userinput before, screen on) before the timer expires or as long there is no other program working at the same time (an Excel VBA script in my case).</p>

<p>On Windows 7, for long countdowns and with Excel running, the external program just doesnt open. There arent any Error messages and any other (python-internal) commands AFTER that are executed as they should.</p>

<p>Im using the <strong><code>x=subprocess.Popen([program,args],flags)</code></strong> command and tried almost all possible flags (Shell, buffersize, creationflags,stdout etc.) and alternatives (call) but it behaves always as described above.</p>

<p>Now i noticed a similar behaviour when trying to open the external program via VBA, so i dont think its a Python-specific but a Windows-specific problem. Additionally i tried it on another PC with Windows Vista and there it works surprisingly (both 64-bit if that matters).</p>

<p>I already tried increasing the process priority or prevent idle state via <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa373208%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SetThreadExecutionState</a> and disabled all energy-saving features i´am aware of, but nothing changed so far.</p>

<p>I have row in a report which is a db value (Quantity - number value 51) and a formula for a Price resulting in number value 0.8. I just wanted simple multiplication 51 * 0.8 which should yield 40.80, but instead CR is giving me 40.6. I test it and try Quantity + Price (51 + 0.8). CR gives me correct 51.8 but 51 * 0.8 still 40.6.</p>

<p>Error is the same for all similar data (slightly lower than it should be).</p>

<p>Now, i resolved it by turning to SQL Expression fields, and got it working, but i wanted to share this with you.</p>

<p>Maybe I am missing something, or doing something in a very bad way, so any hints would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>51 is strait from database:</p>

<pre><code>{LineItem.Quant}
</code></pre>

<p>0.8 is calculated:</p>

<pre><code>PriceNoVAT: {LineItem.Price} * (100 - {LineItem.TAX}) / 100
PriceAfterDiscount: {@PriceNoVAT} * (100 - {LineItem.Discount}) / 100
PriceVAT: {@PriceAfterDiscount} * (100 + {LineItem.TAX}) / 100
</code></pre>

<p>I want:</p>

<pre><code>LineTotal: {LineItem.Quant} * {@PriceVAT}
</code></pre>

<p>This yiedls:</p>

<pre><code>51 * 0.8 = 40.6 (Should be 40.8)
</code></pre>

<p>I put all three fields in paper design (Quant, PriceVAT and LineTotal) and I can see them in preview: 51, 0.8 and 40.6 respectively. So CR calculates 0.8 correctly (I am expecting 0.8) but not final multiplication. </p>

<p>At the same time if I try</p>

<pre><code>LineTotal: {LineItem.Quant} + {@PriceVAT}
</code></pre>

<p>that yields correctly:</p>

<pre><code>51 + 0.8 = 51.8
</code></pre>

<p>CR always calculates this incorrectly (or me doing something wrong for that matter), for all similar data.</p>

<p>So, there you have it, I am baffled. I am by no means CR expert, but I am also no beginner. This is nothing I would expect posting questions about, but still :) </p>

<p>now, in the official <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetch.php"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>  it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If fetch_style includes PDO::FETCH_CLASSTYPE (e.g. PDO::FETCH_CLASS | PDO::FETCH_CLASSTYPE) then the name of the class is determined from a value of the first column.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so im not sure i understood exactly what they mean nor how it works.
let's say i have <code>users</code> table with one record</p>

<ul>
<li>id:1</li>
<li>name:Josh</li>
<li>so on..</li>
</ul>

<p>so how can <code>PDO::FETCH_CLASS</code> know what's the class name? can i add column to my record with the class name in a way <code>FETCH_CLASS</code> will get the class name from the database? example of record structure will be highly appreciated ...thx</p>

<p>*I am  testing this class but not the author so changing the class is irrelevant  </p>

<p>Is this still the case:</p>

<p>If there is only one CPU in a computer, only one thread can run at any one time. Windows has to keep track of the thread objects, and every so often, Windows has to decide which thread to schedule next to go to the CPU. This is additional code that has to execute once every 20 milliseconds or so. When Windows makes a CPU stop executing one thread's code and start executing another thread's code, we call this a context switch. A context switch is fairly expensive because the operating system has to:</p>

<p>So circa CLR via C# 2.0 lets say we are on Pentium 4 2.4ghz 1 core non-HT, XP. Every 20 milliseconds? Where a CLR thread or Java thread is mapped to an OS thread only a maximum of 50 threads per second <em>may</em> get a chance to to run?</p>

<p>I've read that context switching is very fast in mircoseconds here on SO, but how often roughly (magnitude style guesses) will say a modest 5 year old server Windows 2003 Pentium Xeon single core give the OS the <em>opportunity</em> to context switch? 20ms in the right area?</p>

<p>I dont need exact figures I just want to be sure that's in the right area, seems rather long to me.</p>

<p>The first three mac addresses all have 192.168.1.101 as their ip address, and the last two have 192.168.1.102 as their ip address.   Because '11:22:33' is not duplicated, it doesn't appear in the list at all.</p>

Course Domain model
CourseID (PK)
ICollection&lt;StudentCourse&gt; StudentCourses

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since the junction table (i.e. StudentCourse) contains fields other than the two foreign keys, EF will create an entity for this.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lazy Loading</strong></p>

<p>I've got this working for lazy loading. The Navigation properties have been declared with the 'virtual' keyword.</p>

<p>The Query way - works!</p>

<pre><code>var student = (from s in context.Students
               where s.StudentID == id
               select s).SingleOrDefault&lt;Student&gt;()
</code></pre>

<p>The Method way - works!</p>

<pre><code>Student student = context.Students.Find(id);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Projection</strong></p>

<p>BUT, I would prefer to do this with projection, for performance reasons, i.e. less trips to the database.</p>

<p><em>I'm really stuck on how to write up the LINQ to Entities query to return 1 student with (1 or) many StudentCourses.</em></p>

<p>I don't understand thoroughly how the Entity should be shaped, if you know what I mean.
For example, I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>var myvar = from s in context.Students
            from sc in s.StudentCourses
            where s.StudentID == id
            select s
</code></pre>

<p>What I require is to return an entity of Student with a collection of StudentCourses which could then be assigned to a Student and passed to the View model, then to the View.</p>

<p>Really would appreciate any help, as I've spent alot of time trying to solve this.</p>

<p>Also as a side note, I'm using the SingleOrDefault() method to cast the results of the var (IQueryable I think) to type Student. Is this the preferred way to cast?</p>

<p><strong>The error:</strong></p>

<p>When building the library no errors are generated and it creates successfully the static lib <code>MyClassName.a</code>.</p>

<p>In turn, when trying to import the library, I get error messages durring building/compilation: </p>

undefined reference to 'MyClassName::MyClassFunction()'

#include ""MyClassName.h""
int main(int argc, char *argv[])

<p>btw I've used QT-Creator's <em>include external library</em> function</p>

<p><strong>My guesses:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since I'm able to [Strg+Click] the functions in the main, I assume the error is thrown by the Linker.</p></li>
<li><p>It may also be a manner of importing/creating/using libraries too, since I just started with that topic.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways searching the Internet about it usually just results in the hint, to use the same compiler for both projects - which shouldn't matter in my case (since I'm building both projects with the same Creator and the same settings).</p>

<p>Has anybody an idea? </p>

<p>Thanks for your support</p>

<p>the code for setting the region to be displayed is below.  however, the first time the user taps an item on the list, the mapView shows half the world, centered apparently on 0,0.  the annotation that is placed (code not shown) is in the appropriate place, but the center and scale are all wrong.  if the user returns to the master list and taps the item again (or taps any other item), the map is properly centered and sized, and the code works v.  i cannot determine why the mapView is not responding the setRegion call properly the first time.</p>

<p>the code below is in the viewWillAppear method of the detail controller, but the effect is the same if it is put in viewDidLoad, or even in the prepareForSegue method of the master view controller.  </p>

<p>i also tried changing the initial declaration of region to different coordinates, thinking that might be the problem, but it isn't...the behavior is the same no matter what values i use when initializing region, or even if i don't set it's initial values.</p>

<p>another SO user has asked the same question (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13017461/cannot-get-uimapview-to-zoom-setregion-when-the-map-is-loaded-for-the-first-t"">Cannot get UIMapView to &quot;zoom&quot;/setRegion: when the map is loaded for the first time</a>) but none of the answers solve the problem.</p>

<p>fwiw, the detail view controller is declared to be an MKMapView delegate, and is assigned as the mapView's delegate, but i have not implemented any of the delegate methods (it is also an MKAnnotation delegate and i have implemented mapView:viewForAnnotation)</p>

<p>any guidance about where i need to put this code, or what kind of delegate method i need to implement, so that it will cause the appropriate centering and scale the first time the mapView appears would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>here's the code:   </p>

<pre><code> CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinates = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake([self.listing.latitude doubleValue], [self.listing.longitude doubleValue]);
MKPointAnnotation *selectedListingAnnotation=[[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];
selectedListingAnnotation.coordinate=coordinates;

MKCoordinateRegion region = { {0.0, 0.0 }, { 0.0, 0.0 } };
region.center = coordinates;
region.span.longitudeDelta = 0.02f;
region.span.latitudeDelta  = 0.02f;
[self.mapView setRegion:region animated:YES];
if (selectedListingAnnotation) {
    [self.mapView addAnnotation:selectedListingAnnotation];

Communication is based on a simple, custom, line-based protocol.  This server allows clients to connect, seek for other players in game matches, play said games (send moves, chat messages, etc.), and be notified when the game has ended.</p>

<p>What I'm looking to do now is test the server by simulating client connections.  I'm hoping to support 10s of thousands of simultaneous connections, so this testing is very important to me. What do you guys use for your own testing?  </p>

<p>Some things I'm researching now are: pexpect (python expect lib for the functional testing) and tsung for load testing.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to just test from my laptop since I do not have a cluster of client machines to connect from.  Perhaps I'd need to use ip aliasing or some-such in order to generate 100s of thousands of outbound sockets (limit is 65K per interface AFAIK).</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems to me like I need something fairly custom but I thought I'd ask before I went down that path.</p>

<li>self-hosting, since HTTP live streaming isn't rocket science anymore (think <a href=""http://www.real.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""real networks"">real networks</a> streaming services a few years ago)</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Vimeo (they got their own iOS app, so they have to do some streaming for themselves, perhaps sniffing the network traffic can lighten things up)</li>

<p>EDIT: The platform doesn't really matter since this is for a web application therefore the backend doesn't matter much. However, Rails and Java are possibilities. </p>

<p>Also, WoW was just an example, I'm just interested in such a technology; a large game would be a good application for it. </p>

<p>This is basically what I need to search for one of the fields (allowed):
This Field Basically stores some series of keywords that specify some access.
It could look like:</p>

<ol>
<li>-PPartners:ALL</li>
<li><p>-PLevel:ALL</p></li>
<li><p>-PRegion:ASIA, EUROPE, AMERICAS</p></li>
<li>-PAffiliate:GOOGLE</li>
</ol>

<p>So basically for each item to search I need pass these values and see if the result either allow access for those or is non secured for each category</p>

<p>I tried using the following syntax in the query parser but that did not work. </p>

<p>allowed:((""PPartners:ALL "" OR  ""PPartners:OEM"") AND (“PLevel:ALL"" OR ""PLevel:Executive"") AND (""PAffiliate:ALL"" OR ""PAffiliate:XCompany"") AND (“PRegion:ALL"" OR ""PRegion:North America""))  </p>

<p>I ended up with zero results, would you advice the best way to perform this search?

I have a new app that is nearly ready for its initial release and I am just working on the In App Purchase section. I have used IAP in a previous app so I thought the move over should be straight forward. The problem is however that whenever I run SKProductsRequest it returns an empty results set.</p>

<p>I am using the following to make the request</p>

<pre><code>productIdentifierList = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

[productIdentifierList addObject:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""xxxxxxxxxx""]];

SKProductsRequest *request = [[SKProductsRequest alloc] initWithProductIdentifiers:[NSSet setWithArray:productIdentifierList]];
</code></pre>

<p>And the response goes to </p>

<pre><code>-(void)productsRequest:(SKProductsRequest *)request didReceiveResponse:(SKProductsResponse *)response {
NSLog(@""Recieved Product Response %@"",response.products);
[productDetailsList addObjectsFromArray: response.products];
[productDisplayTableView reloadData];
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>I just don't seem to be getting any results returned. I have checked the ids and they seem ok, I have also run from my IPhone device via XCode and still had no luck. The response in the debugger doesn't give a lot away as well.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest some fixes for this issue?</p>

<p>The algorithm that I would like to prove is Binary search for a sorted array, which has a complexity of log2(n)</p>

<p>The algorithm says: if the target value are searching for is equal to the mid element, then return its index. If if it's less, then search on the left sub-array, if greater search on the right sub-array.</p>

<p>As you can see each time N(t): [number of nodes at time t] is being divided by half. Therefore, we can say that it takes O(log2(n)) to find an element.</p>

<p>Now using differential equation growth and decay method.</p>

<pre><code>dN(t)/dt = N(t)/2 
</code></pre>

<p>dN(t): How fast the number of elements is increasing or decreasing<br>
dt: With respect to time<br>
N(t): Number of elements at time t<br></p>

<p>The above equation says that the number of cells is being divided by 2 with time.</p>

<p>Solving the above equations gives us:</p>

<pre><code>dN(t)/N(t) = dt/2
ln(N(t)) = t/2 + c
t = ln(N(t))*2 + d
</code></pre>

<p>Even though we got t = ln(N(t)) and not log2(N(t)), we can still say that it's logarithmic.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the above method, even if it makes sense while approaching it to finding binary search complexity, turns out it does not work for all algorithms. Here's a counter example:</p>

<p>Searching an array linearly: O(n)</p>

<pre><code>dN(t)/dt = N(t)
dN(t)/N(t) = dt
t = ln(N(t)) + d
</code></pre>

<p>So according to this method, the complexity of searching linearly takes O(ln(n)) which is NOT true of course.</p>

<p>This differential equation method is called growth and decay and it's very popluar. So I would like to know if this method could be applied in computer science algorithm like the one I picked, and if yes, what did I do wrong to get incorrect result for the linear search ? Thank you</p>

"29698580","1","","","2015-04-17 11:59:30","","3","88","<p>In swift you can make an optional call to a method that that may or may not be implemented in conformance to a protocol:</p>

<pre><code>@objc protocol F {
    optional func f(#p1: String, p2: String) -&gt; String
}

@objc class C: F {
    func f(#p1: String, p2: String) -&gt; String { return ""0 \(p1) \(p2)"" }
}

let c: F = C()

c.f?(p1: ""1"", p2: ""2"") // --&gt; ""0 1 2""
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can also optionally bind the method to a local constant:</p>

<pre><code>if let f = c.f {
    f(p1: ""1"", p2: ""2"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an elegant way to wrap some code that should only happen if the method is implemented, not just the call itself. Notice, however, that unlike the <code>respondsToSelector:</code> of the <code>NSObjectProtocol</code>, optional binding does not check for the named parameters. So, if you have two methods that only differ in the parameter names, you get <code>Ambiguous use of 'f'</code> compile time error:</p>

<pre><code>@objc protocol F {
    optional func f(#p1: String, p2: String) -&gt; String
    optional func f(#x: String, y: String) -&gt; String
}

@objc class C: F {
    func f(#p1: String, p2: String) -&gt; String { return ""0 \(p1) \(p2)"" }
    func f(#x: String, y: String) -&gt; String { return ""0 \(x) \(y)"" }
}

let c: F = C()

c.f?(p1: ""1"", p2: ""2"") // --&gt; ""0 1 2""
c.f?(x: ""1"", y: ""2"") // --&gt; ""0 1 2""

if let f = c.f { // Ambiguous use of 'f'
    f(p1: ""1"", p2: ""2"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>This then is an issue of Swift - Obj C interoperability. Or have I missed something and there is in fact some Swift syntax available that would disambiguate between the two methods? Or should I quit designing code that makes use of optional methods and simply have multiple protocols to cater for diversity of needs (which may in turn cram type definitions with a lot of protocol names)? </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>My initial thinking was along the lines of <code>Sulthan</code>'s answer below. However, I am now beginning to lean more towards his original comment: ""This seems to be an omission in the grammar. I would report it."" The reason for this has to do with the analogue case of referencing instance methods as curried functions of the type:</p>

<pre><code>class C {
    func f() -&gt; String { return ""I'm a C"" }
}

let c = C()
c.f() //--&gt; ""I'm a C""

let f = C.f(c)
f() //--&gt; ""I'm a C""
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice and <a href=""http://oleb.net/blog/2014/07/swift-instance-methods-curried-functions/"" rel=""nofollow"">people are already making good use of this</a> fundamental feature of Swift.</p>

<p>Of course you can do the same with named parameters:</p>

<pre><code>class D {
    func g(#x: Int) -&gt; String { return ""Gave me \(x)"" }
    func g(#y: Int) -&gt; String { return ""Give me \(y)"" }
}

let d = D()
d.g(x: 5) //--&gt; ""Gave me 5""
d.g(y: 15) //--&gt; ""Gave me 15""

D.g(d)(x: 5) //--&gt; ""Gave me 5""
</code></pre>

<p>Only again, as with optional methods above, I do not know how to disambiguate between 'f' and 'g' without the immediate call:</p>

<pre><code>let g = D.g(d) // Ambiguous use of 'g'
g(x: 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that type annotation would help (given the types were declared as differen, of course):</p>

<pre><code>class D {
    func g(#x: Int) -&gt; String { return ""Gave me \(x)"" }
    func g(#y: Double) -&gt; String { return ""Give me \(y)"" }
}

let d = D()
let g: (x: Int) -&gt; String = D.g(d)
g(x: 5) //--&gt; ""Gave me 5""
</code></pre>

<p>However, the compiler ignores the parameter name in <code>(x: Int)</code> and the reference would still be ambiguous if both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> were an <code>Int</code>...</p>

<p>Similarly: </p>

<pre><code>let p = (x: 0, y: 1)
p is (a: Int, b: Int) //--&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>even though:</p>

<pre><code>let q: (a: Int, b: Int) = (x: 0, y: 1) //--&gt; Error: '(x: Int, y: Int)' is not convertible to '(a: Int, b: Int)`

xsheet = xbook.add_worksheet('Test')
xsheet.write(0,0,a)

I'm using the all time classic HTML + JS + CSS combo and Yii (PHP) as a backend with a MySQL database. I can't really tell what the site is about but the user will definitely interact with the backend and run some queries on the DB and stuff.</p>

<p>Right now my website is composed of 5 HTML files, each one of them has a common layout:</p>

<ul>
<li>Header or menu with logo and user info</li>
<li>""Sub-Header"" with a general info image and maybe some specific stuff</li>
<li>Content specific to that HTML file</li>
<li>Footer</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now I find kinda annoying that each time I redirect the user to a different place of my site I have to check again if he's logged in, I make some use of cookies for that too, etc, etc.</p>

<p>I was thinking of moving my site to be a single page or template if you will and just append the (body)content of each of those files to the body of my master-page. That sounds pretty good at first thought, but are there any downsides to this or is this just how things should be done? </p>

<p>I've done web applications before using frameworks like Sencha and stuff and they all seem to work this way, but is this the way to go for this particular case?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Also, what is the correct way to implement the single-page scenario? </p>

<ul>
<li>Get all the code in one HTML file and hide the stuff I don't want to show</li>
<li>Remove from the view the stuff I want to hide and append the new stuff from some other HTML file.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've got it all working expect for one bit - highlighting the current day.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that when the datepicker first loads the current day is displayed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td class=""ui-datepicker-days-cell-over  ui-datepicker-today""&gt;
    &lt;a class=""ui-state-default ui-state-highlight ui-state-hover"" href=""#""&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the user hovers over any other day, the <code>ui-state-hover</code> on the current day is removed, and then the current day highlighting works ok:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td class=""ui-datepicker-days-cell-over  ui-datepicker-today""&gt;
    &lt;a class=""ui-state-default ui-state-highlight"" href=""#""&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My CSS for the hover state is like:</p>

<p><code>.ui-widget-content .ui-state-hover { ... }</code></p>

<p>and on-load this is overwriting my <code>ui-state-highlight</code> which highlights the current day.</p>

<p>I've tried to do:</p>

<p><code>.ui-widget-content .ui-state-highlight .ui-state-hover  { ... }</code></p>

<p>Which I thought would preferentially match as it's a more specific selector, but it's not working.</p>

<p>So the question is, how can I make <code>.ui-state-highlight .ui-state-hover</code> override <code>.ui-state-hover</code> so I don't lose my highlight on hover?</p>

<p>I have a process which does FTP and another process which Emails.</p>

<p>While I am done with FTP I want to email a success notification.
So the email process is watching for a new file pr configuration file to come in to a particular directory</p>

<p>The FTP process creates a file appropriate for the email process which is more or less list of emails in a property file.</p>

<p>The problem I am facing is while I create the file and write it. The email process which detects a new file and reads it before or while the file is being written. Therefore it accesses only null parameters. While I can put a sleep on top of Email process it would not work for all cases and it will hinder for other people who have finished files.</p>

<p>What can I use to
-create a property file which cannot be read untill it is completely written
-or create a property file with a lock which can be unlocked from another process if need be.</p>

<p>What are my choices?</p>

<p>As far as now:
- I have tried using apache commons configuration to setProperty it created the same old read/write access problem
- I created a property =new property and used store method to create the file. Even then the Email process would read before it is completely </p>

<p>FYI: Email Process had WatchDirectory and reads whenever a new file is created.</p>

<p>I'm working with the new full text search service in gae 1.6.6 and I'm having trouble figuring out how to correctly escape my query strings before I pass them off to the search index. The docs mention that certain characters need to be escaped (namely the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/search/overview#Numeric_Operators"">numeric operators</a>), however they don't specify <em>how</em> the query parser expects the string to be escaped.</p>

<p>The issue I'm having is two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Failing to escape the crap out of many characters (more than those that are hinted at in the docs) will cause the parser to raise a <code>QueryException</code>.</li>
<li>When I've escaped the query to the point it won't raise, the numeric operators (>, &lt;, >=, &lt;=) no longer parse correctly (not factored into the search).</li>
</ol>

<p>I setup a test where I feed <code>string.printable</code> into <code>my_index.search()</code> and found that it would raise <code>QueryException</code> on each of the ""printable"" control characters, which I'm now stripping out, as well as things that would seem innocent like asterisk, comma, parenthesis, braces, tilde. None of these are mentioned in the docs as needing to be escaped.</p>

<p>So far I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>cgi.escape()</code></li>
<li><code>saxutils.escape()</code> with a mapping of ascii to urlencoded equivalents (eg <code>,</code> -> <code>%2C</code>)</li>
<li><code>saxutils.escape()</code> with a mapping of ascii to html entity encoded ascii codes (eg <code>&amp;#123;</code>)</li>
<li><code>urllib.quote_plus()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I've gotten the best results so far using url-style(<code>%NN</code>) replacements, but >, &lt;, >=, and &lt;= continue to fail to yield the expected results from the index. 
Also, and this doesn't really seem to have anything to do with the escaping issue, but using <code>NOT</code> in front of a <code>field = value</code> type query seems to not be working as advertised either.</p>

<h3>tl;dr</h3>

<p>How should I be escaping my queries before sending them to the search service so that the parser doesn't raise <code>QueryException</code> <em>and</em> my query yields expected results?</p>

<p>Solving this problem was two fold.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since we want a telnet client, we need to ensure that the protocol is an instance of <code>TelnetProtocol</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The factory must be of <code>ClientFactory</code>.  If we look at the source of <code>twisted.internet.endoints</code>, we see that the factory we pass in to the endpoints is wrapped in <code>_WrappingFactory</code>, which is descended from <code>ClientFactory</code>. If this factory we pass in does not have the same attributes as <code>ClientFactory</code>, then the <code>_wrappedFactory</code> will cause AttributeErrors when it attempts to call methods of ClientFactory</p></li>

 &lt;div id=""optionholder""&gt;&lt;img src=""../img/pricemodules/dvd.jpg"" alt=""dvd"" name=""dvd"" width=""199"" height=""85"" class=""hoverswap"" id=""dvd"" /&gt;&lt;img src=""../img/pricemodules/cd.jpg""   alt=""compact disc"" name=""cd"" width=""212"" height=""85"" class=""hoverswap"" id=""cd"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changing this option &lt;br/&gt;will reset the packaging options&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;form action=""sess-set-reset.php"" method=""get"" id=""firstform"" &gt;
&lt;input name=""frmmedia"" type=""hidden""  id=""frmmedia"" value="""" /&gt;
    &lt;div id=""next""&gt;&lt;input type=""image"" name=""Submit"" value=""Next"" src=""../img/page-elements/confirm.jpg""/&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code that opens the above PHP page is this (which DOES work on iPhone)</p>

<pre><code>//----media elements-----------------------------------------------------
jQuery(function (jQuery) {
jQuery('.media').click(function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    jQuery('#contentholder').load(""media.php"");
    jQuery(""#contentholder"").modal({
        onOpen: function (dialog) {
            dialog.overlay.fadeIn('fast', function () {
                dialog.data.hide();
                dialog.container.fadeIn('fast', function () {
                    dialog.data.slideDown('fast');
                });
            });
        }
    });
})
})
</code></pre>

<p>The actual page is the 'pricing' page here:

<p>The use case is that upon successful authentication with a webservice, it gives me two cookies that I need to pass along with every single request. These cookies never expire, or expire years from now.  As long as I have the cookies with each HTTPS request, the user doesn't have to login again.  I understand that AFNetworking automatically persists cookies until you quit the app, but I need the cookies to last forever until the user deletes the app from their phone.</p>

<p>1) Upon successful authentication, the webservice hands me two cookies.  How do I access them? Do I go straight to NSHTTPCookie storage and grab the cookie by its name, or is there an AFNetworking ""way"" to do this?  </p>

<p>2) How do I save these two magic cookies permanently so that my subclass of AFHTTPClient passes these two magic cookies along  with each request?  Do I just save them inside a keychain or NSUserDefaults or NSURLCredentialsStorage?  Or again is there an AFNetworking way to do this?  I read about a setAuthorization() method inside AFNetworking but I'm not sure if this applies to username/password and cookies as well.</p>

<p>3) How do I delete these cookies the AFNetworking way?</p>

<p>I have a list called <code>a = [2, 3, 4, 1]</code></p>

<p>I have some function say func(), which is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def func(a):
    o = []
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n):
        x=a[:]
        x[i],x[(i+1)%n] = x[(i+1)%n],x[i]
        o.append(x)
    return o
</code></pre>

<p>and func(a) produces another list as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[[3, 2, 4, 1], [2, 4, 3, 1], [2, 3, 1, 4], [1, 3, 4, 2]]
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to map the output list to the list from which it is generated. So, how to generate a dictionary in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>a            : o

key          : value1, value2........last value

[2, 3, 4, 1] : [3, 2, 4, 1], [2, 4, 3, 1], [2, 3, 1, 4], [1, 3, 4, 2]

<p>Once this is solved I will rebuild the mysql++ library using my toolchain for powerpc. Has anyone tried this ? To build mysql++ library I need mysqlclient, in the earlier example I would install it by executing the command <strong><em>apt-get</em></strong>, but the libraries would be compiled using a gnu compiler ? How to cross compile mysqlclient for powerpc ? I guess I need to do the below</p>

<ol>
<li>Build mysqlclient for powerpc.</li>
<li>Use those libraries and build mysql++ libraries for powerpc.</li>
<li>Use mysql++ and mysqlclient libraries in my application and compile for powerpc.</li>

     jQuery.post(url, jQuery('#' + formId).serialize(), function(d) {
        jQuery('html,body').animate({scrollTop: jQuery(""#scrollhere"").offset().top},'slow');
        jQuery(""#response"").html('&lt;center&gt;&lt;p style=""height:820px""&gt;&lt;span style=""color:black;font-weight:bold;font: 11px arial,verdana,sans-serif;""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loading available payment getaways..&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=""&lt;?php echo get_bloginfo('wpurl').'/wp-content/plugins/'.basename(dirname(__FILE__)).'/images/co/8-1.gif'; ?&gt;"" width=""220"" height=""19"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;');

        jQuery(""#response"").attr(""style"",""height:1030px"");
    });
}

</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that, the validation is working.. however, <code>.post()</code> function runs even though there is empty field. I guess its on the if/else condition.. is there a better way to accomplish this?</p>

<p>Since the notifications are stored in db, new notifications are displayed only when a page refresh is done. I would like to make it real time using some push server using something like long polling technique. </p>

<p>I have come across <code>NowJS</code> which seems to be pretty handy for this, but in all the examples that are given I could not see any example where there was any interaction with the database. In all the cases there was some information sent by one client and it was displayed to one or more clients.</p>

<p>What I actually want to do is to call a function using NowJS, and make it go to sleep until a new notification is added in the database. When a new notifications comes in the server responds back with the notification and a new request is done immediately.</p>

<p>Some (a very few as a percentage) users complain that one of their computers (for example ""it only happens at home"") appears to have its SYN packets ignored. They can ping without loss. <em>sometimes</em> they get some responses to tcp requests. They can get responses on quiet ports for example the pop server. Generally however they experience long time outs. I have packet dumps from them that show this.</p>

<p>On my end, I can also see that <em>some</em> IP addresses are being ignored.</p>

<p>Here for example, multiple SYN packets from port 2010 to port 80 are not replied, while the server is fulfilling a prior connection on port 2031</p>

<p>I wrote a perl script to watch a tcpdump and find / report the number of dangling SYNs, it finds a few every few seconds (as we go along the accumulated count of never-replied TCP SYN packets rises steadily). The rate of apparently unreplied SYNs is about 1 in 2500. When I ping those IPs, assuming they are pingable, there is no packet loss, no issue communicating with them.</p>

<p>Nothing useful (such as ""sending syncookies"") is in the kernel log.</p>

<p>nginx has </p>

<pre><code>worker_processes 8
worker_connections 4096
</code></pre>

<p>keepalive is on, open_file_cache module is in use, but I'm struggling to see what other variables could silently ignore SYN packets but only and repeatably for specific IPs.</p>

<p>beyond the default ubuntu setup, sysctl.conf has</p>

<pre><code># increased
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535

# reduced

net.ipv4.tcp_ecn = 0
</code></pre>

<p>I've not experience this problem before, with the same audience, an earlier kernel nginx, different hardware (this is a virtual server). Different data center.</p>

<p>My ""canary in a coal mine"" reports that from their perspective they see the timeouts and lack of replies on their XP machine, but not if it goes via a linux machine setup as a proxy. So they are investigating that. However whatever their conclusion I'm not sure why I can sniff incoming SYN packets to port 80 with no subsequent reply packet sent out on the same interface.</p>

<p>But I can't understand why people use this way for getting messages (where the main source this decision because I can't even find this type of solution in Spring Pro Integration and <a href=""http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/4.0.0.RELEASE/reference/html/mail.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Spring documentation</a> )</p>

<p>Please, can anyone explain me 
1)in which case I should use ImapIdleChannelAdapter and when just Session for getting store and connecting to mailbox.
2)Why do I get the exception 'NO STORE attempt on READ-ONLY folder' now</p>

<pre><code>        h = {}
        v = 0

        ('A'..'Z').each do |c|
        v+=1
         h[c] = v
        end 

        puts ""Provide Input:""
        input = gets
        input.downcase!


        if input.include?(""a"") 
            n = h[""A""] + rand(26)
            puts h.index(n) 

        if input.include?(""b"")
            n = h[""B""] + rand(26)
            puts h.index(n) 

        if input.include?(""c"")
            n = h[""C""] + rand(26)
            puts h.index(n)  

        etc, etc... (All the way to the end of the alphabet)
           end
           end
       end

How do we define confidence in machine learning and how to generate it (if not generated automatically by scikit-learn)? What should I change in this approach if I had more that 2 potential classes?</p>

<p>This is what I have done so far:</p>

<pre><code># load libraries

# initialize NearestNeighbor classifier
knn = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
# train model
knn.fit([[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]], [0,0,0,1,1,1])

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Let's assume that we have created a model using the XYZ machine learning algorithm. Let's also assume that we are trying to classify users based on their gender using information such as location, hobbies, and income. Then, we have 10 say new instances that we want to classify. As normal, upon the applying of the model, we get 10 outputs, either M (for male) or F (for female). So far so good. However, I would like to somehow measure the precision of these results and then, by using a hard-coded threshold, leave out those with low precision. My question is on how to measure the precession. Is probability (as given by the predict_proba() function) a good measure? For example, can I say that if probably is between 0.9 and 1 then ""keep"" (otherwise ""omit"")? Or I should use a more sophisticated method for doing that? As you can see, I lack theoretical background so any help would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Is there a way to reach 'view' without declaring a function in the loop? I'm trying to make my code JSLint compliant, and I can't figure out if there's a solution to this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>This probably most likely due to the fact that this each function is in a loop itself:</p>

<p>Right now I am doing this:</p>

<pre><code> var that = this,
     otherParameter = array[i],
     i;

 for (i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {


    container.children.each(function(view){
         that.backboneFunction(view, otherParameter);

 };

<p>I've verified that the database is created correctly in the Application, and the Tables are populated with data by exporting a copy of the app local database to the SD card for viewing in a SQL browser -- so the data not being present is not the issue here.</p>

<p>The odd behavior is probably better visualized through a couple of screen shots of my debugging process:</p>

<p>So, initially when I did my queries, all of my <code>Cursor</code> objects were returning -1 for the row count, even though I verified that a <code>SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME</code> statement should return values, since the database I pulled off of the device contains row data. Here's a look at the debugger step:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/t0PL1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice that when the cursor is initially returned, mCount displays as -1.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I added the cursor.moveToFirst(); call, and here's a screenshot from after that step:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/h2AEm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice that the cursor count changed from -1 to 3, which corresponds to the correct number of rows (since the application only accounts for 3 continents atm).  Unfortunately, this added line that should be unnecessary still doesn't fix my problem, since CursorAdapter.bindView() and CursorAdapter.newView() still fail to be called with the resulting cursor.</p>

<p>I'm confused as to what could be causing this issue, and how to fix it?  If anyone could give any insight into what the problem could be, please let me know.  Also, if any additional code is needed, such as the SQL create statements, etc let me know - however, as I've already mentioned the database is created fine and queries performed on the exported db copy outside of the Android application work just fine...</p>

<p>One last thing, the application is built for API levels 14+.</p>

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA function_schema FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA function_schema FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA function_schema FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA function_schema FROM PUBLIC;

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA table_schema FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA table_schema FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA table_schema FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA table_schema FROM PUBLIC;
</code></pre>

<p>Setup restricted access for test user:</p>

<pre><code>GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE test_db TO test_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA function_schema TO test_user;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM test_user;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA table_schema FROM test_user;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION function_schema.function1() TO test_user;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION function_schema.function2(integer) TO test_user;
</code></pre>

<p>Now to hid the schema structure and code form the test users and public:</p>

<pre><code>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE pg_proc FROM public;
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE pg_proc FROM test_user;
</code></pre>

<p>This all works well, the test user can execute the functions but they can't see the code inside the functions, nor can they see the schema and table structure.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>I'd like to allow the test user to now see the functions by name in the test_functions schema.I've tried the following according to <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-grant.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GRANT Postgresql 9.3</a> (this is granting select on every column in pg_proc):</p>

<pre><code>GRANT SELECT (proname,pronamespace,proowner,prolang,procost,prorows,
provariadic,protransform,proisagg,proiswindow,prosecdef,proleakproof,
proisstrict,proretset,provolatile,pronargs,pronargdefaults,prorettype,
proargtypes,proallargtypes,proargmodes,proargnames,proargdefaults,prosrc,
probin,proconfig,proacl) ON TABLE pg_proc TO test_user;
</code></pre>

<p>The result here is that the test user does not get all the same select permissions as if they had access to the whole table. They still can't see the function names.</p>

<p>Another test was to do the reverse, grant select to the table then revoke select on all columns accouding to <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-revoke.html"" rel=""nofollow"">REVOKE postgresql 9.3</a>:</p>

<pre><code>GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_proc TO test_user;

REVOKE SELECT (proname,pronamespace,proowner,prolang,procost,prorows,
provariadic,protransform,proisagg,proiswindow,prosecdef,proleakproof,
proisstrict,proretset,provolatile,pronargs,pronargdefaults,prorettype,
proargtypes,proallargtypes,proargmodes,proargnames,proargdefaults,prosrc,
probin,proconfig,proacl) ON TABLE pg_proc FROM test_user;
</code></pre>

<p>Again this doesn't work, they now can see all schemas, code and tables (on allowed schemas).</p>

<p>It appears that the grant/revoke on specific columns doesn't work the way the documentation suggests.</p>

<p>Searching extensively yielded <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3651720/postgresql-how-can-i-restrict-access-to-code-in-a-function-for-a-user"">How to restrict access to code in a function</a> wich suggests revoking access to only the pg_proc.prosrc column which clearly doesn't work from the tests above.</p>

<p>I'm using postgresql 9.3</p>

<p>Please feel free to suggest any other solution that comes to mind.</p>

<p>First of all i run some tests and few operations on <code>1024x1024x3</code> matrix took 32ms in C# and 4ms in C++ and that's what i basicly need.</p>

<p>Interpolation however is not a good word because i need them only for downscaling. But the question is: Will it be faster than C# methods in Drawing2D</p>

<pre><code>Image outputImage = new Bitmap(destWidth, destHeight, PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb);
Graphics grPhoto = Graphics.FromImage(outputImage);

grPhoto.InterpolationMode = InterpolationMode.*; //all of them

grPhoto.DrawImage(bmp, new Rectangle(0, 0, destWidth, destHeight),
Rectangle(0, 0, sourceWidth, sourceHeight), GraphicsUnit.Pixel);

grPhoto.Dispose();
</code></pre>

<p>Some of these method run in 20ms and some in 80. Is there a way to do it faster?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 1:</p>

<p>First of all i'm using XNA in this application but there seems to be no way to select different interpolation method. Of course it's working very fast.</p>

<p>Ideal way would be to implement those methods on graphic card. </p>

<p><strong>My Goal: I'm trying to query the Jobs table to find all of a users jobs and query the Bids table to get all of the jobs that a user is bidding on. Then I would like to sort the jobs and bids based on their timestamps and return job IDs</strong></p>

<p>The tables are setup as follows:</p>

<pre><code>| USERS    | JOBS    | BIDS
| id       | id      | id
| username | user_id | user_id
| password | title   | job_id
|          |         | bid_amount
</code></pre>

<p>The relationships between the tables are as follows:</p>

<p>Jobs:</p>

<pre><code>public function bids()
{
    return $this-&gt;hasMany('App\RocketCandy\Repos\Bids\Bid');
}

public function user()
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo('App\RocketCandy\Repos\Users\User');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Users:</p>

<pre><code>public function jobs()
{
    return $this-&gt;hasMany('App\RocketCandy\Repos\Jobs\Job');
}

public function bids()
{
    return $this-&gt;hasMany('App\RocketCandy\Repos\Bids\Bid');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Bids:</p>

<pre><code>public function jobs()
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo('App\RocketCandy\Repos\Jobs\Job');
}

public function users()
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo('App\RocketCandy\Repos\Users\User');
}
</code></pre>

<p>The following code I've developed returns the jobs and the bids but it's not clever enough to sort the IDs based on the updated_at timestamp.</p>

<pre><code>public function getUsersJobs($userId)
{
    // Get the jobs that the user posted
    $postedJobs = Job::where('user_id', $userId)
                       -&gt;lists('id')
                       -&gt;toArray();

    // Get the jobs that the user is bidding on
    $biddedJobs = Job::with('bids')
                       -&gt;whereHas('bids', function ($q) use ($userId) {
                           $q-&gt;where('user_id', $userId);
                       })-&gt;lists('id')
                         -&gt;toArray();

    $jobIds = array_merge($postedJobs, $biddedJobs);

    // Return the jobs that a user has posted and is bidding on
    return Job::whereIn('id', $jobIds)
                       -&gt;OrderBy('updated_at', 'DESC')
                       -&gt;get();

"29299378","1","","","2015-03-27 11:13:11","","0","27","<p>Here is what I am trying to do: I have a swing gui with two JFrames. The first has a JCheckBox and the second displays some text. Also the second has a javax.swing.Timer that is waiting for the checkbox in the first frame to be clicked. Once it is clicked, some more text is to be displayed. It works if I have only one condition (click the checkbox) and the condition is directly in the if-statement, like this:</p>

<pre><code>javax.swing.Timer timer = new javax.swing.Timer(100, new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        if ( otherGUI.jCheckBox.isSelected() ){
            //add some text to second JFrame
            timer.stop();
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now for the twist: This should happen not only once, but multiple times. There is an ArrayList of timers, each with its own text and condition, one starting after the other. My problem is: If I store the conditions as strings in an ArrayList, they seem to be evaluated once at the start of the programme, so the condition from above stays false, even when I click the checkbox. Here is my actual code:</p>

<pre><code>    SomeGUI gui = new SomeGUI();

    ArrayList&lt;javax.swing.Timer&gt; timer = new ArrayList&lt;javax.swing.Timer&gt;();
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; text = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; cond = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

    text.add(""some text"");
    cond.add(""gui.jCheckBox.isSelected()"");

    text.add(""some more text"");
    cond.add(new Condition(""true""));

    //etc.

    for ( int i = 0; i &lt; text.size() - 1; i++  ){
        int j = i;//not sure why this trick is necessary. i doesn't work later on
        timer.add( new javax.swing.Timer(100, new ActionListener() {
            @Override
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                boolean bool = false;
                try{
                    bool = Boolean.parseBoolean( cond.get(j) );
                }
                catch(Exception ex){}
                if ( bool ){
                    addText(p, text.get(j+1));
                    timer.get(j).stop();
                    timer.get(j+1).start();
                }
            }
        }));
    }
    timer.get(0).start();
</code></pre>

<p>I already tried an <code>ArrayList&lt;Boolean&gt;</code> for the conditions to the same effect. The code above just represents my present state of trial and error.
I hope that I could make clear what I am trying to achieve. So how can I store boolean expressions in a list/array and have them evaluated in an if-statement again and again at runtime and not only once when the programme is started?</p>

<p>Now I pipe these values to ""mv -n $1 ~/Movies"" this I am hoping would move the files to the Movies folder. </p>

<p>I have a few Problems. 
 1. The ""ls -R"" does not list the path when listing the files. So I think I may fail to move the file. 
 2. I can not seem to get the file name to assign to the $1 in the mv command. </p>

<p>All together my command looks like this: Note I am running this from ~/Pictures </p>

<pre><code>ls -R | grep -i "".avi"" | mv -n $1 ~/Movies 
</code></pre>

<p>So right now I am not sure which part is failing but I do get this error:</p>

<pre><code>usage: mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
   mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory

<p>If I remove the 'mv' command I get a listing of avi files with out the path. Example Below:</p>

<pre><code>4883.AVI
4884.AVI
4885.AVI
4886.AVI
4887.AVI

<p>Any one have any ideas on how I can get the path in the 'ls' or how to pass a value in between the '|' commands. </p>

<p>It works fine for queries like this with one word: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tqurn.png"" alt=""Search Example 1""> </p>

<p>Or for queries with part of a word: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tu72P.png"" alt=""search example 2""></p>

<p>Or for queries with two words or parts of words where they occur together in the results being searched: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PXhTy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But if I search for two words that do not occur next to each other the query fails: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6yotP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How would I modify my query so that I can search for any number of keywords that appear at any location in my results?</p>

<p>For example if my db has a record such as: <code>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</code></p>

<p>I want a result to be returned if I search for: <code>quick jumps dog</code> or <code>dog over</code> not just <code>quick brown</code> or <code>fox jumps</code> or <code>fox</code> and so on.</p>

<p>I was thinking something along the lines of exploding my query if it has more than one word in it and then making my <code>$search_string</code> into an array of keywords for <code>MySQL</code> to query but I don't know if that is the best way to go about it.</p>

<p>Query: </p>

<pre><code>// Get Search
$search_string = preg_replace(""/[^A-Za-z0-9]+[.]/"", "" "", $_POST['query']);
$search_string = $tutorial_db-&gt;real_escape_string($search_string);

// Check Length More Than One Character
if (strlen($search_string) &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; $search_string !== ' ') {

// Build Query
$query = 'SELECT * FROM search WHERE subsection LIKE ""%'.$search_string.'%"" OR def LIKE ""%'.$search_string.'%"" OR exception LIKE ""%'.$search_string.'%"" ORDER BY subsection ASC';

On various sites I have been seeing that the Frame widget can get a different background using <code>Frame.config(background=""color"")</code>.
However, when I use this in my Frames it gives the following error:</p>

<pre><code>_tkinter.TclError: unknown option ""-Background""
</code></pre>

<p>It does not work when doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>frame = Frame(root, background=""white"")
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>frame = Frame(root)
frame.config(bg=""white"")
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure it out.
I would post my whole source code but I dont want it exposed on the internet, but the frame creation goes something like this:</p>

<pre><code>mail1 = Frame(self, relief=SUNKEN)
mail1.pack()
mail1.place(height=70, width=400, x=803, y=109)
mail1.config(Background=""white"")
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried multiple options trying to modify the background. The frame is like a wrap around an email preview for an inbox.</p>

<p>In case it's needed, this the way I am importing my modules:</p>

<pre><code>import tkinter, time, base64, imaplib, smtplib
from imaplib import *
from tkinter import *
from tkinter.ttk import *
</code></pre>

<p>The following is the full traceback:</p>

<p>Now my problem is - I have a dynamic form on client side that is generated on fly (using javascript) based on users options like, if a option is chosen from 1st drop down box, then I load rest of the form and so on. For my first drop down menu I have no issues, because those options are constants. but for my second drop down menu choice I need to load info that is specific and is only available on server, so I thought of making a AJAX call (RESTful call), so I created a Controller like this</p>

<p>my RESTful controller:</p>

<pre><code>@Controller
public class UtilsController {

    private WebAdministration admin;

    public UtilsController() throws WebAdministrationException {
        this.admin = WebAdministration.getInstance();
    }

    @RequestMapping(value=""/aaaa/${site}/${type}"", method=RequestMethod.GET, headers=""Accept=text/xml, application/json"")
    public @ResponseBody List&lt;String&gt; getRemoteSites(@PathVariable(""site"") String site, @PathVariable(""type"") String type) {
        List&lt;String&gt; remoteSites = null;
        Config config = (Config) admin.getImplemantationData().get(Implementations.IMPL);
        if (type.equals(Config.PERSISTENCE)) {
            remoteSites = config.getRemoteSites().get(site).getNewRemoteSites();
        }
        else if (type.equals(Config.OLD)) {
            remoteSites = config.getRemoteSites().get(site).getOldRemoteSites();
        }
        return remoteSites;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>my ajax call:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
function getRemoteSites(site, type) {
    $.getJSON('/aaaa/'+site+'/'+type, {
        ajax : 'true'
    }, function(data) {
        var len = data.length;
        for ( var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
            document.write('&lt;form:checkbox path=""remoteSites"" value=""' + valueArray[i] + '"" /&gt;');
        }
    });
};
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and my Ajax request fails with 404 - no mapping found.</p>

<p>How can I make my REST url work. I know that I need a new view resolver, but I tried so many things and searching for right solution for past 2 days.</p>

<p>any help ?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I don't know if this has already been proposed or asked before; Google searches returned only a myriad number of questions related to the current functionality of <code>Array.push()</code>. </p>

<p>Here's an example implementation of this functionality, feel free to correct it:</p>

<pre><code>;(function() {
    var _push = Array.prototype.push;
    Array.prototype.push = function() {
        return this[_push.apply(this, arguments) - 1];
    }
}());

<p>You would then be able to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var someArray = [],
    value = ""hello world"";

function someFunction(value, obj) {
    obj[""someKey""] = value;
}

someFunction(value, someArray.push({}));
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>someFunction</code> modifies the object passed in as the second parameter, for example. Now the contents of <code>someArray</code> are <code>[{""someKey"": ""hello world""}]</code>.</p>

<p>Are there any drawbacks to this approach?</p>

"7362257","1","","","2011-09-09 13:21:23","","27","19022","<p>I have the following configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 EAR on one GF containing 2 EJB-JARs with EJB components.</li>
<li>1 WAR on another Glassfish server (<i>=> other JVM</i>) containing web components accessing the EJB components.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have 2 EJB business services in each EJB-JAR of my EAR, and they are all developped like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Remote
public interface ServiceAItf {
    ...
}

@Stateless
@Local
public class ServiceAImpl implements ServiceAItf {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my WAR, I access the EJB components via an explicit <b>""InitialContext.lookup""</b> on the remote interface.</p>

<p>In my EAR, I am quite confused about the best practice for injection, in terms of performance, architecture, and so on...</p>

<p>I have the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As you can see, I have declared the annotation <b>""@Local""</b> on the service implementation without defining the local interface. Is it correct? At least I have no error at deployment. But maybe I should use the <b>""@LocalBean""</b> annotation instead? I suppose that the <b>""@LocalBean""</b> annotation simply allows to invoke the implementation directly as a <b>""Local""</b> EJB, but you have to use the implementation in your code like this:</p>

<p>@Stateless
@Local
public class ServiceBImpl implements ServiceBItf {
    @EJB
    private ServiceAImpl serviceA;
    ...
}</p></li>
<li><p><b>What is the best way to inject one EJB into another one?</b>
It works like this:</p>

<p>@Stateless
@Local
public class ServiceBImpl implements ServiceBItf {
    @EJB
    private ServiceAItf serviceA;
    ...
}</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But from what I noticed, the ""serviceA"" injected is the remote proxy, while it is in the same JVM within the same EAR file. So I suppose that there will be an impact on the performance. That's why I have tried to inject the service like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
@Local
public class ServiceBImpl implements ServiceBItf {
    @Inject
    private ServiceAItf serviceA;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't work in GF, I have the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>WELD-001408 Unsatisfied dependencies for type [...] ...
</code></pre>

<p>I then tried to create a local interface, and the injection via the annotation ""@Inject"" works when both services </p>

<p>Even if I create a local interface like this, the service is not injected via the annotation <b>""@Inject""</b> but is null:</p>

<pre><code>@Local
public interface ServiceALocalItf {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I read a lot of articles where it is highly recommended to use <b>""@Inject""</b> instead of <b>""@EJB""</b> when it is for a local invocation. That leads me to the following question: in which case the <b>""@Local""</b> EJB invocation is recommended (or simply used)?</p>

<p>After all this analysis, I come to the following conclusion:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each service, I create a <b>""@Local""</b> and a <b>""@Remote""</b> interface.</li>
<li>From WAR to EJB-JAR of EAR, make a JNDI lookup to the remote interface.</li>
<li>From EJB-JAR to EJB-JAR, make an injection via <b>""@EJB""</b> to the local interface.</li>
<li>For two services within the same EJB-JAR, make an injection via ""@Inject"" to the local interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think about it? Is it correct?</p>

From what I have read these variables and table should be, being returned from the stored procedure. I am at a loss as to how to access them from my C# code.</p>

<p>This is the relevant portion of my stored procedure.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @ReaderName  nvarchar(MAX);
DECLARE @TrainID int;

SELECT @ReaderName = Name, @TrainID = Train_Id FROM Readers WHERE Id=@ReaderID
DECLARE @TrainName nvarchar(MAX);
DECLARE @LineID int;
SELECT @TrainName = Name, @LineID = Line_Id FROM Trains WHERE ID = @TrainID
DECLARE @LineName nvarchar(MAX);
SELECT @LineName = Name FROM Trains WHERE ID = @LineID

DECLARE @EmailList dbo.EmailList;

INSERT INTO @EmailList SELECT Emails.EmailAddress FROM ReaderEmails JOIN Emails ON Emails.Id = ReaderEmails.Email_Id WHERE ReaderEmails.Reader_Id = @ReaderID

SELECT * FROM @EmailList;
SELECT * FROM @StatusList;
</code></pre>

<p>So I need ReaderName, TrainName, LineName, EmailList(table), and @StatusList(table).</p>

<p>databaseAPI is my DbContext</p>

<p>Here is my C# code.</p>

<pre><code>//** get a data table with tags and antennas in it
DataTable dtTags = getDataTableTags(info.TagList.ToList());

//**call stored procedure

SqlParameter sqlParamTags = new SqlParameter(""tagList"", SqlDbType.Structured);
sqlParamTags.Value = dtTags;
sqlParamTags.TypeName = ""TagListType"";

SqlParameter sqlParamMac = new SqlParameter(""@Mac"", reader.MAC);
sqlParamMac.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.NVarChar;

string strTempMac = reader.MAC;
string command = ""EXEC "" + ""SaveMsgData"" + "" @Mac, @tagList;"";

var result = ((System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.IObjectContextAdapter)databaseAPI).ObjectContext.ExecuteStoreCommand(command, sqlParamMac, sqlParamTags);
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried using ExecuteStoreQuery like so</p>

<pre><code>var result = ((System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.IObjectContextAdapter)databaseAPI).ObjectContext.ExecuteStoreQuery(command, sqlParamMac, sqlParamTags);
</code></pre>

<p>but I get the following error</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type arguments for method 'System.Data.Entity.Core.Objects.ObjectContext.ExecuteStoreQuery(string, string, System.Data.Entity.Core.Objects.ExecutionOptions, params object[])' cannot be inferred from the usage. Try specifying the type arguments explicitly.</p>

I have set it up on my development machine (Windows 7) and everything works perfectly. However when I deploy my app to production server (Ubuntu 12.04) I get 404 error for <code>dajaxice.core.js</code> file and cannot resolve this problem no matter what.

<p>I was following the Dajaxice installation steps <a href=""http://django-dajaxice.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and put everything in its place (in <code>settings.py</code>, ˙urls.py<code>and</code>base.html` files).</p>

<p>I did <code>collectstatic</code> on my production server and got all static files collected within few folders in the root of my project. So, now when I look at my deployed web site, I can see that CSS is properly applied, JavaScript is working fine and navigation around the site works as intended. Everything is fine except Ajax is totally broken since <code>dajaxice.core.js</code> is never included.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href=""https://github.com/shahankit/PageViewScrollView"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> to the source code of app where I've used this function. Basically it's a view pager using UIScrollView where views are added and removed as the user so as to keep minimal number of total view in memory. During initialisation of new views containing UILabel with NSAttributedString the above occurs. While scrolling from one view to other new view are created and older are removed from scrollView</p>

<p>If you want to check the progress of a single <code>NSURLSessionTask</code>, it’s as easy as</p>

<p><code>double taskProgress = (double)task.countOfBytesReceived / (double)task.countOfBytesExpectedToReceive;</code></p>

<p>But what is the best way to check <strong>the average progress of all the <code>NSURLSessionTasks</code> in a <code>NSURLSession</code></strong>? </p>

<p>I thought I’d try averaging the progress of all tasks:</p>

<pre><code>[[self backgroundSession] getTasksWithCompletionHandler:^(NSArray *dataTasks, NSArray *uploadTasks, NSArray *allDownloadTasks) {

    double totalProgress = 0.0;

    for (NSURLSessionDownloadTask *task in allDownloadTasks) {

        double taskProgress = (double)task.countOfBytesReceived / (double)task.countOfBytesExpectedToReceive;

        if (task.countOfBytesExpectedToReceive &gt; 0) {
            totalProgress = totalProgress + taskProgress;
        }
        NSLog(@""task %d: %.0f/%.0f - %.2f%%"", task.taskIdentifier, (double)task.countOfBytesReceived, (double)task.countOfBytesExpectedToReceive, taskProgress*100);
    }

    double averageProgress = totalProgress / (double)allDownloadTasks.count;

    NSLog(@""total progress: %.2f, average progress: %f"", totalProgress, averageProgress);
    NSLog(@"" "");

}];
</code></pre>

<p>But the logic here is wrong: Suppose you have 50 tasks expecting to download 1MB and 3 tasks expecting to download 100MB. If the 50 small tasks complete before the 3 large tasks, <code>averageProgress</code> will be much higher than the actual average progress. </p>

<p>So you have to calculate average progress according to the <strong>TOTAL</strong> <code>countOfBytesReceived</code> divided by the <strong>TOTAL</strong> <code>countOfBytesExpectedToReceive</code>. But the problem is that a <code>NSURLSessionTask</code> figures out those values <em>only once it starts</em>, and it might not start until another task finishes. </p>

<p>So how do you check <strong>the average progress of all the <code>NSURLSessionTasks</code> in a <code>NSURLSession</code></strong>? </p>

<p>Workbook1 is Field1, F2, F3 and F4. I wish to query this and display all records, but additionally I wish to have <code>F5=UDF(F3,F4).</code> </p>

<p>I have been advised already that the solution to this is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT UDF(F3,F4) as F5 
FROM \SourceWorkBookLocation\SourceWorkBook
</code></pre>

<p>IN ACCESS:
The problem I am having in access is not at the top of my list right now, relates to data types and trying to determine if a number in a string is &lt;25. But the main problem is in MS Query:</p>

<p>IN EXCEL/MS QUERY:</p>

<p>The function is just not recognized; ""undefined function""
I am not sure how to get it to see the function? My end goal here is to build a front end in excel, and have vba querying appropriately using user input variables passed to the queries. The querying will be done on a separately updated workbook.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to get MS Query to see my UDF and accept what I am doing? Could it be a driver issue? There are a range of excel drivers to choose from.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

I started looking at mod_cache and this does what we want to do.  The one other requirement that I need to meet is that for every request, I need to do some custom logging.  I need the basic request URL and then some other business logic stuff and stuff it into a database.  My questions are these:</p>

<p>I have a program that talks to that driver using ioctl.  It works perfectly when both the driver and the program are either 64bit or 32bit.  But when the driver is 64bit, and my program is 32 bit, the ioctl command received by the driver (in compat_ioctl) does not match the values defined by the _IOR and _IOW macros.</p>

<p>In my driver's switch statement, the default case prints out the values of all the valid commands, which are 1-12.  The 32bit ioctl command is nowhere near those values.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me what would cause the command from a 32bit user program to be messed up when received in a 64bit driver?</p>

<p>Here's some of the code: I had to type it in; the code is on a secured system without internet access, so please forgive any typos.  It actually does comile and run!</p>

<pre><code>// IOCTL commands from the include file - most omitted
// ...
#define PORTIO_GET_IRQ_CNT_CMD  10
#define PORTIO_CLR_IRQ_CNT_CMD  11
#define PORTIO_GET_IRQ_TIME_CMD 12

#define PORTIO_IOCTL     'k'  // magic number for ioctl

// IOCTL Macros
#define PORTIO_GET_IRQ_CNT_IOCTL    _IOR(PORTIO_IOCTL, PORTIO_GET_IRQ_CNT_CMD, unsigned long)
#define PORTIO_CLR_IRQ_CNT_IOCTL    _IOR(PORTIO_IOCTL, PORTIO_CLR_IRQ_CNT_CMD, unsigned long)
#define PORTIO_GET_IRQ_TIME_IOCTL   _IOR(PORTIO_IOCTL, PORTIO_GET_IRQ_TIME_CMD, unsigned long)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the 32 bit compatible IOCTL routine, from portio.c.  I've confirmed that this is being called only when my program is compiled as 32bit, and the driver is 64bit.</p>

<pre><code>static long portio_compat_ioctl( struct inode *inode, struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
{
unsigned char cmd_number;
int cmd_size=0;
//...
cmd_number = _IOC_NR( cmd );
cmd_size = _IOC_SIZE( cmd );

printk( KERN_ALERT ""Portio Compat IOCTL number,size = %d,%d, cmd_number, cmd_size );
//... Switch statement and cases, based on cmd_number
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output looks like this:</p>

<p>Portio Compat IOTCL number,size = 224,3157</p>

<p>Of course, the code expects IOCTL numbers from 1-12, and sizes around 4 or 8.  That's exactly what comes back when the code and driver are both either 64bit or 32bit.  </p>

I can refactor the two anonymous functions as follows and it still works:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""p"").hover(hilite, remove_hilite);
  });

  function hilite()
  {
    $(this).addClass(""hilite"");
  }

  function remove_hilite()
  {
    $(this).removeClass(""hilite"");
  }
</code></pre>

<p>However, what if I want to pass an argument to <code>hilite</code>? My first guess was that I should use an anonymous function like <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/How%5FjQuery%5FWorks#Right"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>. However, this does not seem to work, even when I'm using it without arguments:</p>

<pre><code>$(""p"").hover(
    function()
    {
        hilite();
    }
    ,
    function()
    {
        remove_hilite();
    }
);

<p>I also tried refactoring as follows, but this did not work either:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""p"").hover(hilite2, remove_hilite);
  });

  function hilite2(){
     return hilite();
  }
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to do this? I feel like I have a big conceptual misunderstanding. In particular, I am unclear about how in my first refactoring, the <code>this</code> object is passed to the <code>hilite</code> function.</p>

I think I got the geometry right (3D sub-scene, TriangleMesh, etc.) but I am fighting with the proper lighting.

JavaFX seems to introduce some unwanted default lighting if there is no explicit lighting specified and is driving me crazy.</p>

Here is the requested code example. When the box is rotating you clearly see the corners of the box due to the lighting. If you could switch off the lighting these corners should disappear.</p>

As I'm using an old JVM (1.4) and only interested in playing WAV files, JMF was a perfect solution and has greatly simplified the code to load, play and control the volume of audio clips in my application.</p>

<p>But I'm having trouble <strong>stopping the clips on demand</strong>.  It would seem as simple as calling <code>player.stop()</code>, but <code>stop()</code> seems to block until the player has finished playing.  Here is a simple code example:</p>

<pre><code>Player p = Manager.createRealizedPlayer( f.toURI().toURL() );

p.start();
System.out.println( ""Player playing"" );

Thread.sleep( 1000 );
System.out.println( "" Clip is at time: "" + p.getMediaTime().getSeconds() );

p.stop();
System.out.println( "" Clip is at time: "" + p.getMediaTime().getSeconds() );
</code></pre>

<p>This produces output like:</p>

<pre><code>Player playing
 Clip is at time: 0.8591836730000001
 Clip is at time: 3.227619047
</code></pre>

<p>where I would have expected the second time to read equal to or only briefly later than the first.  (Or perhaps to have been reset to 0 or something.)  I have also tried <code>p.setStopTime( p.getMediaTime() )</code>.  This stops the clip on time, but plays a split second of distortion before stopping, which is undesirable.</p>

<p>Googling around makes me think that others aren't having this issue, and it's been kind of hard to find options.  Could this be a buffering issue or am I missing something else?  Any insight you can provide is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> I am using (and cannot change) JVM 1.4.2 with JMF 2.1.1.  All of my WAV files are only 1-10 seconds long.</p>

<p>Ruby provides a <a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/monitor/rdoc/Monitor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Monitor</a>, with ConditionVariables. </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_%28synchronization%29"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia article on Monitors</a> (which the ruby doc even references) says there are a couple different models/designs for how Monitors should work, with regard to which thread gets access to the mutual exclusion lock after a signal/wake. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/09/java-concurrency-part-5-monitors-locks-and-conditions/"" rel=""nofollow"">This article on Java</a> explains it pretty clearly (or maybe it's only clear if you've been beating your head against this stuff for a while):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Signal &amp; Continue (SC) : The process who signal keep the mutual exclusion and the signaled will be awaken but need to acquire the mutual exclusion before going.</p></li>
<li><p>Signal &amp; Wait (SW) : The signaler is blocked and must wait for mutual exclusion to continue and the signaled thread is directly awaken and can start continue its operations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(And a couple more less common ones that are really variations on those two). </p>

<p><strong>Does anyone know which one ruby uses? It does not seem to be documented. Does it depend on ruby implementation (MRI vs jruby vs rubinius etc)?</strong></p>

<p>It does matter for certain designs. I think I had been beating my head against the wall because I had been assuming ruby used ""SW"" because that seemed 'obvious' to me, before I realized different implementations of 'Monitor' did it differently. Now, based on what I've been observing, I'm thinking ruby actually uses ""SC"" as above. </p>

<p>Meaning that after a signal is sent, while a thread will be awoken -- but there's no guarantee that thread will get the mutual exclusion lock <em>next</em>, some other random thread that was waiting on it might get it first. </p>

<p>If there are any gurus out there who can answer this for sure, it would be much appreciated. </p>

<p>The dialog size is 800x600, but the images have different sizes. I want to scale the image based on their width/height to fully use the dialog, and keep the width/height ratio.</p>

<p>I know how to use javascript to keep the image ratio, but the question is: how can I do it in the jQuery-UI dialog? the dialog does not have a loaded event. In its open event, $('#ui_img') does not exists yet.</p>

<p>Currently, the idea I have is: in PreviewImage(), load the image file, scale it, create a temp image, then show it in partial view. It should work, but it loads/scales image on server side. Is there a way to do this on browser side? If we can use jQuery for the element after dialog pops up, then we should be able to do it. But how? The dialog pops after the click.</p>

<p><code>content-type</code> should be normally wrapped into quotes. Is this a known bug in one of the used frameworks/servers? What can I do to work around this? And why is there no problem when using the Eclipse Web Services Explorer? Is it more fault-tolerant (as my Firefox seems to be as it also doesn't have any problems to display a graphical representation of the generated wsdl).</p>

<p>I have two questions/problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>I know how to echo the username, but it's value is removed/reset when I refresh the page (or click the links).</li>
<li>How can I use the same username to set it as e.g. the author of a post if the page removes the username on refresh?</li>

<p>I have created the following function withing the Login class:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

<pre><code>foreach (string role in System.Web.Security.Roles.GetAllRoles())
  foreach (string user in System.Web.Security.Roles.GetUsersInRole(role))
</code></pre>

<p>I then compare usernames for the existing users in the role, and the username (as a string) I am trying to authorize.  And it works fine, as expected, as long as the Role provider is setup for the web application.</p>

<p>However, I also have a timer job that is used to process incoming emails sent to the smtp server and relayed locally to the smtp drop folder (<code>C:\inetpub\mailroot\drop</code>).  The timer job then reads the email from the drop folder, and parses/processes it.  To identity the user sending the email, I take the ""from address"" and do a lookup to the sharepoint site to get the user's identity using SPUtility.</p>

<p>But, I need to check if the user is in a role specified by that web site's FBA Role Provider.  The role provider details are black box, unknown and can be changed at run time, so I have to use the role provider built-in functionality, ie. <code>Roles.GetAllRoles</code>, <code>Roles.GetUsersInRole(x)</code>.  (I can't go directly to the database or other behind the scenes data source).  I do however know the address of the website that I need to authorize the user against from the job timer.</p>

<p>But, <code>System.Web.Security.Roles.GetAllRoles()</code> is not accessible to the job timer because its not an asp.net web application (actually part of the OWSTIMER.exe windows service).</p>

<p>So, How do I check if a ""loginname"" is a member of a Role from within a Job Timer?</p>

<p>NOTE: This question could also be asked completely leaving SharePoint out, and assuming that I want to check a ""loginname"" from within a Windows Service or WinForms Application.  I basically need to check if a user is in a FBA Role (RoleProvider specified in an asp.net 2.0-3.5 web application's web.config settings), from a source that is not the windows application where the role provider is defined and accessible.</p>

<p>Also, I can't use a web service since the goal is to only have a SharePoint Web Part and SharePoint Job Timer.</p>

<pre><code>NSData *resultsData = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest: req returningResponse: &amp;response error: &amp;err];
</code></pre>

<p>The server credentials were embedded in the URL. This worked fine for me since the program really could not continue to do anything while the data was being fetched. A change to the server authentication method however has forced the need for changes to this application. I have tried all the usual workarounds with a NSURLCredential but that still does not work with this service.</p>

<p>So it looks like I will need to change to the asynchronous call:</p>

<pre><code>[[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request
                                delegate:self 
                        startImmediately:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>I have this working with the appropriate delegate methods, most importantly:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:(NSURLAuthenticationChallenge *)challenge
</code></pre>

<p>Although I'd love to just use some form of delay loop to check for when the data has finished loading (essentially making it synchronous again), I have not found a way to do this that does not actually block the connection.</p>

<p>I am able to use a NSTimer to wait for the data before continuing:</p>

<pre><code>set theJobListTimer to current application's NSTimer's scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval_target_selector_userInfo_repeats_(0.05, me, ""jobListTimerFired:"", """", true)

    on jobListTimerFired_(theTimer)
      (jobListData as list) &amp; count of jobListData
    if count of jobListData ≠ 0  then
        log ""jobListTimerFired_ done""
        tell theTimer to invalidate()
        setUpJobList(jobListData)
    end if
end jobListTimerFired_

<p>but this is clumsy and does not work while I'm in a modal dialog:</p>

<pre><code>    set buttonReturned to current application's NSApp's runModalForWindow_(collectionWindow)
</code></pre>

<p>(I have a drop down in the dialog that needs to be updated with the results of the web service call). Right now, the delegate methods are blocked until the modal is dismissed. </p>

<p>Is there no simple way to emulate the synchronous call using the async methods? </p>

<p>Trying to use semaphore, I changed code to:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) startConnection:(int)reqType :(NSMutableURLRequest *)request {

requestType = [NSNumber numberWithInt:reqType];

    dispatch_semaphore_t semaphore = dispatch_semaphore_create(0);

    // This could be any block that is run asynchronously
    void (^myBlock)(void) = ^(void) {

        self.connection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request
                                                          delegate:self 
                                                  startImmediately:YES];

    myBlock();

if (self.connection) {
        // create an object to hold the received data
        self.receivedData = [NSMutableData data];
        NSLog(@""connection started %@"", requestType);
    }

   dispatch_time_t timeOut = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, 10 * NSEC_PER_SEC);
    dispatch_semaphore_wait(semaphore, timeOut);
    dispatch_release(semaphore);
    semaphore = NULL;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then in the connection handler:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection
{
NSLog(@""connectionDidFinishLoading %@"", requestType);

NSString *returnData = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:receivedData
                                             encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] ;
//      NSLog(@""connectionDidFinishLoading %@"", returnData);

[self handleData:requestType :returnData];

[self terminate];

if(semaphore) {
    dispatch_semaphore_signal(semaphore);
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the connectionDidFinishLoading handler (and for that matter the didReceiveResponse and didReceiveData handlers) do not get called until after the 10 second dispatch timeout. What am I missing here?</p>

My standard application setup has always been nTier application (Presentation, Business, Data and usually a Common).

<p>My understanding of IoC allows dependency injection which in turn makes unit testing possible (well a lot easier) so in my head I'd want to at least perform unit tests on the Business Layer....but every example of setting up IoC like StructureMap makes the IoC on the Presentation layer.

I want to get Information of the beginning and the end of a sequence of DNA from a database (in SQLite) and then want to add the sequence to the database from a file that contains the whole genome of my organism. So basically I want a piece of text from a  text file and I know the position the piece starts and the position it ends. So what I did is, I broke down the text to letters, put them into an array and just make up a new array by picking all elements inbetween my start and end point. And for some reason it does not do that for every row I fetch from the database. 
What I did so far to solve the problem: I looked if all my variables exist, and they do. It is to my knowledge not a database problem nor a problem with my input file. So why does the skript not go through every for loop? </p>

                    The philosophy of the Career and Technical Education Department (CTE) reflects Amity’s Common Core of Learning goals to prepare 
                    students for life by offering them opportunities to acquire skills and competencies in the areas of career and family living. 
                    Course variety gives students the chance to experience growth and learning in many areas essential to becoming productive and 
                    contributing members of society. Career and Technical Education courses also provide students with the opportunities to pursue 
                    academic excellence through a variety of learning experiences which address the diversity of our student population. 
                    Heterogeneous grouping allows for experiences which reflect a microcosm of society (mutual respect, sense of caring/cooperation,
                     sense of community, etc.) The various electives offered by the Career and Technical Education Department will enhance the 
                    future of students whether they are pursuing post secondary education, entering directly into the job market, or developing 
                    personal and leisure-time interests.

<p>Once per day I need to perform update_or_create on the entire database to refresh the data with an updated file from an external source. I imagine the fastest way to do this would be to load the table into a RAM-based table, perform all the updates, and then flush it back to the SQLite3 file. Alternately, I could create a new table, bulk-load everything, and then swap the new table into place of the original table. Either approach works conceptually.</p>

<p>What I am wondering is how do I go about doing either of these? Which is preferred from a performance perspective? Which will have the least disk IO?</p>

<p>I will try to explain this as best as I can.</p>

<p>I have a database setup and I am trying to add on some functionality. I have a concern about performance, data redundancy, and so-called best practices.</p>

<p>I have multiple users in the database and I am trying to set up ""benchmarks"" for each user.  Each user can have a theoretically infinite number of benchmarks (though in reality it is almost always less than 5 but I don't want to constrain myself to that) and each benchmark can have a different set of values for each YEAR moving forward and management estimates the benchmarks for the upcoming 3-4 years. That means each year another benchmark value will exist.</p>

<p>Here is an example.</p>

<p>Person A</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark 1:  2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015
Benchmark 2:  2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015
</code></pre>

<p>So on and so forth for each user and each benchmark.</p>

<p>My question is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>How should I set up the tables for this?  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Set up a benchmark table that has a relationship to the user and columns for each year. I would have to actually update the database each year and add another column for the new year and it could grow out of hand over an extremely long period of time.  </p>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong>: Set up a table for the benchmark names with a relationship to the user, a table with years, and a table with benchmark data that has a relationship to the benchmark and the year? This seems like a better approach for maintenance sake but it would also mean the same benchmark name would exist multiple times but with a different year and value. I wouldn't have to add a column during a new year, just make sure the year existed in the years table.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3</strong>: Something you guys tell me is a better option? I'm hoping.</p>

<p>Assume the data sets are large and there are many users. </p>

<p>I have a .ini file which contains a unknown amount of variables, created by a python script through a IRC interface.</p>

<p>The format of the .ini file is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[varables]
0 = example
1 = example2
2 = exapmle3
#and so on.
</code></pre>

<p>What i want to do with the varables in the .ini file <em>is append each individual varable in the .ini file into a list.</em></p>

<p>This is a the code in the main Python file that i'm using to try and accomplish this with: (not the entire file, but what's being used to do this task.)</p>

<pre><code>import ConfigParser
import os

#Config parser: 
class UnknownValue(Exception): pass
def replace_line(old_line, new_line):
    f = open(""setup.ini"")
    for line in f:
        line = os.linesep.join([s for s in line.splitlines() if s])
        if line == old_line:
            f1 = open(""setup.ini"",'r')
            stuff = f1.read()
            f1.close()
            new_stuff = re.sub(old_line,new_line,stuff)
            f = open(""setup.ini"",'w')
            f.write(new_stuff)
            f.close()        
def get_options(filename):
    config = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()
    try:
        config.read(filename)
    except ConfigParser.ParsingError, e:
        pass
    sections = config.sections()
    output = {}
    for section in sections:
        output[section] = {}
        for opt in config.options(section):
            value = config.get(section, opt)
            output[section][opt] = value
    return output

bot_owners = []#this becomes a list with every varable in the .ini file.


#gets the number of varables to be set, then loops appending each entry into their corosponding lists for later use.
setup_file = get_options(""owner.ini"")
num_lines = (sum(1 for line in open('owner.ini'))-1)#gets amount of varables in the file, and removes 1 for the header tag.
print ""lines "", num_lines
x = 0
while x != num_lines:
    #loops through appending all the varables inside of the .ini file to the list 'bot_owners'
    y = str(x)
    bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners'][y])#this fails becuase it can't take a varable as a argument?
    x += 1

print (bot_owners)
print (num_lines)
</code></pre>

<p>I find out the number of varables in the .ini file using this line:</p>

<pre><code>num_lines = (sum(1 for line in open('owner.ini'))-1)#gets amount of varables in the file, and removes 1 for the header tag.
</code></pre>

<p>i could append each vararable in the .ini file to the list by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners']['0'])
bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners']['1'])
bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners']['2'])
#ect
</code></pre>

<p>but this requries me to know the number of varables in the .ini file, which i cannot know, and it would be silly to try and it like this, as it imposes a limit on the amount of varables the .ini file could contain, and it reqires a ton of code that could be made far less.</p>

<pre><code>if num_lines == 1:    
    bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners']['0'])
elif num_lines == 2:
    bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners']['1'])
elif num_lines == 3:
    bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners']['2'])
#ect
</code></pre>

<p><em>What's <strong>wrong</strong> with this code though</em>, is with my <strong>loop</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>x = 0 #what varable is going to be appended
while x != num_lines:
    #loops through appending all the varables inside of the .ini file to the list 'bot_owners'
    y = str(x)
    bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners'][y]) #&lt;-- THE PROBLEM
    x += 1
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners'][y])</strong> line brings up the folowing error:</p>

<pre><code>KeyError: '0'
</code></pre>

<p>After looking about on the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentaion</a> for Python's configParser libary, if i'm correct, this error is caused by the 2'nd argument <strong>[y]</strong> becuase a varable can't be used as an argument, even if the varable contains a string that could be ""1"", yet <strong>bot_owners.append(setup_file['owners'][""1""])</strong> works.</p>

<p>What i'm asking here, is if there is another way to do this, or how i could use a loop to append each individual varable inside of a .ini file into a list.</p>

<p>Hopefully i have provided enough information for you to try and help.
Thanks for your time and help.</p>

<p>I was trying to figure out how in XAML to program the trigger to look for the visibility of the grid. Then depending on its state make the animation grow or shrink. So based on the code below I would like to make the grid go from 1925 to 0 if the trigger determines the visibility is visible and 0 to 1925 if the grid is showing collapsed upon button click. Want to stay away from the code knowing whats going on in the UI. Which is why later I will bind grid visibility to a property.</p>

&lt;div id=""content""&gt;
 &lt;div id=""contact""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I have the slideshow working on a page with no layout here: <a href=""http://www.studentbridges.org/nivo-slider/slideshow.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.studentbridges.org/nivo-slider/slideshow.php</a> .</p>

<p>But once I add it to my layout, it simply does not display. <a href=""http://www.studentbridges.org/new/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.studentbridges.org/new/</a> </p>

<p>On that page, the slideshow is supposed to appear over the picture in the header. It just doesn't work. Here is the code for how I set up the slideshow:</p>

        &lt;div id=""htmlcaption"" class=""nivo-html-caption""&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is an example of a &lt;em&gt;HTML&lt;/em&gt; caption with &lt;a href=""#""&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt;. 
        &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/nivo-slider/jquery-1.7.1.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/nivo-slider/jquery.nivo.slider.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(window).load(function() {
$('#slider').nivoSlider({
    effect: 'fade', // Specify sets like: 'fold,fade,sliceDown'
    animSpeed: 500, // Slide transition speed
    pauseTime: 3000, // How long each slide will show
    startSlide: 0, // Set starting Slide (0 index)
    directionNav: true, // Next &amp; Prev navigation
    directionNavHide: true, // Only show on hover

});
});
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>I believe I have all the stylesheets linked in my header. All the images are the same size as the container DIV as well, so I'm not sure what the issue is.</p>

<p>Anyone have any input as to what the issue could be?</p>

<p>How can I assign an instance of version_controlled_vector to an std::vector type? The only solution I can think of, is an appropriate copy-constructor, but it should take place in the std::vector class, so it is not an option.</p>

So, if I have many entities all using different textures how do i go about applying a texture to an entity, rendering the entity, then binding the next to apply to the next entity. </p>

<p>I guess I'm confused about the timing of applying a texture to an entity and rendering it with the correct texture. I am planning on using texture atlases for similar sprites and animations and stuff. But i don't know how to have a texture or a portion of a texture (texture atlas) saved to an entity before rendering so i can move on to applying the next texture to the other entities.</p>

<p>Similarly, if i have a texture atlas loaded and use it to animate one entity but also need a different entity to animate, that uses a different texture atlas, do i need to have the game load the other atlas and apply it to achieve the other animation?</p>

<p>I'm familiar with the opengl es 2.0 api. I just need help how to apply it.</p>

Environment: rhel 6, tomcat 6.0.24, mod_proxy_ajp, tomcat with apr, spring httpinvoker
Error also occurs without apr and with http instead of ajp
Our java client sends serialized java objects to  apache which forwards the data to the tomcat
If the resulting serialized data contains (binary) a line feed (0a) followed by ""post"" (""\npost"") then the communication is cut and tomcat sends back an http500.

<p>Does anyone know why the communication is cut and who cuts it (Tomcat or Apache)?
We think that one of them can't handle the line feed followed by ""post"" in the post data?!</p>

<p>Our workaround is to escape every 'p' or 'P' so that the line can only begin with \p but to do that we have to overwrite input- and outputstreams which slows down the whole system.</p>

Because rails does not reuse object a new object, as well as a new SSH connection to the server, will be created for ever request that is received.  To reduce server stress I want to close the SSH connection before the model object gets garbage collected.

<p>Again that code is stripped down to its simplest form possible so I don't have 3 full pages of code... but if you would like to see anything I am not showing please let me know... </p>

<p>Finally, according to the MYSQL panel in Yosemite’s PREFERENCE panel I already have the ability to start and restart MySql automatically.</p>

It displays lots of different elements that are created at run-time and is scrollable in both dimensions using scrollTo() and scrollBy(). Scrolling works and now I'd like to add the standard Android scrollbars.</p>

<p>Using Scrollviews ist not possible, since I need the Layout to be scrollable in 2 dimensions, so I tried to do it as described here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4869276/android-enable-scrollbars-on-canvas-based-view"">Android: Enable Scrollbars on Canvas-Based View</a></p>

<p>There are tons of questions like this in various mailing lists and on SO, but everywhere the answer seems to be ""1. call setHorizontalScrollbarEnabled(true), 2. implement all the compute* methods, 3. call awakenScrollbars()"". As far as I can tell, I have done all of that and even tried to use initializeScrollbars() but nothing happens and the docs don't offer any help.</p>

    setHorizontalScrollBarEnabled(true);

    TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(R.styleable.View);
    initializeScrollbars(a);
    a.recycle();

Here is a subset of my schema (it's a blog), using declarative:</p>

<pre><code>class Tag(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'tags'
    id            = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    tag           = Column(Unicode(255), unique=True, nullable=False)

class EntryTag(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'entrytags'
    entry_id      = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('entries.id'), key='entry', primary_key=True)
    tag_id        = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('tags.id'), key='tag', primary_key=True)

class Entry(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'entries'
    id            = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    subject       = Column(Unicode(255), nullable=False)
    # some other fields here
    _tags         = relation('Tag', backref='entries', secondary=EntryTag.__table__)
    tags          = association_proxy('_tags','tag')
</code></pre>

<p>Here's how I'm trying to use it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; e = db.query(Entry).first()
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.tags
[u'foo']
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.tags = [u'foo', u'bar']  # really this is from a comma-separated input
db.commit()
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (IntegrityError) duplicate key value violates unique constraint ""tags_tag_key""
 'INSERT INTO tags (id, tag) VALUES (%(id)s, %(tag)s)' {'tag': 'bar', 'id': 11L}
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(lambda t:(t.id,t.tag), db.query(Tag).all())
[(1, u'foo'), (2, u'bar'), (3, u'baz')]
</code></pre>

<p>The tag <code>u'bar'</code> already existed with id 2; why didn't SQLAlchemy just attach that one instead of trying to create it? Is my schema wrong somehow?</p>

"29135750","1","29135851","","2015-03-19 01:31:02","","2","49","<p>I have a list <code>L</code> of dictionaries, where the dictionaries have the same set of keys.</p>

<p>I have another dictionary <code>d</code>, which also has the same set of keys as the previous dictionaries. </p>

<p>For each <code>key</code> in the set of keys, <code>d[key]</code> is a function which can apply to <code>L[i][key]</code>, i.e. <code>d[key](L[i][key])</code>. </p>

<p>I want to reset the values of dictionaries in <code>L</code>, using the functions in the values of <code>d</code>, i.e. </p>

<pre><code>L[i][key] = d[key](L[i][key])

<p>for all <code>key</code> and all <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>How can I do it in a more pythonic way? Thanks.</p>

<p>E.g. </p>

<pre><code>d = {'a':int, 'b':myfun, 'c':yourfun}

L[1] = {'a':`10`, 'b':5, 'c':1.4}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>int</code> is a type conversion function <code>int()</code>, <code>myfun</code> is a function which can take an integer as its argument, and <code>yourfun</code> is another function which can take a floating number as its argument.</p>
