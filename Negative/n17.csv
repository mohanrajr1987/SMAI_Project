<li><p>telerik:RadTreeView supports virtualization but only if you use telerik:TreeViewPanel which supports only Vertical orientation while I need Horizontal. Even if I use telerik:VirtualizingWrapPanel virtualization is disabled. </p></li>
<li><p>TreeView works only with VirtualizingStackPanel with Orientation set to Vertical. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've seen some implementations of VirtualizingWrapPanel but they don't work on 2nd level probably because TreeView measures 2nd level item with height equals to infinity.</p>

<p>I tried the maven jetty plugin, but after a few builds I keep getting java permGen issues and then it just hangs.  I was told this was because spring uses log4j and it has some sort of leaks?</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm asking for tips to help fire up a server, tomcat, with my updated code so I can make quick updates and have tomcat reloaded.</p>

<p>Here are my current annoyances with tomcat:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Only code changes seem to get auto-reloaded, if I make changes to my view pages things don't get updated unless I redeploy.  The maven jetty plugin seems to map to my view pages directly and I saw updates to my view pages instantly w/o it even redeploying.</p></li>
<li><p>if I have more than 1 thing running in intelliJ, like say I have a main program that I run, or a unit test, IntelliJ seems to re-order what gets run in the run drop down menu and also the shortcut keys get changed to the last thing I ran.</p></li>
<li><p>I use google chrome, for some reason when I start tomcat it brings firefox to the forefront and opens a new tab each and every time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If someone can address any or all of the above issues that would be great as I hate this dance I have to go through just to update/redeploy my application.  I wish it could just be a consitant method, using shortcuts or automatically without me having to close the tab created in firefox, and then minimizie it, or redploy for a simple view change etc.</p>

<p>So I just have a simple bean that I want to send as a JSON Object. I have followed all the steps, but I am not able to send the JSON Object (although I do recieve the XML format correctly). I obtain the following exception: <em>com.sun.jersey.api.MessageException: A message body writer for Java class de.vogella.jersey.jaxb.model.Todo, and Java type class de.vogella.jersey.jaxb.model.Todo, and MIME media type application/json was not found</em></p>

<p>I have tried different solutions that I found around, but nothing seems to work. 
I am wondering if I must have any dependencies missing or I have to implement a ContextResolver (although any tutorials use them for easy objects like these ones).</p>

<p>These are the dependencies that I have:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;dependencies&gt;

Another question - do I <em>want</em> to change this?

To add a search funcionality, I make the same  but passing <code>TextBox.Text</code> as parameter to the <code>SELECT... LIKE ...</code> statement.
To add an edit funcionality(a button in every row) I need the previous data in the <code>dataTable</code>, and if I performed a search before editing I need only the result of the search in my  <code>dataTable</code>. 
The problem is, I don't know how to keep its value alive (persistent), and <code>dataTable</code> has 0 columns when I press teh edit button, so it doesn't display anything to edit.
I guess it happens because I'm using <code>Using</code>, and <code>dataTable</code> is probably getting cleaned after <code>End Using</code>.</p>

<p>In that case, whta can I do to fix it? I thought removing <code>miconn.Close()</code> but it doesn't solve anything, in fact, I don't know if connection is still open after <code>End Using</code>.</p>

<p>I've managed to get to this piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>@items = Item.joins(""left join impressions on impressions.impressionable_id = items.id and impressions.impressionable_type = 'Item'"")
                   .select(""count(distinct(ip_address)) as counter, impressionable_id, items.title, items.id, items.image"")

<p>This sorts the items by total unique views. However, I want to only count the impressions which have been made within the last 10 days. This led me to add a <code>where</code> method as such:</p>

<pre><code>  time_range = (Time.now - 10.days)..Time.now

  @items = Item.joins(""left join impressions on impressions.impressionable_id = items.id and impressions.impressionable_type = 'Item'"")
   .select(""count(distinct(ip_address)) as counter, impressionable_id, items.title, items.id, items.image"")
   .where('impressions.created_at' =&gt; time_range)
   .group('items.id')
   .order(""counter desc"")
   .page(params[:page])
   .per_page(9)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this excludes the items which has no views, which is not what I want. These should be represented with 0 view.</p>

<p>The line <code>items = parser.getItems()</code> works fine - <code>items</code> being the arraylist containing each item from the XML. The problem I'm facing is that on starting the activity, the ProgressDialog which i create in <code>onPreExecute()</code> isn't displayed until <em>after</em> the <code>doInBackground()</code> method has finished. i.e. I get a black screen, a long pause, then a completely populated list with the items in. Why is this happening? Why isn't the UI drawing, the ProgressDialog showing, the parser getting the items and incrementally adding them to the list, then the ProgressDialog dismissing?</p>

<p>As an example, I was recently trying out Linq in Visual C# 2008 and I was loading an XML file into an XDocument. It was only through testing that I realised that if you try to load a file that doesn't exist, it will throw a FileNotFound exception, but if you try to load a directory instead of a file you'll get an UnauthorizedAccessException. Also looking through the System.IO namespace I can see things like a FileLoad exception and a PathTooLongException, and I can guess when they might be thrown but there could be others out there that might be thrown in some circumstance I haven't thought of yet. </p>

<p>The only solution I've got right now is just to catch the ones I know about and then catch the Exception type, but I would rather be able to know exactly which types of exceptions I'm most likely to run into and why. I would have thought the MSDN library would have this type of information, but I can't find it anywhere. Am I just blind? Is this information anywhere else?</p>

<p>EDIT: Some more specifics, right now I'm looking for the exceptions that might be thrown by the XDocument.Load(string) function. It looks like there is nothing relevant in the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb343181.aspx"">online documentation</a> or the object browser. Do I now have to just run some tests and see what I run in to?</p>

<p>i want to try to implement, at least for the next 3 years, a simple, proven way to architect my applications. 
Every time i am going to start a project it feels like it's the first time because of the overwhelming number of ""ways"" to  create websites these days.</p>

<p>i have this sample code i got from this package i purchased call Design Pattern Framework 4 C#. Among the multiple projects they have, there is one, which is called, Design Patterns in Action. You can download it from here <a href=""https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=B853B0DB724C30E5!16735&amp;authkey=!AOeHSAWa_P4vzzU"">https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=B853B0DB724C30E5!16735&amp;authkey=!AOeHSAWa_P4vzzU</a> </p>

<p>My question, after you take a look at that solution, What's good, bad, what would you keep, what would you remove, what's unnecessary, etc etc. about this example?</p>

<p>I understand they are trying to show multiple clients and also multiple DAOs. But overall, would this architecture be one that you would take as a ""template""?
Thanks.</p>

"4222293","1","4226065","","2010-11-19 05:14:57","","3","2343","<p>I'm attempting to implement what can best be described as ""an FTP interface to an HTTP API"".  Essentially, there is an existing REST API that can be used to manage a user's files for a site, and I'm building a mediator server that re-exposes this API as an FTP server.  So you can login with, say, Filezilla and list your files, upload new ones, delete old ones, etc.</p>

<p>I'm attempting this with <code>twisted.protocols.ftp</code> for the (FTP) server, and <code>twisted.web.client</code> for the (HTTP) client.</p>

<p>The thing I'm running up against is, when a user tries to download a file, ""streaming"" that file from an HTTP response to my FTP response.  Similar for uploading.</p>

<p>The most straightforward approach would be to download the entire file from the HTTP server, then turn around and send the contents to the user.  The problem with this is that any given file could be many gigabytes large (think drive images, ISO files, etc).  With this approach, though, the contents of the file would be held in memory between the time I download it from the API and the time I send it to the user - not good.</p>

<p>So my solution is to try to ""stream"" it - as I get chunks of data from the API's HTTP response, I just want to turn around and send those chunks along to the FTP user.  <em>Seems</em> straightforward.</p>

<p>For my ""custom FTP functionality"", I'm using a subclass of <code>ftp.FTPShell</code>.  The reading method of this, <code>openForReading</code>, returns a Deferred that fires with an implementation of <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.1.0/api/twisted.protocols.ftp.IReadFile.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>IReadFile</code></a>.</p>

<p>Below is my (initial, simple) implementation for ""streaming HTTP"".  I use the <code>fetch</code> function to setup an HTTP request, and the callback I pass in gets called with each chunk I get from the response.</p>

<p>I thought I could use some sort of two-ended buffer object to transport the chunks between the HTTP and FTP, by using the buffer object as the file-like object required by <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.1.0/api/twisted.protocols.ftp._FileReader.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ftp._FileReader</code></a>, but that's quickly proving not to work, as the consumer from the <code>send</code> call almost immediately closes the buffer (because it's returning an empty string, because there's no data to read yet, etc).  Thus, I'm ""sending"" empty files before I even start receiving the HTTP response chunks.</p>

<p>Am I close, but missing something?  Am I on the wrong path altogether?  Is what I want to do <em>really</em> impossible (I highly doubt that)?</p>

<pre><code>from twisted.web import client
import urlparse

I just noticed I am having another problem. If I highlight one of the items with a white background, the text is invisible. How do I fix this?<br>
<strong>Edit 3:</strong>
Fixed this problem by setting the background to <code>Colors.Transparent</code> instead of <code>Colors.White</code>.</p>

<p>The Gradle window is available from View -> Tool Windows -> Gradle, where I can see a list of all of these tasks that are presumably found in the Android Build plugin.  Is there any way to view those tasks from AS?  Could I access the source code for the plugin somewhere?

<p>Some cursory research (I am not a Fortran programmer) indicates to me that if reading this using the Fortran <code>READ</code> function, one can check the <code>IOSTAT</code> flag to determine if you are at the end of the file.

I have discovered that webcams (at least 3 I have) provide higher resolutions and framerates for mJPEG output format. So far I was using YUY2, converted in I420 for compression with X264. To transcode mJPEG to I420, I need to decode it first. I am trying to decode images from webcam with libavcodec. This is my code.</p>

<p>Initialization:</p>

<pre><code>// mJPEG to I420 conversion
AVCodecContext * _transcoder = nullptr;
AVFrame * _outputFrame;
AVPacket _inputPacket;

avcodec_register_all();
_outputFrame = av_frame_alloc();

AVCodec * codecDecode = avcodec_find_decoder(AV_CODEC_ID_MJPEG);

_transcoder = avcodec_alloc_context3(codecDecode);
avcodec_get_context_defaults3(_transcoder, codecDecode);
_transcoder-&gt;flags2 |= CODEC_FLAG2_FAST;
_transcoder-&gt;pix_fmt = AVPixelFormat::AV_PIX_FMT_YUV420P;
_transcoder-&gt;width = width;
_transcoder-&gt;height = height;
avcodec_open2(_transcoder, codecDecode, nullptr);

<p>Decoding:</p>

<pre><code>_inputPacket.size = size;
_inputPacket.data = data;

int got_picture;
int decompressed_size = avcodec_decode_video2(_transcoder, _outputFrame, &amp;got_picture, &amp;_inputPacket);
</code></pre>

<p>But so far, what I am getting is a green screen. Where am I wrong?</p>

<p>UPD:
I have enabled libavcodec logging, but there are not warnings or errors.
Also I have discovered that _outputframe has AV_PIX_FMT_YUVJ422P as format and colorspace, which does not fit any on values in libavcodec's enums (the actual value is 156448160). </p>

<p>While going this route, I'm facing issues with back button navigation when using multi level fragments. How can I have a standard and consistent back button behaviour when going the single activity route?</p>

<p>Following is the code for back navigation for single child fragment:</p>

                if (isEnableFragmentBackStack()) {
                    getChildFragmentManager().popBackStack();

var app = express();

<p>Then I am handling ajax query:</p>

<pre><code>var promise = function() {

<p>I am using <a href=""http://foundation.zurb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">foundation 5</a> which is why I am having to using a jQuery script to override the CSS instead of <code>vertical-align: middle</code> etc...</p>

<p>The script is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    var row = $('.row').css(""height"");

    var center = $('.center');
    center.height(row);

    var centered = $('.centered');
    var imgSize = parseInt(centered.css(""height"")) / 2;
    var rowInt = parseInt(row);
    var top = (rowInt / 2) - imgSize;
    centered.css({""margin-top"" : top + 'px'});

});
</code></pre>

<p>Basically what this does is set the column that holds the image to the same height as the parent row, then it sets the <code>margin-top</code> of the image to be half the size of the column <strong>minus</strong> half the size of the image.</p>

<p>It works for the first column, but then applies the same height/margin to the remaining rows.</p>

<p>To see the full thing in action please see this <strong><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/bL4bhy1a/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">FIDDLE</a></strong> (<strong>jsFiddle results window will have to be wide enough for image to be left/right of text, if too small image will just move to above/below text</strong>).</p>

<p>What I need is the script to run on each individual row, and be ready to handle more rows if they should come later on.</p>

<p>That way i can just use ajax to continually poll the .JSON file instead of the database(which should be faster me thinks), and when it sees an update it updates a list with the new update.</p>

<p>My problem is how do i append the updated object from json, and also what if there are 3 updates in that period, how do i print out just the 3 updates</p>

<p>Question 1: Custom collections</p>

<p>What do you think about custom collections ? JS/CS is one of the weakest languages in this aspect; For instance there is no Array.remove and you have to use the cumbersome splice() method instead. Some function libraries (Like underscore) augment the API by providing functions taking arrays/objects as the first arg but given the choice I would prefer to write:</p>

<pre><code>list fancyFunction 3, 4
</code></pre>

<p>rather than</p>

<pre><code>fancyFunction list 3, 4
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say I create a List class; Is it possible and if yes, what are the requisites for this class to be able to use CS's comprehension syntax ? Worst case scenario, I guess the List could have a toArray() method and the usual CS operations could be performed on that returned value instead, but I hope there is a better solution.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to be able to define rich, custom collections, but not at the cost of losing comprehensions, etc.</p>

<p>Question 2: Mutability</p>

<p>What are people feelings about being very careful with mutability in CS/JS in general ?</p>

<p>When I read various code online, I have the impression everything is mutable and people generally think it's better not to bother and have less lines of code instead.</p>

<p>For instance, mutable versus immutable basic Point class: (Hopefully I'm not doing something wrong)</p>

<p>Mutable</p>

<pre><code>class Point
  constructor: (@x, @y) -&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Immutable</p>

<pre><code>class Point
  constructor: (x, y) -&gt;
    @x = -&gt; x
    @y = -&gt; y
</code></pre>

<p>Not that much more complicated but slightly weirder syntax. Another consideration is that JS is not the fastest thing known to man and having to create lots of objects in a loop just for the sake of being a purist might be counter productive, performance wise. I didn't benchmark the cost of creating new Point objects versus altering the members of one though.</p>

<p>Imagine a big app with lots of modules communicating through thin APIs. Wouldn't you want to pass immutable objects around ? Or do you perform defensive copies instead ?</p>

<p>Note: I am not trying to try and bend CS to the languages I know; Rather I want to know if it makes sense to reuse some of the concepts taken for granted in other languages. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

data = [random.randint(20, 100) for x in range(len(dates))]                           
ts = pandas.Series(data, index=dates)

<p>Now I find that the class of <code>a</code> and the class of <code>b</code> are different; <code>b</code> is a <code>pandas.core.series.Series</code> object and therefore you can not apply the method <code>append2</code> to it.</p>

<p>I would like <code>b</code> to conserve the <code>append2</code> method (conserve the same class as <code>a</code>). Is that possible? Is there any other way to add methods to the Series class without modifying the source code of the Pandas package?</p>

<p>as you can see towards the bottom the pattern normalizes and it either reads ~10 seconds (which is right, because thats what the interval is set to and compared against the system clock) </p>

<p>and 20... which...i don't know where it comes from. </p>

<p>I guess my question is ""Why isn't it reading 10 seconds all the time; why does it double the NStimer value?""</p>

<p>I've moved that business-related logic out of Controllers into Services, the workflow is rather simple. </p>

<ul>
<li>The service sends a work request and persist a WorkRequest instance in the database</li>
<li>upon receiving the request, the Worker (another grails app with the same RabbiMQ plumbing) starts performing it and, upon completion (error or not), sends another message acknowledging the work, carrying some info about the job (location where the output can be downloaded, the worker application provides access to those result through a REST API)</li>
<li>upon receiving acknowledgment, the service class recovers (get()) the original request record (carried all around inside the AMQP messages) and updates it with the information it has just received</li>
</ul>

<p>This worked just fine for big batches of requests (in the 1000s) that take a good amount of time to process, but i recently implemented a way to post an individual request for processing, and the last stage, updating the WorkRequest instance NEVER work. The original record is never persisted !</p>

<p>I've been looking at eventual problems in the transaction configuration, tried many different combinations of save(flush:true), @Transactional, etc... to no avail </p>

<p>The current Service code looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>@Transactional(readOnly = false)
def work(BusinessData data) {
    // record that a work request was posted
    // we might want to monitor that table for long lasting requests
    // staying 'pending'
    WorkRequest wr

    wr = new WorkRequest ()

    if (!w.validate()) {
        thrown new IllegalArgumentException(""WorkRequest $wr doesn't validate ?"")
    }

    c.save(failOnError: true)

    def message = [
        wr: wr.id,
        // info from data
        ...
    ] as JSON

    def key = ""wr.${route}""

    new RabbitMessageBuilder().send() {
        exchange = 'amq.topic'
        routingKey = key
        body = message.toString()
    }

}

// ...
def work = { list -&gt; 
    withPool(20) {
        list.eachParallel { bd -&gt;
            work(bd)
        }
    }
}
// ...
@Transactional
def acknowledge(Map message) {
    validateAckMessage(message) // check message integrity
    def wr = message.wr
    WorkRequest c

    def loopTimes = 10
    // sometimes, messages flow too fast for the persistence layer
    // to persist the crawl we've just saved :(
    // so we loop for a while, trying to get that damn record...
    while(!c) {
        loopTimes --
        c = WorkRequest.get(wr)
        if (c || loopTimes == 0) {
            break;
        } else {
            log.debug ""Sleeping for 500ms while we let the persistence layer persist the damn crawl !""
            Thread.sleep(500)
        }
    }

    def serverName = message.server
    def server = WorkServer.getByName(serverName)
    if (!server) {
       server = new WorkServer(name: serverName)
       server.save()
    }
    c.server = server
    c.save()
}
</code></pre>

<p>If i call <code>work()</code> from the Controller, the WorkRequest <code>wr</code> never gets persisted, <code>acknowledge()</code> loops trying to get that record, gives up, then the message is retried (AMQP retry)... while the <code>work</code> closure that loops over a list from that same Controller will work perfectly !</p>

<p>I don't get it. I really think i missed something in the transaction setup... as the initial recorde creation is performed from a controller, while the acknowledgement is performed inside a separate thread, maybe the transaction isolation logic doesn't work ? </p>

<p>And here is the WorkRequest domain class:</p>

<pre><code>class WorkRequest {
    UUID id
    Date dateCreated
    Date lastUpdated

    // part of the acknowledgement logic, this gets filled 
    // when a worker ack. this request
    WorkServer server

    static constraints = {
        server   nullable:true
    }

    static mapping = {
        id generator: 'uuid2',sqlType:'BINARY(16)'
        lastUpdated column:'updated_at'
        dateCreated column:'created_at'
    }

    String toString() {
        return ""${id.toString()}[${lastUpdated}]""
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea ? Thanks in advance :) (Yes, i use UUIDs stored as binary for that project, and i have an <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27669529/grails-custom-gorm-dialect-prevent-grails-shell-to-work-classpath-mystery"">un-related problem</a> with this too...)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just added this before the direct call from the Controller... and... it works now ! My problem is solved but that could be less ""black magic"" to me if I'd understand why, and i can smell that code from 10 miles :)</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I've devided the big batch of code into 3 section for your ease, A, B and C.
Simply said:
Section A gets 7 images.
Section B combines the 7 images into 1 bigger image.
Section C saves the image to the desktop.</p>

<p>I'm very pleased with that already. But, I'm sure Users would like to be able to Select a specific location to save this 1 bigger image at, at least I would.</p>

<p>Now, the solution I'm trying to find is either a Control that can Save the 1 bigger image to a user chosen location, that could replace Section C.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>A Control that selects a specific location and is able to give back a Path to which I can save the 1 bigger image, replacing only a single argument of Section C.</p>

<p>I've tried an array of many different things, that turned out ineffective or failed at first attempt. Such as the FileDialog system (which is unavailable in asp.net), and the FileUpload Control, which only uploads a file to the programm and not the other way around.</p>

<p>Note how one could try to get a Path from the FileUpload control and try to create an illusion to the User that he's saving the file. But, one does not simply insert the FileName editing (before saving, like in any normal case) into the FileUpload control, neither can you actually select a Directory, you'd have to Select a File and cut off the FileName in the Path, resulting in a Confusing experience for the User.</p>

<p>I've spend around 17 hours trying to find a solution, but I've failed.
Could you help me?</p>

<p>I would like to catch with a trigger any information that is being inserted to Match table then run a query to get relative info from MatchInfo table and iterate through the query results.
Upon going through row by row, deciding what will be the update to the Players table subsequently.</p>

<p>What I thought to do is -</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a trigger that will catch insert operations to match table after the info is inserted.</p></li>
<li><p>In that trigger, run the query on the relative MatchInfo table and then go through each row of the query result and update the Players table accordingly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Appreciate any help with a trigger example that will do the above.</p>

<p>Edit: by Barmars request, I edited the table to the original layout with some original information for better understanding.</p>

<p>The aos_playerslist is updating with the following trigger:</p>

<pre><code>DELIMITER $$

USE `mytable`$$

DROP TRIGGER /*!50032 IF EXISTS */ `UpdatePlayersList`$$

CREATE
    /*!50017 DEFINER = 'admin'@'%' */
    TRIGGER `UpdatePlayersList` BEFORE INSERT ON `aos_matchs` 
    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN  
INSERT IGNORE INTO `aos_playerslist` (`name`,`ace_factor`) VALUES (new.initplayer,1);
END;
$$

DELIMITER ;
</code></pre>

<p>Next I would like to update the ace_factor in the aos_playerslist table whenever a new match is inserted into the aos_matchs table, when that happens, I'm trying to get a trigger working that will update by the following query results -</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.initPlayer,t1.percentage/t2.full_percentage AS 'kill_percent'
            FROM (
                SELECT aos_matchs.MatchID,aos_matchs.`initPlayer`,SUM(CASE aos_matchs.Weapon
                WHEN 'GUNS' THEN aos_matchs.hitcount
                ELSE 70
                END) AS 'percentage',dtable.dead
                FROM aos_matchs
                LEFT JOIN (
                    SELECT MatchID,initPlayer AS dead
                    FROM aos_matchs
                    WHERE `event`='dead') dTable
                ON dTable.MatchID=aos_matchs.`MatchID` AND dTable.dead=aos_matchs.targPlayer
                WHERE aos_matchs.`Event`='hit' 
                AND dTable.dead IS NOT NULL
                GROUP BY aos_matchs.`MatchID`,aos_matchs.`initPlayer`,dtable.dead) t1
            LEFT JOIN (
                SELECT aos_matchs.MatchID,SUM(CASE aos_matchs.Weapon
                WHEN 'GUNS' THEN aos_matchs.hitcount
                ELSE 70
                END) AS 'full_percentage',dtable.dead
                FROM aos_matchs
                LEFT JOIN (
                    SELECT MatchID,initPlayer AS dead
                    FROM aos_matchs
                    WHERE `event`='dead') dTable
                ON dTable.MatchID=aos_matchs.`MatchID` AND dTable.dead=aos_matchs.targPlayer
                WHERE aos_matchs.`Event`='hit' 
                AND dTable.dead IS NOT NULL
                GROUP BY aos_matchs.`MatchID`,dtable.dead) t2
            ON t1.MatchID=t2.MatchID 
            AND t1.dead=t2.dead
            WHERE t1.MatchID = &lt;matchID&gt;
            AND t1.dead = &lt;the tested dead player&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, by the dead tested player and the kill percentage of the killer, it will update the ace_factor column by these rules -</p>

<pre><code>if ace_factor1==ace_factor2 then
{
    if player_1 wins
    {
        new_acefactor1=ace_factor1+(ace_factor1/(ace_factor1+ace_factor2));
        new_acefactor2=ace_factor2-(ace_factor1/(ace_factor1+ace_factor2));
    }
    else if player_2 wins
    {
        new_acefactor1=ace_factor1-(ace_factor1/(ace_factor1+ace_factor2));
        new_acefactor2=ace_factor2+(ace_factor1/(ace_factor1+ace_factor2));
    }
}

else if ace_factor1&gt;ace_factor2 then
{
/*Case 2a: the stronger player (player 1) wins the weaker (player 2)
/* then the change in the ace factor of the two opponents is determined by the ace factor of 
/*the weaker player
    if player_1 wins then
    {
        new_acefactor1=ace_factor1+(ace_factor2/(ace_factor1+ace_factor2));
        /*if the ace factor of player 2 (loser) equals ""1"" then it remains ""1"" (no 
        /*reduction)
        if ace_factor2==1 then 
        new_acefactor2=ace_factor2;
        else 
        /* if ace factor of player 2 is greater than ""1"" then it is reduced
        new_acefactor2=ace_factor2-(ace_factor2/(ace_factor1+ace_factor2));
    }


    /* Case 2b: the weaker player (player 2) wins the stronger player (player 1)

    else 
    {
    /* in that case the new ace factor of the weaker player (winner) is determined 
    /*(increased) by the value of the ace factor of his (stronger) opponent (loser)
        new_acefactor2=ace_factor2+(ace_factor1/(ace_factor1+ace_factor2));

    /* in that case the new ace factor of the stronger player (loser) is determined 
    /*(reduced) by the DIFFERENCE between the two ace factors 
    new_acefactor1=ace_factor1-((ace_factor1-ace_factor2)/(ace_factor1+ace_factor2));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this is clear enough, I'm just looking for a trigger that will fetch the query results for each dead player and allow the update of the ace_factor column correctly according to the above rules.</p>

<p>I can of course evaluate them with evalf but not all at once. I'm looking for a clean way receive the solutions of the equation in numerical form. I've made a workaround function for now. If there's a better way, I'd really like to know. My function to print answers is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def printeqsolve(input):
        for i in input:
                for j in i:
                        print ""%r:"" %j, i[j].evalf(chop=True)
                print ""---""

<p>Now, I run into a problem when a <strong>Windows-using colleague needs to run the same tests locally</strong> with Selenium IDE. An absolute Windows path like <code>C:\screenshot-1.png</code> would work on his machine, but not on the build server, of course.</p>

<p>We've tried using a simple relative path, e.g. <code>screenshot-1.png</code> or <code>./screenshot-1.png</code>, but that fails with a nasty error message in Selenium IDE:</p>

<pre><code>[error] Unexpected Exception: message -&gt; Component returned failure code: 0x80520001

<p>The angularjs project was an application in IIS and the application that provided data was another application in IIS</p>

As there were not many reviews, I am unsure of the standing and support of this template or if creating a MVC4 web api project and including the angular view and controller into it is good. </p>

<p>There were a few articles that stated not to mix the 2 together due to some issues with Razor, from a 50k height, this seems like a good idea as there is only 1 URL </p>

The problem is, the binding's MultiConverter receives <code>DependencyProperty.UnsetValue</code> for each item in its <code>values</code> array.</p>

<p>The following works, using a single <code>Binding</code>:</p>



<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;ToolTipService.ToolTip&gt;
  &lt;StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock.Text&gt;

      &lt;/TextBlock.Text&gt;
    &lt;/TextBlock&gt;        
  &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
&lt;/ToolTipService.ToolTip&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And so does this, using a <code>MultiBinding</code> with <code>StringFormat</code>:</p>



<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;ToolTipService.ToolTip&gt;
  &lt;StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock.Text&gt;
        &lt;MultiBinding StringFormat='{0:C} in {1}'&gt;
          &lt;Binding Path=""Amt""/&gt;
          &lt;Binding Path=""Currency""/&gt;
        &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;
      &lt;/TextBlock.Text&gt;
    &lt;/TextBlock&gt;        
  &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
&lt;/ToolTipService.ToolTip&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But a <code>MultiBinding</code> with a <code>Converter</code> does not:</strong></p>



<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;ToolTipService.ToolTip&gt;
  &lt;StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock.Text&gt;
        &lt;MultiBinding Converter=""{StaticResource multiValueConverter}""&gt;
          &lt;Binding Path=""Amt""/&gt;
          &lt;Binding Path=""Currency""/&gt;
        &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;
      &lt;/TextBlock.Text&gt;
    &lt;/TextBlock&gt;        
  &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
&lt;/ToolTipService.ToolTip&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The bindings in the last example don't receive any value. This isn't the case outside of a ToolTip - what is going on such that binding fails in this specific case?</p>

<p>When exporting data as JSON from our PHP backend we include an extra field in which we put the type the object had before exporting. We can use this to handle different subclasses of the resource we requested.</p>

<p>However sometimes we would also like to differentiate on parent classes. Consider the following scenario:</p>

<p>Inheritance tree:</p>

<pre><code>Animal
    Mammal
        Human
        Dog
        ...
    Reptile
        Crocodile
        Snake
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>GET /animals/</p>

<pre><code>[
    {""_type"": ""Human"", ""id"": 1, ""food"": ""Ice Cream""},
    {""_type"": ""Human"", ""id"": 2, ""food"": ""Steak""},
    {""_type"": ""Human"", ""id"": 3, ""food"": ""Peanut Butter""},
    {""_type"": ""Dog"", ""id"": 4, ""food"": ""Horse Poop""}
    {""_type"": ""Crocodile"", ""id"": 5, ""food"": ""Humans""}
]
</code></pre>

<p>When I have a certain piece of UI in which I would like to display all the animals but for instance highlight all the mammals I have a problem because I have lost the knowledge which animals are mammals.</p>

<p>The easiest solution we have come up with is to include the inheritance chain when exporting the objects from our backend. Possibly like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""_type"": ""Human"",
    ""id"": 10,
    ""food"": ""Ice Cream"",
    ""_parentClasses"": ""Animal.Mammal.Human""
}
</code></pre>

<p>While I don't consider this a particularly nice solution it is easy to implement and use and seems robust.</p>

<p>Do you think this is a good/ok/bad idea and how have you tackled this problem?</p>

<p>On the server, the applications are structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>LEGACY (.NET 2.0 forms app)--
                            |--Api (new MVC 4 WebAPI)
                            |--V2 (new MVC 4)
</code></pre>

<p>So a call to <code>foo</code> page on legacy is <code>/foo.aspx</code> and on V2 it's <code>/V2/foo</code>.</p>

<p>Everything is in C#, but please note that <strong>the legacy app is running on .NET 2.0 and the V2 app is running on .NET 4.5</strong>.  I am not sure if this matters, but thought it would be important to note.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>I can not successfully share the user/authentication state between applications.  Obviously, if the user logged in on the legacy app, I need to grab their auth cookie (or take similar action) on the V2 app when a V2 page is called up so that the user does not get prompted again to log in.</p>

<h1>What I have tried</h1>

<p>I have set identical <code>authentication</code> and <code>machinekey</code> elements in both web.config files:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;authentication mode=""Forms""&gt;
      &lt;forms cookieless=""UseCookies"" defaultUrl=""~/someUrl"" loginUrl=""/"" path=""/"" protection=""All"" timeout=""240""  enableCrossAppRedirects =""true"" domain=""someDomain.com"" requireSSL=""false""  /&gt;
  &lt;/authentication&gt;
  &lt;machineKey validationKey=""DE78CF63226. . .788658D142AB881"" decryptionKey=""0B97E8BA4C4EB4B4C524. . .54E4622E14168D2D5C84461FA2"" validation=""SHA1"" decryption=""AES"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried this code in the Global.asax of the V2 application:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    string cookieName = FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName;
    HttpCookie authCookie = Context.Request.Cookies[cookieName];

    if (authCookie == null)
    {
        return;
    }
    FormsAuthenticationTicket authTicket = null;
    try
    {
        authTicket = FormsAuthentication.Decrypt(authCookie.Value);
    }
    catch
    {
        return;
    }
    if (authTicket == null)
    {
        return;
    }
    string[] roles = authTicket.UserData.Split(new char[] { '|' });
    var id = new FormsIdentity(authTicket);
    var principal = new GenericPrincipal(id, roles);

    //Thread.CurrentPrincipal = principal;

    Context.User = principal;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But I have no idea whether or not it works</strong> because the legacy app is not in the same solution as my V2 app and therefore when I debug the V2 app, I don't have a way to log in via the Legacy app and simulate the actual user experience of hopping between legacy and V2.</p>

<p>I have also just tried adding this to my <code>HomeController</code> in hopes that the identical machine keys would work some magic for me:</p>

<pre><code> ViewBag.UserName = User.Identity.Name;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, I then bind <code>ViewBag.UserName</code> to an html element in the view, but this doesn't seem to work either.</p>

<p>Thats the default code from <a href=""http://php.net/manual/de/function.sqlsrv-connect.php"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP.net</a>. You could also add a UID and a PWD to the $connectionInfo-Array, and PHP would use that credentials, but as SQL Authentication, not as Windows Authentication.</p>

<p>If you don't set any credentials, PHP uses the credentials, which have started the php-script (so my local user). </p>

<p>By begin of my PHP-Script, it connects to another SQL-DB and get the credentials, which should be used to connect to the MSSQL-Servers.</p>

<p>So my question - how can I use Windows Authentication with credentials as variables? Or could i start another php-process from the mainscript using that credentials, which are given by the other SQL-DB? So the Windows Authentication would use that credentials.</p>

<p>I've currently got my data in a matrix with row groups Department-->Employee-->Client with 1 column group of ""time sheet ending date"". When I toggle the visibility of the client row group based on the employee row group, I get the correct totals at the client and the employee level. However, when I toggle the visibility of the employee row group based on the department row group, the department row group has the wrong totals. For example, if Department A has employee B with 90% utilization and employee C with 95% utilization, the toggled total at the department level is 185%....However, I am expecting to see 92.5%....any ideas????</p>

What I am doing is that when the user clicks the submit button an ajax request is being executed to target php script which logs in the user and if user is logged in successfully then <code>echo's</code> back the message ""login_successful"" to the ajax request. By using <code>if</code> statement I check whether the message is ""login_successful"" <code>else</code> display the error.</p>

<p>If the message is ""login_successful"" the script redirect the user to the new page 'user.php' by using <code>window.location = 'user.php';
//I have also tried this.
window.location.href = 'user.php';</code></p>

<p>But it doesn't work It simply stays on the login page and nothing happens.
but when i check the page source after logging in but no redirection takes place then i got a surprise that the source of the page is for user.php instead of login.php. Somehow <code>window.location</code> hasn't redirected the page but bring the source of user.php to login.php. It's all messed up and I couldn't solve the problem.</p>

<p>Here is the login function which performs the ajax request and then redirect the user-</p>

<pre><code>function login()
{
    var e = _(""email"").value;// Grab the email input by the user.
    var p = _(""password"").value;// Grab the password input by the user.
    if(e === """" || p === """")// Check if they are empty.
    {
        _(""status"").innerHTML = ""Fill out all the form data"";//Display error message if fields are empty.
    }
    else
    {
        _(""loginbtn"").style.display = ""none"";// Hide the login button
        _(""status"").innerHTML = 'please wait ...';//Tell the user to wait while the script works.
        // Below id another function which is defined in other js file.
        var ajax = ajaxObj(""POST"", ""login.php""); //start the ajax request.
        ajax.onreadystatechange = function()// Wait for the request to be complete
        {
            if(ajaxReturn(ajax) === true) // Ensures if the response is recieved
            {
                var response = ajax.responseText;// Put the response in a variable
                if(response === 'login_successful')// Check if user is logged in succesfully.
                {
                    window.location = 'user.php';//Redirect the user to the new page.(Not working)
                }
                else
                {
                    _('status').innerHTML = response;// Display the response

<p>After reading many posts on forums, I found this:</p>

<pre><code>$accountKey = '#########';
$api =  'https://api.datamarket.azure.com/Bing/Search/Web?$format=json&amp;$top=8&amp;Query=';
$context = stream_context_create(array(
    'http' =&gt; array(
        'request_fulluri' =&gt; true,
        'header'  =&gt; ""Authorization: Basic "" . base64_encode($accountKey . "":"" . $accountKey)
    )
));
$request = $api.'%27'.$q.'%27&amp;$skip='.$start;
$result = file_get_contents($request, 0, $context);
</code></pre>

<p>However, I still get the error ""The authorization type you provided is not supported. Only Basic and OAuth are supported"".</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can fix this. I have also tried cURL and that doesn't work.
Thanks to anyone who can find me a solution.</p>

When the user taps a TextBox on the lower half of the screen to enter a value, the screen usually scrolls up so that the on-screen keyboard doesn't cover up the focused TextBox.  However, in my app this only happens about 50% of the time.  The other 50%, the keyboard still comes up but the screen doesn't scroll up and the focused TextBox gets covered by the on-screen keyboard.</p>

<p>Since it doesn't always happen and I can't reliably make the problem happen or prevent it, I'm guessing that there's some kind of race condition occurring between 2 threads involving updating the layout or something.  Just a guess.</p>

<p>Is there a method I should be calling in the TextBoxes' GotFocus events to ensure that the auto-scrolling when focusing on a TextBox will work?  Maybe something similar to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14795865/scrolling-is-disabled-limited-when-keyboard-is-popped-up-in-windows-phone-7-5"">this other question</a>'s answer?</p>

<p>The application invokes a query for which form-based authentication is required.<br>
Device authentication and worklight authentication as well are used in application.</p>

<p>When invoking the query, the app will call the worklight server using web service and pass the login page html as the response - <em>This is not working in Android device</em> since the response is not reaching the app and the app gets hung after a timeout without being able to redirect to the login page.</p>

<p>We are using Server level authentication where the WebSphere is integrated with LDAP.
The User authentication happens successfully with LDAP and the session gets authenticated. The resources are secured with predefined Worklight security tests for XSRF, Remote Disable etc.  </p>

<p>Also the resources are secured with Device Auto Provisioning and Application Authentication. Once the user gets authenticated with LDAP, the device authentication fails and the application hangs</p>

<p>The same application is working fine in iOS. </p>

<ol>
<li>Pass the <code>Camera</code> preview data to a <code>MediaCodec</code> encoder via a <code>Surface</code>.  I can create the <code>Surface</code> using <code>MediaCodec.createInputSurface()</code> but the <code>Camera.setPreviewDisplay()</code> takes a <code>SurfaceHolder</code>, not a <code>Surface</code>.  </li>
<li>In addition to passing the <code>Camera</code> preview data to the encoder, I'd also like to display the preview on-screen (so the user can actually see what they are encoding).  If the encoder wasn't involved then I'd use a <code>SurfaceView</code>, but that doesn't appear to work in this scenario since <code>SurfaceView</code> creates its own <code>Surface</code> and I think I need to use the one created by <code>MediaCodec</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've searched online quite a bit for a solution and haven't found one.  Some examples on <a href=""http://bigflake.com/mediacodec/"">bigflake.com</a> seem like a step in the right direction but they take an approach that adds a bunch of EGL/SurfaceTexture overhead that I'd like to avoid.  I'm hoping there is a simpler example or solution where I can get the <code>Camera</code> and <code>MediaCodec</code> talking more directly without involving EGL or textures.</p>

I then split the resulting string in half, and send each half to its own process through fork(). Each child process uses execl() to run the second program (""bit_count.c""). </p>

<p>Within bit_count.c, it:
  a) checks if the length of the (half)string is 2 or less. If yes, it returns the number of<br>
1's and 0's to it's parent process.
  b) if not, it begins to recursively split the string in half, and sending each half to its own new process (replicating the procedure in root.c). This creates a binary process tree, until all pieces of the string are 2 characters long or less. 
  c) the count results of the left and right children are aggregated by the parent, and returned to its parent, until returning to the root process, which aggregates the highest two children, and outputs it to the user. </p>

<p>My problem with this project is returning the 2-character counts to the parent. My idea right now is to direct the parent's left and right read pipes to stdin with dup2(), and just to print to stdout with fprintf from the children. The select() function of the parent should catch the returning output, right? </p>

<p>My second problem is the format of the output. if the counts are in ints, what is the best way to return that using select() in this case? I've attached my code below, just be warned that it may be a mess - I'm rusty with C code and this is my first exposure to select() and execl().</p>

<p>I am trying to determine the maximum amount of the smaller rectangles I can fit into the bigger rectangle. The smaller rectangles <strong>can</strong> be rotated. I also don't care about a slightly empty gap at the top right corner.</p>

<p>So far I have come up with:</p>

<pre><code>// +-------------+ We have 3 potential sections to fill with rects. The
// |      C      | inital calculation is for section A. If A doesn't
// +-------+-----+ consume the entire area then we then try and fill the

// |   A   |  B  |
// |       |     |
// +-------+-----+
//
int numWidthA = (int)Math.floor(width / rect[0]);
int numLengthA = (int)Math.floor(length / rect[1]);
int numWidthB = 0;
int numLengthB = 0;
int numWidthC = 0;
int numLengthC = 0;

double remainingWidth = width - (numWidthA * rect[0]);
double remainingLength = length - (numLengthA * rect[1]);

if(remainingWidth != 0) {
    double usedLength = numLengthA * rect[1];

    numWidthB = (int)Math.floor(remainingWidth / rect[1]);
    numLengthB = (int)Math.floor(usedLength / rect[0]);
}

if(remainingLength != 0) {
    numWidthC = (int)Math.floor(width / rect[1]);
    numLengthC = (int)Math.floor(remainingLength / rect[0]);
}

System.out.printf(""Rotation: %.1f x %.1f%n"", rect[0], rect[1]);
System.out.printf(""A: %d x %d%n"", numWidthA, numLengthA);
System.out.printf(""B: %d x %d%n"", numWidthB, numLengthB);
System.out.printf(""C: %d x %d%n"", numWidthC, numLengthC);

return (numWidthA * numLengthA) + (numWidthB * numLengthB) +
       (numWidthC * numLengthC);
</code></pre>

<p>This fails if the initial section, section A, is too greedy. It keeps consuming too much space such that there's not enough room for the alternate rotation in another section. I.e it leaves room for H/2 instead of H. If it uses all the room available, no problem, it's when it uses almost all the room.</p>

<p>I tried to recursively remove a rectangle until there was enough room for a multiple of the alternate rotation but I was having trouble due to double precision errors. So I was hoping there was an alternate solution?</p>

<p>I also didn't like that solution due to it taking the algorithm from O(1) to O(n)</p>

<p>Another problem is determining the initial rotation of the rectangle, at the moment I see which rotation consumes the most area and use that rotation for the section A.</p>

<p>What I want to achieve is a text field to display currency. It should format itself on the fly, while handling wrong input. I got that working, but my problem is that I want to store the non-formatted value in my scope variable. The issue with input is that it requires a model which goes both ways, so changing the input field updates the model, and the other way around.</p>

<p>I came upon <code>$parsers</code> and <code>$formatters</code> which appears to be what I am looking for. Unfortunately they are not affecting each other (which might actually be good to avoid endless loops).</p>

<p>I've created a simple jsFiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/cruckie/yE8Yj/"">http://jsfiddle.net/cruckie/yE8Yj/</a> and the code is as follows:</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div data-ng-app=""app"" data-ng-controller=""Ctrl""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" data-currency="""" data-ng-model=""data"" /&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Model: {{data}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JS:</p>

<pre><code>var app = angular.module(""app"", []);

function Ctrl($scope) {
    $scope.data = 1234567;
}

app.directive('currency', function() {
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        require: 'ngModel',
        link: function (scope, element, attr, ctrl) {

            ctrl.$formatters.push(function(modelValue) {
                return modelValue.toString().replace(/\B(?=(?:\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',');
            });

            ctrl.$parsers.push(function(viewValue) {
                return parseFloat(viewValue.replace(new RegExp("","", ""g""), ''));
            });
        }
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is just a simple example. When it loads everything looks as it's supposed to. The input field is formatted and the variable is not. However, when changing the value in the input field it no longer formats itself - the variable however gets updated correctly.</p>

<p>Is there a way to ensure the text field being formatted while the variable is not? I guess what I am looking for is a filter for text fields, but I can't seen to find anything on that.</p>

I've used multi-threading to calculate in parallel.<br>
<br>
During the phase of merge result, each thread will lock the global array, and then append individual part to it, and some extra work will be done to eliminate the repetitions.<br>
<br>
I test it and find that the cost on merging increases with the number of threads, and the rate is unexpected:<br>
<br>
2 thread: 40,116,084(us)<br>
6 thread:511,791,532(us)<br>
<br>
Why: what occurs when the number of threads increases? How do I change this?<br>

Actually, the code was very simply, there is the pseudo-code:<br>
<br>
typedef my_object{<br> 
long no;<br> 
int count;<br>
double value;<br> 
//something others <br>
} my_object_t;<br>
<br>
static my_object_t** global_result_array; //about ten thounds<br>
<br>
static pthread_mutex_t global_lock;<br>
<br>
void* thread_function(void* arg){ <br>
my_object_t** local_result;<br>
int local_result_number;<br> 
int i;<br> 
my_object_t* ptr;<br> 
for(;;){<br> 
if( exit_condition ){ return NULL;}<br> 
if( merge_condition){<br>
//start time point to log<br> 
pthread_mutex_lock( &amp;global_lock);<br> 
for( i = local_result_number-1; i>=0 ;i++){<br> 
ptr = local_result[ i] ;<br> 
if( NULL == global_result_array[ ptr->no] ){<br> 
global_result_array[ ptr->no] = ptr; //step 4 <br>
}else{ <br>
global_result_array[ ptr->no] -> count += ptr->count; // step 5 <br>
global_result_array[ ptr->no] -> value += ptr->value; // step 6 <br>
}<br> 
}<br> 
pthread_mutex_unlock( &amp;global_lock); // end time point to log <br>
}else{ <br>
//do some calculation and produce the partly and thread-local result ,namely the local_result and local_result_number <br>
}<br> 
}<br> 
}<br></p>

<p><br>
As above, the difference between two threads and six threads are step 5 and step6, i has counted that there were about hundreds millions order of execution of step 5 and 6. The others are same.<br>
So, from my view, the merge operation was very light, in spite of using 2 thread or 6 thread, they both need to lock and do merge exclusively.<br>
Another astonished thing was : when using six thread, the cost on step 4 was boomed! It was the boot reason that the total cost was boomed!<br>
<br>
btw: The test server has two cpus ,each cpu has four cores.<br></p>

<p>It runs on an isolated LAN so C2DM isn't feasible and polling every second seems rather traffic heavy (especially if there are 1000 devices later).  Are there any recommendations on how to move from polling to pushing or at least making this scalable?</p>

Here is my main class where i am calling a function which has kinvey client call to fetch data.</p>

<pre><code>    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

     // here is the function that fetch my data from kinvey
     GetAllCategory();

    imageUrls=urls // this is the assignment that cause Null pointer Exception

    }

<p>now here is my GetAllCategories function</p>

<pre><code>        public void GetAllCategory(){
       AsyncAppData&lt;EntityCategories&gt; myEvents=mKinveyClient.appData(""categories"",  EntityCategories.class);                                      
       myEvents.get(new Query(), new KinveyListCallback&lt;EntityCategories&gt;(){
       @Override
        public void onFailure(Throwable error) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            Log.e(TAG, ""failed to save event data"", error);
        }

        @Override

        }

        }


    });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>but control goes back to oncreate method just after executing kinvey call and don't go to the onSuccess method. After executing whole oncreate method it come back to onSuccess. but till then app got crash due to NUll pointer exception.</p>

<p>I have a playlist application.  Each playlist has a title and a list of keywords that signify the songs to include.</p>

<p>So, I may have this as one row, where there are three keywords.
Exercise       steady-beat_country hard_rock classic_rock</p>

<p>If I add a new song that has one of these keywords applied to it, I want it to be pulled up when I select this playlist.</p>

<p>I could just go through all the playlists that have this keyword and relate the new song with the playlist, but that seems to be very inefficient, if I have several users each with many playlists, if the song can be played by all the users.</p>

<p>I am curious if I should just do this in my <code>@Entity</code> model, which is written in <code>Scala</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@transient
var songs : java.util.List[Song] = new java.util.ArrayList[Song]()

@OneToMany{val cascade=Array(CascadeType.ALL), val mappedBy=""playlist""}
var keywords : java.util.List[Snippet] = new java.util.ArrayList[Snippet]()
</code></pre>

<p>Then I could just load the keywords that are actually related to the playlist and then call a named query that can load up the songs by a list of keywords.</p>

<p>Or, is there a way to define something like this in JPA so I don't have to make an extra call?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Tonight I test this, but I am wondering if I could set up my named query to do this query, so it would be something like:</p>

<p><code>SELECT Playlist p, Songs s WHERE p.user = :user AND s.keywords IN (p.keywords)</code></p>

<p>This code is a bit flawed as the IN I need to look up how I can do it in JPA, I may need to store the keywords as comma-delimited, but I am not certain yet how I can have the songs fill in the <code>song</code> property for <code>playlist</code>.</p>

<p>Basically I have 1 main <code>viewModel</code> and multiple <code>subModels</code> that all pull JSON data from different URLs and then i map them with <code>ko.mapping</code> plugin. In addition to that I have implemented <code>isDrity</code> on each <code>subModel</code> using Ryan Niemeyer's examples, plus some additional functions to save, reset and clear <code>isDirty</code> flag on the object properties. So, this results in repeating code in each <code>subModel</code> and I would like to have it cleaned up. </p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried using <code>ko.utils.extend</code>, but that does not seem to be working with <code>subModels</code> created by <code>ko.mapping</code> plugin because the resulting <code>subModel</code> is just an array of my JSON data from the server. </p>

<pre><code>var sharedFunctions = function() {

    sharedFunction1 = function() {
        console.log('Hello, world!');
    }

}

ko.utils.extend(mappedModel1, sharedFunctions);
viewModel.subModel1(mappedModel1)
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried using some sort of <code>baseViewModel</code> moving repeating code in there and then inheriting its properties into the <code>subModels</code>, but that does not seem to work with <code>ko.computed()</code>, because they only fire up once when I initialize the <code>subModel</code> and don't update after that. </p>

<p>Also, the way my code is structured, I am forced to do <code>allDirtyItems1</code>, <code>allDirtyItems2</code>, <code>allDirtyItems3</code>, etc. Instead of just having the same <code>allDirtyItems</code> property in each <code>subModel</code> </p>

<p>What I need to do is alter where the files are stored and loaded from so that the site can scale correctly. It also means I can use the cache provided by Cloudfront for the attachments.</p>

Although I'm not too familiar with modern web frameworks I have kind of settled on ASP.NET MVC5 as Microsoft stack is my comfort zone. </p>

<p>Some further points : this legacy app currently communicates with real hardware via traditional windows service. UI -> Service -> h/w custom remoting pattern using tcp telegrams...this is also something I'd like to modernize with web services or WCF...but I don't know much about either of these.<br>
Basically given my lack of experience in things like WCF, web services in general I'm a bit confused on what are the best replacements for the remoting are i.e. How will my new MVC Model/Controller communicate with my exisitng WPF hardware driver class. Is this what WCF is meant for?</p>

<p>Lastly would it be better to start with a new MVC Solution and then add to this my legacy classes as references? Or vice-versa where I add MVC project to the existing solution?</p>

<p>I think in this case directly comparing will be quicker, as we only do one comparison, so the cost of hashing will be greater than saving of time spent on comparison. However, I'm not sure this reasoning is sound (which is why I'm asking). I can see that hashing comes into its own if you're doing multiple comparisons for each image but in this case I'm not.</p>

The problem is that at the third run, the script stops and returns:

It uses a Split View Controller for tablets which in Android lingo allows you to present two Activities side by side simultaneously (Edit: Android only allows one Activity on screen as mentioned by @commonsware below.  The next best thing is to use fragments, but the Action Bar can only exist at the Activity level, meaning it will have to expand the entire width of the screen.  It wonder if a Split Activity Controller will be coming to the Android Platform.)</p>

<p>The tablet landscape layout has a fixed left pane for statistics that never changes.  The right hand pane functions just like the phone version of the app.  Transitions occur exclusively on the right hand pane.  i.e. the whole screen doesn't slide when changing activities, only the right pane.  How would you recommend implementing this in Android?  </p>

<p>Should I use a single activity and manually perform transitions between fragments in the right panel?  This app has 25 screens and will have an alternate layout for phones, so I'm trying to plan ahead and do this right the first time :)  Thanks for your help!</p>

"8668994","1","8669092","","2011-12-29 14:22:46","","2","740","<p>In Bjarne Stroustrup's book ""The C++ Programming Language"", it is stated that a derived class from a super class in a class hierarchy, in many case, gets access to the data of the super class. The book suggests this is a problem, because the sharing between ""<em>two related, but different, sets of data is asking for trouble. Sooner or later someone will get them out of sync. Also, experience shows that novice programmers tend to mess with protected data in ways that are unnecessary and that cause maintenance problems</em>"". The question here is, <strong>how can having access to private data from the ancestor class is asking for trouble?</strong> It sounds like having inherited assets from your parent is a bad deal.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the pure abstract class mechanism allows the separation between the abstract class and its implementation. Note that the implementation includes data members, because if the data members are defined in an abstract class, the abstract class contains implementation details (the defined members), thus it is not well decoupled between abstraction and the implementation. Why is such separation needed? One of the reason, as stated in <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C++_Programming/Classes/Abstract_Classes/Pure_Abstract_Classes"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, is ""<em>a way of forcing a contract between the class designer and the users of that class. The users of this class must declare a matching member function for the class to compile.</em>"" Another important reason, as stated in the book, is to protect against changes from the implementation. Having an abstract class hierarchy, you can protect against the changes which requires compilation of an entire class hierarchy. </p>

<p>For example, if you have a normal class, and the class contains 10 data members and 20 member functions, and is inherited by a dozen of classes with several layers below the root class. A few changes to the implementation of member functions (function signature remains unchanged) of the root class, and you have to recompile the entire class hierarchy to apply changes its terminal classes, otherwise the program breaks. With abstract class hierarchy, unless the function signature is changed, if an implementation of a terminal class changes, only that terminal class needs to be recompiled. Therefore, most of the code are protected to the maximum. <strong>Is my understanding correct?</strong> </p>

<p>I think his example (the <strong>Ival_box</strong> example) in combination with the Bridge Design Pattern tries, and is powerful, since Bridge Pattern leaves the abstract tree completely, and have another class hierarchy for implementation. <strong>Pure abstract class</strong> can be consider equivalent to <strong>Interface</strong> in Java, except in Java the explanation usually is the abstract class can be inherited once, while interface allow multiple inheritances, thus having shared behaviors encapsulated in a shared interface between multiple classes. That answer, I think, is not valid in this context, since C++ allows multiple inheritance.</p>

<p>The last question is, <strong>how is a derived class compiled and exist in the binary image?</strong> Does the compiler fill the inherited information into the derived class, considered it to be an isolated class afterward and then compiled? (Similar to preprocessing)</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>How can having access to private data from the ancestor class is asking for trouble?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is pure abstract class (aka Interface in Java) a way to protect source code against changes, with the separation of abstraction tree and implementation tree?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How is abstract class/super class compiled in C++? Does it turn the derived class into a single class by filling in the information from superclass, then compiles</strong></p>

<p>Until now, I've always serialized and deserialized lists  full with mixed objects of derived classes, and the only thing I'd to do it to add the <code>[XmlInclude(typeof(child))]</code> and C# would take care of the rest.</p>

<p>This time I want to serialize/deserialize object of derived class directly rather than putting it in list. The most interesting part is that when I serialize the object while it is in list the generated xml is different from ""direct"" serialization. Furthermore - I can't deserialize the directly serlized-object to instance of it's base class item, while the list deserializes just fine (I've added an example below)</p>

<p>This the code of the sample classes:</p>

<pre><code>    [XmlInclude(typeof(child))]
    public abstract class father 
    { ... }

    public class child : father
    {
        public double Sum { get; set; }
        public char Currency { get; set; }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the init code for the examples below:</p>

<pre><code> father oD = new child() { Currency = '$', Sum = 1 };
 string xml_str = Tools.Serialize(oD);
</code></pre>

<p>The XML output is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;child xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;&lt;Sum&gt;1&lt;/Sum&gt;&lt;Currency&gt;36&lt;/Currency&gt;&lt;/child&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I put the object in a list and serialize the list, the ouput is</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ArrayOfFather xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;&lt;father xsi:type=""child""&gt;&lt;Sum&gt;1&lt;/Sum&gt;&lt;Currency&gt;36&lt;/Currency&gt;&lt;/father&gt;&lt;/ArrayOfFather&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>as you can see the XML is different: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;father xsi:type=""child""&gt;&lt;Sum&gt;1&lt;/Sum&gt;&lt;Currency&gt;36&lt;/Currency&gt;&lt;/father&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that while the following two lines work (as I am providing the child-class as deserialization target):</p>

<pre><code> child oD1 = Tools.DeSerializeGeneric&lt;child&gt;(xml_str);
 father oD2 = Tools.DeSerializeGeneric&lt;child&gt;(xml_str);
</code></pre>

<p>I can't make the third one (and the one I need) to deserialize</p>

<pre><code> father oD4 = Tools.DeSerializeGeneric&lt;father&gt;(xml_str);
</code></pre>

<p>Throws</p>

<pre><code>System.InvalidOperationException: There is an error in XML document (1, 2). ---&gt; System.InvalidOperationException: &lt;child xmlns=''&gt; was not expected.

        StringReader SsR = new StringReader(source);
        return (T) x.Deserialize(SsR);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>For example, let's say f is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; val f = (i: Int, j: Int, k: Int, l: Int) =&gt; i+j+k+l
f: (Int, Int, Int, Int) =&gt; Int = &lt;function4&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which we can of course use directly:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; f(1, 2, 3, 4)
res1: Int = 10
</code></pre>

<p>Or curry and apply the arguments one at a time:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; f.curried
res2: Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int = &lt;function1&gt;

scala&gt; f.curried.apply(1).apply(2).apply(3).apply(4)
res3: Int = 10
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance this looks like a job for <code>foldLeft</code>.</p>

<p>My first attempt at describing this sequence of <code>apply</code> using <code>foldLeft</code> looks like:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; List(1, 2, 3, 4).foldLeft(f.curried)({ (g, x) =&gt; g.apply(x) })
</code></pre>

<p>However, that yields the following error:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;console&gt;:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int
 required: Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int
              List(1, 2, 3, 4).foldLeft(f.curried)({ (g, x) =&gt; g.apply(x) })
</code></pre>

<p>My reading of the error message is that type inference would need some hint for <code>g</code>.</p>

<p>The solution I'm looking for leaves everything unmodified in my original expression except the type of <code>g</code>:</p>

<pre><code>List(1, 2, 3, 4).foldLeft(f.curried)({ (g: ANSWER, x) =&gt; g.apply(x) })
</code></pre>

<p>My first thought was that a union type would be useful here.  I've seen Miles Sabin's derivation of union types using Curry-Howard, so if that first hunch is true, then I appear to have the basic machinery required to solve the problem.</p>

<p>However: Even if union types are the answer it would be useful if I could refer to ""The union of all types from the fully curried type of a function to the type of the curried function with all but the last argument supplied"".  In other words, a way to turn the type:</p>

<pre><code>T1 =&gt; ... =&gt; Tn
</code></pre>

<p>into the union type:</p>

<pre><code>(T1 =&gt; ... =&gt; Tn) |∨| ... |∨| (Tn-1 =&gt; Tn)
</code></pre>

<p>would be useful as the type for <code>g</code> above.</p>

<p>Doing a <code>foldLeft</code> on a <code>List</code> limits the discussion to case where <code>T1</code> through <code>Tn-1</code> are all the same.  A notation like</p>

<pre><code>(T1 =&gt;)+ Tn
</code></pre>

<p>would describe the type I want to provide for <code>g</code>.</p>

<p>The specific case I'm asking about doesn't require arbitrarily long chains, so we could provide bounds on the iterator using</p>

<pre><code>(T1 =&gt;){1,4} Tn
</code></pre>

<p>Looking ahead at wanting to do this for chains of types that are not equal, though, perhaps some magical function on types that chops up the chain into the set of all suffixes is more useful:</p>

<pre><code>Suffixes(T1 =&gt; ... =&gt; Tn)
</code></pre>

<p>Implementing this is well beyond my Scala abilities at the moment.  Any hints as to how to go about doing so would be appreciated.  Whether this can be done with advanced usage of Scala's existing type system or through a compiler plugin or neither, I do not know.</p>

<p>As has been noted in the comments below, calling the result a ""union type"" is not a perfect fit for this use case.  I don't know what else to call it, but that's the closest idea I have at the moment.  Do other languages have special support for this idea?  How would this work in Coq and Agda?</p>

<p>Naming this problem and understanding where it sits with respect to the bigger picture (of type theory, decidability, and so forth) is more important to me than having a working implementation of <code>ANSWER</code>, though both would be nice.  Bonus points to anyone who can draw connections to Scalaz, Monoids, or Category Theory in general.</p>

<p>Basically what I want to achieve is to grab the frame, process it, and draw it directly to the surface of SurfacePreview.</p>

<p>here is my code of onPreviewFrame</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onPreviewFrame(byte[] data, Camera camera) {
    Canvas canvas = null;

    if (mHolder == null) {
        return;
    }

    int mImgFormat = mCamera.getParameters().getPreviewFormat();

    try {
        canvas = mHolder.lockCanvas();
        canvas.drawColor(0, android.graphics.PorterDuff.Mode.CLEAR);
        mHolder.unlockCanvasAndPost(canvas);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        if (canvas != null)
        {
            mHolder.unlockCanvasAndPost(canvas);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have read a lot of documentation and topics about camera in android, and I suppose that locking the surface that frames are drawn onto isn't possible, because it's beyond scope of the application control. Is it true?</p>

<p>One of possible solutions is to draw on top of the surface view with another view, but I want to keep my processed frames (there will be some canny edge detection and color corrections, which may be time consuming) drawn in sync with preview. When camera will keep spitting frames with good fps my calculations will have a hard time catching up, and in worst case scenario draw an overlay that is dozens of frames behind.</p>

<p>I studied openCV source and for me it looks like they've managed to do this in CameraBridgeViewBase.java:</p>

<pre><code>protected void deliverAndDrawFrame(CvCameraViewFrame frame) {
    Mat modified;

    if (mListener != null) {
        modified = mListener.onCameraFrame(frame);
    } else {
        modified = frame.rgba();
    }

    boolean bmpValid = true;
    if (modified != null) {
        try {
            Utils.matToBitmap(modified, mCacheBitmap);
        } catch(Exception e) {
            Log.e(TAG, ""Mat type: "" + modified);
            Log.e(TAG, ""Bitmap type: "" + mCacheBitmap.getWidth() + ""*"" + mCacheBitmap.getHeight());
            Log.e(TAG, ""Utils.matToBitmap() throws an exception: "" + e.getMessage());
            bmpValid = false;
        }
    }

    if (bmpValid &amp;&amp; mCacheBitmap != null) {
        Canvas canvas = getHolder().lockCanvas();
        if (canvas != null) {
            canvas.drawColor(0, android.graphics.PorterDuff.Mode.CLEAR);
            canvas.drawBitmap(mCacheBitmap, (canvas.getWidth() - mCacheBitmap.getWidth()) / 2, (canvas.getHeight() - mCacheBitmap.getHeight()) / 2, null);
            if (mFpsMeter != null) {
                mFpsMeter.measure();
                mFpsMeter.draw(canvas, 20, 30);

<p>Our website has many programs that each need an index page as well as about 5 sub-pages. These program pages will need a menu system to navigate between the different pages.I am naming the pages pagex_1, pagex_2, pagex_3, etc. where ""pagex"" is descriptive of the page content. </p>

<p>My question is, what would be the best way to handle this menu system? Is there a way to modify the initial variable used to arrive at the index page to create links in the menu to arrive at the other pages?</p>

<p>I have the following rewrite rule defined in <code>.htaccess</code> file</p>

<p><code>RewriteRule ^goto/(.*)$ goto/index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]</code></p>

<p>And it is working fine (means it is reaching index.php of goto folder). But my thought in this that it should generate a redirect loop.</p>

<p>Suppose a url is <code>http://example.com/goto/foo</code>. So in first iteration it will have <code>http://example.com/goto/index.php?q=foo</code>. In second iteration it should match rewriterule <code>goto/(.*)</code> and should have a redirect loop.</p>

<p>My question is how it avoiding the redirect loop?</p>

"25548551","1","25893844","","2014-08-28 12:12:47","","1","147","<p>I have been working over a GPS mapping application where NMEA data from a GPS (L76) development board is obtained via a serial port. The CSV data is parsed and the longitude/latitude information is then saved in a Queue. The objective is to dynamically display pushpins on a WPF-based mapping application as and when the location information is available via the serial port. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;WPF:Map Name=""XAMLMap"" ZoomLevel=""17"" CredentialsProvider=""the key"" Mode=""road"" Margin=""241,157,10.334,10""&gt;
&lt;/WPF:Map&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The application successfully displays its initial Bing Map display via the code given below:</p>

<pre><code>Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&gt;
{
    XAMLMap.CredentialsProvider = new ApplicationIdCredentialsProvider(""the key"");
    XAMLMap.Center = new Microsoft.Maps.MapControl.WPF.Location(50.8, -1.12222);

    Pushpin currentPushpin = new Pushpin();
    currentPushpin.Location = new Microsoft.Maps.MapControl.WPF.Location(50.8, -1.12222);
    XAMLMap.ZoomLevel = 18;
    XAMLMap.Margin = new Thickness(243, 151, 0, 0);
    XAMLMap.Children.Add(currentPushpin);
    mapGrid.Children.Add(XAMLMap);
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, the actual challenge appears when the push pin Location coordinates are generated dynamically from the serial data within the following event method:</p>

<pre><code>void serialPortHandler_NewSerialDataRecieved(object sender, SerialDataEventArgs e)
{
    AddLocation(currentLocation);
}

private void AddLocation(Location location)
{
    Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&gt;
    {
        try
        {                           
            Microsoft.Maps.MapControl.WPF.Location currentLocation = new Microsoft.Maps.MapControl.WPF.Location(location.latitude, location.longitude);

            Pushpin currentPushpin = new Pushpin();
            currentPushpin.Location = currentLocation;    
            XAMLMap.Margin = new Thickness(243, 151, 0, 0);                        
            XAMLMap.Children.Add(currentPushpin);
            mapGrid.Children.Add(XAMLMap);    
        }
        catch (Exception exc)
        {    
        }
    });
} 
</code></pre>

<p>The updated coordinate latitude/longitude values are still placed properly on the map (XAMLMap). However, when the map is zoomed-out/in or panned, the map content, i.e. the roads, geographical details, resolution, do not update at all i.e. newly visible map information is not updated at all leaving a jigsaw of irregular patches. </p>

<p>Also, please note that the problem has nothing to do with the way I am adding the XAMLMap object to the grid in the code above or any other children. </p>

<p>I've looked into various possibilities to resolve this issue but have been unsuccessful so far. This also includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keeping the mapping application over a separate thread</li>
<li>Using a timer control and using Peek method to return and display the top-most location object from the Queue</li>
</ol>

<p>Any help or direction in this regard would be highly appreciated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[a] copy constructor and copy assignment operator won't be generated for a class that explicitly declares a move constructor <strong>or</strong> move assignment operator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do notice (g++ 4.7.2) that if you define a move constructor, it will be used with, e.g., <code>push_back()</code>, whereas if all you do is <code>= delete</code> the copy constructor, you don't get an implicit move constructor -- you get an error.  <em>[...which leads me to wonder which one (move or copy) is actually used if you don't do anything explicitly...]</em></p>

<p>However, <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_constructor#Deleted_implicitly-declared_copy_constructor"" rel=""nofollow"">this online reference</a> does not make the same explicit promises about the copy constructor <em>not</em> being implicitly defined when you define a move constructor.</p>

<p>So my question is, is the first quote guaranteed by the standard (including the <strong>""or""</strong>)?  I would prefer, with some classes which need an explicit destructor, to complete the ""rule of five"" with just a move constructor and a (deleted) move operator and rely on the implicit copy methods <em>not</em> being defined.  If I can't rely on that, then I'll have to explicitly <code>=delete</code> them -- but that's a lot of potentially redundant stuff.</p>

<pre><code>-(void) doCancel:(id)sender {
    ANNOUNCE
    X.messageIsShowing = NO;
    CGFloat fadeOutTime = 0.4f;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:fadeOutTime animations:^{

    } completion:^(BOOL finished){

<p>It's supposed to fade out the host view and then remove it from its superview. It was working for a few weeks but now it's crashing with EXC_BAD_ACCESS on the line '[host removeFromSuperview];'. I did change lots of stuff since it worked but nothing in this method so far as I know. </p>

<p>I added log statements so now it looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>-(void) doCancel:(id)sender {
    ANNOUNCE
    X.messageIsShowing = NO;
    CGFloat fadeOutTime = 0.4f;
    CCLOG(@""host.alpha: %f"", host.alpha);

        [host removeFromSuperview];
        [host release];
    }];
}

<p>All four log statements work and print what is expected. So 'host' and host's superview are valid for the log statements. But it still crashes on [host removeFromSuperview]. I also played around with lots of breakpoints. But debug commands don't work inside the completion block -- none of the ivars are in scope, probably because the completion block is running on Thread 1 instead of 0.  Can anybody tell me what's going on here?</p>

The track ran in a loop for around 8 hours and so the resulting table contains only one record though it shows several lines in QGIS. I would like to cut the track into several records, one record per loop. So far I have employed the st_intersection &amp; st_intersects using a polygon that looks like a donut (with a gap) cutting the lines at its ends.</p>

<p>Below is the script (from <a href=""http://selectoid.wordpress.com/2008/11/14/a-look-at-st_intersects-st_overlaps-and-st_intersection/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>) I used to get the tracklines within the boundary polygon:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE test 
AS (SELECT st_intersection(brte.st_union, trk.geom_32651)
    FROM buffer35 AS brte,
        tracks_utmz51n AS trk
    WHERE st_intersects(brte.st_union, trk.geom_32651)); 

ALTER TABLE test ADD COLUMN id SERIAL;
ALTER TABLE test ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
</code></pre>

<p>Still the table shows only one record even though the lines already start and end same as the donut. Is there an explode function (like in autocad) in postgis? The solution suggested <a href=""http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/21648/explode-multilinestring-into-individual-segments-in-postgis-1-5"">here</a> explodes it into point-to-point segments.</p>

<p>I'd like to try the code below (from Lhttp://amercader.net/blog/2011/04/exploding-multigeometries-with-postgis ~returns a set of the individual geometries that make up a multi one). If mpoly is for polygons, what is it for lines so I can substitute it?:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE world_worldborders_3 AS
SELECT id,name,
(ST_Dump(mpoly)).geom
FROM world_worldborders;
</code></pre>

<p>ADDITIONAL WORKFLOW DETAILS:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a GPX track from a vehicle that ran 8 hours around a predefined route. This being a loop, the vehicle passes the same areas at different times. This was intended because I am trying to study travel time differences per hour.</p></li>
<li><p>Using OGR2OGR I import the track(as is/default settings) unto a postgis database. The result is 6 tables, of which I only keep the tracklines and the trackpoints then discard the rest. I convert this to EPSG32651 from EPSG4326</p></li>
<li><p>I initially intended to just work with the trackpoints and discard the tracklines as well, but the dilemma was, since it was in a loop, I couldn't just pick-out the points at the start and end of a road segment because there are other pairs on the same segment but at a different time interval. So maybe after 30-40 minutes, the vehicle passes then I have another start and end time at that segment.</p></li>
<li><p>I need to be able to differentiate the pairs. The trackline per loop, I thought would help since that would serve as an ID for the pairs. ex. This pair from Loop#1 and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>That's why I removed a small portion out of the route line, buffered the remaining in order to catch the tracklines then tried running the st_intersects &amp; st_intersection thinking that it would cut the trackline into the loops I needed. Unfortunately, the output was a multiline. If I click on one loop, the rest are also selected.</p></li>
<li><p>The solutions I've found so far used a pl/pgsql script. I cannot do that (I think) because this is a python class project. I'm basically running the postgis script through psycopg2 so I'm looking for a straightforward script. </p></li>
<li><p>If there's really no way to try and break-up the trackline into several tracklines (1 per loop) with postgis, I guess I'll have to use ST_MAKELINE after I have made a loop identifier(to group by) with just python like discussed in Lhttp://www.bostongis.com/postgis_makeline.snippet ..something..something..or just do everthing with just python and a list of dictionaries containing the track points information.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any ideas? Is there any other way? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>What I've done is created <code>PageViewController : UIPageViewController</code> which, in its <code>viewDidLoad</code> method, calls <code>setViewControllers</code> to add a single view controller, an instance of <code>Page11ViewController : UIViewController</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks to a helpful answer on a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27491691/my-uiview-isnt-rendering"">recent question</a>, I now know that <code>PageViewController</code> and <code>Page1ViewController</code> are being created successfully.  However, I am trying to design <code>Page1ViewController</code> in IB, and what's being rendered doesn't reflect the work I'm doing in IB.  In my storyboard, I have the following:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/uyRHn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So ""Page 1 View Controller Scene"" contains a view that contains a label (""Page 1"").  I have made ""Page 1 View Controller"" an instance of <code>Page1ViewController</code> by setting its class in the Identity Inspector for that view controller:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/BNK8d.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But when I run the app, I don't see my white view with a ""Page 1"" label; instead I see a blank red view.  Why red?  Because I did this:</p>

<pre><code>class Page1ViewController : UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet var mainView: UIView!
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor()
        println(""Page 1 loaded"")
        println(""Subviews: \(view.subviews.count)"")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I know that code is being executed, and the background is being set there...and the subview count printed out is 0...so I know that the view I'm constructing in my IB Storyboard is not the view that's actually getting drawn.</p>

<p>Here is the code from <code>PageViewController</code> that adds <code>Page1ViewController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class PageViewController : UIPageViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
        println(""Page view controller loaded"")
        let page1vc = Page1ViewController()
        setViewControllers([page1vc],
            direction: UIPageViewControllerNavigationDirection.Forward,
            animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>How do I attach the view I'm creating in IB to the code?</p>

I'm trying to generate the htpasswd hash starting with the already encrypted md5 hash. Should I write my own code to hash it 999 more times, and salt it? How do I do this?</p>

<p>This is on a Linux server with PHP 5 and MySQL.</p>

<ul>
<li>onCreate it creates and instance of an asynctask A</li>
<li>onPreExecute of A we make call: showDialog</li>
<li>in doInBackground we sleep for a while SystemClock.sleep(1000)</li>
<li>onPostExecute we dismiss the dialog then start a new Async Task B</li>
<li>Task B does mostly the same by opening a dialog waiting then closing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now when you first open the app things happen as the should: you see two Progress dialogs pop up one after the other, each for a period of time.</p>

<p>However if I rotate the screen at anytime, the next time the activity is created the <strong>progress dialogs are created but never dismissed</strong>.  which makes it impossible to use the UI. If I rotate the screen again, I get an error message about leaked views (the dialogs that dint go away). plus new dialogs are now created and also don't want to go away (be dismissed).</p>

<p><em>Some debug info:</em></p>

<p>There are no errors untill a second rotation. which makes sense beacuse if the progress dialogs aren't dismissed between the first and second rotations, they are effectively leaked.</p>

<p>when the app first runs, despite two calls to showDialog, onCreateDialog is called only once (I believe this is the normal behaviour). however after the first rotation and for any subsequent rotation onCreateDalog will be called twice per run.</p>

I've 12 div's with class <code>.hover</code> and I've also develop a <code>setInterval()</code> function to generates a random number from 1 to 12  to get a <code>eq()</code> of any particular <code>div</code> to flip after every 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Now the problem is I want <code>setInterval</code> function to stop working if I hover any of the div which has class <code>.hover</code></p>

<p>My jQuery code is below</p>

<pre><code>setInterval(function(){
  if($('.hover').is(':hover') == true)
    {   
     $('.hover').removeClass('flip');
     $(this).addClass('flip');
    }
  else{
    var randomNum = Math.ceil(Math.random()*12); /* Pick random number between 1 and 2 */   
    $('.hover').removeClass('flip');
    $('.hover').eq(randomNum).addClass('flip');

I have a form which is displayed on a click event and positoned by script as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$('#whatever').click(function(event){
   $('#dialog').css('left', event.pageX);
   $('#dialog').css('top', event.pageY);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Works fine so the dialog apears on left top of current mouse position.
If I now resize the windows while the dialog is shown, it looses ""orientation"" :-)
So I need to refresh to the current mouseposition on</p>

<pre><code>$(window).resize(function(event){
   $('#dialog').css('left', event.pageX);
   $('#dialog').css('top', event.pageY);
});
</code></pre>

<p>But guess what, this does not work. How can I get the position without having a
mousemove or click just after having resized the window - is that possible?</p>

I have two machines, one using .Net Framework 4.0 and the other using version 4.5 (4.0's replacement). When I run my web application and execute a particular Linq-To-Entities query on the 4.0 machine the query runs fine, but when I run the 4.5 machine the query fails with the Oracle error <strong>{""ORA-00907: missing right parenthesis""} inner exception {""Oracle 10.2.0.4.0 does not support APPLY""}</strong> </p>

<p>Blurb from link above</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Targeting the Correct SQL Server Version
  The Entity Framework targets the Transact-SQL query based on the SQL Server version that is specified in the ProviderManifestToken attribute of the Schema element in the storage model (.ssdl) file. This version might differ from the version of the actual SQL Server you are connected to. For example, if you are using SQL Server 2005, but your ProviderManifestToken attribute is set to 2008, the generated Transact-SQL query might not execute on the server. For example, a query that uses the new date time types that were introduced in SQL Server 2008 will not execute on earlier versions of the SQL Server. If you are using SQL Server 2005, but your ProviderManifestToken attribute is set to 2000, the generated Transact-SQL query might be less optimized, or you might get an exception that says that the query is not supported. For more information, see the CROSS and OUTER APPLY Operators section, earlier in this topic.
  Certain database behaviors depend on the compatibility level set to the database. If your ProviderManifestToken attribute is set to 2005 and your SQL Server version is 2005, but the compatibility level of a database is set to ""80"" (SQL Server 2000), the generated Transact-SQL will be targeting SQL Server 2005, but might not execute as expected due to the compatibility level setting. For example, you might lose ordering information if a column name in the ORDER BY list matches a column name in the selector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my case I only see ""Provider=""Oracle.DataAccess.Client"" ProviderManifestToken=""10.2"" since I'm using Oracle.</p>

<p>Then, I want to create a delegate that will point to one of these methods:</p>

<pre><code>delegate Something ProblematicDelegateType(&lt;&lt;WHAT WILL GO HERE&gt;&gt;);
ProblematicDelegateType myFunc;
if(someValue == someParameter){
    myFunc = FirstMethod;
}else if(...){
    myFunc = SecondMethod;
}else...
...
}

myFunc();
myFunc(skip:100);
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to call <code>myFunc</code> both parameterless or with the <code>skip</code> parameter. In this part of code, the first parameter, <code>val</code>, is NOT used. (they are used elsewhere).</p>

<p>What will go to the delegate's argument list? I want to preserve <em>that method's</em> default <code>val</code> argument, whatever it is.</p>

<p>Which does in fact properly set the ""Checked"" property to true, but the tick is not displayed on the form.  I also have attempted setting TreeViewNode text and experience the same result.  I've checked the hash values on the .NET objects thinking that the event handler was firing from a separate runspace or working with copies of the objects but this does not appear to be the case.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on why the form isn't displaying changes to the objects from inside the handler?  My form's load handler is able to properly populate the TreeView, so why wouldn't I be able to modify it from the AfterCheck handler?</p>

"20738437","1","20738823","","2013-12-23 06:56:35","","1","73","<p>I have JS with an options var like so :</p>

<pre><code>$output .= 
        '&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
         // &lt;![CDATA[

                var options = {
                        render: ""canvas"", 
                        size: ""100"",
                        radius: ""0.5"",
                        };

         // ]]&gt;
         &lt;/script&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>But I need to output it ( echo ) with PHP variables and it can not be in a separated file, So I did the output using normal concatenation with a point <code>.</code> e.g. <code>'.$var.'</code>but since my JS needs double quotes <code>""</code> I had put them also into the mix resulting in double-single quote sequence .</p>

<pre><code>var options = {
        render: ""'.$q_render.'"", // Canvas, Div ,Image
        size: ""'.$q_size.'"",
        radius: ""'. $q_corner_r.'"",
        };
</code></pre>

<p>And it works as far as my tests goes .</p>

<p>The plot thickens , when I need the specific value of <code>$q_corner_r</code> to be multiplied by a factor :</p>

<pre><code>var options = {
        render: ""'.$q_ender.'"", // Canvas, Div ,Image
        size: ""'.$q_size.'"",
        radius: ""'. ($q_corner_r )* 3 .'"",
        };
</code></pre>

<p>Which also works . 
But the real problem is that I needed to be a decimal value and thus multiple by a decimal factor .</p>

<pre><code>var options = {
        render: ""'.$q_ender.'"", // Canvas, Div ,Image
        size: ""'.$q_size.'"",
        radius: ""'. ($q_corner_r )* 0.3 .'"",
        };
</code></pre>

<p>At this point , PHP throws an error , because for all it knows, the decimal point in <code>0.3</code> is actually an <code>end concatenation</code> point.</p>

<p>my layman solution to the problem was to wrap the problem in <code>json_encode()</code> and send it to battle naked and defenseless.</p>

<pre><code>radius: ""'. json_encode( ($q_corner_r )* 0.1 ) .'"",
</code></pre>

<p>which , very surprisingly, works ok.</p>

<p>So everything works now ( don´t panic ) - but my doubt remains. </p>

<p>How should I handle this situation ? ( I know I <em>CAN</em> do <code>$qr_corner_r = ($qr_corner_r )* 0.1</code> in PHP before the JS .. but <em>SHOULD I</em> ? )</p>

<p>It is only for pure luck ( or stupidity, or a combination of both ) that my code works .</p>

<p>Is there any other solution / method adequate for these situations ?</p>

<p>Are we merely observing a simply bad ""wrong escaping"" case ? ( or no-escaping-at-all in my case )</p>

<p>I didn't have an error, all normally. After restarting application I got ""CoreData could not fulfill a fault"" exception.

<p>Also, UI may have access to property with managedObject when different thread updates an object.</p>

<p>How it can occurs? And how to prevent this? I read coreData troubleshooting with ""CoreData could not fulfill a fault"". I didn't found my problem since example. </p>

<p>I very confused about this. I have idea, but not sure, what it good way:
What about if make the property not as managedObject, but as id(custom id, as NSNumber), owerload setter and getter. Setter receive same object, but have access to custom id and assign an id for property. Getter - fetches object by id, saved in property.
Getter and setter will lock the NSLock at start and unlock this at end. Thread, which updates an object locks the lock too, until updating and saving is finished.

I very apologize, but I usually can't show my code by serious reason.</p>

<pre><code>public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomerByFirstName(string customerFirstName)

return _session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Customer))
    .Add(new NHibernate.Expression.EqExpression(""FirstName"", customerFirstName))

<p>I am calling <code>Session.Flush()</code> at the end of the <code>HttpRequest</code>, and I get a <code>HibernateAdoException</code>. NHibernate is passing an update statement to the db, and causing a foreign key violation. If I don't run the <code>flush</code>, the request completes with no problem. The issue here is that I need the flush in place in case there is a change that occurs within other sessions, since this code is reused in other areas. Is there another configuration setting I might be missing?</p>

<p>In the Highchart's documentation I've found this example of sending data cross domains:</p>

<pre><code>http://docs.highcharts.com/#cross-domain-data
</code></pre>

<p>This is their example (using php):</p>

<pre><code>The serverside php file:
&lt;?php
header(""content-type: application/json""); 

$array = array(7,4,2,8,4,1,9,3,2,16,7,12);

echo $_GET['callback']. '('. json_encode($array) . ')';    

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The JavaScript calling the callback function using jQuery.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
var options = {
    chart: {
        renderTo: 'container',
        type: 'spline'
    },
    series: [{}]
};

var url =  ""http://url-to-your-remote-server/jsonp.php?callback=?"";
$.getJSON(url,  function(data) {
options.series[0].data = data;
var chart = new Highcharts.Chart(options);
});
});
</code></pre>

<p>And now this is how my WebService.cs looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public WebService () {
    //Uncomment the following line if using designed components 
    //InitializeComponent(); 
}

[WebMethod(Description = ""ID:2"")]
[ScriptMethod(ResponseFormat = ResponseFormat.Json)]

public string GetSomeValues() {

    string[] values = { ""3"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""3""};

    string[][] jaggedTable = new string[values.Count()][];

    int i = 0;
    foreach (var value in values)
    {
        jaggedTable[i] = new string[] { value + """" };
        i++;
    }

    JavaScriptSerializer js = new JavaScriptSerializer();
    string strJSON = js.Serialize(jaggedTable);

    return strJSON;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the Default.aspx:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function () {
        var options = {
            chart: {
                renderTo: 'container',
                type: 'spline'
            },
            series: [{}]
        };

        var url = ""WebService.asmx/GetSomeValues"";
        $.getJSON(url, function (data) {
            options.series[0].data = data;
            var chart = new Highcharts.Chart(options);
        });
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've just seen that I'm getting in the console this error:</p>

<p>Where the anonymous function is:</p>

The stored procedure logs progress percentage in an additional table. I call using AJAX the page which executes the stored procedure and with another AJAX call another page which queries that additional table and returns the status value. </p>

<p>The problem I’m encountering is that it looks like all responses come at the same time, at the response of the longest AJAX request. Please see the picture below:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/U8597.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The second request should be processed before the first one as it takes only few milliseconds to respond.</p>

<p>The above result is accomplished by the jQuery code listed below:</p>

<pre><code>    $(document).ready(function(){
        $.post('BS_process.asp',{u:&lt;%=UniqID%&gt;, p:&lt;%=ProfileID%&gt;}).done(function(response){
//          DO STUFF
        }).fail(function(){
//          DO STUFF
        });

        $.post('BS_progress_ajax.asp',{u:&lt;%=UniqID%&gt;}).done(function(response){
            console.log(response);
        });     
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Now I’m not too sure, but I think it is happening because of server limitation of simultaneous requests. My requirement is to get each response immediately.  Eventually I will implement an interval to check the progress.</p>

<p>Please advise me how to go about this problem</p>

<p>When I call <code>$scope.addSurvey()</code> I see ""success"" in my log (and the database is modified properly), but <code>alert(""OK"")</code> doesn't fire.</p>

<p>If I don't use <code>$loaded</code>, method returns immediately and doesn't wait for the data to be loaded and processed. On the other hand, if I use <code>$loaded</code>, it doesn't seem to return anything at all.</p>

Below is the diagram used for the project</p>

<h1>Prompt for project</h1>

<p>*The shaded boxes represent pointers.  The unshaded boxes represent a dynamically allocated two dimensional int array.  Your program cannot create named identifiers for any of the unnamed items.  The number of rows and the number of columns will be user input.  The ellipses in the diagram represent that the sizes of the rows and columns are variable.  The vertical array is an array of pointers.  Each of the vertical array elements points to a one dimensional array of integers.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vmgae.png"" alt=""Diagram""></p>

<p>In your program only refer to the integer array through the pointers represented by s, t, u, and v.  When passing to functions you must always pass these pointers.  You cannot dereference actual parameters in a function call. Nor can you dereference pointers and assign them to variables just in order to work with them.*</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;


void fillArray(int **pArray, int rows, int columns)
{
    for(int row = 0; row &lt; rows; row++)

        *(pArray + row) = new int;
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Enter "" &lt;&lt;  "" row "" &lt;&lt; row + 1&lt;&lt; endl;

        for(int col = 0; col &lt; columns; col++)
        {
            cin &gt;&gt; *(*(pArray + row) + col);

    }

void printArray(int **pArray, int rows, int columns)

<p>Sorry for the poor code formatting. I couldn't understand how to copy and paste in code block.</p>

<p>So my question is, how do I implement the diagram with my program. I started with the basics of creating the array using pointer offset and labeling it with it's own name.</p>

<p>I believe I have to change all of my references to work with the pointer variables 's, t, u, v.' Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>The typical action would be going to a Sales Order and clicking on “Create an Invoice”.</p>

<p>The end game of the plug-in is to integrate the Invoice into a Remote system along with the header and lines.</p>

<p>Plug-in works in the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Plugin is registered with the CRM Invoice for the “Create” Event.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugin runs “Asynchronously” via a Post operation of the Invoice Header.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon hitting “Create Invoice”, UI Action; Plugin sends the newly created Invoice GUID to a service, this is typically a POST operation:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a.       We Basically make a call to an ASPX page which accepts this request and processes it.</p>

<p>b.      Processing includes steps by:</p>

<p>i. Getting the invoice header through a CRM Service Retrieve call.</p>

<p>ii. Getting the Invoice Lines through a CRM Service Retrieve multiple call.</p>

<p>c.       Commit the Invoice to the 3rd Remote Application Database.</p>

<p>d.      We respond to the Plug-in by wrapping any custom status or error messages.</p>

<ol>
<li>All the processes finishes in less than a minute.</li>
</ol>

<p>Scenarios We tested on our end:</p>

<p>Case 1:</p>

<p>Invoice Containing 5-10 Lines</p>

<p>Steps 3(a).  till 3(d). runs successfully and integrated the Invoice with all the lines.</p>

<p>Case 2: ISSUE</p>

<p>Invoice Containing more than 10 (Tested with 15-40 lines)</p>

<p>Step 3b(ii) . Invoice Lines Retrieval process retrieves only some lines and not all the lines</p>

<p>Initially we thought, there could be a Read lock for the current Authenticated user for CRM SDK, as the logged in user was also same, when the CRM is creating lines for the Invoice.</p>

<p>But the test failed there too.</p>

<p>Successful Scenario Tested:</p>

<p>We retrieved the Invoice Lines separately through a different call by delaying the call for some seconds. The number of lines retrieved was successful. But not sure what delay the server would take.</p>

<p>We require your inputs on this issue to move forward in order to resolve this as we may be making some mistakes while doing this Plugin request call.</p>

<pre><code>Foo::Foo in file1.cpp:12
Bar::Bar in file2.cpp:45
...

<p>(assuming I have debug symbols available). Is there such a tool? If not, how could one write it? Does the <code>.init_array</code> section contain pointers to code which could be translated via some DWARF magic to the above?</p>

The language is C/C++, and most of the code was written by electronics engineers -- that is, people who do a lot of embedded device work.</p>

<p>As such, unions and bitfields are used all over the place.  It's pretty straightforward to deal with structs &amp; whatnot that don't involve bitfields or unions, but because of the convention for which bit is interpreted as the MSB or LSB, as well as byte ordering, it can be rather irritating to convert code over to x86 linux.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a clean methodology for bringing this old code into the 21st century.  Any suggestions (examples, research papers, whitepapers, book suggestions, etc) are quite welcome.</p>

<p>In my project I'm handling a ViewExpiredException properly and show a custom page to the user that the current session has timed out. This works great, but I want to do something BEFORE this message gets shown to the user. Actually I'm working with 2 different sessions here, one on the frontend side and one on the backend, so the idea is to NOT start a new backend session when the current one timed out.
Is there any possibility to fetch the ViewExpiredException while I'm inside the doFilter method, so I do not start a new backend session (simply because it is not needed)? Or is there any other way?</p>

<p>I already tried to fetch the current context via </p>

<pre><code>FacesContext fc = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
</code></pre>

<p>But obviously the context is null, because the session timed out.
Inside the ExceptionHandlerWrapper I have access to the UnhandledExceptionQueuedEvents, but this does not help me here since I need this information earlier.</p>

<p>All of the above is in the SQL file except that file path. There is no variable in the file that is receiving the value of that path.

The try-catch block doesn't seem to catch anything.</p>

I've downloaded the jars from <a href=""http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctestfx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctestfx</a> to a folder named 'TestFX-3.1.2' on my system.</p>

<p>Afterwards I've created a new library in Netbeans8 pointing to those jar files (jar, source and javadoc). As a matter of test I've created a simple Java FXML project with the new library added. </p>

<pre><code>public class Test2 extends Application {

@Override
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(""FXMLDocument.fxml""));

    Scene scene = new Scene(root);

    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}

/**
 * @param args the command line arguments
 */
public static void main(String[] args) {
    launch(args);
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>Next to that I have a controller for my FXML file with the following generated code:</p>

<pre><code>public class FXMLDocumentController implements Initializable {

@FXML
private Label label;

@FXML
private void handleButtonAction(ActionEvent event) {
    System.out.println(""You clicked me!"");
    label.setText(""Hello World!"");
}

@Override
public void initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb) {
    // TODO
}    

}
</code></pre>

<p>To implement the TestFX side, I've created a new class that extends GuiTest:</p>

<pre><code>package test2;

import java.io.IOException;
import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import javafx.scene.Parent;
import org.loadui.testfx.GuiTest;


public class TestTheThing extends GuiTest {

    @Override
    protected Parent getRootNode() {
        FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader();
        Parent node = null;
        try {
            node = loader.load(this.getClass().getResource(""FXMLDocument.fxml"").openStream());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println(e.toString());    
        }
        return node;
    }

    @Test //&lt;-- this Annotiation does not work
    public void pressTheButton(){
        //TODO
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As said above in the code, the @Test simply does not work and is red underlined with the warning 'cannot find symbol'. Could anyone point me in the right direction about what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>The CATextLayer is in a subclass of CAShapeLayer.  I should also mention that the CATextLayer does render with the correct attributes, EXCEPT the color.</p>

<pre><code>// in .m

-(void)updateColor{

     if(textLayer)textLayer.string = [textLayer.string attributedStringWithColor:kDefaultLineColor];

<p>The string shows up attributed EXCEPT for the color.  And then I get a whole bunch of errors:</p>

<p>CGContextSetFillColorWithColor: invalid context 0x0. This is a serious error. This application, or a library it uses, is using an invalid context  and is thereby contributing to an overall degradation of system stability and reliability. This notice is a courtesy: please fix this problem. It will become a fatal error in an upcoming update.</p>

<p>Following MVVM purist best practices, I figure having a list of ViewModels in the outer ViewModel is the way to go about this, and let the outer View bind a custom tab control (or similar) to that.</p>

<p>This brings me to two aspects of this which are unclear to me:</p>

<p><strong>Point One: ""Which came first?""</strong>  </p>

<p>The outer View / ViewModel combo would probably be ""View First"". That is, a view either receives a ViewModel, or instantiates one. </p>

<p>But when it comes to the list of ViewModels within this outer ViewModel: Where do their respective Views come from? Which entity is responsible for picking the best view for each of these? </p>

<p>I'm not all comfortable with alternating between ""View First"" and ""ViewModel First"" like this.</p>

<p><strong>Point Two: Communication between ViewModels</strong></p>

<p>When one of the inner ViewModel steps are completed, e.g. at the click of a ""Save"" or ""Next"" button, a command should be fired to that inner ViewModel, and then the next should be shown. </p>

<p>This requires the outer ViewModel to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>be able to pick up on the Save command sent to the inner ViewModel</p></li>
<li><p>be able to access the data within the inner ViewModel. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>How would one normally go about this? Is it considered a bad practice to tie the inner and outer ViewModel together with events?</p>

<p>My main problem is that if I send all messages correctly, my code hangs, because socket.read will block until I receive a message. Apple doesn't return <em>anything</em> if your messages looked OK, so my program locks up.</p>

<p>Here is some pseudocode for how I have this working:</p>

<pre><code>cert = File.read(options[:cert])
ctx = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new
ctx.key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(cert, options[:passphrase])
ctx.cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(cert)

sock = TCPSocket.new(options[:host], options[:port])
ssl = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.new(sock, ctx)
ssl.sync = true
ssl.connect

messages.each do |message|
  ssl.write(message.to_apn)
end

if read_buffer = ssl.read(6)
  process_error_response(read_buffer)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, there are a number of problems with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I'm sending messages to a large number of devices, and the failure message is sent half way through processing, then I'm not going to actually see the error until I've already tried to send to all devices.</li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, if all messages were acceptable to Apple, my app will hang on the socket read call.</li>
</ol>

<p>One way I've tried to solve this is by to reading from the socket in a separate thread:</p>

<pre><code>Thread.new() {
  while data = ssl.read(6)
    process_error_response(data)
  end
}

messages.each do |message|
  ssl.write(message.to_apn)
end

ssl.close
sock.close
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't seem to work. Data never seems to be read from the socket. This is probably a misunderstanding I have about how sockets are supposed to work.</p>

<p>The other solution I have thought of is having a non-blocking read call... but it doesn't seem like Ruby has a non blocking read call on SSLSocket until 1.9... which I unfortunately cannot use right now.</p>

<p>Could someone with a better understanding of socket programming please point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>I have a Rails app which is a static codebase and runs on 9 different servers all the same db schema but of course with different values.</p>

<p>I wrote some SQL to query some dollar totals and will be putting this into either a rake task or a sidekiq worker and have it fire once a week to generate the data. Initially I was thinking of just throwing the resulting data from each server into a mailer and mailing it to whoever needs the data. This is pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>But there's a kink in this, we need to see metrics over time in highcharts or some other charting engine.</p>

<p>So here's my thought.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the sidekiq worker and fire it on a schedule</li>
<li>Take the resulting data from each server and populate it on a target server via Postgres (not sure how to do this)</li>
<li>The target server will have a very simple Rails app built that will have a model with metrics and an association for each server (ie server 1 server 2 etc), after populating the data via postgres (somehow) from the source servers, read the data in HighCharts and present the view</li>
</ol>

<p>So that's my thought process so far. I'm not sure on how to get the data from the source servers via a live postgres call when the sidekiq worker fires. So that's problem #1. Problem #2 or more like question #2 is, would this be a better use case for creating some sort of consumable API on the target Rails server? If so, what's the best place to start.</p>

<p>If my question and thought process is unclear, please let me know so I can clarify and explain in better detail.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Two main reasons is that I want to avoid locks as I have been told that @synchronise is not best practice anymore and have several get requests to the internet I need to synchronise.</p>

<p>My solution is to create a serial queue, but its scope is only in the method where I define it. I don't want to use the global queue as its a concurrent queue and I specifically want a serial queue.</p>

<p>So I have solved it, I believe, by defining my queue as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@interface MyViewController : UIViewController
{
    dispatch_queue_t mySerialQueue;
}

@implementation MyViewController

- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
    if (!mySerialQueue) 
    mySerialQueue = dispatch_queue_create(""com.myAppQueue"", NULL);
}

- (void)myMethod
{
    dispatch_async(mySerialQueue, ^{
    //My block code here
    });
}

- (void)myOtherMethod
{
    dispatch_async(mySerialQueue, ^{
    //My other block code here
    });
}

- (void) viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated
{
    free(mySerialQueue);

<p>I have an if expression in those empty excel columns which will just put nothing inside the cell if the value of another sheet is not a number. </p>

<p>If I could use the ""else"" statement to insert a numeric value to each cell or maybe NULL I could import directly as float.

<p><strong>ItemDTO contains:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>itemID</li>
<li>type</li>
<li>subtype</li>
<li>bodypart</li>
<li>price</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ItemOnCharacterDTO contains:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ownerID</li>
<li>itemID</li>
<li>count</li>
<li>location</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ItemDTO are</strong> read statically from XML files. There thousands of them and they don't change (at least I don't care if they do at the moment).
<strong>ItemOnCharacterDTOs are</strong> created by querying a database. The ownerID, itemID, count and location vary per character and thus are saved in the database. The itemID here corresponds to a valid ItemDTO.</p>

<p>I have an array (or ArrayList) of ItemOnCharacterDTO-objects which I want to sort by multiple criteria, e.g. by ""itemOnCharacterDTO.ownerID"", ""itemDTO.name"", ""itemDTO.type"".</p>

<p>If I combined ItemDTO and ItemOnCharacterDTO to one class (e.g. ItemAllDTO), I could easily use the <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/beanutils/commons-beanutils-1.7.0/docs/bean-collections/org/apache/commons/beanutils/BeanComparator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">apache BeanComparator</a>. However: I am not.
The reason is: the user can have multiple items on different characters. The basic item-data (ItemDTO-data) is the same, while user-specific data (ItemOnCharacterDTO-data) changes. Therefore I load the former only once, while loading user-specific data each time I encounter a different ItemOnCharacterDTO.</p>

<p><em>Since I'm writing it all in GWT, I decided to sort on the server, because that's where all the information is (in contrast to the front end, where item-related information is loaded with pagination). I'm using Java on server-side. I've written a mapper to properly retrieve the static XML data from the item-related XML-files. But character-based item-related information is stored in a mysql-database</em>.</p>

<p><strong>I want to be able to sort the array or ArrayList of ItemOnCharacterDTOs by attributes present in either ItemOnCharacterDTO- or ItemDTO-object</strong> (I have a way to distinguish what DTO the given attribute belongs to - meaning: I know if the user sorts by ""count"", that I am going to have to check ItemOnCharacterDTO-object for this attribute and not the ItemDTO-object).</p>

<p>Each user might have a few thousand objects. Each ItemOnCharacterDTO has about 5 attributes, but each ItemDTO has about 25 or so. Therefore combining them into one object - even just for comparison purposes - is not really an option as it will be very slow and memory-consuming.</p>

<p>Does someone have a better approach? I'm glad for any help - even if you just give a raw idea. I'll work it out.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance! Your help is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Igor.</p>

<p>P.s.: if you have any further questions, please feel free to ask - I'll reply as soon as possible!
P.s.2: is there maybe something like ""LINQ"" for Java? Maybe it'd help me solve my problem?</p>

<p>UPDATE 2:</p>

<p>The basic algorithm I want to implement is :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I need to cover all the food items (each food item can occur only once). </p></li>
<li><p>Once all food items are covered I just stop. (though there are few query sample form the user still left)</p></li>

<p>My confusion, if foreign keys are only for referential integrity does this mean that: Table User Profile : Column Location_ID does not hold data....</p>

<p>I would like to avoid joins for performance reasons. hence could I say:</p>

<p>The User supplies country, state and city on sign up:so look up Location_ID in Locations table. insert into User Profiles table the Location_ID found in Locations Table into User Profile Table: Location_ID.</p>

<p>Then on finding all users with the same location I would just need to query the Profile tables Location_ID to find those users... So should I then make the Table User Profiles : Location_ID a column which is not a foreign key instead.. </p>

<p>The scenario is match the users in a country with the same set of interests,</p>

<p>which lives in another table called Interest</p>

<p>PK: User , Interest</p>

<pre><code> 1      golf
 2      cricket
 3      swimming
 1      Rugby
 2      golf

<p>Thus using code , I would say the users from location_Id:1 in user profile table, use the user to query interest in interest table. hence returning user and interest for further process with code.</p>

<p>A text book I am using seems to use the foreign key as data for location as set up above</p>

<p>PK = primary key and FK = foreign key.

<p>Here is what they need to look like afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>Some text
Some text
Some text

<p>Is this possible with 1 regex, or will many be needed?</p>

<p>My thinking is that a regex looks for <code>&lt;</code> anything in between, and then <code>&gt;</code> could be used on both the opening and closing <code>option</code> tags. Then the regex could be slightly modified to look for opening <code>(</code> and then closing <code>)</code> to remove the counter numbers to the left of the 'Some text' string.</p>

<p>Still learing regex, so it would be great if someone could also add a small explanation to their answer so that I could have some understanding of it. Thanks.</p>

<p>The problem is that in IE9 the Silverlight version of plupload gets loaded because html5 file handling isn't supported by IE9. Somehow the Add files button isn't pressable, the Start upload button is however. From what I've read so far this is being caused by the UI dialog being hidden before I open it. Several people suggested using a call to refresh on the uploader widget, but that doesn't make a difference.</p>

<p>The relevant Javascript code looks as follows:
    $(""#upload-widget-container"").dialog({
            autoOpen: false,
            show: ""blind"",
            hide: ""fold"",
            modal: false,
            width: 660,
            height: 400,
            resizable: false
        });</p>

<pre><code>$(""#upload-widget"").pluploadQueue({
        runtimes : 'html5,silverlight,flash,browserplus',
        container: 'upload-widget-container',
        url : 'upload.php',
        max_file_size : '100mb',
        chunk_size : '1mb',
        unique_names : true,
        filters : [
            {title : ""Image files"", extensions : ""jpg,gif,png""},
            {title : ""Zip files"", extensions : ""zip""},
            {title : ""Bin files"", extensions : ""bin""}
        ],
        flash_swf_url : '/js/plupload/plupload.flash.swf',
        silverlight_xap_url : '/js/plupload/plupload.silverlight.xap'
    });

    $('.upload-button').live('click', function(e)
        {
            $('#upload-widget-container').dialog(""open"");
            var uploader = $('#upload-widget').pluploadQueue();

            uploader.bind('StateChanged', function() {
                if (uploader.files.length === (uploader.total.uploaded + uploader.total.failed)) {
                    // Done uploading
                    for (var i=0; i &lt; uploader.files.length; i++)
                    {
                        if (uploader.files[i].status == plupload.DONE)
                        {
                            alert(uploader.files[i].id + ' ' + uploader.files[i].name);
                        }
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    );
</code></pre>

<p>The markup looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""upload-widget-container""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""upload-widget""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a class=""upload-button green-button-148"" href=""#"" rel=""1234""&gt;Upload&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas of how to get this working in IE9/Silverlight? As shown in the code above the lines to refresh the plupload object and setting the z-index of the .plupload div didn't make a difference.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> it actually looks like an IE9 problem, because if I use the silverlight runtime of plupload in FF and Safari it works fine. So it's the combination of plupload, a jquery ui dialog, silverlight and IE9.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> So I made a plain vanilla test page with no other markup, css or js. This removed the possibility of other scripts or markup or styling interfering with the workings of this.
However it still doesn't work in IE 9 (Version: 9.0.8112.16421).</p>

<p><strong>However if I remove the line that includes the jQuery UI theme CSS it does work and the Add Files button is clickable.</strong>
Any new ideas with this new information? I'm guessing it has to do with a display property in the UI theme CSS or something like that.</p>

<p>here are all the names of the rows in the table:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table class=""grid""&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class=""center"" colspan=""25""&gt;Attendance By Class&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=""center th2""&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;Exp&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th colspan=""5""&gt;Last Week&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th colspan=""5""&gt;This Week&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;Course&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;Q1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;Q2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;S1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;Q3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;Q4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;S2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;Absences&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=""2""&gt;Tardies&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and this is an example row:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""scores.html?  frn=004711281&amp;begdate=01/23/2013&amp;enddate=06/07/2013&amp;fg=S2""&gt;B&lt;br&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

We are developing a trade show kiosk that allows users to post results to their facebook page using Flash/Air. When we connect to Facebook we get the usual fields and links like 'forgot your password', 'create an account' links.  </p>

<p>We do not want these links functional because it is not technically a website.  These links opens the door to defeating the kiosk application or leaving in a state that is not desired for the next user.   </p>

<p>Questions:  is it possible to get around this issue with perhaps an alternate login process?</p>

<p>Is there a clever way to defeat these behaviors so that only submit or cancel links work?</p>

<p>I'll consider any work around ideas.</p>

The reason I would want to do this is because this is not a web application, it's a web service that accepts data via the querystring and routes it to a controller that does the work.  </p>

<p>So, given a class called MyParam with properties A &amp; B, how can I construct a querystring that will pass data to the following controller method:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult MyMethod(List&lt;MyParam&gt; ParamList)
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried using the MVC framework to RedirectToAction and RedirectToResult to see what it comes up with, but I assume that my n00bness with MVC is causing me to make a mistake because it never passes the data correctly and MyMethod always has null for the parameter.</p>

What's the best way to take a user's search phrase and throw it into a <code>CONTAINSTABLE(table, column, @phrase, topN )</code> phrase?</p>

<p>Say, for example the user inputs: <code>Books by ""Dr. Seuss""</code> </p>

<p>What's the best way to turn that into something that will return results in my <code>ContainsTAble()</code> phrase?</p>

<p>I was previously parsing the search phrase and writing something like <code>ISABOUT(""Books"" WEIGHT(1.0), ""by"" WEIGHT(0.9), ""Dr. Seuss"" WEIGHT(0.8))</code> as my @phrase but ISABOUT seems to be returning odd results... especially when one word searches are entered.</p>

<p>My basic goal is to use the mixins and variables in bootstrap in my own css files.</p>

<p>From my understanding the process would be, get the less files, import them into the project, and <code>import</code> the bootstrap reference. So at this point I can now use the mixins in my own css file. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>@import ""less/bootstrap.less"";

.myRow{
    .make-row();
}
</code></pre>

<p>However now I have a 7400+ lines of styling in myCustomStyles.css. Is this ""correct""? I don't understand why it actually imports all the styles. My understanding is... that I have a reference to bootstrap.min.css CDN or local. Then myCustomStyles.css will be included AFTER that and override the default values.</p>

<p>I guess I'm confused at how do I take advantage of a CDN and still use the mixins and variables in bootstrap?</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://github.com/highsource/hyperjaxb3"" rel=""nofollow"">PO Sample from git sources</a> on tag 0.6.0 ejb/tests/po-customized, I tried some configuration.</p>

<p>First, I added join-column as one-to-many mapping in bindings</p>

<p><strong>bindings.xjb</strong></p>

<pre><code>...
        &lt;hj:persistence&gt;
            &lt;hj:default-one-to-many&gt;
                &lt;orm:join-column /&gt;
                &lt;!-- &lt;orm:join-table /&gt; --&gt;
            &lt;/hj:default-one-to-many&gt;
        &lt;/hj:persistence&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>This only change the annotation in getItem, from JoinTable to JoinColumn.</p>

<p>Also, I tried to override xsd mapping by telling it to add a list directly. the following code doesn't work, but it's the general idea of what I've been trying... (never get something like it to work)</p>

<p><strong>bindings.xjb</strong></p>

<pre><code>...
        &lt;jaxb:bindings node=""xs:complexType[@name='PurchaseOrderType']""&gt;
            &lt;hj:entity&gt;
                &lt;orm:table name=""po"" /&gt;
            &lt;/hj:entity&gt;
            &lt;jaxb:bindings node="".//xs:element[@name='items']""&gt;
                &lt;hj:one-to-many&gt;
                    &lt;orm:join-column name=""PO_ID"" /&gt;
                &lt;/hj:one-to-many&gt;
            &lt;/jaxb:bindings&gt;
        &lt;/jaxb:bindings&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to generate <strong>PurchaseOrderType</strong> with this definition? (some xml annotations omitted)</p>

<pre><code>...
public class PurchaseOrderType ... {

    protected USAddress shipTo;
    protected USAddress billTo;

    @XmlElementWrapper(name=""items"")
    @XmlElement(name=""item"")
    protected List&lt;Item&gt; items;

    protected XMLGregorianCalendar orderDate;

    @OneToMany(targetEntity = Item.class, cascade = {
        CascadeType.ALL
    })
    public List&lt;Item&gt; getItems() {

<p>Note in this code, I'm pointing directly to generated Item, and not Items.Item.</p>

We have many pages on our site which primarily hold a single YouTube video. I would like that when a viewer Facebook-shares such a page, it will appear in his FB timeline as a page from our site, yet play the YouTube video directly in Facebook.</p>

<p>This is primarily a matter of properly setting the relevant open-graph (og) tags - which I believe I've done correctly. It also used to work for us, but for most videos no longer does (don't know since when).</p>

<p>Anyway, the vast majority of our videos do not play directly in FB. When you click on them, they appear to start playing but then the playing area turns blank. If you right-click the area, a menu appears, with the first (unselectable) item saying ""Movie not loaded...""</p>

<p>I have found two video pages on our site which <strong>do</strong> play correctly in FB, and darned if I know what's different about them. My suspicion is that it is some sort of permissions issue with the YouTube channel, as the 2 which do play come from different channels. Beyond that, the OG settings are identical.</p>

<p>Here are two pages which do not embed properly in FB:</p>

<h2>Im working on a quiz app that uses answer results from a view contoller, creates NSMutableArray objects for totalCorrect and totalTried values in a KeepScore model .m file and the model returns a score back to my view controller. The view controller then updates my score label in my view. I then use the UINavigationController to segue to my next view controller and then wait for the user to input the next quiz question answer. Problem is that the next time i call my KeepScore model .m file from my view controller 2, the NSMutableArray objects in KeepScore model .m have reverted to Null values. I made sure my NSMutableArray object values were correct (non Null) right before returning from my KeepScore .m model to my view controller 1. Im working iOS 5.1 with Xcode 4.3.1 with ARC. My NSMutableArray property in my private API declaration in .m model file is strong. Shouldn't the KeepScore model .m keep my array object values when i return to my view controller so that i can use them again when i call my model from my next view controller? I wanted to ask in wording first to see if anyone catches any syupid logic I have. I'll post code if helpful.</h2>

"8632109","1","","","2011-12-25 23:21:25","","2","1443","<p>So let's say pretty often a script runs that opens a browser and does web things:</p>

<pre><code>require 'watir-webdriver'

$browser = Watir::Browser.new(:firefox, :profile =&gt; ""botmode"")
 =&gt; #&lt;Watir::Browser:0x7fc97b06f558 url=""about:blank"" title=""about:blank""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>It could end gracefully with a browser.close, or it could crash sooner and leave behind the memory-hungry Firefox process, unnoticed until they accumulate and slow the server to a crawl.</p>

<p>My question is twofold: </p>

<ul>
<li>What is a good practice to ensure that even in case of script failure anywhere leading to immediate error exit, the subprocess will always get cleaned up (I already have lots of short begin-rescue-end blocks peppered for other unrelated small tests)</li>
<li>More importantly, can I simply remember this Watir::Browser:0x7fc97b06f558 object address or PID somehow and re-assign it to another $browser variable in a whole new Ruby process, for example irb?  I.e. can an orphaned browser on webdriver be re-attached later in another program using watir-webdriver on the same machine?  From irb I could then get in and re-attach to the browser left behind by the crashed Ruby script, to examine the website it was on, check what went wrong, what elements are different than expected, etc.   </li>
</ul>

<p>Another hugely advantageous use of the latter would be to avoid the overhead of potentially hundreds of browser startups and shutdowns per day...best to keep one alive as sort of a daemon.  The first run would attempt to reuse a previous browser object using my specially prepared <em>botmode</em> profile, otherwise create one.  Then I would deliberately not call $browser.close at the end of my script.  If nothing else I run an at job to kill the Xvfb :99 display FF runs inside of at the end of the day anyway (giving FF no choice but to die with it, if still running).  Yes I am aware of Selenium standalone jar, but trying to avoid that java service footprint too.</p>

<p>Apologies if this is more a basic Ruby question.  I just wasn't sure how to phrase it and keep getting irrelevant search results.</p>

"26222323","1","","","2014-10-06 18:19:07","","0","245","<p>I am working on a custom credential provider for Windows Vista and up. The goal is to eventually to be able to login using a card read using an NFC reader. This card is currently simulated by a window with buttons. The card can either be ""connected"" or ""disconnected"" and there are 2 buttons: 1 provides correct login information, the other incorrect login information.</p>

<p>The Windows 7 SDK contained a couple of Credential Provider samples, of which the HardwareCredentialProvider sample seemed very close to what I wanted. This sample uses an ""asynchronous"" event to switch between 2 credentials managed by a single provider. I followed this approach. One difference from the example, is that I want to directly login; the card (or in this case: the simulator) provides the login information.</p>

<p>To realize this, I implemented GetCredentialCount as follows: </p>

<pre><code>*pdwCount = 1;

if (CardIsConnected())
{ 
    *pdwDefault = 0;
    *pbAutoLogonWithDefault = TRUE;
}
else
{
    *pdwDefault = CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_NO_DEFAULT;
    *pbAutoLogonWithDefault = FALSE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This directly attempts to login. One of the problems I encountered was the situation where a login fails. In this case, I want the card simulator to consider the card disconnected, and winlogin has to re-enumerate the credentials (to load the non-connected credential).</p>

<p>The way I managed to get this ""working"" now seems a bit shady:
 1. In the ""connected"" credential's ReportResult function I tell the simulator that the authentication process is finished and that the card can now be considered ""disconnected"".
 2. In the provider's advice function I use the ICredentialProviderEvent object's ""CredentialsChanged"" function to let winlogin re-enumerate the credentials. I did this here, because I couldn't find another place to do it (during the login attempt the provider is unadviced and then adviced in the very end)</p>

<p>My <strong>first question</strong> would be: Is this the proper way to do this?</p>

<p>My <strong>second question</strong> involves the mechanism for auto-login: currently this relies on the credential being the ""default"" credential. What happens if multiple providers are loaded, and multiple ""default"" are enumerated? How would I not rely on being the default credential and still have the auto select+login functionality?</p>

<p>Finally (<strong>third question</strong>), I encountered a visual bug when testing the credential provider on Windows 7: When I emulate the event of a card-login with incorrect login information when I already have a tile selected (the default Windows one), I get an error message informing me that my login information is correct (as expected), but something seems to go wrong with reloading the credentials. The proper credentials seem to be loaded (the default Windows one, and my ""not connected"" one), but the Windows one appears to be rendered incorrectly. It only shows the tile, and the tile itself is streched out and placed out of alignment. I'm really unsure what could cause this behaviour, does anyone have any idea?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.  </p>

<p>P.S: I'm implementing the credential provider in C++.</p>

<p>The condition for validation to fail is when I have both <code>h_slat_type</code> and <code>v_slat_type</code> set as <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>In other words if:</p>

<p><code>h_slat_type 1</code> = <code>v_slat_type 1</code> -> true</p>

<p><code>h_slat_type 2</code> = <code>v_slat_type 1</code> -> true</p>

<p><code>h_slat_type 1</code> = <code>v_slat_type 2</code> -> true</p>

<p><code>h_slat_type 2</code> = <code>v_slat_type 2</code> -> false</p>

<p>The JS method:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.validator.addMethod(""typecheck"", function(value, element) {
    return ($('#h_slat_type').val() == $('#v_slat_type').val());
}, ""Horizontal Type 2 and Vertical Type 2 incompatible!"");

Hence, I have chosen to inject the method using an initializer.</p>

<p>The initializer looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>export default {

  initialize: function(container, app) {
    var someFunction = function(message) {

    app.register('function:main', someFunction);

<p>Which i think basically streams the view output from a controller action to a word document....</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult DetailedReport()  
    {            
        //[...]    
        return View();  
    }  


public ActionResult DetailedReportWord()  
    {  
        string url = ""DetailedReport"";  
        return new WordActionResult(url, ""detailed-report.doc"");  
    }  
</code></pre>

<p>And heres the class that extends ActionResult</p>

<pre><code>public class WordActionResult : ActionResult   
{   private string Url { get; set;}          
private string FileName { get; set;}  


public WordActionResult(string url, string fileName)  
{  
    Url = url;  
    FileName = fileName;  
}  

public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)  
{  
    var curContext = HttpContext.Current;  
    curContext.Response.Clear();  
    curContext.Response.AddHeader(""content-disposition"", ""attachment;filename="" + FileName);  
    curContext.Response.Charset = """";  
    curContext.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);  
    curContext.Response.ContentType = ""application/ms-word"";  

    var wreq = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create(Url);  
    var wres = (HttpWebResponse) wreq.GetResponse();  
    var s = wres.GetResponseStream();  
    var sr = new StreamReader(s, Encoding.ASCII);  

    curContext.Response.Write(sr.ReadToEnd());  
    curContext.Response.End();  
}

<p>Which looks pretty good - but my problem is that my view renders from a ViewModel, here is the Action</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]  
    public ActionResult StartSearch(SearchResultsViewModel model)  
    {  
        SearchResultsViewModel resultsViewModel = _searchService.Search(model.Search, 1, PAGE_SIZE);  
        return View(""Index"", resultsViewModel);  
    }  
</code></pre>

<p>and here is my model:</p>

<pre><code>public class SearchResultsViewModel  
{  
[SearchWordLimit]  
public string Search { get; set; }  

public IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; private set; }  
public IEnumerable&lt;Organization&gt; Organizations { get; private set; }  
public PageInfo PageInfo { get; private set;}  

public SearchResultsViewModel()  
{  
}  

public SearchResultsViewModel(string searchString, IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt; employees, IEnumerable&lt;Organization&gt; organizations, PageInfo pageInfo)  
{  
    Search = searchString;  
    Employees = employees;  
    Organizations = organizations;  
    PageInfo = pageInfo;  
}  
}  
</code></pre>

<p>I'm struggling to how NOT having duplicated logic server and client side.</p>

<p>When requesting a page or state of the application, i would prefer to send the complete UI, meaning: not just some javascript, which in turn makes a dozen ajax requests and builds the user interface.</p>

<p>But here lies the problem, the logic deciding what to show or not has to be written once in the server-side and once in the client-side language.</p>

<p>Then i was wondering if it was somehow possible to process your javascript logic server-side and send the whole to the client, who in turn can continue using the application with all the advantages of a responsive ui, but without disadvantage of the initial loading/building of the user interface due dependency of background ajax requests.</p>

<p>I hope the explanation of my problem is a bit clear, because i'm not the most fluent English writer. If you understand what i mean and if you can describe the problem a little better, please do... thanks!</p>

I'm using OpenGL es 2.0, so geometry shader or the gl_FragDepth variable is unavailable for me. I've googled some so I got some insight about the topic and reading this (<a href=""http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Realtime/repetitorium/2010/OmnidirShadows.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Realtime/repetitorium/2010/OmnidirShadows.pdf</a>) proved quite useful. Basically I rely on this linked doc.</p>

<p>But something is wrong with my code, because in the rendered scene every pixel is under shadow. I think the problem can be found in my shaders, but I paste here all my relevant code to see everything clearly.</p>

<p><strong>Setup framebuffer and creating the cubemap:</strong></p>

    float shadowVal = 1.0;

    if (smValue + eps &lt; distance) {
        shadowVal = 0.1; // in shadow
    }

    // here comes the lighting stuff
    // ...

    outputColor =  outputColor * shadowVal;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So again, the issue is that every pixel falls under shadow. From the code I excluded some uniform passes to the shader, but they are ok. Can you give me an advice what should I fix in the code? Are my shaders (especially for the first pass) correct, do I set the transformations for the cube mapping properly? Thank you.</p>

<p>P.S: This is my first question here, I hope it is clear enough and fulfils the requirements of a correctly posted question.</p>

<pre><code>@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
void updateLastFmArtists(Range idRange = null) {

        // We could be updating a lot of artists here, the process could take up

<p>Each individual artist is updated within it's own transaction, which should be rolled back if an <code>IOException</code> is thrown. However, I noticed the following behaviour:</p>

<p>If an attempt to update an artist throws an <code>IOException</code> - causing the transaction to be rolled back - then the update of the next artist always fails due to the following error</p>

<p>If I change the code above so that each artist is updated within it's own session, this seems to fix the problem, </p>

            }

<p>But I don't understand why I need to do this, i.e. why is that rolling back a transaction seems to close the session?</p>

I am using jquery ui sortable to support dragging table rows within a table as well as from one table to another <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists"" rel=""nofollow"">similar to this jquery ui sortable demo</a> (but with many more columns)</p>

<p>The one issue i ran into is that if i have many columns,  I can't seem to support both of these requirements below at the same time:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The requirement to have vertical scrollbar in my table if it exceeds a certain size to avoid a overall page vertical scroll bar</p></li>
<li><p>For ""wide"" pages with many lists I do want a horizontal scroll bar (to avoid wrapping) but when I drag something all of the way to the right, i would like the horizontal scroll bar to scroll along with me so I can drag an item from the first list to the last list all the way to the right without having to directly click on the horizontal scroll bar.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems #2 comes out of the box (as per the jsFiddle below) but if i try to get #1 working, it breaks #2.  I know its possible at some level as i see sites (like trello for example) that support both requirements above but i can't figure out how they are doing it.</p>

right: 0;
top: 10px;

}

.swimTableTbody {
 display: block;
 overflow: auto;  //this is what allows me to have vertical scroll bars on long tables
 width: 100%;
}

.list {
display: inline-block;
width: 300px;
top: 80px;
position: relative;
}

<p>Here is my jquery code:</p>

<pre><code>        $("".sortable"").sortable({

            {
                var $originals = tr.children();
                var $helper = tr.clone();
                $helper.children().each(function(index)
                {
                    $(this).width($originals.eq(index).width());
                });
                $helper.css(""background-color"", ""rgb(223, 240, 249)"");

</code></pre>

<p>Purpose of this script: is to ask the user for numbers, then let the script find the average of the numbers and display it. I made an empty list called values, I append the user input numbers after turning them into integers.</p>

<p>I keep getting UnboundLocalError: local variable 'len' referenced before assignment... even thought I did assign len and sum to the length and sum of the elements in the list.</p>

<p>P.S. I am new to python and usually when I get an error I try to fix it on my own or research it but for this one I really dont understand why I am getting this error... any insights would be appreciated !!</p>

<pre><code>myApp.controller('SearchController',
    function ($scope, UserService) {

        // for intellisense, UserService is undefined here
        var user = UserService.getUsers().then(function(data){
                             // yada yada
                   }, function(err){
                             // yada yada
                   });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>However, in my intellisense file, I can dynamically inject UserService to get its functions like this:</p>

<pre><code>intellisense.addEventListener('statementcompletion', function (event) {
    // tried doing this, but doesn't work!
    // event.target   = {};

    var injector   = angular.injector(['ng', 'myApp']);
    var dependency = injector.get(event.targetName);

    event.items    = [];
    for (method in dependency) {
        intellisense.logMessage(method);
        event.items.push({ name: method, kind: 'field', value: function () { } });
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I have a global variable (or function variable) defined as <code>UserService = {}</code> and inside my controller function I type <code>UserService.</code> I will get a pop up of all the functions in the service. But if I don't have it defined, since it is interpreted as <code>undefined</code> by intellisense, it can't show me the options even though <code>statementcompletion</code> is working (as seen in the Javascript Language Service console). </p>

<p>My question is, apart from annotating the function, is there anyway to define <code>UserService</code> as an object in the intellisense file? Defining <code>event.target = {}</code> does not work (see intellisense code above).</p>

The user enters the their two desired values in two separate forms and the result is returned in a div below.

Till the tests are run (on command prompt), I want the run button to be disabled and want to enable it only when the command prompt is closed.</p>

<p>I have created a .bat file to run the list of tests in command prompt.</p>

<p>The code is as follows:</p>

<p>Thread for invoking command prompt:</p>

<pre><code>class RunMonitor(threading.Thread):
def run(self):
    print 'Invoking the command prompt .....'
    subprocess.call([""start"", ""/DC:\\Scripts"", ""scripts_to_execute.bat""], shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>For Monitoring the thread</p>

<pre><code>def runscript(self):
    print 'Complete_file_Path inside Run script is : ' , self.complete_file_path
    file_operation.Generate_Bat_File(self.complete_file_path)

    run_monitor_object = RunMonitor()
    run_monitor_object.start()

    while True:
        if run_monitor_object.isAlive():
            print 'The thread is still alive....'
        else:
            print 'The Thread is not alive anymore'
            self.run_button.setEnabled(True)
            break
</code></pre>

<p>From the above example, as soon as i invoke the command prompt, I run a while loop to monitor the status and I expect that the thread would be active as long as the command prompt is invoked and would  be dead once I close the command prompt. But in my case, the application just hangs..</p>

<p>Few questions:
1. is this the right way to invoke thread?
2. is this the right way to monitor the status of the thread?
3. is there a better way of handling this ??</p>

<p>Any help towards this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>In Div1 I have some content and in Div2 some other content. There is a splitter in the middle. I need a function to swap the div positions Div1 in Div2 position and vice versa. What as some good ways to do this in Angular directive ?</p>

<p>One way i can think of is using ng-switch, but will have to do some reputable stuff... any other good ways ? Some animation during switching would be cool.</p>

<p>No jQuery allowed. Following is the demo fiddle - <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/gauravsoni/z9gz1wgy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/gauravsoni/z9gz1wgy/</a></p>

<p>Sample code:</p>

<pre><code> angular.module(""KendoDemos"", [ ""kendo.directives"" ])
.controller(""MyCtrl"", function($scope){
  $scope.orientation = ""horizontal"";
  $scope.hello = ""Hello from Controller!"";
})

.directive('myDirective',function(){
    return{
    template:'&lt;div kendo-splitter&gt;&lt;div&gt;1st pane&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2nd pane&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'
}
})
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I am using the following code to do the switching, </p>

<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click='toggle = !toggle'&gt;Switch View&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;div ng-if=""toggle""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        Left side 
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        right side
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div ng-if=""!toggle""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        right side 
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        left side
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So based on the toggle value appropriate div gets activated , only drawback here is i have to write the view 2 times.</p>

<p>The code for lineFunction is:</p>

<pre><code>    var lineFunction = d3.svg.line()
      .x(function(d) { return d.x; })
      .y(function(d) { return d.y; })
      .interpolate(""linear"");
</code></pre>

<p>The data array being passed in and used for yAxisData is:</p>

<pre><code>var seasonsArray = [""Winter"", ""Spring"", ""Summer"", ""Autumn""];
</code></pre>

<p>The intent is to draw four (4) separate horizontal path lines, one for each element of array ""seasonsArray"".</p>

<p>However, this only seems to draw one horizontal path (i.e. the first path line) and seems to ignore all others.  It seems as if the data() binding is not working properly.</p>

<p>You can see the problem in the Scatterplot section titled ""<em>Let's use paths to throw in some grid lines:</em>"", in the following visual example: <a href=""http://bl.ocks.org/Guerino1/raw/9ae1b738088761f135e1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bl.ocks.org/Guerino1/raw/9ae1b738088761f135e1/</a></p>

<p>The full function in the original code which contains the above code snippet is called ""draw6(...)"".</p>

<p>Any thoughts as to what the problem is?</p>

<p>My initial page loads, there's a drop-down menu, the user selects a name and that name is sent over to another page to load it inside of a DIV on the main page.  This all works.  There's an update button:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""updateChanges"" method=""POST"" action=""update.php""&gt;
&lt;input class=""button"" name=""update""&lt;?= $LineID ?&gt;"" type=""submit"" id=""update"" value=""UPDATE""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and when it's clicked, it launches the JavaScript file to do the AJAX call without refreshing the entire page.  </p>

<pre><code>$(function() {

    // Get the form.
    var form = $('#updateChanges');

    // Set up an event listener for the contact form.
    form.submit(function(event) {

        // Stop the browser from submitting the form.
        event.preventDefault();

        // Serialize the form data.
        var formData = form.serialize();

        // Submit the form using AJAX.
        $.ajax({
            type: 'POST',
            url: form.attr('action'),
            data: formData,
            success: function() {
                console.log(""success!"");
            }
        });
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This works too.</strong></p>

<p>What's confusing me now is how to get the ""final page"" to refresh and show the updates that the person has made to the database.  I've tried a variety of things but everything is causing a full page refresh, which I can't have.
<pre><code>
|_______________________________|
|          ajaxtest.php         |
|                               |

|   |                      |    |
|   |______________________|    |
|_______________________________|</p>

<p></pre></code></p>

<p>I need something inside of the success function that allows me to say <strong>""refresh getuser.php?q=John%Done inside of this DIV on ajaxtest.php""</strong> but nothing I've tried works.</p>

<p>I can't do something like this...</p>

<pre><code>success: function () {
setTimeout(""window.location = 'getuser.php'"",100);
</code></pre>

<p>because the original string that I passed is not in this JavaScript file, and that only solves half my problem.  If I just set the code to <code>getuser.php?q=John%Doe</code> it works, but it loads THAT as the main page, not as a page inside the DIV on the primary page.</p>

<p>I'm lost as to how to solve this....</p>

</ul>

<p>So there will be no result since the Calendar control and the Database field are of different types.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see i worked the sqldatasource in code behind and i made the use of <code>Like</code> But even with the use of <code>Like</code> no results show <strong>due to Database having not only date but time too</strong>.</p>

<p>I was also thinking to change the sql query itself, and precisely the field <code>start_date</code>, to omit the time (HH:mm:SS.ms) but is it possible to do so?</p>

<p><BR></p>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>Even if the Calendar Control's selected date and the field in the database are both DateTime, the search won't work because when searching with the Calendar Control its query will be Date and Time example <code>2013-01-01 00:00:00.000</code> while in the DB the time is not always 00:00:00 thus the need of Between as the answer below.</p>

<p>The CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x3b2d70 to COM context 0x3b2ee0 for 60 seconds. The thread that owns the destination context/apartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows messages. This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time. To avoid this problem, all single threaded apartment (STA) threads should use pumping wait primitives (such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles) and routinely pump messages during long running operations.</p>

CUSTOMER(CustomerId,custName,custAddress,accountId), here accountId is foreignKey
and USER(UserId,password,CustomerId) here CustomerId is FK</p>

<p>in which I want to store form data (Like account related information should be inserted in account table, customer's name , address etc should be entered in customer table etc).</p>

<p>I want to implement that first balance, pin , and cardId is inserted in account table then it returns generated accountId in response and then customer details along with accountId should be inserted and so on with user table.</p>

<p><strong>What I have done is:</strong></p>

<p>created an rest api that insert the details of account information and then generate accountNO and send it as a response.</p>

<pre><code>@Path(""myresource"")

<p>Initially, I thought about using a datagrid. However, I can't use a datagrid because of the format of my data visually. </p>

<p>You see anything I am displaying in brackets, {}, are being updated with results after I process some data in the backend. After the data analysis is done, the results are displayed based on an algorithm. </p>

<p>So, let's say for control1, for each family, it would indicate whether the data passed or failed. Then, in the rows themselves, it would update with choice 1 or choice 2 depending on the data generated. </p>

<p>So, the data that is in brackets, are properties that are being updated. I'm not sure what UserControl I can use to accommodate this kind of display. Any ideas or references would be great.Thank you. </p>

<p>So, my question is how can I get the rows to populate automatically with my data that is not static? The data can contain 10 rows or it can contain 70 rows depending on what kind of file the user uploads and that the algorithm in the backend outputs. </p>

<p>What I was thinking and please let me know if this is correct... that I can just bind the fields in the row under Families and next to controls using a Content={Binding boundProperty} where the boundProperty is equal to the bool I have that tells me if the results pass or fail. </p>

<p>And that the rows that are being generated are bound to a list. </p>

<p>Here's a better image to clarify what I want: </p>

I am pretty new at PHP and MYSQL so if you can add little explanations that would be great! If not then I will figure it out!</p>

<p>So each product gets a rating from 1-3. <br>
___________________________________________<br>
Name    |    Softness    |    Warmth<br>
Item 1  |        2       |         1<br>
Item 2  |        3       |         3<br>
Item 3  |       ...      |        ...<br>
...     |       ...      |        ...<br></p>

<p>On the product page it asks the consumer what they are looking for.<br></p>

<p>Softness [menu 1-3]<br>
Warmth [menu 1-3]<br></p>

<p>I want the dropdown menu value to multiply with the column values in the mysql database.</p>

<p>Customer chooses softness: 1 and warmth: 2
Item 1 : 2, 2
Item 2: 3, 6
Item 3: etc
Continues with all products</p>

<p>Then it would display the top 3 items with the highest values. </p>

<p>Question Page:</p>

<pre><code>How important is softness in your product?
&lt;input id=""1"" type=""radio"" name=""softness"" value=""-1.0""&gt;
&lt;label for=""1""&gt;Not very important&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id=""2"" type=""radio"" name=""softness"" value=""0"" checked&gt;
&lt;label for=""2""&gt;Neutral&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id=""3"" type=""radio"" name=""soft"" value=""1.0""&gt;
&lt;label for=""3""&gt;Very important&lt;/label&gt;

How important is warmth in your product?
&lt;input id=""1"" type=""radio"" name=""warmth "" value=""-1.0""&gt;
&lt;label for=""1""&gt;Not very important&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id=""2"" type=""radio"" name=""warmth "" value=""0"" checked&gt;
&lt;label for=""2""&gt;Neutral&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id=""3"" type=""radio"" name=""warmth "" value=""1.0""&gt;
&lt;label for=""3""&gt;Very important&lt;/label&gt;

This is all I got so far...

    &lt;?php

    // Connect SQL 
    include""database/sqlcon.php"";

    // Select Database
    $query = mysql_query(
    ""SELECT * FROM product LIMIT 3""
    );

    if(!$query) {
    die(mysql_error());
    }

    // Get Form Values
    $softness= $_POST['softness'];
    $warmth= $_POST['warmth'];

    while($row = mysql_fetch_array($query)) {
    $productname = $row['product'];
    $productsoft= $row['soft'];
    $productwarm = $row['warm'];

    }

    $totalsoft = $productsoft * $softness; 
     $totalwarm = $productwarm * $warmth;

    mysql_close();

<pre><code>[NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKey:@""name"" ascending:YES

<p>Then, I create a <code>NSFetchResultsController</code> that also has <code>@""name""</code> as its <code>sectionKeyNamePath</code>.</p>

<p>When the locale is English, then letters with diacritical marks are sorted together with their plain letters. For instance, “Å” is treated as “A” for the purpose of sorting. The problem is that this is not taken into account when the fetch results are broken up into sections, so every time the sequence of results changes from “A” to ”Å” or vice versa, a new section is added. Consequently, the <code>NSFetchResultsController's</code> sectionIndexTitles returns an array </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I make it so that names that start with letters that sort together only result in a single section?</p>

<p>Removing diacritical marks from the underlying data that are used to sort is not an option because some other locales treat ”A” and “Å” as separate letters, with “Å” sorted after “Z” in the alphabet.</p>

<p>A <code>NSSortDescriptor</code> with a custom comparator is not an option because Core Data can only use a fixed set of built-in comparators. (This is because they are being translated to SQL for the underlying database.)</p>

<p>As I have read, to send a regular UDP broadcast to the broadcast address, I simply have to send a packet to 192.168.0.255 (in my case 192.168.2.255) or 255.255.255.255. Is this right? Can I use the same port address? Are there any other necessities? </p>

<p>I understand the fact that if my .NET program listens on that particular address it is possible to receive packets from other applications than my C++ server program. Is there any method of ""signing"" the packet on the C++ server-side in order for my .NET program to read the header of the packet and see that it is (almost) the one I am looking for?  </p>

<p>A demo of the form is available <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/iamsajeev/fg10v39n/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>As it is a multiple select box, the user will be able to select any number of values from the select box &amp; it should be saved into the database. So, I declared the select box as an array..like this.</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;select name=""select2[]"" size=""3"" multiple=""multiple""&gt;
         &lt;option value=""11""&gt;eleven&lt;/option&gt;

        &lt;option value=""20""&gt;twenty&lt;/option&gt;     
  &lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But as I told earlier the multiple select box will be generated multiple times as per user's choice, all the datas that are entered should be saved. So I change the name of the selectbox using jquery.</p>

<p>The name of the select boxes will be like select2[]1, select2[]2, select2[]3 and so on (which is invalid; not an array) but it should be like select21[], select22[], select23[] and so on which is a valid way of declaring an array.
I am not able to fetch the array in server side using PHP as follows</p>

<pre><code>if  ($total_count&gt;0)
        {  //echo $total_count;
            for($i=0;$i&lt;=$total_count;$i++)
            {
                // generated as select2[]1,select2[]2,select2[]3 ,... which is not valid.
                // thus invalid argument to foreach
                if($this-&gt;input-&gt;post('select2[]'.$i)){
                $data2=array(

When I hit the route, I get an http basic auth pop up that makes me log in. However, I'm already logged into the page, and would figure that this would be saved.  It's a little annoying to have to log in twice.  Once I've logged in once to the javascript stuff, I don't have to log in again...but why do I even have to do it once?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>To clarify, what is happening is:</p>

<ol>
<li>I log into the rails application with Devise.</li>
<li>I do a variety of admin things on rails, succesfully.</li>
<li>I go to the page that has the OpenLayers map, and draw on the map, which causes javascript to do a GET on a rails route that is admin only.</li>
<li>I get a javascript popup asking me to log in.</li>
<li>I log in, and the javascript works as expected.</li>
<li>If I navigate away from this page and come back later (as long as I don't clear out my browser cache) I can do the javascript admin stuff all day without having to log in again.</li>
</ol>

<p>My confusion is that I don't think I should get that javascript pop up in the first place... Does the rails app and javascript keep separate session/cookie data?  I thought Devise itself just did things by IP? (and thus would see javascript and native rails as identical?)</p>

<p>I have various services which I've built a central login for.  The services can be run off-site by third parties and I handle all the handshakes securely, with the central site always maintaining login state with sessions and session cookies.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that I want to provide a single login tracker across services in my own domain space, such as <em>service1.example.com</em>, <em>service2.example.com</em>, etc, but the session cookies aren't ""sticking"" to the subdomains as intended.</p>

<p>From <em>example.com</em> (or <em>www.example.com</em>), I'm setting:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Cookie: SESSION=12345; domain=.example.com; path=/;
</code></pre>

<p>Then redirecting to the intended service subdomain.</p>

<p>The cookie is NOT being seen at <em>service1.example.com</em>, <em>service2.example.com</em>, ... Because the browser is not SENDING the cookie to those subdomains.</p>

<p>Everything I've read indicates this should work, but it doesn't and I can't do a multitude of parameter passing between host names as a means to transfer session state, it needs to be done as a cookie shared across subdomains.</p>

Referring to the new documentation (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-marketplace/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/apps-marketplace/</a>) I do not see that any SSO requirement exists.  There is allot of talk about migrating to new sign on methods, but I see no mention of sign on requirements.</p>

<p>What are the sign on requirements as of November 19th?</p>

<p>If SSO continues to be required or if I publish before Nov. 19th, my application requires security token from my API, in order to carry out API exchanges.  To get this token a user/pass exchange is required one time.  They would never need to enter a user/pass for my app after that.  Will a one time exchange for the security token be denied under a SSO requirement?</p>

<p>For example the statement regarding SSO that an app cannot do is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The end user should not be required to enter a username and password when invoking an application from within Google Apps.  (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/google-apps/marketplace/sso"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/google-apps/marketplace/sso</a>)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In my case it would not be required for the user to enter every time, just on the initial creation of the account.  After that I would retain the token from my site, encrypted with the Installed App.</p>

<p>Would my app be denied for requiring this one time exchange under the SSO policy?</p>

<p>Rather than duplicate the affected MapRoute() calls and translate the url to Russian, I'm wondering if it's possible to have multiple route collections and select which one MVC will use at runtime based on the subdomain eg; ""ru.""?</p>

<p>Without multiple RouteCollections as we add more and more languages we'll be duplicating more and more routes which will cause maintenance problems and inefficient routing.</p>

<p>By the way, all subdomains leads to the same asp.net mvc application and we use the subdomain element to globalize the resources.</p>

<p>Here is an example route and its Russian translation :</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(
   ""Content"", // Route name
   ""Page/{id}"", // URL with parameters
   new
   {
      controller = ""Content"",
      action = ""Show"",
      id = String.Empty
   } // Parameter defaults
);
</code></pre>

<p>And in Russian :</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(
   ""Content"", // Route name
   ""страница/{id}"", // URL with parameters
   new
   {
      controller = ""Content"",
      action = ""Show"",
      id = String.Empty
   } // Parameter defaults
);
</code></pre>

<p>There are dozens of affected routes and each supported language would duplicate them all. At the moment I think a route constraint on the subdomain would be the best method, but it would be good to have separate route collections for each language, and a shared route for unaffected routes.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how exactly I should arrange this. It is a must that the triggers already exist i.e. I don't want to edit any template files.</p>

<p>So I have to use one of these then:</p>

<ul>
<li>system type </li>
<li>content type</li>
<li>editors type</li>
<li>editors-xtd type</li>
</ul>

<p>Where should I put this plugin? A system plugin might work but then the plugin gets triggered on each page which I find not the best</p>

<p>The content type won't get triggered at all.</p>

<p>The Editors type doesn't work either.</p>

<p>The editors-xtd works but it wants a button back as a return vale and I dont have a button because the plugin is mostly javascript based and automatic</p>

<p>What else can I use?</p>

<p>I then prepare a simple plus-to-minus transform from a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15077637/transforming-a-boost-c-phoenix-expression-tree"">previous question</a>, shown here:</p>

<p>However, when I apply an inverted Phoenix <code>lambda</code> expression, using <code>my_add</code>, to its arguments, as shown below, it seems the intended inversion has not been achieved. Is there a recommended way to implement function calls within Phoenix, which can facilitate such transformations? </p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  auto f =         phoenix::lambda(_a = 0)[my_add(_1,_2)];
  auto g = invrt()(phoenix::lambda(_a = 0)[my_add(_1,_2)]);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; f()(1,2) &lt;&lt; std::endl; // 3

I'd like to do some versioning on how these objects are arranged so that I can implement undo/redo buttons.  </p>

<p>I thought that the <a href=""https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail"" rel=""nofollow"">PaperTrail</a> gem might be a good option for saving a tree structure of how these objects are sorted, but the issue is that when the user rearranges the objects, the position of some objects might change while others do not, and PaperTrail only seems to save versions when the object has been changed.  What I'd really like is something that can save a snapshot of the state of all objects in the model. Is there any way to force PaperTrail to save a version so that I could just call something like</p>

<pre><code>@objects.each do |object|
    @object = object.versions.scoped.last
    @version = Version.find(@object)
    @version.reify.save!
end
</code></pre>

<p>for undoing changes?  Or is there some better way to accomplish this?</p>

<p>For example (I'm sorting 2D arrays):</p>

<p>Before making changes:</p>

<pre><code>name   | position | ancestry
Step 0 |    0     |   0
Step 1 |    1     |  371
Step 2 |    2     |  371
</code></pre>

<p>After making changes:</p>

<pre><code>name   | position | ancestry
Step 0 |    0     |   0
Step 1 |    1     |  371
Step 2 |    2     |  371/374
</code></pre>

<p>After trying to do an undo:</p>

<pre><code>name   | position | ancestry
Step 0 |    0     |   0
Step 1 |    2     |  371
Step 2 |    2     |  371
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how for Step 1, the position should be 1, but since the object didn't change from before and after the rearranging, it reverted to the last saved version that was unique, which is incorrect.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:SqlDataSource ID=""DataSource"" runat=""server"" DeleteCommand=""UPDATE tblLSystem SET LS_Deleted='1' WHERE LS_ID=@LS_ID""
    SelectCommand=""SELECT * FROM vwLSystem WHERE LS_Deleted='0' order by LS_CreatedOn"" OnSelected=""DataSource_Selected"" OnDeleted=""DataSource_Selected"" OnDeleting = ""DataSource_Deleting""&gt;
    &lt;DeleteParameters&gt;
        &lt;asp:Parameter Name=""LS_ID"" Type=""Object"" /&gt;
    &lt;/DeleteParameters&gt;
&lt;/asp:SqlDataSource&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The delete linkbutton template is declared as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:TemplateField HeaderText="""" SortExpression="""" Visible=""True""&gt; 
    &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;
       &lt;asp:LinkButton ID=""btnDelete"" CommandName=""Delete"" runat=""server"" Text=""Delete"" /&gt;
    &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;            
&lt;/asp:TemplateField&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code behind class name is ""class StudLSystemGrid"".  And the DataSource_Deleting event function in this class is:</p>

<pre><code>protected void DataSource_Deleting(object sender, SqlDataSourceCommandEventArgs e)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>This user control is used in another asp.net page.  It is registered in the page as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Register Src=""Controls/LSystemGrid.ascx"" TagName=""LSystemGrid"" TagPrefix=""uc4"" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the same page it is used to create one user control statically like this:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;uc4:LSystemGrid ID=""LSystemGrid1"" runat=""server"" ShowAuditFields=""false"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also need to create multiple user controls depending on the situation dynamically in code behind.  So I have a placeholder in MarkUp page:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;asp:PlaceHolder id=""PlaceHolder1"" runat=""server""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And same codes in code behind to generate the user control:</p>

<pre><code>    ucLControl =
      LoadControl(""Controls/LSystemGrid.ascx"")
      as StudLSystemGrid;
    ucLControl.ID = ""LSystemGridPD"" + i.ToString();
    ucLControl.ShowAuditFields = false;
    ucLControl.SqlDataSource.ConnectionString = ConnectionManager.ConnectionString;
    ucLControl.DataBind();
    PlaceHolder1.Controls.Add(ucLControl);
</code></pre>

<p>The statically generated user control works fine.  Clicking the delete link can invoke the function ""DataSource_Deleting"" mentioned earlier.  However the dynamically generated user control does not work.  The function ""DataSource_Deleting"" is not hit and the item can not be deleted.</p>

<p>The html source for the delete link in statically markup user control is:</p>

<pre><code>       &lt;a onclick=""{alert('There'); return false;} ;"" 
id=""ctl00_PageBody_LSystemGrid1_BaseGrid_ctl02_btnDelete"" 
href=""javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$PageBody$LSystemGrid1$BaseGrid$ctl02$btnDelete','')""&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For dynamically generated user control from code behind is:</p>

<pre><code>       &lt;a onclick=""{alert('Here'); return false;} ;"" 
id=""LSystemGridPD0_BaseGrid_ctl13_btnDelete"" 
href=""javascript:__doPostBack('LSystemGridPD0$BaseGrid$ctl13$btnDelete','')""&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anybody knows what is wrong here?  How can we determine the datagrid is in delete mode when using delete linkbutton in this way in code behind?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Update:  The user control is dynamically generated from -</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    PreRender += LSystem_PreRender;    
}

void LSystem_PreRender(object sender, EventArgs e)

Address <code>0x7fff5fbff700</code> and Address <code>0x7fff5fbff704</code> are supposed to differ by 32bits or 4 bytes. </p>

<p>If I consider each 'element' in the address <code>0x7fff5fbff700</code> as 1 byte, then yes, I can see how the two address differ by 4bytes, but if that is the case then the address <code>0x7fff5fbff704</code> would be 12*4 = 48bytes . How is that even possible?? </p>

<p>What i do not understand, is the fact, that if the score (the difference between upvotes and downvotes) is 0, then the rank is 0. This would mean, that a completely new article with +1/-1 would be ranked in nirvana.</p>

<pre><code>echo calculateRank(1,1,""2015-02-14 12:00:00""); // = 0
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if the score is negative the rank is negative. Which means that a completely new article with a +1/-2 would be ranked even further away then nirvana.</p>

<pre><code>echo calculateRank(1,2,""2015-02-14 12:00:00""); // = -6441.9377111
</code></pre>

<p>The Select Query would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM articles ORDER BY rank DESC 
</code></pre>

<p>According to the results i showed you, that would mean that an 10 year old article with a positive score (eg: 1 upvote / 0 downvotes), would be ranked higher, then EVERY article with a score of 0 or a negative score, no matter of the date. That cannot be right and confuses me.</p>

<p>What i'm looking for is something similar. I already got rid of zero-ranks by do not allowing a score of 0. However, negative scores (eg: 0 upvotes / 2 downvotes) should lower the score instead of inverting it.</p>

<p>Any help is highly appreciated!

<p>What is output as Poly is supposed to be an index for each polygon starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each time, but clearly, it isn't.
Anything I can do to make the loops run more accurately and my  number come up to what they're supposed to would be great.</p>

<p>I found that some records are not appearing in my results with the expected most recent datetime.   So I stripped my query down the basics:</p>

<p>NOTE that <strong>the real-life query does not look at custID</strong>.  I am including it here to narrow down on the problem.</p>

<pre><code>        SELECT
            el.eventID,
            el.custID,
            el.date_event
        FROM  
            event_log el
        WHERE 
            el.custID = 12345 AND
            el.userID=987
        GROUP BY  
            el.custID
        HAVING
            MAX( el.eventID )
</code></pre>

<p>This is returned: </p>

<pre><code>eventID     custID  date_event
346290      12345   2013-06-21 09:58:44
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the EXPLAIN</p>

<pre><code>id  select_type     table   type    possible_keys               key     key_len     ref     rows    Extra
1   SIMPLE          el      ref     userID,custID,Composite     custID  5           const   203     Using where
</code></pre>

<p>If I change the query to use HAVING MIN, the results don't change.. I should see a different eventID and date_event, as there are dozens of records matching the custID and userID.</p>

<pre><code>        SELECT
            el.eventID,
            el.custID,
            el.date_event
        FROM  
            event_log el
        WHERE 
            el.custID = 12345 AND
            el.userID=987
        GROUP BY  
            el.custID
        HAVING
            MIN( el.eventID )
</code></pre>

<p>Same results as before:</p>

<pre><code>eventID     custID  date_event
346290      12345   2013-06-21 09:58:44
</code></pre>

<p>No change.</p>

<p>This tells me I have another problem, but I am not seeing what that might be. </p>

<p>Some pointers would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The actual function I need to integrate (<code>rho</code>) also contains two other factors. <code>rho0</code> is an array with the same length as <code>a_list</code> and <code>b_list</code>. <code>H</code> is a scalar.</p>

<p>Then I've downloaded ""manually"" all the WSDLs from the server, which exposes the web services, into my resource project folder ""<strong>\my-project\src\main\resources\wsdl</strong>"" and all the related XSDs inside my xsd project folder ""<strong>\my-project\src\main\resources\wsdl\xsd</strong>"".
After that I've changed manually all the schemaLocation inside the WSDLs file in order to have only relative path (then running cxf generation the java client stubs are correctly generated). </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Inside a wsdl I've changed:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;xs:import namespace=""http://ws.myproject.priv.schema/MyServiceA/v1"" schemaLocation=""http://161.29.123.124:8080/web-1.0/ws/MyServiceA_v1?myServiceA_v1.0.xsd""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with the relative path (related to the folder \my-project\src\main\resources\wsdl\xsd)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:import namespace=""http://ws.myproject.priv.schema/MyServiceA/v1"" schemaLocation=""xsd/myServiceA_v1.0.xsd""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way (with maven, apache cxf, ant or something else...) to download automatically all the WSDLs and XSDs from the server to my folders and then automatically changing the server paths with my project relative paths?
How can I automate this process?</p>

Of course this would perfectly match a boolean, but oracle has no such datatype. The NUMBER(1,0) type from the database is matched to a java.lang.Short type in Java (sometimes they used a NUMBER(*,0) to represent booleans, which are matched to java.math.BigDecimal). </p>

<p>Since it is somehow obvious, I want to offer ice:selectBooleanCheckbox in the view as a value representation and UIComponent to the user. (I use IceFaces as JSF implementation) </p>

<p>Since some people who specified JSF think it is obvious to always match the value of a ice:selectBooleanCheckbox or in JSF h:selectBooleanCheckbox to a boolean in the model, so the renderer of the component never calls any converter, even if you specify one:
<a href=""http://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES_SPEC_PUBLIC-238"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Issue disscused at java.net"">Issue disscused at java.net</a></p>

<p>Therefore I tried the following: </p>

<p>I created a converter to specify it in the UIComponent: </p>

<pre><code>public class BooleanBigDecimalConverter implements Converter {

   public Object getAsObject(FacesContext context, UIComponent component, String str) {
     if (StringUtils.isEmptyString(str)) {
       return new BigDecimal(0);
     }
     if (str.equals(""true"")) {
       return new BigDecimal(1);
     } else {
       return new BigDecimal(0);
     }
   }

   public String getAsString(FacesContext context, UIComponent component, Object obj) {
     if (obj != null) {
       String str = obj.toString();
       if (str.equalsIgnoreCase(""1"")
       || str.equalsIgnoreCase(""yes"")
       || str.equalsIgnoreCase(""true"")
       || str.equalsIgnoreCase(""on"")) {
         return ""true"";
       } else {
         return ""false"";
       }
     }
     return ""false"";
   }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The converter works fine for the render phase (the getAsString-method is called correctly), but the getAsObject-method (Ignore that it's not correct at the moment, because it's not called anyway, so it will be fixed if it's called!) is never called, because in the renderer of the UIComponent a converter is not foreseen, like you can see here (snip from com.icesoft.faces.renderkit.dom_html_basic.CheckboxRenderer): </p>

<pre><code> public Object getConvertedValue(FacesContext facesContext, UIComponent uiComponent, Object submittedValue)  throws ConverterException
 {
   if(!(submittedValue instanceof String))
     throw new ConverterException(""Expecting submittedValue to be String"");
   else
     return Boolean.valueOf((String)submittedValue);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>So this results in an IllegalArgumentException, since in the UpdateModelValues phase it is tried to apply a Boolean to a numerical value (please ignore the BigDecimal/Short confusion... it is just a numerical type in any case!). </p>

<p>So I tried to overwrite the renderer with a new one like this: </p>

<pre><code>import com.icesoft.faces.component.ext.renderkit.CheckboxRenderer;

 public class CustomHtmlSelectBooleanCheckbox extends CheckboxRenderer {

   public Object getConvertedValue(FacesContext context, UIComponent component, Object submittedValue) throws ConverterException {
   Converter converter = ((ValueHolder) component).getConverter();
   return converter.getAsObject(context, component, (String) submittedValue);  
   }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>and registered it like this in faces-config.xml: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;render-kit&gt;
   &lt;renderer&gt;
     &lt;component-family&gt;com.icesoft.faces.HtmlSelectBooleanCheckbox&lt;/component-family&gt;
     &lt;renderer-type&gt;com.icesoft.faces.Checkbox&lt;/renderer-type&gt;
     &lt;renderer-class&gt;com.myapp.web.util.CustomHtmlSelectBooleanCheckbox&lt;/renderer-class&gt;
   &lt;/renderer&gt;
 &lt;/render-kit&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I guess this should be correct, but the overridden method ""getConvertedValue"" is never called, nor is the getAsObject()-method, so I guess I made a mistake in registering the custom renderer, but I can't find any more documentation or hints how to do this properly and especially how to find the correct component-family (I looked up the one I use in icefaces.taglib.xml) and the correct renderer-type.</p>

<p>I don't want to edit the complete model because of this. Any hints, how this can be resolved?</p>

<p>So overall I've created all the functions and even created a function to call them all on submit, though the only ones that are actually working are the email and the password. It calls to a code that inputs it to the database (which is also working), so that isn't the issue. Where are the validation codes going wrong?</p>

In case something is changing it's good to plug in a newer version and all the applications will update automatically without even noticing. </p>

<p>a) Great for plugins,
b) multiple apps using the same library and
c) maintenance when you need to correct errors.</p>

<p>However, why would anyone use a static library? I mean what's the advantage? Does sb have an example so I can understand it better? Is it to make a product proprietary?</p>

<p>EDIT: Due to the confusion in the comments. I understand what a static library is, and I also know the difference between a dynamic library. It was just beyond me why anyone would use a static library instead of just the source itself. I think I'm now starting to understand that a static library offers the following advantages:</p>

On page load we are making 4 to 5 $http calls to our API Urls. Now the criteria for our project is such that if the API response doesn't have any analytical data present , we need to show ""No Data available."" message. But the problem we have is how do we identify a particular http call belongs to what module. For example if one of the $http calls return 204 - which is no content status, how do we show the  ""No Data available."" for only that particular module ??</p>

<p>Here is our interceptor : </p>

<pre><code>$provide.factory('ErrorHttpInterceptor', function ($rootScope,$q,$location) {
            var errorCounter = 0;
            function notifyError(response) {
                var moduleNAme = response.config.data.module_name;
                $rootScope[moduleNAme] = {};

                switch(response.status) {
                    case 204 : $rootScope[moduleNAme]['errorStatus'] = ""No Data""; break;
                    case 403 : $rootScope[moduleNAme]['errorStatus'] = ""Forbidden""; break;
                    default  : $rootScope[moduleNAme]['errorStatus'] = 'Something went wrong';
                };

                return $rootScope[moduleNAme]['errorStatus'];
            }

            return {
                // On request failure
                requestError: function (rejection) {
                    // show notification
                    notifyError(rejection);

                    // Return the promise rejection.
                    return $q.reject(rejection);
                },

                // On response failure
                responseError: function (rejection) {
                    // show notification
                    notifyError(rejection);
                    // Return the promise rejection.
                    return $q.reject(rejection);
                }
            };
        });

        // Add the interceptor to the $httpProvider.
        $httpProvider.interceptors.push('ErrorHttpInterceptor');

<p>In html : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Data for module 1&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div ng-if=""module1.errorStatus""&gt;{{ module1.errorStatus }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Data for module 2&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div ng-if=""module2.errorStatus""&gt;{{ module2.errorStatus }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The above code actually solves the problem by setting the errorStatus for particualar moduleName. But can we ever get rid of having moduleName. If the moduleName changes in our backend then all our calls get errored.</p>

<p>Is there any other better way to solve this problem? 
What does the angularjs standard suggests?</p>

<p>The difficult part for me is the nonzero entries in the <code>diff</code> matrix. I've accounted for the scaling FFTW does on the values and the padding needed to do an in-place fft on real data; what am I missing?</p>

<p>I find it surprising that the data could be off by a value of 17 (which is 66% of the max value), when there are so many zeros. Also, the data irregularities seem to form a diagonal pattern.  </p>

Idea is to have a button in the navigation bar that will trigger the controller to slide away to reveal a data ""selector"".</p>

<p>Given the following UI structure:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/dTErl.png"" alt=""UI View structure""></p>

<p>The main controller is a UINavigationController as I need to add further levels of information later.</p>

<p>Basically it works like this:</p>

<p>App starts with the data table in foreground. User can click on data or on the top left navigation  item.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vG0el.png"" alt=""Data table visible""></p>

<p>Once clicked on the navigation item, it will move the navigation bar, toolbar and tableView aside to reveal the selector table View:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/8cwJa.png"" alt=""Selector table visible""></p>

<p>The code which moves everything away is:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)toggleAreaSelector:(id) sender {
    float offsetX = self.tableView.frame.origin.x == 0 ? 300 : -300;

    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.3f delay:0 options:UIViewAnimationCurveEaseIn animations:^{
        self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame = CGRectOffset(self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame, offsetX, 0);
        self.toolBar.frame = CGRectOffset(self.toolBar.frame, offsetX, 0);
        self.tableView.frame = CGRectOffset(self.tableView.frame, offsetX, 0);
    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
        self.navigationController.navigationBar.userInteractionEnabled = offsetX == 300 ? NO : YES;
        self.tableView.userInteractionEnabled = offsetX == 300 ? NO : YES;
    }];
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem is:</strong> I cannot click the first item in the selector, ""Area 0"". I think it's because the <code>UINavigationBar</code> still holds a ""touch"" lock to the area and receives all touches. </p>

<p>Perhaps it's also due to the fact that, when visible in interface builder, I can also see my selector view being <em>behind</em> the <code>UINavigationBar</code>. After all, that might be the wrong approach to go?</p>

<p>Thanks for any ideas.</p>

As you'll see, the top 2 visible HTML elements are an image (the text 'Giving What We Can' against a blue background) and a horizontal menu. I want there to be no space between these, but there is, for no reason I can see in the CSS, or in Firebug or Chrome's equivalent Developer Tools. (Here's a <a href=""http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/watch/clh62a57n"" rel=""nofollow"">video of me trying to find the reason in Chrome</a> - I click on one element after the other, and would normally see some margin or padding which explained the gap between the 2 elements highlighted, but as you can see don't.)</p>

<p>Since posting this mattmanser pointed out that removing the margin-bottom of the bottom HTML element (the menu) fixes the problem. My question is now why a bottom margin should cause space above this? (A secondary question is whether are there any better tools than Firebug or Chrome's Developer Tools for spotting these things, as they didn't reveal this.)</p>

<h2>HTML/CSS (skippable)</h2>

<p>You're probably best off examining the HTML and CSS yourself (it's slightly complex, because it's within a Zen-based Drupal theme), but here's a partial sample. The 2 elements are:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""gwwc-logo-header""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""/""&gt;
        &lt;img src=""/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/themes/gwwc2/images/chrome/header/top-blue-header.png"" alt=""Giving What We Can""&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""region region-header""&gt;
  &lt;div id=""block-superfish-1"" class=""block block-superfish first last odd""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>None of these IDs/classes have any margin/padding set that I can see (except that as noted <code>.block</code> has a <em>bottom</em> margin). </p>

<li>Tweak RC4 so <code>K</code> will be a 16 bit number while still using an array of length 255 for <code>S[]</code> (I want to do the crypto right so I am concerned about making mistakes tinkering with RC4.)</li>

which talks about (4,10,19) inline ASM generation as a technique used in Javascript optimisation. </p>

<p>In the following paper:
<a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/juliangamble/Home/Compilers%20Tutorial%202006-09-16.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/juliangamble/Home/Compilers%20Tutorial%202006-09-16.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1</a>
at page 30 and 31 they talk about using scheme to generate ASM that is subsequently linked and executed in a subsequent OS process. </p>

<p>What about the scenario where you want to generate the ASM and execute it inside your existing process? (ie no subsequent link and execute in separate steps). </p>

<p>I <em>assume</em> this comes down to (in C for example) generating the ASM, writing the bytes to an area of memory (code as data) and adding a function header and return (compatible with a C caller (similar to what we see on page 3 of the Goloum paper above). Then we take that data pointer and convert it to a function pointer and call it (code as code - from code as data). </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>(a) What is the terminology for this inline code generation and execution?</p>

<p>(b) Is there a simple 'hello world' C example of this available?</p>

However, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> requires a closing <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag, with all the comprising elements in between, but then the document would not be well-formed, with <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;new-column&gt;</code> being wrongly nested.
One solution would be to add closing <code>&lt;/section&gt;</code> tags like this:</p>

<p>I understand that:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>X-Forwarded-For</code> gives the address of the client which connected to the proxy</li>
<li><code>X-Forwarded-Port</code> gives the port the client connected to on the proxy (e.g. <code>80</code> or <code>443</code>)</li>
<li><code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> gives the protocol the client used to connect to the proxy (<code>http</code> or <code>https</code>)</li>
<li><code>X-Forwarded-Host</code> gives the content of the <code>Host</code> header the client sent to the proxy.</li>
</ul>

<p>These all make sense.</p>

<p>However, I still can't figure out a real life use case of <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code>. I understand the need to repeat the connection on a different port or using a different scheme, but <strong>why would a proxy server ever change the <code>Host</code> header when repeating the request to the target server?</strong></p>

For that purpose, I prepare properly the data, taking into account the alignment and I make use of the compiler directives  <code>#pragma simd</code>, <code>#pragma aligned</code>, <code>#pragma ivdep</code>. When compiling with the several <code>-vec-report</code> options, compiler tells me that loops were vectorized. A quick look to the assembly generated by the compiler seems to confirm that, since you can find there plenty of vectorial instructions that works with packed single precision operands (all operations in the serial code handler <em>float</em> operands).</p>

<p>The problem is that when I take hardware counters with PAPI the number of FP operations I get (<code>PAPI_FP_INS</code> and <code>PAPI_FP_OPS</code>) is pretty the same in the auto-vectorized code and the original one, when one would expect to be significantly less in the auto-vectorized code. What's more, a vectorized by-hand a simplified problem of the one that concerns and in this case I do get something like 3 times less of FP operations.</p>

I want this to go into a MailChimp list I have setup that has an email, first name, and last name. For this particular form, I only want it to send an email and leave the first and last name fields blank. Anyways, after looking at the documentation (I'm not a super pro at this), but I put together the PHP that processes once the form has been submitted. Anyways it doesn't work, the email doesn't get added to my MailChimp list. I even double checked the API Key and List ID. Below is my code that has to do with the MailChimp subscription processing: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

if (isset ($_POST['submitted'])) {
    $email = $database-&gt;escape_value(trim($_POST['email']));

     if (!empty ($email) &amp;&amp; filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL) &amp;&amp; preg_match('/@.+\./', $email)) {
        $session-&gt;save_email($email);
        // Subscribe User to List
        $api_key = ""xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"";
        $list_id = ""xxxxxxxxxxx"";

        $Mailchimp_Lists = new Mailchimp_Lists( $Mailchimp );
        $subscriber = $Mailchimp_Lists-&gt;subscribe( $list_id, array( 'email' =&gt; $email ) );

        if ( ! empty( $subscriber['leid'] ) ) {

    } else {
        redirect_to(""./#hello-"" . $email);
    }
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the ""redirect_to(""./#subcribed"");"" gets called, but nothing is sent to the MailChimp list. Any ideas on why it might not be working?</p>

<p>**EDIT
I removed this:</p>

<pre><code>$Mailchimp_Lists = new Mailchimp_Lists( $Mailchimp );
</code></pre>

<p>And then changed the subscribe function to:</p>

<pre><code>$subscriber = $Mailchimp-&gt;lists-&gt;subscribe($list_id, array('email' =&gt; $email));

<p>Would <code>eval()</code> work? Heard it might do it. How would I implement? I've been working at this for days now and it seems strange there's no simple work around.</p>

<p>During page load, I'm pulling all of the controls on the panel, looping through each one and if it's typeof is radiobutton I add the javascript function to the radio button to run onchange. Based on the radio checked state, the function will show or hide the textbox. I wasn't sure how to tell the function which textbox to hide based on the radio button other than to make my own attribute for the radio button and use that in the page_load. This, to me, is the best solution I've come up with short of in-lining the JS function calls. </p>

<p>But even this isn't working.</p>

<p>Regardless of the functionality of my code, this isn't how I want to do it. I want to get a list or array of radio buttons from the panel  (instead of grabbing all of the controls), and add the function to it. And adding an attribute to the radio button just doesn't seem to be the cleanest way nor does in-lining all the calls. Regardless of the solution path chosen, I still need to know the textbox that I'm hiding or showing that goes along with the radio button. So any and all help, ideas, and wisdom will be appreciated.</p>

//loop through each id and add the functions
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; checks.length; i++) {

<p><a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html""> AUTO_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB</a></p>

<p>particularly this part:</p>

<blockquote>AUTO_INCREMENT column named ai_col: After a server startup, for the first insert into a table t, InnoDB executes the equivalent of this statement:

SELECT MAX(ai_col) FROM t FOR UPDATE;
InnoDB increments by one the value retrieved by the statement and assigns it to the column and to the auto-increment counter for the table.</blockquote>

<p>This is a problem because while it ensures that within the table, the key is unique, there are foreign keys to this table where those keys are no longer unique.</p>

<p>The mysql server does/should not restart often, but this is breaking.  Are there any easy ways around this?</p>

<p>I have a GUI, which I click a pushbutton to make an imellipse. After double clicking the imellipse, an outline is plotted onto my image and the dimensions saved to some matrix. </p>

<p>After double clicking it, resulting in a plot onto my image, I would like the ellipse ring (created from the function) to disappear. It just seems to stick around on the image (is this normal, or should it disappear?).</p>

<p>I can include my code, it just seems irrelevant to the problem (remove imellipse after double clicking).</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
I am using OpenSSL library and linux.
I have a server process P1 accepting SSL connection from SSL client. P1 does tcp_accept() and then SSL_accept() and exchanges some protocol data with client with SSL_read/SSL_write(). Everything is fine till this point. Now by design P1 needs to fork a child process C1 to serve the client from this point onwards. C1 uses execve call to re-image itself and spawn a different binary. C1 still needs to talk to the SSL client over the same SSL connection that was used in P1. The problem is since C1 is a completely different process now how it can re-use the existing SSL connection for that client? I am able to pass the underlying TCP socket descriptor from P1 to C1 as it is maintained in kernel but I can not pass the SSL context since it's maintained in the Openssl Library. </p>

<p>I saw this tread on stackoverflow but unfortunately no solution is mentioned.
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12426246/openssl-accept-tls-connection-and-then-transfer-to-another-process?"">OpenSSL: accept TLS connection and then transfer to another process</a></p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution:</strong>
I am not sure if anybody has already solved this kind of problem but I tried following.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I thought I can just create a new SSL conctext and do SSL renegotiation in the new child process. So in C1 I created a new SSL context over the same underlying tcp socket fd and tried to do SSL renegotiation. Here is what I did (Omiting the SSL_ctx initialization part)</p>

<p>ssl = SSL_new(ctx) // ctx is initialized the same as it was done in P1 server<br>
SSL_set_fd(ssl, fd); // fd is the underlying tcp socket fd passed from P1 to C1<br>
SSL_set_accept_state(ssl);<br>
SSL_set_verify(ssl, SSL_VERIFY_PEER | SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT, 0);<br>
SSL_renegotiate(ssl);<br>
SSL_do_handshake(ssl);<br>
ssl->state=SSL_ST_ACCEPT;<br>
SSL_do_handshake(ssl);  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>But the renegotiation does not succeed and returns me an Openssl Internal error from first SSL_do_handshake() call. I am not even sure if this can really be done. The other solution that I can think of is following.</p>

<ol>
<li>Somehow transfer the whole SSL context for that client from P1 to C1. How efficiently this can be done? I can think of shared memory for this but not really sure about what all internal state OpenSSL maintains that needs to copied into the shared memory. 
This seems to be the most logical solution but I don't have much insight into OpenSSL code to do this. </li>
</ol>

<p>Has anybody faced similar problem and solved it?
I will really appreciate any help regarding this.  </p>

The entity class is nothing but the <code>DataContract</code>. This entity class is quite complex and has properties of various types, some properties are collections too. Of course, those linked types are also DataContracts. </p>

<p><strong>I want to serialize that DataContract entity into XML</strong> as part of business logic of my web service. <strong>I cannot use <code>DataContractSerializer</code> directly (on the object I receive in the web method) simply because the XML schema is altogether different.</strong>  So the XML generated by DataContractSerializer will not get validated against the schema. </p>

<p>I am not able to conclude the approach I should follow for implementation. I could think of following implementation approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>LINQ to XML</strong> - This looks ok but I need to create XML tree (i.e. elements or XML representation of the class instance) manually for each type of object. Since there are many entity classes and they are linked to each other, I think this is too much of work to write XML elements manually. Besides, i'll have to keep modifying the XML Tree as and when the entity class introduces some new property. <strong>Not only this, the code where I generate XML tree would look little clumsy (at least in appearance) and would be harder to maintain/change by some other developer in future; he/she will have to look at it so closely to understand how that XML is generated.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>XmlSerializer</strong> - I can write my own entity classes that represent the XML structure I want. Now, I need to copy details from incoming object to the object of my own classes. <strong>So this is additional work (for .NET too when code executes!).</strong> Then I can use <code>XmlSerializer</code> on my object to generate XML. In this case, I'll have to create entity classes and whenever third party entity gets modified, I'll have to just add new property in my class. (with XmlElement or XmlAttibute attributes). <strong>But people recommend <code>DataContractSerializer</code> over this one and so I don't want to finalize this unless all aspects are clear to me.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>DataContractSerializer</strong> - Again here, I'll have to write my own entity class since I have no control over the third party DataContracts. And I need to copy details from incoming object to the object of my own classes. So this is additional work. However, since DataContractSerializer does not support Xml attributes, I'll have to implement <code>IXmlSerializable</code> and generate required Xml in <code>WriteXml</code> method. <strong>DataContractSerializer is faster than XmlSerializer, but again I'll have to handle the changes (in WriteXml) if third party entity changes.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Which approach is best in this scenario considering performance too?</li>
<li>Can you suggest some better approach?</li>
<li>Is <code>DataContractSerializer</code> worth considering (because it has better performance over <code>XmlSerilaizer</code>) when incoming entity class is subject to change?</li>
<li>Should LINQ be really used for serialization? Or is it really good for things other than querying? </li>
<li>Can XmlSerializer be preferred over LINQ in such cases? If yes, why?</li>

<p>What I need for it to do from this point is copy two specific columns from each of the spreadsheets starting with ""GenLU"" and paste them into sheet 2 of the corresponding spreadsheet. </p>

<p>For example column C &amp; E need to be copied from ""GenLU_Calgary_2008"" to the second sheet in the corresponding spreadsheet ""LUZ_Summary_Calgary_2015"". The code needs to somehow match up the spreadsheets using the name (in this case Calgary) and it needs to do this for all the spreadsheets. </p>

<p>Sorry for the extremely long question, but I'm hoping some can help a VBA newb out. I've searched quite a bit and while I have found the code to copy from sheet to sheet or workbook to workbook I am having trouble achieving what I need to. Any help will be much appreciated!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Context</strong> </p>

<p>I am new to iOS dev, so please forgive me if I am missing something obvious. I am creating a custom range slider, and now I am at the point where I would like to display the value from the slider to the user in the UI as the user drags the knob. </p>

<p>For background, I have completed <a href=""http://www.raywenderlich.com/76433/how-to-make-a-custom-control-swift#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a> and am now attempting to take the values printed in the console and convert them into a readable string to display to the user. The values are printed via this function:</p>

<pre><code>func rangeSliderValueChanged(rangeSlider: RangeSlider) {        
    print(""Range slider value changed: (\(rangeSlider.lowerValue) \(rangeSlider.upperValue))"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is called in <code>viewDidLoad</code> in the <code>ViewController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    view.addSubview(rangeSlider)

    rangeSlider.addTarget(self, action: ""rangeSliderValueChanged:"", forControlEvents: .ValueChanged)        
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>ValueChanged</code> is in an override of <code>continueTrackingWithTouch</code> in <code>RangeSlider.swift</code>:</p>

<pre><code>override func continueTrackingWithTouch(touch: UITouch,
    withEvent event: UIEvent?) -&gt; Bool {
    // .. other stuff

    self.sendActionsForControlEvents(UIControlEvents.ValueChanged)
    return true
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>My Attempt</strong></p>

<p>At this point I figured the way to solve this was to add a text field in the view, then update the text field with the value from the slider. </p>

<p>I created a text field in <code>viewDidLoad</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var lowNumber: UITextField = UITextField(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200.00, height: 40.00))

override func viewDidLoad() {

    lowNumber.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor()
    lowNumber.text = ""some string""
    lowNumber.borderStyle = UITextBorderStyle.Line

    self.view.addSubview(lowNumber)

    // .. more stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I tried to change the text field string in the <code>rangeSliderValueChanged</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>func rangeSliderValueChanged(rangeSlider: RangeSlider) {
    lowNumber.text = rangeSlider.lowerValue
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Error</strong></p>

<p>At this point I encountered an error which states: </p>

<p><code>Cannot assign a value of type 'Double' to a value of type 'String?'</code></p>

<p>Double is used in the <code>RangeSlider</code> class such as:</p>

<pre><code>class RangeSlider: UIControl {
    // .. stuff

    var lowerValue: Double = 0.2 {
        didSet {
            updateLayerFrames()
        }
    }

    // .. more stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is where I am stuck, and the googling I have done on converting a double to a string has left me wondering how I could apply those solutions to my case. More fundamentally, I am wondering if I am approaching the problem in the right fashion.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How do I solve the problem of displaying the value from the slider to the user? Do I need to use a different type of layer than <code>UITextField</code>? Have I approached the problem correctly, or would you recommend a different approach? </p>

<p>I have a Zend Server free edition installed, and if I'm right it embeds directly Zend Debugger.
running phpinfo() command I can see a Zend Debugger section:
<a href=""https://www.diigo.com/item/image/2kz5e/mjri"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.diigo.com/item/image/2kz5e/mjri</a></p>

<p>Now if I try to debug a php web page it does not stop at breakpoints and if I click on ""Test"" button on the Zend Debugger run page inside Eclipse, it show me this error:
""A timeout occurred when the debug server attempted to connect the following client hosts/IPs:-127.0.0.1""</p>

<p>I can't understand what I missed.
Please help me!!!</p>

<p>So far, I've progressed to using this:</p>

<pre><code>window.x = $('#x');
</code></pre>

<p>Now of course, that puts it into the global scope, but according to my convention, that's ok.</p>

<p>But the problem with that is that looking at window.x doesn't convey to me that it's a cache variable of $('#x').  So now what I'd like to experiment with is using a jQuery plugin technique to store these values.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>;(function($, window, undefined) {
    $.fn.x = function() {
        return $('#x');
    }
})(jQuery, window);
</code></pre>

<p>That way, I can reference $x.val() and it will immediately convey to me that $x is a cache of the $('#x') DOM element.</p>

<p>Q: How would I create a plugin called x that is the return value of the $('#x') selector?
Am I doing it right?  Now, you might say (in your best Office Space voice over) ""This is a horrible idea"", but I'm just experimenting.</p>

I suspect the recursive function has something to do with it... </p>

<p>do I read a bit about using the LoaderManager with SQLite and saw <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/8900310/1056359"">Alex Lokwood's answer</a> about implementing the CursorLoader and using it, and I saw the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/11017646/1056359"">this answer</a> about using a CursorLoader directly to an SQLite DB instead of a ContentProvider and started using commonsware's <a href=""https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-loaderex"" rel=""nofollow"">Loaderex</a>.</p>

<p>I created this class for showing the data in a ListView:</p>

<pre><code>public class LandingPageActivity extends FragmentActivity implements LoaderCallbacks&lt;Cursor&gt; {
    ListView list;
    SimpleCursorAdapter mAdapter;

    private SQLiteCursorLoader loader = null;

        list.setAdapter(mAdapter);
        getSupportLoaderManager().initLoader(0, null, this);

        loader = new SQLiteCursorLoader(c, db, query, null);
        return loader;
    }

    @Override
    public void onLoadFinished(Loader&lt;Cursor&gt; arg0, Cursor arg1) {
        mAdapter.changeCursor(arg1);

    @Override

</code></pre>

<p>the problem starts when the database is changed from a 'BroadcastListener' while the activity is still running.</p>

<p>basically what I'm looking for is real-time observing of the database changes but it seems (also from the <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/LoaderManager.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Android Documentation</a> that I need to call the <code>restartLoader</code> function when I want to re-query the db).</p>

<p>is there a way to automate re-query behind the scenes? </p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE:</em></strong></p>

<p>My initial thought was to create a function that restarts the loader, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static void restartLoader(Context context){
    context.getSupportLoaderManager().restartLoader(0, null, LandingPageActivity.this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>but it seems crud and not the best way of doing this.</p>

<p>So I have a few questions,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this a bug in PHP? Couldn't this lead to a false sense of security if someone, for example, thought they were creating a really high number of bits only to realize that they misspelled <code>4096</code> as <code>4O96</code> (with a capital 'o') and it defaulted to 1024 bits, or if it used something like md5 instead of really awesome digest method because they misspelled its name? Or is this somehow by design?</p></li>
<li><p>What options does PHP use if invalid ones are provided with this function?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any way to <strong>verify</strong> the parameters that were used in <code>$options</code> to make sure that nothing got messed up along the way like this? <strong>Edit</strong> I see that for the number of bits and the key type are in <code>openssl_pkey_get_details()</code>, but not the digest algorithm. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>In Spring Data 1.4.3.RELEASE, adding methods to find by unique attributes is very easy but, I haven't found a way to do it with delete.<br><br>
In the following code, Spring automagically handles the <code>findByAddress</code>, <strong>is there something similar for delete?</strong>
<br>
Something like  <code>void deleteByAddress(String hwAddress);</code>, I have added it to <code>TerminalRepository</code> but it doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>public Terminal {
 @Id
 @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)

<p><br></p>

<pre><code>public interface TerminalRepository extends

}

<p>Of course it is possible to find the entity by <code>address</code> and then use the <code>delete(Terminal)</code> method passing the found entity as parameter. But this wouldn't be good in terms of performance as it will be making one unnecessary call to the database database, i.e., one avoidable call to find the object and another one to delete it</p>

I found the <code>robotparser</code> module in the standard library, which should do exactly this. I'm using Python 2.7.2. Unfortunately, my code won't load the <code>'robots.txt'</code> files correctly, and I can't figure out why.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant snippet of my code:</p>

<pre><code>from urlparse import urlparse, urljoin
import robotparser

def get_all_links(page, url):
    links = []
    page_url = urlparse(url)
    base = page_url[0] + '://' + page_url[1]
    robots_url = urljoin(base, '/robots.txt')
    rp = robotparser.RobotFileParser()
    rp.set_url(robots_url)
    rp.read()
    for link in page.find_all('a'):
        link_url = link.get('href')
        print ""Found a link: "", link_url
        if not rp.can_fetch('*', link_url):
            print ""Page off limits!"" 
            pass
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>page</code> is a parsed <a href=""http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"" rel=""nofollow"">BeautifulSoup</a> object and <code>url</code> is a URL stored as a string. The parser reads in a blank <code>'robots.txt'</code> file, instead of the one at the specified URL, and returns <code>True</code> to all <code>can_fetch()</code> queries. It looks like it's either not opening the URL or failing to read the text file.</p>

<p>I've tried it in the interactive interpreter, too. This is what happens, using the same syntax as the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/robotparser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> page.</p>

<p>The line <code>print rp</code> should print the contents of the <code>'robots.txt'</code> file, but it returns blank. Even more frustrating, <a href=""http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/robotparser/"" rel=""nofollow"">these</a> <a href=""http://effbot.org/librarybook/robotparser.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">examples</a> both work perfectly fine as written, but fail when I try my own URL. I'm pretty new to Python, and I can't figure out what's going wrong. As far as I can tell, I'm using the module in the same way as the documentation and examples. Thanks for any help!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong> Here are a few more lines from the interpreter, in case <code>print rp</code> was not a good method to check if <code>'robots.txt'</code> was read in. The <code>path</code>, <code>host</code>, and <code>url</code> attributes are correct, but the entries from <code>'robots.txt'</code> have still not been read in.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; rp
&lt;robotparser.RobotFileParser instance at 0x1004debd8&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(rp)
['__doc__', '__init__', '__module__', '__str__', '_add_entry', 'allow_all', 'can_fetch', 'default_entry', 'disallow_all', 'entries', 'errcode', 'host', 'last_checked', 'modified', 'mtime', 'parse', 'path', 'read', 'set_url', 'url']
&gt;&gt;&gt; rp.path
'/robots.txt'
&gt;&gt;&gt; rp.host
'www.udacity-forums.com'
&gt;&gt;&gt; rp.entries
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; rp.url
'http://www.udacity-forums.com/robots.txt'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> I have solved this problem by using <a href=""http://nikitathespider.com/python/rerp/"" rel=""nofollow"">this external library</a> to parse <code>'robots.txt'</code> files. (But I haven't answered the original question!) After spending some more time in the terminal, my best guess is that <code>robotparser</code> cannot handle certain additions to the <code>'robots.txt'</code> spec, like <code>Sitemap</code>, and has trouble with blank lines. It will read in files from, e.g. Stack Overflow and Python.org, but not Google, YouTube, or my original Udacity file, which include <code>Sitemap</code> statements and blank lines. I'd still appreciate it if someone smarter than me could confirm or explain this! </p>

<p>I could directly use the Android Emulator (from Android SDK) with Selenium Webdriver apk or with mobile Chrome but tests are crashing most of the time, emulators don't respond and I have to restart it. Also, I need to test on the largest possible scope, not limited to Android devices.
Chrome on desktop is a lot more stable and even if a test fails, chrome always respond and can be closed automatically by Intern.</p>

<p>I tried a workaround with the ""--enable-touch-events"" flag and with a custom userAgent but it's producing weird behaviors. Maybe some other flags would help me ?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your answer. </p>

However, the EditText I used for the layout always brings up a full alphanumeric keyboard even though I specified imeType of number. I don't want an alphanumeric keyboard. Heck, I don't even want the +/- type options. Just 0-9 and a ""Done."" How can I have my EditText for the search use a custom keypad? Is there a way to do a dropdown keyboard? I was hoping to write a custom IME just for that field, but it appears that is not permitted.</p>

<p>I am interested only in the field 1000000000</p>

<p>I browsed the stackoverflow for similar questions on xml parsing and then i also searched in google, i did not find any solution.</p>

<p>I read python docs -- [http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.XML]</p>

<p>and tried to frame some logic using the functions findall(), iterfind() ... Nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>How to extract quota field from the above atom feed (xml).</p>

<p>Please note, i tried ElementTree's parse function, i got an error. I can not use that function. I get the response from restAPI as feed. I am allowed to save it as file and then parse it. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>In my app, I send a request to my server for the URLs of the images I need to download and some meta data. I then need to store these images on disk. Once they are saved I have to update view. Storing on disk is also necessary for offline view so maybe I'll even have to store the file path to CoreData.</p>

<p>I think I can just use NSURLConnection to retrieve the image urls, then the images and then write them to disk. My concern is what should I do when the app is waiting for all this to occur? How do I know when to update, for example, a table? What if the user moves away and the view unloads? Just looking for advice. </p>

<p>Should I create a separate NSObject class to handle all this?</p>

<p>PS: How would I check for an existing internet connection before I do any of this anyway?</p>

<p>I use Sequel Pro on OSX to run a lot of queries some of which can take, e.g. >8 hours. A lot of times I can't predict how long a job will take, however. I was wondering if there was a way either in MySQL in general, OSX, MySQLWorkBench, or Sequel Pro to set up a pop-up alert/e-mail/ANYTHING that will alert me to when the query is complete. This might sound like an odd request but it would be extremely helpful to know as I like to do other tasks when my jobs are running in the background.

<em>I know how to capture the image and to add them to the activity</em>, this already works, in a <strong>non efficient</strong> nor <strong>elegant</strong> way, and I would like to improve that.</p>

<p>Right now, I have <code>Button</code> with an <code>onClick</code> method that attaches an image to an empty <code>ImageView</code>, and and keeps track of how many images have been attached, because I can delete an image in order to pick a new one.</p>

<p>I'm wondering the best strategy, code-wise for future changes.</p>

<p>Options that I have considered but I have not (yet) implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Button</code> adds the image to a <code>GridView</code> so I can add and remove images from it's adapter instead.</li>
<li>The <code>ImageView</code> can attach and remove image from itself by <code>onClick</code> and therefore remove the <code>Button</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestions, ideas, strategies, thoughts?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>EDIT 1: my first approach to improve the code</h2>

<p>I've implemented a <code>GridView</code> with a custom adapter (<code>GridImageAdapter</code>)</p>

<pre><code>public class GridImagesAdapter extends BaseAdapter{
    private List&lt;Bitmap&gt; images = new ArrayList&lt;Bitmap&gt;();
    private int img_height;
    public GridImagesAdapter(Context context, List&lt;Bitmap&gt; imagenes){
        this.imagenes = imagenes;
        inflater = (LayoutInflater) context.getSystemService( Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE );
        DisplayMetrics metrics = context.getResources().getDisplayMetrics();
        img_height = (int) (metrics.density * Constants.ONE_ROW_IMG_HEIGHT);
    }
    /*
     * other common methods
     */
    @Override
    public View getView(int position, View row, ViewGroup parent) {
        ViewHolder holder;
        if(row == null){
            row = inflater.inflate(R.layout.grid_img_item, parent, false);
            holder = new ViewHolder();
            holder.image = (ImageView) row.findViewById(R.id.img_add_in_grid);
            holder.image.setLayoutParams(new GridView.LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, img_height));
            holder.image.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
        }else{
            holder = (ViewHolder)row.getTag();
        }
        holder.image.setImageBitmap(getItem(position));
        row.setTag(holder);
        return row;
    }

    private class ViewHolder{
        ImageView image;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I can populate my <code>GridView</code> in the activity like:</p>

<pre><code>private void populateGridView(){
    Bitmap a;
    a = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.no_image);
    images.add(a);
    images.add(a);
    images.add(a);
    images.add(a);
    GridImagesAdapter adapter = new GridImagesAdapter(this, images);
    mGridView.setAdapter(adapter);
    mGridView.setOnItemClickListener(new GetImage());
}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>new GetImage()</code> is an <code>OnItemClickListener</code> who takes care of the image capture itself, and replaces one of the <code>R.drawable.no_image</code> Bitmap 
(no relevant code in there, just showing a <code>Dialog</code> to the user in order to choose from camera or gallery and start such <code>Activity</code>, and then in the <code>onActivityResult</code> method where I have a <code>Bitmap</code> to work with is where I handle the adapter change)</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is more about <strong>the strategy</strong> chosen here than the actual code itself.
Drawbacks? Any more elegant or proper way to achieve the same result?</p>

<p>Everything is welcome, thank you for your answers.</p>

<p>Long Story:</p>

<p>Okay, so I'm creating an application that lists vehicles stored in a database. I have a JavaScript class called Car that is instantiated for each car listing. The class contains default values for everything (make, model, year, color, price, etc) and has a function to use a jQuery ajax request to have my php return the actual values for the car. I pass it with JSON and have a consistent naming convention, so my xhr object in my success function is basically a copy of the car object, only with the correct values. I'm trying to find a simple way to give the xhr object's properties to the car object without manually specifying all 30 options (I know it's doable, but I'm sure there must be a better method, and i'm always up to learn)</p>

<p>Short Story:</p>

<p>How can I use object-x's properties to overwrite object-y's when they have the exact same list of defined properties and both already exist?</p>

<p>Although my site is still far from done, I've started thinking about web security.  This site will be extremely public and contain important information people assume is true, that I wouldn't want hijacked. It'd be a disaster is this site got hacked, so I started thinking of some ways to protect it, or fight back.</p>

<p>Everything has been made with dynamic html through PHP, except for error messages, which use javascript popup alerts triggered by PHP cookies. There are textbox forms and dropdown boxes, all encased with htmlentities to prevent code from being run.</p>

<p>So I started thinking, ""what are the ways that my site's security could be compromised, what weapons of choice do hackers use?"" </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I know about changing the source code of the site with tools like firebug or chrome for themselves, but that shouldn't matter because I use PHP, and I'm more worried about what EVERYONE sees.</p></li>
<li><p>They can use javascript injections</p></li>
<li><p>They could submit code to execute to the forms</p></li>
<li><p>They could DDoS the site, which would crash it and to which I don't know of any defense. But I really don't think I'd be dealing with a entire faceless group of internet megaterrorists.</p></li>
<li><p>They could change the html of email submission forms to get my password sent to me (them).</p></li>
<li><p>They could bruteforce my password for the server/ftp, but I use strong passwords by using all types of characters on a US keyboard.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the ways can I protect my site from being hacked? What are all the ways (or general tactics and categories) that hackers choose to destroy or exploit sites? </p>

<p>Are any of the things from the list of defense traps a good or possible idea?? </p>

I'm trying to accomplish the same thing this guy wanted in this article <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27300001/is-out-there-any-rest-api-for-tfs-2013-on-premises-installation"">here</a>.
I used the example stated in the answer (https://{yourserver}/defaultcollection/_apis/git/repositories?api-version=1.0 ) in an angular http get request but I'm getting a 401 error saying the credentials i supplied were not valid. </p>

<p>I then downloaded curl and supplied the following command ""curl -u username:password http://{myserver}/defaultcollection/_apis/git/repositories?api-version=1.0"" and the result came back the same, html saying i do not have valid credentials. Can someone point me in the right direction so I can pull the projects root branch and childrens branches and data along with it?</p>

<p>Essentially I am searching for a way to pull data from the server and display it on my web app. I'll need branches names and history for each branch and child branch. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>So I'm now able cURL into this service using the --ntlm switch that Richard recommended. Now to actually get my app connected to the service I found that I could pass windows credentials using:</p>

<pre><code>withCredentials:true
</code></pre>

<p>It no longer gives me a 401 error. Instead I am not getting a new error stating:</p>

<pre><code>XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://{servername}/{defaultcollection}/_apis/projects?api-version=1.0. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8080' is therefore not allowed access.
</code></pre>

<p>What are my next steps to get this working?</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>I took what Richard suggested and created my own asp.net web api to communicate with tfs. I was able to modify the web.config file to allow CORS. I added the following lines to the system.webServer section of the file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;httpProtocol&gt;
   &lt;customHeaders&gt;
      &lt;add name=""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"" value=""*"" /&gt;
   &lt;/customHeaders&gt;
&lt;/httpProtocol&gt;

<pre><code>LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(getActivity());       
for (int i = 0; i &lt; dataList.size(); ++i)
{
    DataEntry dataEntry = dataList.valueAt(i);

    _table.addView(row);
    row.setTag(""dataRow"");

    // Code that looks up the 'column' views and sets their value to the dataEntry
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is working great and populates the list just fine. But when I am changing data sets I want to clear out all the added rows <strong>except</strong> the header (first) row and then add in a new set of rows (ie run the code above). So I have this little bit of code:</p>

<pre><code>final int childCount = _table.getChildCount();
for (int i = 1; i &lt; childCount; ++i)
{
    View view = _table.getChildAt(i);
    _table.removeView(view);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the most simple version of this loop I could do. I was originally checking for null views because they showed up on resuming the task. I would then check to see if the tag for the view was == ""dataRow"" and only remove the data rows. But this all gives me the same result. It will skip the header (I am starting at 1 instead of 0) and remove the next row and then every other row from there on down. If I run this loop enough times it Will clear the list but adding a while(_table.getChildCount()>1) just seems like I am clearly just doing this wrong. _table.removeAllChildren() will not work as the header is then removed as well (And it likes to rip apart view hierarchies which is also not what I want done).</p>

<p>I am just not seeing what it is I am doing wrong. I am hoping a second (or second hundred) set of eyes may see the flaw in my thinking.</p>

<p>I have two projects, one of which is a DLL, the other is an EXE.  The DLL contains a Windows ServiceInstaller and ServiceBase classes.

<blockquote>
  <p>type=""Fully qualified class name, assembly file name, version, culture, public key token""</p>

<p>which is what's usually called the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">assembly-qualified class-name</a>, but in the example further down the same page the value is merely the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.fullname.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">fully-qualified class-name</a> (ie. it doesn't specify the assembly):</p>

<p>So my question is: </p>

<p><strong>Does the type attribute have to be an assembly-qualified class-name, or is it sufficient to set it to the fully-qualified class-name?</strong></p>

<p>The class I'm referencing is in the System.Configuration.dll.</p>

<p>I'm hoping I don't have to specify the assembly of the class because then I have to specify the version number, which I don't know at build-time.  I'm therefore hoping that the documentation is incorrect and that it's safe to merely specify the fully-qualified class-name.  My tests indicate that the fully-qualified class-name is sufficient, but I'm reluctant to release this into production without being sure that it's allowed.</p>

<pre><code>var user_id = JSON.parse($cookies.userdata).id;
</code></pre>

<p>I imagine an unsavory visitor could continuously use their browser to change their id and access resources they shouldn't. This is a huge red flag and I could use some help shoring this up. <a href=""https://stormpath.com/blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-node-dot-js-sessions/"" rel=""nofollow"">This looks like a solid enough guide</a>, but I haven't quite wrapped my mind around the different pieces. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What exactly is stored in the cookie if I use Mozilla's client-session? Anything I want? I have API routes such as <code>GET /api/v1/user/:user_id</code> to return information about a user. If the cookie is encrypted on the browser I'll lose the ability to access the current <code>user_id</code> and make this API call. What would be my plan of action? Create a proxy server-side to this API that will first unencrypt the cookie, extract the <code>user_id</code>, and <em>then</em> call <code>GET /api/v1/user/:user_id</code>? The API routes are protected by a function that checks is <code>req.isAuthenticated() === true</code>, if that helps at all. </p></li>
<li><p>Given the above, at what point does session come into play? Assume I'm storing user sessions in MongoDB. We know that cookies can only store 4kb, but what if that's enough? What kind of data <em>should</em> be stored in the cookie and what kind of data should be stored in the user's session?</p></li>

<p>Your answers will go a LONG way towards clearing up some concepts that have been a bit of a black box to me. </p>

Let's say what they are encrypted with is called ENCRYPTION #1.</p>

<p>What has to be done is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up the requested file and save the content in a variable.</li>
<li>Decrypt the content of the variable via PHP (ENCRYPTION #1 to plain text).</li>
<li>Encrypt the plain text again but this time using ENCRYPTION #2 (Plain text to ENCRYPTION #2).</li>
<li>Create a new .txt file with the content encrypted with ENCRYPTION #2.</li>
<li>Send the now with ENCRYPTION #2 encrypted .txt file back to Host A as requested.</li>

<h2>What I tried so far:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I changed the driver type of the session to database, giving me an id and payload column. Using <code>\Session::getId()</code> returns a 40 character string. 
The cookie information, sent by the WebSocket-Connection does contain a XSRF-TOKEN and a laravel_session, both containing > 200 characters string. The database ID of the users session differs from the id, returned by <code>\Session::getId()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I am already sending the current CSRF-token via the websocket message, but I have no clue how to verify it (the built-in verifier uses requests - which I don't have in the websocket server scope).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Generic Use case:</h2>

<p>A User posts a comment in thread. The payload of the sent object would then be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Something to verify the user (an ID or a token).</li>
<li>The comment itself</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were to send the user ID, anyone could temper the packet and send the message under another ones user.</p>

<h2>My use case:</h2>

<p>A user can have <em>n</em>-characters. A character has an avatar, an id, a name, etc.
The user is only used to:</p>

<ul>
<li>authenticate at the server.</li>
<li>access his characters, and thus perform basic CRUD operations on his characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a table <strong>locations</strong> - a ""virtual place"", a character can be in... so I got a one-to-one relationship between <strong>character</strong> and <strong>location</strong>. The user (character) can then send messages in a location via websocket. The message is inserted at the database on the server. At this point, I need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the user is authenticated (csrf-token ?)</li>
<li>If the user is the owner of the character (it's very simple to spoof the request with another user's character id)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need more information, please let me know.</p>

<p>I have modified the example code as follows:</p>

<p>The resultant HTML has a ton of <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> tags responding to each element except they are never translated to the right position, but instead sort of sit on top of each other on the top left corner. By investigating in Firebug, I figured this happens presumably because the pack() algorithm does not get the objects one at a time, but the whole array as a single element, thus individual elements don't get .x and .y values. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IOpOw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If I change the <code>.nodes()</code> argument to <code>datagraph.children</code> I get the elements one at a time in nodes() iteration, but oddly enough I get a single <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> object. Since I don't need to flatten a hierarchy I skipped the <code>classes(root)</code> function, in the example. What I am wondering is whether or not the <code>packageName</code> attribute plays any role in the nodes()?  </p>

<p>How can I resolve this issue?</p>

<p>If signal 1 is a matrix of size <code>130X9</code> and signal <code>2</code> is another matrix of size <code>122X12</code> and they look the same .. so what I need is to scale one of them to the other, so both of them can be of size <code>130X9</code>  or <code>122X12</code>.</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt;
struct ListNode
{

<p>However, I ran into memory problems while using the linked list. I found out that the memory is not freed when deleting nodes inside the list but I cannot figure out why since the element is obviously removed from the list. In addition, the memory is always freed when deleting the last node of the list. I am using the following destroy method for deleting elements in the list:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;

            delete root;
            root = tmp;

    }

    ListNode&lt;T&gt; *tmp = getNode(index - 1);
    ListNode&lt;T&gt; *toDelete = getNode(index);

    delete toDelete-&gt;data;
    delete toDelete;

    lastIndexGot = index-1;

<p>If I delete all elements with the method above so that the list is empty, the memory is fully freed. However, the list is used in the client quite frequently with add/delete operations but it gets never emptied completely.</p>

<p>Btw. I am storing pointers to objects in the list like Strings.</p>

<p>This confuses me, because I don't understand why someone would create a variable of type Animal to store an object of type Cat.  Why wouldn't a person simply write this:</p>

Is there ever a good reason to store a <code>Cat</code> object in an <code>Animal</code> variable vs. a <code>Cat</code> variable?  Can a person give me an example?

        LabyrinthProtocol prot = new LabyrinthProtocol();


        while (socket.isConnected()) {
</code></pre>

<p>ServerNachricht is a class that consists of a type(int), a sender(player) and a message(String).
When the thread gets a new game message, the protocol changes the players status-value to ""searching"", then looks if another ""searching"" player exists and then changes both players values to ""playing"" and returns a new ServerNachricht of type Kampfbeginn with the found player as sender.
After the protocol returns the outputLine, this is what the thread does:</p>

<pre><code>                    if (outputLine.getArt() == ServerNachricht.KAMPFBEGINN) {
                    System.out.println(outputLine.getSender().getSname()+"" ist da"");    
                    server.kampfbeginn(this, outputLine.getSender());
                }
</code></pre>

<p>The sysout just verifies that the protocol has actually found another player and is printing that players name to be sure. So far, this has always worked.
Here are the parts that call for a new game in the server:</p>

<pre><code>    public void kampfbeginn(LabyrinthThread t, Spieler gegner) {
    KampfThread kampf = null;
    System.out.println(gegner.getSname()+"" anerkannt"");
    for(int i = 0;i&lt;threads.size();i++){
        if(threads.get(i)!=null){
            System.out.println(threads.get(i).getSpieler().getSname());
            if(threads.get(i).getSpieler().getSname().equals(gegner.getSname())){
                LabyrinthThread gegnert = threads.get(i);
                kampf = new KampfThread(t,gegnert);
                t.setKampf(kampf);
                gegnert.setKampf(kampf);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This code searches through every existing thread (the server stores them in a vector) and checks if that threads connected player is the player returned by the protocol. When the thread was found, both threads are then given to a newly created thread that stores both of them while also storing that new thread in both threads.
The new thread even verifies the connection with two sysouts:</p>

<pre><code>    public KampfThread(LabyrinthThread spieler1, LabyrinthThread spieler2) {
    super();
    this.spieler1 = spieler1;
    this.spieler2 = spieler2;
    System.out.println(spieler1.getSpieler().getSname() + ""ist drin"");
    System.out.println(spieler2.getSpieler().getSname() + ""ist drin"");

}
</code></pre>

<p>which I also get every time.
After both connections are established, that thread sends a message to both threads so that they will notify their programs to start:</p>

<pre><code>        case(ServerNachricht.KAMPFBEGINN):
        spieler1.ThreadNachricht(new ServerNachricht(ServerNachricht.KAMPFBEGINN,spieler2.getSpieler(),""""));
        spieler2.ThreadNachricht(new ServerNachricht(ServerNachricht.KAMPFBEGINN,spieler1.getSpieler(),""""));
        break;
</code></pre>

<p>which calls this method in the threads:</p>

<pre><code>    public void ThreadNachricht(ServerNachricht s) {

    if(socket.isConnected()) {
        try {
            out.writeObject(s);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The strange thing is that this works absolutely perfect about 80% of the time (so both programs go into the ""game started"" mode) but sometimes it just works for one or even neither program and the server gets either a
Connection reset by peer
or a
Socket closed
error in</p>

<pre><code>    public void ThreadNachricht(ServerNachricht s) {

    if(socket.isConnected()) {
        try {
            out.writeObject(s);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>in the out.writeObject(s); line. There is no line anywhere that closes anything (I've even taken out every single close() out of anywhere to make sure that nothing can interfere) and there seems to be no pattern at all to when it works and when it doesn't (and not working closes the servers and the programs clientsocket so the program is unable to work when that happens). Is there any way I can guarantee that my program works or is there any error I made? I am rather desperate because I couldn't even do major tests to find out a pattern since starting the program twice with exactly the same setup still causes it to work most of the time.</p>

<p>Edit: I literally just had a situation in which one player went into the new game mode while the other one stayed in the main menu (resulting in a Connection reset by peer: socket write error for the server) twice in a row before it worked the third time without any problems in the same run. So I searched with both players but only one went into the game screen (and the other one got the error). I then pressed back to go into the main menu and did the same again with the same result. When I tried for the third time, it worked and both players got into the game screen and started interacting with each other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Context 0x15eec0 is disconnected.  No
  proxy will be used to service the
  request on the COM component. This may
  cause corruption or data loss. To
  avoid this problem, please ensure that
  all contexts/apartments stay alive
  until the application is completely
  done with the RuntimeCallableWrappers
  that represent COM components that
  live inside them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like this is caused by my GUI thread calling functions in the COM thread without necessary syncronization.  For reference I'm using the guidelines set in <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229609%28VS.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229609%28VS.80%29.aspx</a> for creating my GUI thread in the COM component.</p>

<p>My code looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>class COMClass {
  // this is called before SomeMethod
  public void Init() {
    ComObject comObject = new ComObject(); // this is imported from a TLB

    // I create my GUI thread and start it as in the MSDN sample
    Thread newThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(delegate() {
      Application.Run(new GUIForm(comObject));
    }));
  }

  public void SomeMethod(){
    comObject.DoSomething();               // this is where the error occurs
  }
}

class GUIForm : Form {
  ComObject com;
  public GUIForm(ComObject com) {comObject = com;}

  public void SomeButtonHandler(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    comObject.SomeMethod();  // call on the GUI thread but the com object is bound to the COM thread...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there an established method for dealing with this? Calls to the GUI are no problem (Invoke/BeginInvoke) but calling the other way seems to be more difficult...</p>

<p>edit: It is also not an option to modify the COM object in any way.</p>

            &lt;td class=""field""&gt;field to know&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the jquery code :</p>

<pre><code>$( "".editRow"" ).click( function() {
    var rowToEdit = $(this).parent().parent();
    var field = rowToEdit.children("".field"")
    rowToEdit = .replaceWith( ""&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\
        &lt;td&gt;\

well, but I'd like to disable the stars when a user has voted.</p>

<p>Currently my users select their rating and click the mouse.  This
updates my database through an AJAX call.  The star rater changes to
show the user's selection, with the stars displayed in red.  However
if the user rolls their mouse over the stars they are still active and
they can submit another vote.  I'm stopping this duplicate voting
server side, but from a usability point of view I'd like the stars to
be disabled after the user's click.</p>

<p>(I guess I could reload the div or something with JQuery to show a
read only version of the stars, but I was hoping there was some more
elegant and simpler solution).</p>

As I start to get into real self-program server, I encounter several problems which I tried to Google but no resources seemed to be helpful, so, yeah, I'm here to ask. Please help me understand these and be a node developer:</p>

<p>1) As I've experienced, there is <strong>only 1 server file</strong> <code>server.js</code> run through nodejs as server. Started as a PHP developer, I am not familiar with how it works, like, if you have, in term of PHP, process.php, rank.php, whatever.php which processes different tasks, I just need <strong>to</strong> send those data to according server file, but in nodejs case, I can only have 1 server.js file, then how can I ever <strong>handle different tasks</strong> from a single server file? Is there anyway to create more than just 1 server file? (I really don't want to mess up a single file with many parameters to perform different tasks and make the file size significantly big!)</p>

<p>2) Let's say, the first problem solved, now it leads to another problem. I've been trying some tutorials about database management, like mysql, or mail (which requires me to enter my Email password),... but as I notice, I entered <strong>the password</strong> required into a javascript file?!?!? I tried <code>localhost/server.js</code> and the file <strong>is publicly available</strong>... Is that something I really need to worry about?</p>

<p>3) Now as I advance further with familiarize myself with <strong>nodejs</strong> with php functions, such as mail, encrypting... I need to install different modules for different tasks, and I imagine one day if I host it online, I have to re-start installing those again? I am just wondering why there isn't any <strong>standard functions</strong> like in PHP. Of course, this is a personal question.</p>

<p>4) I would like to ask you please help me to throw a few lines of code (I just need it to the very basic) of how to send request, receive data like the code below does, but in nodejs. It would help me a lot in abstractly understanding how nodejs really works.</p>

<p>[index.html]</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: ""process.php"", //Which address should I send to if I use nodejs
    type: ""POST"",
    data: ""p=test""
}).done(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});
</code></pre>

<p>[process.php]</p>

<pre><code>die($_POST[""p""]);

<p>I would like to test Android applications using <strong>ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2</strong>.

<p>As you can see, I make use of Robotium framework and I followed their FAQs and tutorials to set all this up (especially: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/robotium/wiki/RobotiumForAPKFiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/robotium/wiki/RobotiumForAPKFiles</a>)</p>

<p>I am using a specialised <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/the-missing-android-xml-junit-test-runner/"" rel=""nofollow"">Instrumentation Runner</a>, which is able to write the results in a xml file and seems suitable for my needs; here is my Manifest file:</p>

<p>What I have tried/achieved so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>The apps I would like to test are third party apps, so I re-signed them with my debug key. (works)</li>
<li>Since I would like to test different apps, I implemented the generation of Java file containing the test cases on the phone; so by button click a <code>*.java</code> file holding all my tests (constructor, setUp(), testNdefPush0() ... testNdefPush100(), tearDown() ) and a suitable <code>Manifest.xml</code> is generated on the phone. Then these files are pulled to a PC, compiled (ant clean, ant debug, ant install -r /path/to/target.apk) in a test project and installed on the phone</li>
<li><p>I can run tests using adb shell:</p>

<p>adb -d shell am instrument -w -r -e class de.nfc.tests.NfcTestCase -e junitOutputDirectory /mnt/sdcard/ de.nfc/pl.polidea.instrumentation.PolideaInstrumentationTestRunner</p></li>
<li><p>in case the test data are valid, instrumentation works and generates a xml file having the results on sdcard.</p></li>
<li><p>in case the test data is invalid (see example) Instrumentation crashes and does not continue with the following tests:</p>

<p>INSTRUMENTATION_RESULT: longMsg=java.lang.NullPointerException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{se.anyro.nfc_reader/se.anyro.nfc_reader.TagViewer}: java.lang.NullPointerException</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How can I achieve, that tests, which failed are logged as failed, and JUnit continues with the following tests.</p>

<p>I found here a similar question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10738686/android-junit-test-suite-hangs-after-activity-throws-nullpointerexception-in-one"">Android JUnit test suite hangs after Activity throws NullPointerException in one test case</a>, but no replies so far :(</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced in testing (third) party apps by passing test data via an <code>Intent</code> to them and can share/provide me some advice/experience?</p>

<p>I do hope I made the problem clear, cause it is quite complex setup and I hope I mentioned all relevant facts for someone not familiar with the topic (you know forest and trees ;) )
If not, don't mind to ask, I'll try to explain :D</p>

<p>1.How much HTML should the plugin have written and how much should it create through jQuery ?</p>

<p>Is it good to have written all of the HTML so that the entirety of the markup structure is visible when looking over the code ?</p>

<p>Or is it better to have written only the minimum amount of HTML so that it is very easy for the user to add/modify content and create all of the rest, bulky HTML through jQuery ?</p>

<p>Is there a recommended practice ? How are things done in professional plugins ?</p>

<p>Why should things be done in a certain way and what are the reasons behind it ?</p>

<p>2.How to balance the plugin options with the CSS ?</p>

<p>Should the plugin offer options that would affect the presentation of the plugin (options that would modify the stylesheet) or is it a better practice to have the user directly modify the stylesheet for presentational modifications and in the plugin only have options relating to the functionality ?</p>

<p>What are some guides regarding what options to offer in the plugin as to not step over CSS ?</p>

<p>Regarding my experiences, I have seen all of these in different places and plugins and that is why I am asking for opinions from experienced users and what are good practices and why.</p>

<p>What am I missing? Do I have to add some special XML configuration file or add another Configuration Class somewhere? Or do I have to update application.properties in order to sth.? </p>

"22556599","1","22628987","","2014-03-21 10:47:08","","7","377","<p>My question is about the conditional test in trial division.  There seems to be some debate on what conditional test to employ.  Let's look at the code for this from  <a href=""http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Primality_by_trial_division#C"" rel=""nofollow"">RosettaCode</a>.</p>

<pre><code>int is_prime(unsigned int n)
{
    unsigned int p;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    /* comparing p*p &lt;= n can overflow */
    for (p = 3; p &lt;= n/p; p += 2)
        if (!(n % p)) return 0;
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Wheel factorization or using a predetermined list of primes will not change the essence of my question.</p>

<p>There are three cases I can think of to do the conditional test:</p>

<ol>
<li>p&lt;=n/p</li>
<li>p*p&lt;=n</li>
<li>int cut = sqrt(n); for (p = 3; p &lt;= cut; p += 2)</li>
</ol>

<p>Case 1: works for all n but it has to do an extra division every iteration (<strong>edit: actually it does not need an extra division but it's still slower.  I'm not sure why.  See the assembly output below)</strong>.  I have found it to be twice as slow as case 2 for large values of n which are prime (on my Sandy Bridge system).</p>

<p>Case 2: is signficantly faster than case 1 but it has a problem that it overflows for large n and goes into an infinitive loop.  The max value it can handle is </p>

<pre><code>(sqrt(n) + c)^2 = INT_MAX  //solve
n = INT_MAX -2*c*sqrt(INT_MAX) + c^2
//INT_MAX = 2^32 -&gt; n = 2^32 - c*s^17 + c^2; in our case c = 2
</code></pre>

<p>For example for uint64_t case 2 will go into an infinite loop for x =-1L-58 (x^64-59) which is a prime.</p>

<p>Case 3: no division or multiplication has to be done every iteration and it does not overflow like case 2.  It's slightly faster than case 2 as well.  The only question is if <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22546534/accuracy-of-sqrt-of-integers"">sqrt(n) is accurate enough</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Can someone explain to me why case 2 is so much faster than case 1?</strong>  Case 1 does NOT use an extra division as I though but despite that it's still a lot slower.</p>

<p>Here are the times for the prime 2^56-5;</p>

<pre><code>case 1 9.0s
case 2 4.6s
case 3 4.5s
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code I used to test this <a href=""http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/69497863a97d8953"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/69497863a97d8953</a>.  I also added the functions to the end of this question.</p>

<p>Here is the assembly output form GCC 4.8 with -O3 for case 1 and case 2.  They both only have one division.  Case 2 has a multiplication as well so my first guess is that case 2 would be slower but it's about twice as fast on both GCC and MSVC.  I don't know why.</p>

<p>Case 1:</p>

<pre><code>.L5:
  testl %edx, %edx
  je  .L8
.L4:
  addl  $2, %ecx
  xorl  %edx, %edx
  movl  %edi, %eax
  divl  %ecx
  cmpl  %ecx, %eax
  jae .L5
</code></pre>

<p>Case 2:</p>

<pre><code>.L20:
  xorl  %edx, %edx
  movl  %edi, %eax
  divl  %ecx
  testl %edx, %edx
  je  .L23
.L19:
  addl  $2, %ecx
  movl  %ecx, %eax
  imull %ecx, %eax
  cmpl  %eax, %edi
  jae .L20
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the functions I'm using to test the time:</p>

<pre><code>int is_prime(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t p;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    /* comparing p*p &lt;= n can overflow */
    for (p = 3; p &lt;= n/p; p += 2)
        if (!(n % p)) return 0;
    return 1;
}

int is_prime2(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t p;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    /* comparing p*p &lt;= n can overflow */
    for (p = 3; p*p &lt;= n; p += 2)
        if (!(n % p)) return 0;
    return 1;
}

int is_prime3(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t p;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    /* comparing p*p &lt;= n can overflow */
    uint32_t cut = sqrt(n);
    for (p = 3; p &lt;= cut; p += 2)
        if (!(n % p)) return 0;
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Added content after the bounty.</strong></p>

<p>Aean discovered that in case one saving the quotient as while as the remainder is just as fast (or slightly faster) than case two.  Let's call this case 4.  The following following code is twice as fast as case 1.</p>

<pre><code>int is_prime4(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t p, q, r;
    if (!(n &amp; 1) || n &lt; 2 ) return n == 2;

    for (p = 3, q=n/p, r=n%p; p &lt;= q; p += 2, q = n/p, r=n%p)
        if (!r) return 0;
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why this helps.  In any case there is no need to use case 2 anymore.  For case 3, most versions of the <code>sqrt</code> function in hardware or software get the perfect squares right so it's safe to use in general.  Case 3 is the only case that will work with OpenMP.</p>

I'm a programmer, but I've never done Objective-C. I stumbled upon an <a href=""http://www.moszi.net/dev/?p=17"" rel=""nofollow"">interesting question</a> that involves dynamic typing. It should be elementary, I've tried it and compiled it, but I'm still not sure how and why it works.</p>

<p>The question is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What happens at compile time and runtime when you do the following:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>NSString *s = [NSNumber numberWithInt:3];
int i = [s intValue];
</code></pre>

<p>In the debugger I get</p>

<pre>
i = (int) 3
s = (__NSFCNumber*) 0x383 (invalid address)
</pre>

<p>The output of <code>NSLog(@""%d"",i)</code> is <code>3</code>, and the output of <code>NSLog(@""%@"",s)</code> is <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>Can someone give me an explanation of how all of this is handled by the compiler and the runtime system by also trying to keep in mind that I'm completely new to Objective-C and Cocoa, but not at all new to computer science?</p>

Comskip is a command line tool and I'm having a AHK script executing the Comskip commercial stipping normally through <code>cmd.exe</code>. Works fine, but lately I started using Unicode characters (star-rating) in the filenames and as you all know these won't display especially good in the console.</p>

<p>Investigation led me to Powershell ISE which is supposed to support Unicode. Running Comskip from ISE proved to be quite challenging. It works fine if typing in everything manually, but the problem starts when calling it from an another script. </p>

<p>Now the problematic part is if using the code calling the ordinary Powershell console it all went fine. But the same code calling the ISE fails and I can't see why. Can any of you? The error message I get doesn't give any explicit clues on what went wrong. The error message only says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Usage: <code>powershell_ise.exe</code> or <code>powershell_ise.exe fileName.ps1</code></em></p>

<p>The AHK line calling the ISE looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>latest_file := ""C:\Program\Comskip\q.ts""

<p>I'm using Visual Basic, but so far I've been able to follow C# and just translate into VB.</p>

<p>I would like collision without tiles. Smooth movement without any sort of snapping. I already have the movement down, and my sprites stop at the edges of the screen.</p>

<p>I've read I could use Bounds and Intersects, which I have tried. When I apply an IF statement to the arrow keys each time they are pressed, using Bounds and Intersects (I just prevent sprite movement if it is intersecting), it works for ONE key. I move left into an object, and I stop. If I apply the IF to all keys, it will work the first time. Say I move left into an object, the IF statement checks if the Intersects is true or not and acts accordingly.</p>

<p>Now I want to move right, away from the object. I can't since my sprite is ALREADY colliding with the object, since each arrow key is programmed to NOT move if there is Intersection. I see perfectly why this happens.</p>

<p>The code I currently have: (Each arrow key has the same code, altered to it)</p>

<pre><code>If Keyboard.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).IsKeyDown(Keys.Right) And rBlockBounds.X &lt;= 
    graphics.GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Width - rBlockBounds.Width = True Then


            If rBlockBoundBoxBounds.Intersects(rObstructBounds) Then

                rBlockBounds.X += 0
                rBlockBoundBoxBounds.X = rBlockBounds.X - 1
            Else

                rBlockBounds.X += 1
                rBlockBoundBoxBounds.X = rBlockBounds.X - 1
            End If
        End If
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p><code>rBlockBounds</code> is my sprite As Rectangle</p></li>
<li><p><code>rBlockBoundBoxBounds</code> is another Rectangle (1 pixle bigger than rBlockBounds) used as a Hit Box more or less that moves with rBlockBounds, and is the thing doing the collision checking</p></li>
<li><p><code>rObstructBounds</code> is the stationary object that I'm moving my Sprite into.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone have suggestions on how I can make this work?</p>

<p>Here's how it looks:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LH2eh.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The tooltip is added by inserting a DIV inside the slider handle.</p>

<pre><code>function sliderCreate(desc) {

    var tooltip = $('&lt;div class=""ui-slider-tooltip""&gt;' + desc + '&lt;/div&gt;');

    $(this).find('.ui-slider-handle').append(tooltip);
}

<p>As you can see the tooltip is currently aligned to the left hand handle edge. This is a problem when the handle is moved to the right hand side of the slider.</p>

<pre><code>.ui-slider-tooltip
{
    .BorderRadius(0.3rem);
    background-color:@dkBlueBG;
    color:#fff;

    padding:0.3rem;
    position:absolute;
    left:0;
    bottom:2.9rem;
    white-space:nowrap;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm looking to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>centre the tooltip to reduce the overhang;</li>
<li>move the position of the tooltip as the slider is moved past the halfway mark (align it to the right hand edge)</li>
</ul>

"25147121","1","25169977","","2014-08-05 19:49:45","","0","101","<p>I am having trouble understanding some unicode, which I am scraping from web pages that users populate via web forms. At the end of it, I want to use NLTK to tokenize and process the scraped text, but unwanted characters are getting in the way. I am unable to figure out how to remove these.</p>

<p>I start by using selenium webdriver to fetch the web pages, extract text content, and print to a file:</p>

<pre><code>driver.get(URL)
HTML = driver.page_source
soup = bs(HTML) [s.extract()
[s.extract() for s in soup(['style', 'script', '[document]', 'head', 'title'])]
text = soup.getText()
outFile.write(text)
outFile.close()
</code></pre>

<p>(The s.extract() comprehension, followed by soup.getText() was recommended by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/2950621/nmgeek"">nmgeek</a>
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1936466/beautifulsoup-grab-visible-webpage-text"">in response to a different stackoverflow posting</a>.) The resulting files look good when I use 'cat &lt;outFile&gt;', but show special characters as bullets, •, ® and ™, which turn out to be problematic. (There doubtless are others.)</p>

<p>First, when I try to remove those bullets prior to printing to original outFile, using</p>

<pre><code>clean = re.sub(r'•', r'', text)
outFile.write(clean)
</code></pre>

<p>I  have no success; the bullets remain.</p>

<p>Second, I read in the &lt;outFile&gt;s thus produced for post-processing with NLTK. Using</p>

<p>raw = open(textFile).read()
   tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(raw)</p>

<p>the bullets show up in the raw string, and remain as unwanted tokens following the word_tokenize() step. If I print the tokens, these code points(?) appear as '�\x80�'.</p>

<p>I've tried to remove the bullets using a comprehension of the form</p>

<pre><code>words = [w.lower() for w in nltk.Text(tokens) \
         if w.lower() not in ['•', '®', '™']]
</code></pre>

<p>but the special characters remain.</p>

<p>I doubt that conversion to bytes is the way to solve this, but perhaps there is something helpful in this information. (See Solution / Work-around below, however.) When I encode these as utf-8 and latin-1 the results are:</p>

<pre><code>In [8]: '�\x80�'.encode('utf-8')
Out[8]: b'\xc3\xaf\xc2\xbf\xc2\xbd\xc2\x80\xc3\xaf\xc2\xbf\xc2\xbd'
In [9]: '�\x80�'.encode('latin-1')
Out[9]: b'\xef\xbf\xbd\x80\xef\xbf\xbd'
</code></pre>

<p>And just pasting in the bullets found in the text files, I get these byte representations:</p>

<pre><code>In [10]: '•'.encode('utf-8')
Out[10]: b'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\xa2'
In [11]: '•'.encode('latin-1')
Out[11]: b'\xe2\x80\xa2'
</code></pre>

<p>Python's repr() function doesn't seem to provide any clarity:</p>

<pre><code>In [35]: repr(tokens[303:309])
Out[35]: ""['�\\x80�', 'Wealth', 'of', 'outdoor', 'recreational', 'activities']""
</code></pre>

<p>I've been through the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Python 3 Unicode Howto</a> a few times, but can't figure out how to make sense of this combined information.</p>

<p>It's possible to include their source, but then there is a problem with versions, as there are two options: add version to file name, but then all includes will have version appended to file name, which will cause trouble when you will update version. If version isn't specified in file name it's not clear what version is, but it's not that big problem, as you can go inside js source and see it's version.</p>

<p>Another option is to link to libraries hosting url, but it'll add additional overhead to download them and when external host will be unreachable, your site won't be able to load that library.</p>

<p>There seem to be maven plugins for some js libraries, but they are usually 3rd party and frequently they refer to outdated versions.</p>

<p>The ideal solution will be something maven-like but with official support.</p>

<p>Also as a comment advises it's possible to use some sort of bundling, but bundling happens after building, so it's still a question how to keep those js libs before bungling.</p>

<p>Please advise.</p>

"1278697","1","","","2009-08-14 15:59:31","","2","2277","<p>I'm part of a team tasked to revamping our old VB6 UI/COBOL database application to modern times.  Before I was hired, the decision was made (largely on sales, I'm sure) to redo the UI before the database.  So, now we're using WPF and MVVM to great effect, it's been amazing so far, especially using CSLA as our Model layer.</p>

<p>However, because our development is side-by-side with the next version of the old product, we're constrained a bit.  We can't make any changes (or minimal changes) to the calls made to the COBOL database.  This has been fine so far, albeit pining back to the glory days of SQL Server if you can believe it.</p>

<p>Where I've hit a particularly nasty roadblock regarding our BO design is in dealing with ""light"" business objects returned in lists and their ""full"" counterparts.  Let me try and construct an example:</p>

<p>Let's say we have a person object in the DB with a bunch of fields.  When we do a search on that table, we don't return all the fields, so we populate our lite object with these.  These fields may or may not be a subset of the full person.  We may have done a join or two to retrieve some other information specific to the search.  But, if we want to edit our person object, we have to make another call to get the full version to populate the UI.  This leaves us with two objects and attempting to juggle their state in 1 VM, all the while trying to keep the person list in sync on whatever parent object it sits after delete, edit, and add.  Originally, I made our lite person object derive from ReadOnlyBase&lt;>.  But now that I'm dealing with the same list behavior you'd have with a list of full BOs except with half full, half lite, I'm thinking I should've just made both the lite and full versions derive from BusinessBase&lt;> and simply made the lite version setter properties private.</p>

<p>Has anyone else out there come across and found a solution for this?  After sleeping on it, I've come up with this potential solution.  What if we wrap the full and lite version of our BO in another BO, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class PersonFull : BusinessBase&lt;PersonFull&gt;
{
  ...
}
public class PersonLite : BusinessBase&lt;PersonLite&gt;
{
  ...
}

public class Person : BusinessBase&lt;Person&gt;
{
  public PersonFull PersonFull;
  public PersonLite PersonLite;
}
public class PersonList : BusinessListBase&lt;PersonList, Person&gt;
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously everything would be CSLA registered properties and such, but for the sake of brevity they're fields there.  In this case Person and PersonList would hold all the factory methods.  After a search operation PersonList would be populated by Person objects whose PersonLite members were all populated and the PersonFull objects were all null.  If we needed to get the full version, we simply tell the Person object to do so, and now we have our PersonFull object so we can populate the edit UI.  If the Person object is to be deleted, we can easily do this with the CSLA delete procedures in place, while still maintaining the integrity of our lists across all the VMs that are listening to it.</p>

<p>So, I hope this made sense to everyone, and if anyone has a different solution they've successfully employed or criticism of this one, by all means!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

                    &lt;p&gt;YES is an organization founded by youth for youth to help make a positive change within society. By supporting a large variety of organizations both big and small within the community, youth not only get the opportunity to explore their interests, but are able to gain a voice in society. If you are interested, our weekly meetings will begin in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;We strive to provide youth (anywhere within Peel) with new experiences, help youth explore their interests, provide opportunities for them to socialize with other youth and provide them with activities to do which will help them in gaining volunteer hours. We will most likely have weekly meetings where we will discuss issues regarding a specific topic, which will be different every month! We will work together to create awareness about these topics by doing activities related to the topic and fundraising for an organization that supports or represents the topic. YES is a great way to gain your 40 hours and get exposure to many amazing organizations and activities!&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I'm reading the data as JSON generated via Rails backend, and so far everything works fine.  I'm trying to write a <code>tagFile</code> function in my Ember route that tags a file with a specific tag.  This works fine on the ember side but of course it doesn't persist, and I can't figure out how to send the proper HTTP request to the Rails backend.  So I have</p>

<pre><code>App.FilesRoute = Ember.Route.extend
  ...
  actions:
    tagFile: (file, tag) -&gt;
      file.get('tags').pushObject(tag)
      tag.get('files').pushObject(file)
      # file.save() ? or something similar?
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried <code>file.save()</code>, which sends a PUT request, but the sent <code>params</code> hash in Rails does not include the <code>Tag</code> record at all.  I set a breakpoint in the <code>updateRecord()</code> method inside ember-data, and examined the <code>data</code> variable before it gets sent via AJAX, and this variable does not include the <code>Tag</code> record either.</p>

<p>What is the correct way to send an HTTP request (PUT or otherwise) where I can pass along my child record into the <code>params</code> hash?  Is there a way to pass arbitrary data using ember-data methods?  I could write my own AJAX call but then it seems like I'm not taking advantage of ember-data.  Any insights?</p>

<p>I'm not sure the cause of this error, and yes I've done lots of searching around for similar user's problems (they are error #17, or app limit reached). And I'm doing this on regular graph API calls (such as <a href=""https://graph.facebook.com/me"">https://graph.facebook.com/me</a> ), not necessarily FQL like others have run into.</p>

<p><code>User request limit reached</code> makes it seem like a per-user limit, but according to <a href=""http://www.fb-developers.info/tech/fb_dev/faq/general/gen_10.php"">http://www.fb-developers.info/tech/fb_dev/faq/general/gen_10.php</a> , <code>#4</code> is <code>""Application request limit reached""</code> and <code>#17</code> is <code>""User request limit reached""</code>.</p>

<p>I don't believe there's anyway I'm hitting the 100M/day app limit. And I only get it for a couple users' auth tokens, so it's not an app-wide error message I'm getting. And when I request too quickly, I usually get <code>FQL_EC_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED</code>.</p>

<p>But for those two users with the above error <code>""(#4) User request limit reached""</code>, I've temporarily blacklisted them from loading data, but yet they <em>still</em> get the above error when I try to access using that auth token a day later.</p>

<p>So in conclusion...</p>

<p>I don't understand how I can get <code>""(#4) User request limit reached""</code> when the auth-token for that user is not being used for any queries in a 24-hour period prior. And I don't know what is special about these users.</p>

<p>Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. It was only one user a few days ago, but today a second user started running into this problem, and I'm worried the problem will just get worse in the future with no clear resolution.</p>

<p>Now i don't know what is good/best practise. I tried to use the sync method of the grid`s store and include the form (form B) values as extraParams. That works, but it is possible that after successfull request i need to do another request with same (untouched) store (only form B changes), so i would have to reset records states.

<p>Maybe a simple Ext.ajax.request() would to the job, but how to pass the store? I can add form B values as param, but i don`t know how to add the store? Do i need to add every record item to the params config by my own? </p>

<p>My <code>TableView</code> displays properly with correct data and correct scroll positions.
You would notice on my code that <code>kUserSilverCollections</code> and <code>kUserBronzeCollections</code> displays the same custom cell,and has the same height, but loads different data source.I am having this problem when the user selects kUserGoldsCollections (<code>kUserGoldsCollections</code> has bigger height than types <code>kUserSilverCollections</code> &amp; <code>kUserBronzeCollections</code>) , and go back to type <code>kUserSilverCollections</code> or <code>kUserBronzeCollections</code>, the custom cells  are not responding to touches anymore,buttons inside cell and the cell itself do not recognize touches, there is also a case that last few cells are responding. but the rest are not.</p>

<p>Im writing the code in iOS 7.1 SDK. Please help me find out what causes this problem :)
Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I found out what causes the problem, it was my <code>UserGoldsViewCell</code> now i feel stupid :D My question is lack of details like my cell setup. I should have included my code for my cells in this question.I Will post the solution/details as answer for future readers.</p>

<p>This works great, except if I call the function twice, the function runs the first time, calls the shell command, then the function runs again, and calls the shell command again, but the first shell command is not completed, so there is an error because the second shell command is trying to use the same smtp file as the first one (that is still in use).  </p>

<p>As you see in the code, i use customised ps session. when i set MaximumReceivedDataSizePerCommand to very low values (like 10kb) it fails with a message which tells maximum is 10kb, so i assume that MaximumReceivedDataSizePerCommand  is applied to ps session object.</p>

<p>Is it required to do this configuration on remote machine or somewhere else? what is causing this error?</p>

    This configuration is the minimum one that you need to create an SSL configuration.

<p>Consider this code,</p>

<pre><code>fo = open(""test.txt"", ""wb"")
fo.write(bytes('Sufiyan','UTF-8'))
</code></pre>

<p>If I were to run this code, It would give this error,</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

  File ""C:\Users\Sufiyan\Desktop\AES\a.py"", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;

    fo.write('Sufiyan')

TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, I have to convert it into <code>bytes</code> and provide the encoding type.</p>

<pre><code>fo = open(""test.txt"", ""wb"")
fo.write(bytes('Sufiyan','UTF-8'))
</code></pre>

<p>This works, because If you use Python3x then string is not the same type as for Python 2.x, you must cast it to bytes (encode it).</p>

<p>Now, When I am using this code to write to a file,</p>

<pre><code>def BB_cf(file, *args, **kwargs): #Create files

    try:

        fo = open(file)
        fo.close()

    except IOError:

        print (file, 'not Found')
        print (""Creating file....."")
        fo = open(file, ""w"")
        print (file,""Created Successfully!"")

        if file == 'input_Data.txt':
            print(file,""is Empty..\nWriting Data.."")
            text = kwargs.get('text', None)
            fo.write(text)
            print(""'""+text+""'"", ""is written in"",file)
            fo.close()

        fo.close()
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<pre><code>BB_cf('input_Data.txt', text='Sufiyan Ghori')
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the 4th last line, <code>fo.write(text)</code>, I haven't encoded it, but the code is still working. </p>

<p>Why the code is working without encoding it ?</p>

<p>Now if I cast it to <code>bytes</code>, It will give the following error,</p>

<p>Traceback (most recent call last):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>File ""C:\Users\Sufiyan\Desktop\AES\BlackBox.py"", line 47, in</p>
  
  <p></p>

<pre><code>fo.write(bytes(text,'UTF-8')) TypeError: must be str, not bytes
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Both the above codes are running using Python3x, 
The first one wants me to encode the <code>string</code> into <code>Bytes</code> while the 2nd one is running without encoding.</p>

<li>Data is POST'ed and then sent to MySQL</li>
<li>Expiry date = date now + 14 days</li>
</ol>

<p>What I am trying to achieve is a way for mysql to insert an ""expiry_date"" in a table column that will equal 14 days after the date the row was created in that table.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>product_name - foo
entry_date - 2012-02-01
expiry_date - 2012-02-15
</code></pre>

<p>I have a feeling it may not be possible to do in mysql unless using a stored procedure.</p>

<p>I am happy to do it in PHP however I was hoping if I could do it with mysql it would leave less scope for error in my system.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm even ""thinking right"", but I'd really like to get my way around this problem. Any suggestions? Or are there Author info that I'm missing out on in my RSS pipe?</p>

<p>I fails to see any kind of register within the NVIC or such that control the type of the interrupt (to select edge or level by adjusting the register bits). So something must be done by software within handler but again it vague in this field.</p>

<p>The reason being that as you click on the nodes, new nodes come into existence off screen and the force layout is erratic (not good), however once all the nodes appear at least once the nodes appear to behave as desired and appear close to the centre and hence produce minimal disturbance to the layout. </p>

SourceKitService does indeed crash, but only when I include the Parse SDK into my Bridging-Header. When I remove <code>#include &lt;Parse/Parse.h&gt;</code> from the bridging header, syntax highlighting returns to normal and all is good, minus the resulting errors from Parse not being present. While I haven't seen any other threads with a problem like this, I'm curious as to whether anyone else is experiencing such a problem. From my understanding, Parse is a relatively widely-used framework and I can't imagine that nobody else is having this trouble. </p>

<p>I heard that using a Timer is also a good way to go about this, but is it possible to run a timer in a backgroundworker, and if so, how would it be structured? More importantly, would it allow me to get as close to the 700 ms firing time I desire without any audible delays?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>So, by the above tables, the output would show; machine 5 (as 2 other machines from Location b have been appeared), machine 11 and machine 12 (as machine 10 from location d has appeared). It would be helpful if the site could be displayed in this 3rd table too.</p>

<p>Note that I do not need to see machines 7,8 or 9 as from the second list, as there is nothing to suggest that location C was visited.</p>

<p>I was thinking that maybe because I <em>removed</em> the number of data's to be inserted on a pre-made access database throws it? As you can see, I cut off the number of fields in <strong>code2</strong> because there had been some error on the strings sent to me, and they are not that important, so I removed the code where they will be <em>inserted</em> in the DB, though their fields are still there. That was my first assumption (but I think not really)  </p>

<p>Anyway, I did not test it yesterday so I thought about it. My GPS module hardly get signals so I can't test thoroughly, (<em>strings were from it, so if it does not work, so am I</em>)</p>

                typedef T* result_type;

                }
            };
            template&lt;typename T&gt; struct PushImpl {
                typedef T* result_type;
                typedef const T&amp; argument_type;

            template&lt;typename T&gt; typename PushImpl&lt;T&gt;::result_type Push(typename PushImpl&lt;T&gt;::argument_type ref) {
                return PushImpl&lt;T&gt;::Push(this, ref);

</code></pre>

<p>First: The struct is nested inside another class (the one that offers Push as a member func), but it can't access the template parameter (StackSize), even though my other nested classes all could. I've worked around it, but it would be cleaner if they could just access StackSize like a normal class.</p>

<p>Second: The compiler complains that it doesn't use or can't deduce T. Really?</p>

<p>Thirdly: The compiler complains that it can't specialize a template in the current scope (class scope).</p>

<p>I can't see what the problem is. Have I accidentally invoked some bad syntax?</p>

There is no problem adding these rows, and the grid is displayed as it should. However, buttons in rows on the lower half (the last 10 databound rows, 22, 24, etc) of the grid does not trigger RowCommand. All I get is an empty postback, reloading the page.

I am trying to check the satisfiability for different problems  with different sizes and verify the scalability of the proposed method. However, to do that I need to know the memory consumed by the solver for each problem. Is there a way to access the memory or make the z3py print it in the STATISTICS section. Thank you so much in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Update-27/5/2015:</strong></p>

<p>I tried with the paython memory profiler but it seems that the generated memory is very large. I am not sure but the reported memory is similar to the memory consumed by the python application and not only Z3(constructing the z3 model and checking the sat and then generating model). Moreover, I used formal modeling checking tools for many years now. I am expecting Z3 to be more efficient and have better scalability, however, I am getting much less memory than what the paython is generating. 
What I am thinking to do is to try to measure the design size or the scalability using factors other than memory.  In z3py statistics  many details are generated to describe the design size and complexity. However, I am not able to find any explanation of these parameters in the tutorial, webpage, or z3 papers. 
For example, can you help me understand the following parameters generated in the statistics for one of the basic models I have. Also is there any parameter/parameters which can replace the memory or be good indication of the Z3 mdoel size/complexity. </p>

<p>My problem is next: user goes into the program, retrieves data and gets a DataWindow, with a large number of rows(lets say a 1000), showing amount of money the client has, city he lives in, as well as some other data. The user then clicks all the rows that are of interest to him (some 500) and filters them in a second DataWindow, call it <code>DW_1</code>. Now he wants an excel sheet that gives sum of all money grouped by the city where clients live. Important to remember is that I want the sum only for the clients that the user flagged before. So this is what I'm doing in the code:</p>

<pre><code>String ls_s,ls_client,ls_clicked_client, ls_sql
Long ll_i
ls_s='';ls_client='';ls_clicked_client='';

FOR ll_i= 1 TO DW_1.RowCount()
 ls_s=DW_1.GetItemString(ll_i, ""client"")
  IF ll_i&lt;DW_1.RowCount() THEN
    ls_client+=""'""+ls_s+""',"" 
  ELSEIF ll_i=DW_1.RowCount() THEN
    ls_clicked_client+=ls_client+""'""+ls_s+""'""
  END IF
NEXT

ls_sql=""SELECT city, SUM(amount) sum_amount""&amp; 
   +""FROM(""&amp;
   +""SELECT city, amount""&amp;  
   +""FROM table1 T1 WHERE amount+0&gt;0 AND client IN ( ""+ls_clicked_client+""))""&amp;
   +""GROUP BY city""

DW_1.SetSqlSelect(ls_sql)
DW_1.Retrieve()
w_window.SetMicrohelp(String(DW_1.RowCount()))
DW_1.saveas(""excel.xls"")
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I'm taking all my flagged clients and putting their client codes into one variable which I then use as my argument in the SQL IN function. After that i use the standard saveas method. </p>

<p>This worked great until I picked out more rows then one can take: once I go over board, I get <code>ORA 01795: max number of expressions in a list is 1000</code>. That's my problem: if the user picks too many clients this fails. </p>

<p>I've also tried to use <code>INSTR</code> function, but that also failed do to the big amount of selected rows - I get <code>ORA 01460: unimplemented or unreasonable conversion requested</code> tips: it seems that attempting to pass a string to a bind variable value in excess of 4000 bytes causes it to collapse.</p>

<p>So basically I have something working to some extent which does not satisfy me. And I have no ideas how to make this work without the SQL code I've written in the ls_sql variable. If I was supposed to give just some rows of the <code>DW_1</code> in an excel sheet I'd go with OLE objects, but I don't see how to get sum of amounts grouped by city for such a large number of specified clients. </p>

<p>Any ideas, suggestions?  </p>

<p>but when i use a normal map , the dark areas gets lit! </p>

<p>i want to use a normal map and still get correct diffuse lighting like these examples </p>

<p>here is the code with and without normal mapping</p>

<p>and here is the code that uses the normal map</p>

<p>Vertex Shader</p>

<pre><code>varying vec3 normal,lightDir;
attribute vec3 vertex,normalVec,tangent;
attribute vec2 UV;

void main(){

gl_TexCoord[0] = gl_TextureMatrix[0] * vec4(UV,0.0,0.0);
normal = normalize (gl_NormalMatrix * normalVec);
vec3 t = normalize (gl_NormalMatrix * tangent);
vec3 b = cross (normal, t);
vec3 vertexPosition = normalize(vec3(gl_ModelViewMatrix * vec4(vertex,1.0)));
vec3 v;
v.x = dot (lightDir, t);
v.y = dot (lightDir, b);
v.z = dot (lightDir, normal);
lightDir = normalize (v);
lightDir = normalize(vec3(1.0,0.5,1.0) - vertexPosition);
gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix*vec4(vertex,1.0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Fragment Shader</p>

<pre><code>vec4 computeDiffuseLight (const in vec3 direction, const in vec4 lightcolor, const in vec3 normal, const in vec4 mydiffuse){

float nDotL = dot(normal, direction);
vec4 lambert = mydiffuse * lightcolor * max (nDotL, 0.0);
return lambert;
}

varying vec3 normal,lightDir;
uniform sampler2D textures[8];

void main(){
vec3 normalVector = normalize( 2 * texture2D(textures[0],gl_TexCoord[0].st).rgb - 1 );
vec4 diffuse = computeDiffuseLight (lightDir, vec4(1,1,1,1) , normalVector, vec4(0.7,0.7,0.7,0));
gl_FragColor = diffuse ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: the actual normal mapping works correctly as seen in the specular highlights</p>

<p>i used Assimp to load the model ( md5mesh ) and calculated the tangents using Assimp too , then sent it to the shaders as an attribute</p>

<p>here is a link to the code and screenshots of the problem</p>

<p><a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32670019/code%20and%20screenshots.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32670019/code%20and%20screenshots.zip</a></p>

<p>is that a problem in the code or am i having a misconception ?</p>

<p><strong>Updated code and screenshots</strong></p>

<p>now the normal map works with the diffuse , but the diffuse alone is not correct</p>

<p>The Yeoman docs say to execute the generator like this:</p>

<pre><code>node --debug `which yo` &lt;generator&gt; [arguments]
</code></pre>

<p>I got this working using <strong>node-inspector</strong>. I start node-inspector in one terminal window, then in another window I do the above &amp; when I launch the browser with the node-inspector site, I can attach and hit a breakpoint in my yeoman generator's script.</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to set this up using VSCode. I don't need node-inspector here... so I setup a a launch configuration that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    // Name of configuration; appears in the launch configuration drop down menu.
    ""name"": ""Launch yeoman generator-nodehttps"",
    // Type of configuration. Possible values: ""node"", ""mono"".
    ""type"": ""node"",
    // Workspace relative or absolute path to the program.
    ""program"": ""/Users/ac/.npm-packages/lib/node_modules/yo/lib/cli.js"",
    // Automatically stop program after launch.
    ""stopOnEntry"": false,
    // Command line arguments passed to the program.
    ""args"": [""nodehttps""],
    // Workspace relative or absolute path to the working directory of the program being debugged. Default is the current workspace.
    ""cwd"": ""."",
    // Workspace relative or absolute path to the runtime executable to be used. Default is the runtime executable on the PATH.
    ""runtimeExecutable"": null,
    // Environment variables passed to the program.
    ""env"": { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason my <strong>program</strong> property is different is because putting <code>which yo</code> (in single quotes or not quoted) yielded an error from VSCode that ""which yo does not exist</p>

<p>It successfully launches a new terminal window &amp; I can interact with the generator, but none of my breakpoints are getting hit nor do I see anything showing up in the VSCode call stack / variables window... but VSCode appears attached to the process (orange bar at the bottom of the editor).</p>

<p>But no matter what I tweak, I can't seem to get VSCode to debug my generator... ideas?</p>

        Log.e(""SOAP_TEST"", e.toString());
        Log.e(""SOAP_TEST"", e.getMessage());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The test code will result in HTTP status 500</p>

<p>When I check the request dump the request xml looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;v:Envelope xmlns:i=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:d=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"" xmlns:c=""http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding"" xmlns:v=""http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope""&gt;

    &lt;n0:getInterestAndExchangeGroupNames id=""o0"" c:root=""1"" xmlns:n0=""http://swea.riksbank.se/ws""&gt;
        &lt;groupid i:type=""d:int""&gt;5&lt;/groupid&gt;
        &lt;languageid i:type=""d:string""&gt;sv&lt;/languageid&gt;
    &lt;/n0:getInterestAndExchangeGroupNames&gt;
    &lt;/v:Body&gt;
&lt;/v:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have also imported the wsdl into soapUI, which will generate the following request:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"" xmlns:xsd=""http://swea.riksbank.se/xsd""&gt;
   &lt;soap:Header/&gt;
   &lt;soap:Body&gt;
      &lt;xsd:getInterestAndExchangeNames&gt;
         &lt;groupid&gt;5&lt;/groupid&gt;
         &lt;languageid&gt;sv&lt;/languageid&gt;
      &lt;/xsd:getInterestAndExchangeNames&gt;
   &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That request looks exactly as described in the web service documentation and also works as expected.</p>

<p>So what do I need to do to fix the ksoap2 request? (This soap stuff is completely new for me.)</p>

<p><em><strong>THOUGHTS</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Right now I think the best way to go about this is to trim the original file (which I have already done) and then search through the second file looking for lines that begin with a digit. (I would think to do this with regex expression: ...@""^[\d]+\s+""...). However, using that regex, I would only grab the number on the line and not the entire line? But if I was able to grab the whole line (I am not sure how to), if the that line was found, I would put it in a string and then add the first line of previous file to the end of that string with a delimiter ""\t"".</li>
</ul>

<p>So pretty much:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trim the first file to the necessary numbers needed to concat to end of 2nd file <strong>(DONE)</strong></li>
<li>Grab each line in the second file (one by one?)
<ul>
<li>Check if the line starts with a number (using regex?)
<ul>
<li>If it does, add the 1st line in the 1st file to the end of the match in the 2nd file (do this for all matches.. 2nd line with 2nd match, 3rd line with 3rd match, etc.) and store it as a new string. (problem with this is that there would have to be a whole bunch of strings... and I am not familiar with lists..)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now go back through each line of the 2nd file and compare the new string (with the first file ending) to every line in the 2nd file. If there is a match, replace that line with the line in the string.</li>
<li>Output it to a rich text box/.txt file.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>QUESTION</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How do I find a line that starts with a 1,2,3,4,5,etc in the second file and then grab the first file line by line and add the first line to the first line. In this case, adding 147221 to the end of the entire line that begins with a 1 (147486 to the end of the line that starts with a 2, etc)?</li>
<li>Does anyone know of an easier way to do this?</li>
</ul>

I guess I'll use <a href=""http://akkasource.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Akka Project</a>, I'm going to test it.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong>
I've done it using <a href=""http://www.nodejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Node.js</a>, it's incomparable by any other solution (IMO) in learning curve, community support, and project maturity.

<p>This seems to be a weird issue for me. Hibernate does not complain with any errors. But when i checked the DB there are no records. I thought this could be an issue with flushing modes. But I believe that the default Flushing mode is auto. Anyways i tried to specify the Flushing mode as well. But still the problem exists. Please help me on this?</p>

<p>Thanks In Advance,
Arun</p>

I have loaded the tabbed widget to use as a main menu, and have linked the main sections of my app to these - so effectively I have a working main menu.  When I click on a tab a page loads in the window, but the problem is if I then click on a link on this page it will take me to a different place.  What is the easiest way for me to get the new page to load in that tab?</p>

<p>Here is a link to the widget which I am talking about:
<a href=""http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#default"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#default</a></p>

<p>EDIT:  Below that link there is a tutorial snippet of code which says </p>

<p><strong>""...open links in the current tab instead of leaving the page""</strong></p>

<p><strong>""Hijax"" links after tab content has been loaded:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$('#example').tabs({
    load: function(event, ui) {
        $(ui.panel).delegate('a', 'click', function(event) {
            $(ui.panel).load(this.href);
            event.preventDefault();
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This sounds promising but I'm unsure how to use it.  In my tabbed interface page (tabbedhome_v.php), I have a container with id=""tabs"" which has the tabbed content in.  So I just changed the word example in the code about to ""tabs"" and it seems to work for more pages now, but not all for some reason.  Would someone mind explaining to me how this works?</p>

<p>What I have observed with the code above:  an image hyperlink leads the next page to load within the panel, but none of the javascript links or jquery that I had loaded on those pages is now working.  Why is this?</p>

The MCU's USB is configured as printer class when I plug the MCU into the PC so that it is identified as a printer. I've installed generic/text only driver available with windows and hence i can see my printer in ""devices and printers"" listed under printer category.
    My question here is if I want to print whatever is sent to the printer, I need to know the data being sent from PC. For example, if I print a pdf, I want to know what data is sent i mean the format like HEX values or anything like that. Once I know what is coming into the controller I can print.
    Any input here is welcome.</p>

<p>my current code is simply:</p>

<pre><code>    data&lt;-read.table(""name.txt"")
    x&lt;-as.data.frame(data)
    write.csv(x,file=""name2.csv"")
</code></pre>

<p>The code works fine when I use another file, but when I use my target file I get the error code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error in scan(file, what, nmax,sep,dec,quote,skip,nlines,na.strings, :line 1 did not have 24 elements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would cause this issue and how do I resolve it? </p>
