"328044","1","328064","","2008-11-29 21:37:30","","4","434","<p>I have a database table with a large number of rows and one numeric column, and I want to represent this data in memory.  I could just use one big integer array and this would be very fast, but the number of rows could be too large for this.</p>

<p>Most of the rows (more than 99%) have a value of zero.  Is there an effective data structure I could use that would only allocate memory for rows with non-zero values and would be nearly as fast as an array?</p>

<p>Update:  as an example, one thing I tried was a Hashtable, reading the original table and adding any non-zero values, keyed by the row number in the original table.  I got the value with a function that returned 0 if the requested index wasn't found, or else the value in the Hashtable.  This works but is slow as dirt compared to a regular array - I might not be doing it right.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:  here is sample code.</strong></p>

<pre><code>private Hashtable _rowStates;
private void SetRowState(int rowIndex, int state)
{
    if (_rowStates.ContainsKey(rowIndex))
    {
        if (state == 0)
        {
            _rowStates.Remove(rowIndex);
        }
        else
        {
            _rowStates[rowIndex] = state;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        if (state != 0) 
        {
            _rowStates.Add(rowIndex, state);
        }
    }
}
private int GetRowState(int rowIndex)
{
    if (_rowStates.ContainsKey(rowIndex))
    {
        return (int)_rowStates[rowIndex];
    }
    else
    {
        return 0;

<p>As you can see, there is a space between each ""group"" of label+input due to the line break.

<ul>
<li>exists? – Returns whether this element actually exists.</li>
<li>present? – Returns true if the element exists and is visible on the page</li>
<li>visible? – If any parent element isn’t visible then we cannot write to the element. The only reliable way to determine this is to iterate up the DOM element tree checking every element to make sure it’s visible.</li>
</ul>

<p>From that</p>

<ol>
<li>I would predict that exists? would be the fastest, because it only checks to see if the element exists.</li>
<li>That present? would be the 2nd fastest as it checks for existence and for visibility.</li>
<li>That visible? would be the slowest because (as I read it) it also has to iterate up the DOM element tree.</li>
</ol>

<p>Simply checking one element sounds like constant-time while iteration sounds like linear-time.</p>

<p>I happened to be running some time tests and thought it would be interesting to time the above methods as well.  One of my predictions is wrong.</p>

<p>exists? is fastest; coming in just slightly faster than visible?
However, present? is about twice as slow as visible?</p>

<p>I tried calling the methods in a different order and also enclosing them in a 1.upto(10) loop to average out the times.  Same results.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Persistence Ignorance refers to being
  able to allow the developer to write
  and test domain objects in a way that
  is entirely independent of fundamental
  requirements and assumptions that may
  be made by the infrastructure service
  (in this case, the Entity Framework).
  Such requirements / assumptions may
  often include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The need to implement a specific interface (for e.g., IPOCO)</li>
  <li>Inheritance from a base class</li>
  <li><strong>Providing specific constructors</strong></li>
  <li>Object Instantiation/Construction requirements – use a specific factory
  for instance**</li>
  <li>The need for metadata or mapping class or property Attributes</li>
  <li>The need to use specific relationship mechanisms</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This amounts to being able to use
  Plain Old CLR Objects (POCO) so that a
  developer can author their domain
  objects free of all assumptions and
  requirements imposed by the framework.
  Using this approach, once the domain
  objects are ready to their
  satisfaction, the developer can use
  these classes with the Entity
  Framework in order for relational
  database access and persistence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of right now (CTP5), is there any way at all to reconstitute a poco using a parametrized constructor?  If not, it's hard to see how the Entity Framework can be said to offer persistence ignorance.</p>

<p>I used two comparevalidators. One to verify the current password and the new password field(the first only). And other to check if the new password field is equal to the confirm new password field.<br />
So, the problem is when I enter the current password field equal to the new password field and I enter the confirm new password field different from the new password field, because both errors show up. I need to display one error at a time...</p>

Due to my flawed understanding of how angular works I was redirecting to certain webpages and so breaking the app; at the time this didn't matter as it was just a quick prototype to get some ideas down.<br>
Now however, I want to build something more realistic, and so the app must run on the one page. 
Instead of the redirects I was using in the original prototype I've decided to implement modals to display the data within the app. 
All has been going well so far, I can click on an item in the list and a modal window opens and displays the correct data as related to the item that was selected, except that is, for the graphs. </p>

<p>I'm not sure how I should implement the graphs in the model, or to be more accurate, how I can select the canvas element to add the graph to it.</p>

<p>I'm using a templateURL for the modal, and a controller to handle the modal functionality. </p>

<p>Since my knowledge of javascript is dodgy at best, I've spend most of today going over the basics of Javascript and JQuery (I've been working with Angular for a couple of weeks now). </p>

<p>On my static pages I use the charts as described in the Chart.js documentation. </p>

<p>This works fine when it's added to a html page that contains the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, but it doesn't work if I include it in the modal template. Here's my modal template (without the javascript):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""deviceModal""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""modal-header""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""divBar"" &gt;
            &lt;div class=""{{device.status}}""&gt;&lt;img src=""{{(device.type == 'type1') ? 'img/type1white.png' : 'img/type2white.png'}}""&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""title""&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;{{device.id}}&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""{{device.status}}Text""&gt;&lt;b&gt;STATUS: {{device.status}}&lt;/b&gt; - {{device.action}}&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt; 
        &lt;div class=""divBar""&gt;
            &lt;table&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""dataLabel""&gt;Location: &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""dataContent""&gt;{{device.location}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""dataLabel""&gt;Running Time: &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""dataContent""&gt;3 days&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;canvas id=""myChart"" width=""400"" height=""200""&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the modal controller built with Angular: </p>

<pre><code>app.controller('modalController', function ($scope, $modal) {

    $scope.open = function (device) {
        $scope.device = device;
        var modalInstance = $modal.open({
            templateUrl: 'add_modal.html',
            windowClass: 'app-modal-window',
            scope: $scope
        });

        console.log('modal opened');

        modalInstance.result.then(function () {

            console.log('you can check user selections here');

        }, function () {

            console.log('Modal dismissed at: ' + new Date());

        });

    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible for me to add the chart and data in the Modal controller? or by using a directive maybe? 
Eventually the graphs will be displaying data that's queried from a database when the user selects an item that opens the modal window. </p>

<p>I've been looking at using javascript and JQuery to add the chart and data, but they require the element to be available on the page at the time of execution and that's not the case here. I've tried adding javascript to the templateURL but that doesn't work either. 
Also, I'd imagine I should be able to do this the Angular way, can anyone suggest how that might be possible? </p>

<ol>
<li>Easy to process: It shouldn't take a lot of effort (algorithmic complexity, performance) to format a number.</li>
<li>(Optional) User-friendly: It is intuitive enough for users to directly work with this syntax.</li>
<li>Account for thousands separators and decimal places.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even though my target domain is JavaScript (i.e. formatting <code>Number</code> instances), I prefer a specifier scheme that is standard, intuitive etc. instead of JavaScript-native. And no, I don't think the <code>printf</code> number format specifiers are intuitive enough to present to users.</p>

<p>The scheme I've come up with so far is:</p>

<p><code>#,###.##</code></p>

<p>to say:</p>

<ol>
<li>The whole part uses groups of <strong>3</strong> digits separated by <strong>commas</strong></li>
<li>Use <strong>2</strong> decimal places and use a <strong>period</strong> as the delimiter</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I'm feeling ""meh"" about this scheme</strong> and don't want to invest too much time in implementing it before seeing better alternatives.</p>

<p>What I've also experiemented with is, to be done with a format specifier and actually use a preferences object with distinct properties for thousands/decimal delimiters, number of decimal places etc. and abstract it by presenting to the user sample number outputs to pick from.</p>

<p>Should I forget about using a format specifier scheme and just use a set of properties that are abstracted at presentation layer? Is there a standard(ish) specifier that meets the 3 criteria I mentioned at the top?</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I'm not without a solution and I have enough to get me going. I'm just looking for a more ideal solution.</p>

<p>By setting <code>defaultMaxConnectionsPerHost</code>, I expect the number of simultaneous connections per host is <strong>30</strong>. But through my tests, it seems the actual number is at most <strong>6</strong> no matter how large I set <code>defaultMaxConnectionsPerHost</code>.</p>

<p>How I do my test:</p>

<ul>
<li>client side: sending about 20 requests to my web application simultaneously through browser (I tried FireFox and Chrome). </li>
<li>server side: fetch the connection count by <code>netstat</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Why is the number of simultaneous connections per host is not 30 as expected?</li>
<li>Question 2: My application has to send out about 10 requests to one host per second. Each request lasts for 2 seconds. Then what's the appropriate value of <code>defaultMaxConnectionsPerHost</code> should I set?</li>

<p>Two issues I could solve already by myself (see ""solved"" below), still two more to go :-(</p>

<p><strong>OPEN: Detailed error message?</strong></p>

<p>I discovered was that there seem to be two different kind of errors. One kind of error Visual Studio / Web Essential are handled with a wavy underline or telling the reason on the result window on the right, which is totally fine, but I am having trouble with ""other kinds of errors"", where my CSS simply doesn't get updated and it is not telling me why.  </p>

<p>In the Output Window I can see: </p>

<pre><code>SCSS: myfile.scss compilation failed: The service failed to respond to this request

        Possible cause: Syntax Error!
</code></pre>

<p>But no further details. Is there any kind of log file?</p>

<p><strong>OPEN: @mixing for image-width not working</strong></p>

<p>Calling the method image-width or image-height (as described here: <a href=""http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/helpers/image-dimensions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/helpers/image-dimensions/</a> )
always ends up in an ""Syntax Error!"" error as shown in the open issue above.</p>

<p>The code I'm using is pretty simple (file in the same location and exists):</p>

<pre><code>width: image-width(""MyImage.jpg"");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>SOLVED: Import Issue</strong></p>

<p>I could solve the problem why the following statement wasn't working:</p>

<pre><code>@import ""compass"";
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, I have to specify a specific file and not a folder, like so:</p>

<pre><code>@import ""compass/reset/_utilities.scss"";
</code></pre>

<p>Reason: Regarding to the sass-lang documentation, the decleration is not for folders, it is actually for ""Partials"" (<a href=""http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4</a>) and underscore sass files are treated as such. In my project I had the compass folder included, but I was missing the _compass.scss file (this is what @import ""compass"" was looking for).</p>

<p><strong>SOLVED: Calling basic Compass funtionallity</strong></p>

<p>I could solve: Basic Sass-functionality works, but by calling the compass mixin such as global-reset in, the renderd code looks like this</p>

<pre><code> ...
 elements-of-type(html5-block) { display: block; }
 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Solution: In the Visual Studio Options, Navigate to WebEssentials > SASS > Use Ruby Runtime and set the value to ""True""</p>

references to variables in scopes beyond the static parent cost more than references
to locals. The static chain must be followed, one link per enclosing scope from the reference to the declaration. Fortunately, in practice, references to
distant nonlocal variables are rare, so this is not a serious problem. Another
criticism of the static-chain approach is that it is difficult for a programmer
working on a time-critical program to estimate the costs of nonlocal references,
because the cost of each reference depends on the depth of nesting between the
reference and the scope of declaration. Further complicating this problem is
that subsequent code modifications may change nesting depths, thereby changing
the timing of some references, both in the changed code and possibly in
code far from the changes.</p>

<p>Is there a way to create a static library in Xcode such that when clients link with that library, they also link with the frameworks upon which that library depends?</p>

<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>We have a shared Xcode project which contains multiple static library targets containing all of our common code. E.g., If a project wants to use the shared networking code, all they should have to do is link in our Network library.</p>

<p>The problem is that the libraries don't seem to ""include"" the frameworks on which they depend.</p>

<p>E.g., our Sound library uses the AudioToolkit.framework. Even when the Sound library includes AudioToolbox.framework in the list its linked libraries, clients get linker errors when linking with Sound if they don't also directly link with AudioToolkit.framework.</p>

<p>This is a maintenance hassle because every time a library's framework dependencies change we have manually go change the list of linked frameworks in all dependent projects.</p>

<p><code>Object</code> is accessable globally:</p>

<p><code>Object</code> can only be accessed if it's within the ViewController:</p>

<p>I have three different tables. One is a title table. The second is a genre table. The third table is used to join the two. When I designed the database, I expected that each title would have one top level genre. After filling it with data, I discovered that there were titles that had two, sometimes, three top level genres.</p>

<p>I wrote a query that retrieves titles and their top level genres. This obviously requires that I join the two tables. For those that only have one top level genre, there is one record. For those that have more, there are multiple records. </p>

<p>I realize I'll probably have to write a custom function of some kind that will handle this for me, but I thought I'd ask if it's possible to do this without doing so just to make sure I'm not missing anything.</p>

<p>Is it possible to write a query that will allow me to select all of the distinct titles regardless of the number of genres that it has, but also include the genre? Or even better, a query that would give me a comma delimited string of genres when there are multiples?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

As an example, we created a fictive problem of having a <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> of n random integers (typically 1.000.000) and wanted to create a function that returned the set of all integers that there were more than one of. Pretty straightforward stuff. We created one LINQ statement to solve this problem, and a plain insertion sort based algorithm.</p>

<p>Now, as we tested the speed the code ran at (using <code>System.Diagnostics.StopWatch</code>), the results were confusing. Not only did the LINQ code outperform the simple sort, but it ran faster than <em>a single</em> <code>foreach</code>/<code>for</code> that only did a single loop of the list, and that had no operations within (which, on a side track, I thought the compiler was supposed to discover and remove alltogether).</p>

<p>If we generated a new <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> of random numbers in the same execution of the program and ran the LINQ code again, the performance would increase by orders of magnitude (typically thousandfold). The performance of the empty loops were of course the same.</p>

<p>So, what is going on here? Is LINQ using parallelism to outperform normal loops? How are these results even possible? LINQ uses quicksort which runs at n*log(n), which per definition is already slower than n.</p>

<p>And what is happening at the performance leap on the second run?</p>

<p>We were both baffled and intrigued at these results and were hoping for some clarifying insights from the community, just to satisfy our own curiosity.</p>

I am currently working on a 3rd party PostgreSQL database, and I have limited READ permissions, so I'm unable to create a temp table, or create ""user defined"" variables.
Moreover, I found that dealing with regular expressions is more difficult in Postgres than MySQL.</p>

<p>Question:<br>
I have the following dummy table:</p>

<pre><code>Code   |  Name
11199  |  a
22299  |  b
33399  |  c
44499  |  a
55599  |  c
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have an offline list (can't create/modify tables in this DB) of numbers.
I need to select the names whose code starts with these numbers - but the return code should be the code in the query statement.</p>

<p>Example list of numbers:</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
4
5

<p>Desired query result:</p>

<pre><code>code  |   name

2     |   b
3     |   c
4     |   a
5     |   c

<p>I could think of ways to accomplish it if I had more db permissions (such as inserting the list to a table in the database, plus using temp tables + if I could use regex like in mysql), but I don't know where to start on Postgres with this. Help? :)</p>

That old Drupal-content is partly broken (due to nearly 7 years of fugly upgrades, discontinued modules and so on). The fact that it is Drupal is hardly relevant, just the fact that it causes some inconsistencies, weird naming, and badly normalised tables.</p>

<p>The content needing to be imported into the Rails app is simple: content (blog-entries), attached files (images) and comments. I have the luxury of two databases being ""stale"" (not in production) and two more being in production, but allowed to go down/locked for a while (hours, days). So, the migrations need not be optimized for speed, or be entirely save (meaning: I can afford to loose a comment being posted while running the migration) </p>

<p>The Rails(3) app is mostly done, and using Active-record conventions only. </p>

<p>Due to the contraints (broken, inconsistent database, several databases needing merging) I prefer to write migrations for this, instead of connecting my new Rails app to an ugly, inconsistent legacy databse.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any environments, gems or tools that make importing in Rails easier: e.g. something that allows simple mapping from old-new in some DSL.</li>
<li>Or is it easier to write my migrations entirely in SQL: SQL queries that will turn the old data into the structure that fits the Rails app? Migrating is from MySQL->MySQL. </li>
<li>Or should I just connect Activerecord to the old databases, loop over each row/result and run an Object.save! in my rails app?</li>

<p>maybe there is a way to communicate between browser to windows application?, so the 3rd party software will send data to it and the application will communicate to the window
(or Firefox extension - but i prefer without the need to install more addons)...</p>

<p>Found that the DOM is code assisted using the following syntax (definition of Document):</p>

<pre><code>function HTMLElement(){};
HTMLElement.prototype = new Element();
Document.prototype.getElementById=function(elementId){return new HTMLElement();};
</code></pre>

<p>So using the deps.js and some javascript I tried to generate that code and it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$goog=function(){};
$goog$Delay=function(){};
$goog.prototype.Delay=new $goog$Delay()
$goog$Disposable=function(){};
$goog.prototype.Disposable=new $goog$Disposable()
Window.prototype.goog=new $goog();
</code></pre>

<p>It will code assist but the full deps.js will generate 5850 lines and when adding that code to my project and typing <code>goog.</code> it'll not only crash but bring my computer to a complete halt until I kick Ecliple's process.</p>

<p>It looks like a lot but realy isn't that much to process, in a video I see about typescript I see it code assist the entire dom (including element style which is missing in Eclipse). Even the <a href=""http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/"" rel=""nofollow"">online IDE</a> gives me code assist for the entire dom. My guess is that the parser for code assist is in dire need of improvement if a javascript IDE can do better than a compiled Java program.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can add these definitions for code assist without the IDE chocking? </p>

<p>If I were to type <code>document.getElementById</code> then put my cursor somewhere in the getElementById function and press F3 it'll open up baseBrowserLibrary.js but this file is created in a temp directory so it suggest it's actually compiled somewhere. I wonder how hard it would be to add a compiled library that defines the closure library.</p>

<p>I would improve the script so far and have it read the files that define the goog.provide(d) objects so I can add the comments as well. But If compiling it is too much trouble than it's better to forget about it since providing a javascript file with the definition is too much for Eclipse/JSDT to handle.</p>

<p><strong>[update]</strong></p>

<p>I see in the eclipe/pligins/org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core_1.1.202.v201208171701.jar the directory libraries and that contains baseBrowserLibrary.js this looks like the same file as the file opened by eclipse when you go to the definition of <code>document.getElementById</code> for example. Don't know why adding my own js file makes the code assist painfully slow. Tried to wrap the js file in <code>user library</code> but that didn't improve the speed at all.</p>

<pre><code>workgroup_session_id=ilDJtR0rE1AG28C9ZxKLHj8TBtcT89sw; Path=/; Expires=Sun, 02-Dec-2012 5:57:25 GMT; HttpOnly

<p>I am loading this string into a <code>SimpleCookie</code> instance from the <code>Cookie</code> module. Unfortunately, because of the bug that I referenced above, when I later pull <code>expires</code> out of the morsel dictionary it returns <code>Sun,</code>. I have found that I can overcome this bug by adding quotes around the <code>Expires</code> component of the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header (or adding quotes around any key / value pair that contains spaces in the value).</p>

<p>So this:</p>

<pre><code>workgroup_session_id=ilDJtR0rE1AG28C9ZxKLHj8TBtcT89sw; Path=/; Expires=Sun, 02-Dec-2012 5:57:25 GMT; HttpOnly

</code></pre>

<p>And this:</p>

<pre><code>test=a b c; Path=/; Expires=a b c; HttpOnly
</code></pre>

<p>Would become:</p>

<pre><code>test=""a b c""; Path=/; Expires=""a b c""; HttpOnly
</code></pre>

<p>I know that I could break the string into tokens and loop through them looking for spaces, then reconstruct the string, but I am curious what the best <strong>performing</strong> solution would be. As I mentioned, this is a reverse proxy that could potentially handle a few hundred requests a second, so I'd like this substitution to be as fast as possible. </p>

<p>Would a regular expression substitution (pre-compiled of course) be efficient? I've heard that regular expressions are pretty heavy....</p>

<p>Upon profiling, the problem appears to be generated on a delete statement, similar to this:</p>

<blockquote>

         AND ([WorkItemOid] = 745 /</em> @p1 <em>/)

         AND (NOT ([Failed] = 1))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The error was happening in a statement where I was attempting to individually delete ~1500 foreign key records.  When I changed the code to delete rows individually, I narrowed it down to about 45 rows that couldn't be deleted.  I then used SQL Compact Query Analyzer to attempt to execute the delete on the lines themselves, and it did fail there also, with the divide by zero exception.</p>

<p>So, it appears to not be a Linq-to-Sql error, but rather something with SQL Server Compact CE 4.0 itself deleting these rows.  I've attempted to delete and start with a clean database, and replicated the populating and then deleting from the database, and the problem happens again.  It might be an issue when there's > 1500 foreign key records that something happens when deleting.</p>

<p>A bunch of google searches were mostly empty, but I did find a reference to a <code>DivideByZeroException</code> with SQL Server CE 3.5 at <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947002"">this</a> reference. I have confirmed I'm using the SQL Server CE 4.0 assemblies, so this does not seem to be the issue. Any ideas on if the above bug still applies to SQL Server CE 4.0?  It appears after further review it is the same problem.</p>

The website is hosted on windows 2008 Server (VPS) and I have installed SMTP on IIS7.</p>

<p>After spending some time reading on how to implement a mechanism for sending mass emails through asp.net, I feel a bit confused.</p>

<li>send them synchronously or asynchronously (new thread) in a loop</li>
<li>prepare and put them in pickup directory</li>
<li>create a windows service that would check for an existing queue</li>
<li>send them from sql server 2008 (I have express).</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you please suggest the best way to go with?</p>

<p>I want to clean up the data, performing tasks such as removing extra white space, normalizing postal abbreviation, ie street to st, etc. </p>

<p>I've written a series of regular expression that successfully achieve the cleansing/normalization.  </p>

<p>However what I am unsure of is how to do this efficiently AND elegantly apply these cleanse processes to an Object in JS /Node.js.  I will have scenarios where I want to cleanse request.billing.addressLine1,  request.shipping.addressLine1 with the same regex pattern</p>

<p>I could of course do something like:
    var addressCleaner= new RegExp(""( str| street| strt)"",""g"");
    myObj.request.billing.addressLine1.replace(addressCleaner, ""st""); 
    myObj.request.shipping.addressLine1.replace(addressCleaner, ""st"");</p>

<p>But I dont feel this is very DRY and furthermore its not being done very ""node""ishly. </p>

<p>Any suggestions or example approaches?  I would like to avoid using a package like Mongoose etc. to do this as the type of normalizing i'm doing does not just consist of making sure a string is a string ,etc.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Let's suppose you have the 2 following table</p>

<pre><code>Create table SHARES(
    SHAREID   NUMBER(10) not null,
    NAME      VARCHAR2(40) not null));

Create table DEALS(
    DEALID    NUMBER(10) not null,
    SHAREID   NUMBER(10) not null,
    QUANTITY  NUMBER(10,4),
    PRICE     NUMBER(10,4));
</code></pre>

<p>Give a SQL query to display your positions (by summing deals). This query should return the following information : share name, quantity.</p>

<hr>

<p>First of all, I am not even sure that I understood what was asked but what I understood so far is that we want to display a list like that:</p>

<pre><code>SHARENAME POSITION(=Sum(for each deals of this share){dealsquantity*price}
</code></pre>

<p>So my answer was:</p>

<pre><code>Select Name, SUM(Quantity * Price) 
FROM SHARES Inner Join DEALS on SHARES.SHAREID = DEALS.SHAREID
Group by NAME
</code></pre>

<p>I did not get to know if the answer was correct or not, but I think it is just wrong.
So I would like to know if you have any suggestion/correction to do.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>PS: I think I anyway need to study back the whole SQL thing</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>A prototype for my class is:</p>

<pre><code>public class Transaction
{
    public enum Type { Income, Outcome }

    public DateTime Date { get; set;}
    public Type Type { get; set;}
    public decimal Amount { get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some people would say that TransactionType enum should be declared on namespace scope, but for those i'would say that this Type is only related to the Transaction so IMO it should be declared inside the class.
If i declare it in the class, there's a compiler error in field Type declaration.
Should i name it Types? Guess not too because i need to refer Income as a Type and not as Types.</p>

<p>Please say what you think about this topic, thanks.</p>

"9255088","1","9404355","","2012-02-13 03:08:33","","3","480","<p>So the problem I'm having is I have a function which uses a variable in a closure and when testing it it returns a reference to the variable in it's scope. My code looks similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>var app = function() {
    var theString = """";

    //Appends ztvars onto the url passed into the function
    var appendString = function(url) {            
        if (theString.length === 0) {
            return url;
        }

        return url+theString;   
    };

    //Used for testing, returns the function appendPageVars
    this.returnFunctions = function() {
        return { appendString: appendString };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the testing code using QUnit looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>var theApp = new app();
appFunctions = theApp.returnFunctions();
test('appendString()', function() {
    var theString = ""TestString"";
    var theUrl = ""http://www.test.com"";
    equals(appFunctions.appendString(testUrl), theUrl+theString, ""Checking the string appended to the url""); //Fails
});
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that even when passing the function back to the test the appendString function still holds a reference to the theString defined inside the app scope. </p>

<p>I've managed to get around this problem by creating a clone of the function using eval rather than using it directly like so:</p>

<pre><code>var theApp = new app();
appFunctions = theApp.returnFunctions();
test('appendString()', function() {
    var theString = ""TestString"";
    var theUrl = ""http://www.test.com"";
    eval(""var appendString = ""+appFunctions.appendString.toString());
    equals(appendString(testUrl), theUrl+theString, ""Checking the string appended to the url""); //Passes
});
</code></pre>

<p>However I've always been taught to avoid eval and so I was wondering is there a better way to do this? Am I missing something here, or is this how it's supposed to be done?</p>

<p>Now i want 3 tabs in the splitview and for each tab a new navigationcontroller.
But i don't know how to implement it.
I go to this code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setDetailItem:(id)newDetailItem {

    [detailItem release];
    detailItem = [newDetailItem retain];

    // Update the view.
    navigationBar.topItem.title = detailItem;

    if ([detailItem isEqualToString:@""Test""]) {
        TestViewController *testViewController = [[TestViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""TestView"" bundle:nil];
        [self.navigationController pushViewController:testViewController animated:NO];
        [mapViewController release];

    }
    if ([detailItem isEqualToString:@""Test2""]) {

    }

}

if (popoverController != nil) {
    [popoverController dismissPopoverAnimated:YES];
}

<p>But i know that i actually don't have to use 'pushviewcontroller', i just want a new navigationcontroller starting from that point, and so for each tab in the splitview. How can i accomplish this? I know it's really basic, but i cant figure it out.</p>

We use a lot of footers on our pages but they tend to be the same copy used over and over but with different dates and other small variations. So, on each page I create an array of variables. These match up with variables found in an external .js file containing a for loop to match up the requested variables that contain paragraphs of footer copy. This eventually is put together to make a div full of footer copy. </p>

<p>My question is this, is it better to send in the specific dates and other variable changes within the copy along with the variable array as one object or should i continue to just send in the variable array alone, create the footer in the html and then insert the dates/changing data in a separate .js file (this is how I've been doing it till now). One way keeps all the data together and seems pretty clean, but the other separates out the different steps (ie step one is creating the footer, the second step puts in the varying info like a date or bonus amount, etc). </p>

<p>sorry if this is confusing, hope i got the basic idea across. Just trying to explore my options since I have the unique opportunity of previous usage of this script and getting a clean slate to make a fresh version. </p>

I find them to be very vague or context-dependent.</p>

<p>For example we have a VM with the items list. The selection affects not only the accesibility of the buttons (i.e. command can execute) but also the behavior of VM: it matters one ore several items need simultaneous editing.<br/></p>

<p>The second example is the process of creating a new item.<br>
After user provided data we add item to items collection thus inserting it in the list and want to make it selected and focused. Now we do this by introducing <code>IsSelected</code> and <code>IsFocused</code> properties for item's VM. The real job is done by the View via bindings, attached properties and behaviors.</p>

<p>Some members of our team insits that adding such kind of properties (<code>IsVisible</code>, <code>IsSelected</code>, <code>IsFocused</code> an etc.) to VMs brings UI logic to VM and that is not a good practice because UI and presentation logic are mixed. <br/></p>

<p>For me following patterns is importand but more important not to repeat myself. I prefer bindings and   few lines in codebehind without casting DataContext to concrete VM's type, calling VM's methods and so on.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I do not like HolyWars and admit I can be wrong due to misunderstanding of these two terms and the criteria of separation one from the other.</p>

<p>I made a function on <code>stock</code> module, but when I declare this on my <code>xml</code> view, it returns <code>Undefined</code> tag, and I can't group line by date anymore.</p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

    x={}
    for record in self.browse(cr, uid, ids):

            x[record.id] = text(b(a))
        return x

    _columns = {
        'create_date': fields.date('Creation Date', readonly=True, select=True),
        'date_': fields.function(_date_, type='text', string='date copy', store=True),

<p>And on <code>stock_view.xml</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;filter string=""Creation"" name=""groupby_create_date"" icon=""terp-go-month"" domain=""[]"" context=""{'group_by':'date_'}""
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't actually group them, but show 'undefined' tag, and groups all lines without discrimination by month, which is the normal behavior of <code>create_date</code> date type field, so, how can I achieve this?</p>

<p>I'm making some tests, but I don't see any change on it.</p>

<p>Can someone please shed some light on this?</p>

This component is third party (written by another team).  myCli.dll has a dependency on myLibrary.dll which is written by yet another party.  The control lives in myAssembly.dll, which is a C# controls and resources library.</p>

<p>I had this control working great when myCli.dll didn't have a dependency on myLibrary.dll.  I could add it to forms, build it, and so on.  But the new version of myCli.dll came out and I relinked against it.  Suddenly, the IDE is behaving badly.  The key issue appears to be that the IDE is unable to resolve the myCli.dll dependency on myLibrary.dll.</p>

<p>When I attempt to drag the control from the toolbox to a design surface, I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>""Failed to create component 'MyControl'.

<p>My belief is that if I can figure out where to put myLibrary.dll, I will resolve the reference issue.  I don't know this for sure.  Does someone know what I should do to resolve the issue?</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Base {
    protected static Model model;
}

public class Inherited extends Base {
    static {
        model = initializationFunction();
    }
}
public class OtherInherited extends Base {
    static {
        model = otherInitializationFunction();
    }
}
// Example of use
Base[] inheriteds = new Base[] { new Inherited(), new OtherInherited() };
for (int i = 0; i &lt; inheriteds.length; i++)  {
     doStuff(inheriteds[i]).model; // This will always use the same model (last defined)
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the class initializes the static member at start. But it appears that it sets the value of model for the whole base class, and so all classes actually have the same model.</p>

<p>I need <code>model</code> to be static because the it needs to exist only once per subclass. My problem is how to have one static model per subclass, while still ensuring it is defined in the parent class (so if a class doesn't define it, it is defined in the parent class).</p>

<p>What is the expected behaviour of a protected static member in an inherited class? And how should I go about having my version of this member for each class, still static (I don't want it to duplicate for each instance)?</p>

data ds123;
    merge ds1 ds2 ds3;

<p><strong>I use:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""http://www.example.com/_css/_all/stylesheet-global-styles.css"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Alternative (relative):</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/_css/_all/stylesheet-global-styles.css"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I use site links is because I use a lot of vanity URL's such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>example.com/test => example.com/test.php</p>
  
  <p>example.com/test/1 => example.com/test.php?id=1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of the multiple '/' within the second example, my pages think that they are in a subdirectory of the website so therefore 'relative' links do not work unless I put in a '../'. I cannot do this because that would mean directories based upon whether or not a query string exists and how many '/' there are. Consequently I am forced to use site links to include my required content.</p>

<p><strong>I am aware that each request must therefore execute a DNS lookup and this will slow it down, but my question is, how much slower is it if I am linking, lets say, 5 stylesheets and scripts?</strong></p>

<p>Why is that? To be honest, I have some major problems with dependency in maven and eclipse. Maven adds them correctly but eclipse doesn't see it correctly. It's not only the junit. What should I check/set?</p>

<p>Should I install some plugin to eclipse for maven support ?</p>

<ol>
<li>Alloc and init the view controller. It uses a NIB file but that implementation is hidden in <code>-init</code>.</li>
<li>Create the person object and add 2 IOU object to that person.</li>
<li>I add that person to the <code>iouTableArray</code> which is the data source for the <code>UITableView</code>. The <code>UITableView</code> takes an array of persons and displays them in the view.</li>
<li>Calls <code>viewDidLoad</code>, etc and set the <code>delegate</code> (correctly?)</li>
<li>call <code>testViewDidLoad</code> passes</li>
<li>call <code>testCustomCell</code>. Create an <code>NSIndex</code> that will fetch the first row from the <code>UITableView</code>. The <code>CustomCell</code> subclass the <code>UITableViewCell</code> and have the property <code>personName</code> as a <code>UILabel</code>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Looking back at the code, I should call <code>cell.personName.text</code> to get the name string. However, the error I get is that <code>cell.personName</code> is <code>null</code>. Stepping through, I see that <code>iouTableView = (UITableView *) 0x00000000</code> which I think means null.</p>

<p>What can I do to test the cells in my <code>UITableView</code> and get it to work?</p>

I can certainly do this myself by saving the current values on edit, then comparing to the state of the fields on save, but I'd rather not add additional code if it's not necessary. Is there any easier way that I'm overlooking? Thanks!</p>

Then I'm doing some database operations which may fail due to problems with the data or because of some errors in the code. It would be great if I could ""bubble up"" the exception into the GUI. In my case I would need a blocking call to the GUI because of the way the assembly works. I'm not sure if this is a good idea but right now that's the only thing that comes to mind based on how the external code works.</p>

<p>The assembly assumes that if the callback (the event) returned safely then the data was processed succesfully - which may not be the case. Of course I would have to deal with the error in <em>some way</em> but that would mean that the server on the other side would always assume that the data was handled correctly.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I throw the exception <em>into</em> the GUI? If so, how?</li>
<li>How can I handle the exception in my event so that the assembly doesn't think I processed the data? Do I need some kind of blocking call/exception <em>into</em> the GUI? (Is this even possible?)</li>
<li>On a side note: Isn't that assembly <em>broken by design</em> somehow? Why would it automatically assume that everything went fine just based on if the callback returned?</li>

<p>I have a script that usually uses <code>@ARGV</code> arguments but in some cases it is invoked by another script (which I cannot modify) that instead only passes a config filename which among other things has the command line options that should have been passed directly.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>Args=--test --pdf ""C:\testing\my pdf files\test.pdf""
</code></pre>

<p>If possible I'd like a way to parse this string into an array that would be identical to <code>@ARGV</code>.</p>

<p>I have a workaround where I setup an external perl script that just echos <code>@ARGV</code>, and I invoke this script like below (standard boilerplate removed).</p>

<p><strong>echo-args.pl</strong></p>

<pre><code>print join (""\n"", @ARGV);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>test-echo-args.pl</strong></p>

<pre><code>$my_args = '--test --pdf ""C:\testing\my pdf files\test.pdf""';
@args = map { chomp ; $_ } `perl echo-args.pl $my_args`;
</code></pre>

<p>This seems inelegant but it works. Is there a better way without invoking a new process? I did try splitting and processing but there are some oddities on the command line e.g. <code>-a""b c""</code> becomes <code>'-ab c'</code> and <code>-a""b""""</code> becomes <code>-ab""</code> and I'd rather not worry about edge cases but I know that'll bite me one day if I don't.</p>

The same with some sub-optimal memory handling that I'm performing down below. This code below probably depicts a shallow copy, and I believe that's where my problem might be. I have some cookie-cutter code for an example that looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *user = [[xmlParser createArrayWithDictionaries:dataAsXML
                                              withXPath:kUserXPath] retain];
if([user count] &gt; 0) {
    self.name = [[user valueForKey:@""name""] copy];
}

// Crash happens if I leave the next line un-commented.
// But then we have a memory leak.
[user release]; 

[xmlParser release];
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately when I comment out <code>[user release]</code>, the code works, but we have an obvious memory leak. The method <code>createArrayWithDictionaries:withXPath:</code> was refactored last night when the SO community helped me understand better memory management. Here's what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSArray *)createArrayWithDictionaries:(NSString *)xmlDocument 
                               withXPath:(NSString *)XPathStr {
    NSError *theError = nil;
    NSMutableArray *dictionaries = [NSMutableArray array];
    CXMLDocument *theXMLDocument = [CXMLDocument alloc];
    theXMLDocument = [theXMLDocument initWithXMLString:xmlDocument
                                               options:0
                                                 error:&amp;theError]; 
    NSArray *nodes = [theXMLDocument nodesForXPath:XPathStr error:&amp;theError];

    for (CXMLElement *xmlElement in nodes) {
        NSArray *attributes = [xmlElement attributes];
        NSMutableDictionary *attributeDictionary;
        attributeDictionary = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
        for (CXMLNode *attribute in attributes) {
            [attributeDictionary setObject:[attribute stringValue]
                                    forKey:[attribute name]];
        }

        [dictionaries addObject:attributeDictionary];
    }

    [theXMLDocument release];
    return dictionaries;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing there's a couple of issues that might be going on here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto release on my dictionaries array is happening, thus my app crashing.</li></li>
<li>I'm not performing a deep copy, only a shallow copy. Thus when the user array is released, <code>self.name</code> is done for.</li>
</ul>

<p>With <code>NSZombieEnabled</code>, I see the following:</p>

<pre>
*** -[CFString respondsToSelector:]:
     message sent to deallocated instance 0x1ae9a0
</pre>

<p>Also, the final call where the backtrace shows this is crashing contains the following code in a separate module from the other two methods:</p>

<pre><code>User *u = self.user;
NSString *uri = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@/user/%@/%@"",
                         [self groupName], u.userId, kLocationsUri];
</code></pre>

<p>Between all the auto releasing/copies/retain happening between the client code and <code>createArrayWithDictionaries:withXPath</code>, I'm a bit confused as to the real problem here. Thanks again for helping me understand.</p>

<p>This is an overview of how I have designed the ETL process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two servers </li>
<li>Both are virtual machines </li>
<li>The SSIS packages run on an application server </li>
<li>The SQL Server database lives on a database server</li>
</ul>

<p>I use an OLE DB connection manager to connect from the SSIS package on the application server to the SQL Server database on the database server. </p>

<p>The packages run as a file system deployment on the application server and not as a database deployment on the database server.</p>

<p>The main reason for this is that the ETL is integrated with a set of tools no found on and drives not accessible to the database server. These tools include Apex Data Loader for Salesforce and pgAdmin III.</p>

<p>So far I cannot consistently reproduce this error. However, this is what I have observed: </p>

<ul>
<li>Failure occurs more frequently during regular business hours</li>
<li>Failure occurs less frequently during off hours</li>
</ul>

<p>For about a two hour period on a Friday morning I was able to successfully reproduce the error on a specific package.</p>

<p>The error occurred during a large data flow if a child package call that precedes the large data flow was enabled.</p>

<p>The error did not occur during the same large data flow if the child package call that precedes the large data flow was disabled.</p>

<p>The child package in question calls back to the database to retrieve a tiny amount of information for use in an email body and then sends the email.</p>

<p>It feels like maybe a resource limit is being exceeded? </p>

<p>Maybe a connection limit? </p>

<p>I am wondering what tools I should be using to try and determine the root cause of the error.</p>

<p><a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg162682%28v=ws.10%29.aspx"">Using Netsh Commands to Enable or Disable TCP Chimney Offload</a></p>

<p>Any help is appreciated. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Further testing shows that this is not ""an SSIS thing"" as the same error is seen at the same rate when using SQL Server Management Studio. The complexity of the query does not make the error more or less likely. In an attempt to resolve, we have tried one fix (below):
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><a href=""http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&amp;id=TECH197934""> #1 How to Disable TCP Chimney, TCPIP Offload Engine (TOE) or TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO).</a></strong></p>

<p>This was our first attempt. TCP Chimney is now disabled on the Application Server and the Database Server. Testing shows that the same error occurs at the same rate.
<br />
<br />
<br />
So where to go from here? Honestly I am not sure. One seemingly good option remains: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application Server and Database Server SQL Server installations do not exactly match</p></li>
<li><p>Application Server = SQL Server 2008 (SP1) - 10.0.2531.0 (X64)</p></li>
<li><p>Database Server = SQL Server 2008 R2 (SP1) - 10.50.2500.0 (X64) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The plan is to upgrade the SQL Server installation on the Application server. Its kind of a hit and hope, but at this point this seems like the best option. Something in my brain tells me that this might be solved by fixing a hardware issue (by that I mean a repair or a replace) and that there might not be anything that hardware and software configuration can do about it.</p>

<p>However, I am still not sure how to go about determining a root cause. I am still left wondering what tools I should be using to diagnose the root cause.</p>

<p>The div-1 shows my full image.</p>

<p>If I like to show only the top-left corner in the same window I make viewBox=""0 0 100 100"" (div-2) and it gives approximately what I want: the part of the image fitted to the window.</p>

<p>But when I do the same thing with the right-bottom corner (div-3 represents viewBox=""100 100 200 200"") the image is only translated but is not fitted/zoomed/scaled.</p>

<p>The div-4 nealry shows an example of my target achieved via another technique.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, there is no clear statement as to how weak references influence the lifetime of an object in .NET. If they are true weak refs they should not influence it at all, but that would also render them pretty useless for their, I believe, main purpose of caching (am I wrong there?). On the other hand, if they act like soft refs, their name is a little misleading.</p>

<p>Personally, I imagine them to behave like soft references, but that is just an impression and not founded.</p>

<p>Implementation details apply, of course. I'm asking about the mentality associated with .NET's weak references - are they able to expand lifetime, or do they behave like true weak refs? </p>

"32752990","1","","","2015-09-24 03:48:13","","-1","37","<p>Some context: I'm using Bigcommerce (which doesn't support PHP) to design a store-front and want to allow users to add a product inside of the checkout page <em>without</em> redirecting them to the cart page.  I know this is possible because on the front page, there are some pre-programmed buttons which are simply <code>&lt;a href=""http://somestore.com/cart.php?action=add&amp;product_id=9001""&gt;</code> tags with some button-like styling.  These pull up a modal, and most importantly <em>add the product to the cart</em> - both without redirect.</p>

<p>So at first this struck me as a simple problem - just <code>$.ajax</code> to the page and be done with it, but then I ran into the old <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> error, which is strange, since I'm writing my Javascript on the same domain that I'm trying to hit, only the sub-domain is different (/cart vs /checkout).  I decided to look deeper at the request made by this magical button.  The only Request Header which is not present on my own dysfunctional version of this request is <code>X-Requested-With</code> which I of course tried to add to my <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>The second thing I noticed was an extra URL paramter which wasn't originally listed in the source, <code>fastcart=1</code> so I tried adding that, and was taken to a PHP page I obviously wasn't meant to see.  It's easily roughly 200 lines of spaghetti, and I'm not sure I can post it here.  It's obvious that a script somewhere was taking this <code>href</code> and using it to make a GET request, but how?  I've tried both <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, and <code>ajax</code>, but both give me the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> response.</p>

<p>I've seen the use of a technique where you disallow the redirect of the page on an <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> by adding an <code>.click(function(e)</code> to it, and calling either <code>return false</code> or <code>e.preventDefault();</code> but these simply don't allow my <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> to accomplish anything at all, let alone some ninja <code>GET</code> request.  My question is ultimately about why my own attempts at a <code>GET</code> request to this page have failed, when a simple <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> has been able to bypass SOP and make the request almost in secret.</p>

<p>Obviously I'll have to spend some more time looking at the PHP script I was taken to by the extra parameter.  Nevertheless, this has turned out to be a much bigger mystery than I had originally thought it would be, teaching me a lot along the way.  Unfortunately, I haven't solved it yet, and I really need to get this functionality working.  If it's helpful for me of the source on these requests, I'll be happy to, but for now I've run out of time and have to get some rest. If some one with more web development experience can help, I would be extremely grateful!  </p>

<li><p>The hibernate session factory for this application will be instantiated once using the hibernate plugin that will be part of the struts config xml and will be saved as part of the servlet context and then the action class will pass this sessionfactory instance from the EJB session bean delegate to the hibernate DAO.</p></li>
<li><p>I guess this will be a clean approach, since the transaction will be managed by the EJB Session bean which are deployed onto the websphere.

<p><strong>The situation:</strong>
I have a site where we do live streaming. Simple pages with a player and chat or a twitter stream. Nothing that complicated. So an example, ClientA orders a live stream I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>1. create a client page: domain.com/clientA
    - landingspage with player and twitterstream and such
    - has a GA tracking code
2. domain.com/clientA/ec/
    - a page with only the player for iframe embedding purpose
    - also has a GA tracking code (same, for now)
3. domain.com/ec.php (or whatever)
    - a simple page with the iframe and some explanation
    - this is so they can embed the iFrame on their own site
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>
I can't seem to track when domain.com/clientA/ec/ has been iFramed on a site. So in my understanding the trackingcode on domain.com/clientA and domain.com/clientA/ec/ should differ from each other right?</p>

<p>Iv'e been reading up on <a href=""https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite?hl=nl#multipleDomains"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, but no luck so I thought maybe what I want is not possible without having control over the pages hosted on the other sites. Initially I thought it would be no hassle to do so when an embedcode is present on the page that will be iFramed.</p>

<p>So... could anybody explain in non Google english a bit better what is going on here? Don't get me wrong, Google does a pretty good job in codexing their stuff. Sometimes I just can't see the Wood for the Trees.</p>

But i am getting  --replSet error even though I have given it while creating a host. I am developing on a standalone machine with fedora linux.
Also can some one tell me how do I reset/remove the host once they are assigned.</p>

<p>I have an Ubuntu server <strong>A</strong> connected to a Gigabit switch with 2 other clients <strong>(B and C)</strong>. All machines have been installed with a gigabit NIC card</p>

<p>While Clients <strong>A B</strong> are operating at 1000mbps, client <strong>C</strong> is configured to run at 100Mbps by ethtool using the following command</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this setup, i have attempted to send a 500MB file from <strong>A</strong> to clients <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> at the same time via SCP.</p>

<p>I have expected the data transmission rate between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong> to be 100mbps, and <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> to be 1000mbps.</p>

<p>However in reality, the transmission rate of <strong>A</strong> to both <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> has been dropped to 100mbps.</p>

<p>My question is: is this behavior to be expected? If so, is there a way to send data from <strong>A</strong> to <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> concurrently at different network speeds?</p>

What I'm doing right now is to draw my custom background bitmap, then draw some text on it.</p>

<p>This is my drawframe method:</p>

<pre><code>        final SurfaceHolder holder = getSurfaceHolder();
        Canvas canvas = null;
        try {
            canvas = holder.lockCanvas();
            if (canvas != null) {

                if(mBackgroundBitmap != null) {
                    canvas.drawBitmap(mBackgroundBitmap, 0, 0, null);
                } else {
                    canvas.drawColor(Color.BLACK);
                }
                drawText(canvas);
            }
        }
        finally {
            if (canvas != null ) holder.unlockCanvasAndPost(canvas);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>It does work but obviousely when I change page on the homescreen I got a fixed background image and not a different ""portion"" like when I use a big Wallpaper.</p>

<p>I've tried also to set the wallpaper before locking the canvas but it doesn't work like expected:</p>

<pre><code>if(mBackgroundBitmap != null) {                 
                try {
                    setWallpaper(mBackgroundBitmap);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
final SurfaceHolder holder = getSurfaceHolder();
    Canvas canvas = null;
    try {
        canvas = holder.lockCanvas();
        if (canvas != null) {
            drawText(canvas);
        }
    }
    finally {
        if (canvas != null ) holder.unlockCanvasAndPost(canvas);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>What can I do to mantain the big background ""mobile"" when changing homescreen pages, but add some animation centered in the current page?</p>

<pre><code> std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; dbo;
 ...
 std::string val = map[""foo""];
</code></pre>

<p>all fine but it strikes me that ""foo"" is being converted to a temporary string on every call. Surely it would be better to have a constant std::string (of course its probably a tiny overhead compared to the disk IO that just fetched the object but its still a valid question I think). So what is the correct idiom for std::string constants?</p>

<p>for example - I can have </p>

<pre><code> const std::string FOO = ""foo"";
</code></pre>

<p>in a hdr, but then I get multiple copies</p>

<p>EDIT: No answer yet has said how to declare std::string constants. Ignore the whole map, STL, etc issue. A lot of code is heavily std::string oriented (mine certainly is) and it is natural to want constants for them without paying over and over for the memory allocation</p>

<p>EDIT2: took out secondary question answered by PDF from Manuel, added example of bad idiom</p>

<p>EDIT3: Summary of answers. Note that I have not included those that suggested creating a new string class. I am disappointed becuase I hoped there was a simple thing that would work in header file only (like const char * const ). Anyway</p>

<p>a) from Mark b</p>

<pre><code> std::map&lt;int, std::string&gt; dict;
 const int FOO_IDX = 1;
 ....
 dict[FOO_IDX] = ""foo"";
 ....
 std:string &amp;val = dbo[dict[FOO_IDX]];
</code></pre>

<p>b) from vlad</p>

<pre><code> // str.h
 extern const std::string FOO;
 // str.cpp
 const std::string FOO = ""foo"";
</code></pre>

<p>c) from Roger P</p>

<pre><code> // really you cant do it
</code></pre>

<p>(b) seems the closest to what I wanted but has one fatal flaw. I cannot have static module level code that uses these strings since they might not have been constructed yet. I thought about (a) and in fact use a similar trick when serializing the object, send the index rather than the string, but it seemed a lot of plumbing for a general purpose solution. So sadly (c) wins, there is not <em>simple</em> const idiom for std:string</p>

<p>I think the key here is Selenium, hence the tags. 
Just in case it matters: I'm working in Java, using NinjaFramewor, FluentLenium and Firefox. It runs locally, but also on a headless CI box with Xvfb.
I have some FluentLenium tests passing, so the whole thing isn't broken!</p>

<p>I have a web page, with a simple login form that performs a call to JavaScript which does an AJAX POST. The AJAX response is caught by JavaScript and causes some of the body of the page to update, with different results for login, register and fail. I can see this happening when I test by hand, and even when I run these tests locally.</p>

<p>The test looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import org.fluentlenium.adapter.util.SharedDriver;
import org.fluentlenium.core.annotation.Page;
import org.junit.Test;

@SharedDriver(deleteCookies=true)
public class UserControllerTest extends JSTest {

  @Page
  HomePage home;
  @Page 
  LoginPage login;

  @Test
  public void test_cantLoginUntilReg() {
    goTo(login);
    login.fillOutReg(""test_cantLoginUntilReg"");
    login.chooseLogin();    // script that POSTS and does AJAX update
    login.isErrorResult();  // errors
    goTo(login);
    login.fillOutReg(""test_cantLoginUntilReg"");
    login.chooseRegister();   // script that POSTS and does AJAX update
    login.isWelcomeResult();  // errors
    login.chooseHome();       // GET on home
    home.isLoggedIn();        // this works
}

// more tests
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the LoginPage, which is where I'm having trouble looks like (with a super class containing constants folded back in):</p>

<pre><code>public class LoginPage extends FluentPage {

  protected static final String HOME_PAGE = ""http://localhost:8080"";
  private static final String PAGE = HOME_PAGE + ""/login"";

  @AjaxElement
  FluentWebElement welcomeDiv;
  @AjaxElement
  FluentWebElement errorDiv;

  @Override
  public String getUrl() {
    return PAGE;
  }

  @Override
  public void isAt() {
    assertTrue(""url is "" + url(), url().contains(""login""));
    assertTrue(""h1 is "" + find(""h1"").getText(), find(""h1"").getText().contains(""Login""));
    assertTrue(""h1 is "" + find(""h1"").getText(), find(""h1"").getText().contains(""Register""));
  }

  public void isErrorResult() {
   assertTrue(""h1 is "" + find(""h1"").getText(), find(""h1"").getText().contains(""Failed""));
   assertNull(""cookie is "" + getCookie(SESSION_COOKIE_NAME), getCookie(SESSION_COOKIE_NAME));
 }

  public void fillOutReg(String testName) {
    fill(""#email"").with(testName + ""@UserControllerJSTests.test.com""); // this passes the minimal validation in place so far
    fill(""#password"").with(""reallyBadPassword"");
    fill(""#identName"").with(testName);  
  }

  public void chooseLogin() {
    executeScript(LOGIN_SCRIPT); // I'd prefer click on the form, but that seemed to be a source of trouble as well
  }

// and so on
}
</code></pre>

<p>The isErrorResult() method is never satisfied!
The find h1 shows that the h1 text is still as it was when the page was first loaded. 
Clearing the session cookie is showing different behaviour on different machines (probably needs to wait for something).
I've also tried testing the contents of welcomeDiv.
I have a feeling I ought to be able to use the @AjaxElement to help here, but I haven't quite worked out how.</p>

<p>I don't want to inspect the JSON coming back. I've got tests which don't involve Selenium that get pretty close to this already. </p>

<p>What I want to do is automate checking that the user will see the right thing at the browser end after a POST. Even if there is a work-around for this code, other functionality will have large enough uploads that GET really isn't sensible; and testable AJAX seems like a reasonable want.</p>

<p>Any ideas, please?</p>

I am trying to auto increment my build number in XCode 4.4 only when archiving my application (in preparation for a TestFlight deployment).

<p>This script updates the plist file appropriately and is reflected in XCode each time I archive. The problem is that the .ipa file that comes out of the archive process is still showing the previous build number. I have tried the following solutions with no success:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean before build</li>
<li>Clean build folder before build</li>
<li>Move Run Script phase to directly after the Target Dependencies step in Build Phases</li>
<li>Adding the script as a Run Script action in my scheme as a pre-action</li>
</ul>

<p>No matter what I do, when I look at the build log, I see that the info.plist file is being processed as one of the very first steps. It is always prior to my script running and updating the build number, which is, I assume, why the build number is never current in the .ipa file. </p>

<p>Is there a way to force the Run Script phase to run before the info.plist file is processed?</p>

Suppose I have two sections of respective class <code>.toggle0</code> and <code>.toggle1</code>, suppose I want to display <code>.toggle0</code> and hide <code>.toggle1</code> when clicking on some tag <code>.footer0</code>, and vice-versa : I want to display <code>.toggle1</code> and hide <code>.toggle0</code> when clicking on some tag <code>.footer1</code>. Now this code works correctly</p>

<pre><code>$('.toggle1').hide();
  var i=0;
    $("".footer""+i+"""").click(function(){
        $("".toggle""+(i+1) %2+"""").hide();
        $("".toggle""+i+"""").show();
    });
  var j=1;
    $("".footer""+j+"""").click(function(){
        $("".toggle""+(j+1) %2+"""").hide();
        $("".toggle""+j+"""").show();
    }); 
</code></pre>

<p>but this doesn't work in the sense that nothing happens on click event </p>

<pre><code>for(var i=0;i&lt;2;i++){
    $("".footer""+i+"""").click(function(){
            $("".toggle""+(i+1) %2+"""").hide();
            $("".toggle""+i+"""").show();
        });
} 
</code></pre>

<p>if I put this</p>

<pre><code>      $('.toggle1').hide();
      var i=0;
        $("".footer""+i+"""").click(function(){
            $("".toggle""+(i+1) %2+"""").hide();
            $("".toggle""+i+"""").show();
        });
       i =1;
        $("".footer""+i+"""").click(function(){
            $("".toggle""+(i+1) %2+"""").hide();
            $("".toggle""+i+"""").show();
        }); 
</code></pre>

<p><code>.toggle1</code> displays and <code>.toggle0</code> hides when clicking on some tag <code>.footer1</code> but  <code>.toggle0</code> does not display and <code>.toggle1</code> does not hide when clicking on some tag <code>.footer0</code> . It seems that the second click event takes precedence upon the first</p>

<p>with 2GB of RAM (on 32bit OS) I can't make it work with <code>L_size = 3000</code> which is pretty obvious since it would need approx. 2.4GB. </p>

<p>But when I start 2 copies of above program each with <code>L_size = 1500</code> it works - really slow but finally both returns <code>allocated</code> in console.
So the question is - how is that possible? Is it related to virtual memory?</p>

<p>It is possible to have one big array stored in virtual memory while operating on another - within one program?</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd:</p>

<p>3) load the UIWebView, which then requests ""vendor_assets.js"" (plus all the other files</p>

<p>4) because ""vendor_assets.js is already in the cache, we save the user 440k of download bandwidth.  faster launch times.  more money.  promotions. champagne. glory. eternal fulfillment.  all that shtuff.</p>

<p>The DB creation is asynchronous, and in my test case, I have a check to see if calling the create() function actually results in two distinct objects:</p>

<pre><code>var vows = require('vows'),
    assert = require('assert'),
    fs = require( 'fs' ),
    flatfileDB = require( '../lib/flatfileDB' );

var twoDBs = {};

vows.describe( 'flatfileDB' ).addBatch( {
    'creating the database': {
        topic: flatfileDB,
        'calling create': {
            topic: function( flatfileDB ) {
                flatfileDB.create( './createTest', this.callback );
            },
            'results in an object with the path passed in': function( err, db ) {
                assert.equal( db.getPath(), './createTest' );
            }
        },
        'calling create more than once': {
            topic: function( flatfileDB ) {
                flatfileDB.create( './db1', function( err, newdb ) {
                    twoDBs.db1 = newdb;
                    flatfileDB.create( './db2', function( err, newdb ) {
                        twoDBs.db2 = newdb;
                        this.callback( null, twoDBs );
                    } );
                });
            },
            'results in two objects with different paths.': function( err, dbs ) {
                console.log( 'twoDBs.  db1: ' + twoDBs.db1 + ', db2: ' + twoDBs.db2 );
                console.log( 'dbs: ' + JSON.stringify( dbs ) );
                assert.notEqual( twoDBs.db1.getPath(), twoDBs.db2.getPath() );
            }
        }
    },
}).run();
</code></pre>

<p>The output of those two console.log lines surprises me, though: </p>

<pre>
twoDBs.  db1: [object Object], db2: [object Object]
dbs: {}
</pre>

<p>since I'm passing twoDBs to the test callback, I had expected dbs and twoDBs to be the some object, but they don't appear to be.  Can anyone help me out with what's going on here?</p>

<p>At my workplace, we're trying to find the best way to create automated-tests for an almost wholly javascript-driven intranet application. Right now we're stuck trying to find a good tradeoff between:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application code in reusable and nest-able GUI components.</li>
<li>Tests which are easily created by the testing team</li>
<li>Tests which can be recorded once and then automated</li>
<li>Tests which do not break after small cosmetic changes to the site</li>
</ul>

<p>XPath expressions (or other possible expressions, like jQuery selectors) naively generated from Selenium-IDE are often non-repeatable and very fragile. Conversely, having the JS code generate special unique ID values for every important DOM-element on the page... well, that is its own headache, complicated by re-usable GUI components and IDs needing to be consistent when the test is re-run.</p>

<p>What successes have other people had with this kind of thing? How do you do automated application-level testing of a rich JS interface?</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>We are using JavascriptMVC 2.0, hopefully 3.0 soon so that we can upgrade to jQuery 1.4.x.</li>
<li>The test-making folks are mostly trained to use Selenium IDE to directly record things.</li>
<li>The test leads would prefer a page-unique HTML ID on each clickable element on the page...</li>
<li>Training the testers to write or alter special expressions (such as telling them which HTML class-names are important branching points) is a no-go.</li>
<li>We try to make re-usable javascript components, but this means very few GUI components can treat themselves (or what they contain) as unique.</li>
<li>Some of our components already use HTML ID values in their operation. I'd like to avoid doing this <em>anyway</em>, but it complicates the idea of ID-based testing.</li>
<li>It may be possible to add custom facilities (like a locator-builder or new locator method) to the Selenium-IDE installation testers use.</li>
<li>Almost everything that goes on occurs within a single ""page load"" from a conventional browser perspective, even when items are saved </li>
</ul>

<h2>Current thoughts</h2>

<p>I'm considering a system where a custom locator-builder (javascript code) for Selenium-IDE will talk with our application code as the tester is recording. In this way, our application becomes partially responsible for generating a mostly-flexible expression (XPath or jQuery) for any given DOM element. While this can avoid requiring more training for testers, I worry it may be over-thinking things.</p>

<p>Now i want to move each project and each solution to its own repository in the trunk directory. I've been trying with svnadmin dump and svndumpfilter, but the problem is the Node-path keeps staying like the old structure. How would one get to the following structure?</p>

<pre><code>[Software #1 Repo]
- trunk
- branches
- tags

[Software #2 Repo]
- trunk

[Shared Component #1 Repo]

<p>I do not get any errors or exceptions or anything. I am able to read from my database. Only update, add or delete do not persist.</p>

<p>Here is all what I tried</p>

<ol>
<li>One post mentioned changing transaction-type=""RESOURCE_LOCAL"" to JTA saying that RESOURCE_LOCAL does not persist at all. I think this is if you are using only hibernate and not managing your transactions while using RESOURCE_LOCAL. I believe spring manages the transactions for you.</li>
<li>Some mentioned doing em.flush or em.getTransaction.begin and commit after using persist. But I get this error every time I use the above mentioned operations.
Not allowed to create transaction on shared EntityManager</li>
</ol>

<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance</p>

Both of them has <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> class registered in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> with same <code>intent-filter</code>. The <code>intent-filter</code> is <code>android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED</code>. Both apps listen to incoming sms messages and do some according to SMS. Now my problem is the apps works well when only one installed. If I installed both the apps in my mobile when an SMS receives one app crashes. If I force stop anyone then the other app works fine. How to use two different <code>BroadcastRecivers</code> of two different Apps with same Intent-filter?
Please do give your suggestions. Thanks.</p>

<p>I have 2 models called 'User' and 'Enterprise'. Both of these have their own tables ('users' and 'enterprises' respectively). Both tables have an 'expiry_date' column.</p>

<p>The 'users' table contains a long list of users. A User can <em>optionally</em> belong to an Enterprise, but this isn't the case for every user (A User does not necessarily have to belong to any particular Enterprise). There is a field in the Users table, users.enterprise_id, where null ID's are also allowed, as the foreign key.</p>

<p>I want to produce a list which shows data from both the 'users' and 'enterprises' tables with a single column showing the expiry date. I want to be able to order the data by this one expiry date column. Problem is, because the data is coming from 2 different tables, I can only seem to order by User.expiry_date <strong>OR</strong> Enterprise.expiry_date using CakePHP's pagination/sorting capabilities.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what the solution is for this? I read about creating some kind of virtual field to hold the expiry dates, but this seems like overkill?</p>

<p>Relationships of my models are as follows, but I wasn't sure if these are correct:</p>

<p>app/Model/User.php:<br>
<code>public $belongsTo = array('Enterprise');</code></p>

<p>the wp_kses_post method in the code up above does return the short description from WooCommerce and places into the Google Calendar description so I will try that next.</p>

<p>I'm still pluggin away at this and after looking at some other websites tried the following</p>

<pre><code>$description .= sprintf( __('%s', 'woocommerce'), $order-&gt;email_order_items_table( true, false, true )) . PHP_EOL;

<p>Which is used to pass the same information on in an email to the site admin.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $order-&gt;email_order_items_table( true, false, true ); ?&gt;

My problem is, I don't know how to use terminal for development purposes (I've never really used it at all)
Why would I even be running a website on a terminal window rather than a browser where it should be run?
And lastly, can I run node.js code on a web browser, similar to how I run my javascript files? Or do i HAVE TO run Node.js on a terminal window if I want to test it or something?</p>

"19935978","1","19955338","","2013-11-12 17:31:42","","2","574","<p>I wanted to solve knights tour puzzle. When I searched it I come to know that there are many ways of solving it. In fact very efficient and fast algorithms for solving it including Warnsdoff's rule. But actually I never wanted to copy any of them. Then I saw a video describing a way of solving this on paper.Link of the video is www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdWM5pKYZCHw&amp;b=28 
I do not know if that way is already used or not but I decided to follow that. This is the link of algorithm. 
Firstly I will explain about that way of solving the knights tour. We suppose that we have an 8*8 chess board and we have given the starting position of the knight. Now I have subdivided the board into 4 systems of boxes. Left diamond system, right diamond system, left square system,  right square system. First I will check that in which system the knight is in start. Then I will fill that system first and then I will move to the next one. And for filling that system I will first move into the current block. The whole board is subdivided into 4 blocks(each block is (4*4) as you can see form the video. After filling that block I will move to the next block and so on. And after filling all blocks I will move to the next system. Now I have almost made it. I have made certain functions for finding current block, current system, whether a move is possible or not, next move of knight in block, block shifting and finally system shifting. Now I am using a 3D array to store some important information about each box. Array size is [8][8][2]. In the first element of each box I am storing the system number i.e I have assigned specific numbers to each of the four systems to recognize them later. Left diamond system=1, right diamond system=2, left square system=3, right square system=4. And in the next element of each box I am storing information about the box whether I have already moved into it or not. In the start these are all zero but as I will progress I will make them 1 which box I have moved. Now I am in the pre testing mode and I am facing some logical problem in the nextmove function. Rest of the functions are working perfect. I am giving the coded here but I am only giving the selected portion of the code which is important. One thing I forgot is that I am storing the current position of knight in an array named current position and I will change the current position as I move. In the whole code m represents the current row of the knight and k represents the current column. Here is the code</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
// zero element for storing current row and 1 element for current column of knight.    
int currentposition[2]={0,0};
// 3d array for storing information

<p>Moreover, movepossible function is also working perfect. Now problem is when I calls the next move function, It makes first and second move correctly but it does not make the third move in the block. In fact there are total three moves in a block of a particular system, In other words it does not move to the last one box in block. It does not depends on starting position, for every starting position it is behaving like this. Now I have spent lot of time to find what is the problem but did not find it. So please tell me where is the problem. Also if you have any suggestions to improve the logic and code.
The output of the code is like this when I enter starting position (4,3)</p>

<pre><code>6,2     //first move      

7,0     //second move

7,0     //not moved to the third one which is (5,1)


current block is3   //these are working perfect.
movepossible is1
current system2
</code></pre>

<p>But output should be like this (for (4,3) only)</p>

<pre><code>6,2     //first move      

7,0     //second move

5,1     //third move

current block is3   //these are working perfect.
movepossible is1

<p>I don't know why the error occurs. If LibA links to LibB and LibC, why should Plugin have to 'know' about LibB as well? Why doesn't this error occur in all cases (ie no errors related to undefined symbols with LibC)?</p>

When moving the window from one monitor to the other, there's a long freeze as the window touches the end of the one screen, before starting to show on the next. Basically, as long as the window spans both monitors in any way, it moves in a very slow and stuttering way. The weird thing is that as long as it is only on monitor all is well.

<p>The brush resource is a DrawingBrush i downloaded from Xamalot.com. I picked the trashcan icon because it has reasonable complexity and uses a fair number of gradients. I have RenderingOptions.CachingHint=""Cache"" set on the DrawingBrush. I tried freezing the brush, but it made no difference.</p>

<p>The window loads very fast, many orders of magnitude faster than the equivalent code using PNGs. I just can't figure out why dragging between monitors is such a bad experience.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas? Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The XAML of the window is tiny:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class=""VectorIconEvaluation.VectorWindow""
    xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
    xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""

&lt;Grid UseLayoutRounding=""True"" SnapsToDevicePixels=""True""&gt;
    &lt;WrapPanel x:Name=""_wrapPanel""/&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>This it just a proof of concept, so the use of MVVM is irrelevant. The full application does use MVVM.</p>

<p>On a team of half a dozen developers, I am the only one experiencing the following problem so we are reasonably sure that it is something local to myself but we can't seem to track down what is causing it.</p>

<p>Using a Orchard based site, the default home page is overridden using a Route provider:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;RouteDescriptor&gt; GetRoutes()
        {
            return new[]{
                new RouteDescriptor{
                    Name = ""Homepage"",
                    Priority = 85,
                    Route = new Route(
                        """",
                        new RouteValueDictionary{
                            {""area"", ""Area""},
                            {""controller"", ""BingoGame""},
                            {""action"", ""BingoRealm"" },
                            {""realm"", ""realmName"" }
                        },
                        new RouteValueDictionary(),
                        new RouteValueDictionary{
                            {""area"", ""Area""}
                        },
                        new MvcRouteHandler())
                },
                ...
</code></pre>

<p>However, once I log in to the application (where I expect to the be taken to the home page the following error occurs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No route in the route table matches the supplied values.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Exception Details:</strong> System.InvalidOperationException: No route in the route table matches the supplied values.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Source Error:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>Line 160:            public void EndProcessRequest(IAsyncResult result) {
Line 161:                try {
Line 162:                    _httpAsyncHandler.EndProcessRequest(result);
Line 163:                }
Line 164:                finally {
</code></pre>

<p>So here we have somewhere that establishes a route yet try to access that route and nothing is found.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, only myself is experiencing this particular error and we can think of nothing local to my machine that should be influencing this matter.</p>

<p>Solutions? Suggestions? Questions?</p>

<p>I want that if the user exits or navigates away from the page before a partner is being found, then his entry must be deleted from the db.</p>

<p>I am trying to store the 'id' created against the user inside a session variable, make an ajax call and delete the entry, but somehow this concept is not working.The data is not getting deleted.

<p>My mapping:</p>

<pre><code>class OrderMap:ClassMap&lt;Order&gt; {

    public OrderMap(){
        Id(x=&gt;x.OrderId).GeneratedBy.Identity();
        Map(x =&gt; x.ForFavorites);
        References(x =&gt; x.Owner, ""UserId"");
        ...
    }
}

class UserMap:ClassMap&lt;User&gt; {
    public UserMap() {
        Id(x =&gt; x.UserId).GeneratedBy.Assigned();
        HasManyToMany(x =&gt; x.Favorites)
            .AsBag()
            .LazyLoad()
            .Table(""Favorites"")
            .ParentKeyColumn(""UserId"")
            .ChildKeyColumn(""FavoriteId"")
            .Cascade.All();
        HasManyToMany(x =&gt; x.FavoritesOrderers)
            .AsBag()
            .LazyLoad()
            .Table(""FavoriteOrderers"")
            .ParentKeyColumn(""UserId"")
            .ChildKeyColumn(""FavoriteId"")
            .Cascade.All();
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>--update: add some SQL</strong></p>

<p>SQL may be like this:</p>

<p><code>:userId</code> is id of favorite User</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM [Order] o
JOIN [User] u ON o.owner = u.userId
WHERE (
    (o.ForFavorites = false) || 
    (o.ForFavorites = true &amp;&amp; :userId IN
        (SELECT favoriteId FROM [Favorites] f WHERE (f.UserId = u.userId))
))
</code></pre>

<p>Are there some other variations with better perfomance?..</p>

<p>For opposite way:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *  
FROM [Order] o
JOIN [User] u ON o.owner = u.userId
INNER JOIN [FavoriteOrderers] fo ON fo.favoriteId=u.userId
WHERE (fo.userId = :userId)

One of them is Charts (<a href=""https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts</a>). In order to migrate my project from Swift 1.2 to Swift 2 I have gone through the wizard that comes up when first opening the project with XCode 7. The Charts module is already available for Swift 2, and I have changed my Podfile to contain the following in order to upgrade to this newer and not yet officially released version:</p>

<p><code>pod 'Charts', :git =&gt; 'https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts.git'</code></p>

<p>Now the project workspace opens fine in XCode except one error message that I can't get rid of myself, and I cannot find any helpful informations in the web:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/GFd1q.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/GFd1q.png"" alt=""error message in XCode""></a></p>

<p>At the place where I import my ""Charts"" module the above mentioned error message pops up. First, I made sure the whole project is set to deployment target IOS 9.0 as it was 8.0 before. </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/s002v.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/s002v.png"" alt=""deployment target for the project""></a></p>

<p>As this didn't solve the issue, I have done Product -> Clean, Product -> Clean Build Folder and finally deleted the ""Derived Data"" folder's contents. I also have re-started XCode after all these steps but the error still appears.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a clue what I could have missed? Thank you very much!</p>

At the end of the Railscast, he introduces Koala, which allows you to interact with the open graph api. Ryan gives instructions to pass the oath token as a parameter into this</p>

<pre><code>@graph = Koala::Facebook::API.new(your_oauth_token)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm having trouble getting this to work because I'm not sure where to get the oath token from. Let me explain....</p>

<p>In the sessions_controller.rb, we have this</p>

<pre><code> def create
    user = User.from_omniauth(env[""omniauth.auth""])
    session[:user_id] = user.id

    redirect_to root_url

  end
</code></pre>

<p>which saves the omniauth information to the database in the User model</p>

<pre><code>  def self.from_omniauth(auth)
  where(auth.slice(:provider, :uid)).first_or_initialize.tap do |user|
    user.provider = auth.provider
    user.uid = auth.uid
    user.name = auth.info.name
    user.oauth_token = auth.credentials.token
    user.oauth_expires_at = Time.at(auth.credentials.expires_at)
    user.save!
  end
</code></pre>

<p>so I'm guessing I need the <code>user.oath_token</code> passed into </p>

<pre><code>@graph = Koala::Facebook::API.new(your_oauth_token)
</code></pre>

<p>but I can't get it to work. </p>

<p>Can you please imagine that I have a Main controller and an index action. </p>

<pre><code>Main_controller.rb
   def index
       @graph = Koala::Facebook::API.new(how do I get the oauth token in here?)
   end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
How would I get the oath token (from either the session or the database) into the index method of the main controller? </p>

<p>For example, using the helper method in application_controller.rb</p>

<pre><code>  def current_user
  @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]

   end
  helper_method :current_user
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to do this in main_controller.rb </p>

<pre><code>  def index
    @graph = Koala::Facebook::API.new(current_user.oauth_token)
    @graph_data = @graph.get_object(""/me/statuses"", ""fields""=&gt;""message"")

    end
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I tried to loop through data using the following</p>

<p>Views/main/index.html.erb</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if current_user %&gt;

Looping through your statuses:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;% @graph_data.each do |status| %&gt;
&lt;%= status[""message""] %&gt; (&lt;i&gt;&lt;%=status[""updated_time""]%&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;% end %&gt;

I have product information in a MySQL database and product images stored in separate image folders.  Now I create a product page I retrieve all information from database successfully. Every product has a specific id and his image is same name with product id. How to retrieve product image that match with product id.
My PHP Codes:</p>

<pre><code>$id = $_SESSION[‘company_id’];

$sql = mysql_query(""SELECT  product_id FROM product_s WHERE product_id LIKE '$id%'"");

while($result = mysql_fetch_assoc($sql)){
    $image = $result['product_id'].'.jpg';
}

$location = '../../images/companies/'.$_SESSION['company_id'].'/products/';

$img = scandir($location);

$result_image = in_array($image, $img);

echo’&lt;img src=” ’.$location.’/’.$result_image.’ ” alt=”$result_image”&gt;’;

The correct price list to be used for a given product is determined by several product parameters which I already know. But, not all parameters apply to all price lists. Here's example 'criteria' for 3 price lists:</p>

<pre><code>pricelist_key    param     value
A                size      n1
A                weight    n2
A                color     n4
B                size      n5
B                weight    n6
B                color     n8
B                type      n10
C                weight    n2
C                min_size  n5
</code></pre>

<p>The question to answer is this: ""which set of criteria values, identified by pricelist_key, does my product meet""?</p>

<p>I've ensure that each set of parameter values is unique--in other words, each pricelist has a unique set of criteria and/or values--I cannot meet all criteria for more than one price list. I know in advance the complete set of parameters from which all price lists must be built, but any given price list may use as its criteria any subset of those parameters.</p>

<p>Procedurally, I'd loop through products, loop through price lists, and loop through parameters. The first parameter I missed would drop me out to the next price list until I found the one price list for which product meets all criteria. The next step is to simply look up a date in the identified price list and get the one price that is found there.</p>

<p>But I'm dealing with sets (in this context 'price list criteria sets') and I'd like to understand how to see this as a natural SQL problem--because it seems like it should be. I'm free to re-design the way the criteria are managed, this is simply the corner I painted myself into. The design goal was to handle the many varied parameters that can be used for defining price list criteria.</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :compus, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :companies, :through =&gt; :compus
end

class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :compus, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :employees, :through =&gt; :compus, :source =&gt; :user
  has_one  :owner, :through =&gt; :compus, :source =&gt; :user, :conditions =&gt; { :owner =&gt; true }
end

class Compu &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company
  belongs_to :user
end
</code></pre>

<p>The compus table has the following columns (copied from the migration)</p>

<pre><code>create_table :compus do |t|
  t.references :company
  t.references :user
  t.string     :job_title
  t.boolean    :owner, null: false, default: false

  t.timestamps
end
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see, I have a user who can create n companies and have jobs at n companies, having a job at a company does not mean he's the owner..</p>

<p>What I would like to get is:</p>

<p>user.companies        #=> The companies the user has created, or have jobs at (I worry about filtering results later)</p>

<p>company.employees     #=> All the users that have jobs at this company (through compus)</p>

<p>company.owner         #=> The one user that has originally created the company (or another one if transferred later)</p>

<p>So I added the following spec before I wrote the code above.</p>

<pre><code>it ""has one owner"" do
  company = Factory(:company)
  user    = Factory(:user)

  company.should respond_to(:owner)

  user.companies &lt;&lt; company

  company.owner.should === user
end
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm getting the following error:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveRecord::HasOneThroughCantAssociateThroughCollection:
       Cannot have a has_one :through association 'Company#owner' where the :through association 'Company#compus' is a collection. Specify a has_one or belongs_to association in the :through option instead.
</code></pre>

<p>So how can resolve this problem without adding more columns to the companies table, it would be easier if I added <em>owner_id</em> on the companies table but that would lead to duplications in the database, usually if a user created a company it means that he works at it</p>

<p>Another question while I'm at it, How can I easily access the :job_title that is on the compus table through the association?</p>

Thread T creates an instance of another class B (mutable)  e.g.</p>

<pre><code>B b = new B();

<p>Now it constructs an instance of class C and starts the Thread e.g.</p>

<pre><code>C runnable = new C(b);                          // (1)
new Thread(runnable).start();     //(2)

<p>As per Java Language Spec 17.4.4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An action that starts a thread synchronizes-with the first action in the thread it
  Starts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>=> statement (2) above synchronizes-with statement (4).</p>

<p>Next section of same spec 17.4.5 says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an action x synchronizes-with a following action y, then we also have hb(x,
  y). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>=> here statement (2) happens-before statement (4)</p>

<p>Also, statement (1) which comes before statement (2) can not be re-ordered (otherwise a code in run() of C might detect that)by compiler as (1) comes before (2) in program order (intra-thread semantics). That means, statement (1) will come before (4) in execution order.</p>

<p>My question is whether this way of passing reference (here ‘b’) from one thread to onother is safe?</p>

<p>It's working fine for first UITextField. But, when I try to move to second UITextField then again keyboardShown() is called and my view move back to bottom. I'm not able to detect the actual cause. Please let me know if I'm missing anything.</p>

"12769656","1","12769969","","2012-10-07 14:24:23","","2","510","<p>The behavior I want to implement is to display a view at 1:1 scale by default. If its container is made larger (by the user dynamically resizing the parent JFrame) the view should be scaled to fit the larger area; if made smaller, the view should be scaled to fit the smaller area - up to a limit. When smaller than a minimum size, scroll bars should appear with a viewport to support navigating around the view which is displayed at its minimum scale.</p>

<p>I have a poorly-functioning implementation now, using a JScrollPane and a ComponentListener to determine when a resize has occurred. Based on the new size a new scale factor is set for painting the view to fit (up to the minimum scale), the preferredSize of the view is set and revalidate() is called. The problem is that this results in ""jittery"" display; when sizing past the points where a new scale is applied to avoid displaying scrollbars, the scrollbars appear, then disappear. I believe this is because my approach is reactive, not predictive. That is, the LayoutManager is only looking at the view's preferredSize and performing layout based on that. I'm listening for the resize of the JScrollPane and when it is too small only then changing the preferredSize of the view and then causing the container to be laid out again with the call to revalidate(). At least that's how I understand it.</p>

<p>I've been reviewing the source for JScrollPane, JViewport and their respecive LayoutManagers. At this point I""m considering subclassing one or more to have a better (predictive, resulting in smoother sizing) implementation. This seems like behavior that others must have implemented before. Is there another way to use existing Containers/LayoutManagers/methods to do this without subclassing and risking unintended behavior across different LnF or platforms?</p>

<p>Edit: I've hacked a prototype subclass of ScrollPaneLayout. It checks for the view's minimum size before adding scrollbars. This is working (in that the scrollbars do not appear until the viewport is smaller than the view's minimum size, instead of the original behavior which displayed scrollbars when the viewport was smaller than the view's preferred size) but when the scrollbars are displayed the view thinks it is still the preferred size, not the minimum size. I may have to hack at the ViewportLayout class as well, but this is quickly becoming something that I doubt will be robust.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I went back to basics and tried the suggestions again, and have been succcessful. My attempts to overload the default behavior of ScrollPaneLayout and ViewportLayout, and the interactions between them was not the right direction. After my first attempt I was convinced that there was no way to avoid the flickering and instability of my ""reactive"" approach to fixing incorrect sizing after the LayoutManagers had done their thing. Fortunately, there is a way to make this work without subclassing either LayoutManager - and as stated, it's by implementing the <code>Scrollable</code> interface (which I had done correctly before, but had not made other changes to make it work). The trick is indeed to implement getScrollableTracksViewport() such that it returns true/false depending on the viewport size. What I hadn't done was update the view's preferredSize in addition to the other calculuations I was doing. This was a critical step. (Note that I'm also relying on listening to ComponentListener.componentResized() notifications to trigger the calculations needed to properly set the return values) The functioning code follows, thatnks for the help.</p>

    }"",
      :accept =&gt; 'RolesUsersSelection',
      :hoverclass =&gt; ""#{drop_class}_active""

<p>Which results in the following Javascript Code</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; 
//&lt;![CDATA[
jQuery('#RemoveThisMember').droppable({accept:'RolesUsersSelection', drop:function(drag_element, drop_element, event){

    }, hoverClass:'ProjectRoleDropDelete_active'})
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Yet I'm stumped as to why this isn't working. </p>

<p>This is the function called in the jRails.rb</p>

<pre><code> def drop_receiving_element_js(element_id, options = {})
    #convert similar options

Secondly, i put the break point inside the callback and i found that the callback gets executed once, before i close the stream, and the program keeps updating the stream. At this point the stream position is around 913(mostly random).

I am facing one issue the library does send the sms if its less than 150 character but as the number of character increased it dont send sms . </p>

<p>I searched on twilio website and figure out this </p>

<p>Yes. With the Messages resource URI, you can send messages containing up to 1600 characters. Learn about the Message functionality here. Note: the SMS resource URI is deprecated and does not support >160 characters.</p>

<p>Where as when i see the code of twilio library for codegnitor it has this function .</p>

<pre><code>  public function sms($from, $to, $message)
    {
        $url = '/' . $this-&gt;api_version . '/Accounts/' . $this-&gt;account_sid . '/SMS/Messages';
        $data = array(
                    'From'   =&gt; $from,
                    'To'   =&gt; $to,
                    'Body' =&gt; $message,
        );
        if ($this-&gt;mode == 'sandbox')
            $data['From'] = $this-&gt;number;
        return $this-&gt;_twilio-&gt;request($url, 'POST', $data);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and from the twilio website its using this </p>

<pre><code>   /2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{MessageSid}
</code></pre>

<p>where as in twillio codeignitor library he has this </p>

<pre><code>   '/' . $this-&gt;api_version . '/Accounts/' . $this-&gt;account_sid . '/SMS/Messages';
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way that i can do changes and i can send more character using twillio Codeignitor library ?</p>

<p>If check box #16 equals true, then print range ""B2:U51"", else Next i</p>

<p>If check box #17 equals true, then print range ""W2:AP51"", else Next i</p>

<p>A templated function gives me the convenience to operate on a variety of types:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt; void destroy(T* obj) {
    delete obj;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But at some point I want to do some specialization on a class hierarchy:</p>

<pre><code>class Base { virtual void doSomething(); };
class Derived : public Base {};
void destroy(Base* obj) {
    obj-&gt;doSomething();
    delete obj;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The intended specialized function did invoked if I a pass the exact type <code>Base*</code>, however the rules of overload resolution seems to prefer the generic templated version instead of performing a static up cast if I a pass <code>Derived*</code> to <code>void detroy()</code>.</p>

<p>Certainly I can make all the overloaded functions for all possible derived types, but it's less maintainable.</p>

<p>I am using Visual C++ 2008, is there any way around the above problem?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Now there are many more of these blocks following a similar pattern whereby (in the first line) the name attribute changes (from ""bob"" to something else). What I would like to do is firstly be able to select the ""bob"" p block and then retrieve all the html until the terminating p block in the last line. </p>

<p>I have attempted the following:</p>

<pre><code>Elements innerStuff = doc.select(""a:contains(bob) ~ *"");
</code></pre>

<p>But it only gives me links with href atrributes, which I guess is the what will be expected. However, I'm struggling to see how else I can solve this problem?</p>

<p>Your help in this regard is highly appreciated.</p>

<br>
The problem : <strong>Loop wont ever stop!</strong> <em>It will reach 4035 row and then start all over from the 1st row</em><br><br></p>

<p>Things I tried to make it stop:</p>

<ol>
<li>Added - <code>if ($loopstimes &gt; 4400) {break;}</code></li>
<li>Limited mysql query to 4050 rows</li>
</ol>

<p>The weird parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>When i limit mysql query to <code>LIMIT 900</code>, Everything works <strong>PERFECTLY</strong>. The loop stops when 900 post are added, if i add 950, the script will add 943 posts and then will give me <code>Fatal error ""Maximum execution time reached""</code>. Then the script stops. </li>
<li>I increase the ""Maximum execution time"" to <strong>300 Sec</strong> and increase the memory from 128 to 256MB, i use my query without LIMIT and then the Loop wont ever stop.</li>

<p>Let's say a user links his app against a library I wrote and I want to let him specify a callback function that I will call whenever an error occurs in my library. The implementation below works but I want to double check that I'm not missing something here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thread safety</li>
<li>DLL initialization issues</li>
<li>Public API considerations (I'm giving away a reference to an instance from the DLL is that OK?)</li>
<li>Anything that could be done better to hide implementation details from the public API?</li>

<p>I also have a <code>~/Sites</code> directory</p>

<p>When I create a new localhost WordPress site (like the one I'm currently working on) via Varying Vagrant Vagrants it ends up in a directory like <code>~/Sites/vagrant-local/www/my-website/htdocs/</code></p>

<p>Most of the work will be on the theme so that path ends up looking like: <code>~/Sites/vagrant-local/www/my-website/htdocs/wp-content/themes/my-theme</code></p>

<p>Since I have a starter theme I work from I have <code>~/repos/my-theme</code> and without thinking it through I copied it into place (the location in the above paragraph) and ended up with nested git repos and credential problems (while I hear nested repos are possible, I do not want that level of complexity, I'm just starting to understand how to use git).</p>

<p>Forgive me if my terminology is off, using a localhost and the command line are fairly new to me.</p>

<p>I think what I want is a <code>symlink</code>. I want these 2 directories to function as if they are one directory (so that file changes propagate to both) so that my theme's repo stays in <code>~/repos/my-theme</code> but that I can use Varying Vagrant Vagrants for my localhost server so I can enjoy both a local machine and version control.</p>

<p>How would I set this up?</p>

<p>If a symlink isn't the right solution to this problem, what is?</p>

<p>Should I just <code>cp</code> the repo to the localhost theme location and then <code>rm -R .git</code>?</p>

The preferred way to edit the data is to use Microsoft Excel. Due to the differences in platforms, the current workflow is comprised of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>dumping the data into a CSV file on the server</li>
<li>ftp/sftp/scp the file to the Windows machine</li>
<li>edit the data on Windows in Excel</li>
<li>ftp/sftp/scp the file back to the server box</li>
<li>import the data into the server</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm looking for a way to simplify the workflow and possibly doing everything from Excel. I know I could set up a full-blown web-server with CGI support to interface between HTTP on one end and export/import scripts on the server. Or I could run an in-process web-server that would serve the configuration data as if it was a file, and then it could take the input back from Excel and handle it.</p>

<p>My difficulty is that I do not know how exactly Excel pushes the file back if it was open over HTTP. Is it as simple as a POST method with some arguments? Or do I need to support a full set of WebDAV methods to accept the input from Excel?</p>

<p>So I get:</p>

<p>Apple 0</p>

<p><strong>Instead of:</strong></p>

<p>IBM   7</p>

<p>MS    2</p>

<p>Apple 5</p>

<p>I know, the main problem is <strong>CurrentMember</strong> property, and it's always zero because there is on CurrentMember on given dimension. Please, do not answer with: 'Filter it on ""Food""'
because I'm trying to build something more complex and this is a first step.</p>

<p>Is there any trick to get this Measure work?</p>

<p>one of the issues we're having is that we sometimes receive json input where a number field is represented as a string instead of a number</p>

<pre><code>//example json object with string representation of ""id""
{
    ""id"" : ""12545""
}


//example json object with number representation of ""id""
{
    ""id"" : 12345
}

<p>these needs to get deserialized into the following class</p>

<pre><code>case class example(id:Int)

<p>this is our general setup for deserializing json into arbitrary classes</p>

<pre><code>import org.json4s.native.Serialization._
import org.json4s._
import org.json4s.native.JsonMethods._

object Json {
    implicit val formats = DefaultFormats

        org.json4s.native.JsonMethods.parse(input).extract[T]
    }
}

<p>but whenever we attempt to parse the json object with string representation of the id it throws and exception with the message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No usable value for offers No usable value for id Do not know how to
  convert JString(12545) into int</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been looking around for a way to set a custom reader for Integer fields where it attempts to parse strings into Integers but I've yet to find a solution that covers our use case. What we need is a general catch all solution in order to support legacy applications.</p>

"28913526","1","","","2015-03-07 09:50:54","","3","67","<p>for a current project, I need to implement custom, but pre-defined network protocol in an efficient way, because the software will run in a multi-user environment which is not very small. It is important, that the protocol handling itself is very fast and there is just a small overhead so the CPU and other hardware can be fully used for the work of the server itself.</p>

<p>I know that there are already questions about similar things, but I think that my question is somehow different. </p>

<p>Let me show you two different approaches I am currently having:</p>

<p><strong>Approach 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class CommandRegistry {
    private HashMap&lt;String, HashSet&lt;CommandExecutor&gt;&gt; mainHandlers = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

    public void registerMainHandler(CommandExecutor executor, String command) {
        if (mainHandlers.get(command) == null) {
            HashSet&lt;CommandExecutor&gt; executors = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
            executors.add(executor);

            mainHandlers.put(command, executors);
        } else {
            HashSet&lt;CommandExecutor&gt; executors = mainHandlers.get(command);
            executors.add(executor);

            mainHandlers.remove(command);
            mainHandlers.put(command, executors);
        }
    }

    public void executeCommand(String command) {
        for (CommandExecutor executor : mainHandlers.get(command)) {
            executor.call();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>CommandExecutor</code> class would be abstract here and of course have sub-classes which implement the commands of the protocol.<br>
In this approach, the command registry already knows from the beginning which executor is used for which part of the protocol, so I think it is not very dynamic but I guess it would be enough for my needs.</p>

<p><strong>Approach 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class CommandRegistry {
    private List&lt;CommandExecutor&gt; executors = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

    public void registerCommand(CommandExecutor executor) {
        this.executors.add(executor);
    }

    public void callCommand(String command) {
        for (CommandExecutor exec : executors) {
            exec.callCommand(command);
        }
    }
}

public abstract class CommandExecutor {
    List&lt;String&gt; myCommands;

    public CommandExecutor(String... commands) {
        this.myCommands = commands.toArray();
    }

    public void callCommand(String command) {
        if (this.myCommands.contains(command)) {
            this.executeCommandProcedure();
        }
    }

    // This method contains the actual command procedure
    protected abstract void executeCommandProcedure();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this approach, only the <code>CommandExecutor</code> itself knows whether it wants to handle a command or not. On call of a command, we would walk through <strong>all</strong> of the registered handlers and call a method of those which <strong>could</strong> be unefficient, as I think.</p>

<p>Know, my question is which design is better in your honest opinion. Please consider Design as well as Performance when answering, because both are very important to me.</p>

<p>Maybe you can even recommend a better Design (which is also more efficient)?</p>

<p>// EDIT:<br>
After thinking about the design again, I came to finding another approach, based on the external library ""Netty"" which I want to use for networking.<br>
I thought that I write <code>ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter</code> classes for each part of the protocol that I want to process and add them into the Netty pipeline. Would that be efficient or too costly for Netty?</p>

<p>However the sample code does not seem to work, I'm getting 'could not authenticate you' or 'incorrect signature'..</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I've tried Pavel's solution, and it works as long as the new message is only one word long, but as soon as it contains spaces, i get this error:</p>

<p>When I verify my Database I have to enter three Parameter fields:</p>

<ol>
<li>Part Number</li>
<li>Alternative </li>
<li>LayerCode</li>
</ol>

<p>In the program, there are fields which are linked to  layers that contain a different LayerCode. So when I am forced to input a LayerCode, most of the fields will not display because that LayerCode number is not associated with the layer of that field. For Example</p>

<p>Field ""MaxOD"" uses layer ""Jacket"". Layer Jacket has a LayerCode = 20
Field ""Stranding"" uses layer ""Conductor"". Layer Conductor has a LayerCode = 10</p>

<p>So when I Verify the database and am forced to enter a LayerCode (For this example I will pick 10)
Only the fields linked to the ""Conductor"" layer will be displayed. so ""MaxOD"" will be blank and ""Stranding"" will be filled in.</p>

<p>Is there a way to override the parameter field value by creating a subreport which always has the LayerCode = 10 (or whatever the layercode should be for that field) or is there an easier way of obtaining the same result?</p>

<p>This is not for linear regression so I don't have a predictor and response relationship. I am simply using a model that will improve accuracy by normalizing my data. (hence I can't use the boxcox function since it only works with linear models).</p>

<p>the data I'm trying to transform is:</p>

<pre><code>vect
 [1]  99.64  49.71 246.84  96.17  16.67 352.00 421.25  81.77 105.00  37.85
</code></pre>

<p>I have looked at this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22339211/optimize-box-cox-transform-function-cannot-be-evaluated-at-initial-parameters"">post</a>.</p>

<p>It was not clear on what was being done and how the optimize function is being used but I did manage to modify the function to create a function that I would like to minimize.</p>

<pre><code>xskew &lt;- function(data,par) {
abs(skewness((data^par-1)/par)) }
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to input a sequence of values for lambda (perhaps between 0.5 and 1 with jumps of 0.01) and find which one of those values minimizes xskew for my dataset.</p>

<p>I have tried to do this with the optim function but with no luck so I don't think this might be the right function for me.
How do I perform this calculation? </p>

<p>edit: I would like something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code> x &lt;- seq(0.51,0.99,by=0.01)
 which(xskew(vect,x) &lt; 0.05)
</code></pre>

<p>So perhaps I would find a value under some threshold. This code obviously produces an error.</p>

<p>We have a primary repository (called 'primary' below).</p>

<p>And a secondary repository (called 'secondary' below) that was created like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone --bare --shared $REPO_A/primary secondary.git
</code></pre>

<p>People working on the secondary repository view the branches which originated from the primary repository as read only but base their own branches off these branches.</p>

<p>We want to sync up the secondary repository with the primary repository once a day.</p>

<p>I.e. we want commits and new branches that were pushed to the primary to become visible to people working off the secondary repository (next time they do a pull).</p>

<p>We do not want this to be symmetric, i.e. activity against the secondary repository will not become visible to those working off the primary repository.</p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to run a cron job that runs on the machine with the bare secondary repository that somehow fetches new data from the primary and automatically includes it into the secondary.</p>

<p>I was hoping there might be a simple way to do this (and I'm hoping someone here will tell me there is).</p>

<p>If I were to write a script to do it, it would do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a fresh clone of the secondary.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone $REPO_B/secondary
$ cd secondary
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Get all its branches.</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -r | sed 's?.*origin/??'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Get all branches in the primary repo.</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-remote --heads $REPO_A/primary | sed 's?.*refs/heads/??'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>For each primary branch for which I don't already have a corresponding secondary branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch $REPO_A/primary $BRANCHNAME:$BRANCHNAME
$ git push origin $BRANCHNAME:refs/heads/$BRANCHNAME
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>For each primary branch for which I already have a corresponding secondary branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b $BRANCHNAME --track origin/$BRANCHNAME
$ git pull $REPO_A/primary $BRANCHNAME
$ git push
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>As I'm new to git I wouldn't be surprised if I've failed to consider certain fundamental issues?</p>

<p>And like I said I'm hoping there's a simpler way of doing this, i.e. someone goes ""oh, don't do all that, just do..."".</p>

<p>Then, in an app specific template directory, I have <code>directory.html</code> which properly has the <code>{% extends 'base.html' %}</code></p>

<p>However, there's two problems:  If I log in and go to the <code>/directory/</code> url my nav-bar (which is in the <code>base.html</code> template) doesn't show the user being logged in (navigating away from the page resume normal logged in user display of the nav-bar).</p>

<p>So it looks like the <code>directory.html</code> template isn't receiving the user object and the <code>{% if user.is_authenticated %}</code> is failing and simply rendering the not logged in version.</p>

<p>The other problem is that <code>directory.html</code> doesn't fill the <code>bodycontent</code> at all.  Or anything.  I've even inserted standard text and extra HTML tags to try to see something but nothing renders except the <code>base.html</code> template</p>

<p>This involves keeping track of the CTM, drawing/positioning PDF instructions, etc., but also calculating the boundaries of every specific glyph in ""glyph space"" (using the information from the GLYF tables in the embedded fonts).</p>

<p>I realize the PDF FontDescriptor includes a rough bounding box for each embedded font, but that's a composite of all glyphs in the font -- i.e., the smallest bounding box that fits all glyphs in the font. For my purposes, I need more precise positioning.</p>

<p>My specific application is extracting the musical semantics from a vector PDF of sheet music. As such, one nice constraint is that I can assume glyphs aren't drawn together in the same Tj/TJ operator. Each glyph is drawn independently.</p>

<p>Also, note that I'm defining bounding box as ""the smallest box that can contain all the drawn parts of the glyph."" There's no need to ignore the ascenders/descenders/etc. that might be considered ""outside"" the bounding box in other applications.</p>

<p>There are <em>many</em> moving parts here, and I've found it's quite hard to debug. So here's what I'd love help with:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://red-bean.com/~adrian/pdf_example.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">This example PDF I've created</a> has 10 glyphs. What is the ""ground truth"" bounding box positioning for these 10 glyphs, in device space? My current code produces the following, but it's incorrect. I know it's incorrect because it says the first glyph (""&amp;"") horizontally intersects the second (""\u02d9""), which you can see isn't true when you view the PDF in a PDF reader.</li>

<p>My initial understanding was, that displaying the Ad would put the activity into pause mode and resume it after the ad has been closed.</p>

<p>This assumption seems to be wrong, as with the below code, the activity gets switched directly, the toast is showing that an Ad should be displayed, but as long as I don't comment the startActivity(intent), I never see the ad.</p>

<p>I am loading the ad in onCreate, then try to display it in another void which is being triggered when a button has been clicked (and, of course, if it has finished loading by that point in time).</p>

<p>Sourcecode:</p>

public void onCreate(Bundle SafedInstanceState)
{
    [...]
    LoadAd();
    [...]
}

public void ShowAd(){
    if (interstitial.isLoaded()) {
    interstitial.show();
    }
}

public void LoadAd(){
    String MY_AD_UNIT_ID=getResources().getString(R.string.AdID);
    // Create the interstitial.
    interstitial = new InterstitialAd(this);
    interstitial.setAdUnitId(MY_AD_UNIT_ID);

    // Create ad request.
    AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder().build();

    // Begin loading your interstitial.

<p>What I discovered by digging into the code is that the module Math gets imported into <code>/output/Control.Monad.Eff.Random/index.js</code> as </p>

<pre><code>var Math = require(""Math"");

function random() {
    return Math.random();
}
;
</code></pre>

<p>If I remove the import, letting Math being native and running the main <code>index.js</code> simply with <code>node index.js</code>, everything works fine.
I was wondering if there is something I can do to fix this in purescript, or if it is something I am doing wrong.</p>

A category can have many sub categories, and each subcategory can have many articles. So there is a bidirectionnal oneToMany relationship between Category and SubCategory, as well as between SubCategory and Article. This design is a constraint, and I cannot change it.</p>

<p>I have to make a form for editing Articles, in which the user has to select the category, and then the subcategory the article belongs to. </p>

<p>However, I cannot find how to have the list of the subcategories to be dynamically updated when the user changes the vaues of the Category dropdown. The subcategory dropdown should ony display the subcategories linked to the current category.</p>

<p>I already made a form type for editing the articles :</p>

<pre><code>class ArticleType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder
            -&gt;add('domain', new SubCategoryPickerType())
            -&gt;add('title')
            -&gt;add('description')
            -&gt;add('content')
        ;
    }

    // ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then I started making the form for getting an entity based on 2 dropdown lists :</p>

<pre><code>class DomainPickerType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder
            -&gt;add('category')

                    'class' =&gt; 'Htbf\CoreBundle\Entity\SubCategory',
                    'property' =&gt; 'name'))
        ;
     // ...
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that like this, the 2 dropdown do not depend on each other : the 2nd one is not updated when the first one is changed, and the second one contains all the possibilities of subcategories, not the one associated to the current category.</p>

<p>Any idea how to do that ? Thanks in advance !</p>

There seems to be a lot of information on it, but I haven't been able to find a simple implementation using java.  What I would like to do is partition an array of bytes with 44.1K elements into samples of size 44 (discarding the remainder) and determine if there is a tone over 18KHz in each sample (I'm trying to find when a tone that was played during the recording was picked up by the mic).  If need be, I could use larger samples but 44 elements per sample would be ideal.  I understand that I would probably need to use FFT, but the math is a little heavy for me.  I had attempted to analyze the array using the goertzel algorithm, but I wasn't able to get conclusive results.  My question then is how would I divide up an array of bytes with 44.1K elements into 1002 samples, determine the frequency of each sample (or detect if the frequency of a sample is over 18KHz), and what would be an example implementation of this.  Please give code or pseudocode.  I've read a lot of the documentation that is out there I just need to see an example.</p>

Between these tasks, I'd like to send real-time status updates to a SignalR hub running in an intranet-facing ASP.NET MVC 4 app hosted in IIS 7.0, so users can watch the progress.</p>

<p>What is the best way to send status update messages to SignalR hub clients from SSIS?</p>

<p>The following SSIS tasks seem to be capable of delivering messages to outside systems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>SSIS Message Queue Task:</em> Using an MSMQ private queue on the server sounds easy at first, except that MSMQ is a bit outdated, unmaintained, and lacking in documentation. There also isn't an obvious way to integrate with an existing SignalR-enabled web app. There is a <a href=""http://camieleggermont.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/self-hosted-signalr-and-msmq/"" rel=""nofollow"">write-up about a self-hosted SignalR hub with connections to MSMQ</a>, but would this approach be possible inside an ASP.NET MVC app?</p></li>
<li><p><em>SSIS Execute SQL Task:</em> I'm already doing this from SSIS (updating a status_id in a jobs table), so the hard part would be detecting these changes and routing them through the SignalR hub. SignalR <a href=""http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/performance-and-scaling/scaleout-with-sql-server"" rel=""nofollow"">already can use SQL Server for scaling out</a>, but this technique assumes all messages are coming in <em>through</em> a SignalR hub to begin with, which is not the case here. Others talk about using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldependency.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SqlDependency</a>, but could that enable an ASP.NET app to watch a DB table and be notified of all updates?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use the SSIS Script task to send an HTTP request (C#):</em> Upon reflection, this seems the most straightforward route, with a few caveats. The web application I'm building is NTLM-authenticated, so I'd need to use System.Net.WebRequest with authentication, which may or may not have issues within SSIS.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE regarding #3: the SSIS package is being run within SQL Server. The Windows account it's running under will fail authorization if I authenticate to the site using <code>System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultNetworkCredentials</code>. So it seems WebRequest can only work in this scenario if it's possible to use alternate NTLM credentials (i.e. <em>not</em> derived from the account under which the package is running). The site does not accept basic HTTP authentication.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: It looks like System.Net.NetworkCredentials can be instantiated with arbitrary domain/user/password and applied to WebRequest. I have yet to test this in production within an SSIS task. The question remains open because maintaining many identical SSIS Script tasks (or developing a reusable SSIS Task) is rather cumbersome. There may be an easier, faster, or more maintainable solution.</p>

<p>UPDATE 3 regarding bounty award: the 400-rep bounty will be awarded to the best answer that proposes a workable strategy and provides a few basic details at minimum.</p>

<p>Let me give a little background on the problem. I'm creating a custom video player with video controls at the bottom. Set up like so:</p>

<pre><code> _________________
| video container |
|  _____________  |
| |    video    | |
| |             | |
| |             | |
| |_____________| |
| |  controls   | |
| |_____________| |
|_________________|
</code></pre>

<h2>The Platform</h2>

<ul>
<li>Adobe AIR 3.2</li>
<li>Flash Player 11.2</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The controls are the typical controls you'd expect: play, pause, volume, etc. The issue I'm having is with dragging a volume slider inside the controls container. The volume control is composed of a track with a child sprite object. When I hook up the event listener for dragging it is completely unresponsive to being dragged. The code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>private function make_slider_track():Sprite {
  var track:Sprite = graphics_util.make_box_sprite(btn_bg_up, vol_slider_width, 1);

  var knob:MovieClip = make_slider_knob();
  knob.y = -(vol_knob_height)/2+1;
  track.addChild(knob);

  var volume_drag:Function = function(e:MouseEvent) {
    e.stopPropagation();

    // add events
    knob.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, volume_stop_drag);
    knob.startDrag();
  };

  var volume_stop_drag:Function = function(e:MouseEvent) {
    // remove events
    knob.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, volume_stop_drag);
    knob.stopDrag();
  };
  knob.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, volume_drag, true);

  return track;
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the code returns the track I immediately add it as a child of the controls container.</p>

<p>The behavior I'm seeing is that when I click the knob to drag it (I removed the bounding rect I had for testing for any movement whatsoever) is that it will fire the mouse down callback and (I assume) the startDrag call but I'll move the mouse and the knob sprite stays in place.</p>

<p>I'm completely at a loss as to what's happening here so any insight would be helpful.</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>It seems the issue is related to tweening the video container. I'm using caurina.transitions.Tweener. What am I doing wrong here? And how has nobody ever had this issue? Here's how I'm issuing the tween:</p>

<pre><code>player.rotationX = -90;
Tweener.addTween(player, { rotationX:0, x:to_x, y:to_y, alpha:1, time:0.5 } );

I myself find it very useful to run the code in question under debugger (if it is possible of course), set breakpoints and step through the code.<br>
Also I've used a few UML tools with reverse engineering features to see the big picture. Visualization works pretty well for me.<br>
There's one tool, that I've used quite a bit: <a href=""http://www.scitools.com/products/understand/"" rel=""nofollow"">Understand</a>. It's not a UML tool, but it has a bunch of visualizations for the code. For instance control flow diagram for a function, which is not part of UML, but sometimes it's very useful.<br>
I've heard that sometimes people write tests for the code they want to learn, but it hasn't been working for me. Sometimes the code I want to understand is not very testable.<br>
There are other tools, like profilers, dependency checkers, loggers etc. Does anybody use it with any success? And how?<br>

If I <strong>do</strong> return DT then I can get back a table that looks the way I want, but I've done so by making a copy, which might as well be passing byVal.</p>

<p>So here's the question. Once DT is passed into my function byRef, how do I make R continue to work on DT byRef? Equivalently, how do I make R treat the DT inside the function as a reference to the same object that DT outside the function references? Is this even possible?</p>

            Console.ReadKey();

<p>obviously xReader.ReadInnerXml() places the reader after call at the End of File and as a result of that xReader.ReadOuterXml() prints nothing.</p>

<p>Now I want xReader.ReadOuterXml() to be called successfully . How can I get back to my previous root node ?
I tried xReader.MoveToElement() but I guess it does not do so .</p>

I'm thinking there is some slight issue with the way I have this setup. Any pointers or help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>What should happen is when you drag a color from the Draggable container into the Droppable container it should update the text which is linked to the scope object items. I am successfully pushing an item onto the scope object but ng-repeat isn't picking it up. I am not sure if I need a watch or what to do to get it to pay attention to the newly added items.</p>

<p>Is there any direct way i.e. without constructing parsing table, to find out whether a grammar is SLR(1), LR(0), LR(1) or LALR(1).<br>
For example, Here is the grammar  </p>

<pre><code>S-&gt;Sd|cAe
A-&gt;Sa|S|a  
</code></pre>

<p>Now How can we found which class this grammar belongs to ? Is it SLR(1), LR(0), LR(1) or LALR(1) ?</p>

I have created a simple test that just opens a browser, gets a url, and then closes the browser. This seems to work for Chrome (on Mac) and IE (on Windows) but for some reason when using Firefox 18.0.2 on Mac, I see the browser window open but the url I'm supposed to load never shows up in the url bar and things hang and I get an error:</p>

<pre><code>WebDriverException: Unable to connect to host 127.0.0.1 on port 7055 after 45000 ms. Firefox console output:
</code></pre>

<p>It is hanging somewhere in the constructor to create the RemoteDriver. I added a trace statement right after the constructor and the code never gets there.</p>

<p>The weird thing is the test executes just fine if I start up a local Selenium Grid node on the same machine that fails and direct my tests there instead of the Jenkins Selenium Grid hub. So it seems to potentially be an issue with how I set up the Jenkins node but I can't figure out how to troubleshoot this. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>My code is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>WebDriver driver = null;

public Browser(String gridUrl) {
     driver = makeFirefox(gridUrl);
     driver.get(url);
}


private WebDriver makeFirefox(String gridUrl) {

      FirefoxProfile prof = new FirefoxProfile();
      prof.setEnableNativeEvents(true);

      DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
      capabilities.setCapability(FirefoxDriver.PROFILE, prof);

  <p>Favicons are a third possibility--which most browsers request before

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>What I interpreted with this is that the user makes a call if he needs the Favicon. If he does not make that call it means he already has the favicon so he visited. So there is no need to store any file (cookie for example) in the user computer or keep its IP in the server. Is this correct?</p>

"5118158","1","5119385","","2011-02-25 14:06:25","","8","5015","<p>In my project I have implemented basic class CVector.
This class contains float* pointer to raw floating point array.
This array is allocated dynamicly using standard malloc() function.</p>

<p>Now I have to speed up some computation using such vectors. Unfortunately as the memory isn't alocated using _mm_malloc() it is not aligned.</p>

<p>As I understand I have two options:</p>

<p>1) Rewrite code which allocates memory to use _mm_malloc() and for example use the code like this:</p>

<pre><code>void sub(float* v1, float* v2, float* v3, int size) 
{  
    __m128* p_v1 = (__m128*)v1;  
    __m128* p_v2 = (__m128*)v2;  
    __m128 res;

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; size/4; ++i)  
    {  
        res = _mm_sub_ps(*p_v1,*p_v2);  
        _mm_store_ps(v3,res);  
        ++p_v1;  
        ++p_v2;  
        v3 += 4;  
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) The second option is to use _mm_loadu_ps() instruction to load __m128 from unaligned memory and then use it for computation.</p>

<pre><code>void sub(float* v1, float* v2, float* v3, int size)
{  
    __m128 p_v1;  
    __m128 p_v2;  
    __m128 res;

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; size/4; ++i)  
    {  
        p_v1 = _mm_loadu_ps(v1);   
        p_v2 = _mm_loadu_ps(v2);  
        res = _mm_sub_ps(p_v1,p_v2);    
        _mm_store_ps(v3,res);  
        v1 += 4;  
        v2 += 4;  
        v3 += 4;  
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is which option will be better or faster?</p>

accelerate f [] = []
accelerate f [x] = [(accelerateForce f x x)]

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>I have a list of languages that that the user can select from a select-box:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;select class=""form-control select2""
        data-bind=""event: { change: app.languageChanged }, options:languages,
        optionsText:'label',
        optionsValue:'code',
        value:app.selectedLanguage""&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The property app.selectedLanguage is a ko.observable. I know that this works because the correct item gets pre-selected.</p>

<pre><code>    this.selectedLanguage = ko.observable(options.defaultLanguage);
</code></pre>

<p>I also have an event-handler which listens for changes on that select box, so that I can send a message to other parts of the application that need to be informed:</p>

<pre><code>    languageChanged : function(data, event) {
        console.log(data);
        console.log(event);
        console.log(this.selectedLanguage());

        app.trigger('language:change', this.selectedLanguage());
    },
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>the first parameter 'data' does not contain the selected item, but instead contains all items (actually, it seems to be the complete current view-model).</li>
<li>If 1. does not work, then it would be an alternative to at least get hold of the new value from the observable 'selectedLanguage'. Unfortunately that always seems to have the old value. So whenever I change the selectbox option, I always get the previously selected value.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>So the question is: <em>what could I be doing wrong?</em> I am sure that this normally works correctly and I must be missing something somewhere.</p>

<p>I thought I had finally understood how knockout works, but now I have come across the next issue. I would be very grateful if someone could help me on this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT [SOLVED]</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to xdumaine, here is the (nice and simple) solution:</p>

<p>In my html template, I removed the change-event:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;select class=""form-control select2""
        data-bind=""options:languages,
        optionsText:'label',
        optionsValue:'code',
        value:app.selectedLanguage""&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my App view-model (that I require everywhere), I now subscribe to the ko.observable instead of listening to the event-handler:</p>

<pre><code>    define([ 'durandal/app', 'underscore', 'knockout', 'myapp/myapp' ], function(app, _, ko, myapp) {

        ""use strict"";

        function App(options) {

            if (!(this instanceof App)) {
                throw new TypeError(""App constructor cannot be called as a function."");
            }

            this.options = options || {};

            // Set the initial language.
            this.selectedLanguage = ko.observable(options.defaultLanguage);
                    // *** Subscribes to the observable ***
            this.selectedLanguage.subscribe(function(newValue) {
                console.log(newValue);
                app.trigger('language:change', newValue);
            });

            _.bindAll(this, 'getSelectedLanguage');
        }

        App.prototype = {
            constructor : App,
            getSelectedLanguage : function() {
                return this.selectedLanguage();
            }
        }

        return App;
    });
</code></pre>

<p>This code has therefore been removed and is no longer needed:</p>

<pre><code>languageChanged : function(data, event) {
    console.log(data);
    console.log(event);
    console.log(this.selectedLanguage());

    app.trigger('language:change', this.selectedLanguage());
},
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><code>users</code> — Contains the id of 50000 users ( all distinct )</li>
<li><code>pusers</code> — Contains the id of users who own some posts (contains repeated id's also, that is, one user can own many posts) [ 50000 values]</li>
<li><code>score</code> — Contains the score corresponding to each value in pusers.[ 50000 values]</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I want to populate another array <code>PScore</code> based on the following calculation. For each value of <code>users</code> in <code>pusers</code>, I need to fetch the corresponding <code>score</code> and add it to the <code>PScore</code> array in the index corresponding to the <code>user</code>.</p>

<p>Example,</p>

<pre><code>if users[5] = 23224
and pusers[6] = pusers[97] = 23224 
then PScore[5] += score[6]+score[97]
</code></pre>

<p>Items of note:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>score</code> is related to <code>pusers</code> (e.g., <code>pusers[5]</code> has <code>score[5]</code>)</li>
<li><code>PScore</code> is expected to be related to <code>users</code> (e.g., cumulative score of <code>users[5]</code> is <code>Pscore[5]</code>)</li>
<li>The ultimate aim is to assign a cumulative score of posts to the user who owns it.</li>
<li>The users who don't own any posts are assigned a <code>score</code> of 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone help me in doing this? I tried a lot but once I run my different trials, the output screen remains blank until I <code>Ctrl+Z</code> and get out.</p>

<p>All that I want is the total score associated with each user. Once again, the pusers list contains repetition while users list contains unique values. I need the total score associated with each user stored in such a way that, if I say <code>PScore[6]</code>, it should refer to the total score associated with <code>User[6]</code>.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? </p>

<p>The error code I get returned from the code below is 2147942699 (0x8007012b)</p>

The value for over 50% of the keys will change over the course of the week, and about 5% of the rows will be permanently removed.  Using traditional SQL solutions, this has proven to cause a large amount of fragmentation, causing table bloat (4x the original table size), and some performance issues.  It takes considerable down time to resolve this fragmentation in SQL.  We have used both reindexing and reorganizing techniques, but both have failed to keep up with the fragmentation.  In addition I need to replicate this data to 2 other systems, which has also proven to be quite problematic.</p>

There doesn't seem to be a way to tell if the device is registered or not because the <code>getRemoteNotificationStatus</code> method is not available in the Android version of the plugin. How can I get this information?</p>

<p>I thought I'd save it as a preference in the app so I wouldn't have to query anything external, but more recent versions of Android allow you to disable notifications outside of the app. Will this deregister/conflict with my separate in-app preference?</p>

<p>My code (that I'm testing with) so far:</p>

<pre><code>(function() {
    var pushPrefApply = function() {
        app.pushPref(function(pushPref) {
            console.log('pushPref', pushPref);

                return;

<p><code>$document</code> is not a typo, it's defined already. <code>app.pushPref</code> is the preference fetching function. <code>window.plugins.pushNotification.onDeviceReady</code> has been done elsewhere on <code>deviceready</code>. <code>appready</code> is a synthesized event that I fire after both <code>deviceready</code> and another event triggered by a local data storage library.</p>

<p>In Tomcat, I simply set up a certificate for the server, then I save the client certificate from the web browser and add it to the JVM that executes Tomcat. I have to have the certiface information in both the key store and trust store, since the tomcat server acts as both client and server (since it is inter-app communication).</p>

<p>I need to setup something similar in WAS. So far, I have gone into the management console and imported the default certificate from the default key store into the default trust store.</p>

I have reproduced the problem, or at least a similar problem, outside of WAS using http-client, which might be where the actual problem lies. So, the question may be how to properly get http-client to use chained certificates from WAS.</p>

As part of a custom build target in our MSBuild setup we insert the .PDB files into Symbol Storeafter the build is successful. This works fine. However when we delete the old builds we also have to delete the .PDB files from Symbol Store, which requires a transaction ID that's generated when the symbols are inserted. This is output in the build debug file so not a problem to find.
The problem is that we want to automate the deletion of old builds, and we need to also delete the .PDB files at the same time. Currently this can only be manually, and before deleting the build by hand as well, otherwise we lose the transaction ID. Is there a way of hooking into the automated delete process in MSBuild and putting some custom targets in?</p>

<p>As you can see in result, the vertical scroll-bar sticks out towards top and horizontal bar sticks out towards left. This makes it look ugly.</p>

<p><strong>I would like them to be exactly aligned with the table.</strong></p>

<p>If I remove tabs, they won't stick out. So I guess it has something to do with how jscrollpane is behaving under jquery-ui tab.</p>

<p>I thought I will request jscrollpane and jqueri-ui developers to look into it after checking with the fantastic SO community.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

*******************

12  DESC
13  (null)
14  DESC
15  (null)

<p><strong>What I tried so far</strong></p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    B.KEY,
    B.ATTRIBUTE,
    A.PRODUCT
    A.VALUE1
FROM TEST2 B LEFT JOIN TEST1 A ON TEST2.KEY = TEST1.KEY;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What I get with above SQL is</strong></p>

<pre><code>KEY ATTRIBUTE   PRODUCT VALUE1
12  DESC        1       2
13  (null)      1       3
14  DESC        1       4
15  (null)      1       5

14  DESC        1       4
15  DESC        1       5
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Logic</strong>:
Since all products with id 1 are same, I need to retain the attributes if it is NULL. So doing a distinct of PRODUCT and ATTRIBUTE will always have 1 row per product id. Test1 has more than 100 products and Test2 has corresponding descriptions. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a normalized design since it is data warehousing. So no complaints on design please </p>

<p>I would like to have a CASE statement in the attribute field.</p>

<pre><code>CASE
    WHEN ATTRIBUTE IS NULL THEN {fix goes here}
    ELSE ATTRIBUTE 
END AS ATTRIBUTE

<p>In English, a Post is either a list of Headers along with Content of some type, or it's a list of Headers with Content of another Post. But Content can also be a list of Posts.</p>

<p>So I've defined <code>Header</code> thus:</p>

<pre><code>data Header = Header { hName  :: String
                     , hValue :: String
                     , hAddl  :: [(String,String)] } deriving (Eq, Show)
</code></pre>

<p>I guess <code>Content</code> should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>data Content a = Content a | [Post] deriving (Eq, Show)
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, that fails: <code>parse error in constructor in data/newtype declaration: [Post]</code></p>

<p>I've defined <code>Post</code> as:</p>

<pre><code>data Post = Post { pHeaders :: [Header]
                 , pContent :: [Content] } deriving (Eq, Show)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using Haskell to get a different perspective on my current task, the latest question thereon being <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26891564/f-fparsec-and-calling-a-stream-parser-recursively-second-take"">here</a>. Just using <code>String</code> for <code>Content</code>, I can parse simple POSTs using Parsec. But the goal is to parse complex Posts.</p>

<p>The link above, and the links found at that question, give the context for my current task. I'm a Haskell hobbyist, so please feel free to offer alternatives to the code I've posted here--I'm not married to it, and I'd love to learn. Ultimately, I'll use F#, unless I am unable to deliver, in which case I'll be forced to use C# and an imperative style. I welcome any wisdom or direction that supports a functional solution!</p>

<p>The way I see, as the text grows in the 'post_text' DIV, the 'post_container' DIV should have it's height adjusted, since the height is set as auto. I tried setting an 'overflow: auto' to 'post_container' according to another question I saw here but all it did was add a scrollbar to it. I need to solve this without any scripts.</p>

In AWS EBS there is the possibility to use system properties to read specific things like jdbc connection parameters, and that would be great to easily use the same package for different environments (dev, staging, production) without going to change the context.xml file.
Since I'm using JNDI DataSource, I'm accessing the original datasource, and then changing the url and password, in this way:</p>

<pre><code>org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSource ds = (DataSource) new InitialContext().lookup(""java:/comp/env/jdbc/myapp"");
    String jdbcURL = System.getProperty(""JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING""); 
    String username = System.getProperty(""PARAM1""); 
    String password = System.getProperty(""PARAM2""); 
    if (!StringUtils.isEmpty(jdbcURL)){
        ds.setUrl(jdbcURL);
        ds.setUsername(username);
        ds.setPassword(password);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Using Tomcat DataSource I have access to setters and getters of the connection parameters.
Tested it locally (adding the System parameters in the VM arguments of Tomcat, it works perfectly.
But when I upload to my test environment in AWS EBS, these parameters are empty at the beginning (when the application is loaded), but they are available later on: tested them in a jsp page in this way</p>

<pre><code>The JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING environment property is:
&lt;%= System.getProperty(""JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING"") %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The PARAM1 environment property is:
&lt;%= System.getProperty(""PARAM1"") %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;]
The PARAM2 environment property is:
&lt;%= System.getProperty(""PARAM2"") %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and they correct values are printed.
The only guess I can have is that the System properties are loaded later on, while I set up the connection to the database in the Listener called on application startup (set up in web.xml).</p>

<p>Any idea why it fails so?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Rohi</p>

<p>EDIT: I've found the problem, but not the solution:
The problem is that when the DataSource is loaded with in the lookup() method, it also tried to establish a connection! It will not succeed cause in context.xml the url is localhost, and I don't have a DB there when I deploy.</p>

<p>Anybody knows how NOT to connect immediately, but wait till the first getConnection() call?

<p>I found the following blog post which describes my problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is definitely caused by the auto-fit layout
  (""kLayoutFitColumnToScreen"" in the Android WebKit source code). Just
  try the test with auto-fit disabled and everything is rendered
  correctly (at least on my Android device).</p>
  
  <p>The auto-fit mode on Android seems to shrink certain elements' width
  without affecting their positioning, or the positioning of other
  elements. So if you have a containing block with width: 1000px and
  text that spans 100% of that width, the container may remain 1000px
  wide but the text inside it will wrap at the screen width.</p>

<p>[SOLVED] The docs say that <code>tabIndex=-1</code> means no tabindex. But they don't say 0 is not a valid number (and that you must start with tabIndex=1). Why anything worked before inserting the component is a mistery. I found you can't put 0 looking at the Accessibility Panel: when you try to insert 0, Flash IDE alerts you can't.

    completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData);

<p><strong>EDIT 6: FOUND EXACTLY WHERE IT CAUSE THE CRASH!</strong>
Many thanks to Nicholas Langley, the problems printed here:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions

    // Stripe Payment
    [Stripe setDefaultPublishableKey:StripePublishableKey];
    // iZettle Payment
    [[iZettleSDK shared] startWithAPIKey:@""THE_API_KEY""];
</code></pre>

<p>I changed my app name, cause it to change the bundle. After debugging, it prints out the message after that line of code (startWithAPIKey), and crash when I try to do this:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary *dic = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSString *x = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@""X""];
[dic setObject:x forKey@""X""]; &lt;&lt;&lt; HERE ERROR SETTING NIL. STRANGE because it doesn't print any message. Also, My app should store X already.
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that after changing the app's name, it also change the bundle, which cause data loss. Now the real question is: how to migrate old data with new data after changing the app's name/bundle. The simulator doesn't produce this error, and I can't debug into device's directory to check anything.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 7: SUDDENLY SOLVED!</strong></p>

<p>After update the app:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary *dic = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSString *x = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@""X""];
if (x) {
    [dic setObject:x forKey@""X""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And reinstall, it crash a few times, then work normally again. I even change the app's name a few more times, no problem occurred again. I really worry if update the app to the store will cause crash if users download and upgrade the app. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 8: Test with upgrading from store.</strong>
I just re-download from store old version. Then upgrade to new version (doesn't change app's name). Then change the app's name. No problem occur. The problem just disappeared, like a dream....... I don't even know what to do. This meme absolutely right in my case! Well, thanks to everyone who has spent time for reading this long article.</p>

<pre><code> data[14] = 0x12345678;
 data[15] = 0x01ABCDEF;
</code></pre>

<p>How do I accomplish a leftwise shift so that if shifted left by two,</p>

<pre><code> data[13] = 0x00000012;
 data[14] = 0x34567801;
 data[15] = 0xABCDEF00;
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone got any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>public Class Item

    public String Name{get; set;}
    public int Size {get; set}    
}

public Class Widget:Item
{

}

public Class Doohicky:Item
{
    public String Smell{get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's are a few options I'm considering for how to save this structure to a database.</p>

<p><strong>Options 1: Single Table for all item types</strong></p>

<pre><code>Items Table: ItemID, Name, Color, Smell
</code></pre>

<p>This sucks as it would require NULL values.</p>

<p><strong>Options 2: Separate tables for each item type</strong></p>

<pre><code>Widgets Table: WidgetID, Name, Color
Doohicky Table: DoohickyID, Name, Smell
</code></pre>

<p>This is better, but would be more difficult to list all Items</p>

<p><strong>Options 3: Linked tables</strong></p>

<pre><code>Items Table: ItemID (PK), Name, Size
Widgets Table: WidgetID (PK), ItemID (FK), Color
Doohicky Table: DoohickyID (PK), ItemID (FK), Smell
</code></pre>

<p>I think this option is the best, as it prevents me from having Null values in any fields, plus it will make it easier to list all the Items, and/or create a list of a specific type of Item (Widgets or Doohickies). </p>

<p>However, I'm not sure how to create the relationship between the Items table and the Widgets and Doohickies tables. I don't want to end up with row in either table referencing the same ItemID in the Items table. </p>

<p>For example when I add an entry to the Widgets table, how can I ensure that it is linked to a new entry in the Items table with a unique ItemID? Should I instead only track the ItemID rather then separate type specific IDs like WidgetID and DoohickyID, and use it to create a one to one relationships between the Items table and the type specific tables?</p>

<p><strong>Options 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>Items Table: ItemID (PK), Name, Size
Widgets Table: ItemID (PK), Color
Doohicky Table: ItemID (PK), Smell

<p>So I'm creating a Wordpress-based Facebook page and I've got the proper code to automatically resize the built in iFrame that Facebook uses, but if you go to the artists page, scroll to the bottom and select one of the last artists, the iFrame will not only not resize, but it also won't scroll to the top.  I've tried just about everything, does anyone have any ideas?  Keep in mind, since I'm using Wordpress, I have the header and footer loading every individual Facebook PHP page in between.  So I'm not entirely sure if it's loading the header and footer every single page change (then again, it might be, I'm not sure), which could explain why it would resize bigger, but not smaller.</p>

If I was to take them out, the space goes but I would really like to keep them in so I need someone to help me troubleshoot it so that I can keep the boxes and have no space below the footer. </p>

<p>I think my problem lies with the fact they are positioned with relative (all divs are positioned relative - bad idea I now realize that). </p>

<p>I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>aligning the 2 divs with absolute positioning - that does the trick of getting rid of the space at the bottom/right however if I was to scale down the browser, the boxes go out of position..</p></li>
<li><p>removing all positioning and floating them to the left/right - removes the space at the bottom/right but doesn't go into the position I would like them to ( I don't think you can position floats with top/bottom/left/right or margin? ) </p></li>

<pre><code>Table name: entities

id           :integer          not null, primary key
meta_data    :hstore

<p>I have 19 fields in a loader file that I use to create a hash.  then I assign the hash to the meta_data field and save it.  This algorithm is the bottleneck in my import and it's very slow.  In the process of testing I commented out the save and found it still very slow.  If i comment out the meta_data field assignment as well it is much faster so it seems that my bottleneck is in the hstore field assignment even though it's not actually calling a save or doing any sql on it.  </p>

<p>any ideas on how to speed this up?</p>

@demographic_fields.each do |k, v|
  meta[v] = hash[k]

my_object.meta_data = meta
#current_entity.save

</code></pre>

<p>and a list of prime numbers, B[k], for instance</p>

<pre><code> B[2]={3, 5}
</code></pre>

<p>For each element, b_i in B[k], we find the elements in A[n] that are divisible by it and combine them into an equivalence class, and if an element in A[n] is not divisible by any element in B[k], then it's an equivalence class consisting of a single element. For instance, in the above example, the equivalence classes would be</p>

<pre><code> {12, 15, 18}
 {10, 15, 20}
 {11}
 {13}
 {14}
 {16}
 {17}
 {19}
</code></pre>

<p>(15 was repeated as it's divisible by both 3 and 5), where first equivalence class consists of numbers in A[n] divisible by 3, and second are the ones divisible by 5, and the rest are elements that are co-prime to 3 and 5. Basically, given A[n] and B[k], I want to calculate how many equivalence sets can be created, and in the above example, it would be 8.</p>

<p>and what I came up with is the following:</p>

<pre><code>   for(j=0; j&lt;n; j++){
       check[j]=true;
   }

   for(i=0; i&lt;k; i++){
       helper=0;
       for(j=0; j&lt;n; j++){
           if(check[j]==true){
               if(A[j]%B[i]==0){
                   check[j]==false;
                   helper++;
               }
           }
       }

       if(helper&gt;0){
           count++;
       }
   }

   for(j=0; j&lt;n; j++){
       if(check[j]==true){
           count++;
       }
   }
</code></pre>

<p>check is the array of boolean that returns false if it already belongs to some equivalence class and true if it does not belong to an equivalence class yet. 
this calculates the number of equivalence sets divisible by elements in B[k], but now, I'm not sure what to do with singleton sets as check array members are all re-set to true after the loop. </p>

<p>(I tried </p>

<pre><code>   for(j=0; j&lt;n; j++){
      if(check[j]==true){
          count++;
      }
   }
</code></pre>

<p>after the above loop, but it only adds n to the count)</p>

<p>Can someone help me on this? Is there a more efficient way of doing it? Also, what should I do with the singleton sets?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>PS. Since 15 is repeated in 2 sets, it's not technically an equivalence class. Sorry about it.</p>

The report prints a number of large HTML tables and the customer wants them to be formated ins such a way that when they are printed out the user will get 2 of the tables per page. </p>

<p>So it wasn't hard to make a page break by using a </p>

<p>However, while I got the desired effect while using the development ColdFusion environment on my laptop, I get a diffent effect when printing reports generated on the test web server. There the reports print out with a much larger font so that the second table spills over onto a second page. </p>

The only functionality i am trying to get is the ability to create chat rooms and then the ability to chat in each room.  By the way, i'm doing this in Rails if it matters (my user login and everything is handled through Rails).</p>

<p>So far i have this as my sample code, this is what the view looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=""RoomsCtrl""&gt;

  &lt;div ng-repeat=""rm in rooms""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li class=""message phm pvm pull-left"" ng-repeat=""msg in messages""&gt;
          &lt;span class=""message-author""&gt;{{msg.from}}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=""message-body""&gt;{{msg.body}}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=""message-timestamp""&gt;{{msg.timestamp | date:'MMM d, yyyy h:mm a'}}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
      &lt;span class=""hidden""&gt;&lt;%= current_user.full_name %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;textarea ng-model=""msgBody"" ng-keydown=""addMessage($event)"" placeholder=""What's on your mind...""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;form&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" ng-model=""roomName"" ng-keydown=""addRoom($event)"" placeholder=""Enter a room name...""&gt;&lt;
  &lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my AngularFire script:</p>

<pre><code>var app = angular.module(""ChatApp"", [""firebase""]);

function RoomsCtrl($scope, $firebase) {
    var organizationId;

    if (gon) {
        organizationId = gon.organization_id;
    }

    var orgRef = new Firebase(""https://glowing-fire-7051.firebaseio.com/""+organizationId);

    $scope.rooms = $firebase(orgRef);

    $scope.addRoom = function(e) {
        if (e.keyCode != 13) return;
        $scope.rooms.$add({name: $scope.roomName, timestamp: new Date().getTime()})
        $scope.roomName = """";
        e.preventDefault();
    }

    $scope.messages = $firebase(orgRef);

    $scope.addMessage = function(e) {
        if (e.keyCode != 13) return;
        $scope.messages.$add({name: $scope.msgName, body: $scope.msgBody, timestamp: new Date().getTime()})
        $scope.msgBody = """";
        e.preventDefault();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each user <code>belongs_to</code> and <code>Organization</code> as you can see by the <code>gon</code> part that is just getting the id of the organization that the <code>current_user</code> belongs to.  The code i have for the <code>addRoom</code> does actually create a room under the organization.  The Forge data looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;my forge id&gt;
    1
         JHiiMka5OloVaqf-sA7
             name: ""Test Room""
             timestamp: 1394500795299
         JHjA0rwIDJNVDU4HVaF
             name: ""Another Room""
             timestamp: 1394508307247
</code></pre>

<p>I am also seeing the data being reflected on the site as well.  When i create a new room, the room displays on the site.  My problem (i think) lies only with the <code>messages</code>.  I have been researching for hours with little to no success on a the subject of nested references.  I kind of understand it but i haven't been able to figure out how i can create a room (dynamically through the site) and then have access to create messages under that room's node in Firebase.</p>

<p>My view code above shows you how i was thinking it would display on the page.  My question is, how do i tie the two together through Firebase / AngularFire?  Thanks in advance for any help!  And let me know if you have any questions that might shed more light on anything.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I sent this question to Firebase support through their website and received a response helping me with almost all of it.  I sent a follow up email to get clarification on a section i'm not understanding in their response and waiting to here back.  Their advice was to replace:</p>

<pre><code>var orgRef = new Firebase(""https://glowing-fire-7051.firebaseio.com/""+organizationId);
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>var orgRef = new Firebase(""https://glowing-fire-7051.firebaseio.com/"").child(organizationId);
</code></pre>

<p>That would create a new Firebase reference for a child of an existing location.  Then they said to use this for my <code>$scope.messages</code> definition:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.messages = $firebase(orgRef.child(roomID).child(""messages""));
</code></pre>

<p>This would assume that in /1/room/ there is a child named “messages” which holds your messages.</p>

<p>The part i am having trouble with is the <code>.child(roomID)</code> in the messages definition because it is telling me it is undefined (which it is).  What should that be defined as...i'm assuming it should be the ID of the newly created room?</p>

<p>Additionally, I verify the signature before even making the request:</p>

<pre><code>def verify_linkedin_cookie cookie
  Rails.logger.debug cookie.as_json

    case cookie[""signature_method""]

    end 

    cookie[""signature_order""].inject(hmac) do |h, field|
      h &lt;&lt; cookie[field]

    return cookie['signature'].strip.eql?(
      Base64.strict_encode64(hmac.digest)
    )   
  end 
end 
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried the <code>linkedin-oauth2</code> gem, but that does not work, either:</p>

<pre><code>oauth = LinkedIn::OAuth2.new
res = oauth.get_access_token(cookiedata['access_token'],{
  oauth_signature_method: cookiedata['signature_method'],
  oauth_signature: cookiedata['signature'],
  oauth_consumer_key: LinkedIn.config.client_id,
})
</code></pre>

<p>The error message is this:</p>

<pre><code> Failed to get linkedin profile, error: invalid_request: missing required parameters, includes an invalid parameter value, parameter more than once. : Unable to retrieve access token : authorization code not found
{""error_description"":""missing required parameters, includes an invalid parameter value, parameter more than once. : Unable to retrieve access token : authorization code not found"",""error"":""invalid_request""} (pid:5811)
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried various combinations of not using any optional params for the call to <code>get_access_token</code>, using only a few of the options added, and cramming in all of the params to the api endpoint used for the plain http requests.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

when pressing an item, it should swap layouts - I made it by making 2nd layout visible and text from layout1 transparent (yay or nay?), it should work on any number of list items, while now I can press only the first one and the layouts spaw.

<p>This is puzzling for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This only happens on about 1 to 2 percent of installs.</p></li>
<li><p>There is nothing unusual as far as I can tell about the .NET installations or OS on these systems.</p></li>
<li><p>This is happening with a default framework reference (System.Windows.Controls.MenuItem)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Can anyone think of possible causes for this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After following the tip from ""500"", I was able to run the Fusion log viewer on the customer machine. On the development machine and all other test machines, there are successful binding attempts on ""PresentationFramework"" and ""PresentationFramework.Aero"", which are expected.  On the client machine, there is an additional binding attempt that fails (Irrelevant lines removed):</p>

<p>A Google search for ""PresentationFramework.Dawn"" returns no results and I cannot locate any reference to this file. Any explanation or additional tests that can be done?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>  It turns out that the customer had installed an unofficial Windows 7 Aero theme called ""Dusk"".  For some reason, PresentationFramework decided to make a call to PresentationFramework.Dusk instead of PresentationFramework.Aero (a reference that I explicitly included in the project).  I'm assuming that the error is the result of a bad installation of the 3rd party theme since Dusk cannot be found in the GAC, but can you shed any light on how I might stop the reference from being attempted and force all GUI elements to use PresentationFramework.Aero?</p>

The project is quite involved but the basics is that there are a number of files that need to be parsed (each with different parsers depending on what the file contains) and all I am doing is adding a new parser to the preexisting ones.</p>

<p>The only issue is that I have already spent many hours writing my parser as a standalone program and as such have designed it in a way that is not consistent with the original author's methods (for example, each of his parsers is a subclass of Parser() and inherit a few things).</p>

<p>The main difference between my parser and his are that each of his parsers are simply one class (xParser, yParser, etc.) that handle all of the parsing, while my parser as it stands uses one of two classes depending on the format of the input.</p>

<p>My question is, would it be okay for me to just wrap these two classes under one outer class and have them exist as classes within a class? Otherwise I would have to either change my code drastically or change the entire project. I know that this is certainly not an ideal way to go about things and I may be able to change it in the future but is this an acceptable solution for the short term?</p>

I know the only way to do that is to use apk expansion files. However, when i looked online, i found the documentation to be very sparse and confusing. All my videos are in wmv. I know i can't play them, so i was thinking of opening an intent to open the files, and then play them from the expansion files. So in a nutshell:</p>

<p>1) How do i go about making a expasion apk
2) Is it possible to play video using an intent to open the user's preferred video player, from my app?
3) If not how would i do it?</p>

<p>I have already tried looking online but could not find anything!</p>

<p>I know %p is the formatter for pointer, but why are there no values following the formatter? What values are actually printed here ?

"6582365","1","","","2011-07-05 12:05:13","","1","1191","<p>I'm absolutely new to WPF and trying to make a simple application with DataGrid. This application receives Employees DataSet from WebService and has to allow viewing and editing data. DataSet contains three tables: Employees (id, Name, GenderId, PositionId), Genders (id, Name) and Positions (Id, Name). Employees table connected with Genders via GenderId and with Positions via PositionId.
I've dragged the Employees DataSet to the window and got the DataGrid which allows to edit items. But now it contains IDs of Position and Gender, and I need ComboBoxes which will allow to select Gender or Position from available values and save them back to the DataSet.
I load the DataSet in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>EmployeesProxy.EmployeesServiceClient proxy = new EmployeesProxy.EmployeesServiceClient();
        proxy.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = ""user1"";
        proxy.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = ""pass1"";
        empDataSet = proxy.GetEmployeesData();
        employeesDataGrid.ItemsSource = empDataSet.Employees.DefaultView;
        GenderDT = empDataSet.Gender;

        proxy.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>I have empDataSet and GenderDT as properties in my window.
However, I could not create a column in XAML with comboboxes which will allow to edit data. Is there a way to do this?</p>

<p>EDIT: I found this solution which partially works (I can select Gender in edit mode, but cannot view Gender name in normal mode, I see only Id):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataGridTemplateColumn Header=""Gender""&gt;
                &lt;DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate&gt;
                    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
                        &lt;ComboBox ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=GenderDT, 
                                                RelativeSource={RelativeSource FindAncestor, 
                                                AncestorType={x:Type Window}}}""  
                                  DisplayMemberPath=""Name"" 
                                  SelectedValuePath=""Gender"" SelectionChanged=""ComboBox_SelectionChanged"" Loaded=""ComboBox_Loaded""/&gt;
                    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
                &lt;/DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate&gt;                    
                &lt;DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
                    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
                        &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Path=GenderId}"" /&gt;
                    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
                &lt;/DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;                    
            &lt;/DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After changing ComboBox I change the Gender Column:</p>

<pre><code>private void ComboBox_SelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        ((DataRowView)employeesDataGrid.SelectedItem).Row[""GenderId""] = ((DataRowView)((ComboBox)sender).SelectedItem).Row[""Id""];
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But, as for me, this is not good practice. And i still don't get the desired result. I thought there might be a simple way to do such task.</p>

<p>After reading dfsq's solution and other related posts, I feel there is no perfect answer. It really <strong>depends on the specific need</strong>. dfsq's solution is clever and should work but get things over complicated. </p>

<p>What I have regarding the specific need is having a border between two spans and the space between the border and span should be the same. For my particular need, I found the two acceptable solutions too:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use CSS to float span</p></li>
<li><p>Add an extra space as follows: <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=""some link""&gt;A link&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;</code></p></li>

Since records are only ever <strong>appended</strong> to a file (never overwritten), is a crash while writing guaranteed to yield a file size that is shorter than it should be? Is this guaranteed even if the file was opened in read-write mode instead of append mode, so long as writes are always at the end of the file? This would greatly simplify crash recovery, since comparing the last record's expected size and position with the actual file size would be enough to detect a partial write.</p>

<p>I understand that random-access writes can be reordered by the filesystem, but I'm having trouble finding information on whether this can happen when appending.  I imagine an out-of-order append would require the filesystem to create a ""hole"" at the tail of the (sparse) file, write blocks beyond the hole, and then fill in the blocks in between, but I'm hoping that such an approach would be so inefficient that nobody would ever implement their filesystem that way.</p>

<p>I suppose another problem might be a filesystem updating the directory entry's file size field before appending the new blocks to to the file, and the OS crashing in between. Does this ever happen in practice? (ext4, perhaps?) Is there a quick way to detect it? (And what happens when trying to read the unwritten blocks that should exist according to the file's size?)</p>

<p>Is there anything else, such as write reordering performed by a disk/flash drive, that would get in the way of using file size as a way to detect a partial append? I don't expect to be able to compensate for this sort of drive trickery in my application, but it would be good to know about.</p>

<p>My goal is to generate a <strong>MAXIMUM</strong> of 3 unique vowels (AEIOU) on a line of 5 squares. I have made 25 squares using a 2D array (<code>board[][]</code>), but I want to do the first line first. Picture it like this: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/byBjc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, my problem is, whenever I try to generate random letters in my squares, the first letter doesn't show. For example I have <code>E</code> and <code>O</code>, <code>O</code> would only show in my squares, and not <code>E</code>. It's printing in my console, but not in my GUI.</p>

<p>Also, sometimes DUPLICATES of letters are showing. I don't know how to fix this :|</p>

<p>Here are the codes I've done so far: </p>

<pre><code>String board[][] = new String[5][5];
String alphabet = ""AEIOU"";
int numArray[] = new int[5]; //where I can store random indices of alphabet
int finalIndex = 0;

int random = (int) (Math.random()*3) + 1; //random number of vowels to be generated

//this loop covers everything
for(int ctr = 0; ctr &lt; random; ctr++) {
  while(ctr != finalIndex) { //checks if there are any duplicates
    int rand = (int) (Math.random()*4); //random position for the letter
    numArray[ctr] = rand;
    while(numArray[ctr] != numArray[finalIndex]) {
      finalIndex++;
    }
  }

//finds the position of the letter in alphabet and converts it to String
  char character = alphabet.charAt(numArray[ctr]);
  String s = String.valueOf(character);
  System.out.println(s);

//loop for putting the letters to the 2D array
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; board.length; i++) {
    int gen = (int) (Math.random()*4); //random square for letter
    for(int j = 0; j &lt;= gen; j++) {
        if(i == 0 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 5) { //row 1
          board[i][gen] = s;
        }
    }
  }

<p>Traditionally (without Codeigniter), we use this JS code to upload the file (using Uploadify version 3):</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){

        'swf':         'uploadify.swf',
        'uploader':    'uploadify.php'
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>But in my case, I would like the <code>uploader</code> file to be a method (ex: <strong>upload</strong>) of a class (ex: <strong>profile</strong>), where this method performs the file upload (in my case, an image) in the same way we did with <code>uploadify.php</code>.</p>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    $('#upload-input').uploadify({

        'uploader':    '&lt;?= base_url() ?&gt;profile/upload/'
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This shows me a <code>HTTP Error (500)</code> by Uploadify box.</p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>I've got a AkkaSystem that I use to create an Inbox object and send a message to a ExecutiveSupervisor. </p>

<pre><code>ActorSystem akkaSystem = ActorSystem.create(""myAkkaSystem"");

Props executiveProps = Props.create(ExecutiveSupervisor.class);
TestActorRef&lt;ExecutiveSupervisor&gt; executiveSupervisorTestActorRef = TestActorRef.create(akkaSystem, executiveProps, ""testExecutiveSupervisor"");

    final Inbox inbox = Inbox.create(akkaSystem);
    inbox.send(executiveSupervisorTestActorRef, new Object());
    ResultAndData result = (Object)inbox.receive(Duration.create(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS));

 }};
</code></pre>

<p>The ResultAndData object is passed into the ExecutiveSupervisor class that is an UnTypedActor and is received correctly when I look at it while debugging. </p>

<p>Execution goes through the code in the actor very happily.
At a point in the worker I expect it to return the same object it was passed, (ResultAndData) to the Inbox of the JUnit at test at ActorSystem level. I.e. I want the worker to return to its parent the same object it was passed.</p>

<p>But then, just as it tries to return with the below line:</p>

<pre><code>log.info(""SUCCESS!!!!!!!!!!!"");
getContext().parent().tell(result, getSelf());  //FAILS HERE
</code></pre>

<p>At which point I get this message:</p>

<blockquote>

[1] dead letters encountered. This logging can be turned off or adjusted with configuration settings 'akka.log-dead-letters' and 'akka.log-dead-letters-during-shutdown'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically the message is describes exactly what I want to happen, but it just doesn't.
I want a ResultAndData object returned from the testExecutiveSupervisor to its parent the default/user.</p>

<p>If I put a line in the JUnit:</p>

<pre><code>expectMsgEquals(duration(""2 seconds""), result);
</code></pre>

<p>with ""result"" being my ResultAndData object it will always time out as the message doesn't get through.</p>

For example if I have this 2-D list:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; combo = namedtuple('combo', 'i, f, s')
&gt;&gt;&gt; combo_mat = [[combo(i + 3*j, float(i + 3*j), str(i + 3*j)) for i in range(3)]

 [combo(i=6, f=6.0, s='6'), combo(i=7, f=7.0, s='7'), combo(i=8, f=8.0, s='8')]]
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like the 3 results to be:</p>

<pre><code>[[0, 1, 2],
 [3, 4, 5],
 [6, 7, 8]]

[[0.0, 1.0, 2.0],
 [3.0, 4.0, 5.0],
 [6.0, 7.0, 8.0]]

[['0', '1', '2'],
 ['3', '4', '5'],
 ['6', '7', '8']]
</code></pre>

<p>If I just had a 1-dimensional list of tuples I'd use <code>zip(*mylist)</code>, like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zip(*[combo(i=0, f=0.0, s='0'), combo(i=1, f=1.0, s='1'), combo(i=2, f=2.0, s='2')])
[(0, 1, 2), (0.0, 1.0, 2.0), ('0', '1', '2')]
</code></pre>

<p>And I can extend this to my situation just by nesting:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zip(*[zip(*combs) for combs in combo_mat])
[((0, 1, 2),
  (3, 4, 5),
  (6, 7, 8)),
 ((0.0, 1.0, 2.0),
  (3.0, 4.0, 5.0),
  (6.0, 7.0, 8.0)),
 (('0', '1', '2'),
  ('3', '4', '5'),
  ('6', '7', '8'))]
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't give me the lists I wanted, and nested unpacking <code>zip(*)</code> functions isn't that readable. Anyone have any ideas for a more pythonic solution? Bonus points if you can work the names of the tuples' attributes in there somewhere in the end result.</p>

<p>Actually, now that I think of it, it would be <strong>ideal</strong> if I could have a dict that mapped the name of the tuple attribute to its respective matrix, like:</p>

<pre><code>{'i': [[0, 1, 2],
       [3, 4, 5],
       [6, 7, 8]], 
 'f': [[0.0, 1.0, 2.0],

       ['3', '4', '5'],
       ['6', '7', '8']]}

GXT MVC worked OK, but it seemed like overkill for GWT and was hard to make work with browser history. I've heard of <a href=""http://puremvc.org/"">PureMVC</a> and <a href=""http://gwtiger.org/"">GWTiger</a>, but never used them. Our custom MQ solution worked pretty well, but made it difficult to test components with JUnit.</p>

It's just a bitmap property and a call to <code>graphics.drawimage</code> in <code>onpaint</code> (so a cheap <code>imagebutton</code>). This too fails to render. I even included a check to make sure it wasn't trying to render a null image and never refreshing or anything, but no luck.</p>

What if I have 3 types of products having different discounts. </p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>

<p>In my example i am using three outlets(NIKE/PUMA/ADIDAS)</p>

<p><strong>Adidas:</strong> All products are at 50% off.</p>

<p><strong>PUMA:</strong>   Buy 2 items and get 50% off on the third.</p>

<p><strong>NIKE:</strong>   Buy one item and get other free.</p>

<p>I have just created random scenarios, but there can by hundreds of brands each having there own criteria of giving discounts. Where should i handle this thing?</p>

<p>My <strong>Database Schema</strong> has two tables regarding product:</p>

<p><strong>Product table:</strong> having details about a product i.e. name, image, brand</p>

<p><strong>Product Inventory Table:</strong> having products options i.e. size, color</p>

<p>I hope I made my question clear, thanks a lot.</p>

(ok ok ok... a days’ work perhaps)</p>

<p>When the mobile provider gets a request for a file it's passed through a very clever application which essentially strips it down to 'just' functional. This is returned and the file works as expected even though it has been modified slightly (or heavily in the case of images). </p>

<p>The clever software which does this re-writes the request header also, which is causing the serialiser to ignore the response as it's not of the correct content type... I think anyway. </p>

<p>normal request : Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8
SIM proxy request : Content-Type text/xml; charset=utf-8</p>

<p>issue number one with this is the request requires a verb in the web.config enabling GET/POST (easy added)</p>

<p>issue number two with this, the GET request is built like so <em>www.site.com?a.asmx/function?value=""a value""</em> the JSON serialiser understand this is a string type so it removes the appended quotation marks and accepts the parameter, when the serialiser isn't used it will actually add more quotation marks ""\""a value\"""". (Easy fixed)</p>

<p>Issue number three the return value is XML and not JSON. Requires allot of work but can be fixed should i not be able to find another way.</p>

<p>I've just been reading the W3 for the HTTP header 'Cache-Control' and apparently I can send 'no-transform' and (assuming they conform) the proxy will ignore it. That would be fantastic. </p>

<p>Question is... How do I change the header value of a GET request via Sys.Net.WebServiceProxy.invoke()?</p>

<p>Also has any one any experience with this? the internet reveals little discussion on the topic. </p>

<p>I'm trying to count the position of a worksheet without using VBA. Each sheet represents a month, and has a standardized name (e.g. JAN-15, FEB-15, MAR-15, etc.). My idea is to find the position by counting the number of sheets between JAN-15 and the current sheet. A1 of each sheet = 1, which gets summed across the sheets using a 3D reference.</p>

<p>Using February as an example, I can hard code this with no problem:</p>

<p>=SUM('JAN-15:FEB-15'!A1)</p>

<p>When I do this, I get the expected result of 2. However, I want each month's sheet to dynamically generate its position without having to change the formula each time. So I tried this:</p>

<p>Cell named FIRSTMONTH ='JAN-15<br>
Cell named CURRMONTH =RIGHT(CELL(""FILENAME"",A1),6)<br>
N1 =CONCATENATE(""'"",FIRSTMONTH,"":"",CURRMONTH,""'!A1"")<br>
(N1 evaluates correctly as 'JAN-15:FEB-15'!A1)</p>

<p>When I try this formula to generate the position:</p>

<p>=SUM(INDIRECT(N1))</p>

<p>I get a #REF! error. I've also tried this variation:</p>

<p>=SUM(INDIRECT(""N1""))</p>

<p>Which returns 0.</p>

<p>Anyone have an idea of how I can get this to work? Or is there a better way that doesn't use VBA?</p>

<p>From what I understand, CommonJS in it's most basic form requires a library to be wrapped in a closure, and that closure should be made available as a parameter of an 'exports' parameter. That way, the code is neatly contained in its own namespace (via a named variable) and doesn't pollute the global namespace.</p>

<p>jQuery itself should fall under the '$' namespace.</p>

<p><strong>Ala:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var $ = require(jquery);
</code></pre>

<p>But my plugin should also fit under the '$' namespace.</p>

<p><strong>Plugin code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(function( $ ) {
  // plugin code goes here
})(jquery);

exports.jquery = jquery // will this work?
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Ex:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var $ = require(jquery);
$ = require(jquery-csv.js); // will this work?
</code></pre>

<p>To work in the browser, everything is setup to be callable from the '$' namespace even though my modules are setup as a sub-namespace of '$' (ie '$.csv').</p>

<p>Is there a standard way to do multiple requires on a single namespace? If not, there a viable alternative (ex doing a shallow copy on the plugin code)?</p>

<p><em>Note: The anonymous function wrapper follows the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring"" rel=""nofollow"">standard jquery guidelines</a>.</em></p>

I’m trying to compile one my „C“ project for 64 bit platform (but it seems that the problem is not target related). The project includes one *.pc file, which has to be precompiled by Pro*C/C++ precompiler. Problem is, that I’m not able to precompile that file. <strong>The precompilation fails during parsing of windows.h header file</strong>. Please help!!!</p>

<p>More details:</p>

<p>1)  <strong>Source file:</strong> My my.pc file begins as follows: </p>

<pre><code> #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;  
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 #include &lt;time.h&gt;
 #include &lt;assert.h&gt;
 #include &lt;sqlca.h&gt;
 #include &lt;sqlcpr.h&gt;

…..
</code></pre>

<p>Note: The first <code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;</code> is sufficient for error invocation.</p>

<p>2)  <strong>Configuration files:</strong> The default pcscfg.cfg file is empty, the project configuration file my.cfg looks like follows:</p>

<pre><code>sys_include=(d:\Progra~1\Micros~2.0\VC\include,c:\Progra~2\WI3CF2~1\8.0\Include\um,c:\Progra~2\WI3CF2~1\8.0\Include\shared,$PROC11_ORACLE_HOME\PRECOMP\PUBLIc)
sqlcheck=full
parse=FULL
define=_WIN64 (or without this line)
</code></pre>

<p>Note: d:\Progra~1\Micros~2.0\VC\include = D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include, c:\Progra~2\WI3CF2~1\8.0\Include\um = C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Include\um, c:\Progra~2\WI3CF2~1\8.0\Include\shared = C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Include\shared, $PROC11_ORACLE_HOME = d:\oracle\product\11.2.0\client_2. Those paths are there to find all the needed header files.</p>

<p>3)  <strong>Command line:</strong> I have defined the following Command line for my my.pc file in the Custom Build Tool/General options: </p>

<pre><code>$(PROC11_ORACLE_HOME)\bin\proc config=.\my.cfg iname=%(Filename).pc oname=.\%(Filename).c include=""$(MSDEV_HOME)\vc\include"".
</code></pre>

<p>Note: The $(MSDEV_HOME) = D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0.</p>

<p>4)  <strong>Platform:</strong> The MSVC platform is set to x64, but I obtained similar results for Win32 also.</p>

<p>5)  <strong>Error messages:</strong> Error messages received during precompilation if there is <strong>define=_WIN64 involved</strong> in my.cfg file:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt;  Syntax error at line 46, column 1, file d:\Progra~1\Micros~2.0\VC\include\vadefs.h:

1&gt;  The symbol "";"" was substituted for ""typedef"" to continue.
</code></pre>

<p>6)  <strong>Error messages:</strong> Error messages received during precompilation if the <strong>define=_WIN64 is NOT involved</strong> in my.cfg file:</p>

1&gt;  ; , = ( [
</code></pre>

<p>7)  <strong>File vadefs.h:</strong> The critical lines in the vadefs.h header file look like follows:</p>

<pre><code> #ifndef _UINTPTR_T_DEFINED
 #ifdef  _WIN64
 typedef unsigned __int64    uintptr_t; (this is line no. 46)
 #else
 typedef _W64 unsigned int   uintptr_t; (this is line no. 48)
 #endif
 #define _UINTPTR_T_DEFINED
 #endif
</code></pre>

<p>Question is, why the precompilation fails in the standard Microsoft header file. May be there is some mess in macros, e.g. something related to the _WIN64 one? Or should I add another macro to the configuration file? I have read plenty of discussions but without progress. Any ideas would be very appreciated!</p>

Some users will choose to make this data encrypted, some won't, so some of those 160 bit fields will be ciphertext some will be plaintext. A boolean will indicate which one the user is using. The important thing here is that I need this field to be exactly 160 bits long. However, a 128-bit cipher will mean I have to put in 256 bits in as plaintext, which is fine, just use a buffer string, but this means that the output is 256 bits when what is stored must be exactly 160 bits. And I can't simply cut off the ciphertext or that would mess up the decryption. So how can I use a 128-bit block cipher like AES (note it MUST be a 128 bit block cipher, I can't change that) to encrypt 160 bits into 160 bits such that it can be decrypted back into the original 128 bits.</p>

<p><strong>Just a note: The field in the database must stay exactly 160 bits. No this can not change. The size of the blocks can not change either (it's going to be a 128-bit cipher no matter what). No we can't store it in a different field if it is ciphertext then if it was plain text, it must be the same 160 bit field.</strong></p>

<p>However, I noted that this didn't conform to what I expected. Is there a bug in the algorithm, or is it normal to see this? I still see a fair amount of punctuation characters in the password that is generated when I expect to see zero.</p>

<p>As a test, I threw a Grid on an ASP.NET page and wrote this to see what the output was:</p>

    public int NumNonAlphaNum { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
    public string  Display { get; set; }

<p>Although the results show a progression towards more and more punctuation, the actual requirement is not honoured.</p>

I got the first section to repeat twice but when I apply the repeat directive to the second section, the second section disappears....</p>

<p>To accomplish both tasks, I used the AngularJS <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/angular/tryit.asp?filename=try_ng_repeat_array"" rel=""nofollow"">Ng-Repeat</a> directive. I made sure to only <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12860595/how-to-define-two-angular-apps-modules-in-one-page"">bootstrap</a> or initialize the Angular app once in a outer div that contains both sections. I followed syntax from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25109901/ng-repeat-on-two-arrays"">Objects</a> to group data together in JavaScript. I haven't read anything that says you can't have more than one ng-init(I used two to initialize data for the two sections)</p>

<p>But this id came out as the same when pushing any of the buttons.</p>

<p>Do I need to create a separate intent for each button that all call the same activity? Or can I use 1 intent and just change what value it passes to MapsActivity?</p>

<p>I hope I've explained this problem clearly enough! Thanks!</p>

<p>Recently, I have been using extraTrees model in caret package. However, I noticed that the probability function for extraTrees model is set to NULL by using the following scripts:</p>

<pre><code>extratrees_para &lt;- getModelInfo('extraTrees', regex = F)[[1]]

extratrees_para$prob
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that in the original package of extraTress, it can be used to generate probability prediction for classification problems. So I'd like to specify the prob function for extratrees_para. </p>

<pre><code>extratrees_para$prob &lt;- function(modelFit, newdata, submodels = NULL){
as.data.frame(predict(modelFit, newdata, probability = TRUE))
}
extratrees_para$type &lt;- 'Classification'
</code></pre>

<p>Then I construct train function to build the model</p>

<pre><code>extratreesGrid &lt;- expand.grid(.mtry=1:2,
                      .numRandomCuts=1)

  modelfit_extratrees &lt;- train(outcome~., data=training_scaled_sel,
                         method = extratrees_para,
                         metric = ""ROC"",
                         trControl = trainControl(method = 'repeatedcv',
                                                  repeats=1,
                                                  classProb = T,
                                                  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary),
                         ntree = 3000, 
                         tuneGrid = extratreesGrid) 
</code></pre>

<p>However, I keep getting this error message which is not very informative </p>

<p>""Error in train.default(x, y, weights = w, ...) : 
  final tuning parameters could not be determined
In addition: Warning messages:

The window has a ListBox control that lists the configuration sets by name and its ItemsSource has a binding set to a list of configuration sets.</p>

<p>I'm trying to remove the item in the code behind file for the window..</p>

<pre><code>private void RemoveButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    var removedItems = configSetListBox.SelectedItems;

    foreach(ConfigSet removedItem in removedItems)
    {
        configSetListBox.Items.Remove(removedItem);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My code yields an invalid operation exception stating ""Access and modify elements with ItemsControl.ItemsSource instead."" What property should I be accessing to properlyremove items from the ListBox? Or is there possibly a more elegant way to handle this in WPF? My implementation is a bit WinForm-ish if you will :)</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<pre><code>private void RemoveButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{   
    foreach(ConfigSet removedItem in configSetListBox.SelectedItems)
    {
        (configSetListBox.ItemsSource as List&lt;ConfigSet&gt;).Remove(removedItem);
    }
    configSetListBox.Items.Refresh();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my case I had a List as the ItemSource binding type so I had to cast it that way. Without refreshing the Items collection, the ListBox doesn't update; so that was necessary for my solution.</p>

<p>I've tried upgrading Mysql 5.1 to 5.6, and I've also tried simply removing mysql completely and doing a fresh install, but it just won't work.</p>

<p>For example if I run <code>yum remove mysql mysql-*</code></p>

<p>It confirms that there are no mysql packages installed.</p>

<p>I downloaded the rpm for Linux 5 from the MySQL website.</p>

<p>I then do a <code>yum localinstall mysql-community-release-el5-5.noarch.rpm</code> but that says ""does not update installed packages"".</p>

<p>I've tried removing mysql-community-release-el5-5 and also the el6 which i accidently installed, but using <code>yum remove</code> they both say ""no match for argument: PACKAGENAMEHERE""</p>

<p>So instead I try <code>rpm -Uvh mysql-community-release-el5-5.noarch.rpm</code> and it says it is already installed.</p>

<p>So I ran <code>rpm -e mysql-community-release</code> to remove it, then did the previous step again and it didn't say it was already installed, so presumably has now installed it again.</p>

<p>Then I run <code>yum install mysql-community-server</code> and this is where I get the transaction check error:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>However I am having significantly more trouble with a post. The html of the form which I am trying to simulate is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"" action=""managefile?operation=upload""&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;h3 align=""center""&gt;Upload File&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""Submit"" value=""Upload""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The get API's generally expect the username and password to be passed as parameters. Since I don't think I can pass a POST with parameters I have tried sending the post with data split by boundaries using techniques I've found on various pages (including here). None of these have worked.</p>

<p>Here is an example of some code I tried which did not work:</p>

<pre><code>Dim theURL As String, theRequest As Object, theBody As String, theBoundary As String
theBoundary = ""-----------------13850284693"" ' Sample, generating from timestamp        
theBody = theBoundary &amp; vbCrLf
theBody = theBody &amp; ""Content-Disposition: form-data"" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf
theBody = theBody &amp; ""user=myUser&amp;pass=MyPass"" &amp; vbCrLf ' I am wondering if this also needs to include action
theBody = theBody &amp; theBoundary &amp; vbCrLf
theBody = theBody &amp; ""Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""""fname""""; filename=""""update.xml"""""" &amp; vbCrLf
theBody = theBody &amp; ""Content-Type: text/xml"" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf
theBody = theBody &amp; ""&lt;MyXML&gt;&lt;Node1&gt;ff&lt;/Node1&gt;&lt;/MyXML&gt;""
theBody = theBody &amp; vbCrLf
theBody = theBody &amp; theBoundary &amp; ""--"" &amp; vbCrLf

theURL = ""http://localhost/myapp/managefile?operation=upload""
Set theRequest = CreateObject(""WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1"")
theRequest.Open ""POST"", theURL, False
theRequest.setRequestHeader ""Cache-Control"", ""no-cache""
theRequest.setRequestHeader ""Content-Type"", ""multipart/form-data; boundary="" &amp; theBoundary
theRequest.setRequestHeader ""Content-Length"", Len(theBody)    
theRequest.Send theBody
</code></pre>

<p>The page I get back from this example is that I am not logged in, so it seems it is not passing my parameters properly.</p>

<p>I've also tried passing the username and password as part of the URL, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>theURL = ""http://localhost/myapp/managefile?operation=upload&amp;user=myUser&amp;pass=myPass""
</code></pre>

<p>And from this I get an error saying it (the API) expects</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MyXML&gt;...&lt;/MyXML&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and it is getting:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------13850284693..(continues)..&lt;MyXML&gt;&lt;Node1&gt;ff&lt;/Node1&gt;&lt;/MyXML&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>This leads me to believe that it is logging in fine but not doing the post properly.</p>

<p>I tried doing the same thing and just sending the XML but this also didn't work. This wouldn't make sense to me to work since the API would not know which parameter to associate the XML to.</p>

<p>The last thing I tried was running a simple get which logs the user in and returns the cookie and then passes this back. This seemed to do the same thing as above, still have a problem with the POST.</p>

<p>Here is my try setting the cookie. It appears to work the same as when I pass the parameters -- it looks like login works but it fails to do the post correctly (specifically the xml I am trying to send):</p>

<pre><code>Dim theLoginRequest, thePostRequest
Set theLoginRequest = CreateObject(""WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1"")
theLoginRequest.Open ""GET"", ""localhost/myapp/login?user=myUser&amp;pass=myPass""
theLoginRequest.Send
Set thePostRequest = CreateObject(""WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1"")
thePostRequest.Open ""POST, ""&lt;post request&gt;"", False
thePostRequest.setRequestHeader ""Cookie"", theLoginRequest.getResponseHeader(""Set-Cookie"")
</code></pre>

<p>...etc. </p>

<hr>

<p>The string that I have in there is identical to the content of the file that I am able to upload to the form without a problem.</p>

<p>However, you can't call a version until you actually make a release in semantic versioning because the last digit has to be incremental.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<p>A release process has 6 steps. There are 2 builds coming through triggered from commit 1 and commit 2.</p>

<p>Before commit 1 finish the release process in step 6, you can't really determine what semantic commit 2/build 2 is going to be. If commit 1/build 1 fails, commit 2 / build 2 would be 1.0.0. If build 1 succeeds, build 2 would be 1.0.1.</p>

<p>If you are authoring nuget package or .net binaries, the version information would be already in the artifact itself and there's no way to change that.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I think I've found the root of the problem. In the old situation, using the slow drawing process, all the cells were drown in advance and had an index. Now, only the cells that are in view are drawn (the first eight) and new ones are created on the fly when they come into view (and get a corresponding index number).</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Is there a way to feed the data to the new cells as soon as they are created?</p>

<p>The if executes when a date is passed to the method, otherwise it goes to the else part. </p>

<p>When debugging, the flow hits the else part, it executes the Linq query; however the foreach that follows the if..else does not iterate. It skips the foreach loop as if there were no data returned. </p>

<p>When I tried the Linq query in LinqPad, I can see it returns results. This is driving me nuts, and don't know what is wrong. Kindly take a look and tell me what is wrong. </p>

<p>I am new to GO and am wondering if anyone sees any major optimizations or fixes that could make programs using the GO portion of this repo run faster.  </p>

<p>I have created the programs below, one using PCRE and one using the standard regex library.  However, I don't seem to be getting a performance boost with PCRE.  In fact, the PCRE library seems to be a little slower.  Am I approaching this the wrong way?</p>

  scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)

  for scanner.Scan() {

    line := scanner.Text()
    fields := strings.Split(line, ""\t"")
    fmt.Println(regex.FindIndex([]byte(fields[0])))

  }

}

<p>For example, in this case <code>#mnsb</code> is selected:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ohOkh.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ohOkh.png"" alt=""&lt;code&gt;#mnsb&lt;/code&gt; selected""></a></p>

<p>hence after a reload it gets expanded:</p>

<p>My ideal workflow would be that elements with the same xpath of elements that were expanded before the reload should be automatically expanded again. In my example, say before reloading I have both <code>#mnsb</code> and <code>#gb-main</code> expanded:</p>

<p>But it is only using value of value attribute() to store in DB. For Example if the customer changes value passed in the text box(passed by value attribute) and submit the information the changed value is not being stored in DB rather value stored in value attribute is getting saved.</p>

<p>I am passing values to a html form, from a previous PHP page like this.. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""parentid1.php"" method=""post""&gt; 
&lt;label&gt;id:&lt;/label&gt; 
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""id"" value=""&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($_GET['id']) ?&gt;"" size=""50""/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""submit"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

<p>In my next file i am trying yo update the values declared like this:</p>

<pre><code>$value = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['id']);
$value1 = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['name']);  
$sql = ""UPDATE table SET name='$value1'WHERE doi ='$value'"";

<p>Here is the case:
A form structure of text type will be formed with some value already in it.
Now customer wants to change the data in form box changes it and submits it but the changed is not being saved in the DB rather the previous value is only saved.</p>

<p>I then copied the two serialization files from the remote server to my client, and tried reading them in using a simple Groovy script (i.e. not from within JBoss), first the user-xxx.ser file, and then the ssi-xxx.ser file.</p>

<p>The results under the SSI bit mirror my experience serializing across the net. The serialized user alone, however, contains both groups, as I want! These two serialization files were generated in the same method, using the same raw data - though the user was obviously nested within the other data structure.</p>

<p>How can the results for the <em>allgroups</em> user be different?? I'm baffled, and would be very grateful for any clarification.</p>

<p>Is there a way to display all of the input values like this, without compromising the actual calculation of numbers?</p>

<p>Right now, if a comma is entered in any of the inputs, than the calculated input (input that displays the calculation), throws an error (NaN). I am wondering if there is any way to do this using something such as PHP or JavaScript?</p>

<p>Here is a picture of a working example of my loan calculator:</p>

<p>I also tried to put <code>document.ready()</code> around it, but that didn't help neither. The Datepicker is showing I and can use some key controls but I can't <strong>click</strong> on a date so it would appear into my textbox where I open the datepicker with an <code>onclick</code>. So I can't select another date, it just doesn't select the date and because of that the dialog stays open until I click out of it.</p>

<p>Any help please? In Firefox, Chrome, Iceaweasl it's working perfectly.</p>

<p>UPDATE*<em>*</em></p>

<p>Apparently this had to do something with IE itself, i tried on many other IE's on different computers where i didn't have this problem. I couldn't trackdown what exactly could be the issue but for me this case can be closed.</p>

I set up swipe left and there's a back view under my list item view. On this back view I have a text view ""Delete"". After click, delete operation is being performed. Data in adapter is being refreshed. Row is deleted ..but ""swiped state"" is being set on a row which has position close to that row which was deleted. I believie it happens because ""swiped state"" is remembered by convertview. When I comment out  checking if convertview is null, problem is gone, but list scroll performance is unacceptable.

</code></pre>

<p>But some actions require connection to <code>ravendb</code> and come don't. So I've decided to create custom attribute and mark methods need to have DocumentSession opened with it. Here is an example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>    //
    // GET: /Create

    [DataAccess]
    public ActionResult Create()
    {
        return View();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And I stuck. My plan was to retrieve actions' attributes in the <code>OnActionExecuted</code> method and if <code>[DataAccess]</code> is present, open <code>DocumentSession</code>.</p>

<p>In the <code>OnActionExecuted</code> I can retrieve action name (method's name) via <code>filterContext.ActionDescriptor.ActionName</code> statement. But how I can retrieve method's attributes of the given class using reflection?</p>

<p>I found out that it might be <code>Attribute.GetCustomAttributes</code> call, but closest I got — I need to have <code>MemberInfo</code> object of the method. But how I can get this <code>MemberInfo</code> for method given by name?</p>

<ol>
<li>User goes to Service Provider URL that invokes <code>Saml2AuthenticationModule.Current.SignIn</code>(args);</li>
<li>The module routes a request to the Identity Provider.</li>
<li>Depending on the SP's AssertionConsumerService metadata, the IdP sends an SSO response back to the SP. In my current tests, this URL is ""{rootdomain}/<code>ServiceProvider/saml/post/ac</code>"". As far as I can tell, this URL is not configurable.</li>
<li>The module intercepts this response, does its thing to configure IClaimsIdentity, and then redirects flow back into the SP application (arg passed in step 1). </li>
</ol>

<p>When targeting the Windows Azure Emulator instead of IIS Express, I changed the web.config to point to a different SP metadata file, with a different AssertionConsumerService that fits with the emulator URL:</p>

<p>When debugging in the azure compute emulator, the flow stops after step #3. When it reaches step #4, I end up looking at a 404 page for this URL:</p>

<pre><code>https://127.0.0.1/ServiceProvider/saml/post/ac

<p><strong>What's going on here? Isn't the module supposed to intercept this URL and process the SAML response? Why is this working in IIS Express but not in the azure compute emulator?</strong></p>

When the page first loads the tool tip works fine and shows my ""Click to expand"" tool tip. When the user clicks on the ""more..."" or ""less..."" text it should trigger the click function (which it does); toggle visibility of the blog post (which it does); toggle the text from more to less or vice versa (which it does); and then update the title for the button so the tool tip shows the new text (which it does update as seen in Chrome).

<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/webdav_101/archive/2008/06/02/system-net-mail-with-ssl-to-authenticate-against-port-465.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/webdav_101/archive/2008/06/02/system-net-mail-with-ssl-to-authenticate-against-port-465.aspx</a></p>

<p>So, I'm trying to use System.Net.Mail to connect to an SMTP server that I don't have any control over, and it's failing.  How can I know for sure that it's failing because the server wants an ""implicit"" SSL connection?   What test can I do from the client side?</p>

<p>Here's my question, please.
In my JqueryMobile web application I've created categories and records.
Each category hosts different records.</p>

<p>What I'd like to print out to the user is the number of records that exists in each category.</p>

<p>For selecting the categories I made a normal transaction</p>

<pre><code>function getAll() {
db.transaction(function (transaction) {
    transaction.executeSql((""SELECT * FROM tags""), [], getAllSuccess, errorCB);
});
}

function getAllSuccess(tx, result) {
$('#bags_ul').empty();
var output = '';
$.each(result.rows, function (index) {
    var row = result.rows.item(index);
    output += '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""link_to_tag"" data-tagnome=""' + row['tagnome'] + '"" data-tagtipo=""' + row['tagtipo'] + '"" data-tagid=""' + row['tagid'] + '"" &gt;' + row['tagnome'] + '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
});

$('#bags_ul').html(output);
$('#bags_ul').listview();
$('#bags_ul').listview('refresh');
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>In my example, the function getAll makes the query, and if get success it execute the getAllSuccess function, that fills in the LI fields of my list.</p>

<p>The problem is that I need to create a query inside the $.each() to get the records of the category.</p>

<p>I've tried to execute another transaction within it, and I can successfully get the number of records thorugh the console.log function, <strong>but the problem is that I don't know how to pass it to the ""mother"" function that in facts pushes the HTML to the page.</strong></p>

<p>Could you please help me?
As you have understood, I need to know the ""logic"" that is behind this.

My version of sqlite is the latest from official windows binary distribution - 3.7.13.</p>

<p>The problem is that under heavy load on database, sqlite API functions (such as sqlite3_step) are returning SQLITE_BUSY.</p>

<p>I pass the following pragmas when initializing a connection:</p>

<pre><code>journal_mode = WAL
page_size = 4096
synchronous = FULL
foreign_keys = on
</code></pre>

<p>The databas is one-file database. And I'm using Mono 2.10.8 and Mono.Data.Sqlite assembly provided with it to access database.</p>

<p>I'm testing it with 50 parallel threads which are sending 50 subsequent http-requests each to my application. On every request some reading and writing are done to the database. Every set of  IO operations is executed inside the transaction.</p>

<p>Everything goes well until near 400th - 700th request. In this (random) moment API functions are starting to return SQLITE_BUSY permanently (To be more exact - until the limit of retries is reached).</p>

<p>As far as i know WAL mode transparently supports parallel reads and writes. I've guessed that it could be because of attempt to read database while checkpoint operation is executed. But even after turning autocheckpoint off the situation remains the same.</p>

<p>What could be wrong in this situation? 
How to serve large amount of parallel database IO correctly?</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>Only one connection per request is supposed. 
I use nhibernate configured with WebSessionContext.</p>

<p>I initialize my NHibernate session like this:</p>

<pre><code>ISession session = null;

//factory variable is session factory
if (CurrentSessionContext.HasBind(factory))
{
  session = factory.GetCurrentSession();
  if (session == null)
    CurrentSessionContext.Unbind(factory);
}

if (session == null)
{
  session = factory.OpenSession();
  CurrentSessionContext.Bind(session);
}

return session;
</code></pre>

<p>And on HttpApplication.EndRequest i release it like this:</p>

<pre><code>//factory variable is session factory
if (CurrentSessionContext.HasBind(factory))
{
  try
  {
    CurrentSessionContext.Unbind(factory)
      .Dispose();
  }
  catch (Exception ee)
  {
    Logr.Error(""Error uninitializing session"", ee);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So as far as i know there should be only one connection per request life cycle. While proceessing the request, code is executed sequentially (ASP.NET MVC 3). So it doesn't look like any concurency is possible here. Can i conclude that no connections are shared in this case?</p>

"27341944","1","27342077","","2014-12-07 11:01:32","","0","144","<p>So I am writing a program that displays each letter of a word for 1 second with a 1 second interval between the letters. (It's for a spelling exercise for grade 1). I am currently using the sleep function to  ""pause"" the program for 1 second before it ""updates"" again. After that it displays the word for a second and then removes it. I repaint before the sleep function, else it does not seem to update in time.</p>

<p>Here is the basic function:</p>

<pre><code>QString word = ""apple"";
QThread thread;

for(int i = 0; i &lt; word.size(); i++)
{
    ui-&gt;label1-&gt;setText(word[i]);
    ui-&gt;label1-&gt;repaint();
    thread.sleep(1);
    ui-&gt;label1-&gt;setText("""");

}

ui-&gt;label1-&gt;setText(word);
ui-&gt;label1-&gt;repaint();
thread.sleep(1);
ui-&gt;label1-&gt;setText("""");

<p>This works fine, except the program stops responding (even though I can see the correct output is still displaying) until the whole function is done executing then it works fine again. Is there another way I can accomplish this goal without using sleep? I am quite new to Qt.</p>

<p><strong>Update I made</strong>. I made a new class that will handle the timer, but it does not seem to actually connect the signal and slot. Here is the .h file:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef TIMERDISPLAY_H
#define TIMERDISPLAY_H

#include &lt;QObject&gt;

class TimerDisplay:public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    TimerDisplay();

public slots:
    void expired();

private:
    QTimer timer;
};

#endif // TIMERDISPLAY_H
</code></pre>

<p>and the .cpp file:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""timerdisplay.h""
#include &lt;QDebug&gt;

TimerDisplay::TimerDisplay()
{
    connect(&amp;timer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(expired()));
    timer.setSingleShot(false);
    timer.setInterval(1000);
    timer.start();
}

<p>On Linux, the time it takes to redraw the map every game tick is around 3ms. On Windows (and also OSx) it's around 100ms spiking to 500ms. </p>

<p>This effect has been observed on 4 different computers ranging from typical laptop to an i7-3770K + 660 gaming machine. The CPU usage when this occurs is around 10-20% with RAM usage of the program being around 1GB. The problem has been researched on the internet in many places to no avail and also our section leaders (who are in charge of the project) were stumped. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Here is the paint component in the JPanel and the setEntityImage method. You can see where the time stamps are pulled from at the bottom of the paintComponent. The setEntityImage is being set every 500ms with a new BufferedImage that is pre-drawn on another thread before being passed into this JPanel. I'm including that code as I'm also curious if it's a possible threading issue.</p>

<p>This code is called every 500 ms to consist of a 'game tick', it draws the images (which are all pre-loaded in a static singleton class).</p>

<pre><code>    BufferedImage entityImg = ImageUtil.getFromGraphics(map.getWidth() * TILE_WIDTH
            + TILE_WIDTH, map.getHeight() * TILE_HEIGHT + TILE_HEIGHT);

    g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING,
            RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; map.getHeight(); i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; map.getWidth(); j++)
        {
            try
            {
                int x, y;
                x = (j * TILE_WIDTH_HALF - i * TILE_WIDTH_HALF)
                        + map.getWidth() * TILE_WIDTH_HALF;
                y = j * TILE_HEIGHT_HALF + i * TILE_HEIGHT_HALF;

                Entity e = map.getTile(i, j).getEntity();

                if (e != null)
                {
                    g2.drawImage(e.getImage(), x, y, 32, 32, null);
                }

            catch (Exception e)
            {
            }
        }
    }

    panel.setEntityImage(entityImg);

    // Draw box over square mouse is hovering over

<p>as you can see i am checking if a macro has been defined and which one.
now i want to run the program with my Makefile doing the next command line</p>

<pre><code>make some_var=SCHED_RR
</code></pre>

<p>this pseudo command (because i don't know how to really do it) is meant to predefine the macro SCHED_RR
also i want to be able to write the command</p>

<pre><code>make some_var=SCHED_PB
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>make some_var1=SCHED_RR some_var2=SCHED_PB
</code></pre>

<p>the last one is for the case that someone would want to predefine both scheduling</p>

<p>now my problem is: i don't know how and where to write it in my Makefile
and also how to write it in the command line?</p>

<p>this is my Makefile which of course shows that my real program is bigger
so where and what should i add to this make file</p>

"16107483","1","","","2013-04-19 14:54:22","","5","622","<p>Upon adding the session helper to the app controller Apache begins crashing. I've tracked the problem down a ways with logging and found that in /CORE/cake/libs/controller/component/session the function <code>check()</code> starts running once and doesn't complete. However, the function it calls ,<code>__start()</code>, runs infinitely (at least until Apache crashes it). And by running infinitely I mean the entire <code>__start()</code> function is run multiple times all the way through. Again, this happens once I add the session helper in app controller. Without it Cake seems to run fine until I hit a point where the session helper is used in a view. This system is being upgraded from Cake 1.1 and in Cake 1.1 the session helper was automatically included and ran fine. I've attempted this on both Cake 1.3.7 and Cake 1.3.15 with the same result. I'm guessing something with the session settings conflicts with the way Cake 1.3 does things. Below is my config/core file, the crash information from Apache, and the Apache log just before the crash. If any other information would be helpful please let me know in the comments. Any suggestions how to fix this? Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot to include a relevant <a href=""https://cakephp.lighthouseapp.com/projects/42648/tickets/1173-cakesession-circular-dependancy-race-condition-or-infinite-loop"" rel=""nofollow"">discussion here</a>. Unfortunately, they don't have a clear solution here, but they appear to want to fix the bug in cake, where I would be happy to alter my code to avoid the bug.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I recently discovered that the manager of this project plans to discontinue the use of database sessions in the future, so that completely fixes the situation for me. Of course I will leave this question up for future visitors though.</p>

<p>If you remove ObserveOn(Scheduler.Default), the function works at the same speed than a mono-threaded recursive function. Using ObserveOn, it seems a thread is created each time SelectMany is called, slowing down the process dramatically.</p>

<p>Is there a way to control/limit the maximum number of threads the Scheduler can use at the same time? </p>

<p>I have read the documentation on Scaldi's website, but what is unclear to me is how to use it with Akka.</p>

<p>What I have so far in my project:</p>

<pre><code>Models/ (Daos and case classes)
   User.scala
Services/  (Akka Actors)
   UserService.scala
   ProfileService.scala
Managers/  (Regular Manager Classes)
   UserManager.scala (The Trait Interface)
   UserManagerImpl.scala (An actual implementation)
   UserManagerMock.scala (Mocked version)
   etc..
</code></pre>

<p>In UserService.scala I would use an instance of the UserManager to do the work:</p>

<pre><code>class UserService extends ServiceActor with Injection
{
    val userManager = inject[UserManager]

    def receive = {
        case Register(email: String, password: String)
    }
}

object UserService extends Service
{
    case class Register(email: String, password: String)

    override protected val actorRef = Akka.system.actorOf(Props[UserService].withRouter(SmallestMailboxRouter(resizer = Some(resizer))))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then depending on the injected manager, the actor can be sort of mocked if it delegate all the work to the manager?</p>

<p>However, what if the managers needs to call other Services, which are just companion objects? Or Services calling other services that are also referenced via companion objects? </p>

<p>Does anyone have some pointers on how to integrate Akka with Scaldi? </p>

<p>I would like to do it with a single line of command-line with one of the best parsers, like Saxon-PE or BaseX.</p>

<p>So far the shortest solution that I (seemed to have) found is with these two lines:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar tagsoup-1.2.1.jar &lt;page.html &gt;page.xhtml""
java -cp saxon9pe.jar net.sf.saxon.Query -s:""page.xhtml"" -qs:""//DIV[@id='ps-content']""

<p>but all what it returns is this, that is not my expected block of html code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My questions are two:</p>

<ul>
<li>what's wrong with my command-lines? why they doesn't return the expected block of html code as defined by my XPATH?</li>
<li>since Saxon-PE has embedded TagSoup capability (see <a href=""https://www.odesk.com/leaving-odesk?ref=http%253A%252F%252Fsaxonica.com%252Fdocumentation9.4-demo%252Fhtml%252Fextensions%252Ffunctions%252Fparse-html.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.odesk.com/leaving-odesk?ref=http%253A%252F%252Fsaxonica.com%252Fdocumentation9.4-demo%252Fhtml%252Fextensions%252Ffunctions%252Fparse-html.html</a>), how can I integrate my two lines into a single line?</li>

<p>Let's assume that both rows in this table have identical values, except their IDs.</p>

<pre><code>Table ""PrimaryStuff""
ID | SomeValue
1  | ""I have value""
2  | ""I have value""
3  | ""I am different""
</code></pre>

<p>Let's also assume that a number of related tables exist.  Because duplicates were created in the ""PrimaryStuff"" table, often rows are created in these child tables that SHOULD all be related to a single record on the PrimaryStuff table.  <strong>The number and names of these tables are not under my control and should be considered dynamically at runtime.</strong> IE: I don't know the names or even the number of related records, as other people may edit the database without my knowledge.</p>

<pre><code>Table ""ForeignStuff""
ID | PrimaryStuffId | LocalValue
1| 1| ""I have the correct FK""
2| 1| ""I have the correct FK""
3| 2| ""I should get pointed to an FK of 1""
</code></pre>

<p>To resolve the duplication of PrimaryStuff's row 1 and 2, I wish to have ALL related tables change their FK's to 1s and then delete the PrimaryStuff's row 2.  This <em>SHOULD</em> be trivial, as if PrimaryStuff's row 1 didn't exist, I could just update the Primary Key on Row 2 to 1, and the changes would cascade out. I cannot do this because that would be a duplicate key in the PrimaryStuff's unique index.</p>

<p>Help! The code snippet is maybe not enough to answer the question, but references files and everything is in Github repository. The question was raised, because I am not sure if it is possible at all to have many Run Configuration for the same file. Then code snippets doesn't matter at all.</p>

<p>Update: Looking after a while at <a href=""https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/blob/master/org.nodeclipse.debug/plugin.xml#L57-235"" rel=""nofollow"">plugin.xml defines that .coffee file can be launched </a>, I noticed that I am actually using the same <code>&lt;configurationType
                id= ""org.nodeclipse.debug.launch.LaunchConfigurationType"" &gt;</code> in all 5 cases. However adding unique LaunchConfigurationType id for every launch makes no difference.</p>

My login is done via the root which stores a session cookie. The cookie is stored for all subdomains with the path ""/"".</p>

<p>Directly on the api I can get the cookie. However on the same url but via an ajax GET call from the front-end the cookie is NULL.</p>

<p>But using an application like Postman (chrome app) a GET request to the same URL and I can get the cookie. So it seems to be specific to my apps frontend.</p>

<p>Here are my settings for my angular app. I've set these defaults in my app config:</p>

<pre><code>$httpProvider.defaults.useXDomain = true;
$httpProvider.defaults.withCredentials = true;
delete $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With'];
</code></pre>

<p>I've tested on both Chrome and FF. Can't figure out why my cookies/sessions are unavailable between my frontend and backend</p>

<p><strong>Update 20/11/2013</strong></p>

<p>I also had a problem specifically with the version Angular I was using. Because I was using <code>$resource</code> instead of just <code>$http</code>, that version of angular wasn't attaching the <code>withCredentials</code> setting to the http request when using <code>$resource</code>. Updating to the latest angularjs version has fixed my problem. Because the withCredentials was not being set my cookies weren't being sent along with the xhr request. Stupidly I hadn't checked if cookies were being sent.</p>

app.use(function(req, res, next) {

  res.send('error');
});

var server = app.listen(3001, function() {
    console.log('Listening on port %d', server.address().port);
});
</code></pre>

<p>domain1.js:</p>

<pre><code>var express   = require('express');
var router    = express.Router();

router.get('/', function(req, res) {

<p>1) I can put the BroadcastReceiver in the same class as the activity and call the updateUI function after certain activity</p>

<p>2) Create a ContentObserver?</p>

<p>3) Communicate to a service created by the activity, use aidl. (I dont know how to get the current service if its registered from an activity)</p>

<p>4) Create a custom filter on the broadcastReceiver located on the same class as the activity, and use context.sendBroadcast(msg of custom filter) and in the custom filter call updateUI (same as one but more generic?)</p>

<p>The final flow is it would come from a BroadcastReceiver and ends up updating the UI without renewing the activity (unless the activity is dead?) </p>

</code></pre>

<p>I am catching local1 messages from Solr's logj4 and redirecting them to /var/log/remote.log
Everything works as expected. Sample INFO message</p>

<pre><code>Oct 31 13:57:08 hostname.here 3431839 [http-8080-10] java INFO  org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore  [collection1] webapp=/solr path=/select params={indent=true&amp;q=*:*&amp;wt=json&amp;rows=1} hits=42917 status=0 QTime=1
</code></pre>

<p>And stack traces are on the same line as the ERROR message</p>

<pre><code>Oct 31 12:27:17 hostname.here 157666248 [http-8080-7] java ERROR org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore  org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: undefined field *#012#011at org.apache.solr.schema.IndexSchema.getDynamicFieldType(IndexSchema.java:1223)#012... Cut for brevity....#011at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:724)#012
</code></pre>

<p>Note #012 as line ending and #011 tab. </p>

<p>Using this setup I can ship the logs to remote rsyslog server over TCP and pipe them into fluentd/elaticsearch/kibana etc... everything works as expected. </p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong> 
I am now trying to get another webapp running inside the same tomcat container to log as above, everything works as expected apart from stack traces, each line of a stack trace ends up on a separate line (separate syslog message)</p>

<pre><code>Oct 31 12:54:47  hostname.here 4909 [main] java ERROR org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaUpdate  could not get database metadata

</code></pre>

<p>The webapp ships with it's own log4j libs and log4j.xml config. Libs are of the same version as those used by solr.  </p>

<p>log4j.xml file for this app</p>

<pre><code> &lt;appender name=""SYSLOG"" class=""org.apache.log4j.net.SyslogAppender""&gt;
                &lt;param name=""SyslogHost"" value=""localhost"" /&gt;

                &lt;/layout&gt;
                &lt;/appender&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to see stack traces from the new application to appear on the same line just like with Solr. </p>

<p>Does anyone know if this is a log4j config issue?</p>

<p>Many thanks. </p>

<p>How do i get the image taken in the above class and transfer it to my new activity?</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT SOLUTION OF MY OWN :</em></strong></p>

<p>I remembered that i had a method that would create the directory for my image, so i knew the location. Only trick was to get the filepath. And because the method getOutputMediaFile was saved in a File I just had to getAbsolutePath() and sent it with the intent :</p>

<pre><code>String filepath = pictureFile.getAbsolutePath();
Intent edit = new Intent(TakePhoto.this, EditPhoto.class);
                    edit.putExtra(""filepath"", filepath);
                    startActivity(edit);
                    finish();
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the other activity i just get it like this and display it:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.bijsnijden);

        Intent myIntent = getIntent();
        imagePath = myIntent.getStringExtra(""filepath"");
        documentType = myIntent.getStringExtra(""documentType"");
        ImageView imageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.Image);
        imageView.setImageBitmap(BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imagePath));
    }

<p>}</p>

<p>Now, I'd like to add a comment for this post. I suppose the best way of storing comments is smth like:</p>

<pre><code>{
""topic"": ""Post Topic"",
""post"": ""&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tPost text&lt;/p&gt;\r\n"",
""time_added"": 1343167025,

    },
    {
        ""author"":""Jimmy White"",
        ""comment"":""And this is my comment""
    }
]
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've read some docs for Mongo, however I could'n find a proper way of adding new comments. This is how I'm doing now:</p>

<pre><code>exports.post = function(req, res) {
if (req.currentUser) {
    db.collection(""posts"", function (err, collection) {
        var obj_id = BSON.ObjectID.createFromHexString(req.params.id);
        console.log(obj_id);
        collection.findAndModify(
            {_id: obj_id}, // query for a post
            {$push: {
                comments: [ {author: req.body.comment, name: ""testname"" } ]
                }
            },
            function(err, object) {
                if (err){
                    console.warn(err.message);
                }else{
                    res.redirect('/');
                }
            });
    });
} else {
    res.redirect('/');
}
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>It returns me such error:</p>

<pre><code>exception: must specify remove or update
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>P.S. BTW, I think it would be nice to mark separate comments with any unique id or smth like  that. How can I specify Mongo to add an obj_id parameter for every adding comment? Thanks in advance.</p>

<ul>
<li>User clicks some link triggering navigation</li>
<li>Data needs to be fetched to render the view</li>
<li>UI design requires a ""loading"" spinner to be shown while data is fetched</li>
<li>Once the data is fetched we show the rendered view</li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried both of the following implementation patterns:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Router handles fetching</p>

<ul>
<li>Router tells the container view to show the loading spinner</li>
<li>Router loads any collections/models</li>
<li>Router tells the container view to hide the loading spinner</li>
<li>Router passes the collections/models to the view and renders it</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>View handles fetching</p>

<ul>
<li>Router just creates and renders the view</li>
<li>The view fetches the collections and models it needs</li>
<li>When the view is first rendered, it just shows the loading spinner since the data is still loading</li>
<li>When the data arrives, the models/collections fire events and the view is bound to those so it re-renders itself, thus hiding the loading spinner and showing the full view</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I dislike #1 since the router becomes a gigantic ball of Model/Collection fetching logic and seems to have too much responsibility. #2 seems like a better allocation of responsibilities (router just decides which view to show, view figures out what data it needs to fetch), but it does make the view rendering a little trickier since it's stateful now.</p>

<p>What does the StackOverflow community think? 1, 2, or something else?</p>

<p>the array size that I get is not bmp.Width * bmp.Height * 4. I mean, 1 pixel is 4 bytes, and there are bmp.Width * bmp.Height pixels in a bitmap. <strong>In fact each one of these 3 methods gives different results. So how do I get a byte array of size bmp.Width * bmp.Heigh * 4 from a Bitmap?</strong></p>

<p>I want to get a byte array of exactly that size because I want to use it to process the image itself, otherwise, if I don't know the bounds, I get an out of bounds exception.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to get all the arguments passed to, or expected my function. The args() command seems to be ideal but is only available for procedures. Is there anyway of doing this.</p>

<p>My reason I want to do this is so I can do my checking in fewer lines. ie check all inputs are numeric by writing one check then executing for all args. So if there is a good alternative I'm open to ideas.</p>

<p>As an example, the last table shows that the tag with id = 1 is linked with the image with id = 4.</p>

<p>I've got two questions, one pretty simple (I think!), and one more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Simple question</strong></p>

<p>Given a place_id, how can I list all the tags that have image in that place_id? An example would be:</p>

<p>Given place_id = 7, return tagA, tagB.</p>

<p><strong>Hard question</strong></p>

<p>What I'd like to do is to select all the images with a certain place_id, and associate each image with a list of tags like so:</p>

<p>Select all with place_id = 4, whilst joining to tags info.</p>

<pre><code> filename |    tags    
-----------------------
  abc.jpg | tagA       
  ghi.jpg | tagA, tagB 
</code></pre>

<p>Would this be better to do in PHP by performing multiple queries, or can I do this using MYSQL?</p>

<p>I also have <code>Class2</code> which contains a private instance of <code>Class1</code>. And I want to make property <code>age</code> available from <code>Class1</code> and still be bindable.</p>

<pre><code>public class Class2 {
  private var c1:Class1 = new Class1();

  [Bindable????]
  public function get age():int {
  }

<p>Of course the <code>[Bindable]</code> tag there doesn't make sense. But how can I achieve the same effect? </p>

<p>I believe I can dispatch some sort of <code>ageChanged</code> event from <code>Class2</code> up to <code>Class1</code> and then have an event handler in <code>Class1</code> dispatch another local <code>ageChanged</code> event to which I bind <code>Class2</code>'s <code>age</code> property. </p>

<p>But this sounds unnecessarily complicated. Isn't there a simpler way? :)</p>

From what I'm seeing, and based on <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/Log4net_Tutorial.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>, the filters are ORed together.  How can I AND the log4net filters together?  Here's an example of what I'm doing:</p>

Included in these settings are <code>System.Drawing.Point</code>, <code>System.Drawing.Location</code>, <code>System.TimeSpan</code>, <code>System.DateTime</code>, etc...</p>

<p>When I bind a form's <code>Location</code> to a <code>System.Drawing.Location</code>, and call the <code>.Save()</code> method, it all seems to work fine. That is, since there doesn't seem to be a need for a cast, the form's <code>System.Drawing.Location</code> is directly compatible with the <code>System.Drawing.Location</code> setting stored in the .settings file.
Additionally, if I say <code>TimeSpan timeSpan = Settings.Duration;</code> that also works fine.</p>

<p>Now, I have made a large settings form, where the user can adjust various parameters, including the various <code>DateTime</code> and <code>TimeSpan</code> settings. These are visible and editable in many <code>TextBox</code>, which I have data bound in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>Settings DefaultSettings = Settings.Default;
TextBox1.DataBindings.Add((""Text"", DefaultSettings, ""Duration"", false, DataSourceUpdateMode.OnValidation, new TimeSpan(00, 30, 00));
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>TimeSpan</code> is visible in the <code>TextBox</code>, however when I try to edit it and call <code>Save()</code> on the settings data source, I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Value of '0' is not valid for 'Value'. 'Value' should be between 'Minimum' and 'Maximum'.
  Parameter name: Value</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The error originates from the Visual Studio generated code block:</p>

<pre><code>[global::System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute()]
[global::System.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute()]
[global::System.Configuration.DefaultSettingValueAttribute(""00:30:00"")]
public global::System.TimeSpan StartWorkDay {
  get {
    return ((global::System.TimeSpan)(this[""Duration""]));
  }
  set {
    this[""Duration""] = value;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think the problem is caused by the fact that it's trying to turn a string into a <code>System.TimeSpan</code>, and the various other classes I have in my .settings file.</p>

<p>Since I'm binding them using the <code>DataBindings.Add(</code> which accepts strings for the parameters, I can't cast or use the new keyword there.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> handle it all manually in code: updating the settings file by constructing the objects parameter-by-parameter, but I have so many settings stored in so many TextBoxes and NumericUpDowns that I would prefer to just bind them straight to the <code>TextBox</code>, assuming that's possible.</p>

<p>What is the easiest way I can achieve this?</p>

<p>I do the following steps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Compile projects into a folder each outside the project directory</li>
<li>zip every compiled project</li>
</ul>

<p>here are my targets</p>

<p>first one to compile</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Target Name=""BuildProjects""  DependsOnTargets=""BeforeBuild""&gt;

    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;      
  &lt;BuildProjectFiles Include=""**\MyCompany.Project1\MyCompany.Project1.csproj"" /&gt;
  &lt;BuildProjectFiles Include=""**\MyCompany.Project2\MyCompany.Project2.csproj"" /&gt;
  &lt;BuildProjectFiles Include=""**\MyCompany.Project2\MyCompany.Project2-CE.csproj"" /&gt;
      ... and some more
    &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

    &lt;MSBuild Projects=""@(BuildProjectFiles)"" Properties=""AllowUnsafeBlocks=true;Configuration=$(Configuration);OutputPath=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\Deploy\bin\%(BuildProjectFiles.FileName)""&gt;
        &lt;Output TaskParameter=""TargetOutputs""
                ItemName=""BuildProjectsOutputFiles"" /&gt;
    &lt;/MSBuild&gt;

&lt;/Target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and now the target to zip every compiled project to its one file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Target Name=""ZipProjects"" DependsOnTargets=""BuildProjects""&gt;

    &lt;CreateItem
        Include=""@(BuildProjectOutputFiles)""
            AdditionalMetadata=""AssemblyName=%(Filename);ProjectName=%(RelativeDir)""&gt;
        &lt;Output TaskParameter=""Include"" ItemName=""BuildProjectsOutputFiles123""/&gt;
    &lt;/CreateItem&gt;

    &lt;CreateItem Include=""%(BuildProjectsOutputFiles123.RelativeDir)*"" AdditionalMetadata=""OutputFileName=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\Deploy\dist\$(Configuration)\%(BuildProjectsOutputFiles123.AssemblyName)-$(MajorNumber).$(MinorNumber).$(ReleaseNumber).zip;WorkingDirectory=%(BuildProjectsOutputFiles123.RelativeDir)""&gt;
        &lt;Output TaskParameter=""Include"" ItemName=""BuildProjectsOutputFiles456""/&gt;
    &lt;/CreateItem&gt;

    &lt;Zip Files=""@(BuildProjectsOutputFiles456)""
        WorkingDirectory=""%(BuildProjectsOutputFiles456.WorkingDirectory)"" 
        ZipFileName=""%(BuildProjectOutputFiles456.OutputFileName)""  /&gt;
        &lt;!-- ZipLevel=""9""/&gt; --&gt;

&lt;/Target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So what happens is that every project I specified in <code>BuildProjectFiles</code> gets compiled into the folder <code>&lt;rootdir&gt;\deploy\bin\&lt;name of the csproj file without extension\</code></p>

<p>In the second step I use the <code>MSBuild.Community.Tasks</code> Zip-Task to zip every project and copy it to <code>&lt;rootdir&gt;\deploy\dist\release\&lt;assemblyname&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.zip</code></p>

<p>So basically the assembly <code>project1.exe</code> and its dependencies are in the file <code>project1-2.4.7.zip</code> after executing msbuild.</p>

<p>That works very well. But now I have a change that I can't figure out how solve. I have two assemblys with the same assembly name (one for Windows and the other for Windows CE) so the first project compiles and creates a folder <code>project2-2.4.7.zip</code> and then the next project compiles and overwrites the zip file.</p>

<p>Now I want the Zip-File to be named after the <code>.csproj</code> file (like the bin folder).
Since my one project file is called <code>mycompany.project2.csproj</code> and the other one <code>mycompany.project2-ce.csproj</code> I should be fine.</p>

<p>In short: How can I pass the project name to the zip target?</p>

Putting a string array into a Spinner is very simple, therefore, I figured doing the same with a List would also be simple. At this time however I can not figure out how to get the List into the proper format for use with the Spinner's ArrayAdapter.</p>

<p>Here's my code for grabbing a list of account names from the database:</p>

<pre><code>//---retrieves all the accounts matching the account_type---
    public List getAccounts(String account_type) {

                ID,
                ACCOUNTTYPE,
                ACCOUNTNUMBER,
                ACCOUNTNAME},
                ACCOUNTTYPE + "" = "" + ""'"" + account_type + ""'"",

        if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {
           do {
              //---account_name column number is 3--- 
              list.add(cursor.getString(3));
           } while (cursor.moveToNext());
        }
        if (cursor != null &amp;&amp; !cursor.isClosed()) {
           cursor.close();
        }

        return list;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>From the returned ""list"", what do I need to do to populate my spinner? The following code is obviously for a string array, however, I am lost as to what I need to do to make a List work with similar functionality. Here's my non-working ArrayAdapter code (account_name_array is set to be the returned ""list"" from above):</p>

<pre><code>account_name_spinner = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.account_name_spinner);      
account_name_adapter = new ArrayAdapter&lt;String&gt;(this, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, account_name_array);
account_name_adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item);
account_name_spinner.setAdapter(account_name_adapter);
</code></pre>

<p>I know I am way off track here, I know that ArrayAdapter is expecting a string array, however, like I said, I need a good push in the right direction. Obviously I need to either convert my List into a string array, or change the way I am adapting the Spinner to the List. Android has been quite difficult for me to grasp, there are a lot of data structures and much more data type rules than I am use to coming from a PHP background.</p>

I have a base class from which I derive multiple subclasses.<br>
Each subclass defines class constants, and I wish to enforce certain limitations on them.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Base(object):
    # define these in your sub-class, and make sure (NOM % DENOM == 0)
    NOMINATOR = None
    DENOMINATOR = None

class Subclass_good(Base):
    NOMINATOR = 6
    DENOMINATOR = 3

class Subclass_bad(Base):
    NOMINATOR = 7
    DENOMINATOR = 5
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to enforce the rule (NOM % DENOM == 0).<br>
I currently do this with a class decorator:</p>

<pre><code>def nom_denom_validator(cls):
    assert(cls.NOMINATOR % cls.DENOMINATOR == 0)
    return cls

# and decorate each subclass, e.g.:
@nom_denom_validator
class Subclass_another(Base):
    NOMINATOR = 9
    DENOMINATOR = 12
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't like the fact that I need to decorate each subclass (I have plenty). I'm interested whether this can be done by some manipulation on the Base class directly.</p>

<p>I want to write a macro that expands to this statement, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>MYMACRO(long[2], {1, 2})

<p>Unfortunately, the preprocessor is not aware of brace-matching so it sees three arguments (the second and third are <code>{1</code> and <code>2}</code>, respectively).</p>

<p>This is a known limitation of the preprocessor, and the simplest solution is often to add extra parentheses, if possible, in the macro invocation.</p>

<p>But, in this case, placing the brace-enclosed initializer inside parentheses appears to change its meaning:</p>

<pre><code>literal&lt;long[2]&gt;(({1, 2}));

(g++ 4.8) error: left operand of comma operator has no effect [-Werror=unused-value]

<p>Is this a GCC bug or correct by design?  Is there any way to accomplish what I want?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I probably should have been more clear in the phrasing of the original questions.  The preprocessor hasn't changed in forever (even variadic macros have been a GCC extension for a long time).  The practical workarounds in this case are useful, but they're also very well known and not to the point I want to get at.</p>

<p>I really want to know whether anything was added to C++11 to specifically address this issue (or was it an oversight?).  The quirky handling of braces in macro invocations seems like a much bigger issue now, given the greatly expanded use of brace-enclosed lists throughout the language.</p>

<p>I'm especially annoyed by the fact that putting parentheses around a brace-enclosed initializer list changes the way it's parsed when used as a function parameter.  Is there any other parameter to a function invocation that cannot be parenthesized?  It seems like special-case hell when writing macros that pass parameters to functions.</p>

<p>I'm really hoping somebody can point out that this is a GCC bug, or explain why putting parentheses around a brace-enclosed initializer list <strong>must</strong> change its meaning.</p>

<p>Here is code:</p>

<pre><code>SpriteBatch sb;
BitmapFont font;

sb = new SpriteBatch();
font = new BitmapFont(Gdx.files.internal(""fonts/Hyperspace_Bold.ttf""), true);

sb.setColor(1,1,1,1);
sb.begin();
    font.draw(sb, Long.toString(player.getScore()), 40, 390);
sb.end();
</code></pre>

<p>I've created a folder in my assets folder called fonts fyi.
P.S. players score is just 0</p>

<p>EDIT: the sb.setColor and everything preceding is in its own render method but i just put it here for simplicity purposes. The purpose of this post is that I'm not sure HOW to use a ttf font type and display it in the latest version of libGDX.</p>

However we have launched a separate forum app, which is in a sub-domain and I'd like to offer the same functionality there as well.</p>

<p>I have set up jQuery UI on the forum, and the demo code (where the data is present inline) works fine. However when I switch the source to my rails app <code>mysite.com/products/names</code> Chrome reports that the request was cancelled - this is of course because of cross-site requests, meaning I have to either JSONP or set up Cross-origin resource sharing.</p>

<p>After chatting in the Rails IRC Chat room, it is suggested I use CORS, so this is the option I am opting for.</p>

<p>I have added this to my application controller:</p>

<pre><code>before_action :allow_cross_domain_access

def allow_cross_domain_access
  if request.headers[""HTTP_ORIGIN""]
  # better way check origin
  # if request.headers[""HTTP_ORIGIN""] &amp;&amp; /^https?:\/\/(.*)\.some\.site\.com$/i.match(request.headers[""HTTP_ORIGIN""])
    headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'
    headers['Access-Control-Expose-Headers'] = 'ETag'
    headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD'
    headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = '*,x-requested-with,Content-Type,If-Modified-Since,If-None-Match,Auth-User-Token'
    headers['Access-Control-Max-Age'] = '86400'
    headers['Access-Control-Allow-Credentials'] = 'true'
  end
end 
</code></pre>

<p>And I have this as a starting point for the js:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    url = ""http://www.mysite.com/products/names""
    $( ""#search_bar"" ).autocomplete(
    {
        crossDomain: true,
        type: ""GET"",
        dataType: ""json"",
        source: url,

    })
});
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas where I need to go from here? For reference, here is the JSONP demo code from the docs:<br>
<a href=""http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp</a></p>

<pre><code>  &lt;script&gt;
  $(function() {
    function log( message ) {
      $( ""&lt;div&gt;"" ).text( message ).prependTo( ""#log"" );
      $( ""#log"" ).scrollTop( 0 );
    }

    $( ""#city"" ).autocomplete({
      source: function( request, response ) {
        $.ajax({
          url: ""http://ws.geonames.org/searchJSON"",
          dataType: ""jsonp"",
          data: {
            featureClass: ""P"",
            style: ""full"",
            maxRows: 12,
            name_startsWith: request.term
          },
          success: function( data ) {
            response( $.map( data.geonames, function( item ) {
              return {
                label: item.name + (item.adminName1 ? "", "" + item.adminName1 : """") + "", "" + item.countryName,
                value: item.name
              }
            }));
          }
        });
      },
      minLength: 2,
      select: function( event, ui ) {
        log( ui.item ?

      },
      open: function() {

      },
      close: function() {
        $( this ).removeClass( ""ui-corner-top"" ).addClass( ""ui-corner-all"" );
      }
    });
  });
  &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas how I can adapt this to work with CORS please?</p>

<p>EDIT: What I've tried...</p>

<p>(1) Attempt using JSONP (not sure how to do it with CORS). This was giving me a <code>500 Internal Server Error</code> until I changed <code>name_startsWith</code> to <code>term</code>. Now looking at the response via Chrome's network tab in the developer tools, I am getting my suggestions come through ok in the response (eg: <code>[""name1"", ""name2"", ""name3""]</code>, and under the preview tab show as:</p>

<pre><code>0: ""name1""
1: ""name2""
2: ""name3""
</code></pre>

<p>I guess I need to adjust <code>success</code> to get these to show as suggestions in the search bar:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;script&gt;
  $(function() {
    $( ""#search_bar"" ).autocomplete({
      source: function( request, response ) {
        $.ajax({
          url: ""http://www.mysite.com/products/names?jsonp_callback=?"",
          dataType: ""jsonp"",

<p>Here is the coffeescript I am using in my Rails app:</p>

<pre><code>initialize = -&gt;
  $('#search_bar').autocomplete
    source: $('#search_bar').data('autocomplete-source')
    select: (event, ui) -&gt;
      $(this).parents(""form"").submit()
    focus: (event, ui) -&gt;
       $('#search_bar').val(ui.item.value)

$(document).ready initialize
</code></pre>

<p>And this is it converted to JS:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function() {
  return $('#search_bar').autocomplete({
    source: $('#search_bar').data('autocomplete-source'),
    select: function(event, ui) {
      return $(this).parents(""form"").submit();
    },
    focus: function(event, ui) {
      return $('#search_bar').val(ui.item.value);
    }
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally I'd like it to perform in the same way as it does in the parent app. Any ideas where I need to go from here?</p>

<p>Basically, this is my html setup :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""main-div""&gt;&lt;!-- Blue --&gt;
     &lt;div id=""sub-div""&gt;&lt;!-- Red --&gt;
       &lt;div class=""content-div""&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is the text. I need the button to be placed in content-div, which technically is, but it appers outside the div.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;a href=""#"" class=""button-green""&gt;BUTTON&lt;/a&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the fiddle with the CSS classes :
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/03knuf7z/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/03knuf7z/1/</a></p>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve is to have the <code>&lt;p&gt; paragraph</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt; button</code> both inside the <code>sub-div</code> surrounded by <code>main-div</code></p>

<p>I've been trying to achieve this without a fixed <code>content-div</code> height, so I'm trying to put in <code>height: auto;</code> into my css hoping the <code>content-div</code> will stretch enough to cover both <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, but that doesn't do the job, because the button still appears outside the <code>content-div</code> box, just like in the fiddle.</p>

<p>I can achieve the desired result by putting fixed height to the <code>content-div</code>, so if I'll change the <code>auto</code> in <code>height: auto;</code> to <code>height: 150px;</code>, it works and both elements, the paragraph and the button are in the box.</p>

<p>But thinking of responsivity on small screen devices, phone screens for example, I'd like to avoid fixed values.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this without fixed height ?  </p>

<p>For this I have configured datasource connection pool in spring-xd-1.0.0.RELEASE\xd\config\servers.yml like:</p>

<p>spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spring_xd
    username: springxd
    password: springxd
    driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

    initialSize: 10
    maxWait: 30000
    validationQuery: select 1
    validationInterval: 30000
    testOnBorrow: true
    testOnReturn: false
    testWhileIdle: false
    timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis: 10000
    minEvictableIdleTimeMillis: 60000
    removeAbandoned: true
    removeAbandonedTimeout: 300
    logAbandoned: true</p>

<p>When singlenode starts spring xd is initializing this pool.</p>

<p>But the problem is that, when the filejdbc job launches its once again initializing a connection pool with the above configs. Since \spring-xd-1.0.0.RELEASE\xd\config\modules\job\filejdbc\filejdbc.properties is using the same connection pool configs from servers.yml</p>

<p>The csv files data are loaded to the DB only using the filejdbc connectionpool and not the spring xd.</p>

<p>Because of this my db connections are running out. </p>

<p>Now, when I reduce the connection in servers.yml to max active 20, and when a job launches, spring xd is throwing connection pool exhaust exception, since i have 50 csv files to load. </p>

<p>I simply can't configure the servers.xml max active to 10 for the spring xd database and filejdbc maxactive to 60 for my custom database, so that 50 files can be loaded when the filejdbc job launches. This always throws connection exhaust exception.</p>

<p>Please advise.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've tried my hand at generating a post request with Json in Ruby.</p>

<p>There are 2 parts to be aware of, The active resource on client side and the controller handling the incoming request. The errors usually come down to 406 (request not acceptable) or 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
I suppose the basic question is how can I fix these?</p>

<p>Here is my active resource class.</p>

<pre><code>class UserRequest &lt; ActiveResource::Base
  self.site = ""http://localhost:3008""
  self.format = :json
  #do not define defs as 'self'.whatever


  def post_me
    res = Net::HTTP.post_form(URI.parse('http://127.0.0.1:3008/user_requests.xml'),
                              {'url' =&gt;'www.stackoverflow.com', 'depth' =&gt; '50'})
  end
end
#Just to clarify. If im sending Json, I change the URI to .json and If I'm using xml, I   #remove the self.format because active resource is XML by default
</code></pre>

<p>and here is line in controller which turns it to active record. controllers titled UserRequestsController</p>

<pre><code>def add_request
    @user_request = UserRequest.new(params[:user_request])
.
.
. end
</code></pre>

<p>route is </p>

<pre><code> match '/user_requests(.:format)' =&gt; 'user_requests#add_request', :via =&gt;:post
</code></pre>

<p>Now a few things before everyone face palms and goes mad at me.</p>

<p>I'm aware that in the def for add_request I'm missing JSON.parse. This is because when I include it I get  500 and an uninitialized constant error on server side. The gem is definitely installed and I'm not the only one whos had the problem but sadly no fixes.</p>

http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=28301</p>

<p>So theres one question is how do i fix the parse so that it works the way I want to as I'm assuming the 406 is because its receiving Json but not sending it.
This would be ideal however if its not possible or someone can think of a reason why I should use XML, then perhaps they could take a look at this and tell me why I might be getting it on server side</p>

<pre><code>Started POST ""/user_requests.xml"" for 127.0.0.1 at Thu Jul 14 09:38:34 +0100 2011

<p>Just one last thing is the reasoin I'm not using .save is because the lead on my intern program doesn't like and says its not fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java EE Server (JBoss 7.2) with Apache CXF as JAX-WS implementation.</li>
<li>ServiceA (Service Endpoint) and ServiceB (extends Service A and also Service Endpoint)</li>
<li>Three Persistence Projects: Common, PersistenceA depends Common, PersistenceB depends PersistenceA.</li>
<li>There is a Class <code>UUIDIdentified</code> that is Superclass of all persistence Classes (It provides the JPA <code>@ID</code>) it is in Projekt Common</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the ServiceA Class is an Method: <code>public List&lt;DTO&gt; getData(UUIDIdentified value);</code> </p>

<p>The Server reads some Objects that are all subtypes of UUIDIdentified, and the goal is to pack the Objects in DTOs.</p>

<p>A DTO would look like:</p>

<pre><code>@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class DTO{

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

@XmlElement(name = ""uuididentified"")
UUIDIdentified object;

public UUIDIdentified getObject() {
    return object;
}

public void setObject(final UUIDIdentified object) {
    this.object = object;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>If i look into the SOAP response, I see that there is no Data in the <code>&lt;uuididentified&gt;</code> tag. My understanding of JAXB isnt so well, but as I understand the ""real"" instances of the UUIDIdentified and their types are unknown to the JAXBContext. </p>

<p>I could solve this by adding <code>@XmlSeeAlso({TypeA.class,TypeB.class})</code> to the <code>UUIDIdentified</code> class (I reckon). But that is what I cant because if i would do so, the Project Common would depend on Projects PersistenceA/B.</p>

<p>How can I solve this. How can I say to JAXB(Maybe in a xml config file) that it have to add ClassA/B to the JAXBContext as it adds UUIDIdentified?</p>

<p>I tried some things like jaxb.index files, ObjectFactorys, @XmlSeeAlso on the SEI but I dont know if that is the right way. </p>

<p>I've noticed that removing the StreamWriter leads to no file being created at all but no exceptions. Removing the file name causes an exception from within log4net. I have tried using both MaxFileSize and MaximumFileSize to no avail as well as changing the rolling stile to Date and Composite. Additionally if the writer stream is malformed it will create the same exception as not including the File property ({""Value cannot be null.\r\nParameter name: fileName""}{System.ArgumentNullException}).</p>

W.Data()$Visit.Date&lt;-as.Date(W.Data()$Visit.Date,""%m/%d/%Y"")   
</code></pre>

<p>When i run this I get</p>

<pre><code>Error in W.Data()$VisitDate &lt;- as.Date(W.Data()$VisitDate, ""%m/%d/%Y""):
invalid (NULL) left side of assignment
</code></pre>

<p>and similar for the other line. What is going on here? Can I do these sort of things with a <code>data.frame</code> that is read from <code>reactiveFileInput</code>? I tried changing the names  in the underlying .csv file to have underscores rather than spaces, and I tried putting the <code>names()</code> and <code>as.Date()</code> in <code>reactive()</code> expressions, but these made no difference.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

Sadly it's not working out of the box. In fact, it does not start up at all.</p>

<p>My setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>MacVim (32bit <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/8028410/1185999"">cause of this</a>) (vim 7.3)</li>
<li><strong>:scriptnames</strong> does not list <code>ftplugin/slimv.vim</code> while <code>plugin/paredit.vim</code> is listed</li>
<li><strong>:set ft?</strong> shows <code>filetype=lisp</code> for .lisp files</li>
<li><strong>:messages</strong> shows no errors</li>
<li><strong>:filetype</strong> <code>filetype detection:ON  plugin:ON  indent:ON</code></li>
<li><strong>:echo g:paredit_loaded</strong> <code>1</code></li>
<li><strong>:echo g:slimv_loaded</strong> <code>E121: Undefined variable: g:slimv_loaded \ E15: Invalid expression: g:slimv_loaded</code></li>
<li>compiled with +python (2.7)</li>
</ul>

<p>SBCL and slime are installed - works flawless with emacs.
I tried it with and without <code>let g:slimv_swank_cmd = ...</code> in .vimrc and changed the line recommended on the plugin page from</p>

<pre><code>let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '!osascript -e ""tell application \""Terminal\"" to do script \""sbcl --load ~/.vim/slime/start-swank.lisp\""""'

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '!sh -c ""sbcl --load /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/slime/start-swank.lisp"" &amp;'
</code></pre>

<p>since the osascript was not working and I don't know how to fix it. But a similar call to xterm is sufficient for Linux so my sh call should be fine.
Well, I got no idea what to try next. :/</p>

<p><strong>The problem got solved</strong> by installing slimv to ~/.vim instead of the vim ebedded in MacVim. Maybe some kind of bug? However, Common Lisp + vim - I just love it.</p>

In our gwt with mvp4g app we have pretty complicated flow of events in eventbus. One event like LOGIN produces multiple others as a reaction from presenters/handlers. Currently we have great difficulties with understanding how events interrelated i.e. which events must follow this particular one.<br>
We have tests for presenters and views, but we are lacking tests which would clearly show/model event flows, preferably without usage of real views and services.</p>

<p><strong>Short description:</strong>
New tests on eventBus(?) should be developed which should clearly describe and test event flows.</p>

<p>I have few rud ideas but they all sounds not satisfactory:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write custom implementation(could be ugly) of mvp4g eventbus and:</p>

<ul>
<li>use real presenters</li>
<li>use mock(?) views</li>
<li>mock services</li>
<li>verify all produced service calls</li>
<li><strong>Why not cool</strong>: <strong>(a)</strong> In this case test would not verify produced events directly but only that ones which have services. <strong>(b)</strong>
EventBus implementation would look rather scarry - it must create each presenter with mocked services and views</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Find a way to use some magical mvp4g mechanism to create eventBus in test and mock vies, services. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why not cool</strong> : same as prev - only indirect verification through services is possible, and I cannot find how to create eventBus manually and solve all problems with GIN, inter GWT module dependencies and so. I guess there is no simple way to do it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there any general solution for problem of tracking event tree in tests? Guess I'm not the first person to stare at complicated eventbus event flows.</p>

<p>What I expected is, after I set *stop = YES the block stop his loop. But this isn't happening. The block jump to another sentence, but doesn't stop. If the string has line breaks (\n) in the end of the sentences, the block stop as I expected (with the same code). But when string has line breaks, the block causes memory leaks.</p>

<p>Anyone have any idea what's happening and what I can try to block work has I expected?</p>

<p>The method of string enumerateSubstringsInRange:options:usingBlock: does not resolve my problem in my actual solution... I'd like to use NSLinguisticTagger...</p>

I can open and close the side menu simply by toggling the <code>open</code> class on container, affecting both child elements in my CSS.

<p>I have this implemented and it works well. Now let's introduce some responsive design to my <code>.content</code> class. I want my media queries to target when the <strong>div.content's width is greater than 1000px</strong>, so I'll need to account for whether or not the side menu is open.</p>

<pre><code>.container {

<p>I would like to display additional fields, so I go to <strong>VIEW SETTINGS</strong> --> <strong>COLUMNS</strong> --> <strong>ALL CONTACT FIELDS</strong> from the drop-down and it doesn't matter what columns I choose from the list, when I go back to the main ListView, I see the columns I picked displayed next to the other columns, but they do not show any values, i.e. they are just blank.  <strong>Why is this?</strong>  I know that the <strong>FROM</strong> is stored as a contact in the <strong>CONTACT ADDRESS BOOK</strong>, but would like to display additional fields upon arrival of the email.</p>

<p>Do I need to add some code? Does this involve adding <code>VBA</code> snippets or <code>C#</code>? I am seeking to add additional fields to the name ListView for better filtering and categorization of the incoming emails.  Will this ""synching"" if that is what is needed, need to be done at the <code>Exchange</code> layer?  Or this solely on the client layer, i.e. <code>Outlook</code>?</p>

"25115978","1","","","2014-08-04 09:52:02","","4","418","<p>I am currently using EPPlus library to export large amounts of data to several worksheets and tables in side each of those worksheets.</p>

<p>I have been able to create list validation and have it working via a lookup worksheet named range perfectly fine. However, I have come across some strange behaviour which I have been unable to figure out.</p>

<p><strong>To begin:</strong></p>

<p>I download the file. I open the file. I select a spreadsheet with a table, there are multiple rows in the table, there is a list validation column with Options Yes/No to select from a dropdown. Each row has this list validation.</p>

<p>Scenario 1:</p>

<p>I then create a new row in the excel table, by dragging from the bottom right corner of the excel table to create the new row. The formula was not copied to the new row. I have now lost the validation for a new row in my excel table.</p>

<p>Scenario 2:</p>

<p>I delete all existing rows in the excel table, except for the first row (which still contains list validation in the Yes/No column). I THEN create a new row in the excel table by dragging from the bottom right corner of the excel table to create the new row. </p>

<p>The formula IS copied to the new row, I can now insert new valid data into this row by using the provided validation.</p>

<p><strong>The logic of my code:</strong></p>

<p>Each cell has validation applied to it by a loop which gets the kind of validation the cell needs to have (i.e number, date, list, greater than, less than etc). List validation is accessed via a named table lookup address. There is NO XML output error and the file opens fine, I can access the list validation from the cells without any problem.</p>

<p><strong>Things I have tried to fix this issue:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Fill the range of cells, THEN create the excel table from this range. 
- The idea behind this is, to first have a selection of data created, then select the range and just turn it into an excel table. Default behaviour would be for new rows in a table to just copy the fomula from the row above. So this solution seems logical.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Create an excel table on a range of non-filled cells, then fill this range.
- The idea behind this is, there could have been a bug in the way EPPlus creates a table in the worksheet, or possibly there could be an issue with order of XML elements and really was simply just an experimental change.</p>

<p>The code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>   var strategy = Strategy.CreateTableFirst;
   ExcelRange subRowDataRange = null;
   ExcelTable table = null;

   if (strategy == Strategy.CreateTableFirst)
   {
       subRowDataRange = worksheet.Cells[headerRowIndex, worksheet.Dimension.Start.Column, ToRow: headerRowIndex + groupedRowData.Count(), ToCol: dataFields.Count()];
       table = worksheet.Tables.Add(subRowDataRange, Name: null); // Auto generate Excel table name
       table.TableStyle = TableStyles.Light13;  
   }

   foreach (var field in dataFields)
   {
       // Headers
       if (strategy == Strategy.CreateTableFirst)
       {
           table.Columns[dataFields.IndexOf(field)].Name = field.Name;  
       }
       else

<p>This is the output table in excel after the code:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LuG1y.png"" alt=""Excel Table with Data exported to excel""></p>

<p>The funny thing is, the cell validation is copied down to the next row fine if I create the table manually and have the first row set with the data, then drag down to make a new row and it copies over fine. I'm not sure how I am going to be able to export multiple rows of data and be assured that when a user inserts a new row, validation is copied down.</p>

<p>I downloaded the Microsoft XML SDK to compare the excel table with 1 row (which I am then able to drag down to create a second row with copied formula) and the original downloaded excel file with many rows in the excel table.</p>

<p>The results are almost identical with regards to the excel table in XML output.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/G1DNH.png"" alt=""Excel Table Comparison XML""></p>

<p>Also nothing seems out of place after deleting the rows and saving the file for comparison. </p>

<p>well, I will implement my service:</p>

<pre><code>// Implementing the service
public class MyService : IMyService {
   ...

<p>OK! Up until now, nothing strange!
My service will be hosted on a server and I am happy :)
The service is hosted (as example) on a svc file, but remember the service is <code>IMyService</code>.</p>

<p>Now let's get to the point:
In my client I would like to create a client in order to get access JUST TO A SUBSET of my service. Given that my service is the usion of three subservices, I would like to access only one subservice.</p>

<p>For example, my client is interested in <code>IMySubService1</code>
Can I do the following?</p>

<pre><code>ServiceEndpoint httpEndpoint = new ServiceEndpoint(
   ContractDescription.GetContract(typeof(IMySubService1)), 
   new BasicHttpBinding(), 
   new EndpointAddress(""http://tempuri.org/MyService.svc/ServiceCall"")
   );
ChannelFactory&lt;IMySubService1&gt; channelFactory = 
   new ChannelFactory&lt;IMySubService1&gt;(httpEndpoint);

IMySubService1svc = channelFactory.CreateChannel();
/* Calling methods in IMySubService1 */
int i1 = svc.MyOp11(""A string"");
int i2 = svc.MyOp12(""Another string"");
int i3 = svc.MyOp11(""And another string"");
int i4 = svc.MyOp12(""In the end a string"");

I created the entities using Visual studio 2008's wizard and had the connection string stored in the app.config. A client program then communicates through WCF with the database. This works well on the development computer when I host the WCF service in a console application. After hosting the service in IIS7 on the remote computer I get the error: ""The underlying provider failed on open"". It is generated the first time a read operation is attempted from the database.<p>
The autogenerated connection string is:</p>

<pre><code>     &lt;add name=""xPMDbEntities"" connectionString=""metadata=res://*/PM_EDM.csdl|
            res://*/PM_EDM.ssdl|

            providerName=""System.Data.EntityClient"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(I broke up the string in a few lines to make it more readable).</p>

<p>On the server this is not working, even if I locate the database in the exact same location as on the development computer. Does anything of the rest of the connection string, (of which I do not understand the first thing) need to be edited too? A link to a good resource about how to construct EF connection strings would be very helpful too!
<p>
EDIT:
I also added the section below to the web.config file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.data&gt;
     &lt;DbProviderFactories&gt;
       &lt;remove invariant=""System.Data.SQLite""/&gt;

     &lt;/DbProviderFactories&gt;
  &lt;/system.data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work (Thomas suggests it should be located in the machine.config file) as before I added this entry I got an error saying that System.Data.SQLite could not be found.<p></p>

<p>EDIT2:
I installed the System.Data.SQLite dll on the server rather than just xcopying the dll to the BIN directory. Both the machine.config in the Framework/Config and Framework64/Config folders now have the above DbFactory entry. It does not make a diference (unless I have to restart the server??)</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The pseudo-terminal error reminded me of the -t flag in my original command, so I switched to the second method, using a Channel. Instead of ssh.exec_command and later, I have:</p>

<pre><code>t = ssh.get_transport()
chan = t.open_session()
chan.get_pty()
print '---- send ssh cmd ----'
print chan.send('ssh luser@second.com')
print '---- recv ----'
print chan.recv(9999)
chan = t.open_session()
print '---- send password ----'
print chan.send('secret')
print '---- recv ----'
print chan.recv(9999)
</code></pre>

<p>...but it prints '---- send ssh cmd ----' and just hangs until I kill the process.</p>

<p>I'm new to Python and none too knowledgeable about networks. In the first case, why does sending the password work with <em>sudo</em> but not with <em>ssh</em>? Are the prompts different? Is paramiko even the right library for this?</p>

I'm trying to apply three transformations to the input below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sheet&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_1&gt;11&lt;/column_1&gt;
    &lt;column_2&gt;&lt;/column_2&gt;

    &lt;column_3&gt;&lt;/column_3&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/sheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>1) shift/rename columns by 4,
I was able to do that using following XSLT:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"" version=""1.0""&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match=""node() | @*""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:copy&gt;
        &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""node() | @*""/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:copy&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match=""row/*""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:element name=""column_{substring(name(),8,string-length(name())-7)+4}""&gt;
        &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""@* | node()"" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:element&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>output received:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sheet&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;11&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/sheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2) add elements before already existing ones so below output is received:
I have to say I'm lost here as have no ideas how to make it work.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sheet&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_1&gt;&lt;/column_1&gt;
    &lt;column_2&gt;&lt;/column_2&gt;
    &lt;column_3&gt;&lt;/column_3&gt;
    &lt;column_4&gt;&lt;/column_4&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;11&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_1&gt;&lt;/column_1&gt;
    &lt;column_2&gt;&lt;/column_2&gt;
    &lt;column_3&gt;&lt;/column_3&gt;
    &lt;column_4&gt;&lt;/column_4&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_1&gt;&lt;/column_1&gt;
    &lt;column_2&gt;&lt;/column_2&gt;
    &lt;column_3&gt;&lt;/column_3&gt;
    &lt;column_4&gt;&lt;/column_4&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/sheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>3) incorporate following XSLT I was using to propagate data, it works if its applied on its own but when merged with point 1) i got no result only pint 1 is being applied</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"" version=""1.0""&gt;
&lt;xsl:output indent=""yes""/&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match=""node() | @*""&gt;
&lt;xsl:copy&gt;
  &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""node() | @*""/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:copy&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match=""column_5""&gt;
&lt;xsl:copy&gt;
  &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:when test="".=''""&gt;
      &lt;xsl:value-of select=""preceding::column_5[. != ''][1]""/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
    &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""node() | @*""/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
&lt;/xsl:copy&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My expected result would be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sheet&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_1&gt;&lt;/column_1&gt;
    &lt;column_2&gt;&lt;/column_2&gt;
    &lt;column_3&gt;&lt;/column_3&gt;
    &lt;column_4&gt;&lt;/column_4&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;11&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_1&gt;&lt;/column_1&gt;
    &lt;column_2&gt;&lt;/column_2&gt;
    &lt;column_3&gt;&lt;/column_3&gt;
    &lt;column_4&gt;&lt;/column_4&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;11&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;row&gt;
    &lt;column_1&gt;&lt;/column_1&gt;
    &lt;column_2&gt;&lt;/column_2&gt;
    &lt;column_3&gt;&lt;/column_3&gt;
    &lt;column_4&gt;&lt;/column_4&gt;
    &lt;column_5&gt;11&lt;/column_5&gt;
    &lt;column_6&gt;&lt;/column_6&gt;
    &lt;column_7&gt;&lt;/column_7&gt;

I also want it to be dynamic in the aspect that items can be listed more than once. The CMS is set up so a TAG will claim its parents. Wherever a TAG claims its parents, its children should replicate beneath. Not sure how to tackle this with XSLT, but a simple example should end up looking something like this..</p>

<p>If <code>Kampala, Uganda</code> also claimed something else as a parent, it would appear multiple times. If <code>Kampala, Uganda</code> had other TAGS that claimed it as a parent, these children would cascade beneath <code>Kampala, Uganda</code> in each instance.</p>

<pre><code>$dir = ""user:password@ftp.example.com/sub/sub"";  // not really :-)
$resource = opendir($dir) or die(""---bad directory---\n"");
echo ""&lt;PRE&gt;\$resource: "".print_r($resource,true).""&lt;/pre&gt;\n"";
$f = readdir($resource);
echo ""&lt;pre&gt; dump:""; var_dump( $f ); echo""&lt;/pre&gt;\n"";
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, if I put the value of $dir into a webbrowser, I'm immediately given a list of files.  So that is valid. var_dump on the $resource gives <strong>Resource id #6</strong>
while the $f is <strong>bool(false)</strong></p>

<p>Like I said, this is the core- once fixed, I will reintroduce the while loop and the rest of the code. The server has been updated to 5.3.27, but I can't find anything along these lines that will cause this to fail.  I'm running 5.3.10 on my environment, and it fails here too. Any thoughts as to why this won't work any more?</p>

<p>btw. allow_url_fopen is true.</p>

<p>When a user sign in we get an <em>identity provider claim</em> that identifies which provider that was used for authentication.</p>

<p>The problem is that the <code>IdentityProvider.js</code> resource does not tell us which <em>identity provider claim</em> that will be used.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Live ID</strong> use the claim value <code>uri:WindowsLiveID</code></li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> use the claim value <code>Google</code></li>
<li>An <strong>ADFS</strong> identity provider may use a claim value like <code>http://adfs.mycompany.com/adfs/services/trust</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I need to be able to map to/from identity provider claim values and the identity providers listed by <code>IdentityProviders.js</code>.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that I need to allow permissions to be assigned to users identified by a particular identity provider. To make it easy for the user I want to give them a list of identity providers to choose from (i.e. by presenting data fetched from <code>IdentityProviders.js</code>). However, the actual assignment must be made using the identity provider claim value since that's what identifies the provider.</p>

<p>Is this possible? Are there any workarounds?</p>

<p>I read on some docs that it's advisable to use join table strategy when mapping unidirectional one-to-many association for performance purposes. I'd like to know the reason of why this approach brings better performance than the others.</p>

<p>Most of the time the table renders fine, but sometimes when I rotate the device, and afterward call [tableView reloadData], the tableViewCell is coming back as a generic cell, instead of my custom one. </p>

<p>I notice it, because the cell is a standard cell with 320 width, 44 height; instead of my custom width and height.  It has no subviews defined, but when displayed on the screen has my unconfigured subviews in it.</p>

<p>I was able to bypass it somewhat by moving a reloadData around to viewDidLoad, but mainly it happens after I rotate the device now.</p>

<p>I tried doing [tableView reloadData] after a 1 second delay after the rotation, and sometimes several come back generic, sometimes they are all good.   </p>

<p>It seems to be cells that weren't visible previously also.  Like if landscape mode shows 12 of 15 cells, when rotating to Portrait 12 cells are great but the last 3 cells come back as generic duds after I reload the data.</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

        identifier = @""tableViewCellPortrait"";
    } else {
        identifier = @""tableViewCellLandscape"";
    }

    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:identifier];

    // cell is never nil, but dequeue above sometimes returns a ""generic"" empty cell instead of the one of the identifier...
    if (cell == nil) {
        cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifier:identifier];
    }
    cell.selectionStyle = UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone;

    NSDictionary *data = _tableLayoutData[indexPath.row];

    // when the ""generic"" cell loads, all these labels come back as ""nil""
    // the generic cell has no subviews, is empty

<p>I created my trunk folder and all the project files using VisualSVN from within Visual studio, everything's checked in and working copies are all up to date.</p>

<p>On another computer, I have a file called OnBoardFlash.dat, which is an image of the flash drive for the .NET MicroFramework emulator. I want to add this file in to my repository. So I copied it into the project folder, right click, SVN Add, then right click, SVN Commit. The file gets transferred to the server, all 72Mb of it, then at the end I get this error message:</p>

You have to update your working copy first.</pre>

<p>Eh? I don't understand the error message. It goes without saying that I have tried updating the working copy and running the cleanup command - but its a fresh checkout so it should be squaky clean. There can be no question of the path not existing because there are other files in the folder (both WC and Repo). It exists. Also, what does it mean by 'out of date'? It is a newly added file. I'm sure there is a simple answer to this but for the moment, it escapes me. I am hoping you all can shed some light on it.</p>

<p>Just as a sanity check, I tried adding the file directly from the Repo Browser, bypassing the working copy altogether. I get a less verbose but similar error message 'path not found'. Help!</p>

I then want to make an internal call to a url within the application, but the internal call gets issued a new session (as its a separate request from the users browser request). 
What I want to do is somehow copy the Express signed cookies across into the internal request() so that the middleware performs actions based on the original external session id.

<p>So the idea is for the function CarouselStroll() to have the div nodes inside of the 'Carousel-Inner' div placed inside of the ActiveElem variable which in turn is suppose to behave as an array. However when the code is run, the browser cannot seem to interpret the line where the browser is looking to see if the current div (the i variable) has the class 'active'->(if (ActiveElem[i].hasClass('active')). The error above is what is seen in the Safari console. Can somebody please help. </p>

<p>P.S -- Overall the function is suppose to cycle through the assigned array and check for and assign the 'active' class and render the PullEmOut function, which works just fine. For now I'm only concerned with the TypeError.</p>

<p>The graph I want to plot should look like this (in this ex 2 accounts(1930 and 1940) and sum for every account for every year):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VZgeY.png"" alt=""""> </p>

<p>The input for the graph printing is like this (The user of the script should be able to choose as many accounts as the user wants 1-n):</p>

<pre><code>How many accounts to print graphs for? 2
Account 1 :
1930
Account 2 :
1940
</code></pre>

<p>The system will store the Accounts in an array (<code>accounts = [1930,1940]</code>
) and look up the sum for every account for every year. The years and sum for the accounts are placed in a <code>matrix ([[2008, 1, 12], [2009, 7, 30], [2010, 13, 48], [2011, 19, 66], [2012, 25, 84], [2013, 31, 102]])</code>. </p>

<p>When this is done I want to plot 1 - n graphs (in this case 2 graphs). But I can't figure out how to plot with 1 - n accounts...</p>

<p>For the moment I just use this code to print the graph and it's just static :(:</p>

<pre><code>#fix the x serie
x_years = []
for i in range (nrOfYearsInXML):
    x_years.append(matrix[x][0])
    x = x + 1
plt.xticks(x_years, map(str,x_years))

#fix the y series, how to solve the problem if the user shows 1 - n accounts?

1930_sum = [1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31]
1940_sum = [12, 30, 48, 66, 84, 102]

plt.plot(x_years, konto1_summa, marker='o', label='1930')
plt.plot(x_years, konto2_summa, marker='o', label='1940')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Summa')
plt.title('Sum for account per year')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so I have tried with for loops etc, but I have not been able to figure it out with 1-n accounts and an unique account label to 1-n accounts..</p>

<p>My scenario is that the user choose 1 - n accounts. Specify the accounts (ex 1930,1940,1950..). Store the accounts to an array. System calculate the sum for 1-n account for every year and place this data to the matrix. System when reads from the accounts array and the matrix and plot 1-n graphs. Every graph with account label.</p>

<p><strong>A shorter version of the problem...</strong></p>

<p>For example if I have the x values (the years 2008-2013) and the y values (the sum for the accounts for every year) in a matrix and the accounts(should also be used as label) in an array like this:</p>

<pre><code>accounts = [1930,1940]
matrix = [[2008, 1, 12], [2009, 7, 30], [2010, 13, 48], [2011, 19, 66], [2012, 25, 84], [2013, 31, 102]]
</code></pre>

<p>Or I can explain x and y like this:</p>

<pre><code>x       y1(1930 graph1)     y2(1940 graph2)
2008        1               12
2009        7               30
2010        13              48
etc         etc             etc
</code></pre>

<p>The problem for me is that the user can choose one to many accounts (accounts [1..n]) and this will result in 1 to many account graphs.</p>

<p>Any idea how to solve it.. :)?</p>

"15340985","1","","","2013-03-11 14:23:11","","5","167","<p>I'm currently working on an application which receives commands from other devices. I will provide an interface to let others develop their own interpretation (plugin) of the incoming commands. Each of the plugins developed by others can have any custom settings which need to be provided by the users.</p>

<p>For instance, a plugin called ""KeyboardPlugin"" could support settings to set the delay between key-presses, but also show a list of all supported keys to press. Another plugin could be for instance called ""MouseMovePlugin"" where the user could select the accuracy of the mouse and its speed.</p>

<p>Now my problem is, that the settings for each plugin need to be 1. shown in the UI, 2. after the settings were selected by the user, they have to be parsed back to the plugin to let the plugin know what the user selected.</p>

<p>I'm working with Java and the UI is developed in Swing. There is a options panel which shows options which do not directly relate to the plugin, like common options. But on the same panel, I want to show the settings provided by the plugin.</p>

<p>The plugin settings look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>a)""Please enter the delay between two key presses -> [Textbox with
Int as input] (with min 1; max 500)</li>
<li>b) ""bla bla -> [Checkbox] (with
boolean)"" </li>
<li>c) ""Bla bla 2 -> [Textbox] (with String values as input;
relates on setting b!) </li>
<li>d) ""Choose button to press"" [""a"",""b"",""c""]</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, plugin settings can for instance be type int, boolean, string, but also like example d, a array or enum.
My problem now is, how can I handle this? Each plugin can have a set of setting types which also could depend on each other, like example c depends on the user choice of b.</p>

<p>1)First I need a technique to ask the plugin for its settings, well, I could just call a method provided in the plugin interface, but what should it return? I mean, a List could work but then there is no dependency between settings options. </p>

<p>2) How do I then ""set the settings in the plugin"". If the user selects his/her preferred settings, then how do I tell the plugin about?</p>

<p>The only solution which I could figure out in my head until now is the following:
A simple domain specific language (DSL) which is like this:
varName: type(min,max,default) ""UI question""
as a given example:</p>

<pre><code>buttonDelay: boolean(false) ""Enable button delay""
if(buttonDelay){
buttonDelayTime: int(1,500,25) ""Choose delay between buttons""
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would parse the settings DSL into a Java tree to be able to have a simple type checking and to use the tree also to generate the settings UI panel.
If the user then selects the settings he wants to have (which could be a subset of the provided settings by the plugin, as he/she must not use all provided settings), I would parse a Map to the plugin, like  Map, where the Key is the varName (from the example: ""buttonDelay"" and ""buttonDelaytime""). And I would probably have multiple containers for the different settings type, like for a Integer setting, there is a container, but also for boolean, array etc.
By parsing the map to the plugin, the plugin could ask the map for the settings for each settings varName, for instance like:</p>

<pre><code>public void initPluginSettings(Map&lt;String,SettingsInterface&gt; settingsMap){
BooleanSetting buttonDelay = settingsMap.get(""buttonDelay""); 
IntegerSetting buttonDelayTime = settingsMap.get(""buttonDelayTime"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does somebody has a simpler / smarter possible solution? Or are there some patterns for this problem? I already searched the web but I couldn't really find something. To implement a DSL, use the tree to type check etc. seems a bit ""too much"" for me for this problem. I mean, I could do this but I would love to get others peoples suggestions before I start.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance! </p>

<pre><code>network.download( imgRequest, ""GET"", imgListener, ""pic.png"", system.DocumentsDirectory )

In any event, it seems that calling MyModel.object.create() actually creates a database entry. This is contrary to the django documentation that states ""<strong>Note that instantiating a model in no way touches your database</strong><code>; for that, you need to save().</code>"" <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/models/instances/#creating-objects"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a>.

<p>I am using the above code block to make user grant permission to my application from LinkedIN.
The authorization screen is appearing everytime when I redirect user to <strong>authURL</strong>  with the same default scope.
Not able to figure out if I am missing anything here.</p>

<p>[<strong>STOP PRESS: I was right. Solution was found. See the answers.</strong>]</p>

<p>I am using Python's unittest framework to test a multi-threaded app. Nice and straight forward - I have 5 or so worker threads monitoring a common queue, and a single producer thread making work-items for them. The producer thread is being triggered by a test-case.</p>

<p>In this test, only one task is being put on the queue. The processing it does is in the test is just a stub for the real processing, so the worker thread does a 5 second-sleep to simulate the elapsed time before the task will really be done, and the thread will be ready to get another task.</p>

<p>To the snippet of code is:</p>

<pre><code> logging.info(""Sleep starting"")
 time.sleep(5)
 logging.info(""Waking up"")
</code></pre>

<p>Now the weird part. I see the ""Sleep starting"" log message, but not the Waking up message. The program locks up and doesn't respond to Keyboard Interrupt (CTRL+C). CPU load is very low.</p>

<p>I see the same problem in Windows and Ubuntu (Python 2.6.2).</p>

<p>I have pondered if an exception is occurring and being hidden, so I add ""print 1/0"" between the first and second line - I see the Division By Zero error being raised. I move it to after the sleep, and I never see the message.</p>

<p>I figured ""Okay, maybe the other thread is trying to log something very very large at the same time, and it is still buffering. What is it doing?""</p>

<p>Well, by this time, the test has returned to the unittest, where it is pausing waiting for the thread to get going before testing the system's state.</p>

<pre><code> logging.info(""Test sleep starting"")
 time.sleep(0.25)
 logging.info(""Test waking up"")
</code></pre>

<p>Wow, that looks familiar. It is freezing in exactly the same way! The first log message is appearing, the second isn't.</p>

<p>I have recently done a significant rewrite of the unit so I can't claim ""I didn't touch anything"", but I can't see anything untoward in my changes.</p>

<p>Suspicious areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I am including using Threading.Lock (because I don't know how to reason about GIL's safety, so I stick to what I know. I see nothing ""deadlocky"" about my code.</p></li>
<li><p>I am new to Python's unittest framework. Is there something it does with redirecting logging or similar that might simulate these symptoms?</p></li>
<li><p>No, I haven't substituted a non-standard time module!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What would prevent a thread from waking up? What else have I missed?</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<p>First of all, is this a bad design? would you rather save the image itself on the database? If so, how would you do it?</p>

<p>The second one is, how can I represent an image saved this way in a gridView?</p>

<p>I've tried the following in C#;</p>

<p>Filling a dataset with an OleDbCommand:</p>

<p><code>SELECT ItemName as Name,ItemPicture as Picture...</code></p>

<p>And setting it as the source of the GridView, but sadly, it just wrote out the hyperlink in the grid:
<code>1.jpg#1.jpg#</code> instead of showing the image.</p>

<p>How would you do it?</p>

I spent like 4 hours trying to debug this on my FBM function and couldn't figure it out so I tried Ken Perlin's improved noise function and the same thing happens.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why this is? What is a good way to fix it? The only thing I have been able to do is add a decimal value like .6473 to the x and y coordinates, which helped, but introduced other problems such as the values repeating themselves inside the arrays.</p>

<p>Here is some test code. I am trying to create two different 2D arrays filled with noise values. The x and y inputs are coordinates from my game. On the lines with '<strong><em>*</em>*</strong>' after them, if I don't increase those values, both arrays will be filled with all zeros. In the example, the coordinates (0.0, -768.0) and (-1024.0, -768.0) return the exact same noise values. In my game, 9 different coordinates return the same values.</p>

Is there a best practice for how to structure the configuration for a large number of projects (30+) without forcing each project to take this dependency? </p>

<p>The alternative, I suppose, would be to create a bootstrapper assembly that could be referenced by the host process. The bootstrapper would perform all wire-up. In this scenario, the bootstrap assembly, instead, would have references to all of the projects. This has the upside of centralizing the reference to StructureMap so that all of the projects are unaware of StructureMap.</p>

<p>Using XML-based configuration is not an option for me.</p>

<p>Are there any other options for configuration that minimize the number of static references the projects in the solution must take? I'm guessing that there isn't, but thought I'd solicit some other opinions.</p>

  for(var i = 0; i&lt;$scope.notificationsObjects.length; i++){
    if($scope.notificationsObjects[i].id == notification.id){
      var indexToRemove = $scope.notificationsObjects.indexOf($scope.notificationsObjects[i]);
      var updatedArray = $scope.notificationsObjects;
        updatedArray.splice(indexToRemove, 1);
      $scope.notificationsObjects = updatedArray;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But after updating the array, this happens although the data is still available:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ok2VH.png"" alt=""notifications2"">
The 2 arrays (before and after updating) look exactly what I expect but for some reason the directive for a single notification doesn't have the notification object anymore. These are the 2 notificationsObjects arrays (before and after removing the completed notification):
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/m58zG.png"" alt=""notifications data""></p>

<p>I thought by just recalculating the notifications and reset the new $scope.notificationsObjects would solve my problem, and it does, but it reloads my whole DOM and I don't want that. I just want the completed notification to disappear from the array (and so, remove it from the DOM). Does anyone have a clue what causes this problem, or does anyone have a better solution to solve this?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>For these templates we are using our custom transformation and processing and we do NOT want the <em>Custom Tool</em> setting of the tt files which by default is set to <em>TextTemplatingFileGenerator</em>.</p>

<p>In order to achieve that we are using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>... // logic for the files creation
ProjectItem addedItem = this.project.ProjectItems.AddFromFile(fileFullPath);
addedItem.Properties.Item(""CustomTool"").Value = string.Empty;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when the files are added to the project a code generation is caused by the default custom tool and even after we remove it from the properties of the tt files the errors caused by the transformation are still in the Errors List (its something like visual glitch).</p>

<p>They disappear as soon as you save a file, navigate to other file or build the project but we do not want our users to see these errors and make any additional actions to get rid of them.</p>

<p>We tried to access the errors collection using the DTE and DTE2 classes like</p>

<pre><code>DTE2 dte2 = (DTE2)this.project.DTE;
dte2.ToolWindows.TaskList;
</code></pre>

<p>or getting them from the ErrorListProvider provider as</p>

<pre><code>var provider = new ErrorListProvider(this.ServiceProvider);
var tasks = provider.Tasks;
</code></pre>

<p>but the TaskList is not containing these errors - may be the reason is that they are transformation errors not a compile ones. </p>

<p>Even more strange is that the DTE.Events.TaskListEvents.TaskAdded event is firing for each of the transformation errors but they cannot be found in the TaskList. Also calling the Delete() method of the errors got from the TaskAdded event is not removing them from the errors list.</p>

<p>We also tried to programmatically navigate through the files or save the tamplates but it is not refreshing the errors list like when doing it manually.</p>

<p>How can we refresh the ErrorList or tell Visual Studio not to add a Custom Tool setting when we add the templates to the Project?</p>

<p>The page is setup like so:
<code>index.php -&gt; console.php -&gt; consoleQuery.php</code></p>

<p>Where <code>index.php</code> is the main page, with buttons that can trigger multiple AJAX scripts and replace the body of <code>index.php</code> with the returned contents. One of the scripts being <code>console.php</code> and part of <code>console.php</code> includes the following script.</p>

<pre><code>window.setInterval(function() {
    $.ajax({

<p>The problme is however, upon clicking another page thats parented to <code>index.php</code><br>
(for example <code>index.php -&gt; home.php</code>)
the JS that is causing the loop still occurs in the background when <code>home.php</code> replaces the body of <code>index.php</code>. On top of this, triggering <code>console.php</code> again causes it to then refresh the console twice per second and so on if its clicked multiple times. Essentially the loop is running in multiple instances.</p>

<p>What I want to try and do is upon triggering one of the AJAX requests that doesn't request <code>console.php</code>, stop the looping script that is refreshing the body of the page.</p>

<p>Is there any way to stop the loop when accessing a different page? Thanks in advance!</p>

Accelerations at different points in time are provided through sensors. If you get the equation of these data points, the derivative of a certain time (x) on that equation will be the velocity.</p>

<p>I know how to do this on the computer, but how would I get the equation to start with? I have searched around but I have not found any existing programs that can form an equation given a set of points. In the past, I have created a neural net algorithm to form an equation, but it takes an incredibly long time to run.</p>

<p>If someone can link me a program or explain the process of doing this, that would be fantastic.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is in the wrong forum. I would post into math, but a programming background will be needed to know the realm of possibility of what a computer can do quickly.</p>

As the label contains text of different lenght I calculate the width of the label like so. I give it a little margin (10) here to be on the save side.</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>- (CGSize)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView layout:(UICollectionViewLayout*)collectionViewLayout sizeForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    NSString *text = [_collectionViewProvider collectionViewController:self titleForRow:indexPath.row];
    CGSize size = CGSizeMake(MIN(_maxWidth, [text sizeWithFont:self.font].width + 16 + 10), CGRectGetHeight(collectionView.bounds));

    return size;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I like to have the users having the impression of a horizontal scroll wheel I apply a transform and adjust the zIndex of the cells depending on the distance from the center. It works almost as expected but as the frame width gets shrinked when the transform is apllied on the far left/right I have the effect that the text gets clipped which looks rather strange.</p>

<p>Here is an image that shows the effect and when the cell is in the center.
Has anybody an idea how to solve this?</p>

Then on the Dispose of the application (in global.asax), the previously mentioned instance of the bus would be disposed. Kind of like the abbreviated version below:</p>

<pre><code>IBus bus;

protected void Application_Start()
{
    //Bunch of bus configuration and controller registration etc...
    //Now Create the bus and assign to a local variable so we can dispose it
    var startableBus = Bus.Create(busConfiguration);

<p>But in vNext, there is no dispose in the Startup.cs that I know of.  Should an instance of the bus be held on to and disposed in some way?  Is there some other pattern that should be followed for vNext? </p>

<p>The client cannot POST data, e.g. JSON or SOAP XML data to the request. It can only post form name/value pairs (or header name/values).</p>

<p>I'm trying to work around this limitation by:</p>

<ul>
<li>getting the client to post a form pair: ""phony_key=""</li>
<li>using mitmproxy to remove the key and just post the data</li>
</ul>

<p>Running the proxy with a replace expression to just strip the ""phony_key="" looked good initially</p>

<pre><code>mitmproxy --replace /~bq/phony_param=/ 
</code></pre>

<p>... and produced a good result when I invoked a request from curl, something like</p>

<pre><code>curl -d phony_param='&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt; https://host:port/path
</code></pre>

<p>But when invoked from the real client, the request was rejected by the server.</p>

<p>I think it is because the data payload when sent from the real client is urlencoded. Inspecting the request in mitmproxy using the hex option shows that.</p>

<pre><code>0000000000 25 33 43 53 4f 41 50 2d 45 4e 56 25 33 41 45 6e   %3CSOAP-ENV%3AEn

</code></pre>

<p>Whereas the request made by curl invocation shows the un-encoded XML in the hex view.</p>

<p>Since then, I've tried to make an inline script to do the job</p>

<pre><code>def request(context, flow):
    if flow.request.method == ""POST"":

        print real_post
        flow.request.content = real_post
        flow.request.set_form_urlencoded(form)

<p>The Jquery command to actually execute the slider is stored in the code file for the webpart that actually contains the slider.</p>

<p>Finally, for the record, I am referencing the following JQuery libraries in my webpart code:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>jquery 1.8.2 (also tried 1.10.2 -- no change)</p></li>
<li><p>bxslider.min.js -- the BX Slider Jquery Library</p></li>
<li><p>jquery.SPServices-2014.01.min.js -- A JQuery library ""designed to make JQuery on Sharepoint much easier."" Ha, I say.</p></li>
<li><p>SP.js, through a server token.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is JQuery above my level, and I need all the help I can get. I'm just starting learning Sharepoint, so I've probably got a lot of greenhorn mistakes in this code. Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>The issue is, if the app is running without using break points the app is crashing. Otherwise, it is working fine. And it is not showing any error, instead directly showing bad access at:</p>

{
    @autoreleasepool {
        return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class]));
    }
}

<p>And the crashing is happening before it calling the <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> delegate methods. Any idea about the reason behind this issue, please help.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
From the - (void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection {} we are getting the user's current status and we are calling the logout method in the same.</p>

<p>after that if we are using breake point ,then the control goes to <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> delegate methods.
if we are not using breake point ,Afetr - (void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection {    }method app will crash</p>

<p>The compiler I use is the g++ 4.8.2 on linux ubuntu 64bit.</p>

<p>My Problem is that if I try to retrieve a function from my ""plugin"" aka shared object, I receive a 'pointer to void' which I cast to 'function pointer' which is declared somewhere else. </p>

<p>The 'function pointer' is defined here:</p>

<pre><code>class PluginInfo {
        public:
            typedef InterfacePlugin* (*Constructor)();
            typedef std::string (*Meta)();

        private:
            std::string mPluginName; //!&lt; Save the name of the plugin.
            std::string mPluginLibName; //!&lt; Save the name of the sharedObject where the plugin starts.
            std::string mPluginVersion; //!&lt; Save the version of the plugin. [version: Major.Minor (00.00)]
            std::string mRequiredVersion; //!&lt; Save the version of the required plugin loader version. [version: Major.Minor (00.00)]
            dl::Library mLibrary;
            Constructor ConstructPlugin; //!&lt; Save a pointer to a function which initialise the plugin.
...
</code></pre>

<p>I want to store the now casted 'pointer to void' within my class as 'function pointer' to call at a later point in my program.  And here it becomes difficult:</p>

<pre><code>PluginInfo::PluginInfo(dl::Library lib) : mLibrary(lib)
{
   ConstructPlugin =  ((Constructor) mLibrary[""construct""]); // Here I try to cast and store my function from the plugin

   mPluginLibName = ((Meta)mLibrary[""PluginLibName""])();
   mPluginName = ((Meta)mLibrary[""PluginName""])();
   mPluginVersion = ((Meta)mLibrary[""PluginVersion""])();
   mRequiredVersion = ((Meta)mLibrary[""requiredVersion""])();
   if(ConstructPlugin == nullptr)
     throw std::runtime_error(""Could not find &gt;construct&lt; symbol: \n    ""+ std::string{dlerror()});
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I now want to execute this stored function I just receive 'Segmentation fault'. If I try to print the address where the function is stored I see the number ""1"" printed.</p>

<p>specifically i call the stored function here:</p>

<pre><code> void PluginManager::configure(entityx::EventManager&amp; events) {
            for(auto meta : mMetaData)
            {
                PluginInfo::Constructor ctor = meta-&gt;PluginConstructor();

                InterfacePlugin* tmp = ctor(); //not necessary step 
                mPlugin.push_back(tmp);
            }
        } 
</code></pre>

<p>where mMetaData is an std::vector;
InterfacePlugin is abstract.</p>

<p><del>How do I get the idea the pointer is changed? because if I write instead of:</del></p>

<pre><code>ConstructPlugin =  ((Constructor) mLibrary[""construct""]);// Here I store
</code></pre>

<p><del> this here: </del></p>

<pre><code>((Constructor) mLibrary[""construct""])();//Here I immediately execute  
</code></pre>

<p><del>I do not receive any Segmentation fault;the class I try to initiate which represents the plugin will be constructed just fine; additionally to that fact if I do not cast but instead print the address of the 'pointer to void', I receive proper address like <code>""0xab33f3""</code> (just an example).
I have no explanation for this behavior nor a solution for it. </p>

<p>So my question again: Why does apparently casting a Pointer to a function combined with storing it change the Pointer's address?.</del></p>

<p>Or do I forget some rules I need to keep in mind working with C 'function pointers' within of C++?</p>

<p>and the twig :</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""::base.html.twig"" %}

{% block body %}
    Hello world
{% endblock %}
</code></pre>

<p>as you can see, my twig does not use any function of my extension. it is just a simple 'hello world'.</p>

<p>So I clear the cache (even manually to be sure), and I send the route....
I have two exceptions :</p>

<p>Exception number 1 in my twig:</p>

<pre><code>ContextErrorException: Warning: Illegal offset type in my_project\vendor\twig\twig\lib\Twig\Environment.php line 1167 
</code></pre>

<p>Exception number 2: even the web tool bar cannot display and there is a 500 error from the server</p>

<pre><code>Illegal offset type ""@WebProfiler/Collector/config.html.twig
</code></pre>

<p>but coming originally from the same exception in Environment.php</p>

<p>I am sure it is linked to the extension because when I deactivate the service I have added, there are no errors</p>

<p>Thank you for you help;</p>

<p>PS : I could debug and see that the loader is not null or whatever (it seems good)... my class is the problem because I tried to load the same service giving another class extension and I dont have the problem.</p>

<p>However, I'm trying to use the XmlReader object to read each Account and subsequently the ""StatementsAvailable"". Do you suggest using XmlReader.Read and check each element and handle it?</p>

<p>I've thought of seperating my classes to handle each node properly. So theres an AccountBase class that accepts a XmlReader instance that reads the NameOfKin and several other properties about the account. Then I was wanting to interate through the Statements and let another class fill itself out about the Statement (and subsequently add it to an IList).</p>

<p>Thus far I have the ""per class"" part done by doing XmlReader.ReadElementString() but I can't workout how to tell the pointer to move to the StatementsAvailable element and let me iterate through them and let another class read each of those proeprties.</p>

<p>Sounds easy!</p>

<p>But the main OpenLayers div is intercepting the click so I have to click twice.. I'm not sure if there's a way to disable this. I've looked at the openLayers documentation and I'm not sure how to use their API to add an event listener for a click on a feature.</p>

<p>and I hit the semi-colon (;) key, it will automatically put the semi-colon at the end of the statement:</p>

<p>Currently IntelliJ does this:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar(""hello"";)

<p>Not a huge problem obviously but I have found myself putting the semi-colon in the wrong place a few times today as I make the transition back to IntelliJ and thought that it may be more efficient (for both my fingers and brain) not to have to type the closing bracket.</p>
