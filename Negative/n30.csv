<pre><code> $ipam = Ipam::with('Customer')-&gt;where('id','=', x)-&gt;take(1)-&gt;first();
</code></pre>

<p>I am having a hard time figuring out how to access the customer attributes that come with my Ipam request. The array containing the attributes is protected so I am unable to access them.</p>

<p>I can access the original attributes of the Ipam table by using the</p>

<pre><code>$ipam-&gt;getOriginal();
</code></pre>

<p>method but unfortunately that does not return any of the customer attributes(which is to be expected).</p>

<p>I have tried looking through the <a href=""http://laravel.com/api/4.2/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Model.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Model</a> documentation and haven't found anything that helps me access the customer attributes.</p>

<p>Any tips would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    }
}

<p>Customer model class:</p>

<pre><code>class Customer extends Eloquent

<p>First, the cursor in the Insert mode (which I suppose should be simply a line) is the same as the Normal mode (which is a rectangle), making it impossible to tell the current mode from the cursor shape. I don't know whether this is normal with vim in the command line because I didn't pay attention before. But this is certainly different from the behavior of macvim and it helps to distinguish the shapes of the cursor in different modes. </p>

<p>Second, the backspace does not work appropriately. It often cannot delete letters in the Insert mode. </p>

<p>This is some interesting behavior that I cannot find documented in anything official or unofficial (blog, tweet, SO question, etc). I have boiled it down to its essence and tested this in a fresh Xcode project, but I can't explain it.</p>

<p>MyBaseClass has an instance variable:</p>

<pre><code>@interface MyBaseClass : NSObject {
    NSObject *fooInstanceVar;
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>MySubclass extends MyBaseClass, and declares a totally unrelated property (that is, the property is not intended to be backed by the instance variable):</p>

<pre><code>#import ""MyBaseClass.h""
@interface MySubclass : MyBaseClass { }
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSObject *barProperty;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>If the implementation of MySubclass does <em>not</em> synthesize the property but implements the accessor methods, everything is fine (no compiler error):</p>

<pre><code>#import ""MySubclass.h""
@implementation MySubclass

- (NSObject*)barProperty {
    return [[NSObject alloc] init]; // pls ignore flagrant violation of memory rules.
}

- (void)setBarProperty:(NSObject *)obj { /* no-op */ }

- (void)doSomethingWithProperty {
    NSArray *array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:self.barProperty, fooInstanceVar, nil];
    NSLog(@""%@"", array);
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>But if I remove the property accessor methods and replace them with a <code>synthesize</code> declaration for the property, I get a compiler error: <code>'fooInstanceVar' undeclared (first use in this function)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#import ""MySubclass.h""
@implementation MySubclass
@synthesize barProperty;

- (void)doSomethingWithProperty {
    NSArray *array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:self.barProperty, fooInstanceVar, nil];
    NSLog(@""%@"", array);
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>This error goes away if I remove either the <code>synthesize</code> declaration, or if I do not refer to the <code>fooInstanceVar</code> instance variable from within MySubclass.m, or if I put all interface and implementation definitions in a single file. This error also seems to happen in both GCC 4.2 and GCC/LLVM build settings.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain what's happening here?</p>

I began using [object retainCount] to trace my memory allocation.
Is this to be trusted because I keep finding the counts really strange?</p>

<p>Could someone explain the following:</p>

<p>Bear in mind this the app delegate and an empty mainViewController makes no difference.
The initWithRootViewController is causing the count to go up, but I don't see another way of adding one....</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {      


/* Create the View Controllers */  
UIViewController *mainViewControl = [[[MainViewController alloc] init] autorelease];


/* Create the Navigation Controller */
UINavigationController *navigationController = [[[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:mainViewControl] autorelease];


NSLog(@""retain count: %i"",[mainViewControl retainCount]);

/* Set the toolbar to purple */
navigationController.navigationBar.barStyle = UIBarStyleBlackTranslucent;
navigationController.navigationBar.tintColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:.6 green:.1 blue:.4 alpha:0.4];
navigationController.navigationBar.translucent = YES;

NSLog(@""retain count: %i"",[mainViewControl retainCount]);
navigationController.toolbar.barStyle = UIBarStyleBlackTranslucent;
navigationController.toolbar.tintColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:.6 green:.1 blue:.4 alpha:0.4];
navigationController.toolbar.translucent = YES;

[navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES animated:NO];
[navigationController setToolbarHidden:YES animated:NO];

NSLog(@""retain count: %i"",[mainViewControl retainCount]);

[window addSubview:[navigationController view]];

NSLog(@""retain count: %i"",[mainViewControl retainCount]);
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the log ~ </p>

<p>I don't understand why changing those properties or referencing the navigationController is causing the retain count to shoot up.</p>

<p>I have done it without the autoreleases and manually released too but the result is the same.
Basically I don't get it, and wonder if the retainCount command is reliable, because if I can't understand this, I don't think I can debug any memory issues elsewhere...</p>

I have a C# application (.NET v3.5) that allows a user to run IronPython scripts for testing purposes. The scripts may load different modules from the Python standard library (as included with IronPython binaries). However, when the script is completed, the memory allocated to the imported modules is not garbage collected. Looping through multiple runs of one script (done for stress testing) causes the system to run out of memory during long term use.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified version of what I'm doing.</p>

<p>Script class main function:</p>

<pre><code>public void Run()
{
    // set up iron python runtime engine
    this.engine = Python.CreateEngine(pyOpts);
    this.runtime = this.engine.Runtime;
    this.scope = this.engine.CreateScope();

    // compile from file
    PythonCompilerOptions pco = (PythonCompilerOptions)this.engine.GetCompilerOptions();
    pco.Module &amp;= ~ModuleOptions.Optimized;
    this.script = this.engine.CreateScriptSourceFromFile(this.path).Compile(pco);

    // run script
    this.script.Execute(this.scope);

    // shutdown runtime (run atexit functions that exist)
    this.runtime.Shutdown();
}
</code></pre>

<p>An example 'test.py' script that loads the random module (adds ~1500 KB of memory):</p>

<pre><code>import random
print ""Random number: %i"" % random.randint(1,10)
</code></pre>

<p>A looping mechanism that will cause the system to run out of memory:</p>

<pre><code>while(1)
{
    Script s = new Script(""test.py"");
    s.Run();
    s.Dispose();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I added the section to not optimize the compilation based on what I found in <a href=""http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2009-January/009396.html"">this</a> thread, but the memory leak occurs either way. Adding the explicit call to s.Dispose() also makes no difference (as expected). I'm currently using IronPython 2.0, but I've also tried upgrading to IronPython 2.6 RC2 without any success.</p>

<p>How do I get the imported modules in the embedded IronPython script to be garbage collected like normal .NET objects when the scripting engine/runtime goes out of scope?</p>

<p>I've ran a first script that gave me two objects as results and saved them as RData.</p>

<p>On a separate script i load the RData that contains the two objects to be further treated but i get a ""task 1, cannot open the connection"" when i use a foreach loop in parallel. I suspected the loaded RData might be at fault.</p>

<p>I decided to try this simple working example on my desktop computer:</p>

<p>1/ I first run this simple code:</p>

<pre><code>library(""doParallel"")
library(""foreach"")
registerDoParallel(cores=3)

x&lt;-matrix(rnorm(2000),nrow=10,ncol=200)
squarex&lt;-foreach(i=1:10)%dopar%{x[,i]^2}
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works</p>

<p>2/then i load the RData i saved previously on the cluster</p>

<pre><code>load(""xxx.RData"")
</code></pre>

<p>The two objects are there.</p>

<p>3/if i try to run again 1, which is completely unrelated to 2, then i get the error:</p>

<p>Error in mcfork() : 
  unable to fork, possible reason: Cannot allocate memory</p>

<p>Actually everything that uses the parallel package doesn't work anymore. Trying to register cores doesn't work and sometimes even hangs.</p>

<p>Obviously something must have been imported from the cluster environnement into the RData that causes the problem. However i don't know why and the problem still exists if i do the same steps directly on the cluster.</p>

<p>INFO:</p>

<p>ls() before loading dataset:</p>

<pre><code>ls()
[1] ""squarex"" ""x"" 
</code></pre>

<p>ls() after loading dataset:
    ls()</p>

<pre><code>[1] ""squarex""                      ""trandom_list_data_Ana_all""         ""trandom_list_data_Anatem_all""

<p>trandom_list* are the two objects loaded and each are 8.7Gb (the cluster node has 47Gb and my computer 32Gb of RAM)</p>

<p>This is mostly a private project to get the hang of MVC3, EntityFramework, LINQ, etcetera. Therefore I like doing some crazy things to spice up the end result, one of those things would be the recognition of similar strings.</p>

<p>Imagine you have the following list of strings - borrowed from a game I've worked with in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li>Megabeth: Holy Roller Uniform - Includes Head, Torso, and Legs</li>
<li>Megabeth: Holy Roller Uniform Head</li>
<li>Megabeth: Holy Roller Uniform Legs</li>
<li>Megabeth: Holy Roller Uniform Torso</li>
<li>Megabeth: PAX East 2012 Uniform - Includes Head, Torso, and Legs</li>
<li>Megabeth: PAX East 2012 Uniform Head</li>
<li>Megabeth: PAX East 2012 Uniform Legs</li>
<li>Megabeth: PAX East 2012 Uniform Torso</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, once users have translated the first 4 strings, the following 4 share a lot of similarities, in this case:</p>

<ul>
<li>Megabeth</li>
<li>Uniform</li>
<li>Includes Head, Torso, and Legs</li>
<li>Head</li>
<li>Legs</li>
<li>Torso</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the first 4 strings are indeed already translated, when a user selects the 5th string from the list, what kind of algorithm or technique can I use to show the user the 1st string (and potentially others) under a sub-header of ""Similar strings""?</p>

<p>Edit - A little comment on the Levenshtein Distance:
I'm currently targeting 10k strings in the database. Levenshtein Distance compares string per string, so in this case 10k x (10k -1) possible combinations. How would I approach this in a feasible way? Is there a better solution that this particular algorithm?</p>

<li>Add a persistenceUnit reference inside web.xml</li>

<p>Help would be highly appreciated.</p>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>I guess I've fixed it somehow, although I don't know why:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inside my Dispatcher-context I pointed the <code>&lt;context:component-scan&gt;</code> directly to the controller package.</li>
<li>Inside the data-context I added a new bean <code>&lt;context:component-scan&gt;</code> which points to the base package.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe somebody has an explanation as why this works and if this violates best-practice rules, maybe.</p>

There was a 3rd file, which never seemed to be generated anew when i rebuilt: myprojectName.dll.sql</p>

<p>This file appears to contain all the contents of the embedded resources in a single file. My trouble is that I have added new sql to this project, but this file (which is used at run-time) is never re-generated with the updates. I see nothing in build events and no mention of the file name in my project, although it appears to rely on this file.</p>

Here is the example used in the slide:</p>

<pre><code>// Construction with setters
DrinkBuilder margarita = new DrinkBuilder();
margarita.add(""tequila"");
margarita.add(""orange liqueur"");
margarita.add(""lime juice"");
margarita.withRocks();
margarita.withSalt();
Drink drink = margarita.drink();

// Construction with chained invocation
Drink margarita = new DrinkBuilder()
    .add(""tequila"")
    .add(""orange liqueur"")
    .add(""lime juice"")
    .withRocks()
    .withSalt()
    .drink();
</code></pre>

<p>And I have mixed feelings about this. One shouldn't chain too many method invocations into one statement. On the other hand, writing <code>margarita.this()</code> and <code>margarita.that()</code> isn't too convenient either.</p>

<p>Now, I am coming to Java from Delphi world. And in Delphi there is the <a href=""http://www.delphibasics.co.uk/RTL.asp?Name=With"" rel=""nofollow""><code>with</code></a> language construct. This is cherished by a few and loathed by many (or is it the other way around?). I find <code>with</code> to be more elegant than the idea of chained invocation (which I believe works on the basis of <code>void</code> method returning reference to object on which it has been invoked - and this is the part I don't like, as <code>void</code> should return <em>nothing</em>).</p>

<p>I would appreciate the <code>with</code> language feature being adopted by Java, so the example code could be written like so:</p>

<pre><code>Drink margarita = null;
with (new DrinkBuilder()) {
    add(""tequila"");
    add(""orange liqueur"");
    add(""lime juice"");
    withRocks();
    withSalt();
    margarita = drink();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Am I the only one who would prefer this solution to the chained invocation? Anyone else feels that <code>with</code> could be a useful extension to Java language? (Reminds me of someone's question about the need of ""Java++""...)</p>

"3493566","1","3493891","","2010-08-16 13:29:08","","2","1013","<p>We are working on improving our DAL which is written in LINQ that talks to the MS SQL database. Our goal is to achieve good re-usability with as little code as possible.</p>

<p>LINQ generated files are making a use of generics and reflection to map LINQ generated classes to the SQL objects (tables and views in our case).</p>

<p>Please see the example of the existing accessor. This method resides in the partial class that contains custom constructors, accessors and mutators:</p>

<pre><code>public clsDVD getDVD(int dvdId)
{
   try
   {
      using (DataContext dvdDC = new DataContext(ConnectionStringManager.getLiveConnStr()))
      {
                    // Deferred loading
                    dvdDC.DeferredLoadingEnabled = false;

                    var tDVD = dvdDC.GetTable&lt;DVD&gt;();

                    return (from t in tDVD 
                            // Filter on DVD Id
                            where t.DVDId == (dvdId)
                            select t).Single();                   
      }
   catch (Exception e)
   {
       Logger.Log(""Can't get requested DVD."", e);
       throw;
   }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>I believe that this is very easy to maintain, since the most of the work is done after <code>var tDVD</code></p>

<p>It has been suggested not to declare <code>tDVD</code> at all and use <code>dataContext.TableName</code>, but behind the scenes it still calls <code>GetTable&lt;&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>The only way I can see of improving this is breaking this one partial class into 4 (CRUD) partial classes. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>clsDVD_Select, clsDVD_Update, clsDVD_Insert, clsDVD_Delete
</code></pre>

<p>In this case each class will represent a set of behaviours.</p>

<p>The idea that we are discussing is to see whether it's possible to use generics on top of LINQ generics. </p>

<p>For example, instead of having the partial classes, we would figure out the properties of the class on the go by using reflection against the SQL database. My first concern here is performance impact. How significant will it be.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>ClsDVD.getDVD(1231)</code> we'd have something on the lines of: <code>GenericDC.Select&lt;DVD&gt;(1231)</code></p>

<p><code>.Select</code> method would figure out the primary key and run a select query on that table. I'm struggling to understand how can this work. Lets say we can get this to work for the simple select, i.e. select with a filter on primary key, but what is going to happen when we start doing complex joins and group by selects. What happens when we want to have multiple selects per DVD class?</p>

<p>My final concern is to do with good practices. I have been told before that it's good to have consistant code. For example, If I decide to use datatables , than I should stick to datatables throughout the project. It's a bad idea to have half of the project with datatables and another half with user defined classes. Do you agree on this?</p>

<p>I'm in a position where I think that existing implementation is quite good but maybe I'm missing out something very obvious and there is a much easier, more OO way of achieving the same results?</p>

<p>Thank you   </p>

<p>The application (console, that runs silently like a server), needs to talk to 2 serial ports, needs to deal with timers, needs to push information on Redis KV-store, write logs, and interact with bunch of other similar applications using unix IPC (or socket comm.)</p>

<p>The easier way (to my mind) to think of such an application is to work with threads and event queues. However due to what I understand as GIL enforced limitation with threading, it is not quite an option with Python (unless, I misunderstood things). The alternative way, what I understood - is to work with asynchronous I/O framework, green-threads, coroutines etc.</p>

<p>Are <a href=""https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/"" rel=""nofollow"">twisted</a>, <a href=""http://www.gevent.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">gevent</a> and <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asyncoro/3.1"" rel=""nofollow"">asyncoro</a> really alternatives in Python for asynchronous event-driven programming that I intend to write ? </p>

<p>Since learning twisted seems to be such a big investment (in terms of time/effort), I was wondering if gevent and asyncoro could be easier and better alternative ? From the bit of superficial document reading done so far, asyncoro seems to be simplest, with very limited amount of new learning, and Twisted is other extreme, with gevent being somewhere in the middle -- but then I am not sure, if they are really comparable.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what the application would do if were multi-threaded:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thread:1 - Monitor health of serial port, periodically i.e. with a timer. Say check every 2 minutes if last state was healthy. If last state was unhealthy then check every 30 seconds for first 5 mins, then every minute for next 10 mins... like in exponential backoff. Note that there are multiple such serial ports. </li>
<li>Thread:2 - Monitor state of application-level sessions that come-and-go from time to time, over the serial ports, and the communication that happens over it. Redis is (planned) to be used to write to distributed KV-store s.t. other instances of application (running on same or other servers), can coordinate certain other actions.</li>
<li>Thread:3 - Performs some other housekeeping tasks.</li>
</ul>

"32246665","1","","","2015-08-27 10:16:14","","1","46","<p>I have a program which spawns multiple threads, each of which executes a long-running task.  The main thread then waits for all worker threads to join, collects results, and exits.</p>

<p>If an error occurs in one of the workers, I want the remaining workers to stop gracefully, so that the main thread can exit shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>My question is how best to do this, when the implementation of the long-running task is provided by a library whose code I cannot modify.</p>

<p>Here is a simple sketch of the system, with no error handling:</p>

<pre><code>void threadFunc()
{
    // Do long-running stuff
}

void mainFunc()
{
    std::vector&lt;std::thread&gt; threads;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
        threads.push_back(std::thread(&amp;threadFunc));
    }

    for (auto &amp;t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the long-running function executes a loop and I have access to the code, then
execution can be aborted simply by checking a shared ""keep on running"" flag at the top of each iteration.</p>

<pre><code>std::mutex mutex;
bool error;

void threadFunc()
{
    try {
        for (...) {
            {
                std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(mutex);
                if (error) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    } catch (std::exception &amp;) {
        std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(mutex);
        error = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now consider the case when the long-running operation is provided by a library:</p>

<pre><code>std::mutex mutex;
bool error;

class Task
{
public:
    // Blocks until completion, error, or stop() is called
    void run();

    void stop();
};

void threadFunc(Task &amp;task)
{
    try {
        task.run();
    } catch (std::exception &amp;) {
        std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(mutex);
        error = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the main thread has to handle the error, and call <code>stop()</code> on
the still-running tasks.  As such, it cannot simply wait for each worker to
<code>join()</code> as in the original implementation.</p>

<p>The approach I have used so far is to share the following structure between
the main thread and each worker:</p>

<pre><code>struct SharedData
{
    std::mutex mutex;
    std::condition_variable condVar;
    bool error;
    int running;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a worker completes successfully, it decrements the <code>running</code> count.  If
an exception is caught, the worker sets the <code>error</code> flag.  In both cases, it
then calls <code>condVar.notify_one()</code>.</p>

<p>The main thread then waits on the condition variable, waking up if either
<code>error</code> is set or <code>running</code> reaches zero.  On waking up, the main thread
calls <code>stop()</code> on all tasks if <code>error</code> has been set.</p>

<p>This approach works, but I feel there should be a cleaner solution using some
of the higher-level primitives in the standard concurrency library.  Can
anyone suggest an improved implementation?</p>

<p>Here is the complete code for my current solution:</p>

""The latter function calls sock_queue_rcv_skb() (in sock.h), which queues the UDP packet on the socket's receive buffer. <strong>If no more space is left on the buffer, the packet is discarded.</strong> Filtering also is performed by this function, which calls sk_filter() just like TCP did.

<p>When building the <strong>free</strong> variants, the annotations processor is run as indicated by the following in the gradle output:</p>

<pre><code>Note: Starting AndroidAnnotations annotation processing
</code></pre>

<p>When building the <strong>Pro</strong> variants, the annotations processor doesn't run, so the references to the generated code fails.</p>

<p>The curious thing about this is, I found (truly by accident) that if I remove the <code>packageName ""com.MyCompany.MyApp.Pro""</code> from the script....the annotations processor runs and it will build correctly.  I need to update the the package name for Google Play.</p>

<p>When looking in android studio, you can see that the apt (the Annotation Processing Tool) is showing the <strong>Pro</strong> version as being active even when I have the <strong>FreeDebug</strong> build variant selected.  I am not sure this is indicative of a problem or if this is just a problem with the beta android studio (Android Studio version: 0.2.13).  So take that with a grain of salt.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/E9UgL.jpg"" alt=""Build Folders in Android Studio""></p>

<p>I'm new to the gradle build system but I <em>thought</em> I was getting the hang of it.  I have looked at the script over and over again and I don't see why the annotations processor is not running for the <strong>pro</strong> variant.  And aside from running the wrapper with the --info and --debug arguments, I don't know yet how to debug these problems.</p>

<p>I've run the gradle wrapper with the <strong>-info</strong> and <strong>-debug</strong> to get extended output but there is nothing there that indicates any other error (or missing item) until it reaches the error caused by the missing generated code.  So this leads me to believe it's just the fact that the androidannotations are not being run with that variant that is the root problem. (i.e. I don't think this is an error caused by something upstream and being misreported later on.  I could be wrong though)</p>

<p>I'm really at a loss and have been stuck with this for 2 days now.</p>

<p>the Object xbmcpop gets created and its string property ""DevIP"" gets assigned correctly. But when the UIVIEW is actually viewed it seems like the instance that is viewed is different from the one I created and the variable @""2222"" is not passed to the string property ""DevIP""</p>

<p>Note: My Main UIViewController is in a storyboard with a navigation controller</p>

<p>If you are interested to see the ""XBMCPopUpView class, here it is:</p>

#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;

@class XBMCPopUpView;


@interface XBMCPopUpView : UIView

<p><strong>Settings and default object</strong>: I am using .NET 4.0 and .NET 4.5 in different parts of the system, and may upgrade over time. I cannot find documentation for the default properties of KeySize and BlockSize, nor the default length for IV.

Which properties should I set explicitly, and should I regenerate the key and IV afterwards?</p>

<p>Let me give you an example.</p>

<p>Recently I wanted to hookup a command in my ViewModel to a ListView MouseDoubleClickEvent. I wasn't quite sure how to do this. Fortunately, Google has answers for everything. I found the following articles:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://blog.functionalfun.net/2008/09/hooking-up-commands-to-events-in-wpf.html"">http://blog.functionalfun.net/2008/09/hooking-up-commands-to-events-in-wpf.html</a></li>

</ul>

<p>While the solutions were helpful in my understanding of commands, there were problems. Some of the aforementioned solutions rendered the WPF designer unusable because of a common hack of appending ""Internal"" after a dependency property; the WPF designer can't find it, but the CLR can. Some of the solutions didn't allow multiple commands to the same control. Some of the solutions didn't allow parameters.</p>

<p>After experimenting for a few hours I just decided to do this:</p>

<pre><code>private void ListView_MouseDoubleClick(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) {
    ListView lv = sender as ListView;
    MyViewModel vm = this.DataContext as MyViewModel;

    vm.DoSomethingCommand.Execute(lv.SelectedItem);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, MVVM purists, please tell me what's wrong with this? I can still Unit test my command. This seems very practical, but seems to violate the guideline of ""ZOMG... you have code in your code-behind!!!!"" Please share your thoughts.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I did find <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/prawn-ruby/MbMsCx862iY"" rel=""nofollow"">this incredibly old thread</a> about people seeming to have a similar issue with chrome's pdf viewer, and the ""solution"" was to just upscale the raster graphics. This is a solution, but is terribly inefficient.</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of a way to change the pdf so that it gets upscaled appropriately? Maybe a config change in evince or chrome that will render these properly? Even a nice way to go from a raster image to a vector image might be suitable?</p>

For example, a product X might have a sort order value of ""5"" in Category Y, but that some product--X--could have a different sort value--say 10--in Category Z.</p>

<p>Naturally, I could create an entity specifically for this type of thing...but it would require a new table be made...there would be 3 columns for the Category ID, Product ID, and sort order. What I'd really like to be able to do is tap into the table that entity framework already made....it will already keep track of products IDs and category IDs in the join table....is there any way to make use of the table that already exists?</p>

For that I need to know the ordinal of the given row (so I can construct NSIndexPath), which I find hard to do in better-than-linear time.</p>

<p>For example, consider that I have a list of addressbook entries which are manualy sorted by the user, i.e. there is no ordering ""key"" that represents the sort order. There is also a corresponding UITableView that shows one row per addressbook entry. When UITableView queries the datasource I query the NSMUtableArray populated with my entries and return required data in constant time for each row.</p>

<p>However, if there is a change in underlying model I am getting a notification ""Joe Smith, id#123 has been removed"". Now I have a dilemma. A naive approach would be to scan the array, determine the index at which Joe Smith is and then ask UITableView to remove that precise row from the view, also removing it form the array. However, the scan will take linear time to finish.</p>

<p>Now I could have an NSDictionary which allows me to find Joe Smith in constant time, but that doesn't do me a lot of good because I still need to find his ordinal index within the array in order to instruct UITableView to remove that row, which is again a linear search. I could further decide to store each object's ordinal inside the object itself to make it constant, but it will become outdated after first such update as all subsequent index values will have changed due to removal of an object.</p>

<p>So what is the correct design pattern to accurately reflect model changes in the UITableView in costant (or at least logarithmic) time?</p>

My scenario is adding list of data to context,
afterwards validating added data before save or update, <em>remove records which fail validation</em> from context
and <em>insert or update others</em>. There a lot of navigation properties in my parent data, so I want that when 
I remove parent object from context <strong>all its navigational properties</strong> should also be removed from context.
But by saying ""removing data from context"" <strong>doesn't mean</strong> that I also want to <strong>remove it from underlying database</strong>.
Scenarios which I have tried so far:</p>

<p><strong>I. First option</strong></p>

<pre><code>//Get the object context to be able to use Detach
//Because I use code first
System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext taxesObjectContext = 
         ((IObjectContextAdapter)myContext).ObjectContext;

//Detach entity from context to not update it
taxesObjectContext.Detach(parentEntity);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>: It only detaches the parentEntity itself, so <em>navigational properties are still there</em>.</p>

<p><strong>II. Second option</strong></p>

<pre><code>myContext.Entry(parentEntity).State = System.Data.EntityState.Unchanged;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>: It only detaches the parentEntity itself, so <em>navigational properties are still there</em>.</p>

<p><strong>III. Third option</strong></p>

<pre><code>//EntityType is type of parent entity
myContext.Set&lt;EntityType&gt;().Local.Remove(parentEntity);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>: This scenario works well when data not exists in database. When it already exists
removing record from local also <em>removes it from underlying database</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: How can I remove parent entity from local context (because it is already added) with all
its navigational properties but still not deleting it from underlying database?</p>

<p><code>CouponViewController.m:</code></p>

<pre><code>@synthesize cv;

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

    [self loadXibWithName:@""CouponView""];
    cv = (CouponView *)self.view;
    cv.delegate = self;

    [self.navigationController.navigationBar setHidden:NO];
    //[self displayLogoInNavBar];

    UIBezierPath *maskPath;
    maskPath = [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect:cv.couponImage.bounds

    maskLayer.frame = cv.bounds;
    maskLayer.path = maskPath.CGPath;
    cv.couponImage.layer.mask = maskLayer;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing different there (besides the variables) is the absence of <code>[maskLayer release]</code>, which caused an ARC error, and doesn't seem to help when said error is fixed, anyway.</p>

<p>There's also a <code>CouponView.m</code>, but that contains the <code>IBActions</code> and an <code>awakeFromNib</code>, that doesn't seem to do anything - I tried putting the following test code there:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)awakeFromNib {
    self.couponImage.layer.cornerRadius = 15.0f;
    self.couponPerforated.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""coupon_perforation_191""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, here's the <code>CouponView.xib</code> itself:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Z5XC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When it loads, the image is still a square.</p>

<p>Am I missing anything?</p>

<p>I've used gcc 4.1.2 for those tests.</p>

<p>First of all, this code is not standard, since an inline function will have different definitions in different translation units. I know that. But let's analyze what's going on and give the answer to three questions I'll make. We'll learn from it :)</p>

<p>I'll keep files simple (no #ifndef guards for example).</p>

<p>Suppose I have those files:</p>

<p><strong>increment.h</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>inline int increment()
{
    static int value = 0;
    return ++value;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>decrement.h</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>int decrement();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>decrement.cpp</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>inline int increment()
{
    static int value = 0;
    return --value; // Attention to this
}

int decrement()
{
    return increment();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>main.cpp</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include ""increment.h""
#include ""decrement.h""

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; increment() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; increment() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; decrement() &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I compile them with this Makefile:</p>

<pre><code>CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I. -O2

crazy: main.o decrement.o
        $(CC) -lstdc++ main.o decrement.o -o crazy

main.o: main.cpp increment.h decrement.h
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.cpp -o main.o

decrement.o: decrement.cpp decrement.h
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c decrement.cpp -o decrement.o

clean:
        rm -f *.o *.~ crazy
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>1
2
1
</code></pre>

<p>If I remove the -O2 flag from the Makefile:</p>

<pre><code>  CFLAGS=-I.
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>

<p>If I also change the order of main.o and decrement.o (leaving it without the -O2 flag as I just did):</p>

<pre><code>$(CC) -lstdc++ decrement.o main.o -o crazy
</code></pre>

<p>the result is:</p>

Many people keep suggesting I switch to mysqli as mysql will disappear at some point, however, I've read that making this switch is a lot harder than adding an i at the end and requires rewriting all your code.  </p>

<p>If I ask is the switch worth it, I imagine almost everyone will say yes since sticking with mysql seems to be a minority point of view.  So my my question is, is it possible to switch to mysqli incrementally, ie gradually update calls or pages as they are written, or is it better to freeze the old site and redo the whole thing as an all mysqli or pdo site.  When I say better, I taking into consideration all the work and costs involved in redoing the whole site.  Obviously, there is an attraction to allocating resources to new features and things on the site, rather than redoing things that work fine using the old mysql.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm trying to do:</strong></p>

<p>Create a duplicate set of slides from a template, create 'n' new slides (each replicating the template slide) with some specific text in each slide. The text is multiple lines and some may be bolded, so it has to be inserted not as a single text, but as multiple text paragraphs.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>It seems I'm doing all the things I need to do, but I'm hitting a corrupt file error.</p>

<p><strong>What I have successfully managed to do so far</strong></p>

<p>I am able to copy the template slide, create a new set of slides, and I'm also able to insert new text to a placeholder (via simple replacement) and save it. So those manipulations are not a problem. The problem is when I create new paragraph elements programmatically, set the properties and insert the nodes to the textBody.</p>

<p>Here are my basic steps in the method which creates a new slide</p>

<p>We're in the method that creates a new Slide, newSlide and the code below just loops through to create a set of random text elements.</p>

<p>Note: The 'Drawing' refers to </p>

<pre><code>using Drawing = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing;

<p>Code</p>

<pre><code>            for (int mxx = 0; mxx &lt; 4; mxx++)
            {
                Drawing.RunProperties rp = new Drawing.RunProperties();
                if (mxx % 2 == 0)
                    rp.Bold = true;

                rp.Dirty = false;

                Drawing.Text txt = new Drawing.Text();
                txt.Text = ""another  line "" + i;

                Drawing.Run rn = new Drawing.Run();

                Drawing.Paragraph pg = new Drawing.Paragraph();
                rn.InsertAt(rp, 0);
                rn.InsertAt(txt, 0);

                pg.InsertAt(rn, 0);

                if (bc &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; i &gt; 2) //some conditions - ignore for now
                {
                    DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Presentation.TextBody body = newSlidePart.Slide.Descendants&lt;DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Presentation.TextBody&gt;().ElementAt(1);
                    body.InsertAt(pg, 0);
                }
            }

<p>Given my low knowledge of openXML (started yesterday!) it's not clear to me what else I need to do. I did reverse-engineer check the pptx by extracting the archive, I can see the the following main difference but is that the reason for the corruption?</p>

<p>So what's different? As you can see, the a:bodyPtr and lstStyle in my chunk appears between paragraph elements. Is that the problem - the order of elements? Or am I missing something else?</p>

<p>It would be great to know if there's a simpler, correct way to do this - for e.g. how do I insert the para (a:p) at the end of the current p's in the txtBody...</p>

    each tile of size 1x1 covers exactly one whole square;
    each tile of size 2x2 covers exactly four whole squares;
    each square of the board is covered by exactly one tile.

<p>Two interesting tilings of a board are different if there exists at least one square on the board that is covered with a tile of size 1x1 in one tiling and with a tile of size 2x2 in the other. For example, all tilings shown in the images above are different.</p>

Somehow push the 'Date'-data into same array as 'values' and convert it into right date format?</p>

<p>It offers LIVE,VOD, FILE content, according with <code>AVPlayerItemAccessLogEvent.eventType</code>. 
In the app I did add observers for different events:whether the buffer is empty or full,and so on.</p>

<p>I can get current playing time from the web server, sending JSON request. In the future I can detect current time on the server.</p>

<p>When I access AVPlayerItem.currentMedia time it changes strangely. I know that it's not an observable property, addPeriodicObserver can be used.</p>

<p>Here is the part of the log describing how current time in player does change: </p>

<p><code>- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context
{
    NSLog(@""!!!!! Current time!!!! %f"",CMTimeGetSeconds(self.player.currentTime));</code></p>

<p>!!!!! Current time!!!! nan </p>

<p>......</p>

<p>!!!!! Current time!!!! 0.000000</p>

<p>.....</p>

<p>!!!!! Current time!!!! 10056.000000</p>

<p>I know that I get nan when I get notification that player is not likely to keep up, or rate has changed. </p>

<p>I need to detect current time before first buffering, But current time is zero, and in the future it will jump suddenly.</p>

<p>Also the webserver returns to me a time of telecasts (start,end time). Seems that they don't match with a playlist. I mean that if I iterate over telecasts and get min start time, it doesn't equal to start time in player's current item property.</p>

<p>1)Does it mean that for matching current time my playlists have to be formatted in other way?
Seems that playlist contains not a program for current telecast, but also some other programs,broadcasted before.</p>

<p>2)How to get player's item currentTime instead of 0, while processing buffer's empty event <code>playerItem.playbackBufferEmpty</code>? </p>

<p>Also, I was trying to detect the difference in current playback time on the server and current time on the player, by using <code>AVPlayerItemAccessLogEvent.numberOfBytesTransferred/AVPlayerItemAccessLogEvent.observedBitrate</code>.

I cannot ""not"" use this static class, but obviously running multiple tests has become problematic. So my question is this. Is there a way in a junit test to reinitialize a static class? That way one test is not effected by a previous test?</p>

<p>So in other words some way of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>Foo.setBar(""Hello"");

// Somehow reinitialize Foo

String bar = Foo.getBar(); // Gets default value of bar rather than ""Hello""
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, I cannot change Foo, so I'm stuck using it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> It appears I made my example a bit too simple. In the real code ""Bar"" is set by a system property and gets set to an internal static variable. So once it starts running, I can't change it.</p>

<p>I was making a little app to ping some servers, the issue i'm having is that the GUI of the program locks up while it waits for a response.
This is what I have so far, Button_Click is the ""Ping IP"" button, ping_box is a textbox that will contain the response time, ip_address is a IP address in the form of a string.</p>

<pre><code>    private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        Stopwatch s = new Stopwatch();
        s.Start();

        while (s.Elapsed &lt; TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2))
        {
            using (Ping p = new Ping())
            {
                ping_box.Text = (p.Send(ip_address, 1000).RoundtripTime.ToString() + ""ms\n"");

                if (ping_box.Text == ""0ms\n"")
                {
                    ping_box.Text = ""Server is offline or exceeds 1000ms."";
                }
            }
        }
        s.Stop();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So in its current state it pings the IP address repeatedly for two seconds and puts the response time into a textbox, during this time the GUI locks up though.
I need to recorrect this as I want the textbox with the response time to update with each ping (if the response time is 500 ms then the textbox should update four times).</p>

<p>I've tried to use Ping.SendAsync but could not get it to work, any pointers or help would be much appreciated :)</p>

I've tried this:</p>

&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""WorkingHours[0].Hours[08:00]"" value=""16:00""&gt;

<p>I would love some help debugging this. I can't see any way for the <code>JSON.stringify</code> call to return the empty string. Is that reasonable? If so, then it has to be that the request body is either getting stripped off in-flight, or something in my Django application is doing it.</p>

<p><strong>How can I better separate two ""flows"" of conditions &amp; rules for the desktop and mobile users.</strong></p>

<p>The site has two versions full &amp; mobile. The ""full"" site is served out of index.php and relies on jQuery to swap content (pages &amp; subpages). The ""full"" site has an alternate, static page, view for Facebook and browsers w/out JS. </p>

<p>The mobile site is based on the content of the full site but is more limited in scope of content.</p>

<p>On a desktop browser (or when a cookie specifies) urls should deliver as:</p>

<pre><code>(1) http://domain.com/#/resources/article --&gt; http://domain.com/index.php#/resources/article
(2) http://domain.com/resources/article --&gt; http://domain.com/static.php?page=resources&amp;subpage=article
</code></pre>

<p>On a mobile browser (or when a cookie specifies) the same url should deliver as:</p>

<p>It gets all the calls from the database, if two or more calls are equals in type (missing,incoming or outgoing), and also are the next row, they get grouped into one row and a numeric indicator shows the grouped amount, otherwise, the row is simply added to the table view without any strange action.</p>

<p>The thing I'm trying to do is that grouping by type when next row is same type as previous row. I know how to do it with code, <strong>but</strong> I want to know if there is any way to do it via <strong>ONLY SQL</strong>.</p>

So I added the a <strong>user</strong>, <strong>group</strong> and <strong>groupmembers</strong> table to the database.<br>
I defined a ManyToMany relationship between <strong>user</strong> and <strong>group</strong> via the association table <strong>groupmembers</strong>. <br>
In order to protect some ressources of the app (i..e <strong>item</strong>) I added a additional association table <strong>auth_items</strong> which should be used as an association table for the ManyToMany relationship between <strong><em>groups/users</em></strong> and the specific <strong><em>item</em></strong>.</p>

<p>item has following columns: </p>

<ul>
<li>user_id --> user table</li>
<li>group_id --> group table</li>
<li>item_id --> item table</li>
</ul>

<p>at least on of <strong>user_id</strong> and <strong>group_id</strong> columns are set. So it's possible to define access for a group or for a user to a specific item. </p>

<p>I have used the AssociationProxy to define the relationship between users/groups and items.<br></p>

<p>I now want to display all items which the user has access to and I have a really hard time doing that. Following criteria are used:</p>

<ul>
<li>All items which are owned by the user should be shown (item.owner_id = user.id)</li>
<li>All public items should be shown (item.access = public)</li>
<li>All items which the user has access to should be shown (auth_item.user_id = user.id)</li>
<li>All items which the group of the user has access to should be shown.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three criteria are quite straightforward, but I have a hard time doing the 4th one. </p>

<p>Here is my approach:</p>

<pre><code>clause = and_(item.access == 'public')
if user is not None:
   clause = or_(clause,item.owner == user,item.users.contains(user),item.groups.contains(group for group in user.groups))
</code></pre>

<p>The third criteria produces an error. </p>

<pre><code>item.groups.contains(group for group in user.groups)
</code></pre>

<p>I am actually not sure if this is a good approach at all.<br>
What is the best approach when filtering manytomany relationships?<br>
How I can filter a manytomany relationship based on another list/relationship?<br></p>

<p>Btw I am using the latest sqlalchemy (6.0) and elixir version </p>

<p>Thanks for any insights. </p>

This is set in headers which are not part of the public header file, and the runtime gives you the ability to lower the limit, but not exceed the hard limit. The Python sqlite3 module on Snow Leopard (and Lion as well, apparently) allows more parameters than this, however, and I can't figure out for the life of me how this is possible.</p>

<p>I considered the possibility that the Python wrapper is doing the parameter substitution itself and passing full statements to sqlite3; but as far as I can tell from the source code, that's not happening. I also considered the possibility that the implementation of sqlite3 on Snow Leopard was compiled from slightly different source code; but it turns out that Apple publishes its open-source modifications (see <a href=""http://opensource.apple.com/source/SQLite/SQLite-74.11/"">http://opensource.apple.com/source/SQLite/SQLite-74.11/</a>) and the parameter limit in their source is identical to the default.</p>

<p>If someone has an idea about how this might be happening (and I'm certain it's happening; I've created statements with 2000 parameters and they work fine), please chime in. For what it's worth, I encountered this oddity because the identical code breaks on Windows, due to the parameter limit.</p>

The other possible solution to my problem would be getting whether the user clicked on a value and chose it or it was invoked by some method. My problem is I need to know what caused this event and execute some code only if the previous value was different. I have read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11496860/getting-previous-value-of-the-combobox"">this</a> and didn't like the solution to the possible way #2.</p>

<p>So again:</p>

<pre><code>if user clicks
{
    execute some code
}
else // if method was invoked
{
    do NOT execute
}

OR

if value is NOT the same as previously
{
    execute some code
}
else
{
    do NOT execute
}
</code></pre>

<p>Either of that suits me, but I am unable to find the previous value in the list of available properties nor in EventArgs (which is null :( ). Hope I was clear what I want to achieve. If you ask for the reasons that I need this, it is irrelevant and I cannot edit the other code, just this method.</p>

I understand Tesseract does basic image pre-processing. I would like to know if it is possible to bypass these methods and directly feed in an image that I processed manually. (Again, in order to avoid redundant processing on the image)?</p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong>  How can I build all twelve configurations in one step, i.e. by running a single MSBuild command on the command line, and how can I get the configurations to be built in parallel?</p>

<p>As an example, if there were just two configurations, Release/AnyCPU and Debug/AnyCPU, I would want both of these to build at the same time, in parallel.</p>

<p>For completeness, the following is what I have tried; I don't yet have a solution to this problem.</p>

<hr>

<p>To build all of the projects at once, I created a new project file with a Build target that runs the MSBuild task on the Solution file for each configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Target Name=""Build""&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Release;Platform=Win32""     Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Release;Platform=x64""       Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Release;Platform=ARM""       Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Release(ZW);Platform=Win32"" Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Release(ZW);Platform=x64""   Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Release(ZW);Platform=ARM""   Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;

  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Debug;Platform=Win32""       Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Debug;Platform=x64""         Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Debug;Platform=ARM""         Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Debug(ZW);Platform=Win32""   Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Debug(ZW);Platform=x64""     Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
  &lt;MSBuild Projects=""cxxreflect.sln"" Properties=""SolutionDir=$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\;Configuration=Debug(ZW);Platform=ARM""     Targets=""$(BuildCommand)"" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;

<p>This works great, except that each MSBuild task is invoked in sequence, so there's no parallelism (yes, there is parallelism <em>within</em> each configuration build, but I'd really like to get parallelism across configuration builds).</p>

<p>In an attempt to get the configurations to build in parallel, I tried to make use of the MSBuild task's BuildInParallel property.  I wrote a pre-build task that generated project files for each configuration, then attempted to build all of these generated projects in parallel:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Target Name=""PreBuild"" Outputs=""%(ProjectConfiguration.Identity)"" Returns=""%(BuildProject.Identity)""&gt;
  &lt;Message Text=""Cloning Solution for Configuration:  %(ProjectConfiguration.Identity)"" /&gt;

    &lt;BuildProjectPath&gt;$(IntPath)\%(ProjectConfiguration.Platform)\%(ProjectConfiguration.Configuration)\build.proj&lt;/BuildProjectPath&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;BuildProject Include=""$(BuildProjectPath)"" /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

<p>Unfortunately, while this does build all twelve configurations, it builds them serially.  My guess is that when MSBuild performs dependency analysis on the set of projects to be built, it identifies that they all depend on the same Solution file, so it decides they cannot be built in parallel.  (This is just a guess; I could be completely wrong.  I know very little about MSBuild.)</p>

<p>I am also using the /m switch when building.</p>

<p>""NaN is numeric so you can't encounter it in a logical vector."" and 
""NA stands for ""Not available"", and is not the same as the general NaN (""not a number""). NA is generally used for a default value for a number to stand in for missing data; NaN's are normally generated because a numerical issue (taking log of -1 or similar)."" Would I be remiss if I modified my understanding of NaN values from one where I thought of them as completely non-numeric (as the name would suggest) to one where they actually are numeric in nature but not in a generally understood definition, e.g., calculating the square root of a negative number which results in an imaginary value? If so, that would explain why is.na(NaN) results in a TRUE result because NA (numeric by definition) is mathematically compatible with NaN (numeric in a semi-esoteric sense).  </p>

<p>Any constructive advice would be appreciated.</p>

<li>Clicked the Hang up on call button and Make a call button on the emulator</li>

<pre><code>$tool = ""pageant.exe""

</code></pre>

<p><code>$files</code> is a list of strings which contains all my private keys which must be loaded.</p>

<p>I have no problem with the working of the script because it does its job perfectly when I execute this from my powershell 
console. </p>

<p>I want to execute this script whenever I logon to my account and I do this by adding a powershell logon script
group policy with the group policy editor (gpedit.msc), the script also executes and in fact does load the pageant.exe tool. </p>

<p>However the tools utilising the pageant.exe tool (putty and plink) does not work. It doesn't recognizes the pageant authentication 
agent. </p>

<p>So my <strong>first</strong> question is, what is the difference between starting the script from my own powershell console and starting the script
from a group policy (logon script)?</p>

<p>I also have dome some investigation and I see a couple of differences. The first is thing is that the started pageant tool has a UAC Virtualization flag in my task manager when I start the script from my own console. This property isn't flagged when it's started
from the logon script group policy. </p>

<p>The second thing is that when I disable the UAC the script <strong>does</strong> work from the logon script group policy. So I assume it has something to do with the UAC but I don't know how to solve this. I want the script to work when the UAC is
enabled as well.</p>

<p>The <strong>second</strong> question what is this UAC virtualization flag and how does it influence the working of a process? The <strong>third</strong> and last question is how can I get my script working?</p>

<p>I'm currently writing a Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel PIA wrapper in .NET C# 3.5 and was wondering about what is best to use while calling methods like opening a given workbook.</p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.missing.aspx""><code>System.Type.Missing</code></a> or <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.missing.value.aspx""><code>Missing.Value</code></a>?</p>

<p>I have performed a few Google searches, and can't find any difference, except that one is from the <code>System</code> namespace (<em>System.Type.Missing</em>), and the other (<em>Missing.Value</em>) comes from the <code>System.Reflection</code> namespace.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the major difference, if any, between both?</li>
<li>Under which circumstances one is best to use than the other?</li>
<li>Why is this so?</li>

<p>Both seem to be used when you want to pass a parameter's default value to the interop assembly...</p>

I understand the need for them, but their use spreads to places they normally don't belong to.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that using database abstraction layers for SQL generation is not the right way of writing database applications that should run on multiple database engines, especially when you throw in really expensive databases like Oracle. And this is more or less global, it doesn't apply to only a few languages.</p>

<p>Just a simple example, using query pagination and insertion: when using Oracle one could use the FIRST_ROWS and APPEND hints(where appropriate). Going to advanced examples I could mention putting in the database lots of Stored Procedures/Packages where it makes sense. And those are different for every RDBMS.</p>

<p>By using only a limited set of features, commonly available to many RDBMS one doesn't exploit the possibilities that those expensive and advanced database engines have to offers.</p>

<p>So getting back to the heart of the question: how do you develop PHP, Python, Ruby etc. applications that should run on multiple database engines?</p>

<p>I am especially interested hearing how you separate/use the queries that are especially written for running on a single RDBMS. Say you've got a statement that should run on 3 RDBMS: Oracle, DB2 and Sql Server and for each of these you write a separate SQL statement in order to make use of all features this RDBMS has to offer. How do you do it?</p>

<p>Letting this aside, what is you opinion walking this path? Is it worth it in your experience? Why? Why not?</p>

<p>So, I try to implement this thing in Android. After doing some search, I achieved how to do that. What I have tried is following.</p>

<p><strong>1) First I take a root reference of the View and take a snap of it using <code>getDrawingCache()</code> function of View.</strong></p>

<pre><code>linearLayout.buildDrawingCache();
SoftReference&lt;Bitmap&gt; bitmap = new SoftReference&lt;Bitmap&gt;(
            Bitmap.createBitmap(linearLayout.getDrawingCache()));
linearLayout.destroyDrawingCache();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2) I take the position relative to its parent and cut the image as per requirement.</strong></p>

<pre><code>SoftReference&lt;Bitmap&gt; temp = new SoftReference&lt;Bitmap&gt;(
            Bitmap.createBitmap(bitmap.get(), 0,
                    (parentHeight - childHeight), childWidth, childHeight));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>3) I make that bitmap image blur with some algorithm. ( I use <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067955/fast-bitmap-blur-for-android-sdk"">Fast Bitmap Blur For Android SDK</a> <em>fastBlur</em> effect )</strong></p>

<p><strong>4) set it in the overlay view.</strong></p>

<pre><code>imageView1.setImageBitmap(Utils.fastblur(temp.get(), 8));
</code></pre>

<p>But my problem is it takes time to take a snap then giving blur effect and cutting image and then i got final result. While iOS has very fast blurring process like when drawer is coming from bottom, it immediately blur the screen which is behind it.</p>

<p>Is there any other way to achieve that? Because using my scenario, i can't take every second snap of screen and do all process 1 to 4 every second on every move of drawer. </p>

<p>Which data structure would be the best for keeping track of Heuristic, Movement Cost, and the sum of the two for a given Bitmap? The two main ones I've been thinking about were SortedSet and SortedList. Other sources say to use a priority queue, but as far as I know, C# doesn't have one. </p>

<p>So things to keep track of would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>The x and y coordinate of a pixel.</li>
<li>The Movement Cost (no diagonals)</li>
<li>The Hueristics (using Manhattan distance)</li>
<li>The sum of the two</li>
<li>Parent of the Node</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm planning to create a node object that will have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tuple (xcoordinate, ycoordinate)</li>
<li>Parent node</li>
</ul>

<p>What data structure should I use and how should i organize my node to best fit my needs?</p>

<p>I am using Mediaplayer of Android (API 19+) to play video. But when I pause the Mediaplayer (by <code>mp.pasue()</code>), I can't get the progress of the playback buffering.</p>

<p>For example, before pausing, the progress of the buffer is at 5%, and then it will not change.</p>

<p>In fact, the <code>onBufferingUpdate</code> callback function</p>

<pre><code>public void onBufferingUpdate(MediaPlayer mp, int percent)
</code></pre>

<p>will not be called when Mediaplayer is pausing. I tried to use <code>VideoView</code> instead, but when I call <code>getBufferPercentage()</code>, it will always get 5% when pausing.</p>

<p>What's more, Mediaplayer doesn't seem to pause buffering of the content, because when I restart the player after a while,
the buffering progress suddenly jumps to 100%. I'm sure it's not possible this video can be buffered so fast!</p>

<p>This problem doesn't appear on Android API 18 (or lower).
Can anyone tell me how to fix it?</p>

<p>I was thinking of maybe summing a dictionary that uses the current second as a key, and when receiving a packet it increments that value by one, as well as setting the second+1 key above it to 0, but this just seems sloppy. Any ideas?</p>

<p>This is probably the quintillionth time I've run into this error with SFML. This error oddly only occurs when running the executable, rather than during compilation. I don't know what is causing the error (apart from the program not finding the file), since it worked like a charm before I reinstalled Ubuntu.

Everything works fine, the array is returned fine in JSON and using the arrow keys I can select the returned values into the input box. However the suggestion box will not display and using firebug I think it has to do with the suggestion box  being set to display: none. Although when i change this on firebug I still can't see the suggestion box...</p>

<p>Anyway here is my code:</p>

<p>HTML</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;div class=""ui-widget""&gt;
        &lt;label style=""width: 45%;""&gt;Quick Search:&lt;/label&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JQuery - Ajax</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function()
{
    $( ""#search"" ).autocomplete({
      dataType: ""json"",
      source: ""php/search_ajax.php""
    }); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>PHP</p>

<pre><code>header(""Content-Type: application/json"");
include('db.php');

$names = mysqli_query($connect, ""SELECT name FROM info"");

while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($names)){

    $name_array[] = $row['name'];

}

echo json_encode( $name_array );
</code></pre>

<p>In firebug I get correct results: console = response [""name1"", ""name2""]</p>

<p>And in firebug HTML I get the results listed: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""ui-id-1"" class=""ui-autocomplete ui-front ui-menu ui-widget ui-widget-content"" tabindex=""0"" style=""display: none; width: 356px; top: 165px; left: 676.5px;""&gt;

&lt;li id=""ui-id-3"" class=""ui-menu-item"" tabindex=""-1""&gt;name2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>One other thing that I thought may be a problem is the fact that the above output ul is created outside my wrapper div which all my page content is inside of. Don't know if this would result in it being hidden behind my background image.</p>

<p>I'm pretty new to coding so I don't know how i can change the JQuery default output to stop the display: none and I also don't think that will even work.</p>

<p>Been searching for a reason but can't seem to find one, the closest thing to my problem was at this link <a href=""http://archive.railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=35469"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=35469</a> but it provided no solution.</p>

<p>Sorry for how long that was but wanted to provide as much detail as possible because this is starting to fry my brain and I hope someone can shed some light on it</p>

<p>I have a simple table with results from a mysql database using </p>

<pre><code>mysql_fetch_assoc();
</code></pre>

<p>and then using a While loop to display the results in a table.
I'm using Twitter-Bootstrap as a CSS Framework and to also handle the Modals explained further on.</p>

<p>Here is the output</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VpuQz.png"" alt=""Table""></p>

<p>Now what I wish to do is to trigger a Modal using the edit button which will contain that specific row's data in a form. Getting the modal to trigger is not a problem, it's displaying the specific row's data within the modal dependent on which row has had the edit button clicked. As for the Form, there will be 4 <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>'s  with a submit button at the bottom of the Modal to update the results in the database. I will most likely be handling that with a $.POST/Ajax method rather than php as it'd be nice to refresh the table without having to reload the page after the modal has closed.</p>

<p>I'm confident in being able to update the results but it's just getting ""$(this)"" 's data to be displayed dependant on which result wants to be edited.</p>

<p>Here is an image of the modal when triggered by clicking on the edit button.

Now multiple other classes extend that abstract class. Not all classes wants to override all the method of abstract class because that are not useful to them. How can I provide default implementation of those methods inside subclasses that aren't useful for the class?
Example-:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Animal
{
    public void Action()
    {
     .....
     this.roar();
    } 

    public abstract void roar();

    public abstract void run();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Above is the abstract class that is going to have abstract methods that subclasses would implement.</p>

<pre><code>public class Lion extends Animal
{
   @Override
   public void roar()
   {
      s.o.p(""Lion roars"");
   }

   @Override
   public void run()
   {
      s.o.p(""Lion runs"");
   }
}

public class Deer extends Animal
{
   @Override
   public void roar()
   {
      // Question : What should I do here?
   }

   @Override
   public void run()
   {
      s.o.p(""Deer runs"");
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT-:</p>

<p>Thanks for suggestions, I understand the idea of having another class which can have method that aren't common (""roar"" in this case).But My Project structure is a bit different and its kinda legacy code in which numerous subclasses extends from Animal class. Subclasses call a concrete method which in turn call abstract methods(""roar"" in this example, Please see updated Animal class with concrete method ""Action"").
Now as you suggested if I created another abstract class</p>

<pre><code>public abstract RoaringAnimal extends Animal
{
    public abstract void roar();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will solve one of the problem as I can now just extent RoaringAnimal instead if Animal but other classes which calls Animal.Action method, they won't find implementation of roar() inside Animal and javac will complain.</p>

<p>This class is a package local class:</p>

<p><code>class ClassFileAssembler implements sun.reflect.ClassFileConstants {...</code></p>

<p>So we can not use even its name <code>ClassFileAssembler</code>, we can not import it directly - it will lead to compiler error.</p>

<p>However we can create package named <code>sun.reflect</code> in our project and use <code>ClassFileAssembler</code> name internally in this package - Java compiler will think, that we are inside <code>ClassFileAssembler</code>'s package.</p>

<p>If so, why not try to get reference to class object, i.e. <code>ClassFileAssembler.class</code>?</p>

<p><code>Class&lt;ClassFileAssembler&gt; classFileAssemblerClass = ClassFileAssembler.class;</code></p>

<p>Unexpectedly this code leads to run-time error: <code>java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class sun.reflect.ClassFileAssembler from class sun.reflect.Test</code>.</p>

<p>However we still able to get <code>ClassFileAssembler</code> class object:</p>

<pre><code>Class&lt;ClassFileAssembler&gt; aClass = (Class&lt;ClassFileAssembler&gt;)Class.forName(""sun.reflect.ClassFileAssembler"");
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine and gives us full class description.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, the questions are:</p>

<p>1) What is the difference between techniques, how <code>Class.forName0</code> retrieves reference to class object, and how <code>.class</code> does it? </p>

<p>2) Why they have such different security checks? </p>

<p>3) What's the reason to protect <code>.class</code> reference in such way?</p>

<p>4) Do these techniques use different class loaders?</p>

<p>Is there a way to incorporate selecting the correct <code>IStorageService</code> into Windsor's dependency resolution and avoid the factory altogether? Or do I still need it?</p>

<p>I like @PatrickQuirk's solution, except that it seems odd to have to create a wrapper and corresponding wrapper interface for the factory just for the sake of dependency injection. Ideally I'd have the api controller's constructor take in an IStorageService as a parameter, which seems more intuitive/consistent with the field that actually needs to be set.</p>

What I want is very simple (or so it would seem). I'm trying to create a footer that sits under the content/body and is at the very bottom of the site. No white space on the left, right, or bottom. Then when the site has minimal content the footer will sit at the bottom of the screen. The problem that I'm running into is that when the content is more than a page long, instead of pushing the footer down with it, the footer just sits where the bottom of the screen is (when scrolled to the top). This means that when the user scrolls to the bottom of the site, the footer remains in the middle somewhere, overlapping content. </p>

<p>I wish I had kept track of all the sites and forums I've been on and tried, but It's been several full days of searching. It's better than when it started (originally I couldn't push the left and right margins to full width), but this last problem is just evading me. Any help would be very much appreciated. (I am using a Wordpress Twenty-Twelve Child Theme if that helps)</p>

<p><a href=""http://kjel.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Desired-Footer.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">Desired Footer</a></p>

<p>My current hypotheses are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is code somewhere that makes the footer stick to the bottom of the screen with minimal content, and it is constantly applied. From what I understand, the way people do this is by using min-height:100%, but with/without that line it makes no difference.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe there is something not right in terms of my html hierarchy? Twenty-twelve used #masthead, #page, #main, and #colophon. I've come across a couple sites where people say to make sure the footer is outside of the main wrapper. I've done this but it hasn't worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe the issue is not in footer at all? Maybe the other containers need to be changed. Maybe #main needs to be set to position:relative; or something (but that hasn't worked).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's all the html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body &lt;?php body_class(); ?&gt;&gt;
&lt;div id=""page"" class=""hfeed site""&gt;
&lt;header id=""masthead"" class=""site-header"" role=""banner""&gt;

&lt;nav id=""site-navigation"" class=""main-navigation"" role=""navigation""&gt;
&lt;button class=""menu-toggle""&gt;&lt;?php _e( 'Menu', 'twentytwelve' ); ?&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;a class=""assistive-text"" href=""#content"" title=""&lt;?php esc_attr_e( 'Skip to content', 'twentytwelve' ); ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;?php _e( 'Skip to content', 'twentytwelve' ); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;?php wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' =&gt; 'primary', 'menu_class' =&gt; 'nav-menu' ) ); ?&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;!-- #site-navigation --&gt;
&lt;?php if ( get_header_image() ) : ?&gt;
&lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;img src=""&lt;?php header_image(); ?&gt;"" class=""header-image"" width=""&lt;?php echo get_custom_header()-&gt;width; ?&gt;"" height=""&lt;?php echo get_custom_header()-&gt;height; ?&gt;"" alt="""" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- #masthead --&gt;

&lt;div id=""main"" class=""wrapper""&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #page --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #main .wrapper --&gt;
&lt;footer id=""colophon"" role=""contentinfo""&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- #colophon --&gt;
&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the footer css:</p>

<pre><code>footer {
background:url(http://kjel.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/footer-img.jpeg) repeat-x bottom center;
height:100%;
width:100%;
position:absolute;
margin:0px;
padding:0px;
bottom:0px;
min-width:100%; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that I have tried Ryan Fait's sticky footer which I've seen referenced quite a bit. I haven't been able to get it to work properly. I'm not a professional coder, I'm a musician with a basic knowledge of html and css trying to save cash. If I'm going about the footer the complete wrong way, feel free to set me straight.

    return View::make('articles.view', compact(array('disqus')));
    }
}

<p>The problem is that whenever I use the <code>$disqus</code> variable, it is not 'generated' from the Service Provider, but the Disqus class itself.</p>

<p>However, when I have <code>$disqus = App::make('Disqus');</code>, the variable goes through the service provider.</p>

<p>So my question is, since the binding exists in the Service Provider, shouldn't the <code>$disqus</code> variable come from the <strong>DisqusServiceProvider</strong> rather than the <strong>Disqus</strong> class directly when I use it in my controller?</p>

My system app needed permissions such as android.permission.WRITE_APN_SETTINGS and android.permission.CONNECTIVITY_INTERNAL and did well until Jelly Bean

I don't understand the reason why my system app doing well in Jelly Bean started to have security problems from KitKat.</p>

In the <code>onCreateView</code> section I have set a <code>onItemClickListener</code> for the list, which highlights the selected item in the <code>ListView</code>. I have set two <code>ImageButtons</code> that navigate up and down the list. On selection a new <code>Row</code> is inflated (<code>R.layout.selected_row</code>) that has its <code>TextView</code>'s set to the content of the select item (for the purpose of retaining the highlighted selected state). Unfortunately, upon clicking an item and/or clicking an <code>ImageButton</code> nothing appears to be inflated (nor any noticeable change on the list occurs). I believe that it may have something to do with the adapter <code>SelectedAdapter</code> construction, IE:</p>

<pre><code> public SelectedAdapter(Context context, int textViewResourceId, List objects) {
            super(getActivity(), R.layout.listview_routines, routines);

<p>Additional Info:</p>

<p>The adapter mentioned above (<code>SelectedAdapter</code>) does require me to pass <code>routines.add(selectedPos+1, currentRoutine);</code> in place of <code>routines.add(selectedPos-1, str);</code> which I believe the most direct way to get the <code>String</code> value to the new <code>Row</code>. Unsure if this is a contributor. </p>

What I am having a hard time doing is figuring out how I am going to distinguish who did what and who to send that packet of information to.  For example here is the order of things that would be happening.</p>

<p>1.) User logs into program and Credentials are checked against a MySQL Database.</p>

<p>2.) The user gets to create a game ID or game # that is also checked against a database to see if there is already a game ID matching and allows them to join the game or if there is no game then inserting data into the database and essentially waiting for another player to join it (think server browser if you will for online games).</p>

<p>3.) Once the user has either joined a game in progress or has created a game it calls a Async BeginConnect().</p>

<p>4.) The user then plays the game and the data like (""played card"") or (""looses life"") etc is sent to the only other player in the current game.</p>

<p>My question is how to only send that information to the correct players.  The game will only support 2 players 1 on 1 but there could be multiple games going on at one given time.  For example there could be 5 games playing each supporting 2 players.  What is the best way for me to keep track of these sockets so that I can distinguish between the game ID's.</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; user#1 is playing in game with ID #1 against user#2
--&gt; user#1 ""plays a card""
---&gt; Only send this information to user#2
</code></pre>

<p>I appreciate the help in advance and please let me know if I left something out that would be fruitful in answering my question.</p>

It happens that a memory leaks occurs in the call to <strong>CFStreamCreatePairWithSocketToCFHost</strong> (evidentiated by the Leaks tool in Instruments), which seems strange to me as the <em>CFReadStreamRef</em> parameters <strong>readStream</strong> and <strong>writeStream</strong> are either <strong>CFReleased</strong> at a later stage, or assigned to a correspondent NSStream object via <strong>__bridge_transfer</strong> (and that should eventually bring the streams memory management from CoreFoundation to ARC).
I've googled around but the only solutions I have found are under garbage collection(clearly not available in ARC): am I missing something or that should not happen?

The idea is that I would like the converter to return a value based on whether or not the source value implements a specific interface.</p>

<p>I have a method that works if I pass the type name as a string, but I'd rather have it be a strongly typed value to avoid potential maintenance issues down the road and have compile time checking rather than relying on a failure at runtime.</p>

<p>Here is the converter I have that uses strings:</p>

<pre><code>class InterfaceToVisibilityConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
    {
        if (value != null)
        {
            var type = value.GetType();
            if (type.GetInterface(parameter as string) != null)
            { return Visibility.Visible; }
        }
        return Visibility.Collapsed;
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works great other than the potential maintenance problems outlined above. </p>

<p>This is how you might use it in xaml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabItem Header=""General"" 
         Visibility=""{Binding ConverterParameter=IMyType, Converter={StaticResource InterfaceToVisibilityConverter}}""&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock Text=""Whatever Content Goes here.""/&gt;
&lt;/TabItem&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, it is checking the current DataContext to determine if it supports the interface IMyType and if so, the tab will be visible. If not, the tab will be collapsed. Very handy for creating UI's that are sensitive to what their data source is capable of.</p>

<p>Is there any way to accomplish what I would like to do?</p>

"6318902","1","6319861","","2011-06-11 22:29:23","","8","4222","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>My application gathers data from the phone and sends the to a remote server.<br>
The data is first stored in memory (or on file when it's big enough) and every X seconds or so the application flushes that data and sends it to the server.</p>

<p>It's mission critical that every single piece of data is sent successfully, I'd rather send the data twice than not at all.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>As a test I set up the app to send data with a timestamp every 5 seconds, this means that every 5 seconds a new line appear on the server.<br>
If I kill the server I expect the lines to stop, they should now be written to memory instead.</p>

<p>When I enable the server again I should be able to confirm that no events are missing.</p>

<p>The problem however is that when I kill the server it takes about 20 seconds for IO operations to start failing meaning that during those 20 seconds the app happily sends the events and removes them from memory but they never reach the server and are lost forever.</p>

<p>I need a way to make certain that the data actually reaches the server.</p>

<p>This is possibly one of the more basic TCP questions but non the less, I haven't found any solution to it.</p>

<h2>Stuff I've tried</h2>

<ul>
<li>Setting <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/Socket.html#setTcpNoDelay(boolean)""><code>Socket.setTcpNoDelay(true)</code></a></li>
<li>Removing all buffered writers and just using <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/OutputStream.html""><code>OutputStream</code></a> directly</li>
<li>Flushing the stream after every send</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional info</h2>

<p>I cannot change how the server responds meaning I can't tell the server to acknowledge the data (more than mechanics of TCP that is), the server will just silently accept the data without sending anything back.</p>

<h2>Snippet of code</h2>

<p><b>Initialization of the class:</b></p>

<pre><code>socket = new Socket(host, port);
socket.setTcpNoDelay(true);
</code></pre>

<p><b>Where data is sent:</b></p>

<pre><code>while(!dataList.isEmpty()) {
    String data = dataList.removeFirst();
    inMemoryCount -= data.length();
    try {
        OutputStream os = socket.getOutputStream();
        os.write(data.getBytes());
        os.flush();
    }
    catch(IOException e) {
        inMemoryCount += data.length();
        dataList.addFirst(data);
        socket = null;
        return false;
    }
}

return true;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Update 1</h2>

<p>I'll say this again, I cannot change the way the server behaves.<br>
It receive data over TCP and UPD and does not send any data back to confirm the receive. This is a fact and sure in a perfect world the server would acknowledge the data but that will simply not happen.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update 2</h2>

<p>The solution posted by Fraggle works perfect (closing the socket and waiting for the input stream to be closed).</p>

<p>This however comes with a new set of problems.<br>
Since I'm on a phone I have to assume that the user cannot send an infinite amount of bytes and I would like to keep all data traffic to a minimum if possible.</p>

<p>I'm not worried by the overhead of opening a new socket, those few bytes will not make a difference. What I am worried about however is that every time I connect to the server I have to send a short string identifying who I am.</p>

<p>The string itself is not that long (around 30 characters) but that adds up if I close and open the socket too often.</p>

<p>One solution is only to ""flush"" the data every X bytes, the problem is I have to choose X wisely; if too big there will be too much duplicate data sent if the socket goes down and if it's too small the overhead is too big.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Final update</h2>

<p>My final solution is to ""flush"" the socket by closing it every X bytes and if all didn't got well those X bytes will be sent again.</p>

<p>This will possibly create some duplicate events on the server but that can be filtered there.</p>

I have been reading the http code extensively in the access_output and access modules. My question is regarding how the client asks the server to send more data in the application layer, specifically using http. I assume it is within the httpd file located in the src/network folder, but I have been writing to log files and I can't seem to figure out how the client asks for the data. It really seems like the server just sends it to the client without acknowledgement, but I highly doubt this is the case.</p>

<p>1- Created a message queue on a server (transactional queue). 
2- Created a receiver app that handles incoming messages on that server. 
3- Created a client app located on a client machine which sends messages to that server with the specific name for the queue.</p>

<p>4- I used the sender client app with the following code (C# 4.0 framework):</p>

<pre><code>System.Messaging.Message mm = new System.Messaging.Message(""Some msg"");
mm.TimeToBeReceived = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 50);
mm.TimeToReachQueue = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 30);
mm.UseDeadLetterQueue = true;

mq.Send(mm);
</code></pre>

<p>So this is setting the timeout to reach queue to 30 seconds.</p>

<ul>
<li>First test worked fine. Message went through and was received by the server app. </li>
<li>My second test,  I disconnected my ethernet cable, then did another send from the client machine. </li>
</ul>

<p>I can see in the message queue on the client machine that the message is waiting to be sent (""Waiting for connection""). My problem is that when it goes beyond the 30 sec (or 50sec too), the message never goes in the Dead-letter queue on the client machine.</p>

<p>Why is it so ? ... I was expecting it to go there some it timed-out.</p>

This doesn't really bother me (I could care less about the result and more about it working).  What did bother me was a comment that talked about issues when viewing from iOS devices and the commenter found that once the media queries were consolidated the issue was resolved.</p>

<p>Has anyone found a good solution for using media queries with LESS?</p>

<p>The way I invision this working would be something like...</p>

<pre><code>//Have an overall structure...
.overall(){
    //Have ALL your CSS that would be modified by media queries and heavily use
    //variables that are set inside of each media queries.
}
@media only screen and (min-width: 1024px){
    //Define variables for this media query (widths/etc)
    .overall
}
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that there could be some issues with this, but the current setup doesn't seem to be that beneficial.</p>

<p>So I guess my question is if there have been any good solutions/hacks to allow for grouped media queries?</p>

<p>(Just incase it matters I use dotless as the engine to parse my <code>.less</code> files)</p>

For AMD I am using the native node require because it is convenient and does what I need it to do.  To run my projects at the moment I am using grunt-watchify.  This allows me to point a file of entry and a file of output.  So at the moment it produces one file uncompressed or mangled.</p>

<p>I would like to know what is the best approach for compressing and mangling my final file.  I have tried uglify after the file is built by watchify but it does not seem to work correctly.  I feel that is a dirty hack anyway.  So here is my questions?</p>

<p>What is the best way to build a node project into one file?  Grunt library suggestions would be great.  Any that support compression/minifying would also be great.</p>

<p>I now want to internationalize the web page (have it available in another language).

<p>The problem is that my custom error messages are currently written in the servlet. I was not planning to reroute to different servlets according to the language (ie: same servlet will run for all languages).
The only way that I can think of to do this would be to write each of the custom error messages on the jsp and then have the servlet set a request attribute that identifies the error type.</p>

<p>This solution would require adding a lot of text to the jsps (some fields have 10 different error messages and different messages depending on user type).</p>

<p>I want to filter the items in the <code>shop</code> table on best selling items, so I want to sort the <code>shop</code> table on the sum of <code>amount</code> with <code>shop_orders.product_id = shop.id</code>.</p>

LEFT JOIN shop_orders ON (shop_orders.product_id = shop.id)

<p>But it only returns all the items witch are in the shop_orders table, but I want all the items even if they aren't sold yet.</p>

<p>I tried using:</p>

<pre><code>   SELECT shop.*, 
          SUM(shop_orders.amount) as sold 
     FROM shop
LEFT JOIN shop_orders ON (shop_orders.product_id = shop.id)

<p>It returns nothing. How can I make this query work so that all the items in the <code>shop</code> table are returned with a row called <code>sold</code> witch counts this <code>shop_order.amount</code> for that <code>product_id</code> together so I can sort on that.</p>

Let's say there are 6 configurations (<code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, ..., <code>f</code>). The configurations may not change linearly, so if you think of the measurements as a table, there could be gaps in the table. The question is regarding structuring these statistical data in memory.</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind is to read these configurations to a dynamically allocated 6-deep array or arrays:</p>

<pre><code>struct data ******measurements;
</code></pre>

<p>Now this works fine. You have very little memory overhead (only the configurations that have data will actually be allocated) and the access time is <code>O(1)</code>.</p>

<p>Besides the fact that most people don't like <code>******</code> pointers, this has the downside that adding configurations means adding dimensions to the array, which could get ugly unless read/write to the array is encapsulated in a function. (Write is already encapsulated to take care of allocation when necessary, so this in fact is not such a big deal).</p>

<p>Another idea that comes to mind is to use a map of <code>struct config</code> to <code>struct data</code> using an AVL tree or something (which I <a href=""https://github.com/ShabbyX/shDS/blob/master/include/shmap.h"" rel=""nofollow"">already have</a> so has no implementation overheads). This solves the problem of extending the configuration parameters, but decreases access time to <code>O(log(n))</code>.</p>

<p>The number of tests could get considerably large for the <code>O(log(n))</code> to make a difference.</p>

<p><strong>My question is: Is using a 6-deep nested array here justified? Or is there a better way of doing this?</strong></p>

So far, everything appears to be working fine, except that Bootstrap will not recognize a class list that I've attached to a table element via JavaScript. Here's a quick snippet example:</p>

<pre><code>var myTbl = document.createElement('table');
myTbl.setAttribute('class', 'table table-hover table-striped table-bordered table-condensed');

<p>The table is created just fine and the class is viewable as an atrribute in the debugger, yet the styles associated to this class list are not being applied to the table via Bootstrap.
I've tried including Bootstrap before I called the function which builds this table as well as I've tried including Bootstrap after I build this table, and this did not make any difference. I am also including angular.min.js after constructing this table and after including Bootstrap. I've also written the same application in HTML, associated an ID to the table with the class, and later pulled that table into a JavaScript variable to investigate it within the debugger, and it is exactly identical to the JavaScript generated table, yet the hard-coded HTML table has the style effects of the class list and the JavaScript generated one does not. If anyone can help me out, it would be greatly, greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>The code I am returning to is...</p>

<p>Can I return either an array or a single result in this way or should I just add the single result to the array and return that?</p>

<p>1) Read XML/XHTML files</p>

<p>2) Do some minor pre-processing</p>

<p>3) Transform it with a XSLT stylesheet, if required.</p>

<p>4) Post-process it slightly.</p>

<p>5) Save it as XHTML.</p>

<p>My XML files would start with something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=""text/xsl"" href=""../xslt/default.xslt""?&gt;

<p>If I read them with</p>

<pre><code>scala.xml.XML.load(scala.xml.Source.fromFile(file))
</code></pre>

<p>I get an Elem, but I loose the XML processing instructions. I resorted to reading it as String, doing String manipulation to find the xml-stylesheet, and then passing it to</p>

<pre><code>scala.xml.XML.load(scala.xml.Source.fromString(text))
</code></pre>

<p>There must be a better way of doing this. I need to know which stylesheet I should use <strong>inside Scala</strong> because Scala has to call the XSLT processor, if needed.</p>

<p>Also, after I'm done processing them, I save them using</p>

<pre><code>scala.xml.Utility.trim(transformed).buildString(true)
</code></pre>

<p>but the resulting document does not contain the XML declaration, nor the HTML DOCTYPE. I want to have those too.</p>

<p>I know that this is technically two questions, but those are basically both ends of the same problem, and I suspect that the solution to the second problem is related to the solution of the first one.</p>

Basically I'm trying to get a histogram by customer filled by category.  At the end of the dplyr pipeline I have ""cust"" and ""total"" events by category, what I get is an error on the ""cust"" factor.  I think this is a grouping issue, so my example contains code I've tried that's commented out and some additional color for my problem.  Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Example data frame</p>

<pre><code>df = data.frame(cust=rep(c(""cust1"",""cust2"",""cust3""),each=3), 
                category=rep(c(""q1"",""q2"",""q3""), 3, each=4), 
                val=1:4)

<p>If I comment out the group/ungroup statements I get a factor range error un-commenting the x=~total line plots a single bar filled properly. Wrong, but creates the geom none the less.</p>

Naive way is to go through each of the 49 999 points for each of the 50 000 points and do a metric testing. But this approach will take large time.

I'm using EF1 (no choice there) and have a MySQL database as a backend.</p>

<p>A simple question I can't really find a satisfying answer for:</p>

<p>What exactly do I have to do for loading? IE., when I have an entity and want to enumerate through its children, say I have the Entity ""Group"" and it has a child ""User"", and I want to do ""from n in g.Users where n.UserID = 4 select n"", I first have to call g.Users.Load();</p>

<p>This is a bit annoying, because when I do a query against a non-loaded collection, I would expect the EF to load it automatically - AT LEAST throw some exception, not simply return 0 results?</p>

<p>Another case of me having to take care of loading:
I have a query:</p>

<pre><code>from n in Users where n.Group.Name == ""bla"" select n
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason it fails, giving a null pointer for n.Group, even though n.GroupID (the key for the group) is correctly set. Also, when I before do Server.Groups.Load() (Groups are children of one Server), it works.</p>

<p>Is there any exact policy about when to call Load() of which collection?</p>

Michael</p>

Keep in mind I need to keep the same image, but possibly find a way to display it differently. would i need to specify a different image per viewport, or specify to load it differently? how can i solve this problem while maintaing the same image on desktop view?</p>

<p>Cassandra allows for highly concurrent database operations and in batches of huge no of operations, in a single go.
They recommend using batch sizes like hundreds of operations in a single batch operation.

<p>so, I have a 2 dimensional array of size [6][7], and I want to check in diagonal if there are 4 tokens which are ""*"" or ""o"" that are defined as a chars which are in a a row. I'm trying to write a function that after each play, it sums up all the possible diagonals and see if the sum is 4 for example, or if we want to check in pairs, if we get three similar pairs then there are 4 equal tokens in a row, so in this case the sum is 3, and so on..</p>

<p>for all I know, there are 12 different different diagonals (every 6 on different direction), how do u suggest me to write this function while being the most effective? and also including all the possibilities with less that 16 lines of code. 
any kind of help would be appreciated!  </p>

<p>here is an example of what I did:</p>

    int o_count = 0;

<p>Also, I have class for Predicates:</p>

<p>And then I wanna use something like this: </p>

<pre><code>List&lt;User&gt; users = getSomeUserList();
Booleant check = users.stream().anyMatch(Predicate.isNull(User::getSecondName));

I am not able to change any register settings, so I want to deal with it. According to the document there is an API to get the notifications from the file system. I assumed that the WatchService is the Java implementation of this API. Am I correct?</p>

<p>I started with the WatchDir example from the jdk samples and stripped it a bit. I only need to know when a file is created and delete (I don't care about file modifications). For testing I have added new File.exists() when a new event has been triggered. I also start a separated Thread which test the file existence also. When I don't start this separated thread the file exists returns true immediately. When the extra thread is started it is not accurate any more. I need a more accurate file.exists check in the whole application and all running threads. </p>

<p>For testing I have used 2 Windows 7 pc's (running java 7) (with smb2 enabled which is default). The working directory must be on the remote pc and the file test.txt must be created (or copied from another folder) on the remote pc (not using the network drive, but on the pc itself).</p>

<p>As you can see the file test.txt  is created on line 9. The watchService have notified it. But in real the application cannot use it: The FileExistsThread have seen it on line 20, (at least 10 x 300 ms later). </p>

<p>Any idea's?</p>

<p>[edit]</p>

<p>I also tried this :  </p>

<pre><code> public synchronized static boolean fileExists( final String fileName )
 {
   File f = new File( fileName );
   String fullFileName = f.getAbsolutePath();
   final String shortfileName = f.getName();

   File dir = new File( fullFileName ).getParentFile();
   if ( dir == null )
     return false;

   String[] list = dir.list( new FilenameFilter()
   {
     @Override
     public boolean accept( File dir, String name )
     {
       return name.equalsIgnoreCase( shortfileName );
     }
   } );
   if ( list == null )
     return false;

   return list.length == 1;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>This method returns true when I expected. But I still cannot use the file after it. I actually want to open a new FileInputStream( file ). This throws a FileNotFoundExeption, while this fileExists() method returns true. Now I wait untill new File().exists() returns true before opening the FileInputStream. This works.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

Within that there are about 1 million groups I'd like to do some very simple calculations on. For example, I'd like to take some existing column <code>'A'</code> and make a new column, <code>'A_Percentile'</code> that expresses the values of '<code>A'</code> as percentile ranks, within the group. Here's a little function that does it:</p>

<pre><code>from scipy.stats import percentileofscore

def rankify(column_name,data=my_data_frame):
    f = lambda x: [percentileofscore(x, y) for y in x]
    data[column_name+'_Percentile'] = data.groupby(['Group_variable_1',
                                               'Group_variable_2'])[column_name].transform(f)
    return
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can call it like so:</p>

<pre><code>rankify('Column_to_Rank', my_data_frame)
</code></pre>

<p>And wait for...quite a long time. </p>

<p>There are some obvious things I could do to speed this up (for instance, I'm sure there's a way to vectorize <code>[percentileofscore(x, y) for y in x]</code>). However, I have the feeling that there are some Pandas tricks I could be doing to speed this up immensely. Is there something I could be doing with the <code>groupby</code> logic? I thought about breaking it apart and parallelizing it, but 1. I'm not sure of a good way to do it and 2. the communication time to write out the data and read in the results seems like it would take nearly as long (perhaps I think that because of point #1).</p>

<p>While everything is pretty well explained in the documentation, it seems that the simple task to associate an entity (or Model) with another isn't explained in the documentation or the examples.</p>

<p>For example, it is easy to generate a crud for Ideas and one for Polls. But what if I have to link ""polls"" to an ""idea"", in a one-to-many relation?</p>

<p>I assume I would do something that resembles to this in polls.client.controller.js:</p>

<pre><code>// Create new Poll
    $scope.create = function() {
        // Create new Poll object

        var poll = new Polls ({
            ideaId: this.idea.ideaId,//here I associate a poll with an Idea
            vote1: this.vote1,
            vote2: this.vote2,
            vote3: this.vote3,
            vote4: this.vote4,
            vote5: this.vote5

        });

        // Redirect after save
        poll.$save(function(response) {
            $location.path('polls/' + response._id);

            // Clear form fields
            $scope.name = '';
        }, function(errorResponse) {
            $scope.error = errorResponse.data.message;
        });
    };
</code></pre>

<p>But when the angular model is pushed to Express.js backend, I don't see any trace in the request about the Idea, the only thing I get is the Poll.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Create a Poll
 */
exports.create = function(req, res) {
var poll = new Poll(req.body);
poll.user = req.user;
//poll.ideaId = req.ideaId;//undefined
poll.save(function(err) {
    if (err) {
        return res.status(400).send({
            message: errorHandler.getErrorMessage(err)
        });
    } else {
        res.jsonp(poll);
    }
});

The best similar one is <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4386392/aapt-not-found-under-the-right-path"">aapt not found under the right path</a>.</p>

<p>My problem is that I can be using Eclipse for a whole evening programming, compiling and using my device, and then suddenly I get ""error executing aapt"" for my current project and ofcourse R.java isn't (properly)  generated anymore. I then restart Eclipse and everything goes away. I'm seeing this once a day on average however.</p>

<p>I've recently switched to amd64 and installed the latest Android-2.3 SDK and matching tools. I know that there is now a platform-tools folder that has an aapt version that should work SDK version independently. At first I had added this directory to my PATH, as instructed on the SDK website. I've also tried not adding it to my path and making a link platforms/android-9/tools so that every SDK version might use it's own old copy. Needless to say, platform-tools/aapt is there and has the right permissions, and I have been able to execute it on the command-line at any time.</p>

<p>When I do write a faulty xml file or sorts, and appropriately get an error, I see an extra line that says ""aapt: /lib32/libz.so.1: no version information available"". I'm running a recent Gentoo linux system. I have everything installed to support x86 on amd64, but have re-emerged emul-linux-x86-baselibs and zlib just to be sure. The problem persists. I do see some <a href=""http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=431124"">pages</a> that spell horror over some zlib bugs, but I'm not sure if that's related. I realize I'm not on the reference Ubuntu platform, but surely the difference cannot be that great?</p>

<p>It might very well be a bug in aapt or the tools itself. Why would it suddenly stop working? I also experience that the ids in R.java were incorrect, namely that simple findViewById() code would give ClassCastExceptions because of mixed ids the one time, and then work perfectly without any changes bu only a ""clean project"", in the aftermath of a failing aapt.</p>

<p>Finally, I've run a few commands on aapt, that don't seem to add any extra information:</p>

<pre><code>#ldd aapt

<p>Can anybody tell anything wrong with my configuration? Does it smell like a bug perhaps (otherwise let's report it (again))?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2010-01-06:</strong></p>

<p>I've gained some more knowledge. When I recently was trying to export a signed apk, I ran into another error message (full details from the Eclipse error view) regarding aapt I hadn't seen before. Note here too, that I can just restart Eclipse and can export apks again without problems, at least for a little while.</p>

<p>I'm starting to think it is related to lack of memory on my system. The message ""onvoldoende geheugen beschikbaar"" means ""insufficient memory available"".</p>

<p>I have also been seeing insufficient memory errors in DDMS when I'm dumping HPROF files.</p>

<p>Here is the error log (shortened):</p>

What I need and can't figure out how to pull off is when the user presses the delete button a confirm dialog popups asking the user ""are you sure?"". If the user says yes then I want to disable the delete button and perform a postback that will run the server side code deleteButton_Click. </p>

<p>Here is the tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Button ID=""deleteButton"" Text=""Delete"" OnClick=""deleteButton_Click"" runat=""server"" /&gt;

<p>Here is the javascript (in jquery) to handle the client side click:</p>

<pre><code>var deleteButton = $(input.eq(0));
deleteButton.click( function()
{
    var a = confirm( ""Are you sure you want to delete this item?"" );
    if ( a == false )

    	__doPostBack( deleteButton.attr( ""id"" ), """" );

<p>The confirm dialog works as expected and the disabling works ok too. The form does postback fine but it does not run the deleteButton_Click event handler. The __doPostBack javascript code does exist on the page. </p>

<p>I could add UseSubmitBehavior=""false"" to the deleteButton tag but then it would ignore the confirm dialog answer. </p>

<p>So maybe I'm asking too much of ASP.NET here. Any ideas how to make this work?</p>

<p>My project pulls in some third-party libraries (Python, HDF5, Trilinos, and Microsoft MPI), each of which has to be built with the same runtime library as my final executable (otherwise they cannot be linked together). When linking statically, each of these libraries will contain a copy of the C runtime. I read that this is liable to cause issues because the final executable will contain multiple copies of the runtime, none of which can interact with each other. But wouldn't the linker complain if the same symbols were multiply defined?</p>

<p>I would like to avoid ""DLL Hell"" but am worried about insidious errors that could arise from statically linking in multiple copies of the runtime. Am I reading things wrong?</p>

<p>Had lots of trouble just getting PostgrSQL installed so I could have botched up something trying all the potential solutions I could find searching on that subject.  Which mainly appeared to be permissions and existing OSX installation.  for this issue I'm noticing some things that make me think there is some fundamental directory or version conflict that I'm not sure how to resolve yet.  But I could be wrong and it is something else!  Any direction is appreciated.</p>

<p>retrieving an error such as this:</p>

<p>I'm not sure where and why it's looking for the var directory but ~/var appears to be a link (alias) to /private/var (which has empty pgsql_socket &amp; pgsql_socket_alt directories), /usr/local/var doesn't have pgsql_socket directory but does have a postgres directory. both of those directories my admin user has read &amp; write permission from the finder get info dialog.  </p>

<p>The above error shown is followed by a long stack in the gems 1.8 directory and finishes with this:</p>

<p>so checking:</p>

<p><code>The program '[2188] BVLReports.vshost.exe: Managed' has exited with code -336589910 (0xebf00baa).</code></p>

<p>And excel gets tied up, and won't respond. I know how to <code>Exit Sub</code> from within the macro if the ""stop"" value exists, so I don't need answers on how to check/cancel from inside the macro. Any ideas on a better way to write this ""stop"" value or a better way to cancel the macros externally?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Removing the .fade class from the <code>.modal</code> div fixes this, and the event only triggers once.</p>

    });
    $('.cmsZoneToolbar').find('.cmsZoneEdit').click(function(e){
        openeditscreen();
        return false;

<p>I am writing a program which needs to read in binary files of which I know the format/layout. The bulk of these files contain ""structs"", with the layout of each stored in the header of the file. Each struct contains fields which could be either structs or ""base"" types (which are not structs, and can be either value or reference types like <code>float</code> or <code>String</code> or <code>Vector3</code>).  </p>

<p>I do not need to access most of the data in these files, so I would not have to define all possible structs for my current project, but there are enough that I would have to define that doing it manually would be tedious and time consuming.</p>

<p>My problem is that there are an extremely large number of these structs (2500+ different ones, though only the ones appearing in a file are defined in that file's header). I would like to be able to read them in, without having to manually define each one, in a way that makes all the data available in the same way. My current thinking is that I should create a class like this:</p>

<pre><code>
class Struct{
  StructDefinition _def;
  List &lt Field &gt _fields;
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the field class I would need to be able to store both structs AND base types (or more importantly reference and value types). Is there a way to do this without turning everything into an <code>object</code> then casting it to the correct type when I need it? Also, is this the best way to go about reading in these files, or is there a better method?</p>

<p>The issue is (I think) related to the callback nesting, Safari (IOS) seems to freak out from the 2nd level of nested callbacks on.</p>

<p><strong>Find the complete and working code for you to reproduce the issue at the end of this post</strong></p>

<h2>In short</h2>

<p>what Safari (Mac) does not work with is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function myFun(){
    asyncFuncion(parameter1, successCb, failureCb);

    //---- first level callbacks
    this.successCb = function(){
        anotherAsyncFunction(parameter2, successCb, failureCb);

        //--- second level callbacks
        this.successCb = function(){
            //--- Chromes reaches this point, Safari (Mac) doesn't!
        };
        this.failureCb = function(){
            //--- handle error
        };
    };
    this.failureCb = function(){
        //--- handle error
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>Chromes successfully reaches the innermost callback (2nd level callbacks) while Safari (on Mac/Ipad) doesn't. Safari keeps looping on the first callback, never reaching the 2nd one.</p>

<p>If I'm not wrong, Chrome is behaving correctly as each <code>this.successCb</code> is defined inside his own  function scope, meaning that the outer scope won't be affected nor used when the time to call the callback comes. Am I wrong?</p>

<p>If I define the function ""inline"" on both levels, everything works fine also in Safari (See an example of what I mean with ""inline""):</p>

<pre><code>asyncFunction(parameter1, function(){
    //--- ""inline"" success cb
}, function(){
    //--- ""inline"" failure cb
}
</code></pre>

<p>What's wrong with IOS's Safari?</p>

  <p>A resource in a hypermedia API is probably better thought of

</blockquote>

<p>But above quote suggests that in REST each URL always identifies a <em>different resource</em> ( thus two URLs can never identify the <em>same resource</em> ). Reason being that a <em>resource</em> in a hypermedia API is better thought of as representing the <em>API response</em> rather than the <em>underlying model instance</em>, and considering that <em>API responses</em> from different URLs are definitely not identical, the conclusion is that two URLs can never identify the same <em>resource</em>.</p>

<p>Would you agree that in REST a <em>resource</em> should be thought of as representing the <em>API response</em> and as such two URLs can never identify the same <em>resource</em>?</p>

The application has a number of MDIChild (FormStyle fsMDIChild) forms which open with WindowState wsNormal. When I open one of these forms, and close it again, my main menu (TMainMenu) on the main form (FormStyle fsMDIForm) aligns itself to the right and never goes back again. If I resize the MDIChild form before closing it (eg. click on ""Normal"" or ""Minimize"" icon), this does not happen.</p>

<p>This does not happen with the Delphi 5 version, so I assume something gets handled differently with XE 7.</p>

<li>Create a new VCL app</li>
<li>Make main form (MainForm) formStyle MDIForm</li>
<li>Create MainMenu for MainForm with menu items</li>
<li>Create second form (ChildForm)</li>
<li>Make ChildForm formStyle MDIChild</li>
<li>Create MainMenu for ChildForm with menu items</li>
<li>IMPORTANT (THIS IS WHAT BREAKS IT): Select for ChildForm BorderIcons only biSystemMenu and biMaximise</li>
<li>Create button on MainForm which creates and shows ChildForm</li>
<li>Run application</li>
<li>Click button</li>
<li>Maximise ChildForm</li>
<li>Close ChildForm (Has to be maximised otherwise malfunction does not occur)</li>
<li>Observe that MainForm's menu is now right-aligned with an unclickable 'Minimise' icon on the left If biMinimise is added to ChildForm's BorderIcons, the problem disappears.</li>

It seems by default the mx forms are arranged to the label is above the form input item. In Spark they are arranged next to each other. Also the label in spark forms are bold by default.</p>

<p>For example MX code could be</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mx:Form width=""100%""&gt;
    &lt;mx:FormItem indicatorGap=""0""&gt;
        &lt;s:Label text=""label1""/&gt;
         &lt;s:TextInput id=""input1"" width=""180""/&gt;
    &lt;/mx:FormItem&gt;
&lt;/mx:Form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For Spark it could be</p>

<pre><code>&lt;s:Form&gt;
    &lt;s:layout&gt;
        &lt;s:FormLayout gap=""-10"" paddingLeft=""-10"" paddingRight=""-10""/&gt;

    &lt;s:FormItem label=""label1""&gt;

    &lt;/s:FormItem&gt;
&lt;/s:Form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now my problem is the look of each form.</p>

<p>The spark form's labels are bold. Ideally I want to be able to use a spark form and have it positioned both horizontally and vertically and not have a bold label. Is this possible? </p>

<p>This will remove me having both spark and mx forms in my application. </p>

<p>Alternatively is it possible to make mx forms position horizontally?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Following the answer here is an example of a spark form positioned vertically</p>

            // Here Set Width of each th from gridview to new table th

    }

<p>It works perfect when the window is maximized but when I re-size the browser and the browser scroll bar appears, the header will obey both scroll bars (the one from the div and the one from the browser) making the header to move as well when I scroll with the browser scroll bar thus making the fixed header off like what you see below!<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PTMkP.png"" alt=""![enter image description here"">]<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PTMkP.png"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>. </p>

My process so far has been fairly manual, something like below, which is fine for one variable/factor with say 2-5 levels. But it is not scalable to condition on factors with many levels or on multiple factors.</p>

<p>Is there any kind of ""group by"" or ""subset"" functionality within the forecast package that would help? I started writing a program to do the below process in the most general case (i.e. for any number of factors and levels) but have not been too successful yet.</p>

<p>BTW, unfortunately my data is private and I cannot share it here. But it shouldn't really matter, because the code below works and I'm looking for a better, i.e. scalable, solution.</p>

<pre><code># Example code

# category is a factor with levels A and B; amt is the variable to model/forecast
# using data.table syntax to create a vector for each category
vec1 &lt;- dt[category == 'A']$amount
vec2 &lt;- dt[category == 'B']$amount

# Create ts objects from above vectors
ts1 &lt;- ts(vec1, start=c(start_year, start_month), end=c(end_year, end_month), frequency=12)
ts2 &lt;- ts(vec2, start=c(start_year, start_month), end=c(end_year, end_month), frequency=12)

<p>First of all, I created page <code>login/facebook</code> which redirects user to the URL: <code>https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=MY_ID&amp;redirect_uri=https://www.domain.com/connect/facebook&amp;scope=email,user_about_me,user_location</code></p>

<p>So far so good. Have no problems at this stage.</p>

<p>If user authorize my application, he gets redirected to the www.domain.com/connect/facebook page. On this page I create user in my database using data returned by FB or just authorize user and create session. On this step I have issues. When I use code from the examples from Facebook Developers Help Page everything works:</p>

<pre><code>$token_url = ""https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?client_id=""
    . $this-&gt;app_id . ""&amp;redirect_uri="" . urlencode($my_url) . ""&amp;client_secret=""
    . $this-&gt;secret . ""&amp;code="" . $code;
$access_token = file_get_contents($token_url);
$graph_url = ""https://graph.facebook.com/me?"" . $access_token;
$user_object = json_decode(file_get_contents($graph_url));
</code></pre>

<p>When I use following snippet everything works perfectly. However I prefer to use PHP-SDK and having problems. When I use following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>$session = $this-&gt;facebook-&gt;getSession();
var_dump($session);
            if( $session )
            {
                try
                {
                    $uid = $this-&gt;facebook-&gt;getUser();
                    $me = $this-&gt;facebook-&gt;api('/me');

                    var_dump('me');
                }
                catch (FacebookApiException $e)
                {
                    error_log($e);
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>session is null. Anybody has any suggestions?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>
After having some fun with PHP-SDK I noticed some funny stuff:
When I use SDK getLoginUrl() method to generate redirect URL, it seems to be partially working.</p>

<pre><code>$login_url = $this-&gt;facebook-&gt;getLoginUrl(
        array(
            'api_key' =&gt; $this-&gt;api_key,
            'req_perms' =&gt; 'email,user_work_history,user_about_me,user_location',
            'next' =&gt; 'https://www.domain.com/connect/facebook'
        )
    );
</code></pre>

<p>Now when users authorizes my app, he's being redirected to correct page with some params, URL looks like:
<code>https://www.domain.com/connect/facebook?session={""session_key""%3A""11111111111-111111111""%2C""uid""%3A""11111111""%2C""expires""%3A0%2C""secret""%3A""111111111""%2C""base_domain""%3A""domain.com""%2C""access_token""%3A""1111111|222222.0-33333|sdvsdvsdvsdvsdv""%2C""sig""%3A""gsdbsdbsdbsdbsdbsdbsdb""}</code></p>

<p>Anyone has any idea why it's not hashes or it shouldn't?</p>

Marek</p>

<p>Example of the jQuery child selector:</p>

<pre><code>$('ul &gt; li')

<p>Example of jQuery child selector without parent:</p>

<pre><code>$('&gt; li')
</code></pre>

<p>The second example above doesn't work. However I can't remember if I saw it in the past before or I've seen something advance like:</p>

<pre><code>$('ul').not('&gt;li')
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't really work either (but doesn't pop up an error message, so it's just ignored?)</p>

<p>So my question is would you <strong>EVER</strong> use a child selector without a parent, and have it be a valid jQuery selector.</p>

<p>Thanks, sorry if question is dumb. :)</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Along with Nick's jQuery.find example on the bottom, another use case is</p>

<pre><code>$('ul:has(&gt;li)')
</code></pre>

<p>Note: that $('ul').has('>li') is wrong and should be written </p>

<pre><code>$('ul').has('ul&gt;li')
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>AND for not()</p>

<p>Not sure if I have it correct, but you wouldn't ever use a > inside of not() directy because not() only concern about one element, while > compares multiple elements. However you can do something like</p>

<pre><code>$('li:not(:has(&gt;p))'

<p>To get a cpu time I wrote a function <code>getrusage()</code> with <code>RUSAGE_SELF</code>, for wall time i use <code>clock_gettime</code> with <code>MONOTONIC</code>, to get cycles/byte I use <code>rdtsc</code>. </p>

<p>I process an input buffer of size, for example, 1024: <code>char buffer[1024]</code>. How do I benchmark:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do a warm-up phase, simply call <code>fun2measure(args)</code> 1000 times:</li>
</ol>

<p><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;1000; i++)
    fun2measure(args);</code></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Then, do a real-timing benchmark, for wall time:</p>

<p>`unsigned long i;
double timeTaken;
double timeTotal = 3.0; // process 3 seconds</p>

<p>for (timeTaken=(double)0, i=0; timeTaken &lt;= timeTotal; timeTaken = walltime(1), i++)
    fun2measure(args); `</p></li>
<li><p>And for cpu time (almost the same):</p>

<p><code>for (timeTaken=(double)0, i=0; timeTaken &lt;= timeTotal; timeTaken = walltime(1), i++)
         fun2measure(args);</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>But when I want to get a cpu cycle count for function, I use this piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>`unsigned long s = cyclecount();
    for (timeTaken=(double)0, i=0; timeTaken &lt;= timeTotal; timeTaken = walltime(1), i++)
    {
        fun2measure(args);
    }
    unsigned long e = cyclecount();

unsigned long s = cyclecount();
    for (timeTaken=(double)0, i=0; timeTaken &lt;= timeTotal; timeTaken = cputime(1), i++)
    {
        fun2measure(args);
    }
    unsigned long e = cyclecount();`
</code></pre>

<p>and then, count cycles/byte: <code>((e - s) / (i * inputsSize);</code>. Here <code>inputsSize</code> is 1024 because its the length of the <code>buffer</code>. But when I rise <code>totalTime</code> to 10s I ge strange results:</p>

<p>for 10s:</p>

<pre><code>Did fun2measure 1148531 times in 10.00 seconds for 1024 bytes, 0 cycles/byte [CPU]
Did fun2measure 1000221 times in 10.00 seconds for 1024 bytes, 3.000000 cycles/byte [WALL]
</code></pre>

<p>for 5s:</p>

<pre><code>Did fun2measure 578476 times in 5.00 seconds for 1024 bytes, 0 cycles/byte [CPU]
Did fun2measure 499542 times in 5.00 seconds for 1024 bytes, 7.000000 cycles/byte [WALL]
</code></pre>

<p>for 4s:</p>

<pre><code>Did fun2measure 456828 times in 4.00 seconds for 1024 bytes, 4 cycles/byte [CPU]
Did fun2measure 396612 times in 4.00 seconds for 1024 bytes, 3.000000 cycles/byte [WALL]
</code></pre>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are those results ok? </li>
<li>Why when I increase time I always get 0 cycles/byte in cpu?</li>
<li>How can I measure average time, mean, standard deviation etc statistics for such benchmarking?</li>
<li>Is my benchmarking method 100% ok?</li>
</ol>

<p>CHEERS!</p>

<p><strong>1st EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>After changing <code>i</code> to <code>double</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Did fun2measure 1138164.00 times in 10.00 seconds for 1024 bytes, 0.410739 cycles/byte [CPU]

<p>I have a very large database and in my Accounts Entity I have a firstname column. When a user searches for an account by first name, it is possible that they may be using a nickname. For example searching for Bob, should also return Robert. </p>

<p>The way I would think to do this would be to create a table called nickname, with two columns, the nickname, and name. That way we map bob->robert. </p>

<p>Then when doing the query make the where clause look like this ""WHERE firstname IN (SELECT name FROM nickname WHERE nickname = 'bob')"" </p>

<p>The two problems I have is, the query above seems very inefficient, and would be very slow over large data sets (I could be wrong here so please tell me if so, when I say large data set I mean 14 million rows). </p>

<p>What I need to do in A is to fill all the missing dates (from minimum date to maximum date of A) for each object with value as 0. Once the missing dates and their corresponding values (0) are in, I want to sum up the values for each date, so that no date repeats - for each sublist. </p>

<p>Now, What I am trying to goes as follows: I am breaking up A's dates and values separately (in lists named u and v) and converting each sublist into a pandas Series, and allocating their respective indices to them. So for each zip(u,v):</p>

<pre><code>def generate(values, indices):

    indices = flatten(indices)

    date_index = DatetimeIndex(indices)
    ts = Series(values, index=date_index)

    ts.reindex(date_range(min(date_index), max(date_index)))

    return ts
</code></pre>

<p>But in here, the reindexing is causing raising an exception. What I am looking for is a purely pythonic way (without pandas) which is totally based on either list comprehension or maybe even numpy arrays.</p>

<p>There is another issue of aggregation over hours, which means that if all the dates are same and only the hours are different then I want to fill in all the missing hours of the day and then repeat the same process of aggregation over each hour, with missing hours filled in with 0 values.</p>

<pre><code>.container{
  position: relative;
  height: 100%;
}

#top-div{
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 50%;
}

#bottom-div{
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 50%;
}

#round-image{
  position: absolute;
  left: 35%;
  top: 30%;
  z-index: 20;
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The original class was a POJO that contained logic for moving from one room to another in a text-based console game. Literally, it was a class that held some string triggers that would fire the action (eg. the user types ""walk right""), a description, and a pointer to the new Location.</p>

<p>The current, non generic version of the class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Navigation implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private String trigger;
    private String description;
    private Location target;

    public Navigation() {
        this("""", """", new Location());
    }

    public Navigation(String trigger, String description, Location target) {
        this.trigger = trigger;
        this.description = description;
        this.target = target;
    }

    // plus getters, setters, etc.
}
</code></pre>

<p>(The <code>Location</code> class is another POJO that describes a location. It is irrelevant.)</p>

<p>I want to extend the <code>Navigation</code> class to be able to handle targets that are not <code>Location</code>s. I thought that the best way to do this would be to convert the <code>Navigation</code> class to use generics, so I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Navigation&lt;T&gt; implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 2L;
    private String trigger;
    private String description;
    private T target;

    public Navigation() {
        this("""", """", new T());
    }

    public Navigation(String trigger, String description, T target) {
        this.trigger = trigger;
        this.description = description;
        this.target = target;
    }

    // plus getters, setters, etc.
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this doesn't compile at the line <code>this("""", """", new T());</code> because <code>T</code> cannot be instantiated. Is is possible to instantiate the generic type object in this context?</p>

<p>The documentation also tells me:</p>

<pre><code>Info: Because the code generator needs to save the generated code into files, it is
required that the Web process have the permission to create and modify the corresponding
 files. For simplicity, we may give the Web process the write permission to the whole

</code></pre>

<p>This makes sense to me and I understand the basic logic of Linux permissions as applied to users and groups ... but not processes. Can someone point me to a primer on how to give the Gii process write permissions to the webroot (in my case:/var/www/html/blog/) directory?</p>

<p>Suppose I have a table as under</p>

<pre><code>Declare @t table(Number Int)
Insert Into @t Values(10),(20),(30),(40),(18)

Number
10
20
30
40
18
</code></pre>

<p>and I need to look for a number say 35 (or closest).</p>

<pre><code>Declare @NumberToLookfor = 35
</code></pre>

<p>Now the search will happen based on the weight of combination for two pairs. Let me explain.</p>

<pre><code>10+20 = 30

10+30 = 40

10+40 = 50

10+18 = 28

20 + 30 = 50

20 + 40 = 60

20 + 18 = 38

30 + 40 = 70

30 + 18 = 48

40 + 18 = 58
</code></pre>

<p>so we can figure out that the weight of any two numbers are teh candidates here e.g. (10,20), (10,30)...(40,18)</p>

<p>Once we get that, the first 3 closest pairs will be (20,18), (10,20) , (10,30) in this case. Because teh dirtance between 35 and 38 (20+18) is 3 whichle it is 5 for the other pairs  (10,20) , (10,30).</p>

<p>I think that the explanation is clear to understand what I am looking for.(If not please let me know)</p>

<p>What is the most efficient way of doing so?</p>

<p>My attempt</p>

<pre><code>Declare @t table(Number Int)
Insert Into @t Values(10),(20),(30),(40),(18)

;WITH Cte1 (Number,Ids,TotalWeight) AS 
( 
    SELECT  Number           
            , ',' + CAST(Number AS VARCHAR(MAX)) 
            ,CAST(Number AS INT) 
    FROM @t 
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT  p.Number 
            ,c.Ids + ',' +  CAST(p.Number AS VARCHAR(MAX)) 
            ,CAST(c.TotalWeight + p.Number AS INT)            
    FROM @t AS p JOIN Cte1 c ON p.Number &lt; c.Number
),Cte2 AS( 
    SELECT          
        *
        ,DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ABS(TotalWeight - 35)) [rank] 
    FROM Cte1 
    WHERE (LEN(Ids) - LEN(REPLACE(Ids, ',', '')))/LEN(',') = 2 
)

select *
from Cte2 where [rank] &lt;= 2
</code></pre>

<p>It works.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SIrU6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But if the values grows very big say more than 50 or so, then it becomes very very in efficient. Because in the first CTE , I am finding out the full permutation and in the second Cte choosing those values where only two elements participated.</p>

<p>so when the value grows big, the first Cte behaves very very slowly.</p>

<p>Is there any other way of doing so even for big tables.</p>

<p>This plots a straight line graph... perhaps I am misunderstanding the physics, but is there a problem with the code?</p>

<p>FYI - I have calculated the equations for acceleration using the Newton's law of gravitation and some laws of geometry. I'm mainly asking about issues in the code, but if any physicists out there notice any issues in the physics, then I'd love to hear them!</p>

<br>
e.g <br>my <code>UIViewController</code> receives an event and i change <code>UILabels</code> size. from bigger to smaller. The size of my <code>UILabel</code> gets smaller and i get the correct needed size, but the text in my <code>UILabel</code> stays the same, the same font size and etc. I need the font to get smaller, for the whole text to fit the <code>UILabel</code>. So the question is how to make the text to fit my label with <code>autoshrinking</code> or something like that?</p>

<p>In my <code>xib</code>, <code>UILabels</code> <code>autoshrink</code> is checked, also <strong>number of lines</strong> is set to 0, and also my string has new line symbols (\n), and i've selected <strong>linebreakmode</strong> to <code>wordwrap</code>. Maybe anyone was in the same situation as i am now, and could help me? I would really appreciate that.</p>

<p>Thank's in advance!</p>

Each of command have each handler, respectively <code>playHandler</code> and <code>stopHandler</code> (these are extending <code>AbstractHandler</code> class).</p>

<p>These commands are contributed to my view's toolbar in Button style. Basically what I want is initially the <code>PLAY_COMMAND</code> is active but the <code>STOP_COMMAND</code> not. When the <code>PLAY_COMMAND</code> is clicked, then it will activate the <code>STOP_COMMAND</code> then deactivate itself(<code>PLAY_COMMAND</code>). And vice versa when the <code>STOP_COMMAND</code> clicked.</p>

<p>So what I do is like this. At first it works (I clicked play-button, then stop-button is activated and play-button disabled. I clicked stop-button, then play-button is active and stop-button is disabled. But when I clicked the play-button again, the play-button is still active when the stop-button is active too). So what's wrong with my code here:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>private AbstractHandler playHandler, stopHandler, pauseHandler, stepHandler;
private IHandlerActivation playActivation, stopActivation, pauseActivation, stepActivation;
private void createHandlers(){
  final IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService)getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);
    playHandler = new AbstractHandler() {

      @Override
      public Object execute(ExecutionEvent event) throws ExecutionException {
        handlerService.deactivateHandler(playActivation);
        if(stopActivation == null){
          stopActivation = handlerService.activateHandler(STOP_COMMAND_ID, stopHandler);
        } else {
          handlerService.activateHandler(stopActivation);
        }
        return null;
      }
    };

    stopHandler = new AbstractHandler() {

      @Override
      public Object execute(ExecutionEvent event) throws ExecutionException {
        handlerService.deactivateHandler(stopActivation);
        handlerService.activateHandler(playActivation);
        return null;
      }
    };  
    playActivation = handlerService.activateHandler(PLAY_COMMAND_ID, playHandler);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>createHandlers()</code> method is called at the end of <code>createPartControl(Composite parent)</code> method in my View.</p>

<p>This method will return a List which I am iterating it in a for loop in normal way. I can have empty <code>serverList</code> if everything is null, instead of having four null values in my list. In my above code, <code>getLocalIP</code>, <code>getLocalAddress</code>, <code>getRemoteIP</code> and <code>getRemoteAddress</code> can return null and then it will add null  element in the linked list. I know I can add a if check but then I need to add if check four time just before adding to Linked List. Is there any better data structure which I can use here?</p>

<p>Imagine that Thread A runs the <strong>notify()</strong> just before return a given value:</p>

<pre><code>public class baz{

    // Thread B runs this:
    public synchronized void bar(){
       wait();
    } 

    // Thread A runs this:
    public synchronized int foo(){
       notify();
       return 11;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>notify()</strong> will be called before Thread A releases the lock (that will occurs ""after"" the <strong>return 11</strong>; statement). 
So, how could a Thread B, that is waiting for this lock (via <strong>wait()</strong> method), acquire the lock that is still held by Thread A? 
Note that, when thread B is notified the lock has not yet been released by Thread A.</p>

<p>So what I think of this situation is the following:</p>

<p>After calling <strong>wait()</strong>, Thread B will change its state from <strong>Running</strong> to <strong>Waiting</strong>.
After receiving the notification (from Thread A <strong>notify()</strong> method), Thread B will return from <strong>wait()</strong>, change its state to <strong>Runnable</strong> and try to acquire the lock. Since the lock is not yet released by Thread A, Thread B will be blocked on the object's monitor and pass its state from <strong>Runnable</strong> to <strong>Blocked</strong>.
Eventually, after Thread A releases the lock, Thread B will acquire the lock and pass its state from <strong>Blocked</strong> to <strong>Running</strong>.</p>

<p>Is this right? What I want to understand with this question is <em>what happens</em> to a thread that returns from  a <strong>wait()</strong> which is synchronized by an already acquired lock. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>if I define an <code>OnClickListener</code> on a view of the listview's item, the <code>MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN</code> on the listview doesn't get triggered anymore</p></li>
<li><p>If I remove the listener, the <code>MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN</code> gets triggered no problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like the ACTION_DOWN is ""stolen"" by the child view.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong></p>

<p>How can I achieve both these things?</p>

<ul>
<li>detect the ACTION_DOWN on the listview</li>
<li>detect clicks on views on a list item</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>HERE SOME CODE:</strong></p>

<p>I am overriding the <code>onTouchEvent</code> on a <code>ListView</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
    switch (ev.getAction()) {
        case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE:
            ...
            break;
        case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
            ...
            break;
    }

    return super.onTouchEvent(ev);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I am also defining a click listener on the item</p>

<pre><code>@Override public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    View rowView = convertView;

    if (rowView == null) {
        ...
        rowView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.item_routesresults, null);
        ...
    }

    ViewHolder holder = (ViewHolder) rowView.getTag();
    ...
    rowView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        public void onClick(View v) {
            ...
        }
    });
    ....

    return rowView;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I just verified that if I define the click on the item using <code>setOnItemClickListener</code> on the listview instead of defining <code>setOnItemClickListener</code> directly on the item view, <code>MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN</code> on the listview gets triggered:</p>

<pre><code>mListView.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view, int position, long id) {
        ...
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone explain why defining the click directly on the view, prevents the ACTION_DOWN to trigger on the listview?</p>

<ol>
<li>A main module which handles the login, page templates, loading and showing the menu and so on. </li>
<li>Another module handles the business specific views and logic, for instance: Employee.xhtml</li>
</ol>

<p>So after the user passes the authentication, in the index page, he/she want to navigate to Employee.xhtml page which is in the second module (So it is deployed on tomcat in the separate war file).</p>

<p>In this situation, when I deploy both WAR files on tomcat, main application cannot find the Employee.xhtml in the second WAR file, or something like this. I'm getting this error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ git status<br>
  # On branch master<br>
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by [x] commits.<br>
  #</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several questions about this on SO already, but none seem to specifically address the type of scenario I have. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2432579/git-your-branch-is-ahead-by-x-commits/3323933#3323933"">This answer</a> to one of the questions comes closest, but doesn't go into detail.</p>

<p>I'll just quote it verbatim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you get this message after doing a ""git pull remote branch"", try following it up with a ""git fetch"".</p>
  
  <p>Fetch seems to update the local representation of the remote branch, which doesn't necessarily happen when you do a ""git pull remote branch"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That tip does indeed work. But ""doesn't necessarily happen?"" Why not? I need to understand this. What is pull not doing?</p>

<p>I don't want to take over that question, so here's my scenario in detail:</p>

<p>Three computers involved. The Mac on which I develop, my home server where the git repo (i.e. origin/master) lives and a Webfaction account that pulls from that server.</p>

<p>I do commits and <code>git push origin master</code> only on the Mac. The only command that ever gets run on Webfaction as part of the normal workflow is <code>git pull origin master</code> (as part of a Fabric deployment script). I don't modify code there. I'm a lone developer, so neither does anyone else.</p>

<p>Every now and then I log in to Webfaction and check on things, including a <code>git status</code>. Inevitably, I always get the ""Your branch is ahead..."" message. Running <code>git fetch</code> makes the message go away.</p>

<p>I'm about to add <code>git fetch</code> to the Fabric script to be done with this issue, but I want to know why that needs to be done, especially on a pull-only clone of origin/master. I'm not deeply versed in Git though I use the basic functionality daily, so a newbie-friendly explanation would be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> as requested, the relevant bits from <code>config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[remote ""origin""]
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    url = git@[server_address]:[path/to/repo.git]

<p>One of the best solutions I have come up with is to mark the movie/song as listened/watched if the use has played more than X seconds in the last 10% of the file. Then I would be reasonable to assume he has listened to most of it and/or listened/watched what he wanted.</p>

<p>However, all the solutions above are bad, and I would really like some input</p>

<p>I have played with the libraries imports. The idea behind: older version of Android might handle jars in a different way. No success here.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning, that the app is an update of a previous version already using Guava. The previous version worked fine on all devices, but wasn't using the ImmutableSortedMap object rather just an ImmutableList.
Would it be possible that the phone is loading his own version of the Guava library (that might not contains ImmutableSortedMap)?</p>

Our DB farm is properly setup with MySQL Fabric and I'm attempting to implement the client/connector.</p>

<p>I have a JNDI resource declared in my server.xml file which has a MySQL Fabric-based URL and Driver, and uses connection pooling with hibernate.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Resource
name=""jdbc/myApp""
type=""javax.sql.DataSource""
driverClassName=""com.mysql.fabric.jdbc.FabricMySQLDriver""
maxWait=""1000""
url=""proper.fabric.url/fabricServerGroup=myFabricGroup""
maxActive=""45""
validationQuery=""select 1 from dual""
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm having is that the connection pooling and Fabric do not play well together.  After taking down the master DB, Fabric automatically promotes a slave as expected.  However, when I attempt to make a new connection to the DB I'm getting old now-defunct connections back, most notably I'm getting a read-only connection back when I'm requesting readwrite. As additional info if I restart my Tomcat server and ask for a fresh connection I get the correct results. The problem I'm having specifically occurs because of connection pooling.</p>

<p>What I need to know is if there's a key/value pair which I'm missing that would make my FabricDriver smart enough to know to wipe the connection pool when automatic failover occurs.</p>

<p>The best I've found is to use testOnBorrow, which unfortunately can only use a SELECT query (via validationQuery), which still succeeds when I'm getting a read-only connection back despite <em>asking</em> for readwrite.</p>

<p>Has anybody solved this issue before?</p>

<p>Note: If I attempt to use com.mysql.fabric.jdbc.FabricMySQLDataSource I can't even successfully make any connections.  The regular javax.sql.DataSource seems to be the correct value here.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>everything works but print, how do I wait until the page loads the dynamic html with blank URL, then print?</p>

<p>I don't think there is a way to do it, like the user below me the onload wont fire probably because as soon as the window opened the page was already loaded. What I'm trying to do is load the entire page FIRST then print. The script I posted doesn't do this.</p>

<p>Martin, using your code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
var win = window.open();
win.document.body.innerHTML = ""&lt;img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Willaerts_Adam_The_Embarkation_of_the_Elector_Palantine_Oil_Canvas-huge.jpg'/&gt;"";
win.print();
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In chrome it prints a blank page.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Martin, the onload img attribute did the trick.  Heres what I did to modify the script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
 var win = window.open();
 var html = ""this is some test html &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Willaerts_Adam_The_Embarkation_of_the_Elector_Palantine_Oil_Canvas-huge.jpg'/&gt;"";
 html = html.replace(""&lt;img "",""&lt;img onload='window.print();' "");
 win.document.body.innerHTML = html;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So all img tags will add a onload=window.print.  But really only one of them needs a onload (I'm pretty sure....). But to give you more information, in my scenario the variable html could be an infinite number of images, random text,tables, etc.  It could be anything.  Thank you Martin for having the patience to re-read this thread and reply.</p>

Sorry for the length of his code snippet but I figure too much information is better than not enough in this case. </p>

<p>So I'm asking if there's a better way to do it.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is making an object constructor return something else rather than a new instance.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what I'm trying to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>$GLOBALS['object_cache']=array();

class Test {
    public function __construct($id=0){
        if(isset( $GLOBALS['object_cache'][$id] ))
            return $GLOBALS['object_cache'][$id];
        $GLOBALS['object_cache'][$id]=$this;
    }
}

$t0=new Test(0);
$t1=new Test(1);
$t01=new Test(0);
// modifying $t01 would presumably also modify $t0
</code></pre>

<p>The easy (but ugly?) fix:</p>

<pre><code>$GLOBALS['object_cache']=array();

class Test {
    public static function create($id=0){
        if(isset( $GLOBALS['object_cache'][$id] ))
            return $GLOBALS['object_cache'][$id];
        $new=new Test();
        $GLOBALS['object_cache'][$id]=$new;
        return $new;
    }
}

$t0=Test::create(0);
$t1=Test::create(1);
$t01=Test::create(0);
// modifying $t01 would presumably also modify $t0
</code></pre>

<p>What do you guys think? Example 1 doesn't work, by the way; it returns a new instance regardless of the return statement.</p>

<p>So am I missing something, or is the better way the second one?</p>

<p>PS: No need stating the obvious about patterns (factory/singleton)...</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/t9Vhn.png"" alt=""Constraint pin""></p>

<p><em>The constraint for leading space is the same effectively. The value of constraint is <strong>42.0 points</strong>.</em></p>

<p>This is exactly what I want, because for different devices I can change <code>layoutMargins</code> property on <code>UIView</code> and the constraints will work correctly, to increase margin between views.</p>

<p>Now I want to add another view in code that would also have both leading and trailing space pinned to it's superview margin, so the same <code>layoutMargins</code> set to superview will work.</p>

<p>I pinned the view using <strong>visual format language</strong> with the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *constraints = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@""|-42.0-[separatorView]-42.0-|"" options:0 metrics:nil views:NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(self.contentView, separatorView)];

[self.contentView addConstraints:constraints];
[self.contentView setNeedsUpdateConstraints];
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but <code>layoutMargins</code> property has no effect using this constraint, so it is obviously not pinned to margin, but directly to superview.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p><strong>How to pin UI element spaces to margin in code using visual format language? Or if not possible, how to pin with <code>constraintWithItem:attribute:relatedBy:toItem:attribute:multiplier:constant:</code> API?</strong></p>

I have a function that they can trigger to send me the entire db, and it's as if it just randomly resets itself.

<p>I suspect, I am also facing same problem. To verify, I need to come up with g++ command which will build the files in above manner. I have tried executing following commands but it does not reproduce the said behavior. </p>

<p>Could you please help to achieve the same effect. I have tried running makefile -n to print commands but it does not print all commands and stops after building dynamic library. </p>

  AND St + Tm - YEAR(NOW()) &gt;= '30' 
HAVING usP BETWEEN 300/2 AND 300 
ORDER BY ak

</code></pre>

<p>Using an <strong>Index (Type, tn, act, flA)</strong>, I am able to obtain results within <strong>800ms</strong>. In <strong>QUERY 2</strong>, I changed the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause to <code>lv</code>, I am also able to obtain results within similar timings. In <strong>QUERY 3</strong>, I changed the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause to <code>ID</code> and the query time slowed dramatically to a full <strong>20s</strong> on an average of 10 trials.</p>

<p>Running the <code>EXPLAIN SELECT</code> statement produces exactly the same query execution plan:</p>

<pre><code>*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: P

</code></pre>

<p>My question is: <strong>why does ordering by ID in QUERY 3 runs so slow compared to the rest?</strong></p>

<p>The partial table definition is as such:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `PIG` (
  `ID` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `lv` smallint(3) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `ak` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',

  PRIMARY KEY (`ID`),
  KEY `id_ca` (`cty`,`ak`),
  KEY `Index` (`Type`, `tn`, `act`, `flA`),
) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=5000001 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

CREATE TABLE `EEL` (
  `cur` char(3) NOT NULL,
  `usD` decimal(11,10) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`cur`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE: After extensive testing of various <code>ORDER BY</code>s options, I have confirmed that the ID column which happens to be the Primary Key is the only one causing the slow query time.</p>

<p>In Q, you create a promise with</p>

<pre><code>var myPromise = Q.fcall(myFunction);
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>myFunction</code> will be invoked asynchronously, a promise is placed in the <code>myPromise</code> variable and the code execution continues.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/%24q"" rel=""nofollow"">only example</a> Angular gives for creating a promise is using javascript <code>timeout</code> function, which to me seems like a verbose hack compared to the above Q example. So in Angular I would write</p>

<pre><code>function asyncWorker(name) {
  var deferred = $q.defer();

  setTimeout(function() {
    scope.$apply(function() {
      deferred.resolve(myFunction);
    });
  }, 1000);

  return deferred.promise;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above would be identical to the one-liner at the top.</p>

<p>I hoped that <code>$q.fcall</code> would have worked but I get:</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$q.fcall(function() { return 'a'; })')

<p>I'd like to add a new worksheet using the API shown <a href=""https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/#adding_a_worksheet"" rel=""nofollow"">in the docs</a>. This requires a <code>POST</code> request with the rather strange <code>Content-type: application/atom+xml</code>, which I do like this (JQuery):</p>

<p>This makes Chrome issue a preflight request due to CORS requirements. The preflight <code>OPTIONS</code> request fails - Google does not include <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> headers in the response, and Chrome refuses to go forward:</p>

<pre><code>OPTIONS https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/.../private/full 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access.
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I make a straight <code>GET</code> to the same URL (this is actually how you read the spreadsheet), I <strong>do</strong> get the <code>Access-Control-*</code> headers, which means that CORS support was intended. The same with <code>POST</code> requests with standard content types (like <code>text/plain</code>) which don't trigger a preflight <code>OPTIONS</code> - I get the CORS headers (even though the request fails do to the bad content type).</p>

<p>Does anybody have an idea how to work around this problem, or the ""correct"" way to do it from a browser? Alternatively, a pointer towards any piece of working code that is able to do 'write' operations to Google spreadsheets from in-browser JS would also be great.</p>

<p>I would like to keep this application client-side only if possible - I understand that with a server-side component handling Google API interaction, this thing would be easier.</p>

<p>I've got a high level idea of how to make an insert at the beginning O(1) and make the O(n) inserts on average of O(n/2) but I'm not sure it's possible with the underlying array structure.</p>

<p><strong>My Idea</strong></p>

<p>Since the ArrayList is actually just a larger array that ""resizes"" itself when it reaches a threshold why couldn't it resize itself at both the front and end of the list rather than only at the end? This would allow inserts at the beginning to be O(1) while also allowing you to rewrite an insert in the middle to take the shortest route to insert itself. (For instance if your inserting at index 1, it would be easier to move 0 over than to move 2 to n).</p>

<p>The answer I think to why Sun didn't do this originally is because of the way the Arrays.CopyOf and by extension System.arrayCopy are written. Both start at the beginning of the list and copy into a larger array. I've taken a look at the Sun source code for these two methods but it gets a little advanced for my Java skill level.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>In my mind there are two main questions as to whether this would work or not:</p>

<p>1) Firstly, can Arrays.CopyOf or System.arrayCopy be rewritten/overloaded to insert a subarray into the middle of a larger array?</p>

<p>2) What would the Big O ramifications of doing that be?</p>

<p>So is this a good idea or am I missing something obvious that would make this unworkable?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>First, I tested that the authentication worked:</p>

<pre><code>AuthUserFile E:/path-to/.htpasswd
AuthType Basic
AuthName ""Secure area""
Require valid-user
</code></pre>

<p>This worked nicely, but of course did not send the credentials over SSL. I tried using a RewriteRule to send any requests without HTTPS over to HTTPS in either of those folders, and this requires the user to login twice - once over HTTP and once over HTTPS.</p>

<p>I found tons of people with this issue, and the solution most folks use is like this:</p>

<pre><code>SSLOptions +StrictRequire
SSLRequireSSL
SSLRequire  %{HTTP_HOST} eq ""www.domain.com""
AuthUserFile E:/path-to/.htpasswd
AuthName ""Secure area""
AuthType basic
require valid-user
ErrorDocument 403 https://www.domain.com/secure-area
</code></pre>

<p>So I put this into an htaccess inside each of the two secure folders. This requires the user to login once, over HTTPS, as it should, but of course it does not send them to the file they have requested. Rather, it sends them to the root of the folder.</p>

<p>We often direct users to specific files inside these directories, and I just can't find anything that will authenticate them with basic auth over HTTPS when trying to do this. Is this possible on Apache?</p>

<p>Here is simple example:</p>

<pre><code>-module(my_module).
-compile(export_all).

    do_apply( X, F ) -&gt; F( X ).
</code></pre>

<p>First of all - test on single node:    </p>

<pre><code>1&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X) -&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], lists:seq(1,10000)] ).
{208198,
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>After that I've connected second node (second erlang shell process in my OS):</p>

<pre><code>(foo@Stemm.local)24&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X) -&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], lists:seq(1,10000)] ).
{446284,
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally I've connected third node:</p>

<pre><code>(foo@Stemm.local)26&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X) -&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], lists:seq(1,10000)] ).

  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>So - I've got <strong>worse performance with three nodes vs. single node</strong>. </p>

<p>I'm realize that there is some overhead for communication between nodes. But how can I understand in which cases is better to perform calculations on multiple nodes?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>My step-by-step test from shell:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; c(my_module).
{ok,my_module}
2&gt;  
2&gt; List = lists:seq(1,10000).
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
 23,24,25,26,27,28,29|...]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Test performance on single node:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>3&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X)-&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], List] ).
{207346,
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>Entrance to network environment:</p>

<pre><code>4&gt; net_kernel:start([one]).
{ok,&lt;0.20066.0&gt;}
(one@Stemm.local)5&gt; erlang:set_cookie(node(), foobar).
true
</code></pre>

<p>Add second node:</p>

<pre><code>(one@Stemm.local)6&gt; net_kernel:connect('two@Stemm.local').
true
(one@Stemm.local)7&gt; 
(one@Stemm.local)7&gt; nodes().
['two@Stemm.local']
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Test performance with two nodes:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(one@Stemm.local)8&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X)-&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], List] ).
{510733,
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,
  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p>Connect third node:</p>

<pre><code>(one@Stemm.local)9&gt; net_kernel:connect('three@Stemm.local').
true
(one@Stemm.local)10&gt; nodes().
['two@Stemm.local',
 'three@Stemm.local']
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Test performance with three nodes:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(one@Stemm.local)11&gt; timer:tc( rpc, pmap, [{my_module, do_apply}, [fun(X)-&gt; timer:sleep(10), X end], List] ).
{496278,

  23,24,25,26,27|...]}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I guess that performance decreases because I'm creating each node as a new erlang-shell process in the same physical machine. But I don't know exactly if I'm right.</p>

I tried to follow a lot of tutorials but its seems this is never what I want to do.</p>

<p>In the source code there is: </p>

<pre><code>var _gaq = _gaq || [];
_gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-00000000-1']);
_gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'mydomain.com']);
_gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

(function () {
    var ga = document.createElement('script');
    ga.type = 'text/javascript';
    ga.async = true;
    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://' : 'http://') + 'stats.g.doubleclick.net/dc.js';
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);
</code></pre>

<p>Is that enough to track the click event?</p>

<p>Then should I write:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""myLink"" target=""_blank"" onClick=""_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','partner link', 'Click']);""&gt;
    hello
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to get event tracking on that link?</p>

<pre><code>public void playSynth(SoundEffect se, int midiNote) {
    float pitch = (float)functions.getMIDIFreq(midiNote) / ((float)functions.getMIDIFreq(127)/2);
    pitch-=1F;
    Debug.WriteLine(""Note: {0}. Float: {1}"",midiNote,pitch);
    synth = se.CreateInstance();
    synth.IsLooped = false;
    synth.Pitch = pitch;
    synth.Play();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, the pitch played back is very off-key, because the math is wrong.  The way this function works is I'm sending a MIDI note (0 through 127) to the function, using a function I made called <a href=""http://pastebin.com/KJg6vrgQ"" rel=""nofollow"">getMIDIFreq</a> to convert that note to a frequency - which works fine.</p>

<p>To call this function, I'm using this:</p>

<pre><code>SoundEffect sound = SoundEffect.FromStream(TitleContainer.OpenStream(@""synth.wav""));
playSynth(sound,(int)midiNote);  //where midiNote is 0...127 number
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>synth.wav</code> is a simple C note I created in a DAW and exported.  The whole point of this program is to play back the MIDI note given in that synth sound, but I'd gladly settle for a sine wave, or anything really.  I can't use <code>Console.Beep</code> because it's extremely slow and not for playing entire songs with notes in rapid succession.</p>

<p>So my question is, how could I fix this code so it plays the sample at the right pitch?  I realize I only have 2 octaves to work with here, so if there's a solution that involves generating a tone at a given frequency and is very fast, that would be even better.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm making this a WinForms application, not an XNA game, but I have the framework downloaded and referenced in my project.</p>

<p>What I want to do is to provide a partial view with SignalR capability. Hence, when I use AJAX to load the partial view, I call the following function on success:</p>

<pre><code>function loadSuccess() {
    var chat = $.connection.chatHub;
    chat.writeMessage = function (msg) {
        $(""#messages"").append(""&lt;li&gt;"" + msg + ""&lt;/li&gt;"");
    }

    $(""#buttonSubmit"").click(function () {
        chat.broadcastMessage($(""#txtInput"").val());
    });

    $.connection.hub.start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The troublesome thing is that it does not seem to run (inserting an <code>alert('hi')</code> just after <code>var chat = ...</code> does not cause a dialog to show up after loading the partial view). However, if I run this piece of JavaScript once the entire DOM of the containing view is loaded (i.e., the partial view has not been loaded), the script runs perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any idea why I'm bumping into this problem?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Sure, this is how I call loadSuccess...</p>

<pre><code>@Ajax.ActionLink(""chat"", ""Index"", ""Chat"", ChatOpts)
</code></pre>

<p>...and the corresponding <code>ChatOpts</code>:</p>

<pre><code>AjaxOptions ChatOpts = new AjaxOptions
{
    UpdateTargetId = ""placeholder"",
    OnSuccess = ""loadSuccess""
};

<p>At the moment I have created 7 different builds for each resolution type and 3 variants in each for each of the 3 countries.</p>

<p>I am using LWUIT as my UI framework. I have configured MTJ with the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>antenna-bin-1.2.1-beta.jar </li>
<li>WTK2.5.2_01 </li>
<li>proguard4.8</li>
</ul>

<p>on Eclipse 3.7.2</p>

<ol>
<li>In the package explorer i right click on my project directory</li>
<li>select  'Export' (I couldn't find 'Export Antenna Build Files' under the 'Mobile Tools for Java' option)</li>
<li>I wait for it to do its thing.</li>
<li>I open the project folder and search for Build.xml. But can't find anything .</li>
<li>I find a folder called 'mtj-build' that contains another folder(custom-tasks) and two files mtj-build.properties and mtj-build.xml  .</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to able to write a build file that would be able to do the following</p>

<ol>
<li>put in the correct resources according to the resolution its building</li>
<li>put in the correct theme according to the resolution its building</li>
<li>set the relevant attributes in the Application Descriptor file for each country</li>
<li>repeat this process automatically for each resolution and each country and place the respective .Jad and .Jar files in a particular folder structure as shown.</li>
</ol>

<p>MainFolder:</p>

<pre><code>{
    Country1:{
        Res1,
        Res2, 
        Res3, 
        ....},

<p>As I understand to do this I would need to set up a Build.xml. But then I can't find Build.xml after selecting the Export Antenna Build Files option.</p>

<p>How do I achieve this goal?  Is it even possible to do this? Please do help . Thanks in Advance</p>

<p>===================UPDATE TO THIS POST #1======================</p>

<p>Follow the links mentioned by Eugen Martynov below. 
on a side note: The reason I wasn't getting the option to Export Antenna Build files on the right click of the project was because they were referring to a customized version of the Eclipse IDE called Pulsar Eclipse.[ <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/pulsar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eclipse.org/pulsar/</a> ]</p>

<p>The Antenna build xml file generated by it is far more optimized than the one you get out of the standard Eclipse. I dunno why that is. But thats my Observation. </p>

<p>===================UPDATE TO THIS POST #2======================</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestion Eugen. I will be writing a few sub Ant Build files to simplify my problem. I still have to figure out how to break this down. </p>

<p>Thanks for the link Telmo Pimentel Mota. In my current build I have 'wtkbuild' and 'wtkpackage'. And the build is working great. I just now have to figure out how to call or execute one build file from another following Eguen's suggestion. </p>

<p>Apache does not load when <strong>BOTH</strong> modules are running.
What am I missing and is this possible?</p>

It's suppossed to be an Auction List and have a countdown in the ""Time Left"" field till the item expires, but i can't figure out what's wrong. I am very unfamiliar with javascript and sharepoint but i am an experienced programmer.  Can anyone help with this? Here's the code below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
var context = new SP.ClientContext.get_current();
var web = context.get_web();
var lists = web.get_lists();
var listId = SP.ListOperation.Selection.getSelectedList();
var list = lists.getById(listId);
var item = getItemByName(""End Date"");
var end = Date.parse(item.text())/1000;
var todayNow = new Date();
todayNow = Date.parse(today)/1000;
var result = (end-todayNow);
var item2 = getItemByName(""Time Left"");
item2.text(result);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The End Date is a field that will probably be hidden, but just used as a placeholder to find the difference from now till the item expires.</p>

<p>Thanks guys for any responses.</p>

<p>Edit: Ok thanks Robert, you've really helped a lot. I was just about to post this when i saw your last comment. I'm extremely close now since I've been googling and researching what you said in your first comment and I've gotten this far:</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<pre><code>script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
ExecuteOrDelayUntilScriptLoaded(getWebSiteData, ""sp.js"");
var context = null;
var web = null;
var lists = null;
var listId = null;
var list = null;
var item = null;
function getWebSiteData(){
context = new SP.ClientContext.get_current();
web = context.get_web();
lists = web.get_lists();
listId = SP.ListOperation.Selection.getSelectedList();
list = lists.getById(listId);
context.load(list, 'End Date');
context.executeQueryAsync(Function.createDelegate
(this, this.onSuccessMethod), Function.createDelegate
(this, this.onFailureMethod));
}
function onSuccessMethod(sender, args){
alert('web title:' + web.get_title() + '\n ID:' + web.get_id
());
}
function onFailureMethod(sender, args){
alert('request failed' + args.get_message
() + '\n' + args.get_stackTrace());
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I think the only thing i have left to do is figure out how to get the current item so i can set the Time Left for that specific item. Do you know how to do that? Am i as close as i think?
Thanks again for your help.</p>

If I record just the access token, life seems to be good and the AuthenticationManager.GetExternalLoginInfoAsync() continues to return a non-null LoginInfo payload. If I record any other random types of claims, like ""test"", ""foo"" ""wacka wacka"" it also still works. </p>

<p>So the code where I frame up the GooglePlus options looks as follows</p>

<pre><code>var googleOptions = new GooglePlusAuthenticationOptions

    ClientId = clientId,
    ClientSecret = clientSecret,
    RequestOfflineAccess = true,
    Provider = new GooglePlusAuthenticationProvider
        {

            {

                context.Identity.AddClaim(new Claim(""urn:tokens:Test"", ""Test""));

<p>This first line in the method is the one that horribly returns null</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; ExternalLoginCallback(string returnUrl)
{
    var loginInfo = await AuthenticationManager.GetExternalLoginInfoAsync();
    if (loginInfo == null)
    {
        return RedirectToAction(""Login"");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I've definitely gone up and down Google and StackOverflow, Microsoft's various pages and seen the suggestion to do </p>

<pre><code>[AllowAnonymous]
public ActionResult Login(string returnUrl)
{
    Session[""dummy""] = ""dummy"";
    ViewBag.ReturnUrl = returnUrl;
    return View();
}
</code></pre>

<p>or add the following to the web.config</p>

<pre><code>&lt;location path=""signin-googleplus""&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;authorization&gt;
            &lt;allow users=""*"" /&gt;
        &lt;/authorization&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/location&gt;

<p>Unfortunately, non of it is working. If saving the refresh token is not best practices as well, I'm very opening to knowing what is.</p>

<pre><code>public static readonly DependencyProperty CommandProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(
    ""Command"", typeof(Command), typeof(MainWindow), new PropertyMetadata(new Command(OnCommand)));

public static void OnCommand(object param)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>The options I thought of are this:</p>

<p>1) Use it like the code above.
 Problem: I need the current instance in my command callback, I need to edit this instance through the command. As this control is not a singleton, I cannot just use a static instance variable. Piping the instance through as a command parameter doesn't seem to be a sane idea either. I can't Create the DependencyProperty in the Constructor where I would have the method instance, as it's readonly.</p>

<p>2) Create the DependencyProperty as non-readonly, setting it in the constructor to use non static methods.</p>

<p>Problem: I can't do that, as I get the exception that ""Command"" has to be a DependencyProperty as soon as it tries to initialize the controls, even if I initialize it before InitializeComponents.</p>

<p>3) Use a property instead of command with parameters.</p>

<p>Problem: Say my command parameters I wanted to use are strings. Would I want to use a text boxes contents for that, the command would send the text to the control and trigger something. I wouldn't want the trigger to be on text changed, and it would be quite ugly to use another boolean property as a ""do it now flag""</p>

<p>I had some other attempts too, but while trying stuff around typing this out I sortof forgot them. While I know that MVVM shouldn't technically work that way, I need the Control to be closed off and the ViewModel, while knowing WHAT to submit to the control, does not know how and what to do with it.</p>

<p>Are there any ways to achieve what I want without using the 'hack' (imho) in point 3?</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong>
I got option 4 here which technically works. I use a normal Command Dependency Property and keep an empty Setter in the normal Command Property. My DependencyPropertyChanged callback checks if the change of the Dependency Property is internal, if it isn't, the change is rolled back. Tried it out and it works.</p>

<p><em>Specification:</em> As for what I need it for: My Control needs to offer a command, you call the command with a parameter to do stuff control-interal. I can't use any text box for that, and as I specified in the other options, the other things I can try are not as valid for me.</p>

<p>So here is my questions,</p>

<p>Please let me know if some one has cross compiled alljoyn standard core and service framework for any platform, please provide me steps/command for that.</p>

I can use <code>console.log(response)</code> to see the complete response but I can't get it to stick to a variable. </p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to assign the response which has an html object to a variable and then use <a href=""https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio"" rel=""nofollow"">cheerio</a> to get pieces of the html object with jQuery selectors, but I believe I need to at least get it in to a variable first, right?</p>

<p><strong>Edit/Fix</strong></p>

<p>I was able to get this to work based on @idbehold's comments. Everything needed to be done in the call back so instead of calling the variable after the request, I returned it in the callback like this, which gave me access to the variable outside of the function.</p>

var data;
wikipedia.page.data(""Clifford_Brown"", { content: true }, function(response) {

<p>Connecting directly through redis-cli to my twemproxy will correctly proxy me over to redis without any issues/disconnects. However, when I use node-redis to connect to twemproxy I get the following error: </p>

<pre><code>[Error: Redis connection gone from end event.]
</code></pre>

<p>Trace is as follows:</p>

<p>The error I get is: cannot convert 'std::string {aka std::basic_string}' to 'char*' for argument '3' to 'void outtextxy(int, int, char*)'. What I understand from this is that the parameter 3 of the function outtextxy must be a char* and not a string, but even when I try outtextxy(200,300,a.c_str()) doesn't work, becaus what I get is another error:
error: invalid conversion from 'const char*' to 'char*' [-fpermissive].</p>

<p>I need help with this conversion please.</p>

<p>Edit:I corrected it:

As most of the places online suggested, it was hard to capture the screen due to session isolation feature from windows. Due to curiosity, I tried interactive services flags, changing account types, moving to secure places, getting handle of Windows stations, Desktop and setting them to Thread etc., but nothing worked, every time access denied. Getting a screenshot from service is an absolute requirement for me.</p>

<p>So, another idea lying around would be why not just poll a frame buffer or video buffer from the service to give a copy? So that we don't need to worry about any of these session walls, isolation, security and so on. Having that in mind, I felt DirectX would be better candidate to move on as it is has good relations with hardware. </p>

<p>But then, I have done zero lines of programming in DirectX. Could someone please help me with some pointers if DirectX can help in getting this done? If other case what other Drivers API can help in getting the video buffer memory.</p>

Form1 also has button ""Go to Main"", when user clicks it I do <code>form1.Hide()</code> (hide form1 with data) and <code>mainWindow.Show()</code> (again show mainWindow).On mainWindow user selects another item from the <code>ListBox</code> and clicks ""Show"" - the form1 is shown and it should display new data because user selected new item on mainWindow but form1 displays old data (data which was shown when module for form1 was loaded for the first time). </p>

<p>Example - on mainWindow we have the ListBox with the list of offices of some company, we select ""Office1"" and click ""Show"", this mainWindow hides and form1 loads, form1 displays the expenses list for ""Office1"". When I select another office on mainWindow, e.g. ""Office2"" form1 should display expenses for ""Office2"" but it displays expenses for ""Office1"".</p>

<p>I do moduleManager.LoadModule("""") when user clicks ""Show"" button on mainWindow. I found the information that we can't reload module, it means the module is loaded only when we click ""Show"" button for the first time, but how can we update the data on the view?</p>

<p>When in shell i run <code>echo $DEVISE_KEY</code> and it returns nothing but an empty line, if i run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> then <code>echo $DEVISE_KEY</code> it does return the key?!? So it seems it is in there somewhere, but not accessible by rails and or the right session/environment/program. As a junior to UNIX, Rails and much more I'm now at a loss as to what's happening here. Please can you help me understand what i'm doing wrong here. Thankyou.</p>

<li>Application sends message to set form classes.</li>
<li>Application sends WM_CREATE message to create window.</li>
<li>Application sends WM_PAINT message to paint form.</li>

<p>I know it is a little more complex than that, so I want to find out which dependencies are sending the messages out and doing the drawing. I reflected then sifted through Windows.Forms and System.Drawing to get my answers but I didn't really see anything that painted the initial forms, only ones to draw controls into graphicsbuffers. Either they are well hidden or I am missing something completely. Can anyone tell me how to find the code I am looking for that sends the actual messages out to the system to draw the forms and paint?</p>

(I thought this would be a common thing, but didn't find any decent tutorials on it, so if you know any please let me know)</p>

<p>I followed a simple MSDN guide to create an item in the toolbar first (I forget where is was to link it) and this worked fine.</p>

<p>Then I found a way to move it to the Solution Explorer context menu. This was achieved by manipulating the <code>.vsct</code> file and having an element like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Parent guid=""guidSHLMainMenu"" id=""IDM_VS_CTXT_ITEMNODE""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That probably doesn't matter, but I am trying to set the scene.</p>

<p>Now, because I want to only show the item for certain file types, I need to find a way to check the file when the right-click button is pressed. Cutting a long search short, I <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb165468%28v=vs.90%29.aspx"">found this</a> and ended up with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void Initialize()
{
    //stuff
    OleMenuCommandService mcs = GetService(typeof(IMenuCommandService)) as OleMenuCommandService;
    menuItem.BeforeQueryStatus += menuItem_BeforeQueryStatus;
    //more stuff
}

void menuItem_BeforeQueryStatus(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var myCommand = sender as OleMenuCommand;
    myCommand.Text = ""NEW NAME"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example I am just trying to set the text to try and prove it works, I know there is a <code>Visible</code> property but I want this step to work first. The <code>BeforeQueryStatus</code> event is fired, and debugging shows the code executing as expected. However, there is no change in the context menu item, it stays with the original text.</p>

<p>What am I missing here? Why is it not updating?</p>

I am aware of GLASS as an application server using Linux, Seaside and Apache. But I want to know if it is an usable environment for non-Seaside applications.</p>

<p>I'm also having trouble to finding some basic questions:</p>

<p>It is not clear to me if GLASS or GemStone/S is independent of the VM used. For example if I'm using a VM which supports black threads, does that mean that the GemStone/S will work transparently?</p>

<p>For what I've seen also it is not useful for 3D applications. For example, if my application developed in Pharo or VisualWorks uses OpenGL, may I consider GemStone/S for scaling up? </p>

<p>I've read that you may have objects in VisualWorks and objects in GemStone/S, but this confuses me a lot. How do I know if the object I've just created it is already persisted or in ""client"" side? In which case I need GemBuilder?</p>

<p>I have read several post's on list view and grid view but I am not understanding how to apply them to my app. The image shown is how i want the app to look. I have started to experiment with both list and grid views. I currently replaced the first 2 table rows with grid views just to see what happens, I'm clueless at this point, so I have deleted the grid views and reverted back to table row's. But here is the coding for the layout and the table row's setup, I have 11 table row's and a button that are not shown in the coding ! Thanks for any input in advance!</p>

How can I use the similar above example and assign to each processor one stock ticker and apply the function that needs to be run for each ticker? How can I tell python that once a processor get free, to go back in the <code>tickers</code> vector and process a <code>ticker</code> that has not yet been processed? </p>

"26449475","1","26449563","","2014-10-19 10:12:32","","0","82","<p>So I have this method in my base controller:</p>

<pre><code>protected async Task&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;bool, string&gt;&gt; ExecuteSimpleQuery(Func&lt;Task&lt;bool&gt;&gt; service)
{
    var success = false;
    var message = string.Empty;

    try
    {
        success = await service.Invoke();
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        message = exception.Message;
        success = false;
    }

    return new KeyValuePair&lt;bool, string&gt;(success, message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Login(RegisterDto register)
{
    var objectStore =
        await this.ExecuteSimpleQuery(async () =&gt; await this.securityService.LoginAsync(register.UserName, register.Password, true));

    if (objectStore.Key)
    {
        return this.RedirectToAction(""Index"", ""Toolbox"");
    }

    this.TempData[""error""] = objectStore.Value;
    return this.View(register);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So what I'm passing through to <code>ExecuteSimpleQuery</code> is an <code>awaitable</code> method <code>LoginAsync</code>, I just want to make sure I'm properly awaiting the method.</p>

<p>My thought process is:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>LoginAsync</code> returns a <code>Task&lt;bool&gt;</code> therefore the <code>Func</code> has to return that.</li>
<li>When passing it, you can <code>await</code> it, so do.</li>
<li>Because the <code>Func</code> returns a <code>Task&lt;bool&gt;</code> inside <code>ExecuteSimpleQuery</code> you can <code>await</code> it there, so should</li>
<li><code>ExecuteSimpleQuery</code> is awaiting a method, therefore has to have the <code>async</code> keyword and therefore has to return <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The last point propagates to the <code>Login</code> action, that method returns <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> so it can be awaited, so should.</li>
</ol>

<p>Am I even close?</p>

These fragments inherit from <code>DialogFragment</code> and we make sure to instantiate them correctly depending the mode the app is executed in (either fullscreen or dialog).</p>

<p>We thought about adding some extra functionality to some of these dialog fragments after the latest changes in the <code>Toolbar</code> widget were introduced in the support library with Lollipop. The idea is to have the type of options menu we would normally have in an ordinary fragment (i.e. the options menu inflated after <code>onCreateOptionsMenu</code> is executed) present in our subclasses of <code>DialogFragment</code> ONLY when these are visualized as dialogs. In short: when the fragments are shown in fullscreen mode we inflate a traditional options menu, and when the fragments are shown as dialogs we would like to have the same options menu inflated but using the new toolbar widget in standalone mode.</p>

<p>I followed the steps from <a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.dk/2014/10/appcompat-v21-material-design-for-pre.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://android-developers.blogspot.dk/2014/10/appcompat-v21-material-design-for-pre.html</a> and I managed to ""activate"" the toolbar, but it seems the menu is not inflated - see attached screenshots (picture one fragment in fullscreen mode, and picture two in dialog mode).</p>

<p>Is it even possible to inflate an options menu with the new toolbar in a <code>DialogFragment</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> Someone told me they had seen code once which would query oracle for details on a specific <code>ORA-code</code> error. I've been searching on Google for a little while now and can't seem to find anything like that. Does anyone know if this is possible? Is there a v$view for it or something?</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> I want to write a procedure which will return the description of an error code I give to it. So when it's written I could call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>select ora_code_desc('ORA-00000')
from dual;
</code></pre>

<p>And it would output:</p>

<pre><code>Normal, successful completion.
Cause: An operation has completed normally, having met no exceptions.
Action: No action required.
</code></pre>

<p>Or something like that :) Thanks for the help!</p>

<li>Juqery Ajax post to controller/action with parameters</li>
<li>Parameters are escaped using escape function, so that I can pass ' char.</li>
<li>In Action method, I get parameters encoded (javascript escaped) and I have to user HttpUtility.UrlDecode to decode them and then use. </li>
<li>If I use a form and serialize form data and then post, parameters are perfectly decoded automatically.</li>

<p>Does this mean that if I use escape in jquery ajax parameters, controller action is not going to decode it ? What is the best way?</p>

"28388148","1","","","2015-02-07 22:20:48","","0","61","<p>This is probably a common question that arises in search/store situations and there is a standard answer. I'm trying to do this from intuition and am somewhat out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>I'm attempting to generate all of a certain kind of combinatorial object. Each object of size n can be generated from an object of size n-1, usually in multiple ways. From the single object of size 2, my search generates 6 objects of size 3, about 140 objects of size 4, and about 29,000 objects of size 5. As I generate the objects, I store them in a globally declared array. Before storing each object, I have to check all the previous ones stored for that size, to make sure I didn't generate it already from an earlier (n-1)-object. I currently do this in a naive way, which is just that I go through all the objects currently sitting in the array and compare them to the one currently being generated. Only if it's different from every single one there do I add it to the array and increment the number of objects currently in there. The new object is just added as the most recent object in the array, it is not sorted, and so this is obviously inefficient, and I can't hope to generate the objects of size 6 in this way. </p>

<p>(To give an idea of the problem of the growth of the array: the first couple of 4-objects, from among the 140 or so, give rise to over 2000 new 5-objects in a fraction of a second. By the time I've gotten to the last few 4-objects, with over 25,000 5-objects already stored, each 4-object generates only a handful of previously unseen 5-objects, but takes several seconds for the process for each 4-object. There is very little correlation between the order I generate new objects in, and their eventual position as a consequence of the comparison function I'm using.)</p>

<p>Obviously if I had a sorted array of objects, it would be much more efficient to find out whether I'm looking at a new object: using a binary midpoint search strategy I'd only have to look at roughly log_2(n) of the n objects currently stored, instead of all n of them. But placing the newly generated object at the right place in an array means moving half of the existing ones, on average, to make room for it. (I would implement this with an array of pointers pointing to the unsorted array of object structs, so that I only had to move pointers instead of moving data, but it still seems like a lot of pointers to have to repoint at each insert.)</p>

<p>The other option would be to place the objects in a linked list, as insertion is very cheap in that situation. But then I wouldn't have random access to the elements in the linked list--you can only find the right place to insert the newly generated object (if it's actually new) by traversing the list node by node and comparing. On average you'd have to traverse half the list before finding the right insertion point, which doesn't sound any better than repointing half the pointers.</p>

<p>Is there a third choice I'm missing? I could accomplish this very easily if I had both random access to stored elements so I could find the insertion point quickly (in log_2(n) steps), <em>and</em> I could insert new objects very cheaply, like in a linked list. Am I dreaming?</p>

<p>To summarise: I need to be able to determine whether an object is new or duplicates an existing one, and I need to be able to insert an object at the right place. I don't ever need to delete an object. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>I have a table of edges, stored as a two-column table of <code>[vertex_a, vertex_b]</code>.</p>

<p>I need a table of distinct sets, stored as <code>[vertex, set_id]</code> with one row per vertex, labeling each vertex with a disjoint set_id.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Must be a purely SQL implementation. It can leverage Postgres-specific functions, but pure ANSI SQL highly preferred.</li>
<li>The result can be approximate- it's acceptable to label a few sets as disjoint when they're actually connected. It's even better if the approximation bounds can be adjusted- by increasing iterations for example.</li>
<li>Libraries are out (no Boost, Numpy, Scipy). Must be SQL.</li>
<li>Most sets will contain 1 to 3 vertices.  Very few large sets, expected max to be 10 vertices.</li>

I have a custom button, derived from JComponent and created and placed on this JFrame. On pressing this button a modal dialog appears.</p>

<p>The problem is, that after modal dialog appears, the JFrame stops receiving mouse events from mouse. I opened Spy++ and found out that MouseEvents from Windows are passed to the JFrame. So they are switched off somewhere in Java.</p>

<p>I need to receive button events for one thing - when mouse enters my custom button area, button changes color. And I need to know when the mouse exits the button area, to change the button to it's original color. The same problem is with standard JButton - it remains hovered after modal dialog appears.</p>

<p>Of course I can track the opening of modal dialog myself, and make my button unhovered, but just curious, if there is standard solution.</p>

<p>I have a method taking in a single <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;bool&gt;&gt;</code> parameter </p>

<pre><code>void MethodOne(Expression&lt;Func&lt;bool&gt;&gt; expression)
</code></pre>

<p>I've got multiple instances of <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;bool&gt;&gt;</code>. How do I dynamically combine these expressions into a single <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;bool&gt;&gt;</code> using <code>Expression.OrElse</code> (i.e. building up an expression tree)?</p>

<p>For example if I have two expressions such as </p>

<pre><code>() =&gt; objectA.PropertyOneIsSet
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>() =&gt; objectB.PropertyTwoIsSet
</code></pre>

<p>I want the end result to be:</p>

<pre><code>() =&gt; objectA.PropertyOneIsSet || objectB.PropertyTwoIsSet
</code></pre>

<p>so I can pass this to my method above.</p>

<p>If I simply issue a ""SELECT * FROM customer"", it may return huge amount of data that eventually causing OOM. I wonder, is there a way i can process the record immediately once it become available, and remove the record from memory after that during sql retrieving process?</p>

<p>--- edited on 13 Jul 2009</p>

<p>Let me elaborate my question. I have 1 db server and 1 application server.
When I issue a select query in application, the data will travel from db server to app server.</p>

<p>I believe (correct me if I am wrong) ResultSet will need to wait until receiving all records in the query. Even if we set fetch size as 4, for a 1000-record table, we still end up having 1000 records in heap memory of app server, is it correct? Fetch size only affect the number of round trip from/to db server.</p>

<p>My question is, how to start processing on that 4 (or any number) records immediately after it's arrival to app server, and dispose it to free up memory in app server?</p>

I want to be able to take that image and save it. I am doing this fine with text, but when it comes to other content, such as an image, it is error-ing saying it can not find the variable, and when I try <code>file_get_contents</code>, it does not like that either. I am sending the image from an iPhone as well, so my POST Request looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableData *postBody = [NSMutableData data];
[postBody appendData:[[NSString stringWithFormat:@""--%@\r\n"", stringBoundary] dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];
[postBody appendData:[@""Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\""media\""; filename=\""dummy.jpg\""\r\n"" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];
[postBody appendData:[@""Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n"" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];
[postBody appendData:[@""Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\r\n\r\n"" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];
[postBody appendData:imageData];
[postBody appendData:[@""\r\n"" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];
[postBody appendData:[[NSString stringWithFormat:@""--%@--\r\n"", stringBoundary] dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];
[postRequest setHTTPBody:postBody];
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the request is written, but I do not really feel like posting all of it. </p>

<p>But regardless, that is how I am sending the request, and on the php server side, </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo ""Some Message"";
    $nameValue =  $_POST['name'];
    echo ""&lt;br/&gt;"";
    echo $nameValue;
    $otherValue =  $_POST['other'];
    echo ""&lt;br/&gt;"";
    echo $otherValue;
    file_get_contents('dummy.jpg');
    // or I tried this
    $imageData = $_POST['media'];
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I can not seem to be able to grab the image. Both attempts of getting the image failed and I do not know why. Any suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I added the print statement <code>print_r($_FILES)</code> to see what I would get and it returned the following.</p>

<pre><code>(
    [media] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; dummy.jpg
            [type] =&gt; 
            [tmp_name] =&gt; 
            [error] =&gt; 1
            [size] =&gt; 0
        )
)
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems as if it is getting the image, at least the name of it, but for some reason it is not getting the actual data and is throwing some error. I imagine this is probably on the iPhone side of things if it is not sending the data and my PHP server is seeing an error. I am unsure though, anyone ever experience something like this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>I finally got everything working. It turns out that everything was formatted properly I was just having a file image size upload limit issue. The images I was sending were around 8MB and apparently our server can not handle that, so I simply downed the quality on the jpeg, and that issue was solved. Then there were some permissions issues, as well, nothing a little bit of <code>sudo chmod</code> can't fix. Thanks everyone for your suggestions and help, I wish I could accept more than one answer!</p>

<p>This works wonderfully but with one small issue (which is actually an annoying problem)! </p>

<p>If you click the first link, 'products' for example, you can scroll from the left all the way to the right to the last image nicely. If you then click 'fashion', another HTML file is called but it calls it at the stage you left off from 'products' i.e. all the way to the right, and not at the start. </p>

This is my custom login widget:</p>

<pre><code>class LoginWidget(QWidget):

    def __init__(self, parent=None):

        super(LoginWidget, self).__init__(parent)
        mainLayout = QVBoxLayout()
        layoutH = QHBoxLayout()

        pwdField.setEchoMode(QLineEdit.EchoMode(2))
        btnSubmit = QPushButton('log in')
        btnSubmit.setIcon(IconCache.getIcon('login'))

        for w in (nameField, pwdField):
            layoutH.addWidget(w)
        mainLayout.addLayout(layoutH)
        mainLayout.addWidget(btnSubmit)
        self.setLayout(mainLayout)
</code></pre>

<p>I then add the above widget to my menu like this:</p>

<pre><code>app = QApplication([])

menu = QMenu()
settingsAction = QAction('settings', menu)
loginAction = QWidgetAction(menu)
loginAction.setDefaultWidget(LoginWidget())
menu.addAction(settingsAction)    
menu.addAction(loginAction)

btn = QToolButton()
btn.setText('menu button')
btn.setMenu(menu)
btn.setPopupMode(QToolButton.InstantPopup)

btn.show()
sys.exit(app.exec_())
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when you open the menu, click into the name field to fill in the user name, then hit the tab key, focus jumps to the ""settings"" action rather than to the password widget inside the LoginWidget.
I tried setFocusPolicy(Qt.StrongFocus) on the LoginWidget as well as it's pwdField but to no avail.</p>

<p>Can this be done?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
frank</p>

This morning in our webmaster tools we see 8000 new 404 pages not found. In the image below we have made a printscreen. We do not know were these url's come from because we do not use this url structure. As you can see in the printscreen everything starts with:</p>

<p>order/order.html?AddID  for example: order/order.html?AddID=1014&amp;Rand=920505296661072670</p>

<p>It looks like the old owner of the url has something to do with this. Now we want to redirect everything that starts with order/order.html?AddID to the homepage. At this moment we see 8000 not found with exactly the same url and only a different AddID.</p>

<p>Is this possible and if so does someone has the best way to redirect these url's?</p>

<p>Now, how do I calculate the PTS, DTS, and packet duration (<code>packet.dts</code>, <code>packet.pts</code> and <code>packet.duration</code>) correctly for both audio and video data so that I can sync audio &amp; video and play it properly? I saw many examples on the internet, but none of them are making sense to me. I am new with <code>ffmpeg</code>, and my conception may not be correct in some context. I want to do it in the appropriate way.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>EDIT: In my video streams, there is no B frame. So, I think PTS and DTS can be kept the same here.</p>

<p>I have converted a web site to Drupal. I think I've done a reasonably good clean job with the markup and CSS starting with the <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/zen"" rel=""nofollow"">Zen theme</a>. All font sizes are set in em. It's a fixed width layout. That might be a bad decision but ... I basically copied the old site design.</p>

<p>The menu at is a nice horizontal ul inside a div. One of the users seems to be in the habit of increasing the text size by zooming with Firefox with ""Zoom Text Only"" checked or changing the text size in I.E. The problem is that the menu area is a fixed size so the right hand menu options drop off the end and disappear.</p>

<p>The old site seemed to have some magic or hack that avoided this. When zooming the text size, all text zooms except the menu. It stays the same. I've poked around with Firebug but haven't been able to find how they do it. The client would like the new site to behave the same way. That menu on the old site is a table so I wonder if tables are immune to the text resize.</p>

The two main ways I have seen so far are via random access file and mapped direct byte buffers.</p>

<p>Heres where it gets tricky though. I have my own memory cache for objects so any call to the objects stored in a file should go through to disk and not paged memory (I have disabled the swap space on my linux box to prevent this). Whilst mapped direct memory buffers are supposedly the fastest they rely on swapping which is not good because A) I am using all the free memory for the object cache, using mappedbytebuffers instead would incur a massive serialization overhead which is what the object cache is there to prevent.(My program is already CPU limited) B) with mappedbytebuffers the OS handles the details of when data is written to disk, I need to control this myself, ie. when I write(byte[]) it goes straight out to disk instantly, this is to prevent data corruption incase of power failure as I am not using ACID transactions.</p>

<p>On the other hand I need massive concurrency, ie. I need to read and write to multiple locations in the same file at the same time (whilst using offset/Range locks to prevent data corruption) I'm not sure how I can do this without mappedbytebuffers, I could always just que the reads/Writes but I'm not sure how this will negatively affect my throughput.</p>

<p>Finally I can not have a situation when I am creating new byte[] objects for reads or writes, this is because I perform almost a 100000 read/write operations per second, allocating and Garbage collecting all those objects would kill my program which is time sensitive and already CPU limited, reusing byte[] objects is fine through.</p>

<p>Please do not suggest any DB software as I have tried most of them and they add to much complexity and cpu overhead.</p>

<p>Usually, if you pass an object into a function, you'd use a dot to access its methods (this also works for <code>ref</code> classes, with some extra constructors):</p>

<pre><code>value class Value {
  void Print() { Console::WriteLine(""Value""); }
};

void f(Value v) {
  v.Print();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also usually, passing an object via an interface into a function forces you to put a <code>^</code> on the argument, and use <code>-&gt;</code> in the method call:</p>

<pre><code>interface class Base {
  void Print();
};

void f(Base ^b) {
  b-&gt;Print();
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you make <code>f</code> generic, with a constraint based on an interface, the compiler insists that you use <code>-&gt;</code>, but also insists you don't use <code>^</code> in the arguments list:</p>

<pre><code>interface class Base {
  void Print();
};

generic &lt;class T&gt; where T : Base
void f(T t) {
  t-&gt;Print();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Up to now, I believed that referencing objects directly always uses <code>.</code> and referencing them through their handles always uses <code>-&gt;</code>. This appears to reference an object directly using a <code>-&gt;</code> - what am I getting wrong?</p>

My C# DLL code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>namespace CSharpEmailSender
{
   // Interface declaration.
   public interface ICalculator
   {
       int Add(int Number1, int Number2);
       int StringTest(string test1, string test2);
   };

// Interface implementation.
public class ManagedClass : ICalculator
{
    public int Add(int Number1, int Number2)
    {
        return Number1 + Number2;
    }

    public int StringTest(string test1, string test2)
    {
        if (test1 == ""hello"")
            return(1);

        if (test2 == ""world"")
            return(2);

        return(3);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then register this DLL using regasm.  I use it in my C++ app like so:</p>

<pre><code>using namespace CSharpEmailSender;
using namespace std;

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
// Initialize COM.
HRESULT hr = CoInitialize(NULL);

// Create the interface pointer.
ICalculatorPtr pICalc(__uuidof(ManagedClass));

long lResult = 0;
long lResult2 = 0;

pICalc-&gt;Add(115, 110, &amp;lResult);
wprintf(L""The result is %d"", lResult);

pICalc-&gt;StringTest(L""hello"", L""world"", &amp;lResult2);
wprintf(L""The result is %d"", lResult2);

// Uninitialize COM.
CoUninitialize();

return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>After running this, lResult is correct (with value of 225), but lResult2 is zero.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?</p>

For underscore doesn't auto escape interpolated values with syntax <code>&lt;%= someValue %&gt;</code> but with <code>&lt;%- someValue %&gt;</code>, which is in the contrast to EJS and may causes confusion. There was a <a href=""https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/issues/129"" rel=""nofollow"">issue</a> on GitHub and also a <a href=""https://github.com/dvv/underscore/commit/a4f4d30440f52c7cef26e8574e8eae384a66db9f"" rel=""nofollow"">commit</a> of auto-escape version. But a comment beneath the issue said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm of the general philosophy that escaping should be done closer to
  your data than in the templating language</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, any suggestion that when to do HTML escape to AJAX data is better? Here's the server side helper function I have been using:</p>

<pre><code>var htmlEscape = function(html){
    return String(html)
    .replace(/&amp;(?!\w+;)/g, '&amp;amp;')
    .replace(/&lt;/g, '&amp;lt;')
    .replace(/&gt;/g, '&amp;gt;')
    .replace(/""/g, '&amp;quot;');
};
var xss = function(obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Array) {
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; obj.length; i++) {
            obj[i] = xss(obj[i]);
        }
    } else {
        for(var key in obj) {
            // key != '_id' for mongoose doc
            if(obj[key] instanceof Object &amp;&amp; !(obj[key] instanceof String) 
                &amp;&amp; !(obj[key] instanceof Function) &amp;&amp; key != '_id') {
                obj[key] = xss(obj[key]);
            } else if (obj[key] instanceof String || typeof(obj[key]) == ""string"") {
                obj[key] = htmlEscape(obj[key]);
            } else {
                obj[key] = obj[key];
            }
        }
    }
    return obj;
};

So, i’d like to show the spinner because for some reason it takes an average of 8 seconds to show data in(blank frozen tableview), so I need to display a gray spinner (activity indicator)and properly stop it when the data finish loading.
The remote data will start syncing with server at a number of seconds previously preset (I set it to 4hrs. to not create so many requests during workshop sessions) and fire off the server load in AppDelegate’s applicationDidBecomeActive.</p>

<p>The thing is, I’m experiencing issues with the spinner to show it when data is being loaded / stop indicator when done showing data rows, hence the blank tableview is still blocking the UI.</p>

<p>Case1) spinner is started in viewDidLoad, and stopped(in main thread) in controllerDidChangeContent. result: i don't see spinner and it seems data is still loading, so it shows blank tableview with no spinner - In this case, or it’s too fast or it appears that controllerDidChangeContent finishes before data is done loading. </p>

<p>Case 2) spinner starts in viewWillAppear and stopped in viewWillDissapear. It shows spinning view at the right time in the right screen, but only stops if user changes views.</p>

<p>Case 3) Then I tried using flags. Like, isLoading equals true and making it false to stop spinner. </p>

<p>The right place, I guess, should be right after the task resume line gets called out, but I can’t insert the spinner stop function in the AppDelegate’s applicationDidBecomeActive because it doesn’t know about the UIActivityIndicatorView in there. I’ve tried creating a swift class just for the spinner, so it throws red errors because it doesn’t recognize UIViews, even importing UIKit.</p>

<p>The console shows the error is null, the boolean returns true, and even the duration is correct!  Yet, play does nothing.  If I change ""gameover"" to another sound (a simple beep), all is fine.</p>

<p>While it would be great to get it play, I'm also struggling to understand what error conditions, etc. I can check to 1) know it failed and 2) why.</p>

<p>The sound is question is available at <a href=""http://wdr1.com/gameover.wav"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wdr1.com/gameover.wav</a>.</p>

<p>This works as expected and well. However I have an issue when the application is deployed as a war file. The locations as to where the config file is are hardcoded in config.groovy as above. My requirement is to allow customers to specify the location of their own configuration file. </p>

<p>I'm stuck with this as the locations are hardcoded in config.groovy before the war file is built. I don't know how I'd go about letting a customer modify these values. I don't want to have to build a different war file for each customer containing the location of their configuration file.</p>

<p>Is there a method of changing these values? Or perhaps its reasonable that I have a hardcoded value where all customers should put their configuration files? I'd be interested to see if anyone has any suggestions?</p>

But it has a common problem that I just can't figure out myself: if the instance has relations set, the deletion fails with <code>NSValidationRelationshipDeniedDeleteError</code> (1600). This is the case even if all relations, including inverse, are set to ""optional"". <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreDataFramework/Miscellaneous/CoreData_Constants/Reference/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Apple's documentation says</a> this error code denotes that ""some relationship with delete rule NSDeleteRuleDeny is non-empty"". This is not the case here; all relationships have a delete rule of ""nullify"".</p>

<p>I even tried with the simplest relation I could think of, using the employee and department example of Apple's documentation. I can delete an employee as long as it has no department set.</p>

<p>I found this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1463382/core-data-relationships-cause-save-error-after-delete"">thread</a> about this problem; the solution there is to set all relations to nil before saving the MOC. This indeed works, but it does not make the faintest sense to me.</p>

<p>My question: is this really common practice? How does this make sense? What does everybody else do to delete Core Data objects with relations?</p>

<p>PS: In case anybody is interested, this is my code to clear the relations; <code>entityInstance</code> is the instance to be deleted. The code is generic for my app, meaning it clears all relations of the entity to be deleted:</p>

<pre><code>NSEntityDescription *ed = entityInstance.entity;
NSDictionary *relations = [ed relationshipsByName];
NSArray *keys = [relations allKeys];
[keys enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
  [entityInstance setValue:nil forKey:(NSString*) obj];
}];

<p>As I'm displaying whatever the server sends (I know, customer requirement, not good practice...), I'm forcing the device to have that TimeZone with the following method, simplified without error checking, not optimized, and all that kind of things:</p>

<pre><code>+ (NSString *) yearStringFromDate: (NSDate *) date
{
    NSDateFormatter *formatter = [NSDateFormatter new];
    [formatter setDateFormat:@""YYYY""];
    [formatter setTimeZone:[self timezoneForSIHF]];

    return [formatter stringFromDate:date];    
}
</code></pre>

<p>This should be UTC, BUT if I don't set the locale I'm getting, and JUST sometimes the incorrect year. So by adding this I get the year correct for all cases:</p>

<pre><code>[formatter setLocale:[NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifier:@""en_US_POSIX""]];
</code></pre>

<p>For further info, I'm testing in a real device and simulator with different languages (en, de, es).</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is this?</li>
<li>Why does the locale affect the date even though the timeZone is correct?</li>
<li>Why sometimes is working with some dates and sometimes it's not?
For example, 1982 is returning without setting the locale, 1981 and if I set it 1982. This doesn't happen with 1980, returning in both cases 1980 (or 1987, or ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance for all your replies :D
Cheers!</p>

<p>The Launcher is to load the jar via a URLClassloader and then unload/re-load the changed jar. The jar can be changed by a modification to Launcher, or by a provided dos/unix script that is called to swap the new jar into place of the old jar.</p>

<p>The entire program is below. Tested and it seems to work without a hitch.</p>

<p><strong>java Launcher -jar [path_to_jar] -run [yourbatchfile] [-runonce]? optional]</strong></p>

<p>1) Launcher looks for the ""Main-Class"" attribute in your jarfile so that it does not need to be giventhe actual class to run.</p>

<p>2) It will call 'public static void main(String[] args)' and pass it the remaining arguments that you provided on the command line</p>

<p>3) When your program finishes, the Launcher will call your programs method 'public static boolean reload()' and if the result is 'true' this will trigger a reload.</p>

<p>4) If you specified -runonce, then the program will never reload.</p>

<p>5) If you specified -run [batchfile] then the batchfile will run before reloading.</p>

<p>I hope this is helpful to some people. </p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

Earlier I had trouble in rendering of custom size NSTextAttachment's as it was slowing down the rendering to a great extent.I solved the issue by scaling the images and then adding them to textview.You can find my answer in

After scaling the images the textview rendering runs fine without any lag.The attributed text of textview is stored in core data.During a running session of application the textview displays the images correctly.Even after saving the attributed text in the core data and retrieving it again to display on textview,the images look fine.But after killing the app and again running the application.The images get enlarged to 2x size.while scaling the images I used the following function and used [[UIScreen bounds] scale] to maintain the image quality.</p>

<pre><code>- (UIImage *)imageWithImage:(UIImage *)image scaledToSize:(CGSize)newSize {

     UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(newSize, NO, [UIScreen mainScreen].scale);
    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, newSize.width, newSize.height)];
    UIImage *newImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
    return newImage;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I scale the images to 1.0 the images doesn't expand but the image quality is very bad.</p>

<p><strong>What I Think where the problem lies?</strong>
The problem lies in the layout manager.</p>

<p><strong>What I have Tried</strong>
I have tried subclassing the NSLayoutManager and overriding the 
<strong>- (void)drawGlyphsForGlyphRange:(NSRange)glyphsToShow atPoint:(CGPoint)origin</strong>
What I see is the attachment size is doubling when running a new session of the application.If I try to check the size of attachment and resize it.The lag starts coming again.
I am stucked with this problem from a quite time.Any suggestions would be much appreciated. <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/azMpi.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">

<h2>Attempt 2 - Fix <code>vcvarsall.bat</code> errors</h2>

<p>Next, following the advice of a blog I found, I also tried putting this in <code>C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg</code> to fix the <code>vcvarsall.bat</code> error.</p>

<p>This only helps marginally...</p>

<h2>Caveat - No cygwin or precompiled binaries</h2>

<p>I realize that I might be able to get this working under <code>cygwin</code>; however, I don't want  <code>cygwin</code> dependencies on this library; I need native Windows7 output.</p>

<p>If possible, I would like to avoid <a href=""http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cython"">precompiled Cython binaries</a> because as the author says, they are ""unsupported and for testing purposes only"".</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How can I get <code>cython</code> to install via <code>easy_install</code> under Windows7 with <code>MinGw</code>?</p>

<p>I know if you insert something into a collection it returns the _id, so I'd assume this would be same, but apparently it's not.</p>

<p>*Solved:</p>

<p>Got the code to do what it needed to do.</p>

<pre><code>Accounts.validateNewUser(function (user){

<p>slap that code into the account.js in the server side.</p>

<p>Eventually, I'd like that ""topiclocation"" variable to be read out of an .INI file, but hard coded for the time being is fine.

I'll get that acknowledge function working again, once I receive the JSON string properly.</p>

<p>In this iteration of the program with the ""grep"" function, I am unable to get the JSON record out - what string do I need to use for ""topiclocation"" in order to match ""Newcastle""?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is an error to use a section registered as allowDefinition= 'MachineToApplication' beyond application level.  This error can  be  caused by a virtual directory not being configured as an  application in IIS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I realised that I wasn't allowed to use the authentication element in a location element.</p>

<p>After reading <a href=""http://www.arcomit.co.uk/support/kb.aspx?kbid=000041"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> article, I then tried hooking into the FormsAuthentication_OnAuthenticate method in the Global.asax. As I need to use Basic Authentication, I tried returning a 401 to prompt the browser for basic auth credentials. Unfortunately, it seems this was causing a redirect to the Forms Authentication log on page (ie. loginUrl).</p>

<pre><code>public void FormsAuthentication_OnAuthenticate(object sender, FormsAuthenticationEventArgs e)
{
    string path = VirtualPathUtility.ToAppRelative(e.Context.Request.Path);
    if (path.Contains(""/Services/""))
    {
        e.Context.Response.StatusCode = 401;
        e.Context.Response.AddHeader(""WWW-Authenticate"", string.Format(""Basic realm=\""{0}\"""", ""CompanyRealm""));
        e.Context.Response.End();                
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So now I have run out of ideas as to how to implement Basic Auth on a folder in a Forms Authenticated web application.</p>

<p>When the file is being uploaded its going to the assigned directory which is like half the battle one, the table laptop has a field pic of type BLOB, how do I insert data into that field?</p>

<p>the html code for form is as follows: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form action=""stockm.php"" method=""post""&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""fdisplay""&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

The trunk recently had branch-A reintegrated which contained a renaming of a subfolder, as well as some revisions to files within that subfolder. Branch-B also contains some different revisions to those files within that subfolder, which still has the original name.</p>

<p>Now, when trying to merge the latest trunk into branch-B, svn simply adds the newly named folder and throws a tree conflict on the originally named folder. In other words, the revisions to the files themselves never get merged and I'm left with both folders. I've tried multiple things in hopes of getting the cleanest merge possible, while retaining all the appropriate svn:mergeinfo, but nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>Does anybody know the correct way to go about completing this merge cleanly?</p>

<p>TortoiseSVN 1.8.10, Subversion 1.8.11</p>

<p>Here's a visual:</p>

<pre><code>/trunk (before reintegrating branch-A)
  /Folder1
    file1
    file2
    file3

/trunk (after reintegrating branch-A)
  /Folder1-Renamed
    file1-change1
    file2-change1
    file3

/branch-B
  /Folder1
    file1-change2
    file2-change2
    file3

"12581365","1","","","2012-09-25 10:46:37","","1","347","<p>I am using Symfony2 with Doctrine2 and MySQL.</p>

<p>I created 2 entities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Article</li>
<li>Tag
With a many-to-many link between them.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am trying, from a list of ID of tags, to get the OR and the AND of the Articles.</p>

<p>An exemple may be better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Article1 &lt;-> Tag1, Tag2</li>
<li>Article2 &lt;-> Tag2, Tag3, Tag4</li>
<li>Article3 &lt;-> Tag1, Tag4</li>
</ul>

<p>I would from a list of my ID of tags [2, 3], do a AND and a OR request, to get some articles:</p>

<ul>
<li>AND => [Article2] is the only which contains the both tags.</li>
<li>OR => [Article1, Article2] are the only which have the tag2 and tag3</li>
</ul>

<p>I successed to do the OR query with multiple requests in the PHP code with a loop, which is really not optimized at all. And I am afraid to do a combinatorial explosion with the number of requests for the AND.
I know there is a proper way to do it in MySQL with JOIN, and I guess Doctrine2 language, both in one request, but the more doc I read and try, the more I figure out that it is not my computing level.</p>

<p>If anybody can help me on this point, I will be thankful.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is my current solution, which is not optimized:</p>

<pre><code>class TagRepository extends EntityRepository
{
    public function getItemsFromIds($ids)
    {
        $qb = $this-&gt;createQueryBuilder('a');
        $qb-&gt;where('a.id IN (:ids)')
            -&gt;setParameter('ids', $ids);

        return $qb-&gt;getQuery()-&gt;getResult();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my DefaultController.php, in the function which process the stuff :</p>

<pre><code>$finalarticles = array();

$tagsrepository = $this-&gt;getDoctrine()
                   -&gt;getEntityManager()
                   -&gt;getRepository('ElephantTagsBundle:Tag');

$tags = $tagsrepository-&gt;getItemsFromIds($tagids);
$nbtags = count($tags);

foreach ($tags as $tag) {
    $articles = $tag-&gt;getArticles();
    foreach ($articles as $article) {
        $articlestags = $article-&gt;getTags();
        $tmpnbtags = 0;
        foreach ($articlestags as $articlestag) {
            if (in_array($articlestag-&gt;getId(), $tagids))
                $tmpnbtags += 1;
        }
        if ($tmpnbtags == $nbtags)
            $finalarticles[$article-&gt;getId()] = $article;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this method include 3 for loops (+one in the ""array_in"" I guess), which include a lot of MySQL call too. I am sure there is a proper way to do it in the repository!</p>

Now I need to use the Gson.fromJson method with the type of parameter to specify the return type so that GSON will take care of it for me.</p>

<p>I have created a generic class called RestResponse such:</p>

<pre><code>public class RestResponse&lt;T&gt; {
  private   String      errorMessage;
  private   int         errorReason;

  }

  /**
   * Does this response contain an error?
   * @return true if in error
   */
  public boolean isInError(){
    return getErrorMessage()!=null;
  }

  /**
   * @return the errorMessage
   */
  public String getErrorMessage() {
    return errorMessage;
  }

  /**
   * @param errorMessage the errorMessage to set
   */
  public void setErrorMessage(String errorMessage) {
    this.errorMessage = errorMessage;

  public int getErrorReason() {
    return errorReason;
  }

  /**

   * @param errorReason the errorReason to set
   */
  public void setErrorReason(int errorReason) {
    this.errorReason = errorReason;
  }

  /**
   * The result of the method call
   * @return the result or null if nothing was returned
   */
  public final T getResult() {
    return result;
  }

  /**
   * The result of the method call
   * @param result the result to set or null if nothing was returned
   */
  public final void setResult(T result) {
    this.result = result;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to create the resulting type on the other side. I have a generic method that I use to decode these things and either throw the exception or return the result.</p>

<p>So my method is like this:</p>

<pre><code>public Object submitUrl(String url, Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) throws AjApiException {
</code></pre>

<p>Where clazz is the type that will be specified on RestResponse.</p>

<p>I then go to create the RestResponse before passing to GSON:</p>

<pre><code>Type typeOfT = new TypeToken&lt;RestResponse&lt;clazz&gt;&gt;(){}.getType(); //1--&gt;What goes here?
RestResponse&lt;clazz&gt; restResponse; //2--&gt;and here?
</code></pre>

<p>And it errors. Can someone tell me what goes in these to places in place of clazz?</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>By setting the <code>required</code> property, I'm able to ask OpenID providers (such as Google) for some user details. If my research is correct, this is called <em>""Attribute Exchange""</em>.</p>

<p>Now, here I've got to problems (to keep this short):</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Only a couple or so providers list the attributes they support. I think I'm missing something here, thought it would be obvious of providers to list these attributes. By any chance, is there some way I could ""discover"" these attributes through protocol?</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> This is the main problem I'm facing. Basically, the information (attributes) I requested are passed over to my server after the user successfully logs in and approves. This is fine and normal - there won't be persistent storage of this data unless my system does it. The problem, however, is that I need to get this data some time <em>after</em> the user did log in.</p>

<p>If I had to do this with Facebook, it would be using <code>$fb-&gt;api('/me');</code>. Interestingly enough, if I redirect the user to the login page while he is logged in, he gets redirected to my website with the information I need. But this process needs to be done on the server, and I guess a simple CURL request to the provider won't get me those fields. Perhaps something from the original login response parameters might help?</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR;</strong> How do I get Attribute Exchange fields <em>after</em> the user logged in without persistent storage from my side?</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I'm using sessions as persistent storage; for now I'm just storing the openid identity url, but I can add more stuff if needed. However, I just can't store all the fields given by the openid login response (name, surname, email etc).</p>

<p><strong>Misc Links / Notes</strong></p>

<p>I must admit there's a lot of stuff in OpenID I don't fully understand. As such, I'll try to keep some notes or ""facts"" which might help future readers.</p>

<p>(When I don't stringify the val at the beginning it will loop, but that's because the if statements are then true, but stop working when false.. So maybe It's better to modify my if statement for that, but I'm still puzzled as to how the .push stops working?)</p>

<p>I don't know whether to answer my own question or do this edit.  Looks like having an empty track may have caused this somehow.  When the map has track a RMAnnotation * and a track everything was fine.  When I load a map with an empty track, that is with no points in it the trouble and errors show up.  If there are no points I don't add the annotation and I no longer get the errors.</p>

<p>It might miss  a div or two because I copy-pasted it but when using the masonry plugin without json ( for fixed values it loads perfectly ).</p>

<p>now the CSS file: </p>

<pre><code>#container .grid-sizer  { width:100%;}
#container .item        { width:15%; margin: 14px 7px 0px; background-color:#fff; border-radius: 4px 4px 4px 4px; box-shadow: 0px 4px 5px #888888; }
#container .item img    { width:100%; height:400%%; border-radius: 4px 4px 0px 0px; }
#container .item img:hover { background:none repeat scroll rgba(255,255,255,0.1) }
#container .item w2 { width:200%; }
/*placed .open-modal at 400px so I can garantee that page remains in same position on when modals opened*/
.open-modal{
    position: relative;
    top: 400px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, this is it, I'm having quite a trouble to make this working and I'm totaly blank on this (  probably because I'm new to html and CSS, my expertise is on android - even the asynk tasks of android are really more easy for me and probably I'm having problems in that but if some one could give me a piece of working code I'll be trully greatfull and start to try to understand it .</p>

What I want to do is 'making' the model of a QTableView in the class containing my data. In C# I could return a DataSet from a static method in a class containing all my stuff concerning this data, and bind this dataset to my table or list.</p>

<pre><code>public class Books
{
   //properties
   ...

   //construtors etc...
   ...

   static DataSet BookData()
   {
       // fill my dataset
       return myDataSet;
   }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>In the main program I then bind my DataSet with the control I wanted to use<br/></p>

<p>Is there a way to do so in Qt / C++ doing the same so that I can write something like:</p>

<pre><code>QSqlTableModel* Books::BookData()
{
    // Create an QSqlTableModel
    // Fill it with my data
    return model; // or whatever is possible
}

<p>in the main program:</p>

<pre><code>...

1. It bases on spring 3,quartz 1.6.1 and httpclient 4.1.2 to parse pages. <br>
2. Basically its jobs will be run 1 or 12 times in one hour(most of them are once per hour). <br>
3. All of their concurrent use default value. <br>
My problem is the job stops running occasionally. This issue has happened twice last month. When the issue raised up last time, I did these things:<br>
1. Checked progress and logs. The progress was still alive. But all the business logs had stopped writing for a long time.<br>
2. Checked the gc log and it seemed all right. <br>
3. Exported thread dump of this progress with jstack. <br>
Although I get the thread dump, I don't know how to interpret it. Could someone please help me with this? <br>

<pre><code>var type = System.Type.GetType (typeName, throwOnError: false);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>typeName</code> looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epsitec.Lydia.EventStore.TestBinaryEventStore+SimpleEvent, Tests.Lydia.Framework, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=361fc18aa5d4142d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the type did not match exactly (e.g. because the <code>Version</code> part of the fully
qualified type name diverged), I used to get a <code>System.IO.FileLoadException</code> with previous versions of .NET 4.5.x. Since I got my latest <em>Windows Update</em> delivered, which coincidentally contains .NET 4.5.2, I no longer get an exception if I do not specify the exact same <em>version</em>.</p>

<p>I initially thought this was caused by a new behaviour of <code>GetType</code> in .NET 4.5.2, but this seems not to be the case. I did not find any information about this change in <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171868(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN's documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I tried replicating this behaviour in a project outside of an xUnit test, but then I get the expected behaviour (<code>System.IO.FileLoadException</code> gets thrown
because the type does not match).</p>

<p>What am I missing here? Any idea as to how I should proceed with my investivations?</p>

<p>I used <code>Fuslogvw</code> to investigate further. The type resolution does indeed <strong>fail</strong> as this trace shows:</p>

<h3>Still more context</h3>

<p>I am running the code from within an xUnit test which is also referencing
multiple other libraries. Trying to duplicate this outside of the original solution still does not exhibit the issue.</p>

<p>How could a referenced assembly tweak <code>GetType</code> in such a way that it would
suddenly ignore the <em>version</em> part of the assembly qualified type name?</p>

<p>How can I get the combination of colums where the correlation is, for example, higher than 0.5, but the columns are not equal? So in this case, the output needs to be something like:</p>

<pre><code>[('height', 'weight')]

<pre><code>correlated = []
for column1 in columns:
    for column2 in columns:
        if column1 != column2:
            correlation = df[column1].corr(df[column2])
            if correlation &gt; 0.5 and (column2, column1) not in correlated:
                correlated.append((column1, column2))

<p>In which df is my original dataframe. This outputs the desired result:</p>

There is also a mercurial plugin for Jira!</p>

<p>UPDATE: I saw a link on the MercurialEclipse plugin page for <a href=""http://javaforge.com/project/CBES"" rel=""nofollow"">Code Beamer Eclipse Studio</a> - to connect to Code Beamer. This integrates with mercurial, so would provide the all-in-one functionality I want. But.... I went to the Code Beamer website and I can't figure out what it does, or if it would work for us. We need a system to creat issues/bug/feature requests, and then be able to move them through a workflow - open, assigned, in-progress, in-testing, ready for upload, test-on-production, completed. something like that.

I have a SQL 2008 R2 Enterprise edition where I have enabled TDE encryption in one of the databases. One of the stored procedures from the encrypted database is using a table variable (@t1), table that gets populated with almost 600K records. Then there is a select statement that uses a join between this table and another table from the encrypted database (t2), on t2 tables I have around 20 mil rows. 
This join takes forever to complete( last time took almost 4h). If I use instead of the table variable a tempoarary table (#t3) and do the same join the result is instant. Also if I run join between these 2 tables in another server where I do not have TDE encryption ( same SQL 2008 R2) , the join finish in seconds
So did anybody encounter similar problems with table variables and encrypted databases using TDE?
This is how I encrypted the database:</p>

CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY

ALTER DATABASE DBTest

</code></pre>

<p>I can code a solution myself but I am more interested in using library functionality so the preferred solution should use the Scala library where possible while remaining compact and moderately legible.</p>

<p>This second example illustrates the required transformation with a map with more than one entry.</p>

<p>From this,</p>

<pre><code>Map (
   10 -&gt; List(""10a"", ""10b"", ""10c""),
   29 -&gt; List(""29a"", ""29b"", ""29c"")
)

<p>to this,</p>

<pre><code>List(
  Map(
    10 -&gt; ""10a"",
    29 -&gt; ""29a""),
  Map(
    10 -&gt; ""10b"",
    29 -&gt; ""29b""),
  Map(
    10 -&gt; ""10c"",
    29 -&gt; ""29c"")
)
</code></pre>

<p>It can be assumed that all values are lists of the same size.</p>

<p>Optionally the solution could handle the case where the values are empty lists but that is not required.  If the solution supports empty list values then this input,</p>

<pre><code>Map (
   ""a"" -&gt; List()
)
</code></pre>

<p>should result in <code>List()</code>.</p>

<p>I want to create a monadic verb of rank 1 that applies to each list in this list of lists. It will double (<code>+:</code>) or add 1 (<code>&gt;:</code>) to each alternate item in the list. If we were to apply this verb to the first row, we'd get <code>2 3 6 5 10</code>.</p>

<p>It's fairly easy to get a list of booleans which alternate with each item, e.g., <code>0 1 $~{:$ m</code> gives us <code>0 1 0 1 0</code>. I thought, <em>aha!</em> I'll use something like <code>+:</code>&#96;<code>&gt;: @.</code> followed by some expression, but I could never quite get it to work.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>AppConfiguration is a static class with static properties with values from web.config.
Logger is a instance of Logger class.</p>

<p>In global.asax is a piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        AppConfiguration.ReadConfiguration();
        AppConfiguration.Logger.WriteMessage(""Start app"");
    }
    protected void Application_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        AppConfiguration.Logger.WriteMessage(""End app"");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is, that App_Start is called on every request a inserted value to cache is immediately removed...</p>

<p>this is a part of log file:</p>

<p>10.8.2013 17:14:22: Start app.</p>

<p>10.8.2013 17:14:23: Insert cache key  CACHE_MENU_USER_DEMO\Administrator from now to: 8/17/2013 5:14:23 PM</p>

<p>10.8.2013 17:14:23: Key CACHE_MENU_USER_DEMO\Administrator was removed for reason: CacheItemRemovedReason.Removed</p>

<p>10.8.2013 17:14:23: End app.</p>

<p>a this is repeated with every request. </p>

<p>I was trying start application in IIS Express, i trying start application in server (IIS7, Windows server 2008 R2) and it is still the same...</p>

<p>Any idea what is wrong with cache and global.asax?
Thanks</p>

<p>I have an HTML page which should display the <code>fullname</code> at various places (divs) depending on the <code>id</code>. 
In order to avoid firing the jQuery for each <code>div</code>, I thought I can store the response on page load and use another method to get the <code>fullname</code>.
Here is what I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>function getUserName(ID){
    var username;
    console.log("" getUserName called"");
    for(var index in UserDBObj){
        if (UserDBObj[index] == ID)
        {
            username = UserDBObj[index].fullname;
            console.log(""Got username : ""+ username);
        }
     }
    return username;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I call <code>getUserName(id)</code> for the respective div where the name has to be shown.
However this is not working because the ajax call is asynchronous and <code>getUserName(id)</code> is getting called even before the data is acquired.</p>

<p>Any suggestion how to achieve this? I have seen similar questions but none of them appeared conclusive.</p>

<p>What I noticed is that there's no real delay until the very last line where it's getting the response code.  I think what's happening is that the data is getting buffered so it looks like it has uploaded it, but hasn't really - it has just buffered it.  Then when i get to the getResponseCode() call, it has no choice but to finish the upload to get the upload status.  is there any way to make it actually upload along the way so i can get a reasonable progress?</p>

<p>Things to consider:</p>

<li>How long does a PHP script expects to run? Do we need to collect anything for short scripts?</li>
<li>Is large memory usage OK for server scripts? This is how Java achieves high through-put. Lower memory usage needs more eager collection.</li>
<li>Can we accept pause-times within a script? If so, maybe we don't need an incremental collector.</li>

<p><code>some_function</code> is defined in <code>dlmalloc.c</code> and used inside <code>pthreads.cpp</code>. Does it have to do with the fact that <code>dlmalloc.c</code> is a C source code file and others are C++ files.

The project is ASP.Net deployed on IIS.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Request form.</li>
<li>Fill personal details.</li>
<li>Click button ""Add Items"" to open items selection window.</li>
<li>Select items and close the item selection windows.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Expected</strong>:
Back in Request form, it is now showing both the personal details, entered in
step 2 and now, on the same request page, the list of selected items, selected in step 4.</p>

<p><strong>Actual</strong>:
Back in request form, not showing personal details and only showing
the selected items.</p>

<hr>

<p>From the code I learn that every field on the request form is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Saved to the session (E.g onChange in JavaScript call code-behind save
function)</li>
<li>Load from the session on Page_Load</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess the above is needed as a replacment machanism for the ViewState,
because in the above scenario it is required for the form fields (E.g personal
details) to persist across several pages. (The opening of other windows
to add items...)</p>

<p>Also from the code I learn that items added on ""Add Items"" windows are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Saved to the session in the page ""Add Items""</li>
<li>Loaded from the session in the Page_Load of page ""Request""</li>
</ol>

<p>Now instead of working on the project over at the customer's offices we copied
the project and deployed it back in our offices - only problem is now it is
working fine - that is, both the personal details and the list of selected
items are showing as expected.</p>

<p>I would like any suggestions... What could be the cause of such
behavior?<br>
Also in case I will not be able to recreate the problem on my environment, 
what should I check/debug on the customer's office?</p>

<p>Currently I load data in steps (I am not following SQL syntax below, just the algorithm):</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
TRUNCATE table
COPY into table
ANALYZE table
COMMIT
</code></pre>

<p>Before <code>PostgreSQL 9.3</code> this was the only recommended way to re-load a table. Version <code>9.3</code> introduces <code>FREEZE</code> option that can be used with <code>COPY</code> command. Standard documentation says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FREEZE</p>
  
  <p>Requests copying the data with rows already frozen, just as
  they would be after running the VACUUM FREEZE command. This is
  intended as a performance option for initial data loading. Rows will
  be frozen only if the table being loaded has been created or truncated
  in the current subtransaction, there are no cursors open and there are
  no older snapshots held by this transaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My immediate question is whether I still need to run <code>ANALYZE</code> after <code>COPY/FREEZE</code>. The standard doc doesn't give any direct recommendation on it. Would the following sequence suffice or do I still need to run <code>ANALYZE</code>?</p>

<p>I have 1 program that logs its actions to a txt file continuously while it is running. It never closes the file while it is running. I cannot modify this program.</p>

<p>I want to monitor this file with my other application (written in VB.NET VS 2005). My problem is that it appears that data being written to this log doesn't register immediately.</p>

<p>I've tried using a FileSystemWatch to watch the file for updates. The problem with this approach is that I don't get notified immediately of data being written. Manually browsing  to the folder with explorer and then sorting it triggers the changed event though (don't ask me why). I would probably also get notified if the file was closed by the other app. </p>

<p>I've also tried just polling the file and reading its last write date. This definitely only works if the file is being closed after every write.</p>

<p>Is there any way to accomplish this monitoring without having the application writing to the log close the file and reopen it or manually access the folder being written.</p>

<p>Here is my code for the file watch:</p>

<pre><code>    If IO.File.Exists(recorder_path) Then
        Dim recorder_dir As String = recorder_path.Remove(recorder_path.LastIndexOf(""\""))
        Dim recorder_name As String = recorder_path.Substring(recorder_path.LastIndexOf(""\"") + 1)

        recorder_watcher = New System.IO.FileSystemWatcher()
        recorder_watcher.Path = recorder_dir
        recorder_watcher.Filter = recorder_name
        recorder_watcher.NotifyFilter = NotifyFilters.Size
        AddHandler recorder_watcher.Changed, AddressOf recorder_update
        recorder_watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = True
    End If

    Private Sub recorder_update(ByVal source As Object, ByVal event_args As System.IO.FileSystemEventArgs)
        'Do Stuff
    End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I'm running this app on W7 and XP and only accessing local folders.</p>

<h2><strong>UPDATE, Another approach:</strong></h2>

<p>The below code seems to work quickly enough:</p>

<pre><code>    Dim new_txt As String = """"

    Dim fs As New FileStream(recorder_path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite)
    Dim file_reader = New StreamReader(fs)
    file_reader.ReadToEnd()

    While 1
        new_txt = """"
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5)
        System.Windows.Forms.Application.DoEvents()

        new_txt += file_reader.ReadToEnd().ToUpper()
        If (new_txt.Length &gt; 0)
           'Do stuff w/new txt
        End If
    End While
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to give me updates every time the logging process writes to the file.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>So I checked the url of my outbound.php and realized that there is a PHP error here.  The error is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fatal error: Class 'Response' not found in
  /home/......./outbound.php on line 16</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After some searching, I can't find anyone else discussing this same problem.  Finally, the worst part, I can't even find any reference to a Response class in the Twilio Helper Library.</p>

<p>Here is my entire code block for the page in question.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

    // A message for Twilio's TTS engine to repeat
    $sayMessage = 'Thanks for contacting our sales department. If this were a 
        real click to call application, we would redirect your call to our 
        sales team right now using the Dial tag.';

    $twiml = new Services_Twilio_Twiml();
    $twiml-&gt;say($sayMessage, array('voice' =&gt; 'alice'));
    // $response-&gt;dial('+12345675309');

    $response = Response::make($twiml, 200);
    $response-&gt;header('Content-Type', 'text/xml');
    return $response;

<p>On my linux machine at home I use 3 year old Linux Mint setup with a dual core <em>(the machine is 3 years old not Linux Mint install)</em>, using: make -j2 both cores are used full(ish) and compiles the code relatively quick, around 10 minutes from clean build.</p>

<p>However on my work Windows PC which is 2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Quad (XP) I can never seem to get the compiles to be as fast as my Linux box.  The developer docs for the program recommend using Visual Studio C++ using the project file generated from cmake but that only seems to use one core and takes well over a hour to compile vs about 10 minutes (from clean build) on my Linux install.</p>

<p>I have tred using <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAC&amp;url=http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2009/03/27/speeding-up-visual-c-qt-builds/&amp;rct=j&amp;q=jom%20qt&amp;ei=ky6VTsqoN-uTiAeSwsSHBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYl0IBb7iewb52bsXBJ3OiDeJpbw&amp;sig2=4FLQu_xxWtzUMqbt9YVkgw"">jom</a> but even when using all the cores it still takes around an hour and half because it only seems to use small amounts of cpu on each core.</p>

<p>My problem is that <code>INFO</code> messages of <code>es_logger</code> are displayed also on the terminal. As a matter of fact the log messages are saved to the right files!</p>

<p>If I remover the part related to <code>logger</code>, then the ES logging works fine, i.e. only saved to the corresponding files. But then I don't have the other part.... What is it that I'm doing wrong with the last part of the settings?</p>

<hr>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>Possible hint: In the sources of <code>elasticsearch-py</code> there's a logger named <code>logger</code>. Could it be that it conflicts with mine? I tried to change the name of <code>logger</code> to <code>main_logger</code> in the lines above but it didn't help.</p>

<p>Possible hint 2: If I replace <code>logger = logging.getLogger('mainLog')</code> with <code>logger = logging.getLogger()</code>, then the format of the output to the console of <code>es_logger</code> changes and becomes identical to the one defined in the snippet.</p>

<p>I want to install glibc 2.21 from source.  (I realize we're days away from Fedora 22 release, but this question will apply next time I'm interested in installing a more recent version of glibc.)</p>

<p>Running configure on the 2.21 source says:</p>

<pre><code>On GNU/Linux systems the GNU C Library should not be installed into
/usr/local since this might make your system totally unusable.
</code></pre>

<p>It references to see the glibc faq, which then says:</p>

<pre><code>The GNU C compiler treats /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib in a special
way, these directories will be searched before the system directories. Since
on GNU/Linux the system directories /usr/include and /usr/lib contain a ---
possibly different --- version of glibc and mixing certain files from
different glibc installations is not supported and will break, you risk
breaking your complete system. If you want to test a glibc installation, use
another directory as argument to --prefix. If you like to install this glibc
version as default version, overriding the existing one, use --prefix=/usr
and everything will go in the right places.
</code></pre>

<p>I'm debating which way I want to go (a separate directory other than /usr/local, or overriding in /usr).</p>

<p>But, I noticed somewhere that said if you're going to do this, you want to make sure to use the same configure options your linux distribution used.</p>

<p>So, I downloaded glibc-2.20-8.fc21.src.rpm and extracted it.  For the first time, I've seen what the linux distributions are doing to the upstream code.  There's 48 .patch files, 3 extra .c files, an extra .h file, and some .conf files.</p>

<p>Is it (and if so, how is it) safe to ever install glibc from source, regardless of if you're using a second (non /usr/local) location or overwriting in /usr?</p>

<p>All those patches the RedHat/Fedora repository ""people"" have made are going to be skipped.  (I assume these distribution-specific patches are important...) How are so many places saying upgrading glibc is generally safe?</p>

<p>For that matter, if many distribution packages have this amount of distribution customization, how does building anything from source even work?  I've been running trunk source builds of gcc and gdb for a long time, and occasionally run into bumps because it isn't release code, but it generally works... I don't get how those work now, either, without the distribution repository patches.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM profile WHERE id = 'id_that_doesnt_exist' and project_id = 1;
  Execution time: 36.75s
</code></pre>

<p>versus</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profile WHERE id = 'id_that_doesnt_exist' and project_id = 1;
  Execution time: 0.2s
</code></pre>

<p>Given that the table is sorted by <code>project_id</code> then <code>id</code> I would have thought this is just a key lookup. The <code>SELECT COUNT(*) ...</code> returns 0 results in 0.2sec which is about what I would expect. The <code>SELECT * ...</code> returns 0 results in 37.75sec. That's a huge difference for the same result and I don't understand why?</p>

<p>If it helps schema as follows:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE profile (
    project_id integer not null,
    id varchar(256) not null,
    created timestamp not null,
    /* ... approx 50 other columns here */
)
DISTKEY(id)
SORTKEY(project_id, id);

<p>Explain from <code>SELECT COUNT(*) ...</code></p>

<pre><code>XN Aggregate  (cost=435.70..435.70 rows=1 width=0)
  -&gt;  XN Seq Scan on profile  (cost=0.00..435.70 rows=1 width=0)

I have dowloaded and pretty much tested an installation of VS2008ProEdition90dayTrialENUX1435622.iso without any problems on the XP computer.
The Vista computer (where I need to do my work and where I have all the hard drive space, etc) has been pretty eventful -- in a bad way.
It seemed that the iso file, itself did not download correctly.  So I did it a few times.  When I ran the installer, it did some sort of file extraction on a first step (71 files, I remember) and it seemd to die on the same file.
My Vista computer has a brand new OS and a brand new hard drive.  I do not understand why it is giving me so much trouble.
Eventually I resorted to FTP'ing the iso file along with all the extracted files from my XP computer to my Vista computer.
Then I managed to get further.
But it still behaves strangely.
One thing I notice is that the license agreement is missing.
<img src=""http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h292/Athono/wtf.jpg"" alt=""alt text"" />
That is pretty wierd.
When I get to the point where I am supposed to start the installation, the installer lights up with errors.
There are so many that I do not know where to begin.
<img src=""http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h292/Athono/wtf2.jpg"" alt=""alt text"" />
Where do I begin?
I have tried running the iso from a virtual drive with the DAEMON toolset. That did not make a difference.
I have tried running as an Administrator.  That did not make a difference.
I have tried shutting down all programs and even uninstalling anti-virus programs.  That did not make a difference.
I have used the windows DVD burn utility to burn the files onto a DVD and run it from there.  That did not make a difference.</p>

<p>And the wierdness continues.  The   C:\Users...\AppData\Local\Temp\dd_error_vs_procore_90.txt
has error messages that read that there is a problem copying from the F drive.  Well, I do not have an F drive.</p>

<p>I have even gone so far is to create a virtual F drive through a network connection to myself pointing to the DVD drive.
That did not work either.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Yes, I have posted this question with the Microsoft People.  I am waiting for an answer.  Maybe StackOverflow can beat them.</p>

the first number i should be rounded up to the closest integer. the second number j should be rounded up to an integer that does not have any common factors with i, and k should be rounded up to an integer that does not have any common factor with both i and j and so on. So I am looking for an algorithm that would round up all the numbers j, k, and n to have no common divisors with i. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Implement a diffusion limited aggregation simulation on a toroid plane where seeds are randomly created, and particles move randomly. they move if they particles do not land near a seed or a particle. where user inputs seeds (red pixels), particles (black pixels), steps (no or iterations), plane size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My code is very slow. How can I make it faster?</p>

<p>I randomly created x and y coordinates and drew  red pixels (seeds), then randomly  created x and y for black pixels (particles), if a black pixel lands where there is a red or black pixel it can stay, otherwise it moves randomly again until there are no more particles . If the pixel lands out of borders like  x > border then x=0; if x &lt;1 then x= border. The same for y. </p>

<p>This just means that if it lands on the border I move it to the opposite border.  Then checks for the neighboring pixels again. I have an outer loop to create the seeds, and inner loop for the particles. In the inner loop I check for the x,y positions:</p>

<pre><code>//Place, move, and ""stick"" the particles; stop if either steps or particles = 0

<p>I'm sure I need some more configuration, but I don't know where to start. There are similar questions on stackoverflow etc., but I believe they don't really give an answer on how to do this.</p>

I was wondering if there was a short-hand way of querying an object's <code>RevisionHistory</code> based on a particular <code>QueryDate</code> date instead of having to use the following query structure:</p>

<pre><code>var results = EntityObject.Revisions.Where(x =&gt;
    (x.DateEffectiveFrom == null &amp;&amp; x.DateEffectiveTo == null) ||
    (x.DateEffectiveFrom == null &amp;&amp; x.DateEffectiveTo &gt;= QueryDate) ||
    (x.DateEffectiveFrom &lt;= QueryDate &amp;&amp; x.DateEffectiveTo == null) ||
    (x.DateEffectiveFrom &lt;= QueryDate &amp;&amp; x.DateEffectiveTo &gt;= QueryDate));
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried creating the following boolean function in the <code>Revision</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>partial class Revision
{
    public bool IsEffectiveOn(DateTime date)
    {
        return (x.DateEffectiveFrom == null &amp;&amp; x.DateEffectiveTo == null) ||
            (x.DateEffectiveFrom == null &amp;&amp; x.DateEffectiveTo &gt;= date) ||
            (x.DateEffectiveFrom &lt;= date &amp;&amp; x.DateEffectiveTo == null) ||
            (x.DateEffectiveFrom &lt;= date &amp;&amp; x.DateEffectiveTo &gt;= date));
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then updating the query to:</p>

<pre><code>var results = EntityObject.Revisions.Where(x =&gt; x.IsEffectiveOn(QueryDate));
</code></pre>

<p>but this obviously doesn't translate to SQL.  Any ideas would be much appreciated.</p>

Since then apparently a number of the views have stopped working. My colleague has said hes fixed the problem by dropping the views and recreating them.</p>

<p>As far as Im concerened the server admin password should have nothing to do with the views, as the application that runs them is using SQL authentication with its own login. </p>

<p>Any ideas what could have caused this? All the views seem to be in the DBO schema and not tied to any particular user account.  I'm not convinced its anything to do with the server admin login password changing but just wanted to hear your thoughts.</p>

1. Combine and Minify JS and CSS (such as might be done with a tool like Browserify)
2. Compress images
3. Asynchronous loading/injection of JS and CSS (script loaders, atomify, etc)
4. Static asset versioning for cache-busting (grunt-usemin, etc)</p>

<p>To give an example answer, right now I have removed static asset versioning and instead have our global.js and global.css files non-versioned and with a short expiry time. This is because mod_pagespeed quickly versions them with huge expires anyway.</p>

But wordpress will not allow these tags. whenever the client tries to edit a post, WP removes all the HTML tags it considers ""illegal"".</p>

<p>So I went on the search. First I tried to install some recommended plugins I found for this problem (such as  <a href=""http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/enable-raw-html-disable-corruption/"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>). Didn't work at all for me (for some others it did i believe)...</p>

<p>Then I found a post that told me to add a function to the function.php file which will remove the filters :</p>

<pre><code>function mod_mce($initArray) {
$initArray['verify_html'] = false;
return $initArray;
}
add_filter('tiny_mce_before_init', 'mod_mce');
</code></pre>

<p>and also this:</p>

<pre><code>function my_tinymce( $init ) {
$ext = 'div[id|name|class|style]';

if ( isset( $init['extended_valid_elements'] ) ) {
    $init['extended_valid_elements'] .= ',' . $ext;
} else {
    $init['extended_valid_elements'] = $ext;
}
 return $init;
} 
add_filter( 'tiny_mce_before_init', 'my_tinymce' );
</code></pre>

<p>functions from <a href=""http://wordpress.org/support/topic/visual-editor-now-strips-html-comments-new-in-32"" rel=""nofollow"">this thread</a>.
Nope, didn't work also...</p>

<p>Someone - any idea? It seems so silly, but there is so much debate around this subject...

<p>Not what I want, because the preprocessor tokens are being treated as text and match the code_block rule.</p>

<p>I read the ""Islands in the Stream"" chapter in the ANTLR book, and the XML example makes sense, but it relies on TEXT not containing two specific characters:</p>

<pre><code>TEXT : ~[&lt;&amp;]+ ;

<p>If I really have to, I suppose I could exclude the # character:</p>

<pre><code>TEXT : ~[#]+ ;

<p>I am attempting to write a Portable Class Library which will run on Ios, Android, Windows Phone, and Windows 7 and up.</p>

<p>Early in my project, while attempting to set up some basic unit tests, I bumped up against IsolatedStorage.  Okay, I can store my files in IsolatedStorage.  But Windows 7 and 8 do not have this class (that I can see).  (Because of this obstacle I temporarily switched to a dll.  I will go back to a pcl once I get these questions answered.)</p>

<p>So now I want to abstract the file system such that when I target different targets, it uses IsolatedStorage when it should and the Windows file system when it should.</p>

<p>Also, regarding unit testing (which I do in Debug Configuration), I could put the directory anywhere, so I could just choose, Directory.GetCurrent() I suppose.  But I don't want to suppose.</p>

<p><strong>Now for my questions:</strong>  (There are two)</p>

<p>What is the recommended approach to handle this -- getting a single root directory for application data that works for all targets?</p>

<p>I want to have some files for testing which are persisted in a subdirecory of my solution directory.  In my abstracting class (not abstract class, but file-system-abstracting class), should I have code like this:?</p>

<pre><code>AbstractedFileSystem abstractRootPath;
#if DEBUG
   String abstractRootPathString = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();
   abstractRootPath = AbstractedFileSystem.CreateFromString(abstractRootPathString);
#else
   abstractRootPath = AbstractedFileSystem.CreateFromIsolatedStorage();

<p>I have this two-tier document architecture, where a parent document opens and configures the window, providing a list of ""child"" documents.  When the user selects one of the children, that document is opened with the same window controller and it places a <code>NSTextView</code> in the window.  The window controller's document association is changed so that the ""edited dot"" and the window title track the currently selected document.  Think of an Xcode project and what happens when you edit different files in it.</p>

<p>To put the code in pseudo form, a method like this is invoked in the parent document when a child document is opened.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)openChildDocumentWithURL:(NSURL *)documentURL {
  // Don't open the same document multiple times
  NSDocument *childDocument = [documentMapTable objectForKey:documentURL];
  if (childDocument == nil) {
    childDocument = [[[MyDocument alloc] init] autorelease];
    // Use the same window controller
    // (not as bad as it looks, AppKit swaps the window's document association for us)
    [childDocument addWindowController:myWindowController];
    [childDocument readFromURL:documentURL ofType:@""Whatever"" error:NULL];

    // Cache the document
    [documentMapTable setObject:childDocument forKey:documentURL];
  }

  // Make sure the window controller gets the document-association swapped if the doc came from our cache
  [myWindowController setDocument:childDocument];

  // Swap the text views in
  NSTextView *currentTextView = myCurrentTextView;
  NSTextView *newTextView = [childDocument textView];
  [newTextView setFrame:[currentTextView frame]]; // Don't flicker      

  [splitView replaceSubview:currentTextView with:newTextView];

  if (currentTextView != newTextView) {
    [currentTextView release];
    currentTextView = [newTextView retain];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works, and I know the window controller has the correct document association at any given time since the change dot and title follow whichever document I'm editing.</p>

<p>However, when I hit save, (CMD+S, or File -> Save/Save As) it wants to save the parent document, not the current document (as reported by <code>[[NSDocumentController sharedDocumentController] currentDocument]</code> and as indicated by the window title and change dot).</p>

<p>From reading the <code>NSResponder</code> documentation, it seems like the chain should be this:</p>

<p>Current View -> Superview (<em>repeat</em>) -> Window -> WindowController -> Document -> DocumentController -> Application.</p>

<p>I'm unsure how the document based architecture is setting up the responder chain (i.e. how it's placing <code>NSDocument</code> and <code>NSDocumentController</code> into the chain) so I'd like to debug it, but I'm not sure where to look.  How do I access the responder chain at any given time?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I have a few questions regarding this:</p>

<ol>
<li>How should I interpret the --show-reachable block? </li>
<li>Is that block useful for me to try and zero in on the error?</li>
<li>If the block is not useful, does valgrind have another mechanism that would help me trace the leak? </li>
<li>If not, is there some other tool (hopefully OSS on linux) to help me narrow this down?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance..</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Here is the code that I found on my system for the definition of pthread_exit. I'm not certain that this is the actual source that is being invoked. However, if it is, can anyone explain what might be going wrong?</p>

<pre><code>void
pthread_exit (void *retval)
{
    /*  specific to PTHREAD_TO_WINTHREAD  */

    ExitThread ((DWORD) ((size_t) retval));  /*  thread becomes signalled so its death can be waited upon  */
    /*NOTREACHED*/
    assert (0); return;  /*  void fnc; can't return an error code  */

            &lt;%}%&gt;
         &lt;/tbody&gt;
     &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Both the tables have setted the <strong>standard-table-cls</strong> and the <strong>innerTable</strong> classes.</p>

<p>This is the code of the <strong>standard-table-cls</strong> class:</p>

<pre><code>table.standard-table-cls {
    margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px !important;
    width: 100%;
    border : #76818a 1px solid;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    text-align: center;
    font: 11px Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    text-decoration:none;
    color:#76818a;
    table-layout: fixed;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the code of the <strong>innerTable</strong> class (I want that a table that have the <strong>innerTable</strong> class setted have a width=70% of the total space and that it is floated on the right):</p>

<pre><code>.innerTable{
    width: 70%;
    float: right;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that using the previous settings seems that don't see the CSS settings related to the <strong>.innerTable</strong> class.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that if I set the style inline, in this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table border=""1"" class=""standard-table-cls innerTable"" style=""width: 70%; float: right;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>it works.</p>

<p>Why? What am I missing? How can I solve this issue?</p>

<p>I know there are already quite a few threads about dynamic paths but I think my one is unique. </p>

<p>I have a problem with dynamic paths (or is it called relative paths) which this webapp uses a lot and makes testing almost impossible. Several use cases require that you navigate between documents using a treeview which utilizes relative paths which change from time to time. So when I run the script, Selenium IDE often can’t locate the elements it’s supposed to “click” to complete the use case. </p>

<p>How do I solve this? Surely, I’m not the only one with this problem. Is it possible to use a command that just searches for a certain word, and clicks at the element where it is written? Or is there a command that lets you automatically unfold the entire treeview? </p>

<p>Again, there HAS to be a better way to do this. If I keep going with this approach it will be a total pain to delete/add or reorganize survey statements later on.</p>

<p>Any links or tips would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>****SOLUTION****</strong>
I ended up coming up with a solution using looping/echo in php. Here's a rough (not pretty) sample of the code I used to accomplish my task:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
function go(){
document.getElementById('state0').style.display = ""block"";
document.getElementById('state0').scrollIntoView();
}
function showNext(divIdShow,divIdHide){
    document.getElementById(divIdShow).style.display=""block"";

    document.getElementById(divIdHide).style.display=""none"";
    }
function showPrevious(divIdShow,divIdHide){
    document.getElementById(divIdShow).style.display=""block"";

    document.getElementById(divIdHide).style.display=""none"";
    }
&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;button type='button' onclick='go()'&gt;GO&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;!--&lt;button type='button' onclick=""go()""&gt;go&lt;/button&gt;--&gt;
    &lt;?php
    $numElements=5;
    $array = array(""This is the first statement"", ""This is the second statement"",""This is the third statement"",""This is the fourth Statement"", ""Last statement here"");

    for($i=0;$i&lt;$numElements;$i++){

    $divId='state'.$i; 
    $sId='q'.$i;
    $nextInt=$i+1;
    $prevInt=$i-1;
    $nextDiv='state'.$nextInt;
    $curDiv='state'.$i;
    $prevDiv='state'.$prevInt;
    if($i==0){
    echo ""&lt;div id='$divId' class='center' style='display:none'&gt;

1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>The first stores versions (""tags"") a user has saved, along with a commit message. The second table contains the id of the version that is currently ""live"". There is a foreign key on live_tag.tag_id referencing tag(id). live_tag only ever contains a single row. This row is updated when a new version is committed. Before updating the live_tag row I execute this statement:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select tag_id from live_tag for update;
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I run this statement in two terminals, and update the tag_id in one of them, sometimes MySQL returns ""empty set"" in the second terminal instead of the new value:</p>

<pre><code>-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; start transaction;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO
mysql&gt; start transaction;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; select tag_id from live_tag for update;
+--------+
| tag_id |
+--------+
|      2 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO
mysql&gt; select tag_id from live_tag for update;
-- hangs (waiting for lock)

-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; update live_tag set tag_id = 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql&gt; commit;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO returns the following for previous ""select tag_id from live_tag for update""
Empty set (8.54 sec) -- Why empty set?
</code></pre>

<p>I did not delete any rows, I simply updated the one row in live_tag, why isn't MySQL seeing the update?</p>

<p>What's more weird, is that I've noticed if I set live_tag to a higher value than it was previously, the second terminal correctly returns the new value:</p>

<pre><code>-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; start transaction;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO
mysql&gt; start transaction;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; select tag_id from live_tag for update;
+--------+
| tag_id |
+--------+
|      1 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO
mysql&gt; select tag_id from live_tag for update;
-- hangs (waiting for lock)

-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; update live_tag set tag_id = 2;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql&gt; commit;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO returns the following for previous ""select tag_id from live_tag for update""
+--------+
| tag_id |
+--------+
|      2 |
+--------+
-- this is correct
</code></pre>

<p>The problem only occurs when I set tag_id to a LOWER value than it was previously.</p>

<p>Is this something due to the foreign key constraint on tag_id? Or because I'm selecting all rows in the table (no 'where' clause)?</p>

<p>What I've already tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>After dropping the keys on live_tag.tag_id, it works correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>I added an id column to live_tag, and limited my 'select for update' with 'where id = 1'. This also works correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried this with three terminals. After committing 1, 2 immediately returns empty set. A few seconds later, 3 also returns empty set (even though I haven't committed 2).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm fine with adding the id column to the table, but still curious about this odd behavior? I've tried googling and searching here, but haven't found an answer.</p>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>Barmar's theory seems correct, since I tried his suggested test, and got only 1 row in the response:</p>

<pre><code>-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; start transaction;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO
mysql&gt; start transaction;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; select tag_id from live_tag for update;
+--------+
| tag_id |
+--------+
|      2 |
|      3 |
+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO
mysql&gt; select tag_id from live_tag for update;
-- hangs

-- TERMINAL ONE
mysql&gt; update live_tag set tag_id=1 where tag_id=2;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql&gt; update live_tag set tag_id=4 where tag_id=3;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql&gt; select * from live_tag;
+--------+
| tag_id |
+--------+
|      1 |
|      4 |
+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql&gt; commit;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- TERMINAL TWO returns
+--------+
| tag_id |
+--------+
|      4 |
+--------+
1 row in set (34.02 sec)

I was wondering if anyone knew what is the most suitable dataset I need and from where I can get it from. Is it a better approach to specialise in a certain area (ie Heart disease, diabetes etc) or should I classify patients on the whole, based on all types off illnesses? Ideally I want the dataset to be based on patients visits to their doctor. Therefore it should contain symptons and the diagnosis. However if I can get a dataset that contains other attributes such as age, gender etc then that would be even better. If anyone can help me and point me towards a suitable dataset then I would appreciate it. Thanks</p>

<p>When user finishes editing, the datagridview should refresh and display only those records which satisfy the gird's dataview criteria. so at the end of EndEdit i call doubleClick event of a control which populates the grid again according to the criteria. this approach works fine as long as the edit is complete. but if the user is still in edit mode &amp; any other cell of the <strong>same</strong> datagridview is clicked i get this exception.</p>

<p>Ok dudes, here's the problem. I've got a full background slideshow which I would like to sync up with some text that will appear on screen. As you can see, this text is represented by the 'p' fadeIns. My problem is that my current method for ensuring that the text always appears on the correct background slide is just to delay the last image, which is less than ideal as it goes out of sync. I'd appreciate someone telling me a better way this can be done :D I was thinking we could tell the fadeIn function to activate as soon as the first background image appears on screen, but an unsure how to do this.</p>

<p>My question concerns the fifth parameter passed in <code>updateExistingCredentialsSection</code> to <code>updateExistingSection</code>, the <code>() =&gt; new[] { createNode(USER_TAG, doc, newUser), ... }</code> one.  It was my understanding that those <code>createNode</code> calls will not occur unless that lambda expression is called in <code>updateExistingSection</code>, right?  Likewise for the <code>updateExistingLeafNode</code> calls in the last parameter given to <code>updateExistingSection</code>.</p>

<p>Also, from a design perspective, does either method look ridiculous?  Do you see a way I could make either method smaller, or require fewer parameters?  I've been trying to DRY things out, which is what led to writing <code>updateExistingSection</code> in the first place, since I had several methods doing the same functionality.</p>

<p>This is obviously part of a stripped down example but what I'm trying to do is come with with classes of length, volume, etc that can compare against other objects of the same class but with different units.</p>

<p><strong>Rhetorical Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If this is a potentially dangerous problem since it makes programs behave in an undetermanistic matter, should compilers warn or error when they detect that you're checking equality of floats</li>
<li>Should compilers support an option to replace all float equality checks with a 'close enough' function?</li>
<li>Do compilers already do this and I just can't find the information.</li>

<p>I have a table with a checkbox at the beginning of each row. I defined a function which reloads the table at regular intervals. It uses jQuery's load() function on a JSP which generates the new table.</p>

<p>The problem is that I need to preserve the checkbox values until the user makes up his mind on which items to select. Currently, their values are lost between updates.</p>

<p>The current code I use that tries to fix it is:</p>

<pre><code> refreshId = setInterval(function()
 {
        var allTicks = new Array();
        $('#myTable input:checked').each(function() {
            allTicks.push($(this).attr('id'));
        });
        $('#myTable').load('/get-table.jsp', null,
                function (responseText,textStatus, req ){
            $('#my-table').tablesorter();
            //alert(allTicks + ' length ' + allTicks.length);
            for (i = 0 ; i &lt; allTicks.length; i++ )
                $(""#my-table input#"" + allTicks[i]).attr('checked', true);

        });
}, $refreshInterval); 
</code></pre>

<p>The id of each checkbox is the same as the table entry next to it.</p>

<p>My idea was to store all the checked checkboxes' ids into an array before the update and to change their values after the update is done, as most of the entries will be preserved, and the ones that are new won't really matter.</p>

<p>'#myTable' is the div in which the table is loaded and '#my-table' is the id of the table which is generated. The checkbox inputs are generated along with the new table and with the same ids as before.</p>

<p>The weird thing is that applying tablesorter to the newly generated table works, but getting the elements with the stored ids doesn't.</p>

<p>Any solutions?</p>

<p>P.S: I know that this approach to table generation isn't really the best, but my JS skills were limited back then. I'd like to keep this solution for now and fix the problem.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Applied the syntax suggested by Didier G. and added some extra test blocks that check the status before and after the checkbox ticking.</p>

<p>Looks like this now:</p>

<pre><code>refreshId = setInterval(function()
    {
        var allTicks = []
        var $myTable = $('#my-table');
        allTicks = $myTable.find('input:checked').map(function() { return this.id; });

        $('#myTable').load('/get-table.jsp', null,
        function (responseText,textStatus, req ){
            $myTable = $('#my-table');
            $('#my-table').tablesorter();
            var msg = 'Before: \n';
            $myTable.find('input').each(function(){
                msg = msg + this.id + "" "" + $(this).prop('checked') + '\n';
            });
            //alert(msg);
            //alert(allTicks + ' length ' + allTicks.length);
            for (i = 0 ; i &lt; allTicks.length; i++ ){
                 $myTable.find('#' + allTicks[i]).prop('checked', true);
            }
            msg = 'After: '
            $myTable.find('input').each(function(){
                msg = msg + this.id + "" "" + $(this).prop('checked') + '\n';
            });
            //alert(msg);
        });
    }, $refreshInterval);
</code></pre>

<p>If I uncomment the alert lines, and check 2 checkboxes, on the next update I get (for 3 row table):</p>

<pre><code>Before: host2 false
host3 false
host4 false

object [Object] length 2

After: host2 false
host3 false
host4 false
</code></pre>

<p>Also did a previous check on the contents of the array and it has all the correct entries.</p>

<p>Can the DOM change or working with an entirely new table instance be a cause of this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong></p>

<p>Here's a sample of the table generated by the JSP (edited for confidentiality purposes):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id=""my-table"" class=""tablesorter""&gt;

        &lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;BSTART&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Dynamic&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

<p>Note that the id and name of the checkbox coincide with the host name. Also note that the first td does not have a checkbox. That's the expected behavior.</p>

<pre><code>String = PString
AnsiString = PAnsiString
Integer = PInteger
Boolean = PBoolean
</code></pre>

<p>So I try to pass the value like this:</p>

<pre><code>var
  S: AnsiString;
begin
  S:= 'New AnsiString Buffer';
  SetBuffer(PAnsiString(S));
end;
</code></pre>

<p>But a cast from AnsiString to PAnsiString does NOT work, I can see why, but I want to know what the result of the casting is. So I wrote a simple test:</p>

<pre><code>var
  Buffer: AnsiString;
  P1: Pointer;
  P2: Pointer;
  P3: Pointer;
  P4: Pointer;
begin
  P1:= PAnsiString(Buffer);
  P2:= Addr(Buffer);
  P3:= @Buffer;
  P4:= Pointer(Buffer);
  P5:= PChar(Buffer[1]);

  WriteLn('P1: ' + IntToStr(Integer(P1)));
  WriteLn('P2: ' + IntToStr(Integer(P2)));
  WriteLn('P3: ' + IntToStr(Integer(P3)));
  WriteLn('P4: ' + IntToStr(Integer(P4)));
  WriteLn('P5: ' + IntToStr(Integer(P5)));
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The result is:</p>

<pre><code>P1: 5006500
P2: 1242488
P3: 1242488
P4: 5006500
P5: 67
</code></pre>

<p>Where:</p>

<pre><code>- P2 and P3, is the address of Buffer: AnsiString 
- P5 is the Char Ord value of Buffer[1] char, in this case ""67 = C""
- How about P1 and P4?
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What is the meaning of P1 and P4?</strong></p>

An app like this must be made using a framework that allow web pages to behave in ways much more akin to iPad's native applications (momentum scrolling, split-view panes, UIKit-style interface), but done completely in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (with WebKit and Safari extensions like iOS-specific multi-touch and gesture events).</p>

<p>The only public framework I've found that targets the iPad in this matter is Sencha Touch. Naturally, Google and Apple aren't sharing the libraries <em>they've</em> written (ie. PastryKit, AdLib, etc). Are there any others (the open-source <em>only</em> license for Sencha Touch is prohibitive, and jQTouch is <em>only</em> for small-screen devices like the iPhone 4, and <em>not</em> the iPad)? How would I go about writing momentum scrolling and split-view panes like this? Any good resources/tutorials/books/links on these advanced topics?</p>

<pre><code>#define MY_LOG(level, component, message, ...) { MyLog::Instance()-&gt;Log(level, component, message, __FILE__, __LINE__, ##__VA_ARGS__); }
</code></pre>

<p>The const char* message parameter is using a printf like format, like ""<em>My name is %s and I am %u.</em>""</p>

<p>The actual logging method I am using is that I declaring a <em>char buffer[2048]</em> variable on the stack and I am using vsnprintf to convert my va_list param, as defined in my message parameter, into my buffer. However, as I am often handling values that can be quite bigger than 2k, my buffer is always truncated so I thought about reworking the whole thing around stringstream which would be more flexible.</p>

<p>When implementing this solution, I encountered a problem with retrieving my va_args parameters from my list to use with the &lt;&lt; operator... Is my only solution available is to parse the whole message parameter for % values and retrieve them by using va_arg with the type retrieved? I also need to push the text between my % values, so vsnprintf was really handy, as now I would need to split strings on % to push the previous text into my stringstream... Any hint or idea to help me out with this issue?</p>

<p>I can't use external libs for this and as I support platforms and compilers that may or may not support C++11, I can't entirely rely on new language features, but adding define to support both implementation is feasible. Also, as tons of traces are already in the current codebase, I can't really change the message format.</p>

<p>i have a web form which contains a username check using jquery script and a php script. it was working fine when i first wrote the code and now has completely stopped working(no idea why). The php script is a pretty standard mysqli query which returns the numrows and then i either echo 1 or 0 to the page depending on if a result was found. this script works fine and have tested it independently and echos 1 if no result was found and 0 if a result was found. </p>

<p>in the jquery script i have a min value check and a no value check which both work fine. Then my ajax call and i receive the result with success:function(data). this also has been tested independently by printing the result(data) on screen and prints a 1 on screen when there is no record and a 0 on screen when a record if found so i know everything is working fine with the sent data and im getting the results back i expect. </p>

<p>so my only thing left is there must be a problem with my if statement and how it is dealing with the returned data as it always skips to the else even when the condition is met. The only way for the if statement to work is when i set the variable myself and run the script. The long story short is everything works fine except for the final if statement where it always jumps to the else no matter what and says the username is available even when i know its not.</p>

<p>Im testing on xampp. Could this be an issue too?</p>

<p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance!!!</p>

Is it ok I pass an entire class to method? Answers quite rightly state reasons of encapsulation, immutability etc.</p>

<p>However, I have a slightly different question. Is it any different when you're passing params to a user control?</p>

<p>Take the scenario; I have a supplier widget - it contains lots of information about a supplier, but not all. In fact given that I use an ORM like Entity Framework, the data can span entire tables too .</p>

<p>So do I pass every piece of data individually, create another class encasulating all the params I require, or just pass in a ""supplier"" entity and pick off the bits that I need?</p>

<p>Then there is the possibility of nested user controls, or subtle variations in controls, which mean even more parameter passing.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The fragments in this code are also in MainActivity.java and they work. However, what I want to do is link a fragment.java file for each of these cases instead of the inline fragments listed here. The reason for this is that the fragment.java file will contain an Expandable ListView with Checkbox. Therefore, what is the best way to achieve this? Is there a line of code that will allow me load a fragment.java file?</p>

I'm trying to do an Excel Document Customization with a separate Windows Form in it (.show on load).  I can get the form to open on loading the doc.  I found lots of examples of how to put Windows Form Controls in the document on MSDN (and figured out how to do that), but I'm having trouble referencing parts of the Excel document from the Windows Form.</p>

<p>So for example on the windows form called Main Control I tried to add this sub to a button:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click

    Try
        Dim baba As Sheet1
        baba.Cells(1, 2).Value = ""Llaslmasd""
    Catch ex As Exception
        MsgBox(ex.Message)
    End Try
 End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried:</p>

<pre><code>        Dim baba As New Sheet1
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>        Dim baba As WorkSheet
        baba = Sheet1
</code></pre>

<p>What is the correct way to reference the sheet if it is not a shared member, or if I should make it shared, how do I do that?</p>

<p>Will things break if I programatically try to insert sheets from other (non-incorporated workbooks and therefore change sheet index?).</p>

I tried using intents with startActivityForResult(), but I faced two problems: First, with launchMode singleTop, the app is initialized again on every invocation. Because the calling apps will invoke my app a lot and the initialization takes some time because of authentication, this is not an option. So I tried launchmode singleTask. But I found out that startActivityForResult() will not return results to another task. </p>

<p>So now the question: How can an app invoke an already initialized activity in another app, get back a result, and keep the invoked activity initialized.
For example: A invokes B. Do some stuff in B. Focus and results return to A. B stays initialized, so it can later be invoked by A again.</p>

<p>After reading lots of documentation I came up with the following possible solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A invokes B. B invokes A again with a result in the intent extra. (Somehow state of A should be saved)</li>
<li>A invokes B. B sends a broadcast to A. Focus returns to A and A receives result in a BroadcastReceiver.</li>
<li>A invokes B. result of B is stored in a content provider in B. Focus returns to A. A requests result from content provider in B.</li>
<li>Or using launchmode singleTop and startActivityForResult() and in some way save state of B after the result is sent back to A?</li>
</ul>

<p>Which solution is best/will work? Or are there any other/better solutions?</p>

<p>My case is that I have a parent directory with a ton of subdirectories that I want to search on to see if they contain a directory of a certain string. Since it's so big I make sure to limit my depth to two to avoid unnecessary searching. The first command is something like this:</p>

<p>This will typically return something on the order of 30 matches. What I'd like to do then is list the contents of one of its subdirectories called logs. I thought maybe doing something like </p>

<p>might do the trick but it just returns the immediate contents of the directory. What I want is to list the contents of <code>MWACluster15/logs/</code></p>
