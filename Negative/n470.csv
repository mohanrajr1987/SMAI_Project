I currently have a rather bulky script running for a simulator. For some javaScripting reasons I cannot make the menu using JavaScript without detracting from the simulation so I had planned to use HTML to make a menu swipe from the side of the screen. As I was working on that I stumbled on the above link; however when I run the program using the background method it runs much slower. Is there any reason for this, and is there any solution?</p>

<p>Here are the relevant portions of code:</p>

<p>HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Curtain Sim 2013 &lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link href=""global.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""&gt;

        &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""savDat.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;div id = ""canvas"" style=""width:100%; height:100%; background: -webkit-canvas(curSim2013); ""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;!--&lt;body&gt;
        &lt;canvas id=""curSim2013""&gt;
            Your Browser does not support HTML5     &lt;/canvas&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Javascript from main.js which runs it (there are some artifacts commented out from my experimenting)</p>

<pre><code>function init()
{
    //Grab the Canvas tag from index.html
    canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
    //Create an interface for interacting with canvas in 2D
    //context = canvas.getContext('2d');
    //var ctx = document.getCSSCanvasContext(""2d"", ""squares"", w, h);

    //Set the dimensions of the canvas to match the broser window
    //Note that global.css helps make this possible
    canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
    canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

    context = document.getCSSCanvasContext(""2d"", ""curSim2013"", canvas.width, canvas.height);
    //Erase the contents of the canvas
    context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

            . . .

<p>CSS (nothing much)</p>

<p>Log4j (1.2) and SoapUI (4.5.1) uses plain settings in pom. The logger is created as
<code>protected final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());</code></p>

Only other solution I can think of is having a list with the chars I want to remove and iterating through the string replacing them.</p>

<p>What is the correct Pythonic solution here?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,
I've to develop ASP.NET MVC page to let user add information about a company and its addresses. It's one to many relationship. I'm using Kendo UI data-template option. </p>

<p>I've HTML containing  stuff. On binding first row is shown. Now my problem is that I've to implement Add button functionality to let users add another row of Address e.g. Billing Address, Mailing address etc. Please refer how the row is supposed to look like. On clicking add, I need to create another empty row.
I've not been able to find any example on Kendo or other forums to show that. </p>

<p>Original Image:</p>

<li>We know the width, height</li>
<li>We know the (x,y) coordinates of all three markers.</li>

<p>Transformed Image:</p>

<p>I've been told on stack overflow that the order of applying transformations does not matter but my observation is different. Below is some code that generates an original image and attempts to draw it on a new canvas after introducing some transformations. You can change the order of the transformations to see different results.</p>

have seen examples of code that splits the image into chunks and sends them out, but I can't get them to work maybe because I'm using a different vb version. The pictures to be sent are small 20k max.</p>

<p>Any working code examples would be wonderful. I have been experimenting and failing with this final hurdle for weeks.</p>

<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

<p>After some research and trial and error, here's what I did:</p>

<p>went to <a href=""http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/d/Downloadderbyclientjar.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/d/Downloadderbyclientjar.htm</a> and downloaded derbyclient.jar and saved it, and unzipped it to a shared folder.</p>

<p>edited the text file C:\Users\tyler.davis\AppData\Roaming\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2014a\javaclasspath.txt and added full path to derbyclient.jar, saved it, restarted MATLAB.</p>

<p>At MATLAB command line </p>

<pre><code>javaclasspath
</code></pre>

<p>shows ""S:\SHARED...\derbyclientjar\derbyclient.jar\derbyclient.jar"" at the end of the static path list.  So far so good.</p>

<p>Next, try</p>

<pre><code>driverClassName = 'org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver';
java.lang.Class.forName(driverClassName);
</code></pre>

<p>reports error:</p>

<pre><code>Java exception occurred:
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org/apache/derby/jdbc/ClientDriver

at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)

at java.lang.Class.forName(Unknown Source)
</code></pre>

<p>Tried an alternative:</p>

<pre><code>classLoader = com.mathworks.jmi.ClassLoaderManager.getClassLoaderManager;
driverClass = classLoader.loadClass(driverClassName);
</code></pre>

<p>That seemed to work, created objects ""driverClass, type 1x1 java.lang.Class"" and ""classLoader, value 1x1 com.mathworks.jmi.ClassLoaderManager""</p>

<p>Then I tried</p>

<pre><code>DriverManager.registerDriver(driverClass.newInstance);
</code></pre>

<p>which reports error</p>

<pre><code>Undefined variable ""DriverManager"" or class ""DriverManager.registerDriver"".
</code></pre>

<p>and if I try to create a sample database using</p>

<pre><code>cxnStr = 'jdbc:derby:sampleDB:create=true';
cxn = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(cxnStr);
</code></pre>

<p>I get </p>

<p>I wrote a simple util that periodically reads log files and saves the entries to a database. Not much code and seemingly works fine. But after running it on a big lump of logs today I found that it was not production ready ...  After the first job was finished chewing through all of the logs, the next 15 jobs would fire off, until no more connections could be established and the next job would fail with a SqlException. For the next five hours the app spewed out exceptions unnoticed until running out of memory.</p>

<p>The job was set up using the following cron trigger, ""* */2 * * * ?"", which means ""run every two minutes"". The weird thing is that after the first job was finished (which took approx. an hour) the remaining jobs would fire rapidly, one after another. This was unexpected, as I would think there had to be two minutes between each job. </p>

<p>Now I wonder what could be wrong. I am guessing the reason is either in how I am using Hibernate and/or Quartz. Maybe I am not releasing the session as I should, or have misunderstood how Quartz schedules jobs?Or maybe I should inject the Hibernate factory into to the job, and not create it in each job? getCurrentSession() vs openSession()? No idea. I still do not understand why this should have any effect, as the jobs should release all resources on exit. Anyway, most of the relevant code is to be seen below. </p>

<p>No matter if I get the connection problem sorted, the code is suffering from some sort of memory leak. It is as if every job executed is somehow kept on the heap. By executing</p>

<p><code>java -Xmx17M -DcronTriggerExpression=""*/1 * * * * ?"" -jar myjar.jar</code>,</p>

<p>I can force the problem to appear by running the program with a minimal amount of memory. It just takes four consecutive runs in this case before I get a OutOfMemoryError when building the session factory for hibernate.</p>

<pre><code>public class ExportJob implements Job {
    LogImporter importer;

    public ExportJob() { //needed for Quartz 
        setUpHibernate(); 
        importer = new LogImporter(); //injected, but this saves space on SO :)
    }

    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context) throws JobExecutionException {
        /* even if this body is empty, I get a OutOfMemoryError */        
    }

    private SessionFactory setUpHibernate() {
        logger.debug(""Setting up hibernate"");
        this.sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
        return this.sessionFactory;
    }

<ul>
<li>that where am I supposed to put the form tag - in the main landing page template html (home.html) or in the modal window template html (createNewRI.html) ? And how do I handle the form in the modal window ?</li>

<p>When I open an HTML file in GoodReader on an iPad, single touches will toggle the GoodReader menu on and off. This behavior should be tied to three-finger taps, not single touches, per their documentation, and according to them is a known issue. 
I was wondering if anyone has been able to suppress this behavior, perhaps using parent.document.getElementsByTagName to identify possible elements and then target them with JS. </p>

<li><p>If you'd like to reproduce this, here's my suggestion: Compile the program, let it marinate for a day or two. :) When you've used the computer for a while, try running the program a couple of times... when I try that, I <em>usually</em> get an error, until I recompile the program afresh.</p></li>

<h2>Edit 2:</h2>

<p>For some reason, whenever you want to <em>show</em> people a problem, it magically gets solved. Ditto the case here. I'll keep on trying to reproduce the error, but at the moment, it seems to be working fine. :\ (I have a suspicion that it might be because of installing Windows 7 SP1, but I really doubt it... if I find out I'll post here.)</p>

<p>Sorry about this everyone...</p>

<h3>Edit 3:</h3>

<p>Okay... as it happens, whenever you need to reproduce a bug, you can't. :|</p>

<p>However, at least I found something else: it seems that the <em>correct</em> window to send the message to is the window returned by <code>GetShellWindow()</code>. Hopefully that'll be useful for someone else.</p>

<p>If I do <code>t.Start()</code>, like the above, it never reaches <code>MyExceptionHandler</code>, and just throws an unhandled exception in <code>DoWork</code>. If I instead call <code>t2.Start()</code>, <code>DoWork</code> is never called. How should I do it then?</p>

Before I forget, many thanks to JD Long and Josh Ulrich for much of the core of this.  I'm going to use this in a course next semester.  Sorry this is long!</p>

<p>UPDATE: I found a different approach which almost works (please fix it if you can!).  I posted it at the bottom.  A much smarter and shorter approach than I was able to come up with!</p>

<p>I basically followed the previous schemes up to a point: Generate random data, figure out the line of best fit, draw the residuals.  This is shown in the second code chunk below.  But I also dug around and wrote some functions to draw lines normal to a line through a random point (the data points in this case).  I think these work fine, and they are shown in First Code Chunk along with proof they work.</p>

<p>Now, the Second Code Chunk shows the whole thing in action using the same flow as @JDLong and I'm adding an image of the resulting plot.  Data in black, red is the regression with residuals pink, blue is the 1st PC and the light blue should be the normals, but obviously they are not.  The functions in First Code Chunk that draw these normals seem fine, but something is not right with the demonstration: I think I must be misunderstanding something or passing the wrong values.  My normals come in horizontal, which seems like a useful clue (but so far, not to me).  Can anyone see what's wrong here?</p>

<p>Thanks, this has been vexing me for a while...

############  UPDATE

<p>Over at <a href=""http://zoonek2.free.fr/UNIX/48_R/09.html#7"" rel=""nofollow"">Vincent Zoonekynd's Page</a> I found almost exactly what I wanted.  But, it doesn't quite work (obviously used to work).  Here is a code excerpt from that site which plots normals to the first PC reflected through a vertical axis:</p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1)
x &lt;- rnorm(20)
y &lt;- x + rnorm(20)
plot(y~x, asp = 1)
r &lt;- lm(y~x)
abline(r, col='red')

r &lt;- princomp(cbind(x,y))
b &lt;- r$loadings[2,1] / r$loadings[1,1]
a &lt;- r$center[2] - b * r$center[1]
abline(a, b, col = ""blue"")
title(main='Appears to use the reflection of PC1')

u &lt;- r$loadings
# Projection onto the first axis
p &lt;- matrix( c(1,0,0,0), nrow=2 )
X &lt;- rbind(x,y)
X &lt;- r$center + solve(u, p %*% u %*% (X - r$center))
segments( x, y, X[1,], X[2,] , col = ""lightblue1"")
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the result:</p>

<p>So, there are two parts to the background image, the top part which has a unique horizontal and vertical design (its about 1024x700) then a bottom section that has a unique style horizontally, but can be repeated vertically . (1024 x 1) </p>

<p>Right now I have the top section being a background image for the header, the problem is that it screws me up for styling all of the page content because it is so big! </p>

<p>Everything was fine until I tried to eliminate recursion I found in a <code>print_r</code> of the final <code>$this</code></p>

<p>Now every class extends from another. Only the components and app class extend from the main class. The section extends from the app class. Which at this point seems fine except for one problem:</p>

<p>When I call a top level function from within an inherited class, the function unsets an important class from the top level parent.</p>

<pre><code>class Framework
{
    protected $Data;

    function __construct()
    {
        // include all files...

        $this-&gt;Data = new MySQLClass;
    }

    function getItem( $item )
    {
        $this-&gt;Data-&gt;table = 'items';
        $this-&gt;Data-&gt;data = array( 'id' =&gt; $item );

        $this-&gt;Data-&gt;Query();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the component class (inherits from main) a call is made to <code>$this-&gt;getItem()</code></p>

<p>It now returns</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fatal error: Call to undefined method stdClass::Query()</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did a <code>print_r</code> of <code>$this-&gt;Data</code> at the beginning and end of <code>getItem()</code> and sure enough the lines that define the class action (<code>Data-&gt;table</code>, <code>Data-&gt;data</code>) are redefining <code>$this-&gt;Data</code></p>

<p><strong>First print_r</strong> (normal at this point)</p>

<pre><code>MySQLClass Object ( ... )
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second print_r</strong> (changed to values set in function)</p>

<pre><code>stdClass Object
(
    [table] =&gt; items
    [data] =&gt; Array
        (
            [id] =&gt; 1
        )
)
</code></pre>

<p>This function works as intended when called from the main class, and has always worked as intended before the classes were extended. I'm thinking of just holding down CTRL + Z and forgetting I ever noticed. Don't fix what ain't broke right? Still I would like to know exactly why this is happening and how to properly call top level functions from child classes.</p>

<p>I know this example doesn't actually need the INSTEAD OF trigger. Without the trigger, it works fine, but my actual use case is selecting from and updating multiple tables.</p>

<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DBw97.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Each view can be accessed as the initial view controller also know as <code>pageViewController.currentPage</code>. Each of these 4 views contains a <code>UIWebView</code> that loads it's HTML content in the init method. The <code>UIWebViews</code> are all the width of their view, 320. I just need them to match the height of the given content, so that I can scroll all the way down through the content. This actually works perfectly for the initial <code>viewController</code>. I sized the <code>webView</code> in the <code>webViewDidLoad</code> method like so:</p>

<pre><code>self.scrollView.clipsToBounds = NO;
aWebView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin;
//NSLog(@""THIS IS WEBVIEWDIDFINISHLOAD IN ACTION"");
CGRect screenRect = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds];
CGFloat screenWidth = screenRect.size.width;

CGRect frame = aWebView.frame;
frame.size.height = 1;
aWebView.frame = frame;
CGSize fittingSize = [aWebView sizeThatFits:CGSizeZero];
frame.size = fittingSize;
aWebView.frame = frame;
scrollViewHeight = scrollViewHeight - self.articleTitleLabel.frame.size.height;
[self.scrollView setContentSize:(CGSizeMake(screenWidth, scrollViewHeight))];

CGSize fullContentSize = CGSizeMake(screenWidth, scrollViewHeight);
[self.scrollView setContentSize:fullContentSize];

self.scrollView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,screenWidth, scrollViewHeight)];

aWebView.scrollView.scrollEnabled= NO;
</code></pre>

<p>THE PROBLEM is that when you swipe to another <code>viewController</code>, that <code>UIWebView</code> is not the adequate height, and the web content is cutoff, and the <code>UIScrollview</code> is the height of the screen.</p>

<p>***EXCEPTION: This is really weird, but it may help someone to answer the question: If you swipe horizontally as soon as the initial ViewController appear and go to the other views, their webViews will load perfectly with the correct height. The problem still remains that if you load up a <code>ViewController</code>, and take your time to read the content on that page, then swipe to another <code>viewController</code>, the <code>webVIew</code> will be cut off.</p>

<p>Of course, if I pass the structure by reference instead, the function works correctly on both 32-bit and 64-bit runtimes:</p>

I create a Raphael canvas in a div. This happens as soon as the page is loaded and the initRadar() function is called: </p>

<pre><code>var r;
var paper;
var c;
function initRadar(){
    r = $( ""#circ"" );
    paper = Raphael(""circ"", r.width(), r.height());
    c = paper.circle(r.width()/2, r.height()/2, r.height()/2-2);
    $(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){

        setTimeout(function(){ redraw(); }, 300); // &lt;--- *yuck*
    }); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This functions perfectly so far. My problem starts when the orientation of the viewport changes. I thought I could add an event handle to the window, which fires, when the orientation changes and redraw the content. And it works... kind of. I wanted to call the second function:</p>

<pre><code>function redraw(){
    c.remove();
    c = paper.circle(r.width()/2, r.height()/2, r.height()/2-2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever the orientation changes, this function redraws the content. And this also works... almost. The problem is, I have a race condition. Even though the orientation change event fired, the #circ div still has the old size and position. This leads to the strange effect, that when the viewport is in portrait mode, the landscape circle is drawn and vice versa. </p>

<p>My current solution is to use the timeout function (<em>yuck</em>), to wait a few ms so that the layout is done before I draw the circle. It works, but it is ugly and I don't want to have such a hack in my code. </p>

<p>Can someone point me in the direction how to solve this problem correctly?</p>

<p>When I try to run the program, I get a segmentation fault on the print loop in the bottom. I think it is caused by some problem with allocating memory, but I can't figure out why.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong>
I have changed the code to use a 3 dimensional array to store the text segments, but I still get a segmentation fault when i try to allocate memory using malloc.</p>

<pre><code>localText-&gt;list[i][n] = malloc(100 * sizeof(char));
</code></pre>

<p>her is the changed code.</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
   char name[100];
   char  ***list;
}text;

int main(){
   int i = 0, n, z,wordCount, sections;
   FILE *file;
   text *localText;

   openFile(&amp;file, ""test.txt"");
   wordCount = countWords(file);


   sections = (wordCount / 50) + 1;

   localText = malloc(sizeof(text));
   localText-&gt;list = malloc(sections * sizeof(char **));

   for(i = 0; i &lt; sections; i++)
      localText-&gt;list[i] = malloc(50 * sizeof(char *));
      for(n = 0; n &lt; 50; n++)
         localText-&gt;list[i][n] = malloc(100 * sizeof(char));

   readFileContent(file, localText-&gt;list, 50);

   freeText(localText);

   return 1;

Each transaction's amount is a signed integer, I balance the account using <code>SUM()</code> and have a function that should output each entry with a running balance, ordered by the row's <code>id</code> and <code>date</code> in descending order.</p>

<p>Everything appeared to be working fine until the account balance went below 0 (-6.20 or so). When a deposit was entered, instead of simply returning to a positive number, the running total output 1.00 and the running total of nearly every transaction prior to it read as a negative - except for perhaps the ones that were either near or below $0. Quite puzzled.. here is the function (part of a class):</p>

<pre><code>public function fetchTransactions($limit = null) {
        global $db;
        $this-&gt;balanceAccount(); //Calls upon another function to return the balance
        $runningTotal = $this-&gt;accountBalance;
        $prevAmount = 0;
        if (isset($limit)) {
            $sql = ""SELECT amount, payee, cat, date FROM transactions ORDER BY date DESC, id DESC LIMIT $limit"";
        } else {
            $sql = ""SELECT amount, payee, cat, date FROM transactions ORDER BY date DESC, id DESC"";
        }
        $fetchTransactionsSQL = $db-&gt;query($sql);
        while ($transactionDetails = $fetchTransactionsSQL-&gt;fetch()) {
            $date = date(""m/d"", strtotime($transactionDetails['date']));
            $payee = stripslashes($transactionDetails['payee']);
            $category = $transactionDetails['cat'];
            $amount = $transactionDetails['amount'];
            $runningTotal -= $prevAmount; //I have also tried addition here
            $prevAmount = $amount;
            $amountOutput = (strpos($amount, '-') === true ? '-' . money_format(""%n"", $amount) : money_format(""%n"", $amount));
            $runningTotalOutput = money_format(""%n"", $runningTotal);
            echo ""

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT = Further explanation</strong></p>

<p>To clear up some confusion. The entries are being pulled from the database in descending order, where the last transaction is at the end of the MySQL table but the first one displayed on the page. I start <code>$prevAmount</code> at 0 and then set it to the current transaction's amount during the loop. <code>$runningTotal</code> starts as the overall account balance and the running balance is obtained by subtracting the previous transaction's amount (<code>$prevAmount</code>) from <code>$runningTotal</code> during the loop. If anyone can suggest an easier way to accomplish this I'm all ears -- it worked great until the account balance fell below 0.</p>

<p>You can't get <a href=""http://imgur.com/IHuJYoY"" rel=""nofollow"">the same result</a> with:</p>

<pre><code>a = peaks(100);
x=0:99;
y=1:100;
[X,Y]=meshgrid(x,y);
contourf(X,Y,a);
set(gca,'XScale','log');
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is due to the very tailed distribution in my data and the linear split with colorbar.
Any idea to keep x starting at 0 ? Have a logscale colorbar ? (I try to replace it by eps but still not very nice).
Thanks</p>

<p>PS: I can't put another link here is my data: www.filedropper.com/dd_3</p>

The design is :</p>

<ul>
<li>WCF Service Layer</li>
<li>Business Logic Layer</li>
<li>Data Access Layer (LINQ-To-Entities)</li>
</ul>

<p>I need to have a worker thread that does some continuous work on the database (looks for new records, and if finds any - sends information to the client in a 'Push' manner, meaning - the client will be hosting a service so it can receive 'push' notifications from this worker thread).</p>

<p>I will host the WCF service on a windows service.</p>

<p>Question is : Where do I fit this worker thread in my design ?
Should it be spawned in the 'Main()' of the Windows Service's 'Program.cs' along-side the WCF service ? (and this means it should be part of the WCF Service assembly)
Or should it be part of the Business Logic layer - and thus part of the 'Business Logic' assembly ?</p>

<p>But I have two issues:</p>

<p>1 - When I edit the CSS properties in the ""Elements tab"" the link to .scss breaks up and DevTools shows link to the compiled .css file.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5U6jl.png"" alt="".scss link broken""></p>

<p>2 - When I ctrl-click on the CSS property in the ""Elements"" tab, the ""Sources"" tab opens successfully to show the corresponding .scss file. When I change the file inside the DevTools and try to save it - DevTools says that the file is saved, but it doesn't actually get saved on disk (seems like it gets saved somwhere else). So the sass watch doesn't update the .css because the .scss file doesn't actually get saved on disk.</p>

<p>In my project I have for mysql my class so I don't type it like this, but this way it works.</p>

<p>When after first query error happen, error log is saved end script is ended. But inserted data stay in DB. I though, when <code>COMMIT</code> isn't executed and connection is closed, automatically <code>ROLLBACK</code> happen.</p>

<p>P.S. I know, that using mysqli should be better, but this is the same for <strong>mysql_</strong> and <strong>mysqli_</strong>, isn't it?</p>

<pre><code>import Control.Monad.ST

zeroElementsAfterDecrement' :: (MArray a e m, Num e, Eq e) =&gt; a Int e -&gt; [Int] -&gt; m [Int]
zeroElementsAfterDecrement' arr is = foldr k (return []) is
  where k i a = do xs &lt;- a

                   unsafeWrite arr i decremented

                  zeroElementsAfterDecrement' arr [1..largenum]


main = (putStrLn . show) test
</code></pre>

<p>The function takes an array (I use unboxed mutable arrays) and a list of indexes, decrements elements by these indexes and returns indexes of elements that became zero during this operation. Right now this is more than 10 times slower than the optimized C++ code but still pretty good compared to Python (or maybe I don't know Python way to optimize this). I understand there is an overhead from executing a monadic code, but maybe there are still ways to optimize I am not aware of?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>GHC: -O -fllvm: 0.54s<br>
GHC (with unsafeWrite/unsafeRead and Word32): 0.34s<br>
g++: 0.24s<br>
g++ -O2: 0.05s<br>
python3: 2.66s<br></p>

<p>Also when I change foldr to foldl' it starts allocating some memory and is 4 times slower as a result, why is that?</p>

<p>Here is a C++ version I compared it to:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
using namespace std;
#define LARGENUM 10000000

int main()
{
    vector &lt;int&gt; arr; 
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; LARGENUM; i++) {
        arr.push_back(100);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.size(); i++) {
        arr[i]--;
        if (arr[i] == 0)
            cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    return 0; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a Python version:</p>

<pre><code>arr = [100] * 10000000

for x in range (0, 10000000 - 1):
    arr[x] = arr[x] - 1
    if arr[x] == 0:
        print x

<p>The trouble is that the Handler runs perfectly when I compile it and run from my browser once. But when I send concurrent requests to it using ab, about half the requests get dropped. Not only that, but its way too slow compared to a similar script I've written in node.js - I've tested it both on IIS-7/Windows and Mono/Linux environments. Do you suggest ASP.NET is inherently slower compared to node.js to handle heavy async I/O load?</p>

<p>My problem is quite simple. If you use the follwing code it will hang. This is well documented in the subprocess module doc.</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess

proc = subprocess.Popen(['cat','-'],
                        stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                        )
for i in range(100000):
    proc.stdin.write('%d\n' % i)
output = proc.communicate()[0]
print output
</code></pre>

<p>Searching for a solution (there is a very insightful thread, but I've lost it now) I found this solution (among others) that uses an explicit fork:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import sys
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def produce(to_sed):
    for i in range(100000):
        to_sed.write(""%d\n"" % i)
        to_sed.flush()
    #this would happen implicitly, anyway, but is here for the example
    to_sed.close()

def consume(from_sed):
    while 1:
        res = from_sed.readline()
        if not res:
            sys.exit(0)
            #sys.exit(proc.poll())
        print 'received: ', [res]

def main():
    proc = Popen(['cat','-'],stdin=PIPE,stdout=PIPE)
    to_sed = proc.stdin
    from_sed = proc.stdout

    pid = os.fork()
    if pid == 0 :
        from_sed.close()
        produce(to_sed)
        return
    else :
        to_sed.close()
        consume(from_sed)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>While this solution is conceptually very easy to understand, it uses one more process and stuck as too low level compared to the subprocess module (that is there just to hide this kind of things...).</p>

<p>I'm wondering: is there a simple and clean solution using the subprocess module that won't hung or to implement this patter I have to do a step back and implement an old-style select loop  or an explicit fork?</p>

To be honest, some applications annoy me because I want them to open on my primary monitor and I'll move them to my secondary if I want them there. However, these applications are done and out of my control, so I want to ask about my own applications that might be run by people using two monitors.</p>

<p>What kinds of controls are available to either allow people to specify which monitor your application opens on, allow an application to ""remember"" the monitor it was on when it was closed and reopen there, and to force the application to start on a specific monitor?</p>

<p>I'm looking for solutions across all operating systems and programming languages, although I'm guessing that different OSes and languages will have different controls.</p>

Each of these elements themselves have the same text field inputs from which they can fetch more elements which will be nested. Think of it as a sort of a graph traversal.</p>

<p>Imagine I have a GET button that fetches these results. Since it's all dynamic, all of the divs belong to the class accordion. So, when I retrieve results from an inner nested accordion, I have no choice but to call the onPageLoad function which applies the accordion styling on ALL of my elements. This results in my topmost element collapsing. Imagine you're in the four nested level of a query. You press GET and the entire thing collapses. You have to open each accordion element from the parent again to get to the fourth level. </p>

<p>First of all, I want to install <strong>memcached</strong>, not memcache.</p>

<p>I'm trying to set up memcached to work with my lampp server on ubuntu 12.10 since yesterday. I've already followed almost every tutorial I could find. The most recent thing, I tried to do was:</p>

<p>in terminal</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install libmemcached-dev 
cd /opt/lampp
./bin/pecl install memcached
</code></pre>

<p>and then adding extension=""memcached.so"" in php.ini file. After this I restarted lampp using <code>/opt/lampp/lampp restart</code></p>

<p>When I tried to open php script in my browser it just got downloaded. Running <code>tail -20 /opt/lampp/logs/php_error_log</code>this is what I see:</p>

<pre><code>PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/memcached.so' - /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/memcached.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64 in Unknown on line 0
</code></pre>

<p>It seems <a href=""http://montenasoft.com/en/blog/how-install-pecl-php-extension-64bit-linux-while-you-are-using-32bit-xampp"" rel=""nofollow"">this guy</a> had same problem but with different extension. When I try to compile 32 bit version of the extension using:</p>

<pre><code>phpize
CFLAGS=-m32 CPPFLAGS=-m32 CCASFLAGS=-m32 ./configure
make
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>make</code> throws the following error:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/local/lib/libmemcached.so when searching for -lmemcached
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmemcached
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lz
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [memcached.la] Error 1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem is that I don't even know if I'm on the right path</strong>. If someone could write short step-by-step guide how to get this working or just show me where the issue is it would be great.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>After executing <code>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 sudo apg-get update sudo apt-get install libmemcached-dev:i386 libz-dev:i386</code> and <code>phpize CFLAGS=-m32 CPPFLAGS=-m32 CCASFLAGS=-m32 ./configure make</code> memcached compiles fine. It still doesn't work however. After checking php error logs again I get this</p>

  - HTML files<br>

These widgets will consist of twitter feeds, flickr feeds, other rss feeds, etc...There will also be an administration area where admins can add/manage what widgets are available for users to add. Also, each app needs it's own custom set of options that the user will be required to enter when adding that widget (e.g for twitter, a twitter username is required).</p>

<p>For days I've been trying to figure out how the logic behind this should work. At first My thought was to dynamically build the widget on the fly and store all widgets / widget configuration information in database tables like:</p>

<pre><code>Widgets
   - name
   - description
   - feed_url

Widgets Settings
   - widget_id
   - name 
   - field type (text, textarea, etc...)
   - required

User Widgets
   - user_id
   - widget_id

User Widget Settings
   - user_id
   - widget_id
   - widget_setting_id
   - value
</code></pre>

<p>So, basically the admins would add widgets to the Module table (e.g Twitter) Then add configuration fields for that module in the Widget Settings table (twitter_username). But how to associate the config options to the widget when constructing them is where I'm having issues.</p>

<p>Another option would be to hardcode everything and stick it in the lib/ directory. But that would kill all flexibility / dynamic functionality.</p>

<p>Does any of this sound like it could work?</p>

<p>Any advice would be very much appreciated!</p>

<p>I'm finally that far that I can start my testing, but I'm not sure if I'm doing things right, since the addresses are of addresses within lists of structs containing structs. And in C are calculated using macros.</p>

<p>I think I did it correctly, but I'm uncertain about if I set the argtypes correctly. And thus would like your opinion.</p>

<p>Note: the target-function under test has the following foot-print:</p>

<pre><code>void function( ulong startAddress, ulong endAddress, ulong curAddress, int nofPaddingElements )
</code></pre>

<p>Note2: I have to test this against real hardware, therefore I did not implement to many shortcuts at this moment.</p>

<p>I'm not allowed to post real code here, so I will give pseudo code as far as possible.</p>

<p>1) the type-definition of the buffer-struct. Contains pointers to other structs, but not as pointer, but as ulongs.</p>

<pre><code>class My_Buffer_t( ctypes.Structure ):
    _fields_ = [
       ( ""some_bool"" , ctypes.c_bool ),
       ( ""head"",       ctypes.c_ulong ),
       ( ""tail"",       ctypes.c_ulong ),
       ( ""headSize"",   ctypes.c_ulong ),
       ( ""dataSize"",   ctypes.c_ulong ) ]
</code></pre>

<p>Main data-struct, exists out of 2 other structs</p>

<pre><code>class Struct1( ctypes.Structure ):
    _fields_ = [
       ( ""entry1"", Struct2 ),
       ( ""entry2"", Struct3 ) ]

class Struct2( ctypes.Structure ):
# Only contains basic types
    _fields_ = [
       ( ""data1"", ctypes.c_int ),
       ...
       ( ""datax"", cyptes.c_ushort ) ]

class Struct3( ctypes.Structure ):
# Mix of basic types and 1 other structure
    _fields_ = [
       ( ""data1"", ctypes.c_double ),
       ...
       ( ""datax"", cyptes.c_int ),

       ( ""timestamp_data1"", TimeStampStruct ),
       ...
       ( ""timestamp_datax"", TimeStampStruct ) ]

class TimeStampStruct( ctypes.Structure ):
    _fields_ = [
       ( ""field1"", ctypes.c_ulong ),
       ( ""field2"", ctypes.c_ulong ) ]
</code></pre>

<p>List creation-function (I basically copied the C-function):</p>

<pre><code>def create_list( bufsize, buffer ):
    # buffer is of type My_Buffer_t

    # It actually creates some shared memory where headSize also needed to be divided by 
    # ctypes.sizeof( ctypes.c_size_t )
    # And afterwards again was multiplied by ctypes.sizeof( ctypes.c_size_t )
    # But since the shared-memory is not of importance for the function-under test I left
    # that part out.
    headSize = (ctypes.c_size_t )( ( ctypes.sizeof(
            My_Buffer_t ) + ctypes.sizeof( ctypes.c_size_t ) - 1 ) )
    dataSize = ( ctypes.c_size_t ) ( ( bufsize + ctypes.sizeof(
            ctypes.c_size_t ) - 1 ) / ctypes.sizeof( ctypes.c_size_t ) )

    buffer.some_bool = True
    buffer.head      = 0
    buffer.tail      = 0
    buffer.headSize  = (ctypes.c_ulong)(headSize)
    buffer.dataSize  = (ctypes.c_ulong)(dataSize)

    return buffer
</code></pre>

<p>The macro I translated to python function (again I kept as close as possible to the C-code)</p>

<pre><code>def get_data_address( list_ptr ):
    # list_ptr is of type My_buffer_t, but the data is of type Struct1
    return( ( ctypes.c_ulong )( ctypes.c_void_p )( ctypes.c_byte )(
            list_ptr ) + ( list_ptr.headSize ) )
</code></pre>

<p>How it all comes together</p>

<pre><code>max_entries = 100000
list_size   = max_entries * ctypes.sizeof( Struct1 )

# First argtype use:
create_list.argtypes = ( ctypes.c_ulong, My_Buffer_t )
list_ptr             = create_list( list_size, My_Buffer_t() )

# Determine the addresses (2nd use of argtypes):
get_data_address.argtypes = ( My_Buffer_t )
startAddress              = get_data_address( list_ptr )
endAddress                = startAddress + list_size
curAddress                = startAddress
nofPaddingElements        = ctypes.sizeof( struct3 ) / ctypes.sizeof( ctypes.c_int )

# Call the SUT (final use of argtypes)
function.argtypes = ( ctypes.c_ulong, ctypes.c_ulong, ctypes.c_ulong, ctypes.c_int )
function( startAddress, endAddress, curAddress, nofPaddingElements )

# rest of the test is simple basic python
</code></pre>

<p>Am I doing things wrong here or maybe over-complicated? Or am I doing it correct?</p>

<p>If you can't check it out: It's a snake-like game with birds. You control the first bird (by drawing a path for it to follow / using dpad), and a swarm of smaller birds follows it in line. The birds are animated, and can be rotated by 180° and mirrored (depending where they're flying through).</p>

<p>At the moment I animate the first bird only, then scale it down and save it in an invisible element which is shown 4 frames later (fluid animation purposes), instead of animating each bird individually. So for each bird you see on screen, there are 4 objects with a bitmap each. Now my question is, should I make a spritesheet and reduce the number of possible rotations (say, 1 set of sprites every 10°) or calculate the animation for each bird, or keep it my way?</p>

<p>Changing the view frame or navigationBar frame works, but I would have to do the same thing for all other views in my app (there are many of them). That will make my whole app depend on this tiny bug.</p>

<p>I also have the <code>'fb-root'</code> div and the SDK <code>javascript</code> (the button functions just as it should).</p>

<p>For some reason, when the like button is toggled on (occurs when the visitor is connected to his Facebook account AND had already liked my page before) the button will magically reduce its width (in some last second javascript) and make the other buttons (twitter/g+) hide it. It aligns just fine for a second and then 'collapses'.</p>

<p>I tried disabling my css and many other components of my site, to no avail.
I attached an image illustrating the situation.</p>

<p>EDIT: Something I just found out. The width attribute is the one that seems to be overridden. When setting <code>width = 2000</code> (rediculusly high), when the like button is enabled (user is not connected/not liked), the button is indeed <code>2000px</code> wide, but when a previously-liked user is connected, you can see the 2000px width for a second there, and then it 'collapses' again.</p>

<p>EDIT2: I seem to have found the culprit, but I don't know why and how to fix it. It seems the generated code in the toggled on facebook button sets the width to 72 instead of 100.</p>

interact with it synchronously to say: 
a) request a plan 
b) cancel a plan etc</p>

<p>However once the plan is made, the decision as to whether a plan is
 approved or disapproved is done asynchronously. The application itself
 can send other notifications to the clients asynchronously. This part has
 been implemented using spring's stomp over websocket framework. This
 work perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Now, coming to the synchronous part of the API, the plan is to provide
 a RESTful interface for the interaction. If this is done this way, the
 clients will have to build two different client API's, one using http
 for making RESTful calls and another using a stomp client to consume notifications.</p>

<p>Should we rather make it accessible via one interface? </p>

<p>I am not convinced of using Stomp for synchronous calls since I think the REST framework
will address the use case well. However I am concerned about the need for the clients to do both, although it is for different functionality.</p>

<p>Will it be okay to support both? Is this a good design practice. Can someone please advice?</p>

<p>The error comes up when I try to pass additional parameters to the function through the <code>...</code> argument. In the following example, I amend the Rosenbrock function (taken from the DEoptim documentation) to have a second argument <code>pow</code> (which I set to 2, so that the example is identical to the documented one). This works.  Then I try to do the same with the Rastrigin function (from the GenSA documentation). The same trick fails here (but the optimizer works fine if I hardcode in my second argument, as in the documented case). </p>

<p>Here is the example code:</p>

<pre><code>library(DEoptim)
## Note that the vector of parameters to be optimized must be the first
## argument of the objective function passed to DEoptim.
Rosenbrock &lt;- function(x,pow){
  x1 &lt;- x[1]
  x2 &lt;- x[2]
  100 * (x2 - x1 * x1)^pow + (1 - x1)^pow
}

lower &lt;- c(-10,-10)
upper &lt;- -lower
set.seed(1234)

# works
DEoptim(Rosenbrock,pow=2, lower, upper)

Rastrigin &lt;- function(x) {
  sum(x^2 - 10 * cos(2 * pi * x)) + 10 * length(x)
}

Rastrigin2 &lt;- function(x,p) {
  sum(x^2 - p * cos(2 * pi * x)) + 10 * length(x)
}

dimension &lt;- 2
lower &lt;- rep(-5.12, dimension)
upper &lt;- rep(5.12, dimension)

# works
DEoptim(fn=Rastrigin,lower=lower,upper=upper,
        control = list(storepopfrom = 1))

# should be same, but doesn't work
DEoptim(fn=Rastrigin2,p=10,lower=lower,upper=upper,

<p>Naturally, this problem has come up in a more complicated example, but I'm hoping that an explanation on this simple case can help me out. If it's any additional help, the ultimate goal is to call a function from a <code>data.table</code> object, where the function's first argument is a (scalar) parameter to be minimized, and the remaining arguments are data taken from the <code>data.table</code>.</p>

<p>I've got few variables I really want to hide because they do not belong outside my class. Also all such non-documented variables render inheritance useless.</p>

<p>How do you hide such variables you don't want to show outside your object?</p>

<p>To clarify why I need private variables, first one example where inability to hide variables is just an inconvenience, then another that's really a problem:</p>

<pre><code>class MyObject(object):
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length
    def __len__(self):
        return length

item = MyObject(5)
item.length
len(item)
</code></pre>

<p>So I've got two ways to access 'length' of the item here. It's only an inconvenience and nothing horrible.</p>

<pre><code>from wares import ImplementationSpecific

class MyThing(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.__no_access_even_if_useful = ImplementationSpecific()
    def restricted_access(self):
        return self.__no_access_even_if_useful.mutable_value

thing = MyThing()
thing.restricted_access()

<p>I'll take it as anyone could program. That 'anyone' can find an useful thing from my implementation specifics and use it, even if I'd have strongly discouraged of doing so! It'd be much easier to just say: ""no, it's not there, try something else.""</p>

<p>Another solution would be to hardcode credentials using something like <code>$smtp.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential(""DOMAIN\user"", ""password"")</code> (also before <code>$smtp.Send(...</code> line). I've had no luck in this either.</p>

<p>The solution I'd really like is to just send email in PowerShell anonymously using good old auth free SMTP.</p>

We've moved over from FONET to Reporting to provide decent PDF exporting and printing. There's no (free) way to print generated PDF's we could find without using an outdated version of Adobe Reader, and we can't install a third party program everywhere.</p>

<p>We are making invoices this way, with a variable numbers of invoice lines (which are variable in height too), and an optional remark. This in a subreport. At the bottom of the last page, we want the totals without VAT, the total VAT and the totals including VAT. When there is no VAT in this invoice, these lines are hidden.</p>

<p>However, there is no way we found to anchor these totals to the bottom of the last page. We are already using the footer to show something on each page, and abusing the header to show the column headers for the invoice lines, as the row headers are not repeated on the next page. </p>

<p>What we've tried:
 - We've tried adding a footer to the invoice lines subreport to show this, but this can't contain a Tablix and doesn't show. 
 - Adding whitespace between the invoice lines and totals only works with a few invoice lines. When more than 4, it places the totals on the beginning of the next page. Removing the whitespace places the totals right after the invoice lines, while we want it at the bottom of the last page.
 - We could work around this in FONET, by using an absolute table, but we have not seen this possibility in Reporting.
 - We would use another system if it's simply not possible. We need something which supports designing, tables which can be populated with DataSets or IEnumerables, anchoring, embedded images, direct printing and exporting to PDF. Localization (strings based on language using default resource files) support would be a huge plus.</p>

I have initialised a Ubuntu / Rstudio AMI on EC2 with 30 GB of RAM</p>

<p>Using topicmodels I need to perform 45 LDA models on a corpus of about 300K documents.</p>

<p>My script works fine on sub-sets of the data, but when I increase the amount of LDA models required it just hangs.
Here is the code snippet I am using.</p>

<pre><code>ks &lt;- seq(15, 60, by = 1)

models &lt;- lapply(ks, function(k) LDA(rowcorp.dtm, k, method = ""Gibbs"", control = list(burnin = burnin, iter = iter, keep = keep)))
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to either monitor the EC2 instance, or the 'models' function to make sure it is working, during the process, as I have left it for nearly four hours and my CPU usages on CloudWatch is only at 6.5%......</p>

<p>Can i configure either my script or my AMI to work more effectively and let me know if it is running, or hanging.</p>

<p>I have a DB full of different businesses, where their <code>Unique ID</code>corresponds with the name of their picture on my server. Every time a page on my website loads I want php to grab the business (and subsequent ad) with the fewest views. In case it is pertinent I also have two different sizes for ads. I will try to illustrate.</p>

<p>Table:</p>

<pre><code>Business Name | Unique ID | Views | Size
--------------+-----------+-------+------
Business 1    | 1         | 50    | Small
Business 2    | 2         | 9     | Small
Business 3    | 3         | 67    | Large
Business 4    | 4         | 9     | Large
</code></pre>

<p>so I use this script to retrieve the business with the lowest views</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM ads WHERE size='Large' ORDER BY views ASC
</code></pre>

<p>Now to my question - this works until all views get to ""9"" then it seems like it just picks two ads (one of each size) to always display. So in the example you would expect <code>Business 4</code> to be selected, but for some reason <code>business 3</code> is always the one chosen.</p>

<p>Also, when I investigate in PhpMyAdmin and I click on the column name <code>views</code> to sort by views and the two businesses are always together at the top or bottom (ASC and DESC respectively) never mixing in with the list.  Right now when I sort ASC I get:</p>

<pre><code>Views
50
67
9
9 
9
9
</code></pre>

<p>The 50 and 67 are obviously not in correct order and they are the two that are always shown on the webpage. It seems like after ""9"" these two are assigned some sort of priority, I can't figure out.</p>

<p>I should also mention the way the table is handled when called by the specific web page:</p>

<pre><code>$result = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM ads WHERE size='Large' ORDER BY views ASC"") or die(mysql_error());
$productCount = mysql_num_rows($result); // count the output amount
if ($productCount &gt; 0) {
    if($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){ 
            $id = $row[""id""];
        $url = $row[""url""];
        $views = $row[""views""];
            $businessName = $row[""businessName""];
    }
}
$views = $views + 1;
$sql = mysql_query(""UPDATE ads SET views='$views' WHERE id='$id'"");
</code></pre>

<p>This is in the php code of every page on my website.</p>

<p>The ads are displayed with this html code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""ad1""&gt;
        &lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo $url; ?&gt;"" target=""_blank""&gt; &lt;img src=""inventory_images/&lt;?php echo $id; ?&gt;.jpg"" alt=""&lt;?php echo $businessName; ?&gt;"" height=""144"" width=""216""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully that is enough information, your help is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>My code for handling the input looks like above. The <code>java</code> documentation says about the <code>InputSource</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there is no character stream, but there is a byte stream, the parser will use that byte stream, using the encoding specified in the InputSource or else (if no encoding is specified) autodetecting the character encoding using an algorithm such as the one in the XML specification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am passing in a <code>ByteStream</code> and I am don't specify an encoding, so according to the documentation the encoding should be auto detected. But it doesn't. All files that are encoded in UTF-8 are fine, but the ISO-8859-1 ones are not (I am getting a <code>Parser Expat... Exception for some invalid characters</code>). If I set the encoding of the <code>InputSource</code> manually to ""ISO-8859-1"" it behaves the other way round.</p>

<p>How can I solve this? I searched Google and <code>Stackoverflow</code> for hours, but not finding a solution. I also tried to pass a <code>CharacterStream</code> to the <code>InputSource</code>, but some characters <code>(äöüÄÖÜß)</code> in the ISO-8859-1 files are still displayed as ""?"" in my app.</p>

The D3 tween method was the approach I implemented, specifically, <a href=""https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#attrTween"" rel=""nofollow"">attrTween</a>. However, the intervals that the attrTween function steps through as it transitions from the start value to the end value are too few for my application, which leads to a jarring effect as large numbers of circles appear with each step in the transition rather than just a small number of circles if the interval was smaller.</p>

<p>The code relevant to the transition is shown below:</p>

<p>I've been trying with a Webclient using DownloadfileAsync() and a list system as I'm downloading these files one after the other due to their sizes.</p>

<pre><code>DownloadClient.DownloadProgressChanged += new DownloadProgressChangedEventHandler(DownloadProgress);
DownloadClient.DownloadFileCompleted += new AsyncCompletedEventHandler(DownloadCompleted);

private void FileDownload()
{
    DownloadClient.DownloadFileAsync(new Uri(@""ftp://"" + RemoteAddress + FilesToDownload[0]), LocalDirectory + FilesToDownload[0]));
}

private void DownloadProgress(object sender, DownloadProgressChangedEventArgs e)
{
    // Handle progress
}

private void DownloadCompleted(object sender, AsyncCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    FilesToDownload.RemoveAt(0);
    FileDownload();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works absolutely fine this way on small files, they are all downloaded one by one, the progress is reported and <code>DownloadCompleted</code> fires after each file. This issue I'm facing with big files is that it launches the first download without any issue but doesn't do anything after that. The <code>DownloadCompleted</code> event never fires for some reasons. It looks like the <code>WebClient</code> doesn't know that the file has finished to download, which is an issue as I'm using this event to launch the next download in the FilesToDownload list.</p>

<p>I've also tried to do that synchronously using <code>WebClient.DownloadFile</code> and a <code>for</code> loop to cycle through my <code>FilesToDownload</code> list. It downloads the first file correctly and I get an exception when the second download should start: ""The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive"".</p>

<p>Finally, I've tried to go through this via FTP using <a href=""http://www.enterprisedt.com/products/edtftpnet/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">edtFTPnet</a> but I'm facing download speed issues (i.e. My download goes full speed with the <code>WebClient</code> and I just get 1/3 of the full speed with edtFTPnet library).</p>

<p>Any thoughts? I have to admit that I'm running out of ideas here.</p>

<p>like the title says, I'm in a bit of a pickle.</p>

<p>so here's the outline of my problem. I have this ship right. It rests in the center bottom of the screen (240,0). When the user touches to the right at a point greater than 240 the ship moves right. And left if the user touches at a point less than 240. HOWEVER this is great when there's only one finger on the screen at a time. I need it to where if the user touches right, doesn't lift their finger, then touches left (OH CRAP THERE'S TWO FINGERS ON THE SCREEN) the ship keeps moving right until they lift their right finger, then suddenly the ship moves left towards the second touch.</p>

<p>I'm using timers to add/subtract a number from the current x coordinate to get it to move.</p>

<p>This is what I have in a nutshell: (Don't laugh or hate I'm a noob)</p>

<pre><code>-(void)moveShipLeft:(id)sender {

 shipView.center = CGPointMake(shipView.center.x - 2, 320 - (shipView.image.size.height / 2));

}
-(void)moveShipRight:(id)sender { 

 shipView.center = CGPointMake(shipView.center.x + 2, 320 - (shipView.image.size.height / 2));

}
- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { 

 UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject];
 CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view];

 if (240 &lt; location.x){rightTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.01 target:self selector:@selector(moveShipRight:) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];}
 if (240 &gt; location.x){leftTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.01 target:self selector:@selector(moveShipLeft:) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];}

 [shipView setCenter:shipView.center];
 }
- (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {


  if (rightTimer != nil)               //Kill the timer that goes right upon touch removal
   [rightTimer invalidate];
  rightTimer = nil;

  if (leftTimer != nil)                //Kill the timer that goes left on touch removal
   [leftTimer invalidate];
  leftTimer = nil;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to fully replicate the controls for the game ""Radiant"" if its any help.
I will seriously love you forever if you help.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I want this to happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>user touches the right side of screen</li>
<li>ship moves right</li>
<li>user touches left side of screen with second finger</li>
<li>while the ship is still moving right because the user hasn't lifted their first touch, the user then lifts the first touch</li>
<li>THEN the ship instantly changes course to move left towards the second touch</li>
</ol>

<p>right now I have multi touch enabled, so now it works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>user touches the right side of screen</li>
<li>ship moves right</li>
<li>user touches left side of screen with second finger</li>
<li>ship moves left then user lift first touch</li>
<li>ship is stopped in its tracks even though the user hasn't lifted the second touch</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""d""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Anonymous text&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Some text&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Another some text&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Another anonymous text&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and styles:</p>

<pre><code>div#d{
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    background: aqua;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my case <code>div#d</code> contains block-level and inline-level boxes. But in the sec. <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level"" rel=""nofollow"">9.2.1.1</a> said that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if a block container box (such as that generated for the DIV above)
  has a block-level box inside it (such as the P above), then we force
  it to have only block-level boxes inside it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Q: Why we can put inside the block-level element (e.g. <code>div</code>) both inline and block elements and they will displayed as inline and block element, but in spec said that block container box either contains only block-level boxes or establishes an inline formatting context and thus contains only inline-level boxes.</p>

<p>I'm confused. Can you dispel my doubts?</p>

<p>I'm making a game that uses sprites for graphics. Sprites are based on Images (SFML library images, not standard C# images, but I don't think that really matters). These images need to be loaded from a file on disk, and this can get costly (time wise) when many sprites need to be created in rapid succession. To reduce some of this load time, I want to make use of a cahce like structure to store the images files, and when they were last updated (I'll be using this update time to determine when to evict stuff from the cache). The cache will be indexed using a combination of the sprite name and a few other details. this index will map to a structure like below:</p>

<pre><code>struct ImageEntry
{
    Image image;
    TickCount lastupdate;
    TickCount evictionTime;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the game requests a sprite, the request will be issued to a content manager who will look for a match in the cache structure. If a match is found, a structure like above will be found. The content manager will use the image to make the sprite, then update the lastupdate time to the time the structure was called. If a match is not found, a new strucut will be made and the image loaded from the image file (and used to make the sprite). The lastupdate time will be set to the current time. eviction time is set based on a predefined constant, or an optional component in the request. </p>

<p>Now heres what I need to do: periodically, I need to run through the whole cache, compare each struct's lastupdate to the current game time. If the different between those two is greater then the eviction time, I want to evict the struct entry from the cache. Additionally, if a sprite request issues a new struct, and the size of the cache is greater then a predefined value, I need to find the least recently updated struct and evict it to make room for the new struct. </p>

<p>essentially, I'm looking for the ideal data structure the has quick lookups for indexing keys, and quick iteration for the time updates/size overflow evictions.</p>

<p>Making a Dictionary was my first thought, and that certainly has fast indexing, but given I'm going to be removing elements and adding new ones fairly regularly, I'm concerned about the performance. List> could work, but then lookup is going to take time.</p>

<p>For reference, I was likely going to be limiting the cahce to about 30-40 images at a time, and range anywhere from 2 kb to 500 kb and eviction time will typically be about ~6 minutes. I'd like to be able to check for evictions at least every 1-2 seconds</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into the best type of data structure to use for this.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

I want to have my game board printed to the screen and stay on the screen while only the characters that change are the only thing to change, while keeping the rest of the game board stays on the screen in the same place without clearing the screen and re-printing everything. The game I made more my final last class, I used the clear screen and it appeared to flash a lot because it was reprinting the entire screen each time a change was made. Instead of putting all of my code on here and so that someone else doesn't do my project for me I wrote the following code for an example of my question:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;

using namespace std;

const char * SUITS[] = { ""HEARTS"", ""CLUBS"", ""DIAMONDS"", ""SPADES"" };
const char * FACES[] = { ""ACE"", ""TWO"", ""THREE"", ""FOUR"", ""FIVE"", ""SIX"", 
            ""SEVEN"", ""EIGHT"", ""NINE"", ""TEN"", ""JACK"", ""QUEEN"", ""KING"" };

int main() {
    char q = 'a';
    do {
        srand(time(0));

        cout &lt;&lt; ""This is the card: "" &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; FACES[rand() % 13] &lt;&lt; "" of "" &lt;&lt; SUITS[rand() % 4] &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Press any key to get another card, or q to quit: "";
        cin &gt;&gt; q;

    } while (q != 'q');
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I make it so that the only thing that changes above is this line when printed: FACES[rand() % 13] &lt;&lt; "" of "" &lt;&lt; SUITS[rand() % 4] &lt;&lt; endl;</p>

<p>My actual code will just display a box with an char to show the face and a char to show the suit it will look like this when printed:</p>

<pre><code>  ---------
 |         |
 |    A    |   (A is for Ace)
 |         |
 |    S    |   (S is for Spades)
 |         |
  ---------
</code></pre>

<p>How can I change just the A or the S without changing anything else? 
Or using the code above, How can I change just the FACES string and the SUITS string without changing the text above or below it?</p>

<hr>

<p>@regmagik- It won't let me put code in the comments and have it still formatted:
This is what I have now:</p>

<pre><code>const char SUITS[] = { 'H', 'C', 'D', 'S'};
const char FACES[] = { 'A','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','T','J','Q','K'};

    DWORD dw;
    COORD here;
    HANDLE hStdOut = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
    if (hStdOut == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
    {
        printf(""Invalid handle"");
    }
    here.X = 10;
    here.Y = 10;

    //suit random num
    char suit_char = SUITS[rand() % 4];
    char face_char = FACES[rand() % 13];

    WriteConsoleOutputCharacter(hStdOut, &amp;suit_char, 7, here, &amp;dw);

    return 0;

<p>I'm improving our custom debug tracing system to handle multiple threads properly. For each  line of trace output, I'd like to print a thread id or a thread name. Threads are instantiated in various ways, e.g. both NSOperationQueue and pthread functions are used.</p>

<p>I've currently a following two alternatives, but I'm not satisfied with either of them. Are there any other options?</p>

<p><strong>pthread_t option</strong></p>

<p><code>pthread_t</code> seems to be a typedef of a platform specific <code>_opaque_pthread_h</code>. It would be ok to use fields of <code>_opaque_pthread_h</code> for now, even if it's hack-y and not portable. It has a <code>__sig</code> field of type long, but that seems to have a same value for all threads of my process. </p>

<p><strong>NSThread option</strong> </p>

<p><code>[NSThread name]</code> requires <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code> to be in place, but I don't want that to be a requirement as most of our code is pure C++, so it would be nice to just to launch c++ function without autorelease pool wrapping. </p>

&lt;h2 id=""pgepubid00004""&gt;PREFACE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an individual—he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story—that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""TOM!""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for ""style,"" not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""I never did see the beat of that boy!""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and ""jimpson"" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Y-o-u-u TOM!""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in there?""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Nothing.""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; that truck?""&lt;/p&gt;

<p>My end goal is to have the text start at ""Chapter 1"". I want to do this by stripping out all the unnecessary portions. For this case I'm just concentrating on the ""CONTENTS"" section. I want to remove it.</p>

<p>I tried using the following RegEx, which did not work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pattern: <code>[\S\s]*contents[\S\s]*&lt;h\d</code></p>
  
  <p>Replace with: <em>empty</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this finds well past the CONTENTS section, and removes the PREFACE as well, which I don't want.</p>

<p>What would be my best course of action for removing the CONTENTS?</p>

<p>I found this post: <a href=""http://askubuntu.com/questions/264037/how-to-use-qt-creator-with-python"">How to use Qt Creator with Python?</a>
but since at the time of that question, Qt Creator was at it's 2.8 version and now it's 3.1, maybe python support for Qt Creator is added(like c++); is it true?</p>

<p>is there anyway to use Qt Creator as a python IDE?
if 'yes', what is the code editor's features compare to other mature IDEs (like Eclipse or NetBeans)?</p>

I made some research and I found out that I had to use output buffering so that the PHP content in the file can be processed. So I did something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
    require_once('html2pdf.class.php');    

    ob_start();
    require_once('my_file.php');

    $html2pdf = new HTML2PDF('P','A3','fr', false, 'ISO-8859-1');
    $html2pdf-&gt;writeHTML($content);
    $html2pdf-&gt;Output('file_name.pdf', 'D');
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The file <strong>my_file.php</strong> is the file that has some PHP code and the HTML content that I wanna save to a PDF, and the variable <strong>$content</strong> is the actual content with the PHP codes processed and everything. This works fine on Apache, but not on IIS.</p>

<p>Does anybody know an alternative way to make this work witout using ouput buffering? I tried file_get_contents('my_file.php'); but my php contents in my_file.php do not get processed when I do so.</p>

<p>Please, I'm looking for ways to do this without output buffering so that it can work on any server. I'm not looking for answers telling me to change my IIS server configuration or to use something else other than html2pdf.</p>

<p>I have created an applet to extract public key of a certificate extracted from a smart card.
This public key is then stored in database.
The private key of certificate is used to sign data and the public key is then used to verify the signature.
Code for extracting public key from certificate:</p>

<pre><code>private byte[] getPublicKey(KeyStore paramKeyStore)
    throws GeneralSecurityException {
  Enumeration localEnumeration = paramKeyStore.aliases();

  if (localEnumeration.hasMoreElements()) {
    String element = (String) localEnumeration.nextElement();

    byte[] publicKeyByteArray =
        arrayOfCertificate[0].getPublicKey().getEncoded();

    return publicKeyByteArray;
  }
  throw new KeyStoreException(""The keystore is empty!"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This publicKeyByteArray is then storeed in database as BLOB after converting to string using bytes2String method:</p>

<pre><code>private static String bytes2String(byte[] bytes) {
  StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();
  for (byte b : bytes) {
    String hexString = Integer.toHexString(0x00FF &amp; b);
    string.append(hexString.length() == 1 ? ""0"" + hexString : hexString);
  }
  return string.toString();

<p>One option would be defining a common class that receives the particular handler type as one of the  __init__ parameters:</p>

<pre><code>class Handler:
   def __init__ (self, handlerType):
       self._handlerType = handlerType
       self._handler = handlerType.handleStuff

   def handleStuff(self, *args, **kwargs):
       return self._handler(args, kwargs)


# case specific handlers

class Handler_Case1:
   def handleStuff(self, *args, **kwargs):
       print 'Handling Case 1'


class Handler_Case2:
   def handleStuff(self, *args, **kwargs):
       print 'Handling Case 2'



if __name__ == '__main__':
   handlers = []
   handlers.append(Handler(Handler_Case1))
   handlers.append(Handler(Handler_Case2))
   for h in handlers:
       h.handleStuff()
</code></pre>

<p>However, this results in a TypeError:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TypeError: unbound method handleStuff() must be called with Handler_Case1 instance as first argument (got tuple instance instead)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another option is to mimic abstract function, as shown <a href=""http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>(""Q: Can you implement abstract classes in Python in 0 lines of code?""):</p>

<pre><code>class Handler:
  def handleStuff(self, *args, **kwargs): abstract
  def commonFunction(self):
       print 'Common function'


 # case specific handlers

 class Handler_Case1(Handler):
  def handleStuff(self, *args, **kwargs):
      print 'Handling Case 1'


 class Handler_Case2(Handler):
  def handleStuff(self, *args, **kwargs):
      print 'Handling Case 2'



 if __name__ == '__main__':
  handlers = []
  h1 = (Handler_Case1())
  h2 = (Handler_Case2())
  handlers.append(h1)
  handlers.append(h2)
  for h in handlers:
      h.handleStuff()
      print
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Which of the two approaches is more pythonic?
and</li>
<li>How to implement the first one?</li>

And I have a Widget from where I can drag and drop some files from the user computer to the Scene which triggers the creation of a new QGraphicsItem. </p>

<p>Ok, now here's what I'm trying to do... I'd like to make those QGraphicsItem to change their images, texts, and so on when I drop an element from my Widget. In other words, I'd like to make them behave as some sort of containers that can show the dropped element. Most of this functionality is already implemented, but I coudn't make my QGraphicsItem to accept the drop events at the same time as my QGraphicsScene. When one of them is working, the other one is not.</p>

<p>At the end of each ""drag"" event from my QGraphicsScene I've inserted this code:</p>

<pre><code>void SpatialScene::dragEnterEvent(QGraphicsSceneDragDropEvent *event)
{
    (...)
    QGraphicsScene::dragEnterEvent(event);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I did that, the events where reaching my QGraphicsItem just fine, but then all of my drop events where rejected by the QGraphicsScene and I have no Ideia why. (I'm receiving a IgnoreAction in the dropEvent method).</p>

<p>I don't know if I've made my problem clear but... Can someone help me with this? How can I make both QGraphicsScene and its QGraphicsItem to accept the drop events?</p>

Obviously, I want to make sure this view is as fast as possible. So my question is, how can this query be improved (optimized) for use in such a view?</p>

final list of valid  votecombos
[[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1,2,2]]
</code></pre>

<p>The way, I think, to solve this problem is to imagine a tree of all possible combinations and then dynamically prune the tree for impossible solutions. For example imagine <code>n=3</code> level tree like this </p>

<pre><code>                            root
                         /        \
                        1          2
                    /      \    /     \
                   1       2    1     2
                 /  \    /  \  /  \  /  \
                1   2   1   2  1  2  1   2
</code></pre>

<p>Each path to a leaf is a possible combination. As you can imagine for levels <code>n=3</code> and <code>m=5</code>, the number of nodes is <code>N == m**n == 5**3 == 125' nodes. Its easy to see that the tree gets really really large even for</code>m=5<code>and</code>n=20` approx. 96 trillion nodes. So the tree cannot be stored in memory. But it also doesnt have to be since it is very structured.</p>

<p>The way to get all possible valid combinations is by DFS traversing the tree in a kind of pre-order way but also keep on pruning the tree at the same time as you traverse. For example, in the above example, the first three combinations <code>{222, 221, 212}</code> are valid however 211 is not valid. It also means that any other combination containing two 1's <em>from that point on</em> is not going to be valid. So we can pretty much prune the whole left part of the tree with root 1 except 122 ! This would have helped us avoid checking the 3 combinations.</p>

<p>To do this I wrote a simple python script</p>

<pre><code>import string
import itertools
import numpy as np
import re

chars = '21'
grad_thr = 1.5
seats = 3

excllist = []
validlist = []

for word in itertools.product(chars, repeat = seats):
    # form the string of digits
    votestr = ''.join(word)
    print (votestr)

    # convert string into list of chars
    liststr = list(votestr)
    #print liststr

    # map list of chars to list of ints
    listint = map(int, liststr)

    if len(list(set(listint) &amp; set(excllist))) == 0:
        # if there are no excluded votes in this votecombo then proceed

        # compute a function over the digits; func can be average/bayesian score/something else.
        y_mean = np.mean(listint)
        print 'avg %f' %y_mean
        #y_bayes = bayesian score

        if y_mean &gt;= grad_thr:
            # if function result is greater than grad threshold then save result to a list of valid votes
            validlist.append(listint)
            print 'geq than %f -&gt; include in acceptable set' %grad_thr

        elif y_mean &lt; grad_thr:
            # if function result is not greater than grad threshold then add logic to stop searching the tree further
            # prune unnecessary part of the tree

            if listint[-1] not in excllist:
                excllist = [int(d) for d in range(listint[-1] + 1)]
                print 'adding %d and below to the exclude list' %listint[-1]
            else:
                print '%d already present in exclude list' %listint[-1]

    else:
        print 'skipping this vote combo'

print '\nfinal valid list of votecombos'
print validvotelist
print 'exclude list'
print excllist
print '\n'
</code></pre>

<p>In this way I go through every possible combo and <em>skip</em> to aviod computing the average. However I still end up checking each possible combo after I have entered the for-loop. </p>

<p>Is it possible to not check the combo at all? i.e. we know combo <code>121</code> does not work, however we still have to enter the for loop and then skip the combo. Is it possible to not do that?</p>

<p>First, let me show you a piece of assembly code the BIOS executes:</p>

<pre><code>[f000:fec3]    0xffec3: lidtw  %cs:0x7908
[f000:fec9]    0xffec9: lgdtw  %cs:0x7948
[f000:fecf]    0xffecf: mov    %cr0,%eax
[f000:fed2]    0xffed2: or     $0x1,%eax
[f000:fed6]    0xffed6: mov    %eax,%cr0
[f000:fed9]    0xffed9: ljmpl  $0x8,$0xffee1
</code></pre>

<p>From the looks of it, This code sets up the interrupt table and the descriptor table and then turns on the protected mode.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Why do we go into protected mode
in the BIOS? Shouldn't the
bootloader run in real mode (btw -
why does it need to run in real
mode?)</li>
<li>I searched but didn't find anywhere
exactly how the ljmpl instruction
works, and is the difference between
it and ljmp and regular jmp - I
would appreciate if someone would
point in the right direction.</li>
<li>Why do we perform the jump? What is
the purpose of this instruction? </li>
</ol>

<p>Moving on to the boot loader code - </p>

<pre><code># Switch from real to protected mode, using a bootstrap GDT
# and segment translation that makes virtual addresses
# identical to their physical addresses, so that the
# effective memory map does not change during the switch.
lgdt    gdtdesc
movl    %cr0, %eax
orl     $CR0_PE_ON, %eax
movl    %eax, %cr0

# Jump to next instruction, but in 32-bit code segment.
# Switches processor into 32-bit mode.
ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>It says that the processor is in
real mode - but we just saw that the
BIOS switches to protected mode...
I'm confused - how can this be
possible?</li>
<li>How do we switch to 32bit mode? What
causes the processor to magically go
into 32bit mode due to the ljmp
instruction?</li>
</ol>

<p>And another thing that I don't understand - when I track the execution of the bootloader with gdb I see the following instruction being executed (that's the ljmp instruction from the bootloader code):</p>

<pre><code>ljmp   $0x8,$0x7c32
</code></pre>

<p>But when I looked in the .asm file I saw the following:</p>

<pre><code>ljmp   $0xb866,$0x87c32
</code></pre>

<p>Totally lost here - How come the instruction written in the .asm file and the instruction executed are different? I have a hunch this has to do with the protected mode and how it translates the addresses but I don't really get it.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any help!</p>

The work queue master runs as a separate process (on a separate machine altogether) and tasks are submitted to the master via HTTP/REST requests.  Once tasks are submitted to the work queue, client applications can submit another HTTP request to get status information about tasks.</p>

<p>For my web application, I'd like it to provide some sort of progress bar view that gives the user some indication of how far along task processing has come.  The obvious way to implement this would be an AJAX progress meter widget that periodically polls the work queue for status on the tasks that have been submitted.  My question is, is there a better way to accomplish this without the frequent polling?</p>

<p>I've considered having the client web application open up a server socket on which it could listen for notifications from the work master.  Another similar thought I've had is to use XMPP or a similar protocol for the status notifications.  (Of course, the master/worker system would need to be updated to provide notifications either way but I own the code for that so can make any necessary updates myself.)</p>

"586349","1","586398","","2009-02-25 15:06:23","","9","1007","<p>I'm currently working on cross-platform applications and was just curious as to how other people tackle problems such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Endianess</li>
<li>Floating point support (some systems emulate in software, VERY slow)</li>
<li>I/O systems (i.e. display, sound, file access, networking, etc. )</li>
<li>And of course, the plethora of compiler differences</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously this is targeted at languages like c/c++ which don't abstract most of this stuff (unlike java or c#, which aren't supported on a lot of systems).</p>

<p>And if you were curious, the systems I'm developing on are the Nintendo DS, Wii, PS3, XBox360 and PC.</p>

<p><HR/>
<em>EDIT</em><br />
There have been a lot of really good answers on here, ranging from how to handle the differences yourself, to library suggestions (even the suggestion of just giving in and using wine). I'm not actually looking for a solution (already have one), but was just curious as to how others tackle this situation as it is always good to see how others think/code so you can continue to evolve and grow.</p>

<p>Here's the way I've tackled the problem (and, if you haven't guessed from this list of systems above, I'm developing console/windows games). Please keep in mind that the systems I work on generally don't have cross-platform libraries already written for them (Sony actually recommends that you write your own rendering engine from scratch and just use their OpenGL implementation, which doesn't quite follow the standards anyway, as a reference).</p>

<p><B>Endianess</B><br />
All of our assets can be custom made for each system. All of our raw data (except for textures) is stored in XML which we convert to a system specific binary format when the project is built. Seeing as how we are developing for game consoles, we don't need to worry about data being transfered between platforms with different endian formats (only the PC allows the users to do this, thus, it is insulated from the other systems as well).</p>

<p><B>Floating point support</B><br />
Most modern systems do floating point values fine, the exception to this is the Nintendo DS (and GBA, but thats pretty much a dead platform for us these days). We handle this through 2 different classes. The first is a ""fixed point"" class (templated, can specify what integer type to use and how many bits for the decimal value) which implements all arithmetic operators (taking care of bit-shifts) and automates type conversions. The second is a ""floating point"" class, which is a basically just a wrapper around the float for the most part, the only difference is that it also implements the shift operators. By implementing the shift operators, we can then use bit shifts for fast multiplications/divisions on the DS and then seamlessly transition to platforms that work better with floats (like the XBox360).</p>

<p><B>I/O Systems</B><br />
This is probably the trickiest problem for us, because every system has there own method for controller input, graphics (XBox360 uses a variant of DirectX9, PS3 has OpenGL or you can write your own from scratch and the DS and Wii have thier own proprietary systems), sound and networking (really only the DS differs in protocol by much, but then they each have their own server system that you have to use).  </p>

<p>The way we ended up tackling this was by simply writing fairly high level wrappers for each of the systems (e.g. meshes for graphics, key mapping systems for controllers, etc.) and having all the systems use the same header files for access. It's then just a matter of writing specific cpp files for each platform (thus forming ""the engine"").</p>

<p><B>Compiler Differences</B><br />
This is one thing that can't be tackled too easily, as we run into problems with compilers, we usually log the information on a local wiki (so others can see what to look out for and the workarounds to go with it) and if possible, write a macro that will handle the situation for us. While its not the most elegant solution, it works and seeing how some compilers a simply broken in certain places, the more elegant solutions tend to break the compilers anyway. (I just wish all of the compilers implemented Microsoft's ""#pragma once"" command, so much easier than wrapping everything in #ifdef's)</p>

<p>It might be simple, but I don't understand how to get the selected features indices in such a scenario.</p>

<p>on a regular scenario I could do something like that:</p>

<pre><code>anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=10)

anove_filter.fit_transform(data.X, data.Y)

anova_filter.get_support()
</code></pre>

<p>but on a multilabel scenario my labels dimensions are #samples X #unique_labels so fit and fit_transform yield the following exception:
ValueError: bad input shape</p>

<p>which makes sense, because it expects labels of dimension [#samples]</p>

<p>on the multilabel scenario, it makes sense to do something like that:</p>

<pre><code>clf = Pipeline([('f_classif', SelectKBest(f_classif, k=10)),('svm', LinearSVC())])

multiclf = OneVsRestClassifier(clf, n_jobs=-1)

multiclf.fit(data.X, data.Y)

<p>So the effect of preloading a VPAID ad is essentially not very useful, because you could not extract the actual media file for preloading merely by inspecting the VAST XMLs. At best - you may preload the final ads manager swf. </p>

<p>The final swf, when played, may then begin to fetch ads from different providers (e.g. brightroll, liverail, etc.), and this process takes a while. At the end of this, an ad might pop up. </p>

<p>Is it allowed to try to preload the actual eventual ad media, or to find out if there is a ""fill"" (an ad media will be yielded by the ads manager)? For example, by ""playing"" the ads manager swf in the background, hidden and muted, this might be possible, but it sounds a bit fishy (what if the user eventually does not reach the point where the ad should actually be shown? it would count as fraud). </p>

<pre><code>#macro( surround $x )
  surround:$x
    $bodyContent
  /surround:$x
#end
</code></pre>

<p>Invocation <code>#@surround(""A"")bunch o' stuff#end</code> produces ""surround:A bunch o' stuff /surround:A"" as
expected. Invocation <code>#@surround(""A"")#@surround(""B"")more stuff#end#end</code> produces
surround:A surround:B more stuff /surround:B /surround:A which is exactly what I want.</p>

<p>But now I want to build upwards with another macro</p>

<pre><code>#macro( annotated-surround $x $y )
  #@surround( $x )
    annotate:$y
    $bodyContent
  #end
#end
</code></pre>

<p>The intended expansion of <code>#annotated-surround( ""C"" ""note"" ) stuff #end</code> is
    surround:C annotate:note stuff /surround:C</p>

<p>...but this doesn't work; I get the dreaded semi-infinite expansion of the annotated-surround body
content.</p>

<p>I have read the answer at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12519289/closure-in-velocity-template-macros"">Closure in Velocity template macros</a> and still don't quite know whether what I want to do is possible.</p>

<p>I'm willing to do arbitrarily tricky things within the definitions of <code>#surround</code> and
<code>#annotated-surround</code>, but I don't want the users of those macros to see any complexity. The
whole idea is to simplify their lives.</p>

<p>As long as I have your ear: Setting <code>macro.provide.scope.control=true</code> is supposed to ""a local namespace in macros"". What does this mean? Is the provided namespace independent of the default context, but with a single such space shared among all invocations of all macros? Or is a separate context provided for each macro invocation, even recursively? It has to be the latter because of <code>$macro.parent</code>, right?</p>

<p>And yet another question. Consider the following macro:</p>

<pre><code>#macro( recursive $x )
  #if($x == 0)
    zero
  #else
    $x before . . . 
    #set($xMinusOne = $x - 1)
    #recursive($xMinusOne)
    . . . $x after
  #end
#end
</code></pre>

<p><code>#recursive( 4 )</code> yields:</p>

<p>4 before . . .
3 before . . .
2 before . . .
1 before . . .
zero . . .
0 after . . .
0 after . . .
0 after . . .
4 after</p>

<p>Now I understand all those occurrences of ""0"": there's only one global $x, so assigning to it on
the recursive calls smashes it and it doesn't get restored. But where on earth does that final ""4""
come from? For that matter, how is it that my first ""surround"" macro works to arbitrary depth;
how come its final $x doesn't get smashed in inner calls?</p>

<p>Sorry to be so prolix, but I have been unable to find clear documentation in this matter.</p>

<p>I need to be able to get the TITLE and DESCIPTION metadata out of a page.</p>

<p>I've been trying to do this but I've been getting more errors than actual results. (I have an array of about 10 URLS, usually only about 2 of them give me the descrption. I have yet to get the title).</p>

<p>So how do I, in PHP, get the Desc and Title from a remote page, and if there is none or if there's an error, ignore it?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ailis.de/~k/uploads/scripts/import-startssl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ailis.de/~k/uploads/scripts/import-startssl</a></p>

<p>But I STILL get the:</p>

<pre><code>Server access Error: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException
</code></pre>

<p>error. JAVA_HOME set correctly. Any suggestion highly appreciated!</p>

<p>More info:</p>

<p>Its Ivy from SBT 0.12.2 (using pualp's script <a href=""https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras</a>) that is  barfing on the cert:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>--
Update:</p>

<p>The problem seems to be something totally different not related to Java per se. Visiting the page from a browser yields a green cert and I can see the info that its signed from StartSSL. But even wget or curl chokes and tells me that this is a self-signed cert. It seems that different certs are delivered depending on the client.</p>

<p>The repo is at <a href=""https://repo.woodenstake.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://repo.woodenstake.se/</a> - If you paste this in your browser I would guess that you get the StartSSL-cert. BUT if you do wget <a href=""https://repo.woodenstake.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://repo.woodenstake.se/</a> you get some old self-signed cert that I don't know where it comes from.</p>

<p>-- Update to update:</p>

<p>So the problem is that I'm serving a few sites of the form *.woodenstake.se. I got the feeling that it would be possible to have different certs like:</p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen 443;
    server_name site1.woodenstake.se;
    client_max_body_size 512m;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate cert1.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key cert1.key;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        if (!-f $request_filename) {
            proxy_pass http://server1;
            break;
        }
    }
}

server {
    listen 443;
    server_name site2.woodenstake.se;
    client_max_body_size 512m;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate cert2.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key cert2.key;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        if (!-f $request_filename) {
            proxy_pass http://server2;
            break;
        }
    }
}

<p>and it works just fine in all my browsers.</p>

<p>However, it doesn't work from wget or JDK6.</p>

<p>1) The following gives me seg faults around the time when the <code>fib()</code> function returns its results. <strong>EDIT: with inputs >= 9</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int fibs[] = {1, 1};    // dynamic array
    int i = 2;              // start at 3rd element
    while(i &lt; n) {
        fibs[i] = fibs[i-2] + fibs[i-1];
        cout &lt;&lt; ""DEBUG: fibs["" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ""] = "" &lt;&lt; fibs[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
        i = i+1;
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; ""about to return to main()"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return fibs[n-1];
}

int main() {
    cout &lt;&lt; ""\n================= Hello cruel world ================="" &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Enter a number:  "";
    int x;
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""fib("" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "") = "" &lt;&lt; fib(x) &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""================ Goodbye cruel world ================\n"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the code works just fine, the numbers are found correctly. But 2) when I change the function to support long integers, it starts acting weird:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

long fib(int n) {
    long fibs[] = {1L, 1L};    // dynamic array
    int i = 2;                 // start at 3rd element
    while(i &lt; n) {
        fibs[i] = fibs[i-2] + fibs[i-1];
        cout &lt;&lt; ""DEBUG: fibs["" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ""] = "" &lt;&lt; fibs[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
        i = i+1;
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; ""about to return to main()"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return fibs[n-1];
}

int main() {
    cout &lt;&lt; ""\n================= Hello cruel world ================="" &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Enter a number:  "";
    int x;
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""fib("" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "") = "" &lt;&lt; fib(x) &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""================ Goodbye cruel world ================\n"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>================= Hello cruel world =================

I can load and execute the exported functions however the problem is that when I load the dll, the main application class <code>CMyApp theApp</code>doesn't get instantiated. This means I can't use the theApp object which I really want to. I have even modified the function below so it matches that of a standard MFC dll.</p>

<pre><code>BOOL CMyApp::InitInstance()
{
   CWinApp::InitInstance();

   return TRUE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am using <code>LoadLibrary()</code> to load the exe/dll. Note, I am not exporting any c++ class from dll, just few standard C style functions. These functions internally would like to use the main application object but it is not instantiated (its constructor is never called). What do I need to do the app class is instantiated properly just like it would in a standard mfc dll?</p>

<p>** <strong>Update</strong> **</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to have the exported functions available in exe itself and I have already done that but when I load it with <code>LoadLibrary</code> the application <code>theApp</code> class doesn't get instantiated. I believe this is same behavior even if it was a dll. My projects has many dependencies and creating a new dll project and adding all files and libraries is too cumbersome. I would really like to change the project settings of the current project if any so I can have it loaded with the application class properly instantiated just like a regular MFC dll. But the question is what project settings I need to change?</p>

<p>Note: I will take out instantiating of main dialog object with <code>#define</code>. Basically the dll version of <code>InitInstance()</code> function can be as simple the one I posted above.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;div id=""fb-root""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My logout code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""/"" onclick=""FB.logout();""&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The login works perfectly and I can execute api calls no problem.  However, after I logout, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>OAuthException: Error validating access token: The session is invalid because the user logged out.  app/controllers/application_controller.rb:58: in 'fbookinvite_check'
</code></pre>

<p>Below is my fbookinvite_check code:</p>

<pre><code>  def fbookinvite_check
    unless @facebook_cookies.nil?
      @access_token = @facebook_cookies[""access_token""]
      @graph = Koala::Facebook::GraphAPI.new(@access_token)
      if !@graph.nil? == true
        @friends = @graph.get_object(""/me/friends"")
      end
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>The problem seems to be that the cookie is that the access token is invalidated, @graph is not showing as nil after the redirect.  If I refresh, then the page loads no problem, but I get the error when I log out.</p>

<p>Perhaps there's a way to catch the @graph.get_object error without shutting down the application?</p>

<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!  </p>

<p>I have an <code>ImageGenerator</code> that generates images for certain situations. Into this <code>ImageGenerator</code> I 'constructor inject' several strings (filePaths) and a <code>Translator</code> class. Right now I do this using a dependency container that instantiates the <code>ImageGenerator</code> and <code>Translator</code>. So far so good.</p>

<p>Inside the ImageGenerator I now have hardcoded <code>new Imagick(...)</code> at several places. I'm looking for a way to inject these dependencies as well, so I can switch to a different image class in the future. For this I created an abstraction using 2 classes: <code>ImagickImage</code> and <code>GDImage</code> that both implement a set of methods defined in <code>ImageInterface</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is, how do I get instances of the correct <code>ImageInterface</code> inside the <code>ImageGenerator</code>? I've come up with a few options, but neither of them feel correct.</p>

<p>Can anyone enlighten me?</p>

<hr>

<h3>Option #1, use an ImageFactory class</h3>

<p>I can inject into <code>ImageGenerator</code> an object that implements the <code>ImageFactory</code> interface. The <code>ImageFactory</code> interface has a method <code>instantiate($filePath)</code> that returns a new instance of <code>ImageInterface</code>. Problem is that I end up with a <em>lot</em> of classes and interfaces this way:</p>

<p><code>ImageInterface</code>, <code>ImagickImage</code>, <code>GDImage</code>, <code>ImageFactoryInterface</code>, <code>ImagickImageFactory</code>, <code>GDImageFactory</code>.</p>

<h3>Option #2, use a static factory method in the ImageInterface</h3>

<p>Since the factory's <code>instantiate</code> methods will be just one line, I thought I could add a static <code>instantiate</code> method to the <code>ImageInterface</code> class. Then I can just inject an instance of <code>ImageInterface</code> into the ImageGenerator and that will function as the factory to create new instances.</p>

<h3>Option #3, Inject the class name of the image</h3>

<p>I could also inject the class name of the image class (either <code>ImagickImage</code> or <code>GDImage</code>) into the <code>ImageGenerator</code> class. Then I can just create new instances based on that class name.</p>

<h3>Option #4</h3>

<p>When I drag the <strong>right bottom</strong> circle ( <em>I added jquery draggable</em>) it all looks good.
Why it looks good ? </p>

<p>becuase the code of origin-transform is : <code>top left</code></p>

I can't do <code>A = 1, B = 2, etc.</code> because 11 would be ambiguous with <code>K (11th letter)</code>. Maybe if each letter's position <code>(A = 1, B = 2, etc.)</code> was first multiplied by 10 and then you would know the next letter began at a non-zero value?</p>

<p>My program consists of multiple processes that all handle various parts, which may or may not consist of being on the local machine (e.g. down the road, I will look at spreading some of the process instances to other servers (e.g. EC2) for scaling up when needed for deeper calculations and using Celery, ZeroMQ, MQTT, or similar) and a bit further, I'll probably strap a GUI to this program with QT/wxWidgets/etc. which would run inside the Main() process.</p>

<p>The program (for this example and in trying to understand the proper implementation, let's call it ""superProgram.py"") that I'm starting off with the following processes which are each a separate function/method:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main() in superProgram.py (if <strong>name</strong> == '<strong>main</strong>': main())</p></li>
<li><p>funcTwitter() (import tweepy)</p></li>
<li><p>funcSMS() (import twilio)</p></li>
<li><p>funcRPC() (e.g. with D-Bus, Sockets, or similar)</p></li>
<li><p>funcSQLite() (import sqlite3 - yes, I'm aware that the newer version doesn't need 1 consumer and can handle multiple programs accessing it at the same time)</p></li>
<li><p>funcFile() (for the sake of simplicity, let's say that it accepts filename with 1 or 2 arguments: returns contents of file if 1 argument for the name, or 2 arguments which is name and contents of file to to write)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And additional helper functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>funcText(textRequest) (figures out what to do with raw text coming in)</p></li>
<li><p>funcWeather(zipCode) (makes requests for weather based on a zip code)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Process workflow:</p>

<p>./superProgram.py fires off main()</p>

<p>main() establishes processes as such:</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>pTwitter    =   Process( target=funcTwitter, args=() )
pTwitter.start()
pSms    =   Process( target=funcSMS, args=() )
pSms.start()
pSql    =   Process( target=funcSQLite, args=() )
pSql.start()
pFile   =   Process( target=funcFile, args=() )
pFile.start()
pRpc    =   Process( target=funcRPC, args=() )
pRpc.start()
pTwitter.join
pSms.join
pSql.join
pFile.join
pRpc.join
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>I looked at using queues such as <code>for func in iter(queueInbound.get, 'STOP'):</code> but there's no organized way that I could figure out to use which would make their request to a fellow process and send it back.  Ideally, this program would function as:</p>

<p>funcTwitter(), funcSMS(), and funcRPC() all run in their own loop waiting for data to come in or a poison pill via a queue that tells them ""STOP"", and then there's various ways to make overlapping requests via Twitter, SMS, or an RPC:</p>

<p>Twitter: @superProgram WEATHER 90210 SMS</p>

<p>SMS: WEATHER 90210 TWITTER</p>

<p>RPC: ./client.py 'WEATHER 90210 SMS'</p>

<p>funcTwitter() would call funcText() which in turn calls funcWeather() and send it back to user's SMS address after pulling their reciprocal information from SQLite.</p>

<p>funcSMS() would call funcText() which in turn calls funcWeather() and send it back to user's Twitter address after pulling their reciprocal information from SQLite.</p>

<p>funcRPC() would call funcText() which in turn calls funcWeather() and send it back to user's SMS address after pulling their reciprocal information from SQLite.</p>

<p>funcWeather(90210) asks funcFile('cache/weather/90210.txt') so that the results are cached and if it's not available then pulls it from an API (e.g. from Google/Wunderground/WeatherChannel/Accuweather), makes it's call back to funcFile('cache/weather/90210.txt', weatherString) for updating/saving the cache and returns the output: ""80ºF, overall sunny with some clouds for the rest of the week.""</p>

<p>The only code I have to go on for the time being which sort of hits at this direction is below:</p>

The issue appears to be related to the autoUpload options, since uploading in the test environment works when there is no autoUpload option set. I'm uploading with the attach_file capybara method. The method triggers the change event listener, but apparently not much else. It never hits the create action for the attachment, and when I try to trigger the submit event listener manually, the params[:attachment] in the create action is empty and the attachment can't be created.</p>

<p>The way it's set up currently is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have 3 models, a Project model, an Attachments model and an Issue model  </li>
<li>There are 2 forms on the index page for Issues - one form that deals with submitting a new attachment and another that deals with submitting new issues</li>
<li>Whenever an Attachment create action is triggered, the jquery-file-upload fills out a hidden field via javascript with data needed to add the Attachment to the relevant issue - this is done with the fileuploadcompleted callback from jquery-file-upload</li>
</ul>

<p>This way of uplading works whenever I try to upload a file manually, but fails in the test environment. I've tried adding a hidden submit button to the attachment form and when I press that button via capybara it triggers the create action but the params is once again empty. I'm running out of ideas about what to do, so if anybody had similar problems, I'd be grateful if they could help me out.</p>

<p>Here's some relevant code if that can help:</p>

Child[0] : I write my ID to the pipe.
Child[1] : I write my ID to the pipe.
Child[2] : I write my ID to the pipe.
</code></pre>

<p>I can't understand why there are 4 zeros, 2 ones and why they are mixed up.</p>

<p>Also, when I hit enter several times, I get the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parent : Child[10]'s ID is 10.</p>
  
  <p>Parent : Child[10]'s ID is 10.</p>
  
  <p>Parent : Child[10]'s ID is 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why the ID is 10, and why is it always ten?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Now I get the correct number/order of children.</p>

<pre><code>    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
    {
        pids[i] = fork();
        if (pids[i] &lt; 0)
            perror(""Fork: "");

        if (pids[i] == 0) //child
        {
            printf(""Child[%d] : I write my ID to the pipe.\n"", i);
            write(myPipe, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
            return;
        }
        else //parent
        {
            int j;
            for (j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j)
            {   
                int r = select(myPipe + 1, &amp;fdMyPipe, NULL, NULL, NULL);

                if (FD_ISSET(myPipe, &amp;fdMyPipe))
                {
                    int child;
                    read(myPipe, &amp;child, sizeof(child));
                    printf(""Parent : Child[%d]'s ID is %d.\n"", child, child);
                }
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>However, the parent still reads some random ID.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parent : Child[1426203146]'s ID is 1426203146.</p>
  
  <p>Parent : Child[1426203146]'s ID is 1426203146.</p>

<p>I finally choose to add an Authorization request for the POST request, not the GET.</p>

<p>When I try to post, I'm asked for a login and a password, I type the one matching the htpasswd file content, the Authorization header is generated and the POST works great.</p>

<p>But when I try to make a GET request without the Authorization header, I'm still asked for a login and a password. If I cancel, I get a 401 status code (Unauthorized).</p>

<p>As far as I understand, if no Authorization header is set, the ""guest"" mode is used by Apigility, and as the GET method doesn't require authentication, I shouldn't have to enter a login and a password to access my resource.</p>

I've gotten a few screens working properly, but I can't seem to get nested views working on a state with parameters.  I'd like a URL that looks like <code>/legislator/1/profile</code>.  It would have a header with the name of legislator #1 and tabs below.  The profile tab would be automatically visible and clicking on other tabs (e.g. <code>/legislator/1/votes</code>) would change the content, but not the header</p>

<p>I wound up abandoning the tabs &amp; sidemenu starter projects to customize my nested views.  Here's what I have in app.js.  The home and people.* states work correctly, but I can't seem to load the legislator screen with the profile view in place.  I've tried changing the abstract &amp; controller attributes, but no luck yet.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a <code>User</code>, with a bunch of <code>Address</code>es. User is the aggregate root, while Address only exists within the aggregate.</p>

<p>On a web inteface, a user can edit his addresses. Basically, what happens is:</p>

<ul>
<li>The user sees a list of addresses on its web interface</li>
<li>He clicks on an address, and gets redirected to this page: <code>edit-address?user=1&amp;address=2</code></li>
<li>On this page, he gets a form where he can modify this address.</li>
</ul>

<p>I we decided to bypass the aggregate root, this would be straightforward:</p>

<ul>
<li>We would directly load the <code>Address</code> with its <code>Id</code></li>
<li>We would update it, then save it</li>
</ul>

<p>Because we want to do it the DDD way, we have different solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Either we <strong>ask the User to get this Address by Id</strong>:</p>

<p><code>address = user.getAddress(id);</code><br />
<code>address.setPostCode(""12345"");</code><br />
<code>address.setCity(""New York"");</code><br />
<code>em.persist(user);</code></p>

<p>The problem with this approach is, IMO, that the aggregate root still doesn't have much more control over what's done with the address. It just returns a reference to it, so that's not much different from bypassing the aggregate.</p></li>
<li><p>Or we <strong>tell the aggregate to update an existing address</strong>:</p>

<p><code>user.updateAddress(id, ""12345"", ""New York"");</code><br />
<code>em.persist(user);</code></p>

<p>Now the aggregate has control over what's done with this address, and can take any necessary action that goes with updating an address.</p></li>
<li><p>Or we treat the Address as a <em>value object</em>, and we don't update our <code>Address</code>, but rather <strong>delete it and recreate it</strong>:</p>

<p><code>user.removeAddress(id);</code><br />
<code>address = new Address();</code><br />
<code>address.setPostCode(""12345"");</code><br />
<code>address.setCity(""New York"");</code><br />
<code>user.addAddress(address);</code><br />
<code>em.persist(user);</code></p>

<p>This last solution looks elegant, but means that an Address cannot be an Entity. Then, what if it needs to be <em>treated as an entity</em>, for example because another business object within the aggregate has a reference to it?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm pretty sure I'm missing something here to correctly understand the aggregate concept and how it's used in real life examples, so please don't hesitate to give your comments!</p>

I have a homework assignment which tells me to compare assembly language instructions to c code and tell me which c code is equivalent to the assembly instructions. So here is the assembly instructions: </p>

<pre><code>pushl %ebp // What i think is happening here is that we are creating more space for the function.
movl %esp,%ebp // Here i think we are moving the stack pointer to the old base pointer.
movl 8(%ebp),%edx // Here we are taking parameter int a and storing it in %edx
movl 12(%ebp),%eax // Here we are taking parameter int b and storing it in %eax
cmpl %eax,%edx // Here i think we are comparing int a and b ( b &gt; a ) ?
jge .L3 // Jump to .L3 if b is greater than a - else continue the instructions
movl %edx,%eax // If the term is not met here it will return b
.L3:
movl %ebp,%esp // Starting to finish the function
popl %ebp // Putting the base pointer in the right place
ret // return
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to comment it out based on my understanding of this - but I might be totally wrong about this. The options for C functions which one of are suppose to be equivalent to are: </p>

<pre><code>int fun1(int a, int b)
{
unsigned ua = (unsigned) a;
if (ua &lt; b)
return b;
else
return ua;
}
int fun2(int a, int b)
{
if (b &lt; a)
return b;
else
return a;
}
int fun3(int a, int b)
{
if (a &lt; b)
return a;
else
return b;
}

<p>I think the correct answer is fun3 .. but I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p>As an example, the player table consists of the columns (playerID, teamID, cityID, and stateID). stadium table has (statiumID, teamID, cityID, and stateID).

<p>Here's what I've done so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generated an output per 100 Monte-Carlo Steps (MCS) of the python-based simulation that specifies what the cellular lattice looks like by giving the cellular identity (cell-id[400 cells in total] and cell-type[either 1 or 2]) for each x- and y-coordinate. I have about 1000 of these files (columns with cell_id, cell_type, x-coordinate and y-coordinate, and 10.000 rows) one per 100 MCS, all files located in the same map. </p></li>
<li><p>Generated an R script that specifically calculates the length of the boundary between cell type 1 and 2 for one output file. The output of the script is simply one number: the value of boundary for that specific file/timepoint, called CellBoundary. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>What I want to do now:
The R script only works for one single file. However, as I am simulating up to 100.000 MCS, I have as much as 1000 files. I would like to plot the output of the R script against time. So, I would want to generate some kind of code that could simply make R find these 1000 files, run them one after the other automatically and then store the output in a new csv file which would only have two columns: MCS and boundary length. </p>

<p>What I tried so far:
I am pretty new to all of this, so I am a bit stuck. However, I looked into bash scripting and standard input. 
So, would it be possible if I compress my 1000 files into one Zip-file and use this as a standard input for R, then generating the 1000 data values that I need so that I can simply plot this? 
By doing executing something like: ""cat compressed_files | boundarycalculation.R""? I already tried this with some easier examples (with input file ""a b c d"" and an R-script saying ""print lines"") but then it says:
cat input | test.R
cat: input: No such file or directory
So, is this the right way of doing this after all, or should I look for something totally different? </p>

<p>Btw these are parts of my R script in case that might be of any use (where I thus would want the PIF file to be a different one each time I run the script):</p>

<pre><code># read file to a data frame
pixelDf &lt;- read.delim(""mcs_000000.pif"", header = FALSE) 
# remove columns with only example values 
pixelDf &lt;- pixelDf[, -(7:14)] 
# convert data frame to data table 
pixelDt &lt;- data.table(pixelDf)
# set column names
setnames(pixelDt, c(""cell_id"", ""cell_type"", ""x"", ""y""))

.....

# index horizEdgeDt with the key of vertEdgeDt (cell_id) to get both columns
# in one place, and add up the edges
cellDt &lt;- horizEdgeDt[vertEdgeDt,.(cell_type,perimeter = numHorizEdges + numVertEdges)]

cellBoundary &lt;- cellDt$boundary[cellDt$cell_type==""1""]
cellBoundary
</code></pre>

<p>And in the end I thus would want to generate a csv file with cellBoundary for each MCS. So I guess adding something like an append function to my R script would also be good. So if anyone would have any ideas on this that would help me further, I'd be very grateful! Thanks in advance. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so, now I tried to do this in R only by adding:</p>

<pre><code>fileNames &lt;- Sys.glob(""*.pif"")

for (fileName in fileNames) {
</code></pre>

<p>before my script</p>

<p>and changing</p>

<pre><code># read file to a data frame
pixelDf &lt;- read.delim(""mcs_000000.pif"", header = FALSE) 
</code></pre>

<p>into</p>

<pre><code>pixelDf &lt;- read.delim(""fileName"", header = FALSE) 
</code></pre>

<p>and adding </p>

<pre><code>write.csv(outputTable, ""Output.csv"", append = TRUE, row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE) }
</code></pre>

<p>at the end of the script as to generate a new csv with each row based on the output from one file.
However, this gives the error:</p>

<pre><code>There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50)
&gt; warnings()
Warning messages:
1: In write.csv(outputTable, ""Output.csv"", append = TRUE,  ... :

<p>How would keys with a common ""getPartition"" output end up at different reducers?</p>

<p>I have attached code for the custom intermediary key and partitioner. Note: I know exactly 1/2 of the keys have the ""useBothGUIDFlag"" set to true and 1/2 have this set to false (which is why I partition these keys to separate halves of the partition space). I also know that keys do not seem to cross over into the other half of the partition (i.e., ""useBothGUIDFlag"" keys do not end up in the ""!useBothGUIDFlag"" partitions and vice versa), rather they are mixed up within their half of the partitions.</p>

<p>Step one is to make the search term only match at the beginning of suggested terms.  I've already got that working, as you can see in the code below.  Step two is to have the first suggestion <em>actually autocomplete</em>.</p>

<p>Which probably requires a bit of explanation.  When I hear ""autocomplete"", I envision typing ""f"" and having the contents of the text field change to ""foo"", with the ""oo"" selected, so that it is replaced if I type another character and left in the field if I tab out of it.  I'd normally call what the Autocomplete widget does suggesting, rather than autocompleting.</p>

<p>Looking at how Autocomplete works internally, I think the <code>autocompleteopen</code> event is the correct place to do this (it's called every time the list of suggestions is updated), but I'm at a loss as to how to access the suggestion list from there.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<pre><code>$(""#field"").autocomplete({
    delay: 0,

    source: function filter_realms(request, response) {
        var term = request.term.toLowerCase();
        var length = term.length;

        response($.grep(candidates, function(candidate) {
            return candidate.substring(0, length).toLowerCase() === term;
        }));
    },

    open: function(event, ui) {
        // magic happens here?
    }
});

<p>Upon loading a view in xcode, I call the <code>PHP-script</code> to create the JSON file, then I read the <code>JSON</code> in my <code>xcode</code> and put the data in a <code>TableView</code>.</p>

<p>I also use an option in the view, called ''delete''. People can delete the selected value from the <code>tableview</code>. Upon deleting I run another PHP-script to delete the selected value from the database. Then I call the PHP-script to create a new <code>JSON</code>-file with the new values (old values without the deleted one), and then I read again the <code>JSON</code> file with the new values.</p>

<p>Is this the best way to retrieve changed data from the database? </p>

<p>In my opinion there should be a better option to get/updated changed data from the database in a view in xcode.</p>

<p>Can someone give me some tips?</p>

<p>Sometimes the server is a bit lagging, and then the view isn't able to load the <code>JSON</code>, because the PHP-script couldn't be executed, so the TableView stays empty.</p>

<p>So I use: <code>PHP -&gt; Database(MYSQL) -&gt; JSON -&gt; Load in xcode</code></p>

<p>Now, later on, the C++ program loads the python2.7 library and launches python inside itself. It then imports this wrapper python library.</p>

<p>This means this PyNodeType appears in the C++ program and also inside the python instance running inside the c++ program. At some point, these two things are compared and the program blows up! :S</p>

<p>Not really sure how to get around this one as the definition is needed in both places.</p>

<p>Further inspection reveals that, while the type is somehow deduced, one of these parameters is full of null pointers</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) print v
$4 = (PyObject *) 0x7fffcc433ec0 &lt;UTOPIA::PyNodeType&gt;
(gdb) print *v
$5 = {_ob_next = 0x0, _ob_prev = 0x0, ob_refcnt = 2, ob_type = 0x0}
(gdb) print *w
$6 = {_ob_next = 0x7fffd80b3310, _ob_prev = 0x7fffe00aca70, ob_refcnt = 43, ob_type = 0x7fffc3efc0c0 &lt;PyType_Type&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>***UPDATE***</strong></p>

<p>So When I create an object I take a look at the memory locations</p>

<pre><code>PyNode* newPyNode = PyObject_New(PyNode, &amp;PyNodeType);
(gdb) print &amp;PyNodeType
$4 = (PyTypeObject *) 0x7fffe353cea0 &lt;UTOPIA::PyNodeType&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But then, if I look at the ob_type field in my newPyNode object</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) print *newPyNode
$7 = {_ob_next = 0x7fffe12fd1c8, _ob_prev = 0x7fffe32024e0 &lt;refchain&gt;, ob_refcnt = 1, ob_type = 0x7fffe2a10ec0 &lt;UTOPIA::PyNodeType&gt;, node = 0xef2cc0}
</code></pre>

<p>ob_type does not match. What gives? Looking at the comparison functions like </p>

<pre><code>PyObject_TypeCheck
</code></pre>

<p>... these memory locations should be the same.</p>

<p>1) ""#"" &amp; ""##"" operation</p>

<p>with ${var#pattern}, we remove ""pattern"" in the head of ${var}. ""*"" could be used in the pattern to match everything. And the difference between ""#"" and ""##"" is that, ""##"" will remove the longest match substring while ""#"" removes the shortest. For example,</p>

<pre><code>var=brbread
${var##*br} // ead
${var#*br} // bread
</code></pre>

<p>2) ""%"" &amp; ""%%"" operation</p>

<p>with ${var%pattern}, we remove ""pattern"" at the end of ${var}. Of course, ""%%"" indicates longest match while ""%"" means the shortest. For example, </p>

<pre><code>var=eadbreadbread
${var%%*br} // eadbreadbread
${var%%br*} // ead
${var%br*} // eadbread
</code></pre>

<p>3) ""/"" operation</p>

<p>with ${var/haha/heihei}, we replace ""haha"" in $var with ""heihei"". For example, </p>

<pre><code>var=ihahai
${var/haha/heihei/} / iheiheii

<pre><code>[Serializable]
class SerializableClass
{
    [NonSerialized]    
    private readonly object someLock = new object();

    [OnDeserializing]
    private void restore(StreamingContext sc) 
    {
        // cannot one-time-access readonly fields (like in a 
        // constructor or shortcut like above), too sad...

        // someLock = new object();
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I came across this problem having some objects for locking (that are exclusively used for locking) that are always <code>private readonly</code> (and which I think don't have a place in the serialized representation). As a workaround I am asking myself:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should these objects better not be read-only, so that they can be restored?</li>
<li>Should I instead include them to be serialized (as long these are only some 'empty objects' anyway)?</li>
</ul>

<p>But there might be a more general solution for the use of read-only fields, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a way of implementing a deserializing constructor that gets called (like when implementing <code>ISerializable</code>) without loosing the automatic serialization of the fields?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering if you have to always use an .m file together with an .h file because i'm guessing the could would be something like this in Obejctive-C:</p>

<pre><code>@interface IMessage : NSObject
typedef enum {

//all the same

} MessageID;

NSString *encodeAttributes();
-(void) decodeAttributes(NSString data);
</code></pre>

<p>or would I have to split it up more into two files? because i'm guessing that you have to have both an .m/.h file?</p>

<p>I am considering a workaround where i just keep the p12-files beneath my application without using the stores, which would be a much more unclean solution i guess. But I am just unable to add both, the Certificate and the KeyPair to the Store.</p>

<p>I have a pixel shader which uses multiple textures/samplers :</p>

<pre><code>texture MountainTexture;
texture GrassTexture;
texture IceTexture;
texture SandTexture;
sampler moutain = sampler_state {
   texture = (MountainTexture);
   MinFilter = Linear;
   MagFilter = Linear;
   MipFilter = Linear;
   AddressU = Wrap;
   AddressV = Wrap;
};
sampler ice = sampler_state {
   texture = (IceTexture);
   ...
};
sampler grass = sampler_state {
   texture = (GrassTexture);
   ...
};
sampler sand = sampler_state {
   texture = (SandTexture);
   ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>The pixel shader function uses one or two of these samplers for each pixel rendered. I noticed that, when I let the shader use only one of these samplers for every pixel, the framerate is improved with a ~ x2 factor.</p>

<p>So I was wondering :
- what exactly does the GPU when I use tex2D on multiple samplers in the same shader ? Why is it that slow ?
- What is the difference between passing textures with <code>Shader.Parameters[""myTexture""].SetValue(myTexture)</code> and <code>GraphicsDevices.Texture[10] = myTexture</code> ?</p>

<p>Is there a way to improve performance when using a shader with multiple samplers ? (my textures are too big to put them all in a single texture).</p>

<p>Thank you very much !</p>

<p>I am trying to implement a project for work that automatically updates a 3rd party website used to track inventory.  I have figured out how to call the client side javascript function associated with adjusting the inventory but to my current demise this function asks for user input to do a simple calculation and validation on the data before processing it.  I need the system automated so if anyone has any ideas that a novice programmer like me could implement easily that would be great.  </p>

<p>Even a sloppy solution like sendKeys to the current active handle would work for my needs at the moment.  Thanks in advance for your time and consideration!</p>

<p>Best regards,
Ben </p>

<p>The Java Script Function is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function stockValMod(fieldID, doAdd){
var txtField = document.getElementById(fieldID);
if(isNumeric(txtField.value)){
if(doAdd){
var addNum = prompt('Enter the amount you wish to add', 0);
if(!isNumeric(addNum)) alert('You did not enter a valid number');
}else{
var addNum = prompt('Enter the amount you wish to subtract', 0);
if(!isNumeric(addNum)){
alert('You did not enter a valid number');
}else{
addNum = (-1 * addNum);
}
}
if(isNumeric(addNum)){
txtField.value = parseInt(txtField.value) + parseInt(addNum);
txtField.style.backgroundColor = 'lightblue';
document.getElementById('saveButtonTD').style.display = '';
}
}else{
alert('The current value is not a valid number');
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now my code in vs is very short up to this point all I have found out how to do is to call this java function from my c# code with the following couple of lines of code...</p>

<pre><code>int numToSubtract = 10;
object[] args = { ""part_182"", 1 };
object[] args2 = { ""part_182"", 10 };
webBrowser1.Document.InvokeScript(""stockValMod"",args);
</code></pre>

<p>This calls the function great but results in a pop-up window from the call from javascript prompt.... I cannot seem to find out how to input data into that textfield from my program.  </p>

<p>UPDATE.....</p>

<p>So I found that I can use:</p>

<pre><code>webBrowser1.Document.Window.Prompt(""haha"", ""1"");
</code></pre>

<p>to get the exact same prompt as what java triggers in my webbrowser.  If I could intercept the request from java and dump it into calling my prompt, I could set default and send an enter keystroke so as to hack this... but how to intercept the java request of my browser for a prompt?? hmmmm.....</p>

<p>HI ALL .... UPDATE....</p>

<p>Turns out after hours of searching and fretting... I was just one line of code away from accomplishing what I needed to do.</p>

<pre><code>foreach (HtmlElement form in webBrowser1.Document.Forms)form.InvokeMember(""submit"");
</code></pre>

<p>This updated the server without flaw!  Thanks for all the help though! :D</p>

Probably i clicked it with right mouse button and pressed Ctrl, at least such relationships appears now if i do this action. Now i plan next release and i wanted to do lightweight migration. I created new model version, but when i added a field to an entity (not that with self-relationship) XCode crashed. And any modification of datamodel also crashes XCode. I found that relationship and couldn't delete it as well. So i can't do even this simplest migration. Migration with mapping crashes XCode too. Basically i have no idea how i can run upgrade process at all. I can't create new model version and when i tried to restore model from Git (i found quite an old version w/o that damned relationship) it obviously wasn't recognized by Core Data migration procedures as an appropriate version since it has no relationship.
Can anybody give me advice what to do in this situation? Is there a workaround like editing of model manually bypassing XCode?
Asking users to remove old version before installing a new one seems to be a very bad option.
P.S. I tried XCode 3.2. It also crashed.</p>

  var fromunderbutter = ""fun""; 
  global.BigObject = function( options ){

&gt;&gt;&gt; true  // BigObject was the object context ( this ) that invoked BigObject()
</code></pre>

<p>From what i understand, <code>this</code> refers to the current object context. In the above example because of the new keyword, <code>this</code> will refer to a blank object which will be newly created and applied to the function invocation. </p>

<p>But this next part doesn't make sense to me:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; BigObject()
&gt;&gt;&gt; undefined  
&gt;&gt;&gt; false

<p>Why is <code>this</code> undefined? I assumed that <code>this</code> would refer to something -- probably global object window. Not sure how to think about this result.</p>

I've got n child elements in one div element which should share the whole space with all the same ratio. This is working without problems due to the new introduced flex-boxes. But I also had to set the height of each inner div to 0. If I want to stretch an element inside this div to 100% height it uses the given value of 0 instead of any computed value. As I've chosen flex-boxes in order to prevent using javascript I would prefer remaining that way. Is there any other way to make the image's height filling the div?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Let's take any decent SQL engine as an example. You can create a table and you can select the collation for the table. In our case, <code>XXÈ</code> and <code>XXE</code> will be stored in the table, they will have different binary representations (depending on the encoding), but when you search for <code>XXE</code>, it will match also <code>XXÈ</code>.</p>

<p>My case is pretty much similar. I have a text file with some strings in it (UTF8). I want to display the values on screen (sorted - where the collation is again, relatively important) and I want to let the user search for values. The collation used for search will be an option. </p>

<p>The above code tries to allocate around 10GB of memory using malloc. The first two machines I tried this code on run on linux kernel 2.6 and the last one runs linux kernel 2.4. Here are the behaviors I see on these machines:</p>

<p>Machine1: the memory is allocated using memory overcommit, but when assigning values to the memory locations in the while loop, it only allocates as much as RSS allows. Thus OOM Killer kills the process when i=3800 is printed which is around 4GB of memory this machine has.</p>

<p>Machine2: memory is allocated using memory overcommit and the while loop goes on forever, allocating pages from virtual memory. The process goes a bit slower after i = 3800 is printed which is normal.</p>

<p>machine3: this machines has only 2GB of memory. The memory cannot even be allocated. Seems like the over commit is not set or kernel 2.4 does not support allocating virtual machine pages using malloc! Thus in the first for loop it exits while allocating memory for i = 2138</p>

<p>My desired action is the one happening in machine2. Does anyone know which (kernel?) options has to be set to allow OS to allocate virtual memory pages using malloc and start paging while the required memory exceeds RSS?</p>

<p>As we all know, when coding with windows we normally get windows-style colors/buttons/lists etc. They just look and feel ugly.</p>

<p>When we decide we want to sell an application, people want it to look good - obviously because they have paid for it.</p>

<p>So the question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>How is the good application look achieved today? </li>
<li>Owner drawing? ( really?? )</li>
<li>custom-controls ?</li>
<li>some good non-free libraries that do the 'dirty' work and 'skin' your application?</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't believe programmers do those 'overdrawn' tips and tricks, it takes so long to have one control completely done.. Besides, i would rather spend that time coding the internal application stuff than playing around with per-control drawing..</p>

<p>I have no clue, but have a deadline and now after going through all those 'ownerdrawed' controls on google - i came up that this is not the thing.. There has to be something else that comes handy when a programmer needs to make his application look top-end!.</p>

<p>Please help, any tools ? any tips ? any-anything.. ?</p>

<p>Few examples, how do they achieve that look:</p>

The idea I had and implemented would be to take continuous screen shots and store them on disc and then after the <code>UIView</code> is done combine all the images to make a movie. Right now I'm using <code>UIImage</code> to combine and make a movie. This seems like a pretty slow process and I've read some things online, like RecordMyScreen project, but that uses private APIs like IOSurface and so on. I'm just wondering if theres a quick way to take screen shots. I would require to take about 25 a second. Right now I'm doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(self.captureView.frame.size, YES, 0.0);
// CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
// [self.captureView.layer renderInContext:context];
[self.captureView drawViewHierarchyInRect:weakSelf.captureView.bounds afterScreenUpdates:YES];
UIImage* screenShot = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
NSLog(@""saving image"");
[self saveImageToFolder:self.tempFolderPath image:screenShot];
</code></pre>

<p>this is in an <code>NSOperationBlock</code> to be performed in the background. Saving to disc is also done on another thread.</p>

<p>I know that <code>AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor</code> takes <code>CVPixelBufferRef</code> to create the movie so I'm not sure if theres a way to get that directly from the <code>UIView</code>? </p>

<p>Anyway any help would be great!</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

I want to add functionality for when the mouse rolls over tiles or objects (highlighting, pop-ups and the like).</p>

<p>Both the objects and tiles will have complicated shapes, and I'm looking for the best way to mark when the mouse passes over them, especially since top-most objects should take precedence over background objects.</p>

<p>Currently, the tiles and objects are rendered by the <code>Graphics.drawImage</code> function on a canvas after being loaded as buffered images, for every frame. </p>

<p>I keep seeing <code>mouseEvent.getSource</code> on the alternate explanations, but it seems to require creating graphics objects for every highlightable object. I'm concerned this may be inefficient when hundreds of objects and tiles are on the screen that can be potentially selected.</p>

<p>Specifically, my questions are these: </p>

<p>Is creating hundreds, if not thousands, of graphics objects per frame a bad way to use the getSource function?</p>

<p>Is there a better way to determine which instance of a class is being selected, given mouse coordinates? Such as a separate array of all pixels and the object/tile ID to which they belong (I estimated the size to be close to 3 MB, with constant updating as the screen moves around)?</p>

So what sort of special functionalities does a camera need, to be able to capture images while traveling at varying speeds ? for example how high a frame rate is required, and the exposure duration, shutter speed? Do you think that webcams(even if high end) will be able to achieve it ? The project requires the camera to be programmable in C# ...

<p>Sample Code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$host='localhost'; // Host name
$username='root'; // Mysql username
$password=''; // Mysql password
$db_name='test'; // Database name
$connect=@mysql_connect($host,$username,$password) or die(""Cannot Connect to database"");
@mysql_select_db($db_name,$connect) or die (""Cannot find database"");

<p>app Code: </p>

<pre><code> $sql=""SELECT * FROM test.userdet WHERE emailId='$uName' and pwd='$pwd'"";
 $result=mysql_query($sql);
 $count=mysql_num_rows($result);
</code></pre>

<p>according to $count i am redirecting it to other page. </p>

<p>I able to run it on other systems which has XAMPP itself, but its not running with mysql community server.</p>

<p>//Thanks to NullPointer, i got it by PDO, from now onwords i will continue with PDO for transactions. </p>

<p>Now i facing a new problem, i am calling a php_db script via ajax, after executing all PDO statements its not returning to ajax, Code snippet is below:</p>

<p><strong>ajax call:-</strong></p>

<pre><code>  $.ajax({
      type: ""POST"",
      url: ""common/dbPhpScripts/updateEvent.php"",
      data: 'json=' + det,
      dataType: 'json',
      cache: false,
      success: function () {
          $('#cal').fullCalendar('refetchEvents');
          $('#edit_event').dialog('close');
      }
  });
</code></pre>

<p><strong>sample php code after using PDO:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$stringData = $_POST['json'];
$mynewarray = json_decode($stringData, true);
$title=$mynewarray['title'];
$start= $mynewarray['start'];
$end= $mynewarray['end'];
$createDate=$mynewarray['createDate'];
$insertQuery=$db-&gt;exec(""INSERT INTO calendar (User_Id, StartDateTime, EndDateTime, Event_Title, Create_Date) VALUES ('07','$start','$end','$title','$createDate')"");

<p>where i am going wrong?</p>

"6333960","1","6334071","","2011-06-13 17:31:58","","0","689","<p>I have a PHP image upload system which allows a user to upload various images (JPG, GIF, PNG). Every image which is uploaded has an icon (20x20), thumbnail (150x150) and a postcard (500x500) generated for it--I call these ""meta images"". If the original image dimensions are not square like the meta image, it is scaled to best fit and a transparent canvas is generated at the proper size with the meta image laid onto it. Because of this transparent canvasing, and for other purposes, all generated meta images are themselves PNGs (regardless of original image format).</p>

<p>For example, if a user uploads a 800px by 600px JPG image, the following ends up in the filesystem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Original *.jpg at 800 x 600</li>
<li>Meta icon *.png with 20 x 15 copy of original image centered horizontally and vertically on 20 x 20 tansparent canvas</li>
<li>Meta thumbail *.png with 150 x 112 copy of original image centered horizontally and vertically on 150 x 150 tansparent canvas</li>
<li>Meta icon *.png with 500 x 375 copy of original image centered horizontally and vertically on 500 x 500 tansparent canvas</li>
</ol>

<p>This works perfectly for JPG and GIF files--all colors are handled properly, sizes work, etc, etc, etc.</p>

<p>However, if I upload a PNG which has any black in it (rgb(0,0,0), #000000), the resulting 3 meta images have all black converted to transparent. Everything else is fine--dimensions, etc. And remember, transparent GIFs seem to work fine, even if there is black within.</p>

<p>Can someone please explain to me how I can fix this?  Below is the code I wrote for this system <em>(note there are 3 extensions of the abstract class defined beneath it)</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
/*
 * TODO: There is no reason for this class to be abstract except that I have not
 *       added any of the setters/getters/etc which would make it useful on its
 *       own.  As is, an instantiation of this class would not accomplish
 *       anything so I have made it abstract to avoid instantiation.  Three
 *       simple and usable extensions of this class exist below it in this file.

<p>The code I use to run it is:</p>

<p>The main issues seem to be in the <code>createTarget()</code> and <code>fitToMaxDimensions()</code> methods. In <code>createTarget()</code>, if I comment out the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>$aTransparentTypes = Array( 'gif', 'png', 'x-png' );
if( in_array( $this-&gt;sSourceExt, $aTransparentTypes ) )
{
  $oTransparentColor = imagecolorallocate( $this-&gt;oTargetImage, 0, 0, 0 );
  imagecolortransparent( $this-&gt;oTargetImage, $oTransparentColor);
  imagealphablending( $this-&gt;oTargetImage, false );
}
</code></pre>

<p>I no longer lose my black, but all existing transparency becomes black.</p>

<p>I assume the issue is that I am using black as the transparency channel. But how do I avoid using a color which is in the image as the transparency channel?</p>

<p>Thanks to anyone who can help me understand the mysteries behind transparency!</p>

<p>Clicking the anchor tag fires a Webmethod that populates the results div with a list of items (in this case ""Owners""). The items in the div all have a javascript onclick attribute that then fills the HiddenField and and text box. </p>

<p>This pattern is used all over the place on the site, but the code implementing it is currently written separately for each instance of the pattern.</p>

<p>I want to generalize this pattern into an ASP.Net Custom User Control.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly the table shown above may contain many rows, each containing different controls. </p>

<p>I know that I can create a User Control just containing Table Cells and drop that control within the  tags in the table. This works fine, but my problem stems from the Results Div. </p>

<p>Where can I put it in my User Control where it will not affect my table?</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to insert it after the parent table of the UserControl, but as far as I can tell a User Control cannot edit the Control Collection of the page in which it resides. I could leave the Results Div in an extra table cell and then use jQuery to move the HTML to where I want it on page load, but this seems to be a little inelegant. </p>

<p>Has anyone any suggestions on how how to implement this?</p>

<p>Now the issue I am having is that the animation between the two UIViews is quite ugly, its not very smooth you can see the two different views on the animation etc which is undesirable.. I was wondering if anyone could think of a nice way to crossfade between the two making it look abit smoother etc...</p>

<p>any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>So I have just tried to  create a CATransaction, however I have an error on one line giving me this error <strong>No visible @interface for 'UIView' declares the selector 'jumpBarContainerPortrait'</strong>  I have added a comment to the line where I get this error below.. any help would be appreciated</p>

            animation.duration = 3.50;

            [self.view insertSubview:jumpBarContainerPortrait belowSubview:actionTabBar];

            [[self.view jumpBarContainerPortrait] addAnimation:animation forKey:@""Fade""]; // Error is happening here!

<p>My app allows users to build up a stageplay; so I have a table view of <code>acts</code>. Each act can have a list of <code>lines</code> so the acts table view drives a second table view of lines (so selecting act one updates the lines table view with the lines of that act).</p>

<p>This setup seems to be working fine.</p>

<p>Each line is of course spoken by a character, so my document object has a list of <code>characters</code> as well as a list of acts. What I want is a pop-up cell in my lines table with values taken from the <code>characters</code> array.</p>

<p>So I followed the steps in that Apple tutorial but it doesn't work...</p>

<ul>
<li>If I bind the <code>content</code> of the table view column to the <code>CharactersController.arrangedObjects</code> and the <code>selectedObject</code> to <code>LinesController.arrangedObjects.character</code> then the binding works (when I select a value from the pop-up it updates the underlying <code>line</code> object with the new character), <strong>but</strong> the list shows <code>&lt;Character ...&gt;</code> entries</li>
<li><p>If I then bind the column's <code>contentValues</code> to <code>CharactersController.arrangedObjects.name</code> then I get the following debug error when I run the app:</p>

<li><p>If I remove the <code>selectedObject</code> binding then I still get the <code>&lt;Character...&gt;</code> output in the list.</p></li>

I have defined the structure of a class in a header file:</p>

<pre>

    #include ""nav_msgs/Odometry.h""
    #include ""geometry_msgs/Pose.h""
    #include ""geometry_msgs/Point.h""

    public:
        stage_listener();

    private:
        std::list odom_list;

        std::list polar2cart(std::vector, float, float, float, float);

        void nodes2text(std::vector, std::vector);
        int numOdom();
        int numScan();
    };  

</pre>

<p>In the associated .cpp file, I wrote a main:</p>

<pre>

    int main(int argc, char **argv){
            char buffer [1024];
            while(1){
                int i = fscanf(stdin,""%s"",buffer);

                if(strcmp(""exit"",buffer) == 0)
                    exit(0);

                else if(strcmp(""num_nodes"",buffer) == 0){
                    ROS_INFO(""Odometry nodes: %i\nScan nodes: %i"",numOdom(),numScan());
                }

                else{}
            }

    }

</pre> 

<p>The ROS_INFO function is part of Willow Garage's ROS and you can intend it like a normal printf, taking exactly arguments in the same form.
On compiling code, I get the following:</p>

So...</p>

<pre><code>Public Function BronzeSilverGold() As String
    Dim bronzeFlag As Integer = 0
    Dim silverFlag As Integer = 0
    Dim goldFlag As Integer = 0
    Dim numPledges As Integer = Report.Parameters!PledgeValues.Count()

        ElseIf Report.Parameters!PledgeValues.Value(index) = 2 Then
        bronzeFlag += 1
            silverFlag += 1
        ElseIf Report.Parameters!PledgeValues.Value(index) = 3 Then
            bronzeFlag += 1
            silverFlag  += 1
            goldFlag += 1

        Return ""Silver""
    ElseIf bronzeFlag = numPledges Then
        Return ""Bronze""
    End If
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>The bit that's vexing me is that when I run the report the cell just returns #Error. The problem seems to specifically be the ""Report.Parameters!PledgeValues.Value(index)"". If I run this:</p>

<pre><code>Public Function BronzeSilverGold() As String
    Dim bronzeFlag As Integer = 0
    Dim numPledges As Integer = Report.Parameters!PledgeValues.Count()
    Dim index as Integer = 0

    For index = 1 To numPledges
        If (Report.Parameters!PledgeValues.Value(1) = 2) Then
            bronzeFlag += 1
        End If
    Next index

    return bronzeFlag

End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Then it successfully returns the value 8 (since the first value in the parameter is a 2). If I change line 7 from Report.Parameters!PledgeValues.Value(1) to Report.Parameters!PledgeValues.Value(index) the cell in the report returns #Error</p>

<p>No idea what I'm doing wrong - if anyone has any idea's they'd be much appreciated.</p>

<p>The problem is that all three solutions need to access data from the same database.  Each component has its own set of views, functions and sprocs but the schema differs in places (one component may require a field that another component doesn't).</p>

<p>Basically, I don't want to have one solution break because of a change that I've made in another one.</p>

<p>The way I see it I have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new project that is referenced in all solutions that purely contains database scripts</li>
<li>Manage the Schema in the main application solution and the views, functions and sprocs in the other solutions (as appropriate) and be very, very careful when I do a build</li>
</ul>

And I need such method -- passing element to find in the set, and set returning element from its collection (when found). </p>

<p><em>Sidenote -- ""why do you need element from the set, you already have <strong>that</strong> element?"". No, I don't, equality and identity are two different things.</em></p>

<p><code>HashSet</code> is not sealed but all its fields are private, so deriving from it is pointless. I cannot use <code>Dictionary</code> instead because I need <code>SetEquals</code> method. I was thinking about grabbing a source for <code>HashSet</code> and adding desired method, but the license is not truly open source (I can look, but I cannot distribute/modify). I could use reflection but the arrays in <code>HashSet</code> are not <code>readonly</code> meaning I cannot bind to those fields once per instance lifetime.</p>

<p>And I don't want to use full blown library for just single class.</p>

<p>So far I am stuck with LINQ <code>SingleOrDefault</code>. So the question is how fix this -- have <code>HashSet</code> with <code>TryGetValue</code>?</p>

"12467315","1","","","2012-09-17 21:25:05","","0","131","<p>Alright, so my app has data migration. I originally went with standard migration, using mapping, but with large amounts of data that isn't recommended, as it uses up a lot of memory and the app quits to the home screen.</p>

<p>So it has the standard ManagedObjectContext, ManagedObjectModel and PersistentStoreCoordinator methods - with no iCloud or migration extras. Except from my ManagedObjectContext has this addition near the beginning:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSManagedObjectContext *)managedObjectContext {

    if (managedObjectContext != nil) {
        return managedObjectContext;
    }

    [self prepareForMigrationIfRequired];

    ...
</code></pre>

<p>This method checks if migration is required by first trying this:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *sourceStorePath = [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory] stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""CoreDataStore.sqlite""];
NSString *backupSourceStorePath = [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory]
                                   stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""CoreDataStoreBackup.sqlite""];

BOOL required;

if ([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:backupSourceStorePath]) {
    required = YES;
}

else if (![[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:sourceStorePath]) {

    // Database doesn't yet exist. No need to test data compatibility
    required = NO;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then through <code>else</code>, checking if the data is compatible with the current model. If it isn't, it marks it as required.</p>

<p>If it is required, it does this:</p>

<pre><code>    if (required) {
        self.migrationRequired = YES;

        NSString *sourceStorePath = [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory]
                                     stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""CoreDataStore.sqlite""];
        NSString *backupSourceStorePath = [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory]
                                           stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""CoreDataStoreBackup.sqlite""];

        NSError *error;
        if (![[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:backupSourceStorePath]) {
            [[NSFileManager defaultManager] moveItemAtPath:sourceStorePath
                                                    toPath:backupSourceStorePath
                                                     error:&amp;error];

            if (error) {
                NSLog(@""Error: %@"", error);
                return;
            }
        }

        if ([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:sourceStorePath]) {
            [[NSFileManager defaultManager] removeItemAtPath:sourceStorePath error:&amp;error];

            if (error) {
                NSLog(@""Error: %@"", error);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It basically moves the data store to the backup so that it'll then go on to make a new, empty, datastore.</p>

<p>In <code>- (BOOL)application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> I call <code>[self managedObjectContext];</code> to run all of this code, and then I call <code>[self migrationIfRequired]</code>.</p>

<p><code>-(void)migrationIfRequired</code> checks if self.migrationRequired is set to YES, and if it is, it's intent is to move all the objects from the old data store over to the new data store. After that's done, it ends like so:</p>

<pre><code>NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];

        if ([fileManager fileExistsAtPath:backupSourceStorePath] &amp;&amp; [fileManager fileExistsAtPath:storePath]) {
            [fileManager removeItemAtPath:backupSourceStorePath error:&amp;error];
        }

        if (error) {
            NSLog(@""Error: %@"", error);
            return;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Removing the backup store, to go forward with just the new data.</p>

<p>This is the part which i'm having trouble with. My problems i've had are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really slow to save</li>
<li>Running out of memory</li>
</ul>

<p>So I want to go through it with people on here step by step, to try and get this working.</p>

<p>In my 1.0 version, which i'm upgrading from, I have an <code>Entry</code> entity, which has a one-to-many relationship with a <code>Media</code> entity. The <code>Media</code> entity contains an attribute called <code>originalImage</code>, which in the 1.1 version (which i'm upgrading to) is now it's own entity called <code>MediaImageData</code>, and has an attribute called <code>data</code>, which <code>originalImage</code> is placed into.</p>

<p>Other than that, changes are just getting rid of a few attributes and adding a few new optional ones.</p>

<p>So, here's some code to start off the <code>-(void)migrationIfRequired</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>if (self.migrationRequired) {

    NSString *storePath = [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory] stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""CoreDataStore.sqlite""];
    NSString *backupSourceStorePath = [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory]
                                       stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""CoreDataStoreBackup.sqlite""];

    NSManagedObjectContext *backupContext = [self version1ManagedObjectContext];

    NSFetchRequest *entryRequest = [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityName:@""Entry""];
    [entryRequest setFetchBatchSize:10];

    NSError *error;
    NSArray *entries = [backupContext executeFetchRequest:entryRequest error:&amp;error];

    int i = 0;

    for (NSManagedObject *entry in entries) {


        Entry *newEntry = [NSEntityDescription

<p>So my first problem is that each time it saves here, having only added new entities, it takes 29 seconds. If I have a core data store with potentially hundreds of entities, we have a case of waiting literally hours for it just to save. How can I make it save faster?</p>

<p>I have a page in Yii into which I'm trying to embed an AJAX form. Let's call the page A. The form takes in a single value, and needs to validate and store it into the DB if it's alright. </p>

<p>So far, here's what I've figured out:</p>

<p>The form is in a view _form.php, which contains a CActiveForm and an ajaxSubmitButton which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo CHtml::ajaxSubmitButton('submit', $this-&gt;createUrl('/site/something'), array('update'=&gt;'#targetdiv'));?&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>The form is called within another A's view like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;renderPartial('/site/_form', array('AModel'=&gt;$model)); //Passing some info about A ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the controller's actionSomething, I'm doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>if (Yii::app()-&gt;request-&gt;isAjaxRequest) {

  $model = new AJAXForm('submit');

  if (isset($_POST['AJAXForm'])) {

    $model-&gt;attributes = $_POST['AJAXForm'];

    if ($model-&gt;validate()) {
    //When data's valid, save to DB is working fine. This part is working perfectly.
    }
    else {
      //This is the part I'm confused about and that's not working

      /*Trying to render the form to get the error messages and summary displayed
      but nothing's showing */
      $this-&gt;renderPartial('/site/_form', array('AModel'=&gt;$model));

      Yii::app()-&gt;end();

    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Firebug, I do see that when an error is encountered, the response contains the entire partial rendered form again. However targetdiv is not getting updated with the updated form with the error messages. </p>

<p>I have a feeling I'm doing something wrong in actionController, but I can't figure out what. It would be helpful if I could see a full example of an AJAX submitted form as well.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If it takes me to the same instance, and user had written some data in some textfields, is there anyway to retain that on screen? (I might want to save them in some variables, and since the program will return back to the same instancem i'll be able to get the variables back)</p>

<p>Code is the following:</p>

<pre><code>op &lt;- printOperationNew

                                 set op [ printOperationNPages := 1]

                     --pango

                     let _ = do
                     --inside the Render Monad

                                 return ()
                     return ()

result &lt;- printOperationRun op PrintOperationActionPrintDialog window
</code></pre>

<p>This prints an empty page since I set the <code>printOperationNPages</code> to 1.
The problem is that cairo does not draw anything. I suppose I have to
connect the <code>cairoContext</code> with the pango layout, the proper call to
<code>showLayout</code> would actually be <code>pango_cairo_show_layout (cr, layout);</code>.</p>

<p>I already discussed this problem on the mailing list for gtk2hs [1].</p>

<p>So if anybody has experience with this, please let me know. I would also be grateful for other - preferable platform-independent - solutions to printing files/text in haskell.</p>

<p>The slider I'm using is called <a href=""http://dev.andreaseberhard.de/jquery/superbgimage/"">SuperBGImage</a>. <strong>If I remove the slider everything works!</strong></p>

<p>I thin it's the z-Index bug of IE but I tried different options by adding <code>position: relative;</code> without success. How do I get the hover effect fixed in IE?</p>

<p>I tried this JS code but it doesn't help either:</p>

<pre><code>$('li.level-1').hover(function() {
    $(this).children('ul.nav-level-2').removeClass('hidden');
    $(this).children('ul.nav-level-2').addClass('visible');
});
$('ul.nav-level-2').mouseout(function() {
    $(this).removeClass('visible');
    $(this).addClass('hidden');
});
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps it is a float issue. If I remove <code>float: left;</code> than it works better but it is not the design which it should be.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www66.zippyshare.com/v/24356058/file.html"">Here</a> you can download the project. I noticed another thing. If I start the Internet Explorer he asks me if I want to start the scripts or the Active-X elements. Why does he ask me that? I know it's because the slider but it should be normal Javascript. Perhaps the JS from the slider does something special here ...</p>

<p>Are there any pitfalls I do not see at the moment? Monkey patching <code>Array</code> with a function like this smells for me a little bit - is there any cleaner approach?</p>

<p>I simply want to chain those <code>has_many</code>-associations without much hassle in my code. Maybe there's already a gem for it I've not found yet?</p>

<p>And here is the code for the server program:</p>

I have read that nested functions are not really a great idea, due to performance, so how do I break up a function in a module? For example, lets say I have the following module:</p>

<pre><code>var Editor = {};

Editor.build = (function () {
    var x = 100;
    return {
        bigFunction: function () {
            // This is where I need to define a couple smaller functions 
            // should I create a new module for bigFunction? If so, should it be nested in Editor.build somehow?
        }
    };
})();
</code></pre>

<p>bigFunction is only related to Editor.build. Should I attach the smaller functions that make up bigFunction to the prototype bigFunction object? I'm not even sure if that would make sense.</p>

<pre><code>var Editor = {};

Editor.build = (function () {
    var x = 100;
    return {
        bigFunction: function () {
            bigFunction.smallFunction();
            bigFunction.prototype.smallFunction = function(){ /*do something */ };   
            // not sure if this even makes sense
        }
    };
})();

<p>Can someone please throw me in the right direction here? There is so much misleading information online, and would just like a definite guide on how to deal with this sort of modularization. </p>

<p>Ok, so will try now to explain better what we want to protect. We have a software both on android and iphone that is using some webservices of our php server.
We dont want anybody else to use our web services.
We could use SSL to talk between softwares and php server but for example, on android it is very easy to unassemble an android software and then access to the good code...
So we are looking to find how we can procted better the software like encryption of the talks.. or any other idea...</p>

<pre><code>http://myserver/MyServices/ServiceA.svc
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>http://myserver/MyServices/QA/1.1.0/ServiceA.svc
</code></pre>

<p>I configured the new folder to be an application in IIS, and set it up to run under the same service app pool we've been using.  That has all worked fine, I am able to navigate to my .svc URL and view the WSDL or open up the endpoint in wcf test client.  However, when trying to consume the service I am getting the following error:</p>

<p><strong>The identity check failed for the outgoing message. The expected identity is 'identity(http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/right/possessproperty: <a href=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn</a>)' for the 'http://myserver/MyServices/QA/1.1.0/ServiceA.svc' target endpoint.</strong></p>

<p>When I check the WSDL output, I noticed that the identity section seemed to leave out the identity of the app pool, which it usually includes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Identity xmlns=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/addressingidentity""&gt;
&lt;Upn&gt;myappuser@mydomain.local&lt;/Upn&gt;
&lt;/Identity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After trying to redeploy and reconfigure the app in IIS, I was able to get the identity to appear in the metadata for only some of the services.  Other services still don't include it, which is even more strange than before.  There are zero configuration differences between the original stack and the new stack in IIS as far as I can tell.  What sorts of issues could I be running in to that would causes these types of identity issues?</p>

<p>So far I have a project/file structure similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>CMS [CMS master]
  -CMSlib
Website1
  -scripts
    -CMSlib
Website2
  -scripts
    -CMSlib
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>CMS\CMSlib</code> folder contains the shared code and the CMS project itself is connected with a local Git repository and represents the latest version. I'm not sure how I should share this code between projects. If I am to share this code I must be able to retain the following workflow functionality: </p>

<ul>
<li>I must be able to test the websites on a web server. I have WAMP
installed for this purpose. Adding the <code>CMS</code> project to each website project's
include path in Eclipse is no good as a web server has no knowledge
of eclipse. So I need the files to be present locally (ideally within
the <code>scripts\CMSlib</code> folder within each website project).</li>
<li>The code for the CMS must be easy to update for all websites. So if I add
a feature to the <code>CMS</code> project it should be easy to update the CMS code for each
website project.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what is the best practice when these requirements are needed? Is there some way of pulling files from the repository into other projects with EGit (I am a Git beginner by the way)? Or am I missing some other setting that allows this to be done using the include path?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Copying and pasting <code>CMS\CMSlib</code> into a website project's <code>scripts</code> folder comes up with an option box forcing me to skip the operation if the folder <code>scripts\CMSlib</code> already exists.</p>

<li>conversion from a wider int type to a smaller type is not by

</ul>

<p>EDIT: Alternatively, if there are platforms in the period 1995 to 1998 which influenced the C99 decision to include the above, but which were discontinued, I would be interested in them also.</p>

<p>EDIT: The C rationale has this to say about padding bits:</p>

<p><em>Padding bits are user-accessible in an unsigned integer type. For example, suppose a machine
uses a pair of 16-bit shorts (each with its own sign bit) to make up a 32-bit int and the sign bit of the lower short is ignored when used in this 32-bit int. Then, as a 32-bit signed int, there is a padding bit (in the middle of the 32 bits) that is ignored in determining the value of the 32-bit signed int. But, if this 32-bit item is treated as a 32-bit unsigned int, then that padding bit is visible to the user’s program. The C committee was told that there is a machine that works this way, and that is one reason that padding bits were added to C99.</em></p>

<p><em>Footnotes 44 and 45 mention that parity bits might be padding bits. The committee does not
know of any machines with user-accessible parity bits within an integer. Therefore, the
committee is not aware of any machines that treat parity bits as padding bits.</em></p>

<p>So another question is, what is that machine which C99 mentioned?</p>

<p>I understood from the answers that I can't solve this myself since my <strong>hosting provider doesn't allow it</strong> (by default anyway). I'll contact them to see whether they're willing and able to do something about it.</p>

<p>If somebody else has the same problem: as a <strong>workaround</strong> I'll keep using my Python routines on my local <code>MySQL</code> database. I'll then use the Wordpress export and import tools to transfer my (updated) local database to the remote server where my website is located. That's not too bad since it will also result in frequent backups of my articles.</p>

<p>In CI's official documents, there is no clear statements explains how to use pagination class object in active record. My problem is; can not define current page and set it to SQL statement. Therefore, when program fetches data from MySQL with pagination, all page navigates first 0 and <code>$config['per_page'];</code>. I mean if I set to <code>per_page=20</code>, all pages link's fetches 0,20 of MySQL rows. </p>

<p><strong>My SQL Statement is:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;db-&gt;query(""SELECT b.*, a.adCampaignTitle FROM ads a, sms b WHERE b.`smsAd_ID`=a.ad_ID LIMIT "" . $config['per_page'])-&gt;result();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My Pagination Class properties :</strong></p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;load-&gt;database();
$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost/index.php/admin/index/page/';
$config['total_rows'] = $this-&gt;db-&gt;count_all('sms');
$config['per_page'] = 2;
$this-&gt;pagination-&gt;initialize($config);
</code></pre>

<p>If somebody help me to how-to-initialize and set to <strong>current page</strong> into SQL part I will be very glad ... </p>

<p>For example for the second row, <code>&lt;a href=""icard.aspx?cid=34&amp;amp;cpid=345&amp;amp;ccid=542""&gt;Insurance 2&lt;/a&gt;</code> should be <code>&lt;a href=""javascript:void(0);"" style=""color: #000; cursor: default;""&gt;Insurance 2&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

<p>If you save the file after this has occurred, the changes are kept the next time the workbook is opened.</p>

<p>The big concern is that this could occur on an end user machine as well if they ever migrated to a different version of Windows and used the designed sheets within a VM.</p>

<p>Any suggestions greatly appreciated.</p>

But making an App utilizing a server is something I have not experienced with. </p>

<p>The ideas is as follows:</p>

<p>1.) A simple server that sends out responses in JSON format (I have only had experiences with parsing in Objective-C but not generating from within a server).</p>

<p>2.) Enabling users to create a very simple account (profile name, password, a 50 x 50 px profile picture)</p>

<p>3.) It is just a fun / learning project between me and my other coworker. We were hoping to do, let's say, if I am driving to work and so does he, on the same route, we were hoping to be able to see each other's locations on google map and send each other /receive message each other a short message via the server. </p>

<p>And we were hoping to do all this server stuffs (preferably) within xCode and in Objective-C. There are many resources for server-side stuffs on the web for Java, Python, PHP etc, but not Objective-C. And we would love to be able to do all these in Objective-C.</p>

<p>I was hoping to get some advice regarding the technologies needed (ex: from hardware to software requirements to the structure / architecture of the set up)
from all of you.  Sample code and description would also be helpful. </p>

<p>Note: we are knowledgeable on how server works (sending / receiving requests, etc) and have coded already in Objective-C. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.  </p>

<p>At the moment when a new message is sent out to a user i change the 'status' of the message to unread, From this can run a count query to list all  of the unread messages in notification.</p>

<p>But if the users replies back to that message i cant set the original  'status'  field to  unread,  since this will appear on both users notification. so i created another field called 'RepliedStatus ' but i am unsure how would i use this to show notification on message reply? </p>

<p>(this is a stripped down not working example of my program, from the comments one can see I already tried to use BufferedInputStream). In general, this program is very unresponsive even for the first GET request from the browser. When I only read the clientdata once (not in a loop), I get a little bit further, e.g. get more GET/Response pairs, but at some point the program still gets stuck.</p>

<p>Somehow I think either I've a real trivial error I just don't manage to see, or the program should work, but simply doesn't for no real reason.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance!</p>

<p>The following code illustrates what I want to do. Note that the code <strong>T.values()</strong> is not valid in the following code.</p>

<pre><code>public class Filter&lt;T&gt; {
    private List&lt;T&gt; availableOptions = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();
    private T selectedOption;

    public Filter(T selectedOption) {
        this.selectedOption = selectedOption;
        for (T option : T.values()) {  // INVALID CODE
            availableOptions.add(option);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how I would instantiate a Filter object:</p>

<pre><code>Filter&lt;TimePeriod&gt; filter = new Filter&lt;TimePeriod&gt;(TimePeriod.ALL);
</code></pre>

<p>The enum is defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public enum TimePeriod {
    ALL(""All""), 
    FUTURE(""Future""), 
    NEXT7DAYS(""Next 7 Days""), 
    NEXT14DAYS(""Next 14 Days""), 
    NEXT30DAYS(""Next 30 Days""), 
    PAST(""Past""),
    LAST7DAYS(""Last 7 Days""), 
    LAST14DAYS(""Last 14 Days""),
    LAST30DAYS(""Last 30 Days""); 

    private final String name;

    private TimePeriod(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I realize it might not make sense to copy a enum's values to a list, but I'm using a library that needs a list of values as input and won't work with enums.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 2/5/2010:</p>

<p>Most of the answers proposed are very similar and suggest doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Filter&lt;T extends Enum&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    private List&lt;T&gt; availableOptions = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();
    private T selectedOption;

    public Filter(T selectedOption) {
        Class&lt;T&gt; clazz = (Class&lt;T&gt;) selectedOption.getClass();
        for (T option : clazz.getEnumConstants()) {
            availableOptions.add(option);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would work great if I can be sure that selectedOption has a non-null value.  Unfortunately, in my use case, this value is often null, as there is a <strong>public Filter()</strong> no-arg constructor as well. This means I can't do a selectedOption.getClass() without getting an NPE.  This filter class manages a list of available options which of the options is selected. When nothing is selected, selectedOption is null.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think to solve this is to actually pass in a Class in the constructor.  So something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Filter&lt;T extends Enum&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    private List&lt;T&gt; availableOptions = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();
    private T selectedOption;

    public Filter(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz) {
        this(clazz,null);
    }

    public Filter(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, T selectedOption) {
        this.selectedOption = selectedOption;
        for (T option : clazz.getEnumConstants()) {
            availableOptions.add(option);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas how to do this without needing an extra Class parameter in the constructors?</p>

<p>I've been using the js module pattern like this (rough example, I'm just worried about the structure): </p>

<p><strong>sloppy way?</strong></p>

<pre><code>/* Module Code */
var MapModule = (function ($) {
    var $_address;
    var $_mapContainer;

    function loadApi() {
        // do something. maybe load an API?

        // do other things
    }

    var pub = {};
    pub.setAddress = function (address) {
        $_address = address;
    };
    pub.getAddress = function () {
        return $_address;
    };
    pub.initialize = function () {
        loadApi();
    }
})(jQuery);

// usage
MapModule.initialize();
</code></pre>

<p>But that usage seems a little sloppy. I like constructors. </p>

<p>I refactored some modules like this: </p>

<p><strong>Better way?</strong> </p>

<pre><code>(function ($) {
    this.MapModule = function () {
        var $_address;
        var $_mapSelector;
        var $_mapContainer;
        function loadApi() {
            // do something. maybe load an API?
        }
        function someInternalMethod() {
            $_mapContainer = $($_mapSelector);
            // do stuff with the jQ object.
        }

        var pub = {};
        pub.setAddress = function (address) {
            $_address = address;
        };
        pub.getAddress = function () {
            return $_address;
        };
        pub.initialize = function (selector) {
            $_mapSelector = selector;
            loadApi();
        }
    }
})(jQuery);

var map = new MapModule();
map.initialize('#mapcontainer');
</code></pre>

<p>That usage seems a lot cleaner to me, and it works just fine, but am I going about it properly? </p>

<p><strong>Taking it another step</strong> </p>

<p>Say this module does some stuff with a div that wraps Google Maps and jQuery functionality: Any tips on turning that into a jQ plugin so I can use it with a signature like <code>var map = $('mapcontainer').mapModule();</code></p>

I displayed the value of the <code>density</code> that is resulted from <code>getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density;</code> and it is equal to 3.</p>

<p><strong><em>(1)</em></strong> is the <code>density</code> a device-dependent or it is changeable from device to another?</p>

<p><strong><em>(2)</em></strong> when getting the screen density is important? the tutorial I have might have answered 
    this question but it is not clear,it answered this question as follows ""Use screen 
    density when scaling on screen UI elements""??</p>

<p>What is flustering me now that, As you might know, when displaying an UI element in <code>touchscreen</code> environment and try to drag it you will realize the picked-up/dragged UI element is grabbed from its upper-left not from its center. So, if you want to grab an UI element in a <code>touchScreen</code> environment from its center you have to consider some <code>offset</code>.</p>

<p><strong><em>(3)</em></strong> Should the <code>offsets</code>be relative to the <code>density</code>?</p>

<p>I have a script that takes a parameter to be used as a wildcard.  Sometimes this wildcard contains whitespace.  I need to be able to use the wildcard for globbing, but word splitting is causing it to fail.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following example files:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l ""/home/me/dir with whitespace""
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 me     Domain Users 0 Jun 25 16:58 file_a.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 me     Domain Users 0 Jun 25 16:58 file_b.txt
</code></pre>

<p>My script - simplified to use a hard coded pattern variable - looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# Here this is hard coded, but normally it would be passed via parameter
# For example: pattern=""${1}""
# The whitespace and wildcard can appear anywhere in the pattern
pattern=""/home/me/dir with whitespace/file_*.txt""

# First attempt: without quoting
ls -l ${pattern}

# Result: word splitting AND globbing
#   ls: cannot access /home/me/dir: No such file or directory
#   ls: cannot access with: No such file or directory
#   ls: cannot access whitespace/file_*.txt: No such file or directory


####################

# Second attempt: with quoting
ls -l ""${pattern}""

# Result: no word splitting, no globbing
#   ls: cannot access /home/me/dir with whitespace/file_*.txt: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to enable globbing, but disable word splitting?<br>
Do I have any options except manually escaping whitespace in my pattern?</p>

<p>Works quite well, however if the same person views it over and over again it keeps incrementing. How should I go about fixing this so only unique hits increment it?</p>

<p>Should I have an <code>ip</code> model and make my Bottle  model <code>have_many</code> ips,the ips being that of the people who visited it? And then, do <em>something</em> this? (I'd extract it out into a class method but this is just to show you):</p>

<p>The three_split function extracts the feature of each name by splitting them into three-character substrings. For example, ""Katy Perry"" into ""kat"", ""aty"", ""ty "", ""y p"" ... etc.</p>

<p>Then I train with Naive Bayes and finally test the results.</p>

<p>There isn't any errors when running my codes, but when I try to use the non-Chinese names directly from the database and expect the program to return False (not Chinese), it returns True (Chinese) for any name I test. Any idea?</p>

<p>I have tried various options, but none really worked. The quality is not good enough. I'm quite new to ffmpeg and doesn't quite understand all the different flags. So any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>The commands I have tried:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -y -f x11grab -r 30 -s 1920x1080 -i :0.0+0,0 -vcodec libx264 -strict -2 -b:v 16M output.mov
</code></pre>

<p>The first command I tried. The weird thing is it doesn't seem to preserve the bitrate specified <code>-b:v 16M</code>. The output video's bitrate is only 2mb/s. Is that not the correct way to specify bitrate when doing screen capture?</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -r 30 -i :0.0 -qscale 0 -vcodec huffyuv output.mov
</code></pre>

<p>The huffyuv codec is supposed to be lossless, but the quality doesn't seem to be any better than the libx264 output.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 30 -s 1920x1080 -i :0.0+0,0 -vcodec copy -pix_fmt yuv420p -qscale 0 -an output.mkv
ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -s:v 1920x1080 -r 30 -i output.mkv -an -c:v libx264 -qscale 0 result.mov 
</code></pre>

<p>I'm even trying to capture rawvideo and then convert it to libx264 codec viedeo. But the output is corrupted.</p>

<p>I'm using the version of ffmpeg that's built on April 23rd this year. It doesn't have the preset like <code>-vpre lossless_ultrafast</code> which I see mentioned in a lot posts.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>After more research, this is the command I end up using. I have to use h264 codec and yuv420p as pixel_fmt since I need to be able to play the quicktimes using quicktime.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -y -f x11grab -framerate 30 -video_size 1920x1080 -i :0.0+0,0 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -qp 0 -preset ultrafast output.mov
</code></pre>

<p>The quality doesn't seem to be much improved even though -qp is set to 0. But it could also because of the rgb conversion to yuv color space according to this post.</p>

"11327941","1","11336881","","2012-07-04 11:12:39","","3","2430","<p>I - an embedded beginner - am fighting my way through the black magic world of embedded programming. So far I won already a bunch of fights, but this new bug seems to be a hard one.</p>

<p>First, my embedded setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>Olimex STM32-P207 (STM32F207)</li>
<li>Olimex ARM-USB-OCD-H JTAG</li>
<li>OpenOCD</li>
<li>Eclipse (with CDT and GDB hardware debugging)</li>
<li>Codesourcery Toolchain</li>
<li>Startup file and linker script (adapted memory map for the STM32F207) for RIDE (what uses GCC)</li>
<li>STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.1.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the many tutorials and Q&amp;As out there I was able to set-up makefile, linker and startup code and got some simple examples running using STM's standard library (classic blinky, using buttons and interrupts etc.). However, once I started playing around with the SysTick interrupts, things got messy.</p>

<p>If add the SysTick_Config() call to my code (even with an empty SysTick_Handler), ...</p>

<pre><code>int main(void)
{
  /*!&lt; At this stage the microcontroller clock setting is already configured, 
       [...]
  */
  if (SysTick_Config(SystemCoreClock / 120000))
  {
    // Catch config error
    while(1);
  }
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>... then my debugger starts at the (inline) function NVIC_SetPriority() and once I hit ""run"" I end up in the HardFault_Handler().
This only happens, when using the debugger. Otherwise the code runs normal (telling from the blinking LEDs).</p>

<p>I already read a lot and tried a lot (modifying compiler options, linker, startup, trying other code with SysTick_Config() calls), but nothing solved this problem.</p>

<p>One thing could be a hint:
The compiler starts in both cases (with and without the SysTick_Config call) at 0x00000184. In the case without the SysTick_Config call this points at the beginnig of main(). Using SysTick_Config this pionts at NVIC_SetPriority().</p>

<p>Does anybody have a clue what's going on? Any hint about where I could continue my search for a solution?</p>

<p>I don't know what further information would be helpful to solve this riddle. Please let me know and I will be happy to provide the missing pieces.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

Because the solution is burrowed in a comment, I put it up here:</p>

<p>My linker file was missing <strong><code>ENTRY(your_function_of_choice);</code></strong> (e.g. Reset_Handler). Adding this made my debugger work again (it now starts at the right point).</p>

This makes more sense, since as was pointed out, you <strong>often you have to use models that you either can't change</strong> or don't want to change and so your MVVM approach should be able to work with any model class as it happens to exist.</p>

<p>This example still <strong>allows you to view the live data from your model in design mode in Visual Studio and Expression Blend</strong> which I think is significant since you could have a mock data store that the designer connects to which has e.g. the smallest and largest strings that the UI can possibly encounter so that he can adjust the design based on those extremes.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm a bit surprised that I even have to ""put a timer"" in my ViewModel since it seems like that is a function of INotifyPropertyChanged, it seems redundant, but it was the only way I could get the XAML UI to constantly (once per second) reflect the state of my model. So it <strong>would be interesting to hear anyone who may have taken this approach if you encountered any disadvantages down the road</strong>, e.g. with threading or performance.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>State - Time</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>initial launch</li>
  <li>24hrs </li>
  <li>48hrs</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>My first idea was to just get the data and time on first launch and save it to a file.  Then I could check it ever now and again to see how much time has passed. The problem with this is I need it to be in realtime so that the changes will take effect immediately once the state is reached. It also needs to continue when the user is not using the app. The functionality I'm looking for is kind of similar to how the iOS strategy games work where you build structures that take x amount of time. </p>

<p>Anyway my question(s) is; is there some sort of library that can accomplish this and how can I get it to continue after the user exits the app? </p>

<p>Little more background information:</p>

<p>I have a class with some properties that all extending classes should have, let's say for example </p>

<pre><code>class Resource {
   String id;
   String description;
   String value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would be a use case for @MappedSuperclass. All extending classes/types would inherit from that class.</p>

<p>But I also have an other class, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
class MyList extends Resource {
   Resource firstElement;
   MyList otherElements;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, here, I would not be able to have that object property <code>firstElement</code> of type Resource, because Resource is not an @Entity.</p>

<p>Is this possible? What would you recommend to do?</p>

<p>Some things I have thought about in this context:</p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to use JOINED inheritance, since this allows me to have a very nice and clean schema on database level. I have one table for each class and subclass and nice foreign key references. Drawback here of course is that there are more joins when querying objects, but thats ok.</li>
<li>I don't want to use TABLE_PER_CLASS inheritance, because I have a bunch of data model classes and also a class level hierarchy of 3 in average. Using TABLE_PER_CLASS would mean to have database tables with a huge amount of columns.</li>
<li>When I let <code>Resource</code> be an @Entity and I query the database for let's say <code>Resource.value</code> this would result in a join over a huge amount of tables. In my data model about 50-60 tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you encountered such a design issue? How did you balance between a clean database design and performance? Many people recommend the TABLE_PER_CLASS inheritance hierarchy (haven't tried it yet), although I can't image having like all the properties of all classes in one table...</p>

<p>One of the benefits of the <em>static-linking</em> option is to make the <strong>deployment easier</strong> (in fact, in this way, it's possible to just deploy the shell extension in-proc COM server DLL, without external dependencies on other C/C++ run-time DLLs).</p>

<p>In case of <em>dynamic-linking</em>, if <code>msvcr100.dll</code>, <code>msvcp100.dll</code>, etc. DLLs in <code>Windows\System32</code> are used by the shell extension, the good thing is that if Microsoft fixes something (e.g. security fixes) in those DLLs, <strong>the fixes are <em>automatically</em> used by the custom shell extension</strong>.<br>
However, the bad thing is that those ""global"" fixes may also introduce bugs and <em>break</em> things in the dependant code.</p>

<p>As for <em>app-local</em> deployment of VCRedist DLLs, I'm not sure how it might work in case of a shell extension. What kind of manifest should be embedded in the shell extension COM DLL to refer to the VCRedist DLLs under the shell extension's folder?</p>

If the log entry is for an exception and stack-trace, that information is included for free.  But if the log entry is not for an exception, then a variety of other approaches are typically used to obtain this result:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hard-code a const field into each class, which holds the name of the class (or the logger itself!).  The logger is given that const when logging.</li>
<li>The logger is wrapped with code that reflects the call stack, to determine which class had made the logging invocation.  The name is then added to the log entry.</li>
<li>Each class is injected with a logger instance which already knows the name of the class in which it is injected.</li>
</ol>

<p>A simple example of #3 looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>ILogger logger = new MyLogger(""AmazingClass"");
IAmazingClass foo = new AmazingClass(logger);

<p>I feel the answer should be simple: the IOC container ""knows"" which class it is about to construct and inject, and offers that ""dependor"" information to the ""dependee"" before it finishes resolving the type.  </p>

<p>For example, perhaps Unity could accomplish this through <a href=""http://ithinksharp.blogspot.com/2010/02/unity-2-and-injectionfactory.html"" rel=""nofollow"">delegate registration</a> and a ""reverse reflection"" registration like this:</p>

<pre><code>var container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, MyLogger&gt;(new InjectionFactory(
    (Type targetOfInjection) =&gt; new MyLogger(targetOfInjection.Name)
);
</code></pre>

<p>I made up that syntax, but it is entirely believable.  That said, what in reality does Unity (or another IOC container) offer for proposed capability?</p>

<p><em>p.s.</em> I personally am ""ok"" with my logger and logging making no attempt to capture the class/object names for non-exception entries.  Keeps the code simpler.   But if I am forced to do this approach, I usually take the stack-reflection option (scenario #2).  It would be interesting to know what other approaches people favor when they too are required to capture class names in non-exception logging statements.  Ultimately, however, this question focuses on using an IOC container.</p>

<p>This query inside the method returns a single object of the <code>StateTable</code> (just say state) entity which I'm dealing with and corresponds to the following JPQL query.</p>

             .setParameter(""id"", id)
             .getSingleResult();
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I need to find more than one row that corresponds to a list of ids supplied via <code>java.util.List&lt;Long&gt;</code>. The following is the incomplete version of the criteria query.</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;StateTable&gt; find(List&lt;Long&gt; ids)
{
    CriteriaBuilder criteriaBuilder=entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery&lt;StateTable&gt; criteriaQuery=criteriaBuilder.createQuery(StateTable.class);
    Metamodel metamodel=entityManager.getMetamodel();
    EntityType&lt;StateTable&gt; entityType = metamodel.entity(StateTable.class);
    Root&lt;StateTable&gt; root = criteriaQuery.from(entityType);

    ParameterExpression&lt;Long&gt; parameterExpression = criteriaBuilder.parameter(Long.class);
    criteriaQuery.where(criteriaBuilder.in(root.get(StateTable_.stateId)).value(parameterExpression));

    TypedQuery&lt;StateTable&gt; typedQuery = entityManager.createQuery(criteriaQuery);
    return typedQuery.setParameter(parameterExpression, 1L).getResultList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It uses an <code>in()</code> query but I made it return only a single row, since I don't know whether it is possible to set a list of ids to <code>ParameterExpression</code> or not.</p>

<p>In short, this criteria query should correspond to the following JPQL query.</p>

<pre><code>entityManager.createQuery(""from StateTable where stateId in(:id)"")
             .setParameter(""id"", ids)
             .getResultList();
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>If the item processed is related to sports, I want to add 2 (so first line would be 32). If it's a music item, I want to add 4 (so second line would be 504).</li>
<li>If the item processed is food related, I want to add 5 (so both lines of second input would have an increment of 5).</li>
<li>If the item processed is luxury kind, I want to add 10.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am having troubles in one thing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify and mapping which kind of item is in a particular line.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using regex I am able to find the part of the line that is supposed to be the item:</p>

<pre><code>soccer ball
piano
guitars
bottle of whisky
package of caviar
</code></pre>

<pre><code>{""soccer"" =&gt; ""sports"", ""piano"" =&gt; ""music"", ""guitars"" =&gt; ""music"", ""whisky"" =&gt; ""food"", ""caviar"" =&gt; ""food""}

<p>As far as I understand, using Silverlight Deep Zoom requires you to </p>

<li>Write an Silverlight app to embed on your site, which is not exactly trivial with no prior Silverlight experience, as you have to implement the various actions (zoom, pan) yourself and include button icons.  </li>

<p>The JQuery used to Scroll to the relevant div:</p>

<pre><code>        function scrollToID(id, speed) {
          var offSet = 70;
          var obj = $(id).offset();

"24972300","1","","","2014-07-26 14:56:52","","4","261","<p>I need to store a container of pointers to objects.
These objects have some common methods/attributes (interface) that I want to enforce (possibly at compile time) and use.
Example:</p>

<pre><code>struct A{
    void fly(){}
};

struct B{
    void fly(){}
};

A a;
B b;
std::vector&lt;some *&gt; objects;
objects.push_back(&amp;a);
objects.push_back(&amp;b);

for(auto &amp; el: objects)
    el-&gt;fly();
</code></pre>

<p>The simpler solution would be <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> inherit a common base class like <code>FlyingClass</code>:</p>

<pre><code>struct FlyingClass{
    void fly(){}
};
struct A: public FlyingClass { ...
struct B: public FlyingClass { ...
</code></pre>

<p>and create a</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;FlyingClass *&gt; objects;
</code></pre>

<p>This will work and also enforce the fact that I can only add to <code>objects</code> things that can fly (implement <code>FlyingClass</code>).</p>

<p>But what if I need to implement some other common methods/attributes WITHOUT coupling them with the above base class?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>struct A{
    void fly(){}
    void swim(){}
};

struct B{
    void fly(){}
    void swim(){}
};
</code></pre>

<p>And i would like to do:</p>

<pre><code>for(auto &amp; el: objects) {
    el-&gt;fly();
    ...
    el-&gt;swim();
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>More in general i would be able to call a function passing one of these pointers and access both the common methods/attributes, like:</p>

<pre><code>void dostuff(Element * el){
    el-&gt;fly();
    el-&gt;swim();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I could try to inherit from another interface like:</p>

<pre><code>struct SwimmingClass{
    void swim(){}
};

struct A: public FlyingClass, public SwimmingClass { ...
struct B: public FlyingClass, public SwimmingClass { ...
</code></pre>

<p>But then what the container should contain?</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;FlyingClass&amp;&amp;SwimmingClass *&gt; objects;
</code></pre>

<p>Sure, i could implement <code>SwimmingFlyingClass</code>, but what if i need <code>RunningClass</code> etc.. This is going to be a nightmare.
In other words, how can I implement a pointer to multiple interfaces without coupling them?</p>

<p>Or there is some template way of rethinking the problem?
Even run time type information could be acceptable in my application, if there is an elegant and maintainable way of doing this.</p>

So as example for my .CSV file :</p>

<pre><code>time;columnA;columnB,ColumnC
27-08-2013 14:43:00; this is a text; this too; same here
</code></pre>

<p>So what I did is store the content in an bidimensional  String array (thanks to split()).
My array is made as follow :</p>

<pre><code>array[0][x] = ""time"".
array[y][x] = ""27-08-2013 14:43:00"";
</code></pre>

<p>they are x different columns, but the name of every column is only stored on line[0][x].
they are y different lines, with the value stored as String in it.</p>

<p>My problem is the following, I want to get the [x] position of the data, but when i try to access the last [x] element of the array.
I receive this as error-message</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 17

    at en.window.Main.main(Main.java:48)

<p>Obviously i'm reading to far, but how?</p>

<p>Here my code :</p>

<pre><code>//Retrieves the x position of the variable var given as parameter.
private int getPosVar(String[][] index, String var)
{
    int x = 0;
    boolean cond = false;
    while((index[0][x] != null) &amp;&amp; (cond != true))
    {
        if (index[0][x].contains(var) == true)
        {

        x++;
    }
    System.out.println(""x = "" +x+ ""  val = "" +index[0][x]);
    return(x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I thought it may be because I didn't checked that my x value was smaller than the full string.
like this :</p>

<pre><code>x &lt; index[x].length
</code></pre>

<p>But in fact I didn't changed anything, and when I give an unknown <code>String var</code> it also goes too far.
Why?</p>

For eg - (ph no - +6581329445 and ext no - 303)
So, firstly you will need to call the phone number(eg - +6581329445 ) and then you will need to press the desire extension no (eg - 303) after picked up the phone by other side(callee).</p>

<p>I would like to do this step by programmatically.
Now, I can call to the phone number(eg - +6581329445) from my program and then the callee will picked the phone and I will need to input the number of destination extension number(eg - 303) from my program.(likely to dial the destination extension number(eg - 303) in keypad of phone application answering screen during the callee(eg - +6581329445) answering the phone).</p>

<p>Use cases explanation by pictures.</p>

<p>As the user types in the first TextBox and his text exceeds a certain # of characters (e.g. 138) I want to either add another item to the list as the next item and change focus to it, or, if there's already a next item, change focus to it.</p>

<p>I can't figure out how to get access to</p>

<p>1) The root list box
2) The TextBox control within an item given a list box item ID</p>

<p>Here's what I tried. When this runs, the <code>MainLongListSelector.SelectedITem = nextItem</code> causes the next item to be selected, but it does NOT get focus.</p>

<pre><code>private void TextBox_TextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e) {
    var editBox = sender as TextBox;
    var selectedItem = MainLongListSelector.SelectedItem as ItemViewModel;
    if (editBox != null &amp;&amp; selectedItem != null &amp;&amp; editBox.Text.Length &gt; 138) {
        // Move data at end to next box
        var overflow = editBox.Text.Substring(138, editBox.Text.Length - 138) ;
        selectedItem.Tweet = editBox.Text.Substring(0, 138);
        var nextItem = App.ViewModel.Items[int.Parse(selectedItem.ID) + 1];
        nextItem.Tweet = overflow;
        MainLongListSelector.SelectedItem = nextItem;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to access the actual TextBox of that <code>nextItem</code> so I can explicitly set focus to it.</p>

<p>The same question applies if I just use <code>ListBox</code> but the issues are different. In the <code>ListBox</code> case when the <code>DataTemplate</code> contains a <code>TextBox</code> and focus is set, I don't get <code>SelectionChanged</code> events...which is why I'm sticking with <code>LongListSelector</code>.</p>

<p>I've created a struct as follows:</p>

<pre><code>struct strProjectile
{
    int Damage;
    int ParticlesPerSecond;
    short Fire;
    short Plasma;
};
</code></pre>

<p>I've then created an array as follows:</p>

<pre><code>strProjectile Projectiles[40];
</code></pre>

<p>From that array, I've then created a pointer to point at the beginning of the array:</p>

<pre><code>strProjectile *ptrProjectiles;
ptrProjectiles = Projectiles;
</code></pre>

<p>Using that pointer, you can set the values in the variables like so (I know this can be done directly not using the pointer too using the . notation):</p>

<pre><code>ptrProjectiles-&gt;Damage = 0;
ptrProjectiles-&gt;ParticlesPerSecond = 0;
ptrProjectiles-&gt;Fire = 0;
ptrProjectiles-&gt;Plasma = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>I have also found I can set the values in the variables by creating a pointer to each of the variables in each struct of the array.  For example, the following would set Damage to 0:</p>

<pre><code>int *Damage = (int *)ptrProjectiles;
*Damage = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>My question is can I use the pointer to the array directly to set each variable within the struct directly in memory as I did using the separate pointer for damage above?  Using something like:</p>

<pre><code>*ptryProjectiles = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>then skipping 4 bytes of memory to get to the next variable in the struct (in this case, ParticlesPerSecond), set that, then skip 4 bytes more and set the next variable (in this case, Fire), then skip the next 2 bytes and set the next variable (in this case, Plasma), then skip 2 more bytes to get the next object in the array and then repeat....</p>

<p>I cant see a reason I need to do this, but just want to know if it can be done for my full understanding....</p>

<p>I have to select symbols (based on a input template) from this image and highlight those using a rectangular bounding box. The symbols may be rotated (and scaled)  - but for now let's not consider scaling/rotation. There could be multiple symbols and lines in the same column/row. </p>

<p>The image size is 5600x3600. It is grayscale, converted to b/w and then the whole thing can be mentioned as 0s and 1s where 1 == black pixel. I think white pixels can be considered as ""don't-cares""</p>

<p>What is the correct and faster method to do this?</p>

<p>I have a template image extracted from the larger image - for example ""diode.png"". Let's say that at least one symbol matches exactly without scaling or rotation.</p>

<p>Brute force template/matrix comparison approach works for me - but it is very slow.. takes 45 minutes (on the latest MBP-2.4ghz-Intel i5 / 8GB) to detect one exact match. I am using numpy wherever I could - but probably I am not using certain numpy iterators.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I cannot do this outside python and cannot reduce the image size below 5600x3600 without making symbols unrecognisable. </p>

<p>Another way to put the problem is to : find all matching sub-matrices from a large matrix.</p>

<p>What is the correct and performing method to achieve the above?
I do not understand signal processing much - but could that help here? The template size (submatrix) in here is minimum 50x50</p>

<p>EDIT: OpenCV is not an option for me - skimage is available. However, please do not let that stop your inputs.</p>

<p>I cannot share the actual diagrams but a sample is here. For example diodes are  labeled as D1 and D2 here. The full diagram is as clear as this but on a canvas of 5600 x 3600</p>

<p>Note: I do not have a copy of the original repository or it's settings as it appears that everything else was deleted over a year ago.</p>

<p>Where/how can I work with Anksvn commandlines? Where can I even find it? I have found commands but have no idea where to work with them. Why can I not just commit them to another repository? All the files return an error that they are locked? Completely confused with the whole subversion ordeal.</p>

And I just won't create a frigging localhost webserver just to load a local piece of html. </p>

<p>Basically my problem is that if I link to other html files in the menu-bar, the entire javascript reloads too, that makes it impossible to keep processes running without interruption in the background. If the Html page reloads <strong><em>everything including Javascript files reload.</em></strong> Killing the current processes of Node-webkit Node Js etc.</p>

<p>Here a piece of code just to illustrate what I <strong>don't</strong> want to do. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    setInterval(function() {
        console.log(""this task can't be interrupted!"");
    }, 3000);
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=""more_important_js_tasks_running_here.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=""menu""&gt;
        &lt;ul class=""pure-menu-list""&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""file1.html""&gt;If I click here I will kill my javascript task 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""file2.html""&gt;If I click here I will kill my javascript task 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""file3.html""&gt;If I click here I will kill my javascript task 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;div class=""this is the content I would like to change.. maybe 100 lines of code or whatever""&gt;


        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I could put everything into a string, and do  </p>

<p><code>document.body.innerHTML = ""&lt;p&gt;whatever&lt;/p&gt;”</code>;  </p>

<p>but this isn't practical because there is no nice way to put everything into one line. Codifying everything into one line also can accidentally go wrong.. Something inevitable with a large string of html. </p>

<p><code>document.body.innerHTML = ""&lt;p class=""p""&gt;If this happens it will break&lt;/p&gt;"";</code>  </p>

<p>Multi-line strings aren't a good option either </p>

<pre><code>var str = ""Javascript \ 
    multi-line \
    strings \
    are \
    awful"";
</code></pre>

<p>No easy way to copy-paste your code into that and this code could break because of one whitespace after any of the escape characters. Maybe concatenation? </p>

<pre><code>var a = ""hey man, this is on a line\n"" + 
        ""and this is on another\n"" +
        ""and this is on a third"";  
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck concatenating manually your 300 lines html file like this.
At least <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/template_strings"" rel=""nofollow"">there is a better way to do this in ES6.</a></p>

<p>Perhaps I could use something like <a href=""https://github.com/tautologistics/node-htmlparser"" rel=""nofollow"">node-htmlparser</a> and read/parse the entire file.. but still there is the problem of getting that whole piece into the DOM. </p>

<pre><code>fs.createReadStream('./path_to_file.html').pipe(parser);
</code></pre>

<p>Is there no simple, standart pure-javascript way to swap content locally without crazy hacks or external libraries? Wasn't the web designed for this and isn't there a need to implement some solution for this in these days where tools like <a href=""https://github.com/atom/electron"" rel=""nofollow"">Electron</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/"" rel=""nofollow"">NW</a> are becoming more and more popular for desktop application development?</p>

"18284379","1","18284441","","2013-08-17 02:00:46","","0","295","<p>I have been working on an exercise in my c++ programming book and it basically is asking me to create a program that will take 3 files, an old master file of client data (account, name, balance), a transaction file (of account names and credits or debits), and then a function to merge this files and output a new master file of client data. I am pretty sure I know how to do this, or even if I don't I think I can figure it out, the problem I am having is with a simple choice selection interface which is implemented exactly the same as another program that works just fine. When I first run the program it will let me input a choice (int) and then run the appropriate function (of which I only have 1 implemented completely, that being the createMasterFile function. After creating entries in the file and having them read back to the screen just for debugging and verification purposees, it will return to the while statement below but if I watch the choice function in both the main function and the enterChoice() function when I make the first selection (the one that works) those variables (according to gdb) do not take on any values until AFTER createMasterFile runs, before that it states that it is not in scope, after it runs through once choice will take on the original value 1 as it hits while, then seems to skip the condition of the while statement, then hits the switch statement which somehow changes choice to 0 which then hits the default case which then returns to the while statement and choice takes on a value of 32767 and again seems to skip the conditional part of the while statement and gets stuck in an infinite loop at this point with choice never changing in value. In a very similar program (the only difference is that the program that works uses binary files instead of sequential files) this works just fine. The interface looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>enum Choices {CREATE_MASTER =1, CREATE_TRANSACTION, SORT_MASTER, UPDATE_MASTER, SORT_TRANS, UPDATE_TRANS, MERGE, END  };

int choice;

while ( ( choice = enterChoice()) != END )
{
    switch( choice )
    {
        case CREATE_MASTER:
            createMasterFile( inOutOldMasterFile );
            break;
        case CREATE_TRANSACTION:
            break;
        case SORT_MASTER:
            break;
        case UPDATE_MASTER:
            break;
        case SORT_TRANS:
            break;
        case UPDATE_TRANS:
            break;
        case MERGE:
            break;
        default:
            cerr &lt;&lt; ""Incorrect choice"" &lt;&lt; endl;
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the enterchoice() function is:</p>

<pre><code>int enterChoice()
{
cout &lt;&lt; ""\nEnter your choice below"" &lt;&lt; endl
    &lt;&lt; ""1 - Create Master Record"" &lt;&lt; endl
    &lt;&lt; ""2 - Create Transaction Record"" &lt;&lt; endl
    &lt;&lt; ""3 - Sort Master File In Descending Order"" &lt;&lt; endl
    &lt;&lt; ""4 - Update Master File"" &lt;&lt; endl
    &lt;&lt; ""5 - Sort Transaction File"" &lt;&lt; endl
    &lt;&lt; ""6 - Update Transaction File"" &lt;&lt; endl
    &lt;&lt; ""7 - Merge Transaction and Old Master File"" &lt;&lt; endl
    &lt;&lt; ""8 - End Program\n?"";

    int choice;
    cin &gt;&gt; choice;
    return choice;

If it would have been solely Java application, I would have known exactly how to structure the project in Idea:
A single Java project, containing several modules: One for each part of the application (JAR).There will be at most 4-5 JARs.</p>

<p>The dependencies between the modules are also known: <strong>Protocol</strong> does not depend on anything, everything else depends on <strong>Infrastructure</strong>, and so on.
Next, I would like to use Gradle scripting for managing the project. So my question is what is the best practice to structure the code in Idea?</p>

<p>Should I create a single Gradle Project and a Gradle module for each of the JARs?</p>

<p>Should I create a single Java project (or maybe empty project) and Gradle modules for each of the JARs?</p>

<p>Should I create a single Gradle project and each of the modules will be a Gradle's sub-project? Maybe it will be better to have an empty project and several Gradle modules because not all of the JARs are closely coupled?</p>

<p>Since I have never used Gradle before, I would appreciate any guidance for the best practices when combining both Gradle and Idea.</p>

I never liked to design windows in Java (AWT, Swing, SWT): too much work for an ugly interface. So I think it could be a good idea if could take advantage of my web-app skills. One option is to modify the SWT Browser and make calls to a Java function instead of HTTP requests. A very good add-on would be use of JSP. Finally, I thought that probably there is some framework or tool for this.</p>

<p>Do you think that what I propose is a good idea?
There is available some framework for this?</p>

<p>I need this for light applications. So I think that embedding an Tomcat server and using it with HTTP requests is not a good idea.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: One example application could be a folder comparer: you specify two folders and the app shows you wich folders and files are different. In this case, I think opening an external browser is ugly. Bloated application (with its server, MVC, etc) wouldn't be the best choice.</strong></p>

Freeradius succesfully performs authentication but he places Proxy-State at the bottom of Access-Accept. How can I canfigure that Freeradius places Framed-IP-Address at the bottom of the message?</p>

<p>It tried to configure ""users"" as:</p>

<pre><code>381603854966   Auth-Type := Accept, User-Password == ""123456""

       Framed-IP-Address = 10.10.40.22,

<p>but without success - freeradius still puts Proxy-State and the bottom of Access-Accept. I also tried to configure policy.txt file like:</p>

<pre><code>if (User-Name == ""381603854966"") {

                Framed-IP-Address    += ""10.10.40.22""
    }

<pre><code>    reply .= {
     Framed-IP-Address = 10.10.40.22

<p>Looking at an example test-suite setup <a href=""https://github.com/tibbe/hashable/blob/master/hashable.cabal"">here</a>, I noticed that they're specifying their own package as one of the build-depends module. Therefore I did the same, so that I can keep my <code>build-depends</code> list for my test-suite short.</p>

<p>However when I try <code>cabal repl test:tests</code> in commandline, I'm getting the following error:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;command line&gt;: cannot satisfy -package-id HaskSplit-0.1.0.0-inplace
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not too sure what I'm missing here, can anyone help me out? Is it cyclic dependencies happening around here? Or do I need to create a library instance of my package for the build-depends to work?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>So I generalized to find all n-bit sequences with k - bit unique subsequences satisfy the above requirements. However, the only approach I can think of is using a brutal force search: generate all permutations of n-bit sequence with the first k bits zero, then for each sequence, check if all k-bit subsequences are unique.

<p>I am a little new to Spring.NET and I cannot figure out what the problem here is, other than it cannot inject an ArrayList into the IList property.  <strong>Is it possible to create lists in the configuration where values are enumerated types?  If so, how?</strong></p>

"31386149","1","31720532","","2015-07-13 14:30:32","","1","107","<p>I'm currently working on an embedded system which is meant to output a specific pulse sequence at equidistant timings. Therefore, I use the STM32 - DISCO board with the FreeRTOS kernel, as a first test. 
I configured TIM3 as Master triggering TIM1. TIM1 is triggered with a frequency of 1Hz or every second. TIM3 then generates a pulse sequence on it's output.
I configured the TIM3 output to PB4, and TIM1 to PA9. This configuration works as expected, but now I wanted to change the configuration on the fly with a structure that stores my settings and can be passed as pointer to a function that configures both timers. </p>

<p>As a first step, I generated a data structure and initialized it in my timer function to configure TIM3.</p>

<pre><code>PG_ERR TIM_Master_Init(void){

PG_HandleTypeDef hPG_timer;
hPG_timer.PLS.Prescaler = 139;
hPG_timer.PLS.Period = 60000;
hPG_timer.PLS.DutyCycle = 30000;
hPG_timer.PLS.RepetitionCounter = 5;
hPG_timer.PLS.PercentChange = 0;

/* Timer3 handler declaration: Master */
TIM_HandleTypeDef           TimMasterHandle;

/* Master configuration structure */
TIM_MasterConfigTypeDef sMasterConfig;

/* Output compare structure */
TIM_OC_InitTypeDef          sOCConfig;

__TIM3_CLK_ENABLE();

PG_ERR xPGERR = PG_ERR_NONE;
/* Compute the prescaler value to have TIM3 counter clock equal to 60 KHz */

/* Set TIMx instance */
TimMasterHandle.Instance = MASTER_TIM;
/* Master configuration: TIM3  */
TimMasterHandle.Init.Period = 60000 - 1;
TimMasterHandle.Init.Prescaler = 1399;
TimMasterHandle.Init.ClockDivision = 0;
TimMasterHandle.Init.CounterMode = TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP;
if (HAL_TIM_PWM_Init(&amp;TimMasterHandle) != HAL_OK){
    xPGERR = PG_ERR_TIM;
}

/* Configure the PWM_channel_1  */
sOCConfig.OCMode     = TIM_OCMODE_PWM1;
sOCConfig.OCPolarity = TIM_OCPOLARITY_HIGH;
sOCConfig.OCFastMode = TIM_OCFAST_ENABLE;
sOCConfig.Pulse = 30000;

if (HAL_TIM_PWM_ConfigChannel(&amp;TimMasterHandle, &amp;sOCConfig, TIM_CHANNEL_1) != HAL_OK){
    xPGERR = PG_ERR_TIM;
}

/* Configure TIM3 as master &amp; use the update event as Trigger Output (TRGO) */
sMasterConfig.MasterOutputTrigger = TIM_TRGO_OC1REF;
sMasterConfig.MasterSlaveMode           = TIM_MASTERSLAVEMODE_ENABLE;
if(HAL_TIMEx_MasterConfigSynchronization(&amp;TimMasterHandle, &amp;sMasterConfig) != HAL_OK){
    xPGERR = PG_ERR_TIM;
}       

/* Start PWM Timer3*/
if(HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(&amp;TimMasterHandle, TIM_CHANNEL_1) != HAL_OK){
    xPGERR = PG_ERR_TIM;
}

if(HAL_TIM_Base_Start_IT(&amp;TimMasterHandle) != HAL_OK){
    xPGERR = PG_ERR_TIM;
}

return xPGERR;
}
</code></pre>

<p>1) With this configuration i get some really odd behaviour. After including the data structure:</p>

<pre><code>PG_HandleTypeDef hPG_timer;
hPG_timer.PLS.Prescaler = 139;
hPG_timer.PLS.Period = 60000;
hPG_timer.PLS.DutyCycle = 30000;
hPG_timer.PLS.RepetitionCounter = 5;
hPG_timer.PLS.PercentChange = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>After that code snipped, I don't get any output on PIN PB4 (Master - TIM3) which should still be toggled at 1Hz.</p>

<p>2) To get even more confusing, when I substitute the code block with a handle:</p>

<pre><code>PG_HandleTypeDef hPG_timer;
PG_HandleTypeDef *hPG_timer;
hPG_timer = &amp;hPG_timer_config;
hPG_timer.PLS.Prescaler = 139;
hPG_timer.PLS.Period = 60000;
hPG_timer.PLS.DutyCycle = 30000;
hPG_timer.PLS.RepetitionCounter = 5;
hPG_timer.PLS.PercentChange = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can see the output on PB4 (Master - TIM3) with 1Hz but the output polarity of PA9 (Slave - TIM1) is reversed.</p>

<p>I tried to investigate the problem, I focused on the stack/heap of the FreeRTOS. I tested the system with large heap/stack = (uint32_t) 65535; I couldn't observe any changes in the behaviour. </p>

<p>I hope somebody came across a similar problem or has an idea how to resolve this. I'm thankful for any input in this, I'm at the end of my knowledge unfortunately.</p>

<p>Edit:
I spend some more time with the problem, and I think I can be more specific. In case of the pointer use, the TimMasterHandle is locked right after the initialization. If I unlock the handle TimMasterHandle.lock = HAL_UNLOCK; all works well, but that is just masking the problem and i would like to know where this is coming from.</p>

<p>It some how looks still like an heap or stack problem. Is there any way, I can check for heap or stack overflow. I am using Keil uVision 5.10. </p>

<p>Thank you for your time and help,</p>

So I'm trying to understand how things work to maybe find a solution.</p>

<p>We need to replace a lot of JQuery code with 'native' Javascript. With Jquery, we are able to do <code>$('&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;')</code> and then perform operations on the nodes of this object, search them... etc.</p>

<p>What does Jquery do? Does it create a new document? Append to the existing one? </p>

<p>Since a lot of people question our replacement of Jquery, here is a little more details: we are building a chrome application which will make use of content script. Even if Jquery is lightweight, it's not very kind of us to add a couple MB of memory consumed in each tab for a very few Jquery methods. Jquery <em>is</em> awesome and fits many many needs, not ours.</p>

<p>All examples of DataSet / DataTable etc are using linq but they always specify the column names - which I don't have the luxury of at design time.</p>

I have an interest in flight simulators, and am curious about the functional programming aspect of Lisp. Flight simulators or any other real world simulator makes sense to me in an object-oriented paradigm. </p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<p>Is object oriented the best way to represent a real world simulation domain?</p>

<p>I know that Common Lisp has CLOS (OO for lisp), but my question is really about writing a flight simulator in a functional language.  So if you were going to write it in Lisp, would you choose to use CLOS or write it in a functional manner?</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on coding a flight simulator in lisp or any functional language?</p>

<p>Here's the app hierarchy:</p>

<pre><code>---&gt; MainActivity.java
   --&gt; MyListFragment.java
   --&gt; MyDetailFragment.java
</code></pre>

<p>So when the app is opened, the list is displayed via the MyListFragment.java and when an item is clicked, the item position is passed into MyDetailFragment.java and the fragment is replaced to display the detail of that item.</p>

<p>Currently I tried to implement an up caret button when MyDetailFragment.java is loaded but ended up with bugs such as the up caret appearing when MyListFragment.java is also loaded back when the user presses 'back' or uses the up caret button.</p>

<p>After researching the problem online, I see that some users use separate activities along with fragments which look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>---&gt; MainListActivity.java
  --&gt; MyListFragment.java
---&gt; DetailListActivity.java
  --&gt; MyDetailFragment.java
</code></pre>

<p>My question: Which pattern is better to use, the first or the second and why?</p>

Each of the figures, the box and the triangle, will have an offset telling how far they are indented from the edge of the screen. Each figure will also have a size, although the size will be determined differently for a box and a triangle. 
The base class Figure will have instance variables for any properties that all figures have in common and will have methods for the actions that all figures have. For example, every figure has a given offset, and every figure should be able to draw itself. However, because we don’t know how to draw a figure of unknown shape, declare drawHere() to be an abstract method and Figure to be an abstract class. The classes Box and Triangle will then be derived classes of Figure and they will provide the implementation of drawHere(). Here is the UML diagram of Figure, Box, and Triangle.   </p>

<p>The method drawHere will simply indent a number of spaces on the screen equal to the offset and then write an asterisk on the screen. This is just so you can have something to test. You do not intend to use this version of drawHere in any application. You will override the definition of drawHere when you define classes for boxes and triangles.</p>

<p>The method drawAt has one parameter of type int. The method drawAt inserts a number of blank lines equal to this parameter and then draws the figure by calling drawHere. When you override drawHere, then drawAt will also produce correct figures. </p>

So I have a single page angular app which will make multiple api calls and start displaying as each data gets returned. I don't want to wait for all the results from the API call and then load the data, so I started learning deferred and promise. </p>

<p>I have an angular service called <strong>api</strong> where I will have $http calls to all my api. I have hardcoded the data that returns from each one of the api calls for testing purposes.</p>

<pre><code>debugger.factory ""api"", [""$resource"", ""$q"", ($resource, $q) -&gt;

    key1: ""v1""

  apiCall7 =

  factory = getIsDynamicApp: -&gt;
    deferred = $q.defer()
    deferred.resolve apiCall1
    deferred.promise

  factory
]
</code></pre>

<p>I have created an edge service to call methods from my api service. I have used $timeout to simulate the async api calls.</p>

<pre><code>debugger.factory ""EdgeService"", ($resource, api, $q, $timeout, $http) -&gt;

  fetchIsDynamic = -&gt;
    api.getIsDynamicApp()   

  tickets: -&gt;
    deferred = $q.defer()
    fetchIsDynamic().then (data) -&gt;
      $timeout (-&gt;
        deferred.resolve data
        console.log data #&lt;- this works, I can see the data
      ), 3000  
    deferred.promise
</code></pre>

<p>In my EdgeController I call the service and attach the value to $scope.data</p>

<pre><code>debugger.controller ""EdgeController"", ($scope, EdgeService) -&gt;
  $scope.load = -&gt;
    $scope.data = EdgeService.tickets()

debugger.$inject = [""$scope""]

<pre><code>Processor 1:
0 1 1 0
0 0 1 0

Processor 2:
0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1

Processor 3:
1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1

...
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to combine, or ""concatenate"", all the sub-arrays together. For example I would want the large array to be:</p>

<pre><code>0 1 1 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 
1 1 1 1
...

So I decided to revise my skill on functional programming. I don't know if this is the right place.</p>

<p>I have two array, one of tags and one of tasks that contains tags. I'd like to aggregate the two and go out with a <code>tasksByTagName</code>. I've tried to use <a href=""https://lodash.com"" rel=""nofollow"">lodash</a> but I didn't managed to do it in a readable way so I'm posting what I've done with normal <code>for</code> statements.</p>

<p>More over I'm interested in understanding how to think in a flow based way, such as thinking my aggregate function as a transformation between two stream, as the reactive programming article linked above suggest.</p>

<p>So, let's start with datas:</p>

<pre><code>var tags = [ 
  { id: 1, name: 'Week 26' },
  { id: 2, name: 'week 27' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Week 25' },
  { id: 4, name: 'Week 25' }
];

var tasks = [
  {
    ""name"": ""bar"",
    ""completed"": false,
    ""tags"": [
      { ""id"": 1 },
      { ""id"": 2 }
    ]
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""foo"",
    ""completed"": true,
    ""tags"": [
      { ""id"": 1 }
    ]
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""dudee"",
    ""completed"": true,
    ""tags"": [
      { ""id"": 3 },
      { ""id"": 1 },
      { ""id"": 4 }
    ]
  }
];
</code></pre>

<p>And this is my piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>var _ = require('lodash');

function aggregate1(tasks, tags) {

  var tasksByTags = {};
  for(var t in tasks) {
    var task = tasks[t];
    for(var i=0; i&lt;task.tags.length; ++i) {
      var tag = task.tags[i];
      if( !tasksByTags.hasOwnProperty(tag.id) ) {
        tasksByTags[tag.id] = [];  
      }
      tasksByTags[tag.id].push(task.name);
    }
  }

  var tagById = {};
  for(var t in tags) {
    var tag = tags[t];
    tagById[tag.id] = tag.name;
  }

  var tasksByTagsName = _.mapKeys(tasksByTags, function(v, k) {
    return tagById[k];
  })

  return tasksByTagsName;
}

module.exports.aggregate1 = aggregate1;
</code></pre>

<p>For completeness, this is also the test with test data:</p>

<pre><code>var tags = [ 
  { id: 1, name: 'Week 26' },
  { id: 2, name: 'week 27' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Week 25' },
  { id: 4, name: 'Week 25' }
];

var tasks = [
  {
    ""name"": ""bar"",
    ""completed"": false,
    ""tags"": [
      { ""id"": 1 },
      { ""id"": 2 }
    ]
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""foo"",
    ""completed"": true,
    ""tags"": [
      { ""id"": 1 }
    ]
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""dudee"",
    ""completed"": true,
    ""tags"": [
      { ""id"": 3 },
      { ""id"": 1 },
      { ""id"": 4 }
    ]
  }
];

var goodResults1 = {
  'Week 26': [ 'bar', 'foo', 'dudee' ],
  'week 27': [ 'bar' ],
  'Week 25': [ 'dudee' ] 
};    



var assert = require('assert')

var aggregate1 = require('../aggregate').aggregate1;

describe('Aggegate', function(){
  describe('aggregate1', function(){
    it('should work as expected', function(){
      var result = aggregate1(tasks, tags);

    })
  })
})

"5183405","1","5183594","","2011-03-03 16:15:30","","1","205","<p>I have recently start to learn WPF + MVVM.  It is possible I have the wrong end of the stick or the wrong stick completely with the way things should be done.</p>

<p>I am trying to create a simple order app, it has order items, each order has lineitems.  There are two sections on the main page, (to start with they were both usercontrols). </p>

<p>The top is bound to the list of orders.  The bottom is bound to the currently selected order, (the idea being it will display the detail of that order).</p>

<p>The details view needs to be able to view / edit and add new items.  To this end I thought I should have two views / templates, the edit order view and the new order view / template.  During my reading I came across datatemplates and thought this would be a good way to achieve this.</p>

<p>In my mainwindow.xaml I have the list of orders view bound as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ContentControl Content=""{Binding Path=OrdersViewModel}""
</code></pre>

<p>The view is hooked up in the resources file with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type vm:AllOrdersViewModel}""&gt;
    &lt;vw:AllOrdersView /&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works great, when the app starts up they orders are displayed.  I did the same with the order detail to start with (i.e. it only had the datatype set rather than any key defined.  This worked well, if no order was selected then the view would not display, when an order was selected it would show up.</p>

<p>I am currently trying to change this to a template so that I can dynamically switch the template / view so that when they user clicked NEW order (the viewmodel has an Enum that states the current state of an order, so I would check against the enum value), the view should change.</p>

<p>If I try the following it will blow up.  The app starts, the list of orders is displayed (at this point no orders are selected), and the details view is displayed, then one of the converters will blow up due to dependencyproperty.unsetvalue, (side note, should I always check for that?).  Ideally I do not want the view to be shown until an order is selected:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ContentControl Content=""{Binding Path=OrderViewModel}"" ContentTemplate=""{StaticResource ordertemplate}"" /&gt;

   &lt;DataTemplate x:Key=""ordertemplate""&gt;
       &lt;TextBlock Text=""hello"" /&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have two questions mainly:</p>

<p>1) how would I stop the template from being displayed until it has data to display?</p>

<p>2) how could I switch the views / templates dynamically based on an enum?</p>

Always opens within the app, no browser toolbars, and no way to get back to the app without terminating it. iOS obeys <code>&lt;access origin=""http://blah"" /&gt;</code> in config.xml but Android doesn't. Neither seem to care about the <code>browserOnly=""true""</code> attribute.</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href=""http://blah"" target=""_blank""&gt;</code><br>
iPhone opens this within Safari browser if <code>&lt;access&gt;</code> allows it (or is omitted entirely), but Android opens it within the app .</p>

<p><code>&lt;preference name=""stay-in-webview"" value=""false"" /&gt;</code><br>
Adding this to config.xml makes no difference at all.</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href=""#"" onClick=""navigator.app.loadUrl('http://blah',{openExternal:true});return false;""&gt;</code><br>
Only supported in Android, where it opens the link in Chrome browser. Errors in iOS.</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href=""#"" onClick=""window.open('http://blah','_blank','location=yes');return false;""&gt;</code><br>
In Phonegap version 2.3.0 this will stay within the app but shows a cheap-looking browser toolbar at top/bottom with a button that allows you to return to the app. This is consistent...but not what I want. (In version 2.1.0 this causes Android to open within the app and iOS to open in proper browser.)</p>

<p>I am using Phonegap <strong>Build</strong> so <a href=""http://www.rigelgroupllc.com/blog/2012/05/22/opening-links-in-phonegap-apps-in-mobile-safari/"">this solution</a> will not work.<br>
The official documentation refers to <a href=""https://build.phonegap.com/blog/access-tags"">this blog post</a> which was written with reference to version 1.5.0 and my 2.1.0 to 2.3.0 findings do not match with their table.<br>
I don't really want to add a plugin for something this simple.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a single piece of code which will cause a link to open in the device's own browser, outside of the app's webview, regardless of OS?</strong></p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat startValue;
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL running;
</code></pre>

<p>It's a cascading system similar to CSS which inherits values if they're not explicitely changed. However, there is a class describing the whole state. It has to have properties for just about everything. One can change some values down in the hirarchy to override inherited ones, just by modifying some of the properties. It's a chain of instances.</p>

<p>The problem: With this design it's impossible to determine if a property is overriding a value from the ""master object"" or not.</p>

<p>I need a safe way to mark if an property has been explicitly set to something or not. For the CGFloat I could say if the value is &lt; -99999 it's not set explicitly and we simply use the value of the master object. But how about the BOOL?</p>

<p>I could also forget about properties and switch to dictionaries. They allow to iterate over keys so I can easily apply the changes only. But they're a pain in the butt to use all over the place. That's why I want a simple class where I can just set properties. Way easier to use, no ugly and heavy wrapping of values in NSNumber objects.</p>

<p>I am sure there are intelligent ways to do this.</p>

<p>Setting up a shell_exec will output information but unfortunately we are not getting the response body which is important to save data or view specific error messages.</p>

private:
  std::vector &lt; std::vector &lt;int&gt; &gt; thetable;

<p>and if in setdim : </p>

<pre><code>this-&gt;thetable.assign(1000,2);

<ol>
<li>The user buy the iPad app </li>
<li>A promotion code is generated for him, </li>
<li>User goes to buy the Mac app, he enters the promo code so he get a discount for the Mac app</li>
</ol>

<p>Question 1 :</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this scenario is possible?</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 2 :</p>

<ul>
<li>If yes, the promotion code generated when user buys the iPad app, is it a unique promotion code?  Or he will be able to give the promotion code to his friends, and these friends will get the discount on the Mac app too?</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the following scenario is the preferred scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>The users buy the Mac app via app store</li>
<li>A promotion code is generated for him</li>
<li>Users goes on iPad app store, to get the iPad application.  He enters the promo code, and he gets the iPad application for free</li>
<li><em>(Users not buying the Mac application have to pay for the iPad application)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Question 3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this preferred scenario is possible?</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 4:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Same as question number 2</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Question 5:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anybody have a better idea how to do promotion like this?  (<em>Buy Mac app and get iPad app for free etc...</em>)</li>

<p>Example: </p>

<p>&lt;2>&lt;  286><br>
        DW_AT_type                  &lt;156></p>

<p>What I want here is the 156 offset value of the type attribute of that particular DIE. </p>

<p>Do you guys know if there's any function to do this that is offered by the API?</p>

<p>NOTE: I have to stick with C, so please don't recommend any python libraries or parsing of dwarfdumped files. I am just looking for a particular function, but being trying for the last couple of days and cannot find any in the documentation.</p>

<p>But this is not working.</p>

<p>I think that I can do this:</p>

<p>How can I do that Shift+Enter whill be the same as Ctrl+Enter.</p>

<p>The Problem:
So far, when I was adding <code>UIView</code>'s to a <code>UIViewController</code> I always had to make an <code>UIViewController</code> the file's owner of the <code>UIView</code>'s .xib file to load the view with something like:</p>

<pre><code>...
//this is inside the calling UIViewController's method
// InfoView *infoView is ivar and a subclass of UIView
infoView = nil; 
NSArray *bundle = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@""InfoView""
                                                owner:self options:nil];

for (id object in bundle) {
    if ([object isKindOfClass:[InfoView class]])
        infoView = (InfoView *)object;
}   

[[self view] addSubview:infoView]; 
...
</code></pre>

<p>But I want to use the same <code>UIView</code> in many different <code>UIViewController</code>'s, so I actually don't want a file's owner except maybe the class itself. In <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5246074/uiview-subclass-with-its-own-xib"">ThomasM's question</a> he was setting the <code>UIView</code> itself to be the file's owner but without success. </p>

<p>In the answers there I found a solution to set the file's owner to nil. To do so I had to add all calling <code>UIViewController</code> objects from the Interface Builder object library to the InfoView.xib file and connect them with their <code>infoView</code> outlets.</p>

<p>But this doesn't feel right. <strong>So here I would like to collect solutions to<br>
encapsulate a <code>UIView</code> together with his xib-file to use it in many different view controllers. How do you guys handle that?</strong></p>

<p>Thx for any help.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The <code>infoView</code> is something like an overlay which appears when the user presses a button on one of the view controllers. It's NOT the View controllers ""main"" view. It gives detailed informations about the view of his superviews view controller and will disappear afterwards. I only fill the <code>infoView</code> with different contents threw out all the calling view controllers.</p>

You can then right-click and in their context menu choose <em>Open File Location</em>. This will open up one windows explorer window for each directory that the files are in, and the files will be selected for you. </p>

<p>So let's say we have a bunch of mp3 files in our library where three of them are these:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Z:\Music\Thursday Blues\01. I wish it was friday.mp3</em></li>
<li><em>Z:\Music\Counting Sheep\01. Sheep #1.mp3</em></li>
<li><em>Z:\Music\Counting Sheep\02. Sheep #2.mp3</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If we select those three (in a view where all of them are visible) and do <em>Open File Location</em> then two explorer windows will pop up. One will be the <em>Z:\Music\Thursday Blues</em> folder with <em>01. I wish it was friday.mp3</em> selected, and the other one will be the *Z:\Music\Counting Sheep** folder with both <em>01. Sheep #1.mp3</em> and <em>02. Sheep #2.mp3</em> selected.</p>

<p>How can I do this myself in C#? We have an application which is going to export data to various formats, for example CSV and Excel, and I would like to open up explorer windows with these files selected when they are created and ready to be viewed. Currently I just do <code>Process.Start(path)</code>, and this works but I would love to be able to highlight those particular files as well. Would make the files that were just created much more obvious.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Windows Media Player does it so well... I want to do it too =/ Are there any Microsoft employees here that could figure out how it can be done? (A)</p>

I wanted to see the Reaction Time (RT) significance of Related for each Prime Type level.

One of the basic ways I tried to do this is with t.test, but was only able to run it as the following code (Related for all PrimeType):</p>

I know that my current code does not handle the case where a duplicate word is at the end of one line, and at the beginning of the next line since I read each line into an ArrayList, find the duplicate, and remove it.  After writing it though, I wasn't sure if this was an 'ok' way to do it since now I don't know how to write it back out.  I'm not sure how I can keep track of the punctuation for beginning and end of line sentences, as well as the correct spacing, and when there are line returns in the original text file.  Is there a way to handle those things (spacing, punctuation, etc) with what I have so far?  Or, do I need to do a redesign?

<p>We have an application deployed on JBoss v7.1.1. It is configured to log to multiple distinct log files in the <strong>same</strong> directory. All of the them get rolled over everyday. We recently found that one of the ~5 log files never got any log lines for the past 2 weeks or so (and didn't get rolled over).</p>

<p>I did a search here and found no question having this problem; hence asking a new one.</p>

<p><strong>log4j configuration</strong>:
Configuration of one of many other loggers:</p>

<pre><code>#Concise logger
log4j.appender.ConciseLogger=org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.ConciseLogger.File=../standalone/log/xyzlog/splunk-metrics.log

log4j.appender.ConciseLogger.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} -%X{txnid}- %m%n
log4j.appender.ConciseLogger.Encoding=UTF-8
</code></pre>

<p>There are other log configurations <em>in the same configuration file</em> that log to the <strong>exact same</strong> location. The lines look like below:</p>

<pre><code>..
log4j.appender.CacheManifestLogger.File=../standalone/log/xyzlog/cacheManifest.log
..
..
log4j.appender.APPTXNLOGGER.File=../standalone/log/xyzlog/transactions.log
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problem / Details</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We have ~5 distinct log files that we log to. All get logged to the same identical folder.</li>
<li>Only <code>ConciseLogger</code> (above) stopped working from the past two weeks.</li>
<li>The exact same build works on other (non-production) machines. In a way, ""It works in my machine"" ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Guesses at what might be wrong</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Disk fills up? Nope, the disk is only 20% full</li>
<li>File Permissions? Nope, other files are being logged without issues</li>
<li>Issues with the actual code? Not likely, because things are committed to SVN, and the logging specific code has been untouched for months together. This does not explain why this has to fail just 2 weeks before.</li>
<li>Any traces of log4j specific exception in the JBoss server log? Nope, didnt find any.</li>
<li>Log4J Internals: May be it spawns a new thread for each of the category, and the thread dies for this specific category of mine.
<ul>
<li>In this case is there a way to debug this?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Log4J specific issues? See below..</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Debugging</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Used the same build, deployed to another machine -- Works - No issues with logging!</li>
<li>As per <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/12466389/227884"">@Matt b's suggestion here</a>, I tried to start JBoss with an addtional <code>-Dlog4j.debug</code>. <strong>I found the log lines for each of the categories except <code>ConciseLogging</code>. This means log4j is ignoring one single category. This is really weird.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://ideone.com/HsxJcW"" rel=""nofollow"">The lines of the output of <code>grep log4j server.log</code> has been pasted here</a>. In the entire output linked, I do not see any entry that relates to <code>ConciseLogging</code>.</p>

<p>And here is the original log4j configuration file: <a href=""http://ideone.com/wiH0VU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideone.com/wiH0VU</a></p>

<p><strong>My Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Has anyone of you experienced something of this sort before? Is this a log4j bug that it simply refuses to parse one of the many categories?
<ul>
<li>Or is this problem with the configuration file linked above? (I doubt it because it has never failed any time before)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is there any general debugging step that I can take from here?</li>
</ul>

<p>The problems are SQL queries stored as <code>.cfg</code> files (e.g. <code>problem_001.cfg</code>), and the fixers are stored as Python files (e.g. <code>fix_001.py</code>). The query config file has a reference to the Python file name. Each fixer has a single class <code>Fix</code>, which inherits from a base class <code>BaseFix</code>.</p>

<p>This doesn't happen if the AdRequest is not built and loaded. I set up my IABHelper in onCreate(), and if the user didn't buy my ""remove-ads"" sku, ads are shown. This is the code I use to load the ads:</p>

<pre><code>private void showAds() {
    int adresult = GooglePlayServicesUtil.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable(MainActivity.this);
    if (adresult == ConnectionResult.SUCCESS) {
        //if possible, show ads
        AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
                .addTestDevice(AdRequest.DEVICE_ID_EMULATOR) 
                .addTestDevice(""C144E9DA02EA7B26F74ED2C231F31D38"") 
                .addTestDevice(""93BABD84466B8C1EF529D2FB39D1ACE8"") 
                .addTestDevice(""BEAA738068664AE9BBF673E37A782E03"") 
                .addTestDevice(""E51508081F77DF84C129EE471DE67141"") 
                .build();
        adView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
        adView.loadAd(adRequest);
    } else {
        //if there's a problem, show error and close app
        GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog(adresult, MainActivity.this, 0, new DialogInterface.OnCancelListener() {
            @Override
            public void onCancel(DialogInterface dialogInterface) {
                finish();
            }
        }).show();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>adView's <code>pause()</code>, <code>resume()</code> and <code>destroy()</code> are called in the respective activity's methods. Practically, the app's performance isn't affected, but I'd rather avoid memory leaks. How do I avoid that exception?</p>

<p>The parameters dictionary contains a null entry for parameter 'page' of non-nullable type 'System.Int32' for method 'System.Web.Mvc.ActionResult VideoList(Int32)' </p>

It's also successful when I use the same for-loops right after the <code>solutions.insert</code> statement in the <code>Square</code> class' <code>fillInnRemainingOfBoard()</code> (followed by <code>Square[][] tmp = solutions.solutionsHash.get(count)</code> and the same <code>System.out.println</code> statement.</p>

<p>The problem occurs when I try to do the same from the <code>Board</code> class, as you can see in my test() method in that class. Then it just prints out the predefined values(or nothing if the board is empty). The only difference is that I then use i.e. <code>Square[][] tmp = allSquares[0][0].solutionsHash.get(wantedNumber)</code> and the same as before. But as I mentioned, I don't see why that should make a difference, when <code>solutionsHash</code> are declared static in the <code>Sudokucontainer</code>-class. </p>

<p>Any help is greatly appriciated. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The indentation got screwed up somehow, sorry about that. I haven't included the GUI part because I haven't written that and I possibly don't have permission to put it on here. Also the problem occurs before that(possibly in the <code>Board</code> class), as the same values are printed out there as from the <code>Board</code> class.</p>

<h3>Please look past the glaring design issues with having values in a varchar column that we expect to be ints.</h3>

<pre><code>create table dbo.Parent (
    Id bigint NOT NULL,
    TypeId int NOT NULL
)

create table dbo.Child (
    Id bigint NOT NULL,
    ParentId bigint NOT NULL,
    TypeId int NOT NULL,
    varcharColumn varchar(300) NULL
)

select cast(c.varcharColumn as int)
from dbo.Parent p (nolock)
    inner join dbo.Child c (nolock)
        on p.Id = c.ParentId
            and c.TypeId = 2
where p.TypeId = 13
</code></pre>

<h1>The break:</h1>

<p>We get a cast break due to a value that cannot be converted to an int.  In this case: ""123-1"".  The strange thing is that the value being cast gets filtered out of the final result set.</p>

<h2>For example, this returns zero results</h2>

<pre><code>select c.varcharColumn
from dbo.Parent p (nolock)
    inner join dbo.Child c (nolock)
        on p.Id = c.ParentId
            and c.TypeId = 2
where p.TypeId = 13
    and c.varcharColumn = '123-1'
</code></pre>

<p>The query plan ends up looking at the Child table and actually applying the cast function before the where clause.</p>

<p>We were able to fix this by creating a new index on the child table (it was doing a PK <em>scan</em>) </p>

<pre><code>create index [NCIDX_dbo_Child__TypeId] on dbo.Child (
    TypeId
)
include (
    ParentId,
    varcharColumn
)
</code></pre>

<p>It now filters on the parent table's where clause first.</p>

<p>Is there any way to fix this without the extra index?  And again, please refrain from any suggestions related to fixing our schema.  That is definitely the proper fix in this case.</p>

<p>I'm mostly interested in understanding why it applied the cast before it filtered the result set.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<h1>Edit - Answer:</h1>

<p>Many thanks to both Aaron and Gordon.  If I ever get more than 15 rep points, I'll come back and up both of your replies.</p>

<p>We ended up needing Gordon's answer since we wanted to use this query in a view.  A few folks at the office were wary of using a case statement because they prefer to have more control over ensuring that we have a smaller result set first (Aaron's answer), however it all boils down to looking at the query plan and checking your read counts.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for all of the responses!</p>

"22389906","1","","","2014-03-13 20:15:00","","0","514","<p><strong>SCENARIO:</strong> I have a custom post type with start and end dates saved as post meta. This is to allow the admin to schedule dates to show AND hide a post. There is also the option to leave these dates blank, in which case the post just shows by default. As <code>meta_query</code> doesn't appear to allow you to perform an AND/OR comparison, I've dabbled with creating a custom SQL query using $wpdb. SQL is new territory for me. Currently, this works for the start date:</p>

<pre><code>$today = date('Y-m-d');
$results = $wpdb-&gt;get_results($wpdb-&gt;prepare(""
    SELECT
        $wpdb-&gt;posts.post_title,
        $wpdb-&gt;posts.ID,
        $wpdb-&gt;posts.post_content
    FROM
        $wpdb-&gt;posts,
        $wpdb-&gt;postmeta

    WHERE
        $wpdb-&gt;posts.ID = $wpdb-&gt;postmeta.post_id
        AND $wpdb-&gt;posts.post_type = 'announcements'
        AND ($wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_key = 'sap_start_date'
            AND ($wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_value &lt;= '$today' OR $wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_value = ''))
""));
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try and amend the above to query the end date, I get nothing back. I tried changing the <code>WHERE</code> section to:</p>

<pre><code>    WHERE
        $wpdb-&gt;posts.ID = $wpdb-&gt;postmeta.post_id
        AND $wpdb-&gt;posts.post_type = 'announcements'
        AND ($wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_key = 'sap_start_date'
            AND ($wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_value &lt;= '$today' OR $wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_value = ''))
        AND ($wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_key = 'sap_end_date'
            AND ($wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_value &gt;= '$today' OR $wpdb-&gt;postmeta.meta_value = ''))
</code></pre>

<p>This returns an empty array.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How would I write this query to check both the <code>sap_start_date</code> and <code>sap_end_date</code> post meta values?</p>

<p>I have multiple charts rendering on a web page; I want to click on each of them and open a full screen version of the chart, changing the settings.</p>

<p>I started with this fiddle; but I can do it only with one chart: 
jsfiddle.net/newbiez/AeFp3/</p>

<p>When I load the page, I create multiple chart in a loop, after I process data and assign it to each chart in loops too. I tried to use the approach of the fiddle, for multiple charts, but that means call the function that build the chart X times (X is the number of charts). Probably the solution is very simple, but since I am dealing with it for so long, I can't see it.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated; tried in various ways, and now I am short of ideas.</p>

<p>So far, I've tried finding the first and last dates to determine the total number of days in the data, divide that by 10 to determine the size of each period, then resample using that number of days.  eg:</p>

<pre><code>first = df.reset_index().timesubmit.min()
last = df.reset_index().timesubmit.max()
periodsize = str((last-first).days/10) + 'D'

df.resample(periodsize,how='sum')

<p>This doesn't guarantee exactly 10 periods in the df after resampling since the periodsize is a rounded down int.  Using a float doesn't work in the resampling.  Seems that either there's something simple that I'm missing here, or I'm attacking the problem all wrong.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I can modify the TSQL script to use an un-attached database. ie a file.</p>

I would like them to run asynchronously, the first idea was to wrap it, and use switch enum to decide which function should be called. But for every method called, I needed a new method in the wrapper class and a new enum. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class QueuedShow implements InterfaceShowAlert, Runnable {
    private Class Action {
       String param1;
       public static enum ActionEnum{
          NEW, CHECK, UPDATE, DELETE, DISPLAY;
       }
       public ActionEnum todo;
       public Action(ActionEnum todo, Object param){
          this.todo=todo;
          this.param1=param;
       }
    }
    private BlockingQueue&lt;Action&gt; actionList;
    public void run(){
       while(true){
           Action action=actionList.take(); //THIS waits until queue isn't empty
           switch(action.todo){
           case NEW: //Call original function
              ....
           }
       }
    }
    public void new(String param){
       actionList.add(new Action(NEW, param));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I learned about reflection and I got a new idea. That is to invoke methods using strings instead of direct method calls.
The wrapper class reads and parses the strings, and gets the class and containing method using reflection. It puts the parameters and Method object into a class, which is put into a queue. Now the class uses Method.invoke(params) instead of using a enum to switch. But the problem of this is that compiler time type checking is lost.</p>

<p>Of course, all this works for only methods that are void, but of course we could use the Future class to return values too.</p>

<p>Now is there any framework that already has implemented turning synchronous calls to asynchronous ones, or do you know of any other method that does this.</p>

<p>1) The first takes you to the second .<br>
2) You enter a password to reach the third view controller.<br>
3) In the third the user enters a series of messages saved in an nsmutablearray.   </p>

<p>Now, I want to send the array to the first view controller. I pass through the view controllers using segues made on the storyboard.<br>
So <em>vc1</em> is <em>connected to vc2</em>, <em>vc2 to vc3</em> and <em>vc3 to vc1</em>. I tried using protocols, notification center and so on. Protocols don't work and i don't get why, notification center the data gets sent but then the array in vc1 when I try to use it, it is actually set back to nil which I also don't know why. </p>

<p>What can be done to solve this issue, I feel its a pretty straightforward implementation and shouldn't face be that complicated.</p>

<p>So this is pretty straight forward. From y reading, it might have to do with tombstones timestamps that would have somehow gotten messed up. However, it's been several days and ""now"" still hasn't caught up to the future timestamp of the tombstone. Is there any way to just reset every single timestamp of the entire cluster to 0 while activity is stopped, I can live with slightly inacurate data right now.</p>

<p>The second issue is on some of my tables. Some tables reflect changes instantly, but for others, the changes will get reflected between 30 minutes to an hour later. I can't figure out how timestamps might relate to this.</p>

<p>I've synced all nodes of my cluster using NTP, not the most precise, but won't be out of sync in the scale of days or anything. All the nodes have been synced like this from the beginning, at no point did I have wildly out of sync times.</p>

<p>Can anybody help? As I was saying, by this point I'd settle for shutting down access to the cluster and resetting all timestamps to 0, I don't care about getting some of the order wrong, I just want this thing to <em>work</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Evidently &lt;:&lt; and =:= are used to assert that two types have a subclass relationship or are equal.  But the documentation isn't clear how they're used, and searching for them is nearly impossible in Google given that they're composed entirely of symbols. (Yet one more reason why such symbol-goo names are a bad idea.)</p>

<p>Also, how does their implementation in Predef work?  I was very surprised to find out that they aren't built-ins, since I didn't realize that Scala lets you create operators that act on types in this way -- which feature in Scala lets you do this?  And the implementation in Predef is completely opaque.  Is there some compiler magic going on here?</p>

<p>I use the code above, and I got a strange photo in camera roll like photo 1.
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yjYvk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yjYvk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>but when I open the saved photo with VSCO or snapseed, I can get the normal version which was the right one I saved.</p>

<p>Is this a bug of apple's camera roll?</p>

<p>Giving the page a name causes problems because sometimes it will

<p>Background information:</p>

<p>I'm using a SL4 navigation based application here. BordPage is a navigation page,
which I'm using multiple times within the application. So giving it a name in the page itself is not really a good idea,
but I don't know how else I can bind to the width and height of the page.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is have a black border (with opacity 0.8) cover the entire screen,
(including the controls of the MainPage). Then on top of that I want to display some other controls.</p>

<p>Since the application is touch controlled, providing the user with a ComboBox to select a value doesn't really work wel. Instead I want to show this black overlay window with a listbox taking up most of the screen so the user can simply touch the value he wants with a single click.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I just realized I can use the ChildWindow class to do this.
But my original question remains.</p>

It seems like it does all previous calculations each step. Here is my code:</p>

<p>I define the map:</p>

<pre><code>      (def gradient-map
       (ref( vec (repeat columns (vec (repeat rows 0))))))

<p>Here is my update function:</p>

(defn rotate-grid-down [grid]
  (map #(concat [(first %)] (drop-last %)) grid))
(defn rotate-grid-right [grid]
  (concat [(first grid)] (drop-last grid)))
(defn rotate-grid-left [grid]
  (concat (rest grid) [(last grid)]))

(defn blur [grid]
  (let [g1 (rotate-grid-up grid)
        g2 (rotate-grid-down grid)
        g3 (rotate-grid-left grid)
        g4 (rotate-grid-right grid)]

     g1 g2 g3 g4 grid))))

<p>Then in my draw loop I blur each tic</p>

Obviously, in SQL databases, all user input needs to be encoded to prevent injection attacks. However, my understanding is that with MongoDB we need to be more worried about XSS attacks, so does user input need to be encoded on the server before being stored in mongo? Or, is it enough to simply encode the string immediately before it is displayed on the client side using a template library like handlebars?</p>

<p>Here's the flow I'm talking about:</p>

<ol>
<li>On the client side, user updates their name to ""&lt;script&gt;alert(&#x27;hi&#x27;);&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;"".
<ul>
<li>Does this need to be escaped to ""&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(&amp;#x27;hi&amp;#x27;);&amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;script&amp;gt;"" before sending it to the server?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The updated string is passed to the server in a JSON document via an ajax request.</li>
<li>The server stores the string in mongodb under ""user.name"".
<ul>
<li>Does the server need to escape the string in the same way just to be safe? Would it have to first un-escape the string before fully escaping so as to not double up on the '&amp;'?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Later, user info is requested by client, and the name string is sent in JSON ajax response.</li>
<li>Immediately before display, user name is encoded using something like _.escape(name).</li>
</ol>

<p>Would this flow display the correct information and be safe from XSS attacks? What about about unicode characters like Chinese characters?</p>

<p>This also could change how text search would need to be done, as the search term may need to be encoded before starting the search if all user text is encoded.</p>

Is it invoked every <code>x</code> milliseconds, where <code>x</code> is a configurable constant? Or is it invoked every <code>n</code> items? What happens if one processor thread is blocked waiting for a condition and <code>n</code> is not reached yet, and it's the only pending item left? Does the writer get invoked?</p>

<p>I have a case where the processor needs to wait for another item to be written to ensure processing integrity. Can I rely on the writer being invoked regardless of the situation (while a processor is waiting, blocked in the <code>process()</code> method)?</p>

<p>EDIT :</p>

<p>My problem is that some items need to be deferred when another pending item (not written yet) that meets a certain condition (can't give too much detail) is detected. The processor should wait until that other item is written. The problem occurs when the writer is waiting for the commit item count to be reached, and one or more processors are waiting for the processed items to be written which creates a deadlock. If there is a way of explicitly flushing the writer (or setting a timeout that invokes the writer even if the item count is not reached yet) my problem would be solved.</p>

<p>User A enters a chat message (using browser/client A), the message gets added to his view immediately, and it also gets sent to the server. The server sends it to user/client B for update of his view. But in the meantime user B enters a chat message, it gets added to his view immediately - there now is message B as last message in user B's chat history and message A as last message in user A's chat history. This would be an issue in many use cases, considering for example the case where people compete in a quiz and it's relevant who posted the correct answer first.</p>

<p>How does this get handled in Meteor?</p>

<p>Potential Solution (for web apps where integrity of the sequence is crucial):</p>

<p>Don't have immediate client view updates.</p>

<p>Just send the piece of data (which also is an update request) to the server who adds it to the central model and distributes it to all clients (incl the client of the user who created the piece of data).</p>

<p>Each client updates its model and view, then sends a short ""I processed the update request I got"" to the server.</p>

<p>The server waits for the last such signal (ignoring users who disconnected) [1], and then is ready for the next piece of data (the next update request). If there are items in the queue, process those first.</p>

<p>This way, whichever data piece reaches the server first wins (and wins on all clients), and the data piece that reached the server a bit later will be processed after the first one has been reflected in each client.</p>

<p>(The fact that the view update in the creator's client happens a bit later (because it the data goes through the server first) is not a huge problem I guess.)</p>

I've removed a fair amount for brevity but, let me know if I've omitted something important.</p>

<p>The service contract is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ServiceContract(Namespace:=""ImageSystem"")&gt; _
Public Interface IUploadService
    &lt;OperationContract()&gt; _
    Function UploadFile(ByVal file As ImageUpload) As ImageUpload
End Interface
</code></pre>

<p>The data contract <em>ImageUpload</em> is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MessageContract()&gt; _
Public Class ImageUpload

#Region "" Message Header ""

    Private _ImageID As Nullable(Of Long)
    &lt;MessageHeader()&gt; _
    Public Property ImageID() As Nullable(Of Long)
        Get
            Return _ImageID
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As Nullable(Of Long))
            _ImageID = value
        End Set
    End Property

    '... a few other value type properties

    ' Do not add any more members to the message body or streaming support will be disabled!

<p>The WCF Service is a service Library, which is hosted by a Web Application.  The Web Application project runs in my local IIS 7.5.  IIS has been configured to enable TCP connections, and the application pool identity is configured with relevant permissions to the contract implementation.  VS2010 is run as admin to enable debugging in IIS.</p>

<p>To test the contract implementation I have a Windows Console Application set up as a (test) client.  The client proxy classes were generated by adding a service reference to the service within the IIS host (http://localhost/ImageSystem/UploadService.svc).  The service reference is configured to generate async methods.</p>

<p>The relevant auto-generated client config is as follows (note, I've tried increasing maxBufferPoolSize, maxBufferSize, and maxReceivedMessageSize to match the servers config of ""20971520"", but to no avail):</p>

<p>The client usage is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub Test()
    Dim serviceClient As UploadService.Local.UploadServiceClient = New UploadService.Local.UploadServiceClient
    AddHandler serviceClient.UploadFileCompleted, AddressOf LocalTestCallback
    Dim ms As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream
    My.Resources.Penguins.Save(ms, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg)
    serviceClient.ClientCredentials.Windows.ClientCredential.Domain = ""MYDOMAIN""
    serviceClient.ClientCredentials.Windows.ClientCredential.UserName = ""User""
    serviceClient.ClientCredentials.Windows.ClientCredential.Domain = ""Password123""
    serviceClient.UploadFileAsync(Nothing, ..., ms, ms) '""..."" is obviously not actually here, other values omitted. ""ms"" is passed as UserState object in addition to fulfilling the 'Data' parameter
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>In case you wonder (or it matters), the penguins image is the one provided with Windows 7 in the sample pictures directory. The image is 777,835 bytes (should be within the relevant request/buffer max sizes).</p>

<p>I have tried two approaches to read the image on the server side.</p>

<p>Approach 1:</p>

<pre><code>Public Function UploadFile(ByVal file As ImageUpload) As ImageUpload Implements IUploadService.UploadFile

    Dim uploadBuffer(Helper.Settings.AppSettings(Of Integer)(""UploadBufferSize"", True) - 1) As Byte
    Dim ms As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream()
    Dim bytesRead As Integer
    Do
        bytesRead = file.Data.Read(uploadBuffer, 0, uploadBuffer.Length)
        ms.Write(uploadBuffer, 0, bytesRead)
    Loop Until bytesRead = 0

End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Approach 2:</p>

<pre><code>Public Function UploadFile(ByVal file As ImageUpload) As ImageUpload Implements IUploadService.UploadFile

    Dim reader As StreamReader = New StreamReader(file.Data)
    Dim imageB64 As String = reader.ReadToEnd
    ms = New MemoryStream(Convert.FromBase64String(imageB64))

End Function
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, ms.Length = 0.  More clearly, in the second approach, imageB64 = """" (empty string).</p>

<p>Why aren't I receiving anything from the stream?  Also, as a sneaky <em>sub-question</em>, why does the generated proxy class not provide an overload that accepts an object of type <em>ImageUpload</em>?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!!</p>

<p>At the moment this doesn't work. I run it, and tons of thread exeption errors come up. (It compiles beautifully). The first line it takes me to is </p>

<pre><code>if (used[(int)mysteryWord.charAt(cl)-65])
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what the issue is with this line. Also, the original author used the number 65. I tweaked my code and used my own variables so that I understood how it worked. But the number 65 and where it came from, I can't figure out for the life of me. Any ideas?</p>

<p>And I need to know what is causing all the thread exceptions. The GUI builds nicely. It's just all the math and triggers that mess things up. (The GUI I built all by myself! :) )</p>

That's why I experience difficulties making a Label to wrap it's text in a WizardPage. I use the following code snippet to create a wrapped label:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void createControl(Composite parent)
{
    initializeDialogUnits(parent);
    Composite composite = new Composite(parent, SWT.NONE);
    composite.setFont(parent.getFont());
    composite.setLayout(initGridLayout(new GridLayout(3, false), true));
    composite.setLayoutData(new GridData(SWT.FILL, SWT.NONE, true, false));

    Label l = new Label(composite, SWT.WRAP);
    l.setText(""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut""
                    + ""labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo""
                    + ""duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum""
                    + ""dolor sit amet."");
    l.setLayoutData(new GridData(SWT.FILL, SWT.NONE, true, false, 3, 1));

    // create other components

    setControl(composite);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As the wizard shows up, it tries to put the whole text in the single line and its window takes as much place as it needs. I think you can imagine how it looks. I get the desired result if I manually resize window to its original size, i.e. the size it would have if there would be no label. Is there a good practice for achieving this?</p>

<p>Here is what I want to do:</p>

<p>I want some links on my homepage (eg. books, authors), when user clicks them, he gets a list of books/authors.</p>

<p>Here is what I'm doing:</p>

<p>When user clicks on books, I call a dajax process. 
Inside ajax.py:</p>

<ul>
<li>I get all the books using <code>books = Book.objects.all()</code></li>
<li>I have a <code>template = ""{% for book in books %}""... blah blah blah</code></li>
<li>I render the template <code>a = Template(template).render(Context(locals()))</code></li>
<li>I do dajax assign a as innerhtml of some div tag.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this the right way to do things?
Instead of writing the template in ajax.py should I open templates from some xyz.html and then render it? Any other good, clean ways to get similar tasks done?</p>

<p>Most of solutions on the internet point to WMI class to query for printers and their properties including PrinterStatus, PrinterState.. etc.</p>

<p>However that method suffers from the problem of returning Idle status all the time (check the <a href=""http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/wmi-printerstatus-win32_printer-reliable-t2434571.html"" rel=""nofollow"">thread here</a>).</p>

<p>So is a way to use WMI to detect if printer is working or not? Or should I use another approach if any exists?</p>

An alternative way might be using PrintQueue class, but I am not sure if I can detect the exact print jobs sent by PrintDocument class whcih I am using to print.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>
I am looking at developing an iOS application that compromises of smaller portions/functionalities (lets call it mini apps just for understanding better). I am looking for guidance on how I should approach this problem to ensure that there are no potential errors in the future. Just to give you a background of my problem, I will run through some of my approach. </p>

<p><strong>First Approach</strong><br>
My initial approach was to develop and release a bunch of apps that can talk to one another. But since iOS apps can only inter-communicate with URLScheme, and which is not sufficient enough for me, I decided to revisit later and look for better solutions. </p>

<p><strong>Second Approach</strong><br>
I also looked at making the apps have a common local database, but since iOS apps are restricted only to their sandbox, this again won't work.    </p>

<p><strong>Third Approach</strong><br>
The third approach was to have an app talk to a webService and back again to the other app. </p>

<p><strong>Current Approach</strong><br>
So instead of having a bunch of apps installed on a device that can talk to one another, I am now looking at going with the approach of having only one master app that has different portions/functionalities.   </p>

<p>My problem is figuring out how to properly manage my files that are specific to the different portions/functionalities/mini Apps, so that I could independently push a portion updated files to the app and not have it corrupt the other portions.</p>

<p>Would it be a good idea to create a subfolder in the app Document directory for the different portions of the app? Are the other approaches feasible?</p>

<p>I am looking for your help, approach and feedback in tackling the problem.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I am looking for a way to distribute a library that I created, and I need to support iOS 7 and above. (Note: This will be a proprietary framework. I cannot use cocoa pods, and I also cannot distribute the source). Here is what I already know;</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS 8 introduced ""embedded frameworks"" for iOS, but, as I understand, they do not work for iOS 7, only for iOS 8 and above.</li>
<li>I have the option of distributing my library as a static library (.a file) and also distribute the headers. I know that this is a common way of dealing with the situation, but I would like to find something simpler than that (and also to bundle some resources with it, if possible).</li>
<li>I have also found that iOS 7 does not support dynamic .framework libraries (only static) because it doesn't support dynamic linking. But iOS 8 does, as well as static linking.</li>
</ul>

<p>And here are my questions regarding this information;</p>

<ul>
<li>I saw that I can create a .framework target, and make it static, by changing the Mach-O type to ""static library. Would that be enough in order to support iOS 7 without any problems, and also to distribute my library as a .framework bundle? If so, why is ""embedded frameworks"" in iOS 8 that big of a deal, as many resources on the internet are suggesting? Am I missing something?</li>
<li>Is it necessary to codesign the .framework just as I do with any other application I make?</li>
<li>What if I need to include other resources (like Core Data or Images) with my .framework file? Will I need to make a separate .bundle file for that?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have searched the Internet and Apple's documentation for answers, but the information I found did not give me a straight answer to these questions.</p>

For a systems programming course, I built a custom shell, which I have been tweaking since the end of the assignment for the purpose of hopefully replacing bash and batch as my primary scripting language.  Done in C++ in Cygwin to use unistd.h for piping, forking, etc.  Anyway, one problem I have been running into is that, when running my shell, while executables are recognized as such and run with exec(3) functions, text files (run as scripts) are passed back to bash for execution.  The obvious answer is to put the #! header in every script to redirect to my shell, but I'd like to run my shell as the default when a script is opened inside it.</p>

<p>On a slightly related note, tell me if I should ask this separately, but I'd like to be able to run my shell without starting bash beforehand.  However, I believe Cygwin starts the UNIX environment (necessary for my shell) by running <code>bash --login -i</code>
in a batch file.  Is there a possible workaround that doesn't involve running Linux (VM or otherwise)?</p>

<p>I have tried upgrading and downgrading to couple of versions in 0.20 branch from Apache , even cloudera , also deleting and installing hadoop again. But Still I am running into this issue.  Typical workarounds such as deleting *.pid files in /tmp directory is also not working. Could anybody point me to solution for this?</p>

<p>This is a hobby home automation project (Windows 8.1, .NET 4.5.1), where I supply a C# callback to an unmanaged 3rd party DLL. The callback gets invoked upon a certain sensor event.</p>

<p>To handle the event, I use <code>async/await</code> and a simple custom awaiter (rather than <code>TaskCompletionSource</code>). I do it this way partly to reduce the number of unnecessary allocations, but mostly out of curiosity as a learning exercise.</p>

<p><strong>I managed to suppress the collection of <code>awaiter</code> with this line:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var hold = GCHandle.Alloc(awaiter);
</code></pre>

<p>However I don't fully understand why I have to create a strong reference like this. The <code>awaiter</code> is referenced inside an endless loop. AFAICT, it is not going out of scope until the task returned by <code>TestAsync</code> becomes completed (cancelled/faulted). And the task itself is referenced inside <code>Main</code> forever.</p>

<p>Eventually, I reduced <code>TestAsync</code> to just this:</p>

<pre><code>static async Task TestAsync()
{
    var awaiter = new Awaiter();
    //var hold = GCHandle.Alloc(awaiter);

    var i = 0;
    while (true)
    {
        await awaiter;
        Console.WriteLine(""tick: "" + i++);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The collection still takes place. I suspect the whole compiler-generated state machine object is getting collected. <strong>Can someone please explain why this is happening?</strong></p>

<p>Now, with the following minor modification, the <code>awaiter</code> no longer gets garbage-collected:</p>

<pre><code>static async Task TestAsync()
{
    var awaiter = new Awaiter();
    //var hold = GCHandle.Alloc(awaiter);

    var i = 0;
    while (true)
    {
        //await awaiter;
        await Task.Delay(500);
        Console.WriteLine(""tick: "" + i++);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>, <a href=""http://dotnetfiddle.net/pWaoN1"">this fiddle</a> shows how the <code>awaiter</code> object gets garbage-collected without any p/invoke code. I think, the reason might be that <strong>there is no external</strong> references to <code>awaiter</code> <strong>outside the initial state</strong> of the generated state machine object. I need to study the compiler-generated code.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>, here's the compiler-generated code (for <a href=""http://dotnetfiddle.net/pWaoN1"">this fiddle</a>, VS2012). Apparently, the <code>Task</code> returned by <code>stateMachine.t__builder.Task</code> doesn't keep a reference to (or rather, a copy of) the state machine itself (<code>stateMachine</code>). Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Now if I change <code>Console.WriteLine(InheritInstance.name); // the name field</code> to <code>Console.WriteLine(InheritInstance.Name); // the name property</code>, it magically outputs: ""I am Base""</p>

<p>I am baffled as to WHY this happens? I called the <code>Name</code> property of <code>MyInheritedClass</code>, how did the <code>Name</code> property of <code>MyClass</code> get called? Or maybe the <code>Name</code> property of <code>MyClass</code> is called and it somehow magically accesses the name field of <code>MyClass</code>?</p>

---Also,  if I change the line to ""using CsCta.CtasqlModel;"" (change in case) then I get the zillion build errors; when I change it back to the right case ""using CsCta.CtaSqlModel;"" then I get that one build error.  So the offending using statement is being recognized, sort of.</p>

Specifically, I have multiple activities (some of these are run via an intent from another app, so it's easier this way than having a single activity with multiple fragments). Inside of each of these activities, there might be multiple fragment views.</p>

<p>The problem is that it appears that the action bar is actually being placed over the content. For example, in one of my activity views:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/G39P5.png"" alt=""first activity""></p>

<p>That activity happens to have a view pager, which isn't always the case, and the behavior is exhibited even on activities that don't have the viewpager. For example, on the following activity layout, there should be another item at the top called ""Referee"", which is completely obstructed from view by the actionbar:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/njwG0.png"" alt=""second activity""></p>

<p>I know that this method is a hack to begin with, and I'd rather use the method described here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26440879/how-do-i-use-drawerlayout-to-display-over-the-actionbar-toolbar-and-under-the-st"">How do I use DrawerLayout to display over the ActionBar/Toolbar and under the status bar?</a> However, one of the drawbacks to this is that it appears that I would have to reimplement my app as a single <code>Activity</code> with multiple <code>Fragment</code>s. We have something like 8 or 9 activities launchable from the navigation drawer, (in addition to the aforementioned navigation via an intent, which seems to be easier to accomplish with separate activities), and I'd rather not refactor all of them (if possible) to just be individual fragments yet. (That is the eventual plan... maybe... but right now, I'm trying to redo an isolated part of the navigation drawer). Additionally, it seems that using the newer v7 appcompat library (we're using <code>19.0.1</code>) means that we'd have to get rid of the styles that derive from <code>Holo</code>. This isn't a big deal, as we're probably going to do this anyway, but it would be nice if I knew that doing that change would actually work with the navigation drawer in the way that I want before I go through the work to accomplish that. :|</p>

<p>I do have a bit more code that isn't shown here, for the sake of simplicity and self-containedness. I can show that if it would be of help, but I'm thinking there's something I'm doing incorrectly in either <code>NavigationDrawerActivity</code> or <code>navigation_drawer.xml</code>.</p>

<p>I did try to add some padding in for the action bar, as recommended in the original post, but when I do that (inside of <code>moveDrawerToTop()</code>, I get something like the following:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Drqy.png"" alt=""activity with padding""></p>

<p>The code I modified to accomplish this is here:</p>

<h2>getActionBarHeight Method</h2>

<p>Taken from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12301510/how-to-get-the-actionbar-height"">How to get the ActionBar height?</a></p>

<pre><code>  private int getActionBarHeight() {
    int actionBarHeight = 0;
    TypedValue tv = new TypedValue();
    if (getTheme().resolveAttribute(android.R.attr.actionBarSize, tv, true))
    {
      actionBarHeight = TypedValue.complexToDimensionPixelSize(tv.data,getResources().getDisplayMetrics());
    }

    return actionBarHeight;
  }
</code></pre>

<h2>moveDrawerToTop() method</h2>

<pre><code>  private void moveDrawerToTop() {
    ViewGroup decor = (ViewGroup) getWindow().getDecorView();
    View child = decor.getChildAt(0);
    decor.removeView(child);

    // We then replace the first child of the decor view with our navigation drawer, offset by the
    // status bar height.
    LinearLayout container = (LinearLayout) mDrawerLayout.findViewById(R.id.drawer_content);
    container.setPadding(0, getActionBarHeight(), 0, 0);
    container.addView(child, 0);
    mDrawerLayout.findViewById(R.id.drawer_list).setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);
    decor.addView(mDrawerLayout);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>It appears to be setting the padding to the wrong item in the display tree, so it's possible that's my problem (well, aside from using this hack to do this).</p>

One of the requirements of the project is to export to PDF format, and currently doing so to disk is working just fine.  The question was raised, however, if it's possible to export the file to a stream and open it directly in the native viewer on the client, skipping entirely writing it to disk.  I know that this is somewhat possible with ASP.Net through the use of Response.Write() headers and the like, but I need to try to do this with standard WinForms/WPF, and I've exhausted my own ideas for it.  Anybody have any insight on how it might be done, if it's possible at all?  Or does the file have to be written to disk first, then opened separately?</p>

<p>It's current state</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/6iEWuBTl.png"" alt=""screenshotOfCode""></p>

<p>This is so close to what I wish to achieve. I just need the <code>@+id/contactPicture</code> (the red guy) to be to the left of the <code>@+id/body</code> (the text); this goes for my picture, <code>@+id/myPicture</code>, except it needs to be on the right of the <code>@+id/body</code> text. I don't know why the <code>gravity</code> and <code>layout_gravity</code> aren't working.</p>

<p>I'm really close to perfecting this layout; I've been working almost 12 hours on this layout today, and probably far more than that if you total up this week's work. I really appreciate any and all help.</p>

<p><strong>This is what I'm going for</strong></p>

Everything seems to be working fine apart from one small bit. The CSS is being loaded, but the <code>UIWebView</code> ignores the line-height CSS attribute. Font sizes are being picked up correctly </p>

<p>My body CSS is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>body {
    color: #333;
    text-align: centre;
    padding: 0;
    font: 0.75em/0.8em ""Lucida Grande"", Lucida, Verdana, sans-serif;
    margin: 0 0 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried adding a specific <code>line-height: 80%;</code> line, but it makes no difference. <code>UIWebView</code> renders the text in exactly the same way if I set the lien-height to 0.8em or 1.5em!</p>

<p>The HTML displays correctly when I load it in Safari on my Mac, so I presume the HTNML is ok, and other the text is not inheriting from other CSS statements. I'm lost as to what could be wrong.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Take 1</strong> (wikipedia): all threads are allowed to modify shared memory, but every read and write within the transaction is logged.  At the end of the transaction the system checks that other threads have not concurrently made changes to memory.  If no changes were made, transaction is committed.  Otherwise, transaction is restarted.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q: If this is a valid implmentation, then it seems useless to allow two threads to execute within the same transaction.  They will read each other's writes and the computation within the transaction block will be malformed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Take 2</strong> (can't find source): When a program enters transaction, it gets a copy of all variables contained within and can go to town on them.  At the end of the transaction the system tries to update the master with the copy.  If the master hasn't changed since the copy was first made, then the transaction is committed.  Otherwise, transaction is restarted.</p>

<p>Also, what happens when two threads enter the same transaction at the same time?  Doesn't this cause a race condition of sorts?  Since both are attempting to modify the same shared memory, both will need to be restarted and the issue continue ad infinitum unless the system steps in and tell one thread to cool it (sort of like a lock =)  I'm sure I'm missing a concept here.</p>

"18541688","1","","","2013-08-30 21:25:37","","4","863","<p>I'm dealing with boolean functions of which I can only (but safely) assume that they come in as a SOP and contain no negations (e.g. <em>(A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C) || (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; D)</em>). The number of disjunctions is usually > 5, the number of conjunctions within usually > 10.  </p>

<p>Because in my case computing the value of each variable is hard and the result is to be <strong>considered ephemeral</strong>, I need to be able to minimize said functions with respect to variable occurrence. The result of this minimization does not need to be in any normal form and is allowed to be nested arbitrarily deep.  </p>

<p>Having asked a similar question before, SO <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18474607"">points</a> to general solutions using fanout-minimization, Karnough maps, QM or BDDs. Before dealing with these approaches - which would blow up my code extensively - I'd like to double-check if the a priori known facts about the input function do not yield the possibility to use a smaller though less general approach of minimization.</p>

<p>AFAICS applying the absorption and distributivity laws will always provide the minimal form. Is there a possibility to exploit the fact that the functions come in as SOPs and have no negations? It appears to me that there should be a recursive algorithm of simple intersection- and union-operations on the variables that will yield the desired result.</p>

<p>Can one describe that algorithm?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Request for comments: Having done some research on the topic, it appears to me that the question asked here is equivalent to finding the optimal variable ordering of the reduced BDD of the given functions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Background: The minimized function is passed on to a job queue to figure out the value of all required variables. The function is evaluated afterwards. Consider the application examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The input function  <em>(A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C) || (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; D)</em> can be written as <em>A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; (C || D)</em>, which eliminates having to evaluate <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> twice. Evaluation of <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> is serialized in the job queue because only one of them needs to be proven true.</li>
<li><em>(A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C) || (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C &amp;&amp; D)  || (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; X &amp;&amp; E)</em> is reduced to <em>A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; (C || (X &amp;&amp; E))</em>.

<p>Multi Tenant Environment - Multiple Membership providers, 1 DB per Tenant, One Single Application on Azure...</p>

<p>Question is quite straightforward:</p>

<p>Can Asp.net membership provider be configured like this? Any clues on how?</p>

<p>Now you guys know the question, lets head to the details...</p>

<p>This stack is supposed to run on Azure, with SQL Azure for persistent data, and ASP.net membership, MVC4, EF5, and some eye candy stuff...</p>

<p>The challenge consists in:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a multi-tenant environment running a single App in Azure (worker roles and web roles, but NOT tenant-specific or oriented);</p></li>
<li><p>One to One isolation of databases (one database per tenant);</p></li>
<li><p>One Asp.net Membership running in each database, in order to authenticate and authorize the users created by each tenant;</p></li>
<li><p>One main database, holding shared data and a main Asp.net Membership, where only admin users (main site admins and tenant admins) login...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Important to say that all databases have exactly the same structure, except for the main one... </p>

<p>Don't know if helps, but the stack also includes MVC4, EF5 (DB First approach);</p>

<p>Actually, I was considering to use the MVC route mechanism to collect tenant identification, and then setting up a specific Db Context, where all operations should apply;</p>

<p>Any ideas? </p>

<p>The author contends that while people can and often do have various components to their name (middle initial, first name, etc), it is pointless and frustrating to anticipate how to store them all, unless you have a clear search requirement to do so. Instead, he says to make one attribute mandatory, the Surname, and store everything else in the ""RestOfName"".</p>

<p>Whether you like the idea or not, the question I have here is about the PK NameFunction in the model below (the image quality is poor, I know). I am guessing, since it isn't discussed, that it is a way to format and parse the RestOfName.</p>

<p>Have you ever stored a function, literally? I can see how it makes sense in the object model, but I can't picture it a data.</p>

<p>How would you store a function as data?</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
Berryl</p>

<p>p.s. extra credit if you can figure out what that last attribute is. I would say Salutation although that seems to be contrary to the author's point</p>

The alarm triggers a service. When the service launches a Notification, I can click the Notification and start the main Activity, which is responsible for setting the alarm in the first place. This works as expected.</p>

<p>Here ist the code from my alarmService.js</p>

<pre><code>var service = Ti.Android.currentService;
var serviceIntent = service.getIntent();
Ti.Android.stopService (serviceIntent);

var activity = Ti.Android.currentActivity;
var intent = Ti.Android.createIntent({
    action : Ti.Android.ACTION_MAIN,
    className : 'com.myApp.alarmtest.AlarmTestActivity',
    flags : Ti.Android.FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED | Ti.Android.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP
});
intent.addCategory(Titanium.Android.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER);

var pending  = Ti.Android.createPendingIntent({
    activity : activity,
    intent : intent,
    type : Ti.Android.PENDING_INTENT_FOR_ACTIVITY,
    flags : Ti.Android.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY
});

var cfg = {
    contentIntent : pending,
    contentTitle : 'Alarm!',
    contentText : 'Jupiiee',
    tickerText : 'Juppiee',
    when : new Date().getTime(),
    icon : Ti.App.Android.R.drawable.appicon,
    flags : Titanium.Android.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL | Titanium.Android.FLAG_SHOW_LIGHTS | Titanium.Android.FLAG_INSISTENT
};

var notification = Ti.Android.createNotification(cfg);

Ti.Android.NotificationManager.notify (1, notification);

Ti.Media.vibrate([0,100,200,100,100,100,100,100,200,100,500,100,225, 100]);
</code></pre>

<p>But I would like to start the Activity without the Notification. When the alarm starts the service, the service should launch/relaunch the Activity without user interaction. </p>

<p>My alarm is triggered at the right time, the vibration works fine, the debugger tells me, that the activity is started, but nothing changes on my phone (I am testing on device). I do not get any errors, but the app is not started or put into the foreground. [Edit] Before the alarm starts I go to the home-screen.</p>

<p>Here ist the changed code of my alarmService.js</p>

<pre><code>var service = Ti.Android.currentService;
var serviceIntent = service.getIntent();
Ti.Android.stopService (serviceIntent);

var activity = Ti.Android.currentActivity;
var intent = Ti.Android.createIntent({
    action : Ti.Android.ACTION_MAIN,
    className : 'com.myApp.alarmtest.AlarmTestActivity',
    flags : Ti.Android.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Ti.Android.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP
});
intent.addCategory(Titanium.Android.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER);

Ti.Android.currentActivity.startActivity(intent);

Ti.Media.vibrate([0,100,200,100,100,100,100,100,200,100,500,100,225, 100]);
</code></pre>

<p>Is it even possible to do this? I spent the last 4 days reading through the docs and stackoverflow and many threads, but most of them concern themeselves with starting an activity from Notifications. Also I am new to App Developement although I am a proficient Web-Developer.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and input! </p>

But the times it does not work is because of a character in the downloaded file that my script, as it is, does not like.  For example, here's the error I got today: <code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 379-381: ordinal not in range(128)</code>.  I downloaded the file another way and here's the character at position 380 which I believe is responsible for stopping my script, ""∞"".  And, here's the place in my script where it chokes:</p>

<pre><code>##### request file

r = requests.get('https://resources.example.com/requested_file.csv')

##### create the database importable csv file

ld = open('/requested_file.csv', 'w')
print(r.text, file=ld)
</code></pre>

<p>I know this probably has to do with encoding the file somehow before printing it to the .csv file, and is probably a simple thing for someone who knows what they are doing but, after many hours of research, I'm about to cry.  Thanks for your help in advance!</p>

<p>What I have is a text string given by a user that can basically be anything. I split the string by newline characters, <code>""\n""</code>, so I differentiate between ideas in the text. I want to put each idea into a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, and have each span be spaced from the left side of the screen using <code>left: number-of px</code>. The problem I am running into is that I want the spacing to be dependent on the number of underscores starting out each idea. So if one idea is <code>""_Blah blah""</code>, the css should be <code>left: 5px</code>, and if the idea is <code>""__Blah blah""</code>, the css should be <code>left: 10px</code>.</p>

<p>Right now my code picks out the number of underscores at the beginning of each idea and creates a className in the span that the idea will be put into.</p>

<p>I know this is doable by having lots of css properties like this:</p>

<pre><code>.lvl1-1 {
    left: 0px;
}
.lvl1-2 {
    left: 5px;
}
.lvl1-3 {
    left: 10px;
}
... and so on
</code></pre>

<p>But because the text is unknown, and there may be infinite levels and sub-levels, I would appreciate it if I could have some css field or something that will auto-increment the left property depending on the className. Is this possible? Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Let's suppose I do have the following collection:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; db.fred.find()
{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""...""), ""record"" : 1, ""time"" : ISODate(""2011-12-01T00:00:00Z"") }
{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""...""), ""record"" : 2, ""time"" : ISODate(""2011-12-02T00:00:00Z"") }
{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""...""), ""record"" : 3, ""time"" : ISODate(""2011-12-03T00:00:00Z"") }
{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""...""), ""record"" : 4, ""time"" : ISODate(""2011-12-04T00:00:00Z"") }
{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""...""), ""record"" : 5, ""time"" : ISODate(""2011-12-05T00:00:00Z"") }
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like is retrieving, in time order, the 2 records previous to ""record"": 4 plus record 4 (i.e. record 2, record 3 and record 4)</p>

<p>Naively I was about running something along:</p>

<pre><code>db.fred.find({time: {$lte: ISODate(""2011-12-04T00:00:00Z"")}}).sort({time: -1}).limit(2).sort({time: 1})
</code></pre>

<p>but it does not work the way I expected:</p>

<pre><code>{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""...""), ""record"" : 1, ""time"" : ISODate(""2011-12-01T00:00:00Z"") }
{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""...""), ""record"" : 2, ""time"" : ISODate(""2011-12-02T00:00:00Z"") }
</code></pre>

<p>I was thinking that the result would have been record 2, record 3 and 4.</p>

<p>From what I recollected, it seems that the 2 sort does apply before limit:</p>

<pre><code>  sort({time: -1})                          =&gt; record 4, record 3, record 2, record 1
  sort({time: -1}).limit(2)                 =&gt; record 4, record 3
  sort({time: -1}).limit(2).sort({time: 1}) =&gt; record 1, record 2
</code></pre>

<p>i.e it's like the second sort was applied to the cursor returned by find (i.e. the whole set) and then only, the limit is applied.</p>

<p>What is my mistake here and how can I achieve the expected behavior?</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: When I try to consume the service from my local C# app, it fails when accessing the database. The DataMapper throws an exception saying it can't connect to the DB. But hold on a second! If I go into my browser and fire up the Silverlight app and then try my local C# app again, it works.</p>

<p>My initial thought was that there was some authentication issues (service uses Windows authentication, but database connection uses SQL Server authentication through a connection string), but I'm not sure this explains why starting the Silerlight app makes the rest of the stack operational. I've included some more data below about the environment in which I'm working.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Architecture</strong>: On our app server (Windows Server 2003), we have a Silverlight app and a WCF service upon which the Silverlight app relies running in the same virtual directory (both IIS-hosted). The IIS application is configured to use Windows Authentication for service access. The backend is a SQL Server instance on a separate db server. On my development box, I'm working on an app that needs to consume the aforementioned WCF service.</p>

<pre><code>{
    author:[
        ""Invalid pk '544bf461438b4c5c3943c909' - object does not exist.""
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>The request:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""title"" : ""Post Title 3"",
    ""content"" : ""Post content"",
    ""post_type"" : ""post"",
    ""featured_image"" : ""slug-featured"",
    ""gallery_images"" : ""slug-gallery"",
    ""author"" : ""544c7adc438b4c6220fd1508""
}
</code></pre>

<p>The author pk is included in the request but I've also attempted retrieving it as a url parameter.</p>

<p>Another interesting quirk is that when I try my 'get_user' url, my return for the same (valid, copied straight from mongodb) pk is:</p>

<pre><code>{
    username: """",
    email: """",
    is_staff: false,
    last_login: null
}
</code></pre>

<p>But when I bypass the DJRF serializer and just return user.username (or any other attribute), the response successfully returns the user's username. This makes me think that I'm setting up my serializers incorrectly for what I'm trying to do, or I'm passing data to them incorrectly. I'm stumped trying to figure out where I'm going wrong.</p>

<p>Relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
pk = serializers.Field()

    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = (
            'pk', 'author', 'title',
            'content', 'post_type', 'featured_image',
            'gallery_images', 'created_on')

class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
pk = serializers.Field()

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = (
            'pk', 'username', 'email',
            'is_staff', 'created_on', 'last_login'
        )
</code></pre>

<p>Post Model:</p>

<pre><code>class Post(models.Model):
    # Etc..
    author = models.ForeignKey(User)
    # Etc..
</code></pre>

<p>User Model:</p>

<pre><code>class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    password = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    email = models.EmailField()
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    # Django fields for users:
    is_staff = models.BooleanField()
    is_active = models.BooleanField()
    last_login = models.DateTimeField()
</code></pre>

<p>The view in question:</p>

<pre><code>@api_view(['POST'])
def post_post(request, user_id):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if (request.DATA.get('post_type').lower() == 'gallery'):
            gallery_files = request.DATA.get('gallery_images')
        else:
            gallery_files = ''

        user = User.objects.get(pk=user_id)
        data = {
            'title' : request.DATA.get('title'),
            'author' : user.pk,
            'content' : request.DATA.get('content'),
            'post_type' : request.DATA.get('post_type'),
            'featured_image' : request.DATA.get('featured_image'),
            'gallery_images' : gallery_files,
        }

        serializer = PostSerializer(data=data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_created)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
    else:
        return 'Method not allowed'
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: So I finally got some time to play around with this issue some more. Setting the author to an optional field and sending a request where author was null resulted in a successful request. So I went further and changed the ForeignKey relation between Post and User (just a CharFeld now) and was able to send a successful request again (with the author pk properly set, no less). So now my question is, how do I overcome the issue with the serializer and using models that are related in this way?</p>

The assignment includes communication over ideal connections (that do not lose or corrupt data) and connections that do corrupt the data. I would like to make this as modular as possible, but I can't figure out how to do it (everything seems so intertwined). Here's a list of things I have to do:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sliding window</strong>. This task assumes a perfect connection. However, I would like to abstract away this detail (implement the sliding window code such that handling the quality of the connection is some other module's responsibility).</li>
<li><strong>Go-Back-N</strong> protocol for an imperfect connection. Here I would like to reuse code from the previous task that involved sliding windows.</li>
<li><strong>Selective repeat</strong>. This sounds like it should replace the Go-Back-N module, while still working on top of the sliding window module.</li>
<li><strong>Error detection</strong>. This one looks like it should be independent of whether I use sliding windows, Go-Back-N or selective repeat. Yet, I can't figure out how to separate error checking from message receiving.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I can implement a layered architecture (inspired by the OSI model), but I'm not sure how to do it. I need a nudge in the right direction.</p>

<p>How should these different modules interact with each other? Such that Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat function independently of whether I want to fill the data link (sliding window) or not, and such that error checking is done on top of all of this, transparently.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> One other difficulty is that some protocols (Go-Back-N, Selective Repeat, Sliding Window) require state particular to that protocol and there's no nice way to implement stateful functions in C.</p>

The main key for interacting with the data in this system is made up of 2 uuids. The combination of uuids is guaranteed to be unique, but neither of the individual uuids is.</p>

<p>I see a couple of ways of managing this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use an object for the primary key that is made up of 2 values (as suggested <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7225657/13181"">here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Use a standard auto-generated mongo object id as the primary key, store my key in two separate fields, and then create a composite index on those two fields</p></li>
<li><p>Make the primary key a hash of the 2 uuids</p></li>
<li><p>Some other awesome solution that I currently am unaware of</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What are the performance implications of these approaches? </p>

<p>For option 1, I'm worried about the insert performance do to having non sequential keys. I know this can kill traditional RDBMS systems and I've seen indications that this could be true in MongoDB as well.</p>

<p>For option 2, it seems a little odd to have a primary key that would never be used by the system. Also, it seems that query performance might not be as good as in option 1. In a traditional RDBMS a clustered index gives the best query results. How relevant is this in MongoDB?</p>

<p>For option 3, this would create one single id field, but again it wouldn't be sequential when inserting. Are there any other pros/cons to this approach?</p>

<p>For option 4, well... what is option 4?</p>

<p>Also, there's some discussion of possibly using CouchDB instead of MongoDB at some point in the future. Would using CouchDB suggest a different solution?</p>

  var dateTimeNullable1 = nullableDateTime.HasValue ? nullableDateTime : DateTime.Now;
  var dateTimeNullable2 = nullableDateTime != null ? nullableDateTime : DateTime.Now;
  var dateTimeWhatType = nullableDateTime ?? DateTime.Now;

<p>In all cases, I assign <code>nullableDateTime</code> to the new variable. I would expect the type of all variables to become <code>DateTime?</code> since that is the type of <code>nullableDateTime</code>. But to my surprise, the type of <code>dateTimeWhatType</code> just becomes <code>DateTime</code>, so not nullable.</p>

<p>To make things worse, ReSharper suggests to replace the second statement with a null coalescing expression, turning it into expression 3. So if I let ReSharper do its thing, the type of the variable will change from <code>DateTime?</code> to <code>DateTime</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, let's say that in the remainder of the method, I would use</p>

<pre><code>if (someCondition) dateTimeNullable2 = null;
</code></pre>

<p>That would compile just fine, until I let ReSharper replace the second expression with the null coalescing version.</p>

<p>AFAIK, replacing </p>

<pre><code>somevar != null ? somevar : somedefault;

<p>with </p>

<pre><code>somevar ?? somedefault;

<p>should indeed produce the same result. But for implicit typing on a nullable type, the compiler seems to threat <code>??</code> as if it means.</p>

<pre><code>somevar != null ? somevar.Value : somedefault;
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess my question is why the implicit type is changed when I use <code>??</code>, and also where in the documentation I could find info on this.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>For my purpose, I would like to compute a weight as reciprocal of a distance for something like inverse distance weighting interpolation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting). </p>

<pre><code>double wgt = 0, wgt_tmp, result = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++)
{
   wgt_tmp = 1.0/dist[i];
   wgt += wgt_tmp;
   result += wgt_tmp * values[i];
}
results /= wgt;
</code></pre>

<p>However the distance can be 0 and I need to make the weight suitable for computation. If there is only one distance dist[i] is 0, I would like its corresponding value values[i] to be dominant. If there are several distances are 0, I would like to have their values to contribute equally to the result. Any idea how to implement it?</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>A System.ArgumentException is thrown at when <code>WriteToServer()</code> is called with the message ""<code>Value does not fall within the expected range</code>"".
The stack trace is interesting in that it looks like the Sybase DLL cannot resolve the DB columnn name using the index provided in the mapping, which seems odd:</p>

<pre><code>   at Sybase.Data.AseClient.AseBulkCopy.GetDBColName(String clientColName, Int32 clientColInx)
   at Sybase.Data.AseClient.AseBulkCopy.GenerateInsertCmdByReaderMetaInfo(DataTable rowFmt)
   at Sybase.Data.AseClient.AseBulkCopy.WriteToServer(IDataReader reader)
</code></pre>

<p>I have followed the same process for Sybase > Sql Server (pretty much line by line, but with the relevant DLLs switched) and this works.</p>

<p>To make the line I put a UIView within the cell. I made the line in a separate class makeLine.swift using drawRect and designated this as the class for the view. </p>

<p><strong>Issue 1:</strong> I want to change the color of the line depending on the TableRownumber. I have made an outlet for the UIView in the customCell class. I am guessing something needs to be done in cellForRowIndexPath method - but not sure what and how. I don't want to use an existing image for the line</p>

<p>Below is the code for making the line:
    class LoginLine1: UIView {</p>

<pre><code>override func drawRect(rect: CGRect) {
    let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()
    CGContextSetLineWidth(context, 2.0)
    let colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB()
    let components: [CGFloat] = [107.0/255.0, 107.0/255.0, 107.0/255.0, 1.0]
    let color = CGColorCreate(colorSpace, components)
    CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(context, color)
    CGContextMoveToPoint(context, 0, 0)
    CGContextAddLineToPoint(context, 70, 0)
    CGContextStrokePath(context)
}
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Issue 2</strong> once this line is made, I want to make it tapable and segue to next viewController. I have added tapGestureRecognizer to the UIView (which has the line). I have also enable User Interaction. The tap function is the following - but somehow its not working</p>

The data I need can be simply retrieved using a secure URL and the response is in XML/json. I just need to display the data in a nice format (colors/graphs) and allow the rest of my team to use it too.</p>

<p>I have freedom over whatever way I choose to write or host the app (any language, web/local app). I thought that the simplest way was to write a html/javascript file that simply sends ajax requests to the server. I realized this was not possible due to cross origin requests and also SSL not being enabled.</p>

<p>Building a web app for a simple script seems ridiculous (server to server requests??) What should I do? will a local script/app be more appropiate? </p>

<p>Sample REST http request:</p>

<pre><code>https://mynetworkappliance:12345/somequerystring
</code></pre>

<p>Response:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""data"" : 1234567,
    ""string"" : ""someStringIwannaMakePretty""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind the person using it needs to type in username and password to authenticate with the network appliance over HTTPS, before any data is returned. 
Suggestions will really be appreciated!</p>

I think I will need a framework like Phonegap to port the app. After porting one html page to Android it seems to take a bit of time before the page is rendered. The screen turns to black screen, which, I guess is due to the reason that Webview is being loaded with the html file. All html files are placed in assets only. Can someone let me know the way of using webview where the black screen is not shown?</p>

<p>Also, I have been trying to search for some examples with jquery - phonegap with multiple pages. By multiple pages I mean there may be different activities for different html files. Can someone point me point me to proper tutorial or example of doing this?</p>

<p>I have seen that the facebook app for Android and iPhone is more or like the same which makes me feel that it may also be html5 app with some native ui used. Even I would like a mixture of native UI elements at some place and html5 functionality at some place.</p>

Some of these partial-pages call their own unique <em>javascript</em> files. While the transitions between pages work well, remnants of executed <em>javascript</em> remain active after the partial page that called it has been dynamically replaced.</p>

<p><strong>How can I unload <em>javascript</em> that was introduced with a dynamic page load, and later asynchronously replaced by another page?</strong></p>

<p><br></p>

<h1><em>The finer details</em></h1>

<h2>Master template</h2>

<p>My <strong>master template</strong> (used for all pages) can be thought of as a simple:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    //scripts to manage asynchronous loading of partial-pages into #content div
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=""content""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>User profile</h2>

<p>One partial page that renders inside the <strong>#content</strong> div is for a user's <strong>Profile</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""profile.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;input type=""file"" name=""profile-picture""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The contents of <strong>profile.js</strong> are similar to:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('input').change(function() {
        // upload profile picture asynchronously
    });
});
</code></pre>

<h2>User settings</h2>

<p>Another partial page that is loaded inside the <strong>#content</strong> div of the <strong>master template</strong> is the user's <strong>Settings</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""settings.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""first-name""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""last-name""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The contents of <strong>settings.js</strong> are similar to:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    setInterval(function() {
        // auto-submit form every 10 seconds
        $('form').submit();
    }, 10000);
}
});
</code></pre>

<h2>The problems</h2>

<ul>
<li>Certain <em>javascript</em> functions continue to run (e.g. <strong>setInterval</strong>) after the partial page that called them has been replaced by another.</li>
<li>This business of loading new <em>javascript</em> for each partial page feels messy; but for the life of me, I can't find any recommendations for best practices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the better way to achieve this effect of dynamic partial-page loading/unloading while allowing page-specific scripts for each partial page?</strong></p>

<p>At present the login functionality is working, and users are denied unless logged in but the specific roles are not being taken into account. I have an object stored in session of all of the user data across the site, but ""roles"" is completely ignored in the web config.</p>

<p>How I'm attempting to do this is to create a Path object that combines the triangle with the other shape (round rect).</p>

<p>I'm doing it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Path path = new Path();
// Create triangular segment

Point drawOffset = getAttributes().getDrawOffset();
int leaderGap = getAttributes().getLeaderGapWidth();

// Recall that we have a coordinate system where (0,0) is the
// bottom midpoint of the annotation rectangle.

// the point to left of gap
int x1 = -leaderGap/2;
int y1 = 0;

// the point to right of gap
int x2 = leaderGap/2;
int y2 = 0;

// The point where we're drawing to; the end of the pointy segment of triangle
int x3 = -drawOffset.x;
int y3 = drawOffset.y;

path.moveTo(x2, y2);
path.lineTo(x3, y3);
path.lineTo(x1, y1);
// path.close();


// Add the rectangular portion to the path
path.addRoundRect(backgroundShape, 5, 5, Path.Direction.CW);
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the roundRect is a closed path, so its edge shows through underneath the triangular section.</p>

<p>A picture's worth a thousand words, so here you go:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yLcYq.png"" alt=""Rounded balloon""></p>

<p>What I want is for the line segment between those two endpoints of the triangle to disappear, so that it looks like one seamless path.</p>

<p>If all I were doing were a straight rectangle, I could create the whole path myself from scratch.  But I'd like to do the rounded corners, and it'd be a bit of a paint to do that with the Path (yes I know you can do quad to and arcTo but it's still not as clean a solution as I'd like).</p>

<p>So in general, is it possible to combine two paths and create a single union object that traces the perimeter of both?</p>

mail(implode(',', $user_emails), $subject, $message);
</code></pre>

<p>I can set this script up as a cron and have it run every hour. All the emails are sent in one go with the mail function being called only once. The only drawback is user's aren't notified right away when they recieve a PM, but once within the hour. 
But that's not a big deal and something I can live with.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>is the cron method significantly better performance wise or is the increase negligable</li>
<li>is this the way most big sites do it? or is there a better way, some established library maybye?</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>I also enabled the JMXremote. And JConsole indicates that the peak heap memory usage is 700MB and peak permgen is 120MB. Linux top command indicates high CPU usage and Jconsole shows a SeedGenerator Thread uses 99% CPU from time to time. </p>

<p>I checked the OS random number pool and /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail has at least 120 all the time (most of the time the number is between 120 to 190). I even use rngd to bump up the available random bits but it doesn't help. I also removed /dev/random and linked /dev/urandom to it without any improvement. </p>

<p>The stack trace for the SeedGenerator thread is:</p>

<pre><code>  [DataMember]
  public PropertyId PropId { get; set; }

<p>It reports a serialization error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SerializationException:  Enum value '8493' is invalid for type
  'EnumType' and cannot be serialized. Ensure that the necessary enum
  values are present and are marked with EnumMemberAttribute attribute
  if the type has DataContractAttribute attribute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that particular enum value does not exist within the C# Enum definition because the PropertyId's are dynamic and may be added to the DB (but not deleted) between recompiles.  </p>

<p>Since we do not wish to require a recompile of the code just because a property was added, is there any workaround for this type of issue besides typecasting and serializing as an Int32 (that's where we started from but moved to improve type safety/readability).</p>

<p>We would like to use this same concept to extend type safety to even more ""generic"" ID's.  For instance, say something like OrderId.  There is an advantage to defining it as an enum to get the type safety throughout C#.  The actual enum values will not exist because they have a lifespan corresponding more with runtime vs compile time.</p>
